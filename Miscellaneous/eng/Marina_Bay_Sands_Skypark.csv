,,Marina Sands Skypark,5.0,,We had an awesome sunset experience here and could view the whole city ! We went up to the Ce La Vie to have a singapore sling and snacks and werent dissapointed !
,,Love the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark!,5.0,,Love the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark! Be sure to dine at Wolfgang Puck's delicious rooftop restaurant while on the roof of the Marina Bay Sands and enjoy the beautiful rooftop infinity pool! Especially beautiful at sunrise!!!
,,No swimming,4.0,,Earlier they used to let people swim in the infinity pool but not anymore but still its a place to visit and worthy of spending 1 hour easily.
,,"Great views, fancy prices",3.0,,The Sands complex rooftop has greart views and some nice but expensive opportunities. The developers have tried to cram too much in and whichever outlet you attend may be a bit of a disappointment as they are not connected and prices are steep.
,,Luxury at its best.,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a must visit architecture in Singapore. Something you can’t miss.

It’s massive, it’s beautiful and its luxurious. The changing lights at night makes it look awesome. Lovely dining areas, cafes, shopping options leaves you with lots to expect. You can spend your entire day admiring its beauty.

The sparkling lights on crystals with fishes at the bottom is a latest attraction inside the mall area. Ideally located with direct entry to gardens by the bay.

It has an observation deck on the top floor. Expensive but worth it."
,,Stunning views.,5.0,,"After seeing the gardens by night, this stunning cult building had great views all around to view over the whole of Singapore. It was beautiful. Inside was amazing shop bars a different experiences. Well worth a visit"
,,The crowds make it less enjoyable,4.0,,"The rooftop had obviously great views but they didn’t provide a single chair which is shocking because it doesn’t come with a cheap price.

The crowds are really making it hard to just enjoy the whole thing. A lot of screams and people standing forever.

It’s one of the best things to do in Singapore though but rethink about it if you’re on a budget."
,,A fantastic view,5.0,,"Sit in the bar have a Singapore sling and enjoy the fantastic view, especially at night.If you go to the bar area it's free."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"We paid more than twenty dollars just to take a lift to this roof top. The view is very beautiful but i think this view is too expensive, we only spend less than 10 minutes up there."
,,Great view but that’s all you get,3.0,,"It’s a great view but there is nothing else to do up there. At all. Look, take pictures and head down. Quite pricey but it’s expected."
,,Over priced and over rated,2.0,,You don’t get to see anything but the view which you can see from elsewhere in singapore. Seems the hotel only want extra money
,,Great view for that price,5.0,,"We bought a ticket to go to the ""ce la vie"" - bar on top of the building. From here you can see over the city an the pool of the hotel.
The price is not that cheap but you get a voucher to buy a cocktail or sth in the bar."
,,Rooms were average and small,3.0,,"For such an expensive hotel, you'd think the rooms would at least wow you. They did 'wow' me, just not in the positive way.. I was disappointed with the room. It was small, it wasn't decorated in any special way, and it just felt like any other hotel room. The only good thing about this hotel is obviously the infinity pool at the top of MBS, as seen by the numerous tourists on the first floor buying access passes to the skypark (they cannot access the pool though, it is for guests only).

The pool was great, but it wasn't like 'OMG!!!!!' great either, but maybe I set my expectations too high to begin with. It did have a nice view and food/drinks were expensive, but unless you're in the adults only pool, you won't get much peace. The other pools are filled with kids with floaties and their parents taking photos of everything.

I'd recommend just purchasing the skypark access ticket instead of staying at MBS. There are higher rated infinity pools than MBS."
,,Don't bother!,1.0,,"Absolutely disgusting! £55 for a family of 4 to get up to the sky deck to find no restaurants or bars that we were allowed in to as we weren't staying at the hotel, deck far too crowded to see very much followed by a ridiculous queue to try to get back down ... massive downer at the end of an otherwise great trip to Singapore!"
,,Sky deck disappointment,1.0,,"If you want to be one of the sheep, experience poor customer service then this is just for you. A waste of $22. Especially given we had the benefit of going on the Singapore flyer first. Recommend pay the extra and have a premium experience on the flyer instead."
,,Room with a view,5.0,,"Well this is great, three hotel towers hold this platform up, which has an infinity pool bar and restaurant. We went up at night to see the city lit up and it is amazing. You can see the Flyer and Gardens by the Bay from there along with everything else. S must visit."
,,views as far as the eye can see,4.0,,"Ticket can be purchased to access rooftop bar for sgd$22, this ticket can be used for food or drink at bar. Does not allow for access to pool area, which can still be viewed from same level.The views are amazing. Try to go on a clear day for best views"
,,Worth it,4.0,,"I read a lot of mixed reviews but this was worth it. $22 gets you to 57th floor bar. There is a bar on right and a bar on left right next to the pool which is pretty much what I assumed most people came to see. But most people went right for some reason so we went to the bar next to pool on left and there was plenty space and a credit towards your drink. We got 3 cocktails and it cost us $11 total after they deducted the entry fees. There are lounges if you lucky enough to snag one. We did after a while and enjoyed it so much we bought another round of drinks. At one stage during the night there was 2 sofas free so wasn't overcrowded at all. We got there at 7 and a lot of the crowd left around 830 after the light show at marina bay. The area we sat in closed at 10 so everyone had to move to the other bar on right which was packed. I was thinking of not going after reading reviews there. So glad I went.

P.s you could pay $30 for the observation deck but i dont think it's worth it. We walked past it and it's just a platform that extends out from area you are already in enjoying the views from. I can't see if makes much difference. I'd rather pay $22 and get a free drink pretty much."
,,First Visit to the Skypark,5.0,,"Ten Years ago My Granddaughter saw this Hotel being Built
This year she wanted to go up onto the Skypark.
I have been to Singapore 6 times in the last 10 years but this was my first time to go up to the Skypark.
What a view across the area- seeing is believing- well recommended.
Don't go up if the wind is very strong as it is 54 storeys up
I cannot wait to do a repeat
There is so much to see so allow plenty of time at the top"
,,Breathe Taking Views from this spot,5.0,,"I suggest go this spot by 5 pm and wait till the evening. Can see a really beautiful sky and a great sunset! Everything just become orange from the horozon at evening. You can enjoy the drinks (which are extremely overpriced) along with your visit. A worthy visit to pay, currently they charge $23 for adult to access the skypark where you can only the observation deck. (Do not spend this value if you are going for the infinity pool as it is only accessible by hotel guests). Else it is a best spot for viewing the beauty of singapore!!"
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,"Was a little sceptical about the charges when we paid $22 per person to travel up, but to our surprise it was fully redeemable against the drinks. (The drinks weren’t cheap, but you wouldn’t expect them to be) We enjoyed a few rounds at Ce La Vie on the Observation deck, staff were extremely friendly & accommodating – having arrived early evening we did get a seat & table, but later it was standing room only, probably a few extra people there as it was the rehearsal day for the National Day celebrations, so were treated to fireworks & aircraft fly pass whilst at the top – quite spectacular. To be honest if you go to Singapore you really do have to visit the Marina Bay Sands. Highly Recommended."
,,"A place for the view, but not in high heels",4.0,,"This is an area reserved for tourists, and it is basically a large observation area with a concession stand. It is however the thing to do if you want the best view of Singapore. Big warning for women who go there with high heels: The deck is wooden slats, and thin heels will get stuck in between the slats."
,,Great views from the Observation Deck,5.0,,If you're early there you won't have to queue for the ticekts or just order them online in advance. The staff are very nice and the views rom above just breathtaking. There's no better place to admire the city from the top. Good price.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Night or day this is worth a visit but beware! If you go for a cocktail you pay 22 Singapore dollars which is refunded against your cocktail but you cannot get to the viewing platform. You still have a great view especially at night. The viewing platform costs 35 dollars each and there is no refund on a drink or anything but you can use the infinity pool if you wish and you do get the better view of the Singapore skyline. In all honesty we enjoyed just sitting with our cocktail and taking in the spectacular view. We also had some tapas with our cocktail it was excellent and well priced for where we were.
,,amazing,5.0,,"This hotel is amazing. The food and drinks aren't cheap though. It is attached to a mall, casino, and the subway. We took the clean subway all over the city and it was easy to use. The pool is just like the pictures you see. It is awesome. There is even an adult area which is nice because there are lots of families. There is not much shade though so pack sunscreen. The rooms are great, but you need to go downstairs for a $7 coffee in the morning."
,,The best vantage point of Singapore's financial district,5.0,,"The best vantage point of Singapore's financial district especially at dusk and during the national holidays. It is possible to order snacks, beers and light alcoholic beverages. Discount for drinks and meals for people who buy tickets to the bar and restaurant part. Discounts are not granted for those who have tickets only to the viewing terrace."
,,Amazing beyond words...,5.0,,"I had some business meetings with a few friends pictured below that I had to attend at this hotel and I was blown away by the beautiful elegance of the whole complex, the kindness and care of the staff and the food and drinks all top notch. Amazing beyond words and the got a huge boat on the roof... that was something to see. Thank you for the excellence and generosity you share. See you on my next visit God willing."
,,A must bo in Singapore.,5.0,,"The lift takes us up to the top floor, level 57, in 45 seconds. 4 seniors tickets at $27 each gets you there plus 2 Singapore Slings. The girls loved them.. The guys had Tiger beer on tap. Geat views all around. Only down point.....no seating but we enjoyed it."
,,Extrenely expensive but an experience,4.0,,"We stayed in the hotel for one night. It's unbelievably expensive but the rooms are amazing. The bed is the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The pool is fantastic too, especially after sunset. Only negative point: there's no plug in the bathroom for a hair dryer."
,,Expensive for what it was.,3.0,,Not worth the money. We had a better view from our 27th floor room at the Holiday Inn Atrium. Very few facilities were accessible to none residents.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,"I loved the view from the Skypark on the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands. It was amazing to gaze across all the apartments over the city, the tall towers of the downtown district, and the hundreds of ships anchored offshore"
,,Stunning Singapore View,5.0,,"I planned to go to Singapore Flyer but damn, was unfortunate as the flyer was closed because of bad weather. Without losing a minute I ran to Marina Bay Sky park and got the tickets to observatory. A must go location to see Singapore with bird's eye view. Don't this experience. The Marina Bay Sands Sky Park offers the most amazing view possible. Even if you have seen the world from other high towers, this is a unique experience. You can buy the ticket online or under Tower 3(not much crowded) from where you would go up to the 56th floor to a completely new world. There is no time restriction and you can stay up there for however long you want by paying 25 SGD for a ticket. You can easily spend 2 hours and see the view from all around. You can grab couple of drinks as they have bar up which is reasonable. The best time to reach is 15 or 20 minutes before sun set. The Sunset followed by the night view. The Night view is crazy. All the attractions you see all around Singapore will light up and you will go mad. This looks like a magical world. You can also see the 2 light shows from above, although they look better from the ground. (Would recommend going up in the evening and seeing Singapore light up)."
,,Singapore visit,5.0,,The two days I spent in Singapore were totally worth it! Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a stunning piece of architecture!
,,Birds Eye View,4.0,,"If you are into views going to the top pf the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is one place to go. It will cost to gain access to the Skypark and when you are up there you have limited access as the rest is reserved for guests who pay a lot of money to stay there.

Some good all round views and there is a bar there that will supply you with refreshments. You may want to try a Singapore Sling for example at $15 sgd a glass, well it is a one off and cheaper than buying a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar in Raffles Hotel.
Worth a 30 min visit."
,,Have a meal or a drink at the top and enjoy the view.,4.0,,"We went up for a drink but stayed for a light lunch. The food was quite nice, my Wife enjoyed her cocktail while a savoured an icy cold Tiger beer. And the view- absolutely stunning!"
,,Beautiful views,5.0,,"Amazing and absolutely beautiful views and especially nice area to take pictures with family.

If you go to Singapore, this attraction is a must, it is reasonably priced and well worth the visit as you can see the entire city from the top of the skypark.

In addition to the picturesque views you can get a real feel of the atmosphere of Singapore."
,,Marina bay sands,4.0,,Was enjoyable . The architecture was worth pondering on . beautiful view from the top . My teen enjoyed the view and the architecture
,,Great views over Singapore,4.0,,"Great vantage point to see the whole of the city, the gardens, F1 pits and part of the track, over the harbour and watch the planes landing"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Skyparks are always breathtaking and so is this one. If you wanna avoid sunburn, go later in the evening and stay for sunset or till the light show which starts at 8pm."
,,Go for a drink in the bar,3.0,,It's A great view but very expensive. I had a Singapore sling and it was great but my wife's prosecco was poor. Even though we paid $44 to get to the bar on the top floor we still had to pay $12 for our drinks (you pay $22 each to get to the bar and get that value in food/drink tokens).
,,Must visit.....weather permitting.,4.0,,The views from the skypark are breathtaking. You can see all of Singapore and a couple of Indonesian islands. But be sure to go when the weather isn't too hot and the skies are clear.
,,Perfect panoramic view for hotel guests,5.0,,The Skypark on the 57th floor is only available for hotel guests. As an alternative you can have a drink at the rooftop bar or lounge. There is a minimum spend of 22 dollar but the views are comparable and breathtaking.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel with its swimming pool, garden and restaurants is an unforgettable experience. You should book at least two overnight stays there."
,,Sundown at the MBS top deck,5.0,,"I've been there before, but this time together we spend some 3 hours on the top deck to see the sun go down and the city come to life with all its lights. The view is magnificent both during the day as well as at night, but the change over nightfall is just amazing. At 20:00 there is the light show in front of the MBS which is repeated at 21:00. Watch it first from the to deck and then go down for a seat at the waterfront. Wonderful!"
,,Beautiful Views of the City,5.0,,"There was no queue when I arrived to purchase tickets. There are machines so its very straight forward. Don’t forget, if you travelled with Singapore Airlines, bring your ticket with you so you get a discount. The lift takes you to the top (again no queue). There is lots of space when you arrive at the top so no need to be jostling with other tourists to get a glimpse of the queue. Can see unspoilt views of Singapore from the top and even the Infinity Pool of the hotel. As you can imagine the view is high so you can see the full city - almost a bird’s eye view. I spent some time relaxing up there, although it does get a bit windy. I wouldn’t say it is a must do if you are limited on time but definitely a nice experience if you have the time."
,,Wow! Just... Wow!,5.0,,"This was on our ""must do"" list when we visited Singapore and it did not disappoint. The views are spectacular, for sure! Go up at around 6:30pm or so. Stay to see the light show on the garden side and then another light show on the bay side. Down side -- they crowd you into the elevator up and down... really crowd you in. At one point, I had people touching me on all four sides. So check your personal space at the door for about 30 seconds each way. Other than that... awesome!"
,,Gardens by the Bay...,5.0,,The ultimate experience The light and sound show . Ultimate experience awesome ...donuts miss the show from top of the tree....
,,Bird's Eye view of the City,5.0,,At 56th Floor on top of the hotel you get to see a great panoramic view of the city. $25 per person if you buy at the counter.
,,Fulfilled a dream view,5.0,,"Visiting Marina Bay Sands and spot that world famous view of Singapore , was on my bucket list. Finally we did it. What a breathtaking view up there. We visited the pub, had couple of drinks and spotted the amazing view. it wowed me. You must definitely visit this place."
,,Ce La Vie option gets you a free drink and the views!,5.0,,Came for the Sky Park and to have a drink and see the views from the roof top bar! Dress code was smart casual for the bar and if men were wearing shorts they couldn’t get into the night club and men had to have their feet covered but apart from that they seemed pretty relaxed. The views were so nice from the 57th floor I think and the drinks were reasonable for Singapore. $28 cover charge to get in but that included a drink (not a cocktail) when you got up there. We had a couple of cocktails each and think they were around the $25 mark each which didn’t seem bad at all for the setting. Would love to stay here for a couple of nights next time I come to Singapore as the infinity pool looked insane!
,,Worth seeing the view,4.0,,Great views of the city from the skypark both during the day and at night when you can see the spectra light and water show
,,Amazing,5.0,,We went right up to the top deck and the view was amazing. What a view. A definite must whilst in Singapore
,,MBS,5.0,,Take the Ce La Vi option. You get a drink credit and the view. The Skypark observation is the main outside view but no access to the bar.
,,Went at Night,4.0,,"We had an 8 hour transit in Changi Airport from 12:00 Midnight.
The airport's spectacular areas were already closed and parks/tourist spots were closed as well. We went on a restaurant here to meet a friend and she toured us around Marina Bay Sands - even though the time were late, it was still an amazing sight to see."
,,EXPENSIVE BUT GREAT!!!,5.0,,We had the most beautiful view of the gardens and the light show that night and the room was lovely.
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"One can't fault the view - amazing. When we went not over crowded either. It is a little pricey (we had the singapore sling slush drinks as well - so hot up there).

One can though purchase a ticket to go in the bar. Slightly less than the viewing section and I believe you have to sit at a set table so you don't get all the amazing views. Depends if you want to go up see the view or just go up this unique building."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Amazing engineering, architecture and views. This landmark dominates the skyline like a slumbering StarWars giant. Agree that the extra cocktail is a complete rip off - plastic tumbler with alcoholic slush puppy. Save your tourist dollars for something better."
,,Skip the Singapore's king add-on,4.0,,"Amazing views so it's virtually a must-do once. The Singapore Sling option is a waste though. A slushie in a plastic cup, collected from a kiosk on the top deck and nowhere to sit makes it a let down. Go to Raffles Long Bar for the drink."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,Magnificent views in every direction. Highy recommend a visit if you are in Singapore. Take the lift in Tower 3 and not overley priced
,,Amazing hotel,4.0,,"I must start by saying that this is a beautiful hotel that one should visit if you are in the area, regardless of going to the observation deck. Going to the top is 30 Singapore dollars, which is rather pricey, but I do hear that those who go enjoy it and say the views are spectacular. However, we went up to the restaurant on a very high floor and got amazing views from there. Also don’t miss the wonderful light and water show at night called Spectra."
,,1000 $ minimum spend!,1.0,,to use the bar or restaurant here you need to spend at least 1000$. Absurd. At that kind of money you probably end up sitting next to kardashians or chinoRussian oligarchs anyway.
,,What a view,4.0,,30sgd gets you up the lift and a drink at the top. Outstanding views and stunning at sunset. I wouldn’t want to be a guest here as they seem to have to push through the 100’s of tourists to get to the private pool.
,,The best view in Singapore,5.0,,"I have been up the the Skypark a couple of times and each time find it amazing. You get the most incredible view of the bay, the gardens, the city and beyond. You can also sit and enjoy the refreshments when up there. There was no waiting line to buy tickets. Don't this out of this when you visit Singapore."
,,Bucket list tick,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this view, however on a hot sunny day shade is limited. Plus no seating to take a moment to rest while enjoying the magnificent view."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Our trip to Marina sand bay was excellent. We enjoyed every minute of it. Extremely exciting events.
,,Observation deck,4.0,,View was great but there was only a small area to walk around and with no shade we didn't stay up there very long.
,,Over rated,2.0,,Went to the top of the Marina Bay sky park and thought this was over rated. We went up at nighttime and cost me $66 dollars Singapore. For an extra dollar you get a cocktail that is so full of ice that there is hardly anything to drink. We went up on a Monday night and it was crowded with night clubbers and you can barely get a view v
,,Size is everything,5.0,,This is the biggest hotel I have ever seen . You can walk all the way through it to the gardens outside. The foyer is always busy and the views from the foyer looking up are amazing . There is a infinity pool way up outside on the roof which is floating in the sky. Not to be missed
,,Beautiful Skypark,5.0,,"Very chaotic place and busy as it’s pack of tourists, but it all goes smoothly. Thanks to the staff who are very helpful. A place that is highly recommended to those tourists visiting Singapore. Should not missed this place if you want to see the entire view of the city. Just lovin’ it."
,,Perfect top of the world views.,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore. A perfect 180% view of Singapore. Excellent for photos and adventure lovers.
,,4 plus Stars - This iconic site must be visited!,4.0,,"4 Plus Stars - While in Singapore you will see this iconic site from all points throughout the City. Would you visit New York and not see the Statue of Liberty? The observation deck on the top floor is the Skypark and is where you go. While our tour guide suggests that you visit at sunset, this time may not fit into your schedule when touring so go during the day. There are MANY expensive restaurants in this building and inexpensive food court options in the shopping center which is connected to this building. There are also reasonable priced restaurants on the bay side of the building at ground level just outside the shopping center.
Suggestion: Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest, the Flower Garden are adjacent to this location and can be done while visiting the Skylark."
,,Very busy,5.0,,Was going to stay here but we’re advised not to by friends due to the frantic turnover. We popped in as we had booked something and Whow how busy it was. Please don’t be put off as it’s a lovely place. It’s a meeting place for everyone downstairs.
,,Lunch dining at Spago,5.0,,Great food at Spago! Great value and service staff were great! I will definitely come back for more.
,,Had dinner at thid hotel,5.0,,"What a hotel. Booked dinner there so we could get to have a look around. The pool is something else, you look like you will swim off the edge- 57 floors up. The shopping Mall across the road is something else, if its not there you don't need it!!!!!"
,,Better view as compared to Singapore flyer,4.0,,"Pros - Nice place to see top view of Singapore.Better to visit in the evening.Wind flow is considerable hence be careful while using hats ,umbrellas.Sometimes little rain shower add to the nice experience.Lot of scope for photography.Good view of Gardens by the Bay.May spent one hour at the observation desk."
,,Gay this a miss as totally overpriced,2.0,,I am sure the view was nice but we decided in principal not to go up the top as we found the rates being charged outrageous for what was just going to be at a small viewing platform and did not include seeing the pool nor even being able to go to the restaurant. We found SINGAPORE in general to be so overpriced - especially for simple things like a cup of tea. Long gone are the days when Singapore was a place to go to for shopping. MArina Bay Sands is absolute price gauging!
,,Bad bad bad,1.0,,"My family visit the skypark in July. Never expected toddler they also charged @ 17 sgd. She is less than 3 years old, doesn't know even ABC. How come they sucks up everything , not acceptable at all."
,,Excellent views,4.0,,"It’s worth the visit. You get great views of all of Singapore. I would recommend visiting the sky park rather than the flyer, there is no need to do both as you see the same views. Take your time and walk around the deck. Plenty of good photo opportunities. A must visit"
,,Coool rooftop bar- huge!,4.0,,"Once up there with the rapid elevator you’re looking along some 145 meters of a curved ship-like construction, supercool and with a stunning view of downtown."
,,On the 44th floor!,5.0,,We stayed overnight and chose deluxe king harbour view room. Huge room and lovely views overlooking Gardens by the Bay and Singapore Harbour. There are 3 towers. Very huge. The pool at the top is massive and very busy with many tourists. We chose to eat a light meal for dinner in the bar area by the pool. Breakfast not included but we ate our breakfast in one of the many restaurants on the ground floor. If you want a more quieter and smaller hotel then this hotel is not for you. We did enjoy our stay here.
,,Beautiful view of Singapore,5.0,,Didn’t go when we came 2 years ago but was tempted this time. The price is reasonable (~£15) and they do a concession if you have Krisflyer membership. Really amazing view from the top. We went around 5pm and stayed till sunset as it looks even nicer at night. Highly recommended.
,,Wonderful View,5.0,,Amazing view and worth a visit especially at sunset.Great opportunity to take some amazing photos of the city.
,,Marina bay,4.0,,A lot to see. Restaurants and shops all over. Fountain show every night. Also lightshow at gardens at the bay.
,,Great time at the viewing deck,5.0,,"This is a must do if you are in Singapore, loved it!!! We missed the lines so quick I would recommend!"
,,Hot and lack of shade!,2.0,,"I paid $30 to go up to the deck to view the city and to get a 'Singapore Sling'. Upon arrival at the top it was boiling hot (I knew this as it was middle of the day). The thing that angered me was the complete lack of shade. It is just a big wooden deck that radiates heat with no where to go to get out of the sun. I found a cubic square metre of shade (literally) by a small souvenir stall. I could see everyone on the deck felt uncomfortable in the heat, trying to find shade. The Singapore Sling was a tiny plastic cup and very overpriced for the $10 price tag.

So overpriced and will never go up again.

I would recommend to anyone going up to go in the evening when it is cooler."
,,Very nice hotel,5.0,,Marina bay sands is the best luxurious hotel in singapore for stay..very nice scenary and garden by the bay looks awesome from there
,,Spectacular Singapore Views,4.0,,The Skypark has free entry to anyone staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Fabulous view of the Marina & city of Singapore -its well worth visiting
,,Spectacular,5.0,,I would recommend visiting 1/2 before dusk because then you can see the daylight and night time views.
,,Overlooking view of the city,3.0,,"I'd say this is an overrated activity sold to tourists. Sure, the view is great but the price and waiting time to get up to the 52nd floor then down again just can't compensate for it. The place is crowded and you're just there to take a photo for social media. There are far better places to prove you've been to SG. However, if the cityscape is what you're after, then the skypark is your best bet."
,,Worth a look and a quick cocktail,4.0,,Every tourist should go have a look at the view. There are bars up the top which are wonderful You can not use the pool so it is a bit weird drinking and watching through the glass everyone having fun on a hot day. Wasn't as nice a I thought it would be but still recommend going.
,,Pick the drinks option,4.0,,"We went for the option where you essentially pay for a drink and go to the bar rather than the sky deck. You can sit down on either side and get all the views but it’s not crowded. The better side was by the pool as there were comfy lounge sofas, the other side was pretty stark. Was also interesting seeing the pool - glad I wasn’t staying at the hotel that’s for sure!"
,,Was nice. Better and cheaper than the flyer,4.0,,You have a great view over the bay area. The entrance fee can be reduces if you have a singapore Airlines passboard. To 18 $ per person (33 $ at the flyer). The view is great and the same as from the flyer. If you would like to drink something think about getting a combo for 30 $ the dinks are quite expensive 9 $ for non alcoholic and 19 $ for a beer.
,,Glad we were only visiting,3.0,,"We visited the top viewing gallery, but was very disappointed with the actual place, looks very faded and jaded, no one served us for ages, views were magnificent, drinks extremely expensive, too many smokers and burger smells. Think this may be a ‘pick up’ place as lots of dubious women on their own lounging about - but not drinking!"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"One of kind structures in the world. With a swimming pool on the top of the roof, looking to Singapore skyline. The view is amazing."
,,A must see in Singapore the panoramic view is mesmerizing,5.0,,By far this was the most dramatic tour during out stay. Make sure you take a selfie stick to get the best pictures. Try to go first thing in the morning when it is not too hot or crowded. It is connected to the mall and casino so if it starts raining you can enjoy the rest of your time there
,,MBS Skypark,4.0,,Superb view of singapore skyline. Better to visit towards evening so as to have a day / night view of city. No time limit for staying on top. Do also check about entrance option to cafe on top. This could be a better alternative.
,,A must of every stay in Singapore,5.0,,"It is worth to make photos of all angles of the skypark , so much to explore, lot of theme activities dependent on the season, do not miss Chines New Year, Christmas Time and the Moon Festival"
,,An amazing building!,5.0,,We spent a few days in Singapore and thought we would check this place out. We managed to get ourselves to the top for a drink. It costs to go up but if you order a drink then you can use your ticket price to pay for the drink. Expensive but you have to do it! The view is amazing. We went up in daylight and stayed long enough to see the view in the dark also.
,,Unique visit worth doing,5.0,,"The Skypark is on the top of Marina Bay Sands and gives you a wonderful view of Singapore and the downtown area. It costs S$22 per person but you can use that on a drink or food so its not lost money. Walking around Marina Bay precinct you are drawn to the large boat on the 3 towers. The cost up is to the bar area and if you want to see a bit more then you pay for the skywalk - which gives you access to the area around the bar and the side of the building.
This does not give you access to the infinity pool - hotel guests only for the pool.
Its fun and worth the visit."
,,Evening visit,5.0,,"Would recommend going up in the evening and seeing Singapore light up. You can also see the 2 light shows from above, although they look better from the ground. Once you are up there, there is a bar area to get a drink but if you want to go to the restaurant you aren’t able to go back onto the observation deck."
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,Go to mbs skypark and have the beautiful view of the city from top and also the hotel has infinity pool. It was pleasant and scenic beauty of Singapore
,,Great view,5.0,,"Great view of Singapore. Quite pricey but if it's once you visit this metropolitan, this is a must. Great for photos and the view is amazing. There is a bar, coffee stand and souvenir shop at the top but expect inflated prices. For a once in a life time experience this was worth it."
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,"Best place to see all of Singapore, amazing view, only thing that would have improved it would be if there was more seating up there so we could stop and have a seat and a cold drink. There was one table with two chairs at the little refreshements shop."
,,not worth the money,1.0,,"a high-speed lift will bring you to the rooftop. no shelter from sun or rain, a simple rooftop which you can literally pass in minutes. explanations of what you are looking at in various languages. small coffee-shop for a limited selection of snacks/drinks (bloody expensive) and thats it. you can not enter the pool or restaurant area (hotel guests only)."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"We bought a voucher 23 dollars each, you up the lift which allows to go to sky bar & you can use it against food/ drinks. The views are amazing they let you stay as long as you wish, if you want to you can open a tab, yes the drinks are expensive but it is fabulous experience & better than paying just for viewing platform, which is the same price 23 dollars per person. A must visit in Singapore."
,,Decent view - not worth the money,2.0,,"We were disappointed by this visit to the Skypark. The architecture of this building is impressive and fun, but it's a tourist trap."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Something different. You can see in every direction. Trees at the top, pool. Visit by us, staying by the privileged"
,,"Nice View, But Don't Go Out of Your Way",3.0,,"We love interesting structures so it was cool to see but the viewing area is limited. If the weather is nasty, there isn't much of a view. We had found a tour on the GPSmyCity app that included this so it was worth a try but I wouldn't say this would be a memorable event.
FYI - you can't get to the pool from the observation deck. You'll have to shell out some bucks to stay in the hotel if you want that privelege!"
,,Fabulous building and view,5.0,,Amazing structure. Go up in the day time for a great view. Better than in the evening. You can buy a drink voucher down in the lobby then go up and have a drink up there.
,,What an amazing hotel,4.0,,This is certainly a must do visit both during the day and at night stunning views just amazing especially at nght
,,Nice aerial view of Singapore,4.0,,It was a nice experience to get the aerial view of Singapore and its river. Actually it is the roof of Marina Bay hotel. I booked skip the line tickets. And it was very useful to get immediate entry. Overall a nice experience.
,,Good views but expensive,3.0,,"Costs $20 (Singapore) per person to go to the top of the tower. The $20 is a credit for the bar at the top. Prices for drinks start at $20, so not cheap at all. Pint of Stella $20 (about £14) ,London would be proud of the prices. Visited at night and the views were great, but if you want to walk around the perimeter, it is another $20 each!"
,,Excellent view. Buy your discounted entry online.,4.0,,"I believe it is certainly worth watching the sunset over Singapore from the Skypark. We bought discounted entry vouchers online. We then decided to go into the cocktail bar before we left and discovered that if you pay the $23 to go up to the cocktail bar, you get a voucher to redeem your entrance fee on drinks! And the view is just as good if not better! What better way than to enjoy the view with a delicious Singapore Sling."
,,Why? Ride the wheel instead.,1.0,,"Small, cramped, and overpriced. Yeah the view is nice, but you really feel like a 2nd class citizen when you squeeze onto the “skypark” and are literally looked over by the people staying at the Sands. Yeah, the hotel cost 4 billion US to build but you think that they would recoup that from the gamblers not the plebes that want a view."
,,Awesome Experience !!!,5.0,,A must go location to see Singapore with bird's eye view. MBS Skypark is more preferred than Flyer as it is higher and allows you to spend more time.
,,Is not worth it,1.0,,"Even though it has a nice view over the city, is extremely expensive. We payed 23 dolars per person and you are only allowed to stand in a deck. There are not even chairs, or shadow, or real place to sit for coffee!!! There is a restaurant that can be access only after 6pm. When entering, they take a picture of you which you can after purchase for 80 dolars!!!! Completely ridiculous!!! Use the money for something else."
,,Nice Hangout Spot!!!,5.0,,"Second visit, I totally recommend. This place is ideal for family, friends and couples...Super kool atmosphere with a great view!"
,,On Top Of The World,5.0,,"There is no way you should miss this experience. The Marina Bay Sands Sky Park offers the most amazing view possible. Even if you have seen the world from other high towers, this is a unique experience. You can buy the ticket online or under Tower 3 from where you would go up to the 56th floor to a completely new world. There is no time restriction and you can stay up there for however long you want by paying 25 SGD for a ticket. You can easily spend 2 hours and see the view from all around. You can see everything from a birds eye view. The best time to reach is 15 or 20 minutes before sun set. The Sunset followed by the night view. The Night view is crazy. All the attractions you see all around singapore will light up and you will go mad. This looks like a magical world."
,,Wowzer,5.0,,The view from the roof bars at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark are amazing. Being in one of the bars for a sundowner cocktail is part of the Singapore experience.
,,Ridiculously photogenic and awesome,5.0,,"Selfie-Land. Period. Everyone is taking selfies and it is a bit silly... but the pool IS the reason to stay at the hotel and it IS worth it. Put on a robe and live it up. While enjoying the view, try noshing on some Wolfgang Puck fare and a Singapore Sling. Recommend getting up there early to stake out the best seats. Spend the first half of your day at the pool and the rest enjoying the REAL Singapore."
,,Fantastic views.,5.0,,We went up to the Skypark at night as this is the best time to photograph Singapore. You have to buy tickets which are about $25 each but worth it. There are 3 elevators and it takes about 30 seconds to reach the top. There is a wait of about 5 mins for the lifts. The views at the top are amazing. There are safety barriers all around the viewing platform. There are bars and a restaurant up there but are for hotel guests only.
,,Very nice views,4.0,,Tickets were expensive but frozen Singapore Sling was very good place to enjoy amazing view of the bay from the top. Up & down way was great feeling!
,,Go to Ce La Vie for best deal,5.0,,"Do NOT pay for the tour, but buy the restaurant/bar entrance for slightly less and get most of that back with food/drink credits. No pool admission but great views in all directions. Great afternoon stop."
,,Glad we came but expensive,4.0,,"There are six of us in our family and I purchased everyone a ticket. Came to £174 including the frozen Singapore slings. The view is great but the experience of getting up down was a bit bumpy and unceremonious given the cost.

Would I say it is good value for money - I’m not sure. However to start the holiday by having a drink at the top of the building was lovely and our family enjoyed it."
,,Iconic View of Singapore,4.0,,Absolutely stunning at night! You cannot visit the pool unless you are a hotel guest but you can nave a cocktail next to it in Ce La Vie Bar. Stand in line to get your admission ticket which includes a drink in the bar on the 57th floor. Tables are hard to come by. We went right after the light and water show outside Marina Bay Sands. The MBS hotel was one of my obsessions that I loved seeing in Singapore from every angle!
,,Beautiful Spot with incredible views,5.0,,Once in a lifetime experience to visit this iconic spot. loved it! Visit both day and night to see the difference.
,,Would recommend,4.0,,We went up to the sky park during the day time to see the views. We bought the admission ticket which included a frozen Singapore Sling at the top for $30 each. Bit disappointing that you have to sit on the floor as there's no benches / seating as you're not allowed in the cafe but worth going up for the great views!
,,Deserves a visit - stunning views,5.0,,"As you know the marina bay hotel you cannot visit the pool area (tower 1-2), you can visit tower 3 the end part to look out onto Marina bay. Stunning view , nothing much to do apart from the inspiration views 23$ adults is ok like.

I will actually recommend this visit"
,,Stunning views !!,5.0,,"As soon as you enter lift in Ground floor which takes you to 57th floor in mere 45 seconds you will definitely have an amazing experience.

It was a clear day and you get sweeping views across the city, strait, gardens by the bay etc.

One of a kind experience and it's worth it!!"
,,Spectacular View of Singapore from the Top Down,4.0,,"Well worth the price of admission. The admission can be used for your drink purchase at the bar. Grab a table close to the rail if you find one available, have a drink or two and enjoy the view and the photo opportunities."
,,The best views available,5.0,,"So worth going to the top for the these views. Sit and enjoy or drink, or just take photos from the different levels, while getting a feel for Singapore from the 'top'."
,,The absolute view,5.0,,If you visit Singapore you have to drink a cocktail there .The view is unbelievable . You have to pay ticket around 20 dollars to get in the bar and the drinks are about 20 more but for sour is worth every penny!!
,,Trully awesome,5.0,,This place is amazing but if you go up just before sunset the view and time are totally worth it! The views speak for themselves but the sunset gives it a special flavor! Bucket list material!
,,Think before you visit,3.0,,"When we purchase the tickets ....it is only for visiting the top floor that is 56-57 floor of the Hotel Marina Bay Sands. Undoubetly, its a masterpiece of construction.....but majority of what you see on the youtube videos or what you hear about the MBS Skypark is not accessible. The view of Singapore is amazing from here. However, it is definitely NOT WORTH the MONEY charged in this tour.
If you are with family including small kids....i dont think the kids will be impressed too much. But if you are only a couple....you can spend an hour talking at those heights.
Now i was also advised not to go....but i still went to quench my curiosity with the logic....that i dont want to miss this attraction.....But i can say with confidence....if you have limited Time or Budget.....skip this without any guilt...Its waste of time and money. The place looks better from Fullerton square....attend the Light and Sound Show every evening at 8:00 & 9:00 pm. Its worth it and free. Good photo shop moments."
,,"On a clear day, you can see forever...",5.0,,"You might think twice about paying for a view when they are to be had from every hotel window BUT...

The S$20+ it costs to get a 360 degree view of Singapore and over the horizon is well worth it. Go earlier in the morning to avoid the crowds waiting for the lifts."
,,A little over rated tourist jammed and hugely expensive place to visit,3.0,,For whatever reason everyone goes to Marina bay sands and to the roof top. It reads and looks better than the actual experience. External visitors pay a hefty fee to use an escalator and get an inclusive overpriced drink. Its often crowded at the top and the space available to external visitors very limited to explore. Even for hotel guests this tends to be a sleeping factory with a large chinese population. There are so many other excellent roof top viewing spaces in Singapore that far surpase this one. Try one Altitude or a free observation at the Pinnical.
,,Great view!,5.0,,Get a drink ticket from the lobby of tower 3 and go to the top. The view is awesome and the drinks are great. It's worth it!!
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"The marina bay skypark is better looking up at it than looking down from it!
Looks higher from below and as it is only 56 floors high when you view from the platform you think, mmmm! The skyline isn't amazing like Shanghai for instance or the view from say, the empire state building in new York so if you've travelled a fair bit and been up some of the world's tall buildings you Mau find yourself as underwhelmed as we were. Also, you pay 23 sgd to go to viewing platform where you can buy a drink from a 'kiosk'. There is no seating area so the 'poor people' have to sit on the floor! If you pay more and queue you can go a few steps up and sit in a bar and look down on the poor people. If you can afford £500 per night for a room at the hotel you can be one of those people who feel the need to show that they are even more superior by wandering around in a white pool robe and slippers with your bathing costume on...absolutely ridiculous."
,,Holiday.,5.0,,This was a great experience. Vision will depend on how clear the air is. We were so fortunate to get the RAF fly over as we were up there. Seniors rate of $20 per head and worth it. Wanting to charge $60 for the photo an absolute rip off. Definitely a birds eye view of Singapore.
,,Good view and refreshments available,4.0,,Great 360 degree view of Singapore especially on a good clear day. There is a snack area for some drinks and nibbles. There is also a bigger restaurant upstairs with a view of the Marina Bay Sands Pool. Definitely worth a trip and the money.
,,Complete Rip Off,1.0,,"Do not pay for this, just go to the Ce La Vie restaurant and pay $22 and haves drink in the bar and your $22 is credited against your bill. The view is better than the Skypark."
,,"Its expensive, but it probably is worth it.",4.0,,"Went up for a night view, having watched the 8pm light show down by the waterfront, we headed up to the skypark and watched the 9pm light show from above to get a different perspective. The observation deck was busy at 9pm but soon emptied out and by 9.30pm it was easy enough to get pics without others in view.

Expensive - yes. But compared to the price of other viewing platforms and towers in global cities it's actually reasonable value. And of course the weather will make or break the value of this attraction."
,,place to see in Singapore,4.0,,Probably one of the most visited place in Singapore and great for city views! It gives very nice ambience with all the lights on in the night!
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"We went to the pool around 2 in the afternoon and weren’t expecting a seat by the pool. However, we got two spots on chairs in the pool area. We were promptly greeted by staff and given a menu. We ordered drinks. Once they bought out a wrong drink but were fine with replacing it with the correct one once we waved them down.

Things to note: do not take your drinks into the pool father then where the wood is. It’s not allowed.

Do not sit on the edge of the pool.

We didn’t do either but saw others get asked to move off the ledge or come in with their drinks.

There was a male/female photographer in the pool who will take photos of you and give you a band to go check them out later. We didn’t mind at first, but she kept having us do super cheesy photos for like 5 minutes that we just weren’t into. We never ended up checking the photos.

The next morning we were up for sunrise and it was surprisingly busy. However, it had amazing views on the side where the hot tubs are.

If you don’t have kids - for sure sit in the adults only zone."
,,A little disappointed.,3.0,,"It is made very clear to me when i accessed the observation deck that i was not able to access the bar and restaurant. So the only things other than the view was a little souvenir desk and small snack/ drink counter. So I spent all of 10 minutes up there. The view is good. But the best view in my opinion was over the Gardens by the Bay.
I guess it’s a must for a visit to Singapore but not convinced it’s great value for money."
,,Celia vie,5.0,,"Emz Was amazing great service and lovely afternoon, thank you. Fantastic value cost you ride up in lift but that gave you a free drink. Lovely relaxing music and the view, amazing!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Sky Park visit,5.0,,One of the must visit places when u visit Singapore and ensure that u visit during sunset time to get the best of both the day and night biews.Excellent place to view from the top and a coffee to sip or have an ice cream along with it.
,,Too packed with tourist,3.0,,It would be awesome if the crowd ess could be handled so we as visitors are satisfied and happy in visiting the place.
,,Lunch during transit.,4.0,,"My husband and I had 12 hours to kill in Singapore! We took the MRT to Marina Bay Sands to experience the skylark and lunch. We started with a qwik beer in the lobby bar ( as we were a little early for lunch).. We took the option of a meal for lunch at the Asian fusion restaurant Ce La Vi on the 57th floor a truly spectacular view of Singapore skyline and a lunch that was exceptional yet very expensive. A Pinot noir from New Zealand will set you back about $150AUD and the set menu for $68 was very reasonable. We had king fish for starters, wagyu for mains and the dessert was a chocolate concoction to die for! It did rain a little but that did not have any impact on the view, in fact I think the fact that they closed the bar that was outside the restaurant only enhanced the view.
We then took the MRT to little India for another sensory sensation! If you follow me, you will see where we went next!"
,,Observation deck with a view,3.0,,Given that you can see the Skypark from almost anywhere in Singapore we took the mandatory trip to the rooftop for around S$38 each.We had to wait 45 minutes for the Ce la Vie bar to open only to be told that only hotel guests could enter the air conditioned area. Apparently their custom is more valuable than ours.
,,No Pool Access,4.0,,"This review is to resolve some confusion caused by pics and some reviews here on TripAdvisor's attraction page. You can't access the pool and the Skypark isn't the highest point of Marina Bay Sands. The entry to the pool is tightly controlled and the gates only open to residents, all given their own Key card. The viewing deck called Skypark is below the pool level and offers some great view of the city and photo-ops. You can still access the top floor and see the pool if you dine at one of their Al-fresco restaurants facing the pool but nothing will get you inside that iconic pool if you aren't staying with them.."
,,Must see when in Singapore,5.0,,Singapore is a small city with a lot of things to do. If you are visiting Singapore there is no way that you miss going to Marina Bay Sands. From entrance till you get to rooftop it’s all great fun! My teenage son does not really like going anywhere even he enjoyed the viewing deck. Go there at night as it’s pleasant and you can view entire lit island !
,,Sky bar at marina sands,5.0,,The bar and restaurant at the 57th floor is excellent Spent 2 hours at the top Excellent view and very good service Calamari is must !! Worth the money
,,High above Singapore 57 floors over a hotel,4.0,,You definitely get a great 360 degree view of Singapore downtown area and waterfront. Nearby the huge shopping mall and Gardens by the Bay. Worth an elevator ride up.
,,Only bother if a resident of Marina Bay Sands Hotel!,4.0,,"'Skypark' is probably a generous description of the observation deck, but the views are wonderful and it is a very pleasant place to be, particularly as the air is fresher up at that height (not so humid!). The pool is wonderful and a definite bucket list 'to do' but be warned the pool is only open to residents. It is also very busy early morning as people go up for a last swim before check out, so late morning is a great time to get that 'insta shot!'.
It is probably worth forking out for one night at Marina Bay Sands Hotel just to get that full experience, but try to find a good deal online, as the actual room is not as impressive as the prices suggest!
If you are not a resident, don't bother paying to go up to the skydeck, it won't really be worth it just for a ride up the elevator, a view and the opportunity to buy an overpriced beverage!"
,,High in the Sky(Park),4.0,,"Super high up, beautiful views of the whole city. YOU CAN ONLY GO UP ONCE, one ticket = one ride up so don’t try to go again the same day with the same ticket they’ll deny you access. Workers there very friendly and nice."
,,Bucket list do,5.0,,"My wife and I on the way back to NZ had to do one night at the hotel so we could go up to the sky park, this is a bucket list thing to do as it is amazing when you think how high up you are.
We spent a few hours in the pool and then had a cocktail and fries and then a few beers.
A must do visit, it gets very busy with all wanting to take pictures of the edge pool."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"I done this on my holiday, this was due to all the great reviews. This is a costly trip only to go to the observation deck. Beautiful panoramic views but nothing else. No information regarding the amazing build, no shade. We decided to have a cocktail in the bar. I knew we had to give our ticket over but on the understanding this would come of the drinks bill. The women looked us up and down then seated us in the middle of all the smoking area. We asked to move out of the smoking area to be told its this or go down stairs. We ordered cocktails and the bill arrived with the drinks. The waitress wanted payment before tasting. We where charged full amount with a large surcharge. I just paid in cash but she never even gave me the $9 change I was due. So to put it bluntly; it's not worth wasting your money and to be treated in this manor. I was truly embarrassed to be there with my friend's. Disgusting behaviour"
,,Drinks anyone!,4.0,,The view from the Marina Bay Skypark is amazing and well worth adding to your to do list in Singapore. Visitors can pay to access the observation deck or via paying to access the Bar area with the ticketed fee taken off the total cost of your drink. We enjoyed relaxing and taking in the view with cocktails in hand.
,,Totally Worth Staying Here,5.0,,"My family and I loved the Skypark during our stay at MBS. The water was perfect and it stays open late so you can enjoy a late swim but be warned it is always packed. But if you want some more room to enjoy, go to the adult only side. It was great and the food was pretty good as well."
,,"Breath-taking, top of the world feeling",5.0,,"Really enjoy the sense of Space and Freedom being so high up and able to enjoy a panoramic view of this part of Singapore. Simply soul-stirring beautiful! Deserves to be experienced at least once. There are several restaurants at the same level. I remember an Italian restaurant by the name of LAVO, which was plush, mysterious and inviting looking with romantic atmosphere and yet modern. I dined at LAVO; with delight...food was great and graced with superb attentive and friendly anticipative service. Like Like Like"
,,An amazing view,5.0,,Fantastic view of the city. A bit pricy for drinks but I am only like to go once so got to be done. a Thunderstorm came in which made it all the more dramatic but we were asked to leave the outside for safety reaosns.
,,A FANTASTIC STAY FOR US,5.0,,We pushed our limit and stayed 3 nights in a Grand Club Room that included breakfast and afternoon tea. For us it was a really good experience even at about £1500. I wince to say that it was good value at that cost but actually it was. We were looked after so very well by staff who at least appeared to enjoy doing their jobs and we were made to feel important and welcome and that our enjoyment of this 'world destination hotel' was all that mattered to them. A lovely and memorable experience. Would I stay again.....you bet......but first I'll have to win some money (or steal it) and would stay for as long as I could possibly afford to!!
,,Excellent architecture with beautiful view.,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is an integrated resort fronting Marina Bay. It features three 55-storey hotel towers connected by a 1 hectare sky terrace on the roof, named Sands SkyPark. The Sands SkyPark observation deck is on the 57th floor which gives a bird’s eye view of the city landmarks including the Gardens by the bay, Singapore flyer and the serene and beautiful sea. Preferably visit during the evening hours when the sun is not too harsh and spend some time here. It’s a photographer’s paradise."
,,Sightseeing,4.0,,"You get a spectacular 360 view of Singapore from the top,we were fortunate it was a clear day and you could see for miles."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"It was a nice view but cost a lot to get in and I was told the cost can go towards a drink, so I thought that is fine, but the drinks ended up costing a lot extra"
,,Singapore’s best view,5.0,,Sky Park is chargeable and it is worth. View from Sky park is amazing. Try to go there by evening so that you will get day view and night view as well. We saw spectra from the top and it was good. Sky Park is big so you can easily spend 1-2 hours there.
,,It’s OK,3.0,,"It’s a view of a city from high up. Probably stunning at night, but nothing too special during the day.
Worth noting that you can only access the observation deck and bar unless you’re a hotel guest, don’t expect access to the infinity pool.
Worth a drink at the bar for the novelty factor, but once in, you can’t go back out to the observation deck.
Take any photos from the deck on the upper bar level, as the level below has high barriers that will be in the way."
,,Great view,4.0,,At the top of sands skyparks you get a great view of Singapore .A must visit although you are only allowed to walk on the end of the hotel but still worth the price although the photo they try to sell you for a sovereign is costly .I went at 10am and there was no queue
,,Worth to visit when never you go for Gardens by the bay,3.0,,"It is nice to see from distance. You will get a good view of Singapore from the top. Other than the view, nothing very special for this attraction. But it is just walkable distance from Gardens by the bay and hence can visit on the same day."
,,It is a must if / when you are in Singapore,5.0,,I have been here several times and will go again the next time I'm back. While the food isn't all that good - you can certainly loose several hours with a few cocktails overlooking Singapore.
,,Architecture wonder,4.0,,"Amazing place , good views and photo opportunities a must see when in Singapore 🇸🇬 Buildings and Ferris wheel amazing - must see"
,,Breathtking View,5.0,,"Everyone should make this a must visit, especially the evening view. Gorgeous marina bay and gardens by the bay views."
,,Unbelievable...,5.0,,Stayed there for 3 nights and have never experienced anything like it. Beautiful views and plenty of pool area. Good food and drinks there also.
,,Recommend going at night,4.0,,"Bought tickets in advance, which in busy times might be worth while to save queing. Obligatory tourist photos taken of you before heading up in the lift to the sky deck.
Went around 8pm and bought a ticket which included a Singapore Sling slush drink, not sure it was worth having, and would probably not have aagain. Didnt have to queue at all, and there was plenty of space to walk around once at the top. Fantastic views of the skyline lit up at night.
If you time it right, you can see the light show in the gardens at 2045 and at 2100 the light show on the river."
,,Must must visit!,5.0,,The view is unbelievable! At any time of the day you go you will be amazed. If you are lucky enough to stay at the hotel you will have access to infinity pool which is wonderfull.
,,Million dollar view point,5.0,,"57 levels above ground...looking down.. it's breathtaking... I'm always amazed by this view when I'm up at the skypark and the structure of MBS itself is a pc of art! The 340m long ""spaceship"" where the infinity pool is a must be place.."
,,Great view,5.0,,"Arrived at almost 7pm, perfect timing for the sunset, clear view of the surrounding areas. There were introduction signs of some of the landmarks, in different languages. We waited till the night lights, Gardens by The Bay and the Singapore Eye was a great sight."
,,A must when you go the this city,5.0,,"Sky deck views are are absolutely unreal, the best way to get a 360 birds eye view of Singapore!. We were the 1st visitors of the day & there The pool area is only for guests which you pay for overnight, but the sky deck worth every penny."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,No where better to experience the views of Singapore whilst taking a dip in the pool. Seeing is believing!
,,Super place to spend the evening.,4.0,,What a wonderful place. Credit to all who built it and operate it. Spend the evening is fascinating. A place must visit
,,"The View, At Night, It's Why You Go!",5.0,,"The Marine Bay Sands is the quintessential photo we all see when they show photos of Singapore. Of course, I knew when I went to Singapore, this was a must stop, escpecially at night.

I was not disappointed, as the view was spectacular to overlook the city on one side, and then to overlook the Supertree Light Show from the other side was equally impressive.

This is a must do, but do it at night for full appreciation of what Singapore is all about in it's modernity."
,,AMAZING and worth every penny,5.0,,"The views you get from this sky deck are absolutely unreal, the best way to get a 360 birds eye view of Singapore! Paid £22 for 2 adults, (TIP: if you have a flight with Singapore airlines or silk air, tell them at the ticket office and get 15% off!)

So glad we did this it was the highlight of our trip in Singapore!"
,,MUST DO!!!,5.0,,Everyone who lands in Singapore has to do at least one night here!! We stayed in the cheapest room ($600+ per night x 3 nights x3 adult males) with city view and I would highly recommend to anyone that visits.
,,Sight to behold,5.0,,One of the landmark of a beautiful clean city .amazing place the staff are very proud of their workplace. The food presentation is the best I have ever seen.
,,Been before but always great.,5.0,,"My husband and I have been to the sky park before but another trip up to the top was still as good as the first time.
The views from there are wonderful and you can see most of the attractions like Bay Gardens, the Big wheel, Marina Bay Sands, and the city and harbour.
56 floors up. $23 adults $17 children

Do go you won’t be disappointed."
,,"It's just amazing and an unforgettable experience, or make booking for next time! :)",4.0,,"""A dream came true!"" - yes finally, we made it, - coming up here to Sands skypark, nearly! :) Ok, it isn't for nothing - It's Singapore - they know how much they can charge you for a very good expirience - once in a lifetime! If there is a next time, it's possible to get it for free! - you want to see the rest? - well, you have to make your booking at Sands for one night or two. TripAdvisor can help you! :) -we will do it! (with swimming :))
Up here you have the most fantastic outlook over the city skyscraper line and all the other Marina Bay attractions. Have a look around on the sea and to all this ships and tonnage waiting or going in and out Singapore harbour - every day, crazy!"
,,Lovely experience,4.0,,"You get a real view of the Singapore Bayfront as well as the skyscrapers from here. Go in the evening and see the sunset, it’s an awesome experience. You can sip a cup of coffee or have a chilled beer (depends on your taste buds) .

You can also witness the light show at the garden by the bay in the evening.

Take a walk and hop onto one of the river cruises to cover the entire Bayfront and all the quays to round up your evening."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Its quite a big hotel. We went after Gardens by the bay as its a walkable distance.
We did the Sky observatory desk. Its was ok. You can see Singapore 360 degrees.
The hotel should allow to view the swimming pool as well as the hotel is known for its swimming pool as well.
Later we visited the Casino also in the hotel. Good one to time experience."
,,Great views,3.0,,Great views and so worth the admission price. Wouldn’t have a drink in the bar there though as very expensive
,,Excellent view !!!,5.0,,"We visited in the night. What an amazing view of CBD, Marlian, Garden by the Bay and Flyer !!! The laser shows were OK."
,,High in the sky,5.0,,"This impressive building is dominant on the Singapore skyline, it's truly a work of art. We went up as night was falling, I would have liked to spend more time up there but our guide had other things to show us and it was rather crowded at the top (we were in Singapore during a public holiday). Fantastic view of the city!!"
,,First trip to Singapore,5.0,,What a beautiful fantastic amazing hotel. Views are the best ever with pool and Spago views breathtaking. Service was superb and world class. Expensive but worth it.
,,Visit to the sky terrace,4.0,,If you have a head for heights take the lift to the bar area and enjoy spectacular views of Singapore. It’s expensive as you would expect but worth an hour so to soak up the views.
,,Busy place too,5.0,,Beautiful view fun to walk if are not afraid 😱 a high!! I like nighttime will less people and cooler too !!
,,The best way to enjoy the Singapore night skyline,5.0,,"At around SGD 20, Skypark is best way to enjoy the Singapore night skyline. The journey directly to the 56th floor is in itself a nice experience and the view from the top is breathtaking. You can watch both mbs and gardens by the bay shows from here although seeing it directly would be better."
,,More expensive than its worth,3.0,,"We came here for the view of the light show. While very impressive, there is no doubt, the prices are exorbitantly high, even compared to the rest of the Singapore."
,,Evening view,5.0,,"Went to see light show from observation deck this evening was stunning views
Really wish we had done the bar view offer and observation deck in the day
Queues coming down for lift after light show are massive. It’s like everyone wants to leave at same time
But a must while in Singapore"
,,A Wonder of the World.,5.0,,"Wow, this really should be named as a wonder of the world. Amazing panoramic views of Singapore, it’s stunning. We had drinks in the rooftop bar which were understandably pricey, but we expected them to be. It’s a must for anyone visiting this fabulous city."
,,On the infinity pool sky deck with my book: SCRIBBLED FOUR,5.0,,"Enjoying sky deck with quick fiction read at infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands. A read with an expansive, infinite view."
,,Great views,4.0,,"The views are awesome, great to view the Singapore skyline from. To get up to the lounge there is a charge of 22 Singapore dollars. You get this as a credit at the bar.
Great vibe at the lounge with chilled music.
My one issue would be the cocktails got 2 pina colada at a cost of 55 dollars. However they were very poor, and not what I expected."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"What can you say? Such a great view of Singapore. Dissappointed we couldn't see the top in its entirety, but I understand the hotel guests have first priority. Don't miss it!"
,,Better than Expected,5.0,,As woth flyer this too was well worth the money. Save $ if u mention singapore airlines. Huge view deck w two levels glass and cable fencing
,,Great views,4.0,,The iconic marina bay Sands Skypark lives up to its reputation when it comes to the building design. It is mind boggling. To get up to the viewing deck is roughly 20-30 dollars. The view is fantastic and quite worth it. There's also an option to drink and dine at the restaurant up there. You can only access roughly 100m of the 'boat' with the rest shut off for hotel guests only. Which is great for hotel guests but sucks for the public who may want to swim or enjoy the rest of the place.
,,THE place for skyline pictures.,4.0,,A bit pricey if you are taking a family and make sure you don't go to early if you want night pictures since there is no place to sit while you wait for night to fall. The view is stunning.
,,Great View,5.0,,"After watching “Crazy Rich Asians”, we had to visit this place. Here’s hint if you’re planning on visiting the site, pay the a little extra and go to the Ce La Vi Lounge. The price to the Observation Deck was 22 SGD. For just 2 SGD more you get to go to the Ce La Vi Lounge. From the Observation Deck you don’t get to see the swimming pool and there is no shade or seating area. With access to the Ce La Vi Lounge, not only do you get the incredible views of the city, you can take pictures of the swimming pool, sit on the comfortable seats under umbrellas and the price you paid was credited toward the drinks or food purchased at the lounge. This is the place to get an outstanding view of the Singapore skyline."
,,Two shows,5.0,,"We took advantage of the Skybar deal that is $22 for access to skybar and the million dollar view. We went just before sunset found a table and watched the night sky come into view.Pity most drinks are $23 so you had to pay the extra $1 plus tax, or non alchol you can get 2. We arrived about 7. Que only a few people. Light show in front of Marina Bay started at 8. Loved it. Then we moved to the back on same level and watched light show at sky garden at gardens by the bay which started at 845, only 10 or so people there. Fantastic."
,,Another great place to visit whilst in Singapore,4.0,,A Wonder in the engineering world ..... the construction of the SkyPark Observation Deck; nice view from up above
,,Its a must,5.0,,It is a fantastic building with a fantastic view. It is worth to go day and night. Would suggest to visit CELAVI bar for a view with a nice drink. The hall and the shopping centre is impressive.
,,Great experience.,5.0,,The skypark is amazing and the views are incredible. 56 floors up and a marvel of engineering. Cost to access is fairly reasonable and they give a discount if you can prove you flew with SingaporeAir. Not to be missed.
,,An Archectural Icon,4.0,,"A new Icon surrounded by Avant-guard and colonial buildings. This is a huge structure that has to be adventured. There is so much to take in even before going to the top. If you are not a guest, the visit o the top is limited to the viewing area nd he bar. Only guests with room cards can see the pool area. Even though there is so much to see in Singapore, the view from the top is worth the price. Just an outstanding visual art experience."
,,It’s all about the view,3.0,,"Great views of the city and the harbor.

People lined up early along the railing to watch the light show in the garden below.

We had access because we were hotel guests. I am not sure we would have gone up there if we had to pay the fee."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Lovely experience and good restaurant at the top. The view is sectacular. Definitely a must-see... better at night with all lit
,,Excellent views,5.0,,This is a must visit in Singapore and fast evevator takes you on top within a minute. Top deck offers excellent views of singapore skyline
,,iconic and amazing,5.0,,"what's not to like? there is something here for everyone great restaurants like db modern and great theatre, night club great views and bars like Lavo always fun to come here and enjoy drinks, dinner, shopping, views, whatever you want in Singapore it's here"
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"A must when in Singapore, amazing views and a great eating and drinking options. Worth doing both by day and night."
,,Worth it for the view,4.0,,"Having booked our tickets online, we simply alighted at Bayfront MRT and followed the signs to the SkyBar (at the far end of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Lobby). The process to the top of the tower is quick with a green-screen photo shot in between. The views are exceptional with options to buy snacks and drinks too. We ordered the deal that included a Frozen Singapore Sling (there’s not alcohol and an alcohol free version available from the vendor), so we simply visited the cafe kiosk and revived this.
Although we did not go on the Singapore Flyer (Wheel) we’d probably have still preferred the Observation Deck as there’s plenty to see and a little more freedom when it comes to walking around and taking pictures etc.

Great fun for all the family and step-free access available."
,,Fab views...,5.0,,"Well worth a visit! Make sure you pay to go to Ce La Vie, which will cost you $22 and you get a free drink in return at the bar. The observation desk is a different part where there are no bars and no seats and they will still charge you $23. great views round the back as well!"
,,Pretty view but prob not worth the mone,3.0,,U get a nice view around the key marina view but there is an enterance fee. Can consider going to some bars on top where the cost of the enterance to bar can be converted to drinks though u can only see part of the scene but i think largely enough
,,Fun and frenetic!,5.0,,Lots of lovely space to walk around. Great building and architectural features. The sky tree show is fun and lively. I could do it once a week if in town.
,,Walk to Clouds,5.0,,It's an big hight hotel with skyview from the topmost hotel deck of 56th floor. Must keep this at night to see light view of amazing Singapore. Best they served tiger beer at the top n best we had all with fantastic view.
,,Spectacular View!,4.0,,"Arguably the best views over downtown Singapore from the massive cantilevered sky-deck at most dominant and iconic building on the Bay! At approximately £13 per person, it’s not the cheapest attraction, but the view over Singapore is spectacular!"
,,Cool Building in Singapore,4.0,,"Awesome structure, cool view. Shme you cant walk around the entire top as its park of the hotel ($ 500 per night)"
,,To tick the box,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is a huge building - visible for miles it seems. It would seem wrong to visit Singapore without paying a visit to the Skypark.

For what you get, it is expensive - approximately $23 (Singapore) for a ride in a lift and a view to three sides - non-hotel guests are (rightly) unable to access the iconic pool area.

The view is good. But there is limited explanation of what it is you are looking at and there is no seating. We would have liked some detail about the build etc, but the whole experience seems to be about extracting the maximum amount of money for the minimum amount of effort.

Are we glad we did it?

Possibly.

Would we do it again?

Definitely not.

(As an aside, we walked through the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands on the way to the Skypark entrance - the experience was akin to walking through the soulless terminal buildings of a large airport. There is no character at all. The, soon to be guests, were queuing within to be granted the privilege of checking in to an overpriced hotel room.

This is a spectacular building.

Stay elsewhere."
,,Great roof top Great skyline of Singapore city Great location,5.0,,"Skybar is best place to see skyline at night and same time enjoy the views and drinks and good for photos and have memories , their is entrance around $22 Singapore dollars but can redeem for drinks at the rooftop bar and restaurant worthy visit as we had very short time must see place and great crowds no dress code so relax and go leisurely"
,,an amazing experience.,5.0,,"56 floors up, with a night view of the lights of Singapore! Wonderful, even sharing with around 500 other people on the huge deck."
,,Views forever!,4.0,,"Once you find the way thru this amazing place, get to Tower 3 for tickets and the lift to the 57th Floor.

There are 2 types of tickets - one for the Observation deck only and another if you wish to go to the restaurant.

One can have a drink - however there are very few tables in the shade. Once I the bar area one cannot go back to the Observation Deck so take photos first."
,,observation deck,5.0,,"Marina bay sands hotels observation deck . Can visit separately without accessing to the hotel main properties , cost about SGD23 per person .best timing to visit is after 7pm & light show is not to be missed ."
,,Great views but crowded,4.0,,We visited the SkyPark observation deck twice during our recent stay in Singapore. The first time was in the early evening around 6pm and we didn't wait long for the lift to go up but there was a 20 minute wait in line for the lift to come down. We visited again just as it opened on another morning and there were few people about and we got some great photos and did not have to wait for the lifts. The views are great and there is a bar serving refreshments and a small souvenir shop.
,,Speechless,5.0,,We love Singapore and Marina bay Sands is a large part of that reason. The roof is amazing and the best possible view you can get in Singapore!!! Its a must!
,,Infinity and Beyond,5.0,,"MBS MBS .. Marina Bay Sands is like, the must go for any tourist visiting Singapore. Whether it is for the view or simply chilled out ..

Go at night, the view is magnificent.. drinks list is interesting, but I am old school .. so, fancy drinks and cocktails didn’t impress me much.

Music was a bit loud and too many tourist swimmers, so heading to the restroom can be quite messy.

But hey! It’s a must go .. so go for it"
,,360 degree Singapore Island view.,5.0,,"Since we got 2 hours to spent at Marina Bay Sands Skypark , upon arrival at changi Airport Terminal 4 around 9am take a cab straight and get a tickets. Quick and smooth elevator pile-up heads to Skypark. It was a nice sunny day so we got amazing view of the city , islands , seashores and all the surrounding theme parks."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"its worth paying the fee to go up just to see the views , there is also a bar which serves snacks and drinks all be it very expensive , that said you are paying for location!!"
,,Great views.,4.0,,"First let me say we were staying in the hotel so could use the complete area. Reading other reviews I understand if your not a guest you have to pay an entrance fee. This did not stop the massive queue in the lobby to use the Skypark. However, once your there the views are magnificent. Personally I prefered the view during the day, far more to see. The best view at night is the lights in the Gardens by the Bay. Remember, you can walk through these until 2am for free. The bar/restaurant of a night is rammed with customers. The whole area is very safety minded with notices saying please don't lean against the glass. Although this does not stop people trying to get that special photo. If I was not a guest would I pay to go up? Debatable to be honest. You could easy see all you want in 15 mins. We did not use the bar area so can't comment."
,,Very good but not great (apart from the views),4.0,,"I agree, this is a must do option if in Singapore, but it’s quite expensive for what is effectively a ride in a lift with a great view at the end of it.

Yes, there is a restaurant but we didn’t bother as a) it’s very expensive and b) full (of people wanting to be seen).

The views of the city and the gardens by the bay are however wonderful. At most, it’s 45 minutes duration, more like 30 to be fair."
,,Underwhelming but worth going up..,3.0,,"Maybe my expectations were too high but it literally is a ‘no thrills viewing platform’. There’s a restaurant/bar at the top but this was closed when we went and I cannot attest to its opening hours.

It’s worth venturing up to the top for the nice views, and a bonus is it’s a short walk from the shopping centre across the road, but adjust your expectations if you’re expecting more than a observation deck.

Cost was $23 for an adult."
,,Views,4.0,,"We went here in the evening, straight after seeing the massive shiny trees down below. From Tower 1, there is a bar. You buy tickets for the bar which were around $25 each. This is actually $25 towards food or drink. Once you get to the top, it was very busy. Hotel guests only have access to the edge of the viewing area. The bar was packed, food was expensive, but on the way out there is a club which has views of the city. In my opinion the best views are from this club."
,,you want to see singapore??,5.0,,"Then head up to the top and take a look down to be stunned in to awe of the incredible views, especially at night when the lights bring the city to life. Just wow!"
,,Choose your time to visit,4.0,,"The Skypark may be a bit pricey, but what you get is the best panoramic views of the Marina Bay. The view to Gardens By the Bay is fascinating. The sun in the morning may deter you from standing on the deck. Evening and sunset is probably the best time for a visit."
,,Amazing Views over Singapore!!,5.0,,My wife and I went up to the Sky bar. Entry is $22 which is then redeemable for food and drinks At the Sky bar. HIGHLY recommend going at dusk as the view over the city sky line is stunning. Once the sum sets you then get a great view of Gardens by the bay at night.
,,Best views,5.0,,The top of the MBS are probably the best views in Singapore. Be sure to visit both during the day and at night. Great restaurants on the top! A must see!!!
,,Good to see but?,3.0,,OK by Singapore standards but expensive for what it is. Do not advertise enough that you can pay and go to the top but some does not open till 10am. Expensive and a bit disappointing.
,,Great photo op!,4.0,,Must see to get some great views and photos. Sign up for the free Marina Sands Rewards card and get an admission discount.
,,Most Visit,5.0,,"Beautiful but scary but worth it, just go and do it. We had a booking so it was free for us. But you can access it by purchasing ticket also at the hotel reception."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Was really excited about doing this early evening to see Singapore at night - we queued for about half an hour (which apparently is quick) paid $28 each and got our tickets which included a drink. Once you get up there is is extremely restricted as you are not allowed in the guests areas which includes the best views, the pool and a large section of the bar. We were so disappointed we complained and got a refund and a complimentary ticket to return another time but as we were leaving midday the following day we were unable to use. If you just want to see the view you're better off going to the viewing gallery!!!"
,,For views of the city can't be bettered,5.0,,"It isn't cheap, and does get very busy, but really worth the trip up just to get the views of the city and Gardens by the Bay. It's very apparent how 'green' Singapore is, and the hotel is just awsome"
,,Fabulous location,5.0,,Such an amazing skyline with beautiful parks and the amazing gardens by the bay We loved coming here and enjoyed the beautiful marina bay and the surrounding gardens
,,Another must do for me,5.0,,The Skypark was another thing I really wanted to do when I came to Singapore. It was around $23 for the ride up and a frozen cocktail (in a plastic cup but very nice). There was a small queue but we were soon wooshed up in the super quick lift. We went up at dusk so we could enjoy the day and night views which are amazing. We watched the light show at the Gardens in the Bay then went round to the other side to watch the laser show at Marina Bay. I think we were lucky as it was busy but not too much that we couldn't see the views.
,,Panoramic views of the city,5.0,,"You won’t get better views of the city than those from the Skypark, 57 floors up & at least 60 metres higher than the Flyer.

Not a lot to do once up there but take photographs & maybe have a drink or grab an ice cream.

You will have your photo taken & be offered the chance to purchase it in a wallet for $60 or the photo on its own for $30, ours was lovely but it’s too expensive. Once on the deck if you look to your left you’ll see the residents enjoying a cool dip in the infinity pool. (Wasn’t jealous at all)."
,,Different perspective,5.0,,"We did the Skypark in the mid-late afternoon. Thanks to other TA reviewers, we prepared with hats and lots of sunscreen. The area was not to busy when we arrived and there were some really great views from the deck. You are unable to catch the MBS pool in its entirety and the deck does not go all the way around but it gives you unobstructed views of the main sites of Singapore.
I wouldn't say this was a must do, but if you are able to get some great tix prices, then you might as well make it part of your visit."
,,Top of the world,4.0,,We went up because we felt we should. 57 floors above the ground. The view was amazing. We choose to go up in the morning before it got too hot. It is just a big lookout. You can purchase drinks up there but there is no where to sit. There is a seating and restaurant area but it is for hotel guests only. I think everyone should go up there to look down on Singapore. If you show your Singapore airline boarding ticket you will get an entry discount.
,,A must do for cocktails and sunset,5.0,,I had some great cocktails up on the roof. The view is amazing of the bay. If you can book in advance you may bag a seat otherwise you may have to wait sometime to go up. They were playing some great sounds too!
,,Great views a must do,4.0,,Although it will cost you to get up there and if your not a guest you can only go on a small part of the top deck it's worth it. Nice bar up there too but pricey as you would expect.
,,Beautiful views,4.0,,Great panorama across Singapore. Not a lot to do except walk around observation deck to see the city.
,,See all of Singapore,4.0,,Going up to the observation deck is a must. $20 per person but it is something you can say that you have done. Lots of good photos.
,,You have to see it to believe.,5.0,,The experience is just as big as the structure. Especially inviting is the ground floor food court. An amazing collection of everything one would like to eat in Singapore.
,,Amazing views - worth the money,5.0,,"The views up here are amazing and well worth the $25 each. We went up at night to get the views of the lights. It wasn’t too crowded. The lift is super quick and goes directly to level 56. There are 2 bars up there, but the drinks are very expensive we paid $47 for 1 beer & 1 cocktail. You don’t need to buy anything up there though which is good. Would recommend"
,,Breathtaking view!,5.0,,"I timed my visit for 30 minutes before sunset and it was amazing! The view is great during the day, sunset and night, it's one of the best views I've seen. Singapore is truly beautiful! I would highly recommend visiting the Skypark you won't regret it."
,,Sunset and lightshow awesome!,5.0,,Time your arrival for sunset then stay long enoug to see the light show at Marina Bay Gardens and then on the other side the laser show in the Marina. Lovely atmosphere up at the top and a superb view of the city.
,,What a view,4.0,,"Another 'must' for any traveller to Singapore. The structure is a spectacle from the ground and it really is worth a trip up to the sky park to take in those views. It's worth shopping around online for the tickets if you want to save a little money, especially if you're a family, and remember that only hotel guests get access to the pool. There's a bar and a restaurant at the the top though, so you can get refreshments while you take all those selfies. Just a little aside, if you're with anyone who like nice cars, check out the private little car park at the bottom of tower 3, where you access the sky park. Thats where they park all the supercars!"
,,Go to the bar,5.0,,Instead of paying to get to the skypark deck you can pay $22 to get to Ce La Vi bar which has the same views. The money you pay for the ticket is then redeemable at the bar
,,Skypark Bar and Restaurant Disappointing,3.0,,"We wanted to see what all the hype was about and paid the $23pp to get to the skypark lounge. While the view is indeed amazing, it was crowded, dirty, and the service poor. A large seating section was closed off for some reason. Drinks...More"
,,don't miss!,5.0,,Was initially meant to visit during sunset but the weather forecast showed rain so we ended up going first thing in the morning and Im glad we did. There were only 6 or so other people there so managed to get great pictures with no...More
,,"Amazing view, impressive",5.0,,"We did not stay at the hotel, we paid $20 each to access the skypark which you can use as credit at the bar or the restaurant. On a fine day, you get a lovely panoramic view of Singapore. The swimming pool is also very...More"
,,Fabulous views,4.0,,"Expensive considering the very limited access, most of this level is restricted to hotel guests. No shade and only a tiny drinks station. Would have been nice to have a cafe."
,,Stunning Location,5.0,,Number 1 destination! Despite the price of drinks being completely outrageous this place is beyond amazing! The views are beyond compare and a I recommend that you check the time for sunset then arrive 1 hour before that time and settle in to experience the...More
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"The hotel is a landmark, and is worth at least one visit. The views of the city and the ocean are breathtaking. Enjoy a drink at the restaurant or enjoy the stroll around the deck."
,,Evening view not to be missed!,4.0,,We were not quite prepared to pay to stay in the hotel so went for the next best option with buying tickets to the restaurant/bar at the top. You pay 22 dollars to get into ce la vi but can then redeem the ticket on...More
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,The hotel has now become a Singapore landmark and as such is worth a visit. It is a visually impressive hotel both from the outside and inside. Access to the Skypark for non hotel residents is from a separate entrance outside of tower 3. There...More
,,Great Evening Views,5.0,,"A great place to have a sunset Happy Hour on the top deck and enjoy the lights of the city. Enjoy a ""Singapore Sling"" at the bar on the observation deck."
,,"Skypark restaurant, Singapore",5.0,,The view from the top is gorgeous. We had cocktails and appetizers that were delicious. Stayed long enough to watch the sun set and witness the city below at night. The waiter service was excellent and very friendly
,,Amazing experience,4.0,,"The view from the top is simply amazing,,,it may be hot a little bit in the midday..but we choose the evening..night view of the Singapore skyline is awesome,,,"
,,"what a place the visual is fatnastic, you are so high, you see all Singapore,",5.0,,"it is so huge, impressively clean, the shops are great, big brands, the architecture is oustanding, never saw a place like that before must go see; go to the restaurant on top!"
,,Worth visiting especially at dusk,5.0,,"The Skypart observatory is on the 57th floor of the famed Marina Bay Sands. To enter, you need to go to the basement of tower 3 and after ticketing, you are taken in an elevator to the 57th floor.

The observatory offers excellent views of the marina area including the Singapore river, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay on one side and the Gardens by the bay along with the Singapore Flyer on the other. On a clear day, the views are good and offers excellent photo opportunities.

Going there around 40 minutes before sunset allows you to view the Singapore skyline in plenty of light and 20 minutes after sunset, the transformation of the night skyline is remarkable. Waiting till 7:45 allows to see the Light show in Gardens from the top of MBS (Not worth waiting for IMHO)

There is a cafe on top and a resturant in a slightly elevated platform in the center of the observatory. Plan to spend 1 hour (or 1.5 - 2 hours at dusk)"
,,Best views,5.0,,"Take a trip here buy tickets at desk and be early ,gets busy and they do have a kiosk on top. However you are unable to get access to the pool. Brilliant views."
,,Worth it for the view,3.0,,"We walked in the heat to get to the Marina Bay Sands but it was worth it to get the views from this fabulous building. Didn't get to the pool area as we think this is guest only now.
For such a huge building the entry seemed a bit down market.
The views are to die for and it is one of those bucket list places to visit."
,,Outstanding architecture,5.0,,"Incredible building filled with theatres, restaurants, shops,bars etc. The view from viewing ‘ship’ outstanding."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"I was a bit disappointed with my experience at Marina bay sands rooftop bar.

As it’s a popular attraction, it gets very crowded in a small space.. there’s not much character.

The view is amazing but there’s not much glamour.. it’s just lots of tourists taking pictures non stop."
,,Beautiful night views,5.0,,Offers you a near three hundred and sixty degree views around the hotel. Very beautiful especially at night in my opinion!
,,The Singapore high,4.0,,"This place is like any other place in Singapore,as high as it can get, kind of a feel.

Of course,you get to see the whole view of Singapore,when you are there on 56th floor of Marina Bay sands.

There was a roof top restaurant as well,since we came there,we decided to have those very expensive pints of beer.

In all,Marina Bay sands can't be missed,when we talk about Singapore itinerary but I got the same view from flyer or from any sky high building back there."
,,Exceptional view,4.0,,"You can see all of Singapore from here as well as the numerous ships queueing to get into harbour. Massive sea park!!
Note: you can’t get into the restaurant from here so if you want to get a drink book in the hotel not the SkyPark ."
,,Nice,5.0,,Due to the rainy weather we sent the afternoon here and it is quiet a good place to do so! We can also recommand it for families with young children
,,expensive,4.0,,"went to the roof bar so that we could get a look at the pool and views , had 2 drinks and some fries $100nz ouch! but was well worth it for the experience"
,,Great View of Singapore,5.0,,"We visited on April 26, 2019 and ended up paying $22 USD per person to visit their lounge. The ticket price was applied to our order of beer and wine. The view is spectacular! The lounge is one floor higher than the observation deck which has a separate entrance ticket."
,,One of the must visit place,5.0,,"One of the must visit place in Singapore, best time to visit is around 6:30 pm when sun starts to set, one can see Singapore in day light and slowly colour of sky starts changing and then night view is amazing ... if you have more time then you can also see light and sound show"
,,Wow!!!!,5.0,,"This was absolutely amazing! Standing 56 storeys high with stunning views, this skypark had it all. Make sure when you go do it around the 6pm mark. That way you can capture the views during the day but also at night. It was stunning and a must for Singapore."
,,Views,5.0,,Ticket only or in residence your allowed up their ..tickets only allow skypark.no access to restaurant or pool area..lift takes you to floor 56. Again accessible
,,Just Do It - even if it is very crowded,5.0,,"What can I say? Yes, many others had been here, Yes, the drinks are not cheap, Yes, it is posh and overdone, BUT you would regret it if you haven't been at the roof top. The view is amazing. During the week casual is working. Register at the lobby."
,,Great cocktails,4.0,,"We finally found the time to go up to the Marina Bay Sands Ce LaVi bar, but it was our bad luck that that the weather was bad. Thunderstorms prevented us from sitting outside and the view was also restricted due to the weather. Great cocktails (we both a a Singapore Sling). Total cost was around $56 for two people."
,,Coolest spot in city for drinks or lunch!,5.0,,"Though pricy you can pay the fee to go up top on the 57th floor and catch a great view or have a few drinks and get the fee credited towards the drinks! We had lunch also! Well worth it for a life time adventure! Not as expensive or as good as the Jules Verne room in the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but still worth it!"
,,worth a visit,4.0,,"Just a thing to do while in Singapore although you should be made aware of the guidelines in place for visitors. The majority of the observation (highest) level - including the pool - are only available for use by hotel guests. The bar area and general deck are available for all others. There is a small price difference between going to the bar and receiving an included wine/sparkling - and hoping you get a seat - and just standing/walking on the deck.

There isnt that much more you can see from here than you can the Singapore Flyer."
,,Reach the sky,4.0,,It was a bit disappointing getting to the top and then not being allowed to use the restaurant to get refreshments. This must be done before taking the lift and then to order a meal. The view is stunning from so high up.
,,Marina Skypark,4.0,,"We went up there and were a bit disappointed with the limited viewing there. We were limited to one little end of the area. It is an incredible building there is no doubt about that, but I would not like to stay there. The ground floor looked worse then a busy railway station."
,,Stand outs of the world,5.0,,"The entire property, the way it is built is just marvelous. One cannot stop but adore the brilliant work and effort that has been put in to build this structure. It is one of the must sees while in Singapore. Definitely a stand out structure in Asia, if not the world."
,,Going Back,5.0,,I love this hotel and all it's associated spaces. It's an architectural marvel. The infinity pool and eateries were lovely. Two little suggestions would be a bigger food hall with different options and different shops - not just the high end ones.
,,👍👍👍,5.0,,👍👍👍 to the architect of this wonderful hotel. One can easily get lost in the mall. Be sure to have a guide when going to the Skypark.
,,A Must See -- nothing like this,5.0,,"57 Floors in the air and the view to die for. Just amazing and worth the lines and price to go up to view. Day time, night time, both are great and its the best picture taking place! Don't miss this!"
,,A must do whilst in Singapore,5.0,,This is amust see & do whilst in Singapore. It costs SGD$23 to visit but can be redeemed against beverages or food. The views are stunning & so is the atmosphere.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"You must go up to the observation deck here. Views of Singapore are amazing from the observation deck and the ""ship"" is just a stunning spectacle from Marina Bay. A truly iconic symbol."
,,"On top of the world, or Singapore at least...",4.0,,"When in Singapore, there are certain things you have to do, the Long Bar at Raffles hotel is one, and a trip to the top of this iconic hotel must the one of the others.
My wife and I went up on a clear and bright Sunday morning recently, and enjoyed the stupendous views, and we'll go again when we're next in this neck of the woods.
It's not entirely clear when you exit the high speed lift precisely which areas are open to day visitors, and at a cost of S$40 for two it isn't cheap (but there again, nothing in Singapore is!) so for those reasons it's 4* not 5 from me.
Recommended for a quick overview of this fascinating city."
,,Awesome views,5.0,,The views are definitely worth it - you really can see so much of the city in quite clear detail. Great fun.
,,Views of Singapore,3.0,,"Amazing views of Singapore and the surrounding Straits on our first full day in Singapore. Due to the heat we only spent about 10mins up there at a cost of just over $100 (4 adults and one child). A shame we couldn’t show the children the infinity pool although we all knew that before venturing to the 56th floor.

Only scored an AVERAGE due to the value for money. Should have been closer to $70-80 for the family."
,,What a view,5.0,,We were prepared to pay to go to the sky park and go to the roof bar for a drink. When we went to buy the ticket the lady said if we were going to the bar we needn’t pay. The view is fantastic. We had to wait to get a table with a view but so worth it. Drinks pricey but as we were prepared to pay to go up we didn’t mind. Must go if in Singapore
,,Overrated,3.0,,If you are thinking of going become a member of the sands mall and the entrance is free.... the service at the bar was average nothing to write home about
,,Stunning,5.0,,We visited at around 6pm and stayed till 8.30pm .So got to see Singapore in both daylight and nightlight. Both views have their own charm and absolutely stunning.
,,Stunning Views of Singapore,5.0,,"The SkyPark Observation deck is on the 59th floor where a lift takes you up in a very smooth ride. Once up, the view is amazing. You walk around the building, have a wine/coffee and drink in the view. There are information areas telling you what each building is. Its a must do in Singapore"
,,Holiday,5.0,,It's a beautiful place gain full of entertainment and lots of big brand shop. Restaurants are good around . The best thing is the water show its really beautiful and entertaining. We enjoy it .Its start in the evening we were there for the 21hr00 PM show which was an absolute beauty
,,Great views,4.0,,"We visited at 9.00pm so that we could see Gardens by the Bay all lit up. The skypark, in my opinion, is a better and cheaper alternative to the nearby Singapore Flyer, for offering views of the Singapore skyline. It was a pity our ticket didn't allow for us to enjoy the bar facilities, but there was a counter for light refreshments."
,,Great view,4.0,,The view from the top of this spectacular building is superb.23 dollars is a little steep but worth doing. The Singapore Sling at the bar is basically a slush puppie. However the photos that they take and try to sell you are extortionate. Staff very good.
,,Astonishing place,4.0,,"The room was fantastic as were the views and the staff. Very shiny and sparkling. I'm really pleased we stayed there for a couple of nights but won't be visiting again because it was sparkly rather than inviting. There were no chairs on the top deck other than sun loungers, no lounge, and 3 restaurants out of 4 had pounding disco playing both evenings we stayed. The place was fabulous - can't fault the rooms, staff or quality - and it was worth getting that 'selfie' in the infinity pool as everyone else was, but the lack of chilled space and the relentless music put us off. It was personal taste in other words. The good side is that you are next to the Marina Bay area so can easily visit the wonderful domes that are a few minutes walk away."
,,Meh......,3.0,,"Got tickets on one of the rainiest days this year, so be careful when you buy tickets!
The entrance is in Tower 3 the very top end of Marina Bay......and it has its own entrance, you go down the escalators, you will be told off if you try any other way in.
PS I was also told just go up to Cest La Vi for a drink - I think I would recommend that.
The view is pretty much as you expect......a view, different people different values, I think a G&T in hand looking out of a bar window would be better."
,,Worth the wait,5.0,,"Was a bit of a queue to go up at night time. It was also a public holiday when we went ( on holidays and forgot it was long weekend )
The view is awesome and the city night lights are fantastic.
A different view of Singapore."
,,The best view in town,5.0,,"You'll have to pay for this view, but it's well worth it if you are not afraid of heights. On the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel you'll have a 360 degree view encompassing the bay, gardens and city, Singapore Flyer and more. You don't get to go to the top floor - where the famous infinity pool is (that's for hotel guests only) but this is pretty good and you can stay as long as you like.... food and drink available at certain times of the day."
,,Spectacular views over the bay.,5.0,,"The Skypark has the best views of the bay and is worth a visit. You can however go up to one of the bars or restaurants for a drink and get the same view for the price of a drink. Win, win!"
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore,5.0,,"It's a must see in Singapore! There is a bar with drinks and snacks. You can not visit the famous pool, but you can see it and share the wonderful city view!"
,,Incredible views!!!,5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed our time in the Marina Bay sky park. As guests of the hotel access to this space was included with our package. Swimming in the rooftop top pool was a bucket list item and thoroughly enjoyable. The views from all angles are captivating.
,,Great Views,3.0,,"Good to experience and get a different perspective of Singapore. After a fast lift ride, you enter the large open viewing area with spectacular views, there is a bar/cafe/restaurant up top which was reasonably busy but there were seats available at the time of our visit there are a number of information boards dotted around the viewing area to point out items of interest etc. In my opinion, something to do once, probably wouldn't do it again, very much a case of seen that, done it."
,,Late Afternoon Visit,4.0,,"We bought our tickets at the kiosk at the entrance and went right on up. It was a cloudy day, but we could still see the city. I'm sure it's pretty at night as well, we went late afternoon. Not too many people were around during that time."
,,Best View from the top,5.0,,"A visit to Celavi for a drink with music and a view from the top is really fascinating. You get to see the surrounding various attractions like the Singapore Flyer, Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, And the beautiful Skypark."
,,Beautiful scenery from the top,5.0,,This is one of the highest place where you can nearly the whole of Singapore. Best time to visit is towards the evening and night where you can see Singapore at night. The view of the Garden by the Bay was spectacular and you can see the CBD and even Merlion. We were there during Chinese New Year and we even have the chance to see fireworks from the top. Worth visiting
,,Breath taking,5.0,,You just have to go there - make sure you have your past port with you if you if want to try out the casino. The view from the top has a bar you can sit and enjoy the view. Loved It.
,,Great experience. A must do in Singapore.,5.0,,"If nothing else this is a “I’ve been up there” experience whenever you see the iconic building in media etc.

I went up on my own so didn’t feel it was too expensive but I appreciate it starts getting pricey if whole family go.

Not too busy despite going at sunset time and no long queues for lifts in either direction.

Great views as you’d expect and hoot to get another perspective on the various light shows. I saw the Supergrove Trees show and the Spectra show whilst up there. Great to look down on Singapore Flyer too.

Availability of simple snacks and drinks too.

Definitely glad I went up."
,,Fantastic views from the observation deck,4.0,,It is worth going up the Marina Bay Sands just for the views of Singapore - unfortunately you can't sit and have a coffee unless you pay extra to enter the restaurant. There is a kiosk selling take away drinks and ice cream though. Fantastic looking iconic piece of architecture that you can see from many places in Singapore - definitely pay a visit.
,,Walking by the Marina,5.0,,Visiting Singapore is not complete without strolling around the Merlion park and the quay. Lots of coffees restaurants and bars are within reach of the MRT. Enjoy the night lights spectacular show
,,Birds eye view of the marina bay and gardens by the bay,4.0,,Enjoyed a lovely sundown. Saw the Lights show of the gardens by the bay as well as the MBS. Good to chill out at the bar ce la vi. Though not the cheapest place for a visit but I feel it’s worth it for a night out.
,,It's a must see,4.0,,"If you are in town for a day of 1 week, it's a must see hotel one must visit. It;s the new icon of being in Singapore besides the merlion park and Sentosa.
Go up to the Sky park to have a panoramic visit of the city and the Gardens by the Bay"
,,Visit only if you have super extra time,4.0,,Scenic views similar to Singapore Flyer but is quite crowded. Definitely reserve evening time to visit if you are visiting. No magic views though. Do not buy the pictures sold at counter - not worth it.
,,Good views on a clear day,3.0,,"Ticket price is about $23 per person Expect queue to buy tickets as well as to get in to lift Photo booth in my opinion is an irritant Go up 56 floors and can go around the sky park looking at gardens by the bay, Marina bay etc. There are boards indicating directions of attractions etc. Best time to get in is before sun set and stay on till lights take over. There is a restaurant but entry is restricted to hotel guests only. You can get a glimpse of the infinity pool on top of the tower 2 You can buy coffee/beer etc and hang around. There is no seating and they sell tickets even when there are showers but will ask you if you would still like to go visit. When wet extremely difficult to hang around as you can't even sit on the floor. Provides lots of photo opportunities. All my comments are based on several visits and the last visit being in Jan 19 on a wet day"
,,Best city night view ever,5.0,,We visited here in the evening which I think is best to take in the view of Singapore from the 56th floor and see the light show at the base of the building and also another light show of Gardens by the Bay which happens at around 9pm. Difficult to find as you have to go to the third tower an access via a small lift on the exterior of the building. The best night view of any city I have ever seen too date. The bar area at the top seems to be restricted to hotel guests but I have heard you can buy a drink for $20+ singapore.
,,Best infinity pool on the planet,4.0,,"From a distance it’s a spectacular building but the photo from the pool looking back across the city is the front cover of your album. Wolfgang puck is the restaurant up top but they do poolside service for a reasonable price. The pool is pleasantly refreshing.
Pool cleaning starts at 1530 but it’s actually a series of pools so you can move ahead of the cleaners."
,,Observatory,5.0,,"We visited the observatory at Marina Bay Sands Resort tower 3. The view of the city is amazing at sunset. The different looks of the city at sunset and night view is amazing. As soon as the sunsets, the city lights come on and it looks like a different city. The sky line view at night is so beautiful! Visitors must experience this."
,,Stopover visit,5.0,,Amazing view from the skypad. Reasonably priced just to go up to view and linger as long as you liked. What a great way to see the whole of Singapore.
,,Eat at Spago for the same View and Much more special than Skypark entrance,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a VERY busy place. It is very hard to escape the crowds up on the rooftop level. The hotel pool is crowded with everyone taking selfies. This is not an enjoyable experience.

Instead of paying for the Skypark entrance there are other options at Spago Restaurant and/or bar. This restaurant has an informal bar/food area which enjoys the same view or as we did, we ate at the more special Spago restaurant and LOVED IT."
,,Not to be missed,4.0,,"What a view over the City and especially the Bay Gardens. We thought we couldn't visit Singapore without going to the top of this iconic hotel, although you are separated from the main hotel, and we were not disappointed by the views. We bought our tickets at the tower for £11.20 each, which we felt was quite reasonable. Be careful at the viewing platform as if you go into the cafe you are not allowed back."
,,Excellent Views,4.0,,Is it worth it - yes. Is it a little over priced for what it is - yes. The views are spectacular and if you do this you really don't need to do the Singapore Flyer in terms of getting great views.
,,Sin Trip,4.0,,Awsome views. SGD 23.00 for the privilege to catch a lift to the top. Note you will not see the infinity pool unless your a guest. Not a 360 degree view but still Awsome . Level 33 apparently has 360 degree views and is higher than the skylark. Didn’t get a chance to go there.
,,Incredible views from the Skypark,5.0,,"We bought discounted tickets through Klook (about $15), also allowed us to skip the ticket line and just show a mobile code. We visited about 30 minutes before sunset and had a great view watching the city lights come on, plus we were able to stake out a spot for the light show. The city skyline is spectacular from this vantage point, also the Gardens light show. It can get crowded and the rooftop restaurant/bar is a bit pricy."
,,The view of a lifetime!,5.0,,"We had seen this amazing highrise hotel, resort, & park under construction & had anticipated a visit for 11 years! It was worth it. Drank the most expensive cocktail we've ever paid for, but enjoying it with the incredible view of Singapore Bay made it all worthwhile."
,,Not that expensive if you think about the service and quality people around!,5.0,,"If you have the possibility just go and check this amazing place in Singapore, service and hospitality is high level here."
,,Excellent experience,4.0,,This is one of the best place to visit in Singapore. Wonderful sightseeing of Singapore city & excellent beach experience
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Purchase the tickets at Level 1 @ Tower 3. $22/person. Took the lift up to 56 floors. Exit the lift there is a small open area for picture taking before going into the restaurant. It was a week day and the crowd was small. Able to get a seat right by the window. Order some drinks and snacks and was able to use the ticket price as credit for the bill. The view was fantastic. We also can see the pool and the hotel guest taking their swim. Spent about an hour and a half up there and took lots of pictures. Great trip.
,,Amazing place and views,5.0,,"You can go up to the restaurant area on 57th floor and enjoy views over Singapore. Entry fee about 22$S each, but you can put this towards drinks, cocktails and food.would definitely recommend."
,,Fabulous views.,5.0,,"Whilst not cheap to visit, the fee was worth it for the view. It was a clear bright day and we could see for miles.

You can also see into the Marina bay Sands pool and see just how crowded it gets! It was so busy; fantastic pool views but very busy."
,,Decent Views of Singapore,4.0,,Pricey but worth going up to check out at sunset. Expensive drinks at Ce La Vi. Can no longer access the pool but u can take pics from one of the platforms if you have a drink at Ce La Vi.
,,Fun for the View and a Beverage!,5.0,,"This is the quintessential Singapore experience in my opinion--the view is priceless and it just has to be done, even if it's super expensive. Two beers and a plate of fries was about $30 USD. Still worth it!"
,,To recommend (but choose your time of visit carefully!),5.0,,"Went up on Tuesday around lunchtime. Persons waiting for tickets: 0. People waiting for lift: 0. People on the deck upstairs (56 and 57 floor): ca 20. View: excellent. From 57th floor you can watch, the world´s largest pool, how crowded it is...

20 min upstairs, to take some pix and then straight down. Without waiting, of course... :-)

For 23 dolars: yes, nice activity...

Recommendation: Museum by the hotel is a must see!"
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"As a hotel guest we can visit the sky park for free . we visited it twice at day and night , amazing views at Gardens by the bay and also at the Marina , I advice to visit it at the sunset to see views at day and night"
,,Great visit,5.0,,So quick to get up to the top in the lift - it was a shame it was so smoggy as we didn't see much when we got there but had a yummy cocktail!!!
,,Iconic,4.0,,"5 star hotel but apart from the iconic roof top pool this hotel was not as good as the other luxury hotels here in terms of service, layout, staff and it is considerably more expensive. But only hotel guests can use the pool which was very good, especially when it rained and everybody else left the pool so we had it to ourselves. There is a large amount of seating up there too, a lot shaded by the trees."
,,360 Views of Singapore,5.0,,It was amazing at the skypark observation deck. I always visit observation decks especially those that are open. One they provide you a great view and two you can feel the fresh air. We spent 2-3 hours there so I would say definitely worth a visit.
,,Impressive views but crowded,4.0,,"The area you can access is a bit limited, especially on the side overlooking the gardens and if you go up to the cocktail bar, you are not allowed to return to the viewing deck. The bar was crowded and there was not enough seating, lots of people annoyingly holding seats for other people. However it is lovely to see the views and feel the breeze,and walking through the main hotel lobby area to get to the access was amazing."
,,Great views,4.0,,The views are amazing of Singapore from up here. Quick and easy ticket purchase. With the $23 for the photos!
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"It certainly worth going up for the view at night time, brrilliant trip. Our trip included lasre light show which was breathtaking. The sands skypark with superfast lift to 56 floor, the view at night all lit up is amazing site, not to be missed. we were not allowed to the pool side. We had a river cruise as well after skypark, not to be missed."
,,Outstanding Views of Singapore,5.0,,"Absolutely outstanding views across Singapore at night, great bar also at the top where we enjoyed a drink looking out onto the city, a definite experience when visiting Singapore."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Great place, with great views, it is amazing, I would say this is the best of the best at Singapore."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,I was fortunate enough to b staying at Marina Bay Sands so didn’t have to pay to go up. But it’s a must do experience for any traveler to Singapore
,,Beautiful views,3.0,,"Very impressive building and views on top are amazing. Is expensive to get to the top and does not include any drinks. Staff could be more friendly and approachable, not very helpful. Managed to get a seat and ordered a singapore sling (most expensive had so far) which was too sweet for my taste, had better but when in Rome. The infinity pool looked lovely but consisted of lots of people just taking selfies. The views really are stunning so is worth a visit on a trip to singapore just for the views alone."
,,Skypark,5.0,,the building is amazing. We loved the view from the top. the food at the bar was just delicious. the water and laser show at night is just beautiful.
,,Fantastic views over Singapore,4.0,,Certainly worth a visit. A super fast elevator will take you up to the 56th floor. It almost feels like you are on the deck of a ship but up in the clouds. There are amazing views of Singapore and you'll get some great selfies.
,,Touch the SKY,5.0,,"Is one thing you have to do while in Singapore. This is the kind of place you put in your bucket list as “must see“.
The views where amazing, we went in at 6:30 pm, so we enjoyed of the sunset and night views when whole city glows.
I honestly think, the sunset, is the best time of the day to go."
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,Visited here in the evening....amazing views from the 57th floor....lots of seating areas for food and drinks..which were reasonably priced considering where we were...the light show was also on while we were there ...great atmosphere
,,On top of the world!,5.0,,"WOW! what a view! we ventured up to the observation deck and your breath is taken away as soon as you exit the lift (that only takes about 30 seconds to get all the way up there!!!)
the observation deck is a separate area for visitors and doe NOT allow you access to the sky park or the infinity pool where all of the hotel guests are, but you do get to to enjoy a drink a the bar and views that go on forever! the observation deck is at the rounded end of the surfboard shaped platform that sits atop of the 3 towers and you have ample room to see the views from the city side, the very tip and then the other side that looks down on the Gardens by the Bay. absolutely spectacular!
I would also recommend you check out all of the high performance cars at the entrance to tower 3 where you can drool over Lamborghinis and the like, or if your wallet permits - you can take one for a spin! you can also walk all the way through the bottom level of the 3 towers and it sure is some amazing feats of modern engineering! absolutely amazing! you can also take the lift up to the bridge and walk over to the Gardens by the Bay. make sure you take your phone charger because you will be taking a HEAP of photos!"
,,This is a great way to spend an hour or two.,5.0,,"This is the best way to see Singapore. There is a food court in the shopping centre if you need that has many good quality vendors.
To get there take the MRT and get off at Bayfront station not Marina Bay as we did as this is a fair walk in the Singapore heat from Marina Bay."
,,Good view to see the city,5.0,,"The skypark on top of the hotel provides a good view of the city. They have a restaurant and a bar for people, who want to go to the skypark."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"This is the best location to get amazing views of Singapore, a must visit whilst in the country. Prices are fair too."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Great place to see the wonderful illuminations , can be a bit crowded. Tickets are quite expensive although we asked for the concession prices we ended up being charged for the child price 17 SGD"
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,"A must go visit so you can see the beauty of this city from the 57th floor. The port, marina bay gardens, financial district, etc Free entrance if staying at the hotel Marina Sands"
,,SG iconic landmark...,5.0,,The Skypark’s main entrance is located on Tower 3. Ride a state of the art express lift to 57th floor. You can see all of Singapore’s major attractions from above. It’s worth a visit.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,It is quite a reasonable charge to visit the skypark but it is worth it as the views are great.We had purchased the tickets in our hotel and it was slightly cheaper than at the ticket office.There is a restaurant at the top however menu is limited and expensive. You can see the hotel swimming pool from the skypark which was good.Worth the visit
,,Sky park singapore,4.0,,"Most impressive must see place
There are two ways of visiting the top deck here
First way is to pay to go on the observation deck. For your money you will be able to traverse the whole sky park and have great access to get photos and admire all of the surroundings
The second way is to pay your money to visit the sky bar. The advantage here is that your fee becomes a bar credit. So in effect all you have done is prepaid for a round of cocktails and your sky visit is free!
Downside is roaming space is much more limited than the observation deck and the bar does tend to populated by wannabes which you may find slightly annoying.either way is a winner really. Just in different ways"
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,"You can see the whole layout of Gardens by the Bay from up here - as well as a fantastic view of the surrounding areas.

There is a very nice bar and restaurant here too - although it is not cheap - it’s worth it to just sit there and take in the surroundings.

Just one little tip....on your way up you will be asked if you want your photo taken against a green screen - they will superimpose a stunning background onto it. However, they will I try to sell you a package of goods costing 80 Singapore dollars. They don’t actually tell you upfront that if you just want the photo it’s 30 Singapore dollars."
,,You don't want to miss this! Unique Experience.,5.0,,"When we hopped off the bus, it was not clear where the entrance was, but we persisted and found it. Huge hotel! At the back of the lobby is the ticket booth - you buy a ticket to go to the Skypark, 57th floor, but the amount of the ticket is deducted from what you choose to drink and/or eat. When we returned to the lobby, a show was being set up so we waited to see it - first a band, then acrobats in lion suits jumped around some high poles - celebrating Lunar New Year - much fun."
,,This is why Marina Bay Sands Hotel is World-Famous!,5.0,,"The MBS Skypark includes the World-famous 150 metre disappearing edge pool (actually, three pools linked in series), and the cantilever observation deck. A great location to swim, or just soak up the sun, as well as getting amazing sunrise and sunset photos over the bay, with the added feature of having a top-down viewing position to film the colour-changing Supertrees in the Grove after dusk. Access is limited to those staying in the Hotel though via a sophisticated card-scan system."
,,Great view of Singapore!,5.0,,While in Singapore the Sands Skypark is a must. Here's a tip for you. Its $20 (Singapore money) to go up to the Skypark. But better idea is to go to the restaurant above the walk. They will give you a voucher os $22 to eat there which make the Skypark free. Its above the Skypark walk which gives eve a better viewing area. So get lunch and view for a better deal.
,,"Amazing views, disappointing experience",3.0,,"Beyond doubt the views from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel are spectacular. A superb vista of the city and environs must be high on the to do list for visitors to Singapore.

But ...

We purchased the Sling option with our ascent price. Having experienced the real gin thing (at an eye watering price) in the Raffles Long Bar the day before, receiving a frozen pink sludge in a plastic cup atop the tower did not do justice to the location.

We could have purchased an expensive meal in the roof top restaurant and bar, but we chose not to do that. With hindsight, that would have been the better memory.

As it was then, a brain freezing sludge, no seats, no view of the infinity pool - a cheap experience for no small price.

Still, those views ..."
,,A must see and do!,5.0,,"One of the most amazing sky parks in the world...Great views, very clean, nice restaurants and bars and a spectacular pool with three sections (family, adults, and kids)"
,,A must of the Singapore visit list,4.0,,The views are exceptional (bit too high for my liking) but it is a must when you visit Singapore and it is worth it. A nice snack and a glass of bubbly in the bar made the visit even better.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"We purchased our tickets online before we left the UK, directly from the hotel, and included the option to have a frozen Singapore sling. When the tickets were emailed, there was a time on them of 9.30am. I was slightly concerned as during the booking process it had not asked for you to specify a time to visit. As it turns out, that is the time the Skypark opens. You are free to visit anytime you choose. We decided to visit the Skypark after dark. There was very little queuing time to get in the lift to go up. Once up there the views across Singapore were stunning. Its worth noting that only the front end of the skypark is open to the public. The rest is closed off and is only accessible to hotel guests. The frozen Singapore Sling is collected from the Ce La Vie Kiosk up on the Skypark."
,,Great views of the City.,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel has become iconic in Singapore, and has a bonus in offering a trip to the top - level 57 - (for a price) to view the city from a height. There is no doubt that it is worthy it. My only disappointment was that the viewing area is restricted to just one end of the ‘boat’ on top of the 3 towers.
Expect quite a hustle from the people running the photo kiosk."
,,Did not disappoint,4.0,,I've always wanted to have a look at the Marina Bay Sands. What an amazing place. Expensive but to be expected. Only disappointment was that you can't get to the edges to have a proper look at the city unless you are a resident at the hotel.
,,Spectacular Hotel in a prime location,5.0,,This 5-star hotel easily lives up to its billing as a spectacular hotel with a jaw-dropping infinity pool on the roof. This is a very large hotel with loads of restaurants and a very large shopping center attached to the hotel. The location is close to the Singapore domed gardens and in easy walking distance to the business district. I would happily return to this venue for a repeat trip.
,,"Staggering building, terrific views from skypark.",5.0,,"Don't miss this, The hotel and gardens are an architectural marvel, the views from the top are a real one off. If you have a head for heights."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"Just go to 57th floor and have a beer or coffee or, if money is no object have a meal, the views are absolutely amazing. It's worth the effort."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Going up to the Skypark is absolutely worth the visit. You get amazing views of Singapore, but of the gardens and bay. Visit it during the day and again at night. It is two totally different experiences."
,,A ‘must do’ in Singapore!,5.0,,"The day was a bit hazy but we went up as it’s something I definitely wanted to do on this trip. The inside of the hotel is stunning, the design is beautiful. We went up to the 56th floor to the viewing deck, you hardly knew you were moving in the lift it was so smooth. We bought the ticket with the Singapore sling included, it was certainly welcome as it was very hot and humid that day.

The view as you’d imagine is incredible. You can see the top on the 57th floor where the infinity swimming pool is and garden, quite rightly , it is for hotel residents only, I’ll definitely stay there one day! It was a lovely experience."
,,Marina Bay Sands SkyPark,5.0,,Really worth paying a visit. You will get to experience a stunning bird's eye view of the Singapore skyline. This is definitely an amazing experience not to be missed.
,,Great Views!,5.0,,"If you don't have the SGD $500+ dollars for a night stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel then visit the Marina Bay Sands Skypark for $23 per adult instead!

You can't swim in the world famous infinity pool but you can see it!
You don't get to spend the night at the hotel but you do get to experience all the incredible views that MBS has to offer from the 57th floor of a boat sat on top of three buildings.

Much better value than the Singapore Flyer and you get better views! It is a landmark, incredibly special building and I think it has to form part of a trip to Singapore as it is such an icon now. We went during the day, it is very hot up there when the sun is out, there isn't much shade and you're not allowed to sit on the sky deck."
,,Definite must,5.0,,"Breath taking views and if you have seen the movie ""Crazy Rich Asians"" this is a definite stop you will enjoy and will be able to identify significant scenes from the roof top vantage point."
,,Landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"One of the most extravagant structures and landmark of Singapore. The observation deck on 57th Floor is amazing which gives a wonderful view of the city. This landmark of Singapore accommodates hotel in all three wings, restaurants, Mall, etc. This is a must visit place which is conveniently connected by metro train station and buses."
,,Must do,5.0,,Great views. Luckily hardly any queue so fast entrance. Walked around the terrace although my wife was initially a bit apprehensive. She soon perked up. This was last sight on our itinerary before return to hotel and then flight home
,,Amazing View that never gets old,3.0,,"Amazing views, decent drinks. Well worth the visit, but the three stars is because it gets very crowded and difficult to find a good vantage point to enjoy the skyline views. If you’re patient you’ll find a spot to snap a few pictures. Recommend going after dark!"
,,Fabulous View - over crowded at night.,4.0,,"Along with far too many others we visited the Skypark to watch the evening light shows at the nearby Gardens by the Bay. We had a local guide to help us but my wife and I struggled with the number of people around. We enjoyed the experience mainly due to our guide, whose knowledge and experience added to the trip - he suggested leaving a little earlier than most would think, to avoid the long lines. We did this and did not feel like we missed anything. The official photograph was reasonably priced at sin$25."
,,Superb,4.0,,"Was a great view. You can watch the Spectra Water Show from the top. Especially, in the evening you can enjoy a good view of Singapore‘s skyline"
,,A bit pricey but a good view!,4.0,,"As i said in the title it was a bit pricey but the view was great and it was very clean and tidy! the only downfall is the queue to get down as there is only 2 elevators in operation for both going down and coming up, but it wasnt too bad of a wait as you can still see the views and it didnt take too long. Staff were really friendly as well."
,,A must when in Singapore,5.0,,"What an experience! $23 to go to the observatory deck or $22 to go to the Ce La Vi bar and get the entry fee back in a drink or food. $22 paid and you have fabulous views of the infinity pool, a cocktail from the bar and ultimate views of Singapore. Loved it"
,,Great views,5.0,,"My wife and I recently visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, visiting the roof you have excellent views of the city,well worth a visit."
,,A Must,5.0,,We checked-in overnight at Marina Bay Sands so we freely roamed their Infinity Pool and the Skypark. We went there morning and it's so hot and so bright. Best time to visit the skypark is at night where you can see the lights of Singapore.
,,Spectacular View of the Bay and Downtown,5.0,,This unique structure perched atop the three towers of Marina Bay Sands was very interesting. The observation deck open to. the public affords 360 degree views. Had to try a Singapore Sling at the deck bar as it was my birthday !
,,What a view,5.0,,A must see during the night. The views are spectacular. Did not go during the day. Would highly recommend.
,,Worth the price-- great view!,4.0,,"We bought tickets in advance to go up to the skypark at night. View is amazing, especially after the Gardens by the bay is all lit up and all of the other beautiful buildings. You can go to the bar while there, but can't go BACK out on the skypark deck onoce you are in the bar. This does not include any access to the infinity pool either since it is for guests of the hotel. Definitely worth going for the lovely view at night!"
,,Breath taking,5.0,,It is such breathtaking views and feeling on top of the world that makes you never want to.leave. day time and evenung time present contrasting feel n views.
,,What a view,5.0,,"Oh Wow, this place is magnificent. From here you can feel that you have Singapore in the palms of your hands.

Located on the 57th floor of the 3rd tower at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, here you can enjoy the view while you take amazing pictures and even get some snacks or drinks at their bar.

The entrance fee is waived if you are a guest of the hotel and the organization was fabulous great service!"
,,View plus ...,3.0,,"On our recent stopover in Singapore, we dined at Skypark for dinner. The swift lift got us to the 57th floor intact with our ears popping!
The view is wonderful with a 180 degree view of Singapore and there is inside and outside dining. The food was good but not great as it is purely a tourist destination rather than serious dining. Having said this, we had a good night, but it did come at a price and that is why I wish the food had been of a higher standard. I was the only vegetarian and they definitely did not have much to offer me - the others were satisfied by was not memorable. You can go to the Marina Bay Sands just to see the view without dining at Skypark, but for something different, and you do not mind paying, then Skypark is OK to try."
,,Marina Bay Sands,3.0,,"We were guests in the hotel so could access the pool and observation deck. Great for the view. The service in all these areas is very poor and very expensive.
The pool is ok but even early in morning was pretty busy. It is not big enough for the number of guests.
It’s all about life styles of the rich and famous or those wanting to be seen."
,,Top of Singapore,4.0,,A pleasant place to visit in you’re in Singapore. You’ll be able to see Singapore from a birds eye view. However last I heard the sky park is now only accessible for hotel guest. You may want to check before deciding to go there.
,,Major Disappointment,2.0,,"It was recommended that we go up to the Skypark for the views and one way to do so was to have lunch at Spago. Forget that because there is construction and the view of the city from Spago is currently blocked. If you are staying at the hotel, you can access the pool on the rooftop and that might provide the view we were looking for."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"The Sands SkyPark is also home to the world’s largest public cantilever housing a public observatory deck, lush gardens, exclusive restaurants and a stunning 150 m (492 ft) infinity-edged pool to complete the luxurious experience.It is in the 57 floor in Marina Bay Sand third Tower. We were stayed in Marina Bay Sand hotel and we Enjoyed in the wonderful view of the city from the pool. The park was normal."
,,Marina bay skypark,4.0,,Visited and was well worth the views. The tickets can be automatically printed at a machine and accept credit cards. The Singapore sling ia a slush puppy drink which is not too bad. You cant sit down once at the viewing platform.
,,Best place to view Singapore,5.0,,This is the best place to view the whole of Singapore. I really enjoyed my time there with my family. I will recommend this place to any tourist.
,,Great view and nice place to get a perspective of the city,4.0,,We really enjoyed going up to the top and having a view of the city. It was quite enjoyable and will likely go back in the evening. Just wish the price was a bit lower as it seems a bit high given the venue. I would still recommend it.
,,Instagram Checkpoint,5.0,,"The pool is so crowded and made me wonder how others manage to capture all the amazing Instagram pictures. Staff are attentive , not really suitable for relaxing but it's really fun for people watching. Skydeck is ok (i myself wouldn't pay to go)."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Taxi drivers and hotel staff raved about this venue so we went and checked it out for ourselves.
Wow - a view to die for and what is even more incredible - a bar with tapas styled offerings that didn't break the bank.
Go see for yourself. You won't be disappointed."
,,Terrific views,5.0,,What a stunning design! An absolute must when in Singapore and well worth the $20 to go up to the Sky Deck. Terrific views over the city and a nice bar and restaurant. Really good.
,,Good view but crowded and expensive,1.0,,"We went up in the evening to see the city and the super trees lit up. Yep, you can see them through the crowd. Lots of people sitting against the clear barrier made it hard to get a decent view or photo. There's limited access to the 1.2Km top deck. Only guests can visit the infinity pool and only restaurant guests can get to the next level. Public is limited to about 1/4 of the area at one end. At SNG$46 for 2 adults its an expensive way to get a view. You probably should go there but its not worth staying long."
,,Buy the cocktail voucher,4.0,,Spend the entrance fee on the pass to ce la vie and pay the additional tax to enjoy a cocktail at the top!
,,Great views,4.0,,"Great views of the city. You can’t go around the whole sky-deck however, the the very front of it, but it is still good."
,,City view all over,4.0,,Good place to see all over to city. And can get sneak peak to Marina Bay sands pool area. Easy to take photos.
,,Poor pool service,1.0,,This maybe sounds a little thing but in this ”5+star” hotel no.... We came long way and booked two nights to enjoy sunset cocktails at the rooftop pool and service has gone bad... third time here and we ordered cocktails and still water with ice.... weiter just told us to drink our water from nearby tap (wtf) Views are still nice
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"Although access to the swimming pool is restricted to those staying at the Hotel, really enjoyed the views from this iconic building and a leisurely drink at the bar made the visit very memorable"
,,Best pool in the sky,5.0,,Fantastic way to relax by the pool on this fantastic rooftop... if you can afford it is a great experience and the view is fantastic
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,"When in Singapore I suggest making your way to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. One of the most iconic buildings in the world. I didn't go to Singapore just to see this building but I made sure to take time to visit it. The hotel itself is a beautiful structure, if you are an architecture buff Singapore is the city for you and the Marina Bay Sands should be at the top of your list. we went on a Sunday night which was a casual night aka: nice shorts, collard shirt, boat shoes for men, Women the same or a day dress. Also Tuesdays there is a special at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant for half price drinks! I went at night which was lovely, there was a great breeze up there which helped the drinks flow quite nicely. If you go to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Spago I highly suggest getting the 'Love you long time', BEST DRINK EVER! worth the money.

In the end, go up to the bar area and take in the views of Singapore, have a drink and feel the breeze. Be sure to fall in love with this building and take it all in!"
,,A bit of a ripoff.,1.0,,"You have to pay a hefty price to walk round a small observation deck with no seats. Access to the gardens and pool area is not allowed after paying a hefty price ($54 over 65’s price) so you are restricted to a view only. This cost gave you a small container of weak frozen Singapore Sling.
For us it was not worth the effort."
,,Stunning Views and Pool is so unique and amazing,5.0,,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights was amazing, The pool is stunning and the observation is lovely with stunning views. A must see. Loved looking at all the beautiful city lights. The drinks are expensive up there but i guess you have to expect that."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"Skypark offered amazing views of Singapore and even let us be on the top of one of the most famous buildings in Singapore and probably the world. It was a shame, we could only see the famed Infinity pool from a distance (resident guests only have access) but still the overall views from the top were good."
,,Sky high,5.0,,"Well worth the elevator trip and fee, The best view across Singapore and photo heaven. The elevator ride is quick and smooth. The guides and information is excellent and informative. The kiosk has food and drinks, prices are also high. You will have crowds, but more than enough time to have a photo and drinks. Book a room and stay, that way you can swim in the pool."
,,Absolutely fantastic!,5.0,,"I reviewed this under the marina area. However, I didn't mention the light show that they apparenty have every night, where the ""trees"" come to life with lights that are coordinated with beautiful music. Do not miss this -- one of the highlights of my trip"
,,Fantastic views worth a visit but reception staff very poor,4.0,,"Really looked forward to seeing the views from the Marina Bay Sands but felt like we were treated like cattle by the ticket staff - literally waved hands without a glance up at us to move to another queue - no apology for signage and directions that told us to wait where we were waiting and had to wait longer behind later arrivals
Male particularly rude and female very straight faced until I asked for an apology and then was effusive - the rest of the staff very helpful and experience not to be missed"
,,Fantastic view of Singapore not to be missed.,5.0,,If you go to Singapore you must go up to skypark at night for the fantastic views. The cocktails are good as well.
,,Vegas Super-Sized,4.0,,"Um...it’s big. A city onto itself. If you like gambling, shopping, eclectic restaurants - this might be for you. But you better like lots and lots and lots of people too."
,,Singapore at glance,5.0,,"Stoning view from the top of Marina Bay. We chose to be there at night (7PM) but it can also be wonderful during sunset or any other time. The entrance is free if you decide to miss swimming pool. That was reasonable decision .The view is the same from the nearby terrace, but we kept 50 SGD each in the pocket,"
,,Good looking from down,1.0,,"Not worth money and time if you cannot use a pool, but definitely looks great from ground and is architectural wonder. I was wondering how it feels to live in rooms for 300-400SGD per night (cheapest) when all the visitors can see that is happening inside those rooms especially when it is dark.
One thing for sure – I have never seen so many ships in water and amazed that there are no crashes"
,,Everyone has to go to the top!,4.0,,"Great view all round. Best thing to do if you can’t afford the super prices to stay here. You can do the SkyPark for $23 and get to spend time out on the point and look however for $22 you can go to the bar, just a few steps up for the sky deck and use that $22 against a drink at the bar. The view is just as good although you can’t go on the skydeck but you can sit in the shade and just admire the view. From this bar you can also walk around and look at the infinity pool. Only guests can get in but at least you can look and take a photo. Nice way to spend a little bit of time and earn the right to say you e been up there."
,,Incredible,4.0,,"Don't buy the singapore sling...everyone does. It's overpriced and not worth it. A beer is just as good...and that's overpriced too! This is a must do in Singapore but truthfully, it was a tad underwhelming. Our waiter was so full of himself, he clearly should find a new job. Told us he had been there 11 years...probably 10.5 years too long!"
,,A must do i suppose,4.0,,"The views are breathtaking but the prices for the bar are a micky take, so dont bother just look and go, the photo package was only a £10 two pictures in a leather case the most reasonable thing there."
,,"A must by night, and with daylight as well",5.0,,"Fantastic views on the whole Singapore city: Gardens by the Bay, the Bayfront, the skyline... It's really superb, and as I say not only by night but also with daylight (we went up there twice!)"
,,360 degree views of the city of Singapore,5.0,,If you have seen the movie Crazy Rich Asian’s at the cinema this is a must do. It is a smooth elevator ride to the top where you witness breathtaking views of Singapore from every angle. We paid an admission which included a Singapore Sling Slushie style cocktail. I am glad I witnessed this as where ever you walk through the city centre you can not miss the Marina Bay Sands skyscraper with that amazing shaped ship at the top.
,,Like taking a boat to the building.,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Building consists of 3 tall buildings and the top of the building has a connecting area between buildings that resemble giant submarines. This fantasy is so deep. Can make a place to be remembered by tourists with a unique identity Then getting to the top of the building and able to see the surrounding scenery of Singapore It is considered a focus for all tourists. Looking at Singapore from a high angle, seeing Lion Bay Mercedes Around the balcony is a mirror, so it doesn't block the vision. Looking around the city, the conclusion is good."
,,Sky park / Brunch & Drinks,5.0,,"We unfortunately were not guests at this amazing hotel but we did take a very quick elevator ride to sky park to see the incredible views of bay. It’s a $22 admission fee if you are not staying at hotel, unexpected bonus: they will credit that $22 towards food & drinks ....so... we stayed for adult beverages & appetizers at Ce’LaVie. Would definitely recommend"
,,Avoid the Fees,5.0,,"Instead of paying the large fee to go to the bar on top; we made reservations at Level 57. This gave us access to the top with no fees. The added bonus is that our meal was amazing as we had excellent views of Singapore. You can also stay after dinner to visit the club at the top; but beware there are lots of people smoking cigarettes in the club area. So even if the club area was outside, cigarette smoke was so thick we ended up just walking through and leaving."
,,Pool at the top!,5.0,,"This is an experience never forgotten. The building alone is worth the visit but once inside you see how amazing it is. Go to the top, have a cocktail or two and take plenty of photos."
,,Cool destination with fab views,5.0,,"We didn't stay at the hotel but visited the bar at the top, it had a great lively atmosphere and good food, we had cocktails and the barman put on a fun show. We returned again for dinner as we had enjoyed it so much.
The foyer of the hotel was a bit like Victoria station, packed and lacked any intimacy, not a place I'd like to stay although I'n sure the rooms are nice."
,,Awesome view from the top,5.0,,Enjoyed the view and the space is large enough to accommodate large groups without overcrowding. I guess crowd control by the staff below manages that.
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"Clean and full of people, tourists, whatever time and day. It's an experience though to sit and relax in one of the restaurant Spago overlooking the pool. Expensive but worth the memories"
,,Roof top view is amazing!,4.0,,A must stop for drinks and to see the entire city view of Singapore. There is a charge to go up but you get that back for your first drink. Definitely worth doing.
,,Singapore at its best,5.0,,"A must visit - picturesquely beautiful! One of the cleanest, loveliest places I have been. Plan on spending day Into evening."
,,Very dissapointing,1.0,,"Crowded, noisy, very overpriced drinks, difficult to get to. Stayed 10 mins then left.

So glad I didn't book the hotel, the pool looks like a tranquil oasis in the pictures when in reality it is heaving with people and is overlooked by the observation deck. Hotel on closer examination seems more like something in Las Vegas."
,,One of a kind experience. Don’t miss it,5.0,,"Fantastic view of both sides of building - Gardens by the Bay and the Harbor. Even can look back and see the pool on top. Elevator ride gives fun facts - like 3.3million kilograms of dirt for the rooftop plants. 30$ SG price includes a frozen Singapore sling. Views are well worth the price. Be aware, there is no sitting area up top."
,,Nice view but the building’s cooler seen from below,4.0,,"Karl Pilkington nails this in “An Idiot Abroad”: it’s better to live in the caves *opposite* to Petra façade than in the Petra caves themselves. The view is very nice indeed – the city skyline, the river and the seemingly endless weird swarm of ships – but after all it’s just a high place and the building itself is cooler and much more impressive when you look at it from below.
A sort of must-visit place, I suppose, nevertheless. Would probably be more impressed if we’d been there around sunset."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We went to the top of tower 3 for a drink. It’s 22 dollars each but you can redeem that 22 back against the price of a drink. Just know that you don’t get any change off your voucher, so a 16 dollar drink will cost 22 dollars, so best to buy two drinks and pay the difference in cash. Amazing views from the top."
,,Iconic Structure,4.0,,"We went to the top just so we can say we have been there.! It is quite expensive but you can get a package that includes a ""Singapore Sling"" which might be better value (Although the drink is quite small). Does provide excellent views over the city,"
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Well worth a visit. Fantastic designer shops and attractions. Marina Bay Sands, is well worth a visit."
,,It’s A Must Do Even Though You Really Don’t Have To,4.0,,"The view is impossible to beat and like every observation deck around the world you pay for the privilege and you are there for only a few minutes. There is nothing undercover so wind, rain and sun are all going to be your friend. You won’t see anything you wouldn’t see from the Sentosa Cable Cars or the Singapore Flyer, that being said I enjoyed every minute of it and you will too."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The view from the top is absolutely amazing well worth the trip up there a 360 panoramic view of Singapore.
,,Take a stroll through the sky park area,4.0,,This is Really an amazing piece of architecture with great views from the sky Park. Nothing in this area is inexpensive.
,,"OK if you like heights, but $24.",4.0,,"The fee pays only for limited access to the oversailing end, which is just a deck with none of the trees, so strictly not a 'park' at all. There's a small bar, but the pool area is residents only."
,,Animal Towels & Infinity Pool,5.0,,"My wife and myself thorough enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore . Two things particularly took our fancy. The animal towel that appears in your room every day - very funny. We had bear, crab and elephant. The infinity Pool is fantastic - it opens 6am and I’d suggest getting there before 7.30am to experience unbelievable views of Singapore before the breakfast hordes arrive."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,If in Singapore it is a must do. We went up on the first lift and had the entire platform to ourselves. Views are just incredible!
,,it can not be missed,5.0,,+ very unique place with stunning terrase + amazing views + top drinks at terrase bar - prices are shocking high - long queue to get up
,,Disappointing service from staff on observation deck,3.0,,"We stayed in Singapore in March and decided to visit the Skypark observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands.
We thought that the service was a bit strict from the staff who were overly concerned about us not keeping to the tourist area of the Skypark.
The views of Singapore were fantastic and we were going to finish off with a drink in the bar however the staff were not very welcoming and we were stopped as soon as we entered the bar area and asked to move back to the entrance. When we looked for a table with a view we were directed to seats by the bar which we didn’t want.
We decided against a drink as it was $23 for a beer and I felt that it was not very relaxed with the attitude from the staff.
Overall was disappointed with the experience and felt it was not good value for money."
,,outstanding,5.0,,Great place to go for a stunning view out over the city. We went up early in the day when it was quiet and before the heat of the day bulit up when haze could restrict the view. It was outstanding.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Great area to walk around, have a drink and a bite to eat, if you can get in, as some establishments get very busy with queues outside. Magnificent views across the bay, and an amazing skyline with all the massive buildings"
,,Get clicked,5.0,,Perfect spot for getting clicked. Lots of good views available. Do not forget to take one with the Marina Bay Sands at the back..
,,An irrisistable attraction,5.0,,"Having set eyes on the Bay Sands hotel, who could leave Singapore without taking the opportunity to ascend to the height of the boat feature spanning the three towers? Not us! The views across this fascinating city were excellent, as might be expected. So go for it!"
,,A Great Wonder to Experience,5.0,,"Unsurpassed views and panoramas of Singapore and its surrounding waterways. Slightly tedious and time-consuming to get tickets and wait for the elevator ride to the sky, but well worth it once you arrive at the top deck. The views are remarkable on a clear day - and magical at night, with the amazing lights of Singapore. WARNING - don't get scammed with the ridiculously over-priced pictures they innocently take - then seriously hound you to buy when leaving. Their aggression and unwillingness to accept a polite refusal can almost ruin the experience, as it did for us. I eventually had to warn them to stop asking! I'm surprised they're allowed to get away with that kind of behavior as it does a great disservice to Singapore's open and friendly visitor culture."
,,Got to go to the top,5.0,,"What an amazing view when up on the viewers deck. It's a must do while in Singapore, absolutely breath taking."
,,Lovely spot for sundowners,5.0,,Don’t pay to view - pay to access the bar and get a free drink! Bar can be very busy but if you can get near the rail the view is fantastic. Cocktails are average.
,,Singapore sling in the best surroundings,5.0,,We went up to the skybar for the evening it was great the views were the best in the city we had a cheeky cocktail and some food it is quite expensive if you eat but its a once in a lifetime
,,Scenic View,5.0,,"The view of Singapore from up there is great. A must visit place as well for Singapore. Top view, good for kids"
,,Mixed feelings,3.0,,Went with our two adult children. It is pretty awesome. Not sure its value for money.. some of us enjoyed it some found it aveeage..
,,Great views of the city,4.0,,Great views of the city. You have a choice of 2 tickets S$23 or S$30 with a Singapore sling frozen drink (like a slush puppy). Save $7 and don't go for the drink. They take a picture as you go in and want S$50!!! Take a selfi yourself.
,,Lovely views but nothing more,4.0,,We paid the fee to go up to the Skypark and glad we did to experience the amazing views. But the bar was dirty and the service was awful. Very disappointed.
,,Great Views,5.0,,Amazing 360 Degree views of the city and the evenings looks even better Do make reservations and head there as tables are always hard to get by
,,BEST Views of Sinapore!! Loved It -- MUST SEE -- 5-STARS!!!,5.0,,"OH MY GOSH -- INCREDIBLE! The whole Marina Sands Hotel experience was amazing to behold, not to mention the rooftop Skypark! WOW! This took my breath away once we stepped out to the viewing platform. You have the BEST views of the Marina Bay area and the entire Singapore skyline!!

BOTTOM LINE: I have been to Singapore several times before and had not taken time to come here and now I realize what a mistake that was. I would make this my #1 thing to do when visiting Singapore. The hotel is one of the most amazing architectural wonders of the world! Who would have thought this king of a building could be built! The ""Sands"" gambling empire made this all possible (yes, there is a Casino here too!). The viewing platform is very big and roomy for everyone. There is a restaurant on top also. On the side you can get a secret glimpse of the over-the-top infinity swimming pool everyone can't wait to see. LOVED OUR VISIT! Absolutely MUST SEE attraction! MY RATING: 10/10"
,,"Worth the view, but very limited facilities",3.0,,"The view is definitely worth a visit. However, don't expect being able to hang around there for a long time.

It's very hot on the top level and there is no shade and no seats you can use. You are also not allowed to sit anywhere, except for the toilet. Also note that tripods are prohibited, so you can only make steady shots by hand."
,,great views but overpriced,3.0,,"We payed to go just up to the observation desk, and yes the views were amazing however you are restricted to a small area and are not allowed up to the cafe or cocktail bar which means the price is just to go to the observation deck and nothing else. Although it was lovely to see it was really overpriced for this sort of activity. It may be worth considering going to the restaurant or cocktail bar as an alternative. Once in, it was extremely crowded with no Air Con in the queues to the lift. You were herded in like animals, staff were very impersonal and not very friendly, the lifts were then jammed as full as possible with guests which was extremely uncomfortable and made the activity less enjoyable, felt it was a real money maker for the hotel."
,,A great lookout from the top,5.0,,"The view of Singapore from the top of the Bay Sands is gorgeous.You can see almost all of Singapore from there, including the Gardens by the Bay. Just great!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Buy the ticket in advance on the internet, as this way you will not have to make such a long line to get in Recommend going around 6 pm to get a beautiful sunset view Recommend spending about 45 minutes up there"
,,Well worth a visit for the views,5.0,,"Visit is worth the entry fee to have extensive views through 360 degrees. Shows the true number of ships waiting to dock and the building development progressing in Singapore. No pressure on time - stay as long as you like but take water, Drinks and Ice Cream stall available if needs be."
,,Great view,5.0,,Had a great view of city and trees.Lights show at night was amazing. The flowers and plants were set up so you could educate yourself. Get there early for tree light show so can find a place to sit or lay.
,,not for the faint hearted,5.0,,We when up here at night when we did a night tour. The Observation Deck Soar 57 levels above the heart of the city as you capture the moment of a lifetime at the stunning Sands Skypark public observation deck.
,,The views go forever!!,5.0,,"Completely blows you away, the views are spectacular and on a clear day you can see forever!!! Quite breezy up there and a little cool!!! Worth a visit!!"
,,Worth having one drink there!,5.0,,"Okay, it's not cheap, but you're in Singapore! Not worth paying for the observation deck, go inside the lobby and buy a voucher for the bar/restaurant. You pay 22 dollars per adult, which you can then use against purchases. Mind you, two beers and an albeit tasty plate of spicy chips with curry sauce cost 66 dollars once taxes were included! But the views are amazing and you get to peer at the rich folk in their roof top infinity pool!"
,,"Might be tall, but not sure about the best",3.0,,"It maight be said that if you’re in Singapore you need to visit ‘MBS’. It’s the place to people watch, with very expensive drinks. Visit at least once to say you’ve done it, but there are better places to go to in Singapore...possibly a victim of its own success..."
,,Unreal Views!,5.0,,Best way to see all of Singapore. You won’t regret it! The drinks and food are a bit pricey up there. But that’s Singapore for you. Expensive.
,,Must See Attraction,5.0,,"We took a bumboat ride on the river over to Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The boat ride was enjoyable and gave you a new view seeing this magnificent building. We walked through the Marina Sky Mall with all the Name brand designers. The mall is beautiful. Then we took the elevator to the Skypark which cost $23 Singapore dollars.
We arrived before the night show at the gardens (7:45) and watched from above. I got some beautiful pictures. Once that ended, we walked around and found another water fountain show had started at 8pm on the other side of the Skypark. Very beautiful to see. Did I mention we also had our first frozen, Singapore Sling. On a hot night, it was just what was needed. Most enjoyable and worth the cost."
,,Imposing!,5.0,,You just have to love the structures with the imposing image! Great architectural masterpiece and excellent design.
,,Has the wow factor,4.0,,"Did not stay at this place but had to visit this amazing hotel and see the infinity pool on the rooftop
Went to the Spargo bar on floor 57 and sampled their amazing cocktails whilst taking in the panoramic views of Singapore
If you decide to visit the Observation deck on the next floor above their is a charge and not sure the view is any better
Oh and the pool is amazing"
,,Awesome view of Singapore,4.0,,Pretty impressive going up to this landmark. went on a Monday night and it was not crowded at all. great views of Singapore
,,Great view but a little on the pricey side,4.0,,"Great veiw from the 57th floor with a panaromic view of the city of Singapore. A must visit place after dark to experience the night lights of this amazing clean and booming city. A great platform to watch the night laser show. It can be crowded and difficult to get a spot for photos. The bar there is expensive even though the admission price for ticket can go towards credit for a drink. With so many tourists going up to experience the view at night, is it necessary to charge an admission price of $20 per person? Having all these negatives, we still have no regrets in getting tickets up to enjoy the view and have a Singapore Sling up on the 57th floor (if you do not have fear of heights). LOL. This is our first trip to SIngapore and we will return to do the same again up there for sure. Highly recommended."
,,Better views and value for money at the Skybar,2.0,,"Not worth the price to go up, you would be better served spending $20 to enter the Skybar near Ce La Vi - you can grab a comfortable seat and look down at the people standing at the skypark platform below trying to take a decent selfie. Plus, your $20 entry at Skybar gives you credits of the same value that can be spent back on drinks and food."
,,Crazy Rich Asians movie,5.0,,A main attraction after we saw the movie. The night river cruise brings you up close to the Skypark from which the lasers shoot out into the night sky. The bridges are lit with different colors and skyline may not be filled with as many interesting buildings as Hong Kong or Shanghai but still breathtaking...MDSPOCK
,,Great and stunning,5.0,,A really great and amazing view. It’s really one place you have to visit in Singapore. You will have the best pictures as well.
,,A Modern wonder that everyone should visit,5.0,,We went to Marina Bay tower to the top by the elevator. The set up on the top of three towering hotel is breather taking. One can see the city by walking around this place among trees and flowers to get 360 degree vieiws of the Singapore.
,,Entire Singapore in one view!,5.0,,"The construction of Marina Bay Sands hotel , Casino as well as mall has been quite intricately designed and planned.
Coming to the mall, it is widely spread and it's so huge that we actually got lost twice in searching for an exit. It connects to the hellix bridge which is all lit in the evening and offers a fabulous experience as well as view to take pictures.
Next is the hotel- hatts off to the idea for creating such a marvel. Tourists are allowed to visit up to 56th floor and be there for sometime, take pictures and have the best of times. The hotel guests only have the access to infinity pool. The restaurant at the sky deck is a perfect place to go for a romantic date. The ambience there is something to die for.
In the evening, there is light and sound show near the river (one can see in the pictures attached). Very beautifully crafted and executed. The timings are fix and it's a free show. One can just go in advance and sit to ensure a perfect view of the show. We had an amazing experience as we spent some good 3-4 hours relaxing and exploring around on foot."
,,View spectacular but disappointing experience,3.0,,So popular that it’s hard to enjoy when your being trampled by the masses. You are herded like cattle up the elevators and then scramble for a spot to take that special pic you have paid all the money for. Disappointed by the experience
,,What a view,5.0,,We visited the observation deck at Marina Bay Sands at night time. It was a beautiful clear night and what a sight Singapore was. A very beautiful city. Well worth the time and money to see this view
,,Well worth a look,5.0,,"This amazing he too dominates the sky line in Singapore but it is really attractive and covered in greenery as are so many other buildings in the City. We went on a hop on off bus with a ticket included to go up to the viewing point at the top of the hotel. You can’t access the centre of the platform where the pool etc are, this being for guests but nice bar to access and we had a Singapore sling cocktail to mark the experience !!!"
,,Great views but don't bother with the cocktail,3.0,,"Go up and enjoy the fabulous views over the city and the park but don't pre purchase the cocktail (frozen Singapore Sling) it is more like a slush puppy. View late afternoon before sunset, watch the sun set and then head to the park for the light show in the forest.Then walk back to the front of the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre and watch the light show there. Great free evening entertainment."
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"The Sands hotel is a beautiful hotel and the views from the sky park are spectacular. Senior discounts are available. The drinks at the sky bar run $23. You can get a senior ticket for $20 or, for $27 you get your ticket and a Singapore Sling drink included."
,,Best experience in Singapore,5.0,,"Loved this place, go to tower 3 to buy tickets to floor 57 for $22 you then get a drink included but be aware you then pay the tax on the drink. Views to die for absolutely amazing experience. Must do when in Singapore. Free WiFi too"
,,A Special View of the City,5.0,,"Wow, what a view. The place is truly incredible. Next time I come to Singapore, I am going to stay at the hotel just so I can access it whenever I want and also access the bar on the rooftop."
,,Great views and a must visit,5.0,,"At the Marina Bay Sands there are two ways to vist the roof of the hotel. There is the SkyPark and there is also the SkyBar.

We had a short time to vist the roof at end of a business trip and were unsure of the best way.

The SkyPark admission is on the outside of the hotel, there was a queue. We went inside and there is the SkyBar admission. You have to pay for both but the Skybar admisssion is redemable against the cost of drinks in the bar. Whilst expensive it means the entrance is effectively free.

The views are similar, the exception being that the SkyBar has restricted acces and it is more difficult to get the hte edge and there is no access to the infinity pool area.

From my perspective we made the right decision the views are fantastic.."
,,Fantastic view.,4.0,,"Great view, open area deck, plenty of area to get great photos and/or selfies without having to wait for others to move on. Admission price is a bit expensive but we booked tickets through Klook & saved some money, easy to use tickets. We did not partake in the bar, but did not feel like we were missing out on anything. Lift to the deck is super quick, need to unblock your ears a few times in the short time to get both to the top or the bottom. Nice just to stop & admire the overall beauty of Singapore."
,,Best memory in my life,5.0,,"Even though is hard to find the ticket for me and take time loo long to find this place. But It is was super Good!!!! This view and everything was good even though have so many people. I dot know how to describes. When you visit SG, you must try. I have the picture for reference."
,,Great experience!,5.0,,Food was great Service was excellent And the crew AWESOME!!! especially Angelo De Guzman Ill be back for sure
,,Architecture at its best,5.0,,"Recommend to take the elevator to the top. It costs SIN$ 20,00 ( $ 15.00 US ). This does not give you access to the pool but great views over the whole city"
,,"Great view, nothing else",3.0,,"Well, not that I’ve expected engaging else. But knowing few good roof-top bars in this city, I was expecting to get good drinks. Well, surprisingly they were awfully sweet and expensive. So besides the view the whole experience is rather poor."
,,Singapore Observation Deck.,5.0,,"The charge to visit the 57th floor is a bit steep & also requires to purchase a ticket for a two-year-old child. You will take through a super fast lift directly to the 57th floor, It's an open observation deck which gives us very awesome views of the city. Do try a visit late in the evening to see the city lit up."
,,optional,3.0,,"if you are poor like me, i suggest you skip this place. its really expensive. the view is amazing but it might burn a hole in your pocket :) singapore has more things to offer without breaking your budget"
,,Much more impressive from the ground,2.0,,"As a visitor, do not expect to see more than an observation deck with bar and restaurant. The rest of the facilities, such as the swimming pool, are reserved for the hotel guests."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing place I really love there . We can do a lot things and never get boring I hope can back again soon
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,"This hotel is gigantic, and you must visit the observatory for beautiful views of the Gardens by the Bay with its supertrees, and the city. They only allow guests to visit the infinity pool area but the visit and how the hotel was designed and build is very interesting."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Amazing views from the top towards the city. Beer was a little bit expensive in the bar, but overall worth the visit."
,,"AmaIng panorama , crowded pool",4.0,,What a view of the futuristic waterfront! The crowd in the lobby was experienced in the pool as we used room key of friends to have the swim experience on the 52nd floor. Now would like to explore the one in Kuala Lumpur!
,,Don't bother.,2.0,,Lot of effort and cost to get to a viewing platform that offers nothing else - not even a coffee or cold drink. A complete waste of time!
,,Best View,5.0,,"Our experience at Marina,take in fantastic views of Singapore's city skyline, especially during the sunset moments where the colourful city with a lights start to make the city a magical.Swim in at the famous infinity pool or just relax by the decks on the pool chairs and enjoy being on the top of the place
compared to being there to experience it yourself.A have to do."
,,Great way to spend the afternoon,5.0,,"Skip the lines for the Skypark Observation Deck ($20) and go to the Skybar instead. $22 (all of which applies to food or drink) and you can spend the day above it all with a decent drink in your hand and return multiple times during the day. Bar appetizers were wonderful, and dinner in the Ce La Vi restaurant absolutely fabulous! Dinner menu is not cheap, but the views are amazing and you can watch the evening light show below at the Gardens by the Bay if you reserve the right table."
,,Mbs skypark,4.0,,"We visited floor 56 & had a great view of Singapore. The tour is for 1-3 hrs & you can stay at the top for as long as you wish.
There are no seats. There is a bar on that floor & you can use it after you exit.
Again our tkts were via hippo pass & once wed had enough of the heat we left.
If you are to the singapore flyer i personally feel you dont need to this attraction. Its the same view.
This attraction is 6/7 mins walk to gardens by bay."
,,Sky view,3.0,,An opportunity to enter a Marina bay sands hotel. But access to the sky park is expensive and you are restricted to a relatively small area with limited refreshment facilities.
,,Magnificent views from the Sky deck,5.0,,"This is the best place to take pictures of Singapore, especially of the sea with all the ships and of the Gardens of the Bay. Nice place high above the city, good restaurant nearby. Take your time to look at Singapore from various perspectives (pics attached)"
,,AMAZING RESORT,4.0,,"Everyone should visit this resort even if they can’t afford to stay here. The design and the things you can see and do here. From shopping. eating. going to the museum, looking at the view on the Skydeck of the city. Especially at night and walking by the Marina Bay waterfront is stunning at night. The largest infinity pool in the world. Just amazing."
,,Just simply amazing!,5.0,,What an amazing site. One must go on the skydeck to get a great view of the entire city. It doesn't disappoint.
,,A true spectacle,5.0,,"A MUST SEE if you go to Singapore. Really easy to get to on the MRT, it takes you straight into the mall by the hotel. There are fireworks at 9pm and a water show on the lake. Go into the hotel, up to floor 55 in tower two, then go up to floor 57 in the other lift to have a drink in the bar next to the pool, views are spectacular!"
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,One of famous tourist attraction which needs to be visited in Singapore definitely.ideally you should go around 6.30 in eveng so that you can click pics during day time as well as night.it looks amazing at night.
,,Spectacular Amazing Must See views,5.0,,"My partner and I recently visited this amazing 'must see views' location. It is situated on Tower 3 of the famous Marina Bay Sands complex.
We stayed on the observation deck in daylight for about an hour, taking in all of the amazingly stunning views of Singapore bay and the surrounding area and out to sea.
We enjoyed a drink from the bar, and were never rushed in any way.
Spectacular views all around and a must see must visit location.
We can recommend it for singles, couples and families and would visit again."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,I was very disappointed in this venue . Sure the views are fantastic but there is no where to sit and enjoy the view .$80 for a photo package . No thanks . Paid $7 for sling which was a plastic cup with coloured ice . Singapore you can do so much better .
,,Save your money,3.0,,"The view is nice, but really quite the same as from just about any hotel window in Singapore. TIP: Instead of paying for a ticket to the observation deck, just go up to Spago Restaurant on the same floor. Buying something at the restaurant will let you lounge on the upper floor as well, and the price of a drink is less than the cost of admission to the observation deck. Plus, you get to see more, like the hotel’s infinity pool (which is not visible from the observation deck)."
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,"Definitely recommend, the view is stunning. You can’t wear your bathers with a cover up if you have just visited the pool as a guest, they will request you wear a bathrobe or get changed."
,,One of the must in Singapore,5.0,,"You pay 22 $ SGD to take the elevator till the skypark that includes a drink, but we were asked for extra 5 $ SGD each for our cocktel.
You had better going early, around 18:00 PM to get a good place to take pictures and videos of sunset and the skyline of Singapore"
,,Make sure it is fully open,3.0,,"Paid the $21 per person to get in, then found that 2 of the 3 places to be were reserved for private parties. Pool area is only accessible for residents of the hotel. Drinks are WAYYY pricey. A great view though."
,,Incredible views,5.0,,Fabulous views of the bay and marina with delicious cocktails. Don't be persuaded that the light shows are best experienced from here though - watch from the bar then go down and get amongst it for the best experience.
,,Great Viewing,5.0,,What a great experience. 56 floors high. The view goes forever. Again well organised in Singapore's way. A photo taken before you go up and the only opportunity to buy the photo is on the way out to the deck. I was so waiting to see the Gadens by the Bay light show from above. The light show is definitely better from the ground. Seeing the lights of Singapore at night from a height is the best experience. So glad we did it. Be warned it does get crowded. Just a little sad that we didn't try out out any eateries at the top. Highly recommended this to see.
,,Some great views,4.0,,"This was a must do and was worth the effort. Could do with a few seats up there so you can sit down and drink your Singapore Sling which was part of our package, we had to sit on the floor."
,,Like a big airport terminal with rooms,2.0,,"If you like being surrounded by thousands of people in a great big airport terminal, where you are charged a fortune for everything then this is the place for you!
We went up to the restaurant next to the pool and received possibly the worst service ever.
Waited for someone to take drinks order, waited 20 mins for drinks to arrive, so ordered another round as they served first one!
Eventually they took food order, and to be fair the burger was excellent, hence the two as a score.
£150for a burger lunch and two beers way over the top, but are you paying for view or famous chefs name over the door?
Overall an experience that was very bad."
,,Definitely worth doing for the best view of Singapore,5.0,,This is a must do for a birds eye view of Singapore. It also gives you the most brilliant aspect of Gardens by the Bay.
,,"A 2 night stay, different views",5.0,,"This is certainly different with fantastic views over gardens and grand prix circuit, from the rooms. The food is expensive but there is a great mall across the road thru the underpass, also a casino. A hoppa but stops outside."
,,Howard’s Visit,4.0,,"Took the lift to the roof top platform, amazing view but rather busy. No time for a drink as had to wait in line to get the lift back, as our coach was waiting .
Next time will stay at hotel and utilise the rooftop pool."
,,Terrible queues to leave! Do NOT come up at night.,1.0,,Paid $22 reach then had to wait over an hour to go back down in one pathetic little lift. Not worth it.
,,stunning view from the top and imressive building,4.0,,Very impressive building form outside and also inside (size) and from the top a great view - for non-hotel guests only the cafe and observation desk is accessible and not the swimming pool area
,,Great view,3.0,,"Obviously the hotel is an amazing place, but if you want to go up to the viewing platform, be ready to part with lots of dollars!! Nearly S$100 for 4 people is not cheap. The views at the top are stunning, which compensates for the huge cost of drinks in the bar. Value for money? I think not, but tge views are good so you pay your money & take your choice."
,,Enjoy a drink on top of this Singapore icon!,4.0,,When we went to see this attraction we found out that we could ride up to the top floor (57th) and enjoy drink and food indoors or outdoors on a balcony at Lavo. We ordered and enjoyed a couple of drinks and fabulous views of the surrounding areas from our lofty perch. Loved it.
,,Sundowner at the skybar - a must do when you are in Singapore,5.0,,Was there at arround 18:30 The price to go up to the skybar was arround 22 sgd but you get a voucher for it to order a drink... plan to stay there till it gets dark it is absolutly werth the to enjoy the view...
,,PERFECT WAY TO START THE SINGAPORE EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"I knew that it was only about 50 km from shore to shore but I just could not get a feel for the layout of the country; however after wandering around the Sky Port, reading the descriptions on each of the viewpoints, it really brought it all together for me. The views are amazing and if I am ever back in town doing this at night is a must."
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,From a person like myself who is terrified of heights and cringed when buying the ticket. I absolutely loved it. It felt so safe. The elevator to the top was so smooth. Highly recommended. Oh and you can buy a ticket that includes a frozen Singapore Sling once on top. That's what I did. Enjoyed a nice cocktail while taking in the incredible view.
,,See Singapore from height,3.0,,I m not much lover of going to height and seeing few things...but it's one of the good structure that they have..just go on top..one may have lunch as well..and click few pictures..that's it..but much to see.
,,Cool place and amazing view,5.0,,"The entire area is quite clean and this place is really cool, the video over there is amazing. Good spot for pictures!"
,,Incredible view and impressive walking 😎!,5.0,,We walked a lot in this amazing city and can highly recommend this area. We have got a really impressive walking and incredible views of the astonishing surroundings 😊!
,,Great views,4.0,,"I really enjoyed the experience. There are a couple of things you need to know first so you can manage your expectations. The voucher is 22sgd which you can use for food or drink at the top. This buys you a cocktail or a small beer. Access is via tower 3. You will not get access to the lower deck or to the infinity pool, that's just for residents. You won't see the Bay gardens either. I went around 18.30 and yes it was busy, and yes it was difficult to get a seat. Just take your time, enjoy the atmosphere and the views."
,,An enjoyable visit for sunset.,5.0,,"After a day visit to the Gardens by the Bay, the short walk to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel gave us access to the Observation Deck, which was very good, both to look down on the Gardens By The Bay and to watch the sunset. Then to see the lights of Singapore by night; quite a sight."
,,Nice area for stroll,5.0,,The area was lovely to walk around with lots of attractions along the way but definitely keep some water with you in the heat.
,,Amazing View!,5.0,,Beautiful place to visit especially the rooftop bar and restaurant! Tricky getting up there from the car park.
,,Excellent View of the City,4.0,,You get excellent view of the whole city and lots of room to walk around but generally it is crowded. Fairly expensive to go to the deck area.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Expensive food for tourists but the view and feel is amazing. You can see the whole city. Flyer, Gardens By the Bay, big offices, Sea almost everything. Must visit for all travelers preferably night time."
,,Mariner bay sands hotel,4.0,,"The hotel is impressive both on the inside as well as the out side. The top deck viewing area is $23 which is steep but if you want to have a drink you can pay $22 to go tothe bars on the top deck. The 2 bars have some restriction on their view but you can still get some cracking photo as drink for you $23 so worth it. We had over an hr soaking up the luxury, enjoying the sun and fantastic views. It is a must do when in Singapore."
,,Spectacular Views,4.0,,A must when in Singapore. Very busy but lovely views in the evenings. Is accessed via tower 3. Can be difficult getting served at the bar
,,Beautiful sunset,4.0,,We went to the bar at the top of the building to watch the beautiful sunset over the city. The queue to pay moved quickly and the staff was efficient and polite. Soon we were on the top floor and were lucky to find a table. It took a while to get our drinks but we were able to enjoy it all and take good photos. It was very windy and cold and we didn’t stay too long. Overall a very nice experience worth it.
,,fantastic,5.0,,a must to visit at night the views of the singapore sky line and lights over the bay are incredible we got some fabulous photos
,,A must see/visit,5.0,,"Stupid expensive food and drinks but the view is simply out of this world and worth it alone. We are guests in the MBS so access is pet of our stay but the daily fee is good value, it’s the food and drink where they get you."
,,Stay for drinks,5.0,,"Came 1 hour before closing so low crowds. Did the Singapore flyer during the day so chose this for night.
Didn't realize there was a roof top bar connected which means you can stay till 1am mid week rather than leaving the observation deck by 10pm.
I'm pretty sure you can opt out of observation deck and just go to bar. it will cost 20 dollars but you get that back by buying a drink which are pricey.
Either way the night view is insanely good"
,,Evening visit a must,5.0,,"Visited here in the evening. The views are amazing, and there are light/water shows in the evening. We didn't manage to get to the pool area, but from the viewing floor the show and views are amazing"
,,Best View of Singapore,5.0,,"The best view of the entire Singapore. I love to be on top of the world and be able to see the beautiful view of downtown Singapore. Personally, the best thing to do is spend $22 per person to go up to Ci La Vi. You can used the $22 towards the credit for a drink. You still have a great view of the City in Ci La Vi."
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,This is the place to go if you want great views of the city. You can see in every direction for miles. You can book a visit to the Skydeck so you can take photos of all the city sites. You can also book one of the three restaurants at the top however the restaurants will not allow you onto the Skydeck to take pictures - you will have to do that from whatever views the restaurants have to offer.
,,Cruise in the sky,4.0,,"We went to the waterfront especially to see the hotel with the ship atop and managed to visit the observation deck 56 floors up. Panoramic 360 degree views over the night garden and out to sea as well as over the skyline of Singapore. We were told that this hotel and the skyscrapers of the business district are all built on reclaimed land, a worrying thought when you are that high!! Please note that you are only allowed access to the observation deck and cafe and the majority of the 'ship' with bars and an infinity pool are for guests only. My wife is desperate to stay and use the pool, what a photo that would make!!"
,,LIVO Restaurant is worth the reservation,5.0,,"The restaurant offers an amazing view of the city.
We enjoyed drinks outside while waiting for the raised gardens light show to start after sunset. The color show was fantastic and worth waiting for.
Aournd the veranda the city offered a light show the likes of Bellagio in LasVegas NV in the USA!
Dont try to even get a glimpse of the eternity pool and deck’ unless you are staying at the hotel. With no key card to access the guard will not let you pass.
Enjoy."
,,Night Tour,5.0,,"Great !! Its a beautiful night view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands , good for having dinner or family gathering!"
,,Great Views!,5.0,,"Would highly recommend going up the sky park! Great views across Singapore, maps are available to point out everything! We did not book tickets, we just turned up and paid on the door. With a Singapore airlines boarding pass you also get a discount! Well worth a visit."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"Go there by yourself. Do not use Tourist packages.
Once you there, everything you need to see is at walking distance.

When you do enter in the place (after you bought a ticket), on person proposes you to take a picture, even if you refuse. But you may insist to refuse. Why? Because they person says ""free service"". However, when you go the 56th floor, staff jump on you and want to sell you the picture for SGP80 (around 60 euros) with couple of tourist traps. DO REFUSE IT! 60 euros for that??
After 15 min, you'll go back home as you already took pictures. Nice view."
,,Great Views of City from Skypark,5.0,,Definitely a highlight. You get little time to enjoy but enough to take a few photos and selfies. It would be better to do dinner or drinks if you have time. amazing architecture and nice shops in the main floor of the casino if you want to stay around longer but everything is very high end just so you know.
,,Marina bay sands sky deck a disappointment,2.0,,Having paid 28$ apiece for a trip to the 56th floor. It was not worth the money. Hardly stayed for 20 minutes as there is no seating arrangement. A waste of time and money.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"It was my dream to go there ! The view is amazing!! Very good architect. The lift is going fast upastairs . We had dinner at the celavie restaurant the valentine’s day and it was perfect . Not happy from the staff . I was expecting something more ... we Paid almost 500 Singapore dollars and the staff wasn’t for that kind of restaurant. Late service not watching when our food finished so we had to wait for the drinks ....... if you go there just take a drink , I wasn’t surprised from the restaurant service"
,,Just do it,5.0,,"For the best view over this area of Singapore, pay to visit the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. You'll travel by lift to the 56th floor and have the most amazing views over the city. You will also experience the amazing architecture of this amazing hotel both on the inside and on the outside. On the 57th floor, where only residents of the hotel can visit, there is a swimming pool, bar etc. You can actually get a part view of the top floor from the 56th by climbing up the steps around the side of the open top level you are on. The top you are standing on is referred to as ""the boat"" which sits on top of the 3 supporting structures. Just do it people!!"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Drink on top of tall building with views sounds a bit hackneyed and predictable.....but this was truly breathtaking.
We went up for a drink or two at about 4.30 pm and it was difficult to tear ourselves away. It is not just the stunning views of Singapore, it is the very cool bar with great music and a fantastic atmosphere.
You do of course need a small mortgage for the drinks but it seemed well, well worth it.
Definitely a 'must do' when in Singapore.
Can't comment on the hotel (didn't stay there) but the new shopping mall and restaurants adjoining the hotel are again symptomatic of a confident, brilliant place."
,,Great views.,5.0,,Go before sunset. See the area and enjoy the sunset. Great firework on the lake during the Chinese Nw Year period.
,,"Good to view, not to stay",4.0,,"I went to the viewing deck as a hotel guest. I thought it was pretty neat and offered a great view. I also stayed there and thought it was severely overpriced. So in my opinion, just stay somewhere cheaper but certainly pay to go to the observation deck."
,,Superb views,5.0,,"Visited this place during the day, went to the top and had the obligatory Frozen Singapore Sling, stunning 360dg views over Singapore city with all the container vessels joustling for position to gain entry into the port. Just wish we had returned at nighttime to see all the twinkly lights of the city beneath us and in the horizon. Another place that must be seen to be believed."
,,The View Of Sigapore,5.0,,You'll get the best view of the singapore . At the same time enjoy lovely meal at CÉ LA VI. One of the best resturant around. If you are a guest at MBS you don't pay for any entrace fee.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Visited Hotel and Skypark and was amazed. Well worth a visit. We ate in one of the cafes for a very reasonable price. Then up to the top. Bit pricey for a ride in a lift but brilliant and not to be missed. They take a photo before you go up and by the time you get to 56th floor there is a presentation pack waiting for you. More money! We were lucky and had a very clear day so views spectacular. If you use hop on hop off buses they stop right outside.
,,Great views and staff,5.0,,We went on 2 occasions. The first time it was barely busy and we got our pick of seating and the drinks were served quick which was great. The second time was during the fireworks one night in the lunar new year celebrations and we found it very difficult to move around or see anything. But the staff were still quick with our orders and pleasant. Good experience considering.
,,Amazing Photos,5.0,,Excellent views of beautiful Singapore. You will take some fantastic photos. Highly recommend to visit. In Marina Bay Sands Hotel complex.
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"As iconic Singapore, the Sky Park is not to be missed. Be sure to check a day in advance for online tickets through Klook and you'll save about 10. dollars pp over gate prices."
,,Beautiful views of Singapore skyline,5.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay sands skypark in the month of January , the best time to visit is around 6:00 pm , when you can see the stunning Singapore skyline in twlight."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Such amazing views. Lovely staff with lovely food and drinks. Definitely worth a visit for a skyline view.
,,Stupid and rude staff at entrance,1.0,,"This place is just a tourist trap, u pay entrance fee to get access to a bar where u won’t get a table or sit to have ur drink, always overcrowded. Add to this a rude staff and hours to get your drink... enjoy the view tho"
,,Great night,5.0,,We got to the top and wow the sights were fantastic the staff were friendly its amazeing how they built this building its so amazeing
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"I visited at night to see the city lights and my oh my, I never expected it to be that awesome. First of all the ride 57 floors up was so smooth and fast, then you get up there and you start reading all the signage and see the people and boom, suddenly there’s a rooftop restaurant (a bit pricey to my budget) and a a beautiful infinity pool which only guests can access to, the music is actually a great selection of chillout lounge that makes the perfect ambiance for such a magnificent place.

If it’s the right time during your night visit you better find a place for the water and light show on the Bay and on the eight aide you’ll be able to see the Botanical gardens lights as well.

It is a great experience with a great value for your money.

Gotta do this at least once in your lifetime."
,,What a hotel,5.0,,"We have visited this hotel twice once at night and once in the daytime.
On the night time visit we took a look around the hotel then decided to pay the twenty or so dollars to go to the top.
It’s a stunning view and if you go at the right time you can also watch the later show in the bay.
The daytime visit we took a look around the hotel then made our way to the gardens that are fab in the day or night when they are all lit up."
,,You can see forever (almost)!,4.0,,"Located on the top of this iconic Singapore landmark, the views from the Skydeck are impressive. We booked dinner at the rooftop restaurant, and it was very expensive, but then the security guard wanted another $22 to go to the viewing area near the edge to take photos of the city. We couldn’t get a good close view from our table because of the people walking in front of us. The infinity pool looks impressive, access is rightly limited to hotel guests who are paying for the privilege.
Recommend going in the evening to see the lights of the city and the light show at the waterfront."
,,What a view,5.0,,After the Gardens the next 'must do' in Singapore. It is an Amazing Building with a breathtaking view from the top. I recommend to go up about half an hour before sunset so you get both views (daylight and nighttime).
,,Skypark visit,5.0,,It is a really fantastic view from sky park. You can see many skylines and landscape all around it. The only thing is cannot swim at the beautiful pool.
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit (if you are not scared of being so far off the ground)! Views are a must see and also check out the pool. Great place just to hang out for a while and appreciate your surroundings.
,,Wow,5.0,,Great views to all of Singapore and beyond to Indonesia and Malaysia. Green screen photo taken at bottom of lifts and ready by the time you reach floor 56. Photo of a lifetime. You can watch both light shows form the viewing platform although I would recommend watching them from below so that you hear the music and feel the atmosphere. We’ve done both.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Pleased we paid the $$ to go here as in one of those things just got to do in Singapore!! Had several cocktails but $22 entrance fee/credit was great to access the bar. We got there at 4.30pm on a sat afternoon and was starting to fill then, loved it!!!"
,,Not worth $20,4.0,,"We were unable to stay at the Marina Bay Sand so we were only allowed on the Sky Deck, it was super small but we had great views, but for $20 wish we had more access"
,,"Great view on a clear day, but not much else",3.0,,"We found the Skypark a little disappointing, the views were great (would have been better with improved visibility if less smog), but there is nothing else to do up there and no shade. We expected to be able to access the pool and have a drink at the bar, but these are reserved exclusively for hotel guests. So, instead of spending a leisurely couple of hours enjoying the Skypark, we only stayed about 15 minutes and felt a bit ripped off, plus the staff relentlessly try to get you to buy overpriced photography packages, which gets really annoying."
,,Sky high prices,3.0,,"It's a nice enough view but it's not the highest in Singapore; just the most iconic I guess. But you feel second class - you can't go in the famous infinity pool, you're confined to a tiny corner of the roof and worst of all, if you want an overpriced drink you can't go back onto the terrace....go but be prepared to be disappointed"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Amazing view probably best to go at dusk as you get to see the fountains lit up as well as the skyline the bar is a bit pricey but lots to see
,,This is the most outstanding hotel architecture you have ever seen!,5.0,,I know that it is expensive but take the elevator up to the observation deck. I love the infinity pool with the best view of Singapore. The whole construction is absolutely breathtaking and stunning!!! Do not forget to visit the interior of the hotel - e.g. the huge reception hall and all three towers.
,,You have to see this view!,5.0,,"Ok so if you go to Singapore you have to go to the top of Marina Bay Sands. Everyone wants the iconic photograph of the Singapore skyline. First tip, timing is everything. My suggestion is to go up at about 6.30. This way you will get a day photo with the sun setting and then a night photo after the sun sets at 7ish and all the lights come on. The iconic photo that was all over the internet of the infinity pool, can be taken as a guest of the hotel or, you can go into the public access rooftop bar (Ce la vi) and order a drink. There is a dress code. No open toe sandals or shorts for the guys. Or, you can pay an entrance fee and go to the public viewing gallery. When I was visuting, you could also book a table at Spago. They also have almost 360 views. Don’t miss looking at the other side away from city as you can get great photos of the South China Sea and the sunsets. After that, head down to the back of the hotel to a spot where you can see the City, right down on the waters edge. A free music and light show comes on a eight for most evenings. Hope you enjoy this great location."
,,Beautiful views of Singapore,5.0,,"I would highly recommend the rooftop view ! Gorgeous views of Singapore - you can see everything. On a clear day you can even see Malaysia It is incredibly warm up top, but if you’re not afraid of heights this is a must see."
,,Disappointing time,2.0,,Great views but you are not allowed to walk around the pool or bar area (hotel guests only) so for my money Singapore Flyer is better. Although having a drink in Ce La Vi and enjoying the views was nice.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"The views from up here at night are breathtaking. Definitely worth a visit, although the elevator situation is a bit of a mess. They need more elevators and/or larger elevators. Also the elevator attendants seem to slow down traffic rather than speed it up, frequently missing elevators when they arrive, and allowing them to leave empty, because they were distracted with herding people around."
,,A must see!,4.0,,Set atop the hotel this was a great place to view the city from.you can eat up here too but it is always busy.
,,Rip Off,2.0,,"Prices had been increased for CNY fireworks (even though we visited at day time) and there was no option for Singapore Airlines discount because of CNY. Therefore it cost $100 SGD for 2 adults and 2 kids to visit the observation deck. Once up there, it is a sparse deck with no seats or shade. Many people sitting on the floor. $10 for 2 soft serve ice cream cones (apparently they’d run out of cups) with no where to sit and eat them so they melted all over kids and floor (and me) within 5 minutes. Then no paper towels in the bathroom to clean up afterwards. View is great, but after 10 minutes, there’s nothing left to look at. Can think of much better family entertainment for $100!"
,,Observation deck is worth the majestic cityscape views,4.0,,"Definitely worth the price of admission. However, I misunderstood that the 57th floor is a lower observation deck to the posh penthouse level with pools and forest at the top of the building. To be clear, you will be a level down on an observation deck with great views, but not allowed into the upper tier. I'd recommend eating food first, as the hot dog stand on the 57th is a bit disappointing. There is also a full restaurant on the 57th floor observation deck, but be prepared to wait. Neat experience and city/bay views."
,,Infinity,4.0,,"Although a little crowed, its a must do whilst in Singapore. Get over to the edge of the pool and take an impressive selfie of you with Singapore in the background."
,,Lovely view from here,4.0,,The views from marina bay sands skypark are amazing and defiantly worth a visit. However it’s fairly expensive at about £20 each person but the hotel and skypark are very impressive buildings
,,Skypark daytime visit,4.0,,"We only had 4 hours to spend in Singapore from the time we left the airport. Straight to the main entrance of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Access to the skypark is at Tower 3 so to save a long walk through the shopping arcade past Tower 1 and 2 next time I would ask the taxi to drop us right at Tower 3 where the sky park entrance is located. There was no queue as it was daytime. One hassle was the photographers near the lift entrance. They try to encourage you to have your photo taken but I refused and walked straight past. The lift to the 56th floor was so fast it felt like we only went up three floors and not 56. I was dreading the crush in the lift but we were the only ones in the lift so it was a breeze. The view from the roof deck was amazing of course. There is no access to the infinity pool only though the hotel. There is a snack bar and gift shop on the roof deck and a bigger outside bar just above but they told me if you enter that bar you cannot re enter the viewing platform so again I declined. Why that should be the rule I do not know. After a short visit my daughter started to feel ill from the height so we went back down in the almost empty lift. By passed the aggressive photo sellers and brought a few mementos at the tiny gift shop near the entrance. The cost of entry was reduced for pensioners and children. 17 dollars for my daughter as she was under 12 and 20 dollars for me as I was a pensioner ( might be wrong about the pensioner concession perhaps it was a bit less than $20.), but there is also a special deal which includes the hop on hop off bus tour for one day which looks good. We did not use that service but we did enjoy some tasty french patisserie at the shop just inside near Tower 3 check in. We caught a taxi from there to the Merlion Statue which is not too far away just across the inlet. To get the most benefit I think if we had time we would have gone up at sunset to see the lights of Singapore come on. There is no time limit to how long you can stay up there. Toilets are handy and wheel chair access would be easy if you just wanted the viewing platform. Reading some of the other reviews I see if you just want to go to the roof top bar its free to go up and you can still see the views. (So that's why you cannot access the viewing platform from that bar). We just made it back to the Airport in four hours using the underground train in good time to check in for our flight."
,,Spectacular Views over Singapore,4.0,,"High on top of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands right next to huge infinity pool (please note only hotel guests have access to this pool) is the Sky Walk, an open air observation deck that affords spectacular and breathtaking views over Singapore Waterfront, Gardens by the Bay and Singapore itself. Soak in the beautiful city that is Singapore with its unique architecture and style and get a bird's eye from from the roof of one of the world's most aamazing looking and engineered hotels."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,You can go to the 56 floor of this hotel where you will get 360 degree views of Singapore and you also get a glimpse of the infinity swimming pool. The views are spectacular and it is a good place to see what sights are available to see. We just turned up and got tickets immediately
,,Great vantage point for some amazing pics!,4.0,,"Best to go early to avoid the long queues in the afternoon. Check the weather before you go, if its raining there's no shelter. Pop in to the Ce La Vie bar for some drinks, drinks aren't cheap but whilst you're there, why not?"
,,"great to see, I didn't ascend up.",4.0,,"Very cool feature down by the Marina, Looks like a forested boat stuck on three piers! Really cool, but I hear it is like $20 to go up."
,,Lovely view,4.0,,But very crowded. I went up in the evening on a Tuesday night. The Singapore skyline was lovely. It was jus very crowded.
,,"Not cheap, much better Singapore Flyer",4.0,,"3 reasons:
1) skypark admission is cheaper - Per head is $23, $20 for above 65. Not cheap. The flyer is charging crazy $33, in general, most of the attractions in Singapore are over priced. Skypark would increased the price by +$5 during the Lunar New Year period. However the experience is so much better Flyer
2) SkyPark is taller - Height of sky-park is 200 m, where as Flyer is 165 m. Not much, but the strategic location made a big different.
3) SkyPark offer more excitement, educational and photo opportunity - I personally feel the Flyer experience is boring and with less than 15 mins at the top to observe the buildings, difficult to take good photo inside the capsule, the entire journey is only half an hour. Whereas at the skylark one can walk around the observation deck at leisure soak in the panoramic view of the city with vantage point, take photos, stay as long as wish. Read interpretive and identify various buildings even even have a drink. If you are lucky during special occasions there’s also fireworks spectacular, but I imagine it would be super crowded. If you are interested in Singapore’s this is a must do!"
,,Incredible,4.0,,If you are a shopaholic and Casino lover then this is the best place in Singapore to visit for very high brand for shopping.
,,Worthwhile if you are a MBS guest,4.0,,"SkyPark offers a nice view of the entire Singapore skyline (and some of Indonesia too). Good if you are a guest of MBS, as this will entitle you entry to the infinity pool, which is also quite nice (not very crowded on the Sunday afternoon that we went)."
,,views views views,5.0,,"One of the best views in Singapore. Hopefully you know someone that is staying in the hotel and you can borrow their key to have a look at the pool; you won't be able to see it otherwise. It's expensive, but so is everything else."
,,Not that great,3.0,,You will view this building anyhow if you are traveling from any point in singapore. Not that great a place
,,Stunning on a clear day,5.0,,A must to do on this distinctive building in Singapore that has the city at your feet. Great for photographers and shows how dynamic the city is on a day to day basis.
,,Expensive,1.0,,"The views are nice but not sure if it is worth the admission (about $A55 for two people). There is no re-entry even on the same day. We went in the daytime but I suggest going in the night for a good photo of the gardens by the bay. Forget about the Infinity Pool, you will only get a glimpse of it from the sky park. It is also confusing getting to the sky park as there are signs pointing you to go up one tower but the only entrance (for visitors) is via tower 3 at Basement 2."
,,Humongous 3 tower resort on the marina - perfect for strolling thru,5.0,,"While we didn't stay at the Marina Sands hotel, this 3 story complex is even bigger than it looks from a distance. While it was very busy during the time we went (Chinese New Year), we had only a very slight wait taking the elevator up to the Sky Bar. Note it's $23 to go to the observation deck only, but $22 to go to the Sky Bar, and the $22 is applied to food or drink, with a cocktail averaging about this much. Restaurant atop which I reviewed separately. Down below on the ground and bayfront area is a mammoth shopping mall with many high end shops, several restaurants, a food court, theater complex, and a casino. Wonderful place to wander around for several hours, and other attractions such as the gardens are close by."
,,Expensive,4.0,,"This is technically a must see. I’m glad I did it, wouldn’t have missed it, but I’m still stinging from the price. A magnificent view yes. There is no access to the other two hotel zones, and this is what I had hoped for. Not just the front of the ship, so to speak.
As I said I’ve now done it, ticked the box, negotiated down the price of the photo against a green screen on entry etc. Just make sure you don’t go home thinking,
‘I wish I’d done it, and now I never will.’
Swallow the hefty Singapore Dollar pill, it helps the local economy."
,,Get a birdseye view of Singapore from here.,5.0,,"We went up to the observation viewing deck and were blown away with the excellent views of singapore, the sky gardens by the bay in fact most of Singapore. Maybe we were lucky but there was no wait time for tickets and no crowds on the actual deck. There is a restuarant up there if you want to book. Cost $23 ticket with concession for us pensioners to $20. They will take your photo before you go up and it is there when you get to the top from the left. Didn't feel hasseled to buy it but I did because it was a lovely photo."
,,great views,4.0,,"took the night tour which brought us up to the top. Great views and photo ops. We were lucky as it was not too crowded, but we were told that it can get very crowded with long lines"
,,Make the right choice,2.0,,"On the evening (mid January) that we visited the deck we were being told downstairs that there were two options:

1. visit to the observation deck
2. visit to the bar (also situated on top of the building)

On the question whether you would have the same view, we were being told by a staff member that this would be the case. It turned out that this was not true.
So if you would like to enjoy the view, I would recommend you to go for option 1. Option 1 is also cheaper and you might be able to see the rooftop pool as we could not."
,,From shopping to dining experience,5.0,,Want to have a full 360 view of Singapore? This is the best place to be. You can even dine here but would strongly recommend to book in advance. Don't feel like spending but would love to see what's in store? Check out their stores from boutique to jewellery stores in the same building.
,,View goals!,5.0,,"Had to visit this place for the views, and to see the iconic rooftop pool. Drinks were great, but very busy, so had to stand most of the time. Great vibe and tunes playing. A must see when in Singapore."
,,A must see,5.0,,"Expensive at SD28 pp but you gotta do it , although booking a meal at one of the rooftop restaurants might be a good alternative. Fantastic views, just see the photos."
,,A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"This was our second stop over in Singapore on our way home from Oz. We had seen the amazing Marina Bay Sands Hotel but this time we wanted to go to the top. 56 floors up and views were amazing. The hotel is a feat of engineering and the ‘ship’ shaped SkyPark is awesome.
The Ce La Vie bar was expensive, but then alcoholic drinks in Singapore are expensive everywhere. A lager and Singapore Sling was consumed before we plummeted back to ground level.
This is definitely a must see/do while you’re here so don’t miss out. Do it!!"
,,Definitely worth visiting,5.0,,"Once in Singapore, it is a must see! Choose a sunny day and of course avoid rain... The view is amazing. The cost is 30SGD along with a complimentary frozen Singappre sling."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"This is an aerial viewing platform that is a good as they come.
If the weather is good you can see all of the shipping lanes and most of Singapore City.
It is well worth the money.
If you fancy a beer at the top it’s over six quid for a half in a plastic cup !!!!
Or you can go in the restaurant/bar and pay more but bizarrely they will not let you back out onto the viewing platform.The logic of this defeated me so we stuck with the plastic cups of beer.
Great location got to be done!"
,,SkyPark Observation Deck view,5.0,,"The Skypark observation deck is located on the topmost floor of the Marina Bay Sands and offers magnificent views of the city and bay area in Singapore. There is an entry fee of about 25 SGD for adults. An elevator service is used to reach the observation deck.
A visit during evening hours is highly recommended to catch glimpses of sunset followed by the evening illumination of surrounding areas, light and sound fountain show. A breezy evening adds to the beauty of this location."
,,Beautiful View from Top,5.0,,"Our $20 ticket included the elevator ride to the sky park but also gave us a $20 credit to the bar. The views of Singapore are spectacular from the top. We use the credit and had the signature Singapore sling, delicious. Well worth the visit."
,,Incredible Views,5.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to the Skypark the views are incredible. It was great picking out where we had already been.
,,Amazing Vista’s,5.0,,53 floors up on tower 3. 360 degree views of the city was amazing. Definitely worth doing. Bought the photo package as well.
,,A must go in Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful and you can really feel the genius of Singapore's leader in advancing the economy and standards for Singapore. There is a Feng shui element in everything.. Read up on it! very very interesting... hint"" the 3 towers are actually Altars and the top is actually a ship"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark - Observation Deck,4.0,,We enjoyed walking around the Marina Bay Sands Skypark (Observation Deck) to take photos. We preferred to arrive there 30 minutes prior to sunset.
,,Singapore view from.the roof,5.0,,Its the roof top of the hotel marina bay sands.A beautiful birds view if Singapore. Best time is to go by 5pm.abd see with out lights and stay till 7pm.to see all lights litted in down Singapore buildings.the hotel allows at the basement to get tickets to go to the roof area for.the view.you can explore the hotel grounds too..and shop if you want.Can get connected to MRT to your to be area from.the ground floor. ..a must see one ..in the evening .
,,Great both during the day and at night,5.0,,One of the best places to be.its safe and outstanding but quite overcrowded by selfie lovers.very impressive with the lights
,,Really good 😊,5.0,,Really enjoyed my time here it can get very busy so I try and morning time. It can also get hot around the grounds so take water etc.
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Great views of a beautiful city, After seeing Crazy Rich Asians we had to go to the Skypark. A little disappointing to only view from about 1/4 of the structure, due to the rest is reserved for hotel guests only. Very clean, very open a must see if in Singapore."
,,Great views at a price,4.0,,Unless you are resident at the Marina Sands hotel there is a $23SGD pp charge ($20SGD for seniors) to take the express lift to the top - the 360 views are stunning but chose a clear day or better still go just before sunset and take in the day and night views - there is a bar and restaurant up here but prices are as high as the deck itself and your ticket does not allow you entry to the infinity pool - just a tip Standard Charters and Citi Bank premium cards and Singapore Airlines have 15% discount concessions but it did not apply to us so I am unsure how it works - also the Shoppes and Mall at the ground floors are excellent and a great place to spend a few hours especially if it is raining and it is free!
,,Worth the trip up,4.0,,Provides a great view over Singapore and worth the trip up. Do not think about having a beer or wine up there as the prices are ridiculous.
,,Great views of city & bay,4.0,,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so it was complementary with our room stay otherwise it’s $23.00 Singapore dollars pp.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Views over the CBD and gardens are very good, though better if you go on a very clear day or at night, cloudy doesn't do it justice."
,,Wow: Views to die for,4.0,,"Eyewateringly pricey beer, but the best views anywhere in the area and well worth the expense. Actually, everything is expensive, from car parking to snacks, but still a unique experience and worth puishing the boat out (gedditt??)."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Worth the visit. Beautiful by day or night and it's great to go for a drink at dusk and see both. They charge $20 a person to go up, but you get a voucher for that much to be used for drinks so not bad. Spectacular views both inland and towards the sea. Service is a little rough, but it's a stampede every day all day."
,,GLITTER AND FIZZ,5.0,,"The swimming pool is the highlight of this place. And hey, a platform that looks like an airplane connecting three hotels? Yeah, it's a great attraction!!"
,,Great views,5.0,,"Great way to see around Singapore, we went up mid afternoon. Not too busy plenty of room to move around the obversation deck with ease. Easy efficient lifts to get to the top, had some great photos taken whilst there by the staff, highly recommend"
,,A must do,5.0,,"Great views and a must if it's your first time visiting Singapore. Definitely aim to visit around early evening (between 6.30-8pm) catch a glimpse of daytime and nightime as then you get both views, which are amazing. Plus around 8pm there is a lighting show below, which looks great from the towers.

The ticket is a little steep but its honestly worth it, and plus its Singapore, generally things are pricey here."
,,Breathtaking views!,5.0,,"The buildind itself is impressive from the outside and its inside. One can get nice views from the South part of Singapore, and they get better at night!"
,,Experience in luxurity,4.0,,"The truth is that we had to spend a lot of money just for one night...but if someone wants to indulge in luxurity is the right place..the best swimming pool ever but only the habitants can use..i was quite disappointed with the breakfast because in international cusine there wasnt enough variety in cakes,pancakes etch...this is how i am dreaming the ideal breakfast... :)"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This is amazing 20 dollars each to get to the top off sky park, Well worth the trip the views are amazing,and the shopping is amazing."
,,Full of people having a great time,4.0,,"We decided to have a drink up at the top, and enjoyed the views which were panoramic. The skypark is crowded and a bit windy, but the views were spectacular."
,,view,5.0,,"Amazing view of the city, the restaurant and bar is a fun place to sip and enjoy few drinks. Gorgeous hotel and the view is stunning of the city and the bay and the gorgeous gardens..."
,,Not worth on observation deck,2.0,,"It’s quite over prized considering the service on top, paid SGD 23. Not saying the place isn’t good, the place is nice and one should definitely visit but it is not worth vide observation deck admission. Try exploring through Ce La VI, it’s much better and you get the drinks with the money you paid to get on top (caution: knew through other reviews, didn’t experience myself)."
,,Good views of the light show,4.0,,If you can get on the Skypark when the light show is on it provides a different perspective of the show. Good views of the Gardens if you don’t mind heights.
,,Well worth it !,5.0,,"So best way to enter is from the main entrance to the hotel; entrance for the Skypark is to the right. It’s cheap compared with what you get - I think we paid 15SGD. Lift to the 57th floor takes around 2mins - super fast, your ears will pop ! If you have a fear of bights, don’t worry, you’ll be fine. Views are outstanding, almost 360 of whole Singapore City Centre. There is a cafe at the top etc. Well recommended!"
,,Fabulous view,5.0,,"Pay the 20 $ and visit the Cest La Vi bar, nice bar areas, great view, seating and the $ are then deducted from and food/drink you purchase. Better value than the observation deck"
,,Nice view on Marina Bay,5.0,,"The view is nice, made tons of great shots! Also there is an ice cream stand that totally was a great add on"
,,Did not go at the top,5.0,,"It is an extremely interestingly architected building. A visual extravaganza to eyes! Comes in life at night with lights which is must see. Upscale shopping malls, dining and tons of photo ops make it a place to go. One should try out the Venetian experience at basement where you can do Gondola ride...overall a good time spent."
,,Breath taking views,5.0,,We visited via the high speed lift in the evening. Highly recommended with AMAZING VIEWS. The skyline at night was awesome. It took our breath away. Great views looking north.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"amazing views over Singapore in 360%, Located on the 57th Floor at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel this place is simple amazing. You can also enjoy a cool drink whilst taking in the amazing 360% views over Singapore. I would also strongly recommend checking out the view at night as well as day light because it is a completely different view of the city. If visiting its a MUST. You get great views of the Marina Bay Gardens, Singapore Grand Prix track, City and the beautiful harbor. Treat yourself if visiting Singapore"
,,Hotel with gambling,4.0,,This is a beautiful hotel (they'll charge you to go up to the top) that offers gambling and was recently featured in the movie Crazy Rich Asians.
,,A high light.,5.0,,"Watched the first illuminated display of the evening, of the Supertrees, from the viewing deck also saw the musical fountains."
,,Incredible Building,5.0,,"Very busy on the evening we went and found it hard to get near some of the view points. Bought our tickets on line which included a Singapore Sling but was actually more like a slush puppy.
We enjoyed our time up there but did prefer the Singapore Flyer for the views."
,,The View is Spectacular,4.0,,"The cost to travel up the elevator to the top on the 57th floor seemed a bit steep. However, the entire admission price went towards a full creit on the purchase of food or drinks once you got to the top. Then you are free to enjoy spectacular views of almost all that Singapore has to offer."
,,Marina Bay Sands - Celavi Sky Bar - Service not good at all,2.0,,"Paid $80 for a family of four to view 57th floor sky deck. Spectacular view of Singapore though only get a glimpse of the infinity pool. Went to have a drink at the CeLaVi bar, service was very disappointing for such a high class place. Waitress not very helpful or friendly. Ordered a Stella beer and it was not full. Then only one sip in and they bring me the bill. Seems like they want to turn over customers quickly. Won’t be coming her again."
,,Not worth a visit,1.0,,"The Skypark is obviously an icon of Singapore but if you aren’t staying at the hotel it is not worth a visit anymore as you can’t walk around the pool anymore unless you are a guest.

It costs approx $20 and you are restricted to a small area down one end of the “park”. You don’t have access to the pool area, garden, park etc. This is now only for hotel guests (even if you pay the $20 entry fee). The view is no better than other nearby hotels such as the Oriental, or the nearby “Ferris wheel”. Obviously this is better for hotel guests, but it does mean it’s not worth a $20 visit for those not staying at the hotel.

You used to be able to walk around the pool area and that was worth the visit but not now that it is restricted.

It’s also super busy - even walking through the hotel lobby is stressful as there’s so many people. It’s like a loud obstacle course. It feels like the hotel itself has become a tourist attraction not a temporary “home” for guests."
,,C’est la vie offers better value,4.0,,"Rather than pay $23 to go to the viewing platform , go to C’est la vie and pay $20 for a voucher redeemable against food and drink. You are one floor further up, can get right up next to the pool area and redeem the voucher for a beer or top it up for a cocktail. No contest."
,,Nice View from Top Deck,4.0,,Nice views of Singapore skyline. We enjoyed the visit with family.However we felt that the place was too commercial.
,,Views Amazing,5.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore, the views at the top are amazing. We did find it a little confusing on how to get to it but just asked the lovely friendly people of Singapore & they pointed us in the right direction."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"This is a must visit when in Singapore. The view from the top is incredible, the infinity pool is so relaxing and enjoyable. I will be back"
,,Lovely city wide views,5.0,,"We were on a brief stop over so wanted to see the city, and we saw most of it from this observation deck! Fantastic views and lovely helpful staff, well worth a visit."
,,Exceptional....not to be missed,5.0,,one would need plenty of time to strol through this amazing park...it comes to life in the evening the lights come on...Do not leave Singapore without a visit to this place
,,The view from the top amazing.,5.0,,"Second time have been here, and this place still amazes me, the architect is just unbelievable. The view from the top amazing. We just went up and had a drink at the bar and enjoyed the view, although you can pay viewing platform, there is no need you can view from the bars, second bar we went in took some photos and left didn't buy a drink.. Drinks are expensive was $26 NZ for a stubbie of Carlsberg, but with a view like that it was worth it!"
,,Stunning Views - Free!!,5.0,,Spectacular views from the viewing platform. Do not understand why people pay when Tower 3 takes you up to the 57th floor for nothing. Can be windy and coolish but worth a visit.
,,Great views,5.0,,Dining and drinking at the rooftop bars is expensive. The best option is to buy the $20 ticket for the viewing platform. There are plenty of shops and eating areas on the ground floor area.
,,Don't waste your money,1.0,,"The Skypark (observation deck) is 23 SGD and to me, a complete waste of money. Very windy, crowded and you can see these views from other places in SG without paying this ridiculous price."
,,Lavo,4.0,,"We could not visit Singapore this time without visiting the Marina Sands Bay Hotel and dining in the Italian restaurant, Lavo. Whilst I have had better Italian food the experience of being on the top of this iconic building made it worthwhile. Also a pleasure was watching the colourful water fountain display below and reminded me of the great shows that were once available on Sentosa Island."
,,Be very careful before booking,3.0,,"It cost 20 dollars to go to the top viewing platform. However, we went up free by going to the tower 3 bar where for 26 dollars you get a cocktail as well and the same view. They also serve good food though some dishes are a bit pricey. Also there is a restaurant on the same level (top). So I can't really see the point of doing it!"
,,Fun and Enjoying the Architechtural Design,4.0,,"It was fun and at the same time conquerring my fear of heights! Beautiful up above! Though you need to walk in a very long distance but worth walking for. Recommended with small kid, but you need to bring stroller."
,,Nice view but ticket price is too high,3.0,,"The view is nice but that's pretty much about it. I got bored in 15 mins. So for me the price seems too high just for the ""view"". And if it rains there's no place to hide under, so do bring umbrellas & raincoats."
,,New icon of Singapore?,5.0,,There's no doubt this structure dominates the skyline especially with the infinity pool and sky park on top of the 3 hotel buildings supporting what resembles a ship in the sky. The views from the top is unmatched anywhere else in Singapore. It has become a must to visit. What is phenomenal? the international breakfast buffet in the lobby atrium; manned by chefs at different food stations to whip up your favorites no matter what part of the world you came from.
,,Great view of Singapore,5.0,,"The view from up there is stunning, especially of the gardens by the bay, can truly appreciate how big Singapore is from up there"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark - Infinity Pool,5.0,,"Seize the day to experience THE moment. Take in fantastic views of Singapore's city skyline, especially during the sunset moments where the colourful city lights start to make the city sight magical. Swim in the famous infinity pool or just relax by the decks on the pool chairs and enjoy being on top of the world. Sometimes, words just do not do justice, compared to being there to experience it yourself. A must do."
,,Marina bay,5.0,,This is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon. It is amazing area. The location and amenities very fine and will highly recommend this area. Very easy access from MRT
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Amazing to see the city lights from up here.. Marina Bay Sands sky park offers such an amazing view of the city.
,,Part of tour,4.0,,"The view from the SkyPark is breathtaking. As it was our first trip to Singapore, it was a great way to see the city at night."
,,To infinity and beyond,5.0,,"The SkyPark sits at level 57 of the stunning Marina Bay Sands integrated resort, and it literally overlooks the entire city. It is breath-taking and it only costs $20 to get up there if you’re not a hotel guest! Go and take a swim at the infinity pool!"
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,So pretty! The whole city is laid out before your eyes. Another option is to have reservations at C'est La Vie Restaurant for drinks and enjoy the view as well. No need to buy tickets for the Skypark.
,,View the city from this place,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands Sky Park offers great view of the City of Singapore from above. This is a large wooden decked area on top of Marina Bay Sands hotel. This hotel is located at the edge of the city’s harbor. A 360-degree panorama view is stunning. Marina Bay Sands SkyPark is one of the most popular attractions in Singapore. Entrance for adults is S$23. A preferred destination for any traveler.
,,Excellent View Of Marina Bay And To The Gardens & Sea,4.0,,"From the Bar there is an excellent view of the whole of the Marina Bay Area.

Best timing, is to wait until weather forecast is good and then go up at 6:30 PM to 07:30 PM when it is cooler and the sunsets, so get view of both day and night. View / photos are better at night time.

When you leave, exit out through the back of the bar, which takes you to a viewing point for the other side. From here you can see the domes at ‘Gardens by the Bay’, to the Sea, etc."
,,20 bux to view or 500 to stay?,5.0,,"We did the latter, and I do not regret it, although I am sure many people may. The hotel looks good on the outside but the rooms are not so fancy. Only the pool up there was the drawing in factor, the wife and I spent a few days in other hotels before spending a few days here, and only for the pool access."
,,Beat the Cost,4.0,,"I can’t swallow paying S$20 a head to see the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. It just galls me to think of it. I do understand why Marina Bay Sands would charge a hefty sum; if they didn’t every visitor to town would head up there, perhaps multiple times. I also understand why drinks with that view are high-priced; they’re also high-priced at Bangkok’s SkyBar, which has a comparable view. Singapore, like many other port cities, affords some terrific views, if only you get high enough. But in Sydney you can get a thrilling view simply by walking halfway across the Harbour Bridge, for free. In Valparaiso you can get one simply by going up one of the cerros for free (Concepcion comes to mind); in San Francisco, by going up one of the hills for free (Telegraph comes to mind). And more to the point, you can get views of Singapore and the straits (and Sumatra on a clear day) from Mount Faber or vantage points on the Southern Ridges walk, for free. I will grant you that Marina Sands has a spectacular infinity pool up there, (though non-guests can’t use it) and a virtual monopoly on views of the Marina Bay and downtown, looking north. Probably not a bad place to be during Formula One either, if you’ve got a telescope. However, if you absolutely must get up to that roof and see that view, I have two recommendations for a more cost-savings approach:

Plan A: Book a room at the Marina Bay Sands, for heaven’s sake! If not for your entire stay, just book for your first night or two. Let’s say you and your significant other are travelling together. Book in, unpack, and immediately head up to catch that view. Head up again at sunset, and later at night for fireworks or star-gazing. The next morning head up bright and early to catch the view at dawn, and then head up again in the afternoon to take a swim. The view from the edge of the infinity pool is pretty awesome, which is why you often see “swimmers” lined up along the north edge of the pool (see Infinity Pool photo). Right, then head up again in the late afternoon to catch the sunset. And head back up a few hours later to catch the late-night view with the lights of Singapore spread out below you and/or a fireworks show. The next morning, you can head up one more time to catch a sunrise, and again after breakfast, just before you check out. Let’s see now: $20 a head for tickets … there’s 2 of you … you both went up 9 times … you just saved S$360 compared to doing all that if you weren’t a hotel guest! Apply that S$360 as an offset to the cost of the room! Plus, the view from inside your room is likely to be quite fine too, and you can look out your window without suffering claustrophobia from the crowd, so it’s considerably more romantic (see View from Room photo).

Plan B: Tell a friend of yours how incredible the view is, and talk him or her into booking themselves a room at the Sands. Then, as soon as they book in, meet them in the lobby and ask to borrow their card for a quarter-hour. Cost to you: not a single blessed thing. Well, OK, maybe a friendship. But hey, at least you got the view absolutely free!"
,,Views,5.0,,"Amazing views across Singapore, highly recommend evening visit to get the best views. Queues up and down went quick. Toilet facilities on the top if needed. Lovely building and worth a visit up to see Singapore at night."
,,Views over Singapore from thic Iconic building,4.0,,It was great if you jus wanted to have the view over the city. Although pretty much the same view from the Singapore flyer. I was disappointed as it does not allow access to the pool deck which is what mistakely expected. The skydeck is just for views. So u can skip if you are doing the flyer
,,56th Floor View,5.0,,It was a great experience! The view from the skypark is the best. The elevator ride was fast just 2 minutes I think. Will come back again if I get the chance.
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,Visit the skypark just for a great view of the city. You are not allowed into the pool area as it's restricted to guests only.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,As you can imagine the view is fantastic up there. We were staying in the hotel so if you don't it's worth doing this.
,,Amazing view!,4.0,,"After visiting the Gardens by The Bay we walked across to the Marina Bay Sands hotel - on the ground floor we bought a ticket for 20 Singapore dollars each which gave access to a lift for non residents. The lift arrives right at the top of the hotel where the bar is, there is the most amazing view of both the city and the Gardens by the Bay.

The bar was naturally very busy, great music, good vibe - we managed to find a table around the bar area, ordered drinks and watched the sun go down. The ticket for the lift is then used to buy a drink (all drinks are the price of the ticket or more - I would say not as expensive as the drinks at Raffles!).

You can walk around to another bar area which has the view of the iconic infinity pool - the pool is for hotel residents only. Staff friendly and helpful, a must do whilst you are in Singapore!"
,,Incredible views.,5.0,,"A must do when in Singapore, beautiful amazing views to watch The Garden by the Bay night show. Well worth it."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,The most spectacular view over Singapore and on of the best view ever (we went at the Skypark at about 6 o'clock p.m.and we had a wonderful view during day and night over Singapore).
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Wow what a view it was beautiful very nice to go up their the elevators were very fast it's very expensive for a drink or food up there but we thought it was worth it
,,Exellent,5.0,,amazing place has good rooftop night club n bar n Italian restaurant n wht a view of the Bay. Bars serve amazing cocktails n French fries too.
,,Incredible panoramic views,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Skypark observation deck is located on the 57th level of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is the largest observation deck that I’ve ever seen. The views from it are stunningly amazing.
,,Lovely view of Singapore’s Marina Bay,5.0,,"Lovely view from the 56th floor of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel and free for hotel guests. Worth a visit, one can have a 360 degrees view of the Marina Bay, overviewing the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, Arts and Sciences Museum and all the amazing SG skyscrapers."
,,Beautiful and busy,4.0,,"Amazing architecture but very busy with guests checking in and out walked around a lot, would have loved to seen the pool at the top but didn't have enough money with us to pay to view it."
,,The view,5.0,,"Main reason for stay in Marina Bay Sands was Infinity Pool, it was no other option for us to discuss."
,,Another Landmark of Singapore,4.0,,Marina Bay Sand Park is one of most attractive landmark of Singapore. Every visitor goes there and enjoy photography. Most people bypass it's top visit view of Singapore because of entrance ticket. There is beautiful restaurant on the top area where visitors can view Singapore.
,,A very special place,5.0,,"We stopped off for two nights on our way to New Zealand as a treat on our way and it really was a treat.
The room, staff and services were first class and the infinity pool was where we spent most of our time in the day and especially the night, it really is something special.
Service was excellent at all levels and would thoroughly recommend spoiling yourselves and making a visit."
,,Wow! What a view.,4.0,,"Visited the skypark observation deck, floor 56, yesterday. I thought the price was a bit high until I seen the view. Wow! Worth every dollar. Only knock is that you can't really get a lunch or drink there. There is a bar/restaurant but is restricted to hotel guests. There is a small snack counter if you want a cookie or a hot dog (yuck). Definitely loved the view though."
,,Excellent view from the top,5.0,,You must visit this place in the evening. Relax at the 56th floor with drinks and nice Singapore Skyline. The colorful lights in Garden By the bay ..soothes one's eyesight.
,,Best Experience!,5.0,,Going to Singapore this was on our bucket list to do. We were not disappointed! Welcome photo beautifully presented in black leather display (at additional cost) and the view was amazing! Well worth the trip up 56 floors!
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,Marina Bay sands skypark gives you an amazing view of the singapore city. Getting there is very easy.
,,"The views are great, service so-so...",3.0,,"Looking at the Marina Bay Sands from anywhere in Singapore is quite impressive, thankfully there's a chance to go on top without being a guest.
you can enter the MBS Skypark after paying $20,- , you can use this voucher to order a drink at the bar/restaurant.

As said, the views are impressive, the crowds as well but in a negative way....
It attracts so many people that ordering a drink/food will take some time, service is really not that good as elsewhere in Singapore.
Also the prices are rather steep, as expected of course...

But again, the crowds are really annoying."
,,Good for short visit,5.0,,Views from the top are amazing. you can see around the city from the top. There may be a queue while coming back but I believe it is worth it overall
,,Shocked by a rude member of staff!,2.0,,"We were looking forward to have a few drinks in the sky bar C'est La Vie! To see the views of Singapore and what everyone raved about.
However we did not expect to be spoken to in such a rude and abrupt manner and on 2 separate occasions to two different members of our group.
Although the views were spectacular, it ruined our experience of it.
You don't expect that attitude and manner from a member of staff from that level of hotel. So we were very disappointed!"
,,Amazing views of Singapore,4.0,,"If you want to see the whole of Singapore this is a great trip. Only one up and down, I would have loved to go in day and night to see different views but only went in day because I wouldn’t pay twice for the experience. I am scared of heights but didn’t feel unsafe at all.
Well worth the visit"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"We went up to the sky park, fantastic views, no limit to how long you can stay. We decided to have a Singapore sling at the bar, quite pricey but worth it, lovely music and atmosphere. Dining is also available but with the bar and restaurant you can't take pics once in those areas. Definitely worth a visit"
,,MARINA BAY SANDS SKYPARK,5.0,,"amazing views across marina bay at night all lit up 57 floors up a great experience never to forget ,see singapore flyer and the light show of gardens by the bay ,beware of photo trap on way up 60 dollars approx £ 35.oops."
,,O M G!!!!!,5.0,,"View, view, view. No more words. Best experience and do buy the slushie Singapore sling to slurp on whilst taking in the sights."
,,The View,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is absolutely amazing with a view that is breath-taking. It does cost to go up to the observation deck and probably is best done without the expensive cocktail..
,,A must visit place while in Singapore,5.0,,An amaing view from the top of this property. Very massive mall inside with all expensive brands. A very well decorated inside . would be more enjoyable around evening time with lighting.
,,A MUST-DO,5.0,,"It is so typical, but yet someting you GOT to do! Stayed up there for a while...Went early, when it is not so crowded( gets crazy after 19.00) Found a nice table by the edge and sipped my cocktail, enjoying the view at first , then the sunset and the colourful lights coming on bit by bit!Cant imagine why anyone would go for the observation deck! (It is more expensive there, and you do not get a drink voucher for your money!). Of course it is impossible to visit the pool, but you can get close, get photos and watch the lucky ones !"
,,Huge place and worth visiting for the experience,4.0,,"This place is huge very easy to get lost in. We ate and drank at the food hall all good. We also went up to the top and viewed the city. Very high up there so if your scared of heights don't go!! We went in the day time but i would rather have gone at night, i think you would enjoy the experience so much more. You can see the gardens by the bay, which are entered from in this building."
,,must visit,5.0,,it is expensive it is a touristy place but its is BEAUTIFULLLLLL.come around 5-6pm in the evening to catch both the day and night view and sunset view. you have never been to singapore if you have not been here.
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,"What Stunning views and a supper speedy elevator! 54 floors and didn’t notice the time but it wAs super smooth. Love the whole area. A shame only guests can visit the pool, maybe invent a day pass? Anyway top quality whoever did the design very imaginative."
,,Love it!,4.0,,"Have taken visitors there a few times. The best tip, if one is able - time your visit around dusk when the sky changes from after sunset to night. You get to see two different views - before and after the city skyline gets lighted up.

Best to go by public transport. Even with a huge carpark, at times no lots available especially during weekends with musical shows on."
,,A must,5.0,,You get a great view of the city and a lot of the sights. You also can look at the pool on the top of hotel. The only other way to see pool is to be a guest of the hotel
,,Beautiful view!,5.0,,"Is a gorgeous view at night, so just go, chill and walk around maybe drink a beer in a bar, make some photos and enjoy the colors."
,,First time visit,4.0,,What an amazing experience!! Another top class presentation in Singapore. Well worth the effort to take the ride to the top of the Marina Bay Hotel. Another must do next time you are In Singapore
,,A beautiful view,5.0,,"A beautiful view and a great experience. I recommend going in the morning around 10am to avoid a crowd, we were able to go straight from buying tix to the rooftop, whilst at night you are given a time stamp and have to wait."
,,Expensive but wow,5.0,,"We paid $20 to go up to the 57th floor, the money is redeemable for a drink when you get up there, however most drinks are more than $20 so be prepared to pay extra on top.
Fantastic views across the city, watched day turn into evening and even got a storm of thunder and lightening which was quite cool, not enough seats for the amount of people they let in but there are 2 areas you can go to have a drink and take in the views, one side is overlooking the hotel infinity pool and the other one is at the opposite end looking at star flyer and gardens by the bay.
For me this is somewhere I had on my hit list to do and so for me it was worth it others might think it too expensive for what it is."
,,Iconic Building,5.0,,This is a must do for anyone visiting Singapore. Yes the drinks are dear as you would expect but the views and location are stunning. Well worth doing.
,,Possibly the most destinctive building in the world,4.0,,An amazing building to see inside and out. I couldn't afford a room so can't judge their standard but guests get exclusive access to the great vantage points and the amaxing infinity pool. The story of how they designed and built it is worth reading.
,,Amazing view of city!,4.0,,"The views from the Skypark are certainly spectacular! Just be ware -- you can only go to the bar or only to the area outside the bar, but not both! If you pay to go up to the bar, it includes $20 toward a drink; but you cannot go down to the main observation area. While the ticket person will tell you it's the same view, it's definitely not as good as the main observation area. It's $24 to go to the main observation area - which is what I recommend."
,,Part of the deal..,4.0,,If you are curious about MBS then you will do all the things related to it. I am still in awe about how it holds that infinity pool and everyone in it!
,,Great views,4.0,,"Fabulous views from the Skypark especially of the gardens. Ticket includes viewing only not access to the infinity pool. You can buy an included drink but it's really not worth it as you have to stand in a special area to drink it and can't wander around to look at the view.

We were there mid December and there were no queues and hardly anyone up top.

I'd try and go on sunset for the magical views."
,,Once ok.,3.0,,For the First time travellers to Singapore this is a must see. However once seen it's really not a bucket list.
,,Go on a clear day!~,5.0,,Beautiful place to take photos and get a scenic view of Singapore. It costs $20 and includes ONLY the Skypark and not the bar or the infinity pool. We took some fabulous photos!
,,a unique architecture and experience,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a unique place - the mall is enormous - it has 4 levels of stores and restaurants, and food court, and everything you want. It is extremely clean, and it is almost always busy.

The restaurant selection is very wide - from French to Singapore cuisine, bars and children places.

I fully recommend to visit at least once. We usually spent here between 1-2 hrs, and longer if we were taking dinner at one of their restaurants."
,,Fantastic views of the tree grove,4.0,,Not for those who are afraid of heights. Great views of Singapore and the beautiful tree grove at sunset.
,,An architecture Marvel,5.0,,"A visit will give you many views on its Luxury, Beauty, Architecture and a whole Awesomeness. The observatory deck give clear view of the Singapore, to do after sun set"
,,best view in town,4.0,,"worth the visit to see the city and surroundings, easy to get in (need to pay on site ) and you are only allowed at one end, no access to the pool or guest areas unfortunately"
,,Fab view,5.0,,Perfect birds eye view for those who can’t afford to stay there. Reasonable price with a restaurant/bar to enjoy the view
,,"More of the same, from above",3.0,,"By the time you get to the terrace, you'll have your eyes full of colours and impressed with the incredible Marina Bay skyline.
Well, here is nothing new, except for the ticket you paid and the angle of vision.
The ironic twist is that from tge terrace you can't see the iconic Sands three-towered building (you actually stand on top of it), but the picture they take of you at the entrance of the elevator and try and sell you as a souvenir when you exit the elevator has the 3 towers in the background.
Not a must do if you are short of time, go to the gardens instead."
,,Nice view,4.0,,Nice place to visit and have refresment drinks with nice view. Entry fee includes voucher which can be used in the bar. Place worth of visit
,,Great views,5.0,,Well organized. No queues. Great views over Singapore. Signs about explaining the vistas. Easy to walk around and plenty of space to view the city. We signed up for the Marina Sands Rewards program — it is free — and received a 20% discount. Pleased we went here.
,,Me and Tessa,5.0,,It is a huge shopping mall and a lot of restaurants as well as food courts. It is surrounded with museum and a lot of coffee shop.
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,"An experience to behold. Go to the Sky Deck for unsurpassed views of Singapore. Like a giant vessel perched on three pillars, this magnificent hotel is a major drawcard. Enjoy a cocktail on the upper deck, but be aware, once you go in you can't return to the viewing deck. There is no access to the amazing infinity pool on the top deck, but as chance would have it I took a wrong turn when exiting and ended up poolside...great photos!"
,,Truly Amazing Views,5.0,,"The Skypark observation deck has amazing views of Singapore !
The skyline of the city in one direction and the port and garden bays area are something to be seen.
You could spend sometime on the deck taking in the views in all directions.
The deck is very large in size, space for hundreds of people.
There is a souvenirs and drinks shop at the top if needed.
It costs $23.00 for adults and $17 for children 12 and under,
(Tip - if you flew in on Singapore Airlines you get 15% off the price for adults).
Well worth the trip up for the spectacular views.
Nice way to spend an hour over looking Singapore !
Strongly advise to make an effort to go."
,,A must,5.0,,If you only visit one place in Singapore this is it. The view from the Skypark is amazing you can see all of Singapore and part of the grand prix track and cruise terminal.
,,Great Views and another way to see Singapore from Above,4.0,,Lifts whisk you to the top and you can get a panoramic viiew of the city. But it is limited and only with a telephoto lens can you see the famous infinity pool for guests at the other end. Well away from tourists. Didn't find a cafe. you're there for the view and your money.
,,Impressive hotel and great views,5.0,,So we didn’t stay there but we took the elevator up to floor 57 for viewing deck. Wow. The structure is so tall that you get unobstructed views of Singapore. Worth the price of admission. Highly recommend.
,,Good,5.0,,Very nice view from top.. Windy and good feeling types place... Have a break after going on top.. Enjoy the entire city view
,,"Kinda Pricy, But When in Singapore ...",4.0,,"My family and I went to the top to check out the view and get the signature Singapore Sling (since Raffles is being renovated). The drink wasn't great, but the views are spectacular. Pretty much what you'd expect. Don't be surprised when you can't walk all around the deck. The pool area is for hotel guests only."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"It’s a 15 min activity, but worth it to see the views from all angles. Such an impressive city! Unbelievable how many container ships are lined up!"
,,2nd time around and it was awesome,5.0,,"This was my second time to visit the Skypark, 56 floors up, still awesome as the first time I went up back in October, 2018. Stunning views of the Marina Bay area, visitted Skypark at around 2pm, not too crowded.

They do inform you that the area around infinity pool area including the pool itself is only accessable to hotel guests. Overall great experience 2nd time around."
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,"We did not stay in the Marina Bay Hotel so we were not able to see the pool side of the skypark. The Skypark gave us beautiful views of the city, but it was a little expensive."
,,Wrong Access - Avoid ‘Observation Deck SkyPark’,1.0,,"Pathetic - they don’t make it clear that you can not access the bar - later found out it was called ‘Ce La Vie’. We wanted to put our feet up and enjoy the view at the bar. Instead, we get told that we would have to pay a second time from the lobby to access the right location. Another family that complained were granted ‘special’ access to the bar above! Staff had no idea what they were doing and refused any help saying they were two different companies. $23 gets you very little access to the rooftop deck - go to another access point at one of the bars. Do not recommend!"
,,Walk from the bay to the gardens,5.0,,Stroll from marina bay to marina bay gardens. Some fabulous big trees on the walk overs. A great introduction to the gardens.
,,Marina bay skypark VS singapore flyer,4.0,,"As I preferred to go to the skypark instead of flyer because there is no time limit in the skypark, you can stay there for as long as you wanted to but in flyer, you will stay in the capsule for only 35-40 minutes.

You can enjoy the open air on the skypark deck and also get to see the infinity pool from their. But in flyer you will be inside a capsule only for the full time.

I can say skypark is much flexible than flyer and you can enjoy the view from more height then flyer.

Rest is on your personal choices.

One thing more, both of them get temporary closed when the rain is there."
,,Wow wow wow,5.0,,An excellent experience. Well organised. Reasonable price. Beautiful view. Must be seen. Suitable for all.
,,Beautiful Chaos,3.0,,An architectural miracle with something for everyone to see. Something for everyone! But I wouldn’t want to stay in this mega hotel !!
,,AU$22 for a beer!!,4.0,,"My husband had a very expensive beer at the Skypark but wasn't allowed to view the pool as he wasn't a guest. The view over Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay, the Marina and harbour was excellent."
,,MASTERPIECE OF ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNS,4.0,,"Singaporeans seem to master the art of utlising space that are not just effective in their design purposes, but offer locals and visitors places to shop, relax and be entertained."
,,Icon of Singapore,5.0,,Amazing view atop the Marina Bay Sands which gives a spectacular view of the city. Earlier the view was open to the public but now they only allow the hotel guests.
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,It’s one affordable way to experience the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands. Definitely a must see. The views are amazing. Expect to queue up up & down. They also take photos which you can purchase. We got ours at a discounted price of $25 as we were part of a tour.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I particularly enjoyed the views a lot. Below, is an amazing mall and near the water, there is a lovely pool filled with stunning water lilies."
,,See it from the Ce La Vi bar,4.0,,Saw the Skypark and the famous swimming pool by going up to the Ce La Vi bar which is on the roof of the hotel.
,,High above the rooftops,4.0,,"Very lovely view of Singapore by day and also by night. We bought a ticket to get us up during the afternoon, which could be reused again in the evening. They offered us a 20- dollar voucher for drinks in the evening. Pity that a small monito costed more than that. They are also quite picky with where people sit and expect you to pay a fortune for drinks. The pool looks lovely but you can only swim in there if you are a hotel guest."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This is an epic building and just incredible to conceive how they built it. It is a stunning place to look at from the ground and from the top.
To be honest though I'm not sure I would want to stay here as extremely busy at ground floor and a little on the tacky side"
,,Limited Sky park observation deck,3.0,,"If you are not a member, you will be limited to a small section of the sky park. That means no access to the infinity pool or the rest of the park. Their website states that if you show your airline ticket from Singapore Air, then you’ll receive a 15% discount. If I had known this I would’ve asked!"
,,You Have To Do This,5.0,,I think every Singapore holiday should start here it really lays out the city so beautiful and the views in the morning are amazing. It opens at 9.30am and there are only a few people there as it gets busier after 10am
,,Superb view,5.0,,Bayfront station is the nearest station to skypark@tower 3 . Cheaper if u purchase thr tix online . Great view
,,"Superb, unique in the world!",5.0,,"How describe this... you will see nothing like it anywhere in the world. Unique design, architecture, ambience, sophistication, great nature all around, safe, stylish, original,and different. A good 2 hour stroll to discover all edges and angles and lakes where to enjoy and also picture one of the most iconic building in the world is really worthy. It is a tremendous place on earth"
,,One of the best attractions in Singapore is the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck,5.0,,"One of the best attractions in Singapore is the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, some 57 floors into the Singapore skyline. From there you can see most of the city State and experience a beautiful sunset (partially blocked by skyscrapers). You get an amazing view of the marina bay, the city and the Garden by the Bay park. If you hang around long enough you can get a nice view of the lit up garden below you and other buildings. Tickets cost around £23 (US $17).
You can also book a night at the hotel and get access to the famous infinity pool they have."
,,What a thrill,5.0,,"I have seen photos of this place in the past and was always fascinated by them, so when I had a chance to go there, I was thrilled. I was on a tour from a cruise ship, and I wasn't even sure the tour would stop at the Skypark, so when it did, I was psyched.
The elevator to the top floor observation deck is very fast - I could hardly believe it when we reached the top. The views of the city from the top of the building are magnificent."
,,Splendid view of the skyline and the sea,4.0,,"It's the boat on three high rise towers.
Located on the 56th floor, the Skypark has no park :) it’s the half of the floating boat to look around the island.
Please expect long queues to get in the elevator to reach Skypark. There is a small coffee and snacks shop. It has decent coffee and cold drinks. There is a fine dining restaurant too which has a one-way entry and you must exit from the Skypark after you are finished with food.
Regular exit from Skypark involves a long queue to the elevator.
Tips:
* carry a good camera for landscape and skyline pictures.
* buy tickets online, find deals and save a few dollars.
* best time to visit is early evening.
* you need about two hours to visit it."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This is Singapore’s most iconic building, and your trip is never complete unless you go up and visit the SkyPark observatory. Staff are very nice, polite and helpful."
,,Pool With a View,5.0,,One very exclusive pool accessible to hotel guests only. Infinity pool over looking the Merlion and Fullerton Hotel across the Singapore River. Pool area also has a jacuzzi on the backside overlooking the sea
,,Wow,5.0,,"Amazing venue, we went after the light show had finished as it’s scarily busy at peak times. The ticket price included a Singapore Sling slush puppy, which we drink whilst watching the Uber cool enjoy their night out. Fantastic views"
,,Best to visit really late at night,5.0,,"All these attractions are extremely overcrowded during the day and evenings. For the best experience, visit them after 10am. Take the skywalk connecting the hotel to Gardens by the bay and see the true beauty without the hassle of crowds. Our visit was after 12am and we believe it was the best decision we ever made."
,,"Amazing view, but a bit expensive",4.0,,This place is a must do. The view is beautiful and reveling of what is singapore. You can see everything. The only problem is the price that is a bit excessive... too bad. The drinks are ok.
,,What a view!,5.0,,Amazing views from the top - quite crowded and not sure about pool cleanliness. Must see when in Singapore though!
,,Awesome Pool and View,5.0,,"The view from the pool up on level 57 is simply awesome but can't say the same about the cleanliness of the pool. Anyway, most guests who are up there are only interested in taking photos and making videos, except the little kids whom I find truly enjoy the pool.

Saw Katy Perry and Victoria Beckham up on the Skypark on different occasions a few years back. Thankfully the access is only restricted to hotel guests and each room is given limited numbers of access cards but it can still be very crowded most of the time. Best time to visit is early in the morning.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in Spore."
,,Best hotel in world,5.0,,This is a amazing building and definitely a bucket list place to visit. If you can have a swim in the infinity pool at top in evening.....amazing view of Singapore all lit up.
,,Unique experience!,5.0,,This is the reason we stayed at the MBS! It exceeded all our expectations for a lovely setting with incredible views. The infinity pool was amazing. Everything upscale here. Do expect to pay dearly for everything at MBS...
,,Good views but,3.0,,Great views from the top but you must pay to get there. It costs S$23 to get to the skypark. Do not be mistaken for going up to the Ce La Vi restaurant and being able to access the skypark - you will have to pay extra!
,,Interesting views,4.0,,"The hotel is very nice inside and out, attached to a decent, upscale mall (as is most of town). There is a natural history museum and other interesting things outside. The ride to the top is pricey but worth a look. Once there, only part of the top is open unless you are staying at the hotel. The bar and restaurant are very pricey (think $20 US for a drink). But, it is a great place for photos of the city and worth the time"
,,Good even on a cloudy day,4.0,,Decided on going up the sky deck as opposed to visiting the restaurant as you can no longer get to the sky deck from the restaurant without a hotel key. Views were amazing! A little cloudy but made for good lighting. There is a food/drink stand at the top but no table or shade so keep that in mind while making your decision.
,,A beautiful designed hotels with grounds equally as beautiful. The only downside is the hotel lobby. It's rather blah.,5.0,,A beautiful designed hotels with grounds equally as beautiful. The only downside is the hotel lobby. It's rather blah. The view from the top is stunning. I recommend going just before sunset.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"I did the evening visit to the Observation Deck on the 56th floor, the night lights of Singapore are just amazing. Well worth a visit."
,,Bit of a gimmick,2.0,,"The views are wonderful. But it is crowded, there is only one thing to do, take a swim to the edge and take a selfie. Prob lu just me but I did not enjoy it."
,,For a stunning View and Cold Air,4.0,,For a Stunning view of Singapore city go to SKypark@MBS located at the top of MBS hotel. It is open till 10PM SGT
,,Amazing view of skyline of Singapore,4.0,,Went for staycation. The view is really breathtaking and the vibes is really chill and relaxing. However the infinity pool is usually packed with people so it is not as pleasant but there are sitting areas around to lounge at if you do not fancy the packed pool
,,selfe time,5.0,,"has to be done, take in the views have your photos done, well worth the money. could get busy but ok when we went."
,,Take your camera,5.0,,The view from the top is amazing. Whichever direction you look in there is something to photograph. There is an infinity pool for the hotel guests on the roof which looks brilliant.
,,great tower,5.0,,it is very nice tower you can get great views to see whole singapore and get great pictures too .do it
,,for me- it's all about the pool,5.0,,"If you get a chance, look up the building of MBS on YouTube to give you a little more appreciation for this phenomenal structure. The infinity pool at Skypark was on my bucket list and it did not disappoint.
NOTE: You need to be a hotel guest of MBS to enjoy the pool. (Each person needs to have their own hotel key card to enter.)
The views from there are spectacular. There are also nice views on the opposite side, from the hot tubs. The pool water can be cold once the sun goes down, but feels really good when sunny. However, at night, you get a decent view of the nightly light show by the bay. Don't forget to take your token selfie at the pool!

There are also 2 restaurants up there- Lavo and Spago. Lavo was not really my taste, but Spago offered a good breakfast. We wanted to go for dinner, but never made it.

You can also pay to go to the observation deck, but we never did that since we were staying at the hotel. At night, there is a club up there, which seemed quite popular. We didn't go because that's not really our thing.

If you're in Singapore, MBS Skypark is a must-see. Enjoy!"
,,Quite a site..!,4.0,,This is a lovely place to go and spend time. Several attractions close by and Marina Bay is great place to spend several hours. You will not be bored.
,,A visit to Singapore,5.0,,"Its great place to go to, just queue for a ticket to go up to the viewing tower what a great shoot you get from the top of Singapore. We love Singapore been five times"
,,Skypark experience,5.0,,"We visited the Skypark whilst in the Marina Bay Area,the view from the observation deck is fabulous although
I would recommend going up there when it is not too hot as there isn’t any shaded areas and only a small gift shop / bar up there
The lift that takes you up is rapid and takes you up the 85 floors in seconds"
,,A must if you visiting Singapore,4.0,,Went up to the sky at on the top floor for drinks and watched the Singapore light show from there. Good view of whole city and if you are a hotel resident which we weren’t they have an infinity pool which looks fantastic. A pleasant night made it an enjoyable evening for drinks and snacks.
,,excellent view,5.0,,"recommend you go around 1800 or so, you dont need to go to the viewing platform but suggest go for the bar (Ce La Vie) which also has stunning views and where you can have drink while you watch the sunset."
,,Great view,4.0,,"Great view, worth seeing but a bit expensive , for what it is. Its just something you have to do in Singapore"
,,Instagram Photo Session,4.0,,this is just the right place to go take your Instagramable photos. Make sure to go a bit before sunset and stay there until the sunsets. A really nice experience.
,,What a view,5.0,,"We purchased 5 tickets for the viewing platform @ $23 per person. Just a note you need to go to tower 3 to buy your tickets, it wasn’t very clear. When you line line up before the lifts they take a family photo of you. When you arrive at the top they have the photo ready for you and hit you up for $85. We said no. What a view. 45 second up on the lift and 40 seconds down the lift. You will enjoy the view. We took a lot of panoramic shots. It is worth while going up you get an over vie wolf Singapore and the harbour. Our son enjoyed see all the container ships."
,,Can’t leave Singapore without a visit,5.0,,Very happy with views from table at restaurant on swimming pool terrace. Service was very good as was the food. Only problem was that it is too popular and you feel like your on a conveyor belt and they want the table back. Go late. G
,,best night view,5.0,,very beautiful view at the skypark but the que at night is really long at the exit point because tof he elevators
,,What A Place,4.0,,This is something special. Never seen anything like it anywhere else. It is so different and a must if you're in Singapore. Fabulous views.
,,"Las Vegas and Theme park rolled into one,",5.0,,Unbelievable architecture. Seen pictures for years but until seen in person you will not believe how enormous it is. As you drive up the scale is huge. We did not stay there but had drinks on the roof. We could have walked for days. if shopping in high end stores gets you going this is for you. Bigger than most malls in the USA. it just seems to go on and on.
,,Very Good,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands hotel is a wonderful architectural structure, one can visit the hotel free, but to visit sky park you need a ticket, observation deck offers good view of Singapore and a nice opportunity for photography"
,,Breathtaking View of the Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"My breath was taken away when I saw Singapore’s glittering skyline. The Sky Park provided a bird’s eye view of the city, from the Super Trees and Christmas decor at Garden By The Bay, to the lighted skyscrapers of the Central Business District. It was stunning.

The vast expanse of space also means one is able to enjoy the view without anyone else invading into your personal space."
,,Sands Sky,4.0,,"Always full of people, manageable lines, with better view during night time to enjoy the light show."
,,Put this on your bucket list,5.0,,"The pool is delightful and the view perfect. The building itself is grotesquely ugly and utterly out of character with its surrounds; but hey, its Singapore! Any view from the top is great because the building itself isn't in the view. Singapore's Monparnasse Tower perhaps."
,,Super View of the Bay,5.0,,"Magnificent view of the bay, best time in the evening, you will get to see the lights of the Gardens by the bay."
,,Nice views,5.0,,"Great views from up here, as a major tourist destination everything up there is expensive. There are a couple of bars that are quite busy at night with drink prices being on avg 35% higher than anywhere else. The restaurant is nice also. The pool is only accessible to guests staying in the hotel."
,,Amazing View of the City,5.0,,"I had relatives visit Singapore with young kids and they wanted to experience the view during the day and evening as well. So we went straight to the SkyDeck at 5:45 pm, stayed for almost 2 hours to enjoy the view under the sun & moon light.

It was an amazing view of the city especially the Flyer, Esplanade, the Harbourfront, Flower Dome & Gardens By the Bay.

If you are in Singapore, you definitely cannot afford to miss this..."
,,Amazing hotel,4.0,,This hotel is worth a visit. The architecture is very impressive. A trip to the top is available but it cost $20. Lots of very expensive shops.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,It was good inside and outside. Views from inside were just as good as from outside. There was a beautiful view of the Flyer standing in the viewing balcony. Fantastic!!!
,,Nice experience,4.0,,Nice experience and good view of Singapore from skypark My son who is a lover of skyscrapers love it to the max
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,We paid to go to the top of the hotel and have a drink in the bar rather than just visit the viewing platform. A Singapore sling just had to be done ! Friendly helpful staff a definite visit if going to Singapore
,,Magnificent views,4.0,,The skylark dominates the Singapore skyline and the views from the top are superb. You can see for miles and there us a cafe you can purchase drinks and food and Aldo an option if restaurant. The fee to go up a big pricey but the view is superb. You are right above the gardens and you can see the Grand Prix track. You can also see out to sea and all the hundreds of boats waiting to use the harbour. It's way higher than the wheel so has best views in Singapore.
,,Everything you would expect,5.0,,The views are amazing. Its lovely to watch the sunset from the rooftop bar. The meal at the restaurant was very nice and the staff were friendly. You can have a wonder around the restaurant to get different views.
,,Mesmerized view,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark... It's located at beautiful place. Looks fantastic by outside, inside and top of it i.e. Skypark. I love the creation and one of the best place at Singapore. Spend peaceful and nice time on top of the 57th level. Must Go"
,,A must visit when in Singapore.,5.0,,Amazing architecture and wonderful views from the Skypark. We took lift to top deck and had drinks in Ce La Vi cocktail bar/restaurant. Free lift and drinks were cheaper than paying the charge to take the lift to the Skypark. A must go and experience in Singapore.
,,Stunning architecture,5.0,,Swim in the infinity pool high above Singapore and then have the best parmesan truffle fries in the world poolside! A stay at the hotel is pricey but so worth it! The pool spans 3 massive towers. It really was an architectural first in the world...although it has been emulated in Qatar now.
,,What an Incredible Place,5.0,,"Totally amazing !!!! We went here Day and Night it was so good. And with Raffles being closed for refurbishment Marine Bay’s rooftop bar was the perfect place for that Singapore Sling. Now, we did blag our way into the bar but hey, we where on our holidays so why not lol. During the day it’s no bother getting in but in the evening it let’s say a tad harder..., but definitely worth the effort. If I’m back in Singapore any time soon then this is where I’ll stay... The Infinity Pool looks incredible. The whole complex poses class and style."
,,A Breathtaking view,4.0,,"Visited the place in November. The skypark is at 57th floor of the Marina Bay sand hotel.Ticket is a bit costly, but you will get a panaromic view of Singapore. There is no sitting facility available. So once we reached, we just roam around, enjoyed the view and came back. There is no shade available, so if it is raining, you will get drenched. So plan accordingly."
,,High up there,4.0,,"We spend a long time on the top deck. You can get snacks, food and drinks up there. There is a sit down restaurant on the top deck where you can sit down and enjoy the view. There is no time limit how long you...More"
,,Very average,3.0,,The area open to the public is very ordinary- obviously views of the magnificent city of Singapore. But have a lot better experiences around the world at other tall buildings with views. The women selling the green screen photos was a pain in the sky...More
,,Singapore,5.0,,"Wonderful city views, pricey but they take the ticket price off your food/beverage order at the bar onto the top. Incredible huge hotel with adjacent shopping the defies your imagination, we had a hard time finding the way out! The Casino is also attached but...More"
,,Brief Visit before the storm,4.0,,"Excellent friendly staff (if you can produce a Singapore Airlines boarding pass, there is a 15% discount!) especially the young lady dispensing the drinks at the bar on Level 57. The views are spectacular although ours were of a fast approaching weather front, so we...More"

,,Mr,5.0,,"Wowsa . Worra view , SERIOUSLY mind blowing . The prices ( singapore value BTW) was quite reasonable also . the lifts were so swish , a really enjoyable experience. I recommend going at night time."
,,Amazing views. Well worth a visit,4.0,,Situated in the Bay area this consists of 3 high rise buildings with a boat on top. Enter at ground level where the pay desk and lift are. The lift will quickly take you up to the 'boat' or Skypark. Once there the views are...More
,,Outstanding view,5.0,,"There is an entry charge to go to the skypark of Marina bay sands ,but since we were residents there is was free. It gives a 360 degree view of the whole Singapore which is amazing.We were happy to visit it twice,once at day time...More"
,,Great view,4.0,,"I would definitely recommend visiting here, the views are spectacular with 360 birds eye on Singapore. Although you can’t visit the famous pool you can get a glimpse from the deck. It is quite pricey but it is definitely worth it as you will be...More"
,,A beautiful view of the city,5.0,,The skypark opens at 9.30 am and you can enjoy beautiful view of the lion city from the park. If you are a resident at the hotel you can visit the deck FOC.
,,From a California Girl's Perspective - Way too HOT!,3.0,,"Ok.... yes, it's a great view. The view was breathtaking.... but if you are planning on sitting down, resting, or relaxing... it's not the place to go. You must go to the restaurant/bar to sit. Menopausal? Forget it.... you will sweat until you find a shower or a cold pool. The Singapore Sling they served was not big enough to cool me down... that's for sure!! Refreshing yes! Beautiful photo op? oh yes. Wonderful service-everyone is nice but would I do it again? Probably not. I think next time I would choose to stay at the hotel.... that would be better as you get to go to the pool and other areas of the 56 and 57th floors."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We went here as part of a tour. It was about 21:30 hours. To say that it was breath taking would be an understatement. The night was clear and warm. We were mesmerised by it all. Miss it at your peril
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Absolutely amazing views. A must do when visiting Singapore. The light show every night from the top deck is wonderful.
,,WOW,5.0,,"amazing place in Singapore, they charged us 20 singapore dollars entry to the top but you can spend this towards a drink"
,,"Good view & room, Super swimming pool view!",4.0,,"Went there on my hubby's birthday, got a free upgrade to a suite. The room is big with an additional sofa bed, which can safely accommodate 3 adults and 1 or 2 kids. We get to see Gardens by the Bay from the balcony, it's really beautiful! The kids enjoyed the swimming pool a lot, we adults liked the view more. Food is pricey in the hotel building but can walk a bit to reach Ding Tai Fung and other eateries easily in the shopping mall."
,,Sands top deck with restaurant..,4.0,,"$20 for each person to get there, but the $20 comes off the price of food and drink. Stayed there most of the afternoon, eating and drinking, and enjoying the views. Not able to see the light show from this deck. Need to go down and pay another $20 to go to the observation deck."
,,Better Deals Elsewhere !,3.0,,"If you think you will get to see the pool and gardens on the top deck, think again ! You only get to the deck below, where there is not one seat available anywhere for anybody to sit, even the elderly.
The surrounding views are OK, but the views and ride on the Singapore Flyer are more entertaining, and you have a seat if you wish.
The nearby Gardens by the Bay is also better value, especially the Cloud Forest Dome."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"We totally enjoyed our visit to the sky park. A ticket does not permit entrance to the top deck where the pools and trees are, which is reserved for hotel guests, but you can at least get a side view of the pool."
,,Overpriced and no seating - 30 mins stay probably,3.0,,"This attraction is overpriced in my opinion, they try and sell you a Frozen drink when you buy your tickets. I would avoid it, as it is tiny.
You get your photo taken on the way up, and by the time you get to the top, the hard sell of their photo packages comes into play.
When you get out onto the viewing platform, there is NO where to sit. So while it says you can stay as long as you like, in reality, there is little point in remaining there for too long.
Having bought the Frozen Drink, I did manage to find 2 bar stools to sit at while the drink was consumed.
It is not possible to get anywhere near the Infinity Pool, as this is for guests of the hotel. You can see it, and at 10am on a Saturday, it was pretty crowded with people.
So with a $30 ticket (inc Drink) and a picture, you are likely to spend $90 for less than an hour of viewing time, with no where to sit.
It did not appear that the restaurant was open to non-hotel guests and was closed when I visited at around 11am on Sat 1st Dec.
I would not recommend it."
,,"Good view, pricey food and drinks",4.0,,"Lovely view! Great atmosphere, food and drinks are expensive but you can redeem them from the $20 to get in, but it usually only gets you one."
,,Must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"At 23 SGD per person , the place is worth the money. And if you are a krisflyer member, may be an additional 10-15% discount. Awesome view of the ships at anchorage, the giant wheel and the lake surrounded with skyscrapers makes it a treat for photographers.
However there are some things you would loathe like no access to the infinity pool, no shade on a sunny day, no place to sit on the observation deck.
Despite all this, I would give it 4/5

Note: smokers would be disappointed here"
,,This is the landmark in Singapore.,5.0,,"Wherever you are you cannot miss it. It is outstanding, massive and you can get some amazing photos while walking in the area. This place is crazy and fun."
,,awesome view!,5.0,,This is a must see place to go when you visit Singapore. If you stay at the Hotel then you could even swim at their pool. I was here for only one night but it was so worth it. Skypark is also great for photo options and the view. this is a place I would recommend to anyone.
,,Amazing view!!,4.0,,"When you visit Singapore, you must visit this place. If you can afford to stay at the hotel, it is even better because this is the only way to have access to the pool. Skypark is also great for photo options and the view. Highly recommended."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Either visiting the restaurant at the top floor (which is pricey, I must say), or the attraction they offer in the previous floor, one must definitely experience the views from here."
,,awesome...,4.0,,"you feel amazing watching this magnificent mega structure created by humans, another national symbol of singapore."
,,dizzy heights,5.0,,"Well, if you are in Singapore, do not miss the opportunity to take the lift to the top. Probably the one place you should go to get the best views.Wonderful."
,,Great views,4.0,,We went to the skydeck and used our $20 tickets to exchange for drinks when we were at the top which is a nice touch. Even better to go at night time or when the sun starts to set!
,,Totally amazing views,5.0,,We went to the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. It was raining heavily and all we saw was clouds. We bought a drink which was subsidised by presenting our ticket and talked to some travellers and then the weather started to clear. Wow! The views were amazing and worth waiting for. You should certainly try this if in Singapore
,,marina by the bay,4.0,,"this is a busy complex, very clean,we went up the top you have to pay,the only down side to this is if you are not staying there you can only go onto the tip of the top you cant walk all the way round unless you are staying there. still brilliant views from the top"
,,A visit with friends,5.0,,Would definitely recommend a visit here. The views were fantastic. You could see the sea and the Flyer and the Singapore Grand Pre Racecourse.
,,Unique view,4.0,,"Outstanding crown to this unbelievable resort.
Lots of excellent bars and dinihg options
A little hard to get a seat somtimes as its all very popular.
Infinity pool os iconic and a must use.
Restaurants are very busy and you need to book well i advance to avoid disappointment."
,,Awesome view!,5.0,,"Hotel guests get to go up to the Skypark for free, limited to 1 room card per person. The 57th floor Skypark offers a panoramic view of Singapore city centre or a bird's eye view of Gardens by the Bay. Go up in the day to have a clearer view or in the night for a romantic experience. Infinity pool is opened 6am to 11pm."
,,Wow,5.0,,"The views from the 57th floor are amazing.
We bought a ticket from the Ce la vi bar restaurant desk next to the main reception.
If you just do the sky walk the ticket booth is one floor down.
You get 40 dollars discounted from the bar restaurant bill and no obligation to buy food so it’s a much better option and the views are better as one floor higher. You can also see the sky park infinity pool.
Great shopping mall attached to the hotel as well plus the Gardens By The Bay."
,,Birds eye view of Singapore,5.0,,Visit this amazing park in the sky on the top of the Marina Bay Hotel...57th floor there is a charge of around $20 to go up but worth every penny. Overlooking the gardens by the bay you really can see pretty much the whole of the city great for photos/views and gives you yhe opportunity watch the super tree grove light and music show from above (745/845pm).The is a bar here for refreshments to recover after having your breath took away by the surrounding area.
,,Great Building,5.0,,I visited the MBS as part of the night tour and I must admit that its really worth visiting we were allowed to visit the top and the water show was very entertaining.
,,Great city views!,5.0,,"Although I am afraid of heights, I really enjoyed this. The elevator takes you up 56 floors in 45 seconds. You walk out onto a very secure rooftop with views of the city, and explanatory placards so you know what you're looking at."
,,Best view of Singapore,4.0,,"If you're looking for the best view of Singapore this is the place to be. I went at night and it was breath taking. It is busy, but so I any area of interest. It is a must do when in Singapore."
,,Stunning view of Singapore,5.0,,"I was staying at the Marina Bay so I did t have to pay to access the Sky park.
I must say the view over here is just spectacular. You get a great view of Singapore with all the buildings, the harbour and the Ferris wheel and also garden by the bay.
I would definitely recommend this attraction for people visiting Singapore"
,,Not over impressed,2.0,,I recently visited this as part of a night city tour and was not impressed to my mind its just three buildings with a viewing platform on as for the water display the least said the better!
,,Best experience,5.0,,"We had tried to book a table the night before we visited and were told we couldn't?
When we arrived at the Ce la vi club lounge, we noticed reservation signs on lots of tables!
My friend spoke to a member of the team and asked if it was possible to get a table.
They went out of their way for us and did indeed get a table.
They were amazing, so helpful and friendly.
Well done to Chris, KC and S Star.
You made our visit even more special with your wonderful care and great personalities. Keep up the good work the three of you"
,,Spectacular Rooftop Terrace and Bar,5.0,,"The Skypark is a landmark that is visible from most of central Singapore and from which travellers get a remarkable view. Drinks arent cheap, but nor are they in most bars in Singapore."
,,Overrated,2.0,,We stayed at the Hilton but wanted to see the view from this stunning looking hotel as it had been recommended by friends. To be honest although the views are stunning we found it all pretty disappointing. The service on the top deck was the worst we saw in our whole time in Singapore and it definitely felt like they didn’t care as they had our money. It took an age to order drinks and snacks. The drinks took ages to come and the snacks didn’t appear. We had finished our drinks and were trying to pay (we gave up on the snacks) and they almost insisted we stay and wait for the snacks ! We needed to leave and they eventually ‘boxed’ the snacks which took more time and we had an appointment and we just binned the box anyway. Enjoy the view but expect poor service.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"It was a very hot day when i visit Skypark! On the 56th floor you have the spectacular views over Singapore. The only bad thing is, with these hot temperatures they have no places to go back into the shade."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"The views from the observation deck are just amazing. We had a clear evening, so the clarity was perfect. Would certainly recommend a visit"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,The views of Singapore are amazing. Well worth the price of the ticket. We were fortunate as there were no lines and we could reach the walls to see the views unobstructed.
,,Panoramic view,5.0,,Its a nice place to check out while at the marina. You can see gardens by the bay and Singapore's flyer. Just make sure to bring a selfie stick for a great panoramic selfies.
,,Skypark is worth a visit,4.0,,We were staying in the Katong district for 5 days so we travelled from Dakota MRT station to Bayfront which has direct access to the Marina Bay Sands complex. Walked thru to tower three and and purchased the tickets to the 56 floor and the skypark. The lift was very quick but there was no side effects of the rapid rise. The view was fantastic and gives a great perspective of the whole city and waterways. Would recommend to first time visitors to Singapore as a terrific introduction to the city.
,,Cool experience 😎,5.0,,you have to pay either 23 S$ for the sightseeing platform (which are gone then) or option 2 pay 20 S$ which you'll change for cool drinks one level higher. so choose option 2! stunning view. place to be in Singapore. we walked there from the Yotel in the Orchard Road. Keep fit
,,what a marvel from the outside. nothing unique from the inside,4.0,,these buildings are amazing to watch from the outside. huge and towering over the gardens at the bay. but when you go in it is just a mall
,,Great view of Marina Bay,5.0,,My client was staying at the MBS and we had several meetings in the hotel. Plenty of restaurant and a great view from the bars at the vey top. Incredible Infinity pool.
,,An Amazing Sight overlooking Singapore.,4.0,,On top is a beautiful swimming with a bar on one side. The feeling of a sight overlooking the beautiful scenery of Marina Bay and Singapore is just amazing and quite interesting - a really wonderful feeling.
,,Great Place,5.0,,"We went to the Marina Bar to have a Drink by the Pool wonderful view of the City. Again Pictures did not come out good, but in My Minds Eye, My Day Pictures came out better"
,,best views,5.0,,Great place for a 360 degree view of Singapore including the gardens well appointed. Highly recommend it.
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,We took a tour at night and it was great. It is magnificent to see especially at night with all of the lights. A must see.
,,Super view of Singapore and Port area,5.0,,A must do Experience when visiting Singapore. The view are awesome. There is a cost to visit the Skypark but we opted to go to Ce Le Vi bar which also had a cover but is actually a credit that can be applied against your bill. Worked great for us. Watched the sunset over the high rise bank buildings across the harbor which was quite beautiful. A little crowded but not as bad as we were lead to believe.
,,Go to the rooftop bar for the view!,3.0,,View is spectacular and well worth doing. You will howerer be purchasing a very overpriced watered down drink to see the view!
,,didgital display,5.0,,the marina bay hotel is a good place to go first to the lookout platform on level 57 and underneath the hotel are 4 levels of shops a canal with boats and in the food hall a wonderful didgital displa.
,,Veiw and pool of a lifetime.,5.0,,"The best pool/viewing area you will ever experience. Staff are always on hand to help with whatever is required. The drinks and food are delicious, and always served with a smiley face. One thing I would say is only a bad point is, a bit of rudeness by other hotel guests. I understand that this is a place where many people from different backgrounds visit, but politeness and courtesy don't cost a thing"
,,Best views of Singapore (city and surrounding area),4.0,,The sky deck observatory though expensive seemed well worth it if you aren't staying at the hotel. you can stay up there for quite a while watching the city and landscape.
,,What a view,5.0,,This view is different than the Flyer and it is worth doing both. This might be the place to have that Singapore sling you have been promising yourself whilst admiring the view.
,,Infinity!,4.0,,"One of the best hotels I've to been to, amazing pool, great view. The casino being another attraction."
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views especially at sunset and great food too. Definitely worth a visit if you happen to be around.
,,Nice view but us it worth the price of admission.,3.0,,"We paid $30 to go up to level 56 Skypark which included a small frozen Singapore Sling.
Only to find out after, that for $20 you can go to Ce la vie on level 57 and get a free drink.
Neither give you admission to the pool area as this is only for hotel guests."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,I went there at noon.... The view is totally amazing. I wanna try to visit the skypark at night.. I believe it would be so romantic... You are at the top of the most iconic building in Singapore.... fantastic...
,,"Open deck, no shade but good view",3.0,,"Just the end bit of the huge deck level that spans the three columns of the hotel. The main part is for hotel guests only.
S$20 (concessions) to go up to the end bit which is all that is available to no-guests. An open deck area with no shade and no seating. But an amazing view over the sea and the city. There is a restaurant on an upper level with shade.
Paid S$7 for Singapore Sling - it's not Raffles. This was a plastic cup with frozen ice slush (might have been alcoholic)."
,,Night cap,3.0,,"Wonderful place, beautiful scenery , staff helpful and professional. You can choose to only see the view or go for a drink, or have a meal at the restaurant, it’s up to you."
,,A must see,4.0,,As it's my first time in Singapore I had to check out the attraction everyone was talking about. It's amazing I had a great time and a great view
,,Go for a drink,5.0,,"Good place to go for a drink. See the view or stay a night at the hotel so you can use the swimming pool. Romantic and also good for friends. Not cheap, but with a drink included and maybe you order a pizza or something, then it’s actually good value for the money."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"We have visited Singapore previously but never ventured up to the Sky Park. Well worth the experience with great views of the whole of the city and surrounds.

Very safe and stunning panoramic views. We went mid morning and weren’t disappointed but I would suggest if you can go at sunset the effect would be even better. We did the Flyer over sunset and it was magical."
,,Go to the Top for Sunset!,5.0,,The visitation lounge at the top of the hotel is a “must do” while in Singapore. Suggest going approx 5.30 to hit the sunset- you will he treated to amazing views. Not to disappoint.
,,Important info for visitors to the SkyPark,5.0,,"There is a LOT of misinformation in some of the reviews for this attraction. Let's start with the basics. The Skypark is the boat shaped structure located on top of the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There are 3 ways to get to it. The priciest way is to stay at the Sands. When we looked at room prices, they were $600 and up. But that gets you access to all of the Skypark, including the infinity pool. You cannot get to the infinity pool as a non-guest. The second option is accessed from INSIDE the Sands Hotel. Just inside the door on Tower 3, there is a desk and usually a long line. This line takes you to the Skypark BAR. The ticket (not sure where to purchase - ask) costs around $20 but is taken off your tab at the bar. Now, it won't buy you a lot as a draft beer is around $20. But, you do get to go to the highest point, one floor higher than the observation deck. That being said, the bar is relatively small. Seating is limited. Your view is therefore somewhat limited. You cannot get from the Bar to the observation deck or vice-versa without purchasing a second ticket and standing in a second line. The third option is accessed from OUTSIDE Tower 3. Around the corner of Tower 3 is a glass enclosure with steps that descend to a ticket counter. For a similar ~ $20, you can go up to the next to top floor and access the observation deck. This deck wraps around the front of the ""ship"". It is at least 200 feet long on each side of the ship. That is at least 400 feet of viewing area. When we were there, there was no time limit for your stay on the deck. We went up before sunset, around 6:00, watched the sun set at about 6:30, and stayed until 7:30. Then we went down and got a seat at the Sands Water and Sound show which started at 8:00. It is better to watch the show from ground level than from the observation deck, but you can see it from the observation deck if you wish. You can also see the Gardens by the Bay light and sound show from the observation deck. This occurred at 7:45. Discount tickets to the observation deck can be obtained from some tour operators. In order to get from the observation deck to the light and sound show, you need to descend the elevator at the Sands, go into the sands Tower 3, find the mall entrance, go to the mall, go up 2 floors, walk to the opposite wall, find the large glass doors and exit the mall to the bay side. The light and sound show is held near the ""lotus flower"" which you will recognize. I hope this helps you decide how to see the city from the Skypark and keeps you from standing in the wrong line! Happy viewing."
,,Great View but Pricey,3.0,,"One of those have to go things. Amazing view but expensive. As a non-guest at the hotel, your access is extremely limited."
,,A must visit for all tourists,5.0,,Google the timings and top rated restaurants before visiting. It's a must visit place for all. We came here with a toddler and didn't face any issues in finding baby food and vegetarian food for ourselves.
,,rooftop garden is fantastic,5.0,,"This hotel is a landmark of Singapore. There will be water curtain performance at night. A good place for shopping, too. Rooftop garden is fantastic, the view is brilliant."
,,A must see,5.0,,Best view in Singapore and for the cost of a drink it's worth the experience. You can dine for lunch or dinner in casual clothes on Monday and Tuesday. The shopping is amazing even for window shopping. If you are a car enthusiasts take a ride in a ferrari around the city. So much to do and see around the bay. A museum boat cruise food bars casino. Catch a bus or cab . Just a fun day out with lots of options. Remember you need your passport if entering the casino.
,,its like dream but it was relly happen,5.0,,"i never think that i will come here, i dont have planning anything before. but ya im here with my aunt. its like your dream be true. i love this place, this is my first step to visited another country in my life. everything are lovely, amazing and i love to be here. i will be back here. love singapore"
,,Drink on the deck,3.0,,"View from the 57th floor pretty good, drinks slightly over priced but considering you have to purchase a ticket that costs $20 and that comes off your drinks tab it’s worth it."
,,Sept 2018,5.0,,The views from this deck across the famous marina bay sands hotel are amazing. All four corners of the city can be seen. Showcasing what a beautiful city Singapore is. The best time is from 5pm to 7pm.
,,This Building and Skypark Are Amazing,5.0,,"From the moment I saw the hotel (three separate buildings joined by the ship look-alike [Skypark] on top) I was mesmerized and could not stop taking pictures. When I finally had the opportunity to enter the fast-moving elevator and visit the Skypark, it was night time and all of Singapore was lit up and laid out beautifully at my feet. Some 56 floors above Singapore, walking around the perimeter provides a 360 degree view of the city. Just beautiful."
,,Great views,5.0,,"You pay 20 Singapore dollars and you get access to an amazing rooftop with views over the city and the gardens by the bay as well.
With the 20 dollars you pay you get a voucher of the same amount to use at the bar. Cocktails are +/- 23dollars and beer 15dollars"
,,VIEeeeews,5.0,,Great way to see the city at night or during the day. Awesome views.... a bucket lister. A little pricey for drinks though
,,Huge - it’s plus and minus,3.0,,"The hotel IS impressive. This mammoth and icon building has it all. Great restaurants, amazing pool, and nice bar. But it is not a place where you can really relax at all. You can liken it to a cruise ship or any upscale shopping mall."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Went on a evening tour to the hotel. It was so busy. Took the elevator to the viewing platform. What an amazing view. Would have loved to stay longer, but time was tight on the tour."
,,Got to do,5.0,,"Arrived at the 53rd floor of the observation deck to magnificent views, arrived about 15:00 (photographer snaps as soon as you go through which you collect if you want to purchase as soon as you get out of the lift , no pressure though to buy)so no ques which meant not too many people about giving us s good chance of great photos.and didn’t feel rushed We paid the extra to have s Singapore sling which turned out to be a slush version which was fine and much appreciated as it was very hot and humid worth the 27 s dollars experience"
,,Pricey but pool is splendid,4.0,,"We broke the budget a bit to stay at this hotel, but it was well worth it. The massive lobby is chaotic, but service is excellent. Our room (in which three of us stayed, making the price tag more affordable) was large with a king size bed and a couch that was comfortable for sleeping. Our view was dizzyingly fantastic. There is a feeling of simple elegance in the furnishings, décor, linens and bath products. The gym is located on the 55th floor and has a good variety of weights, equipment, treadmills and other cardio machines – the amazing view provided motivation to work out. The change rooms were immaculate, and featured a hot pool, sauna and steam room. There are many restaurants in the hotel, and we tried several and were happy with them. Best of all, though, was the 150-metre infinity pool on the roof – 57 stories up and the largest rooftop pool in the world! When you lean on the edge, you feel like you could almost fall. It’s a great photo op! Only registered guests can use the pool and it is a fabulous experience. The pool has two sections and if you go early morning, one of the sections is reserved for ultra-long 75 meter laps! The pool gets crowded later in the day, but there is plenty of room to lounge in the sun or to sit in the outdoor bar and sip tasty cocktails. There is also a rooftop resto. The hotel is in a good location from which to walk to several of the best sites and to explore the city. Would definitely stay again!"
,,"Mesmerising view, especially at night",5.0,,"Visited Marina Bay Sands SandsSkypark Observation Deck a weekend night. Had booked tickets online from the official website so didn't need to queue up for the tickets.

The entrance is not from inside the hotel but instead from the entrance of Hotel Tower 3 (nearest one). SGD 23 at the current time is the fee.

The view up from the observation deck is mesmerising and excellent - especially at night. The city looks much more beautiful in the night than in the day, actually. The Supertree Grove, Indoor Conservatoires, Singapore Eye, the sea, the tall imposing buildings of HSBC, Citi, etc. are a sight to behold.

A light and water show takes place at 8 and 9 pm every day and additional show at 10 pm takes place during Friday and Saturday. Though I saw the show from top, I recommend travellers to view it from the ground level.

There's a restaurant and bar there, CELAVI, where we didn't eat or drink anything, though. Definitely, I'd recommend Sands Skypark Observation Deck and it is rightfully the 9th Top Thing to do in Singapore!"
,,Good view but a little pricey,4.0,,"The view is good but it’s a little expensive for what it is, they do tell you the access restrictions when buying the tickets though."
,,Not Really Attractive,3.0,,"There is only a small area for you taking photo with small bar. You cannot enter to other place such as infinity pool or shopping place because it is for inhouse guest.

Thus, if you only visit for the view and taking photo, I will recommend, rather than that I will not recommend."
,,Beautiful And Nice Place Of The World,5.0,,"Excellent! Please, read my review on www.tripadvisor.com CE LA VI Restaurant. I was unbelievable and unforgettable time for my experience! At least after being working at sea for 37 years I was able to see these beautiful place!!!"
,,Skybar beer with a view,5.0,,Went to the Skybar in the hotel 20 Singapore dollars per person redeemable when you buy a drink. It was expensive but worth it.
,,Stay at the hotel to really get the experience,4.0,,"Hopefully you have not yet booked your hotel. You can stay at the hotel and fully immerse yourself in the infinity pool and 360 view of Singapore. I rate only 5 stars because the pool view is worth every penny.

The views are indeed spectacular if you are staying at another hotel.

If you are thinking of staying at the hotel, book via the Sands membership platform ie sign up and get a room for S$299 current special."
,,An iconic landmark of singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark on the top the floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a fantastic place to visit in the evening. There is an entry fee ( SGD 23??) to enter the skypark. The elevator from the Ground floor goes directly to the top floor. It is a bit crowded during the weekend but not so as there is a limit that how many people will be allowed to enter. One can see the whole of Singapore from this place. The views and lighting in the evening around Skypark are fantastic. There are two restaurants where you can have a snack, beer or dinner. Entry to the restaurant is also limited by number so that restaurants are not crowded. The price of all items is a bit high which is expected. You can spend 2-3 hours easily in the Skypark and this will remain as memorable event throughout your life."
,,Amazing building,5.0,,"My wife and I went up to the Skypark and the views are amazing.
I would recommend the experience but don't bother with paying extra for the drink up there. Just pay to go up and enjoy the views. We chose the drink because when I asked what it was we were told it was a Singapore Sling, so we said yes as it;'s something you should try when you visit Singapore. However when we got up to the top and gave our vouchers to the man at the bar what we got was a drink that was not a proper cocktail. It was a rather poor and weak tasting slush drink, like you would give a child but with a touch of alcohol in it, It wasn't what we expected and not very enjoyable. Certainly not worth the extra money."
,,View is cool but...,3.0,,"So the view from the top of Marina Bay sands is very cool. You can see the flower domes and the garden by the bay, as well as a lot of the city. Definitely tourist must do.

HOWEVER, I highly recommend going to Ce La Vie (the restaurant on the very top floor of the hotel) instead of the Skypark itself. It costs $20 USD to enter (which is cheaper than just the Skypark fee) and includes a free drink (we got an amazing Singapore Sling and Whiskey Sour). It was virtually empty mid-afternoon and we were able to sit, enjoy our drinks and admire an unobstructed view of the entire city. The bar wraps around so you get the exact same views as the Skypark!!"
,,Fantastic views.,5.0,,"Fantastic views from up there, especially at night....can spend hours up there....treat yourself to a meal at one of the fantastic restaurants."
,,Skypark,5.0,,"we had a wonderful time to appreciate the place since we stayed in the same hotel, it was magnificent,worth every penny,we really had a wonderful time savouring the pleasure of being there and enjoying the view of the Skypark."
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,Mesmerising views from the marina bAy park...can see the whole off Singapore from the top...must visit...
,,Is that it?,1.0,,"What a huge disappointment and a sense of being ripped off! We have visited sky towers in other locations and enjoyed them.
I guess if you go at night and there's some sort of show, then the $20 approx price tag may be worth it.
Not at all if it's day time. Smoggy atmosphere made visibility poor, no shade nowhere to sit and enjoy the view. Incredibly hot. And as keen music lovers across many genres the music was awful.
We felt entirely ripped off"
,,Best at night,5.0,,Best to go at night. It gives a top view of Gardens By The Bay. You can also see the Esplanade and The Flyer from here and a lot of the city. It’s worth the money. It’s located at the rooftop of Tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands Hotel
,,Worth visiting for the novelty,4.0,,"Short queue for the lift up & the views from the top are amazing, although we had it a bit hazy. You can't access the infamous infinity pool unless you are a resident though."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,A memorable and exquisite experience which lingers on your mind for decades and perhaps a lifetime...Unique setting epitomizing creative architecture and lavish surroundings and iconic themes....
,,Top of Singapore,4.0,,Skypark is a great way to see all famous landmark of Singapore. You can also sip a drink on the rooftop and enjoy the breathtaking view of this phenomenal city.
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"Free visit to the 57th floor ... and you will see the complete view on Singapore from the sky !
It is great !! Day and night !
You can dine, just take a drink of even just watch !
If your are the hotel client you have access to much more area ...including better view spaces and the fabulous pool !"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Very helpful staff sorted out our issues with our online booking. Lovely to have Singapore slings whilst viewing the Singapore skyline.
,,Wonderful but expensive,5.0,,Love having a drink on the rooftop when in Singapore. Lovely at sunset and the night lights are spectacular. A beer up here costs $20!
,,Fantastic views from up there!,5.0,,The sheer scale is what takes your breath away. From a distance it looks big but once up on the Skypark roof it is brilliant and you can see for MILES!
,,Okay,3.0,,Okay. Great views of course but nothing much other than the deck. Better if you are staying at the hotel and get to use the infinity pool. Didn’t spend much time up there.
,,Captivating view of Singapore downtown and landmarks,5.0,,I got discounted tickets and for $18 was at 57th floor of this huge hotel. Downtown glittering with lights with Singapore.dlyer on one side and gardens by the bay on another. Soaked all this beauty in my eyes and memory forever.
,,Great Views,5.0,,It costs 23$ to go to top.. NO you don't go by the famous pool. thats only for hotel guests. but we did get a glimpse of it all the way around the other side of where the elevator drops you. Take lots of pictures
,,Amazing place with great a great view of the night Singapore,5.0,,My experience at Marina Sands Park was speechless. This is the place you definitely should visit someday with no doubt you all.
,,Beutiful as alwat Marina Bay,5.0,,This is a must see in Singapore. Be on the roof top and experience the beautiful skyline of Singapore especially by night.
,,A Must-Do Singapore Experience,5.0,,"The rooftop infinity pools and viewing platform at Marina Bay Sands hotel is such a Wow! The pools and surrounding areas are kept in pristine condition with guards patrolling to ensure that people are not just safe, but that they do not eat or drink in the pool.

The service is superb, but prices are high. Two fresh coconuts by the pool cost a whopping S$24.50.

Non residents of the hotel may access the infinity pools for an hour for S$23.00 per person. Not sure if that includes taxes."
,,Breath taking view,5.0,,You can spend your time as long as you want. I just could not access to the resto on top. How I wish to indulge myself after a long hectic meeting in Spore.
,,Need to do,4.0,,"We purchased two $20 coupons from the Ce La Vi desk on the ground floor. These can be exchanged for drinks / food in their bar on the roof.
These give you access to only about half the roof area - you need to be a hotel guest or buy a different ticket to get to the rest.
The views are fantastic and well worth the trip. We used our coupons towards 2 Singapore Slings which were enjoyed overlooking the Gardens by the Bay"
,,Not worth the trip,2.0,,"No doubt you get a great view of the city from there, but the area that you can access is very limited. It's all done in 15mins for 23SGD for non-mbs hotel guest! It's a tourist trap!"
,,great view over Singapore,5.0,,"Nothing for the fainthearted, but a spectacular view over Singapore, Prices are reasonable, Senior Discount possible"
,,Must see,5.0,,Don’t miss this if visiting Singapore. Easy to book and wow the views. Best attraction by far. Book via internet for easy access with an e-ticket. Then spend as long as you like taking in the breath-taking views.
,,Outstanding,5.0,,Amazing views and fabulous to visit in the evening. Lovely cocktails overlooking amazing views across the city. Well worth a visit.
,,One of its kind in the world,5.0,,"What a fantastic view and it is crowded on weekends. But we were at a dinner organised there and enjoyed the view, food and atmosphere."
,,Poor for 23 bucks,1.0,,"We lined up to go up top and noticed not many people were actually buying tickets and were walking off.
We were told our admission would entitle us to stand in a small section at one end. No food drinks or seating available. So basically up and down.
I think if you really want to experience this great attraction. I recommend staying the night at the hotel."
,,Great views,5.0,,Fantastic views over Singapore. The viewing platform has plenty of info about the sites you can see and boy it’s a great urban viewing platform Highly recommended
,,Good view and worth one visit,4.0,,the place is crowded in the evening. It take time to get to the elevator and is mostly crowded. But its worth one visit.
,,Views to die for,4.0,,Had a wonderful experience but was forced to buy a photograph for 60 dollars which was a rip off. Enjoyed the views.
,,SUPERBE,5.0,,"A very nice place to go.... lots of things to do around,..... shopping... eating... casino.... have a drink... see lots of people... at the end a nice place to enjoy!"
,,Views to die for.,4.0,,"This is a must day or night , we did it a night as part of the Gardens on the bay .light show... do not miss.. spectacular light show and music. GREAT NIGHT."
,,Marina Singapore,5.0,,Excellent modern architecture and efforts to maintain it. A place worth visiting ehen you are in Singapore
,,Alan,5.0,,This is the jewel in the crown. Stunning views. Just brilliant. Have to see for yourself to believe it. Loved it
,,Mr,4.0,,Went to the casino. Huge which you can enjoy but stay away from the tables . Have a walk around the different gambling tables downstairs but enjoy a drink upstairs.
,,Eyecatching,5.0,,Loved this place. Views were great and top class selection of places to eat in side. Light show was brilliant to see
,,Hard to get into but WOW,4.0,,A bit confusing to find your way into the lift to go up but man what a building and what a view...This is also a must do .Only disapointing part was we wanted to have a dessert up there but they only do nibbles and meals.
,,What a view!,4.0,,Great view of Singapore from SkyPark. Pleasantly surprised that there were no queues although disappointed that we were only permitted to have one drink at the bar and couldn't re-enter the observation deck.
,,Must watch,5.0,,This hotel is one of best attractions in Singapore. U can pay 18 s dollars to go to viewing deck . From where u see the most of Singapore . The infinity pool is best here . But only for guests staying in hotel
,,Amazing,5.0,,You need to stay in the hotel to experience this fully but you can get a glimpse by paying 20 SD to go up to the bar. (The cost basically covers one drink.) You'll see the pool and a bit of the gardens and amazing views of Singapore both the city and the harbour.
,,Night tour to skydeck,5.0,,"Went on a night tour lift to 54th
floor
Staff took a photo on entry which you are offered for a fee about $70 expensive but photo was so good we decided to buy it
Views amazing and great place to take pics overlooking gardens by the bay
Worth going"
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,"The views are amazing, even on a cloudy day! The pool is always full, even on a cloudy day! Can be a bit to busy if you are just looking to chill out!"
,,Super cool like the Rich Rich Asians,5.0,,"Went up to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark to admire the view and enjoy a cocktail,following the advise of a colleague Trip Advisor review I purchased the ticket to get access to the Skypark terrace and used the fee paid to pay in part for a cocktail, the view is magnificent and the architecture is amazing. The restriction was to go to the pool area reserved only for guests, Enjoying a cocktail and the view and the people watching was fabulous , the weather was perfect and had a leisurely drink and edamame, there are two bars I spent my time closest to the infinity pool, the oposite side had a restaurant and a bar, Excellent time"
,,Great views,5.0,,"Went here for the views and it was worth it
Paid 20dollars to go up to the bar and that was great as we could use the 20 dollars towards food/drink - cocktail was 23dollars so got a delicious Singapore sling - we had chance to stroll around and see most of the bars /restaurants and the infinity pool on the top with amazing views"
,,The view is amazing,5.0,,"If you are not staying at Marina Bay Sands, you can enter the skydeck by paying SGD 24$. It takes you to the topmost floor where you can have an amazing view of the entire city. You can spend all the time you want. The best advice would be to visit is around 4-5 pm so that you can view an amazing sunset and also have a night view when the entire city is lit up. You can witness all the important tourist points from this place. It's worth every penny. The entry to the infinity pool is restricted though and they allow only the hotel guests there. There is a light and sound show there as well around 7.30 pm. You can also visit the mall, casino etc which again is very huge and does not have any entrance fees"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Views from the top if this hotel we're fantastic. You are limited to a part of the rooftop but still get amazing views.
Not sure the Singapore Sling was worth the money but compared to buying the genuine Sling from Raffles, it probably was.
Very hot the day we were there but very much worth the visit"
,,GREAT,5.0,,as guest of the hotel we had free admission and we have been here 5 times over a period of 2 days during the day and the evening. Great experience.
,,A must see,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore, don't ever miss this. Go there before dark til evening. A magical view you will see."
,,Pool is great - Hotel service appalling,5.0,,"It started with a 45 minute wait to be served to check in then it just got worse and worse. Screwed up our booking and could not put us on the same floor as couple we were travelling with. Then could not offer our friends a garden view room and tried to pass off the lower grade city view as a ""free upgrade"". Eventually after much arguing both couples has garden view rooms with us on the 39th floor and the other couple in a smaller room on the 22nd floor. No offer of refund or compensation.

Then the problems started! They managed to balls up all our bags and sent our bags to the other couples room and vice versa. That took another hour or so to sort out and when I complained about the service they would not reply to me and only changed the subject.

We decided to meet upstairs and have a drink at a bar up on the Skydeck. Yes this is (an alledged) 5 star hotel and we did expect higher than normal prices what following was just gob smacking. $132 for two bubbly wines and two beers!!! You've got to kidding!!

We also wanted to book into the Italain restaurant that evening but that ws closed for a private function. This must have been the reason they refused to acknowledge or return any of my emails I had sent to book this place months prior to our arrival.

So we decided to just do our own thing ate out away from this ""joint"" at Newton's Circus and Satay Street over the next couple of nights and also taking in Gardens by the Bay and the two magnificent conservatoriums.

Stupidly we used the hotel's concierge to book our transfer back to the airport which included having our luggage picked up from our rooms 15 mins before. no one turned up to collect our bags so we took them down stairs ourselves to meet out transfer. Guess what? The transfer failed to arrive!!

Ended up just grabbing a cab that was dropping someone else off.

We paid $500 a night for a once in a lifetime 5 star experience and all we got was appalling service. BUT MOST ANNOYING AND INSULTING WAS THE COMPLETE LACK OF CARE OR EMPATHY ANYONE SHOWED ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS.

Our advice - look somehwere else - don't bother.

P.S. - Still waiting for someone to reply to my email detailing our experience."
,,Great view,5.0,,"Great view of this city, boats in the port,a must do while your in singapore. Don't buy the Singapore sling slushy $15 for a cup of yuck! Though. And the shopping underneath fantastic. A must see for any person travelling to singapore."
,,CE LA VIE BAR THE BEST PLACE FOR AN EXCELLENT VIEW,5.0,,"Rather than wasting money just visiting the observation deck we paid $20 to go up to Ce La Vie bar. We we allowed to redeem the $20 against a drink which seemed brilliant value to us as the views were spectacular and we had a view of the infinity pool which you can't see from the observation deck.

We had 2 Singapore Sling cocktails each and a Chill Crab pizza and enjoyed the ambience so much we could have sat there all day.

If you want a view from the top this is surely the best option to take!"
,,Miracle Gardens,5.0,,"Unique experience under the Dome. It’s worth visiting Gardens by the Bay, even if you are short of time when in Singapore."
,,Incredible view.,5.0,,"This building is nothing less than a masterpiece, and the skypark view is a must when you visit Singapore."
,,2nd part of night city tour,4.0,,"Went here after the light show at Gardens by the bay, it was a long walk through the hotel to the lifts where you had to queue but queue moved quite quickly then 56 or 57 floors up to observation deck with some nice evening views over Singapore. Photo taken against green screen on way to viewing area is ready when you come back in as a really nice photo which was about $20 for the photo in a parer folder wallet."
,,Spectacular city views!,5.0,,"If you want one spot for great city views, this is it! Pay $35.00 to access the viewing area or $20.00 to go to the bar/restaurant Cie La Vie (the $20.00 goes to a food or drink of your choice). We paid the $20.00 and were very happy to enjoy spectacular city and harbour views at a private table and with a cocktail in hand. At first we were skeptical, thinking cocktails would be outrageously priced, but were pleasantly surprised to find most to be about $23.00. The food was also very reasonable as well, so in total we spent $46.00 vs the $70.00 we would have spent just for the viewing area. We also felt very lucky when a torrential downpour occurred that we could still enjoy the view outside (under umbrellas) when people on the viewing platform all ran inside. Would highly recommend!"
,,Breathtaking Views from top,5.0,,This is one of the landmark of Singapore and must visit place in Singapore. They charge you 20-25 SGD for going to the top of Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Try to visit this place somewhere in evening where you can witness Singapore both in daylight and at night. There is a magic in the transition. You can get good views of Gardens by the bay and supergroove. The place is usually not crowded so no need to make any advance bookings.
,,Worth the Price,4.0,,"I was skeptical at first about this experience due to the price of the visit $21 SGD. But my skepticism was quickly abandoned. Go at night. It can take time to get up to the sky deck due to the line and the capacity of the elevator try your best to be at the top by 7:45pm for the nearby Super Tree Grove light show below. It’s entirely worth it. The hotel also offers a Vegas reminiscent water and light show at 8pm that can be seen from the sky deck. Entirely worth the price of admission.

If you have time you can also access the Super Tree Grove from the hotel area there is an elevator to the pedway on the street side of the hotel. Ask one of the friendly hotel staff for directions."
,,"""Up in the clouds""",5.0,,"We weren't quite sure what to expect but we paid our $20 and got to the 57th floor. You get your money back through food or drinks and I'm pretty sure this is where they coined the phrase ""Happy Hour""!
It was spectacular up there in the clouds. The ambience was nice and not stuffy at all. The service was professional, friendly and the appetizers were ample and cooked to perfection."
,,A place out of this world,5.0,,"I visited this place and even though I did not stay in their hotel, the visits was worth the price we paid to go to the observatory. We stayed for almost all day there and sat in a beautiful restaurant looking at the whole city. What a construction and modernism. A well recommended place to visit."
,,Views great but poor ambience,3.0,,We visited the sky park before having dinner at C’est la vi. The views of the bay and the town were remarkable but there was no atmosphere there. Quite expensive for a view.
,,Packed with tourists and a charge to go up,3.0,,"Because of the views it is worth a visit, but beware that there is a cost to go up. You get a voucher for drinks equivalent to the cost of access and the views are amazing. Go in the early evening to watch the sun set and the laser light show."
,,A one off,4.0,,We had to go & see for ourselves this amazing structure that dominates the Singapore skyline. We paid the $20 each to access the bar which was then used towards our drink. 2 beers $27 each ( with tax). Anyway we decided this was a one off visit and stayed for a cocktail & nibbles. We walked away $100+ lighter but recognised the spectacular views and engineering that this place demonstrates was truly magnificent.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,We went to the Italian restaurant on the deck. The view was really nice. The Skypark is definitely a recommendation.
,,Perfect on a sunny day,4.0,,"We have been there during the day and the view was perfect of the bay, the harbour and the collonial district. It`s good that they describe the main buildings that can be viewed from the top."
,,Go for the view,4.0,,"We paid to go up for the view at sunset. We were there about 45 mins before the sun stared to go down so we could get a spot near the railing. We did NOT pay to go up to Ce la Vie (the bar on floor 57) but we could still get a beverage from the smaller bar on the 56th floor observation deck. The views are stunning. Well worth staying to watch the lights come on in the city below, especially over the harbor and gardens by the bay. It’s not cheap but this was something we knew we’d want to do while in Singapore"
,,It’s ok. A novelty.,4.0,,"Once you see it, I think it’s enough. Do marvel at the structure and the people, the workers — who built this massive modern monument in Singapore.

The Skypark is a narrow strip with restaurants, an infinity pool and a discotheque on top. You can have 360 deg (interrupted) view all over. Yes - it is fascinating... glad that my friend invited me over to enjoy it."
,,An architectural beauty,4.0,,The modern building is an architectural beauty with sky deck overlooking the well planned squeaky-clean of Singapore. The light and sound show in the evening by the pier is enchanting and free!
,,Great view,5.0,,"Firstly its only skypark ticket and not the pool or garden. You get discount on ticketing if you hold certain credit cards. Lift takes you up..not a long queue but could be 10 to 15 min wait.
On top the view is awesome. For us it was a nice cold night as it had rained a while back. You get nearly 270 degrees of view. Cbd, gardens by the bay are a view from above on one side.."
,,Always lovely to come back here,5.0,,"The sky park is so nice designed and decorated. It is impressive with all the different flowers and its magnificent waterfall. I always fell in love when I come back here just to enjoy the view from the top.
We have been here with our friend (his first time in Singapore) and he was very impressed.
Be warned: it can get cold in there and a little wet. Don’t be afraid of heights.

And my tip: be there in the morning. Most people come there to escape the heat in the midday ;-) then you don’t have to wait half an hour to take the elevator to the top!"
,,The pool!,5.0,,Only for hotel customers. If you are not staying in Marina Bay Sands go visit the public area. The town panorama is extraordinary!
,,Amazing location,5.0,,Wow an amazing site both from the ground and in the observatory...if your not a guess you pay to go up and view worth every penny ..views amazing and you get a free drink ..you see Singapore
,,Lunch and a cocktail with a view,5.0,,"There was a $20 fee to ride the elevator that went toward your cocktail or meal to go to the restaurants on the top. We went right when exiting the elevators and chose the restaurant on the end of the Skypark. Lots of seating with a bar outside. The menu wasn't extensive but there were many choices and as my group orders different items and share, all of the choices were good. There was an observation deck below us that was busy and great for people watching. When leaving we went to see the other restaurant and menu. Pretty much the same and their view was the infinity pool that is for hotel guests only. There was less outdoor seating at that restaurant."
,,Wasting time and money,1.0,,"Absolute overpriced. Nothing special. Other rooftop bars do have even better view then this bar.
The staff is lying too: even there are plenty seats available they act like queens and let you wait, just to show how special this bar should be - it’s not!
Also they don’t know what a Mojito is, they serve you some “Sirup”"
,,Good view (not 360) of Singapore city,4.0,,Go there at twilight. Gets crowded. Good view though it is not 360. you cannot see the sentosa island for instance. This open to public for a ticket price does not take you to the infinity pool area as that area is open to customers of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The view of the F1 tracks and the finance district is awesome. There is a restaurant as well open to public but the wait could be long to get a table.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Truly awesome, what a view and what an atmosphere. Well worth a visit. This is one of Singapore's marvels."
,,Cool but...,3.0,,"The sheer magnitude of this building and architectural design is really cool but getting to the top is a racket... The Observation deck is nice with great views but the cost for entry on this deck does not include access to any of the 3 bars/restaurants on the top. In fact, all have their own $20 charge for access. The Observation deck has the best views for photos but there is no place to sit and take it all in without paying again to go to the deck restaurants."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,It’s an iconic building of Singapore now and the engineering and views are stunning and worth a visit.... but would not stay here?.too many people and not a relaxing place
,,Extraordinary!,5.0,,"Having seen this building(s) from afar, the photos do not do it justice. I walked from my hotel (Swissotel The Stamford) to the MBS and right from the exterior, through the elaborate entry, one cannot help but be impressed. I thought if I trudged this in the humid and steamy conditions, I am going straight to the (SkyPark) too on the 57th floor. There were 2 alternatives, 1) $23 entry, gets you to a viewing area only on the 56th floor or 2) $20 gets you to one of 2 bars on the very top where you can eat and/or drink and get $20 worth of credit on your bill. I took option 2. What they don’t say is that option 2 doesn’t get you to the actual edge of the top floor but rather within the confines of the bars, and at one third of the span, all a good 3 or 4 metres from the edge. That said, I was still able to take some fabulous photos and see the busy harbour and panoramic surrounds in all their glory. The hospitality was great and as getting there was thirsty work, it wasn’t hard to drink up. There was no access to the pool area (for hotel guests only), but no matter really. Definitely worth a look, plus of course the obligatory souvineer shop is downstairs as well."
,,Great View,5.0,,We decided to go up to the park even though we felt it was a bit costly. Certainly a unique experience with amazing views across the city.
,,Conquering fear of heights....,4.0,,"Although I’m scared of heights, I had to do this and so glad I did. The view over the harbour of Singapore and Singapore overall, was nothing but spectacular. It was certainly well worth the $30 odd dollars it cost.

Make sure you stay and enjoy the view and breeze at the bar at the top. Although drinks are normal Singapore prices (expensive), it was certainly a cool experience. The cocktails advertised on a board were not what was available which was the downfall of not scoring the 5 stars from me.

I did however enjoy a Singapore Sling and was strong which I guess subsidies the cost!!!

Overall - highly recommend."
,,Go to the bar,4.0,,"This is a must do but rather than pay $25 for the skydeck view pay $20 for the bar which is redeemable for drinks at the bar.
Same view with shade and not so crowded. Drinks all $23plus and you’ll want more than one but still. It bad value for the experience."
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"It really is a must to do when in Singapore.The lift up is amazing ,you don,t even realise you are moving.It was very crowded but not unbearable.The view is truly amazing.After _we stayed and watched the living tree light show."
,,Wow what a view,4.0,,Well worth the price of admission An amazing 360 degree view of the city and all attractions. The Sunset was cloudy but nice
,,A MUST DO! Take the time ! Overcome your fear of heights!,5.0,,"The views are spectacular and is a MUST DO MUST VISIT site in Singapore. If you can, stay at the hotel and relax at the infinity pool on the 57th floor!"
,,Las Vegas style touristy crowds,2.0,,"We had actually contemplated staying at Sands during our recent SIngapore stay but over the years, having stayed in Singapore dozens of times, we have developed our favourite hotels and decided to stay with one of them.

And we are so pleased that we did, this was an awful experience! We decided that since we had never ventured to the newer parts of Marina Bay we would hop down to Sands and have quiet drink whilst taking in the view. What we found was simply awful.

There is a queue for the elevator to go up and you have to pay SGD 20 pp for access. This is then deductible from drinks at the bar. We had 2 glasses of red wine, which came to $80 (that's about USD 50+ for 2 glasses of wine. You also can't access the best views by the edges because all those areas are reserved for hotel guests, as is the pool area; which is actually fair enough because if we had decided to stay here we would have expected nothing less.

The place is crowded and touristy and highly reminiscent of the atmosphere in Vegas and the people it seems to attract are also the same type of people you find in Vegas, so if that's what you are looking for, go for it!! It wasn't for us and we won't be back and certainly won't stay in the hotel in favor of our regular quieter, less crowded more personal and intimate hotels, of which there are many in SIngapore. There are also many other places to have a rooftop drink with great views of the Singapore skyline.

In our estimation, this place is a fad which will wear off and in the meantine represents a noisy, crowded over-priced tourist attraction.

We were so pleased to get back to the peace and comfort of our regular hotel away from the tourist crowds at Sands."
,,Great view,3.0,,Nice view from the top. Not much to do up there as you can only visit a small part of the deck. You can buy a ticket with a Singapore sling- however this was a slush produced drink which I honestly don’t think had any alcohol in it. $23 for the trip and $30 for the drink. I would skip the drink and get a real one from the many bats throughout Singapore
,,BEST NIGHT EVER,5.0,,Had a small reunion in Singapore...the night out at Marina Bay Sands restaurant Cè LA Vi was amazing...the friendly n efficient staff..the great atmosphere..the mind blowing view..even if u don't drink..just go n have a feel of the view...Thank u assit.Manger Ruben for the amazing chat...A MUST VISIT WHILE IN SINGAPORE
,,Singapore!,5.0,,"We could not justify staying at the Marina Bay for the short time we were here in Singapore but we knew we had to visit the Skypark - it did not disappoint! Incredible views! We did it at night and also did the package that included a free drink (a very tasty gin cocktail).

We went up around 8ish and it was not too busy, we were not fighting for space and managed to get awesome pictures.

Defiantly a must when in Singapore!"
,,Amazing!!!!!!!,5.0,,"We stayed 2 nights at the Marina Bay Sands, the skypark was so lovely, I could spend months just relaxing up there. The pool is refreshing , the view is amazing and the food delivered to you from the restaurant in skypark,delicious, day and night. We will be back."
,,Great view of Singapore from 56th floor,5.0,,"The view was very good from the top and its refreshing. Having a drink at the counter and cool wind is just awesome. Definitely I have a strong memory with the place. Its 23 SGD just for the view, everything else needs to be paid separately."
,,Views!!!,4.0,,"Access to this is via Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We bought tickets($20 each) to get to the bar Ce La Vie. These tickets were then redeemable at the bar.This I believe is the 57th floor. The views are excellent but not as good as the observation deck where you could get closer to the edge. We did this trip as it was getting dark and as such there was a queue.
When we got to the top it was very busy. I struggled to get served at the bar even though one of the bartenders told his colleague I was next in line but the colleague just ignored him and served someone else. Cheers!!!!!!!
Part of the floor was closed for a private function (but no reduction in price).
If you want views of Singapore I guess this is the place. Get here before it turns dark and you may get a better chance of a seat and a better view.

Or even better if you can afford it, get a hotel room, then you can access the rooftop pool and more"
,,Impressive,5.0,,A great building with an amazing view. We went to the top for free going to the bar/lounge from building 1 called cé la vie and had a dring with the amazing view.
,,"Great views skip the ""Singapore Sling""",4.0,,"Skypark offers tremendous views of Singapore from the 56th deck. But the pitch for a Singapore Sling for add $7 was a tourist scam. Showed picture of a tall glass of traditional 20 oz cocktail but get 8oz of frozen punch worse than 7/11 slurpee.

See all of Singapore, sight of Crazy Rich Asians, casino and shopping across the street. Definitely must go and spend a few hours."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The place is incredible. Three 56-storey towers supporting a boat-like rooftop with pools, restaurants and palm trees! The panorama from the top is incredible. Unfortunately, access to the best places is reserved to hotel guests or ticket holders"
,,Living in the clouds.,4.0,,"It is an eagles eye view of the bay and business areas of Singapore. Part of formula 1 track can be seen. Sadly if you think you will have access to the whole rooftop area, you will be disappointed. The visitors only have access to the open area that protrudes out over the building. It is costly and if you pop into the rooftop bar, you won't be able to go back onto the roof."
,,Great views but not service,3.0,,"Visited the marina bay sands skypark yesterday.. amazing views & staff were friendly on the way up however went to the bar on the top ...different story. Was asked to show my ticket again. ..a bit ridiculous as you can't get to that level without your ticket in the first place,then I waited to be served at the bar after being ignored by 3 staff who were not busy serving anyone. The waiter did make me a mocktail which is not on the menu so i appreciate that however once I paid he didn't come back with the change. It took quite a while to get his attention to ask for my change & then he finally exlpained he was waiting for the till to be available. That's all fine however better customer service is to let your customer know what is going on rather than let me stand there wondering what was happening. I was also standing next to another customer who was also being ignored. I really think this bar attendant was 'over' his job. I expected alot better and happier staff."
,,Best ever Sky view,5.0,,"This is a must visit in Singapore. Best time is to go at the afternoon, spend time ....let the dark comes and they see the beauty of Singapore. Lights and shadows. This is the only place from where u can see the whole Singapore from the top. Really fascinating. By the way, u can enjoy in the rooftop restaurant as well. Must go place."
,,Spectacular view of the city,4.0,,Great place to take photos of this spectacular view of the city. Little maps at each vantage point explain what you are viewing.
,,A good view of the city,3.0,,"This is a great view of the city nealyn360 degrees but not quite, do not expect to see the pool as you can’t and do not expect a swim because unless you are staying at the hotel it’s off limits. Great for photo opportunities"
,,Great views but high pressure photo sales,4.0,,Amazing views and well worth the admission price. However be prepared to be hounded by the photography team! They do a green screen shot as you arrive (even though we tried to decline as knew we wouldn’t buy it - apparently saying no isn’t an option!) then when you come out of the lift they pounce! I politely told them we didn’t want it but they kept pushing. They reduced the price twice and were quite insistent - it was quite uncomfortable. They walked along beside us trying hard to sell to us. They really need to tone it down!
,,Great views from the pool,5.0,,This pool is iconic and amazing. Great views to the city. There are also three jacuzzi spas with views to the ocean side. Spago restaurant outside area is great for breakfast.
,,Amazing view but dinner rushed,3.0,,We had dinner at Ce La Vi here and while dinner was beautiful we could only book in two hour time slots. Just when we were relaxing we were rushed to order and three courses in two hours was too rushed for us. The views were spectacular over the port and if you want to impress this is the place to do it we have some special memories here and the Singapore light show was a highlight of the night.
,,Amazing feat of engineering & architecture,4.0,,"Stayed in Tower 2 with a great view of the Gardens by the Bay & the harbour. Skypark offered an amazing view, tried to get a drink in the evening at the bar Ce La Vie, but it was packed."
,,Spectacular Views of Singapore!,5.0,,This has the most beautiful views of Singapore. I experienced this at night and took some beautiful aerial shots of Singapore.
,,Very nice evening walk,4.0,,"Perfect environment to walk and have a drink. If you want to shop and loose a load of many, then this is alos the place to be. A place of peace nearby the financial district"
,,NIght time view excellent but very slow service,4.0,,Not cheap and quite a long queue but a thing you must do..It was however very busy and difficult to find a seat if just having a drink though you can book a table for a meal.
,,Must do,4.0,,"It was truly amazing up the top the view is great buy a souvenir and have a quick look of the famous pool but only the guests staying at Marina Bay can use, shame I know!!!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Day or night it takes your breath away. Top class restaurants, huge infinity pool and an incredible vibe day and night."
,,A view from 56th Floor,3.0,,"A bit disappointed to see it wasn't very windy at top. I was hoping to be blown away, but I guess the direction was not appropriate. Since we were not hotel guest, we only had access to 1/3rd of the rooftop. I could partially see the infinity pool and that seemed pretty cool.

The view was good. We went around 6 pm and came down at 7:30. Wanted to experience both sunlight and dark view of the city. The place wasn't very crowded since they control the number of people in there.

Overall, it's a good view. Not very windy or spacious."
,,Another Fantastic Singapore Landmark,5.0,,"WOW...breathtaking,head turning brilliant engineering and THE VIEWS....all from the comfort of a bar......WOW"
,,A must see,5.0,,Great view from the top and would be best to catch a sunset from here. I wouldnt recommend a swim in the very busy and crowded pool though...
,,Views are very incredible,5.0,,67 floors up and you can see the entire city. Views are spectacular. A must see. There is a nice restaurant called Lavo- Italian. Nice place to spend some time and view the scenery
,,Another Must,5.0,,"I was sceptical from a distance but once up close, or better still at the top, this is a must. True class. Aim to get up there just before dusk to gain the benefit of daylight views and nighttime lights."
,,$23 per adult is punchy...,3.0,,Whilst undoubtedly giving good all-round views of the city there is not a whole lot to do once you’re up there. Especially true in the rainy season as no shelter is to be found. I imagine on fine days the queues are significant and the subsequent disappointment magnified. Next time I’ll try out the views from the comfort of the Singapore Flyer (think London Eye).
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Wow incredible, amazing and super gread to visit the Skypark amazing views and for sure I’m going to come back Thanks"
,,View from the top is great,5.0,,"The ""View"" is great but if you want to drink make sure you buy a voucher before you get to the top. You can make the F1 track too and its a short walk away to look at the Pits."
,,Great view,4.0,,Wonderful view of Singapore though some seating would be appreciated. Went upstairs to ce la vie for somewhere to sit but found the views nowhere near as good and the drinks very expensive.
,,Great View,4.0,,"It’s definitely worth a visit to get a panoramic view of Singapore, Great place for a front and centre seat to the colourful laser and fountain shows by the bay. Take in the majestic sights of neon lasers piercing the night sky, metallic skyscrapers reflecting a spectrum of colours, and oriental river boats float lazily along the Singapore River."
,,WOW What a view,5.0,,This is a must visit attraction in Singapore.The views in all directions are stunning from the top. It is a perfect place to see the size of Singapore. We booked in advance and got easy access.
,,View on top of Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,We went up the Skypark late in the afternoon. We were able to wait and see the Light and Sound Show of the Supertree Grove at 7:45pm and the Light and Water Show at 8:00pm. Dining at the CE LA VI is by reservation.
,,Fabulous Park in the Sky,5.0,,"Simply stunning park complete with the longest infinity pool in the world, palm trees, jacuzzis, restaurants and loungers. Fabulous."
,,Not worth the price,3.0,,"For the price and the lines, you get access to a small area of the deck. The rest is hotel access only. So in my opinion, you are better off admiring the city in different parts. The structire itself is gorgeous but that is about it. I recommend visiting the areas arpund that have the Singapore flyer, the boardwalk and such."
,,MUST,5.0,,Visit and pay $100 for two drink and amazing view. I loved it. It is dance club so go at night and see a sunset there.
,,go at night!,5.0,,"it's really breathtaking up there! the wind was really blowing hard here and it was soooooo refreshing against singapore's humid and warm weather. you can just visit the skydeck (there's a fee though, i forgot how much cuz we visited last march 2017). you can stay as long as you want. there are many fancy restos up there but i think you need a reservation too. so if you plan to eat there, plan ahead and book in advance!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The view here is really nice, in both day and night. City lights are amazing at night. You can pay a ticket to enter and enjoy the view even if you are not a guest in a hotel. The walk to the towers at night was also very enjoyable."
,,Felt underwhelmed...,2.0,,"Pay to get access. Nothing up there but the view (which ok is a good one) but theres a cafe kiosk that made us feel like we were imposing on them, no seating other than a couple of bar stools and nothing else. lacked any effort to create an experience apart from selling you a staged photo

Pre-book on line to avoid a queue - we just accepted that it was a tick of a box, do it once to say its somewhere we had been, not something we would do again now."
,,Top of Singapore view,5.0,,Marina Bay Sand skypark on 56 th floor and we went to restaurant and bar at top 57th floor in evening till night. Beautiful amazing view of Singapore from top especially lighting of Garden by Bay . Reservation is needed to go to restaurant bar .
,,360 degrees,5.0,,"If you ever want to see the skyline of this exceptional city, there is no better place than skypark. It is quite affordable for non-guests and on a good weather day, it is one of the best places to be"
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,"Go up in the early evening to enjoy panoramic views over the hole region and stay up there until the light shows, which are timed perfectly so that you can move from one side to the other to enjoy both - Marina Bay and Gardens in the Bay"
,,Worth Paying For the Hotel Room - Else Just Buy Day Entry,5.0,,Its worth paying to stay in MBS only for the Skypark. The view is exquisite. The infinity pool out of the world. If you don't want to stay here then pay for the day pass just for the Skypark. It will be money well spent.
,,The view wow,5.0,,"We went to the top to the observation deck. The view from here was absolutely spectacular. You can see all over Singapore Harbor, The Bay of Gardens, Cloud Forest. We were luck enough to do it at night and see the fireworks, just beautiful."
,,Staggering views out over the city and harbour,5.0,,"Entry to the Skypark is from just outside the entrance door into tower number three.
The lift whisks you up 56 floors in seconds, before you step out onto the glass sided Skypark.
The views are amazing, looking out over Marina Bay and the city. Unfortunately you cant get along to closely view the infinity pool but you can see the water curving along the towers.
Buy tickets online to save money before travelling to this stunning building."
,,Stunning architecture and view from the observation deck,4.0,,Stunning architecture and view from the observation deck. The hotel itself is HUGE with a mall and restaurants and plenty to do for all the family. Can get crowded though.
,,Beautiful views over Singapore,5.0,,"Highly recommend a trip up and a slushy frozen Singapore sling to help you admire the view! Hang on tight to your camera, as there’s not much to stop you losing it off the side!! Great views of gardens by the bay, cloud forest, the light shows, the Fullerton Hotel & the flyer. Amazing at night!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,2.0,,"Did not enjoy our visit - We were told at the ticket desk that it is only the viewing deck that we could visit & although the views were amazing there were only 3 seats there (all occupied) & as my Wife has mobility issues she needed to sit down. We asked the bar person if there was any other seats they could provide only to be met with an abrupt ""NO"". So she sat on the stairs next to the 'do not sit on the stairs' notice!
Please put a few more chairs up there !!!"
,,"Infinity pool, observation deck",5.0,,The 2 things to do here are the infinity pool and the observation deck for a great view of Singapore and its harbours.
,,Overpriced tourist trap,2.0,,"Not much info provided where to buy the tickets to go up. Tickets to panorama terrace were 23 sgd, but going to the sky bar which is just 1 level above was 20sgd, fully usable to buy drinks or food up there. Extremely expensive restaurant. Staff are not tge friendliest. Better to see the panorama of Singapore elsewhere."
,,Great Views over the whole area.,5.0,,"I've been here before but still like to return. Amazing views all around the area. We had a phone from our hotel with tourist information on it and were able to get cheaper vouchers as we stood near the pay desk, saved about $5 each. Great photos from the top of the Gardens by the Bay too."
,,What a Fizzer!,1.0,,Great view from the observation deck - but don't waste your money approx $20 p.p if you want to see the night lights shows at 7.45pm or 8.45pm. Actually it's really a let down. The only way to experience the show is close to the ground. Sadly Very Disappointed. ☹️
,,Marinara Sands on the Bay,5.0,,"This was a really good experience we opted for the drink package that you buy a drink and go up to the top floor. Better than buying the entertainment ticket alone. You get a seat and drinks and something to eat, the views from there were amazing. We went around 5.30 pm not to busy."
,,Swimming Pools in the Sky,5.0,,"We went to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Tower 3, We used our credit from the elevator ride to eat at the bar. The food was very gourmet, but expensive. The view of the swimming pools that connected to each tower was worth it. We then sat for awhile and looked at the rest of the views."
,,crazy architecture,5.0,,"Love this city, love this building. Defs somethng to go see. Whole new world! Especially at night. Highly recommended"
,,Expensive endeavour but worth doing,5.0,,"About 20USD to go up to the roof but that acts as a food and drink credit. However, the food and drinks are so expensive you are still out of pocket money. A great experience to be on the roof and to say you have done it. Worthwhile despite the cost. You can't access pool and its busy and hot but still pretty cool!"
,,Great view especially if you are a hotel guest,4.0,,"There are certain areas that are only accessible if you have the hotel key card (eg infinity pool). For others, try you luck at the Ce la vie restaurant and bar area - it can be very crowded. There’s a S$20 entrance fee to get to the sky park and you can apply it towards the drinks. You will get a good view of the harbor with the many ships - very spectacular view. You can see Indonesia on a clear sky day. You may be able to get a glimpse of the big Wheel and garden by the bay."
,,Outstanding views,5.0,,Although it costs to do this ( around $28 NZ) it is definitely worth the money. The views are stunning and gives you a real sense of the layout of Singapore. There is food and drink available at the top but alas no access to the infinity pool - that’s reserved for hotel guests.
,,Great views but pricy,3.0,,"Views of marina,commercial district and gardens by the bay is really good. 23 dollars for adult and 17 for children is very high price to pay just for the view."
,,Thrilling,4.0,,"It's expensive, but worth it in my opinion. I absolutely loved the views, there weren't that many people and it was a pretty magical moment for me. Unfortunately the rain came as I was enjoying a delicious mojito and within minutes the bar was closed and it all came to an abrupt end!"
,,Wow Factor,5.0,,Well worth the stay at MBS just for first only section at the skypark . Fantastic experience having cocktails by the pool as we watched electrical storm in the distance and took in the amazing skyline . Live life and book a room for few nights you won't regret it .
,,over crowded,1.0,,"to spend the $$ here, it's better off spend else where. over crowded!! over rated!! not worth the amount paid to visit it."
,,Sands Skypark,5.0,,"Purchased discounted tickets for Sands Skypark as part of a travel package. Entrance to the Skypark is outside of Tower 1 of Marina Sands hotel, down the escalators. We planned to see the sunset from the observation deck, due to clouds there was not a spectacular sunset. However the view was well worth the price of the tickets. You are limited to the observation deck area only. There is no crossing over to the other towers or seeing the infinity pool unless you are a guest of the hotel. There is a snack shack and sitting cocktail lounge for simple food at the top. There is no shade cover so be aware if you go up at the heat of the day. Take a good camera and patience as everyone is crowding the rails to get their photos and selfies."
,,Expensive view,5.0,,"The very high elevation does allow for a good view of the Bayside area, Gardens and city. Excellent for day or night time viewing."
,,Nice place to visit and take good pictures!,4.0,,We visited on Monday September 24th 2018. We were there in the late afternoon so we got to take good pictures of Singapore during daytime and more pictures of Singapore in the evening. Evening pictures looks better with all the lights!
,,Iconic attraction,5.0,,This is one of the iconic attraction of Singapore. highly recommended to share a drink on the top roof overlooking the city.
,,Worth visiting if you want great Photos,4.0,,get out at BayFront MRT station to go inside the marina Bay Sands Hotel to go to the top floor to catch a aerial view of Singapore. The views from the top of this Hotel are really very good and you end spending a lot of time taking photographs . The ticket to this is lot cheaper compared to the Singapore Flyer ( same as London eye ) and offers better opportunity of a lot of photography. You can do only one out of the two but I would vote for marina Bay Sands Hotel skypark.
,,Must visit,5.0,,We went to the cocktail bar above the Skypark. Need to get a tickets to ride the lift to the top which is redeemable against a 'house' drink. View is worth it and no need to stay more rthan a couple of drinks.
,,Amazing Man-made Structure!,5.0,,This is one of the most popular attractions and hence it was crowded. Go here during sunset to get the best view of the city. Worth a one time visit!
,,Worth the money,5.0,,"Awesome views , was a bit dubious about the ticket price but well worth it, would be great if some of the info detailing what you are looking at was in English as well"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,What a view best time to go is around sunset so you can take pictures in day light and then stay around for night fall and get the magnificence of Singapore at night and also the gardens put on a beautiful show worth the trip.
,,Very busy,3.0,,"This is very popular so it is busy. We were staying at the hotel so no cost for us to go up.

There is a good bar area to have a drink and get some food from the great Hight.

Only hotel guests can use the pool."
,,Great view of Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing views of Singapore, also worth going up to Spago and having a drink while relaxing and enjoying the views."
,,Best view of the Bay Area,5.0,,"It is breath-taking to view Singapore from way up here, well worth the cost of entrance to check it out. Make sure to bring sun screen or a hat as there are hardly any places for you to hide under the hot sun. The best time to visit this place is just before dark so you can enjoy the view of the city before and after dark. You have to visit this place at least once."
,,a VEGAN snack and a drink :),5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is like a magnet; you see it from everywhere in Singapore! ... your curiosity engages and it wins :) ... as it should!! This place has epic views and the architecture is amazing!
I can't believe how fast and smooth the elevator is!! You're greeted by a green-screen photo opportunity and a sales pitch for your photos.
I visited during the daytime. It's hot up there ... wear a hat and bring your personal fan ;)
Once you leave the observation deck and enter the bar, you can't go back. It's OK though; cold beverages, snacks, and a slightly higher view are available! *red umbrellas are coveted fast ... grab one! ;)
I ordered the Steamed Black Mushroom Dumplings and a chilled vino. The dumplings were a bit spicy for my palate, but good.
This is a must see in Singapore!"
,,Viewing Superb skylines of Singapore,5.0,,"Skypark is one of the most incredible spot of Singapore to view the city, bay and its high-rise structures. The evening view is awesome specially. You can feel the lights and lives.."
,,A must when in Singapore,5.0,,The skylark is on the 57 th floor of the hotel and has a sky bar and an infinity pool. It costs about 23 SGD to go up onto the skywalk but if you go via the hotel and ask for a ticket to the sky are its only 20 SGD and the ticket entitles you to 20 SGD worth of food and drink...no brainier. I sat on a comfortable settee for over an hour with a finger meal and drink. It's the same view as you get from the sky walk viewing platform
,,HighLight of Our Stay,5.0,,"We booked this via RMG and Keith our Guide was informative and friendly. We had courtesy collection and drop off from our Hotel and included in this was a River Cruise and Rhapsody Light Show at The Gardens of The Bay
The Skywalk was everything we had imagined and more. We did the evening viewing and the views are Amazing. It is a must do! For everyone visiting this wonderful city.
Included was a lovely cruise to Clark Quay"
,,15 minutes of Meh and staff quite rude.,3.0,,"Our overall experience can only be described as ‘meh’.

The staff are SO rude and insistent to buy this crappy photoshopped photo of yourself it’s irritating! We said no the first time when we arrived and then we got haggled again not only once but 3 times waiting for the lift down! It’s beyond ridiculous and needs sorting!

There is also absolutely no shade at the top so wouldn’t recommend going until sundown with young children as you will get roasted.

We spent literally no longer than 15 minutes up there, the view was okay but honestly this is just not worth the money! If we come back we definitely won’t be doing it again and I won’t be recommending it to friends either.

Depends on how much cash you have to splash but personally I Think the 3 stars is generous, and this view point is overrated."
,,"The view from the skypark was excellent, but the staff were rude",3.0,,The view from the skypark was excellent. You can see the city in many directions. The staff on the other hand were very rude.
,,Cocktails,5.0,,"Went to the bar. It costs you twenty dollars, but you can use your ticket against your bar bill. Cocktails from 22 dollars and beer was from 16 dollars. View is brilliant. To eat dinner is expensive."
,,Sands Skypark Observation deck,3.0,,"Whilst the Sands Skypark Observation deck offers great views of the island, I personally think it’s not a must go to place.

The most disappointing thing was the way the staff forced you to be photographed against your will, then when you arrive a minute later at the deck, the sales staff shoves the photo in your face forcing you to purchase it. We thanked them and walked away. On completion of our visit, they hounded us yet again while we were waiting for the lift. This sort of behaviour should stop as they were quite aggressive and unpleasant."
,,Amazinng,5.0,,Went here for a meal in the Italian restaurant had to book before we left UK gets very busy got greeted when we arrived the views were amazing staff were very professional food arrived pretty quick was not cheep but new before we booked it was well worth it terrace outside with bar and music service slow much better at night to get full view of city all lit up and seeing parts of the GP track would recommend and would go again next time in Singapore
,,Let down,1.0,,"It was hot and the glare off the deck was ridiculous.

There is no shade, no where to sit.

People have mixed reviews in this with the Cie La Ve bar. The sky deck is not that.

The skydeck is a waste of money. It was hands down the worst place we went to. Spent a lot and got little.

Cie La Ve bar sounds significantly better.

Be aware that reviews on this site indicate that the Cie La Ve bar is the same as the skydeck. It's not. I have no idea how the skydeck ranks as high as it does. Just about anything else in Singapore is better.

As a family of 4 with a two year old there was nothing up there for us. We were there for less than 20 minutes.

TBH I'd have preferred to have ridden around in a cab for 30 minutes than gone there."
,,must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,It was fantastic experience to visit sky park. I would suggest ppl to go by evening to see the city in sunlight and stay there till 8PM to see the city at night lights.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,Elevation to the roof skypark is from the 3rd building and an outdoor elevator which gets you to the 52nd roof floor where you are gobsmacked with exhilarating views - a must when visiting Singapore
,,Luxury plus,5.0,,"Luxury plus. The family rooms are massive by anyone's standard, beautifully cleaned and had more charging points for devices than you could poke a stick at. The staff are very attentive and helpful and there is a heap of dining that is only a small walk away.
We arrived early with a family of 4. We were allowed to drop our luggage off early and were presented with temporary passes so that we could use the pool that this place is so famous for...... And wow, the pool has to be seen to be believed!
The only thing you could fault the place for is the water pressure and temperature controls in the shower, but that is being very picky. Also, be prepared to sell one of your kidneys if you want to purchase anything in one of their shops."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,An expensive place to drink but worth it for the views and to say you have been! Really is wonderful to see the whole of Singapore and a great view of the flyer and gardens by the bay
,,Experience,3.0,,A place is a must to see but don’t expect too much. However - a popular destination shout not be skipped.
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"When we arrived in Singapore our driver told us that if we wanted to visit this tourist spot the best way is to go via the Ce La Vi bar, the ticket is S$20 each but you can use that as a credit against a drink or food. When we got there we went to the Ce La Vi reception and asked some questions and we were told that we could not use the observation deck and could only stay in that area!!!! Ummm she we didn’t bother and just went up the regular way S$24 to the deck. When you get there we realised we had been given the wrong information at the desk.... you could sit in the bar in the open air with a drink above the observation deck!!!!
Should of listened to our driver with local knowledge.
But TBH the views are better from 1-Altitude bar just across the city."
,,Observation Deck,5.0,,Had a quick ride up the elevateor to the Observation Deck and had wonderful views over Singapore. This would be amazing in the evening or when th Grand Prix is on.
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,Totally amazing views! So pleased we decided to do this as it was spectacular. We visited early morning so it was very quiet. I would like to revisit at night. The photos offered were very expensive. As we left the girl on the booth approached us and offered the photos for half the price so don't rush into buying them! Don't visit if you have an issue with heights!!!
,,Amazing views,5.0,,It’s a bit steep paying $23 just to go up and have a look (and you can’t even check out the pool area sadly) but it is worth it fir the views - absolutely spectacular views!!!
,,Amazing view,5.0,,- No restriction - Purchase ticket online to visit Rooftop deck - Casino entry is free - world class brand
,,Well worth it,5.0,,We couldn't decide if we should pay to go to the top but the views from up there were well worth it. It really gives an amazing perspective to a great city.
,,A little hit up top,3.0,,"There is no doubt that you get some amazing views of Singapore from the deck on level 56 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It was a clear day for us and so we could also see Malaysia. However, it is very hot in the full direct sun and so you cannot spend much time there. I would suggested taking an umbrella for sun protection. Your ticket (adult 23SGD) only provides access to the deck area. I’d recommend going up at night for the laser show, particularly if you have been on the Singapore Flyer."
,,"Crap,",1.0,,"You pay to go to the top, you get out cant go any where but the wooden deck, 35c no shade,to buy a drink that was mostly water, no wheel chair access absolutely the worst place we visited in Singapore."
,,Ce’La Vie sky bar,5.0,,"20 dollars and you can go up. The voucher is for one drink, worth the price. Beautiful view, the city lays under your feet. Wonder how would it be at night when clubbing :)) I don’t upload pictures, you must go up."
,,Great views and ambience,5.0,,"You will pay for the great views, ambience and overall good good and drink. If you don't mind spending a bit and the weather is favourable this is a very nice place to pass a few hours."
,,"""ENORMOUS BREATHTAKING VIEW """,5.0,,"Never miss view !! its an eye catcher!! enjoy ur food ,drinks and live music at "" CE LA VI "" Strait hold on urself at 56th floor !! and exactly to your left you will find Singapores open sky swim talk to cloud and enjoy cool breeze!! perfect for romantic getaways !! and difficult to register your table on weekends !! smoking is allowed !!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Amazing hotel. one of the best tourist attraction and must visit in singapore. Located at Marina Bay is gives u the amazing view of the Garden by the Bay and other near by attractions.
,,Skyline of Singapore,5.0,,"When you are in Singapore for a business or personal visit, do not miss out to visit this mesmerizing attraction. The Laser show every evening is very good. The rooftop swimming pool is just fantastic."
,,360 Degree City View,5.0,,MBS Sky park a must go place for if u r in Singapore !! Breathtaking city view. I went there in moring.
,,What a view from the top,5.0,,Really amazing and wonderful. It is on top the three 56 storey towers of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Visitors are allowed only on a restricted area and deck. There is a swimming pool and Restaurent for the Hotel guests.
,,Weekend in Sinapore,5.0,,"This has to be the best view from any bar I've ever been too. Make sure you go at sunset. To access the bar without paying the entrance fee. Ask to use the bar at reception. It will cost you $20 but you get this back in tokens. The drinks are expensive for Asia but similar to pricing for Sydney or New York but considering the view totally worth it.
Also if you are after the famous infinity pool shot. Make sure you stay at the hotel only way to access the pool!"
,,A wonderful bird's eye view of the city skyline,5.0,,"The Skypark boasts of unobstructed and exhilarating views whichever way I turn. If you visit during the country's National Day itself, you might get a chance to experience the awesome fireworks really close. Visitors to Singapore must at least visit this place once. The infinity pool is only open to hotel guests, unfortunately."
,,Up with the gods,5.0,,"Awesome experience, spectacular views and great photo opportunities. Worth checking out, if you are not to good on heights then there is plenty of room to walk without getting close to the edge and still enjoy the views."
,,Iconic building,4.0,,"This is an iconic building - and a landmark that stands out. It is in a prominent location.

The view from the top is breath taking and spectacular. Ticket prices are on the high side (about GBP20 April 2018) - but it is one of things that you need to do and cross off your list."
,,Best part of the hotel!!,5.0,,"Ok, so we stayed at the hotel for two nights (see separate review of the hotel itself) and I was underwhelmed. The skypark was a completely different story. Bring up there was like being on the set of a movie - it really is spectacular. We all loved the pool, poolside service is excellent (if a little pricey, but what do you expect here, right?!) and the restaurants are great. I didn’t enjoy staying at the hotel but I was glad we did for the experience of hanging out at the Skypark."
,,Great views.,5.0,,The views from the sky park were breathtaking. I would however have been a little disappointed if we had paid to visit as there other places that have fantastic views. We were lucky enough to be staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel so didn’t have to pay.
,,"A ""must see"" in Singapore",5.0,,"You have a really great view around and over the City of Singapore. Not really cheap to go up there, but really worth the money."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"I'm not sure it's worth the price, but the views are stunning, and you'll be disappointed if you don't do this as a tourist, it's spectacular."
,,Good Views,4.0,,"A must do, if you can not afford the £350 per night to stay in the hotel, just like me, about £20 to go to the top, well almost, only the bars and swimming pool above, you are told you are not allowed up to see them, Well worth going up, take your own photo, they are expensive.
Go on your own, a trip is short, they just want to get you down to the boat ride, then you hang around for 30 mins."
,,Good aerial view of Singapore,4.0,,Best time to visit on August weekends where there is National Day rehearsals Can watch fireworks and aeroplanes
,,Nice views of Singapore city.,4.0,,"I didn't stay at the hotel. The ticket counter at tower 3, B1 floor then follow the line to 56th floor. I spend 2 hours around 3pm.-5pm. that very hot sun. I recommend you come in the morning. Open from 9.30am.
Tip: You can buy the ticket online from their site or other mobile app."
,,Kind of expensive,3.0,,"Infinity Pool is exclusive to hotel guests, but you can visit the observation deck (and see the pool from the side) without checking in to the hotel. It's kind of pricey and very hot during daytime. Singapore Flyer is on the other side of the bridge and worth considering.

Reach this observation deck by alighting at the MRT station Bayfront. For Singapore Flyer, take the Promenade station instead."
,,"Amazing views across all Singapore - just do it, you won't regret it.",5.0,,Catch middle tower elevator to the restaurant and the fee is reimbursed when you drink at the bar. The view is worth every penny. One day I'll afford to stay here and get in that infinity pool.
,,Nice overview of Singapore,4.0,,Nice hotel and Landmark place of Singapore. Worth to visit the terrace of the hotel. Centrally located. You can see whole Singapore. Very good place to shoot nice pics.
,,"Stunning place, unique in the world",5.0,,"I spend couple of days and nights in this amazing hotel. The views from the rooftop pools are amazing day or night. Of course, expensive place, but it deserves a visit if you go to Singapore."
,,Great views,5.0,,"A must for more sviews of the city and the gardens on the bay , even a souvenir and food stall at the top"
,,Probably worth the entrance fee.,4.0,,"Visited early about 1030 am therefore no queues. It’s only a viewing platform with a restaurant and cafe. The views are fairly spectacular. Not for you if you think you will be going to see the hotel infinity pool, it’s not included."
,,Top of the world,5.0,,"The views were awesome. Could see the light shows from the top which were amazing. Have a drink at the bar, catch a breeze"
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"Yes the view are wonderful but that is it. I would recommended pre booking to save on the queues, we popped in the day before and booked. If you join the loyalty scheme for Marina Bay hotel you also get a discount.

There is no where to seat and you are put into a very small area. I thought the view was breath-taking but I would save your money and hop onto the flyer instead."
,,Go for the view,5.0,,"Listen the view is to die for. You can take a ticket just for the view/observation deck but instead we thought we would buy a drink, well the drinks are $25+ so the ticket to the observation deck maybe cheaper"
,,View only,3.0,,"While the views are spectacular, that's all there really is for $23SGD. It is truly a tourist attraction at it's core. No seats or anything to do there except take pictures and leave. A small concession stand tucked under the lounge area for Ce La Vie (no access with this ticket) but that's about it."
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,This Skypark is an easy walk with beautiful views of the gardens and the city. It’s attached to the Marina Bay Sand Hotel and it’s easy to find.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Went up at dusk and it has incredible views of the city and gardens. Could also see the parts of formula 1 track before it was returned to normal. Witnessed the light show as well, not as good from the marina for the lights but much better for the fountains, looks completely different. Pre booked tickets on a secondary website and good value (about £10 per adult) worth doing if you like views."
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,This is a bit overpriced as you only get access to a very small area which has no shade or seating. They don't make it welcoming to linger here which I guess is what they want. Yes it is worth seeing but it could be made a bit more comfortable
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,Stunning views...take an umbrella as there isn’t any shaded areas and choose a clear day if possible. My cousins bought all our tickets on their hotel’s handyphone which offered a discount.
,,Great views,3.0,,"We only had access to the overhanging area of the skypark, which is not a park at all. The view was great but with no where to sit and no shade etc they clearly only want you to stay there for a very short time. Doesn't really give you the chance to do anything other than take photos and leave."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"This is the second time I visit the Sky park. And it is still amazing with the 360 degree views of Singapore. The Sky Park is on the 56th level. It features a pool, which is only for visitors to the hotel. I visited the observation platform."
,,Look & drink/eat.,4.0,,You pay $20 to go up but they count it as a credit when you purchase food or drink. Plenty of space to get to the rail to check out the view in the lounge area but a bit harder to get a seat in the bar area as it seems a lot of people sit on one drink..cheaper than the obersavation level.
,,Visiting friends,4.0,,Friends staying so got Access to viewing platform otherwise wouldn't have visited it. Good views amazing architecture.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,We went up there to watch the light show at night. Well worth queuing up to get up there. Great views of the whole of Singapore.
,,OMG,4.0,,we went here in the night and it was an astounding site one can see and experience ! the ground floor or the entrance was tooo posh and the many many exotic cars that pass by.....oooh hoooo
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Of all the things to see in Singapore, this is a must! Shopping, casino, restaurants and so much more. The views from the roof top are breathtaking"
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,Well worth going to the Skypark. The experience starts with the lifts which zoom you up the 57 stories in no time making your ears pop on the way! Once you reach the top the views of Singapore are extraordinary. From up here you can appreciate what a compact and green city this is. A friend whose been here said you can see Malaysia on a clear day but unfortunately it was hazy the day we went up. My only minor criticism is that there is no shade at the top and it was very hot the day we visited so we were relieved to get back into the air conditioning. All in all a must see in Singapore and a great place to take selfies and photos.
,,Simply beautiful !,5.0,,Only one word to describe this place.. beautiful! Wonderful view and good places to sit and enjoy the view
,,Not the same anymore,3.0,,"It would seem that a few have ruined it for us all. I had not been up to the Skydeck since 2009 and you were able to walk almost the entire length of the deck. You could enjoy a cold drink and some food under the trees and umbrellas, and take in the incredible views overlooking the infinity pool and the beautiful cityscape in front of you. Now you are only able to go on the very front portion of the deck and I found this a bit of a disappointment. Still provides great views but nothing like what it used to be. Previously I would have said that this was the first and must do thing on your trip to Singapore. Now, not so much. Try going at dusk, the view as the city lights come on as the sun fades is beautiful"
,,Great View,5.0,,"pay your $20, enjoy a drink and the views - well worth it - we had a great time - the services was good, and while it was somewhat pricey, we felt it was time and money well spent"
,,The best view in Singapore!,5.0,,"You will capture some of the most breathing photos from the observatory deck and the infinity pool. I have to say it’s the most unique hotel, pool, deck etc that I’ve been to or seen. The view is incredible both during the day and at night. From here, you will see all the local attractions and landmarks. It was truly a unique experience for me."
,,Definitely must see,5.0,,"I recently watched CRA right before going, and this was iconic and wonderful to visit after that movie.

You can pay (I think around 23$) to go up to the observation deck to look out into the Marina bay below. However, we elected to go up to one of the restaurants (where pay 20$ per person and get to use a coupon voucher to redeem food) where you get to sit down, rest, have a/c and enjoy the sights for a duration of your travels."
,,Great views,3.0,,"The 360 degree view was great, esp on a Clear day. However, to pay $22 an adult is a bit steep. The Singapore Flyer offers the same view, less is the elevator at pan pacific hotel, but that is free, so who can complain?"
,,"Expensive, but great, view",4.0,,"In town for a few days, I had time to check out the bay area. It appears the three options to visit the sky park or roof are to stay at the hotel, visit the rooftop bar, or pay to go to the Skydeck. I opted for the last option. As a single traveler, it was worth it. Paying for a family of four might be a bit much. It is a great view, however, and good way to gain perspective of Singapore. Probably only need 30 minutes or so to take it all in."
,,Lots of wow factors,5.0,,Going to this hotel was in my bucket list ever since I first saw a photo of it. Being there both day and night and enjoying the view was an awesome experience for me.
,,Definitely worth spending a day,4.0,,"Swimming in the Marina Bay Sands hotel's pool has been on my bucket list since the hotel opened. On a business trip, I paid personally to stay one night at the hotel so I could access the pool. It was a great experience, improved by the fact that the Formula One race was that night so I got a spectacular view from the Skypark viewing area. My room was well appointed (with automatic curtains) and faced the ocean and the Gardens by the Bay, so I was able to enjoy the spectacular post-race fireworks. The reasons I didn't rate higher was that food was slow in the lobby restaurant, a pina colada at the pool (with an extra shot of rum) was S$50 and very small in size, and I thought you could see straight down from the pool edge, but you can't. There is a 3 foot ledge."
,,Great place,4.0,,This is a nice place to visit. The view is beautiful and you will be thrill by the uinque aspect of the hotel.
,,Stunning views and great architecture,5.0,,Visited this fantastic building and Skypark in the day and also at night-time. Truly a spectacular building.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Visited here to take advatage of the view of the city and not disappointed. Good multi lingual descriptions of the various landmarks. Dissapointed that if you used the restaurant, you could not then return to the Skypark"
,,Once in a Lifetime,3.0,,"It is a must-see in SIngapore, because from the top of Marina Bay is possible enjoy the best view of the city.
But, considering the quality of the service, it is overpriced!
The only lift costs 20$, but you can redeem it buying a drink.
Unfortunately, all the cocktails from the drinklist cost more than 20$.
I got a Singapore Sling (obviously!): it was nothing more than passable.
In a place like this I expected to find a better drink quality.
Anyway, I have to suggest to try this experience at least once in a lifetime."
,,"Stunning views, you'll wish you'd stayed at the hotel!",4.0,,"We visited the Skypark to see Gardens By The Bay from above but you can see a lot more and there are signs to let you what you are looking at. The views are amazing.
The entrance was difficult to find, the hotel has three towers and it's not signposted from outside.
I thought the entrance price was a bit steep and the souvenir photos are very expensive, it would be nice to have a download only price option.
When you see the people in the hotel infinity pool you'll probably wished you were staying at the hotel!"
,,Good views,4.0,,excellent views of Singapore but expensive. There is a bar on the top as well if you want to hang out for a bit. Also a bit pricey though.
,,Overrated,3.0,,This place was so so busy. We saw the rooms too and they were nothing special. Not a place I would stay. Pretty overrated if you ask me.
,,Overpriced and overrated,3.0,,We went because of the hype but I feel like it was a waste of money to tick something off. The views were ok but most of the attractions look better from ground level. Although maybe night time is better as we went in the day which was also very hot. Plus the rails around which you understand my need really limit the views. The price is very steep for what little you do get to see. Would have loved to afford to stay just to check out the infinity pool which only guests can.
,,"Great view, but pricey",4.0,,"Great view, and worth going up just to say you've been on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Shame you can't get near, let alone experience, the pool but suppose that's understandable. Staff on lifts very friendly, reception staff less so."
,,Great views,5.0,,"We got a ticket to enter the bar $20 which you can use towards a drink.
Views were amazing but very busy, suggest you go before 7 if you want a seat.
Not able to get anywhere near the pool as is for hotel guests, who also have a separate viewing platform.
Lots to see from the top, can eat but we couldn’t find anywhere outside to sit so only had a drink"
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,"Stunning Views of the highlife city. Great for photos! It was busy so if you want to eat at the restaurant or bar, get there early or make a booking prior to travelling."
,,Panoramic views of Singapore,5.0,,Wow! The most amazing views from the rooftop bar. You have to buy a voucher to get to the top but that includes a free beer so worthwhile for the views! I didn't a chance to use the rooftop swimming pool but will definetly be back.
,,Absolutely stunning,5.0,,This is must see and must be atraction in Singapore. Haven't seen in my life building like this. Just pieces of art 💗
,,Go to Ce La Vie instead,3.0,,"Why would you pay $20 when Ce La Vie is one floor higher and gets you a free drink for almost the same amount?
Don't bother with the skypark, go to Ce La Vie instead, for $28 you get a free drink and ladies get free entry on many days."
,,Amazing Views!,5.0,,"We went late at night (closed st 10pm) and the city was lit up. If there is a storm they do close the deck. You only get to go on the Observation Deck, you do not get to go near the pool area. The views are amazing!!!"
,,Observation Deck at Night is a MUST!,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a must do while visiting Singapore. The views from the top (especially at night) is simply stunning! I did this a part of a tour package that also included Gardens by the bay & riverboat cruise.
,,Not worth a visit there are better places,2.0,,"To be honest, if you are looking for a bar with a view this place just is not worth it. The service is rubbish, the prices are really high and it is big, crowded and very touristy. We had a much better time at Level 33 in the Standard Charted building."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,"Excellent way to see all of Singapore! Avoid going between 11-2pm, quite hot and not a lot of shade."
,,Great view,5.0,,All once has to do is check in at Marina Bay Sands and get free access to the Skypark at the 56th Floor of the hotel.
,,Great place to see the city,5.0,,Amazing engineering. Great place to see the city on top . It is better to go in the evening and stay for the sunset
,,Great views,5.0,,Cost me 20$ as a pensioner to go up to this area. Great views of the Bay area. Been once wouldn't go again
,,Impressive Views,3.0,,"The Skypark has beautiful views across The city and can see the Gardens by the Bay from above which look very impressive, it was £25 for two adults, could be cheaper as we could only spend about 20minutes up there because the heat was unbearable after that. We got some decent photos and like I said the views are good."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,Loved the view! Drinks were amazing and the staff friendly! Although I must admit they tried to rush us out a bit!
,,Must see,5.0,,If in Singapore this is a must. The views are amazing and only 23 dollars to get up. Amazing photo's and can have a beer whilst in the viewing area. HAs to be done.
,,Great views.,4.0,,"This platform gives you a great view of the Marina Bay and out towards the shipping lanes. If you can’t stay at the hotel, this is the next best place to get a birds eye look at Singapore."
,,Didn’t waste our money,2.0,,We took a walk down to the sky park to purchase tickets so we could return later that evening to get a night time view. We walked away without any tickets and didn’t return. The lady on the reception kiosk was very abrupt and didn’t encourage the purchase but discouraged. She advised that buying the ticket in advance was a waste of time in case the weather changes. I understand her point but given the weather forecast was unlikely to change that evening within a matter of three hours I’m unsure why she wouldn’t encourage our purchase. She also went onto explain that unless your a resident you can’t access the bar of pool. Only walk up to the front of the sky park. Not worth the expense when you can view the sites from the
,,Great Views but it can get crowded,4.0,,"Well worth the effort to get to the top of the building - the views across the island and out to sea are spectacular.

Staff are super helpful and accomodating.

Only went for the views and a beer in the evening - price for the beers are on the high side but equivalent to anywhere in the world for this type of facility"
,,Excellent view of the night sky,5.0,,"We visited the skypark on a Friday night to watch the 2nd F1 practice. It was an amazing view.

The view across he night sky is amazing, we also got to see the fountain show too.

We pre-booked the tickets so we didnt have to queue."
,,singapore sling in the sky!,5.0,,"Had to pay $20 each to access the bar on the 57th floor, once there we had the drink and got the entrance fee knocked off the cost. Fantastic views all round, really busy and very hot but well worth a trip here."
,,Incredible hotel,4.0,,"It is one of the most awesome hotel of Singapore . If you are not able to spend a lot on the stay here , don't forget to explore the roof top from where you can view the entire city"
,,Busy and crowded!,4.0,,"Nice place to see from a distance, inside it’s like a cruise, full of people, great views but a little too crowded for us."
,,Crowded and overpriced,3.0,,"A popular and convenient lookout point, but expensive entry and only very small area available for viewing. You will have to push through the crowds to see out, and will not get a 360 view. I prefer other vantage points in the city."
,,Spectacular views from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"We were staying at this hotel and we were able to access the pool area, unbelievable experience. Worth all the expense. The skypark is accessible to the public, with a $20 fee. There is a great bar area and comfortable seating. You are on the part of the roof that hangs over the edge. An amazing engineering marvel.

,,"Not my ""Thing""",1.0,,"We visited the Skypark when MBS first opened. I find the hotel gross enough just passing it through from Gardens on the Bay but to me, the Skypark is everything the one star reviews say ""tacky"", ""Over Priced"", ""Not Worth the Hype"". That of course is my opinion (which is all a review can be) and clearly others marvel at it - we are all different. It is years since we have been and I shan't be going again. For a different view it is worth trying Pinnacle@Duxton which overlooks the southern coast and has a nominal charge.
I suppose MBS is so ostentatious, so absurd, so ridiculous - maybe that is part of its attraction and I can't argue with that!"
,,OMG,5.0,,"Just a stunning hotel one of the worlds best surely? Amazing views from the top, we were here for the Singapore grand Prix and on our last day we made this a mission and tbh there was hardly anyone up there! Drink a bit pricey tbh but they sort of have a captured audience as its pretty damn hot up there 90 degrees with 75% humidity.
Great idea having wire fenced areas so you can take proper photographs as well."
,,must see,5.0,,"You have to see it and take a lift up to the top to down on the city, this is a mail atraction of the city I think"
,,Just do it!,5.0,,"If you only had one day in Singapore, this would be a must!
Go and enjoy a drink from the roof! Words can’t describe it so just do it! Even better at night with the lights. We had pre dinner drinks there then caught an Uber/taxi to a beautiful restaurant."
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,As usual with a six star hotel everything is charged but the $S 23 charge to go to the 57th floor observation deck is well worth it as the 320 degree view is stunning. On a clear day Malaysia and Indonesia are visible as well as the amazing Singapore skyline. Also there is an ice-cream soft drinks vendor with reasonable prices there. The other 40 degrees of total viw are taken up by the guests area (infinity pool and sundecks etc on the boat shaped top bit of the three tower hotel)
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"It’s a beautiful place to visit. Deck is very spacious and it’s a outdoor deck. You get to see many Singapore lands marks from this place. Gardens by the bay , Singapore flyer , Marina f1 circuit are few of those. Unfortunately you are not allowed on the the pool area of Marina bay sands hotel. Admission is strictly for the deck only."
,,Sky High lunch,5.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands Hotel whilst visiting Singapore for the Grand Prix. We went up to floor 57. At no time did we pay an entrance fee!!! I don't know why, did not know this was the norm until reading other reviews. We had Wine and shared a Beefburger, which came with garnish and french fries. I can honestly say this was the best burger we had ever had. Not cheap but worth every penny. Brilliant service, and yes the views all around are amazing. Residents have an infinity pool right up to the sides of the wall. I would loved to have been able to go in. If you are in Singapore this place is a must."
,,Nice location,4.0,,"Being from Vegas, I must visit some foreign casinos. However I didn't visit this one because you must pay to get into the casino area...hmmm. So never went to the top but did walk around and being adjacent to the subway made that walk ok. Located near to the Singapore gardens."
,,Love It!,4.0,,"We went to tour the Marina Bay Sands. Absolutely lovely! It's a hotel with a top floor swimming pool. There are 3 pillars of hotel all joined by what looks like a boat at the top. Each hotel room balcony is littered with lovely flowers. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Singapore to check out Marina Bay Sands. If you love flowers and a bit of nature, you'll love this place. The place is easily accessible by the metro although it depends on where you're coming from."
,,interesting place a must in singapore,4.0,,"great view from the ground and up top, visited via the lift cant remember what floor , $28 with one drink only way to go up. god place to get a great view of singapore and have a drink pity they did not allow to go to the deck saying its only for hotel guests ?"

,,Must do in Singapore,4.0,,"The views are spectacular and if you get there early as we did (I think 10am opening) then there is no line, as opposed to later in the day when tourist bus groups turn up. There is a cafe up on the deck and bathrooms. Probably very nice at sunset too."
,,Skypark,5.0,,"It is what is expected, brilliant and truly worth several photo's to remember. A must do for a any traveller"
,,Tall and very weird architecture,4.0,,This looks great at night when the search lights go on. Strange building and not sure if I like the visual spectacle at all. Like everything here it is big and efficient looking. Enjoy at night.
,,Excellent View,5.0,,Fantastic view of the City of Singapore. Recommended if you're not checked in at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
,,Bucket List Item,5.0,,I really wanted to swim in the infinity pool atop the hotel but didn't want to pay the price for a dip in the pool. But next best thing and I was very pleased. Observation deck was amazing. I had to touch this building in some way. Iconic architectural marvel. I fear heights and amazingly I had no trouble ambling about on this lofty perch. I felt sturdy and secure. And a fantastic view.
,,The Skypark,3.0,,"I actually have mixed review for this place. Its good in one sense that you get the good city view from the top and also you get to see the light show @ Gardens by the bay from the top if you visit this place in evening. The drawback is you dont have much to do and you might have visited similar place in the past. The restaurant at the top is a one way entry so once you enter, you cannot go back to the deck again."
,,Oh wow-loved it,5.0,,"Going here was something we had wanted to do for some time and it didn’t disappoint. The view was amazing. We were not aware that it is only open one end to the public, the rest is for guests only which is fair enough. There was plenty to see, great written explanations as to what we were looking at, we are taking home great photos and memories. We got a seniors discount."
,,Just a vist,3.0,,We actually went to see what's up with the building and a huge boat thingie but unless u are staying in the hotel u can't see much except the beginning of the boat u can see the view but thats about it.
,,Observation deck visit for mere mortal for jaw dropping views of Singapore!,4.0,,"Sorry can’t afford to stay here but what a great way for non residents to experience the awesome views and sample the opulence and grandeur of this hotel complex.

I arrived on the downtown subway line at Harbour Front. Followed signs via the shopping area to Tower 3 and Sky Park. Went out of the hotel where all the flashy cars and people arrive opposite the wall water feature. Turned left and went in the glass building downstairs to the ticket area. You are warned or shown you are only visiting the observation platform and there is no access to the hotel and pool area, which is hardly surprising. I like the fact the staff are clear and informative about what you are paying for. Fair price for what you see at $23 for an adult.

You get offered the customary photo before getting in the lift to the 56 floor. Once up the massive deck allows for views of all the key areas. Glass barriers with open parts and safety wire to get better clear photos surround the deck. The small bar sells soft and alcoholic drinks. I loved my Singapore Sling slush puppy type drink. Not cheap at $15 but when in Rome as they say. Also I spotted snacks like hotdogs cooking. There were a few bar stools but people are always there waiting on their order so not a normal bar to sit at. There is a small souvenir counter too. I got my fridge magnet downstairs on the way back, which was a better shop. :)

The restaurant bar above I think I was told can be entered from here, as well as from downstairs for diners - assuming there is room, but you cannot come back onto the observation deck after. I wasn’t bothered just spent a few hours just before sunset and when the city lit up. Took ridiculous amount of pictures. Worth using a small pocket size tripod for perfect night shots. Busy place of course - I did find it annoying after a while how people sat in groups on the floor near the glass making it hard to get pictures. You should spend a while and move about so everyone can soak up a view and take a few pictures from different aspects. The best one for me was the Singapore flyer and business district views. I came back another day to sample some of the shops and bars here plus the gardens on the ground level. What a place. When I win the lottery I’m coming back here to stay! :)"
,,Ariel views,5.0,,"Gives excellent views of Singapore from the top. You can see the Gardens by the bay and the Merlion from the top and also the city views are great.
Visit the place in the evening around 6pm so you can get the daytime as well as the night time views of Singapore."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"You can see so much from this fantastic vantage point. Night time is the best time, and if you aren't a hotel guest, you can look longingly at the pool area, that you can't get to!"
,,The fireworks!,5.0,,Oh the fireworks were beautiful! Go there for the show in the evening. You can sit on one of the quays and get a perfect view while having dinner or a drink.
,,Visited whilst staying at the hotel,5.0,,"Entrance to this attraction is free if you’re already staying at the hotel.

I’ve no head for heights but knew I’d to force myself to the Skypark or I’d regret it. The panorama is magnificent, and odd in equal measure. You’re 56/57 floors up looking down onto Singapore, whilst also more or less still being at the same height as some of the other buildings. I wasn’t comfortable going right up to the hand rail edge but still managed to enjoy the views.

Understandably it can get a bit manic as people arrive and jostle for a place as the light and laser show is about to begin. However, security staff seem to have the situation under control, organising the lifts to and fro, to keep things smooth."
,,Awesome,4.0,,The best experience ever! You get the best view from every angle. Do not go in the hot day though but prepare some sunscreen if you must
,,Beatiful elegant unusual building . A landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"Visible from all the parts of the town , it represents a true landmark with its unusual and eye-catching architecture. From certain points it looks like a big modern submarine on top of a skyscraper. The whole area surrounding it in the Marina bay is pleasant and full of attractions . It is well served by the orange metro line"
,,Stunning,5.0,,Unlimited time is what you are given when you purchase your ticket. Sunset is the best time and while you wait you can enjoy a drink at the bar. You can see both the Supertree light show and the marina bay light and water display but both are better experienced on ground level!
,,Worth a visit!!,5.0,,"It is a bit pricy just for an observation deck, but definately worth a visit.. the view from there is GREAT! If you have to choose between this and the Singapore Flyer, chose this!"
,,Fantastic views of the bay,5.0,,Super views day and night. Breathtaking panoramic view from floor57. Free to Hotel residents. Floor 56/7 Tower 3 if not resident. MRT Bayfront.
,,My mom was in awe of the view,4.0,,"Go on weekdays which we did because it gives you more room to appreciate the view, no need to be jostling for a space to look at the panoramic vista. Weekdays mean that the queue is short which would give you more time to spend absorbing the beauty of Singapore. My mother was never been so impressed with how beautiful the lights are in Singapore during night time. Late entry is also an advantage since the lights are in full blast plus the streets are a bit empty.

Staff are quick and friendly.

Souvenirs are also available if you want to buy."
,,Sky park view,5.0,,"We went to find the sky park but it wasn’t well signposted, go to the end of tower 3, then go downstairs to find the ticket office. Price was 23 spd each. You then go round to a green screen to have the photo taken. Enter the lift & up you go. Your photo is waiting as soon as you exit the lift, quite pricey at 80 spd. Out the door & onto the roof, absolutely stunning views even if it’s a cloudy day. Remember sunscreen as it maybe overcast but you still can get burnt. We spent a good hour wandering round taking pictures, there is a stand to buy a cold drink/ice cream but nowhere to sit, unless you use the restaurant, clever ploy on there behalf. Definitely a must for me."
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,Such amazing views. Breathtaking. On a clear day you can see for miles. Much better views than the Singapore Flyer.
,,Amazing view of city and Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,"I recommend visiting in the evening time and advantages are, you can view Sunset, Gardens by the bay with lights, Water fountain all in one shot. Only difficulty was to get on top due to the lack of directions marked."
,,Amazing View of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"After a day long sight seeing in Singapore we have decided to visit sky bar for drinks and dinner during the evening,

The view from the top with a drink is just out of this world that i am falling short of words to describe,

This place is must for the travellers who love skyline view while dinner is a must during Singapore visit,

,,Tacky,1.0,,"First Visited Skypark 7 years ago, it was in much better shape. Paid $20 to go up to sky deck, which entitles you to one drink. Don’t order anything else, it’s a rip off.Food is awful. The whole area is tacky, old stained furniture, flooring needs repairs, rude staff. Actually the whole place looks like it’s struggling to make ends meet. I would never pay to stay here"
,,what an outstanding architectural building!!,5.0,,"we could not afford to stay at this beautiful hotel but did pay to enter the skypark and did not regret doing so. it has stunning views of the business district, the many many attractions around the bay, the garden of the bay, the flyer and countless landmarks. worth the visit"
,,Great view worth the price one time,4.0,,"To access the Ce Le Vie bar, you have to pay S$20 (~US$15) for access but can use the ticket against a drink order. The drinks are highly overpriced, but it's worth it for the view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Enter the ""Shoppes"" building and go the end by tower 3. There is a ticket counter and then proceed to the elevator to the 57th floor. You can get there from either the Bayfront or Marina Bay MRT stops, depending on which line you take. This is also right next to Gardens By The Bay which is a must-see and most of it is free."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Its quite pricey for what you get, you pay $23 per adult to go to the top of the Sands. They take a photo of you before you go up and try and sell you the photo album after you finished. View is amazing but its all thats really up there. We spent only about 15minutes up there as it was hot and no shelter/shade. You aren't allowed to access the pool only if you are a guest of the sands. The restaurant needs to be accessed by another lift so you can't even sit down for a glass of wine up there."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,Excellent view of Singapore from the Skypark. Went early to avoid the crowd and so had no problems getting up the lift and back. Staff were courteous and efficient but make sure you are mindful of the weather.
,,Great views but overcrowded,4.0,,Overcrowded in the evening time. Drinks service very slow. Long queues to get in. Nice cocktails. Great view
,,A must do visit - if heights aren’t a problem,4.0,,"The skypark atop the Marina Bay Sands hotel is open to the public, on the payment of an admission fee.

This is truly one of the must do visits for everyone visiting Singapore. The deck on top of the hotel spans the full 3 towers of the iconic hotel and extends, canterlever style, well over the edges.

It is only the western end that is available to the public, with a restaurant, bar and public observation deck. But the views are no less stunning, despite the fact that you can’t access the whole deck.

The city and harbour views are nothing short of breathtaking and you can stay up there as long as you like. Sunset/dusk is a good time to visit, but very busy. You get the daytime views and then watch the city lights all come alive.

Worth the visit and the cost, in my opinion."
,,Do it once.,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is certainly a landmark and for that reason it is worth a visit should you be in Singapore for 2-3 days. You are able to acccess the top floor where the bar is located for those not staying at the hotel. The irony however is that you are kept in this enclosed area while overlooking the pool area where hotel residents are splashing around. Seems a bit like visiting the zoo with guests rather than animals in their enclosures but there you go. Be warned, the drinks are expensive so enjoy the scenery and sip slowly to get the value."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,We went up while there was a thunder and lightening storm but the views were still great. The thing i didnt like was the staff trying to sell me my photo and they were expensive. Worth a trip bit. $23 per adult
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing views of Singapore. Tip-don’t go up in middle of the day as it’s extr hot! Loved it & highly recommend doing this.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Best choice to enjoy the skyline view of Singapore. Went for the skybar 58 floors up - the entrance fee can be redeemed for drinks. Great place to finish off a long day after work at a conference downstairs.
,,We decided to thank the elevator up the 58 floors to see the view at the restaurant or you can swim in the infinite pool,4.0,,".. worth the trip to the 58th floor for a drink, and or feed, so that you can enjoy the view .. and you can swim in the infinity pool if you are staying at the hotel"
,,Great View!,5.0,,Attended a party here in the evening. Amazing views of the city from all around (can feel bit dizzy though).
,,Highlight of the skyline,5.0,,Absolutely gorgeous building. Go up to the top to feel like a big baller. This building will definitely be in the highlights of your pictures from Singapore.
,,the must do thing in singapore!,5.0,,"the skypark is an impressive building,filling the skyline near the bay.the building itself is like a giant tanker sitting on a hotel.we payed 23 dollars each to go up and this includes a drink at the top.you go up in an escalator and once you get up there,then wow,what a view!!you can see the whole of singapore one side and all the ships in the bay the other.at the top there is a couple of nice bars,one is a sort of disco one.there is a restaurant and also an infinity swimming pool,which you can use for a fee.there is also a great view over the bay gardens.i thought great value for money."
,,A must do,4.0,,"Iconic hotel and until you see it in the flesh you don't really appreciate how good a piece of architecture it is.
Well worth a trip to the top for an evening cocktail to take in the skyline and bright lights of the city. The infinity pool is something else."
,,A must see,4.0,,"The only downside here is the queue to get up and the queue to get down. But once your up there the views are magical of the city & skyline at night. A must do peeps, even if like me, you need your back to the wall laffs."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This hotel is amazing and the view of Singapore at night from the Skypark is amazing this is something you must do while in Singapore.
,,Can not be explained.,5.0,,"Marvelous place if spent with friends on this place, you can enjoy whole night here with photography, food & beverages available there."
,,WORTH A VISIT,4.0,,"We paid $20 each to go to the seated restaurant area where our entrance fee was offset against the cost of drinks/food and we had a wonderful view of paragliders and helicopter and jet flypasses. The viewing platform entrance fee is a little dearer and has no seating and no allowance against purchases. A beet, G & T and dish of spiced wedges cost $65 ($25 when taking off our entrance fee). We visited before going to The Gardens in the Bay."
,,Wow wow wow,5.0,,"This place makes for one of the most amazing views in the world.

It is such an amazing experience. This is quite well known seeing as so many your groups visit each day.

We had the pleasure of staying here so we got to enjoy it quite a lot."
,,Waste of money,2.0,,"Don’t waste $23 per person to go up in a lift, be spoken to like you are a nuisance by the kiosk girl on the deck and asked $80 for your digital photo in a frame or $40 just for a digital photo! RIP off central"
,,Great place!!,5.0,,"At the lobby before we take the escalators up, taking a picture with Harshni&Nas~ they are very kind staff! Thanx a lot! The Sands SkyPark is the number one scenic / observation attraction in Singapore! Priced at just $20 for adults, it gives you access to two levels of ""observation area"" at the highest floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for 4 hours which is more than in enough time. But The exclusive pool area only for hotel guests

낮과 밤 모두 좋은 뷰를 지니고 있지만, 클럽이 있는 관계로 밤에 사람이 몰리는 것 같아요! 저는 그래도 야경을 추천합니다~또 가고 싶네요^^"
,,Visit the Skypark (skip staying at the Hotel),5.0,,"For the cost of the rooms at the MBS, there are much better 5star hotels in the Singapore area that cater to the elite client. That being said - you still need to visit the Skypark. Cost about USD$23 bucks, and it is worth it. The view from the roof area is incredible. Go around 715pm, so that you catch day views as well as sunset and night views - and the fountain show at 8pm."
,,Just a squiz,5.0,,"Amazing view and photo opportunity of Singapore city lights and skyline,mind blowing from the minute you step out of the lift and walk down to bar area.Definately recommend paying the $28 dollars and you get a complimentary drink at bar worth about $15-$20 dependant on what you drink.My partner had the best cocktail ever.We we’re talking about it all the way home.and are going back at Christmas time.Cheers and enjoy!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"This is the most unbelievably amazing piece of architecture that I
have ever seen. 3 tall buildings curved at specific angles which support at the top a boat shaped building. You have to see it to believe it. Take a ride right up to the top of the building to experience the full dynamics, see the rooftop pool and be amazed at the apartments etc. which are lived in by extremely lucky people who really living on top of the world. Venture even further and stay a night in the rooftop boat accommodation on offer. It certainly has the wow factor."
,,Fantastic - a must do!,5.0,,The view from here is absolutely awesome. $20 well spent (which you get back in a drinks voucher anyway!). This is a must do experience in Singapore.
,,These Views are The Best,4.0,,"The views from the top are simply magnificent and are the best in the business. Only negative issue is that the public area around the bar at the top is quite small and simply inadequate. Most of the roof area is reserved for hotel guests which is understandable, but it was frustrating to see many empty tables that could not be used by the public, who have paid to come up to the facility and looking to pay for drinks at the bar.
Just a tip, there is an additional viewing area the public can use that looks over the gardens, if you go past on the left side of the exit lifts."
,,Unrivalled Views,5.0,,"The view from the top is jaw dropping, especially at night. If you’re not good with heights this is going to be a challenge for you because this is so high you can’t even imagine. But go for it, to our won’t regret it."
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"MBS skypark is must thing to do in Singapore. 360 degree view of Singapore skyline view. Coffee , drinks available on the top floor , best time I think is after 5 pm and later around 8 pm laser show starts near by so one can enjoy both from the top deck. Highly recommended.
Love Singapore"
,,What a View - Amazing Architecture,5.0,,"We paid the $20 each to go up
to the top - so worth it!
You get a drink with the voucher
you get. You will pay around $7
in tax.
We had a great waiter and stayed up there for a while.
It was a great afternoon."
,,Incredible!,5.0,,"Absolutely breathe taking views, a real experience and chance to see Singapore from a different view. The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is such an incredible design and a very beautiful one! Highly recommend choosing the restaurant / bar option as apposed to just the viewing deck."
,,Afternoon tea,5.0,,I have now been to the top of this incredible building 5 times now and every time a different reason. Afternoon tea is a must but make sure you book. The infinity pool is only available for guests staying however the bar and view is a must to do when in singapore. Take your camera for some great pictures and a selfie or two.
,,Superb view at city,5.0,,A must do at night to appreciate the city skylights and the beauty of the bay.Lift up to fifty sixth floor was quick and lots of people taking in the view.
,,"great view, but a lot of people.",3.0,,"Was a huge line up to go and have a look. Took 5 min to have a look at the view, and 1.5 hours lining up using the lift."
,,Wow! What a view,4.0,,This was an amazing experience to see Singapore at night from aerial view. The queue was big as it was Friday evening. As it was part of the tour we only got to spend 20 minutes at the rooftop. Amazing experience.
,,Amazing experience on the top of tower,5.0,,"the entire singapore night tour included visit to the marina bay sands skypark which in itself
was a unique experience overseeing singapore skyline. Complete view of all important city icons was visible from the top of the tower (higher than eiffel tower) and the elevator taking only few seconds to reach on the top.. Stunning view / enticing eat out area / casino / shopping arcade all in one."
,,"This was nice, not my favorite skytower, but nice",4.0,,"I enjoyed this, and am happy I did it. My friend and I went up there during a rehearsal of the Singapore National Day celebration, so it was really cool seeing the jets and helicopters flying over. It was crowded, but still..."
,,The best view of Singapore,4.0,,"I had to see the view from the top and I wasn't disappointed. I was however saddened to learn that only guests staying there could use the infinity pool. Surely for an additional fee visitors could use it too? Anyway, the view was breathtaking and the staff were very nice but the drinks were a little on the pricey side"
,,Excellent view,4.0,,This is expensive but we were happy to spend the money. There is no seating up there so we were tired from walking around all day before we got there so we sat on the ground. There is a cafe up on top but very expensive. We spend about an hour here.
,,The night that never sleep.,5.0,,"The night scenes are breathtaking, indeed. It is better than the Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur because Singapore Marina Bay Sand does not limit the time you stay up in the Observatory Deck. You can stay as long as you want to admire the city, or to take perfect all of the pictures you wanna take. Basic beverages are available there too in case you are dehydrated.

Honestly, we have been to all the skyline or obseravtory deck everywhere on the west coast of the U.S., but none can beat this view in Singapore. Just saying...! You must fulfill your trip by visiting this, or you are as good as not been here at all.
Good luck, and enjoy!"
,,Nothing extraordinary,4.0,,"Similar to Burj Khalifa, Nothing special. Also the family pic which they take is for 80 SGD where by it's around 35 SGD in other attractions."
,,Veiw,5.0,,"Amazing view , was there for light show too ... Beautiful music n lighting ... Waited for 30 mins but was worth ."
,,The most expensive hotel in Singapore with the best view of downtown Singapore.,5.0,,Worth the value for money.The most expensive hotel in Singapore with the best view of downtown Singapore
,,Great Food court,5.0,,"Ive been to the roof top bar, the views are amazing. But my favourite place here is still the food court, which has the tastiest food and amazing variety."
,,Birds eye view of SG,4.0,,"This was a great experience for us. Seeing SG on top of Marina Bay Sands was just amazing. You can literally see all the attractions of SG from there. The merlion, gardens by the bay, cloud forest and flower dome, and of course the flyer. Will surely go back there and experience it again on night time. I feel it will be more amazing."
,,Stress free,5.0,,Very nice place when you need relaxation and stress free environment! Highly recommended to go to. Surely one of the places here in singapore
,,Worth the Visit!,5.0,,"We stayed for 4 days at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel; therefore, we didn't have to pay to visit the skypark. There was quite a large crowd, and I image that's the case all day long every day. We were there once only, to see the sunset over the bay (just beautiful!), and then went to the other side of the skypark to see the supertrees lights show at 7:45 p.m. We didn't stay for long since you really couldn't hear the music that accompanied the lights show. You had to use your imagination and look at the light show from far away and high above. But overall, it was worth the visit to see the different parts of the city from high above."
,,Architecturally amazing Structure,5.0,,"Take the time to visit this - well worth it. Swift lift - 55 stories - to the top from where you can see Singapore laid out like a map. Great bars, delicious food and the edgeless pool is both inviting and deceiving. Take the right shot and you could fool anyone into thinking that people in the pool were against a 'green screen' of the city, truly amazing.
Quite windy at the top too in contrast to ground level, which makes a refreshing change from the heat. We loved it!"
,,One of the must see attractions in Singapore.,5.0,,One of the must see attractions in Singapore. Visited the place with family in the evening. Magnificent view from the top. All near by attractions in Singapore is visible from there. Light show is a wonderful life time experience.we spent almost two hours ideally enjoying the breeze.
,,Fantastic views!,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is easy to get to.
The views are spectacular but, the glass needed to be cleaned.
Descriptions of views in several languages.
Nice restaurant available as well as an ice cream stand.
It can be very windy - beware if you're using an umbrella."
,,Great views,5.0,,The views were fantastic as you have a panoramic view of Singapore. Service in the bar was slow but definitely worth a visit
,,A must when in Singapore,5.0,,Just make sure you wear the right clothing. Just magic when you watch the sunset. Need about two hours.
,,Great time with amazing views.,5.0,,"So beautiful and full of caffees and restaurantes. Nice for pictures, museum, shopping. Must go to spend some time over there or just grab a book and stay in the pier to see the sunsetting."
,,IT’S GOOD BUT NOT GREAT!,3.0,,"Ok if you have young children I’d do this, go before 6pm as there was a bit of a queue and by the time we got to the top it was dark. Good views of Gardens by the Bay and the Marina. It was very crowded when we went, lots of people sat on the floor making getting your photos a bit tricky. Would suggest going after the Supertree Grove lightshow has finished as lots of people looked like they were only going up to see that. If you have teenagers 18+ I would do Bar Altitude it’s better and for not much more you get two cocktails if you do 6-9pm slot."
,,View toproof invovded FREE worth of $20!,5.0,,"nice place, waitress good friendly and help me guide around. I watch view there 360* too. beautiful whenever night time and lots lights, water fountains, and firework closed too. its beautiful"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"Highly recommend heading up to the Skypark on the 57th floor at Marina Bay Sands. The view is amazing, and its a great spot to have a drink. It costs $20 to get up there, but that comes with a free drink coupon to the value of $20, so if you're having a drink, entry is essentially free."
,,amazing place to stay,5.0,,"not cheap but a worth while experience. The pool 900 feet up on the roof is just amazing looking down on the city and the Singapore race track.
There is a huge shopping mall in the lower area with a superb food court at the far end....very cheap and good all Asian types of food."
,,Great views...,5.0,,"Great views of the bay from 57 floors up, particularly at night. You can see the water show from above if you get the right seats! Drinks and food are a bit pricey, but well worth the experience nevertheless!"
,,Holiday,5.0,,We did walk through Marina Sands to get to Gardens by the Bay. Another time we went to the Skypark but only for a brief time. Wonderful views of the city.
,,Wonderfull view,5.0,,"The price you have to pay for ticket is 39 Singapore Dollars. It is posible to queu, but also to book online or point. There are several places in Singapore. It is accesible for wheelchairs. Kids are also welcome to have a view from this outlook."
,,Wonderful experience!!,5.0,,Visited the sky park with friends and family- what a wonderful experience to remember!! What made it even better was the Annual Day evening practice and the air show and fireworks from the sky park !! Worth the money spent and would encourage going there in the evening to enjoy the evening view and beautifully lit city !! Thanks
,,Average,3.0,,"The view is nice. The queue to get into the elevator is not. I would recommend reserving a table at the restaurant or going for the bar/club instead of buying a ticket for the observation deck.

Tip: When leaving, walk through the bar section of C’est la vie and to the elevators used by restaurant guests. I beat a massive queue doing that. They don’t let you back on the deck after coming through there though so make sure you’re done looking."
,,Top of the world view esp if you like sea/water view and the bird's eye view of the gardens by the bay or Marina barrage,3.0,,"For tourists, you may not want to travel all the way just for the observation, plan it well with a tour to the Gardens by the bay or a spa at Banyan tree etc

Costly ticket!

Beware! it can be very hot depending on the weather as it is alfresco"
,,Beautiful View but lil costly entry ticket,5.0,,Nice Hotel to stay in Singapore with Infinity Pool. Hotel also have top floor..Sky park(observation Desk) which is paid for outliside hotelier. But nice view from top but entry ticket is also costlier.
,,"Lovely building, no need to go to the roof top",4.0,,"The building itself is interesting and worth a view. However, it's not necessary to go up to the roof top. Just behind the Marina Bay, you'll find the Garden Bay."
,,"Stunning view, but make sure that you think about your options for visiting",5.0,,"There is no doubt that the design of the three towers with the ""boat garden"" on top, together with its infinity pool, is one of the most striking in the world. It is stunning to see from ground level, and the view from the top is equally stunning. I loved every minute of my visit to the top, where we had a meal in CeLaVi restaurant. Everything was fabulous but I have to say that I did not find the guide books particularly helpful in deciding what ""package"" to take to visit the rooftop, so this is an attempt to be a practical guide to help you make up your mind. The first thing to remember is that large sections of the roof gardens, including the infinity pool, are CLOSED to day visitors and are only available to hotel guests. The second point is that if you visit the restaurant, the viewing deck one floor below is NOT available to restaurant guests unless you have paid a separate fee of S$23 per person (the price as at August 2018). The third point is that guide books tend to point out that if you eat at the top, then you save the S$23 per person. That is true, but you do not get quite the same view, because the public deck one floor below the restaurant sticks out further than the restaurant deck and you are right at the edge of the viewing platform, something that you cannot achieve from the restaurant deck. Furthermore, the fixed price lunch menu is S$45-55, plus 10% service plus 7% tax, and this is without drinks, so on a net basis you can easily end up spending quite a lot on lunch. So here is my advice. If you want to have the eating experience, fine. The food is very good and the atmosphere is great. If you want the view, but think that for a little extra over and above the fee of S$23 you can get a nice meal, you are mistaken. The additional costs is likely to end up much more than you think. So make sure that you know what you want!"
,,One of the most astonishing buildings I have seen! Enjoy Spago on top roof,5.0,,"Very well situated and impressive. The hotel guests may use the swimming pool on the top room - the ""ship"". The view from up there (57th floor) is gorgeous on the bay with the big ships and on the Gardens by the bay. Trendy bar on top roof one shouldn't miss: Spago"
,,Top view,5.0,,Unique place to have a city view... Have your drink at the 57th floor next to the infinity pool with the city below... Food was also good (a bit expensive - but worth it)
,,Tour,5.0,,Great view! Its stunning and also the people assisting is kind its a really nice and wonderful hotel be sure to go here its a fun place
,,Incredible views,5.0,,"It looks like a giant surfboard sitting on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The view of Singapore from this skydeck is worth the visit alone. We were fortunate enough to be staying in the hotel, si had access to the infinity pool and skydeck on numerous occasions. Looking down over the edge of the pool is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. That pool must hold the record for the largest number of mobile phones in one swimming pool at one time!"
,,Looking at Singapore from the Sky,3.0,,"Sort of my trip in Singapore was visiting this place.
I went there with my friends on the weekend. There was life music on the rooftop and we can saw the whole city from the top.

What I love the most is the atmosphere between its silence and people crowds.

I love to staring at the horizon far from the distance, then took some picts from up there.
That was incredible."
,,Wonderful view,5.0,,"We booked a room at Marina Bay Sands hotel and therefore had free access to the Skypark. After swimming at the pool, we dropped by the Skypark just to see. We took some pictures and that was it. We did not stay long there. I was still wearing my robe on top of my swimsuit when we went there."
,,fantastic views of singapore,5.0,,we went here at night up to the 57th floor where there is viewing section it was free but didn’t realise we shouls have brought tickets to the skybar on the 56th floor for $21.00 this floor has city views everywhere
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,"I read the Skypark reviews before deciding to buy the tickets and I thought it will be worth if I reach by the time of Fountain show but boy I was wrong. It is a good site but really not worth the money you spend.

The musical fountain show is not even much visible. I would suggest to go to Clark Quay instead take a cruise and see the beautiful sights. It drops you the exact place where the fountain show takes place and view the same from there."
,,A great view but overpriced,3.0,,I would recommend a trip to the top for the view but beyond that it is very expensive $20 for a beer. I'd recommend drinking very slowly and taking a walk around to enjoy Singapore from different angles. On a clear night the view really is spectacular
,,Could be Impressive,3.0,,So you have to pay S$23 Adult ticket to come up to the Skypark if you are not a hotel guest... I can understand that as the hotel is there to make a profit... however once you get up there you are not allowed to go visit the infinity pool nor bars or restaurant. The views across the Bay are spectacular but on a hot day a bit hazy.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Absolutely stunning and amazing views. Tickets give you either the option of viewing on the outside of the bar area or in the bar area. Beautiful views of Gardens by the Bay.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"The hotel and view from the top is exceptional. It costs about $20 USD, which is worth it. However, you are not allowed to go to the whole skypark unless you are staying at the hotel. If you aren't, they only allow you to be on the small deck viewing area."
,,Wonderful View but limited corner,5.0,,"It's a pity that non-resident ppl are allowed only a tiny bit of view for such an expensive ticket (but hey, we're in Singapore so everything is expensive). The bar at the top was sleazy... Something must be improven."
,,Magnificent views,5.0,,Great views of Singapore from above. You pay SGD20 for entrance; however redeemable for drinks-food. Pricy food and drinks.
,,Skyline at sunset,4.0,,A great place to view Singapore's skyline at any time day or night but always find towards sunset its the best. It can become very hot up there with the wooden floor reflecting heat so advisable to keep hydrated. View of Gardens by the BAy equally attractive as is the view of Singapore Flyer. If you're into planes then take a visit leading up to National Day when you get a close up view of the action 360 degrees. Warning though can get crowded at those times of the year.
,,Nice but worth the entrance fee?,3.0,,"Have had some time to not only work in Singapore but to have a short enjoyable time. Went to the Marina bay being the most hip place at the moment.
I went to the buildng and first found the lift going to the restaurant on top. There was a minimum consumption you have to take, or call it lift fee. They told me that they are in the middle section and that the scenic spot would be the end of the platform with a different entrance. So I went there. I remember the ticket was expensive, a lot more than expected. Going up was easy, there was no queue, of course they want to take photos of you first. Lift up is fast. The visitor platform is really only the end part of the platform, most of it cannot be accessed. The view is great if you like water. So many ships out there and can also see the lading planes into the airport. The other side of the platform is the city view, can see the tall buildings. You can also get a coffee up there. Anyhow, if you walk around the platform you have quickly seen all sides, I wondered if the coffee offer I found first would have been the better choice. At my time it was not too busy, hence could spend some nice time up there, however, I felt the price was too high for being up there."
,,One of the best view of Singapore,5.0,,This is one of the best views of Singapore. A small ticket to be payed but it’s worthwhile. Maybe other skyscrapers are higher but none of them is so close to Marina Bay. Impressive specially in nights
,,Classy!,5.0,,"One of the finest luxurious resorts, a collection of top notch brands and chain of restaurants. A massive casino. Marina bay Sands is a sure shot recommendation for everybody to visit in Singapore. It is just pure class. The fireworks in the evening are absolutely delightful to watch and is a spectacular sight."
,,Great view,5.0,,If you want a birds eye view of the city in the night it’s a great place for o hangout and perhaps even a place to chill with friends in the evening
,,overpriced,1.0,,You are just paying to see from the top of a building.This is not something worth paying.Better go to zoo or orchid garden.
,,View of haze,3.0,,"If u r desperate to say u have been up the ship-like deck in MBS, SIN, then do this. We purchased the CE La Vie $20 voucher to redeem at the bar on the deck, to gain access to views. The cocktails were $22 + 10% service and + 7% gst. So quite pricey for views in the haze."
,,Slowest lifts in a modern building,3.0,,"Went here twice, first during the day to see the view. This is the only time I recommend u visit. They do the normal photo taking before u go up and try and sell u the overpriced pic at the end. I went back at night to watch the light show at gardens by the bay. Best view for this is actually at gardens by the bay. U can’t hear the music and it’s not as impressive watching from above. We had to line up for about 30hr to get up the top. The lifts are the slowest I have ever been on. They pack u in like sardines, hope u don’t like personal space. Getting back down is even worse. I think it took us over an hour to exit. There is also a light show on the otherside at 8pm but again recommend watching from ground level."
,,Nice view,4.0,,An amazing view of the city giving you the glimpse of famous attractions around the Bay Sands area. You could skip the Singapore flyer for this and book your tickets on klook
,,Make sure you really want to do this.,3.0,,"If you have nothing better to do and money to spare go have a look. It is not clear from the ground floor that you can go just for a view on a completely unshaded deck with a licensed snack bar and no seating or pay to go to Ce La Vi, the restaurant up top accessed from a completely different part of the confusing ground floor, no idea of the cost but I understood you do have to buy food and/ or drink when visiting. No way can you access the pool or back end of the “ship” unless you are a hotel guest and there seemed an awful lot of them ev3n at Marina Bay Sands prices.
The view from the Singapore Flyer is just as good and the experience easier and nicer."
,,'The Boat' Singapore,5.0,,"On a short stopover while traveling to Australia from London, I had a lovely lunch at this venue. The food was excellent (curries, salads, etc...) and, what I would consider, real value for money, the staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere was lively but not overbearing. The crowd was typically local with European expats with a business luncheon vib. I would certainly recommend travelers to attend."
,,"""wonderful""",5.0,,"Marina Bay is a beautiful architecture including the skyscraper, the gardens hanging nicely combined the development of commercial services, hotels, entertainment. In particular, the Bay of Marina is also the venue for the Festival of the new year as the world's most monumental Festival countdown, Fireworks."
,,What a view,5.0,,You can’t go to Singapore without visiting the sky park. It would have been even better if you could use the infinity pool but that’s just for guests only
,,Very unique. Huge,4.0,,A unique build hotel above the gardens by the bay and great view of Singapore. Costly to get to the top for view but if going to the bar you are eligible for drinks for the ticket price
,,Daytime visit unspectacular unless clear of Singapore haze (rare).,3.0,,"As expected the view is notable from such a height (55 floors up), but unfortunately the near constant haze limits the best views significantly. View is only about 300 degrees as you are limited to one end of the three towers and there is no access to rooftop pool enjoyed by hotel guests. Best value view would undoubtedly be at nighttime with local light shows at Gardens by the Bay (directly below) and the cityscape."
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,This is a must do !! Would not visit Singapore without experiencing this. You are up on the 57th floor and its high but completely safe
,,An Architectural Marvel,5.0,,"This a beautiful, very modern and much in demand hotel for those who can afford it. It consists of three towers with a top which looks like a gigantic canoe. However, there is a big surprise when you reach the top. Amazing!"
,,Beautiful views from the top!,4.0,,"Worth a visit to the top for a drink or meal, look out over the Harbour or to the Marina area, there is a nice restuarant on the top were we had nice food and a few drinks, it was a full moon so beautiful views and you can see the light show of the marina gardens at night."
,,Absolutely Amazing!!! Do this from early to late evening what views!!!,5.0,,"Well worth the charges to go up to the bar and restaurant, it has a brilliant atmosphere. The views are stunning and nothing to fear if you have phobias of heights it feels totally amazing. Good food and drinks not overly expensive and the service is good, but just one thing if it rains you cannot sit outside on the terraces."
,,Yes it is worth the money!,5.0,,"It is! In the covercharge of 23 SGD pr adult, you can use this as part payment when you bye something to drink in the skybar. Beautiful view, nice place to relax - good athmosphere. We entered from Tower 3. Easy to find, no queueing and perfect view over the city"
,,Over priced,3.0,,A good place with great skyline views but too less area to explore with restrictions to view the infinity pool.
,,A Must!,5.0,,You have to go to the Skypark on Marina Bay Sands. They have a laser light show each night below in the bay which is great to watch.
,,Absolutely amazing views,5.0,,"Myself an partner went to the skybar which was $20 p/p but you get a voucher for the value off your drinks an food up there which is good ,

Although it’s expensive if people are on a budget this is most certainly a must in Singapore

Food was amazing to I would recommend for sure to visit

The view looking over the whole city is possibly the nicest Iv ever seen and we were lucky enough to be there for sunset to"
,,Best view ever,5.0,,"The view from the Skypark is amazing, but the cue can be frustrating. Worth the wait, particularly if you going to have a drink and enjoy the view. If you are skittish about heights or edges, suggest you leave the experience to others. Cruze through the Casion with your Visa."
,,Coffee break,5.0,,We spent a night around that area. We then sat in a cafe and talked about life. It is a nice place to hang out with friends.
,,Amazing Modern Architecture,5.0,,"Amazing modern architecture and a place to leisure. Try to going in the late afternoon, and see the sundown."
,,Just walkin' as part of a foot-trip,4.0,,"This one's pretty and relaxing--and I'm a person who has some serious fear of heights! Seriously, how this country combines nature and architecture is stunning, and this one's no exception."
,,Spectacular views and experience,3.0,,Spectacular views and experience do come at a price both in term of ticket and food and drink price and horrendous crowds ! It is worth the try on a clear day at sun set - during the day is ways too hot to enjoy
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,If you desperate to go up to the top - pay extra for lunch / dinner in the restaurant - then it's worth it.
,,Great views but not worth the money,3.0,,$23 each to access the skypark is a bit steep. The views are fantastic but better value to buy a bar voucher for $20 to the roof top bar. Same views and the $20 can be redeemed for a drink or bar snacks.
,,Worth taking the time,5.0,,"We went there during the afternoon, so maybe not the smartest idea. It was sooooooo hot! I would recommend going in the early evening or at night to beat the heat. The view in daytime is well worth it, but I can imagine at night it's even better.
While you are there, take advantage of the terrace at Ce La Vi and have a drink to cool off and take breather. Service is a bit slow, but they made a very nice Mojito!
The view is pretty awesome all around."
,,Best view ever....but crowded!,3.0,,We stayed in the hotel so went an looked each time we went to the pool. It probably is worth going to for the view but the bar us very expensive.
,,A tad over rated,3.0,,"After being crammed into a lift with a large number of other people, we arrived at the 'Skypark' viewing platform. Not sure what made the viewing platform a 'park', there were no trees or other activities on that particular space. There is no doubting the views were spectacular and the photo-opportunity not to be missed, but I can't help feel it was overpriced. I opted to have a drink at Ce la vi restaurant, which is a step up from the viewing platform, but was informed that once I entered Ce la vi, I would not be allowed back on the viewing platform. Not sure why as there were certainly no barriers constructed which would limit re-accessing the platform. So manage your visit as you see fit, but for my money, it really was a bit of a disappointment."
,,Not worth the hype,1.0,,"I stayed there with some friends who were visiting for one night just so we could use the pool and take some pictures. I have to say it is not worth the hype at all. It is over crowded to the max, and despite 100's of seats you will be lucky to find any free. We stopped for a cocktail first in the lounge area, the cocktails look nothing like their pictures, and the place was just out dated with worn floors and seats and tables that looked like they were taken from a 60's bar, out dated and over used. I would not recommend this to anyone and have to say that it is NOT worth the hype at all. There's a couple of places to eat there, but at least two don't allow you in in board shorts, I was totally shocked, they are beside the pool. They are restaurants that I will NEVER visit as a result. All in I would say simply avoid this place unless you have more money than sense. It simply is not worth it at all."
,,Great views but entry ticket price bites,3.0,,"A bit overrated 100% touristic attraction. Be ready for some wait in the lines and crowds of visitors occupying all good spots to enjoy the night Singapore views. But if you are here to boost your ego, then you probably, wont bother much. Some great selfies are guaranteed. Night views are truly awesome.
On the out, we were invited for a drink to the roof top bar. No entry ticket required. How stupid was I. I could have a drink AND all these views."
,,Spectacularly overpriced deck - Not a skypark,1.0,,There's no arguing the views are spectacular but contrary to write ups there is no access to park or the hundreds of trees plan Ted. You get access to a small decking area for your money. Nothing more. Even when questioning the staff about the Skypark name they answer with a smile that ts misnamed. Manage your expectatilns but a great photo opportunity.
,,Watched the sunset,3.0,,Well worth staying for the sunset. Watching the lights come up was just beautiful. Just don’t look down 😃. Was a great place to visit.
,,Amazing at Night,4.0,,The views of the marina and the gardens at the bay are superb. Avoid the long queues to ascend by purchasing a 'beat the queue' ticket in advance. The $12 Singapore Dollars is worth it.
,,Pleasure on top,5.0,,"One of the highest tower of Singapore, a three tall tower part off the converted in to observation desk @ 57th floor from where one can view ocean upto a miles and miles, large ships and many more , also you can view whole garden by the Bay Area which looks like a tiny structure. A must visit place of Singapore. And in another part a infinity pool which can only visited if you have stay in MBS hotel. Ticket price S$21 you may get on discounted rate from travel agents also. There are multiple option for food with good quality both at top and inside MBS RISE restaurant is cherry on top."
,,An expensive elevator ride with a dress code?,1.0,,"Pay stupid money to observe the view from the top of a building with restricted space, no tables or chairs and have to queue to buy overpriced drinks. Singapore is losing grip on reality and has become greedy..... because it’s Singapore hike up the prices."
,,Arguably the most well-known landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"Me, my brothers and mother came to the Marina Bay Sands skypark earlier in the week. We got tickets insie the Marina Bay Sands area, and went up the elevator to the sky deck, to have magnificent views of Singapore city. Just incredible. And before that, we were at Merlion park and saw Marina Bay Sands from that area, so instantly recognisable. A great tourist spot."
,,Observatory,3.0,,Went to the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands to view the city landscape from the observatory. Wasn't much impressed with the deck and there is no sitting pkace. It's also quite dark with their restaurants around. The hotel area is cardoned off so it's a very limited experience for the value paid. Instead the views from Hotel Fullerton are much better.
,,"Spectacular by day, sensational by night!",5.0,,"It was on the bucket list before going to Singapore and the Skypark didn't disappoint. An amazing engineering feat, it dazzles at night, proudly displaying the Singapore flag underneath the observation deck. The price seems to be a little up there, but witnessing the Singapore landscape at night from 56 floors up is worth every cent. We visited in time for the 8pm laser show which just added a bit more to the already busy landscape of colours provided by the buildings, boats and grand prix track. Only downer was the time it took to buy tickets. It would be of great benefit to install a few self-service ticket kiosks for those savvy enough to buy tickets without the chit-chat."
,,Vista vista vista,4.0,,Best view of Singapore by far. Visited via the ce la vi restaurant. $20 vouchers. Short notice stop over in Singapore. Only had a day to check it out. This was worth it. Very cool.
,,Poor value,2.0,,"The price for a non-guest of the hotel to visit the skypark is over-the-top considering it's basically just a viewing deck. Not a good-value experience. Photo op is good (SIngapore skyline), but not worth the price."
,,Fantastic view at night,4.0,,We went here for a drink to celebrate a friends special birthday and this view is spectacular From the bar area. The lounge while being comfortable you need to turn around to take in the view the high tables would have been better. There is a few to get there but is refundable off your purchased and drinks for a rooftop bar are very reasonably priced even cocktails.
,,Expensive and limited access,1.0,,"You pay SGD23 to get access to only half of the SkyPark deck (or probably less than half). The other parts including the swimming pool are only accessible by hotel guest. The view from the top is nice however you won’t spend more than 15 minutes there as there is no seat to sit down. The only chance to spend more time there probably is to order something from the one and only expensive restaurant, which we didn’t do. Apart from the view there are only a few panels providing general information about some landmark buildings, and nothing else. And you can pay SGD30 for a photo taken at the entrance with fake background lol."
,,"A ""Wow"" place. A masterpiece of architecture, engineering and construction in Singapore",5.0,,This positively imposing masterpiece stands large in Singapore. We took the elevator up to the observation deck on the top and spent time at the restaurant and bars on the upper level. A magnificent experience. From the top one can see a panoramic view of the city state. Of interest was that it looks down towards the F1 Grand Prix circuit. Interesting. The Singapore F1 takes place during September and is a night race. We very highly recommend a visit to this amazing place. One can access the area by MRT.
,,Great view of the city!,4.0,,The Gardens by the Bay Skypark offers a great view of the city. It's a little bit pricey for just viewing the observation deck but still a must see tourist attraction.
,,A must see,5.0,,Everything was as expected. Awesome. Great place with a great view. A photographer's delight. Sat here for hours just soaking in the view.
,,Mostly a waste of time,2.0,,"We went up as a large family of about 25 people. It wasn’t a great experience, queue management is poor and the payoff at the end wasn’t worthwhile for the ticket price of SGD 23 per head.

Queues were about 30 minutes to go up (about 6.30 in the evening), and about 15 minutes to get down (about 7.45). Some of us decided to go up later around 9.30pm. There was no queue then.

The views were great, but are of a cityscape that could be anywhere in the world. If you know Singapore, it can be interesting, but if you don’t, well, you might as well be in Shanghai, Paris or Kuala Lumpur just to name a few places with tall buildings.

There’s a restaurant or two up there, but you need to book, as they’re quite popular. Otherwise it’s just selfies, photos and a kiosk selling some cold drinks. You can swim at the Infinity Pool, but you need to be a hotel guest. It’s all slightly pointless."
,,Great view of Singapore,5.0,,"A small cost for a spectacular view of the Marina, the buildings and Gardens By The Bay. Reached via the MRT and a walk along the promenade or through the beautiful hotel."
,,You should visit this,4.0,,We visited today and got really excellent views of Singapore. There is no seating so you are not encouraged to linger however you can dine up there but pricing is probably greater than most would pay.
,,Worth it!!,5.0,,Amazing views up here. Pretty crowded the night we went up but you can't beat these views from the 57th floor!! Drinks are very expensive but the opportunity to go up is a must.
,,Good spot to view Singapore landscape,4.0,,Go during the transition from day to night period and you will be mesmerized by the view. Enjoy the breeze and the company of your loved ones.
,,Okay,4.0,,"If your really into views then this is for you. I felt that it was a little pricey to get up, a little hard to find in the hotel, and nothing to exciting at the top. They should have a restaurant that you can eat at or some chairs."
,,Great view,5.0,,"Make sure to get your tickets before you visit as there are a lot of visitors, especially in the evening."
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,Okay so I didn't stay here (thank goodness) but I did visit and went to Spago on the top level for dinner. A little off putting sharing a lift with someone in their bathers when you are dressed up for fine dinning. There are tourists EVERYWHERE here and I can only imagine how much of a nightmare it would be if you were staying here. Busy all the time no doubt.
,,You have to go to say you’ve been!,5.0,,"We bought the tickets earlier on in the day and returned at nighttime to see the city of Singapore all lit up.
A quick lift up to the 56th floor and then you witness some great views! If you’ve already been to Gardens by the Bay then the trees there look tiny and you realise how high up you really are!!!
Superb views!"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Absolutely breath taking view of Singapore. Well worth the $96 for the four of us to check it out. If in Singapore why not.
,,Warning!,3.0,,"The views are incredible from the sky park. However, when you pay for an all day pass, this does not mean you can go out and go back in later.
We wanted to see Singapore from the sky park at day and at night.
I would highly recommend that instead of paying $S23 per person, you book to go to the Italian restaurant ‘Lavo’.
It is on the same floor as the sky park, it has great views, and you can go there for a meal or just a drink. You don’t have to pay for access either.
We felt a little robbed that we could not re- enter the sky park at night."
,,"Expensive, great view, dubious service",4.0,,"Fantastic views of the city and the light-show in the Bay. Drinks expensive but not too bad. Toilets badly signposted and down a flight of stairs, so most people used the mobility toilet which was the only one easy to see. Music over-loud considering nobody was there to dance."
,,Dinner and watched the world cup match,4.0,,View was beautiful! You won’t have access to the infinity pool unless you stay there. It is a very pricy place given that it’s one of the TOP attractions in sg. So be prepared to spend a lot. We had to pay for entrance but you can try signing up as a member to get the mbs card for some benefits!
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"This is a must for anyone who loves or even appreciates gardens. World class, probably the best I’ve ever seen.
If you are lucky enough to see the orchid gardens attached that’s the icing on the cake! Wear comfortable walking shoes and you’ never regret it. The staff around the gardens are helpful and obviously dedicated and very pleasant. Clean, easy to find toilets there and we accessed the gardens via the fantastic hop-on, hop-off busses."
,,Go for Ce la vie at same cost :),5.0,,I suggest one should go for Ce la vie instead of sky park at CIE la vie you get nice place to sit and enjoy the drink with the same entry fee
,,Great View from the top,4.0,,"As part of a guided tour we went to the Skypark. It was an evening trip so you could see the lights from the gardens and the wheel. The view was great, as you walk around you see the bay too. Luckily it wasn't too busy so did not have to wait to get to the top. Definitely a place to see."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Rather than paying $23 to visit the Skypark on level 56 we were tipped off that for $20 you can visit the ce la vi bar on level 57 and get a $20 voucher to spend at the bar. Result! The entrance to ce la vi is in tower 3. For $20 you can get a large beer or a cocktail.

Once at the top of the marina bay sands the view is spectacular. Our waiter was great and although the beer and cocktails were expensive, with the view the whole experience was well worth the $20.

There are 2 bars to choose from - turn left or right after coming out of the lift. I would recommend looking at both before ordering a drink."
,,Great views of Singapore!,5.0,,Would absolutely recommend this place to all tourists to get a unique glimpse at Singapore from above. Go at night! The views are simply spectacular and mind-boggling!
,,What a view!!,5.0,,"Even though you had to pay to go up, it was well worth it. The views were spectacular but very hot on the day we were there. It is open in the evening too, that would be worth a look as well."
,,Must do.,4.0,,We went up the top of Marina Bay as part of a tour. We were there on a Saturday night along with everyone else but the views were worth it. We had seen Singapore from the Flyer during the day so it was nice to get a night time view. Absolutely stunning. There is a restaurant up the top and bar so you can get a drink. Very busy but worth it.
,,Great views,5.0,,An amazing building. The whole area is superb with many great views and amazing buildings. As with most things in Singapore it is expensive to visit the observation deck but the views are worth it
,,"Great view, pricey",4.0,,"Had a drinking the bar on top of the marina bay hotel. Drink was lovely, staff were super friendly and the view was amazing Only downside is that he drinks were 26 dollars each."
,,Marina Bay área,5.0,,Amazing área to visit during the night with show at garden Bay with músic and light it is around 21 at evening and incredible experience
,,Amazing!,5.0,,One of the most breath taking places in Singapore. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Great!
,,Great views,5.0,,"If you like city views this is a must. Great views over the gardens, marina bay, CBD and out to sea looking at the many ships in port. Be aware there are a few lines depending what you want to do (restaurant, bar or viewing platform) so make sure you line up at the right one. I went just before sunset so get Day and night views (would recommend), and also stayed to watch the light show from above."
,,Cocktaills and Iconic Views,5.0,,A must experience - 57 floors high - the best views of the city. We had cocktails and admired the views. Go at 6.30 and watch the day turn to evening over the city. Drinks alittle pricey but worth it for the views.
,,Nice.,4.0,,"Nice and a great view. There is a drink to buy, but you are in a gusting sun all the time. No access to the restaurant or the hotel's pool."
,,Awesome architecture,5.0,,Indeed it is amazing to see the skypark as it is very unique and there’s nothing else in this world like this. I would recommend coming in during weekdays somewhere in the afternoon where there’re lesser people and not so hot.
,,Total Tourist Trap,2.0,,"The only time the entry fee is worth it is after sunset. Save the money, go directly to the Ce La Vi bar, spend it on the expensive drinks there :-)"
,,Excellent views of Singapore,5.0,,Excellent views of Singapore. We visited on a day when it had been raining so they didn't open the outside of the bar area. Instead we chose the outside viewing area
,,better option that the 'flyer' wheel,4.0,,"for a high up overview of singapore you can access this skydeck and stay as long as you want for the views, whereas the 'flyer' only gives you a once round revolution and less height. Note the public access sky deck is only the northern rounded portion of the bridge across the 3 towers and the access to the elevators can be difficult to find if walking over the millenium bridge (somehow you have to cross the road somewhere?). When looking at the costs for the skydeck access, note that one of the rooftop restaurants provides a separate access option - their price including an 'expensive' drink - that works out about the same price but of course you have the drink."
,,Singapore from different angles,5.0,,"I decided to go to skypark after shopping at MBS shoppes. To get in i had to go to hotel tower 3 loby. There will be an elevator down to the ticket purchasing counter. After that there will be an officer who directs us to take pictures in the photo booth and go to the skypark through the elevator up to the 56th floor.

Based on my experience at that time there was no queue at all. For the comfort and safety of all guests, they limit the number of people who can enter at any one time. So there were only some visitors are on the deck. That means I can take pictures freely without being distracted by many people who can block the view.
I really enjoy being there and not in a rush to finish because anyway there is no limit to the time we may stay.

In my humbled opinion worth it or not it depends on how we enjoy it. For me this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Awesome!"
,,Beautiful view and must visit !,5.0,,This is an iconic building built in Spore on the reclaimed land with impossible engineering and architectural challenges to errant this building ... make it a landmark that you must come to visit when you are in Spore. The SkyPark located and 56 floor of MBS building and you can already assess to visit for drinks or food. The view was magnificent and breathtaking! You see the costal line of Singapore ! The SkyPark at the mall side gave you great view of the MBS. You can walk the link Bridge to get your assess to the garden by the Bay! Worth a visit to experience this iconic impossible built architecture!
,,Beautiful view!,5.0,,"It’s a wonderful view of the city. If you’ve been to other tall towers in other cities, then this one is pretty much the same. The service up and down was fast."
,,"Highlight of our trip, what a superb view",5.0,,"Pricey enough to get up to the top but well worth the views, it really is stunning and you can see for many miles if the day is clear."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Great views, if you prebook you can avoid the queue. But really you’ll not get to see the best of the facility unless you stay in the hotel itself. As a visitor you’ll have seen all you can in an hour."
,,Singapore.,5.0,,Took ages to find where to go to access the lift to take us to the viewing deck. WOW once you get outside. Awesome views over Gardens By The Bay and Singapore. Well worth the visit.
,,No park only deck,2.0,,As a visitor if you don't book a room here then it is not worth to visit this place. Ticket price is not worth for the visit.
,,Excellent View,5.0,,Excellent View of Singapore. Most exiting view. See Singapore in different angle. Nice infinity pool.
,,Great views,5.0,,Spectacular views from the top but expensive to visit . You get a 2 hour slot to spend time on the viewing deck. Better to visit after 3pm as too hot in the morning.
,,"Great view, but that is it.",4.0,,"This is definitely something to do at least once in Singapore. It provides a great view, and I think this just refers to the tourist deck, which is otherwise barren, with some fast food. If it include the hotel's pool area, it is interesting to walk through, but not much else you can do there."
,,City View,4.0,,"We actually check in at Marina Bay Sands , so our entrance was included in the package. We observed both night and day. I personally preferred night but you have to bring a very good camera to capture every thing . I was only using my iPhone so it was not really a good photo at night but acceptable at least on days . You will be able to see the infinity pool from the SkyPark, city view, Gardens by the bay. It was a great experience to see the city view ."
,,Just the Skypark Deck,3.0,,We got stuck behind two tour groups which meant it took a while to go up the lift. The view was pretty awesome and we were there just as the sky began to go dark and the city lit up. It was pretty expensive to go up as 2 adults and 2 kids (age 2 and 6) - roughly $80NZD and people sat on the side of the wall so it wasn't easy to look over the side or read the information panels. We were up there literally for 10 minutes so we didn't get stuck behind the same two groups and others going back down the lift. We probably wouldn't bother going back up again if we visited Singapore again.
,,WOW!!!,5.0,,"An architectural marvel! Fifty-seven floors up, an infinity pool, and Wolfgang Puck’s Restaurant - whoa! A must see!"
,,Great views,5.0,,"$23 or about £12 to go to the skypark - no queue at all!

Great views.

Went up at 6 and got daytime views and stayed for sunset around 7:30 and got great sunset views and night pictures too.

There’s a bar up there, somewhere to eat..."
,,UNIQUE OUT OF THE WORLD EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"On reaching the 57th Floor of the Marina Bay Sands, we landed in Skypark. The height itself is mesmerizing. The songs that were being played in the tunes were thrilling, the views (in the evening) were enchanting. The Singapore Flyer could be seen, with its highest point at a much lower level than the skypark. The Garden by the Bay and the SuperTrees were clearly visisble.

It was a fanstastic experience to be there and spend sometime."
,,Too expensive for what you get?,3.0,,I enjoyed it but honestly a little bit expensive for the limited views you get and considering guests can access for free...
,,Pay to View,3.0,,"Went there with my American colleagues as they are in awe of the buidling.

We walk to the end of the MBS hotel to go down to the basement for the ticketing counter. After paying, we are usher to the other side for elevator to go up.

Once we reached upstair, the staff asked us to group together for photo, but it is up to you in the end if you choose to purchase the photo or not,

initially we were all in awe of the view, but the feelings died off after half an hour.

do check the weather before attempting to go up, as they may close due to bad weather."
,,Yeah okay,3.0,,Worth a visit if you’re into that selfie taking Instagram posting people. Really have nothing more to say just filling the more than 100 words requirement.
,,Amazing hotel,5.0,,I didn't stay there only went on a day visit to the skybar. Expensive but once again a once in a lifetime experience. Fantastic views. Must do if you visit Singapore
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"This place is unbelievable and totally worth the reasonable cost.
The views are 360 degrees and the viewing platform is huge and not crowded. Wish we'd gone back for a night viewing too.
Just be warned that it's 20NZD for a beer at the bar but totally worth it!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Amazing Experience, not to be missed. Its on Level 57 and amazing view of the city. They have restaurant on the roof top as well."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"We stayed one night at MBS and while it’s not cheap, the sky park made it worth it. We spent the whole day up on the roof by the pool, enjoying the view and swimming with the kids. The drinks are expensive up there, but the service is good."
,,"While the views are nice, the price is steep",3.0,,"The views are definitely nice, but at over $30 per person, I can't say the money was worth it and only having 3 elevators makes for some ridiculously long wait times to get up and down. We left 5 minutes before the end of the light show and were lucky we did as we only had to wait 15 minutes to get back down, but the line up behind us was massive within 5 minutes. I'd be surprised if it was less than an hour wait. And the light show is much better when watched from ground level."
,,Infinite love with the Infinity pool,5.0,,"We were staying at Marina Bay Sands so we had access to the Skypark as well as the infinity pool. Thank god we were staying with them because the skypark allows access to tourists in a very small area only. You can find similar experience in other countries too just for the sake of view, but the main deal lies with being in the infinity pool. The infinity pool experience is one of a kind and you certainly don't get it anywhere else is the world. The view is just spectacular and amazing. The infinity pool gives you breathtaking views of Singapore and the harbor. It was worth visiting. I would recommend to spend atleast a night in Marina Bay Sands. The skypark is certainly a place to chill by the pool, enjoy the view with drinks and just relax. Personally one of the best experience I've had in Singapore."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Beautiful views but for the price, I think its a bit over rated. You basically get the lift up, walk around a U shape deck then get the lift back down again!"
,,Great view of city and harbour,5.0,,The skypark is a great view of Singapore city and the harbour. I would go there if I was in Singapore for sure
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Well worth a visit whilst in Singapore...took the option to use the bar as recommended by other reviews and enjoy a cold drink mostly paid for out of your entrance cost.
,,High in the sky,5.0,,Wanted to visit this place and it does not disappoint!! You pay 23SGD to go up to 56th floor which has the viewing gallery and it’s breath taking. The infinity pool is for guests only. Surrounding shops are amazing and food court impressive!
,,Spacious bedroom,5.0,,Great to spend time with family (except for casino off course). Infinity pool is also excellent. Especially love the bedroom.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,The view is spectacular you see all of Singapore and because it’s a main attraction is very busy where you have to que for a bit of time preferable to visit at night .
,,The View from the roof is amazing !,5.0,,"Last time we visited Singapore, this hotel complex was half built. It is unique as there are three hotels with a rooftop garden joining them all together, with a large overhang at one end. We decided we would go up there when it was completed. The lift up to the top was quite reasonable in cost. When you arrive at the top there are gardens, bars, restaurants and a pool for hotel guests only. The views are amazing, you look out all over Singapore … easily seeing the Merlion Statue, Gardens by the Bay, The Sky-wheel and the incredible Singapore skyline. Do make the effort to go up here, you'll not regret it."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Meet our older children in Singapore for a holiday. Ideal spot as inbetween UK where they are and Australia where we currently are. Worried a little about how we would fill the days, we had been told Singapore was quiet. This was a great place, we stayed on the viewing platform for several hours and they got the obligatory selfie/instagram shots. Would recommend, we even experienced the storms and rain from up there and it was spectacular."
,,"Great skyline, light show was a bit blah",4.0,,"A great experience, great way to see the Singapore skyline at night.
We paid for tickets to the Skypark and had a beer on the deck $14 a beer in a plastic cup? Does cost to go up but is worth it for the view, thought the light show would be a bit better than it was, the music from the bar drowns out the music from the light show.
Go early if you want to get a position near the rails to see the light show it does get a bit busy."
,,Small area on top,3.0,,"They do warn you when buying tickets that the roof access fee of SGD23 per person only gives access to non-residents to a small area of the top deck. It’s the big to one end which sticks out unsupported (or so it looks) which isn’t something did anyone with vertigo!
Once you’ve taken in the view on both sides - city and Marina Gardens there’s nothing else to do. So a quick visit."
,,Expensive View,2.0,,"Compared to other options. You do get a nice view, but not worth the money. Other attractions offer more for a smaller fee / no fee"
,,Breathtaking views!,5.0,,"This place has everything! Shopping, eating, drinking, casino, and views of Marina Bay. Stay low on the promenade for the nightly laser light show. Go up to the skypark for dinner or drinks and breathtaking views! My favorite was watching the sunset."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,So well worth the effort and the fee. The 360 degree view at 57 stories up is to be seen to be believed. Enormous building and engineering marvel. How is it possible. Buy tickets from below ground at the marina bay sands at the SkyPark end of the building. Lift from there all the way up.
,,Group,3.0,,Tour group with the visit covering a walkway to view Singapore. Not a great deal. Would like to have seen more of the garden area.
,,A real highlight of Singapore,5.0,,"Going to the 57th floor is fantastic for the view and the bar/restaurant. Very romantic. The night skyline was wonderful and there were fireworks in the bay as well. It would be great to stay at the hotel in order to get access to the pool, but it is very pricey. Please note that there is a separate place and price to enter the line for the observation deck which is on the 56th floor, and you cannot go between the floors."
,,Good to explore magnificent views from the top,5.0,,Good place to explore magnificent views from the top of 57 floor.. This should be done for sure when u r on Singapore tour.. Views are really great and offers opportunity to look at entire Singapore from the top..
,,gigantic,5.0,,Singapore is well known for all its shoppingcenters but this one is really beautiful. At the bottom of the centre there’ this ledfloor where children can play on and it also has nice toystores. Downstairs there’ also a foodcourt. It’s a very expensive shoppingarea but worth visiting.
,,Mezmerised,5.0,,"Great views, breezy weather, whats not to light, the position and height with the best views in town. A must if you're visiting Singapore. Better if you're guest at the hotel, the infinity pool is awesome!"
,,A pricey view,3.0,,"View is nice but a little pricey, there are other ways to see the skyline for cheaper. However this does give you a very nice view of almost the whole area. Very hot to go during the day - hard to enjoy in the blazing sun. If you go during the day bring a hat and water. Night might be better. They do NOT allow access to the pool to anyone not staying in the hotel."
,,Definitely!,5.0,,"Definitely take a stroll up here! I’d recommend it to view the whole city. Drinks are awesome and so is food. It’s worth it while in Singapore. More pricey, but worth it."
,,Marina Bay Sand Skypark,4.0,,Have a bird eye view of Singapore while enjoying a meal at the restaurant. You may even have a dip in the infinite pool and admire the 360° view of the vibrant city.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"My family and I had lunch in 'Marina Bay Sands Skypark', it was Excellent. I loved it, the buffet was delicious, it had a lot of variety of food. Even the kids were quiet thanks to the food from different countries! After that, we went to the roof and the view was amazing. All in all definitely an attraction worth going to."
,,Not very good,3.0,,"It is a place to have a wide and high view of Singapore. Well, the admission fee is too high and the place there is not so much things to do."
,,Great view,4.0,,Surprising view seen infront of kids pool. Kudus to the servers walking around to ask every single guest a drink despite under the sun. 👍
,,POPULAR PLACE IN THIS TOWN,5.0,,"the highest hotel in this town. worth to visit and take a lot photos to share to everyone. jika anda ingin menikmati swimming pool nya, anda harus membayar lagi. tetapi jika hanya ingin menikmati pemandangan dan sightseeing tempat ini free enter."
,,A day at marina sands skypark,5.0,,"Amazing experience and cleanliness, staff are very helpful. Once you have your tickets the staff guide you all the way to the top"
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,Don’t miss the Marina Bay Sands when in Singapore. The view from the platform on the top is spectacular. You can see all of the city from the top.
,,"Beautiful views, mediocre food, expensive drinks.",3.0,,"The views are great, the food is mediocre and the drinks are expensive. $22SG for a pint of Stella Artois? I've never paid that much anywhere in the world."
,,Still worth a visut,4.0,,"This is an unbeatable view of Singapore, especially at night. So worth the trip up. You can walk around both sides of the top but just at one end. Weekends nights are crowded. There are dining options on top but overpriced and mediocre IMO."
,,Singapore by night,5.0,,"57 floors up you get to see Singapore from high above. I would recommend visting at night, the city lights and laser show are simply stunning, well worth the entry fee."
,,Great views of city,4.0,,We chose to do this activity in the afternoon. The sun was high in the sky as we took our turn around the wheel. The price was reasonable and the full circle around took approx 30 minutes to complete. There is a commentary as you ascend and descend in the cabin. Each cabin can take up to 24 people and we were lucky enough to go around with only one other couple. I took some fabulous photos. It was super clean and safe
,,Great views of the City,5.0,,"An experience that wasn't that cheap but if you want a great overall view of the city of Singapore, it isn't to be missed."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Spectacular views from level 57 of the marina bay sands. City and ocean views as far as your eye can see. Great photo opportunities and you can also have a meal and drink at Ci la vie a restaurant that is located at the site.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"We really enjoyed this - a little expensive but for us, we had no line to wait in and probably around 20 people on the platform so very different to other reviews. As a result we had plenty time to take in the view (slightly limited by the weather) but really glad we did it."
,,A refreshing outlook !,4.0,,"Head up to this interesting destination at around 5pm for Sundowners ! Great outside area for drinks and nibbles. You pay an entry fee but get the same amount back in credit for refreshments. Note not cheap when your up there - S$20 for a pint of Stella. But for a drink worth it. You may need to hover around the seats and tables. But they do turn over. Have a peep at the pool at the hotel which is on the same level, quite something. The view around is great and with the golden sun coming down a great end of the day. Cheers !"
,,Sky high,4.0,,$20 sgd gains you access the roof top terrace but not the pool. But you can offset this entry cost by having a drink at the bar at the top - so essentially a free drink.
,,Great view!,5.0,,"This was worth a visit, a amazing view of the Maria Bay. Such a great land mark for Singapore. Would highly recommend to pay to visit the viewing platform."
,,Cest la vi Bar definitely worth a visit,5.0,,"When you are not a hotel guest, go to Tower 3 and for a fee of 20 SGD you can take the elevator to the 57th floor for a breath taking view in the cest la vi Bar. You can redeem the 20 SGD for a drink and also have a look at the stunning hotel pool from a distance"
,,Can give it a miss,3.0,,"We bought tickets to both the Gardens by the Bay and the skypark. We had an elderly person with us so we were able to hire the wheelchair at the Gardens by the Bay but had to return it when we were continuing towards the Skypark. It was a very long walk to cross the bridge and walk over. Then the directions and signs were limited and confusing and it was an endless walk.Finally when in the next building, we finally were able to seek directions to where to line up for the skypark.There was no wheel chair available and our elderly visitor was exhausted.After such a long queue , we finally went up to the viewing area.It was not giving us a 360 degree view at all .Probably about a 180 degree view. There was a restaurant which had stairs so we did not go and hence I am not sure if from the restaurant one could get a 360 degree view. After a brief viewing, we had to line up yet again to go down the lift back to ground level. It was a tiring experience and not worth the money spent and the time . Our hotel probably had a better view and hence I could have given this a miss.
It may be a different experience i suppose if we had viewed it from the guest's infinity pool which is available only to in-house hotel guests."
,,Fantastic visit,5.0,,"When you visit this iconic place you must have dinner in the sky restaurant, book a table and you will get two bargains, you get to view on the platform and have dinner in the fantastic restaurant. You must book to get a table in advance.

Enjoy as I did."
,,CEO,5.0,,"A visit to the rooftop restaurant Ce La Vi at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is something no one visiting Singapore will want to miss. Two main experiences that exceed the spectacular views and the marvel of the property itself is the quality of the staff and the quality of the food and service. If you have to choose only one thing to do while in Singapore, make it a flight via the high speed elevators to the top of Singapore and enjoy an unforgettable afternoon or evening being spoiled by everything that is Ce La Vi and the Skypark rooftop experience."
,,An Icon of Singapore,5.0,,"Have a beautiful view of Singapore from the 57Th floor of Marina Bay Sands Skypark. It's simply awesome! We bought a coctail from the bar which could be offset by the entrance S$21 entrance ticket. There you can have a breath taking scenery of Singapore city in panoramic view. Hang around longer and you get to see the sunset view as well.
A place to visit on your bucket list."
,,New Icon for Singapore!,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is an amazing building, it just stands out. View the whole City from the sky deck. Night time is very good, unfortunately had showers when we went up. Cloud covered the area but still nice. Ticket was S $23"
,,Nice nice !!!,4.0,,"Nice place ! Up before the sunshine to see the town with the sun and after during the night. You could not see the garden because it's reserve for the hotel. So, ilt's only for the view on the Singapore."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"Very nice view to watch the sunset and the sunrise. However, it is very crowded at some period of times, so try to come earlier to enjoy the place."
,,Amazing building box ticker.,5.0,,An incredible building of the World. A definite box ticker. About $26 to go up. There is a bar and restaurant on top (apparently very expensive) however the bar is free I understand and would be great view at night.
,,The landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"Go by night and travel to the top - tickets cost 23 Singapore dollars but the view is fab with all the city lights and overlooking the harbour, the gardens etc, A restaurant bar is situated on the top"
,,Best observation park ..among other South Asia countries,5.0,,"Must do in Singapore !! Best to start or end your Singapore trip with this. We reached around 7 , saw a beautiful skyline almost towards end of evening and then the nightlights. It’s just so serene and amazing. Pick up a drink from the bar and best way to chill out and relax."
,,Beautiful view but a little pricey,4.0,,"We decided to go up the marina bay as we had heard from friends it is worth doing. You have to pay about €23 Singapore dollars so around £13ish. We thought it was a little much but went up anyways, there is a little bar where you can get drinks but you should definitely take your own up.

We went around 5pm, saw it during the day, sunset and at night. Wonderful views and can stay up as long as you want, we were lucky enough to go on a day of a national holiday and saw I wonder display of sky divers, air display and fire works!

I would definitely recommend going up if you don’t mind paying a bit for it."
,,its reaLLY GOOD one should take a stay in this hotel yo enjoy it in a best way,5.0,,i stayed in this hotel so i had an access to everything the pool zaccuzi etc etc but club u can visit
,,Great views,4.0,,"The entrance to this is outside the hotel, left hand side as you look at it. A bit pricy to get in but there are some great views. There is plenty of information in a couple of languages and some fantastic photo opportunities. A small kiosk sells basic snacks and drinks as well as a souvenier shop. worth the effort."
,,Great views,4.0,,"The Skypark which links the Marina Bay Sands to Gardens by the Bay is free to visit, and gives great views of the city.
You can also get up to the rooftop restaurant of Marina Bay Sands where they serve 2 for 1 cocktails from 5pm - 7pm. Be aware of the dress code though - this is a classy spot :-)"
,,Breathtaking Observation Deck,5.0,,"For curiosity, we purchased entrance tickets to reach the top of the Sky Park Hotel to take photos of Singapore. From the observation deck, you'll see the Marina Bay, the Singapore Skyline, the waterfront, the domes, and the beauty of Singapore. Don't forget to try their ice cream 6.00/scoop, but it was good though. By the way the money rate: 1USD = 1.36 SGD. Shall I say Singapore is expensive."
,,Drinks were fun,4.0,,"It was great to walk around at MBS at night. Highly recommend it if it is your first time in Singapore. Have a drink at the top, great views and cocktails."
,,Loved this venue,5.0,,I was in awe at this venue -one of the amazing engineering feats I’ve seen. To build this venue with its iconic building green garden surrounds - very relaxing
,,Great - if you are ok with heights (I'm not!),4.0,,"A gravity-defying experience with amazing views. The viewing deck is 70+ floors high and is glass- perimitwtsx for a full-view experience.
It's swelteringly hot and very humid which limits your staying power but the views are spectacular.
Worth the fee, even if the heat and height got the better of me after only ten mins: I have the photographic proof I went there even if I did vlingbtobtje inside wall!"
,,What a view,5.0,,Went here one evening for dinner and drinks. The vibe and energy is excellent. Good music and good food rounded off by breath taking views. I recommend.
,,Night view from the Skypark is a must,5.0,,"Amazing views in the night of the Singapore City and the Financial District. Dazzling lights. Simply a must-do, brownie points for a night visit."
,,Great View,4.0,,"Must Visit this place if you are in Singapore.
Best time to visit is about 5 or 6 pm so you can see golden sun light on singapore and wait longer to see city lights as it turn dark.
View Garden By Bay from top is great too.."
,,Amazing display of first class hospitality traditional values,5.0,,"Singapore excels in hospitality and the unlimited sky view at the skypark makes you perspire excitement and lifestyle at the best. They served absolutely unbeatable cocky, you can also taste the most rare single malt whiskey in the world. There's choice of buffet menus and a la carte. We had lobster with pinot gris and it was delicious and professionally served with skilled knowledge and ability."
,,"After Singapore Flyer, this may be the second best view",4.0,,"Once on the top, head to the restaurant bar and enjoy a nice snack and cold drink. You could have a look at the pool"
,,Great views,4.0,,"Although overcast with haze, the views were still spectacular. It is very hot up there during the day and there is almost no shade."
,,Best place in singapore,5.0,,"Great excellent place, the indian restaurant called Punjabi grill is out of this world, love the garlic naan"
,,NICE VIEWS,4.0,,During a tour around Singapore we called at the Marina Bay Sands and travelled to the sky deck from where the views of the island city are magnificent. If time had allowed there were good shopping opportunities on the ground floor of the building. Worth visiting.
,,a must do..,5.0,,doesn't cost anything.. unless you have something to much & drink.. but even then worth it.. watch the sun go down and the city come alive.. great place to watch the light show..
,,Panoramic view of Singapore,4.0,,"From the Marina Bay SkyPark Observation Deck you can get a breathtaking 360 degree view of Singapore. The view from the deck is different in the day and in the night when the lights on the other tall buildings come on. On both the times the view is spectacular.

The experience is totally worth 23 SGD tickets. If you buy tickets online you can skip the line and save couple of dollars.

We avoided the photo trap as we felt that the photoshoped pictures are not worth 40 SGD they ask for."
,,Just for a photo spot,3.0,,"This place is very iconic spot in Singapore. Basically, I just come to this spot, take the photo and go. The place is very crowded with tourists, which means it would be very hard to get the clear background because lots of tourists will be the background. In my opinion, this place is a nice to have photo spot in Singapore because I can't see the historical value in here."
,,Rude staff,1.0,,Our visit to Skypark was disappointing as we found the staff quite rude. One male staff member was very rude and when we pointed this out to his colleagues they just laughed at us. I'm not sure why they are in the service industry if they don't like people.
,,Day & Night,5.0,,"Singapore must be place, 20min away from airport and the view is incredible. Really worth to go day and night time."
,,Pay to go to the bar,5.0,,You get your fee back with a voucher to spend on a drink. The perfect place to watch the sun go down
,,Breathtaking views!,4.0,,"A visiting old friend mentioned she had yet to see the views of the Sky Park and since we had time after the invigorating walk at the Gardens-by-the-Bay, we popped over. Took a ride to Ce Va Li at the 58th floor for a drink and enjoyed the some of the breathtaking views of the surroundings including the Marina Sands sky pool located next to the bar. We had a good time resting and chit-chatting. Worth a visit but the ticket up is pretty costly if you aren’t having a drink at the bar unless you intend to sit at the Observation Deck at the 57th floor for hours."
,,"Best to go to Bar and get the ""free"" drink",4.0,,Rather than pay $23 to just get the viewing deck we paid $20 to go to the bar at the top which means you get the views (just not quite to the same extent as the deck but close enough) and you get a $20 voucher to spend at the bar - which basically equates to one drink ;) Apparently Wednesday to Sunday you are not allowed to wear jandals/flip flops we went on Monday so I was OK
,,"Phenomenal views, they try and get you with the photo!",4.0,,"Great location to view the city, they take a photo of you when you go in and photoshop the skyline onto it. We wanted to buy it but you have to do it before you see the view which doesn't make sense - We came back after looking at the views and wanted to buy it but they couldn't find the photo. The bar at the top was expensive, but that's to be expected. They'd run out of fresh coconut, which was disappointing for a non-alcohol drinker, so I had tap water."
,,Cool Place - Rooftop Restaurant or Bar a Must,4.0,,"The hotel itself is impressive, but the rooftop restaurant, bar, and pool area are a must see. Great views, cool vibe, more adult than child friendly."
,,Sight seeing,4.0,,"Visit Marina Bay Sand (MBS). Could be access through MRT and exit and Bayfront Station.
Around is the bay and Helix Bridge. A big shopping area with many brands.
A big eating choice.
Visit to the MBS skydeck (thru side door at tower 3), a ticket and elevator ride to level 56 in less than a minute. A full 280° view of Singapore. A outdoor cafe (Ce La Vie) where we could sit down and enjoy the time and view. For those who prefer just sight seeing could walk around the deck to see and take pictures. Entrance and exit is different door. There is also choice of softdring and ice cream at the deck.
Another attraction is the casino (didn't visit - so no review/comment).
For those who want to visit other close attraction. There is a route to Garden By the Bay."
,,Stunning views,4.0,,We visited the sky park this afternoon after a visit the gardens by the bay and the view is excellent I would however recommend going just before dark so you get the best of both worlds. Once your up there there is a small bar area but nowhere to sit unless you pay extra to go up a level
,,Ok if you like heights,3.0,,"I am not too keen on heights so this visit did nothing for me but my husband enjoyed it very much. We watched a
Light show from up there. I watched my clock the whole time till when I could come back down. I was glad to get out of there."
,,Awesome views,4.0,,"This is the least expensive way to view the skyline and harbour of Singapore.
We got caught by the photo scalpers for a photo costing $45, at least we resisted the $80 package.
They have senior discounts as well.
An enjoyable experience and interesting to see the vast skyline."
,,360 degree View of Singapore,4.0,,"From the boat-shaped deck of the Skypark you gain a 360 degree uninterrupted view of Singapore for as far as the eye can see. Great for photo opportunities.
A lack of seating on the deck doesn't allow for any rest time up there (maybe that's the idea) but would be a nice touch for the elderly visitors."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"We loved it! As tourists, we found the place very extraordinary and the views marvellous. The infinity pool was so incredible too! Don't forget to bring your camera and your swim suits!"
,,Great Views,5.0,,"If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands, access here was included with your stay. You need to bring your key card with you to gain access. Great views of both sides...city and gardens!"
,,Unelievable views,5.0,,When we heard the price and we were only going up for the view we were a bit unsure. However the $23 we paid was worth every cent. The views of Singapore are unbelievable from the Skypark. Would recommend it
,,Selfie paradise,4.0,,"The main reason for people to ascend to the skypark is to take selfies and post them on social media. There is little real swimming going on in the pool, and the park part tends to be more quiet (which is good). There are some nice restaurants and bars. Entrance is free for hotel guests."
,,must see for first time visitor,4.0,,"the best place to have a nice view to all Singapore , a rare and amazing construction to discover , recommend to during the sunset"
,,Best tip for Marina Bay Skypark,5.0,,"Prior to visiting Singapore I had read a review suggesting that visitors opt for the bar ‘Ce La Vie’ on the sky deck rather than the promoted option. Prior to our visit I did not realise that the infinity pool was not an option at all unless you are a hotel guest. I had left options open in case this was included with the Skypark, once I realised it wasn’t, it was a no brainer. No wait, the entrance fee was slightly lower ($20)and you get food/drink vouchers for the same value. Kids were free. The view is amazing and I don’t see why anyone would really take the other option. It was ok for the kids and not crowded. A Singapore Sling was $22."
,,City view and swiming,5.0,,"If you are in Singapure and miss it you miss everything, just take it at day time so you will have best view of city"
,,Fantastic views but avoid the bar,2.0,,The observation deck offers breathtaking views which are worth the outrageous entry price of $23 but the bar is incredibly slow and amazingly expensive but not very good. My advice is enjoy the views but steer clear of the bar.
,,outstanding views,4.0,,If in Singapore this is a must visit to see the 9pm laser and firework display. However gets busy as space is limited
,,Best view on Singapore,5.0,,"There are the best view on Singapore. Еhe price might be less, but it's worth it. Best time for visiting 19:00-20:30 - you will see day and night"
,,Brian Arnold,5.0,,Wow what an experience.amazing to be able to be so high above the land and to be able to see this beautiful city of Singapore. Definatley recommend this
,,Majestic Views,5.0,,It was an experience to have gone up the 57 Floor to the Marina Sands Skypark. Spectacular panaromic views of Singapore with the cool and nice Infinity Pools. Cafes and bars line the pool for a drink and snacks whilst enjoying the dips and good view of Singapore.
,,Singapore with a bird's eye view,5.0,,"always enjoyed coming to MBS skypark for a great time to show how beautiful Singapore skyline is at night to visiting friends, usually i end up at Spago or Celavi (ex kudeta) for some chill drinks and good conversation"
,,One of the iconic constructions !!,5.0,,The endless shopping area in Sands was really unbelievable. The view at the top floor was stunning.. You just got to visit this place.
,,Beautiful view from the top,4.0,,"Amazing view! And if you are in photography, it is must visit for excellent panorama shots. It was raining when we were there, it felt like we are in mid of clouds and got some excellent shots"
,,Great view but expensive,4.0,,"We paid the $20 each to go up to the bar - your entry can be used on a drinks voucher. This pretty much gets you one drink for your $20 as the taxes a LARGE!
If you are there later in the afternoon you have limited choices on where to sit e.g. view over the flower domes wasn't available if you were not eating.
The view is fantastic but I would really only do this once."
,,Sky high views,4.0,,"This unique hotel dominates the skyline around the Marina Bay Area. A fantastic opportunity to experience the most incredible views around the bay from the front of this boat like structure perched over 57 floors high on top of this iconic hotel. If you’re not a hotel guest then your skypark pass allows access only via a speedy lift to the large viewing platform. There are refreshments available along with the souvenir photos. As well as the most amazing photo opportunities of the gardens by the bay, Marina Bay Area, the F1 starting grid & Singapore flyer & many more key tourist sights, you also can see across towards the stunning infinity pool area exclusive to hotel guests. Cannot beat the 360* views up here."
,,Visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark in the evening. Make sure it is a clear night. The view is over Singapore skyline is fantastic
,,Memorable Trip,5.0,,"The Sands Hotel was amazing! and the service was fantastic. Could not fault this hotel. We also went to their restaurant on Tues which was a buffet night and the range of food available was extraordinary from all around the world. It was around £25-£30 per head which for this type of hotel and restaurant wasn’t expensive.

The Sky Park was also amazing and you could see the whole of Singapore. Definitely one to go for."
,,Views Views Views,4.0,,"If you're in to photography or just want 360 degree views this is worth the $23 admission. Tips - It gets crowded around the 7.45pm Gardens by the bay Lightshow and 8pm for the Marina Bay Sands Spectra lightshow, however is no where near as crowded for the 8.45 and 9pm shows.

It is not that great a viewing spot for those two shows in any event as you don't really hear the music from that high. The sun setting over the city from that viewpoint however was spectacular the day I went."
,,Wow the views are amazing,5.0,,"The wife and I had a very enjoyable drink with nibblies sitting at the top of this amazing structure. The drinks are too expensive to stay here too long, but well worth the one off experience. The views are breathtaking and spend the time and walk around as the view out to sea are just as amazing as those over the city"
,,Expensive just for a View,4.0,,"We decided to visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark as what we had read and seen it was cheaper than the Millennium Wheel and you got better views!

We went first thing in the morning and it was quite quiet and so had no queues to wait for the elevator and got good access to the platform deck and was able to take some great pictures even though the sky was very gloomy and grey!

Once you walked around the top which is only about 270 degrees as you are unable to see Sentosa Island from the platform , there is nothing else to do. Was disappointed that you couldn't visit the gardens on the top so was expensive just for photo taking!"
,,Great views,3.0,,"I went on this as my husband wanted me too. I’m not good with heights so didn’t obviously go right near the edge. The views are fantastic so if you don’t mind heights you’d love it.
You can’t go near the pool or the garden. They do say this before you pay. You’re limited to the one area and there aren’t any seats or shade.
It was sprinkling when we were there so take an umbrella but if it’s sunny you’ll need a hat."
,,"Great view of the city, but expensive",4.0,,"While the view on top is indeed beautiful, the entrance to the observation skydeck is quite expensive at 23 SGD per adult.

You can buy tickets from the basement of Marina Bay Sands, then take the elevator to the 56th floor.

It can get too crowded especially during sunset."
,,Spectacular Views of Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth a visit if you are in Singapore, it looks like a big ship on top of 3 skyscrapers with restaurants, bars and an infinity pool, at the base their are lots of designer shops and food outlets, with a theatre and a casino. Great light show after dark"
,,NICE VIEWS,4.0,,"We were for a cocktail at the roof to see the skyline of Singapore.

The place was busy, but they find us a spot on the bar.

The drinks was nice, not memorable but the snacks were really nice.

A place to go and spend a evening and see the views"
,,Worthy?,2.0,,Views... amazing Staff ... useless. The ticket lady insisted on not buying the tickets because it might rain!! Luckily we didn’t listen to her and went ahead
,,Amazing views but a rip off,3.0,,Yes the view is amazing but crazy price. You pay $20 to go up there which is then credited to you for a drink but then a small glass of wine costs $28.
,,Best Views of Singapore 🇸🇬,5.0,,"Had the fortune to stay at Marina Bay Sands as a guest and absolutely love the Skypark.

Singapore’s best views of the Marina Bay light show and fireworks.

Great food and refreshments available too.

Non guests must enter via Tower 3 and there is no seating so be prepared to stand during your visit or sit on the deck."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,An outstanding building with everything under one roof. Allow lots of time when visiting. It’s huge.
,,Nice view,3.0,,"After i bought my ticket at tower 3, i got into the elevator to the top. The view is nice, but in my opinion i preferred the view from the Singapore Flyer."
,,"Sky park view certainly outstanding value, not the cafe bar at the top.",3.0,,"Such an excellent view to give perspective on singapore.
Do not bother with the bar cafe at the top. Cup of te $10’ and after 20 minute wait we realised we were not a priority. Obviously alcoholic drinks, $16 beer and $28 cocktails more important, so we left, got back on the Hop on/Hop off bus and ended up with $1.25 iced tea and $3.50 fabulous lunch at the MRT station hawker centre in Ion Centre."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,I stayed in Singapore last August for 20 hours during my layover with scoot. Marina bay sands was one of the 1st things I visited after going out of the Changi airport. The view was just amazing and I hope I’ll be able to stay for a night in the hotel next time so I can go for a swim at the edge ;)
,,"Great view, nice for photos shoot & walk",4.0,,You can go there in evening or morning hours to have a nice photos and walk along the corniche area.
,,"Not much to look for, if already visited Singapore flyer",2.0,,We made mistake by visiting Marina Bay sands sky deck. There's nothing to do after going up to 56 floors. We already visited Singapore flyer in the morning and experienced the view from top. Charges are very high to just go on 56th floor of the hotel. This is the only activity where they charged $ 17 for my 2 year old kid. Rest every where his entry was free. I don't find this place worth money and time.
,,Good view,4.0,,"Verry good view from observation dect, but it was pricey so one time was enough for us. The service was not good at all the attendant was very rude."
,,Views all day and lights at night.,5.0,,"We were in Singapore in May of 2017 and decided to go to the sky park midweek. We initially went to the concierge desk adjacent to the casino and requested tickets to the skydeck but were advised to go outside to a desk catering solely for skypark patrons. On arrival at this desk we were told that entry was SGD 10 each but as it was approaching 10 pm we would only have approx 15 minutes before closing time. It was suggested that we go back to the original desk and request to go to the bars and restaurants where we would have the same wiews. Tickets cost us SGD 23 each but on reading the ticket it explained that if presenting the ticket when ordering drinks the ticket cost would be deducted from the drink bill. We eventually stayed for a couple of hours, the views of the city at night were fantastic and our drinks were discounted. What more could you want?"
,,Must see as its a highlight of Singapore,3.0,,Not bad but wouldn't go a second time. Its certainly not Empire State or Rockefeller Centre and not much happening up top. First time to Singapore and so had to see for myself.
,,Great view but be early,5.0,,"There is 2 options getting to the roof at floor 57.
Either you go to the bar paying 20 sg dollar and getting a drink or something else for the value of 20 SGD per ticket. Or you pay for going to the observation deck.
Either option you get a good view. but with the bar you get a sitting chair, if you are early. And you should be early for both options because it gets early crowded up there."
,,Marina Bay Sands Sky Park,4.0,,"Booking this activity will not only grant an access to Sky Deck an entry to Marina Sands Hotel also but not to the swimming pool area.

We found the best & cheapest deal for this at Klook, pls note the online booked ticket can't be used for direct entry instead one need to redeem voucher into ticket from the shop near the entrance. There is big size lift"
,,Em's on Tour,5.0,,"What a labyrinth of windows and walls. An amazing structure and the views from the top are just amazing.
A very upmarket venue although the lobby resembles a train station in Europe and not so welcoming as we believed such a prestigious icon could have been. The lifts travel very swiftly to 55+ floors up. We expected oxygen masks to fall. The view is breathtaking."
,,Breathtaking view!!!,5.0,,"Its on top of Marina Bay Sands, the Iconic hotel. Its atop the right tower when you face the hotel from Marina Mall. Entrance to Skypark is from outside and you need not enter the main hotel to reach Skypark. In peak season, it can get very crowded, expect some waiting time for the elevators. View from the top is breathtaking, the best view of Singapore. I will rate this much better than the flyer for two reasons - You get the best view in a flyer only for a few minutes but here you can enjoy the view as much as you want to. Second, MBS Skypark is at a much higher than flyer. If pressed for time, prefer MBS Skypark. I preferred evening time more than day as I wanted to see the city with lights. There is coffee shop and a restaurant on top. Coffee shop is reasonably priced but the restaurant is expensive."
,,WOW.........,5.0,,"We actually didn't see much of this this time around, but we did se the light show on the river, and the shops are incredible, but expensive....the river and gondolas that run through the centre is great and lovely if its a first time visit...but this time we went with the sole purpose of going to the Casino....it was ONE place our friend wanted to see.....it was well worth going but only once to see the place...you do need your passport to gain entrance in and out.so be aware of this...."
,,Great view,5.0,,"You take a lift up to the 52nd floor, walk out to the end of the 'ship' deck that bridges the three Marina Bay Sands towers and get fantastic views of the bay area and city - well worth the ticket."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Awesome view over Singapore a beer 15 S$, but the overview allowed this prices. Check your clother before you go because they have a dresscode on some days"
,,Unreal view of the city!,4.0,,"I visited the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and went up all the way to the top, which is a long way! The view from the top was beautiful, the best way to see over Singapore. My only problem was the cafe was closed."
,,jawdropping view,5.0,,"Had the fortune to visit the skypark & infinity pool when mbs offered my family a room for the weekend. view from the skypark was just so beautiful, can walk around to explore a full 360 view of the singapore skyline from mbs."
,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore.,5.0,,"From the Merlion, we walked around the bay, across the Helix Bridge viewing parts of the F1 circuit, and entered the Marina Bay Sands complex close to the Lotus ArtScience Museum. There is lots to see in Singapore! Going up onto the observation deckof this iconic building is a must, Level 56, $SD46 (equivalent £25 for two of us). This gives access to a part of this level, NOT the bar or restaurant for which you need more expensive tickets to start with. You cannot swim in the infinity pool unless you are a resident. Nonetheless, it is a great experience and the views are very good. The deck is open air, this makes it better for some and worse for others. There are good information boards which help interpret the view.
TOP TIP – Even if you don’t go to the top, make sure that you spend lots of time inside the building, each of the towers is largely hollow and this gives terrific views up the inside, there are also shopping malls and lots of places to eat."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"A vibrant and a wonderful place to chill out on top of the world! No doubt the food and drinks are rather pricey there but it's worth the experience especially chilling in the Infinity Pool during sunset with a glass of wine .. great view, nice pool and endless awesom view!"
,,A top place to view the city of Singapore,5.0,,A great place to celebrate birthdays above the town. The chocolate cakes is very good. To have lunch with friends can be a memorable time for a long time
,,Architecture,5.0,,If you admire architecture this is definitely worth a look! Singapore is my favorite place for architecture & this is no exception. If you cannot get reservations for the restaurant then definitely hit the bar just for the views. The drinks are VERY speedy but you won't have to pay for the viewing deck. Sunset is perfect.
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,The Skypark offers amazing view of Singapore. You have view of entire CBD as well as Merlion Park. Also the Gardens by the Bay looks great from Skypark
,,Family stay,4.0,,"We stayed as a family at MBS, so were lucky enough to get free entry into the skypark. It's definitely one of those things you must do in singapore"
,,Needs more light in the dark,3.0,,"We went there around 8PM for the night city lights and the recommended overlooking water show down below,
View was nice, but we had a hard time taking pictures as there was minimal light available.Spent $80++ for our quick 25min stay, at least provide some light for a decent family photo. No souvenirs available too, only the costly $80 picture souvenir, which we didnt avail."
,,Best View in Singapore,5.0,,A must if you are in Singapore. Don't miss the skypark experience if you are in Singapore. The 25 dollars you pay to go up will be well worth it. It is the best view in the country. Have a meal and a drink after you are done with the city view selfies. Best time to go is around 5 or 6 when the sun is just about to set. you get to see the city view both during the day and night.
,,Marina Bay sands,5.0,,"The Skypark is a gift for all those who cant afford the hotel, a fee of 23$ to visit the obersavation deck."
,,Touristic area but great top floor restaurant,5.0,,"This is a tourist attraction comprising a high end shopping mall, hotel with a roof top swimming pool which is only open for hotel residents and guests. There are two restaurants at the top floors both of which offer stylish dining. We went to Spago which is the more casual of the two restaurants. Long shorts and sandals are allowed there but not at the other restaurant. Service and food are great and the prices reflect that. I wouldn't mind going back again."
,,Nice,3.0,,Its nice to visit marina bay skypark but i thing if you not stat in hotel is not worth it to pay for it.
,,Engineering feat but also a management wonder,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands sky park is a feat of engineering. An intriguing design to whet the appetites of architects, engineers and landscape architects, a wonder for pool builders and landscapers, an exquisite hotel foyer for visitors and guests, super fast lift, options of eateries.
The views is amazing. More so for hotel guests seeing it from the infinity pool. A 360 view point. There is a fee but well worth the experience. We paid for cocktails - why not take your time to admire the feeling of being at the top."
,,It's worth it,5.0,,"Ok so it's expensive to stay at, but wow it's a have to do. Breaky up,overlooking Singapore and the pool the pooIt's definitely worth it. Save a bit by hiring a fridge for $10 sing and filling the bar with your own drinks. Good for a couple nights wow factor. Town and attractions close by or short taxi."
,,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY..!,1.0,,"$23/adult Gets you access ONLY to a wooden deck with ""the view"". Staff tries to sell your own picture for $80 bucks in a leather pouch and a snow globe. Wasted $100+ for a family to get the for 10mins of NOTHING.! A beer costs $12. Guess its the hard work of bringing them on the 45 sec elevator from ground floor to skydec."
,,Best cocktails,5.0,,"we visited the main bar (by the infinity pool, not at the end of the building) and the cocktails were the best we had in Singapore (& much better than Raffles pop up bar which was more expensive!)"
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"No picture can capture the beautiful Singapore city view from the Skypark. You need to visit yourself to cherish the moment of your life.

I highly recommend to stay for 1 night at Marina bay hotel to get free access to Skypark as well as the pool. It's worth.

Book the hotel in advance for best price."
,,It's like looking down from a plane,5.0,,"This is a great view of the Marina Bay area and the coast, it gets busy up there and there is no regulation on the numbers of people and how long they can stay so to avoid the crowds, get there early they open at 0930, and because Singapore weather is not always clear. be flexible with your chosen day. @ $23 each you don't want to be in the mist, if you're staying at the hotel, it's free."
,,Luxury and elegance.,5.0,,Their conference rooms and their way of doing a world congress it`s professional and no mistakes. The view from the lake it`s impressive knowing that it`s hand made.
,,Breathtaking View,4.0,,"A marvel in itself, great infrastructure and a breath taking view. The outdoor swimming pool on the 56th floor and the roof top restaurant on the 57th floor are amazing"
,,You get what you pay for,4.0,,"You have to access the hotel in order to find the elevator to either the 56 or 57th floor. Free for hotel guests. 56th floor SIN$23, view platform, not sure what else (haven’t been), 57th fl SIN$20 to access, you‘ll then be at the Cé La Vi Bar & Restaurant. Fantastic view and despite the high prices at the bar (standard for SIN in such locations), it is well worth to spend enough time to also watch the sunset. You may want to come early to get a good seat with view."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Marina bay sands sky park is a truly amazing feat of engineering. From the exquisite hotel foyer to the super fast lift everything is just perfect .the veiw will amaze you. you have a 360 weir point it’s as good as flying . It cost 23 dollars but well worth the experience. We also went a floor higher for lunch
,,Great views,5.0,,"A definate must when visiting the Marina Sands Hotel, which is equal to a Las Vegas Hotel. Great views, not for the faint hearted"
,,"Iconic, fantastic views and warm water",5.0,,"The skypark is only accessible to hotel guests so I suggest you book at least 1 night stay there to enjoy an unforgettable experience. The main pool is divided into 3 plus there is a separate kids paddling area and separate spas which look out over the supertrees. The views are fantastic! I don't think that the promotional photos do it justice. The 2 things I didn't like were the expensive drink prices - S$24 for a glass of wine +service charge and tip and the amount of people taking constant selfies. Seriously, half the people were pouting, looking at their phones rather than the wonderful view of Singapore city."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Wow what can I say. 57 floors up & a 360 degree view like no other. Restaurants & infinity pool too if you are a guest you can use the pool.
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,"We stayed there for about 2 hours, the place was quite crowded, but there were still places for us to sit down and enjoy the view. We went before sunset so we could get a good view of the city during the day and at night. It's also very windy there, so beware, you might want to bring a jacket in case it gets chilly."
,,What a view !,5.0,,"We stayed in the hotel and entrance was included (otherwise very expensive). We visited during the day and after dark and both experiences was great. Having acrophobia I had to be brave and it was quiet a scary expereince. Once I got the feel it became better and the tremendous views of Singapore made up for my fear. This must really be the best spot to take pictures of the city, harbour area and Gardens at the Bay. Can be a bit crowded just before sunset."
,,Twilight views of Singapore,3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands was on our ""must do"" list, however we were a bit disappointed once we were on the observation deck. Yes there are wonderful views however it was extremely busy at twilight, so pick your time to visit."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"Paid S$20 each to go to the lounge bar on floor 57, but this allowed us to have the 20 dollars each towards a cocktail. The views are breathtaking and well worth going up there for."
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"Really a must See in Singapore! This is sooo cool! We stayed one night at the hotel, so i dont know How much it cost to just go up to have a look! Amazing hotel!"
,,Good view of Singapore from rooftop...,3.0,,"The park entrance had a ferrari, rolls royce parked specially for the photo shoots. We had clicked a couple of snaps as it is rare to even site these in Indian roads. We had to step into the road side basement entrance to gain our entry to the skypark. First hand experience...we were asked to stand in line for a photo shoot which will be edited with a background of skypark later and be available for you to purchase at the skypark deck. Well the charges were ranging from $40. Important advise, this photo can be clicked from by you from the opposite park or from the Merlion statue area at no cost !!. The high speed elevators take you to straight to the 56th floor and from here you can view the singapore city, ships, skyscrapers..There is a restaurant on top and we do not have access to go beyond. If you are hotel resident, you will have access to the swimming pool at deck. If you are planning Marina sky park do not go for the Singapore flyer. Well the view is the same !!. It was amazing to learn the entire building was built in a reclaimed land from the ocean. Also, the building houses a huge mall and has a metro station in the basement."
,,View for Miles,4.0,,We stayed at the hotel so the admission to the Skypark was included in our hotel price. Could visit as many times as we wanted which was great. The view from the top is amazing with both city views and garden views. If you are visiting Singapore its a must see attraction. Is it worth $20 dollars?? you decide.
,,Just wow...,4.0,,"After watching the light show, we walked all the way from Garden by bay and went through this amazing Skypark. We had the chance to see the view of the Marina Bay at night and it was just breathtaking. We missed the light show by the bay but just walking through this Skypark was just amazing."
,,Wonderful view,4.0,,The view from this masterpiece is obviously something which will leave any one spell bound but for the price there is very little to offer anything else except the kiosk on the observation desk . Maybe access to at least the restaurant shd be allowed. You have the skyline of Singapore on one side and on the other the vast expanse of the Garden by the Bay and the sea.
,,Feast for eyes,5.0,,A hotel three towered and on top of it a horizontal structure which is having several trees plants and restaurants. A real feast for eyes. Although we did not go inside but it is definitely looks great.
,,Magnificent Structure,5.0,,"I didn’t actually stay here, but was able to tour the hotel/casino pretty extensively before and after dinner at the rooftop Lavo restaurant. It’s an absolute marvel of architecture and should be considered a “must see” during any visit to Singapore."
,,Drinks are a bit overpriced,4.0,,Attended while on a quick stop over. Bought the voucher option to attend the pool deck which includes $20 worth of vouchers but be warned: the costs on the menu for drinks do not include a service charge. The drinks seem a bit weak.
,,Absolute Rip off!!,1.0,,"Very expensive rip off! You would be better off going on the Singapore Fly (still a rip off) but at least you get a bit of a ride and commentary. Granted the view from Marina Bay is awesome but way overpriced like everyrhing in Singapore.
We were here off peak, I would hate to see it busy as you would not get a clear photo. As you enter they insist on taking a photo by greenscreen so you can be ripped off more when you leave by getting sucked into buying an unwanted or requested photo (I was not allowed to refuse them taking a photo prior to entry).
Not recommended! !"
,,The Sky bar,5.0,,"Amazing views of the city! It costs 20 S$ but you can redeem this at the top for a drink or some food, well worth the visit, spectacular views of the city in all directions!"
,,Brilliant view,4.0,,"Fantastic view of Singapore and the bay from the Skypark, especially at sunset. It is however quite expensive eating or drinking there and rather crowded, although I think they do restrict the numbers going up, but I suppose one pays for the view. Perhaps it was also because we were there on the night Kim Jong Un also visited!"
,,rooftop view,4.0,,"nice place, you pay to go up but you get to get a drink, in the night time if you dont book then they dont allow you to enter a particular area, can get very busy, found service better in the after noon but during late evening to night time the customer service was not great at all."
,,Don't waste your money,2.0,,"I lucked out and the lady at the Skypark told me that if I wanted to see the hotel pool that i could go to the Ce La Vie lounge. The lounge was free, had amazing views of the city (better than the skypark's small area).-- I will note that to go to the Ce La Vie bar there was a dress code; something about smart casual and closed toe shoes for men. After I went to the lounge, I walked over the bar and no one even said anything, but if you indicated you wanted to go to the bar downstairs at the elevator, they looked everyone over. Anyways, I also asked a staff member where I could see the super trees, she showed me that if I went to the right after you get off the elevators on the 57th floor, that there is a little spot to look out right before the hotel guests check in for the pool. It was fabulous! There was one other person there, so I got good pictures and it was FREE. So, don't waste your money on the Skypark."
,,Great view but limited areas to visit,4.0,,"We visited the Skypark on a recent cruise call to Singapore. The views from the top of the hotel are fantastic in every direction but we were limited to just a few areas to visit. None of the bars were open, just a small kiosk selling drinks and snacks (it was early morning). We paid HK$20"
,,Fantastic view of Singapore!,5.0,,"From the top of Marina Bay Sands you can see the Singapore Harbour, the Gardens by the Bay domes and Supertrees (lit up by night), the Marina and the F1 circuit. It costs $25 to get in-now here’s your top locals tip...don’t pay this! Instead go up to the bar at Ce La Vie and pay $25 for a cocktail-a pricey drink I know but the view comes free"
,,Wonderful night lights,4.0,,We paid our $20 which was refundable as a cocktail on the top floor and headed up. The views were amazing. Cocktails good. Disc jockey pumping...lots of beautiful people. We could look across to the hotel pool (guests only)
,,Stunning views,5.0,,An amazing experience! A little oasis nests at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. The views are unbelievable.
,,An amazing night time experience!,5.0,,"We arrived in the dark at Tower Three - paid our $20 - to get the elevator to the very top level. The views over the city, harbour and marina were incredible - the place was alive with excitement, music and people! Another $7 saw us with a cocktail and we just wandered and marvelled. Guests of the hotel out on the outer lower front deck and in the crazy infinity pool. Had the best seat in town for the water and light show. A very definite 'must do / see'!!"
,,"Gorgeous, beautiful view but WOW what an expensive experience",4.0,,"Spargo's is free to visit, the Night Club Bar/Restaurant costs $20 just to go up and look. Mind you Spargo's along with everything here is incredibly expensive. 1 wine 1 beer and 4 very small burger sliders was yummy but $84! You can only get to part of the area where the hotel guest can swim and it looks awesome. Hopefully plenty of chorine is used!! View is doubtably outstanding and it's a must to see and view but take plenty of cash/credit cards cause you'll need it if you want to hang around."
,,Great view but expensive,3.0,,"You'll get great view from up there, but unless you are already the hotel guest at MBS, you've got to pay S$20 (maybe more) just to get up there.
There is a cheaper option to get a vantage point view from the Pinnacle@Duxton, just make sure you check with them first because the number of visitors per day is limited."
,,Standout Complex in great location with 5 star restaurants,5.0,,The views from the rooms over the harbor are breathtaking to see all the vessels. Restaurants variety and quality are first class. Pool complex one of a kind and direct access into the gardens which are a must visit. Staff very helpful
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,We visited SkyPark first time when we stayed at Marina Bay Sand. Beautiful hotel and facilities. The view is excellent and the restaurants/bar up there are good places to hang out
,,Wow amazing,5.0,,Oh my god it's really amazing place. We will come back. We really enjoyed with my family members. We saw the water lighting show. It's really nice.
,,MBS!!!,3.0,,A perfect area to take a close up picture with MBS and some other attractions such as Gardens by the bay.
,,Business Visit,5.0,,It's one of those places one should visit if you find yourself in Singapore. It offers a full 360 view of the city
,,Ultimate Views,5.0,,We had the best the views was totally amazing seeing everything around. The harbour with all the different vessels then the other side. Well worth going .
,,Must visit place,5.0,,This skypark is located on 60th floor of marina Bay from where you can have a look at entire Singapore. The view from Skypark is breathtaking
,,Beautiful views,3.0,,"If you don't mind spending a bit extra then you definitely need to have something to eat or drink in the restaurant on top of the Skypark. The views are spectacular, but sorry to say, the food & drinks are overpriced (you obviously pay for the location) and the staff are very fake and ""plastic"" - like they only work for tips and only give good service to those who will tip well. I'm glad I went to be able to say ""I have been there""."
,,Breath taking view,4.0,,"Visit this skypark for breath taking views of Singapore. Prefer the skypark over the Singapore flyer. You can click some awesome photographs here. I purchased the tickets in klook and redeemed it in Marina Square shopping mall.
Note that , the infinity pool is available only for the hotel guests."
,,Views!!,4.0,,"We went to the sky park late one afternoon and waited for sunset. We paid $23 each, had the obligatory photo taken by Skypark staff who then want you to purchase photos and a snow globe ( fairly sure it never snows in Singapore) for $80. No Thankyou. The views are amazing- city one side and the bay on the other. We managed to take beautiful sunset shots through the glass."
,,Great view,4.0,,I paid for the observation deck during the day. The view is spectacular—-across the bay to Indonesia & north to Malaysia. The number of freighters anchored in the bay is amazing! Great city views as well.
,,Scenic Tourist Attraction,4.0,,"The top floor of Marina Bay Sands sits above the theee towers and offers a panoramic view, although not the full 360 degrees. The ticket to the top does not allow us to visit the infinity pool where only hotel guests can enter. Nevertheless, we could see quite a bit of Singapore from the deck where we stood. It would be nice if more landmarks were identified in the maps. I’ve been there with visiting friends both at night and in the afternoon. The afternoon view allowed us to see more, while the night view is more romantic with the city lights.

I was happily surprised when the cashier gave me a 15% discount for my ticket for using my Citibank card."
,,Magnificent view,4.0,,"With its infinity pool, a cool bar and spectacular view...one can only say WOW! This is certainly a place to see when visiting Singapore."
,,Bar is better value,3.0,,"Instead of paying Aus$23 to go to the skypark, go to the foyer pay Aus$20 to go up to the bar. You will receive $20 credit to be used on a drink. Same view and you can sit down and enjoy a drink."
,,"Beautiful, Lots of Choices, Friendly Staff",5.0,,The Marina Bay sands is a work of art in its construction and the amenities within. Excellent service whether for hotel stay or for restaurant guests. Passers by will also enjoy the sculpture and paintings carefully selected to decorate its hallways and rooms.
,,A High Building with a Pool & Bar,3.0,,"You hear so much about Marina Sands that we were itching to get up there to see what all the fuss was about. We paid $23 each but that also gave us $20 credit at the bars at the top so cost was very good till you realise that one beer is $20 odd.
The staff are regiment in their ways, we asked politely why we could not go to the viewing area, only to be rudely told it was for PAYING guests. Well, I did pay to get up there!
Shad is a problem at the top, we ended up sitting inside one of the bar area's. We were planning on staying up there for a few hours, but after an hour, it got unbearable so we called it a day.

The pool is a nice feature, but again, its nothing special except some of the guests who think they are special cause they are allowed in and the general public are not."
,,Views require preparation in advance,4.0,,"Going up to the rooftop is either via restaurant pre-reservations or advance payment to be used in restaurant/bars or a fee for the observation deck area. Depending on which, the views are different."
,,Had greater expectations!,3.0,,"We went to Skypark on a hot day and the view on all sides of the deck was excellent; that is, the city on one side and the bay on the other; there were at least 60 ships waiting to unload their cargo. However, we were not allowed into the roof gardens which was reserved ""for hotel guests only."" The last time we were in Singapore, the payment to view included the gardens; that was disappointing as it would have been nice to enjoy a coffee and take in the view. The deck has absolutely no shade so, because of the intense heat up there, we cut short our visit."
,,"Over rated, over priced",1.0,,"Staff were regimental in herding customers into the lifts. The high speed lift reached the 57th floor in no time. A night view of Singapore island, that's it! A pint of Stella at £11.75, a glass of pinot grigio £15.30. Several bouncers kept a vigil on all the customers. A dj played loud insignificant music. An over hyped tourist destination not worth the entrance fees."
,,Incredible Views,5.0,,"It is the only way to see Singapore from up high...WOW...stunning. I am sure it would be lovely during the day but we went at night and it was amazing. Another attraction you would not want to miss if you visit Singapore, worth every cent."
,,"The Best Experience,",5.0,,We were totally thrilled and overwhelmed with our experience at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. There can hardly be a better view anywhere in the world. This is an unmissable experience.
,,The Sands Hotel.,5.0,,"Took our breath away at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. The view is spectacular, and the shopping there was amazing."
,,Magnificent Views,5.0,,"Visitors not staying at the hotel can buy tickets to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, which offers you unobstructed 360-degree views of the Singapore skyline. Giant observation deck
This gravity-defying platform is one of the largest in the world. The 1.2-hectare SkyPark stretches longer than the Eiffel Tower laid down and is large enough to park four and a half A380 Jumbo Jets.

It houses a ticketed observation deck, lush gardens, top-notch restaurants and an exclusive, infinity-edge swimming pool with a legendary view.

The 150-metre pool, the world’s largest elevated body of water outdoors, has been designed with a vanishing edge. It is as if there is nothing between the swimmer and the skyscrapers in front."
,,Spectacular Views,4.0,,"The 360 degree views of the harbour, business centre, Flyer and Marina, from the viewing platform which were spectacular even on a cloudy day."
,,Sky view must see,5.0,,We took a tour of this amazing location overlooking Bay of Gardens Although your limited to one end of viewing deck unless your a hotel guest this is the most amazing view you will find in Singapore It is worth the $25 entry fee
,,Most magnificent view of Singapore,5.0,,We went up at 4.30ish. Cost $30 which can be cashed in for food or drink. Place was crowded but we managed to get a table close to edge. The view over Singapore is spectacular especially as sun sets. Photographers dream!!! Noisy busy bar and drinks are expensive. Singapore at night is also stunning. Light show was at 8.Highly recommended to go to this spot
,,Absolutely stunning!,5.0,,I stayed at the Marina Bay Hotel for 8 days so I had unlimited access to the Skypark and pool area. The view is amazing. You can see all over Singapore from up there. The Infinity pool is 52 stories up in the air. Great for swimming laps. The amenities are first class with great service and restaurants. Wear lots of sunscreen!
,,Magnificient,5.0,,"It was really a structure that Singapore can boost to the world, a symbol of happiness, prosperity and competitiveness."
,,Worth A Visit,5.0,,Visit to sky park is worth a visit. You reach ground floor to 56th Floor in 36 seconds. The view over Singapore is stunning. It’s 23 Singapore dollars to do it. But for the views alone it’s worth it.
,,Far and wide,3.0,,A good view of Singapore you can see for miles and get good over view of the city they take a photo of you on a green screen then photo shop it 80 dollars not worth it just take pictures yourself
,,Night time views,4.0,,The view of an evening is just beautiful on a clear night. The lights over the city and Gardens By The Bay are amazing.
,,Spectacular view of the skyline,5.0,,"Went on Sunday evening. Huge queues and wasted a lot of time. The Observation deck has fast elevators.Finally, the view was spectacular especially the Gardens by the Bay. which was unique. Price of entry, food, photo etc was high. However, the experience is worth it."
,,Great view but crowded and stressful!,3.0,,"We went up the Skypark one evening, hoping for a good view and a nice drink. We knew it was popular, and the drinks would be overpriced, but thought it'd be worth it. Well, I'm not sure if they monitor the number of people going up there, but it felt pretty crowded, with people constantly jostling for tables/seats and to see the view. I personally would have preferred to enjoy my drink without people constantly hovering next to us waiting for us to leave so they could take our table..! The other disappointment was that they didn't tell us downstairs when we booked out ticket that there was a dress code, so we were only allowed into part of the area as my husband's top was counted as ""sleeveless"" - this lead to a slightly embarassing moment when we tried to enter the bar and were told we couldn't. Perhaps that kind of info would be good before you paid the entrance fee and went up to the top? Anyway, it of course is the best view of Singapore, so kind of a must-do, but don't expect it to be a relaxing drink, at least in our experience!"
,,Holiday,5.0,,Amazing views we went during the day and night and the day is better. Can see more and nice to have lunch up there.
,,Awesome experience of viewing the city from Skypark,5.0,,"Had an awesome experience on Skypark which gives a perfect view of Garden by the bay, Merlion and light show at night."
,,Singapore by the night,4.0,,"Having done the flyer during the day, we did the sky park at night for some glitter and lights. It has a separate entrance with a speed lift going directly up to 56 th floor. A semicircular wooden plank having glasses all around, also accessible is the restaurant located a floor above. Overall a different experience considering it’s Marina Bay Sands after all."
,,Last Night in Singapore!,5.0,,My family spent our last night here in Singapore! Wow what a experience well worth it! The views were amazing!
,,Creative architecture,5.0,,You will pay an admission but every cent is worth when you arrive on the 57th floor. Come near sun set to make your memory an unforgettable one.
,,Go to top to get a glimps of Singapore,5.0,,"MBS is the most visited and happening place in Singapore these days. The skypark view point is at 56th Floor and has a ticketed entry around 23$. But its worth visiting as the views are spectacular. If you visit this then Singapore Flayer can be skipped.
Go and Enjoy.."
,,Incredible views!,4.0,,"Definitely recommend going to the observation deck and seeing the incredible view of the city. Amazing views. The part that lets this down is the hard selling of souvenir photos that are set up (photos with a green screen and then they use a computer to put the full view in the background) before you even get into the lift. Once you get to the top they have already printed in out and it’s on key rings, snow globes etc etc. it was a bit too much. But I guess they are trying to make money..."
,,We ❤️ SG,5.0,,SG is really a top destination and I’m glad that I was here with my family... a very modern and unique megastructure.... it was so clean and everything is organized you won’t get lost... The future is here... If you drop by SG it’s a must that you should be here✈️
,,Sunset with an Amazing View of the City,5.0,,"Located on 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands. The entry was paid, I was there on weekdays so there was no rush at that time. I had visited in Feb2018. The view from the top was amazing. There was a Resto Bar located on the top for dining. The entry was restricted to the sky park only. The winds were speedy and the crowd was amazing with lots of Indian people. My overall experience was amazing."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,"We visited the Skypark in the late evening so it was quiet and there were no lines to get up, I would recommend doing this. The view at night is fascinating with all the lights and the Skypark is impressive."
,,Just beautiful and what a view!,5.0,,"We visited Marina Bay Sands Skypark on our last night in Singapore. And it was well worth it. We paid $20aud per person to go up to the Bar, Cest La Vie (no dress code) -each ticket can be used as credit towards purchases at the bar.

Upon arrival we managed to secure somewhere to sit, definitely do this first as it gets very busy and you might be left standing up for a while otherwise.

Look, it was very busy and filled with tourists of course but we had such a great time hanging out up on top of the city and got to have a few cocktails and snacks whilst watching the sun go down, the city go dark and the city lights slowly come on for the night. Very relaxing and a nice night our for us as a couple. Definitely recommend visiting if you go to Singapore.

There was free wifi,available but there were too many people to actually be able to use it properly.

Next time we will aim to stay at Marina Bay Sands in order to be able to access the pool :P."
,,sublime architecture and interior design,4.0,,"Unique building and the hotel/Casino and shopping malll inside is also eye-catching with luxury shops, restaurants, food court etc. and an interior canal for a boat ride attraction like at the Venetian in Macau, they call it the Sanpan ride in Singapore"
,,Party in the Sky,5.0,,"Great place to visit during a layover. A parkland of bars, eateries music and more, surrounded by spectacular views of the harbor from 57 stories up."
,,Take in the view,5.0,,"Take the lift to the bar at the top of the towers where you will get an incredible view of not only the bay which will be full of ships waiting to come into port but brilliant views of the Gardens by the bay, the Singapore Flyer, the F1 racing track and Singapore city. Note there is a small charge to go to the top but you wont be disappointed"
,,Nice View Point .,5.0,,We have to Spend some money to go up Skypark .Inside Hotel . Top View is Amazing .u can see whole Singapore
,,What a view from the top,5.0,,The $22 cost to the top is worth every cent. The views of Singapore are out of this world. The lift is quick. There are no negatives. Its a must for all visitors.
,,Blown away...,5.0,,"My wife and I had two days in Singapore and we were really glad that we paid just over 100 dollars for two tickets to the Skypark and the Gardens By The Bay.

The Skypark is on the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Just visiting the hotel was interesting in itself, as it well deserves the label of one of the world’s greatest hotels. The sweeping design of the three towers topped with a connecting deck/wing is an inspired design but at around 800 dollars per night for one of the cheapest rooms, this was beyond my means.

You access the Skypark deck via a separate entrance and after the obligatory photo, you take an express lift to the platform itself. It is all very well organised but I can imagine that there could be long queues on really busy days. Stepping out onto the deck makes it all worthwhile, with magnificent views of the sweeping coastline on one side and the dramatic cityscape on the other.

The deck itself gives an unobstructed view on three sides and has been designed with sufficient space for the busiest of days. Clearly, you have to choose the right day for a visit but the views are breath taking and well worth the ticket price. There is a small kiosk selling drinks and ice cream but there were few takers amongst the viewers, who were all captivated by the magnificent views.

Highly recommended and a must see attraction."
,,What a view!,5.0,,The views across Marina Bay and the centre of Singapore are fantastic. You look down on the Singapore Flyer and Grand Prix buildings and gaze longingly at the infinity pool that only hotel guests have access too. The cafe is a bit pricy but I suppose you expect West End prices to coin a Londoners phrase.
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views of the city. Well worth a trip to the Marina Bay skypark. One of the must do things in Singapore.
,,EXPERIENCE,3.0,,I stayed at the carlton hotel in singapore but when I went for MARINA BAY SANDS SKYPARK they charged 100 SGD for going to the roof top as a ticket but we were not allowed to use the pool only the restaurent i will that it is not a value for money option its better you go for a tour in the JURONG BIRD PARK.
,,Best views of the city,3.0,,"We visited here on our honeymoon. Access to the observation deck was quick and easy. They take a photo of you with the green board at your back before you enter the lift. Once you get up top they hassle you to buy a photo in a folder with a pic of the MBS for $80. Way over priced. Then we had a look outside, Great views. No where to sit though to enjoy the view. The cafe/gift shop was tacky and the gifts overpriced.. we went back in to go down the lift and was hassled again to buy our photograph.. this didn't impress us. There is a gift cart at the bottom lobby area. We bought a couple of things and days later found the same gifts at less than half price in shops on Orchard Road."
,,Great Viewpoint,4.0,,"This is a great way to see the city, although I think the admission fee is a bit pricey as I believe you can also visit one of the rooftop bars without paying admission. Nonetheless, a great way to see Gardens by the Bay from above and a great way to see the light show on the marina at night from a different angle. There is also a kiosk selling snacks and drinks."
,,Nice place to chill out,5.0,,"I was on a very short trip to Singapore and got the chance to visit River Front Bay Area during the evening for having dinner at Palm beach restaurant (highly recommended for Chilly Crabs)
Later the night i visited the SKY PARK at Marina Bay and it offered me spectacular views of the entire skyline of Singapore. Great music, drinks n some nice environment."
,,Picturesque,3.0,,Architectural marvel. Well designed and beautiful to look at. Well complemented by the Gardens nearby.
,,Wonderful Visit,5.0,,"I was part of a tour group, but left to do and see what we wanted here, what a spectacular place indeed.
Inside is the most amazing place, with accomodation,Casino and shopping precinct all in one.
After walking through this facility, I then headed to the lookout above, all 56 floors in 40seconds!
The most delightful, spectacular views of Singapore, the bay, everything.....
I went at night, so watched the laser light show also, the aqueduct below is incredible.
This is a MUST visit when in Singapore, you won’t regret."
,,Above all!,5.0,,"It is nice to be there at least once when your are in Singapore. Nothing special but amazing view of Garden Bay the Bay view and downtown area.
When you get there, grab a drink and enjoy the rest of your night with live band (some time)."
,,Unique and amazing position in the sky,5.0,,"If you travel to Singapore then a stay at the Marina Sands is a must, but if it’s out of your budget, then a visit to the Skypark is well worth the fee.

The amazing skyline and vantage point will take your breath away so gd prepares for a spectacular view..... and after your visit when you return to the footpath, look up and Marcel at the feat of engineering that held you up in the heavens."
,,Relax with the lights and the moon,5.0,,A Great Place to unwind while on trip to Singapore. The plethora of lights and the well lit sky scalpers that make the singapore skyline is a great feast to the eyes.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This building is awesome, once at the top you can see some amazing views overlooking Singapore. At night you can see the fireworks show, so worth going just before sunset to see both day and night view. Would also recommend going to the CeLaVia restaurant up there too. Book first though."
,,Sun glare in afternoon. Consider other times,4.0,,View is well worth the $23 (redeemable on the expensive drinks). A lot of heat and glare on the west side bar but the north west bar area was much better. I would have liked to go in the morning to look at the spectacular city view with the sun behind you or after dusk to see the lights of Gardens by the Bay
,,UNBELIEVABLE VIEW ON SINGAPORE FROM THE 57TH FLOOR OF MARINA BAY SANDS HOTEL.,5.0,,"During a 8 nights stay in Singapore, I slept 6 nights in Marina Bay Sands Hotel and 2 nights in Mandarin Oriental Hotel. As hotel guest, I had full access to the Skypark and I did not hesitate to visit it ! The view is of course awesome on Singapore and should not be missed for any reason once in Singapore, even if you are not client inside the hotel. It's like to be in the front of a huge boat, flying into the sky...
I will soon add some photos to my review, for you to see what I'm talking about as 1 photo worths 1'000 words !

otterboris"
,,Great views of the city,5.0,,A must do! Enjoyed great and panoramic views of the city. Excellent in the evening before 9pm to catch the lights display at the gardens below.
,,Wow!,5.0,,It was amazing to see the Marina Bay Sands hotel up close. The skypark is well worth the visit for the fantastic views of Singapore.
,,You won't get a better view of Singapore,4.0,,After a bit of a convoluted walk around the base of the hotel we finally found the lift to take us up 57 floors to the rooftop bar. The view is truly exceptional and the bar has a great vibe around it at night. The viewing platform sits just below the bar area but as far as I could ascertain you have to be a hotel resident to access it. I don't think we missed out as there was no bar there!
,,Grand View of Singapore from the viewing Gallery,5.0,,It is a must do. It will take about an hour's time but definitely worth the visit. you get a 360 degrees view of Singapore. It is adjacent to Gardens By The Bay.
,,Best view on the city.,4.0,,"Picturesque view on the singapore, but i would recommed to go on the 57 floor in bar, for same money you will got a drink🙃"
,,Holidays,5.0,,An Icon landmark of Singapore. What a view from up there at 56 stories high. Breath taking sight and sound from up there.
,,Excellent,5.0,,We went just as the sun was going down so treated to the city lights as they came on. There’s nowhere to sit at the top which probably keeps the crowd moving. Afterwards we saw the light show from the Events Plaza on the first level.
,,Top of the city,4.0,,"I haven't been into the hotel though it looks extravagant. The mall downstairs is painfully expensive a chique. The waterfront is classic. The top is beautiful and you get to see the Singapore downtown view. No much of activity at the top unless you are welling to pay an insanly high price for waterpool entrance or cafe service. Otherwise, get up, have a nice view and photo and get down soon."
,,Great restaurants and Infinity Pool with amazing view!,5.0,,"The Skypark consists of several attractions - fine dining restaurants, observation deck and - last but not least - amazing Infinity Pool (accessible only for hotel guests). Highly recommended!"
,,If You can afford to Saturday here...,5.0,,"We couldn’t afford to stay there this time but we went up t9 the observation deck and it was amazing, the restaurants look amazing, but it’s bestto book in advance always seems to be full. Again the light show at 8Pm is awesome."
,,Get voucher to go to the bar,5.0,,"You can pay for a $20 voucher to go to the rooftop bar, it only pay for about one drink, but at least you get a drink and not just pay to stand up there. One of the beat views of Singapore."
,,Must visit place in singapore,5.0,,"We used the entrance ticket and used the bar area on roof top. You can walk along the pool area as well from this ticket but cannot ho to the observation deck. However the bar gets really crowded and ppl are somewhat competing to get a seat or a spot in the corner so can see the view well. After lingering for some time we got a perfect plce.

I would recomend you to go straight to the observation deck if you want to see the view and walk about as the bar limits the view andmakes it a struggle to see an undisturbed view from people."
,,Views,4.0,,"The high sun during the day and the tendency for haze makes the view a bit dull which is why we went back at sunset. If you are going to visit the SkyPark this is the best time of day but it is also the busiest so give yourself time to get tickets. The $20 price is very reasonable and now includes access to the northern garden and Sky Pool.

If you are lucky with the weather the views are stunning but are not that much better than any of the other hotel viewing balconies although these are only available to guests.

Ironically the architecture of the Sands hotel is now the main focal point for the city viewpoints which means that every other location has a better view because the sky park is the only place in Singapore where you can’t view the Sands Hotel."
,,Swim with a view,5.0,,"If you stay at Marina Bay Sands you can access the Skypark and go for a swim. This has to be the best swim for a view anywhere. The infinity pool looks out over Singapore from the 57th floor and is fabulous. There are three pools, one for adults only plus a child’s pool. They do get crowded and noisy but there also plenty of loungers and a good towel supply. A must if you stay at Marina Bay Sands."
,,Amazing View!,5.0,,"Fantastic view from the sky deck. we visited there evening and had to wait around hour in the queue, But its really worth for the 360 degrees view of the whole Singapore."
,,Amazing View,4.0,,The Sky park gives a good view of the whole Singapore must try if you coming to Singapore. Amazing place to visit just loved it.
,,Wonderful View,4.0,,"Fantastic view from the SkyPark. Unfortunately, there is no access to the famous pool as only for their in-house guests. Full of people in the evening when we visited."
,,360 Degrees of Photo opportunity.,5.0,,"If you want a birds eye view of all of Singapore City then this is the place to go.
Located on the 57th Level of the hotel.The views are just wonderful,20 dollars Singapore for the lift to the top and large viewing ares to take the once in a life time photo."
,,Outstanding views,5.0,,"Arrived quite early before the queues, and on a clear day. The views were spectacular. Wished I could've jumped in that pool. The Singapore Sling at Ce la Ve was worth every penny."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Difficult to take your eyes off this architectural masterpiece. The Skypark offers stupendous views of the bay, river beyond and the city. The famous infinity pool can be seen at certain angles from the top but is only open to hotel guests. Best time to go is early evening to achieve views in the last of the daylight then into sunset. A must."
,,Meh,3.0,,"It’s an open deck on a tall building. While the view may be good (weather permitting) it really isn’t worth the entrance fee to just go up there, it would make much more sense to patronise the cafe or bar."
,,Great welcome to Singapore,4.0,,"One of the iconic views in Singapore. The scallops and oysters ceviche will given many Peruvian chefs a head turn ...it was outstanding. Being Australia we had to try the Plum Pavolova ... the shebert was a refreshing surprise with the crunch. But without a doubt, these guys do service well; Han was attentive and knowledgeable - a delight. Paul kept us entertained with his local knowledge and cheeky humour. Great first night in Singapore."
,,Breathtaking view of CBD,5.0,,"One can have have a panoramic view of the city, a good place to take selfies, there is cafe where you can relax.Singapore Merlion is visible from this tower, recommended time to visit in the evening"
,,Amazing views - Go in the evenings,5.0,,"The Skypark offers some amazing views. And it is a great spot to see Singapore's evening traffic and the two light shows from a very different perspective. The tickets are on the expensive side, but still, something that's definitely worth visiting!"
,,Man made marvel,5.0,,"The views are spectacular. The cost is very high, unless you are a guest in the hotel. A must visit no matter what."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"We went up to the skypark at night after a busy day wandering the streets of Singapore!

Definitely would recommend going when it's dark as the view from the deck is phenomenal! The whole of marina bay glitters at night, & you don't have to worry about the heat as you get a little evening breeze!

There's a little shop there too which sells merch & slushies, plus cocktail slushies!
Which was a nice touch, so we could enjoy a Singapore sling on top of the marina bay sands!"
,,Amazing facility.,5.0,,Absolutely fantastic . The pool is the best thing about the hotel. I thought the service around pool was exceptional as there the bars and food etc. We actually loved our time there.
,,Wish I could have had lunch here,4.0,,The observation deck is free when you eat at the restaurant...I was just too early. Words cannot explain how massive this place is. Need about 15 mins if you are there during the day. I went at 10 so there were no lines. Went to the food court at the marina shops afterwards.
,,Great to see,4.0,,This was great to go and see. The entry fee included a drink and could be used at either 2 of the bars up there. We went to the bar which is near the infinity pool and it had comfortable sofa/lounges right by the glass. Some of the fabric on the sofas could do with a revamp/clean.
,,An unmissabke view,5.0,,"We were looking to find something to do with our morning before joining our cruise ship after lunch and decided to take in the view from the skypark. We were so glad that we did. the view is wonderful, and made even better by us having spent the previous day walking round the city. From the viewing platform we were able to see those places and so much more."
,,Go just before SUNSET!!,5.0,,We went to sky park just before the sunset and the view was mesmerizing. We stayed there until sun slowly set. We stayed around to watch lights show from the top. We watched the light show of Gardens by the bay first and then the fron of marina bay sands. Also you get to see night view of Singapore. Worth it. If you go to bar you are not allowed in the sky park or on the edges but confined to the middle. Best to go to skypark.
,,360 degree,5.0,,The Marina bay sands skypark is one of the best places to visit in singapore. Its on 57th Floor of the hotel which gives you the best 360 degree view to check singapore. Try to avoid going in afternoon as its really hot and humid and especially if it’s raining then the sykpark will be closed so please make sure you visit accordingly. The ticket cost you approx SD 23 which i felt its really high.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing view of singapore, a must do experience when you visit. You can see almost everything and is great all lit up at night."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Better to visit late afternoon. Morning and early afternoon may be too hot and humid. Amazing place.
,,One of the must do;s,4.0,,"When in Singapore you can't help but see it and it's a must to go up to the observation platform on the 55 floor, its not cheap and you are fed through the in house photographers, on the way in, and the pictures are ready when you get to the top, but the prices were way over the top, the view is spectacular and when the evening light show is on a stunning view of the waterfront harbour and the light show in the Gardens"
,,Mbs,5.0,,Nice place for tourist owesome visit Celavi at 57 floor no need to pay entrance if you had restu reservation
,,Go for ce la vi,1.0,,"Do not take the skypark! Go for ce la vi as you get a voucher for the entrance fee and we are happy that not everybody knew about it so the hundreds of tourists took the line for the skypark.

When exiting the lift go left and you come to the area where you see the pool- ignore the staff that wants to send you to the right - pool view and photo only left side! Just be self confident.

Chicken sandwich is expensive but good. Actually you pay for the view.

Be there at 11am no waiting line and typically sun. Good luck!

If thousands read this...no worries I was there three times and enough selfies..."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"You need an entry ticket for this.
Amazing view of the city from the 57th floor.
The cold breeze and the view will make you forget everything and just glaze at the lights around. This open floor ends with thick glass wall so that you can enjoy the atmosphere without any worries even if you are with kids.
There is a restaurant with rocking music and a small shop where you can get softy, pop corn or other munchies while you enjoy the view."
,,Go do it this is a must do IMO,5.0,,OMG just go do it. The views are absolutely amazing. 56 stories high you have a 260 degree view of the Singapore skyline. We loved it! This has to be a jewel in the Singapore crown.
,,Best view in town!,4.0,,We went at night time so we could view the light show over the bay which in itself was spectacular. Such an amazing view from above over a beautiful city at night.
,,High high,5.0,,The view of Singapore from such height wow great experience and the light show of Garden by the Bay from above looks good
,,Best view in town!,5.0,,"Without a doubt, the best view of Singapore! If you're lucky enough to stay at the MBS, my tip would be to get there early - between 6 and 7am - that's the only time you'll be able to enjoy the view and the pool without all of the other hotel guests!"
,,Awesome place with killer view,4.0,,"There is good reason why this place is a must visit place for all travellers coming to Singapore. There are several ways to reach the Marina bay sands; but the best way is the MRT. It takes you directly to Marina bay sands. Other ways are bus and taxi as always. If you can afford to stay in this hotel; please do. Awesome service and experience luxury. The main attractions for this place is the infinity pool. The rules for pool usage keeps changing from time to time. I suggest call and check. But the swim in the pool is a must. Late afternoons would or early mornings are good times to be in the pool as the heat is not too much. Otherwise also it’s good as it’s quite windy so high up. One can sip cool beverages served in the cafe there. Advice: carry your swim wear to enjoy the pool. Rental swim wear is not available all the time.
The place has a killer shopping area for the Uber rich.
The place has a casino and is the other major attraction. For foreigners there is no entry fees. For locals an entry charge of 100 SGP is needed. Depending on how much you are willing to spend and how addicted to gambling are you; you can spend time there. I suggest entering there at the end of the visit else you will never get out of the casino.
I had never been to a casino before and I spent 3 hrs.
One can spend time on the slot machines if nothing else for the experience.
At the end of the day you can go to the food streets nearby for a nice evening drink by the bay. Enjoy"
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,"It’s 20 sgd to go up there and totally worth it! You can’t go to Singapore and not visit the observation deck! 360 views of Singapore and it’s wonderful! Great place to take lots of photos and take in the views of Singapore! It gets a bit busier towards sunset so head up around 5pm and get a drink from the bar, plenty of time to relax and take it all in!"
,,You will enjoy this,5.0,,The Bay Sands Skypark is the best place to have a 360^ view of Singapore. Easy to get by via the metro system. Bring camera.
,,Amazing place to view,4.0,,"Worth a visit just to walk around but very Vegas style and costly. Pick up tickets for Gardens By the Bay here or rent a Lamborghini for 15 minutes or Porsche not the cheapest way to spend 15 minutes. Hotel is a bit money money money and not a lot of soul or atmosphere, but whilst in Singapore you need to experience."
,,Picturesque!,4.0,,"Both Marina Bay Sands Skypark and Singapore Flyer offers entire City view. But if have a choice, select Sands Skypark Observation Deck View than Singapore Flyer. The very reason - this one is located on 56 level which is higher than the height of Singapore Flyer. If you chose both if money is not the problem.
Please look at weather forecast before you chose Sands Sky park as Singapore Flyer still works during moderate rains but Sands Sky park can be closed or you may not enjoy the city view during the rain."
,,Worth the visit.,5.0,,"Train to Bayfront MRT station and follow the signs to the ticket office at the northern end of Marina Bay Sands hotel. You are only permitted on the northern end of the Sky Park as the rest, the pool area and gardens, are reserved for hotel guests. The viewing platform is out in the open, so be prepared to get wet if it starts to rain. As with many attractions in Singapore, it is not cheap, however the views are worth the effort."
,,Bit of a con,2.0,,"1. You don't have access to the whole deck, about twenty percent at best
2. Not enough table and chairs
3. You pay twenty dollars per ticket which is refundable when you purchase food or drinks, good deal eh? No! Small beer and glass of wine costs over fifty dollars
4. You cannot see the light show very well unless have seat by edge. When seated at edge you cannot see the detail of the show or hear the music because of the height.
5. The most interesting part of the sky deck should be the cantilever part but this is closed off due to people commuting suicide
6. It's like herding cattle to get up there"
,,Niccccce,5.0,,"Iconic building of Singapore, connected to mall and great views from the top, btw pool on the roof top is only for the guests staying at the property."
,,what a lunch !!!,5.0,,"we decided to not wait in the lines for the observation deck but instead go for the free elevator up to the same deck but with just access to the restaurant which sits in the middle of the skylark. we were seated in a window seat and simply soaked up the view and the great ambiance of the bright and modern building. the menu was fairly straightforward and a little expensive, but eh-what a view, and the service was exceptional."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"This is the must-see attraction during your time in Singapore City.

It cost us 23 SGD each for a standard ticket to go up to floor fifty-six and experience amazing views across the Marina and overlooking the Central Business District. We enjoyed a refreshing beverage afterwards - the immediate bar by the observation deck is extraordinarily expensive, but worth it - and were happy to tick off this major landmark.

The hotel lit up at night is also absolutely spectacular."
,,Good view of city and gardens but not a mandatory visit.,3.0,,"You must pay to visit the top of this building which provides ordinary views in all directions. The supposed highlight is the evening view of the coloured lighting of the tower trees in the Gardens By The Bay, however the rooftop gets very crowded, the lighting display is short and only once on certain days and the lights display is not that impressive. Not recommended."
,,Awesome views of singapore,5.0,,Tickets purchased at klook.com. Got it almost 50%. Took the train to marina bay sands and then there are directions put helping to reach the sky park easily. Its takes literally less than 5 mins to reach the top floor. The first view you see are of the gardens by the bay and the Super Grove trees. and then the flyer to the right. Its crowded but if you wait for some time you can catch a good spot to take some awesome panoramic shots of the city. An awesome expericence
,,Amazing view and memorable experience,5.0,,"Was staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and therefore entitled to visit the Skypark or Hotel's observation deck on the 57th floor which offers panoramic city views & 2 upscale restaurants.
The view Is amazing and breath-taking. Could see the Gardens by the bay with a bird’s eye view. This is a photographer's paradise, usually during sun rise and sun set hours.
A must for every local & tourist to Singapore and will be a truly memorable experience."
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,The iconic MBS had made Singapore's skyline World famous. And nowhere is it best to be at the top of MBS to see for yourself why it has the iconic status. Even a caricature had Donald Trump swimming with Kim Jong Un at the edge of the swimming pool overlooking the Singapore skyline. It would be great if this actually happens on 12 June 2018.
,,Great Views,5.0,,"A must do if you want to get great views of Singapore. It was smokey when we were up there, but still great views. Drinks are expensive,that is the way it is in Singapore. Wonderful views of Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay basin, Singapore flyer. Just do it and enjoy."
,,Great Views,3.0,,"Although we did not stay at this hotel my husband and I had drinks at Sky park at top of hotel, the observation deck. Great views over Singapore, very expensive drinks.Very fast lifts to observation deck."
,,INFINITY POOL,5.0,,"THE highlight of marina is infinity pool . if u vist singapore stay for a day .the problem is checkin takes to much time. they give room at 2pm and chk out time is 11.am in the morning
THE mall attched to it is so huge that u will spend hrs there and
casino is excellent -entry for 18 yrs and above .passport is must .room we stayed was garden view which was excellent"
,,Amazing swimming pool and restaurants day and evening,5.0,,At the beginning of the spring it was very beautiful to walk around. The garden is nice and well taken care . It is very warm so it makes it difficult to stay out. But the beauty of flowers makes it worth.
,,Completely brilliant,5.0,,"Undeniable the best view one could wish to get of the Singapore CBD, The Palms and the Flower Domes from anywhere in Singapore. Simply awesome!"
,,View of entire singapore,5.0,,"You can see view of singapore, marina bay sands, singapore river, merlion, office building from best locations."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,I did not stay here but I visited the hotel and the top floor.the view is amazing from the top and recommended for everyone who visits Singapore. There is also a mall nearby and gardens by the bay nearby
,,A great attraction to start with when in Singapore,5.0,,"The observation deck on Level 56 is a great place to start your attraction journey. Apart from the majestic views of the marina area and of Singapore city, you can look at other attractions from a birds eye perspective, such as the Flyer and the Gardens by the bay, before you delve into them individually."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Nice concept to take a look at the entire city of Singapore that is rapidly changing over the years.Its paid though and people line up as if its a religious site.
,,busy place,5.0,,"observatory is good, shopping mall is really huge. fountain show is in the evening . 9pm is the last show"
,,Looks amazing from the ground espcially at night,5.0,,"For those who want to have amazing photos at night, you need to take some pictures at night from the ground where the sky-park tower is in the background. However, if you want to enjoy a birds-eye view over the bay and the whole city, you can buy the ticket to enjoy the view from the top at the sunrise."
,,You can miss this place! Just look for the “boat” on top of a hotel!,5.0,,This place is definitely on your must do list! The shops start on the opposite sid of the road but te hotel is also amazing. Take the lift up to the 57th floor on any of the three towers for incredible views. We chose tower two which has Spargos and also a great bar with fantastic snacks. The views over the city skyline are incredible and also over the oceans with hundreds of massive boats at anchor
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Any city you visit as a tourist you like to have a Bird's eye view of that city....... Singapore offers two observation sites.....The Singapore Flier and Sand Sky Park......The beauty of the latter is that it is higher than the former and is overlying Garden by the Bay.......Lovely view 360°
,,Amazing.,5.0,,We did not stay there - but did make a point of visiting. It is an amazing piece of architecture. We went to the rook top terrace of a ‘look see’ - which was worth it. The shops and facilities nearby are good. Highly recommended.
,,View from the top,4.0,,"Bar at top offers great views and exciting atmosphere, very trendy. The price of drinks will open your eyes, as well as the beautiful people that abound. Visit during the day, then come back at night, the view is astounding."
,,Great view but no pool unless you’re staying at the hotel,4.0,,The view from the top is excellent. Food and drinks are very expensive. You can pay to go to the observation deck which is literally just a deck with a view and nothing else. You can also go to the bar/restaurant at the top which also has a view. If you get the Marina sands club card you can go to the bar for free. It’s very warm at the top during the day and only guests can go in the pool.
,,Exclusive view on Singapur,5.0,,Expensive but worse any Singapur Dollar! I guess you won’t get a better view on Singapurs skyline. Keep in mind it can be very hot up there - wear something which covers you from the sun!
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Great view from the upper deck and whilst expensive it us worth sipping on a drink at the bar and savouring the experience
,,Height ! Beauty ! Vision !,5.0,,The sky park gives a panaromic view of Singapore ! A must do experience ! Worth a visit and picture shoot.
,,View is fantastic,5.0,,"The view, the lighting, the gush of water around it smells so good and romantic to stay around. Located in the midst of the city with all the necessary theme parks around it makes it the most visitable place in Singapore."
,,Mesmerizing view and great service,5.0,,Location of hotel is very good with the Picturesque view. Rooftop gives the complete view of the Singapore skyline and the city.
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,Perfect location to view the entire skyline landscape of Singapore. I visit regularly with my friends!
,,Wow! On top of a 57 story hotel,5.0,,The sky park on top of a semi attached 3building hotel with over a thousand rooms is an amazing feat. The mall at the bottom was unbelievable and our lunch on the top at Spago was terrific. Don’t miss this plCe
,,Fantastic view of the country,5.0,,"The view is amazing on a clear day. Situation at the central and south end of the country, we get to see almost the entire east coast and appreciating the long beaches. We saw the busy strait where hundreds of ships rest, explaining why Singapore...More"
,,Touristy but worth the view,4.0,,I wouldn't stay in these hotels because they are so touristy but it's worth the price of admission to take the elevator to the top and view Singapore.
,,Simply AMAZING! Worth the expense,5.0,,"Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands was expensive, but the infinity pool in the sky park made it worth every penny!! You simply have to do it!!"
,,Daytime visit,5.0,,Another must see in Singapore. Just drop in and go up to bar / restaurant. Costs about $20.00. You can access both sides of the building and have lunch by the amazing infinity pool. get great Dont bother going to observation deck - theres nothing...More
,,Lovely Views,5.0,,The MBS Skypark offers great views of the SG Skyline and on a clear night you can see Batam Island (Indonesia) from across the Gardens By The Bay.
,,A Ship in the Sky,5.0,,"This is high, and what a view to see and remember. Remember to check the dress code for the restaurant."
,,No way that I’m going to the outer edge of the SkyPark pool,5.0,,"WOW . . . Awesome architecture, iconic building, and great views. Awesome, stunning, panoramic views from the rooftop observation deck, 57 floors above the ground. Views are amazingly beautiful at night.

Even with the two-metre safety barrier, no way that I’m going to the outer edge of the SkyPark pool."
,,Stunning views from the Observatory,4.0,,"Expensive ride in the elevator to the Observatory, but the views are spectacular. Enjoy a drink at the SkyBar."
,,Amazing construction,5.0,,"An excellent hotel to stay , with option to walk to the gardens , enjoy the fantastic light- dancing water in marina at night , do some shopping in famous brands shops or just stay inside and swim viewing the Skyscrapers"
,,Except for its look from outside,2.0,,"Its just average, and nothing much to see except to say that you were at an iconic place. So be there but just dont spend too much time and more around to other places where you could spend your time valuable while on trip."
,,The view,4.0,,Hi he view is why this is a mid see. Be prepared for crowds and a quality of service/food to match. You come for the view. Worth the trip especially at night. We went 2x - drink service at bar could not cope with number of people do be prepared to wait 15min once you reach the bar to have your order taken. We also ate at the restaurant. 80% of what we ordered was nice food but sone dishes were average.
,,Massive resort,5.0,,"This place is a monstrosity. As we were being taken to our hotel, this was the first thing we saw. We did a night visit and went to the top for a look. 61 floors. There is a restaurant on the top floor."
,,On the best view point,5.0,,"This one of the renowned hotel in singapore , they have 3 towers. so Tower 3 is booked for the hotel guest from where they get the infinity pool view. Tower 1 is accessible and you have pay S$ 20 for enter and they view is simply amazing. they also have one of the famous bar in the top Named Ce li va"
,,Simply Breathtaking,5.0,,"If you are not a guest staying at the Marina Bay Sands, do invest in buying a ticket to go up to the Skypark and experience the fabulous views over the City as well as the Gardens by the Bay - a trip in the evenings to see the shows from the roof top is recommended."
,,Top class hotel in Singapore,5.0,,Marina bay sands is a landmark in Singapore. With all classy facility.the building itself is worth watching.and the top view is also amazing
,,Go at sunset,4.0,,"Buy a ticket for S$20 from 1st floor of hotel and then take lift to 57th floor. You can then redeem your ticket for a drink at the bar. The best time to be there is sunset , but it can be a bit crowded so maybe go a little earlier."
,,Worth less place,1.0,,"It is worth less place for money as well as for time , it is better to enjoy Flyer , adjoing Merlion is better place relaxing than to go sky park."
,,Skypark and Infinity Pool,5.0,,"Atop the 57th floor of the infamous MBS Hotel, the Infinity Pool, jacuzzi and the Skypark is a must-go and a must-try! One must be a checked-in guest to access these places.
I would recommend an early morning swim if u prefer to have fewer people or a late afternoon dip to catch the lovely sunset (see attached picture).
The jacuzzi was very relaxing, a great water therapy to your tired muscles.
The skypark provides an excellent view of Singapore and is a great place to take pictures for your IG, FB and even twitter if u prefer!"
,,A must visit,5.0,,"This is really an amazing experience, this is a landmark place in Singapore, if you haven't stayed here then you have not seen Singapore at all. It is the must see place."
,,Time for a game,5.0,,"The most beautiful part of Marina Bay Sand s is when you go during at night and you will see the lights around the area. It’s was perfect scene for a couples or a family to go for a visit there. Casino area was great, they offered water, coffee, tea and juices for the players.
It was a fun night."
,,Optimum Time To Visit Is Learnt,5.0,,"This a top-class hotel with prices to match, but the respect that was shown by staff to the guests who merely wanted to visit the Observation Deck / SkyPark and did not know the way up was also top-class. Access to the Skypark is access to only one end of the Deck on the top of this hotel. That wonderful swimming pool remains only as a glimpse from afar *sigh* The sights over Singapore are fabulous though. The staff selling the souvenir photos wonderful. The people watching of selfie-taking hilarious and the knowledge that being up here to see the skies when storm clouds are rolling in, the sun is setting or during the light shows at night .... that leads me to say I'll be back one day."
,,Evening view and drinks lovely,4.0,,"Stopped here for drinks and snacks with a small group, was a delightful evening no hassle not bother just had to sneak one guy in as he was wearing flipflops and this is not allowed someone told us but we had a great evening all the same"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Wow simply wow, the view from the top was out of this world the most picturesque landscape and water views ships buildings and the best sunset, you could see for miles and miles it was mind blowing certainly a place worth visiting when in Singapore.The drinks were pretty expensive but the view made it worth while, we met people from all nations such diversity. So want to take our children there next time."
,,WHAT AN EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"We were taken here by family who live in Singapore - lucky to have people to show us around who knew the place well. Food, atmosphere, people are all incredibly amazing as is the whole of Singapore. Visit don't hesitate you will love it....its like being on top of the world."
,,Highly Impressive Architectural feat !,5.0,,Wish I strike a 649 or lotto and I would book a month ( top floor ) at this place ! You get a feel once you walk-in! Magnificent lobby and a lift that brings you to top floor for an awe aspiring view of Singapore as a whole ! Skyline has changed since I last visited in 2007 ! Imagine building such a high structure and garden of Singapore on a reclaimed land ! 5* place
,,One of the landmarks is Singapore,4.0,,Its right on marina bay and ahead of gardens by the bay. Though couldn't visit the observation deck but will surely plan it on my next visit. The laser lights are amazing along with the fountain show at marina bay sands. The boat shaped observation desk is one of its kind. If you are in Singapore u gotta click a pic with it in the background.
,,Crowded but great view,3.0,,"Stayed at marina sands. The sky park was extremely busy and almost every lounge taken. They seemed to have no system to check that people weren’t leaving their towels on lounges/ seats all day. We had a great view from room on 39th floor toward city so chose to spend more time there than in the crowded energy of the sky park.
If you want the view, the infinity pool, the proximity to gardens on the bay and choose to be in a massive hotel, the crowds are all yours."
,,Rich Peoples Play ground,5.0,,All the top shelf stores there and the view fantastic but very expensive to stay. Elevator to room is so smooth and quick you don`t even know you are moving.
,,City that gives fun,4.0,,"Singapore - a rapidly developing city since Raffles set foot to this place formerly known as Temasik. From its historical place, it developed into a cosmopolitan city. We have the opportunity to visit Merlion Park and enjoy the evening atmosphere around the area. Unfortunately at the end of the day suddenly rain fell."
,,A MUST DO experience in Singapore,4.0,,Visited Marina Bay Sands and the Skybar. The views are incredible and cocktails on 57th floor are a must
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Great place with fantastic views over Singapore . $50 for 2 people to go to the top. Photographs taken at bottom before you go up are good quality but at $80 for 2 framed Pictures seemed expensive. Great place
,,Visit,5.0,,Went up to the skypark. Well worth the visit and cost of $25 per person. Amazing views of Singapore. Spent 40 mins looking across the city.
,,A true landmark,5.0,,"A true landmark that you need to visit in Singapore. Good design of the building, connected to garden by the bay. Can be very crowded with some rude tourists."
,,"Spectacular view, pricey breakfast buffet",5.0,,"I was staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, so admission was included in the room rate. Went up for breakfast, which was good, but pricey at over SG$50 including tax and tip."
,,Check the weather BUT a better alternative,5.0,,"The viewing platform is closed at the slightest hint of a change in the weather. It was drizzling with rain when we arrived only to find it was shut.
A better alternative is to buy the 20S$ ticket to the 57th floor bar. Great views of the city and Gardens by the bay, right next to the famous infinity swimming pool AND you trade your ticket against purchase of a drink or food from the bar !! Excellent deal.
Weather quickly changed to sunny skies but we were glad we made this choice."
,,Nice view and bar,5.0,,"The only minus point is too crowded, can't enjoy the view with piece. Not encorage ppl with acrophobia to go up."
,,Visit during the sunset,4.0,,Visit before the sunset to see both daytime and nighttime views of the city. You can also wait for the light show of gardens by the bay and view it from the top.
,,NOT TO MISS,5.0,,"Visiting Marina Bay Sands Hotel was must during our visit of Singapore. The Skypark gives you a wonderful view of the city, a great close up view of the amazing roof top infinity pool (for Hotel quests only) and of course a chance to sip a famous Singapore Sling. We took the elevator right to the bar `CÉ LA VIE``, and we were lucky enough to get a nice couch seating right next to the pool area. Great experience, nice break with a good drink even though a little expensive. Definetly a must do if in Singapore."
,,Never Again !!!,2.0,,"15 mins to get the ticket, 30 mins to reach the Skypark and then 55 mins to get down. The whole excitement of views were killed by the massive lines for the elevators to get down.Three elevators for thousands of visitors. Perhaps our mistake was to go there on a weekend, was quite forgettable."
,,Unique and Breathtaking,5.0,,50-some stries above the street with a panoramic view of Singapore and it's world class harbor from the open-air rooftop cabaret. Sipping on a cocktail and enjoying this one-of-a kind view is truly an unforgettable memory. So we had another cocktail.
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is at the top of this iconic hotel. I went on a real nice day and got some lovely photos of Singapore. Best time to go is about midday. Definitely worth a visit. 4/5
,,amazing views,4.0,,cool once your up there but nothing to encourage you to stay no seating no resturant or bar access for a drink bugger
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"Ok you get to see a view over Singapore but nowhere to sit! Notices say do not sit on the deck but if they provided some seats (not near the edge of the viewing platform but further back) it would be so nice to sit and just enjoy the space. We visited at dusk and it was lovely watching the view change, it was also a clear day/night so the view was good. Expensive just for the view so if you are short on funds/time choose this or the flyer, no need to do both."
,,Modern Marvel,3.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is at the top of this iconic hotel on 57th floor which gives you unobstructed view of Singapore skyline. It has famous infinity pool with 360 degree view. Be prepared for huge crowds.
,,Can not even see the infinity pool.,3.0,,Expensive (23SG$) to access only the front part of the “boat” and not even see the pool (I knew the use is reserved to hotel Guess). Nice view.
,,It's ok (bit like other similar places),3.0,,We took the lift up to the bar - but once there it was very crowded and people smoking so a bit unpleasant. That said the views are great. We didn't stay long. The hotel itself is like a shopping mall - not my idea of a nice place to stay - perhaps it's better in the more private areas. Specular architecture though.
,,Great view,5.0,,"Like most high viewing areas you get in s lift packed like sardines get to the top go wow and then head back down like sardines . That being said it was a great view a well worth getting some great photos of the city and gardens . There are no seating , assume it is to stop people from staying too long . There is a shop to purchase drinks from , pretty basic . Overall it was a great view and worth doing once ."
,,The views are amazing - the long wait terrible!,4.0,,"It took us about 20min to get into an elevator (only 3 elevators with max capacity of 20ppl). There were hundreds of people in line. Finally on top, we only had about 5 min to walk around just to wait again in a huge line to catch an elevator down (the same elevators we came up with). It took us over 30 min in line to get down again. The view are spectacular but the logistic and organizing need a big makeover."
,,Very good value view of the entire city and surroundings,4.0,,"Very good value view of the entire city and surroundings.
A super way to appreciate Singapore and the colossal number of ships bobbing around on the South China Sea.
Easy to walk to from Boat Quay and definitely combine with a visit to the gardens by the bay which is right next door."
,,Nice view of the Marina Bay area,4.0,,"I got a 15% discount for using a Citibank credit card which lowered the cost but wasn't mentioned until I thought they were having trouble with my card and they told me they were checking to see if it qualified for a discount. This would seem to be a thing that could have been said up front as it would have been annoying to find out later if I had used cash.
The view from the top is quite good and provides about 270 degrees of view as it's on the western end of the Sands complex. You various locations you get a nice view across to the Merlion and the Fullerton, the Theatres on the Bay, Singapore Flyer, and the Gardens by the Bay. If you want to take photos there are gaps in the glass barrier so that your camera can get an unobstructed view."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Another place to visit, when we were there we paid to go to the top for the view, restaurant and gift shop there also loads of shops as well. Well worth the visit"
,,Fantastic view at night,5.0,,Went as part of Singapore by night tour. A must see to see the city skyline and bay with lighted up tankers. Don't miss!
,,Beware,1.0,,"The staff were extremely unfriendly and unhelpful.
We arrived to get tickets to the restaurant and after explaining to the woman at the desk what we wanted she still sold us the wrong tickets as we found out later she only sold us the observation deck tickets.
When we entered the bar area we were moved to the other bar as it was covered and it started to rain so there was no service.
When we moved one of our party was asked to pay for the drinks before we moved as it’s a separate bar to where we were sitting. She gave him $50 and we had to chase up the change of $25 after an hour and a half.
When we moved to the new area we asked if we could use the vouchers and we were advised we could by the waiter who moved us and the new staff until the tome came to pay the bill and they refused to give us the credit as we were sold the incorrect tickets.
When we asked to see the manager at the sales desk he refused to allow the credit and also refused to give me the name of the manager he was dealing with for an hour just to say no refund. At the same time he admitted there was miscommunication between the Restaurants up the top and there had the same problems before but still would come to the party. He offered us to go back up to the observation deck again that same afternoon. Great outcome isn’t it.
Just be sure you can get your ticket which can be redeemed and not just the observation deck one. It must be a coloured one.
I have since heard same comments from other people who found the staff very unfriendly and unhelpful.
SHAME ON SUCH A BIG COMPANY."
,,Yes you need to see when visiting Singapore but....,3.0,,"Our overall feeling is just too overcrowded, we understand its an amazing structure and view but the people who run it may need to work out how get the flow of people in and out of this venue better."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"Great views over the race track, gardens by the bay and some of the newer attractions that are being built and the Singapore skyline. There were no queues to go up thought it was a bit expensive for what was up there which is basically an observation deck as you are not allowed in the pool area or the restaurant but its still a must do while visiting"
,,Great view day and night.,4.0,,"We stayed at the hotel so entry into the park was free, great views from the pool and well as the hot tubs on the other side."
,,"The most amazing place to visit, very beautiful scenery and worth my time.",5.0,,Very attractive view for all to be here. I will recommend that when you have time visit Marina bay and enjoy to see it all.
,,"Good rooftop views, mall and complex a bit Vegas-tacky",3.0,,"30 mins on the roof was good to see the city on a sunny day. No queues, no waiting and no crowds at midday on a Monday.
Inside the towers/mall area felt like a Vegas hotel - fake canals and designer shops with no one in them.
Recommend for the view but wouldn't linger beyond that"
,,Amazing once you arrive at the 56th floor,4.0,,"Its a bit of a maze to find the way through the hotel complex to the lifts to take you to the viewing platform but once there, well worth the time and effort. Singapore is amazing and this newish hotel and shopping complex and so much more just adds another dimension.
Views over the gardens and the port and city superb. Well worth visit."
,,Great views. Logistical tough,3.0,,"We visited on an organised tour. Fortunately this cut through a lot of the wait time and logistic difficulties. Once on the deck you are rewarded with stunning views! If your visit can coincide with nightly light shows at the super trees and down in the harbour, it's a real bonus."
,,View of Singapore,5.0,,"Although we only went up to top viewing floor(outside) the view of Singapore is all encompassing and absolutely enthralling, Highly recommended"
,,Fantastic night view from the deck,5.0,,"We went to the deck after 9:30pm on Easter Sunday. We missed the light and fountain show that night. Yet did enjoy the beautiful view over Gardens by the Bay and harbour from the top of Marina Bay Sands.

Thankfully we had very pleasant weather after the rain in the evening. There was breeze on the deck. We went to see the group photo taken by the hotel. We did buy 3 photos as the photographer could really catch the happy moment of us. We were grateful for giving a complimentary soft copy as we were the last customers to get the photos.

Thought it is worthwhile paying to get to the deck. The night harbour view is fantastic and impressive."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Nothing can compare to this unique hotel and restaurant. The view from the top is amazing. The snack bar looks out over the infinity pool and the Marina below. Food and drinks were good and reasonably priced. Relaxing atmosphere.
,,Another place you must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands - breathtaking - another “must” in Singapore

Fantastic and impressing buildings.
The view from the restaurant on the top is above all expectations.
Very good food, very friendly staff.
The only little “minus” is the high music in the restaurant which made conversation a little difficult for the round table of 6 persons where everyone hears well. So a little lower music would be fine, I think, for everyone."
,,Viewmazing!,4.0,,"What a great place to watch the sun go down and lights come out, so big and spacious and area with almost 360 degree views of Singapore. A definite must do!"
,,Great View!,5.0,,"It has a great view; however, it is a little pricey for the twenty minutes you spend up there. We chose to do this over the flyer."
,,Superb!!!,5.0,,"Well organized, only disappointing try to sell photos in high prices , the guy on 56th floor he was force to buy the photos, that’s not good."
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,"We came there on daytime but it was so hot, back at night. It was amazing with light art show. You can see both at Merlion Park and Marina Bay Sands light show. Recommend to visit at night."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,High standard and very charm. It kills any gloomy feelings by just hiking there. Worth visiting to make a good feeling.
,,Beautiful skypark,5.0,,Beautiful landscape and view of the Marina Bay and surroundings.. Good place to walk around and enjoy the view.
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"Visited the skypark and pool while staying at the Marina Bay Sands on business. The views of the city, gardens by the bay, and boats anchored on the straight are amazing. Agree with the others that the eats and drinks are a bit pricey, but I think worth it for the experience of the location to take it all in. Note if you go up at night for the bars or dinner there is a dress code (no candles, shorts, ...)."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,You cannot go in the pool unless you are a guest of the hotel but you can eat in the restaurant at the top and still see amazing views.
,,Wow,5.0,,Well worth the visit. It's huge but the view ....... unbelievable. We went right to the top. I hate heights but I grinned all the way. This is total luxury and you would be wrong to miss it.
,,"Wow, just wow",4.0,,"Celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary with a Singapore sling at C’est La Vie, made it so special for us. The views over Singapore are mind blowing, and a must see whilst in this area of the world."
,,Money money money,5.0,,Visited whilst staying at MBS. Amazing views but rammed with people. Pools cool but very very very expensive if you wish to eat. Worth just a swim and the views. Warm towels on tap as well which was a nice touch. Enjoyed taking the fun out of all the lovies who insisted on taking posing selfies. Made our afternoon. They really need to get lives. Wall to wall it was. Very good place to people watch
,,Stunning views!,5.0,,It’s a really awesome experience to be at the SkyPark. Standing on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands with a 360 view of Singapore is awesome. There are also 2 resturants that you can enjoy a meal while up there.
,,What a view,5.0,,Nothing prepared me for the building or the view! Fantastic. Grab a drink or eat in the restaurant and enjoy the view.
,,The view one of the best I have seen,5.0,,"I am scared of hights and for me to get up there to see the MUST see view is already amazing!
We went to the bar and even though all outdoor tables near the edges were taken, we still managed to take an amazing picture and admire the view.
The cocktails are expensive but I didnt really expect them to be cheap either."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"I visited the Skypark recently on my Singapore holiday. Amazing views. Very easy to access, staff friendly and helpful."
,,Queues too long to enjoy the experience,3.0,,"From the beginning to the end we had to wait 30 min to go to floor 56 to enjoy the view. The view from the top is spectacular but because we were part of a tour group, we enjoyed exactly 5 min there and had to start queueing again to go down. This time it took 45 min. Not a nice experience"
,,Great climax to our Singapore trip,5.0,,"What a finally to our Singapore vacation, on a beautiful moonlit night. We were also able to watch the 22.00 Spectra light & water show as it was a Saturday, after watching the 21.00 Spectra light & water show at ground level. ""No ignorant tourists to stand in front of you up here."""
,,Like a paradise,5.0,,My family and I took a day trip to visit Singapore on 19th April to celebrate my youngest birthday. It was nice building with great architecture. We walked around and had great lunch over there. It was expensive but we really enjoyed the Yummy food.
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Awesome hotel, build from three part, three soliter and big pool on the top with awesome view over Singaupre and Marina bay. Inside hotel got huge shoping mall."
,,love to rent a room for few months,5.0,,"very nice veiw , frendly staff, i had nice sty , whenever my suplies come i brought them here to play around."
,,A crazy hotel,4.0,,The place is really amazing top of the line right there with the best like the Venetians and galaxies and Atlantis of the world.. the attached mall is v nicely designed with lot of food options and shopping too.. the rooms overlooking the gardens are really a pleasure.. at the mall do not forget to c the evening 8 and 9 pm water and light show.. the infinity pool is amazing and is really a pleasure and unique experience
,,Excellant sunset view,5.0,,"If you do anything in the Singapore, then I would recommend going to the Skypark at sunset!
Only $23 to witness panoramic views from one of the highest vantage points in the city. If you go about half an hour before the timed sunset, then you'll enjoy those dusk views, then prepare for a beautiful sunset view with the sun going down on the city. Recommend taking a decent camera for those landscape captures. Be prepared to be offered to purchase lots of souvenir photos and fridge magnets on the tour!"
,,Wow a must see in Singapore,5.0,,Wow what a place to spend some money. Every label you have ever thought of is here. A must visit when in Singapore and also a visit to Skypark. Singapore should be very proud of this iconic building.
,,An essential part of the new tourist trail in Singapore,5.0,,"You don't have to stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to see the skylark. You just pay your money and go up. It's a nice place to relax, but it can get quite crowded."
,,A MUST when In Singapore,5.0,,"I went to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark as a birthday present for my 21st many years ago, this did not disappoint. Not only is it at the top of a luxury hotel. So the service is impeccable, however the views I must say is the BEST you'll get in Singapore. Don't forget to check out Ku' De' Ta' for a cold beverage after walking the Skypark!"
,,Wow and wow. Must see,5.0,,This is really must see. You don’t realize how huge it is until you stand right in front of the thing. Beautiful promenade walk around and beautiful shopping center with many restaurants. We even watched the water show which started at 8pm and was lovely.
,,clean environment,5.0,,"good foto spot , connect to the hotel , shopping center and casino , try the park on the bridge connecting hotel and shopping center for good foto spot"
,,Rip off,1.0,,S$46 for a ride up a lift to see some feeble lights and water jets way down below. View of city great though.
,,Luxury and friendly,5.0,,I was in this big luxury hotel for 4 nights. It is a big luxury hotel very famous for the swimming pool located at the top of the 3 towers. Top services in the great room. Personnel friendly al very we’ll printed to help the desire of the guests. Special tanks for the manager of the breakfast restaurant. She was particularly interested in my necessities and do everything possibles to help me. Fast and professional the luggage team and the phone help desk. At last a great hotel with thousands of costumers but where you can fell in your privacy to be at home.
,,A must see if you are in the city,4.0,,"Its Huge inside , so many restaurants and bars. We went to Spago for lunch Have a walk around if you are not staying and definitely take some photos inside and out."
,,Not to miss!,5.0,,You cannot miss it once you are in Singapore. It is the one thing you need to do because the views are amazing. You can stay up there as long as you want. Go by the sunset time and you won't regret it.
,,Poor Service But A Must Do,4.0,,You have to do this I suppose. Ride to the top and check out the view. Have a drink (served by miserable staff) and sit back. The pool at the hotel is crammed full of guests all competing for space. Like watching a bunch of little goldfish in a tank thats too small. Wouldnt rush back but worth a look-see.
,,Singapore Marina Bay area,4.0,,"The Singapore Marina Bay Area with all the skyscrapers and walking along the scenic waterfront promenade is an impressive skyline that all visitors to Singapore should visit.

Some of the best views from Sands SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands was designed by the renowned architect Moshe Safdie.
For a fee one can visit the SkyPark of the surroundings with the views Gardens by the Bay.

The Marina Bay area is an ideal place for night photos."
,,"Expensive, but worth the view",5.0,,"If you are not staying at the hotel, you cannot use the infinity pool. However, you can use the rooftop bar. It will cost each adult $S20 for access which can then be redeemed as payment towards the cost of your drinks (we paid $S50 for one Singapore Sling and a pint of lager!)Glad we did it (combined it with our visit to Gardens By The Bay)."
,,Night view of SG,5.0,,Simply magnificent looking at all buildings and other great views from the top during night time. Perfect view of the bay and Gardens by the bay.
,,Must see,5.0,,"The crowning glory of Singapore. If you only have a chance to see one thing make it this place. Views are sensational, facilities are great but it’s a one time expense, it is not cheap!"
,,On top of SG,5.0,,"One of the must visits in SG. You feel you are on top of SG with 360 degree view of SG, you can feel SG from Above... worth a visit considering the price,"
,,Heaven on Earth,5.0,,"This is like nothing you have ever experienced before. The view here is simply magnificent. Cost you a little to experience this, just do it. It even overlook almost the entire city."
,,Stunning scenery,5.0,,"Had a lovely visit to the skypark, unbelievable views, thought prices were ok for the attraction, your entry tickets go towards your first drinks. Well worth going"
,,Expensive,4.0,,Thought overpriced but the view was magnificent. Would have appreciated a coffee which was available but without seating.
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Must visit this place at lease one, no need to buy ticket for garden of the bay. Better to carry your own snacks and cold drink"
,,Lunch with a view,4.0,,"Must do for a refreshing beverage with a view or a great place to dine.

Marina Bay Sands Skypark was a great place to visit and send sometime with friends overlooking the city is Singapore

Food was good and staff friendly- really enjoyed our afternoon at this venue- worth a visit☕️"
,,You need a head for heights!,5.0,,Wow! Exhilarating experience to be up on the observation deck but boy oh boy it is high and I felt exposed!! Fantastic views and well worth doing but be prepared!!
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,I love malls. And this is a SERIOUS mall. It has sampan / gondolas inside. Up to the 57 floor you get an excellent view of the skyline and 1 free drink. I’d recommend going to the lounge bar as this is groovier and you can look over the spectacular infinity pool.
,,Singapore holiday March 2018,5.0,,"Good place to see once, it will take 30 minutes to see , take good camera, be prepared for waiting for rain , carry umbrella always, carry small hand fan, sunglasses must day time, hanky as many possible. You will see good view when you visit at 6..30 pm onwards"
,,Unbelievable,4.0,,An amazing structure it is worth going up to the viewing area to see the spectacular views. Walking through the lobby there is much to take your interest
,,Did not want to leave,5.0,,Great views from every position on the skypark. Even has reasonable priced snacks and drinks. Spent over 3 hours looking at the views. Best time to go is around 6pm to see the views at day and the sunset over the city an hour later.
,,Cocktails on top of the skypark,5.0,,"We visited this hotel a couple of weeks ago now. We walked through the lovely hotel lobby and to the lifts which took us the 60+ floors up to the sky park. We didn’t spend too much time in the sky park, but went for a cocktail in the roof top bar, which was amazing! They were very helpful and the cocktails good. It would be good to get up here before sunset and sit with a drink and watch the sun go down. The guests of the hotel can use the infinity pool, which you can see, but apparently the hotel is quite expensive!!"
,,Very nice,5.0,,"Best to arrive there at 7.45 pm so you can see two live shows. One is from garden ny the bay and the 2nd one is water and might show from event plaza. The ticket costs $23 adult each. So if you want to add extra $$, you can book your lunch or dinner at the restaurant up there. You need to book as they are very busy."
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views and worth the effort to do it. Very efficiently run and needs to be as it is popular. Go 30 minutes before dark and you will be able to watch the lights go on in the city and then wait for the light show at 8
,,Great view but overrated,3.0,,"There are undoubtedly great view from here but for me very overrated We queued for an age to buy a ticket, have a photo taken and then the lift but only stayed on the viewing deck for 15 minutes"
,,Sky park at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel,5.0,,"This is at the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It gives you a panoramic view of the city's central business district area on one side and the View of Gardens by Bay on the other. That apart you can also see the Singapore Flyer. The views are breath taking to be honest.

Tip: Try visiting this place in the evening as it can get pretty warm during the day, besides the city looks amazing in the night."
,,Most visited tourist Place,5.0,,It is one of the Most visited tourist Place. You will see the beautiful view of the city. A view from the top is amazing. Looks so beautiful during night. Full of lights. Very crowded place but it's worth a visit.
,,Impressive View,4.0,,My only disappointment is that we couldn't go all the way to the top as we visited before 5. One of the oddest and most interesting buildings I have ever seen.
,,Stunning view with not so much more expensive prices,5.0,,"This building is a must see when in Singapore - what else do you see when thinking of the Singapore skyline. You go directly up to the highest floor and change the elevator to get to the restaurant upstairs. The infinity pool is for guests of the hotel only. The restaurant and bar is open for everyone. And the prices are actually not that much more expensive than any other bar in Singapore. You would expect a lot worse. Of course, Singapore is expensive so it's still not cheap."
,,Amazing....simply spectacular.,5.0,,This was part of our Singapore Night Out tour again with RMG. A must see. Truly spectacular especially at night. Very crowded but well worth it.
,,Magnificent view of the City,4.0,,We went at night as it was included in our tour. A fantastic view of Singapore & Gardens by the Bay. The bar on the top is amazing. Drinks were a tad pricey but worth it due to the view.
,,IT WOULD CALL THIS A MUST SEE IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,All major cities have cool observation decks. What makes this one unique is the huge rooftop infinity swimming pool. Quite a site.
,,Top of the world view,5.0,,"The MBS SkyPark observation deck has an elevation of 200 meters much above the Singapore Flyer. With safe transparent railings all round the wood finished floor, the visitors can have a comfortable ambience to look around and see the major landmarks of Singapore. The panoramic views of Super Trees, Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, Flyer and Grand Prix tracks, Helix Bridge, Fullerton Hotel, Merlion Statue, the skyscrapers in the CBD are amazing. Recommended timing of visit is from late afternoon to night. The twilight scene, sunset view and twinkling evening lights in the city create a memorable experience in our mind."
,,Beautiful.,5.0,,The most beautiful building in Singapore. The construction is amazing and the view from top is breathtaking.
,,Mood lifting,5.0,,"Marina bay sands... Such a wonderful place, nice ambiance.. A must visit if you ever travel to singapore"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"As guests of MBS, we had free access to the skypark. great view. totally worth it....you even had some good places to eat and spend some time there."
,,Mr Peter Lassman,5.0,,"Brilliant nothing else to say the Shopping Mall rivals Dubai, pay $20 SGD and go to the Day Bar on the 57th floor and you get a $20 Voucher towards your food or drinks so why pay for the observation area, it’s a no Brainer as the views are just as good from the Bar"
,,Expensive,2.0,,Not much to do up there except looking at the view. Not sure the price you pay is worth it. I prefer the flyer.
,,Amazing views over the city,4.0,,"This hotel offers the spectacular 'ship' in the sky view over the city of Singapore. A great experience for a sundowner although expect to Q to get up in the elevator and a warning for those on a budget, it is rather pricey."
,,Nice views,5.0,,Easily accessible with strollers. Nice views even though it was raining. Toddler had space to run around in. Not very busy probably due to the season but glad we came now as quiet and no waiting around. A bit pricy for what it is though.
,,Amazing view of city and worth doing,4.0,,"Great views and well worth doing when in Singapore. I wouldn't give it 5 stars simply because there is not much built into the experience. I would have expected something about the history of the building and how it was built, but nothing. You just go straight up and then leave when you've seen enough. But overall worth the doing for the views which are spectacular"
,,Best view of Singapore,3.0,,Go up the Sands hotel for a really nice Panoramic view of the city. You pay 20SGD to go up to level 57. With your ticket you can pau for a drink or snack worth that amount. Well spend 20SGD.
,,hotel,5.0,,"what an awesome hotel , no matter how much they charge , but do check in in this hotel , to experience the infinity pool , on top floor , mind blowing , u will not come out of the swimming pool , i was there in the pool for 11 hrs , only came out for food , superb view , hotel tariff high , but should not miss to not check in"
,,Superb & Wonderful Views,5.0,,"Hi we had a truly wonderful experience whilst visiting the 'Skypark' on the 56th floor. It was quiet so even better for moving around & taking all those photos. The 360 views are fantastic of Singapore. We enjoyed the open air restaurant still overlooking with fantastic views whilst enjoying spicy fried squid with sauce & local beers. All at a reasonable price. Couldn't think of any where better to have a meal & relax.
This may not be the highest view that you can get of the city, but sitting atop of such a famous hotel with the double view of the skyscrapers downtown and the boats below is well worth the trip up. Recommended without a doubt."
,,Don't waste your money,2.0,,"Instead of the 'skypark' with its limited views, no cover and no drinks - skip this and go to the Spargo Bar. We were very dissapointed. Staff at the Marina Bay hotel say they don;t know about the Spargo (Tower 2) because they want to rip you off with this place."
,,Sensational panorama,5.0,,"We visited the Skypark this afternoon, our first surprise was how reasonable it was to enter $20 pp to level 56 or an additional $20pp to level 57 with the bar & restaurant, & this second cost was redeemable at the bar/restaurant.
The second surprise was how peaceful it was at the top - 57 floors up I’d expected some strong winds but it was very calm.
Despite the incoming cloud we had a wonderful 360 degree view of the whole city & harbour.
This to me is a must for anyone visiting this intriguing city."
,,Amazing Singapore,5.0,,"Loved the view from the. 56 th floor .
It's even higher than the Singapore flyer . Lovely photo opportunity as well.Best time to reach there is around 5:30 ..so that you can get both the day and the night view . You can enjoy the laser show as well at 8 pm from here . a must do in Singapore"
,,Big queues and can get same view from pool,4.0,,If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands don't bother with Skypark as the same view can be seen from pool area and there is a bar/restaurant there as well.
,,Marina bay sands,5.0,,This hotel is 1st class it's a must on your wish list. I had high expectations and it exceeded them. Well worth the money. A trip to Singapore would be wasted without a stay at this hotel. Best hotel EVER
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Well worth visiting the Sky Deck for fantastic views over Singapore. You can only visit one end of the deck as the rest is reserved for visitors to the bar and restaurant and the hotel guests where there is a swimming pool as well!!
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The photos don't do it justice. The views are incredible, just an amazing experience all round. the pool is amazing and the food and drinks aren't too badly priced for the location."
,,Swimming pool,5.0,,The MBS sky park has good view of the Singapore sky line but is too crowded especially in the weekends. I don’t really enjoy the sky park when it’s heavily crowded with tourist and children. There’s barely space left for sitting quietly to enjoy the view..or an unblocked view without guests walking past you endlessly.
,,Great view,4.0,,We visited the sky park whilst on holiday in Singapore. It was a must see on my husbands wish list after seeing the documentary of how this great marvel was built. It is definitely an engineering feat and to visit the top observation deck really made u appreciate the engineering of this place.
,,No Eye contact so their missing personality,4.0,,First time in this truly amazing hotel. The swimming pool on 57 floor offers a great view of the city. They loose out due to a lack of Eye contact. No one knows how to look at you in the Resturant or reception.
,,Limited access when raining,4.0,,You can only go to the indoor restaurant on the roof when raining and are not allowed out on the decks during rain. To be fair they were very clear about this at ground level when booking a visit. Quite a sight
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The skypark was a spectacle. You had to go into marina bay sands and go up on to part of the roof and then get on an elevator that takes you up to the 56th floor. Once you're up there you can just walk about on top of it. The views were amazing and I would recommend going in the evening or afternoon once the heat has died down a bit otherwise it might be too hot. Once you have finished on the 56th floor you can go in to the bar area and get a drink, but once you go in you can't go back out, you can only go to the 57th floor, where the infinity pool is. I did not like the 57th floor as much as the infinity pool just looked like it was full of people posing and it was overcrowded.
Overall, The views were spectacular but I would recommend staying on the 56th floor."
,,Cruise tour,5.0,,Life relaxation where you can watch the terrestial view from the top of the bldg. the beauty of the city nd the merlion nd the singapore flyer seen from the roof top swimming pool
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Great view and great cocktails. Don’t pay for the viewing platform, just go to the bar and the view is free and amazing"
,,Great City View....,5.0,,The observation deck of the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark is a unique place on top of an unusual hotel to view the city of Singapore that should not be missed. A little pricey but worth the visit.
,,Worth going up for the view,4.0,,Good view from the sky park and cheaper than the Singapore flyer. There is a gift shop at the top and option to go into the bar area for a drink at the top of the attraction.
,,very impressive,5.0,,You have not been to Singapore if you have not visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. We recommend a make a pre-reservation if you want to have dinner at one of the restaurants.
,,Great view,5.0,,Whilst a little expensive the view is stunning when you get to the top. I'd recommend going so you can appreciate the beauty of this amazing building and the skyline of the city
,,Amazing pool!,5.0,,Couldn't fault our stay here. The infinity pool was the highlight of the stay. Room was lovely and had everything we needed. Location also really good.
,,Skydeck visit,4.0,,Went up during the day great views of CBD and Gardens by the bay around $20 ea to go up worth a look. Great spot for photos food and drinks are available on top
,,You have to do this,5.0,,"A visit without having a trip to the top of this amazing building would be something missed though a little scary for those who don’t like heights ! Walking out of the lift and into the bar area makes you realise just how high up you really are!

One important piece of advice wound be to take the twenty dollar trip where you can redeem this on a drink which will cost you a bit more but much better value than just doing the viewing platform where there is nowhere to sit and no refreshments either.

A spectacular building inside and out lots to see and If you can afford it stay a few nights the rooftop pool is amazing as is the restaurant"
,,Must do!,5.0,,"You cannot come to Singapore and not do this! The views are magnificent! Highly recommended, especially at night."
,,This is a must visit,5.0,,After seeing this amazing structure one just has to take a trip to the top. The elevator takes you to the top floor in 45 seconds! This is an incredible work of architecture.
,,Picked a perfect day,5.0,,"This is a photographers delight. Views of the harbour, the river and the city itself. I would recomment anyone visiting Singapore make this a priority"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This is pretty amazing. The view from up here is awesome. You don't need to stay at the hotel to enjoy the view but you do if you want to see the pool or eat in the restaurant.
,,Awesome Views,5.0,,"This was so worth the entrance fee ($23 SGD p.p).
Observation deck on 56th floor gives you amazing views of Singapore. I had been obsessed by the outside of the hotel when we visited Singapore last year so it was only apt that we ventured to the top this year."
,,Do not go if any chance of rain.,1.0,,"We arrived and bought tickets for our whole family. We went up to the observation point and it was difficult to get any good photos as the atmosphere was foggy and the glass screens misted up. Despite the advertised refund for those who had arrived within the hour of rain my request was refused. We could not go into the bar Ce La vie as it was. Loved as it was raining. I complained bitterly but politely that they had taken our money without warning the conditions made the experience pointless. We were eventually granted a second admission later in the day as recompense. This is a very expensive trip to see Singapore from high up. The photos they take of you are not that Good and cost 80 sgd
It is a shame as taking your own photos gives you the true view of the container ships and cranes. Not recommended."
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,"We were lucky as it was a very clear day in Singapore when we visited so the views were spectacular. Unfortunately, they were also preparing for a private function so the bar area was closed, so we couldn't sit and admire the view for longer. There is no other seating and no protection from the sun. The views are brilliant, but it's a pity the Skypark was not more visitor-friendly on this occassion."
,,A beautiful and spectacular place,5.0,,"A beautiful and sophisticated place with well-known stores and beautiful views, as well as spending hours at this place for all ages."
,,A must do,5.0,,Not much to say except wowsers - a must visit. It is mind blowing how good this is and must be the best attraction in Singapore. Even better stay at the hotel to enjoy it all
,,"If nothing else, do this when you visit Singapore",5.0,,"There are a wealth of sights to see and memories to make when you visit Singapore but regardless of time, do make the effort to visit the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands. Just to walk through the splendour of the ground floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is mesmerising enough but follow the signs to the Skypark and you will not be disappointed. When we visited there was not much of a queue to purchase tickets at SGD 23 per adult. Have your photo taken before you go up if you must but we bypassed this extra! It’s then a 45 second trip up a staggering 56 floors to take you to the Skypark. It was a little hazy when we visited but still absolutely jaw dropping views, out over the city, towards the golf course and across the harbour where the huge cargo ships loom in the distance. You can get a drink and an ice cream up there and there is some shade if you prefer but just soak up that view and be amazed. So worth the ticket price!"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,This is the place I wanted to see and I loved it. Huge hotel with a gorgeous deck terrace at the top with great views over Singapore and Gardens by the Bay. A must visit
,,Must visit,5.0,,The views here alone are worth the trip both day or night. Even those who are not staying at the hotel can purchase tickets to visit the top of this world famous venue and click away. Swimming pool is reserved only for hotel guests
,,Spectacular views choose a good time of the year as some days can get haze.,4.0,,Ok. Its Sg 23 to get to the top. My advice is to go up later in afternoon (make sure it is a clear day). Then stay for sunset and later the light show. There is food available up there. If you go into the upper restaurant you can't get back onto the Sky Deck. Enjoy the views.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Great view, and I really love this city. It’s spotlessly clean, super easy to get around. We can’t wait to come back! The ease of getting up to the observation deck was flawless, and very affordable. A must-do in Singapore"
,,Amazing views - well worth the entrance money,5.0,,"You have to be there to appreciate just how spectacular the views are! This is a ""must do"" while in Singapore."
,,Just do it!,5.0,,The most amazing hotel and view of the marina area. Just to be up there in such a unique setting is amazing.
,,Amazing view but expensive,5.0,,"One of the more expensive things that we did on this trip. For what it is I’m not sure it is worth it. Very little shelter and shade cover. We went during the middle of the day and while there were no lines it was very very hot.
Small cafe at the top and gift shop"
,,Can't really not go to this,5.0,,"This is such an iconic building, visible from afar, that it's pretty impossible to be in Singapore and not visit it, even if you have been up a lot of viewing towers (which I have).
As these things go, this is as you would expect, with panorama views of the city, lots of selfie opportunities and a cafe. It also has a great view of the infinity swimming pool of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which was almost standing room only with so many people in it. I was so glad I wasn't staying there!"
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,Yet another feather in the cap for Singapore. The skypark is the highest terrace in singapore which gives you the feeling of being on top of the world. You can enjoy the horizon views of Singapore. Indonesian and malaysian features can be seen towards north and south respectively.the skyperk is at the 56th floor of epic Marina Bay Sands hotel. Infinity pool is further above which is open only to the guests of the hotel. You overlook the gardens by the bay and enjoy the mesmerising view of sea. Restraunt is also there in case you want to enjoy coffee and snacks.
,,Fabulous views.......,5.0,,"This is an absolute must when visiting Singapore. We got to the hotel about 6pm, sunset was 7.30, and paid small fee to go up to the Ce La Vi restaurant and sky bar and got a voucher for the amount we had paid to put towards drinks or food. However, if you just go up to the observation deck, same level, you have to pay similar price but get nothing in return.
The views were fabulous and it was amazing to see the city change as the sun went down. There was also a laser, water show after sunset in the marina below, awesome......"
,,must-do when in Singapore,5.0,,"The perfect view from the skypark which is located on the top of the iconic marina bay. You can see the legendary infinity pool on the roof (accessible for hotel guests only) and might be windy up there as it is ""outdoor"" observatory."
,,Nice views from top.,4.0,,Nice views from top. It was interesting to watch Gardens by the bay from top rather than anything else as all other views can be had in other cities too. like hong kong has victoria peak. But the Gardens looked beautiful from the skypark
,,It was interesting for five minutes,3.0,,"See the city views, look at the infinity pool, pay a lot for the drinks and food and that's about it."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"My wife and I have visited the skypark many times. Basically every time when a friend pays us a visit, we’ll take them to this place. This spacious deck allows you to soak in the breathtaking view of Marina bay, and it looks even better if you are visiting after sunset."
,,"Outstanding views, great bar and a gift shop.",5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and our visit to the Sky Park was free. It was a beautiful deck with lots of information plaques telling about the buildings you were looking at. The gift shop was small, but the prices were fairly reasonable. The bar had great views and plenty of seating."
,,Expensive,5.0,,"Our hotel had a wonderful view of the iconic marina bay sands but we visited just to see the view from the top. The lift tickets are $20 each but they said we could use that fee as credit to buy drinks or food up there. The lift was quick, not crowded at dusk, but did have a big line by the time we came down. We arrived at the top to find out that the areas with the best view are for hotel guests only and we were stuck with a crowded, and often smoky area back from the guests. However the view was brilliant and we eventually found a bar stool and ordered one drink each. After the $40 already paid, we still had to hand over another $15 for taxes etc. $55 for two drinks! If you only go up once it's certainly worth it for the view but I wouldn't go again. The area is out in the open air and gives a sense of the height and certainly a fabulous view of the light show below and the city by night."
,,"Must visit,great views!!",5.0,,"It will cost you 23 dollars, to go to the top of Marina Bay skypark.
You get to walk around the top with the most amazing views.
You could probably spend about 40 mins maybe 1 hour looking roun.
There is a souviner shop at the top and a drinks and ice cream shop.
We really enjoyed it."
,,Not as it seems,1.0,,"Went to get tickets to obtain drinks at sky park when I went to desk it was the wrong one , so I asked the lady on the counter where do I go and she was very rude in the way that she spoke to me just sorry I didn’t get her name. I asked where do I go then and she said up the escalator to the top there is a desk in the lobby I said where is the desk located it’s in the lobby she replied, oh I asked whereabout’s and she said again the lobby, no proper info at all. So we went to find desk in lobby which is not signposted but says the name of restaurant/bar. We bought the tickets and went in the lift.at floor 57 you get out and go either left or right. We went left to the lounge area. Which on first impression was very nice... ordered our drinks when the bill comes there is a tax and a 10% approx service charge I gave my card to pay and they took it away then 10mins later they returned with my card and card machine no idea why they had it for so long. When you are sat down the sofas are extremely dirty with cigarette burns in them and the guests staying at the hotel must feel like they are in ham hard being looked at which I don’t feel is very good when you pay all that £ to stay there. Definitely not the wow factor I was expecting"
,,Best view in the world,5.0,,"To look at this building from the ground is incredible, to go up in the lift and view Singapore from the top is mind-blowing. I couldn't possibly visit Singapore without going up the Skypark"
,,Yes you must see it but it’s a zoo,3.0,,"Mall, mall and a big mall. Oh yeah there’s a 2500 room hotel there, so does that tell everything you need to know. Oh yeah a large casino too."
,,Impressive! Outstanding! Mortgage the house!,5.0,,"340USD/nt gets you in a room. A walk thro will have you gaping. a trip to the roof deck is 24USD. Gives you a nice over-view of all of Singapore - including the sensational Gardens by the Bay!

But don't go up unless it's a clear day...."
,,Great views but pool is COLD!,5.0,,I was quite surprised that the pool was so cold. Probably only 74-76 degrees so I didn't stay in long. The views however are spectacular!
,,Amazing views and a great place to meet friends,5.0,,"I am not sure if you can just pay to go up here, we stayed at Marina Bay Sands so it was inclusive, there are a couple of famous bars here also, Sprago, televised with famous housewives from USA, what a great place and amazing cocktails, the service is really spot on also, be aware it is not cheap but you have to spoil yourself now and again I suppose"
,,Nice visit - but plan it right,4.0,,I had a weekend ‚to kill‘ in Singapore and went for a long walk along Orchard Road down to the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel. First I bought the ticket to go up to the SkyPark for the view which was nice but rather expensive for the limited view. After coming down I found that one can by a ticket to the restaurant on top which gives similar views and the fee is fully allocated to the consumption bill which is good value. I had a glass of wine and some sushi. The views were great but the service a bit rushed.
,,Views!!!,5.0,,"There is a Skypark (entrance ticket is 23SGD) and Skybar (Ce La Vie, entrance ticket is 20SGD). For some reason they made a rule that once you go to one place you can’t pay extra money while you’re at the top to go to another one. We eneded up having a table at Skybar (ticket voucher can be changed for a drink, and you will have to pay some extra money) and enjoyed sunset and the view. Skybar is full in the evening so I wouldnt recommend going that late since it’s almost impossible to get a table."
,,If you Here - Go Upwards,5.0,,If you in Singapore don't give up. Take the fast elevator and reach the building's roof. It is the world's highest park. It has ship like design and probably the most expensive one. If you are already at Singapore dont miss this view point expirience.
,,No Words....well maybe some,5.0,,"Well worth the money to see this incredible view of Singapore. You can get it a few $ cheaper too if you book through your hotel like I did. I did make a mistake though and put the wrong date when booking online, and didn't realise until we were lining up for entry, at first I was devastated thinking they won't let us change, but although they couldn't help me they gave me a number to call which then I had to email another place, I thought it was going to be a disaster. The lady was true to her word when she told me that they will answer straight away, as they did, took about 20 minutes to clear up. I don't think you would get that service anywhere else in the world"
,,Hot Nice View,4.0,,"We went in the summer (Aug) so it was very hot at the top observation deck during the day and there're not much shades. Wear a hat, sunscreen and bring cool water even though there's a bar selling refreshments."
,,"Great architecture, but .........",4.0,,"One could not but marvel at the architecture of this building, but equally I came away wondering why it is that the world can build a structure like this, but can't manage to feed those who starve. For me this was a somewhat reflective experience."
,,"Marina bay sands skylark was fantastic,",5.0,,"WOW what a view, you think you have seen it all until you go to these heights, you can see forever, even after a storm, great view of the harbour and the waiting ships to come in."
,,Spectacular architecture!,5.0,,"You can see this attraction from a long distance. It is possible to enter the observation deck at 57 floor, but it can be a bit of time to wait to enter. Also 20 minutes waiting to get down again, when we visited."
,,Slight Advantage for Hotel Occupants,4.0,,"The nice thing about the Sky Park is the observation deck. The better thing about it is the infinity pool , which is complimentary only for hotel in house guests, in which your card key is the access point. views can be jaw dropping, and while you're at it, how about having coffee or alcoholic drinks at the top, or trying the Italian cuisine at the Lavo restaurant. You won't regret it."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"Finding the ticket booth to get up to the top was a challenge, but once there WOW. The view of Singapore was unbelievable, and the access around the top level was amazing. The lift will get you up there in no time, and you can stay as long as you like. The staff were very friendly and welcoming."
,,Birds eye view,4.0,,"The viewing deck at the Skypark made my head spin, you are so far up, almost like being in the clouds...but we were lucky enough to have good weather when we were there...and the view from the top is incredible."
,,Nice pool,5.0,,"have to pay to go to the infinity pool, really worth it. say no more, pool is for boys, men go to casino, hahahaha"
,,Great views but...,3.0,,The views from 52nd floor cover all of Singapore and it was very quiet when we went. I wouldn't wait in a long line or pay to go up to the 52nd floor...nothing up there except he view!
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,"Stunning cityscape and harbourfront views from up here. Admission prices are a bit on the high side unless you are a hotel guest. It would be worthwhile not to miss the views at night, especially the sound and light show across the waterway at the Gardens; plus of course the lights city all lit up."
,,Well worth the view,4.0,,"Best time to visit either being on sunset or at night as you are able to see the show from Gardens by the Bay - Supertree Grove. Views of Singapore are stunning. Little expensive, but you do it ..."
,,A night of a thousand stars,5.0,,"We ventured up to the Skypark at around sunset so we were able to see Singapore by day and night. The view is magnificent. Plenty of opportunities for photos and selfies with such an amazing backdrop. If you time it right, you can watch the light show in the Gardens by the Bay."
,,The best place in Singapore,5.0,,"Located in the hearth of Singapore the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a the best view of city for pictures and drinks on the bar! The view is a 360 degrees of city, and in the night is a excelent moment for view the water and light show over! The Skypark is located on the hotel (3 towers) in a boat format! Unmissible!"
,,amazing views!!!,5.0,,"we stayed at the hotel and the views for all arouund on the skypark is worth a million, you see all the city from there"
,,Not a High Priority,2.0,,"This located at the top of the Sands Hotel. There is a special check in spot and elevator. The elevator is fast. The views from the top are quite spectacular. On a clear day you can see a good portion of Singapore. I was impressed with the views of the harbor with the hundreds f boats lined up to be loaded or unloaded. The two things, I did not like about it. One, part of the to floor is part of the hotel and is off limits. Two, I thought the price of admission was a little steep for what it was. Don't think I would visit it again. Lot more interesting things to do in Singapore."
,,A Great Experience!,5.0,,"So we gained access to the Skypark as we were staying at the hotel. All hotel guests will be issued with a card and they have to be brought along to enter the Skypark. There are turnstiles at the entrance, and again at the toilet.

The view from up here is just breathtaking. Some sun decks are dipped near the pool and it's a great, great place to just relax, while watching the kids. The pool is not too deep, where we were the pool was more for soaking than swimming.

There is also a kiddy pool with glass panels around them. Pool guards are vigilant all the time.

Food and drink is exorbitant. $10++ for fruit juice. But the food was good. We ordered a side to share as my 4yo was hungry but unwilling to leave the pool just yet.

The infinity pool is definitely a must visit for the experience!"
,,Good view but always crowded,4.0,,Came here several times for staycation and the pool was always crowded with people. Difficult to find a spot to chill properly. Jacuzzi is always occupied and I feel lucky if I did get a spot in it. Good experience and pretty view of Singapore skyline. Enjoys naming all the places I know.
,,Wow,5.0,,Definitely don't miss taking the time to ride the lift to the viewing deck. An amazing view. Food and drinks are available at the top also. No access to the pool unless you stay at the resort.
,,"Great view, but overall experience was mediocre",3.0,,"First, yes, there is a great view, although it's almost too high. The Gardens by the Bay evening light show was tiny from this distance, but it does offer a great panoramic view of the city.

On to the rest. $20 will get you access to the observation deck, but the $20 can be used as credit at the bar. Of course, a beer costs $27. So, not really a bargain. More importantly, this was the only place in Singapore where I thought the service was really sub par. The staff in general seemed bored and uninterested in assisting guests.

Overall, I was underwhelmed and thought it was overrated. I wish I had gone to the zoo for the night safari instead."
,,Great attraction,5.0,,Excellent views from the skypark...... It is segregated from the section. Used by the paying guests however you can walk through the hotel grand floor just as if you were staying there well worth the cost (n.b.if you travelled by Singapore airlines you get a discount on the admission)...
,,Breathtaking View,5.0,,Beautiful is the word I should use. in the evening the lightning is too awesome. this is a must place to visit and get a photo clicked.
,,Underwhelming bar the view,3.0,,"This is a great place to take some snaps but you are only allowed up one end of the full roof area which is disappointing as you really want to take a photo of the pool area which is only allowed to guests of the hotel. That is fine but a pic would be nice too of that area. I have previously styed at the hotel and it is amazing and the pool area is sensational but for me, this skypark is a little underwhelming."
,,Good view,4.0,,A few years ago we came up in the morning. Great view of the city. This time we came back in the evening for the night view. The view was great but it was so busy we couldn’t get a drink or something to eat . To get back down we had to wait at least 45 minuets for the lift. We were then all squashed into the lift. Not a nice experience.
,,Best view Singapore financial District,4.0,,"Do not miss this place if you want to have a glimpse of Singapore's financial district. Though the skyline in Singapore is no where close to other modern cities, the view from the skypark is good specially if you are there from 5 to 8 pm. You can see the sun setting behind the tall buildings and buildings getting lighted up. The entry fee is little bit expensive when you consider there is nothing much to do that top apart from strolling in the little space up there. It could get crowded during the weekends. Do factor that in your schedule."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,This iconic building is a definite must for anybody travelling here. The views from the top are amazing. Not for anybody who isn't keen on heights.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Spectacular views over the harbour, especially in the evening.
You can book tickets online which saves you the waiting cue.
Only downside is that some people “claim” a spot at the viewsites by sitting down or placing children buggies. This should be discouraged by the Hotel."
,,"Great views, rather crowded & expensive",3.0,,"The architecture is more impressive viewed from the ground or across the bay.

Discounts are available for seniors, also if you show a Singapore Airlines boarding card.
Go early in the day for lower temperatures on the exposed deck, and the air should be less hazy. Views really are good in every direction.

You can find shade & a drink in the bar, but it is very expensive."
,,Most famous place in Singapore,5.0,,It was raining when we visit this place. We have really enjoyed the mot famous site of Singapore. Sound and light show is superb
,,Underwhelmed,2.0,,"Visited the Skygarden while on a trip with my partner. It was so underwhelming.
Only the tip of the area is open to public, the rest is for guests of the hotel, which is far enough.
Its basically a decked area to enjoy the view. It does that but calling it a garden is a bit much. Not a single plant up there... just decking, expensive food and drink along with... well not a lot else. For me it couod he so much better.
There is a restuarant up there but no menu on show, check it out online and wasnt keen.
If you want to pay quite a lot for the views then great this is for you. Personally I wasnt that keen."
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,Loved it .... a great activity for young and old .. beautiful scenery and view over Singapore and sea. Reasonably priced (Singapore is not cheap) ... very well kept and excellent facilities.
,,Efficiently Managed,3.0,,We paid 20 dollars for entry which was then deducted from the cost of drink at the top. Worth doing for the views from the top but so crowded and impossible to sit comfortably to have drink. A must do though when in Singapore.
,,Over rated,2.0,,"Its very confusing trying to find where you can see a view. We went up in a lift and were turned away. We didn't know you had to pay for the viewing platform. We thought you could go to the bar and have a drink if you weren't a guest. Anyway, we ended up in an elevator with a guest who used his key card to access it. This gave us access to the top bar outside. I don't know whether we should have been guests or not but I don't think so. We waited for ages for service and kept hearing people complaining. Yes, the views were amazing but it was very posy and there was thumping Ibiza chill out music going on constantly. We are much more your colonial hotel type e.g. Raffles and Fort Canning Hotel. We wouldn't choose to stay there nor pay for the viewing platform. I would, however rather fancy a dip in the infinity pool and would have happily paid for a day pass for that but they don't do them. Do it if you feel it is a must but we didn't particularly enjoy it."
,,Stunning,5.0,,The view is incredible. You can’t go to Singapore and not experience it. Very easy to take the lift and have coffee at the top. It would be expensive if you decided to stay for lunch. Lovely to watch swimmers in the infinity pool and to marvel at the feat of extraordinary engineering that this building represents
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"What a spectacular view!
I'm terrified of heights so couldn't get to the edge to take photos but I can say that the view is amazing and you feel like you are on top of the world.
I was able to exit the lifts and then walk around relatively easily as there is a central wall you can lean against with quite a few metres of platform between this wall and the edge of the observation deck. The view is well worth the effort and anxiety it took to get me up there."
,,Nothing really special.,2.0,,"Really, this attraction was not anything special. Others better. Children were bored, hot and disliked the walking. The childrens attitude was pretty much ours."
,,Must see in Singapore,4.0,,"Pictures of this building do not do it justice, it's an amazing spectacle day and night. I would recommend making the trip to the top pool area and having at least one drink (not cheap)"
,,Pricey but pretty,4.0,,"The view is really beautiful but a tad pricey! Also, a bit tricky to find if you’re alone and don’t know a thing about the layout. The restaurants on top look great and the staff were friendly."
,,Visit once to tick off the list,4.0,,"Floor 57 at Marina Sands is pretty funky with the infinity pool, bar area and observation desk. We enjoyed our visit and overall felt that it was something we had to see on a trip to Singapore. The architecture is quite something. The pool looks great and the drinks are expensive. Think expensive and then add some more $$$ and that is what it costs. All the same worth seeing."
,,Great view fantastic room service otherwise disappointing,3.0,,"Let me start with positives
1. Great views from the room , we watched the light show from our room
2. Very spacious room
3. Very clean room
4. Comfortable bed
5. Room service fab- in room dinning excellent food.
6. Very good concierge.

Negatives
1. Arrived close to midnight and check in at the counter took approximately 20-25 minutes
2. Infinity pool was a disappointment, water was cold both in the day and night , staff at the gate very rude. Very busy understandable as lots of guests
3. No place in the lounge to sit and relax , very busy place felt like an airport"
,,Good,5.0,,Well the infinity pool at this hotel is simply awesome.this hotel redefines luxury at a whole new level.please do visit this pride of Singapore and yes it is definitely worth the money spend.the kids love the pool as well.and yes it's very expensive
,,"Fabulous Views, Crowded Terrace",4.0,,"Anyone will tell you that this is a must for Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is arguably the city state's most iconic building and it almost begs a visit to the top. The fact that you can go up is a plus. We took the advice of people who suggested we bought a 20 dollar ticket each for a trip up 57 floors to the top which is then redeemable against a cocktail which will cost you a little more, but it will give you a good excuse to linger longer and take in the view. We went about 7.30 pm which was too late for sunset but in time for the light show. The problem was the terrace was mobbed and so it all felt a bit cramped. People ate generally good about letting others in to take photos."
,,Great panoramic view of Singapore,4.0,,"We enjoyed going up to see a panoramic view of Singapore. It was good to see all of the city to put all the locations in perspective.
It’s not exactly a cheap thing to do. For 2 adults and 1 kid it came to $64 SGD. For that you only get access to the roof. The pool is only for hotel guests. There is a restaurant but it must be accessed from the hotel lobby."
,,Rooftop drink.,4.0,,We visited this hotel to go up to the roof for the views and the experience. We found it better value to pay to go to the bar viewing platform where you could also sit and get a drink and food. It's a must do whilst in Singapore but I sort of feel that just looking at the architecture of the hotel from the ground is just as impressive as going up to the top. The ideal scenario of course would be to stay here! £££
,,Ooh Heaven please take me back to Singapore,5.0,,"The Bay Sand you never visited Singapore if you haven't been to the top of Marina Bay.. For clubbing, chilling in the pool and jacuzzi the building its so well structured one would manage to see almost the whole of Singapore from above"
,,Over the top!,4.0,,Amazing building architecture with a large 'ship' over the top of three tall buildings. Literally over the top compared to other more serious tourist attractions in Singapore!
,,Absolutely Perfect,5.0,,"We had drinks on the 57th floor over looking Singapore for our 35th Wedding Anniversary just perfect back drop, thank you Singapore"
,,Not impressed,3.0,,"Not impressed - felt ripped off. When you pay your money and get up there, there is a wee juice kiosk. No seats, no shade. The complimentary photos are far from complimentary! It was hot when we went up, so we thought we would have a drink at the bar. However, if you cross over the step to the bar you are not allowed back into the observation deck. If you think you are going to see the famous pool, then think again - residents only. The view from the skywalk in the gardens by the bay was much more entertaining!"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,This is a brilliant piece of architecture & Innovation to attract tourists . The ship at the 56th floor of the 3 buildings with an amazing view of Singapore is mind boggling- a must visit by tourists
,,Last minute run,4.0,,"Had to go on a last minute run to the 57th flr.

The view was amazing. It was higher than the Singapore flyer. Best time to go there is night time and with no rain. Its open till 11pm but final sale of tickets is till 10pm only. An hour is more than enough to take photos at the deck. Too bad they closed the pool area exclusively for hotel guests.

Get your souvenir pennies here. There's one near the elevator exit."
,,Over-rated,3.0,,"I'm surprised at all the ""five star"" comments. OK, the views are good, but the experience is not spectacular. The viewing area is not that big and will not take you that long. You can't get beyond the observation deck unless you are a hotel guest."
,,An unforgettable first date!!,5.0,,"Went with my boyfriend and it was such a pleasant view for our first date in Singapore!!! Maybe wear a jacket for those we plan to come because it gets chilly and windy at night we went there around 5pm. The souvenir pictures were damn expensive so I cancelled it in not gonna pay $70 for a picture.. but other than that, you should definitely come here at least once. you get to see the whole of Singapore and it was mesmerising!"
,,My Entrance to Singapore!!,5.0,,"I loved this deck on the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and mall. It is hot, so go early or go late. But you have nearly a 360 degree view of Singapore. It is definitely worth a couple of hours and the cost of the ticket. I took many pictures and I even got one taken of me for my travelogues to my friends. It made a perfect place for me to begin my sightseeing of Singapore. Do go and see the entire area that this island country inhabits. Beautiful!"

,,Great experience,5.0,,"The marina bay sands hotel is an experience in itself with fabulous architecture cafes and shops. Top tip is to visit the sky deck first this costs 20$ access to the sky bar is then free. In the hotel you will be offered to visit the exclusive sky bar for $20 but you would not have access to the sky deck.
Outstanding views from all sides."
,,Greeeeeeaaaat vieeeeeeeeews,5.0,,Enjoyed at 57 floor views marvellous beautiful singapore . Enjoyed too much . Every thing well organised . My children enjoyed too mucch. Me also . Pictures pictures n pictures.
,,Visit to the swimming pool at the top of the hotel,5.0,,"On the ground floor of the hotel you can purchase a ticket for 20 dollars that takes you to the 57th floor the viewing terrace, the ticket can be exchanged for a pint of larger or a cocktail there is comfortable seating where you can relax and take in the view of the city and of the swimming pool that sits on the top of the hotel. The hotel can be reached by public transport we used the hop on hop off bus as it stops outside the entrance. Definitely worth a visit while in Singapore"
,,Great view of city,5.0,,Bring an umbrella. Not for the rain. But for the sun. It is hot up there and not much shade. But the views are breathtaking.
,,Great views of City,5.0,,"if you select the bar to visit rather than the observation deck it cost $20 each, but you get a voucher for $20 each to spend at the bar which is a great setting to relax and watch the world go by from this vantage point."
,,Lots of queuing,3.0,,The view from the top of the Skylark is very good but there is a long queue to get to the top and a long queue to come back down.
,,360 degree view,5.0,,"fabulous experience, got to see bits of the hotel on the way up. the viewing deck is massive plenty of space to see the views all round singapore."
,,Spectacular view,4.0,,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel early 2017.
Enjoyed the hotel and what it has to offer for a day and a half. The Skypark is a must to visit preferably both during daytime and if possible during night time as well just to experience the difference in the surroundings and the ambieance."
,,That 360 degree view,4.0,,56th floor Provides great view of city and sea but if you are scared of heights this will not be for you. Only disappoint was no where to siting view deck to eat ice cream or grab a drink. Also no shade so will melt in the heat! For this reason only stayed 20 mins
,,Great Views of Singapore from here,5.0,,"Took the elevator to the top,the 57th floor. Had a great table for the 4 of us in the Bar. Ordered 4 Singapore Slings which only cost us $27 each Just had to do this while in Singapore up here cause Raffels(originator of the Singapore Sling) was going under renovations and this bar is next on the list in my opinion. Spectacular views of the city and ocean around Singapore. Do this on a sunny day. We did & then a rain came. The large table umbrella protected us from the sun & then the rain. Other spots were open to both and when the rain came there was a great shuffleing of tables & chairs to get protection. It was a great experience. Worth the expense."
,,Fabulous Experience,5.0,,"Visited with family after seeing the Gardens by the Bay and what an experience. The views are amazing and not for the faint hearted as you are pretty high up. Having said that, if anyone suffers from a little bit of vertigo, it does get easier and by the time we had bought a drink, it was plain sailing! To see so far and take in all the night lights of Singapore will remain with us for a very long time, don't miss it,"
,,Fab views!,5.0,,"Well organised and easy to find from hotel lobby. Maybe i was lucky but we didn’t have to queue for tickets or for a lift. Views are amazing and worth a visit. We went up around midday.
Souvenir pics were actually quite nice and I ended up buying one.
All in all a must do in Singapore"
,,Great views but at a price,4.0,,"The skypark offers exceptional views over Singapore but at $23 it isn't cheap. Also, there is no seating and no food. For a better option go to Ce La Vi (it should be C'est la vie). The entrance fee is only $20 and this is refundable on drinks and food. The views are just as good and you can relax over drinks. The downside is the horrendous prices for drinks (but that's Singapore). The entrance is at the end of Block 3 lobby just before the skypark escalator entrance."
,,"we loved looking at the view from our hotel but this place, not that great",3.0,,"we enjoyed taking photos of this place and gazing at its amazing structure from our hotel, Mandarine Oriental..as we could see this from our room. However, I didnt like it as we entered..so large, very clinical..not a friendly place..Im glad we didn't actually stay in here...we went to the restaurant at the top to get the view..view, amazing..restaurant...so so..not that great ..you cannot get to the bar area or pool unless you stay there..all controlled by barriers and tickets..you feel like you are in a theme park or vegas or something..not great"
,,I like more,5.0,,I'm very happy . And awesome felling about this place. I want coming more time to Singapure city . And I invited to you and your family
,,Set your expectations ...,3.0,,"Yes, it provides an amazing view of both the city and the many ships parked out in the bay. However, you can only access the front quarter of the overall park, with the rest exclusive to hotel guests, including the long infinity pool which you can hardly see!
There is one refreshment stall but nowhere to sit and limited options in the shade.
Yes, you can visit the CeLaVi bar but prices are extortionate (S$23 for a cocktail, S$8 for a plate of chips!) but there’s no guarantee of shade and no re-entry to the skypark.
So, make sure you’re ok to pay the cost for the great views and a large bar bill!"
,,What a view,5.0,,We visited on our first nght in Singapore and watched the light show which is really great and in my opinion a must see. Even without the added bonus of the light show the place is great and the sight of all the buildings and lights at night is great. We returned during the day as well and even without the lights it is really great and well worth the visit.
,,Great views,4.0,,"This is well worth a visit albeit a bit expensive. A beer is about $15 US! Don't bother watching the light show from up here though, it looks tiny! Watch that from the promenade downstairs."
,,Amazing Structure,4.0,,"This hotel is vast, I wanted to see it after it was featured on tv with Giles Coren. There is an infinity pool at the top which I managed to see, very impressive. There is a charge to go to the top, the views are magnificent. Worth seeing, expensive to stay at the hotel and just too big for me but quite something."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Every where we looked we wow we thought we gave to go up the top for a look & we did just amazing sitting on a surf board 57 stories up, highly reccommend"
,,Beautiful view - icon of Singapore,4.0,,Came here with a foreign guest to show one of the significant icon of Singapore. Went to the Spago bistro for drink and view the surrounding. It was so beautiful and windy especially this time of the year. I have a chance to come early to have a daytime view and nighttime view before my dinner. It was beautiful to see the S’pore coastal lines. On the other side you probably would see the famous infinity pool. Worth a visit and get chill out at the SkyPark!
,,Good view,5.0,,I went there with my friend. She bought the tickets including a drink. It was really nice to see the view and sun set.
,,Beatiful view.,5.0,,"Beautiful view from the 57th floor. It deserves two visits, day and night. Access to the venue is in Tower 3 of the Hotel. It is free. There is a bar and nightclub open to all, regardless of being a guest."
,,Top view of Singapore,4.0,,"Very well made Hotel with observation deck, good views and amazing place to spend time. You can easily spend 2 hrs. Good view of the gardens from top. Connected by MRT"
,,A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE CITY,4.0,,"I did not stay at this hotel, but it is worth visiting. The upper floor with the view and the amazing pool is worthwhile. You pay for the entrance, but it will be discounted if you stay and drink a cocktail or eat something."
,,Easily the best of Singapore!,5.0,,"You know how sometimes you get so focused on sightseeing that you miss actually feeling the vibe of a certain place? Well, the Marina bay will offer you the opportunity you have been looking for to just kick back, relax and take in the breathtaking views of Singapore. Definitely worth the money! I would suggest going during the day, in order to enjoy the views from the top deck and pin point your next destination."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Head to the bar at Marina Bay Sands for a great view over Singapore from 57 floors up. Redeem entry voucher for a cocktail or beer, great way to spend a Sunday afternoon
You can check out the pool but cannot swim unless you stay at MBS"
,,"Worth the entrance tickets to get the amazing 360 degree view (covering Singapore Flyer, Garden by the Bay, Downtown)",5.0,,"After exiting the Bayfront MRT station, we made our way to Marina Bay Sands Skypark Observation Deck ticketing. The tickets were $23 SGD for adults and $17 SGD for seniors. A quick elevator ride up the building and we were soon at the top.

You get an amazing 360 degree view to see the Gardens by the bay, Singapore Flyer, Merlion Park in the distance, Singapore Downtown and the Harbor. Must do if you are in Singapore."
,,Amazing Skyline Centerpiece,5.0,,"Just as the pictures depict, this is a 57 story, three tower structure with a very long arc like structure on top. The building houses a hotel and mall. There are many restaurants throughout.

On the roof top ""boat"" there are several more restaurants and bars, each with a dramatic view of Singapore. There is also the famous infinity pool where you can seemingly swim right up to the edge, again 57 stories above Singapore. One note, you have to be a guest of the hotel to access the pool area.

There is a 20+ dollar admission fee to go up to the observation area or one of the bars. You get that back on your bar tab. You don't have to pay this fee if you have a reservation at one of the rooftop restaurants."
,,on the bucket list,4.0,,"I wanted to go here for a glass of wine from first knowing that I was going to Singapore.
it is $20 admission to the 57th floor and you can claim tis back against a drink this is just as well as bottle of very average red plonk set us back £105 !!!
Fantastic views and good if you can include the sunset and then see all the lights coming on"
,,Superb view,5.0,,A must visit place when u r in singapore....it is observation desk on the top of marina bay sands hotel...u will get stunning view of Singapore from here....try to visit at night so u can enjoy lighting...u can see whole singapore from here...other side there is infinity pool but only hotel guests r allowed to visit it...
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Great place to visit, gorgeous photo op for picture taking, aweome surroundings for exercise fun and/or for just a walk!"
,,Opulence,5.0,,"Sheer luxury, from the shopping mall below, which is like a small village, to the hotel swimming pool and viewing deck on the rooftop which offers the best views over Singapore"
,,Impressive,4.0,,We paid the $20 to go up to the top but was disappointed that this did not include the observation area. We had drinks and watched the light show which was lovely and the hotel it's self looked very impressive especially in infinity pool which looked out over Singapore. Woild consider staying in this hotel.
,,NIGHT TIME,5.0,,"We took a tour of which this was a part of, with a visit in the evening. Full 360 view of Singapore. Worth the visit. Cost on its own is not overly expensive, however we were advised that you adivse the Lift Staff you are going to the restuarant for a drink. No charge except the cost of the drink."
,,The Soul of Singapore,5.0,,"The Marina is simply the icon of Singapore. It’s a master piece. It was my second time there, and it felt like my first time. I walked around for hours at night, alongside thousands of other tourists. If you are in Singapore and you haven’t been here, then you don’t know the soul of Singapore."
,,Incredible views,5.0,,"We visited this hotel as it is right next to the Gardens. For 20 dollars you can take the lift to floor 57 where the pool and bars are situated. The views are amazing, especially over the bay where ships wait to enter port. Your entry fee can be redeemed against food or drinks at the bar. Unmissable."
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,"From 56 floors up the observation deck of this boat in the sky offers 360 degree panorama of the Marina Bay Area, CBD, Gardens By the Bay and the Straits of Singapore. Not cheap but you are rewarded with an unrivalled view of the city"
,,"""Marina Bay Sands""",5.0,,Marina bay sands is a MUST. We didn't stay at the hotel but we went up for the view to the observary deck. The best view any way you look.
,,Fantastic place to visit for stunning views of Singapore,5.0,,"Id seen this hotel on the TV a few times and I definitely wanted to go and visit...It costs 20 Singapore Dollars for the elevator to the top where you are treated to stunning views across Singapore. You keep your ticket from the elevator because its acts as credit off food and drink from the bar next to the amazing Infinity pool.
The guests at the Marina Bay pay a premium for staying there no doubt and I personally wouldnt want to stay there and have people gawping at you from a bar area next to the pool. Although it has to be said... Many guests simply enjoy the exposure!!
Drinks and food are not cheap here either like most things in Singapore..But you have to remember that you are paying for an experience that is not to be missed whilst you here in Singapore. Of a choice of going to the Raffles or the marina Bay. The Marina Bay Skypark would win every time!! Definitely worth a visit!!"
,,Biggest outdoor swimming pool I have ever seen,5.0,,Well marina Bay Sands Skypark is one of its own kind of park in the sky. But to be very honest I love the park swimming pool which is on the top of three towers. Initially I was bit worry to go into the water but trust me if you go into the water you will not like come out from it. Must try place in Singapore.
,,Must see attraction,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel is featured on any hotel program about high end hotels so if you haven’t heard of it you you don’t watch tv.
The sky park has one of the best views over Singapore and looks down over Marina Bay.
You have to pay $20 to get up there but you get the money off a drink or food so don’t worry about the cover charge.
If you time it well you will see the laser show in the bay.
All of your friends will be jealous.
Would definitely go back."
,,Cool sight. U have to see the sunset,5.0,,"I paid something about 25 dollar to enter the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands. You will find there a bar and the possibility to sit down.
I met there a lot of friendly persons.
You have a incredible view over Singapore and at the botanic gardens. My highlight was to observe the sunset. For me a Must if you visit Singapore."
,,A feat of modern man,5.0,,"We’re having the final day of a month long holiday and I can think of no better way to finish it than by having a cocktail in the Sky Bar of this amazing hotel.
The design and architecture is astounding from outside and inside. But then an express lift takes you to the 57th floor and the views are breathtaking.
Enjoy!"
,,Great views,4.0,,"I prefer the 1-Altitude at night, but this is the better option with kids. Also has superior view of Gardens by the Bay. I think it a bit expensive (with the 1-Altidude including a drinks package to make it better value)"
,,Simply spectacular,5.0,,You must take yourself to the 57th floor and enjoy a drink overlooking the AMAZING Singapore skyline. Nothing like it! Cocktails start around $23 - not cheap but worth the trip experience. Go in the evening for sure and leave the kids at home!
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"A definite must-do when in Singapore because of the amazing views and just because it is such an iconic building. A couple of things to note, that the entrance fee (around $SGD23 pp) gets you to the top but not the infinity pool which is only open to guests of the hotel. There is little shelter up on the top so if it is raining, windy or really sunny you should dress accordingly. Also it is quite hazy so if you are looking for a spectacular clear view of the horizon, you'd be best getting a photo off the internet. There is a souvenir shop and ice cream stall and small restaurant. Check opening times for the restaurant as it wasn't open when we went in the morning. Also, it is a hugely popular destination so best to go outside peak times so you can easily wander and enjoy without hoards of tourists taking pictures. Would recommend going twice (if you were prepared to pay the fee twice) as it is amazing looking around the city in the daytime but also with the lights at night it is stunning. Great picture, map and information boards around helping you understand the history of what you are seeing. A typical tourist spot but for a reason, it is fantastic!"
,,To many people,3.0,,The building itself is impressive but except from seeing how it was inside you can perfectly enjoy the beauty of the architecture from outside.
,,WOW,5.0,,"Well the place itself as Hotel is not cheap, but you can manage to visit wright to the top level the terrace, so you can have a full view of the entire Singapore.
The pool is only for the guest, but you can have breakfast, brunch or diner at some restaurants inside.
You must visit Marina Bay.

Enjoy"
,,You have to see it to believe it !,5.0,,"This really has got the Wow Factor big time, it dominates the skyline of Singapore's Marina Bay. It is a totally unique concept in design, offers panoramic views of the whole area, it's a World-Beater of an hotel, it offers so much in every aspect of what a Hotel should be, High Standards in every aspect."
,,Majestic place,5.0,,Just passed through their lobby for water and laser show and found it to be absolutely majestic. Will stay here next time.
,,Really nice location,5.0,,"We visit the Skypark and the restaurant, which were very beautiful, with a amazing view from the top."
,,Expensive Rip Off,1.0,,"On a 3 day return visit to Singapore, one attraction we felt we had to experience was the Sands Skypark Observation Deck. After purchasing a ticket for $23 each we were informed that we would only be allowed on a small part of the deck. It was not crowded except for the restaurant/bar so viewing and photography was done in comfort, apart from that it’s not an attraction I would return to, the ticket enables you to get 10% of another $50 spend in the retail shops, all in all a total rip off, save your money."
,,Terrific Views of Singapore !,5.0,,"The observation deck and the Ce La Vie Skybar were definitely worth the visit. Iconic hotel. I think the $20 ticket is to deter the experience being spoilt by attracting too many people and cramming the deck ?
Very good cocktails enjoyed on a memorable experience."
,,Excelkent,5.0,,Kids friendly. Scenic n enjoyable!! TrAnsport is great as well with the mrt right at the hotel. Overall highly recommend.
,,Beautiful Hotel..... But !,4.0,,"I've stayed in a lot of 5 star hotels in asia and the middle east. This was nothing special to be honest except the rooftop pool, bar, restaurant and observation deck. The interior of the hotel is very nice, but always busy and you feel a certain lack of privacy (hard to explain) but its never 'your' hotel. Its full of day visitors.

There are 3 towers, I stayed in tower 2 which had 6 lifts but there was always a queue, you usually got in but it did take time. There are 55 floors and the lifts are very quick but obviously they do stop on the way up or down with people getting on and off. Tower 2 is also the way to the observation deck for visitors so maybe that's why it was so busy.

The food was nice. I ate breakfast in Spago and Club 55. There was queue for breakfast at every restaurant serving breakfast the 3 mornings I was there. I went for breakfast at 7.30, hardly rush hour, but still a queue of around 15 people waiting at each restaurant. As I was staying on the club floor I went to Club 55 (No queue) and ate there most of the time. Standing in line to eat is not my idea of fun.

The room was large, including the bathroom with double sinks.

The ONLY REASON I wanted to stay here was the pool and that view. The biggest disappointment by far however was the pool. The prices at the pool area were quite reasonable for Singapore but the pool, although larger than I expected, was a HUGE disappointment. It was freezing cold. The weather during my stay was 29/30 degrees and at lunchtime the pool temperature was 22 degress. I found this to be totally unacceptable and it spoiled my whole experience. I can’t imagine why a 5* Hotel would not have a heated pool unless they don’t want people hanging around up there. It was a very long pool, i’d estimate 7m x 70m yet the most people I counted in there at any one time was 20. There are lots of sun beds, it was never full up there so you could always get a spot but considering all this I’d say 80% of the people up there WERE NOT in the pool. There is a smaller garden area overlooking the gardens by the bay at the rear with 2 semi circlular shaped hot jacuzzis. They are placed up against glass panels so you can sit there with a great view. If you want the view, just pay to visit the observation deck and stay elsewhere."
,,Only worth the View,4.0,,"$20 to get in and then you get a Complimentary $20 Voucher? You do the maths. So all of the cocktails were above $20 so you end of paying more for the experience plus the service tax on top of it. If your lucky you can get a spot outside but If your unlucky like us you fight to get a seat then feel like your just sitting in a bar drinking expensive cocktails for the purpose of perhaps getting a photo of the outside without having to bustle past someones little swairee, to get a pic. The Views are of Course outstanding If you can get close enough to the glass. there are so may tables jammed packed up to the sides you can barely get a look in."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Paid $20 to go up but that was redeemable towards price of a drink. Amazing views and beautiful surroundings. Service was excellent.
,,Good view from top,2.0,,Good view from the top but not good value costing $S20 to go up in the elevator. Cost of two drinks at the bar very expensive and no access to view the infinity pool for a look. Not a place I would revisit when in Singapore again. Staff not very helpful when compared to other venues.
,,Up high!,5.0,,"We went up the 56 floors in 45 seconds and 200 metres high to the observation floor in the dark, was amazing!!"
,,Great View of Singapore,5.0,,"Set in the downtown area of Singapore, next to the Gardens By the Bay, is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel complex. ON top of the hotel (56th floor) is the Skypark attraction which is an overlook platform, shaped like a boat, that allows viewing of Singapore and the surrounding area. This is a must see attraction when you are in Singapore. An even better view is provided on the 57th floor at the Ce La Vi Restaurant but you will have to buy lunch or at least a drink at the bar. This access also allows you to view the fantastic infinity pool available for the hotel guests."
,,Amazing viewpoint,5.0,,"Cost Sing$20 (pensioner rate :-) ) to get the lift up 54 levels to the observation deck - went up just before sunset and it was amazing to see the sun go down and all the lights coming on on the buildings - Singapore has quite a city skyline!

Spent a long time just going round and round the deck - there is a glass/perspex wall with a gap for cameras (the gap is most, not all of the way round). Use of tripods is not allowed.

Great experience - highly recommended (but probably not during the heat of the day)"
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"20 Singapore dollars gets you the best view of Singapore. Once you have taken in the breath-taking views, visit the Ce La Vi bar and enjoy a very pleasant drink at the highest bar in the city."
,,Fantastic Sunset,5.0,,"An amazing hotel complex. Entry fee is reasonable, understandably the drinks etc are on the expensive side, but the views are unbelievable. Go up there early evening in time to catch the sunset - fantastic."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,It is worth paying the money to see the views of Singapore. You can go in the hotel to see the pool but there is a small area where you can peep round.
,,Amaizing show,5.0,,If you are in singapore you should not miss the light and sound show. It's amazing to see lying on the grass it's fantastic. Go early to catch a good spot.
,,Great bar,5.0,,"Great music, mostly tourists, great atmosphere, drinks were only ok. Pricey and they skimp on the alcohol :( Wonderful View!"
,,Excellent Skyline View,5.0,,"This place is a must visit when in Singapore for its amazing skyline views. Its on 58th floor and ticket costs around 21-23 SGD. From the top one can the gardens by the bay light show, singapore flyer, merlion park and marina bay water lazer show."
,,Worth it for the view,5.0,,Great place to have a look at the beautiful view Singapore offers. At night all the lights make it very special. Free of charge to go up to the deck where the restaurant is.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,"We took a taxi to Marine Sands, very easy to buy tickets to the skypark
Up in the lift to a most magnificent view around , out to sea to see all of the cargo ships waiting to dock, looking down onto the beautiful gardens by the bay to see all of the beautiful trees ,over the skyline of Singapore’s Buildings
Just so worth the effort of going, also a beautiful breeze to cool you off"
,,wonderful,2.0,,"Beautiful place, nice and clean can spend lots whole day in there. plenty of shops and restaurants, great view of whole Singapore."
,,Views,4.0,,"A short que for tickets then up to the top, fabulous views of the Singapore skyline and the harbour. Unfortunately you can not go to the infinity pool if you are not a guest but well worth the trip. There is a bar and a small shop at the top."
,,Great view,5.0,,Amazing view of the city and lovely bar with a good atmosphere. Drinks are expensive but not extortionate
,,read the reviews...there all positive,5.0,,read the reviews...there all positive for a reason....great everything...including massive views...massive shopping bellow....great relaxing drinks or a swim [if booked into hotel] and staff are always happy to please
,,Great View of Singapore!,4.0,,"The Skypark view is worth doing. If you aren’t staying there, you can still enjoy the spectacular view for about $25. There are a couple of options, depending on whether you wish to have a drink while you are taking in the view. We opted to go without the drink. This hotel and the Skypark are Singapore must dos. They sell the tickets at a desk in the lowest level. They escort you up in the elevator and then let you walk around the sky deck as much as you wish. The view across the Malacca Strait and the city are worth seeing. You can stay as long as you want, but we were ready to go down after about 30 minutes. It was definitely worth it."
,,Beautiful sunset,5.0,,One of the amazig place u most see. If u want to go view u buy a ticket 30 SGD and u go to floor 56 by elevator if u want go to bar and resturant u most wear dress code and pay extra 20SGD .U can't swim by the way the pool just for the hotel guest
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"Fantastic Birdseye view of Singapore. We started by going up to the cafe, as some reviewers recommended. It wasn’t nearly as good as the view from the Skypark platform. We went up an hour before sunset and stayed until it became dark."
,,A great View,5.0,,Gave us a great perspective of Singapore and an appreciation of the number of ships that use the port. We thought the photos taken before you go up the elevator were a bit of a scam but I guess that is tourism. Definitely worth doing
,,Nice view,4.0,,Roof TOP of MBS hotel. Clear 360 view of the surrounding areas. Good spot for picture taking. Can be crowded during weekend. With infinity pool - good relaxing place for hotel guests.
,,No better view,3.0,,"Looking at this building is absolutely incredible and the view from the top will be the best view you get of the city.
As you can expect it was very busy with tourists all scrambling to get a good photo and fighting for a table. Girls at reception were lovely although our waiter didn’t really seem to care with us having to wait about 15/20 minutes just to get our card back after we had paid.
It’s worth going up there to say you’ve done it but I wouldn’t enjoy spending an evening here."
,,Spectacular Experience,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful and Most Famous ""Infinity Pools"" in all the World! Staying here is a feast for the senses from the gourmet food to the one-of-a-kind sights. A true Life Experience for all!"
,,Fantastic view of Singapor,4.0,,Fantastic view of Singapore. Suitable for all age groups. Easy access from Marina Sands Hotel level 56.
,,Good views,4.0,,Even though we visited during the busy pre-Christmas period but during the day. We didn't have any issues with crowds. The view from the ground looking up at the Marina Bay Sands building at night is pretty - it's illuminated and the colours change. We took some good photos from the Marina Bay Gardens.
,,How’s the serenity!,5.0,,"It will cost you $20 each to go to the roof top bar but it’s worth it. You can use the $20 entry as a credit towards drinks & food once you are up there so not a big deal.
The view is amazing.
It can get windy up there but never cold. The roof top bar has a good vibe so great for the end of a big day being a tourist.
Try the Singapore Fling-frozen version of the original Sling really refreshing!!"
,,Quick drink on hot day,4.0,,Yes this has not to be missed. Views are amazing. Had gone up. Around 3 in afternoon loverly You can see fit miles on good clear day Nice bar drinks great Give it a go
,,Over-rated and over hyped,3.0,,"While there is little debate that the pool and skydeck are amazing, the actual hotel is at best average. The rooms are nothing special and as a guest, it is hard not to feel like a number. There are better, less crowded and more affordable boutique hotels around to choose from..."
,,Unbelievable views well worth the effort,5.0,,We stayed in the hotel and enjoyed the views for a few nights. The restaurants in the building are expensive but get a drink up top is well worth it.
,,Best view in Singapore 🇸🇬 for only $40,5.0,,What at wonderful view from one of the wonders of the modern world - a ship in the sky! Take a trip up to the sky park and enjoy the fantastic view of Singapore and the harbour -busiest container port on the planet. Have a drink and literally drink in the view it’s spectacular and worth every penny.
,,Amazing,4.0,,"The hotel is amazing so iconic Singapore. Easy to get to on the MRT, the ride to the top( payable) takes nano seconds once you get there the views are breathtaking."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"Entry via Tower 2. Take the lift to the 55 floor then walk through to get the next lift to the 57 the floor. No charges or fees to pay.

We visited when two cruise ships were in town. Impossible to get a table for lunch unless you had booked. We hadn't but reserved a table for later in the afternoon for a drink. No problem.

Amazing views and probably better in the evening to see the lights across the city and the park. We hope to get back for a night time visit.

The bar is not cheap. ....but you wouldn't expect it to be."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,It was a long walk from the MRT to tho Skypark lift through the Marina Bay sand lobby but the view was worth it! What an amazing building is the Marina Bay Sands and what an amazing view of Singapore and the Gardens By The Bay. Loved it.
,,Brilliant views,5.0,,"The Skypark was easy to go up to the top. It had signs explaining and histories of every view points and buildings. Made the Bay Gardens, Trees & Skywalk, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest look small of which they are not.."
,,Simply the Best View in Town,5.0,,"Impressive as it is looking from the bottom up, top down is spectacular. Queezie tummy aside, the viewing deck offers a 360 degree vista of Singapore's skyline. It allows the first time tourist an opportunity to orientate themselves while seeing well known landmarks from a completely different angle. There is a bar that offers delicous cocktails and an assortment of soft drinks and slushies. If you are aflicted with my sweet tooth, try the root beer float. Your ticket allows you access to a rooftop restaurant."
,,Amazing views over Singapore,4.0,,"After walking around the gardens for a couple of hours we decided to go for a beer at Marina Bay Sands. Once at the top you walk into the bar and what an amazing view over Singapore. Staff very friendly and what a great place to kick back enjoy a beer and take in the surroundings.
Must do."
,,Stunning views from the observation deck on floor 56,4.0,,We went up to the observation deck on 2 occasions. Once at night and again in the day. Early mornings there were far few people around. Well worth seeing it on both occasions.
,,Amazing views across Singapore,5.0,,"These hotels are huge, basically a city within a city....however we were there to go up to the observation deck shaped like a ship onto of the 3 towers....

Worth doing though you won't need long to do it. The entrance can be found at the bottom of the 3rd tower with a lift taking you to the top....

You won't need more than an hour but the views are stunning...."
,,"Amazing views, smelly elevator and confused ticketing on ground floor",3.0,,"Was offered two ticket tiers by cashier at lobby, one apparently was to gain a view of the pool, but this was not reality.

A security staff member on the observation deck didn't appear to care or appreciate our simple question seeking clarification....so basically meant to back down and ask the ticket girl. This was an un-Singaporean response in my opinion, and I was somewhat surprised.

The bar was overdosed and split drinks slow to be cleaned up. The bar counter and tables were dirty.

The drinks and pricing were good though, with friendly service from behind counter staff, who were being smashed with orders.

The views are still worth making the effort, but there's definitely room for improvement!"
,,Great views,4.0,,"We visited Marina Bay Sands rooftop bar for cocktails and the views across the bay etc were great. The infinity pool looked interesting and possibly quite thrilling in the day. We found the drinks were similar in price to other hotels and upmarket bars.
Worth a visit..."
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,"Visited the top of this hotel on a three night visit to Singapore. Gets very busy but the entrance process works really well. We visited at dusk, as we love to see the city at night time. We timed it just right and were able to see the views both in daylight and as it turned into evening too. The ticket was part of a combo that included a one day Hop on Hop off bus tour, entrance to the conservatories at Gardens By The Bay and this one. Well worth it. We saw some of the lights show from up here too. Disappointed not to be able to see the lovely swimming pool, but I already knew we weren’t allowed, unless you’re staying here."
,,must see,4.0,,amazing place to see but not to stay. it has amazing views if you choose to go up to the observation area on top or dine at one of the restaurants on top (pricy). over all the hotel is too big it feels like a mall so i wouldn't stay there for my visit i rather stay in fullerton bay hotel where marina bay will be my view.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"We decided to go see the 360° view of the Singapore Skyline in the evening. I'm so glad we saw it when it was dark... as it was absolutely breathtaking! I think it wouldn't have had the massive impact it did if we went to see it during the day.
The ticket to go to the very top of the hotel was 23 Singapore Dollars...which is equivalent to £12.60. It was actually cheap and totally worth it because you can stay there until it closes at 11pm. There is no time and stay restrictions.

As you enter you get a picture taken.. which you can later buy inside.. which was a nice touch!
And as you enter you are hit with the beautiful high rised views.. where you can take your pictures and admire the view of the Lion City.

From above we were able to see the Spectre Laser show and a fireworks display which made the visit that extra special.

Spectacular views that leave you speechless!"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"We visited the bar on the roof top. All the staff were very friendly, made you feel comfortable without feeling too up tight. They have recommendations and tastings for drinks.

The service was next to none, and the cocktails were gorgeous. We didn’t enter the infinity pool but it looks great and the views from all around were amazing"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Expensive but worth the views!! Great to see the whole panorama on a clear day. Snack bar and ice creams for sale too!
,,"Fantastic views, dreadful service...",3.0,,"The views are amazing and well worth a visit but we sat and ordered a Prosecco and after 20 minutes nothing, despite a reminder. Yet the restaurant was virtually empty. We left and went in the mall where our custom was appreciated! :)"
,,Place to enjoy sunset and City View from Rooftop Swimming Pool,5.0,,"Simply Fantastic place where Art of Engineering, Art of Culinary & Hospitality meets. Experience can be beyond your imagination while you are swimming on Rooftop pool. Don't miss your DSLR as you may get awesome Pictures also.
Plase is costly however worth paying, every one must try this.
Place is well connected with other attraction by MRT,BUss & Taxi however on weekend (Night) its little hard to get taxi ."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,At night it takes a marvelous look. One must not miss the laser show around. Highly recommend to visit.
,,Good experience being so high,4.0,,"Nice to see this very modern hotel structure, very busy in the evening as the sun goes down. Lifts are very busy but efficient and fast. We found the souvenir photographs outrageously expensive."
,,Worth taking a trip for the view,4.0,,A very quick lift takes you to the viewing platform however you are unable to see the swimming pool as that is petitioned off for hotel guests. The view over Singapore however is worth making the trip.
,,Travel Goal,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is a great architectural place in Singapore. And this is one of a best viewpoint. Little bit crowded at 6-7 pm. But Skypark visitors not allowed to access to the pool area.
,,Interesting Fusion Food,4.0,,"One thing for sure, the restaurant has awesome views of the Gardens By the Bay. It is a local-fusion food restaurant. The food is simply awesome. Service is exemplary. But it is a pricy place."
,,Magnificent view of Singapore,4.0,,Seeing Singapore from the top is magnificent. Reach the top on a high speed lift 360 degree view of Singapore and a restaurant on the top.
,,Nice views!,4.0,,"This rooftop deck is accessible to the general public and provides stunning views of Singapore and the water! It’s kind of pricey to go up if you’re not staying at the hotel, but if you like a big view, this is the place. And you can stay as long as you want."
,,Great place to spend time in Singapore,4.0,,The views from the top are spectacular. Lots of photo opportunities. Made up for not getting on Singapore flyer as there was a technical issue.
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,Very nice and fantastic views from the TOP of the SkyPark. Must go in the evening and can stay until dark to see the lightings of the city.
,,Wonderful Views,4.0,,"With my heart in my mouth, I agreed to go up to the top of this fabulous hotel with my husband (I don't like heights). We were not residents, so paid 20 Singapore Dollars each. There are clear signs in the main ground floor foyer area explaining where to get the Sky Lifts, which take just seconds to get to the top. There is wooden decking with glass safety panels all the way round, so the views are wonderful. There is a small kiosk selling hot dogs and ice cream on the first level, with a bar selling drinks on a higher level."
,,Unforgettable views,5.0,,Very unforgettable views. Best of all skyparks visited in Asia. When the dark crowds come before the rain also gave very unforgettable views.
,,On top of the world!,5.0,,"$23 per person (March 2018) single entry gets you to the 56th floor and what a view. The Skypark is lovely, such a good vantage point overlooking the City, there is a restaraunt at the top and a snack bar. 1/2 an hour if not eating is enough to soak in the views, well worth the money, excellent."
,,Excellent view,3.0,,"This place is posh and u need $$$ to enjoy. Food and beverages are of fine dine price, but the view is excellent. On one side the city and bay view. The other is of garden and sea view.

On rainy days, a light jacket is useful."
,,Is It Worth It?,3.0,,If it was only about the view ... well its 5+ Stars. Its expensive to get to the top and the Skypark itself is in a limited area if you are not a guest of the hotel. Its very busy and the line is long especially in the evening when we went. The top is crowded and there is plenty of hustle and bustle. We had a drink in the bar at the top which was nice but all in all .... apart from the view it was a pretty frustrating experience.
,,MBS: a must stop while in Singapore!!,5.0,,While in Singapore don’t forget to head out to Marina Bay Sand Hotel for a view of the city from it’s topfloor. Either visit the bar or one of the restaurants. For it’s unique character restaurant prices were quite ok. I bring all visitors here (the other Must Visit being the unbeatable No Signboard Seafood restaurant in Gaylang for the Black Pepper Crab).
,,Iconic,5.0,,Although we did not stay in the hotel we did did visit the sky bar for a few hours. It cost 20 Singapore dollars to use it and you have to purchase at least one drink but it is so worth it for the view of Singapore. Like everywhere in Singapore the standard is high and the place is spotless. The staff are very friendly and speak good English. There is an amazing infinity pool at the top though I think it may be for residents only - must be amazing to swim with a view! Prices are expensive compared to England but how often to you get to experience these views and service. The view over the marina bay gardens is great and you will want to visit those after seeing them from above- do it you will not be disappointed!
,,Hell of a view,5.0,,The 2nd best thing to experience this hotel because the 1st best thing is to be a guests and enjoy the infinity pool at the rooftop. That would set you back $600/night.
,,Infinity pool is unique,4.0,,"I loved the pool there, feeling so higher and catch up some amazing photos around with skyscrapers. If you are lucky enough to go there when is not crowded you will enjoy it.
The rooms won’t get you out of your head, are normal as usual, there was one think that I really hated!!!!
Air con- No possible to manage it.
With the door closed, automatic the air con switched on really lower degree, with the door opened, the air con just switched off."
,,Magnificent structure,4.0,,Fabulous view over marina and downtown spreading right across the island Go to the bar on level 57 for the same great view for the price of an expensive drink We paid $30 for a small tiger and a lime soft drink
,,The best view of Singapore.,5.0,,"On a sunny day, I recommend going up to the sky park which is located on the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel. It is pricey S$23 but you can stay as long as you want and enjoy ocean, bay and the city view. Do not buy the photo of yourself they take in the beginning and try to sell you. It’s S$60 and has no value. Just take your own photos. No access to the hotel’s rooftop infinity pool."
,,Amazing views and rooftop bar,5.0,,"There are two options for non guests at the hotel. The sky deck or the Ce la Vi Restaurent and Bar Deck.

I recommend the Bar Deck for adults. $20 Sing for entry and this is a credit amount to the bar. Dring’s however start at about $20SG so it’s one drink included.

Staff could be more friendly and it made us feel like they just wanted our money and tips even thought we were spending quite a lot, it took them a while to figure that out and only offered us a great table when we were half way through the visit."
,,"Great hotel, but pricey",4.0,,"Stayed here for one night for the views and pool. One night here was the same cost for three nights elsewhere in town, but we splurged for the pool."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"Wife and I went up the Skypark and were amazed at the views over Marina Bay Gardens, The Business area of Singapore and Singapore City .Well worth going up to the top. Bar at top very expensive. Great light show at night."
,,Best views in town,5.0,,Simply the best views of this amazing city. I think the night time view is the best and also a bit cooler at night. The wait to get down can be quite long but you move along quickly enough. Finish it off with a walk over to the lake side and watch the magical fountain show.
,,"Endless pool,perfect city view",5.0,,"This hotel is one Of Thé best ı ever see.wonderful design,location and stay,this hotel is the referans of singapore value"
,,Stunning and breathtaking,4.0,,Took the lift to the sky viewing deck and were were blown away by the breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline 365 degrees . A wonderful sight at night time . The bar up there does a frozen Singapore sling which we also enjoyed . No one should miss the view from up there
,,QB,5.0,,It was superb. The views were amazing. Staff friendly n helpful. The laser show was brilliant. Food was excellent
,,Over rated,3.0,,Firstly to visit the sky bar for the views it cost $20 each included is a drink. What they didn't tell you is that tax is added on top . Most drinks were over $20 . we had two drinks so handed in our 2 $20 vouchers thinking we only had to add a few dollars extra but no !! the bill was $54 so we had to add $14 .Then unless you are staying as a guest at the Hotel you are only entitled to view from certain points which are not the best views over Singapore. Very disappointed as we have visited sky bars all over the world and this one has to be the biggest con .
,,Landmark in itself!,5.0,,"Singapore is a tourist city and many options to see around..Marina bay is one of them..you can see draft.at night daily they have led light shows daily at 9pm for 8-10 min to be watched free for all.The music,lughts and fountain all in rhythm and one if attractions ..Being a famous city for marine..the structure top floor ie 52 floor is in shape of marine and is pub CE LA VI with awesome view."
,,Marvellous,5.0,,This stop is a must if your visiting Singapore! The building itself is incredible and there are fantastic views. There is a nice restaurant upstairs too although we did not eat there.
,,Stunning views!,5.0,,"We are lucky enough to be staying at the hotel but enjoyed the views of the skypark, none the less! Views of both the gardens , ocean and city."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"This is a paradise for photographers. I think specially after the sunset, when all colourfull lights in the city are on. The view is astonishing"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Come here for the view and a cocktail. Quite pricey and busy but worth it for the skyline. Bartenders nice. Cocktails were yummy!
,,Great views over the city,4.0,,"The viewing platform (which is on the front end of ""the Ship"") is large and gives panoramic views over Marina Bay, the financial district and the city centre. With the Singapore non-Flyer out of action - gives the best views of the city. The fee of S$20+ is not cheap but the views are worth it. The platform is large and open with little shade. there is a kiosk selling drinks and ice cream etc.
You can get sneaky views of the hotel's infinity swimming pool round the partitions."
,,Such an amazing place staff very couteousroons were very spacious and well equipped,5.0,,If in Singapore you much try to visit this hotel. From Swimming poolyou get a magnificent view of the city .try to make it up there fir the sun set. Some amazj g restuarants too
,,Big Tourist Draw,5.0,,This city is basically built for tourists and this is its pinnacle. Obviously this was built by a US billionaire so it has everything from a massive casino to likely the best views of the city at sunset. I would take advantage of having a drink at sunset at the rooftop bar and rushing to watch the laser show down below shortly after. If you can afford to stay here then the infinity pool looked great. The same goes for shopping; the least expensive stores are likely Rolex and Prada and that should give you an idea of the wealth that this attracts. It’s still worth it and you should take the time to count the Lamborghinis as I found it rather entertaining.
,,Beautiful Sunset Viewing terrace,4.0,,The sight from this 57th floor is great and you can see the changing colours of the sky as the sun sets and the buildings light up. Most happening place with a DJ and a well run bar
,,You pay to view,4.0,,"You will need to pay if you just want to take in the view rather than eat in one of the roof top restaurants. Go for it as the views are worth it. There is often a queue.
The main ground floor concours of the Mania Bay is hectic with guests find they way around and tourists just coming to gaze. There is no avoiding it and the whole place looks disorganised."
,,Nothing to see,1.0,,"If you are not planning to pay a lot of money to visit the top floor, this is just a huge hotel and not worth going to."
,,Sands Skypark,5.0,,"MRT to Bayfront walk tower 2 could not actually find a sign for tickets so asked 23$S no cover so make sure not raining, fabulous view, these buildings paid themselves off in 5yrs."
,,Expensive but well worth pushing the boat out for.,4.0,,"Very very busy concourse and lots of people there just to look and experience this hotel with a difference. Pay the money and go to the top to enjoy the infinity pool that looks out over Singapore from a ""ship in the Sky""..."
,,Busy! Busy! Busy! But great views of the city.,5.0,,"Maybe it was so busy because of the Chinese New Year, but the queues to buy a ticket and then to get up to the viewing platform were horrendous. The views from the top are worth the wait, but if you can go outside the holiday period, I am sure it would be a much more pleasant experience."
,,Excellent view of the city and bay.,3.0,,Years ago a trip to the top included the infinity pool. That has changed. It is sad because the pool was a top destination for a photo shoot. It is a hefty cost to get to the top.
,,Maria bay sand skypark,5.0,,This is #1 sky bar in Singapore. You can see an amazing view from the top of skypark at night and you can also see the whole Singapore.
,,wheelie good,5.0,,"This attraction will take about an hour or so, brilliant views of Singapore from the skypark on the 56th floor"
,,"Stunning place, must see",5.0,,"Stunning place, if you in Singapore it's a must place to visit. Make sure your camera is charged as there is so many beautiful things on the way to photograph."
,,Casino,5.0,,"Had a business meeting at night and we ended up at the marina Bay Sands. A must see if your in town, I recommend the casino."
,,Lovely views,5.0,,Only $20 per adult to access the rooftop bars and the entry cost goes towards the drinks when you get there. Well worth it for the views
,,Iconic Multi Activity Center Of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is really a multi activity center having a hotel casino, exhibition hall and opposite it is the Super Tree Grove that gets lively by the evening. The sky Park is on the topmost floor that connects the three hotel towers and has an entry ticket. There is bar and restaurant in nicely landscaped terrace giving complete view of Singapore"
,,Beautiful view for the city,5.0,,"The Skypark for the city is worth to pay and watch it, the view of the city from the Skypark is amazing you must try it."
,,Insect bites,3.0,,On our way back down in the lift by wife realised that she had been bitten by an insect on her elbow. As the day progressed the swelling got worse even though we applied cream. Hopefully the hotel sprays these areas and this left a bad impression for what should have been good. Be careful.
,,Went to the top,5.0,,Though we did not stay here - You can go up as a visitor to the outside top! One of the highest views I've had. You can see so many things below and the cars looked like little ants. Highly recommended!
,,The best view of the city,5.0,,This is a must for anybody who is visiting Singapore. I was sceptical as I am very affraid of hights. BUT I must say it is a must and I am so happy I went up. There was no movement that I could feel at all. We chose to have drinks at the bar and enjoyed the fabulous views all over Singapore. As I said this is a MUSt
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"It is a must if you are in Singapore, from there one can see all the city below and the marina. There is also a bar on the top which offer a drink and a rest to people with some time. If you stay in the hotel connected with the tower, you could take a bath in the infinity swimming pool on the roof of the tower."
,,Impressive views but expensive,4.0,,Nice views over the city and the Gardens by the Bay. Do not bother buying the photos that they are trying to sell you. Just use your own camera or mobile.
,,Don’t miss it!,5.0,,"If you have only a day, I suggest, must visit this place! It’s actually good and I may recommend the time for visit after sunset. Lighting of Singapore is no doubt, it’s awesome.... so one can enjoy the night view from the observation desk! Also they have quite good lounge and bar there! Less options for vegetarians (sad) but one can enjoy pizza, it was yum!"
,,Sky View,5.0,,"For around $30 SGD you can take the ek elevator up to this view hot spot. Yes, it is worth it. On a good day you can see from h ee double toothpicks to breakfast, as my dad used to say. It's really spectacular. Allow 30 minutes to enjoy the sights. Return to ground level and go for lunch nearby or dash off to anywhere in Singapore while you review your photos!"
,,its awesome,4.0,,"this is a awesome place, u can see singapore nights, its so beautyful, just worth it u just pay $20 u can see beautyful place like this"
,,Wow! Great venue even though drinks are pricey,5.0,,57 floors up with stunning views over Singapore. If you can stay for the light shows they are brilliant from up here
,,Morning well spent !,5.0,,"My husband & I spent the morning here on our trip to Singapore. We traveled by train. To get to the sky park you need to take a lift. It cost us 20 Singapore dollars. The lift takes you up 56 floors. Once up there the views are amazing. You can see so much ! You can look through a gap to see the pool & bar area. You need to be a guest to use these facilities. There is a small kiosk there selling drinks, ice creams & souvenir s. The iced pineapple is very thirst quenching."
,,Simply Awesome!!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is simply awesome. The towers being crowned with a connecting bridge structure is unique in itself. The view, specially at night, is wonderful."
,,Great views,3.0,,Great views but expensive to get to and not a lot but the view when you get there. A photo is taken before you get the lift & when you get to the top they are giving it to you for how much I don’t know. No shade either so make sure you have a hat.
,,You have to this!,5.0,,"So, it costs S$20 each - but it is pretty much obligatory when in Singapore. You do get an amazing view from the deck - the whole of Singapore and beyond. We waited until towards the end of our trip, which made it easier to identify landmarks, but when ever you go, it’s certainly worth it."
,,A must do!,5.0,,"Totally awesome. A brilliant view of Singapore from the top of the hotel. Just be aware of one thing; the visit is a once only ticket so, if you into the cafe at the top, you are not allowed to go back on to the viewing area. you've had your one visit!"
,,spectacular,5.0,,"certainly a sight to see. It stands tall on the edge of the bayfront, lovely restaurant on top and well worth a visit"
,,A must when visiting Singapore,5.0,,The view from of the city at night from the roof top is spectacular. It is a 1 minute ride 57 stories to the top. A beautiful mall is on the lower 2 levels.
,,Marina bay,4.0,,All you're designer shops loads of restaurants and coffee shops shoppers paradise stroll outside and see the beautiful buildings merlion take a boat ride
,,Don’t miss this,5.0,,"We stumped up the cash to go up to the top of this amazing building. It was really worth it as the views from there are breathtaking. If you can dodge all the selfie posers you get to see almost all the way round, and even a sneaky peak at the infinity pool which, alas is for hotel guests only."
,,"Expensive, but a must do in Singapore",5.0,,"The views from the top are amazing. We also popped into the roof top bar on the 57th floor for a beer; the most expensive ever at about 20SGD for a small glass !!, but the views are amazing. You have to do this once whilst in Singapore."
,,Great Views,5.0,,There is great views. If you plan to visit before sunset you can see the views in light and dark. Plus in the dark you will be able to watch the light show and water show from a great height. Just be wary that it takes time to queue up to collect tickets/ get in line to the lifts.
,,Spectacular views,1.0,,"We visited here mid afternoon, and had the most spectacular view of singapore. The area wasn't crowded and there was plenty of opportunity to take photos and spot locations that we had already visited."
,,Fast access. You are not a part of the hotel,5.0,,"We have the 09:30 elevator. That was the same time they open. Easy access, but make sure that you say Marine Bay Skypark to the taxidrivers. They have not heard about SAND skypark. The reason for this, is that the view-guest are not allowed into the top part of the hotel, which is the ""really park"". A cafe on the top. You see the whole Singapore. No need for the Singapore Eye..."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"If you want to see Singapore from all angles, visit this attraction. Its 56 floors high and the views are amazing. Well worth the admission fee. A must visit."
,,Picture perfect,4.0,,If you want some great pics with stunning backgrounds this is the place.. sit relax and unwind some memories in fresh air under the clouds
,,Needs improvements,3.0,,"As one on the world most known tourist attraction they need to do improvements, they need to add more activities to feel more excited for visitors, basically you reach up then you surprised nothing there just views with NO observable telescope.. despite what I said this attraction needed to be visited .."
,,The Ship,4.0,,we were a bit disappointed with the overall experience as we thought that we could see the whole roof area. However when we went up on the lift you are only allowed on the side which views the city and the marina bay.
,,Stunning in every respect,5.0,,"From so many locations in Singapore you will get the odd glimpse of the Skypark. However you really need to get up close and personal if you want to really appreciate it. It is a wonderful piece of architecture and design. You can get in free of charge if you use the elevators outside but it will cost you to get to the top, at least for any drinks you may wish to consume. Nothing wrong with that, they have to make a profit, but you can marvel at its beauty for nothing outside."
,,You have to experience this,5.0,,"Be mindful which bar you go to as the one nearest the pool area had better service and more room when we visited, ambience was better also.We secured a table at the front with view over marina bay, food was good drinks a tad expensive but with this view you don't mind paying......intoxicating and the mood can make you buy more drinks"
,,Go for a drink with your view !,5.0,,"Taking a look at Singapore from the SkyPark is breathtaking, and the cost of the view can leave a $25 dry taste, unless you go to the Cè la vi sky bar, you get the view from one level higher and a drink to help savour the view for not much more than a plain old entry fee to one level below."
,,Great view and amazing experience!!,5.0,,"It was amazing design, there were shops and stores inside of the huge hotel. There are two ways to get up. First one is going to the bar/restaurant, this option is nice because you can have a drink and just sit and enjoy the view. The second option is to go directly up and you wont be able to use the restaurant. (For what ever reason it is two different companies running it and each of them charge about 30 dollars per person). We went with the second option. The main reason is that yes you can get a drink with the first one but you cannot go all the way to the edge like you can with the second option. And since you are spending the money might as well get the best view possible and grab a drink somewhere else."
,,Spectacular viewing deck!,4.0,,"Climb up to level 57 of the luxurious Marina Bay Sands hotel to enjoy a 360 degree view of Singapore's Marina Bay area. This is what awaits both hotel guests or plain visitors at Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The view is really beautiful both by day and by night. Even if you suffer from fear of heights, you need not worry about it for the whole area is secured by sturdy tempered glass and wires. While the infinity swimming pool is reserved only to in-house guests, the rest of the area is open to the public for a fee (SG$23 for adults, SG$20 for senior citizens and SG$17 for kids aged 2-12). Aside from the spectacular view it offers. it also has a restaurant-bar. At night it is very relaxing to enjoy the view from the top over some glass of wine or champagne. The place is open from 9:30 AM to 10:00 PM (Mon-Thurs) or 11:00 Pm (Fri-Sun). Entrance is from Tower 3. :D"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Located on the 56th floor of this amazing building, it gives excellent birds eye view of the entire city. Looks beautiful in the evening."
,,Fantastic structure - amazing views,3.0,,"It costs 23 SGD for entry to the sky park. We can have a good view of the city from the top. There is not much else to pass time. You don’t even get to enter the infinity pool area unless you’re a guest. You can just go to Ce La Vi and pay for drinks/meals,enjoy the view and see the pool because going to the skypark is just paying an entrance of $23 and then leaving shortly after. We went to Ce La Vi."
,,Cocktails and view,5.0,,"We went for the view and also ordered cocktails and snacks which were the price of a meal in an upscale restaurant. Oh, well, the view was worth it. Panorama of the city and breathtaking as afternoon turned into night. Even if you are just in town on a cruise ship, don’t miss it. Don’t bother with a tour, this you can do own your own."
,,View of the Singapore,4.0,,"Magnificient view of Singapore city center, especially during the evening. Unfortunately we couldn't get the chance to dip into the pool."
,,True infinity pool,5.0,,"View is priceless. City view

Pool is large and needed split into two sections. Far right is adults pool, strictly no children. This is smaller area. Remaining 2/3rds is family.

Chairs are on deck in full sun or part shade with front row optional sunlounge in water. Yes it is foot depth surrounded by water. Fantastic if only you and a towel, otherwise think twice.
Front row lounges are quickly taken.
Best time to find a seat was between 10:30-12:00 or 3pm onward. Unsure of evening.

2 X Spa pools located up stairs of skydeck under palms, limited views of bay.

Restaurant and Cie la vie bar on this level. Cie la vie lounge reservation is minimum $200 spend or arrive at each opening time to take your luck.

Food menu is good at pool.
Cocktails were reasonably priced.

Toilets located next to lifts on level 56 or walk down stairs. Only 3 toilets and 2 showers."
,,Best view in the city,5.0,,"23 dollars to go on the viewing deck or 20 dollars to go in the bar. You can see the city sky scrapper, the marina, gardens by the bay, the coastline and part of the F1 race track to name a few. Well worth the money I would suggest going close to sun down to get the mix of view in the sun and at night"
,,Great City View,4.0,,You could see the sunset from this place while enjoying whole view of Singapore.Best to get here before sunset till night.
,,WOW,5.0,,Just by looking at it from anywhere as it stands out as a marvelous engineering achievement. You can buy a ticket & go to the top as a visitor like we did as we did not stay here. Very busy during Chinese new year celebration.
,,My son paid for this as a present.,5.0,,"This high tea was way over the top and London could learn from it.
We had more than enough food of various sorts and were served various teas. I thought I knew teas, but after this, I realised that I had a lot to learn. Mind you, after 5 samples even I could not drink any more."
,,Hell yeh,5.0,,Shady tree area on roof of MBS Great views 3 adult use jacuzzis Lots of sun beds Fabulous views across parkland below Great service Towels available Hotel guests only
,,Vertigo? no way - safe as a bank,5.0,,"Finally found the way through the hotel lobby to the lifts that take you the up to the viewing area, ( you can get a Seniors Discount here), lift scoots up quickly and you alight at the top to an amazing view of Singapore from way up high, Try to count the ships at anchor in the outer harbour, - you will lose count. Very Recommended attraction"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The views from the top of this building are outstanding. Well worth a trip up there if you are visiting the area. You can use the restaurant but the pool and park area only for guests. Everything looks so small from up there !
,,good view of the city,4.0,,The Skydeck gives you great views of the city. It is a bit expensive especially if you are with more people.
,,Beat view of Singapore,5.0,,"The skydeck observation platform is situated on the 57th floor of Tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands hotel. Tkt for adult SGD 23 (senior ctzn >65, SGD 20). Better to buy tkts online beforehand to avoid long queues. Can show tkt on your phone.
Express elevator takes a minute. Huge observation deck with a restaurant (obviously pricey). Good all round view of Singapore harbor, flyer, esplanade, Merlionand financial district. Can spend hours enjoying the view.. Dont forget to take your camera. Best time would be evening when you can see Singapore by and night lighting."
,,Long queue.,4.0,,"Seriously. My fams waited for 1 hour to get up the park. And 1 hour to exit the park.
Damnnn we're already exhausted from the day, and not expecting the queue to be this long...
I went up to the park at night. Great view ofc. Windy night so bring your jacket fellas.
I bought an ice cream for 4dollars, meh didn't taste good.
Overall, great view.."
,,"Great Hotel, But a Little Disappointing",4.0,,"First off I need to say that this building is amazing, you don't understand the sheer size of it until you are there in person. It's location is great, right next to the Park by the Bay, The Shoppes, a short MRT ride to the Flyer and easy access to everything else. There are plenty of eating options either in the hotels or across the road and the pool and Skydeck are mind blowing. What let this down was the hotel part of the Sands. We stayed in a club room which was quite nice and spacious and the bathroom is very nice. In saying that the bed was extremely hard and it hard a stupid auto charge mini bar which meant you could put anything in it. You could request a personal fridge for $10 per night, a little rich for me given how much you pay for the room.

The Club lounge (Club 55) was nice with a good selection of food due afternoon tea, canapes and breakfast. But we received no information about the club services so we got caught out with time, especially the one where after 7pm it turns into a public bar and club inclusions stopped, which meant no supper for me.

I also found the level of service to be lower than I would expect from a hotel of this calibre and cost.

Overall it was an enjoyable stay and experience and would recommend that everyone should try it, but I don't think I will be rushing back any time soon especially given the number of exceptional hotels in Singapore."
,,Most see it,5.0,,Highly recommended to visit it .the view from above was breathtaking and panoramic the sky park located in 56floor .and you get up from an elevator from our side.
,,amazing,5.0,,"we have been in restaurant on top. Amazing view, atmosphere, lounge music and etc. Must drink glass of champagne on top"
,,Fantastic view from the Observation Deck & Skybar,4.0,,"The Observation Deck at level 57 of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark can be booked in advance or like us, on the day. It is huge and offers fantastic 360 degree views over the Singapore cityscape and the Straits. It was fun identifying the race track and various buildings and gardens.

The Bar has a great selection of cocktails but gets very crowded. If you want to book a table at the restaurant Ce La Vi then ring up. I emailed and got such a baffling, off-putting reply informing me that I could not have a table for drinks till after 11pm and quoting a high table minimum charge. The reality was we had a drink in the bar and a table offered to us for 9.30."
,,Curious.,3.0,,"I was curious what the view of Singapore would be like from the skypark so booked a ticket to find out, was a bit disappointed with the experience, the skyline is not as spectacular in daylight as it is in the evening, probably only takes 10 minutes to view everywhere from the deck.
Separate area for guests staying in the hotel."
,,Amazing view! Must visit,5.0,,The view is soo beautiful. A must visit when in Singapore. Best visited at night as you can get great pictures!
,,A must visit.,5.0,,"You won’t experience a place like this anywhere else. The charge is $20 pp for the elevator the 51st floor where the views will take your breath away. The staff at the spacious roof-top bar were incredibly friendly and helpful, despite being very busy. The $20 elevator fee is credited to your bar bill. This is a fabulous place to relax in the evening with a beverage or two."
,,A unique experience indeed,5.0,,"If you are not afraid of heights, visit the pool on the roof and look down onto the streets provided you stay at the hotel. If that's not your fancy, visit the wonderful parks and plenty of shopping However, try ot to visit during the weekends, it have a tendency to be a little crowded."
,,Visit to the top of the world xx,5.0,,"Took a lift to to top to see the infinity pool and had a drink and snacks. Great views . You could see the rain coming in and the staff are well trained to get everything covered up without too much fuss. The rain didn't last too long, and the sun soon came out and everything was back to normal in quick sticks xx"
,,views spectacular,5.0,,the view from the skypark is spectacular u get a panoramic view of Singapore skyline 2nd a grwtvieq of the gardens on the bay definitely a must in Singapore
,,Deserves its popularity,5.0,,"It's a place one can't not visit when in Singapore. It was raining a lot when we went, but I was still able to appreciate the beauty of the famous site."
,,57 floors up.,5.0,,You spend $40 for a trip in a lift and a drink at the bar at the top. Some great around views of Singapore well worth it. You get use to loads of people everywhere you go.
,,Sensational building,5.0,,I would be far to scared to stay here but it looks amazing. Walking through and above the reception gave one an idea of the place. What surprised was the window boxes outside the rooms.
,,Amazing space that impresses from every angle,5.0,,A must-see for anyone visiting Singapore. Such an iconic space that is an architectural wonder of the modern world.
,,A spectacular work of art!!!,4.0,,You will wonder how they built this place! Find a way to reach the top to enjoy the entire beauty of the city.
,,Good view!,4.0,,The view is great. You can see gardens by the Bay etc. I can recommend going up the tower but I think it looked cooler seeing it from the gardens by the Bay at night.
,,Watt à standing view,5.0,,I whos really surprised by the view from her. Amazing in sow luxury hotel in restaurants in bars to we did enjoy in pleasant by the drinks in pool to in snacks we spend good time her and I really recommend
,,Went for tea,5.0,,"We didn’t stay here but went for afternoon tea which was so well presented, but not cheap, but well worth it."
,,Overpriced,4.0,,Very overpriced for such a simple platform. Kiosk has very limited options. Staff were very blunt. $68+ for 15 mins up there. Certainly would not do it again.
,,Incrediable palace,5.0,,"This is a must while in Singapore. Great Shopping, Restaurants, and Views. Go up and have a drink or meal at Wolfgang Pucks restaurant at the top."
,,Good views - ghastly hotel areas,3.0,,"The views from the open area at 57 floors is magnificent and gives a great overview of Singapore.
The hotel ground floor is the most ghastly crowded place - there are hundreds if not thousands of people crowding the area. Tourist mixing with hotel guest eating areas is a place to be avoided. So busy the hotel has staff checking potential guests leaving to ask if they have paid their bill. Enjoyed the view but not the rest."
,,Got to go up!!,4.0,,"After finding our way to the ticket office you take the lift to the 57th floor. What views, what views!

You can see all over Singapore, I will warm those with height fears, the glass walls let you get a full view, my friend couldn’t go to the edge!!!

After many pics we went to go to the bar, once you go in the bar they won’t let you back into the observation deck! The drinks aren’t cheap but I think it’s worth while have a glass of fizz up there!

I left my friend hugging the bar to go get pics of the infinity pool, you can’t go in but can get pics from a side bar area! It looks gorgeous but even I thought that looks scary lol!

All in all worth the $22 -$25!!"
,,Great Experience,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel ...this amazing building composed of three towers with an infinity pool on the top. Designer shops on the Ground Floor. We travelled very swiftly to the 57th floor where the views were amazing (tickets are required for this). The infinity swimming pool is accessed from this level but only if you are resident at the hotel ...visitors must look from a distance. Great views of the city and the Gardens by the Bay. Understand that there is a laser show at the hotel each evening at around 8.pm which would be worth seeing.
,,Fantastic view at night time over Singapore.,5.0,,Just to visit the Marina Bay Sands hotel is fun. A fantastic building. The queue to the elevator was quite long when we visited the Skypark. Well worth waiting. The cost is around 25 SGD. If you want to drink or eat anything at the top it is extremely expensive.
,,Totally worth it,5.0,,"There were two options, restaurant, or skypark.

Skypark is more, but you can go into the restaurant bar area from the skypark for a drink. once you leave the skypark, you can't go back onto the observation deck.

We chose the skypark and it was great.

Tip - If you are there in the evening. Stay to watch the light show in Cloud Forest which starts around 8pm. we ended up leaving at 7pm just before it started..."
,,Views,5.0,,"You get to top with elevator which is a bit pricey but it gives you amazing views over the city,really worth your money."
,,"You have to do it, not sure if it’s worth it",4.0,,"It’s the first thing you see the day you drive into Singapore. It’s the most incredible modern building I’ve ever seen and when you see it everyday of your trip you feel you have to go up and see what the fuss is about.
Well, it’s about 15 dollars US to go up. It takes you to the 56th floor and you see all of Singapore on a clear day.
It’s an amazing view and that’s about it. You’re not allowed anywhere near the pool, that’s a shame for us peasants who will never be able to afford to stay here."
,,the view!,5.0,,"We enjoyed the roof top restaurants! The scenery from the top is amazing, watched a sunset from the top and it was amazing."
,,Speachless view,5.0,,"If it's your first time, it's really a must go. If not, you know that it's always a pleasure to enjoy the whole city view from the top. You have an alley to access directly to the gardens and you have the malls, plus the bay if you had to much height"
,,Worth a stop.,5.0,,"An attraction like this is difficult to find anywhere else. It looks like a train that has stopped on top of 3 big towers and thereby connected them. Hotel guests have use of about 80% of the top...which of course includes the swimming pool area. However the observation deck that is on the east side is accessible by a $27 elevator ride to the 56th floor. Lovely views all around the tower.
Worth a trip up. Recommend."
,,Amazing views from the top,5.0,,"We decidd to get the lift up here at a cost of about £8, well worth it for the view at the top was amazing - we could se all round Singapore from there and enjoyed a couple of beers - rather expensive beers but then that's what you have to pay up there."
,,"GREAT architecture, boring Mall",4.0,,"Already looking from far this building is breathtaking! The Mall apart from the architectural attractions is absolutely boring. There are all the important brands with more or less attractive elements, but they are all the same around the world on top their clients don't bring vibrating life in. With one word: the mall has no soul!!!!!
When you want to enjoy the incredible view over Singapore you must take the lift (very fast!) to the 58th floor and be prepared to pay for entering the Plattform .

Much nicer take a drink or enjoy the great food in one of the restaurants!!!!!!!"
,,Incredible views,4.0,,"There is a cost to non residents of the hotel, $23.00 but if you are a visitor and flown in on Singapore Air, keep your boarding card as you will get a 15% discount. It takes seconds to travel the 56 floors, and it is an incredible sight, but you are only allowed on the deck, you don't get to see the swimming pool or any of the other areas, there are no seats, one small food-drinks kiosk so took ages to get a drink, then you have to stand to drink it. I suppose it is a must do if you are ok with heights!! Not too sure it was worth the money!!"
,,Pricey but great views,4.0,,"Took the visitors tour by lift to the observation deck. Wonderful views of the city and the river front. There's a bar on the deck, but you can't get onto the infinity pool deck."
,,Spectacular Views,4.0,,"We visited the Skypark on 19 Jan 2018. The views were amazing. It's definitely the best place to see almost the whole of Singapore. However, we went in the morning and it can get pretty hot there. So remember to bring your hats and sun protection as there isn't much shady spots up there. The wind can get pretty strong too. Overall, it was a good experience for me :)"
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"A fabulous panoramic view of Singapore. The 56 floor also has a really interesting pool you can use if you are staying at the hotel. We weren’t, however it was worth the money spent to see the city. There was information telling you what buildings surrounded this iconic building. Lots of pictures were taken."
,,Pretty underwhelming considering the price.,3.0,,"I was really keen to check out Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck, but unfortunately, it didn't deliver. First of all, it's extremely pricey, over 20SGD each with nothing included. The view is great but once you're up there that's about it. Really not worth it."
,,Wow View,5.0,,"You just have to go here to take in the amazing views from the 57th floor! No cost to get in but the drinks are expensive, I guess they’ve had to travel quite far! One side you see the views of the Marina, the other side you see the Gardens by the Bay. I think it is best viewed at night."
,,Exceptional,5.0,,Best spot to see 360 view of Singapore city. Extremely amazing place. If you are in Singapore please do visit sky park.
,,Brilliant view but...,3.0,,"I suppose visiting the observation deck an the Marina Bay Sands has become one of the must do things in Singapore and the view is certainly breathtaking. However, it's not cheap ( 43SGD for two) and there can be quite long queues at the lifts. There is also the obligatory photograph and staff weren't happy when, after visiting the observation deck, we refused to purchase it. Once on the observation deck, you are limited to one end with no access to the infinity pool. We were going to have a drink but were told that we couldn't go back onto the observation deck afterwards so we decided against it.
Having seen the view, albeit on a rather hazy day, I don't think we would visit the observation deck again."
,,Wonderful Panoramic Views of Singapore,5.0,,"You have to do this for two reasons -- to say you've been on the boat-shaped top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and, more importantly, to enjoy the spectacular views over Singapore. What a glorious sight to behold!! It costs $20 or so to get up there but it's well worth it."
,,This place certainly has the wow factor,5.0,,"There is little doubt that the building will soon displace the Singapore Flyer as the iconic building of Singapore. The actual architecture is a bit boring but there no denying that being at the top and looking down on Marina Bay is exhilarating. On the day we went, there were too many people in the infinity pool taking pictures but hey, who cares, they were having a great time."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great place it’s a must if you are a tourist Access by lift or escalator avoid the time nes when the light show is finishing as it gets really busy
,,Expensive for a drink but worth it,5.0,,"I have stayed at MBS previously and have been to the sky park, but this time we paid to go for a drink and to sit and take in the view. It is really great and is worth the bar prices charged."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Definitely the place to go when you want to see the Singapore landscape - the views are awesome.
Gets pretty busy as you can imagine it’s a popular spot so get there early if you are chasing a sunset picture.
Drinks are expensive but only to be expected."
,,Great Views,5.0,,Views from the top of this iconic building are superb. In reality it is though you are standing at the bows of a ship.
,,Must visit for spectacular view !,5.0,,"Swimming pool is allowed for only in house guests we had taken just entry pass to sky deck for $50.

Superb view from top at night with almost everything visible from there.

You can see gardens by the bay, ports, city skyline and sky ride.

Must visit site. Takes around 2 hours maximum."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We visited this during the day . The views are incredible. We also visited this in the evening and paid to go up-to the bar and restaurant. We weren’t disappointed. Besides the views the ambience was fantastic. We chose to sit outside but unfortunately that evening it was a bit more windier than we liked . We asked to be moved and it wasn’t a problem, the food served was of great quality. Well worth a visit"
,,Worth one time visit,3.0,,"I would say definitely its one time worthy visiting the skypark at Marine Bay Sands. The entry fee at around 20 SGD is steep. Getting a photo clicked is another 35 SGD. You can definitely get a 360 degree view of Singapore, but you are out of luck if you want to get a view of the Infinity Pool. That part is only accessible to hotel renters.

Nice for a romantic date maybe."
,,What a view!,3.0,,Fantastic views over Marina bay and beyond. The main problem is the queuing. We went with an organised tour but the queue was so long we gave up. We went back the next evening. The queue was reasonable going up but horrendous to get down. Give yourselves plenty of time!
,,"good for the first time in Singapore , views are worth it",4.0,,"Great for first timers to Singapore, views are spectacular, price is a bit steep, a good experience taking in the views and being on a icon in Singapore.
Go the extra and visit the bar, where you get the view, for free and have a drink instead!"
,,"Beautiful, but expensive!",4.0,,"The views are stunning, specially the Gardens by the Bay. Anyway it is a little expensive for the area that you can access."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Fantastic place
Just the view of it as you walk up to it is enough
Fantastic when you go in , go up to the public platform , you do have to pay ,15 0/0 dicount if you have flown with Singapore air line, need a copy of fight details , just keep it on your phone
2 beers did cost us 50.00 dollars , but well worth it for the experience"
,,360 Degree View of Singapore,4.0,,"The Skypark is an observation deck on the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The cost f is approximately $17 USD and $15 USD for senior citizens to visit. If you have booked a room in the hotel, access to the Skypark is included in your reservation. This deck is well worth the money to be able to get a 360-degree view of the Singapore skyline. You can catch a glimpse of the infinity pool for hotel guests only. There are restaurants, night clubs, gardens and trees for your enjoyment. From the skylark, you can get a fantastic few of the Supertree Grove, the Gardens by the Bay and other landmarks of Singapore. What makes this deck unique is that it is in the shape of a boat sitting on three towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Recommend this great view of Singapore."
,,Toooop,5.0,,Tooooop place and panorama. You must absolutely visit it! Don't try to miss it...yiu will regret. Trust me 😉
,,"Good around early evening, watch sunset!",4.0,,"If you reach there in the late afternoon, early evening, you can watch the colour change from light to dark, and when the sun starts to set, the skyline will light up with many little lights illuminating the skyscrapers.

It is also a little more crowded, but find a good spot, and it will be great! If you go around 7.45 or 8.45pm you can see the gardens by the bay show from on top, or go a bit earlier to see the view, and walk towards gardens by the bay by 7.40pm or 8.40pm and you can enjoy the free performance called the Garden Rhapsody!

No shelter at both places, recommended weather is when it's not raining! Better experience :) ( sometimes it rains too much in Singapore unfortunately)"
,,Great Views Also From Sky Bar,5.0,,"So we decided as a family of 4 not to do the Skypark as it was $28 p.p. and we found out from the ground floor entrance to MBS that they had both a restaurant and bar a floor higher than the skypark. After looking at the menu we decided that there was nothing appealing for the kids so we chose the skybar instead.
You pay $20 p.p but it is a credit voucher towards food and/or drinks. We got fabulous seats right on the edge and had dinner and drinks there. The views were amazing and we also were right next to the infinity pool that MBS is famous for.
Now you will get a better overall view from the skypark as it wraps around for 360 degree views, so most certainly do that if you would prefer. However to sit at the bar with 180 degree views in comfort with some food and a beer was sensational."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark - information in brief,5.0,,"Is it worth it? Yes, definitely. Spectacular view!

,,Great views by day or night,5.0,,We visited here 3 times in 24 hours as were staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel so had free access to the Skypark. Great views can be had off the top looking over Singapore so definitely worth going up even if you have to pay.
,,Escaping the thunderstorm whilst taking cover at CeLaVi,5.0,,What a phenomenon front seat view to be amongst the front and Centre of an awe inspiring tropical thunderstorm. Great excuse to sit about an hour an a half of clear skies to tremendous clouds engulfing the 57/58th floor. Lightning danced all around us. Even bouncing off the pool and torrential downpour was a refreshing dance of Mother Nature to behold. We loved it!
,,One of the best hotels we've ever stayed at,5.0,,"Nothing beats swiming in a pool on the 57th floor with the Singapore city skyline as your back drop. We didn't want to leave the pool, but a storm spoiled our fun and they had to evaccuate the pool."
,,Wasted $23:00,1.0,,I paid for entrance to the sky park and went through the entrance and walked round to where the entrance to the bar was and as I had been walking for a few hours decided to have a break before spending time looking at the views. While having a drink and food i booked a room there for my next scheduled trip to Singapore as up until now everything seemed very professional. When I went to return to the sky park I was told there was no reentry. I told the attendant I had only walked around the outside once and had come in for a drink. Despite my explanation he would not let me back into the sky park. As a result I left and shortly after cancelled the booking I had made.
,,Awesome,5.0,,You are whisked to the top floor of the Marina Sands Hotel in a very short time. The views of Singapore are amazing.
,,Nice view of Singapore,5.0,,"Skypark is must see attraction to visit. Nice view of Singapore skyline, sea, garden by the bay from skypark . If you visit skypark then you can skip wheel."
,,Afternoon tea in Renko,1.0,,"As a wheelchair traveller, we were enthusiastic as access was easy up a ramp.
As a consumer of afternoon tea we were sadly disappointed. The high tea was delivered
In a tombola trolley. Sadly the contents were strictly average 49$SGD++
About the same price as more established hotels. Even the squirty cream was being passed off with the scones. Clotted cream only way to go. After the chef twice for replacement, no can do was the attitude. White cap chef appeared saying sorryx4!
Duty manager arrived, reduction in our Bill of 49SGD, and out came Cornish clotted cream. They picked an Englishman to test out the squirty cream on!!!
Sadly they were on commission to sell Marina Bay tea, a wild teamaker was doing a jig with a copper kettle.
Before writing this review in February 2018 the Hotel is struggling for customer, they were dropping room prices by 40SGD a night. More expensive generally Than hotels in the Bay Area. Glad to see other reviews experiencing disappointed.
Verdict, too big, too many restaurants, hotel areas have become territorial, would not go back."
,,A Must,5.0,,We were staying on level 49 of MBS and visited the Skypark several times. The view over the city is breathtaking. If you’re staying at the hotel you will also get access to the infinity pool.
,,Disappointment,3.0,,There was a short queue to pay but it took a long time to get to the front. There was only one cashier taking the money and for some unknown reason it was very slow. You get the obligatory photo taken before the enter the non-stop lift which takes you to Level 56. The viewing platform is a horeshoe shape around a central bar. I've been on better viewing platforms than this but unfortunately the weather at the time was a bit grey. There is a bar in the centre of the platform which was very busy.
,,Not cheap but fabulous view !,5.0,,"28S$ get you to the observation deck on 56th floor of this amazing structure. The view from the top is stunning and as a once in a life time activity, I thought it was worth the money. You will only get an hour on the deck and you have a one way to exit out through the cafe/bar. You can order food or drinks there and enjoy the view from the top for a little longer.
The amazing infinity pool at the top of the hotel can be seen mat to the restaurant, so it's worth taking a peek...!"
,,The extra charges. Rip off.,1.0,,We paid $20 per person for entry and to go up to have a drink at Marina bay. You can’t walk around the viewing platform unless you pay another $23 each. You can’t see or use the pool. Complete rip off and very disappointed. We would definitely not go back.
,,Absolutely Breathtaking,4.0,,"The views are amazing, this a must see, worth $20, refunded with a drink + taxes... no access to infinity pool but it's viewable. Worth a visit."
,,Complete let down and so expensive for not a lot,1.0,,"So you have to pay $20 per person to be able to go up to have a drink at Marina bay and then you can use that to go towards drink or food. You can’t walk around the viewing platform unless you pay another $23 each. You can’t use the pool. There is nowhere to sit. The worst by is the food is completely over priced, the drinks cost over the $20 token you have and then on top we were charged $5 service charge, not quite sure what for PLUS $3.50 tax!! Complete rip off and so disappointed the views from the gardens up the trees are much better. Would not recommend this place."
,,January break,5.0,,"Excellent hotel, better than expected. Very clean and comfortable in Every way. Easy to access major attractions like ""Gardens by the Bay"" (which is a must). We stayed 5 nights in a club room King. We recommend this kind of room , with it you can have your breakfast within the 55 club concept which has everything you may want in a beautiful setting with white cotton tablecloth and so on. It felt very luxurious. You also have included in the price teatime and aperitif , 3 meals a day you may say. We did not need to buy any more food though it could be too many sweet things on your holiday
The bed was very comfortable and the pool area large , beautiful and unlike. The service excellent and friendly. We give this hotel 5 stars of 5 possible."
,,Extremely touristy but worth the view,5.0,,"I guess you can’t avoid the tourist crowd. Everyone wants to get a glimpse from up there. There was a long line downstairs at the hotel lobby which moved fairly fast, they charge $20 voucher ticket per adult which serves as a credit at the bar. A cocktail costs like $22+ and when crowded you must be lucky to find a spot to sit at a table. However, the views are stunning overlooking Singapore and you can say you have been there ;-)"
,,For City Lover,5.0,,"You can go to the top of Marina Bay Sands by paying $23. The view is amazing! Recommended to come at evening to night time as there will be a light show at 8 pm. The infinity pool unfortunately, is for hotel guest only."
,,So Romantic!!!,5.0,,Great night view of the Singapore skyline from 57 floor. As expected drinks are pricey but well worth it. No cover charge. Pictures are worth a thousand words!!!!
,,Overpriced,2.0,,"An observation platform with an horrific price. And I had to refuse the photo 3 times before they would let me past them. I was up there for 10 minutes. Lovely views, very little information about what you can see. I didn’t eat anything or try the bar."
,,Just to say we had been....,5.0,,"Iconic building had to be on the visiting list. Didn’t pay for sky deck as visited open air bar which isn’t charged for. Spent $23 entry for sky deck on a cocktail instead, with pretty much the same views. If you want access to the pool, or have children pay the entry, over 18’s who like a cocktail or two I suggest you just take the sky bar option. Beware the dress code on Fridays and Saturdays. Has to be done."
,,"Great View, but not particularly cheap",3.0,,"The hotel was too expensive for us, so we went to the Skypark instead. The view was great and the queues quite short (in December).

Our 6 and 10 year old were more interested in buying a drink and ice cream than looking at the view."
,,Hugeeeee,4.0,,"A must do, huge hotel and very busy...
Can either visit rooftop bar OR viewing area, clever really but for best pictures walk around the sides and you can get the best pictures for free without even going in...
Shops are amazing, all designer, even a canal through it...
Best view of fountains and light display at 8 and 9 pm.
Be warned it’s expensive! Get your gifts from china town instead, exactly the same"
,,Cool place but over priced,4.0,,"I went at night, great view of the city and can see both light shows at gardens and marina bay, but the shows are better on the ground. Lots of people and long lines to get in and to get back out. Wouldn’t pay to go up again."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"The 3 buildings with a boat shape suspended across the top of them is not only a feat of engineering but also a sight to behold. You just don't think it's possible. We walked through it, went up the lift to the lookout platform at the top the overhangs the buildings and visited the shopping centre in its basement. And for convenience it also has a train station right to the centre. On the ground floor it has a canal running down the centre complete with gondolas. Large amount of eateries & shops that you could spend a whole day at this one sightseeing location."
,,fabulous view,5.0,,superb view from the sky park ...... would recommend ppl to visit during late evening to get the fabulous view
,,Nice view,4.0,,Great view out there. Will rather spend on drinks then just to pay to go view. An iconic place in sg.
,,"Fantastic views, although not much else",4.0,,"Fantastic almost 360 degree views over Singapore. There is a snack bar up there, but nothing else. There is a restaurant associated with the hotel but access seemed restricted (might have been the time I arrived - I was there in the morning)."
,,MBS observation deck,5.0,,The MBS observation deck was a great experience and the 360 degree views around Singapore were fantastic.
,,Best view ever.,5.0,,"Located on the 57th floor this Skybar is fantastic. You can have a drink or eat. There is also a pool on the roof.
The view is amazing. This is Singapore from above. Located on top of one of the most spectacular hotels in the world.
Off course there is also restaurants and bars in other places in the hotel"
,,Infinity pool,5.0,,"Excellent pool and views, better to swim early morning as it gets very busy but adult only section. Fantastic view over bay especially at night"
,,Stunning views,4.0,,A few years ago you could go the the very top and use the infinity pool. So many people were doing that the hotel had to stop as their paying guests found the pool too crowded. If you take the elevator to the viewing platform you can see a part of the pool. Amazing. We noticed that there were long lineups to check into and out of this hotel. Rather off putting. Still you should go up top just for the views of this remarkable city.
,,Watch the lights and sound!,5.0,,Lights and sound is one of the great attraction to see in SG. For about 20minutes you will.witness an awesome show..its must to.see
,,One of the great hotels of the world,4.0,,"Recently saw a programme on tv about this hotel and couldn't wait to visit.its a truly incredible hotel with three separate towers topped with a boat spanning all three towers with gardens and an infinity pool the size of three football pitches,if your not staying there is a charge to go up.on the downside it's expensive but with a large selection of bars and restaurants you can visit and get the experience without staying"
,,Amazing views ..,4.0,,"Visited one weekday and you have 2 options..
1 skypark on the viewing area.
2 restaurant with the 20 dollars been deductable from ur bill.
We took the 2md option and relaxed with a drink and snack..
Photos are limited as you are 5m from the edge and not allowed access..
We managed ok and got some good photos on a nice clear day.
Drinks etc well overpriced + 17 % tax so beware..
A good way to pass an hour in a class hotel...
Easily accessible via the MRT and hop on off bus.."
,,Great view for a small price,4.0,,"Love the sky park. The view up there is awesome. Just before you take the lift up to the sky park, there is a photo booth where they take photo of you against a blank background. I was pleasantly surprise when the photo taken turn out to be soooo amazing! It was super imposed on a night view of the MBS.
The sky park itself is nice. I used to joke you can take a picnic basket up there and stay up there all day.
Do pick a day when it’s not that cloudy to go up there."
,,Scenes of Singapore,3.0,,The Sky Park is in the 56th floor if the Marina Bay Hotel but visitors for not have access to the hotel bar and infinity pool. The views are amazing and not those uncomfortable at heights
,,Breath taking place,5.0,,The 64th floor (the roof) is a phenomenal experience. You can capture amazing pictures. It's a must go place. It's also a fantastic mall with lots of shops and a top high end casino
,,High End Hotel & Casino Complex,4.0,,"Comprised of three massive towers, this hotel and casino complex features a promenade of high end designer shops integrated into the premier hotel complex in Singapore. The views from the upper observation deck are excellent"
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"A must visit attraction in Singapore! Best time to visit is after 7 PM. You will have amazing views of Singapore's civic district, Singapore Eye, Super Tree Grove & Gardens by the bay! Highly recommended for families with children!"
,,Amazing view from the top,4.0,,We went to the sky park in the late evening and the view were breathtaking. City looks amazing in the night. This is a land mark in Singapore and a must see attraction.
,,Scenic,5.0,,The views from this hotel are breathtaking especially at night. Worth a visit but expect to pay top dollar!
,,"The Singapore ""Ship""",4.0,,"This attraction is only about 7 years old, but it dominates a portion of the Singapore skyline. It is next to the beautiful Gardens by the Bay. We paid to get to the top of the ship and had a drink at the bar there. Great views of the downtown area and harbor, as well as the swimming pools at the top."
,,Viewing Deck 26th floor,3.0,,"We went on a combined night time tour, grouped with Gardens by the Bay/ Cloud Forest. There are only snack bars at the viewing deck, plus a bar one level up. Amazing view!"
,,awesome experience,5.0,,I would say this should be on everyone's bucket list! Its really neat to see this on top of a hotel and being so high up!
,,A must see,5.0,,"The view is absolutely incredible and gives you a wonderful view of singapore. Located in Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Hotel. Tickets are $23 pp and access is to the right of the hotel entrance and down a flight of steps. They take you to elevator for 56th floor. You will only have access to front part of skypark as the remainder is reserved for guests
TIP: If you flew in with Singapore Airlines and show your boarding pass you will receive a discount off the price. Additionally if you show your skypark pass to the restaurant on the 57th floor you will gain access (at leadt this is what the sugn on the observation platform said). Restaurant opens at 11:30. Skypark opens at 9:30"
,,Ready to sail away!,5.0,,"Interesting design: a ship perched atop three towers, with hotel and (I think) casino space, recently built on reclaimed land. I can imagine sailing away if the sea level rises enough . . ."
,,Overpriced for the treatment you get,3.0,,"The view is great, the location is fascinating, but i don't think it is worth the money to be treated like cattle.
i had considered going to the bar instead, so I could enjoy my time and relax, but i was talked out of it because the view 'would be better from the skypark'. Well, I saw plenty of people from the bar walking down to enjoy the same view.
Meanwhile, the area that you have to wait to get on the elevator was so hot, and they packed us into the elevator so tight! i think for the money you pay they could turn up the AC and get some more elevators."
,,Ms Rozzo,1.0,,Don’t bother. Charged to use the lift to get to a restricted viewing platform which was on one side of the hotel. Told that we were not allowed to go anywhere else. Disappointed that the hotel boasts a fabulous infinity pool and gourmet restaurants but unless you are a resident there is no way for you to get to see any of it The hotel lobby was packed with people trying to check in and the whole ground floor was more like a railway station at rush hour.
,,Amazing,4.0,,We started here in marina bay sand for two nights. The best part of the hotel is the infinity pool. No word to describe.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Worth a visit, especially when the lights come on at night. Restaurants in the mall offer a variety of Asian food."
,,Great Viewing of Singapore,5.0,,"There are two options to do the Marina Bay Skypark.
1. Pay S$23 to go to the viewing deck.
2. Pay S$20 to go to the bar and restaurant area but no access to the viewing platform..
We took option 2 and spent our S$20 Singapore Flings at the bar. Don't expect to get and change and be prepared to pay tax on top depending on what you order. Lowest price on the drinks menu was S$17 + tax. Having said that it was well worth it. This is a tourist attraction only with no access to guest areas. Views we great and a must do attraction."
,,The skypark is a must,5.0,,"Your trip to Singapore is not complete if you don't 1) go to Marina Bay Sands hotel/ shopping centre
2) the skylark.
It is amazing. Make sure you take an umbrella. They don't have any up there and it's a waste of time if it is raining."
,,Wonderful in day as well as in night.,5.0,,Wonderful area. Amazing place to walk around. It looks gorgeous in day but if you come in evening you don't wanna go back. Don't forget to get your camera's.
,,Great Shopping! Spend some time here,4.0,,Dinner at Spago's at the top of Tower 2 then shopping at our favorites! Beautiful beautiful place! take a taxi or the train and enjoy a day or an evening
,,Fantastisk,5.0,,It’s very nice. Special in the evening with colorful lights. It’s fantastic and very beautiful. Wonderful place.
,,Drinks at Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"Met friends for drinks at Spago on the top floor - comfortably seating, good service and music not so loud so you could hear your friends talking. The view is breathtaking of course, and with the lights coming on, it really is amazing. The pool? Not looking like the luxury that people presume it will - very crowded and bikini clad girls everywhere, tattoos aplenty and all rather like a lido in the UK in the 1980s."
,,Beautiful Skylight at Night,5.0,,We went up to the Skypark ($23 ticket) and had a beautiful view of Singapore skylight. The elevator zipped us up to the 56th floor in less than a minute. The skypark has open glass wall that let you feel the cool breeze and allows to take great pictures without the interference of a glass wall. This is a must-do item when you visit Singapore
,,Great experience!,5.0,,Great experience and very good service. The view is amazing and strongly recommended at Sunset. We enjoyed it very much during New Years'Eve and it was worth the experience.
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Three things u have to do here 1.visit roof top 2shopping 3. visit worlds largest casino.passport is needed. Entry will be free for tourists. No dress code. If budget is an issue,skip shopping but rest two activities are must to do."
,,Superb views and great food,5.0,,"Book lunch or dinner at the Restaurant for good food. and you will go up to the Skypark Deck free. Spagos from Los Angeles operates there - by celebrity Michelin Award chef Wolfgang Puck . Cheaper during lunch. Good service, and ambience."
,,Best views in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must go place in Singapore, There is a fee, but if you stay in the hotel it’s free. From there you have the best pictures and views of the whole Singapore"
,,Hello,5.0,,Spectacular view of the city.... If in Singapore it's a must see place. The sky deck is in a shape of a ship. Get to the top and enjoy the view of the city.
,,Must go!,5.0,,"Marina skypark is breezy, romantic and thrilling. Loved holding hands and cuddling my husband right at the top where u can see almost entire Singapore. Its a must visit place for perfect photos with ur loved ones."
,,Amazing view. To be visited,4.0,,"The MBS skypark is one of the best places to view the Singapore city skyline. The ideal time to visit would be during the twilight hour (late evening) so that you can catch both the daylight view as well as the night view of the Singapore skyline.
I personally prefer it over the Singapore Flyer(Giant wheel) as this gives a open view of the skyscrapers rather than the closed view inside the Flyer."
,,Went to visit a friend.,5.0,,The skypark has a spectacular view of Singapore. There is a infinity pool where you can swim and relax. There is a pool side bar. There is a restarants at the sky lark selling international food. Good experience and a fun day on top of Singapore
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,"Visited the Marina Bay hotel & Sky Park one afternoon during our 3 day stay. Quite expensive if you just waned to go to the top and look at the view. ($23), but once up there the view was amazing."
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,"I love the views! The building is pretty incredible, architecture lovers must see! The views by night of the Singapore skyline is pretty amazing! I loved it! If you can, make a reservation for a romantic dinner or drinks with friends!"
,,Weekend in Singapore,5.0,,Very nice viewpoint on mostly of the city. Unfortunately it's not possible see the spectacular swimming pool because reserved to the hotel guests
,,Awesome,5.0,,A must see for any visitor to Singapore - try to get there after dark to see the sights and lights from the roof top
,,Amazing Views of the City,5.0,,"We are staying at the hotel, so get to go up for free. The view over the city in all directions is likely unequalled by anything else in Singaport. If you are warry of heights, stay away from the edges, as it is straight down 57 stories! Once you are up there, there is a bar and restaurant if you are so inclined."
,,Not quite worth the pay to go in,4.0,,"Nice facilities but I wouldn't pay the entrance fee. Visited a few times because friends took rooms there as MBS hotel is quite popular with visitors. Infiniti pool is unique but it's just another pool, albeit with a view. Sometimes get too crowded."
,,A place that gives a little glimpse of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sand SkyPark gives an awesome view to the skyline of Singapore’s central buiZ district. The view ie spectacular! Singapore is so beautiful and it’s a giant garden city. Would highly recommend to stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel as the hotel provide free access for all guest. Besides, you also get many shopping perks. If you are into buying all the branded items including Chanel, LV, Prada, Gucci....if u can name it, they have it. It’s a 1 shop shopping paradise. Do check out this place"
,,Feel The Titanic on the clouds.........,5.0,,"We travelled with our teenage daughters and enjoyed the view from the top floor.
The building itself is a masterpiece and a man made miracle. Alternate would be you could visit there restaurant on the top floor by paying cover charges and have a glass of drink, but you would not be allowed in the open area......
Conclusion......a must visit in Singapore."
,,Brilliant!!!,5.0,,"From entering on the ground floor to the rooftop spectacle, it was truly amazing. Views were outstanding and the whole experience was memorable."
,,A BOAT IN YHE AIR?,5.0,,"One of the most striking views in Singapore is the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. When is the last time you saw what looks like a large boat sitting on the top of three buildings.
It’s interesting. The view from the observation deck on floor 56, the bar on floor 57 of the restuarant on 57 are the options you have when going to the top. Worth a visit."
,,Nice view.,5.0,,One more attractive place in Singapore. At least on top there always blowing wind makes you feel fresh. Night 🌃 view is great.
,,incredible views,5.0,,Myself and my partner visited purely for the views over Singapore and it was absolutely worth it. Go during the evening and see Singapore lit up at night it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
,,Worth it for theview,4.0,,We paid 20$ each redeemable against food an drink to go and sit in the bar at the top - well worth it for the views and vibes but this will not cover one drink with taxes and service charge.
,,Totally worth it,5.0,,"So we paid 23 SGD to get to the observation deck but there are other ways you can go up, particularly if You are eating. There is a kiosk at the top that has a range of beverages (alcohol included) and food and the view is simply stunning. Well worth it."
,,Holiday adventure,5.0,,We stayed at this hotel and the unique advantages that it holds by staying here. The sky park is amazing and Well worth the visit and explore all the wonders it holds. A magical place and well worth taking time to see it for yourself
,,Fun attraction!,5.0,,We took the elevator to the top floor and took photos of the city. Then walked around the indoor shopping mall and casino.
,,The Spectacular Views,5.0,,Spent late afternoon and watched sunset and the city lights come to life. Amazed at the endless view of Singapore high rise apartments in all directions and the hundreds of ocean freighters in gauge roads.
,,Safe the money and go the Bar/Restaurant up there to spend ticket fee on drinks,3.0,,"There is a bar amd restaurant up there, so instead of buying a ticket for 23 dollar just say you want to the bar and order a drink for that money instead!"
,,Singapore Gem,5.0,,Worth a visit to see Singapore from the sky. Panoramic is great. Take great photos. Then as you menander through the city take photos of the amazing building. Visit the underground shopping centre and browse the designer shops.
,,A Must for everyone visiting Singapore,5.0,,"The views are amazing of all of Singapore from the top.
We arrived just before sunset so we got to see Singapore before it got dark and also the night lights.
Also it meant that when were up on the deck it wasn't so hot which it might (most certainly) in the middle of the day
There is no time limit to stay up and after the viewing deck visit is complete you can go to the bar for drinks, if that is what you would like to do. Drinks aren't cheap but that is what you would expect from a roof top bar"
,,What a view,5.0,,"If you want to capture the stunning aerial view of the city then this is a must, from views to the harbour, over the botanical gardens or to see a part of the grand prix circuit then this is for you. Only 23sgd and worth it."
,,Best Roof Top view ..,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is the signature of Singapore .. A visit here is like a must for the visitors .. The view from the top is beautiful .. They charge you to go to the rooftop but you get a good experience .. Infinity pool is for the Hotel Guests so just not for the visitors ..
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark.,5.0,,"This fantastic roofpark and garden, offers some of the most incredible views in the world, stretching right across Singapore City, the Singapore Flyer, the Bay, Sentosa Island, and countryside towards Malaysia itself. Fast lifts speed you heavenwards for $23."
,,Great views,4.0,,"We visited the observation deck as part of our night tour of Singapore. The views from the top are wonderful and you get a good view of the whole of Singapore. It is great to be able to observe the light show below. A lot of queuing to be able to use the lifts to get to the top, and again when you wish to return to Level 1. There is a photo opportunity before you go up in the lifts but the photos are very overpriced. Worth visiting just for the views."
,,Great View of the City,4.0,,"I'm split on this one. You do get an amazing view of Singapore but not sure if it was worth the price. Still going to give it 4 stars though as we did enjoy going up. If you do decide to head up make sure you bring a hat or umbrella. There is no shaded area at the top. When the sun is beating down it gets really hot and humid.

We spent about 30 minutes in the skypark, took some pictures and headed back down. It just got way too hot and we were not prepared for that. Also remember, the entrance is only into one section of the Skypark. You do not have access to the pool. That is for hotel guest only. There is a bar at the top that sells overly priced drinks a d snacks. So if you do plan to spend some time here, pack some food and water."
,,Rooftop bar,5.0,,"Went to the rooftop bar. View was amazing. Food was great, but of course pricey because your'e paying for the view!"
,,over priced attraction,2.0,,"View is breath taking but exceptionally high (over 40 SGD) for an elevator ride, go up the super tree instead."
,,Meh,2.0,,Too much Vegas or Disneyland for me. I like natural beauty not manufactured beauty. I am not a fan of faking nice environments. I feel like this is fake. Singapore is an amazing city. Inserting Vegas into this beautiful place is a mistake in my opinion.
,,Maybe better at a distance,3.0,,This is a spectacular hotel from outside but inside was slightly underwhelming. Did not feel inclined to pay to go to the rooftop
,,Towers in the sky,3.0,,"The 3 towers of Marina Bay Sands dominate the Singapore skyline along with the Flyer (Ferris wheel). You just have to get to the top once if you are in this City! I’ve rated 4 instead of 5 stars because of the slight confusion on how it is organised at the beginning. So we enter Tower 3 on the ground (easy to get to). It IS possible to book a trip to the top from inside with a drinks package. We decide (mid afternoon) that we don’t want drinks. So they tell us to go down one floor to the observation only tour. We do that. They tell us that it is only one section of Tower three and as it is raining there is no cover at all. Nice of them to say. They say you might be better taking the drinks package tour from inside. We got back into the hotel lobby to queue again for a drinks package - only to be told that we can do this but we will be inside when up top and not allowed onto the perimeter to view at all. Why not I ask? “It’s owned by a different company”. So your choices are a package INSIDE so you don’t really experience walking around the edge of the boat in the sky, or OUTSIDE in which case you cannot go insider for a drink or food. No combination package is available. We took the outside tour. Got soaked but it was a great view, but the two companies who own this facility need to speak to one another to get a combined offering and share the profits!"
,,"Great views, amazing lightshow",5.0,,"It is definitely a popular tourist destination so get ready for lots of people, but the lightshow at 8pm, 9pm, and 10pm in front of the hotel is definitely worth it, coolest show I've seen in a long time.The hotel is also just cool in general, a lot of sights to see all around it. Recommend for sure."
,,Good views but exceptionally over priced,3.0,,"$US50 for a single fabricated photo, plus the same to get up the tower - a lot of money for a view of the city."
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Highly recommend the view from this hotel is absolutely amazing Walked by Jamie Foxx in the main lobby Lots of stores to shop in
,,Disapponting,2.0,,"While the view is good, the space is spartan and there is no where to sit. I was disappointed and didn't feel it was worth the entry fee."
,,Please return smokers places on the roof.,4.0,,"We stay at Marina Bay 3-d time. And this time we were surprised that, according to new regulations we have no place for smoke here. I understand all about health e t c, but then you drink your cocktail in the bar on the roof, your children fall in sleep you expecting that you could smoke you cigarette some there around, as minimum."
,,Must do!,5.0,,"Went to the sky park at night, amazing views of the city and the light show. This is a must for anyone visiting singapore."
,,Crazy.,3.0,,"This place is way, way, way too big. I realize that it's supposed to be enjoyed as the marvel of engineering which it is, and it is stunning, but it's absurd trying to navigate. The mall inside is worth seeing, but the prices are insane, even by Singaporean standards. It's cool, I guess, but I wouldn't go back on my next trip."
,,Best overview of city,4.0,,Even on a rainy day it was worth the experience. Wonderful place to view all of the unusual Singapore architecture.
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"You need a ticket to go up. You can skip the pricy tourist photo but still nice to see. The views are phenomenal and it’s a must if you’re into photography. You get a great view of the gardens, the flyer and the skyline."
,,"Good View, though not a full 360 panorama",4.0,,"It costs SGD23/pax per entry for unlimited duration. If you are a Citibank member, or an NTUC Union member, there are also discounts. But do not go up on a wet/rainy day. The glass panels become unclear and taking photos wont be good. Strong winds can also destroy your umbrellas.
(NB: Singapore is a tropical country and convectional rain is very common on a daily basis).
The space allowed on the deck is only a small area, and so you wont be able to go into the pool, or the other side of the Skypark, hence you are limited in the span of view. Nonetheless, if you like to see the skyline of Singapore, it is still a good choice.

The Singapore Flyer is your other option, at SGD33/pax, but 10% if you have certain discount cards, such as PassionCard."
,,Wonderful view,5.0,,"From the skypark you can take the best pictures from the Singapore skyline.
Very good cocktails and some great finger foods;)
Prices are okay i had to pay much more on the rooftop bar at lebua state tower in bangkok.
The staff is friendly not the fastest but you get your drinks;)
If you want to use the pool you have to book a room in the hotel which are not to expensive."
,,Skypark - top view -- Nice & Complete view of the Singapore City,4.0,,"The top view (which is like a boat) gives a good view of the entire city. In fact, from height point of view, this is higher than singapore flyer. Visiting this place in the evening (between 5.30 - 7.30) is very good. There is a ticket to this. However, if you have membership of Marina Bay Sands you get some discount. I have got the discount."
,,"its not what you expect,its very tour guide isle",4.0,,"i guess i was looking for comfort and view, not ques, costs, and exposure to elements. its not centerpoint , its the bridge climb without the harness or the steps.its ok, have the meal,see the civilized views and take in the atmosphere rather than the cattle muster."
,,My brother and sister in law were given a free 1night stay as a gift for their Wedding Anniversary at Marina Bay hotel..,5.0,,So lucky!! But how to show appreciation was enjoy the whole day in the room then at night at the sky Swimming pool!!
,,The clues in the title,5.0,,"Skypark......you feel like you are in the middle of the sky, 56/7? floors up.
Amazing views. You can see all that Singapore has to offer from here and then decide where you want to go.
Tea in the cafe took a while to arrive but was worth the wait. Watched the storm rolling in but still finished in time to get undercover."
,,A great view,5.0,,Well worth the trip to the top to view Singapore at night and see it lit up at night time.just great
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands complex has become an iconic part of the Singapore skyline so i would recommend traveling up to the Skypark for a birds eye view of Singapore.
There is a charge of course and there was a small queue before we took an escalator up.
As soon as you come out of the lift there is the typical green screen photo opportunity then you are free to browse around the deck. There s a small kiosk where you can purchase ice creams and drinks and a larger restaurant where you can dine and enjoy the views.
Part of the Skyparkk is for hotel guess only although you fan see from a distance the impressive infinity pool.
I do not like heights - the deck is very sturdy and I felt comfortable as long as I was not standing at the edge.
I definitely recommend this Singapore attraction."
,,GREAT VIEW BUT OVERPRICED,4.0,,"A couple of important things to be aware of - you only have access to one end (i.e. not the whole) of the ""surfboard"" covering the 3 buildings and if it rains you have no cover. To be fair, before you buy the tickets the person at the ticket counter clearly explains this to you. The views are fantastic but at SGD23 I thought it was overpriced. In addition, they take a photo of you and then present it very nicely in a folder - however, SGD 65 is excessive for this. I am glad we did it but next time we will do it when there is no rain and maybe at night."
,,Iconic structure but too expensive,3.0,,"whilst the building is now the most iconic in Singapore, i felt that paying ss23 just to go up to the top for a few minutes was a bit of a rip off. off course the view is impressive but not sure if it was worth the money."
,,Lookout,4.0,,We got a 10 % discount by using our Singapore Airlines boarding pass. The views were great but nowhere to sit. I had to laugh at being offered a photo of us taken downstairs for $65??? Apart from that it was well worth the visit.
,,A night with Marina Bay Sands View,4.0,,It was heavily raining on last dec 30th. So i took mrt orchard to marina. It cost me $1.60..from the station you need to walk out about 20mins before you reach to the raffles city n til you can see on ur right is the MBS.
,,Tour down under,3.0,,"Due to inclement weather we were advised at the entrance to come back another time. We did wonder why there were no queue!!!
In the end we went to the rooftop garden at the Art Gallery opposite the cricket ground which is free to see the skyline. Although not the same height you get a feel. The amount of negative reviews did put us off and I hope the management of the hotel take this on board and make positive changes."
,,Top of the world feeling,5.0,,"Come to be treated with a top of the world service and facilities. Situated in the central business district MBS is ideally located - cityscape view on the north side, sea view of the ocean and lots of ships on the south side. Walking distance from the best shopping malls the city has to offer. The infinity pool at the rooftop overlooks both the city on one side and the ocean on the other side. The gym is first class as are the few rooms. Given another opportunity, I'll stay at MBS anytime."
,,Great view for drinking the most expensive beer of your life.,3.0,,"We stayed until sunset, had an amazing view and lucky to grab a small table. That said this place, like any bar on the top of a hotel, is ridiculously over-priced and jammed with tourists. I have to imagine there is a better option for a better value if you go looking."
,,Fantastic !,5.0,,"Travelling with adult son and this attraction was definitely his choice. However, I absolutely loved it.
As we waited (short time) to buy our tickets it was clear that many people didn’t realise what this is and decided not to go.
It is ‘only’ the very large viewing area and not the pool which is for hotel guests only.
There is a lovely cafe bar though for all visitors.
As we arrived at the deck the low clouds cleared and the views were amazing. We stayed nearly an hour taking in this spectacular. Well worth every penny.
Perhaps not so exciting in poor weather !"
,,LOVED THE VIEW,4.0,,"Hotel is huge and luxurious. We walked through it to get to the Skypark on 57th floor. (Lovely cake shop just as you enter the hotel .. worth a treat). Yes, it is full of tourists who need to go through the hotel to access the Skypark, so beware of that if you're thinking of staying in the hotel. But tourists aren't allowed to use the infinity pool so it's not totally overrun. Tickets only allow you to access to the boat shaped observation deck but it's ample to see the magnificent skyline. Group photos are a little expensive and sales technique is fairly full on, but you can always say no, or decline to have your photo taken at all."
,,Excellent view!,5.0,,Expensive hotel but worth a visit just because the view. Didn't expect they should be so nice and welcoming children at the level they did.
,,Less is more,3.0,,"I realize i am not a special customer or pretend to be one, i realize this is a huge hotel with so many people to cater for must be a huge ask of the staff and teams.
I feel very strong and passionate about good and consistent service and especially one of your unique hotel experiences in Singapore the expectation of the client grows.
we booked a club room to allow use of pool and gardens by the bay cost at $600++ a night why???
Before i commence with the negatives,which i will be making a review later on,i am a fair person and have fair expectations, quite humble and straight approach in life and firstly i would like to point out the positives.Thank you for creating a private members check in service was a delightful way to begin our stay and AI couldn't do enough for us great customer service. the room and the views amazing the decor a little Vegas would have been nicer more traditional Singapore/ Asia style but pleasant enough, lovely bathroom and bath heavenly.
Plenty of choice to eat in or out. A lovely birthday cake surprise thank you.

Now for the negatives and if had only been one or two you probably wouldn't heard from me......
On our first afternoon we checked out the pool top area very full and loud asked to have a table for 2 in the restaurant Spago almost empty shown to a middle table not one with a view why?
Both tea afternoons held at the club room only club55 was nothing short of chaos with seating people and long queues. Sat down cakes a little tasteless and disappointing selection. On both canapes evenings had to wait for the queue to go down and offered champagne on the first evening not offered on second evening. The staff were quite rude and abrupt with our table and as a result i had to keep asking for a drink instead of being offered one.

As you can see as a high paying customer per night per stay i have the right to feel a little let down by this major player hotel. I always thought paying at club level, especially at your hotel, you gained the more stylish and extravagant experience i however feel the club level rooms are over accommodated/ populated and as a result the club has become in your hotel a self serving room as a cruise liner would have adults like herds of sheep whilst the views were breathtaking it doesn't win us over with the mass noise and lack of ambiance in the club 55 room.

We sat Sunday and Monday 7th and 8th January at the window seat side of the gardens at canapes and drinks and the lady staff on these days were rude judgmental and quite frankly snobby. We were one of the few guests who dressed up for these special club 55 dress attire and we were made to feel like we were walked over and tramps.

As you can imagine not a nice feeling and to be ignored or watch the glasses to see if you need another drink or even worse ""you must finish your glass before we get you another one madame"", when your drink is nearly to the bottom is nothing short of offensive.
We paid well over the odds for the privileges and feel we would rather revisit a less busy hotel on our return to Singapore as our previous 2 night stay was in another field of class and treated the customer as if they were the only customer in the room.
We always wondered what it would be like to be on a cruise ship i think we can tick this off our bucket list now after staying at the Marina Bay Sands probably Las Vegas too. Shame this hotel is not about class as quantity will never make up for quality.

I feel your staff could improve the chaos in the club 55 with time slots for afternoon teas/ Canapes or hold them in 2 different settings so noise ambiance can be spread and staff as well as the guests could enjoy this together.

As i stated earlier in my email i care about good service, standards and feel more could be improved on and hope The Marina Bay Sands continues to drive the success further and higher than we experienced.

One day we could be special V.I.P.s and then a top critic could be writing a serious article on the downsides of big hotels. I am hoping this is not the norm for most people and we have been a little unlucky with staff/ timings.

Believe me we found nicer better and far more luxurious accommodation in Singapore and so thankful for all they did for us as it made up for the lack of care and concern from the ,Marina Bay Sands."
,,Marina bay sands skypark,5.0,,"Another one to consider is visiting the Marina Bay Sands Skypark.The boat shape hotel you can’t be missed. You can eat ,skate stroll and got to top skypark and view the beauty of Singapore"
,,"Great views, shopping center beneath",5.0,,"Incredible views from the deck. Afterwards, go to the shopping center that is underneath the building. It is quite incredible with great shopping and great eating places."
,,I am not sure why you have to pay so high to just see the city.,1.0,,Nothing worth the price they charge going on top. This should be avoided and Singapore Flyer should be considered. Only the front part is open and yes they take a snap and then they sell it to you for SGD 65$ how business minded. Only 10% of the front portion is open to tourist rest is only for their esteemed guest. Please Avoid this completely waste of your money.
,,A MUST for fantastic views,4.0,,Reasonable entrance fee and the views are magnificent. Be warned though - VERY HOT up there. Restaurant only opens up at 12pm so would recommend going up that time if you want to have a bite to eat.
,,Hotel feels like a Tourist zoo,3.0,,"We had dinner here during our stay in Singapore. Great views and good food.
A fun place for a few hours. However the hordes of tourists who are here only to take selfies destroy the experience a little and I would never stay here. The guests wear armbands that let them into the parts reserved for hotel guests only, however it is a bit like being tagged and so doesn’t seem like a nice experience.

Too many people here overall have it that Zoo feeling."
,,Great views from this skypark,5.0,,Views are great. This is little on the expensive side. One can chose between Singapore flyer or this one.
,,What a stunning benue,5.0,,"A lovely way to round off a day in the gardens. We purchased a ticket ($23) up to the Cest la Vie bar that included a drink and access to 2 areas in the sky park but not direct Access to walk the sky park.
I don’t think we missed out on a lot not walking the park itself. Stunning views and nice food to purchase."
,,Stunning Views!,4.0,,"The observation deck offers stunning views across the city, particularly in the evening when everywhere lights up! It is around 23 Singapore dollars which isn't too bad!"
,,Architectural excellence,4.0,,What a stunning building capping the whole marina bay experience .yes it’s expensive but this marvel of engineering is a Singapore must . This and the other gems built around it are part of what makes Singapore the great travel destination it is
,,Fantastic,5.0,,What can one say about this place. The view is worth the cost of admission if you need to pay. Staff friendly. Drinks reasonable price
,,Great view,5.0,,One must visit the place and enjoy the Singapore skyline as well beautiful structure with Singapore sling which is available at the top.
,,Visited 2010 to 2013,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore even for a stopover then this place is a must! If you have the fortune to live here for a while, as I did, make sure you visit for the New Year festivities or just do a staycation as it is the most perfect place to enjoy yourself, whether you want to relax or party the night away."
,,Worth the view,4.0,,The bar on the 57th floor offers a cheap option for appreciating the view. Go up for sunset and stay for the 8pm light show. Drinks are about $18-24 each so be prepared. Great 360 views of the city so worth it in my books.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Well worth visit for the views, although a little expensive. My wife and I visited in December not very busy."
,,Walking,5.0,,Can see view of central bisnuss district of singapore ..merlion .. high rise financial area .. 5* hotels ..n many more
,,Amazing city-view,4.0,,We didn't go to the view-deck but instead visited the restaurant on the 57th floor. You pay 20 S$ per person to get up and get a drink-voucher for the same value. The restaurant has a lounge and a bar (on either side of the building) so that you get a pretty good view of the city. We enjoyed spending some time in the lounge and drinking our (ridiculously expensive) 23-S$ Cocktail. It's still worth it!
,,Amazing View of Singapore,5.0,,"We bought 4 tickets (S$23/each) to go up floor 56th to Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck over Christmas period. It's not crowded at all. Can see the whole of Singapore miles and miles away. I paid nothing with similar view while staying at the hotel in Bangkok and had rooftop bar seeing the skyline of the city at night. It was a bit overpriced just for the view. However, when you are the tourist who's already be there you have got to do it. There were souvenirs shops there but the staff seemed a bit not interested to do the job."
,,Worth the line and money!,5.0,,"The views of Singapore from this place were well worth any lines or cost. You won’t be up here for a long period of time, but the views are breath-taking. If you find yourself in the Marina Bay area, this is definitely a must do! Tip- come at night... the views are much more impressive."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"The Skypark is easy to reach from Bayfront MRT station or anywhere around Marina Bay. Although not the cheapest attraction, the Skypark is a great place once you're up there. Offering excellent views of Marina Bay, the Gardens and the Financial District to name a few, the Skypark is well worth a visit."
,,Great views & photo opportunities,4.0,,"My husband & I were in Singapore at the start of November & did all the main tourist attractions. We didn’t realise beforehand that you had to pay to visit the observation deck & when we were in the elevator 2 guys behind us were mocking the visitors who had paid as apparently you can just visit the bar at the top & see the views without paying. Anyhow, we really enjoyed the observation deck & as it was a clear day we managed to take some amazing photos of Singapore from there. We thought it was worth a visit but obviously at a cost."
,,New Years Eve,5.0,,"We went to the Skypark for the NYE countdown. We got there at 10pm, light rain, enjoyed champagne, but by 11pm it was a down pour and we left. Without us requesting, we were notified two days later that they refunded us in full for the 4 tickets! They didn’t have to do that! Tickets said rain or shine. MBS Is amazing like that! We’re staying there again in a few months and yes, I’m going back to Skypark to enjoy the view!!"
,,Very bad experience... Should never come!,1.0,,"We are stuck here for 2 hours doing nothing! Took a long time waiting to get on the elevator to the sky park. The lady who's at the elevator managing people to get inside was so rude & so mean. After coming up, walk a bit & we technically have to queue up for elevator down, more than an hour! Even though the view is great, it's such a waste of our times! Purely bad management to blame. For hundreds of people, I only see 3-4 staffs to handle these many people. Many of them at photo booths, busy trying to sell us photos we don't want! Some at ticket booth. But just 1 for each floor, handling 3 elevators, with hundreds of people in the line.(entrance 2 floors; exit 2 floors) I never write bad review ever, never want to. But this time I almost cry! Plus, people cut the lines & no one can do anything about it. So..., think hard before you go, especially on Saturday night!"
,,Amazing views of Singaporee,5.0,,"One of my favourite cities in the world. Love Singapore and really love MBS great place for dinning, entertainment and also to watch fire works. Best views of Singapore and Singapore skyline. Great for dayouts, high-end shopping as well"
,,Must place to see in singapore,5.0,,One altitude is the place in Marina Bay where can enjoy singapore sling with original taste and enjoy the view
,,Higher than the Singapore Flyer,5.0,,"This observation park is higher than the Singapore Flyer. So you get a bigger and better view of the entire city. Also has a restaurant, so dining here with the view in front of you is simply mesmerizing. The observation park is not free so, if you're a foreign tourist who has flown in by Singapore Airlines, you are entitled to a 10 or 15% discount. Simply ask at the counter to get your discount. The view is worth every penny. Visit during the night. Easily accessible via Marina Bay Sands Metro Station."
,,Beautiful and breath taking,5.0,,"These gardens are the best on our earth. The skywalk is stunning especially at sunset. You don’t even have to do the skywalk if you don’t want to, you can lay at the bottom and watch the “trees” light up on the grass. This is a bucket list item, cannot recommend enough."
,,Brunch at Midday at Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Enjoyed Brunch with family and friends. Clean with an exceptional view of the bay. Food delicious and nicely served. Hospitality staff very courteous.
,,Simply amazing...,5.0,,Love it love it love it... Singapore is one of top 3 cities of my life. Marina is amazing and absolutely extraordinary place you have to visit. Take a elevator to skywalk and you're done (:
,,overrated,3.0,,"A local once told me, the best thing is to look at the MBS and not from the MBS. Just another high elevated viewpoint in singapore."
,,Not worth it,3.0,,"Avoid if you suffer from vertigo and need somewhere to sit down at the top. Yes, the view is great but that really is it."
,,the rooftop was INCREDIBLY AWESOME!,4.0,,"Try to swim or enjoy yourself in rooftop swimming pool of the skypark. yess, there's bar too.. amazing."
,,£23 per person per visit,5.0,,I decided it was a tad too expensive when I realised you only get to wander the pointed bit of the roof. We waited and waited and decided against it then when we went outside it started to rain so more than happy I didn’t waste my money. We wanders through the hotel but felt more like a shopping mall. The gardens has a walkway through the hotel to get to the main road for transport home
,,View Singapore skyline,5.0,,"One of the main reasons I would suggest is just to pass the marina Bay Sands Hotel magnificent pool. The viewing deck is spacious, you can view the city from up above. Just a nice experience."
,,Being there,5.0,,After seeing so many pictures of Marina Bay Sands Skypark going up there and experiencing it was well worth it. There is a charge about 20 S$ to go up to the bar but it counts towards your drink.
,,To Die for,5.0,,"This really is a must do destination. MBS is man made tourist attraction and what an attraction it is. The building is amazing and the view from the skypark fantastic.

The views of the bay (the shipping lane is fascinating how they queue up), although the see through barriers add to the fun (I cant stand heights).

I cant recommend this enough although next time I return I will do the inifinity pool which requires a stay in the hotel.

Wonderful"
,,Amazing for sightseeing.,5.0,,"Although we couldn't get right to the top, we went to the viewing deck which was amazing. The views of Singapore are fantastic. It was Xmas when we were there and there was a cost to go up. I believe it is free other times of the year. Worth the small cost though."
,,Great view,4.0,,A nice walk and amazing lookout to view the city and some of the Singapore highlights like the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
,,Beautiful views of city,4.0,,"We bought our tickets and made our way to the lift where we had to queue for a while but then when we entered the lift they filled it with as many people as possible squeezing everyone in as much as possible.
We got to the top and the views from the top were amazing you could almost walk around the whole way. Definitely visit at night for the best views!"
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Definitely worth the visit! If you are a tourist and flew in on Singapore Airlines- bring along your boarding pass and receive discounted entry.
Do not go up without your camera. The views are spectacular.
Tickets only allow entry to the Deck area and the pool or Restaurant & Bar."
,,MBS Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"The signature of the bay. MBS Marina Bay Sands. Shopping, convention, eating, hotel, casino, leisure.....all in. Spend a day there will be a relax and fun time. A bit high cost so bare with it. You may reach there By MRT Bayfront. Enjoy!"
,,Best views for taking Singapore pictures,4.0,,"Best vintage point to view and enjoy the Singapore skyline and Gardens. It is not moving constantly like the Singapore Flyer and it is a lot higher. Best of all, you may stay as long as needed, so there is no rash to enjoy the views."
,,Must visit place in singapore,4.0,,Beautiful view of the city from the marina bay observation deck. Noting much though. But if you visit Singspore you got to visit the marina bay sands it gives you a look of the infinity pool.
,,57 Stories high,5.0,,"absolutley stunning building, looks like a ship on top of the three structures, what a view from the top, the middle building takes you to the hotel where you can have a coffee or beer or even something to eat, not to be missed if you are in Singapore"
,,Super at the top bar,5.0,,"Make sure you go to the top bar, close to the pool. Great views and certainly worth the (a little expensive) drinks!"
,,Magnificent View,5.0,,"Went on a tour of the marina bay Sands the view is something special,I would recommend going there before 9.30 pm as the wait to get up was quick but getting down took over an hour .In all fairness it could have been due to the New Years celebrations"
,,Not worth the visit,2.0,,The sands sky park is a long walk from the gardens by the bay. An elevator whisks us to the 55th floor. We can have a good view of the city from the top. There is not much else to pass time.
,,Amazing views!,4.0,,This is well worth a visit to take in the amazing views around the city. With its high vantage point you can see for miles from the skypark. I am not great with heights and did find it a little scary if I got too close to the edge but I would still go again! The only criticism I have is that there is no shade from the heat of the sun which was pretty relentless on the day.
,,Visited,5.0,,Wonderful. Great place to be especially with children. Tickets sold this old closer to the attractions.
,,what a view!!,5.0,,"I have been to empire state building and burj khalifa yet i loved sky park as its a little low down so the view is better.
The view is relatable and we were lucky to catch the laser show from top.
360degrees view of the singapore skyline at night was truly worth it."
,,Wow,5.0,,"So there are two ways to see the sky park
Be a guest of the hotel or purchase ticket to bar
At rooftop ( pricey bar) for lunch and drinks .
Great view of all of Singapore from up there so worth it in my opinion . Great drinks and food too . The famous infinity pool is also up there to the left of the bar you may or may not be allowed to see the pool area they can close it off if they feel it’s too many people. The guest can become overwhelmed . Of course only guest can swim in the pool as well . Don’t pass up the shops and restaurants on lobby level of hotel they are outstanding . Of course only the best at this hotel . Runs like well oiled machine ."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Top of the marina bay sands hotel. Overlooking the bay and the flyer. Good overall view, but you cannot access the swimming pool, which is accessible only to hotel guests."
,,"Overbusy, underspecial",3.0,,"A stunning piece of architecture, but as a hotel it feels a bit too much like tourist-central nowadays - good sized rooms, and close to the MBS shops and gardens by the bay, but you'll feel a bit like one of the crowd. Want a bed on the sun-deck? Better be out there before 9am."
,,Beautiful view from the skypark,5.0,,"My family and I had the luxury of staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel . During our stay we went to experience the Skypark. Located on the 57th floor of the hotel, the pool is the main attraction , being an infinity pool located right at the edge overlooking the Marina. It's a great photo opportunity while swimming in the pool. There are a lot of lounging chairs set up around the pool and other areas as well. I found the place too overcrowded , it was really hard to relax. Towels are provided at the pool to all hotel guests. There is also a photographer that goes around the pool area to take photos and then one can view the photos and other prints or view them online or have the photos put in a souvenir album. There is also a restaurant by the poolside. Each guest is required to have a room key to enter the Skypark, so all individuals registered in each room should have their own room key for this purpose."

,,You have to go but we didn’t stay long,3.0,,"One of the ‘must see’s’ for Singapore. We went to the top and had a cocktail and it was nice, a good view. It was a bit crowded and not that relaxing, and the public area was fenced off to the side where the hotel guests were, which I didn’t really like that much."
,,Looks good from the outside,3.0,,"We arrived at the sky park on a very hot afternoon, it was crowded with expensive drinks and very limited and uncomfortable seating"
,,Best garden in the world,5.0,,Amazing garden probably the best indoor garden of the world ! It is also the best attraction in Singapore at the moment . The cloud forest and flower dome are the highlights but the rest of the open area as well!
,,Another top notch landmark,5.0,,Engineering and architecturally awe inspiring that is an absolute must.The views are to die for but also needs to be appreciated at ground level
,,Worth going up for the experience,4.0,,You have to pay $20 per person to go up to the rooftop bar but you can put it towards a drink ( you will pay a little on top). It’s worth it for the amazing views especially at sunset. It also means you don’t have to stay at the hotel !
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Came here at night after visiting the Supertree Grove. Great views of Singapore skyline. There was an unexpected show beneath where the casino is which was great to see. Very expensive bar service but there is a restaurant on top as well which would be great to eat at if planned ahead with seating on the edge to take advantage of the city view.
,,Great views over Marina Bay and the CBD,4.0,,"The Skypark overlooks Marina Bay and on a clear day you can see out to the edges of the island.

There is a small kiosk with drinks and snacks. Entrance is reasonable but photos in front of a green screen are priced ridiculously - $23 to enter, $50 for a photo!
If you're staying in the hotel then it's free."
,,Must see,4.0,,Wonderful view at night. There is long queue at dusk. Ticket price is 23S$ in 2017. Arrangement of the queue is not well.
,,My favourite building in the world!,5.0,,"This beautiful building in Singapore is awesome and an architectural masterpiece. Theire are many expensive shops inside - but it is lovely to walk through. In one section it as a Venice style waterway and you can ride a ""Gondola"" - a bit chesesy, but good if you have small children. You can pay $23 Singapore to go up to the 56th floor observation deck - definitely worth the experience for the awesome view. You don't get acess to the bar or infinity pool - wnich is a shame, but understandable."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,Really enjoyed it and worth a visit as the views are great. The casino is pretty cool and lots of nice shops
,,Birthday drinks,5.0,,"We visited here on two occasions during our short stay.
Really excellent place for a drink. It does get very busy so and when we were there lots of people were smoking at the tables, so much that it was getting in the way of such a great night.
The view and vibe was amazing, one of the best places we went on the trip."
,,It's just a must see,5.0,,We went at night time so we could watch the Garden by the Bay lights from the top at 7:45pm and then the Marina light show at 8pm. View was spectacular.
,,Lines were obscene,1.0,,Went here at 9pm on a Friday night and the queues were insane. Came down the escalators and it was impossible to see where the ticket line started as it had blended into the skypark line up point. It was also not moving. I have happily lined up at other similar attractions around the world but when lines are mixing and nobody seems to be moving....alarm bells. Singapore Flyer was a much better experience.
,,The view that could kill!,5.0,,"I got the 3 day ultimate singapore attractions pass... which made things a little easy for me..
It was the first place i visited...
Amazingly beautiful view from the top. The place is always always full of people... so booking prior for a table to have a drink is required...the lift going up these floors... made me feel a little dizzy...
But when the door opended..and i saw the view...
I knew it was sooooo worth it.."
,,Business stay,1.0,,Terrible as the toilet choked! The noise from the bottom can be heard from the room! Not much choice of food as it’s expensive and taste bad!
,,Amazing viewd,5.0,,"Stayed at the hotel so had free access but would recommend it to anyone the views are truly amazing , go at dusk and watch the light show at the gardens by the bay very nice"
,,Panaromic View of Singapore,5.0,,Sands SkyPark is one of the best place to visit in Singapore. It is on the 57th floor of the hotel. Best time to enter the observation deck is an hour before sunset and experience the awesome panaromic view of Singapore till night. It's worth the visit.
,,Go to scarbos 4 best view and food,5.0,,We went to buy tickets 2 go up 2 skywalk and we met a guy who said save yourselves $100 and go to scarbos restaurant and have some great tapas and a few tigers so we did and it was awesome.Highly recommend
,,An Amazing Experience,5.0,,"From the Skypark you can easily admire a beautiful 360 degree view including the marina bay, the laser water show, the wonderful towers, the Singapore Flyer, the stadium and much more.
It is highly recommended to go there at night so that you can enjoy the amazing light shows from the towers, the Singapore flyer and even the Marina Bay laser water show from a top view.
I even got a family photo with the Marina Bay Sands as background."
,,This place is a sham,1.0,,"This place is a sham.

1. Assume flawless customer service: Once you enter the actual deck, you’ll see that it’s so obviously a cash cow. The views you see from the deck can just as easily be seen from one of the bridges near the Merlion park. Plus you get to see the Marina Bay Sands as well from those bridges. So the SkyPark really defeats its own purpose because the Sands is a pivotal part of the Singapore skyline. Definitely not worth SGD23. You don’t even get to enter the infinity pool area unless you’re a guest.

2. Is the quality of customer service actually flawless, at least? Definitely not. In fact, I would call it disingenuous at best. When we were buying the tickets, we asked if we can enter the deck twice (at day and at night). To be sure, we asked the same question twice, each question phrased differently. We were told we could as long as it’s within the same day, only to be told later on that we couldn’t. It really put a damper on the already mediocre experience. It would’ve been fine as long as we were given the information we needed, so at least we could have planned to enter at night (which we would’ve preferred if we had to choose), but we weren’t. I’m not sure if the sales personnel are given a quota, but there’s definitely a lie or a cheat somewhere there.

If you insist on visiting the SkyPark despite all this, I’d recommend you (1) visit at nighttime, and (2) not buy from Vincent. Otherwise you’ll find yourself paying SGD23 for an elevator ride."
,,Full 360 view,5.0,,It's just great to be on the top and see light show from the top. Some great music and super views and good food. What else you need for the evening in Singapore
,,WOW Experince,5.0,,At 56th floor you are on top of everything. The flyer the Merlion Park the Marina Bay and on top of that the view of the sailing ships. You can't ask more while sipping a coffee. One must not miss it and the view is just awesome .
,,View of SG from the MBS Skypark,5.0,,"A beautiful $23 top-down 180 degree view of Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer, and Gardens By The Bay from the Observation Deck of the Skypark."
,,Marina Bay Skypark.,5.0,,"Not for budget travellers but a really cool view of the city, bay and gardens. After you can visit the connected upmarket mall and casino."
,,The perfect view,5.0,,The perfect view in Singapore. I suggest to arrive there around 5pm because you can see the sunset also. It is amazing!!!
,,Nice view,4.0,,A very nice view of the Singapore background on top of its iconic towers. Only go to the skypark when you booked a hotel with Marina Bay Sands! I personally think that paying for tickets will not be a wise thing to do. A good place to relax!
,,An incredible place,4.0,,"I went there to have a drink by night at the Ce La Vi bar.
The place is amazing it looks like you are flying over the city .. all those lights within the buildings and also the view on the harbor.
You can enjoy a great variety of drinks.
A nice place for either a party or a drink with a so single person."
,,Xmas Eve,5.0,,A bit of a queue but worthwhile- view and lights very good. Fast lift to the top and down. Staff do move you along at busy times. Views across the gardens excellent.
,,nice view from the top,4.0,,"This palce will allow you to see the great bird eye view of the city with a great windy experience, We also had a quick drink at the top store and it was quite refreshing. The view is really stunning..."
,,Great Singapore view,5.0,,"I was considering to book a singapore flyer flight when the receptionist at my hostel offered this instead. He said that if I go to this place, I can get a better view of Singapore and get to stay as long as I would like at this place. He was so true although I visited this place a little bit late. I got here around 19.00 where the best time to visit here is during the sunset. Probably better to visit here around 18.00 until late. It is a floor away from the infamous infinity pool."
,,Stopover in Singapore,4.0,,"The restaurant at the 57th level is a great place to have your breakfast if you have some hours left. Then we recommend a walk in the Park (maybe a visit to the cloud forest museum)... walk thru the mall. Head of towards china town, grab a snack in a food market and then of to the airport."
,,What a building,4.0,,"Well this is an unbelievable piece of modern building aritechture. The foyeur resembles an airport arrivals lounge, so many people around checkimg in and out. The link to the shopping centre is easy and the view from the deck on the 56 floor on a clean day is fantastic."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Never seen a view as awesome like this before. Really worth going. Picture perfect moment with your love ones.
,,Sky deck,5.0,,Its a place to relax and have a panormic view of whole city...visit at night and spend atlest 30 mins...
,,Exciting View from the bay,5.0,,"I visit Singapore oftentimes and always have time to see the bay around the marina bay sands skypark, gorgeous looks with very professional landscaping."
,,View from the top,5.0,,"It took a while to find the starting point for the excursion but a nice man showed us the way!
Having paid for the tickets (discount if you've recently flown on Singapore Airlines) we whisked to the top in the elevator.
The views of Singapore from the observation deck are stunning! All the way from the anchorage to Malaysia. The Singapore Flyer looked small from the top.
Hard to comprehend that you're 200m high and there is nothing underneath you! Luckily, there was no glass floor...
There is food and drink available at the top but it ain't cheap! Same goes for the photography they try and sell you.
All up, a great experience - shame it's only the 29th tallest building in Singapore!"
,,A must see at night,4.0,,This park is located at the top of the Marina Sands hotel at the edge of the Harbour and overlooks the Bay. It also provides an incredible view of The Gardens by the Bay park which is a definite must see attraction. The Skypark observation deck provides a full 360 view of Singapore. This deck sits on top of the distinctive three massive structured Marina Sands Hotel and can be seen from most everywhere on the city so we used it many times as our compass when out touring every day.
,,Singapore at 57th storey!,4.0,,We managed to go here cause we are guest of MBS. I was Glad we have the privileged to enter the area. you could watch the sunset here. It’s amazing!
,,Overrated!,3.0,,I was expecting so much when we had the opportunity to go the Skypark or MBS sky lounge. We even have to make a reservation at the restaurant to make sure we get seats! But all the hype was totally gone when we reached the restaurant. I suggest you just stick with the lounge area to save cost! The pool was also crowded and a lot of people would stare at you when you go swimming! It was a total disappointment.
,,Outstanding views of Singapore,5.0,,This is the most spectator view of Singapore. This is truly a must see if you are visiting Singapore.
,,"Wow, what a view!",4.0,,"We were only there to get a Singapore Sling and to get that fantastic shot of Singapore from above and did not get disappointed. The Singapore sling was great also. They have a bar on one end, an infinity pool in the middle (you had to be a guest to get in there) and an overlook of the city on the other end that we opted not to pay to do. It cost us $23 Singapore dollars a piece to go up and then reimbursed that amount for our drinks. We also had a great tasting pizza as well!"
,,Tourist trap but you cannot beat the views!,4.0,,This is a total tourist trap but I got a deal in the VIP Tower which is the 3rd tower. As soon as you walk in there is a massive amount of people so definitely ask for the last tower which has an empty checkin desk and its close to the rooftop pool and roofdeck bar. Pool gets pretty crowded but sunrise seemed to be the best time to go...
,,The views will blow you away,5.0,,"Get ready for a selfie! Even if that's not your usual thing, you would be hard pressed not to take a picture from here. Stunning place to watch the sunset."
,,Great views,4.0,,Lots to look at b4 the sun goes down and then light shows later. Worth a visit. Would have loved to try the infinity pool but need to be a guest to do that. Will have to come back!
,,Incredible view!!!,5.0,,Its a must visit. An even better if you stay at the hotel. They have restaurants and bars on the top floor.
,,Highlight of the stay!,4.0,,"This is definitely the highlight of our stay, the view of skyline is awesome, pool is great.
On a good weather, worth a stay for a couple of hours to enjoy it.

We went on a cloudy day, with the strong wind, it can be very chilling."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,A quick lift takes you up to a stunning view (a night visit is a must). A walk around the whole building takes in views from all different angles. A must to see.
,,fav place in singapore,5.0,,一my personal fav place in singapore with awesome views and grt atmosphere can spend as.much time u.want
,,Good view of the city,5.0,,"We went around evening.. So we could see both day and night view of the city.. Go around 6:30 that's when Singapore gets darker.. Relax and view , have drinks. This place has a bar, but it is crowded. So go early to get best viewing seats. Spent good time.."
,,Good but service need to improve,3.0,,"The place is too crowded with people, we were waited for a good 10mins at the restaurant counter before the staff attend us and not so friendly as well. The food and drink is good."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Is a must! 20 bucks per person and you can enjoy a drink with a great view. Open until 10pm and you should were appropriate clothes.
,,Free,5.0,,Love this place.. its free for me and my friends to go there cause we have some other friends who stay there for holiday. Such a beautifull scenery from the top.
,,Excellent View,5.0,,You get the best shots of the city from up here. Be ready to fight your way thru the selfie sticks and choice spots to take your pics.
,,Super super NEAT!!,5.0,,"I will say, that this was just SUPER FRIGGIN COOL TO LOOK AT, WALK ON, go into..Lots happening here..So dress up, dress down go ANYTIME of the day for a different experience!"
,,Worth the money if you plan it right!,4.0,,"The skypark offers a view of the center of the city state. The views are breath taking from the 56th floor.
Timings are 9AM till 10PM. Longer on weekends occasionally.

Best time to visit is after 6PM when it starts to get slightly dark and the city lights are switched on. Wander along the perimeter amount the views, and you can grab some quick bites in the stall. Reasonably priced for a place like this (Singaporeans will understand what I mean). There is a restaurant on the sub above level here. Where you can sit and enjoy a drink and the view. But please note that, once you enter the restaurant, you cannot enter the observation deck again, and can only exit the skypark from there. Hence plan accordingly.

After about an hour of view and selfies and photos, around 7.30/45 PM, reach the side from where you can view the Gardens by the bay. The light show will start, and you can watch it for free from here. You need to pay to enter the Gardens by the bay area on the ground. So enjoy it from here, you will see most of the lights, and with the occasional draft the music also carries.
After this, head on to the other side of the deck to view the laser light show in front of the promenade, merlion. I was lucky enough to watch the star wars themed show on the day of the last Jedi release.
So, apart from the panoramic views, you can enjoy the light shows if you plan the time right and get back with 3 for the price if 1.
Cheers!"
,,Great views at night,4.0,,"We went on an evening tour, which this was included, we felt a little rushed, but worth a look over Singapore at night, so maybe best to go under your own steam..oh and expect another photo , pricey if your on your own, bit cheaper through the tour."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Access to the swimming pool area are now restricted to hotel guests only but you can buy tickets for the skypark .The Views here are slightly better as you have clear views of the singapore eye and F1 track . Well worth a visit .
,,Amazing city view,4.0,,"You can see the amazing city skyline up above in the skydeck. Be amazed by it. However, there is nothing much to do except for the view."
,,Mesmerizing sight...,5.0,,"We did not stay there but the whole area surrounding was beautiful. The lightnings, the shopping places & watch Singapore in evenings from there was lovely."
,,"Beutiful view, not supprising as expected",4.0,,From the sky deck you can see almost everything. I had good experience and was so happy to be there.
,,Great views of the City and Gardens by the Bay!,5.0,,"This large platform is suspended via cantilever above the hotel and affords amazing views of the surrounding city. Unlike the infinity pool, you do NOT have to stay at the Hotel to enjoy the skypark. When you get up there, you can stay on the large observation platform and take photos. The railing is all glass so it makes for better views. There is also a small souvenir store, café and restaurant/bar. Make sure to go around both sides of the platform, as well as far end, to see all the vantage points. I believe the observation area is roughly 55 floors above the street."
,,Nice outing,5.0,,Marina bay sands sky park offer nice walking trail for the public at all ages. It is suitable for all ages ideal place for family outing or couples
,,Great view. Unhelpful staff,3.0,,When I got to cash desk it deck was closed because of rain. They said no idea when opened and didn’t suggest I wait. I was about to leave then opened. Unfortunately only open for 30 mins when asked to leave. No apology no or offer if refund. Great views though and wouldn’t miss it.
,,Over hyped,3.0,,"We had heard a lot about this place, so we landed up here all excited. Honestly, it was not great. You can get a good view of the city and that's about it. The bar is like any other bar and they don't serve any food."
,,Great views,4.0,,Worth the time and experience when in Singapore. Cost just over $20 to go to the top. Need to be a guest to see close up infinity pool. Could do with a better public restaurant offer when up there.
,,An amazing experience. Some tips & tricks make it better though!,4.0,,"As first time visitors to Singapore, Marina Bay Sands was on the top of our list to visit and experience. We headed off in a cab (which is easy and affordable to do in Singapore). We arrived having been given the tip to ask to go to CE LA VI restaurant (located within the Sky Park) instead of just entering the general Sky Park area.
As our taxi dropped us on the opposite side of the road, it was quite a challenge to actually head over to the Sky Park entrance (so I would specify to the taxi driver that you want to go to Sky Park, rather than just Marina Bay Sands as we said). We enquired at a general enquiry counter as we couldn't work out how to get over the road (it's a big road!) and also asked about making a booking at CE LA VI restaurant. If that is something you are interested in, I would recommend you book some time in advance! It is quite highly priced (to much for us) and it was booked out anyway. Amazingly we were offered an opportunity to ""squeeze in"" for the small additional charge of $500 SD. We declined that fantastic and generous offer and wandered over and paid the $20 admission to enter the general bar area of CE LA VI. The good thing about this charge is that you can redeem it on a drink from their bar. CE LA VI is set back from the edge of the Marina Bay Sands but you can still admire the amazing views of the Singapore skyline. If you walk around to the side of the building that looks out over Gardens on the Bay, you can get right up to the edge however and also get a glimpse of the infinity pool to your right. The bar area is very crowded and busy and we had to shuffle forward to finally get a position at the front where we could enjoy our $27SD drinks and take in the view. There is smoking in this area which was a little annoying as we had our 17 year old daughter with us, plus lots of full ashtrays on the tables.

My daughter and I returned to Marina Bay Sands they following night (sans husband) and entered via the general viewing entrance ($26SD...or about). This was a great experience. No drink included but it wasn't as crowded and we could get more aspects and photos of the Singapore skyline. Both experiences were worthwhile and two visits was also a good idea too (if you have time).

Something not to miss while you're in Singapore !"
,,Seeing is believing,5.0,,"The scale and outrageousness of the Sands Sky park complex makes it a must-visit attraction. The trip to the top does not come cheap, but the view makes it worth while - bring a camera. Afterwards, we took a boat trip up the river to Clarke Quay which was a great way of seeing the City."
,,MBS,5.0,,"Marina bay sands is a place in between the sea n river which leads to merlion boat quay , Clark quay. The three towers have a board walk to reach and also can be reached by road or local train called mrt. It is a pleasure to stay in there which is of course very costly but worth it. We stayed in a suite which costed usd 375 per day. It is a clean 5 star status place. One has to go to the deck to view the surroundings which will cost only sgd 23 per person. The view from the top is spectacular in the dawn n night. The laser light show is spectacular too. The boat ride is a must"
,,Stick to the drink!,4.0,,A great view; we didn't pay for the Skypark and just went to the very busy bar. I don't think we missed out by sticking to the bar - we were able to see virtually everywhere from it. Like everywhere in Singapore the drink wasn't cheap! Particularly good view of the Gardens By The Bay.
,,Probably the best View in Singapore.,5.0,,"The view from the Skypark is awesome. You can see the harbour, Bay, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, the river and over all the suburbs. I think the price may be a little steep but is in line with other places like this around the world. I must confess my access was free because I was a hotel guest. You can purchase food and drink on the top as well. Try to pick a day when it is not raining as there is not a lot of cover on the top."
,,Perfect place to spend an evening,5.0,,"This place is just perfect to sit back and relax with a drink or two . The view from this place is incredible ,you have to be here to experience it."
,,Wow those views!!!,5.0,,"A gorgeous spot with grand scale views, grab a drink and just soak up the atmosphere. Great on a clear day and better at night with all the sparkling lights over Singapore and water. Just beautiful."
,,Good view but expensive,3.0,,This is one of these other must dos when in Singapore however it is expensive for what it is. Good views however as we'd just been on the Singapore Flyer it wasn't anything that spectacular.
,,Oh what a view,5.0,,Truly memorable views. Time your visit to get daylight views and then watch the sun go down before the laser light show starts
,,good views...,4.0,,You have to buy a ticket of varying prices which are redeamable against anything on the top floor ( not cheap! )
,,Impressive view of the Singapore sky line.,5.0,,"The sky walk allowed me to see Singapore from a different perspective. I was glad we were there around 10 am before the weather got warmer. The walk was pleasant and with few people, there was a sense of serenity and calmness. Highly recommended."
,,Great views of singapore skyline,5.0,,"If you wish to get nice views of the Singapore skyline this is it. Ample space, nice breeze, fantastic views."
,,Amazing view and observation deck.,5.0,,"This gives you such an unreal view of Singapore and the surrounding countries. Great view, sit up there and have a drink and meal and just enjoy it all. ASlways something new to see and do up there."
,,Short visit,1.0,,Our family stayed for a day at Marina Bay Sands hotel and we enjoyed there skypark very nice my family loved it.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Possibly the most amazing place to drink and relax. Watching the sunset from the rooftop bar is magical!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This is a must see place I stayed at the hotel and swam in the pool, it is an incredibly photo worthy place and I would highly recommend!"
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Pretty place with an amazing view.Plenty of pretty flowers and gardens to walk through.Its just a little humid so it’s better to visit this place around sunset.
,,Roof top bar a must,5.0,,"The roof top bar at Sands may not be the highest, but it has a stunning view of the Singapore skyline. A must see when in town!"
,,Impressive Architectural Structure,4.0,,"Incredible views of Singapore from high atop 56 stories can only be summed up as WOW! The current price for the elevator ride to the top is 23 SGD.

The swimming pool is only available to hotel guests but the observation deck and bar are open to everyone."
,,Unbelievable view of the city,5.0,,"We felt like we needed to visit marina sands as part of our Singapore trip. They charge $20 USD to visit the sky deck and the same to go to the bar/restaurant on the same area. BUT if you go to the restaurant they give you $20 USD credit towards your food and drinks, so it seemed smarter to do that. No big shock that the bar/restaurant is super expensive but the $20 credit will get you a drink so it was definitely worth it. Just be smart and only get a drink or two because the $20 USD drinks and $30-$40 food adds up FAST. Either way The view is nothing less than amazing and totally worth the money you spend to get up there. It was definitely a highlight of our trip. The pool looked awesome but it’s only for hotel guest and looks pretty strictly enforced."
,,Interesting,3.0,,This is quite the complex 3 Large towers tied together at the top.. Great concept but 23 bucks to go to the roof is pretty pricey and the food aint cheap Is it worth it....only you can make that decision
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Skypark is definitely worth a visit as it has some of the best views in Singapore. On a clear day you can see Malaysia and Indonesia, do not recommend this on a windy day as it gets very windy up there.
The entry fee is about 20 SD but you can use this money to purchase drinks in the bar."
,,The View!,4.0,,"Obviously, if you are in the area and want to see the Singapore skyline, what better place is there to witness the beauty? That said, it can get quite crowded and there were a lot of folks that decided to set up camp at the railing and were actually sitting down in large numbers making it difficult for others to enjoy the view. Once you do find a spot, you will enjoy some of the most spectacular skylines in the world."
,,Nice place but too expensive,3.0,,"The view for the Skypark is breathtaking, however the price is too high, as you get a small area to walk and view. The nearby bars and restaurants offer the same view and in this price you get a drink and good music"
,,What a view!!,5.0,,What a lovely way to see Singapore. A stunning building that lets you go all the way to the top. The deck is over-hanging the building such a long way. A real must if you are in Singapore.
,,Got to go here if you have time,4.0,,"It's a once of tourist experience - will you be swept off your feet, nah, but you will be glad you can say ""I've been there!"""
,,"Don´t bother, just go to the bar",3.0,,"If you limit yourself to the SGD 20 for access to the C´est la vie bar, redeemable for drink and food purchases, you will pay a lot less and the view is exactly the same.

Concerning the bar, I found it odd that they asked for a credit card to open a tab, taking into account that I was sitting right next to the bar and it´s not like I can escape from a 57th floor in a hurry not to pay for a drink. Quite frankly, for someone who has never left without paying a bill in my 60+ years, I found this attitude quite insulting and it doesn´t happen at other Sands resorts. If you add that I had a VERY long wait to get my beer, all in all I didn´t enjoy the experience at all.

Having said this, if you are in Singapore you sort of have to climb up to this hotel top."
,,Europe Trip Stopover,5.0,,Great views from atop the Marina Bay Sands. We spent about half an hour on the deck taking photos and enjoying the view before going into the bar area for a couple of cocktails to celebrate the last night of our month long journey. Just beware that once you enter the bar area you are not allowed back onto the viewing platform.
,,wow place to go,5.0,,take sky park ride and go to top floor you can see entire singapore not only that you can have nice drink and food on top.its bit expensive but worth to have.all can enjoy kids or adult.
,,Now I know why,5.0,,"Had the chance to stay at MBS a couple of weekends ago and fulfill my daughter's wish. We have been driving past MBS and she has been asking to go for a staycation there. Staying at the hotel in MBS provides access to both the rooftop Infinity Pool and Skypark. MBS has been around for a while now in our beautiful garden city but the hype has never died off. Now I know why. Just this rooftop Skypark alone is worth the visit. Firstly access is well controlled and secured. Making this a privilege experience (only hotel or paying guests can get in). Once you step into the Skypark past the gantry, the first view that welcome you takes your breath away. As you go down the staircase, you can't help but to fish out your camera or mobile phone and start taking picture after picture. On the day we were there, weather was good, the sun and the breeze, makes you think if only you can get a deck chair and lay there to enjoy the breathtaking view (you can technically but it's at the Infinity Pool instead). You will get a close to 270 degree view of our island landscape. The Marina Bay CBD, Gardens By The Bay, stretches all the way to our Sports Hub and Sentosa. Definitely a MUST TRY at least once in a lifetime. My girl is already asking to go back again next year. Not difficult to understand why."
,,Family weekend outing,3.0,,"Nice to be up there with family and friends. If the weather is not hazy you can see clear view of Singapore and The southern island.
The $25 fee to be up there is a little high in my opinion. Good to be up in the morning or late afternoon. At night is as good during festive season."
,,Unique building,5.0,,You will be amazed at the construction of this building. It looks like 3 towers with a ocean liner parked over the top. It is visible from almost anywhere in the city. Amazing site.
,,What a view! What a place!,4.0,,"We are suckers for observation decks so we had to try. We visited on November 30th during the day. We paid US$34 for 2 people. The view from the 56th floor deck is truly amazing. Unlike other observation decks, this one does not have a place to seat and hang out at or shade, so the visit was on the short side. The building is crazy!"
,,Twilight beauty,4.0,,Unbelievable view.. magnificent CBD ! Buy ticket in China town and save money if you come as group ! Beware when visiting during the hot day - No seats or shade !!! I prefer visiting at twilight and walk around water front.
,,what,5.0,,"a place!! tremendous and breath taking view. A must place to visit, that will give you the opportunity to appreciate the human brain and efort"
,,Spectacular Nightime Views,5.0,,Not to be missed although access is limited to one or two of the roof top bars and can be very crowded.
,,Great view that costs a lot,3.0,,"Fantastic building, walking along the board walk looking over the marina and bum boats in the water. However to go up to the top even with our discount after showing our Singapore Airlines boarding passes it still cost over $60. We then take a lift ride up to the top. Get a photo taken that costs $30 step outside ro a stunning view. However no seats up there to sit back and relax. No shade, the sun is hot and burns easily. Cant spend a lot of time up there. I wouldnt do it again"
,,Amazeballs,5.0,,"The views are breathtaking both at night and during the day. Definately pictureworthy. Enjoy the pool, the Spago Bar & the Jaccuzi"
,,What a place,5.0,,"This is a magnificent architectural structure. My only issue is the $23 charge to get to the observation deck. So we are going to spend this money on drinks and dinner at a restaurant with a similar view. Beautiful views of Singapore during the day, dusk and at night. Also there is High high end shopping and a Casino."
,,Awesome,5.0,,You can.pay for access up to the top you dont need to ne staying there and it's well worth it the views are amazing ...you can also for $20 go into the bar with the ticket price being taken off your drink another worth it ticket
,,Amazing view,5.0,,So we went here to check out the Singapore skyline and we were awestruck. Entire city is visible from the top . We managed to watch the laser show at marina from the skypark and it was lovely.do experience it to appreciate.
,,great!!!,5.0,,we stayed for 3 nights in december. the rooftop infinity pool is a must. great views and excellent poolside service. the rooms and bathrooms are great. we took the breakfast option and were not dissappointed there either. Great location. within 5 minute walking distance of marina promenade and the Supertee Grove/Garden Domes. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
,,A Must!,5.0,,"I really do not like heights but as this is one of the most famous buildings in Singapore I agreed to go up and I was not disappointed. You can see the entire city and there are helpful plaques so that you can identify what you are looking at and learn a bit more about the city. We went up during the day and I would have loved to go back at night but as this was only a short stay we sadly didn't have the time.
The only downside is that we decided to have a drink in the bar on the deck, we took out seats and waited, someone brought us drinks menus, someone else wiped down our table and then we were ignored for 20 minutes until we decided to leave."
,,Amazing view at night,5.0,,I have lucky enough to have previously been to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark last year during the daytime. It was beautiful to see the view of Singapore. This year I went at night and the view was amazing. So clear and all the photos turned out gorgeous with the city lights in the background. Time it right and you will also see the lightshow. I highly recommend going in the evening.
,,Brilliant Views Over the Bays...,5.0,,"Well worth a visit to Marina Bay Sands, we got there via the MRT and it brings you out in the hotel itself. There's some great views across the Bay and the city. We booked it via the web beforehand and it was easy to get in and out."
,,Restricted access,3.0,,"A must do as the hotel is a major landmark however the lift takes you to the viewing platform but restricted access to anything really.
Small kiosk selling a selection of snacks but no access to the bar for a Singapore sling or the like.
Good but no banana I’m afraid"
,,Views are breathtaking,5.0,,"What a fabulous hotel with so much to offer, as long as you are smart casual dressed you can get a drink at the bar at the skypark over looking the infinity pool for 20 Singapore dollars, you can't use the pool. However you can pay 5 Singapore dollars to go up to the platform and see the views over Singapore day or night it's spectacular. There is a gift shop and you can buy refreshments and hot dogs and pop corn and it's fairly good prices, it's clean and worth the visit"
,,Great Views of the City,5.0,,On top of this very unique hotel is a viewing station to see the beautiful city skyline and the Gardens by the Bay.
,,Awesome,5.0,,This structure is awesome you look in amazement the life needs to have its aircon on as we were squeezed like sardines
,,Really good place,5.0,,The place offers a good view of Singapore and of course the Gardens by the Bay. The view from the swimming pool is amazing.
,,increible experience,5.0,,"architecture design is outstanding, you can learn how to integrate buildings and nature efectively, I got speechless of beauty fancy place"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Having watched the construction of this amazing building I had to go, and wasn't disappointed!. The cost is very reasonable, the queues are nothing to be concerned about, the lift ride to the top is quick and comfortable and the view is absolutely amazing! I am not a great fan of heights and looking directly down does give a funny feeling in the pit of your stomach but looking out across the panoramic view was breath taking, day or night. You can see right across the bay at the thousands of ships, across the Gardens by the bay, the whole of the city and you could probably see Malaysia on a totally clear day. We watched the F1 Grand Prix form the top, excellent view, and no extra charge! We went up in daylight to enjoy the view and stayed to see the race and the amazing city at night. You cannot go to Singapore and not experience this phenomenon."
,,amazing view of Singapore from 56th floor (boat shape structure) of MBS....!!!!,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands (MBS) is the most well known hotel of Singapore. the top floor of the hotel is developed as sky park to have a view of singapore city. i visited this place in november and weather was pretty good that time not much hot or cold. the ticket price is 23 SGD per person and then take a lift for 56th floor. there you enjoy a little shopping (overpriced apprx. 2 to 3 times than normal market price) and snacks also. there is one sky bar also which is further chargeable. sky pool is also there but entry is for hotel guests only. for hotel guests (staying in MBS) entry to sky park, sky pool and sky bar are free. there is no bag checking at any point... you can carry your own snacks also :). you can spend about an hour or so in sky park only."
,,Time it right for an excellent experience,5.0,,"I went here to see the views of Singapore on the 56th floor at night time. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you get a good discount if you flew with Singapore Airlines. I paid less than $20 for the ticket, but make sure you have your boarding pass. If the attendant forgets to offer you this, just ask them about it.

At the top, you, if you time it right, you get the see the light show on the one side where the Super Trees are and on the other side you can see the water and laser show. It’s a wonderful experience, made especially memorable with the lightning in the distant background. I recommend you go. You will get to take some wonderful photos. There is also drinks, a souvenir shop and a restaurant up there."
,,Must do!,5.0,,Great view! We went as part of a tour- there were no lines to wait for the elevator either! Well worth it! Better view than the Flyer!
,,What a view!!!!!!!,5.0,,"I thought I'd be nervous to stand on the pointy end of this huge building, but the views from up there are so astounding, I wasn't worried at all. I recommend getting there just before dusk to catch the daytime views and then all the lights as they come on over the Bay and the beautiful city.There is a kiosk on the viewing deck selling drinks, ice creams and snacks for normal prices."
,,A Specific Experience of the View,5.0,,It is worth one visit and you definitely should do it .. We were there during the evening time .. The view was perfect .. Oh and you have to pay for entry .. It takes less than a minute to reach the top .. On the top you can eat at the restaurants but the view of the city and the sea is the main attraction .. JUST BEAUTIFUL .. worth a visit .. for the Infinity Pool you have to be the guest of the hotel
,,Eye opener,4.0,,Have seen how this building was constructed on TV and it one of best examples of design in the world. Views from the observation deck are just fabulous.
,,Wow! The night view,5.0,,"Truly spectacular! Went at dusk and was blown away by the view to the bay and also towards the ocean- to see downtown and the gardens by the bay at night- wow! You can watch the evening light show on the bay as well from the view point, enjoy a drink or dinner on top- wow! Worth every penny and $25 to go to top"
,,Amazing,5.0,,We watched this being built on a television show so was very interested in seeing it. Unfortunately unless you are staying at the hotel you can’t get to the top floor where the restaurant and Infinity pool are.( apparently guess complained as it got too busy). But you can get to the floor below which you can walk around. The lift up is very fast but you can’t feel it move at all. Once you have had enough of the view you can go downstairs and walk through the high end shopping malls. It is beautiful done. The six billion it cost has been recouped by the American casino company that owns it in 3years so we didn’t bother going there to give them more money. It’s well worth a visit.
,,Need a head for heights,5.0,,"Have seen pictures of the Infinity pool, most disappointed that this was for guests of the Hotel only. We were allowed to an area that had great views over Singapore and the race track below used earlier for the Grand Prix."
,,Best hotel,5.0,,This has become iconic mark of Singapore with big swimming pool on roof top -connecting 3 towers. One of the most famous sight and one can also reach gardens by bay from here
,,Amazing,5.0,,"If you want to see a 360degree view of Singapore this is the place to see it. Absolutely gorgeous at night, you could even see the light show in the gardens below."
,,Fantastic view,3.0,,"But that’s about it. Go up to the cafe/bar and have a drink instead, as there is no charge except for the prices of the food/drink. The view is well worth the trip up however you do it."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"It's stunning to see the city from the rooftop. Drinks are pretty good. So many people there as it's one of the great landmarks in Singapore.

We also had a chance to enjoy the show The Sound Of Music at the Marina Bay Sands. Amazing!!!
Beautiful voices of all artists made the performance unforgettable.

Also, this place has huge choices for shopping with famous brands.
Restaurants are great, too. I really enjoyed local food (Mee Goreng) in a self-service restaurant. Spicy and delicious!"
,,Panoramic Views At the Top,4.0,,"The SkyPark provides panoramic views of Singapore’s financial district. Plan your visit on a clear day. There’s a bar, restaurant and infinity pool at the top. The pool is available only to hotel guests. Spend as much time as you want. Lots of photo ops while up there. It’s an engineering wonder."
,,A good view.,4.0,,"A very nice view of Singapore. Almost 360 degrees view. Price is very affordable, 23 Singapore $, and easy entrance."
,,First visit,5.0,,"Awesome view and has to be done. Disappointed that their is the views are so limited. Charge of €20 per person a bit of a ripoff though when after all it’s only a view!! Would recommend the Stanford Swissotel, higher, free, and better views."
,,Stunning light show,5.0,,Marina Bay to have a lot reasons to go to. You can spend time for shopping or just relax and enjoy the Bay view. Absolute Highlight is the laser show which takes place two times every evening in front of the bay
,,Fabulous views,4.0,,"The building at Marina Bay Sands consists of three tall modern towers and on top of the towers there is a ""boat"". Our plan was to go to the top to admire the view. It turned out that the Sky Bar was in Tower 3 and there was a long queue of people waiting to buy tickets to go up to the top.

With tickets in hand, we caught the lift to level 57. Our red tickets qualified us for entry to the bar on the deck overlooking the city. If we'd gone for the cheaper white tickets we would have been able to go onto the outer observation desk to get a better view.

Wine in the bar area was pretty pricey. We paid $27 for each glass of a McLaren Vale red wine. However we got a $20 credit on each glass for our red tickets. What they often don't tell you as that they then add on tax and a service charge.

As we sipped on our wine, the sun set gradually over the tall city buildings lighting up the clouds with an attractive pink glow. It wasn't easy to take photos because the bar area was so crowded."
,,Convention Standard,4.0,,"International convention, decent food, good A/V, large format. Proximity to shopping and accessibility to transit ok."
,,Fabulous,4.0,,You must visit the C`est La Vie Bar on the 57th floor for fantastic views of Singapore at night even if you only have one drink as it is very expensive. The views will blow you away.
,,Spectacular place; spectacular view at Skypark,5.0,,"Visiting Skypark as a paid guest some years ago, I must say l appreciate its design, and its wisdom in place making.

As a business traveler staying at the hotel this time, I do not have time to enjoy using all the facilities of the resort hotel, but I end up finding myself enjoying the spectacular place at the Skypark. And I see its changing faces day and night with its spectacular view, seeing the city in panorama.

It is like a Street, but placed at the rooftop. Here you can eat, swim, shop, stroll, sit, chat and mingle. It ties the three towers of the hotel and one can traverse to the Spa, Restaurants, with easy access from the room, see the changing skies and weather, enjoy the breeze and showers.

It gives the busy business travelers a breathing space, beyond the normal expectations and experience, up in the air!"
,,"Beautiful view, expensive photos",2.0,,"When you enter, a staff member took two photos if you before taking the lift up to the sky deck. When we got to the top there is a stand where you can view your pics and if you like them you have the option of purchasing them. The staff there presented them 8n a nice folder and we were shocked when he told us it will be $60.00 Singapore dollars (which for Aussie the exchange rate at the moment is almost 1:1)... When we said no thanks he said the pics only will be $30.00 ... We still think it was too much for 2 doctored photos and walked away, feeling slightly miffed at the inflated tourist prices.

The view was breathtaking. Please note that the viewing platform is not covered and if it rains, there is very minimal shelter for visitors on the deck itself. We got rained on but watched spectacular lightning storm cowering in a all corner of the souvenir stand.

You might see stairs that lead to a bar... However the bar and infinity pool(7th floor) is only available to hotel guests.

All in all, I still think Sydney tower has better views and better value for Money."
,,Amazing views,3.0,,"This attraction has a great view of most of Singapore. A sunny day helps. Limited things to do apart from view. No seating anywhere. Amazing panoramic views though. You cannot access the infinity pool unless you are a hotel guest.

It is 56 floors up and really worth a trip. May only need 30
Minutes at the top though. $23 a little pricy??"
,,Stunning views!,4.0,,Has to be seen to be believed! From the 57th floor you look out over the ocean and the city. Try to go Before sunset and enjoy before and after scenes of Singapore!
,,Something different,3.0,,This place offers a great view of Singapore but there was really nothing to do besides take a picture. I think the admission fee could be cheaper with this in mind.
,,It really is a park in the sky,5.0,,My wife and I were given free access to the Skypark as part of our stay at MBS. We were lucky it was a sunny day with blue sky and able to see unblocked scenery of Singapore from the height. We came again in the evening to enjoy the night view and it was even more breathtaking.
,,A great vantage point for photographers at night,5.0,,Although it is busy at night the Skypark provides a great platform for photographers to shoot some amazing views over the city.
,,Best view of the city,5.0,,"We came here as we stayed at the amazing hotel for one night. Can definitely say this offers the best 360 views all over Singapore - perfect views over the gardens by the bay, marina and the city. Never crowded and plenty of space to take it all in - just bring suncream and a hat and its very hot up here too without a breeze!"
,,Night tour at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"We booked a night tour which included going up the Sky Deck of the Marina Bay Sands. The sight of the city from the 56th floor is just beautiful! The lift going up was quick, you hardly feel the ride and before you know it, you’ve arrived at the Sky Deck. It’s worth going up at night as you see the city lights and it’s just wonderful. The hotel itself is beautiful. Huge inside with lots of shops. You will need serious money though if planning to shop there. Overall, a place not to be missed."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,This place is damn amazing with a swimming pool on the roof top and an amazing place for leisure and fun activity
,,Nice view,4.0,,Definitively a place to visit. A fairly-priced restaurant also up there. And the view is spendid. We visited free as we stayed at the hotel.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,It is a wide garden with a lot of plants. I and my kids enjoyed it though we had to walk a lot. Feels so Asia and tropical. Dont forget to bring food and drink. Because cafe is only available in some spots
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit to the Lounge area at the top of Tower 3 of the fabulous Marina Bay Sands Sky Park which dominates the Singapore skyline.

Cost is $20 per person which comes off the price of your drink but make sure you view from the less crowded Lounge area which is next to the hotel guests only infinity swimming pool. The views over the Bay are spectacular.

Find the viewing area that looks back onto the Supertree Grove which has its own sound & light show each night."
,,A must,5.0,,"Amazing building, huge ... the center on the marina with everything turning around . The view from the deck is a very unique view of Singapore . Actually I prefer the view from around but it is certainly part of a touristic visit circuit"
,,Sunset views over all of Singapore,4.0,,"Arrived 45 minutes before sunset along with everybody else. Want to packed at the top, you could walk around quite easily. It is the best time to see everything, then all the lights come on for a great view at night. There is a bar you can go for a drink but you may have to book. Not really sure. 56 floors up with glass barriers is a little daunting for someone who is not fond of heights but definitely well worth a visit when in Singapore"
,,A must thing to do,5.0,,"We stayed at the hotel so we had access to the pool, which is an experience in itself. Defiantly a must to in Singapore!"
,,Awesome Views,5.0,,Currently the highest point to view the skyline of Singapore city. We went in the evening on a weekday so it was not so crowded. Better avoid weekends and public holidays for all Singapore attractions as we were told it can get ridiculously crowded. As most attractions in Singapore this place was also so neat and well maintained and the views were so great all around. We went in the evening and stayed till night and the shifting of colours are such a pleasant sight.
,,40 minutes to get fries !!,2.0,,"Ok so we came and spend around $400 dlls in drinks and they just take for ever ...! Of course they charge a mandatory service so is super bad, we order French fries and we had to go to ask to the bar what happened with the fries .. and they ignored us .. so in general it would be to go somewhere else to spend your money"
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"We went to the skypark at night , it has amazing views also has a restaurant ,I was told if you book into the restaurant you don't pay entry.The night we went was very busy but still had a chance for great photos.The light and music show on the water was absolutely amazing.This is a must do if you travel to Singapore."
,,Greatness oveload,5.0,,"It's my first time and am not disappointed. Singapore is in my bucket list. I had fun taking pictures in any angle with my supportive cousin and cousin in law. We had dinner just near the place (sorry i forgot the name) and i definitely love the food,my cousin ordered a thai food which includes a green mango salad that is new to me,hahaha..after the dinner we took a long walk going to the merlion and took a lot of pictures again. The color of the city really amazes me,the lights of the building makes me want to stay more than an hour. It's like a poster. Too bad the dancing fountain wasn't performing that time. If given a chance i would definitely visit marina bay sands again. I'd love to go back there."
,,Great views of Singapore by night,5.0,,"We decided to visit this famous viewing spot at night - as did large numbers of other people! It was extremely crowded and queue management seemed pretty much non-existent. And buying tickets in advance doesn't get you by 95% of the line. So after a wait of over half an hour we were on top. Pleasingly one of the reasons for the long line to get up is that they limit the number of people on top to quite a small number so it didn't feel congested at all. And the views by night are certainly spectacular. We were there at 8.00 and could see the laser show down in the bay from on-high and we then went down to ground level to see the 9 o'clock show which worked out well. The whole Marina Bay sands (and the quite astonishing swimming pool, viewing platform etc on top) are an amazing piece of engineering. Definitely worth checking out while you are in Singapore."
,,sky line,4.0,,"This place is so wonderful! You can see Singapore's city skyline, panorama skyline! and you can see the sunset!"
,,Amazing,4.0,,We went here on a rainy day so went to the bar instead of viewing platform. Still an amazing view. And around same price but with a drink. An amazing building with so much to see
,,Great View,4.0,,The view was fantastic from the deck. Avoid the photo shoot which costs a fortune. It's too expensive and looks terribly un-natural.
,,What a view!!,4.0,,"You can see so much from here. We found it a little hard to find as we entered in at the wrong end of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, but it was worth it when you get to the top and the elevator doors open to the most beautiful view. Loved looking down on the Gardens by the Bay and the Cloud Forest. The only negative for me was the price....but, you I guess you have to pay to enjoy that view!!"
,,Spectacular view of Singapore worth a visit,5.0,,I did this trip to the top soon after the sky park was opened and very much enjoyed revisiting even though now it is a busy spot with many visitors. Would like to be a guest a take a swim in that pool!
,,Amazing views,4.0,,A great place to get good views all round Singapore. It isn’t cheap and the service took a while but overall a pleasant experience
,,Panoramic view,3.0,,The top of the marina bay sands complex gives you a panoramic view of the city. Nothing else to do as the other stuff is very expensive. You can visit the casino if you are into it.
,,Holidays,5.0,,Wow this was amazing up 56 floors get your pic taken then out onto gardens restaurants eateries souvenirs just amazing the Veiws look all around Singapore this is well worth seeing
,,Must See,4.0,,It has assuredly the best overview of Singapore. It should be high on every visitors list of things to do.
,,Great view,5.0,,Unfortunately it was quiet a cloudy day I went there - but still you had a fantastic view there. And the bar is also great and has nice drinks ( a little bit expensive ) .
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,Well worth the entrance fee 23 Sing Dollars...incredible views of the City but beware you do need a head for heights !
,,best at night,5.0,,visited the Sky park as part of our saty at Singapore and was best to visit at night to appreciate the lights in and around the gardens by the bay.
,,"Great view, bar and food",5.0,,"I would do this at night in order to enjoy the view, the bars, food, dancing and all that nightlife can offer. If you are staying here, then you can also enjoy the pool."
,,Extravagance and surprise,4.0,,This amazing building set in Singapore opposite the world famous gardens is nothing short of spectacular. It offer a wide variety of iconic brands if you feel able to purchase these or for the more thrifty traveller it provides more comfortable options in an exciting building. There are surprises around every corner of this amazing piece of contempory realty.
,,Awesome building!,4.0,,"This is a very impressive building! The bars on the top have exceptional views. Food and drinks menu was quite good. The staff in the open air bar were not very friendly and you had to keep calling them to get service. However, the staff in the lounge bar were much better."
,,Love it,4.0,,Amazing view and super restaurants. Love the infinity pool and the view is stunning. Worth a visit if you're into skylines and touristy things. It's expensive but worth it.
,,Excellent view over Singapore,4.0,,"We visited the sky park as the hotel bar and viewing deck was closed for a private function-a point not made to us when we made a special journey earlier in the day to enquire about visiting that evening.
The views are spectacular if you have a clear evening and there is no limit to how long you can stay so we made the most of it and watched the harbour laser show from up there which was a definite plus
Think the entry fee is a bit too much as no facilities other than toilets.h"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We had unlimited access as guests staying at MBS. Really amazing views no matter what time of day! Never was crowded which is nice. We would have come here even if we had to pay.
,,woonderful,5.0,,Very nice to visit especially to see the town. Very nice swimming pool open only for hotel's guest. Nice
,,Expensive but worthy,4.0,,Seems a nice effort by the hotel to generate revenue by building an observation desk on its 57th floor. Wonderful view of the cities landmarks. Dont forget to have a cocktail from the adjoining restaurant.
,,Excellent View.. Totally Worth it,5.0,,"A must if you are going to Singapore for the 1st Time .. see the entire city of singapore form this Iconic Hotel.. Been there in the evening so the view was totally mesmerising, the ambience the vibes and one can have the glimpse of the famous marina bay sands infinity pool as well..Loved it.. Enjoy the Sunset from this beautiful place"
,,"Go early, enjoy the view!",4.0,,"I enjoyed seeing Singapore from the Skypark. I went as soon as it opened (9:30 I believe), so it wasn't busy and I had plenty of time to enjoy the sights. You can see the infinity pool looking along the edge of the building, but you can't get to it. The viewing area you can access is just the front of the boat. I didn't think that restricted by view enough to be an issue. It was starting to warm up by the time I left around 10:00, so I wouldn't go in the afternoon."
,,Wonderful place to visit,4.0,,Wonderful way to spend a relaxing evening at the top of Marina Bay Sands. It was advertised a 360 degree view but Visitors are restricted to only the extended portion on one side. I wanted to see the infinity pool but was not possible for non residents. I also wish the queue and lift facility was better managed.
,,Expectacular!,5.0,,"I was not in the hotel ospedado, but I went with some friends and my girlfriend to take something to the terrace of the 56th floor is a marvel to see Singapore sunset from the highest, the lights, the atmosphere of the terrace, the music, the Infinity pool (which is only for those who stay there).

The price is a bit expensive, but reward pay, then you can enjoy the mall that has the lower part of the same hotel. 100% recommendable"
,,Spectacular view of Singapore,5.0,,"We paid to take the elevator to the top...$20/person...which we then could use toward drinks or food. The food and drinks were excellent but pricey, but to be expected when you have that amazing setting and view. We had a warm but very clear day to take in Singapore and beyond! We had lunch which was great, but to be more thrifty, just drinks and the view would do it."
,,TOTALLY ICONIC!,5.0,,"Seen and known around the world as the ""building with the boat on TOP."" MBS, as it is now called, is iconic. It has become the symbol of Singapore. The views from the SkyPark are wide and amazing. Deserves to be on your bucket list!"
,,Don't miss it,5.0,,See my previous review. A whole bunch of wonderful things to see and do at marina park. This is part of an outstanding singapore experience!
,,"Hot, Crowded, and 2 minutes of your time",1.0,,"The whole process of getting up to the Skypark is a pain especially during the day when lots of folks are doing the same thing. You get up there and it's always crowded with sweaty tourists snapping random pictures. When you finally get a clear view, you enjoy it for about 5 seconds before realizing it's the same as any view from skyscrapper overlooking other skyscrappers. so if you're just came from a village with no tall buildings, this is definitely the place to checkout Singapore!"
,,What a view,5.0,,Impressive views unbelievable hotel building this was the no. 1 reason for coming to Singapore we loved it
,,Drinks in the roof cocktail bar,5.0,,We booked a table in the roof cocktail bar. Excellent views over singapore and the bar is very lively. However the music was a little too loud to talk so we had to shout - the cocktails were extremely expenses but delicious!!!
,,Wonderful view over the city and port.,5.0,,"Great views across the city and out to the port. And as a bonus you get to see the lobby of the hotel and the hotel guests looking at the visitors! Good value and much better than the wheel next door, which you look down on. Great photo opportunities of course."
,,Great view.,4.0,,"If you're afraid of heights like me, then don't go in here. But even though I'm shaking, I must admit, this is a nice view to look at and to take picture. You can see the gardens by the bay and the Singapore flyer in this view. You can take a picture of them together in just one shot."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,The skypark has the most amazing views of Singapore! There were plenty of people around but it definitely wasn't nearly as busy as I expected it to be!
,,Awesome,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore. ticket S$23 for an adult. We are really enjoy the view. Worth to visit. It is better to spend time at night so we can see night view.
,,Beautiful View,5.0,,A beautiful and spectacular view of this little RED DOT Best view around sunset to capture the surrounding
,,Stunning,5.0,,"To just stand and look up at this marvel is stunning. To see close up, you find yourself open mouthed. There was an electrical storm overhead so I didn't venture up ;)"
,,"If, like me, you're a sucker for grand, sweeping views...",4.0,,"... then this is the place to go. It's not that expensive, either. If you know where to find the information locally, try to go at a time when it's not overcrowded; the numbers of people on the observation deck is the only possible drawback to an otherwise memorable and affordable experience."
,,Up High,3.0,,"Bay view are not worth to linger around . Probably worth it for tourist but not local . However, it was very nice experience to spend sometime with your love ones."
,,Nice view,4.0,,You have an amazing view over the bay. It is not possible to access the pool though. nice to see and I would recommend it!
,,Awesome!,5.0,,I like this place.so nice and clean.really worth it too visit this place. The view is really awesome!
,,Splendid views of Singapore,4.0,,If you want to capture Beautiful arial views of Singapore then this is the right place for you. Dont expect to get a clear view of of the Swimming pool at the top. You can just sneak a peek. Cant get to that area. It is reserved for hotel guests only.
,,Nice for drinks,5.0,,"As one of the tallest buildings in the city the views here are the finest in Singapore.
The restaurant is rather high end price wise but as I did not eat am unable to comment on the food quality.
Drinks though are reasonable by Singapore standards. There is an outside walkway so you can see the city from all angles"
,,Great view,5.0,,"Really a very well maintained building, amazing lighting work, location is also great, so many things in one place....."
,,Worth it,4.0,,"Great views from top of the most famous hotel in Singapore, but you can't access to pool, it's only for hotel guets, if you want a higher building try the bar 1-altitude, stunning view up there."
,,a Great view of Singapore,5.0,,We take a tour to the Skyview of Marina Bay and it was really fantastic. The swimming pool on the top roof is really amazing. It's a great view to take pictures from the top and the best moment was at the sunset enjoying the city lights.
,,Good but expensive,5.0,,"Amazing view from above, i encourage you to drop there to see it, but its a way too expensive to pay 25S$ just for entrance with nothing included, even a drink"
,,Awesome,5.0,,A must visit when in Singapore - a different experience specially during sunset and the twist you will forever cherish when lights begin to light the city
,,Can’t be over rated. Best skypark.,5.0,,This is the best sky park I have ever been. Very nice view from the top of this sky park. The infinity pool is not to be missed! Was a little too crowded though. Wish there was less crowd there. Didn’t feel like getting out of the pool.
,,Excellent night,5.0,,"Views are amazing, there is a great buzz up there - we got caught out with a monsoon which was actually kinda cool."
,,If in Singapore a must,5.0,,When you are there I think you have to see it! The view is beautiful and a nice cocktail with good music and a lovely atmosphere. Try to go when it is sunset time!!
,,Not worth it,2.0,,"For the price you pay to go up to the too I wouldn't say it's worth it at all, you get to see the skyline of Singapore for sure but 25 dollars each seems a bit ridiculous."
,,Very disappointed,3.0,,"Having looked at this attraction and booking this on line, very disappointed when we arrived on the observation deck. You could only get a quarter of the way round as the swimming pool etc was for hotel residents only (which was fine), but for the cost of this was not impressed. We spent only a few minutes on the deck. Amazing view with what we could view from where we could access but there are only so many photos one can and want to take."
,,They could’ve made this way better for visitors,2.0,,"Any normal tourist would want the opportunity to visit the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There is a beautiful view of the Central Business District and Gardens by the Bay.

However, there is nothing up there other than decking and a coffee shop with no seats. I’ve visited tourist attractions as the top of buildings before (N Seoul Korea Tower, Empire State Building, Eiffel Tower and Rockefeller) all were way better designed for tourists and more comfortable for enjoying the insane view.

The staff at the ticket desk were also very slow, quite rude/abrupt and not very accommodating - unlike most of the other tourist attractions in Singapore!"
,,Unprecedented views across the bay!,5.0,,"A definite must visit, especially at night when the laser water display is scheduled.

It costs $20 a person to get to floor 57 if you are not staying in the hotel. The ticket entrance fee is then redeemable against drinks and food. Helps ease the cost a little. After all, for a glass of red wine and a large draught beer was $54.

We arrived just before 20:00, and the place was literally heaving! As we were not staying in the hotel, there were certain areas that were roped off that we could not go too, but that did not detract in anyway from the overall ambience of the night. I liken it to being in a fabulous nightclub high in the sky! The music was tasteful, and was simply superb. Fantastic to dance too with the most spectacular scenery!

Most definitely an experience to be had and an utterly incredible ambience. The scenery simply breathtaking!"
,,A bit of a ripoff,3.0,,"€25 to get the lift to the top
Just to take in the view no drink included
We wanted to have a drink but you need to be in smart dress ( that’s ok ) so do t wear shorts
A bit OTT FOR WITH THE PRICE €50 per couple"
,,So cool,5.0,,"I had wanted to get to the facility for as long as I've known about it. The architecture was immediately impressive. After arriving on the train, I was able to ask how I could most easily get too this party of the facility. I was directed near tower 3. It is well with the time. There views and experience is great. Worth the effort!"
,,What a mess!,1.0,,"An absolute disaster— horrible service, crowds, disorder. The response we got from the overwhelmed single ( but very rude) attendant says it all... “ i also want to go home”. What a mess... what a tourist trap in another wise beautiful building..."
,,Diwali visit,4.0,,"excellent surroundings, nice place to take a walk and enjoy the beauty. must visit this place after sunset. very colorful."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Not the easiest place to get to. We entered via shopping centre and a series of escalators. Very slick booking process with discounts for 65y+ and those who have flown with Singapore airlines. Fast elevator to 65th floor where there is an option to purchase photo taken on ground floor..quite expensive at 65 Singapore dollars. The views from the top are fantastic and there is a birds eye view of the coastal and city areas including the Formula One Grand Prix circuit around the Singapore flier. If you want to drink at the bar, you need to come back down one floor then up one floor by a sparer lift. There is a cafeteria which was closed due to unclement weather."
,,What a building,4.0,,"Excellent architecture as most of buildings in Singapore are.Great view from the top.
Beware of the roof top bar.When going up to 57 th floor,don't pay $20 for visiting the bar.
$20 will be taken off your bill,but there is nothing to drink for $20(don't forget 17% tax).
Viewing from floor below is free.Everything else is only for residents of the hotel.Bar is full and used as meeting place by expats.No seats available.Maybe lunch time,but not in the afternoon.Laser light show starts at 7.45.Splendid."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,Highly recommend go to have drink at Skypark. The view from the bar are breathtaking. A group of girlfriends went together have drinks when we visited Singapore. We enjoy drinks with great view.
,,Amazing building,5.0,,"Another ""Awsome"" but Singapore is full of fantastic sites. Buy a ticket and go to the 56th floor and enjoy the views at night from what is the bow of a boat sitting on the roof. You cannot access anywhere else however the other option is a drinks ticket where you get to sit in the bar on the roof but access to the rest of the area is still restricted. Watch the water and lights experience on the hour."
,,Singapore as a whole,3.0,,"Ita a great place to see singapore... its so beautiful and clean. Not polluted at all.
Here you will have the chance to see the city in a 360 degrees, from
gardens by the bay to the highrise buildings. In order to avoid queu, we went there by 10:00. It is already open by 9:30. But there are no queus and also small number visits the place thats why youll have a greater chance to take several instagrammable photos. I booked my ticket at klook.com which comes also with a free unlimited ride on a hop on/off bus."
,,Amazing platform,5.0,,"It was the second time this year (in my life) I visited this amazing spot. The view. The service and the food on top of this unique hotel is just fantastic.
For me a MUST if you are visiting Singapore.
I will come back soon!
Best regards
Daniel"
,,Marina Bay Skypark WOW!,5.0,,"Wow what a view. We went up to the bar at 5:30 so we could experience the day view and sunset plus night time. The bar was packed so make sure you get there by 5. We got the last seat. It cost $20 each to go up but they give you a voucher to use at the bar which gets taken off the $20pp you paid so essentially the price of one cocktail or a beer. The bar was very expensive but worth it for the view and experience a definite must. The view was slightly obstructed by the observation deck which runs parallel to the bar, you can’t do both at the same time they are seperate areas so you have to choose one or the other. The other option is to pay for observation deck which is $24pp but you can’t sit anywhere it’s a viewing platform only. We opted for a more relaxing atmosphere but if you want some good photos I would suggest the observation deck over the bareither way it’s a great a must do in Singapore."
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"We visited this place last month and it gives a beautiful view of the city from top.

Pros : must visit in the travel itenary and you can hang out there for long leisurely to take some stunning snaps if you get a clear sky.

Cons: the place has virtually no seating arrangement.. so it gets really tiresome tostand for more than 15-20 minutes. Especially if you are with young kids. There is a nice juice and souvenir shop at the top, but it also doesn't have seating."
,,Great views,5.0,,"The Skypark opens by 9.30 every morning. We were there at about 12.30 and it wasn’t very crowded. Entry is free to hotel guests. The skypark which is located on the 56th floor of the hotel has the most breathtaking view of the city. From the city views, the esplanade, the helix bridge, the merlion statue to the harbor, Singapore flyer and gardens by the bay on the other side, it’s a must go to place when you visit Singapore."
,,"Superb view of Singapore, can avoid the Singapore Flyer after this",5.0,,"You get a superb view of Singapore from here. If you visit the SkyPark, you can avoid the Singapore Flyer as from there also you will experience the same view. Added advantage is you can enjoy the lounge at the roof top and spend a great evening."
,,What a sight!,5.0,,View from top level amazing. Gorgeous building. Another amazing attraction. Singapore is a showcase of extraordinary design and futuristic attractions. Love everything about the country.
,,360 view around Singapore,5.0,,"Sensational 360 degrees views around Singapore. A word of warning though, there is no shade and it can get extremely hot during the daytime temperatures.So perhaps night visit might be a better option if you cannot bear the heat."
,,Worth the trip - just for the view,4.0,,"Whilst a bit of a tourist trap - this is a must do visit, especially at night time, when you get a stunnig view of the city. It tends to be very busy, with lots of people all fighting for a table by the balcony edge. But with a little perseverance and patience, you will eventually get some where to sit. The service, can be a little bit hit and miss - just very much depends on who you get and how hassled they are. There is a $20 dollar entrance fee, which you can redeem against a drink - best deal is to share a bottle of wine and take in the sights. Defiantley, you will get some great night time shots over downtown water front."
,,The man made structure that Singapore is now most identified with,4.0,,"Marina bay Sands is a humongous set of 3 towers with a boat shape like cantilevered park atop these three towers. The towers house Ultra luxury brands for shopping, amazing restaurants and a sky park for viewing the city and ocean scape and an amazing infinity pool. While it’s done brilliantly I think it looks a tad bit strange. You should consider staying a night here on during a holiday.
That said a visit is still possible in one of the following ways:
A. Visit the shopping area and the hotel
B. Buy a ticket to the 56th floor (one but top) for access to the sky park to view the city from atop. This gives a slightly similar perspective as the Singapore flyer.
C. Visit the Ce la Vie restaurent/bar on the 57th floor. The access charge is SGD 20 and redeemable against dining bill. (My preferred option). The idea of leisurely taking in the views over a good meal appeals more to me. There are two sides offering the city view and the ocean view. The food is nice. The avocado sushi that I had was one of the finest. A MUST MUST DO if you aren’t staying here."
,,"The view is OK, but the overall experience is pretty poor",3.0,,"There are two ways for non-residents of the Marina Bay Hotel to get to the top to see the view - the Skypark costs about $23 each, and is accessed from level B1 under tower 3. Good view, but nowhere to sit, a daggy shop and a queue to get down can be long. The better option is to pay the $20 to go up to the Ce La Vie rooftop bar which is one level higher than the Skypark. Pay at the counter at the northern end of tower 3, ground floor. The access ticket gets you $20 credit on a beer or cocktail. Be prepared to be herded and told where you can't go, and look over at everyone the infinity pool taking selfies (can't access the pool unless you are a resident of the hotel)"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"This is a must!! If you have ever seen this building on TV, it is even more stunning in real life! Easy to access, pretty good value for money. It was a grey day so not that busy, but as we only had an overnight stay in the city, we couldn't be too particular about the weather. The views from the Skypark are breath-taking, with a glimpse of the infinity pool at the other end of the Deck. There was also a reasonable gift shop up top, with a lovely man serving, who was ever so helpful and friendly."
,,One of the most favorite places for me,5.0,,"Definitely one of my favorite places on the world! I like the views, infinity pool, bar... everything... Literally, from the first second I fell in love in this place... You feel like you are ""at the top of the world"", when you are at Skypark... I go there every time i visit Singapore...

P.S. It is expensive up there... but there is a part where you can go for free, and you can just move around without ordering anything."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,This is a very nice place I really liked it Marina Bay itself is very beautiful this has to be beautiful than it
,,WHAT A MAN MADE BUILDING,5.0,,"What a sight at Marina Bay, The Sky Park. Beautiful in the night with lights. Its Huge Very tall and unbelievable.Can not believe it is man made. Must see place in Singapore Marina Bay"
,,too expensive,3.0,,"actually the view is very good, especially at night. however the cost is expensive. you won't state too long if you are not photo taker, but the view if Singapore at night is good."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,What a wonderful hotel! My two daughters and I went up to the Skypark where you could see for miles around with spectacular views. A must for any visitor to Singapore
,,do it once,4.0,,"we visited the skypark with some friends it was free to get up ,but the price of drinks made up for the elevator ride.The bar area is in the centre of the roof so you cant get too close to the edge this is reserved for paying guests of the hotel,it does give you a view of the city,the swimming pool area is also reserved for guests,glad I did it once wouldn't do it again"
,,Amazing Singspore,5.0,,How come I didn't visit Singspore till now? Wow Loved this place It's cleaness. Green view Amazing and polite citizen Take a look at this pics from the 59 floor and then from ground
,,The best city view,4.0,,"If you are in 57th floor then yes you are going to get an amazing view, just spending few minutes in the sky park is going to get the view of the entire country that you don't want to miss out"
,,Nothing to write home about,3.0,,"Spend a good amount of money - perhaps only for the view. We were told that there is going to be a light and laser show across the promenade over the river at exactly 9 pm. Lo and behold, the show started and it was similar to the Gardens by the Bay show - no theme, just some water jets shooting in the dark, with lights and lasers and some colours and that is it. In the end we were trying to make sense of what we just saw, but alas, no good - just something put together to look good but awfully themeless.
The view from this Skypark though is quite spectacular - the whole of Singapore, promenade the Flyer etc can be seen from this place.
Go to this place only if you are willing to spend money and time and perhaps have no expectation of getting floored. Otherwise definitely skippable activity. Oh yes, and if you are definitely looking to tick one box of the Singapore list then, yes attend it."
,,Sensational views,4.0,,"The views from here are 360 degrees around Singapore. A word of warning, there is no shade, so take a hat as it extremely hot during the day. However, the views and photo opportunities far outweigh the heat"
,,Unbelievable views,5.0,,"Magnificent views from up here, this is a great spot to have a beer or cocktail and see what Singapore has to offer.
Tip, don’t pay to go to the view deck. You can pay $40 per couple and go to the top bar at tower 3 which can be redeemed as credit when you buy drinks."
,,Observation Deck Must See & Billions of People,3.0,,"I’m glad I visited the observation deck — awesome views of Singapore. I was offended that they would not permit non-hotel guests to dine or have a drink at the restaurant on the observation deck — I was ready to spend S$300 to S$500 for a nice meal on myself. I was so disgusted that I went thirsty and refused to spend any money at the publicly open kiosk bar there!!!! It disgusted me so much that I will NOT stay at this hotel on my future return to Singapore.

But the S$27.50 fee I paid to get to the observation deck was worth the price.

This hotel is extremely busy with tons of window shoppers like me and bus loads of tourist guests from Mainland China. The checkin lines are long!!!

Great thing is the adjacent shopping center."
,,Expensive and they trick you,3.0,,"I took my Father in law and his wife to visit the top deck of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Before it used to be really nice: you went up the lift, walked into the area where you could buy a drink (albeit pricey but that's ok as you are paying for the view and the experience and it was nice), no fuss and no problem. Unfortunately, now they are making a big deal about going up. You are first herded into a line for the lift, a bunch of staff there are quite bossy and rude, and when you arrive above you are met by a real hard sell from a bunch of quite rude guys trying to sell you a photo. The photo is expensive SGD60 and it's not even in front its basically photoshopped. Also, $60 for a photo is just extortionate and they make you believe you have to buy it. Since I live in Singapore I knew you didn't but say how other people were being pressurized into buying it. A real shame! Anyway, the visit is still impressive, just sad to see how commercialised its all become."
,,Excellent views of Singapore,5.0,,"We visited at night and there were lots of queues but still really enjoyed it.

The ticket we bought did not go right to the top (where there are trees etc) so would have liked more information on how to get there, but our ticket took us to the 56th floor and a large viewing area all the way around the tower.

Very pretty at night, with lovely views of the gardens by the bay and the surrounding skyline."
,,Great just to experience the marina bay sands atmosphere,5.0,,"At Tower 3 level 57. Cost $20 but redeemable with drinks, food or merchandise. Here you can view the wonderful singapore city landscape and sunset. You can also see the famous eternity pool the is crowded with tourist and selfie sticks. Personally, not worth the high pricetag for 1 night.
The skybar is dear but this is due to the great view. Highly recommended"
,,Marina Bay Sands - day at the pool,5.0,,"We could not go to Singapore and miss the amazing Marina Bay pool. We booked one night there and spent the entire day at the pool. It was totally worth it! The views are amazing, you fill like staying on the top of the world. Nice pool, great Jacuzzi, lovely drinks, great service. The rooms are great- again, great views. Don't miss this attraction in Singapore!"
,,Great views,5.0,,On top of the world this building is a must visit when in singas just a fabulous view. Take the lift to the top sit relax and have a singapore sling you wont be disappointed
,,Stunning city views,5.0,,I'm not a fan of heights but I braved the 56 floors and it was absolutely worth it! Panoramic views..stunning!
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,The view on Singapore is amazing. You are on the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and can enjoy an amazing view on the City and the bay. Now they changed the rules. Before if you were at the restaurant or the bar you could get the entry to the observatory deck while now you need a separate ticket.
,,Disappointing experience,1.0,,"One single positive point: the view from the roof.
Staff are totally incompetent, we were twice charged for the cocktails and treated like second class people without intelligence.
They brought the meals which were different what we ordered.
Staff lied about the table position, seating requirements and bookings. staff were rude and completely unwilling to assist in our request.
Food portions are not enough to feed a child.
Their service is automatically charged in the bill as 10%, and it is not deserved.
The staff and the managers do not care about the tourists (especially the western tourists) as the tourists are not their permanent customers.
The night ended resorting to the room-service in our own hotel as we returned hungry.
The staff faked a lack of understanding of English to avoid responding to the customer requests.
We are not new to travelling as we are working in different regions all around the world. This by far is our worst dining experience for a very long time."
,,What a lovely structure,5.0,,"I did not go up in to this building but from observation, this building is one of a kind...really different from what I have seen in Europe and other places. This is really a stand out and beautiful building. Great photo opt."
,,Excellent view of Singapore Skyline and Marina Bay Area,5.0,,Located on the 56/57th Floor of Marina Bay Sands .It is a must visit for visitors as it offers a scenic of Singapore Skyline and Bay area .It has restaurant and night clubs located o the same floor and is a happening night spot.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"Came here for a drink with a friend on the roof-top bar. Amazing views of Singapore and some great drinks. Highly recommended, even if you don't have that much time. The view is definitely worth it!"
,,Awesome view of Singapore skyline from 56th floor,5.0,,"This is an observation deck in the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands, an upscale hotel in Singapore. A must visit in my opinion. You can also see the light and water show from above. The glittering skyline of Singapore is best viewed from here. You can also visit the infinity pool and restaurants on the 57th floor.

Avoid weekends as there is too much rush and the elevators are full. Also check the weather forecast before going as this is an open air deck - so if there's rain you'll get drenched."
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,"Best view of the city....the only downfalls were: 1 - Literally no shade at all, we didn't last long up there because of the harsh sun. 2 - Would be the perfect place for a nice bar. There was one up there but you had to go back downstairs and make a reservation to get in."
,,View of Light Show,4.0,,It is better to visit MBS late in the evening so that we can witness the light shows of gardens by bay and laser show. Though not the best of view but it is diffirent
,,Shopping mall with a conference center with a unique viewing platform on the top,4.0,,It is a nice place to spend one half day if you are in Singapore for leisure. The bar on the roof has splendid view but requires decent dress. Men with shorts were not allowed.
,,Unbeleivable,5.0,,"What a fantastic place you cant beleive theres a swimming pool on top of this hotel as well as a restaurant and bar. Staff were great happy to look after you. The lifeguards were great as well making sure no one was doing anything silly and keeping everyone safe.The views are stunning and cover both the city and the Ocean, excellent"
,,Great view,4.0,,I was a guest at the hotel & found the view from the Skypark breathtaking. Some maintenance is needed at spots as well as window cleaning.
,,breathtaking views,5.0,,We met up with a friend who is a resident of Singapore and were taken to a nightspot at the top which has stunning views right across Singapore. A once in a lifetime experience to be on top of a spaceship on top of a huge Hotel . Expensive but worth every penny
,,A surreal hotel experience,3.0,,"We stayed in The Marina Bay Sands Hotel for a total of three nights. We found the hotel more like a busy airport/train station. The pool was packed from early morning until late at night, it was really frustrating as even in the lane designated just for swimming there were hordes of people taking selfies. Our experience did not justify 5e cost of our stay. Would not recommend this hotel."
,,Wow,5.0,,It’s an amazing place. One should plan to stay once in a life here. Breathtaking view from sky park on 57th floor
,,Superb view of Singapore and excellent food,5.0,,"What else could I say: first, the view out of the 57 level is really superb. Second, the food really tasty. Only drawback is the queue at the entrance , but (hint!) if you call in advance and book, you don't need to stay in the queue.

Will come back for sure ."
,,Worth a visit..,5.0,,This is the highest view point for tourists in the city.. the view from the top is excellent.. the hotel itself is beautiful.. there is a laser show in the evening .. this is not to be viewed from the top but from the arena at the bottom of the building..
,,Marina bay,4.0,,"Good view but its too hot to visiting at this month. Nice place, nice sight seeing. Nice and comfort place to walk clean and well maintained"
,,Best 360 views of Singapore,5.0,,Definitely a must for first time visitors! Great way to get a birds-eye view of Singpore. Have a drink at the bar at sunset or book into the hotel for a night to use the wonderfully terrifying infinity pool for the complete experience!
,,Nice for a cocktail in the sky,4.0,,"We weren't staying at this hotel but visited to see the amazing view. Cost $20 to go up but then you get that back in drinks and food credit which I thought was fine.. Service was ok not super friendly like other parts of Singapore, cocktail was pleasant and then we took the obligatory selfie. Worth a visit"
,,nearly a rip off,3.0,,"the brutal reality, despite the hype and the alluring photos, is that you are constrained to one small section of the skypark, not allowed near the infinity pool, subject to hard sell from the souvenir photographers and charged a large amount of cash for what is quite a good view but no where near what you are lead to expect. Tower three is the cheap room tower, the check in is horrible and the skypark tourists are the lowest of the low, the lift is quick but the end result is very disappointing. What is worse is many of the hotel residents like to wander into the viewing area and flaunt thier status by wearing their bathrobes before heading back to the hotel only section past the guards who rigorously enforce the residents only rule. Overall its a good view but don;t expect the 360 view and walk around the whole roof area, it ain't going to happen!"
,,Fabulous view from the Skypark,5.0,,"Spent a happy evening in the Skypark. Stunning views, and a marvel of engineering. Wow! If you can get here it’s worth it!"
,,Good views but not worth the wait or the money,1.0,,"We purchased tickets to the Observatory at night. While the views were good, the wait times to leave the observatory deck were ridiculous. We probably spent more time queuing for the elevator than looking at the view. When we arrived, the queue to head back down was almost half way around the observatory. This dropped a bit by the time we headed back down, but it still took almost 40 minutes to make it to the elevator. There is also no ability to see the infinity pool from this area.
Note that you are also not allowed to set up a tripod, so forget about getting a stunning photograph at night. You can watch the Marina Bay Sands light show from this vantage point, but you cannot see all the images, so I think it is best viewed at ground level. In the interest of transparency, I think they should list the queue times (both to go up and down) at the ticket desk.
Not worth the money or the time."
,,Great Views of the Super Tree Grove and Port,3.0,,This Skypark offers amazing views of the city. It is a little expensive unless you used Singapore airlines. Then you get a discount or if you stay in the hotel its free. If you don't do any other place that offers views then this is worth it. It has signs that tell you what you are looking at. I would not wait more than 30 minutes for this. There are other places to see city views.
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,We strolled through this area today evening. The architecture is incredible inside and outside. I highly recommend going in the night to check out the lights.
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,Due to it's location this gives you the best views of Singapore from above. S$20 charge to get to top but drink included
,,Wish we had skipped it,2.0,,"As others have said you do get a good view of the city - but this was the disappointment of our visit to Singapore.

After $23 each we waited in line for 15 minutes to ride the lift up to the spartan observation deck. What caught our eye more than the view of the city was the long line of visitors wrapping along the railing waiting for the lift down. After we took in the view it was more than 30 minutes in the sun & heat waiting in the queue for our turn back down.

So many great places in Singapore to visit and thing to see. This wasn't one for us."
,,Must see location,4.0,,"It's well worth a visit as the views over Singapore are excellent. You have a clear view of the F1 circuit and possibly one of the most unusual football stadiums that I have ever seen.
The express lift whips you up to the 56th floor in seconds without you feeling and effect.
Gift shop and cafebar available at the top.
Definitely a must visit location whilst in Singapore."
,,You pay for the view,4.0,,"I would certainly recommend this once in a lifetime experience. And here are some hints.... this is located at Tower 3, access is awkward so use a cab to get in or access by foot from the garden side. And... you will pay for it. The $20 access fee can be applied to your bill and you will use it all for one beer. Should you choose to eat in Ce la Vi at the top, the food really is good."
,,Viewing Gallery was average seen better views,3.0,,Could skip the viewing gallery if you've visited the Singapore Flyer already. However the shopping center and restaurants are plenty.
,,Light shows everywhere!,5.0,,"Had a wonderful time, watching the lights at the Bay Gardens. Then changed sides and watched the harbour light show Both were brilliant. Don't rush. Get there 10-15 minutes early, to get the spot you want. Worth the $20 you pay!"
,,Best views of Singapkrw,4.0,,It is probably the best place to see Singapore from above. However the skypark can get crowded and it seems it gets less crowded after 9-10pm.
,,Great view over Singapore,4.0,,"You are only allowed on the front part (observation deck) but it was enough to get a real good view of most of the City.
Reasonably priced too but don't get suckered in to the photo before you get in to the lift!!
Would recommend to anyone even if it's just to say ''I've done it'!!"
,,Unique Modern Skyscraper,4.0,,"From a distant, the three skyscrapers look like carrying a boat on their roof top. The close-up is just an amazing structure that house in many modern entertainment facilities. A great sight for photography, especially take it from the Supertree."
,,Awesome View,5.0,,"Awesome view from top... better visit during evening... even restaurant is available at the top.... book online to get cheaper price... 15 minutes from city... it will cost 10 SGD in taxi... close to singapore flyer, casino, marina square."
,,Spectacular Views of Singapore,5.0,,We visited the observation deck that is on the top the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. WOW! What a view of Singapore! There is a small cafe and gift shop and a photographer to take your picture. Pictures were $69. A bit pricey for us.
,,"Over temperature, over priced, good views",3.0,,"We went here late morning which was a mistake. It was so hot up on the top and the café/restaurant was closed which was the only place with shade. Ended up spending less than 15 minutes up there due to the temperature. Got some good photos of the views but definitely not worth the cost at Singapore $ 23 each person.
Might be better at night when it would be cooler. Disappointed not to be able to get near the infinity pool (didn't expect to be able to have a swim but definitely felt like the poor relations with the limited access to facilities)"
,,Excellent Views,5.0,,"I was fortunate to go late in the afternoon. At the start of my time on the observation deck, the weather was sunny but it got progressively worse with a blustery torrential downpour. This was great though as it added to the experience as I got to see it in good weather, with low dark clouds looking, during the day and as dusk started to fall. I certainly don't regret paying the £20 entrance fee and enjoyed the views of the city from there."
,,Best views,5.0,,"We visited this after the gardens by the Bay, cross the path, go down the lift and walk to the right tower, this is the entrance. Amazing views over Singapore & can see the wholesome the gardens & part of the F1 track. Apparently if you go to the restaurant you can receive a free drink with your ticket, we didn’t know about this..
Well worth seeing the views from the top"
,,Awesome View,5.0,,"Marina Bay Towers are simply AWESOME!!! The Wife and I wasted no time in going there and getting to the top, to the Sky Park, the views are fantastic, Great park for couples or families, restaurants, pools and a park. From the top we picked out just about every thing and every place we want to see. tickets are not expensive, $23.00 SGD, well worth it."
,,Breathtaking view of coty,4.0,,"Visit around dusk around 6.30. There is no time limit on deck. You can catch laser show from TOP at 8pm. After sunset all the buildings around glow and gives nice water reflections. On one side you can view gardens by the Bay from top. Quick tip- queue to go down by lift grows very fast after laser show, wait time around 20 mins, know exit route and get in queue immediately."
,,Great,4.0,,This hotel is huge! Pay the extra for a club executive room. A bit annoying that people can pay to use the pool as it can be hard to get a spot and when you are paying the rates they charge it is disappointing.
,,Great views of Singapre,4.0,,I visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark in the evening which was very spectacular. When you walk around the Skypark you then realise that Singapore is very big and the lights of Singapore are sure worth the trip up to the Skypark. Another must for Singapore
,,Nice Bar,4.0,,"Nice atmosphere, good DJ, great drinks, friendly involvement, security was ok, very nice view, beautiful people."
,,Great view from the top,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Skypark is definitely worth a visit. The Skypark is situated 56 floors high above the hotel and gives a great view of the skyline of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore strait. The bars and restaurants are extremely expensive up there however, it is very nice to have a drink, lay back and enjoy the views as well as overlooking the hotels infinity pool. A family with children may find this attraction very costly but it is worth it to experience this fantastic building."
,,Nowhere to sit,3.0,,"Pretty much as you’d expect from a modern well-designed observation tower, although from inside the hotel it was surprisingly hard to find the entrance. It’s actually on the OUTSIDE of Tower 3 (that’s the one furthest away from Bayfront metro station).

Main comment I would make is that there is NO SEATING anywhere to be found. Obviously most of the deck area needs to be left clear for the hoards of people (albeit few were there when we visited c.2pm on a Friday afternoon) - and they don’t want the riff-raff sunbathing - but it would be nice if there were some benches along the inside wall so that the elderly, infirm or just plain tired could rest their weary legs a while, especially if it’s hot and they’ve already been wandering around the adjacent Gardens..."
,,The ultimate view,5.0,,"Don’t miss out a visit to this vibrant fantastic city without visiting the Marina Bay Sands the viewing area is a must, the views of the city are not to be missed"
,,Nice hotel,4.0,,"Nice hotel to visit Singapore from. Mrt just down stairs, clean an comfortable rooms. Rooms with park view have a nice balcony."
,,There is a reason,5.0,,I mentioned in my Marina Bay Sands hotel review that staying at this hotel is not cheap but the main reason anyone who would stay at this hotel is for the hotels skypark and infinity pool. Which in all honesty is a one time affair. But yes its really an amazing experience jus to be at the top and see the world below you while swimming in a truly amazing pool experience.
,,"Excellent view, poor bar",4.0,,"The view is obviously the reason why you should go there, and it is a definitely a must do even if you stay only 1 day. The bars at the top are packed and you should come early to have a chance to seat. The service is terrible and the prices are as high as the bar...."
,,Amazing view of the city,4.0,,"Skypark is a must visit attraction in Singapore. I highly recommend this. One would see almost 360° view of the city.

It's the platform on the roof with glass partitions on the sides. Usually a crowded place. Best time I would recommend to visit is Night time."
,,Day visit,5.0,,"A must-do activity in Singapore.
On top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, this skypark has views all across Singapore. It looks like a big ship on top of a 3 tower hotel.
It is moderately expensive (around S$23) but senior discount (+ Singapore airline discount) brings it down. However, even at S$23 is it not expensive for the views and 360 degree outlook.
The experience to just get there, access the elevator (up 56 floors) and surrounding Marina Bay Sands hotel environs is an adventure in itself. It is on the MRT - but we walked from the harbour area near Marina Bay."
,,Not worth $23,2.0,,"You do get a good view. I was very disappointed, as my idea was to sit on the observation deck and have a beer overlooking Singapore. It was very hot the day we went. There is no access for the general public to sit at the bar its only for hotel patrons to use. There is a little shop that sold souvenirs and cold drinks but there is no seating at all on the observation deck."
,,Evening Visit,4.0,,We went there in the evening and it was the right decision. The night views of the city and the Gardens were spectacular. A bit of a maze to find the entrance / ticket office to go to the top.
,,Average,3.0,,These places are very similar to each other go up a tall building and look around. The view is good there are many tall buildings around the area so definitely not the tallest. Staff where very nice. Price was a lot for what you got but every sky tower I've been to is a lot.
,,Awesome experience on top.,5.0,,"It was evening time and we enjoyed one hour time on top. View of city is breathtaking and great experience. One can have food over here. Vegetarian has limited options.
Only part one can miss is swimming pool. It is no more allowed for outsiders (other than hotel guests).
Do visit if you are at Singapore."
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,"This is really worth the entrance fee, $20 for seniors, you can only get to the 56th floor, but you can still have fantastic 360 degree views over Singapore. Some great photo shots."
,,Super,5.0,,"Nice view from the deck- we visited in a rainy day so its gave us more romantic feel in our visit, we booked with city tours, they send us an email, we have to redeem from one of their outlet in the hotel area.dont miss the view-"
,,Spent the day here so much to do,5.0,,"Singapore is shopping shopping shopping. Here we have all the top of the line stores. A inside River ride, food courts, Michelin star restaurants, and the casino. Of course the roof top view is a must do again at night is best."
,,skypark,4.0,,"great view from the top on the marina bay sands hotel but think how you want to do this you can pay 23 dollars for the deck or 20 dollars to go to the bar and use the 20 dollars towards a drink or something to eat, you can go to the deck and then the bar but you have to pay for drinks but you cant do it the other way round."
,,Bucket list item ticked,5.0,,Have wanted to visit for years and finally got there. Not that expensive and well worth it. Stunning views of Singapore. Went up about 4.30pm and watched the lights of Singapore as the night fell...great time to visit. Really enjoyed it.
,,Traveller Food.. What is available - you have to accept.. May be Rush?,3.0,,"NOTE:
Ensure that you are prepared IN ADVANCE or else, you will end up in few CAMERA FRAMES!

.. SKY WATCH!! SKY TOUCH..
.. Lift leaves pressure difference in your ears
.. Read & be prepared..
.. Quality of packed food was standard
.. With family, we really enjoyed ! Relaxed on the deck...
.. Cool breeze, Musical Fountain down, Light SKY Scrapers around... A SPECIAL EFFECT..
.. Food, by range and quantity - not acceptable!
.. Over all OK !
.. Singapore FLYER gives almost same shots."
,,Great view,4.0,,"View is simply amazing, better to go for marina bay sand viewing deck then going to singapore flyer."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,The next best thing to being in the pool. I've visited both the sky deck and been a guest using the pool. The view is the same minus the water and the illusion that you are falling off the edge. Word of warning: if you enter the restaurant you cannot reenter the deck.
,,Amazing view,3.0,,"It's a amazing view up there, real breathtaking, but the price is also. It's very crowded up there and it's only a certain part of the platform u can visit. So I am a bit torn, on one hand I would highly recommend the view on the other hand I would say it's far to expensive to do. So I leave it up to you to diced."
,,Sky high pool,4.0,,"We did not stay at this hotel but we heard so much about it we visited.There was no problem getting in .
Just ask the concierge .We wanted to see the roof swimming pool. I think this is on the 59th floor
Take an elevator to the 57 th floor and change to another to the top .
Although you are not allowed in the pool if you are not a resident the view is tremendously.
There is a restaurant there for lunch /dinner if you can afford it,."
,,An evening visit,5.0,,We it's filled with restaurants and the vibe is amazing. A must visit for any tourist who comes to Singapore. You can take a boat ride or walk along the promenade and enjoy the breath taking view.
,,On top of the world but with an amazing view!,5.0,,"We loved the Marina bay sands sky park. It was a little busy the day we went, but the line moved quickly. At the start you have a photo with the group you are with and at the top you can view this and purchase if you want. We didn't bother, the cost was s little too much for a simple photo.
You take the elevator to the top floor, wow... breathtaking. A beautiful view of the entirety of Singapore.
It was a hot day, so my children had a quick look and then rested in the shade and read a book while admiring the view.
There is a shop at the top to buy souvenirs and cold drinks. There is restaurants and bars at the top also.
Definitely worth the visit!"
,,Anniversary trip,2.0,,"Went to the top level Had a beer and a mock tail, they may not charge to get in but buoy do they make you pay once in the bar Service good View spectacular Return, only if I win the lottery"
,,See the city!,5.0,,You will reach 56th floor in an instance! Excellent view of the whole city. You will just love it at night! Guests staying at the hotel will get full pleasure as only they are entitled to enter the infinity pool.
,,Weird boat shaped ledge up three towers...,4.0,,It's a little expensive but worth a visit. You can get a lift up to the deck that you've been taking photos of from every angle all day. Great views of the city. A magnificent building.
,,Brillliant walk through luxury for a sunsetting evening,5.0,,"More you walk through close, more brilliance of architecture intertwined with natural surroundings. Horizon reflecting through the river and the cruise floatings"
,,Wonderful View and Nice Infinity Pool,4.0,,"There are other places to see Singapore skyline but this offers one of the best views, if not the best. A plus is experiencing the infinity pool, but one must stay at the hotel to have access to it. The lounge was also great, however we avoided having dinner at the restaurant as they required a minimum charge per person which was I found excessive."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"Great views, $25 for a ticket to go up, but worth it for the views. You can spend as long as you want."
,,"Cool to see, could be skipped",3.0,,"SGD$23 to ride in a lift. The view is cool, and there are some restaurants/bars at the top that could make it worth it (no need to pay the entry fee if you intend to dine or drink). You could also explore other things."
,,Sky park observation deck,5.0,,Deffo worth a vosot particularly ce la vi restaurant at top floor deck! Was quite expensive but worth it for views!
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Stay one night. Enjoy the the infinity pool up on skypark. Beautiful service from all the different service staff. At anytime we needed information there was always a service staff to help regardless the department they are in. Excellence in everything we experience.
,,Big Let Down,2.0,,Don’t waste your money or your time! Spent so much time in queues for tickets and lifts than on the platform which had limited access. Better spending this time and money elsewhere.
,,Amazing,4.0,,Amazing bay..the marina bay sand dominates all the bay..it’s very nice walking around it...good skyline ...and behind the marina bay there is a skytree whit a huge and beautiful park...walk down to the platform of marina barrage...the skyline view from there is amazing especially at the sunset...
,,Amazing View,5.0,,We went to a swimming pool and found it's a really nice view out there! Excellent atmosphere and good service! ;-)
,,Crass and grotesque,3.0,,This landmark can be seen from almost any part of Singapore city but that does not mean it is attractive - purely a symbol of look at me and it is not much different up top. Wonderful views that show you every part of Singapore
,,the bar at the top is amazing,5.0,,i can't forget when my friend and i got drunk on the 56th or 57th floor of the building whoah we almost wanted to jump and fly! the feeling is so amazing that i really have to write good reviews about them
,,Over priced,2.0,,"It's worth going up and having a look but it is a rip off. You have to pay $20 to get up there to the bar AND if you want to go on to the viewing platforms, then it's an extra $23! Also, they tell you that you can redeem the $20 for the bar with food or drinks...sounds good...but no, they have you again! You have to still pay tax on your drinks. So even though you get the $20 off, you are still paying something. I feel this is just a tourist trap. It's a nice experience but way over priced."
,,Worth the ticket price,4.0,,"The hotel and casino are fairly typical and quite crowded when I was there. I bought a ticket to go up to the observation deck, and it was worth every penny for the amazing 360 view of Singapore. The restaurant was packed and could not get in, and the snack bar was staffed with inattentive clerks who took their time serving a long line. Crowded, but not so bad that you can't enjoy the view."
,,Free time during business trip,5.0,,"If you have a chance, you must see. Merlion and the Sand Skypark are one of a kind. Does cost to go up to top of Skypark but the view is fantastic."
,,Marina bay sands skypark,5.0,,"Another amazing place to visit in Singapore, the views are spectacular, it is a place not to be missed"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Nice view from the TOP, nice location, good to click photos, must visit in Singapore, well connected by mrt n buses"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,It’s an amazing place to watch the city during sunset. Make sure you watch sunset from here and Have your camera with you.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The sky park is amazing. Even though I've seen it many times, I never get tired of the sight! Especially after dark, it's really special to see."
,,Wow!!,5.0,,"Enjoyed a lovely evening cocktail at the rooftop bar made by friendly and knowledgeable staff. With amazing views, a fantastic atmosphere made all the more spectacular by clever lighting, and great service the Marina Bay Sands was a good choice."
,,Nice views day or night,4.0,,This place is good spot and has nice views day or night. There are many ways to get to the top and enjoy the views.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Great place to visit! Wonderful shops, light show at night and beautiful hotel with observation lookout over gorgeous Singapore."
,,Just a viewing platform,3.0,,"Now just a high rise viewing platform and you can longer get to the hotel section (probably rightly so if you've paid to stay there and you can't move for tourists coming up to see the view and the pool)
Fairly costly but you can get a small discount if you travelled with Singapore airlines and show some proof."
,,WHAT A VIEW,5.0,,A MUST GO Place if you are in Singapore . You can go the Roof Top bar and have foods anytime you want and its a awesome place to be around .Great view on all areas and Deck is awesome . awesome food for reasonable Price
,,Too expensive to view,2.0,,"Best to visit this place for free if you are staying at MBS hotel,othereise you need to pay just to get the view which you can get from any hotel room with city view. Although it gives you almost 360 degree of city view but thats all you get."
,,Great views,4.0,,Definitely worth the money to go up - the views are amazing. Take your Singapore airlines boarding pass and you get a discount.
,,The waterfront views and this Hotel are breathtaking.,5.0,,"Lot's of activity, food, and visual stimulation. This is a must must see destination in Singapore. We walked around the waterfront, over the bridge, into and behind the hotel and then went up to the top floor to experience the amazing view of the city. Our entire family loved the experience!"
,,"Must do, must see. Can be done by people who are scared of height even.",4.0,,"Sky deck at 20$ , better done in the day time. Night view had its own charm. Bring along your selfie sticks, tripods not allowed. Better to do 20SGD deal verses waiting in line"
,,Great views,4.0,,"We wanted to visit the hotel as we hadn't been before. A great way to do it is to go to Tower 3 and access the Skybar, which is on the 57th floor. You pay S$20 to access the bar but that is redeemed against a drink. The drinks were just over S$20 so it's definitely worth it.

We were with our young children and there was no charge for them. They were made to feel welcome with some bar snacks.

The views are great from the bar as well as the small viewing platform.

There is no access to the pool, which is strictly for hotel guests.

A great place for views of Singapore."
,,Overrated and expensive.,3.0,,"If your not a guest you don’t get a look in at going to the outside of the sky bar to see the light show for example, you take from the backside of the park down to the Gardens by the Bay, don’t get me wrong, it is a great view but the city and light show is what everybody likes to see and photograph. On asking people up their all agreed, overpriced and we were all their paying for the view, or what you got of it. A pity really because it has so much potential. Now off the buck list."
,,A Paranomic view of Singapore CBD area,5.0,,"There is a way to get up to Sky Park and not paying a lot of it. You can purchase a entry coupon $20 to exchange it for a drink in the Sky bar during weekends. During weekdays, they did not even bother to check how many pax are buying drinks or not. The bartender is experienced and courteous by explaining the type of cocktails available. For a group of 5, I spent less than $90 for 4 drinks. The glittering lights shone across CBD area will go down our memory lane. You must never miss this trip over there. Just Do it like the Nike Slogan. Ciao"
,,So far the most unbelievable hotel structure,5.0,,"We went here during night; there was unbelievable light shows at that time. I was speechless when watching it and I could most likely watch it all night long. We went back the next day to just see the day view of it. For me, nothing's different. Day or night, this is the most majestic hotel structure I've seen so far!"
,,Should do when in Singapore,5.0,,"Skypark wasn't on our itinerary, but then we just went ahead with it and weren't a bit disappointed.
It is much higher than the Singapore Flyer so you get better views from the Skypark.

The city View at night time is amazing and a must do when in Singapore."
,,Excellent views.,5.0,,"Skypark is a must see, the views are amazing. There is heaps of room so you don't fell squashed, the day views are excellent and the night views are pretty spectacular as well. There is a shop on the sky park so you can always get a cold water or soft drink. If you want alcohol then you need to go to the bar, you get a view from there, but can't walk around as it's always busy."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Tip: visit the skypark, accessible through the hotel lobby. You have to get a SD20,- ticket but that can be used again any purchase of a drink or something to eat.
Go to the bar, at the top, around sunset and enjoy the spectacular view.
Hotel pool is for hotel guests only, but you can still watch them.
Don't forget to look on the other side, and see all the ships in the strait of Singapore and the Gardens of the Bay from above."
,,Simply Excellent,5.0,,"Had been both in day and evening, spectacular views and amazing photos of the marina and fullerton bay to cherish with."
,,Sneak Peeked at the facilities.......looked inviting and with a great view,5.0,,"This is an amazing site to visit when staying in Singapore. The whole building is very impressive and due to its spectacular design a gem of the city.

Absolutely a must visit !

We went into the building and headed for the elevators. We waited for one of the hotel's guests to enter, in order for him to activate the elevator with his card, and selected to go to the rooftop - in this way you can see the rooftop on your own without booking a tour, as that is not necessary.

The views have the wauw-factor and you can enjoy those for a long time. You see a big part of the city and its stunning structures and the harbor as well.

There is a bar for the general public up there which opened at 11 am. and we went there to queue in order to be among the first to enter - and we succeeded.

We were able to be seated just at the wall to the pool area and had a great view. There is a ""must-buy"" policy if you sit down but it is still cheaper than going with any tour.

We enjoyed this outing a lot and would recommend all travelers to go...:-)"
,,Great views that shouldn't be missed!,5.0,,"Go up to the observation deck just before it gets dark so you can enjoy the views in daylight and after dark. Yes it costs $23.00 but when are you going to be 56 floors in the sky in Singapore again!? It's worth it, trust me. I could have sat up there all evening."
,,Sky park,5.0,,Marina Bay sands sky park is a great place for kids and adults by sitting in pool we can see the entire city that's great experience
,,Spectacular views and a happening place,5.0,,"Went to Ce La Vie on top of the Marina Bays Sands hotel on the 57th floor and the experience was amazing. The views from all sides were breathtaking and you can't help yourself from snapping endless photos. Seeing people swim in the infinity pool is a bit jarring, as if suspended in mid air. I envied them and wish I could jump right in.

The burger was one of the best I've ever had. Both the gin and vodka cocktails were smooth and went down too easily. At $24 a shot it adds up quickly. The DJ beat was a good mix of happy hour music that pounded louder as the evening went on.

A must see for any first time visitor, if not pricey. You won't regret it."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"What a beautiful place to visit. Went up to the observation deck, stunning views. Had a few drinks at the rooftop bar. Was in awe"
,,Worth it!,4.0,,"Great views, $23 ticket price, seniors and children get discount I believe.

Very busy so you may have to jostle for a place.

Souvenirs available when you get to the viewing point.

Only gave 4 stars because I was slightly underwhelmed, don't know why but I was expecting it to be slightly better."
,,Good for breakfast,4.0,,A small menu for breakfast compared with other restaurants but the quality was good. I only ate there for the views which did not disappoint.
,,best views of Singapore,5.0,,"well worth the entry fee of $30 SIN , went first thing in the morning to avoid crowds, views are stunning and breath-taking , nice coffee shop. Spent about 30min taking in the views, well worth the $"
,,A must see but very busy with busloads of tourists,5.0,,"Of course a must see rooftop bar, but be prepared to cue up and have patience to reach your final destination. Very very crowded bar as well, we had to fight for a seat, and wait ages for our drinks, but you take it all for the spectacular sight it is."
,,Stunning views and great photo opportunities,4.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore, there are so many attractions to see but this whole area is lovely and a must to get some great holiday photos."
,,Nice view,5.0,,"As we all know that Singapore is not the cheapest city in the world, the Skypark is of course charging as well for the visit. It is great for taking some pictures but nothing spectacular. The pool and restaurants you can not see as they are only for hotel guests."
,,Tourist attraction and just it,2.0,,"Go up there, take your photos and begone. One thing i cannot get with singapore is how someone invests millions and then hires little boygirl joe from the house in the green pastures to waiter in the most cool of locations. Great taste in art and flowers but not in running clubs. Mediocre finger food with mefiocre drinks made by 18year olds. I mean common guys respect the money you invested."
,,Skypark visit,5.0,,Located on top of the Marina Sands hotel it is quite amazing. From the edgeless infinity pool to the gardens as well as the view this is a must see in Singapore. They even offer pictures for souvenirs that are gorgeous.
,,Beautiful Singapore,4.0,,"During my last week visit, we visited dis aesm structure too...we were stunned after having a look fm its 56th floor...we were almost touching d sky...watta view of city! A must visit place!"
,,Dominating sight at Singapore's skyline,4.0,,"This building dominates the skyline of Singapore and makes excellent pictures. You can easily enter the hotel and have a look inside the beautifully designed lobby. To go up, you need to pay a (high) fee."
,,Best cocktails,5.0,,Luxury stay. Awesome infinity pool. Friendly staff great location near the bay gardens and the casino
,,Crowded and over-rated.,3.0,,"We booked (and pre-paid) for an inter-connecting room to be told on arrival (following a ridiculously long wait to check in!) that we could only have an inter connecting room if we upgraded at a further cost. As we were travelling with out two children aged 9 and 11, this was our only option. We were not disappointed by the quality of the rooms or the views, they were magnificent and worth the room rates. The cleaning was exceptional and we were really looked after with well appointed rooms. However, we found staff mostly indifferent to us and quite usually unhelpful when asking about appropriate venues for family dining. Most of the staff were moody and solemn and we were directed to highly inappropriate family venues on several occasions over our 4 day stay. The pool lives up to it's dazzling view promise however it is EXTREMELY CROWDED however it is very well policed by staff Life Guards who do a really wonderful job. Given that you cannot tell people what to do, the amount of selfie sticks made me more dizzy than the height! There is a separate pool for ""adults only"". Given the many adults swimming in the family area without children, I think it would be useful for those people to swim in the appropriate area so that families don't have to feel uncomfortable about who might be photographing their children. Pool dining menu is limited and not very interesting. I ordered a Caesar salad (requesting dressing on the side) and this consisted of a bowl of Cos lettuce with grated parmesan cheese (anchovy dressing on side - I cannot eat mayo). Service was slow. Obviously this is a very popular hotel however we were not prepared for the huge crowds here and it made the stay very impersonal. We were really disappointed."
,,"Great View, Hot in the middle of the day.",4.0,,"We stayed at the Hotel so the entrance to the Skypark is Free. We came here twice, once in the day time and another time at night. In the middle of the day its very hot as there is no shade and the heat radiates of the wooden floor. You get good views of both the city and the gardens by the bay. There is a small shop to buy a drink. As we didn't pay an entrance fee I'm not sure how expensive it was to enter and if it was worth the price. You would also get the same view from the City Flyer wheel, so you can decide which one you would like to do. You cant see the pool from the Observation Deck, so don't go up if you think you are allowed to see the Infinity pool."
,,Stopped in for a drink,4.0,,"We wanted to visit the Skypark before we left SIngapore. So we bought our Ce La Vie tickets on the ground floor, took the lift to the 57th floor, and then redeemed our coupon for a cocktail each. The rest of our party had Singapore slings and I enjoyed a ""botanical"" and we checked out the amazing view.
A prefect end to our SIngapore visit."
,,Great Views - Viewing deck is not large. Not a place to linger too long unless you have a drink/food,4.0,,"You just have do it at least once when in Singapore. We walked to the resort, spent time looking (not buying) in the expensive shops, great decor and people watching-hilarious. As other Tripadvisors mention check out any deals with lunch included to go up to the deck. If not take the lift and your camera and spend time with your loved ones, admire the view and take some snaps (selfies seem to be all the rage). If you can afford and have the time make the most of the view and have a drink/snack and look out over the wonderful skyline. It's romantic and memorable. Once you are through the little gate there is also a lounge type bar around the corner worth a look and you can see through to the beautiful people sunbathing and posing around the pool. Loved it. Was worth the money even though the wine was $26 a glass. Here's cheers."
,,Breathtaking views at night time,5.0,,"Stopping off in Singapore for a couple of nights on our way home we couldn't miss going up to the observation deck of Marina Bay Sands Skypark. This hotel stands majestically over the Singapore landscape, looking out to the sea and down onto Gardens By the Bay.... We went to the park first then went up to the observation deck around 9.30pm. It was totally mesmerising looking down onto a beautifully lit Singapore. The bar and restaurant up the top were packed to capacity, what a fabulous place to enjoy a meal and drinks. The cost of getting up to the deck was excellent value. Its certainly a sight I will keep in my mind for a lot time to come. Don't miss it but go at night to take advantage of the amazing light show that is Singapore."
,,Amazing view,3.0,,"It's just majestic. When you are on top, you will have an amazing view of the whole of Singapore Must visit."
,,Great views,5.0,,"The observation deck provided great views of the gardens, river and other areas. Well worth the experience. 👍👍👍👍👍"
,,Nice View - Have Set Lunch at restaurant at the top to save on lift ticket,4.0,,"Review by Dr Sim. If you are going up the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, it would be advisable to check if there are promotions for set lunches at the restaurants up there. If you so, you do not have to pay the ticket for the lift up. However, the set lunches are not cheap. But it beats paying ticket just to see the view. View is nice up there. Regards DrSim001"
,,At the Summit of MBS,5.0,,Excellent view- was able to enjoy the view and the lovely weather. Location is fantastic and it's gives a perfect view of Singapore's business district.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,So amazing--the view is perfect and you can see all of the city! Lots of other visitors though. Going at night is special with all the lights!
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Spectacular views of the city great photo opportunitys On a good day you can see Indonesia . You can have a drink in the bar their too
,,Superb views,5.0,,For an overview of Singapore this is a must place to visit. It's easy to access from tower 3 which is on the left hand side when looking from the other side of the bay.
,,Must visit,5.0,,Most popular building in Singapore with plenty shops and restaurants. Fantastic view from the rooftop trace
,,Luxury shopping,5.0,,"All famous brands under one roof, the ""usual"" mix of fashion, watch & jewelry brands and fine dining on highest level - in terms of presentation and price. A spectacular ""waterfall"" is attracting at the center of the mall, an evening light show puts the whole assembly of Marina Bay Sands hotel, conference center, the mall and the art-science museum in a symphony of light, water fountains and sound at 8PM - best visible and not overcrowded from the oposite side of the marina bay."
,,Weather to go?,5.0,,"This is a relatively cheap attraction, it only cost around £13 per adult for a trip to the top of a super feature hotel overlooking the Singapore bay. We travelled up mid morning and took lots of photographs in all directions overlooking the whole skyline. Absolutely brilliant, and some useful guides to the Singapore features in each direction.

But then, the heavens opened. Typical shower, really heavy and powerful. Unfortunately there isn’t much cover up on the observation deck so this pretty much cut short our visit. Just as well we got our photos in early.

Although the ticket allows you to stay up on the deck as long as you want, there is no re-entry option which was a bit disappointing.

Overall though, well worth a visit."
,,From the top,5.0,,"An amazing view and a great experience. We went as part of the gardens by the bay experience that included entry to the sky park. The ride up in the lift is super quickand once at the top the views are stunning. If you come to this part of the world do not leave without visiting this attraction. The price, when not inclusive of other attractions, is moderately expensive but in my opinion well worth it. We visited after dark and the lights were truly fantastic."
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,"Best views of Singapore and it just feels amazing to be on top of that marvellous building of an architectural brilliance. So here's the deal: $23 gets you up to the observation deck, more money gets you to the restaurant which is 2 meters higher than the deck where U can have a drink or a meal for extra money and more money gets you to the worlds highest and nicest infinity pool just opposite the restaurant.
We went there late afternoon to watch the sunset and then there's the light show at 7.45 of the electrical trees which one can watch from above. All in all fantastic!"
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"We took the tip from a trip advisor review and paid $20.00 each and went up to the 56th floor to the SkyBar and sat outside on the deck on comfortable lounge furniture. When you buy a drink you redeem your ticket towards the bill. It's a win win!
We visited in the late afternoon and into dusk and were blown away by the view! We had food and a great wine all whilst looking out over Singapore from a dizzying height on a clear beautiful afternoon."
,,Night views,4.0,,"Excellent night views of the city. Very spacious. Staff were efficient and friendly. They take your photo right at the start, which you can purchase for scandalous prices. I got free admission from my hotel stay but if I didn't, I think I would have been happy to pay the fee just for the views and lights."
,,Viewing Singapore at its best,4.0,,Amazing views of Singapore are seen here. I'd recommend going up in the evening where there's still a little bit of light but hang around long enough for the sun to set so you'd also get to appreciate the night views. The colours at this time of the night are spectacular. A must go for a one off experience. We went in for free as we were guests of MBS but it's also opened to non guests for S$23 pp.
,,Worth a visit to the sky bar,4.0,,"This is next to the gardens by the bay. Great panoramic views. Based on reviews here we visited the skybar rather than the viewing deck and glad we did. You pay $20 each to go up to the skybar but the $20 is converted into vouchers you use to buy drinks. There is a bar and a lounge. Bar meals/snacks. The bar overlooks the viewing deck which people pay to access. However, it is a bare deck with nowhere to sit and no shade apparent. The swimming pool area is only accessible for hotel guests but looks great from the lounge bar."
,,Worth visiting! Great views all over the city,5.0,,"At skypark you are at the 56th floor of marina bay sands and overlooking the whole city. The flyer, the ocean the skyscrapers. The view is scenic and you can get some great pictures. We stayed at the marina bay sands hotel and the entrance was free. Even though we had seen the city from the infinity pool of the hotel, we also enjoyed the view from the skypark, specially towards the flyer."
,,Great fun,5.0,,"This place is totally worth your time, definitely gonna have a great time here. The views alone are worth every penny."
,,Wow!,5.0,,This is so impressive to look at. The lift ride up to the 56th floor is very quick and smooth. Well worth spending the $20. The view is amazing including the glimpses of the pool area.
,,Skypark..Awesome view..,5.0,,"Marina bay sands skypark is located in the top of the marina bay sands hotel which is located in the heart of singapore. It's our of the top rated attractions in singapore and it has become the face of singapore in recent years. You have to take the entry tickets at the bottom, after the photo session take the high speed lift to the top floor. You can have an awesome view of the entire city at the top.many photo locations are available which will make your trip to singapore memorable. Altogether it's a highly recommended location to visit in singapore."
,,Very nice view,4.0,,"The view from the top is really amazing, there is a laser show at night it is not wow but great to see it . When we went up it was raining but the weather was incredible.there is nothing special up other than the view ."
,,Great view in Daytime and Dusk,5.0,,"There are two options to see this great view.
Pay $25.00 each to go up to the 56th floor to the SkyPark where you can walk around and take photos.
Pay $20.00 each and go up to the 56th floor to the SkyBar and sit inside the bar or out on the deck on comfortable lounge furniture. When you buy a drink you redeem your ticket towards the bill. It's a win win!
We visited during the afternoon and were so impressed we went back again at 6pm to see the sunset."
,,Ozone fun,5.0,,Sky park is one of those places you have to experience. It's in a league by itself. We celebrated our 35th wedding up there with dinner and drinks. Service is terrific! Views are over the top.
,,Architectural marvel,5.0,,"What an architectural marvel. The design is so astounding and breath taking, you just stare at the architectural marvel and wonder who designed it and build it. One of the best designs i have ever seen in my life. The place to visit when you are in Singapore. Nice place also to take a stroll along the Singapore river."
,,Great views!,4.0,,"Travelled here as part of an organised night sightseeing tour and was advised that if we'd come just as a couple, the price would have been $50 instead of $23 (pretty much the price of the entire tour!) Therefore you might as well go on the tour and get the boat ride and guide thrown in for free!

Views were great and the lift was so fast! They make you take a gimmicky photo against a green screen before going up and then try and charge and arm and a leg for it after superimposing the marina sands bay in the background. Kind of missing the point when you're at the top of the marina sands bay and therefore instead it should be the rest of the skyline behind you!

Anyway, great views but more worthwhile going as a group to get the discount!"
,,Nice skybar,4.0,,Nice skybar. Great idea that the entrance tickets can be exchange for drinks in the bar. Great view. Over Gardens by the sea. Go there!
,,The Singapore Trademark,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is unargueably the most iconic landmark in Singapore. The Skypark boasts of a viewing deck (accessible to anyone for a fee), and an infinity pool (accessible only to guests). Taking a dip in the infinity pool is a MUST when visiting Singapore. Nothing beats the experience of looking out at the Singapore cityscape after swim laps. There is also a cafe where you can order drinks and snacks at the poolside.
The viewing deck is not the only place to see the Singapore skyline. There are many nooks and crannies in the Skypark that, all in all, give the guest pretty much a 360 view."
,,Good view,3.0,,"It takes too much time in the lines to go up and come back down by elevators. View is very good over almost whole the city. Souvenir shop is very expensive on the deck and the staff are not honest, so do not forget to use your voucher cuz they don't remind you!"
,,Great views,5.0,,A must see. The views are incredible. The cost is $25SGD. If you are in Singapore you have to go. Words can’t express. You have to see for yourself.
,,An unobstructed view,4.0,,"This amazing view is totally unobstructed, with the Skypark being on front end of the ""ship"". The whole of Singapore is laid out in front of you - from the ships offshore, the rivers and the city buildings. You can stay up here on top of the world for as long as you like, just looking. There is a souvenir shop which also sells small snack type food (drinks and sweets) and a restaurant (which wasn't open early in the morning which was when we visited). We had the thrill of witnessing a marriage proposal - and the young couple were thrilled to receive the photos I snapped of the actual proposal. Not many people have photos of that moment in their life! It does get very hot up here, because there is no shade, and if you can pick a clear day, the view would be even better."
,,not great policy to even see the infinity pool but still worth the experience,4.0,,"so if you are not a guest at marina sands you cannot view the pool (i get it is crowd control but it numbered by groups it would be nice to see it). So we never did, however, we went to the bar up top vs observatory (honestly if it's really hot, do the bar, take the view with a drink and/or food) yes it is expensive but any such type of landmark is no surprise for high costs!"
,,More like a Metropolis Train Staion,3.0,,"This hotel has the busiest Reception area I have ever encountered. It was a bit like London Victoria during the rush Hour, but noisier. The views from the Skypark are spectacular especially after dark. The whole experience is go up, walk out/around the deck, take your pictures with many others and descend. Cost 23$. However we returned to the Sands later in the week and tried the Free Access platform on 52nd floor. The whole experience go up, walk out ( it is only 15feet x 3 feet), look down, take pictures with 4 or 5 others and descend. Cost Zero. Same spectacular view."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"If you are not here then you have not seen Singapore properly, comeon, you need to come and enjoy the whole place .."
,,"Nice, expensive view",4.0,,"This is about one third of the top level of the Marina Sands Hotel. You basically pay $23SD to take an elevator up, take some photos and come down.

That said, you do get a great view of both the Marina Bay (great at sunset) as well as the Super Trees on the other side and both domes as well as the Ocean beyond that.

I ended up shooting with my phone using the panoramic feature which produced some cool shots and then again with my digital camera with a couple of lenses.

What I liked the most is that for the most part, you can actually take a photo without glass in front of you. There are basically protective wires instead which give you the ability to still shoot between then and get great shots. Most places have glass this high up.

One floor up is a bar, you can take a separate elevator there but there is a price minimum at the restaurant/bar there.

Kind of an iconic view of the entire City. Would I recommend, sure."
,,Dont fall for the F1 view scam,3.0,,"The hotel was absolutely fabulous, spotlessly clean, architectually spectacular, and the staff really helpful.
Now the bad bits about my experience.

TIp
I arrived by underground There are two stops at the end of the line one called Bayfront and one called Bay Sands. Who'd have thought the stop called Bay Sands isn't actually The Bays Sands Hotel stop but is actually half a mile walk away. You actually need the Bayfront stop which the hotel sits on (der).

Now this is my real disappoint.
I booked this hotel in April having seen it on TV and always wanted to see the F1 night race in Singapore(which is in September) so thought lets go for it. I rang the hotel and asked before I booked what the best rooms for viewing the Grand Prix were. I was told to make sure you book a deluxe with view. I think it was about £50 more than a normal room. What's an extra £50 quid when your already paying £600 for a room anyway, Its all about the view hey.
About 5 days before I parted the UK I get an email from the hotel saying if I want a proper view of the race I need to pay an extra $100 for the pleasure. after a lot of emails they agree to not charge me and give me the room I thought id booked with a view of the race.
So I arrive at the hotel get the keys to the room and cant wait to see this view. As I enter the room the curtains are closed but are automatically triggered to open and reveal the view. What a view, trouble is its a great view of the bay but you can hardly see the track. Its like being at a pop concert and your so far back from the stage it could be any one on stage. The only way you know it who you thing it is, is because you recognize the music. You can just about see cars going around but no chance of recognizing who is driving them. How dare they try charge you extra for this.

In conclusion It you want to stay in one of the best hotels in the world this has got to be up there with the best, with the views of the bay infinity pool etc. Don't book this hotel though if you hope to see the F1 race from your room. There are much better hotels that are in the track itself.

So"
,,Interesting but can be expensive,3.0,,"The $23 fee per person to go up to the skypark is worth the money for the fantastic view of Singapore. There is nowhere to sit on the decking, and signs to say no sitting on the actual deck to admire the view unless you go into the restaurant (which is probably the idea). We were practically ordered to have a photo taken and at $65 for two photos they are very overpriced."
,,Amazing place to visit,4.0,,Pretty... clean... and spectacular.. bright and colorful.. from crisp green flora to magnificent pops of man made sculptures this place should be on your must do list when in Singapore
,,Nice,4.0,,A very nice place to spend a few hours. It is a pity that we did not have time to get up to marina sends bay hotel as the view must be spectacular.
,,DO yourself a favour,5.0,,We went up to the bar and sat there for 2 drinks and soaked in the sights and were just amazed. Yes it is $20 each to get up there but you get that back in credit on whatever you spend in drinks or food. We had 2 cocktails each and had a ball. Well worth the experience.
,,Amazing view outside and inside,5.0,,"You can really admire this building from a distance, especially at night. But also walking in during a day provides good memories. You will see this from nearly everywhere in Singapore and you can go through to have a look while walking to see the light show in the artificial tree park."
,,Mariana bay,5.0,,Wow the views are amazing & the shopping here is good & the little displays are entertaining. The pool for the hotel looks absolutely stunning & to swim to the edge & see that view must/would be fantastic.
,,Extreme!,5.0,,This is a must! From the ultra slick club to the iconic pool this is an excellent treat for everyone! The views of Singapore are unbelievable!
,,Amazing view of Singapore,5.0,,We stayed at the hotel so we could go to Skypark for free It is amazing view of the city. But I recommend it only at nights. The magic is coming on night hours❤️
,,Awesome view at the top,5.0,,"We had to check out the roof top and you dont have to be a guest at the hotel. The drinks average around $25 singapore dollars but you are paying for the view. It was worth it, I would do it again. It was pretty spectacular view, they have a restaurant too."
,,"Nice View, don't watch the Lasershow from here!!!",4.0,,"The view of Singapore is absolutely amazing. Not much more to tell.
If you want to go to the restaurant make sure you don't go through the skypark ticketing or you pay double.

Don't go up for the Lasershow. The one with the supertrees and the one on the other side of the marina sands are not really impressive from that hight. You can see them both but don't hear the music and it is tiny.

Price at the moment is S$23 pax, so really like expensive, but it is an exclusive view over Singapore."
,,Drinks and nibbles at Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"My friends who live in Singapore booked a table at the Skypark Bar which is essential to ensure a seat. The view is spectacular. The service very good. Cost was S$50/person + service charge 17.5% so not cheap, however, you can drink and/or eat your $50."
,,What a view!!!,4.0,,"Well worth a visit fantastic views of marina bay, a bit pricy just to go on the viewing deck, the pool up there looks amazing and worth a visit if you want to pay upwards of £320 a night!!!"
,,You've got to see the Infinity pool and the views are amazing,5.0,,"Ride up 57 floors for the best views of Singapore and Malaysia in the distance. Have a beer and snack at Ce La Vie, it's a great place to chill after walking around the Cloud Forest."

,,* Grand Prix Weekend *,4.0,,"Received a discount as showed proof of flying with Singapore Airlines. Worth a trip , excellent views . Ticks the box ."
,,Excellent view from top,5.0,,"During my stay in Singapore 2017 April, visited Skypart and it was an amazing experience, One of the dream place which i had in my list and not checked. Worth the money."
,,BEAUTIFUL PLACE,4.0,,A wonderful upmarket shopping place with a great food court. Views are spectacular from top of this hotel. Lovely place to wander around & easy to catch the MRT back to your hotel.
,,Great view!,5.0,,This was really cool. Perhaps slightly expensive for what you do but overall it was a great view. I imagine at night time/dusk its even better but even during the day its nice. Only really need to spend about 20 mins up there if you want. All wheelchair friendly too.
,,Great view at a pricey fee,3.0,,"The view is stunning but we stayed at the Swissotel the Stanford and our view from the 50th floor was just as amazing. Had I known this, I probably wouldn't have paid for the family (2adults and 2 children) to go up but at least I can say I've been up there. You do get a glimpse of the infinity pool which looks amazing but restricted to those staying at the Marina Sands. There is a small coffee shop at the top but it junk
Prices are expensive. They should've offered a drink with every ticket purchase just to make it a tad better value for money. If you are staying at a hotel that doesn't have a good view, I'd recommend you go up but the Swissotel the Stanford has breathtaking views already."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"You get an amazing view of SG from Skypark, specifically Marina Bay Area Access pool, restaurant and have fun To go to observation deck, pay SGD 28 but it's worth"
,,WOW,5.0,,Dont miss this if you come to Singapore the views are spectacular. We did this at night and the illuminated city was outstsnding.
,,A singapore must do,5.0,,Amazing views from up here.We only bought the S$20 ticket which took us into the bar area but we weren't disappointed.You are given a voucher for $20 which we used for a drink.We spent much longer up there than we thought we would but really enjoyed it.
,,Must,5.0,,Great place and one must visit! Good with family need stroller if have babies. Limited restaurants so be prepares !
,,National Treasure,5.0,,"Outstanding restaurant, unsurpassable views of the gardens and entire city. A must see building in Singapore. Greatest pool I've ever seen and view of gardens below is beyond compare."
,,Stunning views!,4.0,,"All staff member we came across, except for one gentleman that sold us the tickets (unfortunately did not get his name), were way too rude for working in hospitality industry. The most, one of the ladies at ticket desk (the oldest I guess!). Shame on her.
Views are stunning, it's a pity that walking along the pool is not allowed unless hotel guests, so you're able to see only a tiny bit of it. Still I think it's worth it. Nice also to get a drink and some fingerfood."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"The view from this place it's incredible! We were there during the formula 1 race and from the top we had a pretty good view. They offers 2 options paying just for sky bar or for the both side we recommend paying the full price.
The sky bar was quite full they overbooked and the observatory obstructs the view. The full price is $38 per person and includes a drink."
,,Wonderful light show.,4.0,,Got down here quite early to look around before the light show which was wonderful. from the walk way you could see so much. With Singapore city as the background it was just magical.
,,Fantastic views of the entire bay area.,4.0,,"Very touristy but worth a trip to the top, even for the cost. A tip for heading up is to go to one of the bars instead. This is roughly the same price but gets you into the bar which is a great place for a drink and a relax. The views up here are amazing and encompass all the bay area. We went at night which was pretty cool as the Gardens by the Bay were all lit up and you could see a light and watershow on the other side in te inner bay. Cost is between $20-$30SGD but as a tourist, just do it."
,,Amazing views and one of those must do things while you are here.,5.0,,Took the trip up and took tons of photos. The views all over Singapore alone are worth the money. Great looking down on the botanical gardens from above as well.
,,Exciting View to wake up to,4.0,,"Exciting view to wake up to either at the Garden by the Bay Room or Singapore City View.

Awesome swimming pool overlooking the skyline.Two timing to get on the pool,day and night time.It totally different feel for day and night.

Overall it must be a go to for once base on your budget."
,,STUNNING,4.0,,Take the River Boat to this Skypark it is wonderful and make sure you have walking shoes on as you link in from here to the stunning gardens it is so beautiful and views are fantastic
,,Great,5.0,,"Busy night Friday of GP but we went straight up with no wait. Plenty of people up there waiting for sunset but easy to look around and take your time.

If you want to sit there are no chairs and the food and drink is hyper expensive. Easy to bring your own there were absolutely no checks.

Insistent photo seller at the top, selling a fake picture of the family when you can get a real one five steps out the door..."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,This is a must do when you coming Singapore. The view is amazing. Go during the night as it's much cooler and you can watch the water show.
,,Best view ever,5.0,,"We stayed on the 44th floor, very spacious room. It had the most most impressive view of the city. The swimming pool on the 56th floor with its infinity pool was breathtaking. Will make the effort to stay there again."
,,"Crowded!,",4.0,,"Great views, but long queues. Worth the visit, though I am not sure I would like to stay in the hotel"
,,Great Views of Singapore,3.0,,We should have just gone direct to another floor to a bar and saved the money it cost to take the Skypark lift. It's a rort...! Yes the view are amazing but we could have had a drink in the bar for the same cost and seen the same views.
,,Look over Singapore,4.0,,We went in late afternoon to look around and waited for night to see the city light up. There are reduced prices for citizens and residents but foreign visitors pay $20 each for the elevator. There is a restaurant at the top. The gardens are open only to hotel guests.
,,Incredible building,5.0,,"At night, this thing looks like something out of Star Trek. Very upmarket shopping Mall. Large Casino was fun for a while."
,,Expensive,2.0,,"Thought the entry price was expensive and there was no place to sit when we got there !
You were not able to see the infinity pool unless you were a guest at the hotel. The views were very good but not worth entry fee in my opinion."
,,Great place for the city views,5.0,,"MBS skypark allows great views of the entire Marina bay centre including the Gardens by the bay.

Best time to visit is in the evening before sunset. You will be able to enjoy the daytime as well as night time views. Got entry tickets at $20 from a local travel agent in Little India."
,,Magnificent Views !,5.0,,My son and I went for lunch here. The food was delicious and the staff extremely friendly and we had a wonderful afternoon.
,,Wonderful Views!,5.0,,While staying in Singapore my son & I went for lunch and the food was excellent. The staff were extremely friendly and we had a vey enjoyable afternoon.
,,Terrific view.,5.0,,Excellent view over the city and Gardens by the Bay. Much higher than the Singapore Flyer. We got a discount because we had Singapore Airlines boarding passes.
,,Great value,5.0,,Great value and compared to a city like London very cheap. Very clean and efficient. Don't forget to get an EZ-link card
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Great place to visit. Go on up to the top floor to have a drink and see the views. Also have a glimpse of the infinity pool that looks over the city. Nice place to dine, drink and relax. Shopping also available."
,,Great views,4.0,,"We visited this as part of a Singapore night tour with my wife and enjoyed it. Staff were friendly and was a short wait to get to the top floor. Views were great, however food on top floor was too expensive"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"You can see spectacular view. If you have the singapore bording ticket, you can get a discount. I think that the night is better than day"
,,A romantic place,5.0,,A very romantic place to spend with your love one to enjoy your sunset and nite at singapore. They also have sky restaurant and club upthere.
,,Great city night view,4.0,,The design and the city view of the marina bay sands sky park and swimming pool are very nice. The night view of the raffle's place financial district worth the money.
,,Nice view but crowded,4.0,,"Went there in end May 17 and found the views to be nice! However, it was really crowded even on weekdays! Do not go if it's raining!"
,,Fantastic Views,4.0,,"The gardens are lush green and beautiful. The light and music show spectacular. The icing on the cake is going up the Marina Sands Bay Hotel's viewing deck. It offers 360 degree breathtaking evening views of Singapore along with a light show on the river.
Not to be missed."
,,Lovely Views,4.0,,"Really nice views from the top, although it's a little pricey, as all these viewing decks seem to be."
,,Beautiful night views,4.0,,"Great views of the city from the 56th Floor, especially at night. The mall is also very interesting with excellent restaurants and a boat ride."
,,Great way to view Singapore,5.0,,Well worth the effort- great views of a fantastic city. The line wasn't too long when I went and the view wasn't spoiled by the light rain. Take an umbrella though!
,,Rating the View ...,4.0,,"... but it's evident from some other reviews there's confusion over what you get for the money. We bought tickets from the underground ticket office (physically distinct from the hotel lobby at the ""bow"" end of the Skypark structure) and were told they were for the observation deck only and that the infinity pool and gardens were for hotel guests only. There was no mention of options for access to the bar. I'm guessing the person who said they got into the bar for free must have used the hotel elevator as the Sky Park elevator only has a stop at Level 56 (the observation deck). You can walk up stairs to the level of the bar and a little beyond it but I didn't take note of any signs regarding access to the bar from that point. There is as noted elsewhere, a snack bar on the observation deck but no seating. There are signs saying sitting on the deck is not allowed but more than a few visitors seemed to ignore those.

Overall, whilst the daytime views are undoubtedly spectacular, it did feel like you were tolerated up there rather than welcomed notwithstanding the admission charge and the segregation from hotel guests was clear.

I should add we were asked when buying the tickets if we'd flown with Singapore Airlines, and on providing proof we had, a 15% discount was applied. Don't know if that applies to any other airlines generally or at least in the Star Alliance. Worth asking when buying."
,,Avoidable at such prices,3.0,,"Had been to Burj Khalifa earlier and found that average. By that standards it was poor. We visited at night, though it gives a beautiful view of the city but the price is just not worth it. If you have decided to go and want to plan the I would recommend you to plan your timing in a way that you can see the evening lighting show of the Gardens by the bay from the top. Didn't see that but I am sure it would have made some difference to the ratings I have give here."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,I would recommend paying the money to go up the sky park just for the experience of them breathtaking views. You get an amazing panoramic view of the surrounds of beautiful Singapore. It's truly a must do experience. There is a bar at the top of here however we chose not to stop by and have a drink or a bite to eat but it's good to know the facilities are there.
,,Great views,5.0,,"Visited in the week of the GP and expected it to be busy but no crowds. Price of $23 really good as it was a jaw dropping from the top! It was hot with no breeze. One issue - no shade, no access to sit down bar but a snack bar selling a wide range of drinks would be ok if you sit down. No seats at all so be warned."
,,Observation Gallery only,3.0,,"My husband and I only went to the Observation gallery on the 56th floor of the third tower to see the views over the city. It cost us S$20 each. Although the views are amazing, there's no where to sit. It costs another S$20 to visit the cafe and to do this, you have to return to the ground level, buy another ticket and come back up again. We were not offered this option when we bought our ticket to the 56th floor. I think you get your S$20 back when you buy refreshments in the cafe, but I can't confirm this.
There is a kiosk on the 56th floor selling drinks and snacks, but as I said before, there's no where to sit."
,,Over rated views great but service not so good,2.0,,"I made every effort to find ticket sales after catching a cab to the venue.i specifically stated I wanted to dine or go to the bar. I was sent out side to bye my tickets at the downstairs sales counter. Once at the 56 th floor , the Sky park we walked around and then asked how to get to the restaurant/ bar. No Madame you can't go there your ticket only gets you to this level. Not one seat to take a rest and my friend who has a disability was expected to stand for 1 hr to wait for the light show. It was unwelcoming and expensive if you can't even sit to enjoy the surroundings. Had we been given the opportunity to buy the correct ticket at a different place we would have been given a discount off our dinner or drinks.
The light show was underwhelming I must say."
,,Swimming and having fun on top of the world,5.0,,This is an architectural wonder!! I simply love the feeling every time I visit. Its truly amazing and the swimming pool unique.
,,Great.,5.0,,"360 view of Singapore. 23SGD/pax, different prices for senior (above 65) and kids below 12. Free for hotel guests and kids under 2 yrs old.

They have a bar + restaurant on the deck, with a great view.

Depends on your preference, you can go during day or night. I like going at night to see the thousands flickering lights throughout SG. Also, to avoid sun burn. Haha."
,,Over priced,3.0,,It was like 50$ to go onto observation deck we just got the elevator up to the bar for free you can still see whole city and gardens from there don't have to pay
,,the best place for a hot date!,5.0,,"the ambiance, the view, and food make just a magical moment to enjoy with your S.O. make a reservation and show on time, has a huge demand"
,,Great,4.0,,The view was the best ever. So glad we went. Taxi driver gave us lots of good tips. Was well worth the trip. A must go
,,Great views,4.0,,"We eventually found the area to obtain access to the lift that takes you up to the top.
You pay your money ($23sgd), get your photo taken before you step into the lift, then once you get up to the top you are shown the finished result, a cardboard framed photo with you amongst the Marina Bay Sands. They do a good job of the photo, however $65S is a bit rich.
The views from the top are fabulous. When we got to to the top it was raining, so we had a drink to pass the time until the rain passed.
The sun came out and then we took a lot of photos.
It was a great way to see Singapore."
,,Best view in the city,4.0,,"You can't get a better of Singapore anywhere else, you can see for miles and even parts of Malaysia."
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,"Like most things in Singapore this is an expensive activity but if you register with Marina Bay sands online you will get 20% discount. The best time to go is before dusk. See the skyline during the day and then at night as well. Both are spectacular views. It's a limited sky observation deck with a restaurant adjacent - you can't get to the hotel or the infinity pool. We went before dusk, it is a popular time and people sit down on the floor at the top waiting for it to turn dark. This can be annoying as they're in the way but it's a very big observation area. Well worth a visit, there is a shop at the top to buy ice creams and drinks etc. The view of Singapore is outstanding, recommend going up. There is a light and fountain show just outside the nearby mall (Marina Bay mall) about 8pm. Worth watching it's good"
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,Enjoyes classic cocktails and B52 shots under the litup skyline and a full ariel view of the gorgeous city of Singapore. Must visit.
,,Pick a clear day,4.0,,"Views are fantastic - that goes without saying.
Worth doing at least once but unfortunately the only day I had in Singapore was raining but still it was an experience to marvel at the sheer ingenuity to build such a place.
$20 per person entrance fee which is also then redeemable for food and beverage. Given the cocktails at the bar are $23++ the $20 coupon doesn't stretch very far - sip very slowly.
It was an awesome Mojito by the way!"
,,A hotel like no other,4.0,,Looks like three towers with a boat resting across them. Inside offers you first class accommodation overlooking the gardens at the bay.
,,Lovely view!!,5.0,,Must visit place. You can see skyline of Singapore right from top.. We visited it in evening after sunset and the view was simply Awesome..
,,Wow! Amazing! A bit pricey though...,5.0,,"This place was brilliant, 100's of shops (mainly designer), restaurants and even a theatre! They were also working on an ice rink...
We ran out of time to go to the top bar but we've heard it to be very popular. Not a cheap place to eat and expect to pay $20 or so for an alcoholic drink. We would love to come back and would definitely recommend visiting this place!"
,,Outstanding if you're not afraid of heights,5.0,,"A $23SGD sky pass will get you up to the top and onto one end of the Sypark (the rest is for hotel guests). You can see across to the infinity pool from here.... how did they even build this.

Views across harbour, Singapore Flyer below, CBD... there's not much you can't see from up here. Simply outstanding if you're not afraid of heights ;)"
,,Fabulous views,4.0,,"A visit to the Marina Bay Sands observation deck was a bit of a 'must do' with the building being so renowned for its modern, striking design. Its not a cheap outing and the cost of photo experience is highly inflated ( as many photos at attractions are) - photos of your own real experiences may be more satisfying than the green screen.
You can't see the park or pool other than a glimpse as its at the other end of the 'boat' from the observation deck. Still worth while!"
,,Amazing View,5.0,,If u want to see Singapore City just visit here.. Top of Singapore You can see both bay and city from here.
,,marina bay sands hotel,5.0,,"great views of Singapore take camera, 1/2 hour to view, café but need to go to next level in lift, opportunity to buy photo"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Love this place. The lights show is worth waiting for until it's dark. You can view it all in less than half an hour, so play this as a quick stop over."
,,Great views,5.0,,We paid the $20 per person to go up to the top of the marina bay sands which I know sounds expensive. But you then get that money back in a voucher to use in the ce la vie restaurant at the top. It's such a great idea as you can have drinks up there using this voucher and you can enjoy the views for miles. Your $20 won't get you very far but one drink at least! The only problem is unless you are staying at the hotel you can't use the amazing infinity pool up there! We wish we had known about this amazing place before we had gone as we would have paid the insane privilege with fantastic views.
,,Worth seeing Singapore from up high,4.0,,"Go into the hotel and walk all the way to the Tower 3 elevator. There is a desk just outside of the elevator where you purchase your way up to the Sky Lounge, Observation Deck, Ce La Vie Deck. I wanted drinks so I purchased the $20 voucher to get up to the 57th floor. This voucher is used towards drinks & food at the bar. The prices are not cheap but the view is worth it. And the Observation Deck is right next to it around the edges of the Sands.
NOTE that it's a separate ticket to get onto the Observation Deck. You can still get a good photo of the Gardens by the Bay standing by the edge of Ce La Vie. You'll get some of the deck in your photos but my photos turned out pretty good even with the deck in the bottom of the picture."
,,amazing views,5.0,,"awesome views, well worth the $23.00 to go up to Skypark. Nice to have a drink or coffee and chat. Make sure it is a nice day so you can sit outside. If it rains they make you go inside for safety reasons but it is nice looking at the views outside. The food is great."
,,"Commercial, commercial, commercial.",2.0,,"For those that wish to surround themselves with pouty lipped individuals taking selfies then this is your Mecca, you will be in good company. Yes, the views are great but for me it was not worth having to deal with the crowds and over priced drinks. Subjective, perhaps, but there are sufficient of us that abhor this type of tourist trap that may find this type of review useful."
,,Great experience,4.0,,"Friendly personal (thank you Shah). Good location. Room cleaned and really soundproofed. Maybe the balcon with the Marina Bay Sands view was quite little, compared with the photos on the website."
,,Not a bad sight to see,3.0,,"The attraction provides a great view of the city. There is plenty of area to walk around and view the city from. There is a small concession stand on the deck. However, if you are expecting more than a lace to see the city from up high, you will be disappointed"
,,excellent experience,5.0,,My friends came from America. We went to the 57th floor to take a helicopter view of Singapore. He said that's an excellent experience. He would like to recommend this place to his friends as well.
,,WCSH 2017,5.0,,"A hotel of extra class. Try the infinity pool- wow. Very nice rooms , fantastic view on Singapore, shopping and food court inhouse as well as a casino an train station"
,,Great mbs view,4.0,,"From top u get to see a great view. There is a bar or restaurants which u can have a light meals while enjoying the view. Relax place to hang around and chit chatting. Other then that , nothing much to do."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,We went to club 55 at 9 PM and spend around a couple of hours enjoying chocolate & cheese buffet along with some drinks. While the quality of the food wasn't out of ordinary the views definitely were. If you go an hour earlier you can also enjoy light and water show.
,,Incredible views,5.0,,"The Marina Bay towers are impressive from the ground, but Singapore is even more impressive from the top of the towers. A must for all travellers"
,,Expensive view but worth the money spent,4.0,,"Stayed only two nights as we are on our way home back to Melbourne
Check in was at the reception at Tower One and room was only available after 2 pm
Room was on the 31st floor on Tower 3.

If you have a choice , please ask for a room on a floor higher than the 34th level.
Not all the lifts on Tower 3 would take guests to the top floor on 57th level.
Certain lifts only go up to the 34th floor and then the guests have to walk to the other lifts that would take them to the 57th floor.

Our room faced the Garden by the Sea and it was fairly spacious for a 5 stars hotel.
Loved the automated window curtains in the room.

Room was clean and well maintained by the staff especially Li Bing who went out of his way to accommodate us in doing an extra cleaning of the room due to a small mishap.
Many thanks to Li Bing , hotel staff member , for cleaning our room beyond my expectations. Well done ! Li Bing

The views from the Swimming pool on the 57th floor was worth the money . Access to the swimming pool and the observation deck are only gained by room cards.
Daytime and nighttime views from the top floor are very much different.
It is my opinion that 30% of our hotel cost is based on these fantastic views of the Singapore city lights and buildings

A brief quick walk around the hotel casino and like many casinos that I have seen , this casino is no different. Boring flashing and spinning neon lights do not excited me.

Food at the hotel restaurants is expensive and the food court on the other end of the building is also expensive. Instead we took the subway MRT train to the next station Bugis on the Downtown Blue line for dinner .

Overall it was an expensive experience but it is worth the money spent."
,,Best Views during NDP,5.0,,Went to the Sky Park to catch the parade this year and the view was amazing. You will be up close with the fighter jets and could look down on the Apaches and Chinooks. The fireworks were right in front of you at eye-level. I would visit again next year if the parade is held at the Floating Platform again.
,,What a view,5.0,,"We were not staying here and went up to the 57th floor and into the bar for a drink and the view. I have read that you are supposed to pay for entry, well we didn't. The view is spectacular/breathtaking and an absolute MUST when visiting Singapore. The infinity pool is residents only, sadly,"
,,Good place to view entire Singapore in one go,5.0,,Good place to view entire Singapore in one go. Recommend to visit at night around 7:15 -7:30 pm catch the merlion light show at 8 and the garden by the bay light show at 7:45 Good place for photography.
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"i really enjoyed it. I can see the lights, city, river so clearly. I love watched the skyline from here. But I'm so surprise with the queue but its never mind, I'm still in love with the view from the top."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,Went to the skylark at night to see the views of Singapore at night. Breathtaking views. Not to be missed if you stay in Singapore
,,Wow,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands is just an incredible feat of architecture and construction. The view from the top is awesome and well worth a visit
,,Lovely View,5.0,,This is a lovely experience. You can have the best possible view from this. It is value for money. Recommend to visit.
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,SD23 per person transports you to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for the best views over Singapore So much to see Take your camera (no tripods allowed) Visit the C'est la Vie restaurant and chill while you take it all in
,,Amazing to see,5.0,,"Worthwile to visit, even if it is only the observation deck on top of the building. Fantastic views onto the city. Breathtaking architecture ..."
,,Marina bay,5.0,,Lovely place to visit marina bay in Singapore its fantastic location in Singapore every people must visit this place
,,Nice view,4.0,,View is good but limited tables. Good tourist point to visit for travelers. A must visit for first time or one time travelers to Singapore.
,,Overlooking Singapore,5.0,,"This is the place to unwind ,the view was do nice .Highly reccomended, must visit in Singapore.you can try the bar and restaurant licared at 57 floor"
,,"Great view, but so many people!",3.0,,"The view from the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands is quite spectacular, but be warned, you will be sharing it with lots of other people. The Infinity Pool looks at times more like human soup. But the view's nice."
,,Exellent place!,5.0,,"Iconic hotel of Singapore. Phenomenal view from the roof level, infinity pool is fantastic, even there is a loooot of people!"
,,Overwhelming View of Singapore,4.0,,A very nice view of SG. Just wow! It's my first time to visit here and I'm overwhelmed with the view.
,,Bird's Eye View,3.0,,"If you want to see the city from above, this is your best bet. It offers a 360 degree view of the whole city and feel the air kissing on your face. Located at 57th floor of the Marina Bay hotel. There's nothing else to do here except enjoy the view. There's a restaurant as well if you want to chill and hang out. I wish the photos they took is free or complimentary for this activity."
,,Great views of Gardens by the Bay and the Port,4.0,,"I visited Singapore for 6 days with my husband and parents. We spent most of a day at Gardens by the Bay, then really enjoyed going up to the sky deck to look down on the area as well as the rest of the city and the port ($22 p/p to go up). It was hazy but still good views. After about 30 min up there a thunder storm came through so we left, but that had been more than enough time. For us the port views were so interesting - so many boats its insane! And orientating ourself with the city after we had done a hop on hop off bus was good. Other than the view there is not much up the top - some expensive drinks and thats all. We are from NZ, so liken it to going up the Skytower to have a look around and then come down :)"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Really very nice hotel with superb amenities. The infinity pool is a WOW. If you prefer personal service perhaps this hotel is not for you as it's HUGE. That said the team are great. Great restaurants and convenient to the stylish boutiques.
,,Wow - just Wow!,5.0,,A truely fantasic view of Singapore from the Skypark. Price wise it is well worth the money (cheaper than the London Shard for example). The professional photos were pretty expensive however.
,,Spectacular Views,5.0,,"A great place with a great view. A must visit really because the building itself is quite extraordinary. However, be sure if how to get there, cause we were visiting it from gardens by the bay. There's a bridge connecting the gardens by the bay and Marina sands bay. Take that and go left towards tower three."
,,Amazing view of amazing city,5.0,,"Had a layover in Singapore so went over to see the Skywalk. Was really happy with my decision, I went up at sunset and watched the day turn into night. The price was good and the view was def well worth it. Highly recommend it!"
,,holiday stopover,5.0,,This is a mist visit both day and night . It does cost 23 dollars to go to the 57th floor but you then get this off your Bar or food if you want . The views are a must see and very clear. No tripods allowed but at night it is possible to rest your camera on the top of the glass barrier to hold camera very still. Plenty of room to move around when up there
,,Amazing hotel and pool,5.0,,"I only booked one night and bring your wallet because nothing is cheap, but I wanted to experience the pool and that thing did not disappoint. It was always easy to get a seat and the pool is so big that it never fault crowded. You can get food and drinks and you pay through roof for that as well.
This hotel is attached to the gardens, casino, mall, and a rapid transit stop as well.
If you are here splurge and you will have a blast."
,,Definite visit,5.0,,Must must must visit this place while in Singapore to enjoy the beautiful views of the city specially during sunset and at night.
,,Good city views - best at night,4.0,,We came to the observation deck on our first evening and thoroughly enjoyed the views. The team take a nice photo also which you can purchase for a reasonable price at the top. The views are great and we watched the light shows whilst on the observation deck. There is no time limit up on the deck and a cafe to purchase snacks or merchandise is available.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Overall the skypark’s view is Amazing, especially if you come when sun is set. thats the perfect time to visit."
,,"Fantastic View, but very I felt trapped",2.0,,"The view is fantastic, but that is it. You only have access to the observation deck, not the Skypark, so it's a lie. The observation deck have no shadow, no benches to sit, just a small kiosk so you don't starve. As there was no benches, many persons sit on the floor. Then every 5 minutes a hotel representative tells everyone to stand up! Very disrespectfull, they obligate you to stand. I did feel like a prisoner. But again, the pictures are great."
,,Great views,5.0,,The best place to see Singapore from in the bay area well worth it and an amazing structure too. There's not much at the top just a deck !
,,One ticked off the bucket list!,5.0,,"One of the world's iconic hotels didn't disappoint! Great staff, wonderful hotel throughout - and then there's the pool! Every bit as great as the pictures look on google images!!! A must for anyone in their lifetime!"
,,Pricey but Impressive,4.0,,"If you are in town for a week or more you might want to sign up for a free Sands Rewards Lifestyle card as it will get you 20% discount here and 50% at the ArtScience Museum.

The sky park, for someone not staying at the hotel, isn't really a park at all because all the greenery is in the guests-only area. So what you get is more like the deck of a ship with a bar, a snack bar and gift shop thrown in.

Having said all that, the views are fantastic. And if you are prepared to time your visit for just before sunset, you can get some amazing views/photos of Singapore by day and night.

You can catch a glimpse of the hotel's infinity pool as you look back along the curved edge of the ""ship"". But it's the wrong angle to see the infinity view. I came here a few years ago when you could still get into the pool area but, sadly, that is all closed to the public now.

Finally, once you have drunk in as many vistas as you can handle, you will have the opportunity to purchase the obligatory ""green screen"" photo of your group. The initial asking price is eye-popping, but I managed to haggle down to less than a third of that by forgoing the leather frame and digital download!

In conclusion, it's definitely not to be missed, but don't expect a park!"
,,Incredible Views!,5.0,,"Amazing spot to see the city! Nothing compares to the views from this deck. photo opps at every turn, downstairs world class shopping."
,,Top,5.0,,"Even if very expensive, it is a must visit if you are travelling in Saingapore. Take your time to visit the hotel and the main attraction of Gardens by the bay, located nearby. By night get a drink and stare to sparkling Singapore overview, awesome!"
,,Great View,5.0,,It Is The Highest Observatory Deck located at 56 Floor Of Marina Bay Sands The View Of The City From This Observatory Is Fabolous Excellent Place To Visit Perfect For Family Visit
,,Amazing! Glad we visited!,5.0,,"Certainly one of our most memorable nights in Singapore. Forget what everyone else is saying, just make time to visit and experience it for yourself. No cost for us to go directly up to the sky bar. Two areas, nightclub and then the bar. We ordered a bottle of wine at the bar area and allowed to sit in the VIP section. Was nice gesture otherwise would have been staying as was busy. Stopped by the night club area just to see the infinity pool."
,,Superb Hotel,5.0,,You can't believe the incredible architecture of this Hotel......Travel to the top.....not expensive....and view Singapore at night.
,,"Amazing drinks, food and views from Spago on the 57th floor",4.0,,Had a ball at Spago - fantastic food and drinks whilst looking out towards the city skyline over the infinity pool. The prices are high but then again you are on the 57th level in an amazing space so for me they cancelled each other out..
,,tooooo much crowded,2.0,,tooooo much crowded and only one or two elevators for everyone and then it is not easy to find taxi there. it is the entrance for Garden by the bay.
,,The best view in town,5.0,,"We went to the bar on the 57 floor (a must) - the views are spectacular. Be mindful that this bar is not cheap...but again, something I would put on your list to do just for the views. Great photo opportunity!"
,,Go to Spago for a drink instead.,2.0,,We decided spend our money on a high end drink and nibbles at Spago instead. The views are pretty much the same and it is more pleasant and cheaper to chill out with a ‘Sundowner’ Happy Hour cocktail ( 4p.m to 7p.m Mon to Thurs) than pay the price of a ticket to the Skydeck. Staff are very welcoming and the atmosphere in the bar is relaxed. Highly recommend.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"No matter how many times I saw this hotel, I just had to take another picture of it. It is simply tremendous and a great tribute to its architect Moshe Safdie."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark with its roof deck infinity pool, signature restaurants and shoppes. You can only say, ""Wow! I'm on top of the world!"""
,,Amazing view - high price,3.0,,"Absolutely stunning views but I do think the fee just for the view is slightly exorbitant (SG $23). If I had more time, I would have booked at the restaurant at the top and had a meal/drink whilst taking in the view"
,,Singapore Down Under our Eyes:)),4.0,,"This skypark is a must visit for everyone who is not staying at Marina Bay Sands. To see Singapore at 63rd Level is really delightful to the eyes specially at night. You can purchase light snacks and drinks there and enjoy 360 degree views of Singapore .The Ticket Price is approx 21 SGD per visit.
You can even sneak a view of iconic roof top pool at the same level but cant go there.
A must visit for everyone :))"
,,Amazing Views.,4.0,,"Travelled up to the top with a group tour.A must see and spend some time up there at night.Totally worth it, but not sure id pay the single ticket price of $28."
,,"It is a must, Unique view and something that you will never forget",5.0,,"Don't thing just go as it is one of the most unique views in the world. Only Grand Hayatt Sky view is something similar. Great view, great atmosphere and it is a place that you can have so many photos. Visit the Italian restaurant or the Ce La Vi lounge bar"
,,Fantastic View included with room in the hotel,5.0,,"If you would like to get a great view of Singapore, this is the place to go. Views over Gardens by the Bay and views over the harbour side. Fantastic place to view the giant Ferris Wheel and all the associated light shows."
,,Visit,5.0,,Beautiful skyline from an iconic building with the largest rooftop swimming pool. The views are priceless looking towards the open sea or landward the many tall buildings and Singapore's skyline l
,,Amazing view,4.0,,We went up here in the day and then went for dinner in the evening. Would definitely recommend going up at night. Both are amazing but the lights at night are great. I would recommend doing this over going to bar and paying for drinks vouchers as you don't see as much doing it that way. Worth it. But don't bother with the photo at the start it's S$50 for 1 photo!!
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"don't pay for this, instead go to ce la vie, and have a drink for a few dollars more while taking in the views"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Saw this only from my tour bus, but it was stunning nonetheless. Would have liked to have gone up to the observation level."
,,"We didn't stay, but we looked. Lol.",5.0,,"The price of a room is crazy and the price to get to the top is also crazy but it's worth a little look. Just walk by it, and take a few pictures. Worth the walk from the MRT."
,,Outstanding masterpiece of architecture,5.0,,"This futuristic building is an outstanding masterpiece of architecture (and civil engineering) defying the laws of physics. The view and the pool on the top is just breathtaking... you have to be there once in your life at least. The shopping centre is also impressive and set very high standards, rarely seen in Europe. Even if shopping is not your thing, it is worth a visit."
,,Stunning........worth the effort!,5.0,,"Stunning city views, particularly the night lights! The architecture, Marina Bay / ocean, Gardens by the Bay, buildings around....speak volumes about the pain taken by the planners, builders and the maintainers!

Heartfelt congrats to you people of Singapore!

Slightly disappointed by the face making of the people bringing commerce by the team who takes pics of visitors rather compulsorily before entering the lift and try to convince the tourist to buy the picture morphing the night back ground!

Tip: Try to visit the place not as a part of the tour as you may not like to leave within the time the tour operator fixes for you!"
,,WOW!,5.0,,"The first time I went to Singapore I was thinking what was the building and how can I go on top. And I found out it is a hotel. Then I promised myself that the next I'll set foot in Singapore, I'll make sure I'll stay in that hotel. The experience was wonderful. Worth all the penny spent. View from atop the skypark was just priceless, whether it be day or night. Will be back again, hopefully stay longer next time."
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"An amazing skypark.
You can see everything from up there.
I was speechless when I saw the view.
However, what made me an impression was that they take you a photo when you are at the bottom and as soon as you go on the 56th floor they tell you to buy that one picture. Well, that one picture costs 50 Singapore dollars."
,,Fantastic night views,5.0,,How can you come to Singapore and not take in this opportunity? The views at night from the top are simply spectacular. A must during any visit.
,,Great views,5.0,,"Try and go early or late . No queues but the heat in the middle of the day is something else. Amazing views, well organised and good staff."
,,WOW,5.0,,Great View of Singapore - WOW. Not great if you suffer from vertigo but if you can manage it - Do it. ' Night view is incredible
,,Unrivalled Views,5.0,,"Loved the sky park and it's views so much that my boyfriend and I visited in the day and also at night. It's quite expensive but if you flew with Singapore Airlines you get a 15% discount.
Outstanding views and a lovely breeze. A shame you can't see the infinity pool but that is for hotel guests only."
,,Day in Singapore,4.0,,Skypark is expensive 19.60 dollars each for what is essentially a rapid trip in a lift but has the wow factor when you get to the top with a panoramic view of the city - stunning. Would definitely recommend
,,My God this is great,5.0,,I spotted the skypark from the ground. I fell in love with it... Then I saw it again and again from different angles. Went on the Singapore Flyer and saw it again that was it for me I had to go. What a view. There is a bar up there but just remember once you enter the bar you can not go back on the observation deck so make the most of it. But in the bar you have completely different views and they are also fantastic. Highly recommend.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,A must visit place to get in the sights. Fantastic view and an engineering marvel. Getting through was not too bad. Need to line up though. As with most things. Restricted areas once you get to the top as most of the sections are reserved for hotel guests. Fair enough.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Great place to walk about and chill out with family and friends. Excellent scenery with people of all walks of life just buzzing about their adventure.
,,Lovely place to check in,5.0,,We visited last week and we checked in at one of their deluxe room and we were surprised its having more amenities and exteriors that what was expected. Truly cozy comfortable and spacious. Infinity pool was a sight to behold but was less enticed to swim because of humongous crowd dipping on it.
,,Not worth your time and money,1.0,,"You can just go to Ce La Vi and pay for drinks/meals,enjoy the view and see the pool because going to the skypark is just paying an entrance of $23 and then leaving shortly after"
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The observation deck is a must-go spot to enjoy the whole view of Singapore. It was incredible at night when all the lights were on, plus the light shows. Check the time of the light shows so you won't miss them!"
,,Good view of city,3.0,,From memory this cost around $20 each to go up. You got a good view of the city although not much shelter up there so if you go take a hat.
,,Absolutely Amazing -- Not to be missed!,4.0,,"Wonderful panoramic city views: the architecture, Marina Bay / ocean, Gardens by the Bay, and evening light and water show. This is a great photo opportunity! And, if staying at the hotel it's complimentary."
,,Teriffic views from the skypark,4.0,,"The skypark is located on the terrace on one side of the Hotel Marina Bay Sands, where as the other side has swimming pool which is exclusively for hotel guests. From the top, it offers terrific views of gradens by the bay, Singapore flyer, Singapore skyline, etc. As the attraction is pricey, it is better to go on Singapore flyer where you get the same views if not better"
,,Great views but very expensive,4.0,,"Went here with the family when we went out for m brothers wedding and it cost us a lot of money and it only consists of the observation deck. The view though was amazing you can see all around the marina bay area and beyond.

All the formula 1 track the domes of gardens by the bay and the mass of container ships waiting to dock at the port, all with the misty haze of the humid climate and smogg from the pollution of industry. A real modern capital city view but always changing and developing with the growth of Asia."
,,The Biggest central attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore can rightly be called as the city of modern skyscraper - architecture.
Among the best is the Marina Bay Stands Skypark. It is an all-inclusive centre consisting of casinos, swimming pools , high standard world class suites many many restaurants ,arts and science museum a big shopping centre and a grand 360 degree view of the city, spectacular laser and water show and what not. it can be reached from the famous Garden Bay through a briddge across a busy road.The three-in-one towers has atop, a 4000 people capacity skypark, the world's biggest cantilever construction. An engineering marvel par excellence. visited in April 2017 along with my brother's family"
,,Must visit attraction in Singapore.,4.0,,"For those who have visited the Eden Project in the UK, This is a must visit attraction. The displays are wonderful and the orchid displays in particular are amazing.

I round recommend a visit late in the day and try and combine it with the light show at 745 or 845."
,,pricey,4.0,,get teh view for free if u have aroom (not cheap) or eat at the restaurant $20 tickets online to jujst visi8t teh pool but no swimming bascially just for the view i woudlnt unless a friend is staying or at teh restaurant
,,Get Cé La Vie ticket instead,4.0,,"1/5 for the Sky Deck
5/5 for Cé La Vie

I visited hoping to have drinks and lunch at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. I got the Sky Park ticket ($23) which only lets you into the observation deck. On arrival to the deck I realised you cannot access the bar or restaurant and you have to do this separately. However entry for Cé La Vie costs $20 and you get a voucher for the same value to take off your food and drink bill. So much better value and you get the added enjoyment of a cocktail whilst taking in the views!"
,,Iconic,5.0,,It's real iconic. I loved the light show in the evening while doing the cruise. Beautifully done and what an experience. It's such an iconic place to see.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"The hotel is a visual statement which we first observed from our plane, quite stunning, so we were keen to visit.
We went at night to the top level for a drink and to see the infinity pool. The pool is open to hotel guests only and was very busy but gave a wonderful view over the city. The bar area was well set out and had excellent staff. The view for us was over the pool area and we also went to the opposite side and saw the Gardens by the Sea. You travel up one set of lifts to the highest floor and then walk to the second set which take you to the top.
The hotel was extremely busy and downstairs was spacious.
We did not stay here but for a special occasion or treat, it might just be the place, otherwise would recommend a drink at the top just for the view."
,,Fascinating,3.0,,Loved coming the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Bring your wallet but it's worth the visit. How many times are you going be in this neck of the woods? Love Singapore.
,,Fantastic Hotel As We Thought!,5.0,,"There is not so much to write about this hotel, since this is one of the best hotels in Singapore and has everything that we thought this hotel would have. It's a great hotel, great location,and has easy access to the MRT station within it's complex . The club rooms were quite spacious with awesome city/bay views, the beds were also very comfy. The pool was the best part of the the hotel since it had great views and was very fun to swim in. They could improve the club lounge by having more food/drink options for the guests. Our daughter loved the complimentary Ice cream that was served in the the queue for checkin. Overall we had a great time and would love to come back soon."
,,Hotel with a boat viewing platform,4.0,,"The hotel is visible from all over Singapore and, impressive as it is, it gets more so the closer you get. The rather odd boat at the top is a restaurant, immediately below which is the viewing deck. With no shelter, it's particularly hot on the wooden platform and bright too so sun glasses are a must. The views all over the city are stunning with information posts telling you what you are seeing. It's around $23 to go up but probably worth it."
,,Great scenery,2.0,,Feeling amazing to look Singapore panoramic view from here. But for me it was overpriced scenery and they asked $65 for both photos that we took. It was weird when the ticket was only $23 though. I did not have a lot of time to stay. It was raining when I went to the deck.
,,Dinner at Se La Vi restaurant,5.0,,"The view from this location is breathtaking, giving you a virtual 360degree view of Singapore city. Highly recommended!"
,,"Good view, over rated",3.0,,We considered booking a room at the hotel and are so glad we did not. Going up to the roof top bar was fun and interesting but seeing the crowds and the huge line of people trying to line up to go for a swim made me so glad we only went for a drink and a look.
,,New icon,4.0,,Marina bay sands hotel is a new icon of singapore and the skypark is the most famous attraction of hotel! The light show happens here and obviously you can look down the bay.
,,Everywhere you go- you see is MBS!!,4.0,,"So this architectural masterpiece is the structure which you cross everyday no matter where you go! It is huge, it is beautiful and has the World's longest Overhang Deck. It is worth a visit to the Skypark on the 56th floor of the building. One can get a complete view of the city and the harbor. There is a small cafe which serves hot and cold drinks along with light snacks."
,,Great experience,5.0,,Loved the place. Went by Ce La Vi. The view was magnificent and you can grab some drinks to relax. I loved the Strait Sunrise cocktail (on the sweet side if you love sweet cocktails). All in all great experience. The pool is however off limits to visitors (just for hotel guests). Pass by when you're in town.
,,Fantastic View!,4.0,,Nice to have a chance to view the city when u can't stay at MBS! Go evening to enjoy the turn the day view n night view! Lovely!
,,Superb views at night,5.0,,We watched the Trees show in the Gardens and then the light display in the bay from the sky lounge. Fantastic. Downside is harassment for photos which are expensive but they will barter a deal if you try.
,,Very exposed and hot,3.0,,"Great views, undeniably, but the viewing area is open to the elements and we wilted under the fierce sun. Given the steep ticket prices, overall probably not worth it."
,,Very good place to see around,5.0,,"best place to see Singapore from a height. it is very high. you can see Singapore port, flyer and gardens by the bay. very attractive. very interesting. a must see."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"As residents in the hotel we had unlimited access to the sky park. Visitors can only access the observation deck.
The sky park has restaurants a bar and fantastic views of the city and business sector.
F1 track is below the hotel and the pool is amazing. There are plenty of beds. Access to towels. Lifeguards on duty.
The pool has an adult only section and is busier in the mornings and evenings. The atmosphere changes throughout the day"
,,Roof top garden with restaurant & pool,4.0,,"The sky garden on top of MBS 57 floor has good view of Singapore city, garden by the bay and Marina Bay. Of course don't forget of the Infinity pool and the many celebrity restaurants of world class standard with high dollars tag. The infinity pool which attracts many guests to take selfie or wefie in the pool and background of city view whether in the day, night or early morning."
,,High!,4.0,,A bit expensive but worth the views. Also worthy of acknowledgement of engineering feat. Great sunrise/sunset opportunities especially if you can afford the restaurant/pool.
,,Expensive,4.0,,Was great to walk around but shopping is very expensive inside. Has a lot of places to eat around. Lots to see inside such as all major brands
,,The sands!!,5.0,,"We booked a hotel room, so you have access to the skypark aswell.

Cool and clear view over Singapore, the harbour, city and strait of Malacca? If i m correct.

Not very busy. On the side if balkony there is a map which explains what you see"
,,Simply a must-see,5.0,,"We spent some time on the 56th floor (observation deck). While the 57th floor (the pool) is for hotel guests only, you can look onto the 57th floor from the elevated area of the observation deck. Otherwise, you have a breathtaking, unobstructed view over the city center of Singapore. Have a drink at the Ce La Vie Bar if you have the time. The observation deck is enjoyable and a must-see."
,,Breathtaking but expensive,5.0,,Views are simply superb but at $70 per head is just so expensive. But truly amazing views and still a must do.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Just went for tour around building casino and rooftop bar..very interesting architecture and views a must see in Singapore.
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,"Probably tourist destination number one in Singapore, but for a good reason. Uninterrupted great views of the city and ocean side. Go to Ce La Vie (roof top bar by the 3rd tower) for a drink."
,,Excellent and must visit,5.0,,"One of teh top 5 must visit attractions of Singapore. Provides an amazing view of the city, and of the sea."
,,Worth a visit for the experience,4.0,,"We had seen so many photos of the Skybar we wanted to experience this for ourselves. The area surrounding the hotel is quite busy and chaotic but once we had found how to gain access to the right elevators we were pleased we had
$20 each to go to the Skybar but this could be redeemed against food or drinks
Fantastic views from the top, however quite crowded with the normal self absorbed 'photographers' and tourists who think they have the right to spend hours taking selfies!
We ordered 2 cocktails and a soft drink which meant we paid $5! Seemed good value to us.
Great experience if you don't expect to have exclusive use."
,,Terrific views over Singapore skyline,4.0,,"If you're wanting views over Singapore, then the MBS Skypark is for you. However, if you think access to the skypark will give you access to the infinity pool - it won't! Read more about this on our Singapore page at thewelltravelledman.com"
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Marina bay is a good time spender located in the heart of the city fantastic location with river cruise and buffet
,,Not worth.. too expensive,3.0,,"If you come Singapore, you feel like its a definite place to see the light show from skypark. Yes it is beautiful but nothing so much that needs to pay $23 for each adult. Not worth. Light show is good but same kinda you can see at merlion park free. I personally will not suggest cz of money. If a rich person then go ahead. You will have 1 tick mark in your to do list"
,,lunch at Spago,5.0,,no No don't go to the viewpoint... no go to Spago restaurant at the 57th floor and have lunch or drinks this is THE TIP from me just for you....
,,Great piece of architecture,5.0,,This is one of the world's best piece of architecture. I loved the view from outside as well as the inside.
,,Just a wonderful piece of architecture,5.0,,"Words seem inadequate to describe this building, well worth a visit to the 56th floor as the view amazing"
,,Skypark Ce La Vie restaurant,5.0,,"We purchased tickets to Ce La Vie for $20 each. Had a choice of 3 venues. The restaurant and 2 other bar areas. One beside the pool and one next to the observation deck. Our bill for a burger, squid rings and 2 cokes was $83 but they redeemed cost of tickets so came down to $43. Not cheap but an amazing experience. The Bayfront MRT stop can be accessed from the hotel as well and you can walk over to the Gardens by the Bay which is also a must see."
,,Drinks in the sky,4.0,,"The marina Bay Sands Skypark is a treat, but a bit expensive. The views of the surrounding area give you an excellent idea of Singapore and on a clear day you can see over to Indonesia and other locations.

your elevator admission comes with a drink coupon so in the end it nearly evens out, but for one drink it is worth the trip up."
,,Astounding and iconic !,5.0,,"We went up to the top of this hotel, to the Sky Bar when it was almost sunset. The bar was excellent and views were breath-taking in every direction, especially as the sun went down. Definitely unmissable!"
,,Great views but maybe pay for both!,4.0,,"Not sure if we did the right thing but we paid to go for a drink on the 57th floor which was good but as we arrived 6.30pm most of the best vantage points had gone! So we therefore asked if we could then pay an additional fee to use the observation deck. We were told that we could.....if we went back down to the ground floor to queue up again to get the ticket! Wasn't overly enthused about that idea so tried to makes the best we could.
The best views for selfies and of Singapore are definitely on the observation deck."
,,Observation deck as an non-hotel visitor - good views can't save the experience,2.0,,"Thumbs up: The view really is excellent, particularly around dusk as the city lights up.

Thumbs down: Although the view is incredible, I cannot recommend visiting the observation deck as a tourist not staying at the hotel. The price is not cheap and the whole place is designed to herd visitors through like cattle.

Top tip: If you are planning to do the observations deck, give yourself a few hours beforehand to visit the Gardens by the Bay and then walk across to Marina Bay.

Conclusion: The experience felt like I paid $23 for an elevator ride. It may be said that it is similar to paying to climb the Eiffel Tower of Empire State Building however, having visited both those attractions I can say the experience is just not the same.

The city views are nice, just don't expect much more."
,,Tour of marina bay sands skypark,4.0,,"My husband and I went on a tour of this place, out of our league to stay here. We went to the sight seeing floor. This was pretty amazing,but was so busy on the night we went. It took so long to get to the sight seeing level in the lift.So we had very limited time. short and sweet but fun. Very expensive."
,,Nice,5.0,,This place has some of the best views of the marina Bay Area and it has some good bars and restaurants around.
,,Great hotel,5.0,,Very comfortable hotel with an amazing pool on the roof that makes you feel very relaxed with the music! Hilarious place to watch people posing for photos! The snacks are not as nice as they used to be from the pool bar.
,,Iconic place to visit,5.0,,Another must visit place in singapore. Walking distance to garden by the bay and singapore flyer. Make sure to apply for the membership and it will reduce the ticket prices. Membership is free.
,,Cool!!,5.0,,It is amazing.Yhe view is too good!Everything about it is EPIC!Absolutley a-m-a-z-i-n-g-!-!It is a must go to p lace
,,Great rooftop bar,4.0,,"Sassy roof top bar with great sunset views over Singapore. We went up to the viewing deck and then stayed in for a cocktail in the bar. Busy, lively, mostly for adults but our teenage boys enjoyed it. Great atmosphere. Go here rather than Raffles if you want to treat yourself to a cocktail in Singapore."
,,Iconic,5.0,,"Probably the most inconic hotel in the world right now. Fantastic venue. Go to Ce La Vie. Entrance in Tower 3. $20 each to get up to the top which you are given a receipt for and can be redeemed against food/drink at the top. Fantastic views of the city and yet another ""must do2 whilst in Singapore. If you are lucky enough to stay in the hotel overnight then you get access to the walkway and the infinity pool. Maybe next time....."
,,Wow,5.0,,The views are great but the cheaper way is to go the bar. Only adults pay and you get (almost) 1 cocktail per admission.
,,Views like you have never seen,5.0,,The best location to see the sky line of Singapore and overlook the ocean. Sit quietly and have a beverage and just take in the views. Very friendly staff and reasonable meals.
,,Drinks and view (sort of),4.0,,"If you pay $20 per adult (children are free) you can ride the lift to the top floor bar to take in the view and grab a drink using the $20 entry fee voucher against the cost of the drinks. We arrived around 7pm on Friday evening and the place was really busy. We were warned when we purchased our tickets that it was standing room only but we still wanted to take the view in.

The bigger problem was that only residents can access the full deck area with proper views. So we were left crammed into the bar area fighting for tables with loads of others. You still get a good view but it was a shame we couldn't access the main area as it's very large with loads of space. You cannot really see the pool area from this bar either.

Drinks are around the same price as entry cost."
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"Despite being a massive tourist magnet I expected it to be busier but the bar and viewing area on the back side was surprisingly quiet which was brilliant as it meant there was a lot more space to walk around and find a space to take in the atmosphere and views while taking some uninterrupted photos of the SG skyline in the evening. Have to say the drinks prices made me want to jump over the edge but I guess that's just because it's Singapore prices for a high end bar (unlike happy hour in the local pub back in U.K.)
Overall really enjoyed going up!"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,A unique building and unique experience if you get the opportunity to swim. Plenty option for food and beverage. Great service. It's important to sit and relax at the top.
,,Enjoyed my first signapore sling,4.0,,What a highlight to visit here. Great to share with friends and create lovely memories. Drinks are expensive and served with a little too much ice
,,Great View,3.0,,"Amazing views from the top. Found the bar and pool area a little bit overrated, spent a small fortune on 2 drinks. The pool had about 100+ people in it. Didn't look nice at all"
,,Amazing view with a price,4.0,,"Can not fault the view, it was spectacular and someone who hates heights I felt secure. Was pretty unhappy with price of drinks, which even though all of Singapore alcohol is expensive, the Skybar took this to a whole new level."
,,Viewing Singapore from Above,4.0,,"From the Sands Skypark, you can see all of Singapore from above. If you don't want to endure the Singapore heat at daytime, I would suggest going in the evening because it's cooler and you can still see pretty far away. It's a relaxing place with an extensive view.

Unfortunately there's no discount for locals. SGD 23"
,,Fabulous views from observation deck,5.0,,Beautiful hotel. You must go up to the observation deck as if offers amazing views of Financial district and Merlion as well as the Singapore Flyer (like the London Eye).
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This is a must for the ""bird's eye view of the city"" lovers. The speed of elevator is worth to note. The views are splendid. Strongly recommended!"
,,"Great view, expensive drinks, worth the visit",4.0,,"The view from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is amazing and I would go as far as saying it's a mandatory stop for tourists. Be aware that the drinks are expensive and not that great. Also, the infinity pool is only accessible for hotel guest."
,,Not worth the price.,2.0,,You can only see a small part of the skypark. Most of it is blocked off for patrons of marina bay hotel with pool and bar that you can only see from afar.
,,I'm the dummy,3.0,,"Hated it. Hated every minute of it.

That said, I have mild vertigo so I'm the dummy and freely accept that.

Most people enjoyed it but please note the pool is not accessible unless you're a guest and can get the the very top floor.

The view is astonishing 360 from the city to harbour and surrounding islands.

Ok, I was impressed. Just a little freaked out."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Yes, the views are great from here but u also get great views from the restaurant in Gardens by the Bay. This is overpriced and overbooked . Would not go back. If you are not a guest you cannot see the pool"
,,Holiday,5.0,,The huge hotel and very complete facilities. There are many nice restaurAnt in the hotel that you can choose for breakfast. Spectacular pool and amazing. Also huge shopping mall that you can enjoy it
,,Sky high bar,5.0,,Sky high bar with views all over Singapore. Have a drink up in the clouds almost while enjoying the view
,,Awesome Hotel,5.0,,"Its an awesome place to live. The hotel have infinity pool, bar lounge and excellent ambience. Its having around 57 floors with 6-7 super fast lift which can take you from floor 0-57 in around 35 Seconds. Excellent view from the roof top called Deck."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The view from the top is simply breathtaking. There is a really nice atmosphere here too and nice drinks. However, it is extremely expensive for a drink so bear that in mind. Overall, it was the perfect place to go for a Saturday evening drink."
,,Mandatory Stop for Tourists,5.0,,Visited with some overseas colleagues. Excellent night view. It is definitely a must see if you are in Singapore.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We went to the sky park after seeing it on a TV programme. The view from the top was spectacular. We were lucky it was a lovely clear day.
,,Views to die for,5.0,,"Wow, this hotel is amazing, in terms of architecture and is a landmark of Singapore. The sky park observation deck is free fir guests but tourists pay, there are however concessions if you a kris flyer card or SIA boarding pass.
The view is fantastic as you see all the main attractions from there and the city. There is a bar which you can enter calked Ce La Vi, however, once you enter you cannot access the sky park observation deck. You can also see the infinity pool but this only accessible for guests of the hotel."
,,Great view of City,4.0,,"Great experience before sunset lot of ignorant Chinese just barge through you .. Suppose it's that busy back home they know no better, manners cost nothing"
,,A must see attraction,5.0,,"One must visit Marina Bay to see this incredible piece of engineering and architecture. The structure is spectacular , beautiful and a building not to miss. The entire area around this hotel has enough attractions to keep you occupied for hours"
,,Family vacca,5.0,,"Beautiful view, you must see!!!! The entrance to sky park is not free for visitor but free for Marina Bay hotel guest. Fee about S$30"
,,An Amazing Spectacular Edifice,5.0,,"This is by far the most exciting and interesting simply wonderful attraction don't miss it, an y visit to Singapore must include the Marina bay Sands particularly the Skypark"
,,Singapore Main landmark,5.0,,"Nobody can miss it if you are visiting Singapore,a great landmark which is unforgettable. please visit in the evening time to witness the laser show,and enjoyed the lighting all around. If possible have a boat ride. You will love to spend your best time here and observing the Merloin."
,,Great view of the Singapore skyline,3.0,,"You get a great view of the Singapore skyline from the sky park, but be warned this is very busy. And the area allocated to the sky park is very small. If you want to have a drink in the bar you then can't re-enter the sky park. We went at sunset which was stunning, you get a great view of the skyline and the gardens by the bay and the sea. Overall a good experience but be prepared for the queue to leave and for it to be busy. It's quite expensive for the small space."
,,One of the 3 nicest buildings in Singapore,5.0,,"This is of course a must see. Maybe a first time during the day and certainly at night because every night, you get a light and sound show which can be best seen from the other side of the lake. Shows are at 8 pm and 9:30pm.
Friday and Saturday, there is an extra show at 11 pm.
After the show, I suggest you to make a left. You'll see the Merlion = Singapore's symbol. Then continue along the lake. You'll pass a nice bridge. Once on the other bank, make a left to visit Gardens by the Bay. I think the best time to visit is at night because there is another light and sound show at 7:45 and 8:45.
If you combine these 2 shows, you will for sure, have a great evening"
,,Skypark with 3 kids,3.0,,"First of all the view is amazing and I have seen so many cargo ships in a bay at the same time. This is something that you must do in order to get the best views of Singapore. There were no queues when we went and so it was quick to go up, we just turned up and paid on the day. I'm only giving it 3 star as there isn't much up there. You only get to walk on the tip of one end of the boat. There is a snack area where you can get slouch and drinks for the kids plus toilets. It is a sun trap with little shade so be prepared."
,,Amazing Focal Feature,5.0,,"We had seen a programme on the making of the Marina Bay Sands skypark. What an engineering feat. Fabulous for photos at any time of the day. Great choices of food were on offer as part of the cuisine on offer round Singapore. Everything was huge- like the pots for the plants. This place is definitely worth a visit, even if you are just going to casually drop it in to the conversation to say you have been there."
,,"Very hot, very touristy, very crowded.",1.0,,"Really not worth the effort. nothing amazing. just a tourist trap type spot. Overall, try to stay from MBS."
,,Visit to Family Staying at Hotel,5.0,,Took to the 57th floor to view the famous Infinity Swimming Pool. Not guests so took the opp ortunity to have a drink in the Pool Bar. Fantastic views of pool and of the harbour. The hotel as advertised world wide is a masterpiece of construction and architectural design. Would certainly recommend a visit purely to say that you have.
,,Great view but,3.0,,"Yes it is a great view, agreed but a) expensive, b) cramped c) must have gone on a bad day as found the Bar Service basically no existent and at these prices not what I would expect. tourist rip off. But we are all different thank heavens"
,,wow!,5.0,,This place is everything you would want it to be. We stayed in a junior suite and my goodness it was absolutely amazing. We drank champagne and looked out over the botanical gardens. The infinity pool is as spectacular as you would imagine.
,,Mind blowing view.,4.0,,Especially during the evening the view was just magnificent! It's worth going at least once. The only con was cant access the area even near the pool.
,,Excellent view,5.0,,See the Singapore skyline from top... breathtaking view... can enjoy quick bites in the restaurant on the top.
,,Nice view from the top,4.0,,If you wish to see most of Singapore from a height then this is for you. Most cities have something like this but note that you cannot visit the pool as this is for guests only.
,,Gorgeous at Sunset,5.0,,"Stunning, especially at sunset. Watch the light show at Gardens by the Bay then the Laser show at Marina Bay Sands. The views of city are spectacular. A must see!"
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,You have you to go and enjoy the views. Better if you go to the bar (for free) and then have almost same views but having a drink or dinner. Once you are at the bar you are not allowed to go to the terrace views.
,,"Nice view of the city, Gardens by the Bay and the sea.",5.0,,"If first time in Singapore, go and see! An expensive (but still worth it) view from the observation deck at Marina Bay Sands, bring Singapore Airline boarding pass/ticket for discount."
,,A must visit location,5.0,,There is no better view of Singapore than from the Skypark. The view of the Gardens by the Bay is phenomenal. Marina Bay looks great from up there and the Merlion looks tiny. We stayed for some drinks and food at the bar. Great service and decent food but way over priced.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,If you are going to Singapore then Marina Bay Sands Skypark is must visit place. Best time is go there just before sunset and remain there till dark. You will enjoy sunset and night view of buildings from roof. 8 pm and 9 pm is laser light show.
,,Very nice,5.0,,"What an amazing and beautiful buildings, when you reach the 56 floor and you look around the amazing building in Singapore you feel well relaxed"
,,Bar with a view,5.0,,We went to the top floor of MBS for drinks at sunset. Fantastic experience and incredible views. Drinks are expensive but you pay $20SD voucher pp and can take this off your bill so you therefore dont pay for entry. If your not staying at MBS this is a must.
,,Just wanted to go to MBS and see the view,4.0,,The main reason for going here was for the view. We were close by at Gardens by the Bay and decided to check out the view from MBS. If you flew to Singapore using Singapore airlines bring your boarding passes for a discount. It's a great view but we didn't stay long.
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,Great place to see the whole city from up. Nice at sunset. There is also a restaurant at the top where you can eat a snack or have a drink.
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,The view can be hampered by the humidity but getting there early ensures you miss the hoards and queues. You also miss going up to the restaurant on the upper floor. It doesn't open until 12 midday. You get great views of Singapore on a clear day and amazing to see the volume of ships in the harbour.
,,A must go place to enjoy,4.0,,"I've stayed there with my family, one night only. But I had enjoyed. Infinity pool especially. Very good to see Singapore city from a pool at the top of hotel. A lot of place to go around, shopping malls, garden by the bay, etc. Great place to stay."
,,A must see,5.0,,"While the food options by the pool are limited, they were still ok in terms of taste. But you go there to enjoy the pool with the view, not for the food. And if you are in Singapore, this is simply one of the must-dos!"
,,Top of the world!,5.0,,The feeling that you get when you get out of the elevator on the 57th floor is really unique. You gaze at Singapore by night that lies spectacular and illuminated in front of you and you feel that you are on the top of the world...An unforgettable experience!
,,"Fantastic views, perhaps not for everyone",4.0,,"The skypark is the 57'th floor ""boat deck"", more specifically the front of it. The elevators going up and down are very fast and smooth. I'm not scared of heights in general, but this got to me more than I thought - perhaps a combination of being out in the open air, and that the house moves a little (which it should, but still). The view is spectacular, and if you're not too scared of heights I would recommend this as a stop on your tour of Singapore."
,,Skypark,4.0,,Good place to visit. expensive but awesome view. drinks are very expensive but bar food is reasonable.
,,Nice view,4.0,,It's high and the is a snack bar. Views are fantastic and you can use the restaurant unlike what you are told. A must if your here.
,,A must-see view-point,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is the ""boat"" on top of the three towers of Marina Bay Sands. It features a bar built on the roof, and the famous infinity pool. This is a must-see for Singapore first-timers, and it does offer a fantastic view of Singapore, the Marina Bay and the areas around."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We did this on our first day in Singapore to get a view of the whole city. Great views and not too busy.
,,nice,4.0,,a view from the 57 store must be amazing. but you have to look at the sky before climbing to see the view/ if it is hazy or rainning dont go. when we arrived the sky were clear. it was very hot and no shade around. suddenly it started to rain.....
,,Lunch time was quiet,5.0,,We went at lunch time and there was no queue at all. It is something not to be missed if you visit Singapore as you get great views of the key places to visit.
,,great bar at the top!,5.0,,"I did not stay in the hotel, I just went to the top floor to have a beer and enjoy the views. It is definitely worth going, the views are breathtaking"
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,"Was free to get up here if you were dining. We thought it was worth it so we treated ourselves to a fabulous lunch.
Cocktails were amazing and food was mouth watering.
Views were beautiful and was an awesome way to see the city.
We were advised to either go up here or go on the singapore flyer. So glad we choose this.
It is a must visit if you go to singapore."
,,Amazing vidw,5.0,,"Just to walk inside the lobby and go up to the sky park is amazing, the view up there is amazing, my suggestion is that you go there at sunset, stay and watch the lights take over the city. It's calm, it's peaceful, it's amazing!"
,,Beautiful View of Singapore City,5.0,,"You might come across more details about its infinity pool, but don't be fooled as the pools are only for hotel guests. But if you're just looking to chill and take some breathtaking instagram-worthy photos, then this is the place for you.

Quite breezy and cooling despite Singapore's hot and humid weather. But still it's not a good idea to be there between 11am-1pm as the sun can be quite glaring."
,,Wasting money,3.0,,I don't think it's a good idea to go to Marina Bay Sands Skypark because the weather is super hot and there's no place to hide from the sun. Totally wasting money.
,,Wonderful views of city,4.0,,"Took us a bit to find where to get tickets, thought it was a bit expensive but something you must do once. Great views of the city . Not as big an area as I thought it might be so was glad there weren't many people when we went later in the day. I enjoyed the view of the building from the ground more than the view from the top"
,,Must see view.,4.0,,"It has to be said it's not cheap about $23 per person to access the skypark and I was not sure it would be worth the money , however the view is stunning. You can get 15% discount on tickets if you have flown in Singapore airlines. Just keep your boarding pass or online flight details. Singapore is expensive everywhere and in the scheme of things I would have regretted not seeing this view."
,,Business Conference,5.0,,"Amazing place. Very nice ambience. Very well connected to the metro station. Pretty spacious for business meetings and conferences. Have lots of shopping options nearby. Water laser show in the night is amazing. Highly recommended, both for visitors and business professionals."
,,Amazing view - bar not so good,4.0,,"The view was fabulous and worth the money. Tip - if you fly Singapore Airlines, keep your boarding pass as it gets you discounts here and in other places.
The bar was a different story. Yes it's a bar with a view but $10 for a small bowl of luke warm chips was a bit much. Then as we were relaxing and taking in the view they started moving the furniture around us setting up for the evening - very annoying. Service was not great and food took a long time to arrive seeing it was only snacks."
,,Spectacular views of the city,4.0,,"Ok it’s (too) busy and maybe a bit too expensive but you get stunning views of the city, the marina and the harbor of Singapore. As this is a major tourist attraction it’s run commercially and they want to make money out of your visit as much as possible. No escaping the pictures upon entering the observation deck. They are pricey but hey, we did buy them anyway. Because they are well made. And those who really want to enjoy the most amazing views from the infinity pool should book a room at the hotel, because – and this is a good policy by the hotel – only guest get pool access."
,,Awesome hotel but finer to look at on the ground level,4.0,,"We bought ticket to just the viewpoint as well as the bar which is next to the pool. At the entrance you will get a drink ticket for a drink. Beautiful view but thought it was small area, but it's because the pool takes all the space. It is a must to visit the bar at any time if you are in singapore."
,,Stunning Singapore at Night,5.0,,"We went up to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark after visiting the Gardens by the Bay. It was very interesting to see Singapore from so high up. As it was a clear night, you could see for miles and miles, both out into the bay and over the city. Just Beautiful."
,,Thumbs up,5.0,,"Best view in singapore. Very nice, came highly recommended to go slightly late in the afternoon and wait till early evening so we could appreciate the skyline both in the day and at night. Worth very bit of my money. Mind you, I'm the one paying, not the wife."
,,Great view,5.0,,Fabulous view. It's in the full sun so take a hat. Plenty of room for everyone. Thoroughly enjoyed going here.
,,visit,5.0,,The view from the skylark is fantastic and the light shows you can watch from there are well worth the price of the ticket.
,,Great experience!,5.0,,"Went to visit the SkyPark and SkyBar, and was amazed by the views - you can see so much of Singapore from the place, and it makes for some stunning photography! The SkyBar can be a little pricey, but that's no surprise given the reputation of the place - would recommend going up to see the place and take some great photos, and having a drink while you're there is nice with the rapid service and great range of high quality drinks!"
,,Marina bay sands,5.0,,"A must to go up to the top a night, the view is amazing. We all loved it and the photos are amazing. We went on a night tour through trip advisor it takes you to gardens by the bay the night show, Marina bay sands viewing deck and a river cruise all amazing."
,,Stunning view!,4.0,,Take the time to visit the hotel and certainly take the time to go to the terrace on top. You will not be able to get near to the pool (guests only) but the view is stunning.
,,Breakfast very disappointing,2.0,,Visited this hotel as heard so much about it. Did not stay here and do not doubt rooms are fabulous. We decided to have breakfast here and were very disappointed. Very expensive but assumed the quality and variety would match the price.it didn't. Layout of breakfast area clumsy.
,,Innovative design but feels like Vegas,4.0,,"Made by the owners of various Vegas casinos, this project kinda feels like one too. Very glam and impressive. Good place for a touristy Singapore Sling on the rooftop bar (just to say you did it). The lights show at night kinda underwhelming. I could definitely see why so many people love it but I tend to prefer more boutique and understated."
,,Iconic building,5.0,,"Plenty of photo opportunities in this integrated resort, which also houses a casino. Visit the Art Science museum for beautiful exhibitions, as well as the Sands skypark for a good view of the bay. Don't forget to visit the Louis Vuitton Island Maison, which is one of the largest stores, and the only ""floating"" store in the world, complete with its own yacht deck."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,Love love love the view from the top! Truly an amazing site to see! A great place to relax and enjoy the scenery with a cocktail.
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,"We managed to get to the top floor by camping the elevator as we were not staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel and it was well worth it as you are able to see the whole city from the top floor

Absolutely stunning and must see"
,,OUTSTANDING,5.0,,A phenomenal achievement for Marian Bay Sands Hotel. Views were fantastic .excellent photographic opportunities.
,,Observatory deck seems better,3.0,,"Unless you are making a dinner reservation (which requires min spend of sgd80 pax), this place is not worth it. It is extremely crowded and all the viewpoints are taken by the people with dinner reservations. However, the sgd20 is a cover charge (unlike the observatory) and the food is quite delicious."
,,Must see,3.0,,"We went to see this incredible hotel. After taking the lift to the sky bar and was wowed at the views and experience, we were shocked to have such slow service from
The bar staff. After waiting 20 mins for our order which included 5 Coca Cola we were told they didn't have any. Really? Oh then he finds some but says there will be no more if we order second round of drinks. The barman was truly rude and spoilt the name and reputation of this place.

However we changed our order and after had a look round this hotel which is almost a resort inside itself. Very popular amongst Asian visitors. I'm glad I've seen it but would have no interest in staying there. Much prefer something more personal and friendly."
,,Expensive,3.0,,We were there and pretty satisfied. 18 SGD for one adult is not cheap and opportunities when arrived on the skypark are limited.
,,Wow !,5.0,,"What a building, this a place not to be missed day or night it is amazing, it is worth the trip to the top, but expensive to stay"
,,why skypark when you can ce la vi?,5.0,,"we were going to go up to the skypark area but after doing a bit of research found out that if you go to the bar next door you can pay SGD20 to go up but then you have that as a voucher to use for food and drink - so not sure why you wouldn't do that instead?
Yes it's busy and yes it's expensive but as far as bucket list goes - just do it!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,I've wanted to visit the place since it was constructed . An absolutely amazing place. The view from the top is tremendous. Well worth the cost.
,,360 view of Singapore,5.0,,It is an amazing hotel with many shops and a casino at the lower floors. The view from the skypark is breath taking.
,,Amazing view but a little hot,4.0,,This attraction offers one the the best view of Singapore. However is a tad too hot and humid for our family with very little shade provided at the top.
,,Worth the money,5.0,,"We spent a bit of time debating whether to go up here or not but in the end I decided we should and I'm glad we did. We went in the late evening and the views were spectacular. You can buy drinks and snacks up there and get some great photos. They have screens up all around so safety is not an issue. They do take a photo of you before you go up and then you are stopped before you walk out onto the deck to try and sell you the photo, which was $20. It is definitely something to need to see at least once. There is plenty of room for people who don't like heights to stand back against a wall and still get a great view"
,,Skyline of Singapore,5.0,,This is the iconic tower in Singapore with spectacular view. Must visit if you're in Singapore. You can purchase the entry ticket on Tower 3 basement. Cost S$23 per pax adult. The entry to the top is located near the counter. The lift will take you to the 57 th floor in less than minute. Where you can spend time as much as you like till 11 pm. I recommend you to go there during sunset. They've two light show one at 8 pm and 10 pm.
,,"Crowded, good experience",4.0,,"Did not fancy the queue to get to the lift bringing the visitors to the peak. However, got a nice sight seeing, to enjoy SG for the top point of view. SG definitely looks fantastically luminous from the top in the evening."
,,"It's the views, the views!",5.0,,"For some the $23 entry price is a bit steep, but I think it is worth the experience to see Singapore laid out all resplendent. I went up for the night viewing, which I think is a much better investment. It was brilliant to see all the sites lit up, sheer bliss on a warm balmy night. Be warned, the photos they take while you queue up will set you back $50. No obligation to buy of course."
,,Nice view,3.0,,Nice view but needed a clearer day as very cloudy as are most days in Singapore. Ticket prices bit expensive could be reduced.
,,Frying pan in the sky!,2.0,,"$23 to go up 57 floors only to find no shade, no place to sit and $15 drinks. The pool and the restaurant are for hotel guests only. I am 100% certain that the no shade and no place to sit is by design to keep the crowds turning over. Oh yeah, the view is great for about 15 mins. I'd pass..,."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Instead of Singapore Flyer its is worth spending your dollar to go on Top of Marina Bay Sands as it offers great view and you can spend more time. You can also Visit roof top bar and indulge in drinks and enjoy evening Sunset
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,Probably the best view of the bay and the city you can possibly get. Well worth a visit. We went there in the morning when it was not too busy and not too hot.
,,Lunch in the sky,5.0,,"We arrived by hop-on-hop-off bus which stops in the middle of the building. There is a lift to but it only take you so far. With the bus behind you turn left and walk to the end of the building here you will find entry to the shopping area and lifts to the top. Two choices for viewing - the viewing platform or restaurant or bar. As it was hot we chose the bar. Great choice we sat in comfort and sipped cold drinks and snacked from the bar menu. To bar is higher than the platform so you look over peoples heads. We got some amazing photos. There is also a discount on you lift ticket is you drink and eat at the bar. Bonus! Walk up into the restaurant and look over the pool, yes on the roof scary. Must do!"
,,Great location and architect,4.0,,Hotel is situated in the heart of the city.Iconic Hotel is known for its rooftop pool which i guess one of the biggest pool and gives you the panoramaic view of the singapore skyline. It has the observation deck on the edge of the pool from where you can see the beauty of the city specially in the late evening..
,,50/50: You Decide,3.0,,"Even though the views of Singapore are worth it, I am not sure about the S$23. For the price, I recommend just making reservations at CE LA VI, which is one floor higher than the observation deck. After you are done indulging in a meal or drink, just walk around to the lower floor and still be able to take photos."
,,Worth the Wait and the Trek,4.0,,"We thought we would top off our visit to the Gardens by the Bay by crossing over to the seemingly nearby Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Just as the hotel itself is reminiscent, and on the scale of the huge structures of Las Vegas, so was the walk to it. It was that strange feeling like being a Lilliputian in Gulliver’s Travels. You keep walking, but don’t seem to get any closer,because you haven't recognized the scale of your surroundings.

Anyway, it was quite a trek to the hotel, which is not just a hotel, but a resort with a shopping mall as well. We eventually found the location within this giant structure at which we could buy tickets for our elevator ride to the 57th floor SkyPark Observation Deck. We paid our SD23, but then had to wait in line for some time before it was our turn to ride to the top.

The Observation Deck was a busy place with hordes of tourists taking in the 360 degree view, buying snacks or sitting in the bar/restaurant. At the mid-late afternoon time of our visit it was certainly more crowded than we would have liked, but that didn’t detract from the spectacular view over Singapore, the bay and the sea. It was interesting trying to pick out places we had been and identify others. We probably spent an hour up there, and that was enough for us. We didn’t access other parts of the Skydeck with the infinity pool and other bars, restaurants and palm trees. If we’d had more time, it might have been good to include these and make an afternoon/evening of it."
,,Good view,5.0,,"Very nice and windy, can see most Singapore CBD area, perfect during night time. Even u able to see garden by the Bay. What a great place to relaxing"
,,Great views,5.0,,"We opted for MBS Skypark as we we were told SD20 per person to access the bar couldn't guarantee a table with a view. For us this was a good choice, especially with a 15% Singapore Airline discount (just needed to show boarding pass).

Once up there, we were able to stay for as long as we wanted, taking us from day to sunset, and we enjoyed the views during this golden hour.

At this time (7pm-ish) there were no queues for tickets, and the viewing platform wasn't particularly crowded, though by contrast the bar area looked very busy."
,,amazing,5.0,,"Amazing view! Cost $23 though which was the only downfall and you're not up there for very long. No where to sit while you're up there, but amazing way to see Singapore! Highly recommend!"
,,Lovely views of Singapore,5.0,,Went on a clear day and had amazing views of Singapore. Excellent place to take some breathtaking photos of Singapore skyline.
,,Observation Deck,5.0,,Its about S$23 to visit the deck however on a clear day to get to view the whole of Singapore. Worth the money.
,,Great photo stop....but perhaps only 15% open to walk,3.0,,You'll get some great photos here but a little pricey $80 for a family of four and you'll only get to walk around 15% of the total 'boat' you see sitting atop the hotels.. to be very fair they do tell you this in the lobby(we'd hoped to go for a swim in the infinity pool but alas) and you can make a choice but just so all are aware..probably a 25-30min visit for super photos..
,,A must see!,5.0,,Views of Singapore from the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands complex. Most guided tours go here at night to see the lights of Singapore. We went in the afternoon and the scenery was so clear and interesting. On the way in you can have your photo taken and by the time you get to the observation floor it is printed with a night scenery background and a day scene with the Merlion. It will cost you S65 but you will also be able to download digital copies. The views of Singapore are amazing from Skypark.
,,Holiday,5.0,,"Must see is to take lifts to the top for a drink and or meal in the bar. This overlooks the pool area, offers great views. Not cheap but worth it as you can relax whilst enjoying the views"
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,Have stayed many times before at Marina Bay Sands. The Shopping Mall is great and the Singapore Gardens are just beautiful. A great Place to stay in Singapore.
,,Sky Park,4.0,,"Great Photography .
Nice view.
Entrance fee.

Worth the money.

Generally easy to get there by taxi.
Traffic can be bad there.
Check with the driver.

Generally easy to get a taxi afterwards.
After 9pm. Taxi are difficult to get here.
Waiting time for taxi daily after 9pm is 60mins"
,,Dress up be a queen for a day,5.0,,"It is easy to radiate extra super gorgeous feeling when you touch the top floor, be in your best mood this is going to blow you away and you better take it in with your highest good"
,,Amazing way to see the city!,5.0,,"Amazing view! Cost $23 though which was the only downfall and you're not up there for very long. No where to sit while you're up there, but amazing way to see Singapore! Highly recommend!"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"the place is 59th floor of Marina bay hotel, accessible from Tower-3. tickets may be 23 SGD bur singapore airlines passengers get a discount. u can have beautiful views all around and have great photography."
,,Beautiful view of Singapore,5.0,,"A must go to place while in Singapore you can get a great view of the sea and land. It's quite windy so its cool. You can soak in the sea view, the bay below and scenic view."
,,Depends,5.0,,"If you like to see the city from the top then do it, if not then leave it, I went with my friend I enjoyed it but she didn't, it took us 15 to 20 min up there. But my recommendation since you are already there then feel the e experience."
,,Absolutely Fantastic,5.0,,"We had the most amazing lunch at Spago! The adult beverages were wonderful and the food was amazing. We enjoyed the view of the infinity pool, gazing at the marina, and skyline of Singapore."
,,"Great location, GREAT Hotel too!",5.0,,"I`ve been here three times and continuing, it is an amazing place to visit and I get amazed and breath taken each time I`m here.

The Marina Bay Sands alone is quite stunning to view, outside and inside. Haven`t been to the top as my friend does not like tourist crowds, and there are quite many up there. The bridge to the Gardens and the attached Mall are one of the most beautiful attractions and Malls I have even been to. Only the Venecian style Canale Grande they should have left away, it seems too tacky and not worth it, you´d look like you are on a plate in a restaurant while going along the small and narrow waterway. Like in Las Vegas also here, it is not necessary at all. Better go see the real thing in Italy!"
,,Architectural Wonder,5.0,,An iconic structure that represents Singapore. One of its kind in the world.Kudos to the people who manages to put a big boat on top of a magnificent building.Bird's eye view of the city. Must visit.
,,Fantastic fountain/laser show,4.0,,"A-must-see thing when going to singapore.
The fountain/laser show is worth to wait, and it's free!
You would be amazed with the breathtaking city view.
No wonder most of singaporeans seem a bit snob and arrogant. They almost got what it takes to make them feel like owning the world."
,,See Singapore from the heights of the viewing deck,4.0,,"Take the express lift to the 52nd floor and enjoy great views across both harbour, gardens and the city"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Amazing views from the 57th floor of the Marina bay sands hotel . Well worth the $20 dollar entrance charge as you can redeem that against food or beverages to enjoy while taking in the view . Highly recommend as you can see all over the city .
,,Don't,1.0,,Crowded and complicated to get entry. Generally a throng of people trying to get the perfect selfie from the infinity pool. It may be the perfect singapore photo but is also one of the least fun things in singapore
,,A must,5.0,,A special place with great views. The pool is split between adults only and children. Great food and drinks but the amount of people with selfi sticks is weird.
,,"Go to Ce La Vis bar for free, rather than pay for skypark",5.0,,"Instead of paying the prices for the skypark where your access is limited, go to Ce La Vis bar on the 57th floor in tower 3 for free (beside the infinity pool) and for the price of your skypark ticket you can get a couple of cocktails and seats overlooking the bay. Fantastic all round!"
,,Go to the top - great view,4.0,,"I'm told you once had to pay USD20 to go to the ship-shaped restaurant on top, but not anymore. Worth the trip to have an excellent lunch and see Singapore from 57 fllors high. It's pricey (SGD18 for french fries) so you might want to order something to share."
,,Fantastic views!,5.0,,"This is a must-do in Singapore, though it is not free. There is a fee. I think it was $S18. You do get a sense of where everything is. Something cool about seeing the domes and SuperGrove from the top of them. We were told that it was possible to pay the fee to swim in the Infinity pool, but they make it clear that that is only for guests. You will see it from the side and grovel over how nice it must be to be in that pool, especially on a hot day."
,,Overlooking the whole city.,5.0,,We went there at noon since we do not really have time to visit it during the night but it was still worth it even if it was hot. TIP: It's much better to see it at night time.
,,Fast efficient service. Highly recommended for allergy sufferers,5.0,,"I am allergic to wool and feather bedding, and I needed a different configuration. On check in and every time I walked past the lobby, there was huge traffic, and I did not expect to be served quickly. But when I called for anti-allergenic bedding, two staff came up within a minute. And I was able to have very good sleep for the rest of my stay."
,,A must visit during your stay in Singapore,5.0,,"Without a question the most wonderful view of the city skyline is enjoyed from this location, especially when the sun is setting!!"
,,A must see! Great experience,5.0,,"This is the views that you need to enjoy in singapore! Luxury at its finest. Prices on drinks are up there, but you get what you pay for..that view!"
,,Tourist / Holidays,5.0,,Wow! Wow! The access to the Bar area and 56 / 57 floor was $23 per adult. It didn't give access to the Pool area though. The views from the access area give a broad expansive view of the Singapore DownTown location. Worth a look!
,,Amazing,5.0,,"After the mandatory queue and photo, it was a quick trip to amazing. We went about 6pm to get a good spot. Gets very crowded for dark. That way got to see day view and night view. Watching things change as the sun set was great. A picnic dinner at the 56 th floor was a definite to do experience in Singapore. Great view of the light show at the gardens and the laser lights on the water in front of the convention centre. Well worth entry. Amazing perspective on a stunning city at night.
View of marina bay sands dominates the view from many vantage points along the river. It's size is breathtaking.
Be prepared for a wait in the queues for going up and down. Staff worked well to keep people flowing but only 2 lifts.
Don't miss this one on your trip to Singapore."
,,what a view!,5.0,,The only place to view Singapore at a night - a 360 degree view from the clouds - the elongated oval gives a great perspective of the size of other structures in view and bay
,,Excellent view of the city by the bay,5.0,,It is highly recommended to also get yourself a drink at the sky lounge and immerse yourself in the beautiful view of the city and the sea.
,,A very intersting work of art,5.0,,This hotel is absolutely amazing and provides splendid aerial views of Singapore where you a]can enjoy a drink on the roof terrace. the design is truly amazing ad looks like a ship that has run aground between two towers in the air
,,Sunset is the time to go,4.0,,"Enjoying a mojito at the rooftop bar was great! Even on a cloudy day it was a great way to see and appreciate Singapore city and Harbour. There are strict rules about leaving the observation deck once you are in the bar. Plenty of people around at this time of day with the same idea when the city lights begin to come on.
Posing for the official souvenir photo in the green screen before the lift is a good way insuring you get an awesome photo as it's hard to replicate the angle. We didn't because ours was a day time visit and not sure on price but can now see the value."
,,not as expected and anticipated,3.0,,"Went there in the afternoon - may be could have been better if i had visited in the evening or at sunset.
It looked fascinating until i visited it.

It ends as soon as it starts. Was expected a bigger area to stroll and get the views but you just get access to less than 1/4 of the total area - The remaining area is for hotel guests and pool. So you do not get the 360 view from the top and just partial view over looking gardens by the bay, singapore flyer and some part of singapore river and ships docked at the sea.

Its ok just to visit and tick that to do / must visit list.
You can get better views and similar height from singapore flyer just a few meters away or as i was told later, get the entry cover for the sky bar and sip the drink while having a proper seat at the bar."
,,JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD,5.0,,"I visited my niece who was staying on 43rd floor in a suite. The view was superb, the room facilities and amenities were also of high standards"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"This is the best place for an amazing view. We had a drink in the bar, which was a little pricey but worth it for the view."
,,Worth it for the view.,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a must do in Singapore. You'll get unparalleled views of the Harbour and surrounds- the sea, the port, gardens by the bay, the central business district, the suburbs.

I highly recommend you time your trip to be at the Skypark at sunset. That's when you get majestic skies and the city lights twinkle and awaken. If you wait even longer, you'll get a light show on the Harbour (but I disappeared before then to grab a bit to eat).

The Skypark itself runs like a machine. It costs about $26SGD per person to get to the top, and you'll find it can get very crowded up there. There are trinkets and food/drinks available up there but if you don't want to be hit by tourist prices for a meager hot dog, then eat before you go.

There's always the option of having dinner up there, but reserve a place as I don't think they take walk ins and it gets filled pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to be anywhere near the famed infinity pool. Lastly, the queues to leave are long and windy as there are only 2 lifts available up to the SkyPark, so leave yourself a loose schedule because you could be waiting a while to get down.

All in all, the experience is worth it. The panoramic views are breathtaking and the rest of the experience is just incidental."
,,Must see!,4.0,,All i can say is amazing top view of the city of Singapore! Wow! We paid for 23$ but we cant access to bar at 57th floor. So after 15mins of excitement about the view then nothing else to do there because we cant order drinks or food in the restaurant even we want to stay abit longer.
,,Amazing,5.0,,We went up to MBS Skypark from our hotel room. The view is breath taking. We enjoyed looking at the amazing view of Singapore City. It is indeed spectacular to see it from the rooftop. We will surely recommend this place to.our friends. 👍👍👍
,,"""Top of the World""",5.0,,"Great arrangement to catch an aerial view of Singapore, zooming into Marina Bay area and neighborhood. Professional arrangements of ticketing, photo-shoot (which you can optionally buy as you reach the Skypark), swift elevator ride to L56 skypark, and then finally the open terrace area for the view.........overall a great experience. There's a souvenir shop which also sells refreshments. Recommended for those who have not visited yet!!"
,,An Absolute Must,5.0,,"-instead of going to the sky park, go to the bar, it cost SGD 20 and you get it back in a voucher at the bar for food or beverages, but you basically will only get 1 beer for that price.
-the bar is slightly higher than the viewing deck.
-try to go there in the evening to catch the Marina Bay Light show from the top, a totally different view and you will see the laser light show which is not visible from the bottom.
-you will also have a view of the rim pool which is not available from the sky park, but this is only for residents use not visitors to the bar.
-if you go during the day find out if you can use the same ticket to return in the evening to catch the light show."
,,Skyview of Marina Bay,4.0,,"This is a must see attraction though a bit overrated.

This attraction is located at the 54th floor of Marina Bay Sands. It is overlooking over Marina Bay.

There is nothing much up except for the view & of course dining & wining. Other than that, nothing special."
,,Fabulous cocktails with a view to match!,5.0,,We paid $20 to ride up to the bar and this is redeemable when you purchase a drink at the bar. The cocktails were great and matched the fabulous view!
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"I really like the city view from top of the sky towers , must watch destination to visit when at Singapore"
,,Awesome,5.0,,What a beauty? Visit at night. A marvolous view of night Singapore. want's to visit again and again.
,,Busy,5.0,,"This is a must visit place in Singapore. Fabulous view from their sky lounge. Swim your way. Though busy hotel, hey that means they are extremely equipped to manage large number of people. I've seen it, it feels like cruise at times hahaha a number of ppl I meant."
,,Beautiful Skyline of Singapore,4.0,,"The Singapore Skyline is beautiful - no doubt about that. However, there are a few choice locations you can view it, from roof tops of skyscrapers like the MBS Skypark, or 1-Altitude, or Level 33, or even the roof top bar at Fullerton Bay hotel... these are all highly recommended vantage points.

However, the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is probably the most famous among the lot, although, not necessarily the best, nor my favourite. That's because, for the price you pay.. you just get access to views, and nothing else. You're not given a choice of drinks, or a cosy, comfortable place to sit and watch the world go by. In fact, it almost feels rushed, with tourists coming up, taking their photos, then leaving...

And besides, Marine Bay Sands is one of the most iconic buildings in Singapore... when you're up at the skypark, you can't possibly take a photo of the building when you're on it! It would make more sense to view it from across one of the buildings on the bay... like Level 33, or 1-Altitude. That way, you get to shoot beautiful pictures of the surrounding skyline AND MBS. Perfect... if you also cradle a glass of Lychee Martini in your hands!"
,,bay view,5.0,,"graet place to visit terrific views right around the bay area,terrific view at night with all the lights in city superb infinity pool 53vf;oors above ground"
,,Amazing ! amazing and amazing,5.0,,It's An Amazing Excellent And Outstanding . Life time once should visit here. Love the night life and night view.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This was an amazing experience. the sky park provided beautiful views, information/learning and great drink options from its café. I was lucky enough to watch the gardens by the bay light show from above which was breath taking. I suggest going a bit before sun down so you can see the natural city and then the night life of Singapore."
,,Incredible Views from the Top,5.0,,Marina Sands Skypark opened last year and it is an incredible structure well worth a trip to the top with views that go on forever.
,,Posh Shopping Mall With A Promenade,4.0,,"It's a good experience to simply sit on the boardwalk facing the water and the city to observe the sun set into the night and, if lucky, watch a scheduled light show on the bay."
,,"Great view, super busy + expensive!",4.0,,Easily the best view in Singapore of the city. The drinks cost about SGD 20(!!) and it's super full up at the top. The service was pretty good - there is a special viewing deck just for hotel guests.
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,"No time limit and excellent experience, staff all very lovely! A must do in Singapore!! Can't wait to return!"
,,Must see!,5.0,,Super awesome place to stay. We had a beautiful view of the gardens below and the rooms were very nice. They provided toiletries that were very quality and the shampoo and shower gel smelled amazing. They pool at the top has the best view in town. Must be a guest at the hotel to get to the pool area though. There is a mall attached to the hotel as well but most if it was luxury brand named merchandise. The staff was very friendly and the concierge were very helpful and helping you find wherever you wanted to go.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,No words to explain about Sky park. Its like as Heaven . one of the Heaven place in this world to propose a love
,,Pretty amazing structure with a casino and other shops,4.0,,"A great stop to have a break from the heat - haha! There's a lot of luxury shops, places to eat and the Casino there too.

You can walk through the 3 buildings on the ground floor, and also visit the top deck boat area if you want to heck out the pool and bar."
,,Supper on the roof,5.0,,This is the perfect place to see the city. The best time to go is sunset when you can see the city and then enjoy the view as the lights all come on. Spectacular
,,Expensive for what you get,3.0,,"To buy tickets you may have walk for over 15 minutes depending on where you are coming from. When you get to the top, you don't get access to the 340-­meter-­long skylark, but instead only to one side of the ""boat"", a very small area that does not give you the 360 degree view."
,,Rip off,1.0,,"You only get to see a small portion of the ""boat"". They want $23 per adult and $17 per child. So it is really not worth it, unless money is no issue. In that case, just stay at the hotel. BTW, this place is owned by the same company that owns the Sands in Las Vegas, so it has that Las Vegas Casino feel to it."
,,Amazing views and worth the time,5.0,,The views from the top are fantastic! We found a way to get to the top without paying $26 bucks each to go the the observation deck. You pay $20 each to go to the adjacent restaurant/bar and you get that back on food and drinks. The ticketing booth is at the end of the ground floor near Tower Three just before you reach the end doors. The views are just as phenomenal. and they have seating and umbrellas. OK the drinks were exorbitant but we had a pleasant couple of hours there before going to the Gardens by the Bay next door.
,,"Facinating architecture, the rest...?",3.0,,"There's no doubt the building is striking. Not everyone's idea of fine, and seemingly plucked from a Japanese anime, the Sands draws the eyes from a distance and from near.
Arriving there, the ambience is an awful like an airline terminal. vast spaces, moving people - all very nice but no character, no soul.
The viewing area on the roof is open to not-guests for a stiff fee, and the views are of course spectacular.
The rooftop swimming pools and restaurants are for guests - they're very grand, quite spectacular but also very open and, for our taste, too much on the bling side of the scale.
Bottom line: nice place to visit, but..."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,Plan your visit to the Skypark to conincide with the Gardens by the Bay Light Show. The view is spectacular. The admission is $20 however this is redeemable for food and drink at the Skybar. Beware the drinks are very expensive $58 for two cocktails however it is worth the experience.
,,Worth Admission Cost,5.0,,Get spectaular views of the city-scape from the top of the Mariona Bay Sands Hotel and Casino. It is open to the public from a fee (about $20).
,,Great and awesome hotel !!,5.0,,"Its just not a hotel, its like a monument and a great world inside and out. Its a greatest experience to climb up to the visitors desk located on the tip of the hotel and watch entire singapore from there its really an awesome feeling"
,,Skypark visit.,5.0,,Went to visit the skypark. We had a great clear day. From the minute you walk out of the lift the view is incredible of the harbour. Great panorama from all directions.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Best viewing platform to see Singapore especially in the evening. Stay as long as you want and enjoy a drink from the Skypark bar. A must visit in Singapore!
,,"Skypark, if not the Hotel !!",5.0,,"the best time to visit is around 7pm. one can enjoy the views of the city and the gardens in daylight and at night !! Dont miss the sky park, if you are not staying at the MBS hotel. Pool is only accessible to the hotel guests !! buy the $S20 ticket and enjoy the breathtaking skyline views of Singapore !!"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The view is spectacular . So glad we came here. All i can say is just come and see it. Picture is not even close to the real one. My daughter and I are very happy that we actually came to see this beautiful view. I am speechless .
,,Unbelievable,4.0,,What an amazing structure - you can be only impressed by this architectural wonder. The views from the top of this structure are just as amazing - a must do.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Definitely view this at night when the gardens of the bay and surrounding buildings are light up. Fantastic sight. It can be very busy and there might be a queue to ride the elevator up but have patience, it's worth it!"
,,Best views in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are not staying at the hotel you can still buy a ticket to the viewing platform at the Marina Bay Sands, it will cost an adult $20 but if you have used a Singapore airline flight and you have the boarding card or can remember your flight number you can receive a $3 saving on each ticket. The view from the top is fantastic day or night, you only get access to one end of the roof as the rest is private gardens and pools for the hotel residents."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Not recommended if you are scared of heights but the views from the 56th floor are awesome. Got some great night time photos of Singapore's skyline.
,,A memory to cherish..,5.0,,"So lovely view Marina Bay, CBD and bayfront and Singapore skylines. Worth visit while u r here . Ticket price is 22$ . Piece of advice - go by the evening before sunset to have amazing view of day and night."
,,"Good view, but expensive",4.0,,"Get a good view over the bay and out to sea, expensive fir what it is but can get discount if you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass. Can get soft drinks and gifts from the small shop there . Not the highest viewing platform in Singapore (1 Altitude)"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark has the best views of Singapore,4.0,,From here you can see the whole of Singapore it seems. The best place to get a 360 degree view of the whole area. There are limits on the parts you can have access to as it part of the hotel complex and some areas are limited to hotel guests. Best idea is to go for lunch or dinner at the restaurant ce la vi and for the $20 tickets you can get a drink and have a nice meal and a great view. My wife and I really enjoyed the lunch and had spectacular view of the whole area.
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,I would recommend the Skypark to everyone. Best views of Singapore. Was similar price as the Singapore Eye with family of 4 but glad we chose the Skypark as you plenty of room to move around once up top to appreciate the views.
,,Must,5.0,,"Take the lift to see a spectacular view of singapore in particular during the sunset . With the ticket of the lift you can enjoy a drink or finger food in the skypark and take a look to the wonderful pool of the hotel .
To be visited !"
,,Beautiful,5.0,,I usually see this view from picture Now...i see the real for the first time So...very happy indeed Must visit for the first time when you come to Singapore
,,Worth the $20 entry fee,4.0,,We tourists paid to have the wonderful experience of a pleasant hour on the rooftop terrace enjoying our drinks (which come out of the entry fee) the swimmers in the pool and the grand views. It was worth it.
,,Sky deck rocks! Feels as if one floats over the edge.,5.0,,Sky deck rocks! Unique spot that is unmatched anywhere! Hyperbole is not out of reach. Architect must have had a great time designing the building.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Although the cost to go up to the 56th floor isn't cheap, the views at the top are stunning. There is no access to the infinity pool but there is a cafe and gift shop."
,,Great views but expensive,3.0,,Took our three kids at night to watch the light show. It was lovely but a very expensive activity and our kids were soon bored. It's a great view of the city.
,,Must place!!,5.0,,"It was extremely great place, a must spot if you visit Singapore. Beautiful view, get a breeze from the sky!"
,,Top of the world,4.0,,"Went to the observation deck one of the nights to see the city and the light show. We got the 106 bus from orchard road and entered via the 3rd tower which is only a few minutes from the bus stop. It cost 23 Singapore dollars (€14.62) each but it was well worth it.
The view is fabulous as you can see the whole bay and a great view of the light show. We had a Singapore sling cocktail which was $14, not bad price considering where we were. The only negative is there is no seats on the observation deck.
Overall a good experience well worth the money."
,,Way too hyped up.,4.0,,"Was told we had to stay at MBS atleast 1 night for the experince which I'm glad we did, but would not return.

For the base deluxe room ($1050 2 nights) thats about all you get.

Admittedly a beautiful venue and with a fantastic view.The pool is nice but is crowded all day and is also very shallow (1.2m) upto my waist when i stand (6ft2ish).

I reccomend doing 1 night and checking in as ealry as possible and checking out at 11am on the dot and make the most of that time."
,,A must see! Great views,5.0,,Another fascinating place to visit if you are in Singapore. Stunning views of the city and just to experience the sheer size and structure of the Marina Bay Sands. A modern day wonder.
,,expensive!!!,5.0,,"you pay for $20+ and you also can't go to the restaurant you should be one of their check-in guest in their hotel they should cut the price no other activities there just sightseeing ahahah but of course you'll definitely love what you see, visit there at sunset so you can see the day time and night time at the area:)"
,,Good,4.0,,Very good place. Clean. Management was good. Nice restaurant. Need to make a shelter there as it is very sunny
,,Average,2.0,,Great setting. Great barman but very overpriced! Take your credit card! Pick a nice day for great views
,,Cream of the Top,5.0,,"Great place to visit and see how Singapore are well organized from the the top. Fantastic to have dinner, coffee and a nice chitchat."
,,pretty,5.0,,pretty place and its free. nice place to chill in the evenings and watch the cars go by. not very quiet though.
,,Very breathtaking view,5.0,,"We went there at 5pm-7pm and it is nice to see the view during sunset!! it is just breathtaking with all the tall buildings on the other side and seas, ships and flower dome on the other side. You will love the lights like it is making music."
,,Amazing view-time it to get the sunset and entire singapore Lit up,5.0,,"Breathtaking view of the Ocean and the city. Time it around 5.30 6.00 to reach and catpure beautiful sunset (Don't forget your camera) and you will not stop clicking, once the entire singapore lights up. the MBFC and Merlion park, and entire singapore is visibilie. Till 8.00 pm is good time. If you wish to Eat, take the entry ticket to Ce La Vi Restaurant and you can redeem the entire value for food! Hope that you get a table near the glass parapet. Wait for some time, and grab a seat looking upon the Marina Bay. Go to the other side, to get a glimpse of GBB super tree grove all lit up! Timing of you visit is important!"
,,Great View!,5.0,,You can see all over the city. Very beautiful and fancy place. SGD20 you can take great photo's and enjoy the bar.
,,The tower of Singapore!,4.0,,"When you are up there, it is like you are on top of SIngapore, it is a pure 360 degrees view of the city."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"I like the building it was very amazing one ,i have been there for around city ,the views is nice ..."
,,Must visit,5.0,,The observation deck gives a very nice view. Best if seen in the evening or night. Entrance is just SGD 23. Well worth it.
,,Romantic.. spectacular view,5.0,,Cannot ask for a more romantic place than this skypark.. holding hands and spending time with your partner!
,,over the top feel...,5.0,,its an awesome view of the city from 57th floor... a must to do while in singapore.. visited here with family and all of them were happy.. specially my little doll... the cool breeze give quite a relaxation from the humidity of singapore
,,Get a 15 % Discount with An SQ boarding card,4.0,,"Our visit to the Skypark started with the very kind ticket seller who gave us a 15 % discount for foreigners who can present their boarding cards . The entrance fee we paid for 2 adults was $39.20
Although it was drizzling , we were able to see the Singapore man skyline . We were able to see from a distance the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest."
,,Check it out for viewing,4.0,,We went to the Sands Skypark. Was great to check it out. Super busy when we were there. Wouldn't want to stay there though. The pool was so over crowded. Cafe on top was nice. Friendly staff. Got some great photos. Could do at night as well. It we didn't.
,,Must see,5.0,,I was not sure if I was fan of just going to high rise building but was I wrong!!!!! The view is just spectacular.... the water the boats and Gardens by Bay. Wish I went in night as well or stayed late
,,Stunning,5.0,,This is a really unusual landmark but can't be missed in Singapore. The lift up to the viewpoint is great fun and the views are simply stunning. We timed it to watch the sunset and then look out at the city lights. Gorgeous but expensive (everything in Singapore is very expensive). Is s great place to get your bearings and plan what to see next!
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"This is a breathtaking view from the 57th floor over the bay. You can enjoy seeing the beautiful arquitecture of Singapore. Enjoy at 8 pm the light show of the fountains below.
If you are going to Singapore this is a place you must have in your bucket list."
,,A must on a singapore city trip,4.0,,Best views of the city! We stayed at the MBS hotel so had access to the skypark which has impressive 360 degree views of Singapore. It was not very busy at the time we went to you have plenty of time to soak in the surroundings
,,Chill with a view,5.0,,Tourist place. Nice view. Good for chilling with friends or dates. A bit snobbish attitude from staff.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Been there for a couple of night. Obviously the skyline from the city was stunning. Even the swimming pool was amazing. But let me tell you something. Too many people out there. It seems to be at sue market during Saturday with many children Shouting and loudly -
,,Ok,3.0,,"If it's to be able to go to the top of this iconic bldg then it is okay. But when you're there, it's just a small place. I enjoyed the flyer more. Maybe i should have gone in the evening to appreciate it more."
,,What a magnificent view,5.0,,"Thought twice about paying the $23 to visit the sky park but very happy we decided to pay the fee, and as we had a Singapore Air flight booked, we got 15% discount. The view from the top was simply breathtaking. From here you could see just about all of Singapore and the multitude of skyscrapers and realise just how big the city is. Highly recommend it"
,,Good bird's eye view of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are first time in Singapore, this attraction will give you a bird's eye view of the whole of Singapore CBD area.The restaurant Cest La Vie serves meals and also has a club version near the pool area. Good for photography."
,,Great View at Night. Shame it was booked out on New years night,4.0,,It was booked out on New years night for a private function ( cough cough) however at night it looks amazing with the Lights and all. there is a resuarant that you need to book to go to if you wanted to have drinks
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,Most beautiful view of the city ever. Sadly going to the skypark doesnt allow or show access to the famous infiinity pool
,,Nice view,5.0,,"Very expensive tickets only to get to the ground. Staff photos cost $ 50. At the top there is almost no room for sunbathing so we do not get long. True, the visible part of the city is very beautiful. We were on the pod higher than the review circle, so we have not already gone. In the cafe, prices are stunning, so you never bought anything and how those ice creams have inspired."
,,Beautiful view across the city,4.0,,If you are looking for a 360 degrees view across Singapore then this is a perfect spot. Nothing much to do except take in the good view.
,,Ok,4.0,,Worth visiting. But outsiders not allowed to use swimming pool is something I would not appreciate. Very expensive to pay 33 Singapore dollar. Overall ok
,,Marina Sands – Great View Of The City.,5.0,,"Views were really amazing and breathtaking, it’s a must visit place in Singapore. The best timing is to go there in the evening, can take pictures with various great view of the city. Since it’s an evening attraction its best advised to plan other places in the day."
,,You have to do this,5.0,,Just going to the top of this iconic building is a necessity. The views of course are outstanding. We went during the day but were told the views are much nicer at night. The disappointing part is that the public area is only a very small portion of the top.
,,Oh what a view,5.0,,"The sky park gives you a wonderful view of the city area of Singapore and the park area. It does cost to go to the sky park, but no where near as much as you would have spent getting to Singapore so if you want to enjoy the view it is well worth it.
There is a bar at the top that you can get to via another free lift but you do not get the access to the viewing platform, so you don't get up and close to the edge.
For the visitor there is no access to the pool area of sky deck to give hotel guests privacy.
We really enjoyed it the view and we're glad we made the trip to the top.
You can see the top area from the ground and you will be at the pointy end looking across at the Singapore flyer. If it is clouded in at the top don't go till it clears"
,,Best View in Singapore,4.0,,"After visiting the Singapore Flyer I decided to walk over and visit the Sky Park. If you are just going to the observation deck you will find the entrance outside, go the the glass doors and down the escalator. If you are going to go up for lunch you will find the entrance in the lobby.

Once your ticket is purchased you will be pointed to the right direction, but before you get on the elevator you will be asked to pose for a photo against a green screen, once you reach the Sky Park your photo has been printed and is ready for purchase, the photos (2) looked nice but at $55.00 SGD I decided to pass.

You only have access to the very front of the deck but that is enough to see everything you want to view anyway. There is some glass but there are openings with steel strands that are far enough apart to point your camera through.

It appears you can stay there as long as you wish but I was there during the day and there weren't many people there, maybe there is a different policy at night when I would imagine there would be more people.

When you are done head over to the opposite side from which you entered and you will find the elevator going down."
,,Crowded and hot sun,5.0,,Very crowded. Very nice view. Do not go in the afternoon because very hot. If have shelter much better. Pls wear sunglass and cap if u go during noon.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Well worth the visit. We purchased the S$20 ticket to the bar on the 57th floor. The S$20 went towards drinks which was good.
View was amazing. We arrived just as it was getting dark. Singapore was brilliantly lit up, and then from the bar we could watch the light show in the bay below."
,,amazing,5.0,,"this place is just amazing. most people love the skypark, and it is so relaxing, when you are watching the world go by."
,,Must see,5.0,,Wish I could have afforded staying at marina bay sands. The sky park gives you a beautiful glimpse of the infinity pool and plenty of photo opportunities with the Singapore skyline.
,,Best view in the city,5.0,,"Although very crowded, it's a must to go to the viewing platform to see the city from a unique perspective. There are limited services if you are not staying at the hotel. Tickets can be bought in the basement, accessed on one side of the building."
,,Marvelous,5.0,,Entrance is about 20 SGD. Views are breathtaking. The best timing is to go there in the evening. You can take pictures during the day and after about 40-60 min it will be completely dark :)
,,Breathtakingly high,5.0,,"The hotel is one of Singapore's latest and the trip to the top for a fantastic view was a must-do for us. The high speed lid was very smooth and we seemed to be at the top of tower one in an instant.
We were lucky to go there on a fine and settled, with no wind and had a drink in the bar after soaking up the fantastic views of the area.
Worth bearing in mind that once you leave the main viewing area and enter the restaurant part, there is no return, so you must stay in that part prior to your trip back to ground level.
Also there is no access to the rooftop swimming pool as this is reserved for hotel guests"
,,Breathtaking experience,5.0,,Most beautiful view from the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel of the entire marina area and in a way of the whole Singapore. Not to be missed. The bar lounges add to the fun.
,,Visit after sunset only,5.0,,"This place is a must visit but only after sunset. two reasons
1. You will become a crow during daytime if it is a sunny day
2. The skyline during night is a much better view than at the day time
You can take the tickets for the observation deck and enjoy there for as long as you like. you can take your own food and drinks to enjoy there."
,,So High but again spectacular views!,5.0,,So out of my comfort zone but well worth the ride to the 56th floor. Sweeping views of Singapore. Amazing place to visit
,,A must visit,5.0,,"The skypark is one of the icons of Singapore. It's situated on the 57 floor of Marina Bay Sands hotel at tower 1 (there are 3 towers in the hotel). It's free admission for hotel guests. The public can also go up with tickets purchased at $23 for adults. So it's a must to visit if you are a guest. Go early or before closing if you want a dip because it's less crowded. Admission will be on hold if there's too big a crowd already inside the open deck pool area. There are group tourists who just go up to catch a view of the infinity pool, city view and Gardens by the Bay at the observation deck. I highly recommend tourists and Singaporeans alike to just get the experience of a lifetime."
,,An evening to remember,5.0,,"The Skypark was not in our itinerary but we were advised that the views were breathtaking. We had done all our ticketing from a discount ticketing shop. So the SG$ 18 tickets cost us SG$10 only. We reached the deck at about 5:45 and we could already see people occupying the deck- though most of them were sitting away from the sun. We took up position facing the sunset, though it was still a good hour and fifteen minutes away.

There is nice F&B joint at the same level serving hotdogs & chilled drinks including beer & some cocktails. As the sun started dipping into the skyline..lights started coming on in the banking area. By about 7:30 the city looked absolutely stunning.
Time well spent. A visit to this place is worth it only if you intend to see the sunset and the night lights. An advantage over the Flier is that there is no time limit here."
,,Great View,3.0,,There is no doubt this offers the most incredible view however I would have just as happily caught the lift up to the top floor and sat in the restaurant without paying the $20+ to reach the SkyPark
,,Great shopping place,5.0,,"Its an experience in itself. View from Marina Bay Sands towards Esplanade or from Esplanade is splendid. Its a great shopping place, must visit place in Singapore. The best part is the light show in the evening. It is fantastic and should not be missed."
,,"Very impressive, great views",4.0,,"A very impressive feat of engineering.
We paid the S$20 each to go the the bar next to the observation deck, the view was amazing and well worth the fee.
The entry fee is credited towards your bar tab, but with the cost of drinks it doesn't go too far.
We went up during the day and found it good, I think if you went at night it would be magnificent."
,,Breathtaking,3.0,,Good view but hotel staffs are not very friendly. Ticketing booth is hard to find and no directions to guide us
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,My family went to the Skypark to celebrate with the newly weds (my son). We arrived almost evening and so caught a nice sunset. It was lovely looking down into the Gardens by the Bay from 57th Floor. We have a good view of Singapore and even Indonesian islands as it was a clear sunny day. Worth a visit.
,,Total Rip Off,1.0,,"The iconic boat shaped structure on top of the hotel is MASSIVE. I was so excited to explore the Skypark.

I wasn't staying at the hotel so I knew I'd have to buy a ticket and that it would probably be expensive but no big deal. I was super excited to buy a drink and lounge by the pool.

I find out on arrival that the Sky Park doesn't include the pool. UGH. Is there any way to pay to get access to the pool? ""No"". What a pain but oh well. I'll still go up, enjoy a drink & explore the rest.

So I pay the $23 for the elevator ride to the top and a snooty employee stresses that this covers only ONE ride to the top. Whatever, that's fine.

I get up and I'm let out onto a tiny little pavilion (access to less than 10% of the rooftop, no joke). Sure the views are great but that's where it ends. Is this a joke? Why is it called a Park?

At least there's a restaurant. So I walk up and the host asks if I'm staying at the hotel; I tell him no. He says ""I'm sorry ma'am, you had to buy a voucher before coming up if you want to eat here"" (voucher does not include price of food). What? No one told me that or I'd have done it! So I go the staff near the elevator and ask to buy a voucher for the restaurant. ""Not possible, you can only do that on the first floor"". Grrrrrrrr.

Most frustrating and underwhelming experience I had in Singapore. I ended up finally getting my lunch at a lame restaurant in the lobby. Never again."
,,Amazing at night,5.0,,"We got free entry as we stayed at Marina Bay Sands (Review coming up). If you are staying at the hotel then just got to Tower 3 and go to the 57th floor and after getting out of the elevator go to your left as that's skypark and your right it's Infinity Pool.
We went during the evening and it was stunning to see everything all lit up and it just looked beautiful.
But if you are going up there as a hotel guests then you must bring your room card at all times because that's your ""ticket"" up to he skypark and you can visit as many times as you want.
But if you aren't a hotel guest then it cost I think 23 SGD per ticket. But worth it!"
,,Beautiful and mesmerising view - Must see spot,5.0,,Amazing view and spectacular sight . Great to see Singapore from an eagle eye . Lovely location and well maintained .
,,Great views,5.0,,Again this is just an amazing building and the view is awesome it has a great view of the gardens.. pop into the bar grab a chair and soak it up
,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,5.0,,"Wow. Just wow, this place (Marina Bay Sands) is amazing, pricey yes, but for me personally I did it all for the experience, staff here are all so friendly and useful, Infinity pool was just amazing, doesn't matter if you went for a swim in the morning, afternoon or night, the view is next to nothing.
Downstairs across the road, there is a mall, where you can shop, and buy much cheaper food than the hotel."
,,A few pros but more cons,3.0,,"Ok, let's start with the good stuff- great views, very interesting infinity pool, lovely room.
The bad, queues to check-in long. In many respects the hotel and attached shopping centre are like a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, except the prices here are very high, it's not as glam, more crowded and the boarding is no where near as slick. It doesn't feel like a five star resort. We are in 15th floor and need to take two lifts to get to top. Booked in for one night and heading to friendly boutique hotel tomorrow night.
If you are a beach holiday person and don't mind spending £6.00 for an ice-cream lolly you will probably love this. As it happens I'm happy I've seen it but glad to move on."
,,Stunning View!!!,5.0,,"It is one of the most amazing view from the top roof of a building in Singapore. If you are lucky enough to be a guest in the hotel, you will have the chance to use the most amazing swimming ever seen. Otherwise, just go for a drink. Free entrance + free drinks for girls on Wednesdays. Staff is really polite above all at the entrance."
,,Excellent view!!!,5.0,,The Skypark is a great location to view Singapore from top view. We visited this place in the evening and stayed till 8.00 PM to experience day and night time views both. I had two options either Skypark or Singapore flyer. Then I decided to go for this Since it is cheap and you can stay as you want compared to the flyer. We were really happy with this attraction.
,,Nice views,4.0,,Made our way up to the 57th floor to have a quiet drink and admire the views. This floor also has the hotels' swimming pool there as well. Apart from the view everything else was ordinary. Bar service slow. I gave it a score of 4 for the view only.
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Great views of the marina, ideally go at night because it looks amazing all lite up. Its not very big and nothing really up there other than the view, but its defo worth a visit."
,,Eyeopener !,5.0,,Fantastic views from the top !! plenty of designer shops and even a canal with boats to take you up and down !
,,Breath Taking Views,4.0,,With company of my sister in-law we ventured up to the top of Marina Bay Skypark in the lift reaching 56 floors going by the lift. On top there is a restaurant and swimming pool for guests who are staying in the hotel. It was later in the afternoon we walked about the deck to get some interesting views for photography. From where we were standing we could oversee below the Gardens of the Bay. Some of the people on deck were going to stay and watch the light show but we decided to go below in the grounds of the garden to see the lights. This sky park may not be suitable for anyone who suffers with heights. The deck is very safe and surrounded by high 'see through' walls and cabling. Another way to view Singapore.
,,AmaZing views,5.0,,There are two options for getting to the top. You either pay to go to the observation deck or you can go to the bar and have a drink. The bar is slightly higher and you get the bonus of being able to have a drink. The view are amazing and the whole place blows one away. Even the foyer area has amazing ceiling. Just be sure to look up.
,,Over price,3.0,,"Spend there about 30 minutes, toke some pictures, video and also made live procast in Facebook.
Yes there is WiFi.
View was great and at the top there has restaurant and cafe where to get cold drinks, food and snack.
Maybe ticket price could be less. 23 s$ just for use elevator and there was person in every step in a way."
,,JUST WOW,5.0,,We did a night tour which included walking through this amazing place and heading to the top to view the lights of Singapore. Stunning at night
,,Skywalk,3.0,,Nice view shame about the cost. Would only recommend if you can afford it. Nice to look at from street level
,,Marina Bay Sands SkyPark,4.0,,"Added itinerary if you holidaying in Singapore.
It's hard to miss Marina Bay Sands, from far it looks like a surf-board, some say ship-shape, I leave the imagination to you to describe.
Designed by famous architect Moshe Safdie, with an unobstructed 360-degree panoramic view of the city and beyond. Bird's eye view of the bustling shipping lane, stunning architectural wonders of Super Trees Groves at the Garden By The Bay. SkyPark is also photographer delight. Experience both Day and night view, especially at night you can have a good view of nightly light and laser show-""Wonder Full"".

,,Not to be Missed,5.0,,"This sky park with a huge infinity pool, gardens, track and more is awesome. If you stay here, take the time to walk around the roof. If you don't stay here, take the time to visit. It is that special."
,,Singapore!,5.0,,"This is what I think of when thinking of Singapore! The hotel is beautiful and unlike anything you'll ever see. The whole area around it is great to walk around and see the beautiful, modern city. It looks even more beautiful at night."
,,Once in a lifetime,5.0,,"The whole family spent one night here for my dad's 60th birthday. We hesitated due to the cost but it was all worth it! Lying buy the pool, sipping on amazing drinks from Spago, admiring the view! The rooms were really big and felt luxurious! It was a real once in a lifetime experience!"
,,Fantastic view!,5.0,,View more beautiful at night. You can drink a cocktail in the bar on the 57th floor and enjoy a beautiful view of Singapore at night.
,,Greatest view from atop!,5.0,,"We chose between the Skypark or the Flyer before we arrived in Singapore. But eventually after visiting the Gardens by the Bay, we decided to go up the MBS Skypark as it was cheaper than the Flyer. We did not regret it though cause we were able to have a great view from atop with no time limit until sunset!"
,,Best shopping Mall in Far east,5.0,,What a wonderful marquee building including shopping mall and many restaurants. All very impressive a must visit when in Singapore.
,,Great views,3.0,,"As expected there were sensational views from the sky deck. It was quite crowded when we were there. There was a small gift shop and kiosk. Would have been much better if they provided some tables, chairs and umbrellas so you could sit and enjoy a cold drink while enjoying the views"
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"We had lunch in the restaurant on 57th floor, we went for the view! The food is average, small portions and very expensive for what it is. I had a foie gras burger, which was good, my husband had a dish that was not good. He could not eat it ! We had 2 beers and the price was about 115 Sgd$ once but not again. Though the view is worth going there."
,,On top of the world,4.0,,Had to go here after seeing it on extreme engineering Listen guys good view but the beer is expensive At $20 per pint of Stella plus service charge plus tax Worth a trip
,,Amazing skyline,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is located in Merlion Park. You can go up to the observation deck to see the breathtaking skyline of beautiful Singapore. Ticket costs around 24 SGD. You'll go up to 57th floor on observation deck. View in evening is amazing. You can see Singapore's skyline including gardens by the bay and Singapore flyer. Do take your DSLR if you wanna have good pictures. Best time to visit is in evening before sunset. Though there's no time restriction to stay on top, around half hour would be enough. If you stay longer, you can see the dancing fountain show from to top or can just go down to see it. It's worth watching."
,,What a view!!,4.0,,We hustled our way through the crowds of tourists to see amazing views of Singapore. It was worth the $23 just tick it off the bucket list. Was very disappointed we couldn't get into the lovely looking bar up there as that was for hotel guests only. A cold drink was so close but inaccessible.
,,Cheap way to see the city,5.0,,"Evening or day time is both beautiful, restaurants are pricey but stop for a drink and indulge in the free nuts! Beautiful way to see the city! Lovely on sunset! Even if you can't afford to stay at the hotel you can at least feel what it's like if you could!"
,,Nice to visit but only worth it at night time,4.0,,When I bought these tickets in my travel agent I was left with the impression that we would have access to the pool area. That was not the case. We had a good time but we visited it during the wrong time of the day. Going up during sun hours is very hot so the best time to go up would be at the end of the day or even during the night if it's opened.
,,Have a cocktail in the Sky Bar - You won't be disapointed,4.0,,"From the 3rd tower, pay a reasonable entry fee and take the elevator up - way up! This is a great place to take in a 360 degree visit of the sprawling metropolis that is Singapore."
,,360' degrees spectacular and breathtaking view of the city,5.0,,"Since we were booked at this hotel, we decided not to ride the Singapore Flyer (ferris wheel). We saw and enjoyed the breathtaking views of the city, Harbor, the Wheel and Garden by the Bay and etc from our room window, by the pool and jacuzzi. The hotel structure itself is an architectural wonder with three big foundations supporting the pool above. We had a great time at this lovely building in Singapore and am sure you all will."
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you have to go there! It offers spectacular views of the city, and you can see all the way to Malaysia on one side, Indonesia on the other. I didn't want to leave actually, it was so lovely to get the perspective on the city/country. I can't recommend this more!"
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,Most exciting building! World class! My family and I very much enjoyed our visit up to the Skypark. Singapore truly Asia! Truly amazing views to behold.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Amazing view. Go before sunset. Spent 2-3 hours sitting and enjoying the Singapore skyline:) Love to go there again!
,,What a way to spend Sunday :) The best view in Singapore,4.0,,"We paid $20 each for a voucher at the concierge (Tower 3) and whizzed up to the 56 th floor Ce La Vi Bar
The view and outlook was sensational The voucher could be spent on drinks and food
Just having had lunch, we had a couple of lovely long cocktails and relaxed in the stunning surroundings"
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"The views are fantastic! Go before sunset, and then you can see the Singapore skyline in the day and lit up at night. This is a must visit for any trip to Singapore!"
,,Excellent View,5.0,,"Can watch the Garden by the Bays from top
The light show also visible
Very good view of the marina and harbour skyline
A relaxed feel
Worth a visit
Charge to visit if you are not a guest at the marina bay resort
Best time after 5:30pm"
,,Unbelievable hotel,4.0,,"Service, variety and luxury pretty much sum this place up. It is like a medium sized city all in one place and super convenient to everything. One of the top ten resort hotels I have stayed in world wide. Not cheap for sure, but if you can afford it you will not be disappointed. My only constructive feedback would be on the quality of pillows provided. I am allergic to feathers and requested a foam pillow and what I got was pretty disappointing. Large and hard. Having just come from China on this trip and staying at a Hyatt, I would have to say this was a negative. When you are spending this much per night, I would expect a quality pillow, not a budget one. As you spend almost a 3rd of your day sleeping, this is a key part of a 4 star rating for me seeing as I am spending a week and did not bring my own pillow from home. Sore neck in the morning and not feeling rested is a bummer.

The rooftop infinity pool is amazing, but you need it to unwind your stiff neck."
,,The best view,5.0,,What can I add as in tittle.best come before sunset stay up to dark when Singapure is going to sleep.
,,Not as great as anticipated,3.0,,"We stayed 4 nights. We had to ask for our room to be changed as the smell of the room on Level 40 was unbearable. It was a mouldy smell & it was as though there was no air circulation. I have asthma and the room affected it BIG time. In saying that though, concierge went above & beyond to change our room promptly & surprisingly on a lower floor I had a totally different experience.
The hotel was packed. If u want a quiet, relaxing getaway ""forget this place"" the Infinity pool was spectacular especially at night. The food at the pool was great but we struggled to find somewhere on the cheaper side to eat around the hotel. We stayed here after staying 4 nights at W Resort Sentosa Island and i actually preferred W Resort over Marina Bay Sands."
,,Looks better from below,2.0,,"Unless you're staying at the resort, save your money. Over priced elevator ride,food/drinks available but no where to sit and enjoy, unless you enjoy sitting on floor boards. Not a lot to do once you're up there. Enjoyed the Sky Tower at Sentosa, similar views in comfort and air conditioning"
,,A must to say you did it!,5.0,,"Views amazing at 57 floors up. Can no longer go to the infinity pool (understandably if you're staying there, you wouldn't want 100s of people staring at you)."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Make sure you visit this bar. Amazing views and great drinks. You have to pay to go to the bar but you get a voucher which you can redeem against a drink - so really it's to ensure that a purchase is made. The bar is at one end and the hotel amenities and club at the other.

Definitely worth stopping by!"
,,Very busy but fantastic views,4.0,,Iconic hotel - a must see for tourists. Did not stay in hotel but visited the observation deck. Fantastic views of Singapore. A pity that non-residents are not allowed to use the infinity pool. Foyer was absolutely heaving with people. More like a train station than a hotel and a queue for the lift to the observation deck (lift leaves from basement!)
,,Value for money???,3.0,,"Paid the SD$23 each to visit the Skypark and left both thrilled and disappointed.

We arrived late in the afternoon wanting to see the lights of Singapore from the best vantage point in town, after spending all afternoon at the Gardens by the Bay, which were spectacular.

The view was unbelievable, however the lack of basic facilities up there was disappointing. There was not any seating whatsoever and no shade or shelter. While there it rained and everyone took shelter in the only cover available, the entrance to the lifts and toilets.

We really got the impression they only expect people to spend 10 or 15 minutes up there before leaving. This would make it one of the most expensive attractions in the world.

Would I go back again, no. Am I disappointed I went, no. Could it have been made a more enjoyable experience with the addition of some basic seating and shelter, yes."
,,Whoooaw!,5.0,,"This place has a nice surprise after every corner! It has the biggest and fanciest mall I have ever seen; great restaurants; amazing views, the light show, the Sands Hotel, the Helix-bridge.. definately worth a visit, especially after dark"
,,Incredible Views,4.0,,"We visited Marina bay sands in the evening as we were both a bit hesitate about the height, so thought that this would be a little less daunting for us. We made the right decision as it is really high but definitely worth it! We paid to go into one of bars instead of the observation view point so we could have a drink whilst taking in the stunning views! Although you get a $20 voucher to use in the bar we still ended up paying pretty much the same again for us to enjoy a single drink each in the CE LA VI bar - so it is very, very expensive. If we were to do this again we would probably pay the extra to go to the observation point instead as you would be able to get some better photo's and closer to the edge. When taking the photos from the bar you get bollards and stuff in the way. I would recommend visiting for the views alone if you get the chance."
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,Great views of the city and surrounding areas. Quick lift to get to the observation deck. Some food and drink options available.
,,Worth Taking a Peek Inside,4.0,,"I opted not to stay at this hotel but it definitely was worth taking a look at inside and is well located if you want to be in the Gardens By the Bay area. It dominated the skyline from many of the places I visited in Singapore. Instead of opting to pay the high prices for the observation deck, I opted to have lunch at Spago. located on the top floor of the hotel. The food there was excellent and best of all, I was able to see the famed Infinity Pool as well as the view looking over Gardens of the Bay and have a wonderful lunch for just a bit more than I would have paid just going up to the Observation Deck. The interior of the hotel was interesting and there were some nice shops. It also is close to a large shopping mall complex that had a casino, extensive food court, movie theaters etc."
,,Sooooo hot,4.0,,"The views are spectacular, but there is virtually no shade to take cover in. We managed about 10 minutes in the searing heat of the Skypark, just enough to take a few photos. They need to supply a cafe, some shade and something to drink."
,,Surprising Visit,4.0,,"My wife and I visited the observation deck to catch the views of the Singapore skyline. There was a lovely sunset and we watched the music in the gay performance way below us.
Then we were surprised to see about 40 Spider-Man fans dressed up for a photoshoot on the roof. Even more surprised when Spider-Man himself turned up for the promotional shoot - brilliant."
,,What A View,5.0,,"WOW! WOW! WOW! Amazing experience at the top restaurant, with a view worth every penny. Ambience was spot on with great music. There was a crowd, though it was not overwhelming.
Food was incredible with a good menu selection. Was very surprised at portion size as it was incredibly generous.
We were 3 and shared 5 starters.. just perfection.
Next time we stay :)"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Well worth the price for me and my wife and the pool was pure and the views was amazing, would definitely recommend to come here at 5pm for sunrise views !"
,,Great views from an interesting lookout point,4.0,,"The Skypark area is less than 10% of this rooftop structure. The rest of the area is ""reserved"" for hotel guests. The crowds are handled like cattle by the staff. The views are great and interesting."
,,Great Views,5.0,,Worth the $24 going up the top for the amazing views. The lift is very quick. Obviously best on a clearer day.
,,Singapore 2017,4.0,,Skypark is very beautiful and peaceful. Its has a nice view over the city and is for both couple and family friendly. Ideal for relaxing and having a walk. Its a beautiful full park indeed.
,,Well worth the ride to the top,5.0,,"At 23 dollars each, this is an experience that you cannot miss. You get uninterrupted 360 views of Singapore. Do not forget to take your camera!!"
,,Breathless,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore in tourism, make sure you stay at the Marina Bay Sands. If you can't afford, make sure you pay a visit to the upper deck, during the day or at night. It is breathless sight..."
,,Great night view,4.0,,A must visit during the night to view Singapore skyline in the CBD area. Surrounded with great and expensive restuarants which are popular for celebrations.
,,Best bird's eye view of Singapore,5.0,,"This place is a must go-to place to see some key attractions in Singapore from atop. It is best to go here at least 30 mins before sunset, so you can see the city while there is still light - during sunset, and see the Garden's by the Bay, the Fullerton hotel, the Singapore Flyer and the financial district light up.

Not advisable to go there at noon or before 4pm since it will be too hot and you cannot use umbrella."
,,Worth going,5.0,,"Always very attractive and worth visiting location in singapore. Must visit once. If you can afford room over there,its more than great."
,,Beautiful view of skyline,4.0,,"Its an amazing experience. The view is breath-taking. Advisable to go around 6pm, so you get a view of the skyline in daylight and then slowly as it gets dark, you can get the night view too."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"What a great way to see the skyline of Singapore. Great views down onto the bay and down onto the gardens. Didn't book this, just turned up and paid.
Sunset is a nice tinge to visit and watch the sky scrapers and bay area light up"
,,While attending a Conference,5.0,,Amazing Hotel! Very nice bars and restaurants. The roof garden and pool os breath-taking. This is a place is a must to visit if one cannot afford staying there....
,,Amazing,4.0,,"That's a really amazing place.
Beautiful and impressive overview at the terrace.
You also can sit and relax at the roof restaurant to enjoy the time.
Its not so crowdy because everywhere is enough space.
Only at the Restaurant it's always busy and the prices there are high as the building. Anyway it's worth to take a rest there."
,,"""A View to a Kill"" ala Singapore, not James Bond",5.0,,"A view to die for!

Imagine soaking in an infinity pool in the sky sipping Singapore Sling coctail with an infinite view of blue skies and white clouds with pulsating beats of the latest music against the neon lights of the city in the distance.

Imagine no more. You are over sixty levels up at the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel & casino complex - the SkyPark, a massive ""banana-boat"" like structure with manicured gardens and infinity pool.
Heaven is a place on earth! @ the SkyPark atop the iconic & world reknown Marina Bay Sands."
,,great view...just pray It won't rain!!!,4.0,,paid 48 SGdollars just to be at the 57th floor. Was the money worth it? I must say yes because it was my first time here and I also have with me my 73 year-old Mum. They gave my mother senior's discount and I paid only 40 SGdollars. No access to the pool though. Better alternative if you cannot afford to stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.We stayed for 20minutes. Food at the restaurant is quite expensive.
,,Beautiful view!,5.0,,"Was here for a night visit in the Cé la vi club lounge, at the tip of the skypark. The view was phenomenal! You get an overview of Singapore city, and if you go over to the other side you can see Gardens by the bay from above. It was beautiful with the night lights. Even though it's a club, a lot of the visitors where there just for the view like us.

Quite expensive for entry and drinks though. We went for ladies night on a wednesday which got us a sweet deal, girls got in for free and got a free drink while the guys paid their entry but got a drink voucher. Worth to know that the guys has to be over 25 to get in at ladies night.

Would def. recommend a visit!"
,,Spectacular View!!,4.0,,Spectacular view of Singapore from 56th floor. Huge deck and you can see the beauty of the city from here.
,,Top deck veiw,5.0,,The view from the top deck of the marina bay sands is amazing and we'll worth the money to get to the top
,,56 Floors,5.0,,"The view from the top was phenomenal! The price on the group photo was too expensive, $70. The view of the bay and the Gardens by the Bay was lovely. I would like to go out night."
,,Enjoy the incredible Sunset View,4.0,,"There are two bars at the top, one facing the city, the other facing the harbor. The city facing one is quite incredible, but has the famous infinity pool right in front of it meaning you're view is hindered by a lot of hotel guests in bathing cloth taking selfies. additionally, things are really overpriced because they know they can.

Nonetheless, we enjoyed having a drink and a sunset view after walking 18km that day! It was a beautiful way to finish the day and absolutely a must see!"
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,"The Skypark is situated at 56th floor of MBS, the best time to visit is towards sunset so that you can have lovely views of day time as well as lights when it gets dark. Lovely view of Singapore City from this point. MUST visit."
,,Breathtaking view at 56th Floor,5.0,,"Breathtaking view at 56th Floor
We choose to be here before sunset to witness both day view and night view.
Pretty cool place to hangout. The deck is quiet big with the Gardens by the bay over looking on one side while all the tall skyscraper on the other.
There is a small cafe joint for all the hunger pangs but the restaurant on top looks very inviting however there is no entry from the observatory deck."
,,Amazing View of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"Going here in evening is outstanding. Seeing beautiful lights of Gardens By The Bay, roads, and buildings. You can buy snacks while feel the breeze of the wind and having a cup of coffee. Such a nice place, tourist friendly."
,,Horribly expensive...poor service and bluntly a rip off,1.0,,"The positive first...the views are great....but that's where it ends.

You are forced to take the picture by their photographers...even if you insist your not interested...

The staff are militant...stand here..you there etc...no courtesy.

You can't see the pool as it is for hotel guests only....it is very hot...no thought re cooling...expensive food...expensive price to go up...even for a 2 year old (elsewhere in Singapore 2 year Olds are free).

I wouldn't do it again...go to the Fairmont Hotel sky bar and look out the window...better option."
,,Not a 'must do',3.0,,"Good views but over priced.
Suggest going up to the restaurant as you get the same view and a beverage for your money rather than nothing.
You can only see 180degree as only able to access one end of the terrace.
If you flew Singapore Airlines there is discount available on ticket price."
,,Awesome views,4.0,,The shape of the building and on top of that the shape of the park with swimming pool itself is amazing.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Such a nice view over singapore city, although the food was a bit overpriced, it was definitely worth the experience."
,,Can spend a whole day!,5.0,,"This iconic waterside exemplifies what Singapore can offer, besides shopping. I cannot imagine what it would be like, when the massive outdoor stage hosts concerts. I caught a water show in my yesterday's walk."
,,This place is a must and you will need a whole day,5.0,,This place has so much to do firstly shop till you drop the take the list to the top for some of the best views in Singapore skip the line and save your money on entry buy having a drink in the bar we had lunch here taking in the views and watch people swim in the infinity pool really looks like they are swimming off you can't swim unless you are a hotel guest then we shoped some more
,,The iconic Singapore,5.0,,Walking around Marina Bay Sand with night view is more spectacular with beautiful lighting and of course not too busy! Tips : dont forget to bring your own bottle while enjoying this fabulous landmark
,,Huge hotel...,5.0,,We walked through the bottom part of the hotel to get to the train station and the foyer was massive.
,,Have you been there! Absolutely!,5.0,,"Just look outside , after that I had been the top of Marina Bay for swimming! It's ok for text rest and relax with your friends! A view so great thing!"
,,One of the best views of the city,4.0,,"This place gives one of the best views of the downtown skyline in Singapore and probably comparable to other cities in the world. The best time to visit is dusk so that you can watch the setting sun and then slowly see the entire city light up below you. If you have binoculars, you can see the Indonesian islands from up here and pretty much all the way until Clarke Quay. The ticket can be slightly cheaper though, considering there is no more access to infinity pool"
,,Expensive but a must see,3.0,,"It was raining and it was hired out to a private function so only got an hour but it was long enough.

For the money all you got was the view.... no facilities or interaction. They need to look at what they could do to make it more interesting."
,,An expensive view from a famous iconic building,3.0,,The view is magnificent but we were disappointed that there were no seats to rest on on a very hot day. In my view this was an expensive but overpriced attraction.
,,Just anazing!,5.0,,"Because of my job I 've been to Singapore many times over the years. Every time I make at least one stop at Marina bay.
The view from roof garden it s amazing !
Ce la vi lounge bar witch is located at 57th floor has very friendly and professional stuff!

Access to the pool is available only to guest of marina bay sands hotel.

I suggest it 100% if you ever been in Singapore !!"
,,Great view,4.0,,"The place had a great view from top, though not worth d fee.. but then, again, it was a one time experience which was good.

The best time to.be there is around of before sunset to have a good view in d daylight n then later after d sunset."
,,Sky bar wow,5.0,,"We visited the sky bar on the 58th or so floor.
Fantastic views of the city , we visited as dusk was falling , fantastic.
Costs around 20 Singapore $ to get up there , but you exchange for a drink , so all in all ( Singapore wise ) good value.
The whole building is stunning & commands the area around it.
A must if in town ?"
,,Popped in for a drink,5.0,,Amazing views over Singapore. Really expensive souvenir photo but it is a once in a life time trip. The most impressive hotel.
,,Iconic building,5.0,,"Its truly a legacy of Singapore.. The mall attached to it, the 57 floors and the breathtaking view from the top are one of the best noting points of this place.. The architecture, the facilities are truly amazing.."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"We went to the bar, not the observation deck. The bar overlooks the deck and the entry fee is given as a credit for a drink from the bar or towards a meal, so seems better value than just standing on the deck, which is below the bar.

Spectacular views over Singapore skyline."
,,Visiting as a non hotel resident,5.0,,"This hotel has a roof top garden, restaurants, bars and even a swimming pool only open to hotel certain hotel guests, views are breath taking"
,,Trapped 56 floors up,1.0,,This would have been a nice experience if we could have left when we'd seen enough but it took between 30 mins and 60 mins to line up waiting for lifts down. Most of that time there was no air movement so we continued to sweat. Naturally we were not prepared for such a wait. There is no where up there to sit either. We are in our 60s and had already walked a lot to get there. It is disgraceful that they take your money and allow that to happen with no warning.
,,Not just a tall building with a view !,4.0,,View from MBS will awe you for what Singapore has achieved. Reach there at 5.30 and wait till the sunset. Watch as the city comes alive
,,Waste of $23,1.0,,"We heard that there was a garden with infinity pool on top of this building. We planned to get a drink at the bar. Five of us ($115) paid our money and rode to the top only to find that we couldn't go to the other side to see the park/pool. The park/pool is reserved only for guests of the hotel. If you want a drink, there is a $10 cover charge to enter the air conditioned bar. A few photos of the city and a few minutes standing in the sun and we were ready to leave. A huge waste of time/money."
,,Amazing views for singapore and bonus to watch SuperTree Grove light show from top,5.0,,I went there at the evening so that I can see the view in the day light and then the night view. It was simply awesome.
,,Good view,3.0,,I am glad we done it (another thing ticked off my bucket list) you did have a great view of the city and using our SA boarding passes we saved a bit off the admission price but I was disappointed the small area you only had access to for the price they charged. All in all I think we were only there for about 30 mins.
,,Revenue based attraction,1.0,,"Was really disappointed tonight when I went to go up to the skypark for a drink with family/friends while on holiday. To my surprise it was going to cost $23 just to go up to the skypark, this is before buying anything to drink. The $23 did not include anything just a lift to the floor. Suggest offering a soft drink or something as $23 for a nice view and a lift is beyond excessive."
,,Expensive,1.0,,Can not understand how you can charge $23 to go to the top of this building unbelievable. The price is not worth it. Not happy
,,Hotel Guests so Had the Pleasure,5.0,,Not sure how much this costs if you aren't staying at the hotel but as guests we got in with our room key. What an amazing view over the entire main city.
,,Quite amazing,4.0,,"How can you not be interested in this amazing building. There was some confusion with purchasing tickets to go to the top, being able to go to the viewing platform and being able to go to the bar - 2 completely different things, almost on the same level, but requiring you to go another floor down to the viewing platform after being at the bar! - strange, but something to do with management. Many people were confused."
,,Best view,4.0,,One of the best attractions of Singapore. 5 minutes drive from V Hotel Lavender. The best time to visit is late evening when one can view the entire Singapore in daylight and the view after sunset.
,,Amazing pool area,5.0,,I mistakenly review this under Marina Bay but it is truly amazing. I would stay here just for the pool on the rooftop. WOW
,,Impressive,4.0,,"We saw this through our hotel window on the horizon (because it is so so big) and we walked to it, following the river. We found out (off a traveller) it is a hotel, an expensive hotel. You can go to the top in the lift if you pay, but we just went inside downstairs and then left, as it was really busy and I'm not keen on crowds."
,,Dinner or drinks at the top,5.0,,"This building is impressive. Worthwhile to book and visit. Several options available, I advise a drink and snacks at Spago"
,,Sight to behold!,5.0,,"The unique design of the building, the view from the observation deck and the grandeur of the hotel make it one of the most unique experiences in Singapore. The trip to the deck is on the expensive side though!"
,,"Finally we made it, we love it",5.0,,"Seeing it the last time, still under construction we couldn't wait to go.
We avoided the viewing platform as the cost for a family of 4 was not to our liking. But we went to the restaurant on top, actually 1 floor above the viewing platform on the 57th floor. We had to buy 20$ F&B vouchers per adult, but in the restaurant we had some fries and drinks, enjoyed the view and friendly service and still saved money.
a hint; walk over to the mall, there is a great food court too!"
,,Must see,5.0,,Must see place . One of the unique restaurant situated at the top of the three building . Must see place
,,Boat hotel,5.0,,A unique place to visit in Singapore but expensive. Just 23 $ to enter and about 100$ to eat but the view is awesome
,,Great view,5.0,,"We took a look late one night in order to get a glimpse of the famous view. If you are just looking for the view, you can go up to one of the restaurants and depending on how busy it is, they may permit you to take a look without actually ordering or getting a table."
,,Awesome View from Top,5.0,,"A must visit place when you visit Singapore. Really good view from top, you can capture your beautiful pics with city in background. Restaurant at top is little expensive but is also good place to eat and drink."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,Spend USD 23 for ticket and went up the building to the front end of the massive overhead boat. Scenic view of Singapore. Good.
,,seems like a little universe in there,4.0,,Busy and buzzing....good place to hang out even without spending any money....there is a food court for cheaper eats. The canal seems to have a charm even though it is man-made.
,,Family Holiday,5.0,,Amazing views from the top floor which also has an infinity pool. Very good place to see sunset. Can easily spend a few hours there.
,,Overrated,2.0,,"This really didn't feel worth the 23$ we paid, the observation deck has a nice view but not all that great, this came after a long day of traveling and I just wanted to get over with it. Also I didn't like the fact that I wasn't even allowed to see the infinity pool which was what I was most looking forward to ."
,,Visit the Rooftop Bar!,5.0,,Incredible and iconic architecture! Visit the rooftop bar for a drink and light food - with the most fantastic panoramic views of the city. We were there at lunchtime - but I'm sure the nighttime views are also incredible.
,,Best views in town,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is a must do when you visit Singapore especially in the evening when the entire city lights up it makes for a great picture as well as a very romantic evening or enjoyable evening with friends and family .
You go to the top most floor where you will be given the option at the bar for A standing table or a seat table all with minimum order requirements, we took the standing table for four people and ordered a bottle of sparkling wine at approximately 60 US dollars which was great value for the views and the atmosphere. An experience of a lifetime that you can't miss out on when visiting Singapore."
,,Nice view from the top but not worth 30SG$,4.0,,"It was a nice place to have a view of the city. Stayed there for 2 hours and watched the light and sound show of Gardens by the bay from here.
Over good but price is high as the area where you can go is limited."
,,The bests!,5.0,,By looking at it o my God it gives me a comfort. it gives you an opportunity how good the scenery was. it gives you more that what you deserve in life. i don't know thats how i feel. i don't know if theres a sense on regarding what on what reviews i gave to them. lol
,,Tickets are costly,5.0,,Good place to visit but i felt it is highly priced.better to go to singapore Flyer then to visit Skypark.
,,Worth a visit but check out Cé La Vi bar,4.0,,"Instead of visiting the observation deck for $23, we went to the 57th floor to Cé La Vi bar. That cost $20 but they gave you a voucher worth $20, just enough for one over-priced drink! The bar itself is loud and didn't seem to have a great ambience but the views are spectacular and you can take it all in sipping on a tasty cocktail. If you're there at 19.45, check out the lights show of Supertree Grove. Wonderful views!"
,,A must see if you're staying in the hotel,5.0,,"A truly amazing piece of architecture, stretching a pool across the 3 hotel towers. Sadly the pool is often full of visitors with selfie sticks taking photos."
,,There are better skyparks,3.0,,"It's a bit expensive for the little they let you access, so you might consider booking a meal at the cafe/restaurant instead. The view is impressive but I prefer Altitude at Raffles or the restaurant in the skytree at Gardens by the Bay"
,,The Observation Deck,5.0,,"Level 57 is great place to see the city. Watching the sun setting and enjoy the Singapore Sling cocktail the same time. The whole Singapore was so beautiful, the lights in a dark...amazing view! Great memories..."
,,Good place for photo-op,4.0,,"This skypark (or Skydeck) is a place of spectacular view. The place offers 180° view of Singapore (the other 180° is for the guest of the hotel ).
You can see most of Singapore famous landmarks, such as Singapore Flyer, Gardens By The Bay, Merlion (at this height and distance, you have to bring binocular to see the Merlion), Esplanade, etc.
You can even see Batam Island of Indonesia."
,,Good views but pricy.,3.0,,"If your not staying at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, you can still go up to the top and see excellent views of Singapore and on a clear day all the way to Malaysia. Cost is $28 SD, a bit pricey. You get the same view from the Sigapore Flyer right next door and a ride to."
,,Out of this World,5.0,,This place is a must see. We had so much to do in the one day we were there. The Infinity pool is insane and surrounded by restaurants and bars. Sunset and Sunrise were the best. So glad we did this.
,,On top of Singapore,4.0,,Best time to visit is in the evenings before sunset and watch the sunset while on the deck. You can have a birds eye view of the entire Singapore. They perform a laser show after sunset. It was too windy at the top and pleasant weather. Loved it totally.
,,What a View!,5.0,,"Instead of going to the Observation Deck on level 56 , we paid to go to the Bar on level 57. The entry fee just about covers the price of a drink...so you can sit and enjoy a beer or a cocktail while taking in the fabulous view! A lovely thing to do in the evening watching the lights of Singapore beneath you."
,,Pool is spectacular,4.0,,"The infunity pool is to die for. Located on the roof overlooking the skyline. Beautiful at night. Meals are expensive. Bathroom is huge. Walking distance to Garden Bay gardens and Super Trees. Also, there is a shopping mall and casino connected to hotel."
,,Unique and stylish,5.0,,"Loved the touring these 3 towering-structure belittling other buildings in the area. The observatory atop these towers simply takes your breath away. The lit up Singapore (if visiting at night) from the Ob Deck gives you an awesome 360 degree sight and you can't resist praising the visionary for the effort. There are restaurants, cafes and bars where you can relax and have something to drink or munch. The Mall on the first floor is littered with all branded outlets, you name it, they have it. Indeed a nice place to visit and enjoy an evening out with family."
,,A hotel with a large and amazing boat shaped swimming pool and jacuzzi bath on the top floor(57th floor).,5.0,,"Rooms are spacious. South China sea view from the rooms is terrific...

Hotel shopping complex is really nice...

Casino is quite large and happening...

Swimming pool and jacuzzi are theeeee best... A kind of different relaxation experience!! Nice snacks and cocktails available near the pool.

One can feel and enjoy the air and terrific city from the pool...

Marina area itself is awesome. Gardens by the bay is located next to the hotel. So many things to see around. 2days required to enjoy pool+other free amenities+ mall+ casino + gardens by the bay.

Enjoy!!!!"
,,Amazing Views from the Top!,4.0,,"Have a Singapore Sling here instead of Raffles! The views of the Gardens by the Bay and of all Singapore are worth the price of admission! Not sure I would stay at the hotel...way too big.. More a Convention type. Great air conditioned ""hawker"" food court beneath it is also not to be missed."
,,Just WOW!!,5.0,,"The view from the top is absolutely amazing!! We went there in the afternoon and it was kind of a rain drenched afternoon, still the views were fantastic, so i could definitely imagine what it would be like on a clear day!! Definitely go there and have a view."
,,tourism,4.0,,what experience! great views from one of the most iconic identifiers of Singapre. No for the HBP or vertigo clients . You will remeber for ever.
,,Not disappointed - except the food,5.0,,"Wanted to swim in 'that' pool!! That was not disappointing at all! I did think the garden view was nicer than the city one though and they should have had the pool facing that way!! The food was very disappointing though - had one meal by the pool and then didn't want to try anything else in the hotel at all because it was so bad. However the hotel is an awesome place to stay just for its architecture, the views over the Gardens, and that pool!!!"
,,Amazing place and views incredible!,5.0,,"Three restaurants/bars and accommodation above these beautiful three towers with what looks like a ship on top. Beautiful infinity pool right the way along, not cheap especially for drinks but well worth it. Spago in tower 2 definitely the best out of the three. The bay itself also beautiful, Singapore is amazing for sight seeeing."
,,Brilliance overloaded,5.0,,The entire view of this bay and also from Marina bay is totally mind-blowing. A photographers heaven specially who loves to capture cityscapes. Well connected by MRT.
,,Mesmerising,5.0,,"Awesome, cant say anything more. Its once in a life time experience. Must see attraction for everyone who is interested in Singapore"
,,Changed!! from 6 years back,4.0,,ok; nice view; over priced food - and can anyone tell me why a $12 bottle wine costs $98 here? - now you are unbale to use the skydeck and the bar under the ONE ticket....WTH!!???
,,Very high Bar,4.0,,"great cocktail bar , with a sunset view, treated with respect by the staff and can see indonesia and Malaysia from the bar. total excellence and luxury,"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Wonderful views over Singapore from this futuristic building. Go to Sky 57 for views of the Gardens by the Bay and if time sip a cocktail as the sun sets- Awesome
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Very nice hotel with delicious breakfast. Try the swimming pool at 57. floor, with a fantastic view. Very helpful staff."
,,"Views best, can see 3 counties from the top.",5.0,,"We enjoyed few drinks at the 2 establishments at the top and Scott got few pictures with city skyline in the background, it has 3 large pools and they were extremely crowed even though it rained most of the time."
,,be ammazed at hights,5.0,,"This engineering achievement allows you to view Singapore from the sky while your feet is firmly planted. The view from the 57th floor is breathtaking , while sipping on a cocktail. The hotel club is open to visitors and if you are not a hotel resident go treat your self"
,,It was mEEEEhh,3.0,,"For people who want to SG up top,yah it would be great, but I would rather spend money to dine at CE LA VI or Skyon57 than spend money just to walk around up top!"
,,Singapore holiday,5.0,,Marina bay sands was mind blowing view from the sky park which is on 56th floor was awesome you can see whole singapore from there with almost 360* view all the city skyline was awesome only disappointment was couldn't visit at night
,,Good overview of Singapore at night,3.0,,"You can get a birds eye view of this beautiful jewel of a city, full of sparkling lights and shining waters. Its not a must, but if you can fit it in your itenerary, you will enjoy it."
,,Awesome Place,5.0,,I like the serene view from the top. It is really a wonderful marvelous architecture. If you are visiting or going to visit then do not forgot to visit this place. If by any chance try to go to infinity pool.
,,Excellent place to chill,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a fantastic place to chill in Singapore... The unique bar on the 57th floor gives a fantastic view of Singapore...
,,What an amazing view,5.0,,"Singapore’s Sands Skypark at Marina Bay is definitely worth the entrance.
The observation deck thrones 57 levels above ground, on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
There are fantastic views over Gardens by the Bay, the Marina area and the financial district.
There is a restaurant with a terrace as well, so you can even enjoy the view while eating.
Definitely a must go / see when in Singapore."
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,Been here twice but always a breath taking view with infinity pool and 56th floor bar deck...Must visit place whenever thinking of Singapore..Laser show in evening is icing to the cake.
,,Go to Ce La VI instead,3.0,,"Certainly the most iconic views of the Singapore skyline are from the 'ship' on the top of marina bay sands. Unfortunately, access to the infinity pool is reserved for guests only but members of the public can pay 23SD and get access to a viewing platform at the front of the ship known as the skypark. It is a large price but quite a few. A better idea is to go up at night to the Ce La Vi Club lounge, which is literally just behind the skypark. You need to pay ?23SD for a 'drinks voucher' which you can use to purchase a drink (although cocktails at 24SD - ends up being 28SD with the 17% tax, Tiger beers are 16SD or 18.70 with 17% tax). You'll end up paying the same price but getting a drink for your troubles and if you are lucky, as seat with the same view."
,,Amazing.,5.0,,Nice views of Singpaore from the Skypark. Good Location for photos and selfies. One of the tourist attraction.
,,A phenomenal architecture and awesome views,5.0,,"Tried this place after my uncle forced me to come as I was not sure of the view but when i reached the top Lo! what a view !!!!! An amazing sweeping view of Singapore does sweep one of their feet. I was glad I came here. To put the cherry on the top we went to their terrace bar had a few drinks which are reasonably priced for a place like this and enjoyed the view for a couple of hours. A great place to spend a couple of hours.

Below is a lovely mall which had everything from luxury brands, restaurants etc."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,"Went there with wife and child. Price is $23 per adult and $17 for child (age 2+). Most places let my 2 year old for free but not this place. It's an observation deck very small and visit lasted about 5mins. Views are good but not worth the money. Staff are very rude especially the lady at entrance of lift. There are also no pram access. Very disappointed, much better off going somewhere else to spend that money instead of this way way overpriced place."
,,Must visit before you die,5.0,,So beautiful...so beautiful...so beautiful. My wife and I love this place..superrrrr. Mt wife loves me more because I brought her in Singapore!!!
,,Impressive building,4.0,,Depends remotely and basically helps you to orientate. A building that necessarily exists in the photos of every visitor in Singapore
,,"Amazing building, great views",5.0,,"This building is an engineering masterpiece. It is certainly the coolest piece of architecture I have ever seen. If you aren't staying in the hotel you can pay to take the elevator to the observation deck. It was worth the $20 US or so ticket. You get sweeping views of the harbor, beach, city, and Gardens by the Bay. There is a restaurant on top that we did not visit, but it would be a cool spot for a meal."
,,Scotch with a View,4.0,,"Great drinks with a billion dollar view. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. Drinks are pricey, keeping in mind it is Singapore."
,,A bit disappointed,3.0,,"I booked for this attraction thinking that,we would be able to see & get close up & personal with their infinity pool. & somehow capture some nice photos but,i was disappointed.The amount we paid only took us to the 56th floor, the skypark, to see the entire view of Singapore from above. Only the hotel guests (checked-in) can of course wander around & enjoy their famous pool. Better tick this off from ur list if ur after for the pool.."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"This was on our bucket list to try, the evening was nice so it seemed the right time. We were told there was a $20 charge per person to get to the top (non residents) but it transpires that this is credited once you reach the top against food or drink. In effect its free as the whole point it to see the view and have a drink. The view is amazing and there is a live DJ in attendance which adds to ambiance. Drinks well priced, worthwhile visit."
,,Good Views.,4.0,,"Definitely something to cross off the list if you're in the area, the views are stunning - made better if you get some sun with it too."
,,Comfortable hotel,5.0,,Spent five nights in the hotel which is adjacent to the conference hall and to the shopping mall. Amazing view from the top roof where you can have an very nice view of the situation while in the pool!
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"We did a night tour that included the lift up to the observation deck atop the massive Marina Bay Sands hotel complex 57 floors in 50 seconds , whoosh ! Just amazing , loved it . Could see for miles"
,,Luxury and unique!,5.0,,"If you want to see something unique, go to the 57th floor of MBS. Unique pool, great jacuzzis and if you want, a 360 bar!"
,,Wow just Wow,5.0,,What an experience. The minute you see Marina Bay Sands Skypark in view you are just blown away. It towers over everything and you can see it from everywhere. Towells are free at the pool and you can have as many as you like. Service is amazing as is the layout. You will love the view and the whole experience is so impressive.
,,Awesome building,4.0,,One of those things you have to do. The structure is amazing. We went up to the viewing deck ($23 HKD) well worth it. If you go up for 8pm you get to see the light show in the gardens below.
,,Mr. Gazi,4.0,,Awesome Skypark. Unbeatable in the world. Very nice green garden on the top. Nice endless pool in the rooftop. This is an adventure for children.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We have just visited Singapore. Marina Bay Sands Skypark was one of the attractions we visited. For a nominal fee we were escorted into a lift which took us to the top. From there you could see right across and round the city including Gardens by the bay. A gift shop was at the top as well as a restaurant. We went early in the morning so did not have to que as staff informed us that it can get very busy at peak times.
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Great views, but Wow! are you high up! Not a place to linger if afraid of heights, like me, but definitley a must do. Great looking open air bar up there too."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"If you visit nothing else in Singapore, go here the views are spectacular, it is well worth the money. There is no time limit on how long you can spend up there either. Amazing"
,,Breath taking views.,5.0,,"If you don't do anything else, you must go to the top of this unusual building. The views are fantastic. There are places to eat and drink while enjoying picking out the landmarks around the 360 degree view. Take your camera. !!"
,,Very High!,5.0,,Watched the hotel being built eight years ago so we were very pleased to go up to the observation deck an enjoy the view. $20 for seniors and a very pleasant bar for refreshments before descending.
,,"Float like a butterfly, fly like a bird",5.0,,"Being a Singapore resident for well over a decade now, I have had the pleasure of watching the MBS SkyPark evolve into a towering symbol of Singapore's unique ability to reinvent itself.

I remember vividly the days when we used to drive past MBS en route to our office; the three towers and the ship's arc still under construction. And the usual wait of a few months until the obsessive child-like craze of Singaporeans to anything new cooled off, before we attempted our first visit to the place.

Since then I have made numerous trips to the SkyPark with friends and family, including the latest visit in Mar 17 during my son's school break. On each occasion I have never ceased to be amazed with the architectural marvel that the SkyPark is, not to mention the expansive breathtaking views it offers.

The public access deck is built like an arc, on the one side you can see the Gardens by the Bay, in the centre it looks out to the east of Singapore and the other side gives you an intimate feel for the beautiful CBD. They have long since stopped access to the sky pool but the public access deck in itself is so absorbing, that sky pool or not the SkyPark is more than worth a visit.

I would strongly recommend visitors to book for late afternoon and early evening and stay on to watch the sunset. It's a beatific feeling, one that you will savor for a long time."
,,This is a site not to be missed in Singapore,5.0,,"the lobby of the hotel, the shops, the casino, the restuarants and bars and especially the roof top infinity bar are absolutely magnificent."
,,Must see,5.0,,A must see and do in Singapore. The view is breathtaking. If you have a chance stay at the hotel so you can enjoy the world's largest infinity pool!
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Spectacular view over the awesome Singapore skyline and beyond.. gardens, skyscrapers, sea and lots of people up there too..
If you are staying at the hotel then this is free but for outside visitors it is $20 each I think...
Worth a quick visit to say you've been!"
,,Worth place to visit,4.0,,"Best time to visit it just before the lights come on in the evening. Spend time gazing the ocean line of Singapore, Garden by the bays on one side and then the tall towers of the singapore business centers on the other side. Then when the lights are on, it's totally a different view of the Singapore. Also a good place to view the lights and music show of Garden by the bays. But you can only see the lights and hear the music."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Your trip to Singapore is INCOMPLETE if you dont visit this beautiful and iconic landmark.

How to go
=========
Take a taxi or take MRT and get down at Bayfront station. It is nearest from this station.

Follow the signs and you should reach the ticket centre in 7/10 min (leisurely walk).

When to go
=========
Try to reach when the sun is about to set.
That way, you can enjoy the spectacular view during daytime and then follow it up as the lights come on.
Sit and enjoy as the sun sets and the landscape dynamics change in front of your eyes.
Both the views are amazing and not to be missed.

Secret Tip
=========
There are two entrances (lifts) to the Skypark...
1) For Tourists
2) For a restaurant on top called Kudeta

So, if you want to dine at rooftop or enjoy a drink then...use the restaurant lift ( FREE), have your meal or drink and come back.
No need to buy additonal tickets :)

Excellent place for a romantic dinner or a drink or two with friends..

There...I gave a secret tip ;)"
,,58 floors up and you are in the aky,5.0,,"Took the life to the viewing platform 57 floors up. On a clear day you can see to Indonesia but then to see out to sea and ""all"" those ships sitting there waiting to be loaded and unloaded....hundreds of them. Then to look down at the Bay of Gardens, and the Lotus and the Fly Wheel......the list goes on and on."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,"The views are spectacular. You have to get in the pool and swim to the edge of the infinity and check out the view. Wow, especially at night."
,,Whats with a rooftop?,2.0,,"High above the city for sure but not the highest spot (Altitude Bar is higher) in the sweet spot in front of a man made bay.
To pay to access a rooftop and no chance to even access the famous infinity pool sounds wrong to me."
,,Good place to relax,5.0,,"It is so good to just sit here and watch people and tourist passing, walking, jogging, laughing etc. Idk why i like to de-stress here but when u watch everyone it seems like they don't have problems in life just enjoying :D"
,,A great place to view the city.,4.0,,The view from this Sky park is amazing and must be seen to be enjoyed. Words cannot really do justice to this experience. Take the elevator to the ship enjoy the walk around and experience something great.
,,Amazing Building and Views,5.0,,We visited here as part of an evening tour. Great views of Singapore and Marina bay. Recommend visiting in the evening for the night views. Were able to get to the top for viewing but only in part as the pool area etc is for hotel guests only. Amazing architecturally designed building. Well worth the visit.
,,This or the flyer!!,4.0,,"Only really had time for this or the flyer, after reading reviews decided on this, 10$ cheaper than the flyer and you get to spend as long as you want up there, would like to have done both but would guess if you can only choose one this would be the one to see. Great views and not too crowded."
,,Quick visit for the views,5.0,,"The Sky Park is accessible only of you stay at the Marina Sands Bay. I chose to visit later in the evening, which meant fewer people and the city was all lit up. A spectacular view, a must visit."
,,Amazing cocktails,4.0,,We had cocktails here one evening and they were lush. Our group of four tried four different cocktails and they were all amazing. The staff really were attentive and looked after us even taking photos of the group. Oh yes and the view is worth a visit to see the whole city at night.
,,Just to look at singapore skyline,3.0,,"As i stayed on the hotel, the skypark is available for me to visit. Thankfully I'm not tourist who pay to get to the top. Just a quick visit and there's nothing to look at. Just sight on Singapore cbd building and on behind there's Gardens by The Bay to look at"
,,Very good view of Singapore,5.0,,This sky Park gives you a very good view of the Singapore over the Marina Bay. Best time to visit is in the evening at the time of Sunset. Seeing the sunset and then seeing the Singapore starting to glitter is a a great tourist attraction. The cost per ticket is around Singapore Dollar 23. They have a restaurant upstairs.
,,Great View!,3.0,,"This is a architecture wonder! Wonderful view overlooking Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay. I think the tickets are a little pricey to just go up and have a look, should come with a drink or something."
,,Was good but it didnt live up to the hype.,4.0,,"Dont get me wrong I enjoyed having a look from the deck, but unfortunately you only get access to a small portion of the deck above tower 3, would have been nice to have seen the pool that is promoted in all the brochures, even if only from a distance.... apart from that we spent 30 mins there and left."
,,Family Vacation,5.0,,"Great View! This hotel is mostly known for it magnificent view from the top. Went here last year with my family, had lots of fun. It is a must visit."
,,Best view by night,3.0,,"Any tourist in Singapore has to visit this site, but be warned it is very busy and expensive. You have to eat or drink something at the top and there is an entry fee. The view is mind blowing at night with the light show below. I viewed the light show from the gardens on the following night, enjoyed that more. Also on that night the general public were not allowed on the edge, but had to watch from the restaurant. This view was apparently reserved for guests. If it wasn't for the view, I wouldn't bother."
,,great views of the hotel and bay area,5.0,,no views of the infinity pool but worth seeing just for the sheer shininess. The walk is great but do it early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat.
,,awesome,4.0,,Great views from the top overlooking Supertree Grove. A night time visit would be great but lovely in the day time. Felt it was a bit pricy .
,,Must see,4.0,,"We visited the sky park for the views and it's worth it. The hotel itself is massive and the casino/mall attached takes a day to see it all, buts its up top where you see the best views in Singapore.
The skypark lets you walk round one corner giving you fantastic views. It has a small snack stand and souvenir shop.
One level up is a restaurant with better views and seats with shade umbrellas, the sun up at those levels is hot! If your only having a few pics taking then back down, buy skypark pass, if your up for a while to see gardens by the bay light show, book a table and eat, as the skypark has no seating or shade"
,,Visit one time is enough,4.0,,Really nothing much except for the view of Singapore. Infinity swimming pool is always crowded. Food is expensive.
,,"Amazing views, beautiful sunset and a memorable visit",5.0,,"Marina Bay was an amazing experience. It's quality reception, facilities, shops and most of all amazing top deck overlooking Singapore.. Worth a visit all be it a little expensive."
,,Waste of money,1.0,,Not worth paying for access. You are much better to make a restaurant reservation and enjoy the view and decent meal as well.
,,Spago bar view amazing,5.0,,Toured the facility to get a sunset view of Singapore and discovered a great drink menu. Try the Broken Promises while overlooking the Bay.
,,Really awesome views,4.0,,There is nice chilling bar at the top with amazing views. Also nightclub. Must vidit at night to see the amazing views. Drinks are expensive though
,,Skypark Skyview,5.0,,"We actually visited the Skypark twice. First was on an unusually bright sunny day where the views stretched into Malaysia. The sights of the city high rise the massive amounts of ships in the harbour, fighter jets and helicopters coming in to land at the airbase was a great sight. The deck gives ample views and definitely worth the trip and it is very easy to get to. During the day we visited passage to and from the tower was slight and really easy. No waiting anywhere and we were surprised there wasn't more people. The glass walled fences with wire strands above made you feel very safe. We decided to come back a couple of days later to take in the dusk. There was cloud cover this day but the blood red sun broke through the clouds and as it set the colour of the lights, the peak hour traffic, the little ferry boat and those ships at anchor just made a spectacular contrast to the daytime visit we had earlier. Even the nearby golf course was lit up like day and we will have to do on our next trip i reckon. Looking down at the Gardens by the Bay and seeing Supertree Grove lit and dancing from above was wonderful. You could spend quite a bit of time up there. However the evening visit was quite a contrast to the day visit earlier. You had to queue for the tickets, queue for the elevator up, queue for the elevator down and then the taxi. Note there are no seats up there. If you want to rest people sprawled out on the deck or up against the glass viewing walls. It was tough to get a position in some of the popular viewing areas. There is a souvenir shop and refreshment stall there as well. If you present your Singapore Airline Boarding Pass or are a Kris Club member you will get 15% off the standard price of $23 per adult. Another very popular tourist attraction that is worth the effort. And don't forget to stroll through the huge atrium of the Marina Bay Resort and the adjoining Marina Bay shops. (bring plenty of cash with you). Note the ""obigatory"" photo they take of you against the green screen after you buy the tickets are offered to you up the top at S$70 a pop plus access to a download site where you download the images (you are registering for future advertising from Marina Bay sands so there is no way around it). Enjoy"
,,Extraordinary view from top!!,5.0,,"Amazing skypark with an extraordinary view! Skypark area is large enough to accommodate both couples and families with children. Recommend to view all facilities, as the skypark also has some more ""hidden"" features, i.e. Outdoor spas, pepple basins etc."
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore!,5.0,,"Fantastic view of Singapore! It was all breezy since its at 57th floor of the MBS hotel. One will be mesmerized with the amazing views it has to offer of the Central Business District of Singapore, Merlion Park, Gardens by the Bay and Panaromic Ocean views. Visiting during day time and Night time depends on an individuals preference. I would recommend visiting betweeen 6-7.30 PM in the evening to witness one of the fantastic sunsets from the top and the views it has to offer!
P.S. For people staying at MBS hotel, MBS Sands Skypark is complimentary, so do not purchase any extra tickets. For non MBS stayers, ticket price is 25$ per head.
Cheers!"
,,The sky park is great,5.0,,The sky park is great. But to get the full experience you really need to be a hotel guest so you can use the infinity pool. The views are amazing and offer both the city and sea views.
,,Top of MBS,4.0,,"Checked out the observation deck at MBS. It wasn't terribly expensive or busy when I went but the weather was pretty rainy. I tried to wait it out to capture some photos which turned out pretty good. It's quite the view from the top.

There is a small shop that sells some souvenirs at the top.

I stayed for a drink and just enjoyed the view.

Would highly recommend for any first time travellers to Singapore!"
,,Breath taking view,5.0,,"We bought tickets for the bar because everyone we spoke to said the view was the same anyway. We arrived here a little before sun set so that we got to see the view of the city in the day, at sunset and at night without having to come back or stay too long."
,,If you can stay one day here!!,5.0,,"Believe the hype and everything they say about this hotel it is amazing, we stayed all day at the infinity pool and then had a reasonably priced meal at Gordon Ramsey's Restaurant in the mall attached to the hotel. If you are visiting Singapore try and book one night here and spend the day relaxing in the hotel."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"Amazing, stunning and fabulous views. Very romantic too!

The highlight of Singapore, this is a must do.

I would advise to get a ticket to the lounge on the 57th floor which costs $20. But you get a $20 voucher to spend at the bar, so it don't actually cost you anything!"
,,Do not miss the laser show,5.0,,"Worthwhile definitely. If you can have dinner at the restaurant that is up there, do not miss out. You see the entire of Singapore and try to catch the lasershow from up there."
,,Over priced,2.0,,For what you get this is severely overpriced. $S23 for a walk around a tiny portion of the top floor at Marina Bay Sands. 5 minutes and it's all over.
,,Great views,4.0,,"The Skypark offers great views over Marina Bay and the rest of Singapore, as well as across the straits to the south. On a clear day you might even be able to see Indonesia. Be aware that to collect your tickets you'll have to go across to Tower 3 and then down into a basement (It's not as bad as it sounds). From there the lift takes you up pretty swiftly and you can stay up there as long as you like. The standard observation deck ticket doesn't let you into the restaurant or the infinity pool, but there's a small gift shop and some information points. All in all it's quite good value"
,,Vacation with daughter & Friends,3.0,,"Back In 2013 I heard about this hotel a lot and really want to tried , finally I did went to Sin & stay at this hotel for 5 nights !
Hotel Look amazing , and it's stop right there Why ? Because it's a famous place to everyone so people from every where want to stay there then it's become Like a supermarket omg so noisy , breakfast was bad , we booked 1 suite and 1 standard room , for some reason The standard room ( the bathroom was so smelly sting ) we complains everyday day sent staff came back and clean again but only 2 hours later it's stated to smell again , we wanted to change room but they said was fully booked ! We were very disappointed of everything there from pool to service and from entrance walk to lift was a bit far ! The hotels had too many room therefor the service had drop Bad service , guests were loud and most of them I guessed from country town come to the city want to see what the hotel look like , the hotels becomes down graded to me you won't feel like a classy 5 stars at all ! Sorry I will never stay there again ! Hotel look very nice that's all I can say not best location either !
Room smell make my daughter kind of sick she was staying with her cousin ( poor 2 young teen for the trip )"
,,Wonderful Singapore skyline view at night,4.0,,Used to be free but there is a SGD 20 charge now to get up to the viewing deck. Best time to visit is on a clear night...in the evening as there are light shows in the Bay Gardens at 7.45 and 8.45 pm...that just adds to the atmosphere. The view of the skyline with all the lights is really great. A one-off experience at that top of this unique Marina Bay Sands hotel is well worth it.
,,Excellent place but a bit too crowded when we came so it is only very good.,4.0,,"You get a nice view of the city of Singapore. There were lots of people there , I think it is too crowded, perhaps they should allow only pre-booked people so they could control the numbers."
,,What a view,5.0,,"An amazing view from the 57 th floor of this tower. Great ambience, food and beverages. A definite visit for a fantastic view of the bay, the port and skyline"
,,An impressive view,5.0,,"They have definitely maximized their revenue potential by charging you separately to visit the Skypark (S$23) and Ce La Vi/infinity pool (S$20 which can be used to purchase a drink at the bar), but nevertheless, at the end of the day, it is worth it if you want to have a spectacular view of Singapore from above."
,,Incredible views,5.0,,This was one of my favourite things about our trip. The hotel itself is absolutely bewildering in size and grandeur. You will never see any other hotel like this.
,,Fly-high Skypark,4.0,,"Located at the very top of the hotel, it gives you full panoramic view of the Marina bay, Supertree and the epic city scenic view. Worth going if you stop by marina bay Sands hotel"
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Great room, nice experience, the pool is awesome and all the open space as well. i just don t recommend to stay there for many days because it's a huge place and the price not worth."
,,Awesome Views of the City :-),5.0,,"We transiting through Singapore for 5 hours and we went to the skypark for views, drinks and food. It is not cheap, however well worth it !!!!! AWESOME!!!!"
,,I preferred the view from the flyer,3.0,,I think it's quite expensive to go up and while it gives a great view I do not think it was worth it- especially when it was no queue to get up but to get down I had to wait ages (though I did go after the super tree show). I should also add that I am not a huge fan of going up tall buildings to see the view as have done it an awful lot...
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,This is one of the great places in Singapore. The entrance is not very expensive and the view very beautiful.
,,What a view! Pricey to enter but it is a special view of Singapore.,5.0,,"When the weather is great, this is a fantastic place to hang out enjoy a cold beverage and look at the spectacular view. I am glad we got to see this perspective!"
,,Overrated,3.0,,"This place is really overrated for the view you get as compared to the price you pay for it. It's just a deck where you go and watch the city view, might as well do it on the flyer"
,,Go both during the day and at night,4.0,,"What a great way to Singapore, but you really need to go at dusk to see Singapore both by day and by night. It can get quite crowded, but it is well worth the wait."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Well worth the cost to stand at the top of this hotel and admire the views, not for the feint hearted if you don't like heights. We were disgusted at the price they wanted to charge for a photo of us with a superimposed backdrop, not surprised that there were not many takers, so beware."
,,THE place to see Singapore from,5.0,,"Having a few drinks atop the Marina Bay Sands really is a great experience. The views are amazing. Yes, it is expensive for a beer at $25, but it is worth it for the experience. I will definitely go again, next time in the dark!"
,,What a rip off,3.0,,We had one day to spend in Singapore before picking up a cruise and were told not to miss the Skypark. We were very disappointed to find that it was the equivalent of £20 to go up in the lift but paid up. My husband has difficulty walking and when we got up there it was quite a small area with nowhere to sit and no shade and the temperature was in the nineties. On walking to the other end I discovered a restaurant but we were not allowed in as we were not guests of the hotel and my husband was not even allowed to sit down. The view was nice but certainly not worth the money
,,master location,5.0,,"you can consider this is the most beautiful place you must visit in Singapore. like magic , you can visit morning or at night."
,,Lovely view of Singapore,4.0,,"We had been advised to go to the top level for an good view of the Bay and surrounding city view and enjoy a drink in the open top bar/restaurant. We paid around $20 each to go up in the lift and although we were impressed with the view, the restaurant was not open to the public as it had been raining and they were busy cleaning. The result was that we waited around hoping to sit and admire the view but they finally decided not to open to the public only hotel guests. This was very dissapointing as there were no seats anywhere on the top level for visitors to enjoy the view. It felt like we had wasted $40 just to go up in a lift."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Near with merlion park, you can access in same time, nearly area with public transport and best place for visit"
,,great view - expensive drinks,4.0,,we skipped the full observation deck and went for the drink option - it does not give you access to the whole deck just the restaurant portion it is outside however - you pay $20 to go up and it gives you a $20 credit in the restaurant. Now $20 won't cover the cost of a drink other than a beer or a pop but at least you get to sit and relax over your drink and enjoy the view. It was very hot and there is no ac outside of course but there is shade
,,It's free!,4.0,,"Hear view of Singapore harbour, close to super tree grove and the whole visit costs nothing! Highly recommended!"
,,An awe inspiring building,5.0,,"Easy to get to and a marvel to behold. You can walk into the main hotel which is amazing, don't bother paying to go up to the main viewing deck, lots of possibilities which are free. Just an architectural paradise!"
,,It's fun at the top at the bar,5.0,,"Great views, awesome cocktails and great food. I was surprised how much I enjoyed my visit to the top of this hotel. I've only been once, but I will definitely return on my next trip."
,,A bit over priced,2.0,,"My husband and I visited the sky park during our stay in Singapore. We had earlier in the day been on the Singapore flyer and found the skylark a big let down. The cost the go to the observation deck was the same price as the flyer and I felt as though the flyer offered more as a tourist attraction.
The skylark is literally an observation deck at the front of the Marina Bay sands. There is no food or attractions to see."
,,must go,4.0,,Every evening there is a light show which is outstanding. I booked a table at Super Tree. Good idea for dates. Watch the light show then have dinner at Super Tree and afterwards Cocktails at the rooftop with an epic view of Singapore's skyline
,,Fabulous views,4.0,,"$23 may seem a bit steep but it's worth it for the fantastic views of the city would have been nice to have seen more of the infinity pool, that is for residents only. A must do"
,,Review of the building not the hotel....,5.0,,"We stopped by on a rainy day and went to level 57 for a drink in the bar. We understood access to the top of this building came at a price, although we never saw that. The bar is ver stylish and the staff very friendly and efficient. We sampled (over a couple of visits) the Singapore Sling, Pina Colada, plus the bars own take on both of these drinks. They were fantastic!!

A walk Way around the bar external gives great views of the coastline and city and is ""heaving"" at night. Beers are around $15 and the cocktails we tried are around $28, so although expensive, they are on par with other places.

Lots of other bars and shops on the ground floor and basement levels too. We nipped into the casino (take your passport!) which was disappointing. Lots of very well off people, smoking inside (so a bit smelly) and gambling away at tables, many of which are $100'a bet!!!!

Have to say, if we were staying in the actual hotel, we would have been upset at the number of tourists wandering around, albeit residents only have access to the infinity pool.

Well worth a visit and highly recommended"
,,Must see,5.0,,"It is a must see attraction in Singapore. Fantastic view and ambient, very romantic. You will pay approx 20 USD for a cocktail but it is worthwile"
,,ok,3.0,,Not great experience. Nothing special as now a days there are multistory buildings are common in all cities. Only Dubai Burj Halifax is exceptional
,,Quite a view,5.0,,we went during day light to have a view and waited for the sun set. Excellent view and after sunset we waited for the light show vie of the garden of the bay. It was very cool to watch from the height. A different experience and visual as compared to seeing from the ground.
,,Good view of Singapore on payment of $23,4.0,,This place is located in the Marina Bay sand area. This park is on 57th floor of an iconic tower. The ticket price is Singapore Dollar 23 for each adult.
,,Lovely hotel,5.0,,Didn't stay at this hotel but did take the public lift to the top. Lovely views. Worth going just to see the hotel
,,Good way to see the city,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Skypark was amazing. As we stayed at the hotel it made going to the Skypark very easy. I am not sure about the prices for visiting the skypark. It should be done if you have the time.
,,Been there done that...TICK,4.0,,"Your in Singapore, if you're not staying in this hotel you have to visit, just to appreciate the amazing architecture. It's $23 , and you can't use the pool or bar , but the view us amazing."
,,Great view!,4.0,,We enjoyed the view at the lounge which is on the 57th floor in stead of 56th floor. We opted for this instead because we were able to get drinks (you are required to buy a $20 voucher) and enjoy the view rather than be on a lower floor and don't get drinks or anything out of it. It's not the most amazing experience attraction but definitely something to check the list being the first time in Singapore.
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"Had visited this along with parents yesterday . Due to Long weekend I Guess it was pretty crowded.
23$ adult ticket . Queues for return lifts were really Long . Once up there it's great views of singapore skyline and the city . Photographs taken by the attraction folks are charged at fifty a piece . Expensive .
There is a small drinks outlet .
Also pls note there is no pool access for SkyPark visitors .
The SkyPark is near to the tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands hotel ."
,,Bay view is heaven 😍,5.0,,"This is a luxury hotel, but open to visitors from 10 am to 6 pm. The rood top observation deck is a heaven. Surrounded with water, this is a place you cant afford to miss. You can take stunning photographs of singapore city from the deck. You will be able to see the Singapore flyer, gardens by the bay, clarke quay etc from the deck.

Awsome place to visit on a sunny day."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"We visited in April and had great views across Singapore from the observation deck and you can see for miles, not surprising as your 57 floors up!

The cost is (Singapore $) $23 for adults.

Well worth a visit, and as it id higher, much better value than the Singapore flyer."
,,Great place - not cheap,4.0,,Well worth a visit. This is an amazing place. But it is expensive as always in Singapore. Easy to get to and very well maintained and organised. Not far from orchid gardens and marina bay sands complex.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I have not stayed at the hotel but have visited the 'Boat on top' twice, once for just the view (well worth it) you will see all round Singapore & another time for dinner in the restaurant on the boat & you will not be disappointed although very expensive, there is an infinity pool but only available to guests of the hotel"
,,Have to see to believe,5.0,,"I saw a documentary about the design and construction of this place a few years ago so had to go and experience it. Not disappointed. You pay $20 SD to go up to the 57th floor but that $ applies to your drink order at the bar. The pool, the views and energy are incredible! If your visiting Singapore, its a must-see!"
,,Opulent,4.0,,"It costs 20 Singapore Dollars to visit the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, but given that this includes the price of a drink at the bar I think it is good value.

Take the elevator to the top and step out to get what may well be the best view of Singapore.

To the south lies the Gardens by the Bay and the sea, and to the north the city of Singapore."
,,Awesome place,4.0,,"A must visit place when in Singapore. The view of the marina bay sands is just awesome. So when you view the MBS, garden at the bay and the flier together in one picture, it just amazing. They all are nearby."
,,Skywalk Marina Bay,5.0,,Excellent views and price is no different than places like the Space Needle in Seattle. Great view of Singapore and the port. Picture is a nice touch. If your lucky enough to get a really clear day it would even be more awesome.
,,Outstanding Views,5.0,,The views from the sky park are outstanding but for an even better view check into the hotel and get into the infinity pool.
,,Touristy and for shoppers,3.0,,"However touristy it is its also great to look at as one of the world's famous iconic modern architecture. It is the Singapore's answer to the Petronas Towers in KL. Lots of shopping at the base of the towers and hotels and the famous infinity swimming pool at the top. No, You can't swim there, unless your a guest.
Food is overpriced here even in the food court.

We came here to seek shelter on one of Singapores rainy afternoons"
,,Excellent view but very expensive,5.0,,We visit this building for the skybar and it was really nice experience. The view was fantastic and amazing. The bar was very nice but it was very expensive
,,Must see,4.0,,Had to visit for the views and too see this spectacular hotel. Had a cocktail while taking in the city. A must see
,,Amazing experience but bit pricey,3.0,,"Amazing experience but bit pricey,There are restaurants on the roof.The scenery is just stunning.The pool is only accessible to hotel guests"
,,Good view of the city,4.0,,You can get good view of the city and gardens By the Bay. I would however recommend instead of paying for a ticket to go there - go to Ce La Vi bar and pay the same amount for drink while enjoying the view - much better offer ;)
,,Swimming from a height over Singapore,5.0,,"The Skypark is for all ages. If not staying at the hotel there is a fee to use the pool. There are restaurants on the roof to eat from and watch the world go by-literally you are so high up here you can feel yourself amongst the clouds and when it is raining or a storm coming the lightening that can be seen up here is amazing. I was thrilled to be up there when the storm was approaching. The pool has a child area to swim in with a lifesaver watching over everyone up in his high chair. There is also an adult pool that children can also use. There are spas on the roof so you can hope in and have a drink and soak up the view. Worth a visit and a swim, You can walk around the roof and see views from all angles, also a floor that is visible to see straight through."
,,The Scenery is a Must,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you have to go here. The restaurants are great but the scenery is just stunning! Do not miss."
,,Amazing building that dominate the skyline,4.0,,The Marina Bay Sands is a hotel of 3 towers connected on the roof by a boat like structure which is actually a swimming pool. The pool is only accessible to hotel guests but for a fee you can visit the observation deck. The hotel can be seen for miles
,,Amazing.,5.0,,It took a while to find the right entrance. The view was amazing from every angel. Would have loved to stay in the hotel as it had a infinity pool showing off Singapore.
,,What a stay,5.0,,"Wonderful Reception staff, great atmosphere , I enjoyed every minute, even my slipping over in the huge bathroom was OK due to me waking up late for my check out and onward trip to the airport"
,,A good advice,4.0,,"Super cool place and an architectural pearl as a building monument.

A ""must-go-and-see"". I always visited the Skybar for the view on 57 flor and not the view-terasse on 56 as that costs you around 12-15$.
Spend the saved money on a nice bottle of wine instead in the Skybar and enjoy the fantastic view, and do come around 5.30-6.00 to be able to enjoy the sunset as well as the cool night-sight"
,,Treat yourself to a drink on top,5.0,,World class hotel and architecture. The view from the top is unforgettable so treat yourself to a sink or two.
,,The Welsh in Singapore,5.0,,We went to the sky park lovely views of the gardens and bay.the cost to o up to the top is 20 dollars per person a bit steep .
,,Night time views great,4.0,,"Went at nighttime and experienced magical views of Singapore gardens by the bay, the port, ships at sea and the city. Really lovely. Spoilt a little bit by the music from the bar/ restaurant on the level above."
,,Must try when you are staying in the hotel,4.0,,Try to go during weekdays if you can and stay in the bars at top - people usually hog the tables for a long time. Must try day and night views to appreciate the experience.
,,Mr,4.0,,Good to see but not a priority. The food court is amazing as is the lake of water lillies. If you're looking for a bit if exercise its a good walk from the CBD and whilst you're there.
,,Good view,4.0,,Good view of the city day and night. Can view the light show of the gardens as well. We stayed at the hotel so this was included in our hotel package.
,,Impressive location,4.0,,"This attraction is rather expensive.
You take an elevator to access the top. Views are amazing but it is very hot there during sunny weather. You can not stay very long. As you can not access the whole roof it is a bit boring. Not really comfortable seats to relax. People sit on the floor."
,,Stunning views,4.0,,Singapore tallest strangest shaped hotel...shopping mall lower floors and lift to the top about 28 Singapore dollars take in the views of the city with a drink..a stunning!
,,Landmark Facility,5.0,,One of the most interesting buildings in the world. World class shopping and restaurants. So many choices. Within walking distance of wonderful gardens. Locals including cab drivers refer to it as MBS. We call it home when we are in Singapore. We have stayed at the more traditional hotels in this amazing city but that was then and this is where it is all happening now.
,,Hmmm,3.0,,"Didn't enjoy all the people on the observation deck, noisy and distracting. Children in the bar area is not cool"
,,A wow experience,5.0,,"Go here just before sunset to understand the architecture and expanse. Once darkness hits, watch the place transform with the gorgeous lights."
,,Marvel,5.0,,What an amazing sight for the eyes. The structure looks excellent and mesmerizing with great aesthetic sensibilities.
,,Rainy day but amazing views,5.0,,"It was a bit wet the day we visited and the observation deck had been closed due to electrical storms. It cleared for a while so we were able to go up, we were the only ones up there! The views are amazing."
,,Amazing views over the city,4.0,,"Amazing views over the city, glass surround makes photos hard though. Could be better signed, but definitely worth it for the view."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a he first time my young son has seen the building and when we pushed his eyes back in all he could say was wow.
It is one of the world's most magnificent pieces of architecture and is set in the most incredible parts of Singapore. Simply amazing."
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,We had a great afternoon snack and a drink while enjoying the sights of the city. There is a charge to go up but we were given vouchers toward our food/drink tab. The view was AMAZING.
,,Better View than the Singapore Flyer.,5.0,,The view is exceptional. We went during the day so we didn't see the lig ht show. We have been on the Singapore Flyer and the Skypark presented a better view. Highly recommend it.
,,"Once, ok",3.0,,"A pool on a bridge connecting three skyscrapers justifies it to visit this place once. You have great views of the city and if you are lucky the sunset makes it all worthwhile. You can observe the tourists preoccupied with posing in the pool to show the entire world how lucky they are. The throngs of people, the post soviet display of bad taste exhibited by visitors from the sphere of influence of that empire and the pushing make it otherwise unbearable."
,,A very business-like place,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands is a very business-like place. It is a huge mall with many shops and restaurants and even has a theatre if you want to go catch a show.
,,"Great by day, even better by night.",4.0,,"A trip up to the sky deck of this stunning building will provide amazing views across the harbour and city. The lift up to the 57th floor is quick and incredibly smooth. We paid $23 for the ride up to the top, which was well worth the money for the amazing views. Our favoured alternative was an evening trip up to the sky bar. The fully redeemable $20 voucher got us to the top of the sands for nighttime views of Singapore that are even more breathtaking that those during the daytime. Looking out at the lights of all the ships in the straits and down on the trees in the gardens, whilst enjoying a lovely drink was memorable."
,,No Show,4.0,,"Apparently they have 8 o'clock water fountain show at the bay. Hundreds of families/ tourists with young kids were waiting there for it but it was no show.. Management should have informed the crowd about cancellation of the show or at least put a notice for information, very disappointed ti waste an hour there."
,,MBS Skypark is awesome,5.0,,I stayed at MBS and went over to chill at night. Private parties are hosted here so check before you go. The view from the top is fantastic.
,,Fantastic Views but Overpriced,3.0,,Certainly the Marina Bay Sands is a spectactular building and the views are amazing. However the entrance fee of $23 to the observation deck is over the top.
,,Great views,4.0,,Well worth a visit to the top even just to say you made it. Some long wait lines and a little expensive just to gain lift access to the roof of the building. That said the views are worth it so must go at least once
,,Views are Amazing But Not worth The Money,5.0,,Stayed here for Two Nights yes some great views but that's about it you just get your eyes ripped out S$14.00 for a bowl of french fries
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"It was an amazing experience. We had stayed their with our kids aged 5 & 8. We all enjoyed our stay there. Friendly staff. Amazing view. First class rooms and outstanding service. Roof top pool which is open 7-11, has a breathtaking view. The MRT is at the basement, and a massive shopping complex and eateries all within the hotel, just a walk away. We had a great time."
,,Five days first leg of my 55 day tour of the Far East,5.0,,I booked one night on a sky suite at the marina bay sands on our last night which allowed us to access the sky park freely. Loved it the burs is just breathtaking day and night . Loved it
,,Amazing to be up in the sky at a resort,5.0,,The resort in the sky is beautiful! We ate at Spago as a way to get to the sky park - the food and views were great. The price for afternoon fare was fantastic- we did not have cocktails - and this was a much better way to view the top than the observation deck. If you only want views go to the wheel and you will get better views.
,,View where to chill after work,5.0,,"The place to see Singapore, also the place to be! Very nice view to enjoy sunset listening to Singapore pulse ....easy access through the Hotel impressive entrance (easy meeting point)"
,,Drinks on High,4.0,,Spectacular views of Singapore. It was worth going but next time I think I would just visit the bar and pay for drinks rather than pay to go up the elevator to look at what can be seen from the bar!
,,Best views during night time from the skydeck !,4.0,,"First things first .. if you have already seen Burj Khalifa in Dubai, this place May not enthuse you. But it's beautiful to see skyline of Singapore from the top of skydeck. It's better you book tickets in advance to avoid standing in queues during peak tourism time of Singapore."
,,Amazing city views,5.0,,We just had to take a ride to the top to see the amazing views of the city. The price of riding to the top bar can be used to buy a drink. The drinks are pricey but you have to see the views of Singapore from the Skypark at least once!
,,Fab cocktail bar with a view!,5.0,,Recommended by my son to go here and wasn't disappointed. 57th floor with a bar and great outside seating area wiith superb views.
,,Amazing architecture and view,4.0,,"Really amazing the way defined and designed, crossing and connecting Marina Mall, MBS and offering a great view to all surrounding in that area from 5th floor of those Buildings. Free and accessible to everyone.."
,,The Best Views In Town!,5.0,,"Don't miss this experience - at around £18 each, it's worth it. You can stay up there as long as you like, but 45 minutes to an hour will probably suffice. The view is superb & if you crane your neck, you'll get a quick view of the spectacular infinity swimming pool of the hotel, which isn't as big as it looks from the ground.

Take a cap or sun hat though, as it gets really hot up there."
,,Wow it's High,5.0,,"Get the special lift to the top and wait for the stunning views of the City and beyond.

Forget you are at the highest level and that the ""boat"" perched on this level has nothing beneath its front and rear ends!

It's a must do for the views."
,,China town in the sky!,4.0,,"Excellent bar area with fantastic views, but as you can imagine like most tourist hot spots you may find 6000 Chinese tourists also enjoying the view with there 12000 selfie cameras, having just exited there 60 coaches. So all good, much fun all round and worth a go!"
,,Marina Bay with Family in March 2016,4.0,,"Good place to killing time with looking for a food and shopping, MRT station located in the Marina Mall"
,,OMG you are high in the sky,5.0,,"A must do at nighttime to witness the glittering lights from high above everything else in Singapore. It is so I high I felt like I was up in the sky like looking through the window of a plane. It was exhilarating. We went right to the top bar and had as you guess a ""Singapore Sling"" a brilliant one at that. The bar was abuzz! Don't miss this thrill we loved it."
,,Excellent panorama view,5.0,,Views from the top of tower are excellent. You can see Merlion park and other attractions around there. The bay were full of ships. It was great to go there on a sunny day.
,,one of the best hotels,4.0,,"just a small cautionary note - there is a refurb programme currently underway so limited access to the rooftop restaurants. having said that its great to visit the very top, views are amazing and you can get drinks. there is a charge for going up $S20 but you get a voucher for $S20 so if you buy a drink then it gets offset making the lift free - not well explained but thats how it works.if you stay at the hotel so much more available to guests beyond what the public gets access to - highly recommended"
,,On top of Singapore,4.0,,"Being this close to the rich and beautiful people on top of the Marina Bay Sands was great. For a first timer to Singapore this is the way to get a good look at how big and beautiful it is. On the Skydeck you get an almost 360degree view, from all the ships waiting in the bay to the Formula 1 circuit through to the city skyline; you take it all in from up there. The only thing I would say is do not go in the middle of the day, it is so hot as there is no place to get out of the sun. I would recommend either go early in the morning when it opens or later in the after and then go to the Light Show at the Super Trees."
,,City Skyline,4.0,,"One of the most attractive the Skypark has would be a unobstructed view of the whole central district. With almost no other high-rise building to block, you are able to view the sunset in full glory. I do recommend going at sunset, or later in the night when the lights of the city start coming alive for a different view of the central district as compared to its day life."
,,On a par with other 'high' lights,3.0,,"The views are unmistakably great but I felt similarly awesome views could be found from other attractions as well without as much expense/more to the other attractions. There weren't as many people as I thought there'd be but maybe the prices had something to do with that. That said, if your time is limited it does give you a feel for what makes Singapore tick."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Amazing architecture. Crowd puller. Don't wait till late to go. Better to go a bit earlier - around 4 or 5 pm.
,,The view is amazing ! Specially at the sunset,4.0,,"Many are the spots to see cities from the hight and that one is some that worth the visit.
The price is not so cheap just to look around, the bar doesn't have enough room if you arrive without reservation but the sunset was amazing !
The architecture is awesome !
* Tip: from the gardens, stare the building from bellow... equally interesting."
,,Great views but that's about it.,3.0,,Went to have a look at the view from the sky park which was quite amazing. We found that the process of buying tickets and then getting up to the skypark was a bit too much. Our tickets were checked 4 times before even reaching our destination at the top!! They also tried to make us take a photo in front of a green screen before heading up the lift to buy of our experience. I find this a bit false and maybe suggest doing this actually on the sky park platform to make it more real. The view was great but there were a lot of people sitting around the edges which Made it hard to walk around. It was also a bit overpriced.
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,We visited this after Gardens by the Bay. You enter around the back of Tower 3. Fairly pricy but not crowded and lovely views.
,,ITS A LIFE TIME ACHIVEMENT,5.0,,"You will not believe your eyes what you see here. Its little costly affair but its worth spending. Go in evening around 7.30 p.m and wait there till 9.30 p.m. or till the time security tells you that ""now will be closed"".

Skypark is on 56th floor. View from top is mesmerising. Sit near the glass, take a coffee and chips on the deck ( around six dollar) and enjoy the life."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Well worth a visit to the top of the building and view the skyline of Singapore. Plenty of great photo shots to be had. There is a cafe and shop on the top, although you are only limited to part of the rooftop. A fair price at around £12 pp."
,,Skip it and go elsewhere,3.0,,"Not going to lie. We were in line for this and found there was a $20something cover fee per person and walked away only to come upon a sign for SPAGO by Wolfgang Puck. On level 57 with the same views and NONE of the cover fees. Using the money we saved, we drank some well made cocktails and enjoyed the view from our comfy seats. Yes, you can walk around and take photos. Lovely casual place."
,,It dominates an otherwise impressive skyline,5.0,,"What a great place to spend your day. Have lunch on the 57th floor for the view and to cash in on your vouchers to get up there, then check out the mall....talk about upscale and what a great way to beat the heat and humidity outside. If you get tired of shopping, take in the Casino, or a movie or the nearby harborside attractions."
,,Superb,5.0,,"A special experience and sensibly priced considering your admission counts towards any drinks you may wish to purchase.
A little bit of luxury with expansive views of the Singapore skyline and beyond.
Extremely calming and serene to wile away some time in this wonderfully vibrant and friendly city.
Highly recommended."
,,exciting,5.0,,i had stayed in the hotel and it provide the amenities that i need as well as the facilities that make me accompanied when i'm bored. MUST GO!!!
,,Good view,5.0,,It is a place that overlooks the city of Singapore. Including Merlion. The key symbol here. Include a new garden With height The above is very chewy. But unfortunately not the hotel guests. This bar can not be used at the top.
,,Good view,3.0,,"A good view of Singapore, although fairly hazy the day we visited. A lot of people sit on the ground, as no seating is provided and this can make it a bit difficult to get access to the edge. You can stay as long as long as you want, but my family were bored in less than 30 minutes!"
,,Worthless setup,1.0,,"Hotel guests can only access pool, the cost of 23$ Singapore are to visit the observation deck only."
,,"Tall trees, huge swimming pool, bars and restuarants 57 floors up in the sky!",5.0,,"You won't believe it! How could this be real? Simply mind-boggling, that's what comes to mind. Carefully designed and well presented with spectacular views of the city and sea."
,,Beautiful view ✓Face of Singapore [Roof Top Bar],5.0,,"It's really awesome place ,You can get a beautiful view of Singapore city , Please prefer to go in Night or Evening time bcuz you can see the laser shows on the bay from the top of the building that's really cool laser show and Fantastic view of sea with all ships and you can get a view of Singapore port also .. It's really awesome place for couples ..But people who are afraid of heights or people who got any heart problems better to don't go .. It's a
57 levels above the heart of the city as you capture the moment of a lifetime at the stunning Sands Skypark public observation deck and you can Relax in utmost luxury at the world's largest rooftop Infinity Pool, sipping champagne and looking out over the breathtaking city skyline....Just Enjoy the view ..

Charges: 25 SGD per person ..I guess"

,,A must do,5.0,,"All together a very good experience and not snobbish at all!!

We spend the last night of our Asia trip here and it was worth every cent.

Very pleasant customer service. We got late check out, since we had very late check in. Very good service, which we appreciated.

Great view. Great pictures from the top. Cool bar at night.
Super breakfast. The best breakfast we had during our trip. Very service minded waitresses.

Teens loved it.

Nice large rooms with great bathtub.

The place is too ""touristic"". Great for a night or two, but for longer stays I would choose a different hotel in the neighborhood."
,,superb location...good view,4.0,,"best location to view and make some photo work , u you will get awesome experience here ....casino also available, walking street , relaxing places , flyer is walk able distance , gardens"
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"Very friendly staff who give you the attention you deserve when you get in. The views and atmosphere is just spectacular. If you do visit, I do hope Athibas, his very attentive!!"
,,Views are good,3.0,,"You only go for the views. If you can get into the bar it's worth it, as you get drink included. Not much to do if it rains though!"
,,Evening trip,5.0,,"We chose this as one of our must see on our trip to Singapore and it didn't disappoint. Ok you aren't treated as well as someone who is staying there but you are in Singapore so everyone is pleasant, they can't help it. If you are on a trip then I think this is a must see just the size and the sheer craziness of it all and what a view especially if you go at dusk."
,,A VERY GOOD ATTRACTION BUT EXPENSIVE,4.0,,We went to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark but unfortunately my daughter had a fall just after we arrived. The staff were excellent and produced a first aid pack for us. From what we saw this is a very good attraction to go and see the whole city of Singapore.
,,Holiday,3.0,,Visited the roof top garden as not a hotel resident could not visit whole roof so couldn't see swimming pool or trees properly but views were excellent
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,When the rain finally stopped we got our trip to the 56. Floor. Fantastic view of Singapore. Expensive but highly recommended.
,,Top spot top price,4.0,,"Has to be done when visiting Singapore, fantastic view & enjoy a cool beer or two. Forget the price you are in Singapore 😄"

,,Beautiful City View,5.0,,We visited at night and the view was amazing. The building itself is an architectural wonder. This is worth the time and money!
,,The Top of the Marina Bay,5.0,,"You have to buy a ticket to go to the top to see the infinity pool. Once you have bought your ticket you have to go straight in and cannot go out and in again on the same day. The infinity pool can be seen from either side but unless you are a hotel resident you cannot get by the pool. There are several bars and restaurants on the top. The laser show at 8pm was not very good to see from the top, better to go down to ground level."
,,Nice City View,5.0,,That's place a nice panoramic view of Singapore city. I really love it. I recommend you to take picture with panorama mode so you will get the best photo.
,,A bit overrated and Not worth the price,3.0,,"At about S$25 per head entrance fee, you get to go up an elevator, take some pictures of the view, which is OK, and come back down. All done in 30 minutes. Easy money for the Marina Sands people!

You won't see that fabulous infinity pool, and you are limited to one side of the building. So it's not a 360 view.

So unless you are really fond of views from high places, I think admiring the ship-like architecture from a distance is fine."
,,Roof top marina bay,5.0,,The best views in Singapore for sure. About busy on the top. Pools over crowded for me. Beautiful non the less. Lots of good restaurants to choose from.
,,Sure luxury,5.0,,"I love the wide streets the attention to detail and the over all experience.
It's one of my favourite places for dinning and shopping. But also for just a stroll. During the day you have the bridges and heat of the day.with the kiddies. But at night, leave your babies at home. And party it up. For thats when Marine Bay Sands comes to life. It some of the best night clubs in the world. And don't worry, there's no joining fee. Plus ladies be on the look out for ladies night, it's well worth a visit."
,,Nice View,4.0,,"Enjoy the clear night view with a paying amount on the ground floor of the hotel or if you are staying in the hotel, it is inclusive on the usage of the pool. Get yourself a nice drink on the side pool and you are able to bring down your drinks to the pool and to the view. Amazing view. Tips: avoid the rain."
,,THE TOP IS AWESOME,5.0,,"I did not stay at the Marina Bay but did take a walk through and go up to the top for nice views and picture taking. The hotel is great everything so neatly arranged.
The ride up to the top floor was so smooth, I never felt like I was moving. Then the door opened. The view at night was just breathtaking....just awesome. The lights over Singapore were radiantly shining and so romantic. If you take a trip to Singapore this is a MUST TO SEE!!!"
,,Oversted,3.0,,"Nice views from the top. Pool access to hotel guest only. Bored after 5 mins nothing to do up there except visit the over priced restaurant. About $23 Singapore dollar per ticket. Ridiculously expensive.
I feel it's better to look at MBS because the view u get from the top can be seen from the Singapore flyer (big Ferris wheel) too. Or if you do the skywalk in the gardens by the bay that's better and much prettier at night when all the lights come on."
,,fantastic photo opportunity,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and had access to the Skypark, where we enjoyed a unique spot to have break kfast. The views from the pool are amazing."
,,Great View,3.0,,"Easy entrance and payment. You get hassled by the photo people before going up in the lift and then also when you get out of the lift. They can be pushy. We went at night expecting to see the light show. Light show was late so we had to wait over 45 min which was disappointing. Great views, was it worth it, not sure but can say we did it."
,,Romantic dinner destination,5.0,,Went to Spago to celebrate 50th birthday. Great food with an amazing view of Singapore. One of the best places to enjoy sunset in SIngapore!
,,Towering work of wonder,3.0,,We just saw this from outside the moment we stepped out of the train station and boy was it breathtaking! A true SG icon!
,,Excellent City View,4.0,,"Very nice panoramic view of the city side and the Singapore flyer. You can take a few clicks at the top. You will find their photographers clicking to superimpose and give you a pricey family pic, but okay you can get one frame as a...More"
,,G&T in the rain,5.0,,Wow what an experience! Stunning views over Singapore from 57 floors up. Looking out over the Gardens at the Bay and farther to the literally hundreds of boats waiting to cone into harbour. The view over the city was awesome too. The bar was busy...More
,,Great views across Singapore,5.0,,"The Skypark is well worth a visit. Not the tallest building in Singapore, but it does has superb views."
,,Great view,5.0,,"MBS has great modern stylish architecture. A must hot spot / visit. Go up to the skypark for a great view over Singapore, the Bay and CBD district."
,,Stunning,4.0,,"The view from the top is stunning. It takes your mind off the price to ride the elevator to the top. The bar area was crowded even though it was a Thursday night. Unless you are fast, you will not get the hotly sort after...More"
,,Amazing and must see,5.0,,"Day trip to sky park to checkout what makes people give high rating about this place. At the end I agreed with these comments: impressive clean and high tech garden, services are good. Plenty things to buy at souvenir store."

,,Good for photos,3.0,,Entrance fee of about USD 14 if you want to have a drink at the bars. It's a refundable voucher for drinks. Difficult to get a seated spot at the bars in the afternoon or evenings. But it's a must-do if in Singapore for the...More
,,Great experience,5.0,,We totally loved it. Although it's half the height of Burj Khalifa it was worth it and the dining experience up there in the open is one of its kind.
,,Not a 360 view,3.0,,"I expected a lot from the view I'll be seeing atop the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. To my dismay, the view is only limited to the one facing the Gardens by the Bay. the other side of Singapore is closed which houses the huge infinity pool for the guests. We went up here at night time, which is perfect since its not hot."
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,"Breath-taking. Worth a visit by every traveller and local alike. Best spot for photos. Drinks are pricey, so unless you have to, save your throat for a local delight somewhere else."
,,The best view ever,5.0,,Visited the Skypark observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands hotel yesterday. Going as soon as it opened was beneficial as there were not many people in the ticket queue. Views from the top were breathtaking and memorable.
,,Fantastic views – but do your homework,4.0,,"For non-hotel guests, there appear to be at least a couple of options, so do your homework. Apparently you can get to a particular bar at the top, or as we did, take the level 3 lift to the large cantilevered open deck area. It seems you can’t go from the open deck to the bar area without going back down and buying a separate ticket. (Seems a bit silly). We didn’t pre-purchase tickets on-line – just turned up during a weekday, when there were fewer people. The views are truly amazing. Because we lingered here for a long while to take it all in (and to take lots of photos) we’re glad we chose to do this instead of the Flyer. Be aware that the area is completely open ie there is no shelter from rain or the intense sun. No seating either. Were it not for being corralled into a seemingly obligatory photo shoot at the level 3 lift, then being pounced upon to buy a particularly expensive photo pack when alighting from the lift at the top (polite staff simply doing their job), we would have given this attraction an “Excellent” rating."
,,Breathtaking view!,5.0,,"Brought my godparents to the iconic Marina Bay Sands Skypark last Sunday. They totally enjoyed it even though it was very hot and sunny that day.
The view of the city, the Gardens by the Bays, the harbourfront and the city skyline was absolutely breathtaking.
A good place to tourist visit and see the skyline of Singapore."
,,Awesome Views - Well Worth The Effort,4.0,,"We decided to combine visiting the Flyer, Bay Sands Skypark and the Flower / Rain Forest Domes over the course of one day and were very glad we did. The Skypark is so iconic its a must do if you're in the area.

For non-residents of the hotel access is limited to the viewing area at the 'bow' end where there is also a small souvenir shop, soft drinks outlet and up one level a restaurant and bar.

The swimming pool up there can be seen from the viewing platform but is only accessible to residents of the hotel.

Once up there the views are fantastic. From the number of ships moored just off the coast to the Formula 1 pit lane below and the other attractions viewed from above.

Well worth the time to visit."
,,Nighttime 360 degree Rooftop view,4.0,,"The top of this hotel has an amazing view of the entire harbor and city of Singapore! Plus if you time it right, go down to the sidewalk at 9pm and see the amazing laser light show for free!"
,,Incredible!!!,5.0,,To have a panoramic view of the city with its lights on is so incredible! It's an experience that everyone visiting Singapore should do. A must in Singapore!
,,Worth the money?,3.0,,Yes the views are even better than the Flyer but the price is a bit steep to just go have a look. Maybe try later in the day and have a drink that is if it's not raining.
,,Lunchtime Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Worth a visit for the spectacular views, was not over crowded at 12 midday. Fabulous Singapore sling, entrance fee of 20 sd taken off purchase of drinks."
,,Fantastic view- impressive!,4.0,,"I was debating whether to go on the flyer or take my friends to the Skypark. Very pleased I decided to go here as there was more time to take photos.

Great views. Quite expensive though. I wanted to go to Ku Te Da to have lunch but Unfortunately it was closed for refurbishment.

Worth going as a tourist"
,,Amazing,5.0,,So amazing! We went during the day. We seen everything! It was stunning! Apparently if you enter through the restaurant they do deals for tickets and food
,,Incredible view but too much crowded,4.0,,The view was great. I love to stay not too much crowd like this but the view it very expensive and stunted me. Staff was nice.
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,"We visited the skypark early evening so we could grab a spot to see the Light Show of the Supertrees. Pay $20 for entry but you get this back with a purchase of a drink at the bar. This is such a beautiful place to be. Great atmosphere, pleasant music and great views. Although you can't get in, it is right next to the famous infinity pool and at least you get to see it. We loved it. We managed to stay for a few hours just relaxing, had a couple of drinks and watched the light show. You can also see the water light show in front of Marina Bay Sands, although I think this show would have been better viewed at street level. It does get very busy so if you want to see the view by night visit about 6pm and stay for a few hours. Cocktails are $24 + 17% ($28.25) but are delicious."
,,A view of Singapore.,5.0,,"Want to see the beauty of Singapore? You better check out this amazing place. Not only you can have the best view of the area, you can also relax and hang out here with family or friends. Take amazing pictures and make memories. There's also a gorgeous restaurant here that you would not want to miss."
,,Amazing views poor service,3.0,,"The views from the infinity pool are hard to beat. Nevertheless, its usually too crowded which makes it difficult to enjoy. Staff are not helpful at all, try to find a sunbed but it was mission impossible, staff didnt even bothered to help. Not what i would i expect froma hotel where you pay that much for a night."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"Opted to take the elevator to the 57th floor bar rather than the viewing deck at the 56th floor. Had an equally spectacular view for $3 less and offset the elevator cost against our food and drinksv.
The view as the sun went down and the city lights came alive was spectacular. A must do on any visit to Singapore."
,,Fantastic views at a price,5.0,,"The Skypark should be on your must do list. Tickets cost $20SGD and the express lift will whisk you up to level 56 in less than a minute. The area available to non hotel residents is comparatively small but the views across the city are quite stunning especially at dusk as all the city starts to light up. The area is sometimes cleared if lightning is expected. There is a gift shop and light refreshments available, this attraction is accessible to less able visitors. Most of the Skypark is inaccessible to non hotel residents which is understandable but nevertheless a pity. If possible I would recommend visiting during the daytime on a clear day (be advised it can be relentlessly hot during the day as there is very little shade cover) as well as a night visit."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Went to the top and had a some coffee as watched sunset, this place is incredible, if I am not mistaken it's on the 81st floor..the lifts are extremely fast...but you got to pay to get to the top.
The swimming pool is awesome and you feel at the top of the world.
You can literally see the entire Singapore from the top.
Jabir."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,One of the most iconic buildings in Singapore With views of the whole city Make sure it's a clear day
,,One of the best views in the world.,5.0,,No matter how many times you see it the view - particularly at night - will take your breath away. Expensive to do anything at MBS but well worth the money for the view.
,,Average !,3.0,,"Great views but bit expensive for what it is really. We wanted to have a coffee at the bar - wasn't allowed - asked if we could have a drink then advised we would have to go back down and buy another type of ticket.
Views do show good all round view of city though !!!"
,,Good view but expensive for non-hotel guest,3.0,,"There are a couple of options to visit the sky park as a non-hotel guest. You can pay to just see the skypark or you can pre-pay $20 SGD to get to the restaurant (Ce La Vie) where the money can be used toward food or drinks. We opted for the later so didn't get to go to the edge of the roof, but we're still able to enjoy the view. While the view was good I didn't think it was worth the time or the money on our short vacation."
,,What a view!,5.0,,We had drinks at the bar at the top. The view of Singapore was amazing. The drink menu was creative. Each of us got a different drink and everyone was happy with their choice. The MBS bar is a nice place to spend an evening.
,,Breathtaking view but comes at a cost,5.0,,"My husband and I visited this bar and were not disappointed, arrived just before sunset and watch the sun go down.....truly breathtaking!! One of these things you do once, it costs 20 Singapore dollars to go up each (acts as a voucher in which you get it off your purchases). The drinks are so so expensive but kind of expect it as a cost for the amazing atmosphere and views. Well worth a visit!"
,,Manmade beauty,5.0,,This building looks awesome. A must to take pictures with. It is next to the Gardens By The Bay so plan it with the gsrden visit.
,,"Great views, sadly that's it...",2.0,,"We had high hopes for this attraction but felt a little let down.
The cost is $23 (Singapore) which I think is reasonable and getting to the entrance in tower three is fairly straightforward and well sign posted.
Once there you are then coralled into the mandatory photo booth which I find rather annoying and I would assume queue generating at busy times, though apart from a money maker may serve to control the movement of people to the lifts.
The lifts themselves are speedy taking only a matter of seconds to ascend to the 57th floor where you are already greeted by the friendly eager staff wanting to sell the photos taken only minutes earlier.
Once outside there is a largish U shaped deck area allowing fantastic panoramic views of three sides of the city and that really is the only positive I can report.
You will find a souvenir shop selling drinks and snacks but there is no free seating and despite signs asking you not to sit on the floor you don't really have a choice unless you choose to visit the ridiculously expensive bar upstairs which having done so you are then forced to exit by descending one floor to re-enter the Skypark?
So to sum up, if you want spectacular views this is for you, if you want more you may be disappointed."
,,wheelchair accessible,4.0,,The view of Singapore from the Sands Skypark is great. The tickets desk and general elevator is down an escalator. Someone needs to go down to purchase the tickets and then staff escorts wheelchair users to an elevator on 1st floor to go up to the observatory level.
,,A bit expensive,3.0,,"Great view on the city and on the sea.
Best is to go there, when the sky is clear blue... not always the case, under equator, but ... it's a must to benefit the whole view.

A bit expensive, though, and only a small part is accessible to the public (not staying in hotel)."
,,"Great views, and a hotel reminiscent of Las Vegas",4.0,,"During a recent stay in Singapore, we paid to visit the rooftop viewing and dining area of the hotel. The view was magnificent, over all of the city, and far out to sea. There's a huge infinity pool up there too, but only open to hotel residents. We had lunch, which wasn't over-priced, and the service was good. I was surprised to see the number of large ships just off Singapore, I counted over 100, plus many smaller ones. It shows what a financially successful place Singapore is. So - if you like good views, and are prepared to shell out a bit over £10, take the lift up to the roof of this extraordinary hotel. The hotel itself is pretty amazing, constructed of three huge towers, each shaped like a pair of playing cards propped up against each other (apparently that was the architect's inspiration), with what looks like a ship perched on top! The towers are hollow, with the hotel rooms attached to the inside of the walls. (The Luxor hotel in Las Vegas, modelled on a giant pyramid, is the same). There are restaurants, luxury boutiques, a high walkway across from the Gardens by the Bay, and deeper in the shopping complex (which they call ""The Shoppes""), a canal with sampans you look down on from on high. So well worth a visit, and maybe even a night's stay, to use the infinity pool, but a quick online check shows that would be £300+ per night."
,,ONE OF A KIND MUST SEE,5.0,,"Definitely one of a kind, one of those things you got to see. Really a marvel and super vistas. Fun place in a fun city."
,,wow and more wow,5.0,,"its a majestic place for sure, the views from the top are amazing. clean well maintained and lots of variety in foods and drinks. A must see"
,,Wow !,5.0,,"Wow, what a view ! Agreed that the drinks are a bit pricey but gets exchanged with the S $20 entrance. The views of the skyline during sunset is simply amazing. A good choice of cocktails as well. Despite the crowd, the service was good. Thanks to one of waitresses who found a table for us very soon."
,,A ship on the roof!!,4.0,,This hotel looks incredible! It's one of the top attractions in the city but I wouldn't say it's a must see. It's great for those who want incredible views of the city but there is not much else to do there. And the restaurant on top there is only for hotel guests!
,,OVERRATED,1.0,,"To b honest u've missed nothing if u haven't been here, just another capitalised margin by d richest."
,,What a great view,5.0,,The view from the top of this building is amazing. We visited the restaurant and afterwards took in the view. Great at night to see all the lights over Marina Bay.
,,Luxury awaits,5.0,,Attended a reception here. Cheese and dessert buffet with amazing selections. Then went up to bar area top the towers with amazing views. Everything highly rated. Only downside was lack of convenient bathrooms. On the upper level you had to take an elevator down one level.
,,Fantastic views from heaven,5.0,,"They charge you to go to the top but are given a voucher for the same amount to use when you get to the top on food or drink but even if they didn't give you that voucher the view from there is worth every penny of whatever they charge, we went up there in the late afternoon and we saw the sunset from up there it was spectacular!!!!!"
,,A great view from the top and the casino isn't bad either,5.0,,"Since it is on the entrance to the city from the port or near any international hotel, this is a stop on the list. The casino is very nice (not a western hemisphere casino though - though they take your $ like it is) and the bar and pool area at Cest La Vie is amazing"
,,Great Views,4.0,,We took the option of paying for an elevator to the bar in the sky where the price could be applied against the cost of drinks. The views while enjoying a Singapore Sling and a Guiness were remarkable. The infinity pool up there was extraordinary.
,,OK but overrated... there are better alternatives,3.0,,"Without a doubt the view is impressive, and the design of MBS is a novelty. But is it impressive enough to charge upwards of SGD20? Probably not. Best time of day if you want the experience is sunset, but be careful getting stuck up top if it's a busy day, as the elevator queue to go down can get a bit long. My advice? Head instead to Level 33 or One Altitude which both have spectacular views, and spend the same money to enjoy them with a drink in your hand. You're welcome :-)"
,,Out of this world,5.0,,You can see the entire earth pert near from here!! This observation deck sits directly underneath the infinity pool on the very top of this fabulous place!!
,,Expensive and not worth,5.0,,Go to the bar area and have a drink. It's the same price as the tickets to go skypark and you get a better view
,,Heaven in the sky,5.0,,"Just one of the amazing hotel's, the view from the rooftop infinity pool is brilliant. Singapore Flyer on one side and Marina Bay on the other with sentosa island in the distance. 2500 rooms and a work force of 9000."
,,Dont go on top,2.0,,Good architecture but not worth taking a ticket to go up on 52nd floor for the view of the city. Ticket is costly for just a view . Witness the light and sound show sitting by the lake at marilion park.
,,Expensive and Crowded Tourist Trap,2.0,,"I suppose this is just one of those things you have to do in Singapore, but you probably won't want to do it a second time! What do you get? A great view over the city would be the only plus point. Having a drink at the rooftop bar is a luxury I would recommend you forego!"
,,The best vies in Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing, on top of the world, the best way to take it all in and just 3 floors above where we are staying!"
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Was great to go to the top of this hotel. Awesome views from the skypark. Only downside it that it was a bit expensive to go up there.
,,"To be recommended, if only to look on in awe",4.0,,"You can't fail but be impressed with the architecture of these buildings. Didn't visit the roof on this occasion as we have already eaten on the roof top restaurant, to be recommended at least once."
,,Best view in the city,5.0,,Amazing view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There is a huge promenade upon the roof of the hotel. The famous swimming pool with the view to the skyline is accessible only if you are a guest of the hotel.
,,Pretty impressed views!!,5.0,,Took a trip to the top of Marina Bay Sands and enjoyed a Singapore sling looking out at the incredible views. We were lucky we had a really clear day and couldn't fault the views from all around the bar. Staff were very friendly and accomodating. Next time will book a room
,,Love it!,5.0,,Great place to see the city. You pay and can stay as long as you choose. Took some pics then sat on the deck over looking city and had a beer waiting for sun to go down. A must do in Singapore.
,,In the clouds,3.0,,"Incredibly expensive but a signature visit is well worth it. We had ambled past otters scampering on the boardwalk and diving into the misty river and then into the palace of modern consumerism, Marina Bay Sands Skypark. What with canals and Boats in the lower levels, huge designer stores, a casino and the hotel it is a glory to behold.
On the 57 th floor the bar and the views are stunning as are the prices , but it is a must do. Only guests are allowed to swim in the infinity pool. Some small children caused onlookers heart stopping moments by leaning over the edge. The pool is staffed with life guards."
,,What not to like?,4.0,,"Since moved here, I hadn't really taken the time to see around. But I was really amazed seeing that Marina bay sands has everything you wanted. From restaurants to clothing shop. Good bars, best swimming pool, good service, high quality etc..."
,,Singapore at a glance,5.0,,"For only S$23 you can start your visit to Singapore by taking in the whole city at a glance. Breathtaking views spanning from the bay, to the Flyer, and downtown. Highly recommended."
,,Marina Bay Sands Park,5.0,,"If you dont want to spend your money to visit Garden by the bay, u can go here and u can see 3 places in a row.. Marina bay sands view, Garden by the bay view, and one cave I dont know that name.."
,,A view to kill,5.0,,Another must do experience. Loved the view. Reccommend going in the late evenings to get the best of both day time view and night lights
,,Amazing night time views,5.0,,We decided to visit the sky park ar night to take in the views of the city and catch the sound to light show in the gardens below. Views were spectacular and well worth a visit. You need to check the times for the garden light shows if you want to catch them.
,,Top photo spot in Singapore,5.0,,"The admission price is kind of steep for just an observation deck, but the view on top is quite spectacular and breathtaking. On the north side one sees downtown Singapore, and on the other side one sees the gorgeous Garden by the Bay. One regret is that the adjacent Infinity Pool is only open to hotel guests. So even though it would be a great photo opportunity, there is no way to take a good picture of it from the observation deck."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The roof top bars and pool are magnificent. The hotel is enormous. The shopping mall is comprehensive, and the MRT makes getting around the city easy."
,,Big attraction,5.0,,We visited the Sky Park viewing platform which gives the best vantage point to see the harbour and all the other attractions nearer the earth. Don't like heights don't go. we loved it.
,,Gigantic view,5.0,,Great place to be which is breathtaking and has a beautiful architectural value prop. Excellent concept of design
,,View for a eagles eye of Singapore,5.0,,If u want a place for. A birds eye view of Singapore then this is the place. To see . If u can be up there during the light show u won't be dispointed
,,Wonderful views even though raining.,5.0,,A shopping experience for those with money. However it was great to walk around to experience it all.
,,Amazing View,5.0,,Well worth a visit. Great views and friendly bar staff. When you go up buy your tickets for twenty dollars. The ticket money goes towards purchase of a drink and small plate of snacks at the lounge bar (57th Floor). This is better than buying your ticket to go up 56th Floor and having to buy refreshments.
,,The pool and restaurant are a wonder,5.0,,"Eat lunch, and swim or wade in the infinity pool. Food and service are surprisingly good. Towels were worn and torn, and pool area could be cleaner. But, the views!"
,,OK but....,3.0,,"We took the lift to the SkyPark Observation Deck, but the jury is out as to if it was value for money at $23 (senior ticket) each. The view was indeed incredible, of course you can't walk as far as you might wish because the viewing deck belongs to the hotel. If its raining, spend your money elsewhere though!"
,,WOW!!!,5.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark on one of what appeared to be several organised tours, because the place was heaving. It is certainly fascinating, although we were not allowed access to view the infinity pool area. We went up to the 56th floor (the lift takes 32 seconds) to the viewing platform, which is both wonderful and scary (if you get too near the edge). There is a shopping mall, two theatres, a museum, a casino, a coach and car park and heavens knows what else below sea level at this hotel. A feat of engineering indeed."
,,beautiful view,5.0,,"very nice, but a bit packed with locals. nonetheless, the view up ther eis definitely worth the sqeeueze."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"The entire complex is incredible, hotel, casino and Mall. The mall was incredible I couldn't breathe..I saw every High End retailer in the World. my only saving grace fro bankruptcy was that a lot of the clothes are cut for the Asian market. Since I am a 210 lb bodybuilder not much available for me. Except the Watches, shoes, food, hats, Jewelry, etc This Mall is very very nice breathtaking if you ask me Vegas times 100 ."
,,A good view of the City.,5.0,,"This is preferable to the Singapore Flyer as both THE SAME VIEW. In the MBS Skypark, though, on could have a leisurely walk around for at least an hour and have panoramic view of the city; it is also a better option for photo shoots."
,,Nice views,5.0,,"This is pricy. However, on a clear day, the views are nice. You can see the Gardens by the Bay and the old buildings. Singapore is small. I felt like I saw all of it up there. This is a good thing to do before sightseeing. That way you know where things are at."
,,Disappointing.......,3.0,,"We have visited previously but our friends hadn't been up to the Observation Deck so up we went again. The price at $20 - $23 SGD is ok but the available space seems to have diminished since our last visit and you can now barely view the infinity pool at all. It was also very hot the day we were there and there is little relief from the blazing sun up there. We also visited at night previously and had dinner in the restaurant which was wonderful, and would recommend visiting at night rather than during the day.
Also, the photos taken when you enter the Observation Deck are ridiculously expensive at about $50. Really !!"
,,A Glimpse of Singapore from a single place.,5.0,,"Located on 57th floor on Marina Bay Sands, this place offer you a spectacular view of Singapore city & places.It also have a bar service,you are not allowed to access the pool side from this location,but a good view is totally worth it. a must go place in Singapore."
,,Try the Sky Bar rather than Observation deck,4.0,,"I don't know how much it is to visit the Observation Deck, but we followed reviews and went to 57th floor Sky Bar. There is a minimum spend of S$30 per person so we sat overlooking the bay with drinks and a refreshing Asian Salad. Just don't try using it to take pictures without purchasing as you will unceremoniously encouraged to leave!"
,,skyprk,5.0,,exciting place good for family entewrtainment thrilling nice to see overcast of singapore bay good family outing place
,,Must see attraction.,4.0,,"A great lookout from the top. A very busy place and expect long queues for the lift, both ways. We went at night and the view was spectacular."
,,Exciting walk,5.0,,It is better to visit this scenic place in the evening or at night because it is not so hot. The temperature makes you feel cool and comfortable. You can have a panoramic view of Marina Bay and the Supertree Groove.
,,Great View at Night,4.0,,"Its nice, if you want a panoramic view from high up. Not worth the $25.Long wait time to come back down. You may be better oof to go and have a drink in the restaurant above."
,,Worth it!,5.0,,"Go to Tower 2 and take lift to 55, then next lift to 57. Sit on city side of Spago bar. We decided best option was a bottle of prosecco for S$100 with tax. Lasts a good hour and a half so you can take in the view."
,,great bar,5.0,,"great bar with unbelievably amazing view, fell in love with the views it's incredible. Dont forget to have your Singapore Sling cocktail!"
,,Awesome.,4.0,,"Great suite, fantastic places to eat. Well worth the cost. Ideal to have the MRT station at the lower ground level."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark - do it as part of a night tour,3.0,,"My wife and I visited the Skypark one afternoon in March and I have to say it did not live up to our high expectations. Admission was quite expensive (S$32 with a 20% discount coupon or seniors card); but on reaching the observation deck, we were annoyed to find that the area accessible to visitors is quite small, has very little shade shade and no seating. Visitor tickets do not give access to the real Skypark, with trees etc., that can be glimpsed from the ground. There are signs requesting visitors not to sit on the floor of the deck, but on a typically hot Singapore afternoon, some visitors who had found a bit of shade chose to ignore them. The views are expansive, but if you are hoping to capture great photographs of distant parts of the island or of the huge flotilla of ships anchored offshore, you will probably be disappointed. Singapore's moist atmosphere often makes good distance photography problematic. Having said that, it is a great place to get an overview photograph of the nearby Gardens by the Bay. For those who dislike intrusiveness, be prepared to have an unsolicited photograph taken in the lift foyer. Two prints with different backgrounds will then offered to you for an exorbitant price on your return to the lift. My advice is to visit the observation deck in the evening as part of a Singapore Night Tour. The odds are that it would be far more comfortable and the lights of Singapore would be impressive. I have seen 3.5-hour night tours advertised for around S$65 - S$70. These generally take in the Skypark's observation deck, the evening light and sound show at the Gardens by the Bay and a 20-minute cruise on the river. There are probably other options available."
,,eagle eye view of Singapore,5.0,,The Skypark is located on the topmost level of the MBS Towers. The entry and tickets to the skypark is located just near tower 3 reception. Try visiting it in the evenings as you get to see Singapore's skyline when lights come on. Sadly you can't access infinity pool with the same tickets. Pro Tip: Apply for the 'Sands Rewards Card' (it's free) to get 20% discounts on your tickets. Cheers!
,,Dazzling dinner in the Sky,5.0,,"Its a life time experience when you see the world below you moving like fish in the aquarium. Yes, that's the experience @ MBS.. While one can snack around, the world below looks like small glittering camp. The Merlion, the gene bridge walk, the colorfully lit trees, the Singapore flyer just rejuvenate your brains. The shopping gallery in the ground floor is eye catching.

So next time, ensure you are there with the go with an option to stay there as well."
,,Vry NYC place,5.0,,Very beautiful part of Singapore beauty....even vry good designed...I like to visit again Singapore for enjoy my tym but only one thing is worst temp of Singapore is warm all the year. ..but NYC place for tourist attractions and visit...
,,See Singapore at night,4.0,,"Seeing Singapore at night up at the Skypark at the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel is another enjoyment, unfortunate they would not let us take a peek at the infinity pool."
,,Worth doing,4.0,,I hate heights but overcame my fear when dragged up to this viewing platform by my husband. Amazing views and cool!....Needless to say I didn't stay up long but now I'm glad I did
,,Go for the views obviously!!!,5.0,,We went up $23 each at about 4pm and stayed for the sunset! Was lovey to see the city in both light and dark. Worth a trip up!
,,Best in place Singapore to get unrivalled views,4.0,,Great place to visit at the start of your visit to Singapore not only do you get excellent views of the city but also can orientate yourself with other places to visit. Reasonably priced at 23 dollars for an adult concessions are available.
,,Couples,5.0,,Offers splendid views of the city and its skyline. The ambience of the club compliments the views of the city and the bay. The infinity pool is an exciting adventure. The shopping mall is a haven for shopaholics. It's a pity I will miss the upcoming jazz festival.
,,Again a must visit,5.0,,If your in Singapore your definitely gonna visit this place nothing to talk about it much but it's beautiful place. A must go
,,Wonderful accomodations,5.0,,The hotel provided wonderful accommodations in hotel rooms and dinning services. The location of the hotel was also in prime location where convenient access to the rest of the city. You have to visit the pool on the 57th floor. It is the best part of staying in this hotel.
,,Just ok,3.0,,"If you've been on the Singapore flyer, there's not much more to see from the skypark. But it's still worth the visit to check out Marina Bay Sands and its subterranean glitzy shops and its fast lift."
,,Staycation weekend.,4.0,,"Great view from the hotel room! Pleasant time spend around the shoppes especially at nightfall with the lightings.

Everything is perfectly fine but however too crowded at the pool not much a chance to swim except to take photos. I would love to be back and have another experience at the hotel. Kudos!"
,,Nice view,5.0,,I went with my husband and it was very interesting. The biggest building and we paid for a ticket for both. We went up to see the view in the everning until underground has been shown a light and sound. The city at night was very beautiful. We sat on the floor around 2 hours and order some green tea. We had a souvenir photo but it was expensive. That's o.k. because it's our memory ! Very good place and perfect city.
,,Monday Cocktails!,4.0,,"On a recent short break to Singapore we nipped up to the Marina Bay Sands roof deck for what I would call a must visit while in Singapore! We had a very nice, although very expensive cocktail and observed some of the fabulous cityscape views of Singapore around us. We thought that we would try somewhere else for dinner but you have to take a visit here while in Singapore. You get the same view visiting the bar and having a drink that you do if you pay for the sky deck level for image taking, so I would personally suggest making an occasion out of it if you go."
,,Spectacular,4.0,,Well worth the visit. Up 56 floors to the viewing platform where there was lots of space for many viewers. Not to be left off the list of things to do in Singapore. One of many happy memories of Si
,,Wonderful view of Singapore,5.0,,You can see the whole of Singapore when you go on the SkyPak. It takes you to level 56 by the elevator. It's worth visiting just before the sunset so you can see in a daylight and then after the sunset the beautiful view in the lights
,,Stunning morning views,5.0,,Go early morning -opens at 9:30 very quiet Wonderful panorama over Singapore Staff friendly and helpful
,,Fabulous View At Night.,5.0,,"Take the lift to the Skypark at a small fee it is worth the view of Marina Bay, Gardens of the bay and all the lights and skyscrapers of Singapore at night, also an infinity pool at the top."
,,One of your must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,Stay there and use the pool or just drop by Celavi for drinks with friends and enjoy the view in the evening
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Great view! We could perfectly see the marina Bay and the beers were great. Cover us up to $20 pp but it can be used for a beer. No seats for enjoying the view. Work visiting not staying.
,,Impressive structure,3.0,,"Ate at one of the restaurants in the lower levels and had a drink at the bar at the top. Food was good and drink was very expensive, wouldn't do either again"
,,A must see,5.0,,"One of the icons in the amazing city of Singapore has to be the infinity pool at the Marina Sands hotel. Unless you are a guest, access is prohibited but they do the next best thing. It is not inexpensive. After your entrance, they want to charge you $75 for a photo in front of a green screen. Ignore those things and just drink in the beauty and the view from this fascinating building.
You can go almost 360 degrees around on the floor just under the pool. We went early in the day. It gets super hot up there and I imagine it must be stifling in the afternoon. We have friends who went up at night which, from their pictures, is an entirely different experience. Either way, it is simply spectacular.
This is one of those ""do not miss"" sites."
,,overpriced like seriously?,3.0,,i couldn't believe they were charging people $23 to go to the sky deck only- you weren't allowed to order drinks at the bar with patrons we had a mini style bar which had basic drinks available. I feel that whilst the views are beautiful this is just a bit of a money grab from the hotel.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,Amazing hotel and one of the best hotels in the world with a swimming pool on roof top which was build on three building.
,,Must do,5.0,,"Bit of a mix up to start as we wanted to sit at the top and have a drink at the bar but you have to buy an access ticket at the entry level if you would like to do this and unfortunately we didn't realise so please , if you want access to the bar buy a ticket
We had this sorted by a lovely lady Charmaine Ho in the service department and the visit was a huge success"
,,Just amazing view of Singapore day and night,5.0,,"This is a must do in Singapore, a day trip is up is fantastic great place to get a great view of Singapore and the night time viewing is just beautiful, There is a small souvenier shop p the top and a bar so you can stop and have a drink while taking in the view and atmosphere."
,,"Beautiful views, but a bit odd as visitor",4.0,,"First things first, it really is an amazing building with spectacular views. As a visitor however you cant use the swimming pool, which makes it a bit odd to walk past the swimming guests and for them it must also be a bit awkward to have thousands of visitors take pictures of them. And it isnt cheap (or even afordable) to book a room there. Since it is one of singapore s top buildings, a visit is highly recommended. If you are visiting and you pay the 20$ to go up, you can use it on drinks, which provides some time to enjoy the views."
,,Amazing building,5.0,,Very nice building from outside. Very nice and beautiful view from the top. There is superb restaurant with excellent food and service (a little price but it was worth to experience).
,,Incredible place,5.0,,"Words fail me with this totally amazing hotel with a ship on the roof. Shopping centre full of designer shopping with a canal running through it. Fantastic piece of architecture, light show from the ship at night was amazing."
,,"Nice view ,but too hot, plan accordingly",5.0,,"Went on August8th during SG50.. There was fighter plane aircraft show.. it was amazing... but pretty hot day, bring an unbrella.. worth a visit.. August 2015"
,,view that worth for eyes,5.0,,"if you love Ariel view its the right place ,try to go on day&night both views are the best ,if evening be there by 9pm you will have a great light show where lights will reach the clouds and rivers best thing to see in singapore"
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"Did not book in advance; I simply went to the base of tower 3 (or C) and paid there and then. Very small queue and the price is not excessive compared to other world attractions and food and drink in Singapore.

Lift quick, staff helpful and pleasant.

Great view from the rooftop and if you have money to waste there is a cafe / bar and gift shop too.

If you see what you think is rain approaching, join the lift queue down! I could not believe people chose to ignore or not notice one of the frequent short storms approaching!"
,,"Nice, but not as expected",3.0,,"The view from the Skywatch is incredible! From one side you can see the Gardens by the Bay and waterfront, on the other you can see the city skyline. Unfortunately, if you are not a guest at the motel and you purchase a ticket to the Skywatch you are only granted access to a small portion of the upper deck. The views are incredible, and it is a nice way to enjoy the Marina Bay Sands Hotel without paying for a room. However, don't expect to be anywhere near the infinity pool or have access to a large area of the deck. All in all, it isn't the full Marina Bay Sands Motel experience, but it sure does include incredible views!"
,,Too view,5.0,,You have to visit this if you wish to see the beauty of Singapore from a top view. It has entry fees but as they say it's worth it.
,,Incredible view,5.0,,"An incredible view and experience, well worth the money to see. Cafe was limited but a good range of souvenirs."
,,Great views,4.0,,"If in Singapore its a must see, bit pricey ($26.00 each) to get up to the Skydeck but once of there the views are awesome, before you go up the lady will take 3 pictures of you, once at the top the photos are ready for you to buy, don't pay what they are asking, haggle with them to see how cheap you can get them, they told us $70.00 for 3, we ended up getting 2 for $25, no seats available on the view deck, just walking around area, and it's only a small portion you can walk around on, bit like the bow of an ocean liner, for me it was a bit of been there done that,I would have liked to gone to the bar and had a drink but that wasnt opened yet, boooooo"
,,Stayed at Hotel,5.0,,"Views are really amazing at the top! I stayed at the hotel so not sure what non guest viewing options are.

I heard it's $20-$25 and one option let's you redeem your date towards food or drinks at Club Ce La Vie or Spago on the roof deck!

Give me a if this helped!"
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,If you want to see Singapore from a primary location you need to get to the top of this beautiful building. The experience is worth the cost. There was no waiting when I went up. You can only see the section where the point extends out. There is a souvenir shop and a bar/restaurant. There is a large section you cannot see since reserved for guests and the pool area.
,,Just another mall,4.0,,I live in the mall capital of the world. I am not easily impressed with anything mall related. Nothing new.
,,Skybar or Observation Deck,5.0,,Amazing new Marina Bay Sands Hotel with Sky Bar. $8Billion hotel. Options to view skyline from Observation Deck$S23 or Sky Bar $S20 drink coupon. Selected $S20 coupon for drink at Sky Bar. Beautiful view of skyline. Some views are slightly blocked by Observation Deck glass barriers located just in front of Sky Bar. However for value of price paid enjoyed drink at Sky Bar while overlooking Bay Area. A must see.
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,We visited the observation deck for free as being guest of the hotel. Had nice views of Singapore. Heaps of people but plenty of room. They even serve food and drinks at the bar.
,,Best visited in the evening for spectacular views,4.0,,"I visited the Skypark as part as part of the excellent Singapore Night Tour. Admission fee was included in the tour price (and I believe it was cheaper as part of a group booking).
You can expect a queue to the lift to get to the top but it is worth the wait - a 360 degree panorama of Singapore. At night, Singapore is alive and beautifully illuminated, while during the day the famous haze may spoil the view, so an evening visit is best."
,,A flop,2.0,,"In comparison to the many beautiful attractions we went to in Singapore, this was definitely the worst. It was simply underwhelming. I'd suggest grabbing a snack or a meal at Cest La Vi instead. At least you'd have something to do!
Definitely a spectacular building, but just another lookout.
Be careful of the 'photo opportunity' when you go in. It is 'free' when you go in, but they will try and get you to buy the photos when you leave."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,We purchased ticket to restaurant which was SD20 but that was taken off our restaurant bill if you book in advance get outside table fab to dine looking out over Singapore a splendid end to our holiday
,,A Must see if your in Singapore!,5.0,,"I loved the time I was at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The hotel itself is incredible. Very nice place to stay. there are a lot of people that stay here so it's a busy place. I was here on a weekday and I loved it. There were a lot less people and when going up on the top to view and swim, there were very few people compared to the weekend when I went there. .A lot of great and interesting things. Beautiful asian music being played live downstairs in the open lobby area and great food."
,,A human can create or reclaim; make impossible as possible.,5.0,,"I do not say that this is the only place in the world today that can demonstrate the title of my review... but sincerely this is one of the foremost such demonstration of human will and dedication combined. Right on the 56th or 57th floor the 25 to 30 % of the boat like structure is dedicated towards common viewing upon chargeable tickets. Remaining area is confined for the hotel guests in the form of restaurants and roof top swimming pool.

The sky view is a habitation upon 3 towers of the Marina bay sands hotel. The view from the top can behold any turbulent mind within seconds.

On one side is the Oceanic view. On the second side is the merger of Singapore river into the Ocean along with two roads flowing at the bottom. And on the third side is the mesmerizing factoring of the skyline of commercial building nestling the Singapore river Bay.

Evening is the best time to visit this place. Just before the sunset you shall benefit the two worlds,namely, the view under the fading sunlight and the view of the man made exuberance that glitters as sparkling lights. It is simply beautiful to be there and witness the two faces of the same made made scenic beauty in blend with nature.

I am sure you shall return with hands full of several memorable pictures and memories."
,,Brilliant experience,5.0,,"We went up in the lift to the top what a sight you can see so much from there,Botanical Gardens, Marina,Singapore Grand prix race track,it's a beautiful place to take photos from."
,,Fantastic views of the city and ocean,4.0,,"You have an option pay S$23 and go to the 56th floor or buy a drink, which will probably cost you S$23, and go the roof bar on the 57th floor and enjoy the same view but you get a drink. I think it is a no brainer. Access to the bar is via Tower 3 as I remember. Again best you visit in the evening as the lights of the city will I'm be very spectacular Enjoy and enjoy the cocktail too!"
,,"If you're not going to go up this tower, don't bother to go to Singapore :)",4.0,,"What a view! You have to be a hotel guest to gain access to the area with the infinity pool, so we just had a beer and a Singapore Sling at the Flight Bar and Lounge and had an incredible view. Was a little hazy when we were there so we could see all the way to the horizon, which probably about 50 miles away from the top of the tower."
,,Fantastic 360° views over Singapore.,5.0,,"Part of the incredible Marina Sands development, the Sky Park and shopping centre are ""must sees"" when visiting Singapore. We enjoyed superb views from 200 metres+ over the Harbour and Singapore. Head for heights needed. Highly recommended."
,,"View is not worth it, and not much info to get",1.0,,"Unlike the Empire State Building which has an audio guide that gives you several tidbits of information about New York, the MBS Skypark just gives you a view of the city -- excluding the Marina Bay Sands. That means all you get to see are the CBD (nothing special) and the Singapore flyer. And it's not even a 360-degree view! Overpriced at SGD23, in my opinion. The view from anywhere on the bay is better, since you get to see the Marina Bay Sands -- and it's free!"
,,Top of the world views,5.0,,Fabulous 360 degree views. Even more spectular by night. Go up before sunset and stay for the flower light show.
,,Las Vegas in little red dot,5.0,,Nice hotel. Highlight is the infinity pool. Its a must to experience it during the night. Many eatery in the hotel.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Wow what a view. This must be on anyone's list of things to do in Singapore by day or night. I really recommend this attraction.
,,High in the sky....,5.0,,Came here for a look around and we're surprised to be asked to pay S$20 before going anywhere ! Need not have worried because the money was off a drink in the skybar. Lovely cocktails and a super view made this fun ! Made more special as we were there as evening fell and still there when the light show began.
,,One of the must do in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is not a cheap place but I consider the entrance of SGD 20,- as more than justified and you get this refunded when you consome drinks or food. The view is awesome and just spectacular. Enjoy the bar, cool misic, cold drinks and feel like the King/Queen of the world.
Dont tke the Mojito its quite watered -"
,,Rooftop view of marina bay,5.0,,Beautiful view at night of marina bay and gardens by the bay. Must visit both at day time and night.
,,Awsome view,5.0,,The view at the Sky Park bar is absolutly breathtaking ! It worths the expensive 20€ glass of rose.. ! Waitresses were nice and welcoming
,,THE WORLD AT YOUR FEET,5.0,,"Great place to stay, it is very big, but checking in went very smoothly, roomservice is fast and very good, the rooftop pool is amazing : Hanging on the edge of the infinity pool looking out over Singapore is a thing you don't do every day !"
,,Great view,4.0,,Quick ride up 56 floors to the top. We had a good view of the city even though it was a little cloudy. A little bit pricey for just gaining access to part if the roof
,,Marina bay Casino,5.0,,If you are foreign resident entry is free. you need to carry your original passport. Casino is awesome. for Singapore nationals entry fees is 100 SGD.
,,amazing views,5.0,,"Wonderful views from observation deck, 56th floor, and a great day out with the Gardens by the Bay so close, I thought the views were much better then on the Singapore Flyer. The whole concept of a ship spread over three hotel towers is amazing,"
,,Wonderful view of the skyline,5.0,,"the view is spectacular and nearly a must visit during a stay in Singapore, however it is pricy for such an attraction"
,,Miss represented,3.0,,"This is a little disapointing. 'Sky Park' implies much more than a small bar/shop and a boarded viewing platform.

I thought we had bought the wrong tickets but I haven't been able to find an alternative, on line.

The viewing platform is just that & no more. A very small area allows a peek at the infinite pool.

The view of Gardens by the Bay are good but other than that this is ' nothing special'.

A bit of a gimmick!"
,,tip top views,5.0,,"magnificent views from this amazing building a must when in Singapore. plenty of room to walk around without being overcrowded,great staring point for visitors to the city to get reference points from."
,,Very impressive building,3.0,,"Well - three enormous tower buildings with a ship on top! The ""ship"" section can be visited by elevator, for a fee. Must say that once you are there, there is only a very limited part of the ship that you have access to - most of it is for hotel guests only.

However, it was worth the cost as the views from the top are amazing. You can see a lot of Singapore and the sea, getting a completely different aspect of the great buildings of Singapore from such a high point of view.

There is a restaurant , we think it may be available to non-hotel guests but we did not want a meal so did not try to get in. There is a snack bar and small souvenir section. For Singapore, the prices at the snack bar were not expensive considering the surroundings.

Again, disappointed that we could not go all around the building but nevertheless thought it had been a worth-while visit."
,,Impressive.,5.0,,Wherever you are in Singapore you can see this building. It really is impressive. If you get to the top there are amazing views of the city. Expensive to eat and drink but you'd expect that.
,,Lunch @ Spagos is an experience worth the S$,5.0,,"The hotel is a landmark and a must see.
Prices are high but the view is extraordinary. Better anytime than paying for access to the Skypark viewpoint. Food is well prepared and service friendly and efficient.
We reserved online and requested a table opposite the infinity pool which have the best view. Pool is for guests only but you get a similar experience from Spagos.

Alternatively have an evening Sundowner at the bar.

We went there on the way to the airport and had our luggage stored with the concierge during our stay since we had to check out at noon in our own hotel."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"Amazing views over Singapore, but there's better. Entry to this skypark is 23 dollars but here's a little tip. Go into the building at tower 3 end. Go the the first counter on you right. Buy a ticket to ""bar 57"". This gets you a ticket to the bar at the very top of the building on the roof. It's partly outdoor overlooking the rooftop infinity pool. The views are better than the skypark. Entry to this bar is 20 dollars but you get a free drink included. We had 2 cold beers and relaxed in the rattan loungers taking in the views. The bar also does food if you want. It doesn't make any sense but this place is cheaper than the skypark, better and you get a drink included. Bargain."
,,Wow Singapore!,5.0,,It's the best place to see awesome Singapore. We chanced a visit when there was no queue and the view deck had very few visitors. Our visit was in time to watch the Marina Bay light show but from the Skypark. Found a nice spot on the deck and got a couple of hotdogs and matched it with the Singapore Sling and a Daiquiri. An awesome evening experience in Singapore.
,,Good morning from the top of Singapore,5.0,,When you walk outside to the deck it is a very very fantastic view you can see out to sea and miles inland
,,a let down,3.0,,we managed to get into the bar at the top without paying to enter the building. drinks are seriously expensive but it is a must do although slightly overrated
,,save a little,5.0,,Rather than paying to go to the very top floor (quite expensive) you can get a 40 dollar pass for 2 to Cela Vie which goes towards your 1st drink (2 drinks were 55 dollars or around £25) views are spectacular especially if you time it for sunset.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Visited one evening. There is a small area available for non residents of the MBS hotel, as most of the Skypark is restricted to residents, and it was crowded during our visit. However the views are excellent. Entry, via elevator and may present some difficulty to a disabled person. We paid an entry fee of $20 each. Worth the cost. Recommended"
,,A must do but expensive for a viewing platform,4.0,,"A really good way to get a different view of the city and its surrounding water. Almost 270 degree view from the top of the building is brilliant

But the is no shade and limited opportunity to do anything other than get very very hot whilst looking at the views. There are no seats to encourage you to move on and out quicker but the enterence fee is fairly high for around half an hour

For all that this is a must do"
,,Must-See,5.0,,Superb architecture. Great views from the top. There is a mall in the building as well with an optional gondola ride (there might be a cost for that). It's definitely worth visiting while you're there.
,,Skypark,5.0,,"56 floors up you get amazing views of Singapore, you can go at night and see the Supertrees litup. If you are thinking of going at night go early as there are massive queues which you don't get in the day. Also, in centre of Hotel you can find a hugh topend Shopping Centre."
,,The best view in Singapore ... if you can afford it,2.0,,"This is -singularly- the most over-priced attraction I've seen anywhere on planet. To go the top, just for the view and to have a drink is literally almost $100USD per couple. Actually, our tab was closer to $150USD ... we got french fries and a couple of fried mushrooms. And even after that craziness, you are restricted to the tiny bar area. We felt cheated and ripped off as there was no notice of that when you were paying. That aside, the view from the only one side you are allowed to look from is wonderful. They treat you like the ""great unwashed"" when you attempt to walk around and actually see more of the top. We sincerely felt like they were saying ""give us your money and just GET OUT!!"" The attitude of the hotel was so unlike anything else we've ever experienced in Singapore. Borderlining on nastiness. Unapologetically, they let you know where you stand in their eyes. Needless to say, we won't be back. We surmise that the rooftop pool next to the bar, is probably unheated from the grimacing faces and yells when they entered the water."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark: nice to see but expensive,3.0,,"We did visit the bar on the top floor with a view on the top pool. Nice view over the city, but very expensive to drink somthing in the bar. Not so friendly people and you do need time before receiving your drink."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Must visit place in Singapore... For drinks on 57th floor u need to take $20 coupon. It's worth taking it. Beer + roof top location + Singapore = Awesomeness ✓
,,Perfect Skyline,4.0,,"You would experience goose bumps when you see the view from up there. We were there from 6pm-9pm thus you will see and experience day and night views. Both were amazing! I love yo watch the dancing lights. And you will feel so free when you feel the wind that touches your skin. It will make you feel romantic, happy and free!
It was a great attraction!"
,,Drinks on the 57th floor,5.0,,"After a dinner our on crabs, we stopped here for a drink and views over the city. $25 a Mojito but the views were worth every cent"
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"If you're in the area go to the top! The view to be had from the skypark are amazing. You can't swim in the pool unless you're staying at the hotel, but you can have a drink and take some amazing photos. There's no limit on how long you can spend at the top. There's loads of space and 360 degrees of Singapore."
,,Best pool location.....ever!,4.0,,You really have to see this to believe it. The infinity edge pool 57 stories up is amazing. Staff are great and the atmosphere is outstanding
,,Gorgeous views!,4.0,,"Was there with family for a birthday celebration and really amazed by what the Sky Park had to offer. Extremely beautiful views of the Marina Bay area (Gardens By The Bay,Singapore Flyer,Esplanade,The Merlion and much more). As it can get really sunny and hot in the afternoon, be advisable to head up in the late evenings instead for an even more awesome experience!"
,,Tourist,4.0,,We stayed for a night just to get into the pool. It's full of people taking pictures and selfies but it's worth it for the experience!!
,,Best look to the town.,5.0,,If you go to this place you didn´t need to go to Singapore Flyer.If you stay in thid hotel you even see more and no need to wait hr. to elevaator.
,,"A place for branded goods, sightseeing n daily laser show at 9pm",4.0,,"There's hotel, food, shopping, entertainment all in one place. Spending will be higher as most things r costly here. If u r adventurous to move around, there are cheaper alternatives of food and shopping ard. Sky park entry for non hotel guests, cost abt sgd 20 per entry."
,,A view to die for!!,3.0,,"A must do event, although a bit disappointed that access is limited to a small part of the whole attraction.

There is a shop up on the top, with plenty to do on the ground floor if you need to, including shops.

We visited when the queues were short, so didn't experience any delays getting in the lifts, but we were advised that waiting for the lifts can be time consuming."
,,Dont miss it!,5.0,,An excellent place to dine with friends or family in the evening. Nice restaurants and a surreal panoramic view of Singapore!
,,Delight after delight,5.0,,"We had no idea what this visit would involve. Just thought it was an amazing piece of architecture. An exceedingly wet day made us think that this would be somewhere to keep dry
A visit to the viewing gallery was not spoiled by the threatening skies although there was no shelter when it did start to pour down.
The three towers which form the hotel were fascinating an atrium like no other. Eateries were varied and all excellent. We then wandered down the stairs to unknown treasures a HUGE shopping mall of top end shops. More places to eat. An underground river and boats. Casino, viewing places an more wonderful places that we didn't have the energy to explore
Do go there even if the weather isn't wet it's cool in all senses of the word .... enjoy."
,,Sort Of A Can't-Miss for Singapore,4.0,,"It's about $20 to ride the elevator to the top of the Marina Bay Sands and gawk at the view. But here's the thing: you are confined to the viewing deck at the north end of the building. Alternatively, you can pay a $20 cover charge to ride the elevator 1 floor higher to the ""CE LA VI"" skybar--you get to sit at a table, perhaps order some food, and enjoy pretty much the same view. BUT you also get a drink and you get to wander a little closer to the wildly impressive infinity pool that you can't see from the observation deck."
,,Want to see all of Singapore in a short period of time?,5.0,,"This ultra modern park is visible from just about anywhere. We enjoyed going to the top and seeing the view. The views and pictures are spectacular.

If you are over visiting the Gardens by the Bay, this is a short walk from there and you can combine the two activities."
,,Wonderful views of Singapore ..,5.0,,I love the resaurant on top of the Marina Bay Hotel above the beautiful Gardens On The Bay .. Great spot for a relaxed lunch after The Gardens Visit..Spectacular at night....
,,Family get away,5.0,,This must be one of the best swimming pools in all of Asia. Absolutely fantastic experience. It is worth staying at Marina Bay Sands to get 24 hour access to Skypark
,,Buy the drink,5.0,,"A number of people urged us to stay so we could experience the pool and view, but friends who did were not convinced it warranted the cost. We intended to get up to the bar for a sunset drink but got busy. It's a stunning landmark and makes a great pic."
,,An expensive experience,4.0,,This truly is a beautiful combination of high end architecture and contruction.The shopping is full of name brands For other than hotel guests the skypark etc is a $23 per adult tripg For all its great qualities it is still expensive Must See
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,Breathe taking view and simply elevating. Provides a wonderful joyful ambience that is still very much unbeatable and very much worth the entrance fee collected.
,,Awesome stay in MBS,5.0,,Celebrated my daughter's birthday at MBS suite room. The stunning view at infinity pool is a great experience! Night view at the top of MBS sky park is highly recommended.
,,Nice stay,5.0,,The hotel is nice and the main attraction to stay here is the pool . but the price is way too expensive for a long stay
,,Fantastic Views - worth the entrance fee,5.0,,"We spent a couple of hours in the Skypark on the viewing platform. We did'nt do the pool etc as we were pushed for time. definitely worth the entrance fee, the views are amazing."
,,Great view but a total touristy experience,3.0,,"Very unusual architecture of course and it offers great views , so it is hard not to go do this. However not really all that worth it. Expensive and very, very touristy. You have two choices - go to the outside viewing area or go to the bar and dining area where the view isn't as good but you can drink/eat. The two sections are separated. Note that it is a rare day in Singapore where the air is clear so though the views are quite amazing, you get a clear reminder of how this city needs to do something about the air quality. Still you can really see the harbor area, and see all of the many ships sitting offshore. There is also a nice vantage point of the botanical gardens and large ferris wheel attraction."
,,Save your money for Sky on 57 instead,1.0,,"You might as well go to the Sky on 57 bar and restaurant. The view is breathtaking - and you can even sit there and enjoy drinks and food. It isn't cheap - and if money is a question, the view from the Skypark is good too although it will be crowded."
,,"A true must see ""bucket"" list thing to do",5.0,,"Ok, not sure we can add anything else to what has already been said. The views are out of this world, the architecture is amazing, the experience is a MUST do in Singapore. Do a day and night trip."
,,For what you get - expensive,3.0,,"23$ for a ride in the lift up 53 floors,when at the top, a deck with great views of Singapore, and that's it !!! Nowhere to get refreshments, only a small snack/soft drink/souvenir bar with nowhere to sit and NO shade from the sun. The photos taken prior to getting in the lift, in front of a green screen, were good but, again, 70$ for two photographs??"
,,It's A Long Way To The Top,5.0,,"A must do if you are in Singapore. They take your photo before you enter the lift, and it is looking at you when you alight! A very good place to get a 360 degree view of the area from above"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Great view on top and just an amazing building to see in person. We went at night and the was queuing to get up and to get down
,,Worth a visit but expensive,4.0,,"We went early in the day hoping to beat the cloud (which we didn't) but the view was still good. It is expensive tho and you can only go to one end of the structure as the rest is for guests only. They also try to sell you an overpriced photopack for S $70.

Make sure you go up to the restaurant level (up the stairs) as view from there is a bit different.

You probably wouldn't spend more than 30 mins for this activity. Which equates to just over S $1 per minute."
,,"Beautiful, Busy, Expensive",4.0,,"My husband and I went up to the Skypark after a day at the Gardens by the Bay. The queue for tickets was short but the wait for an elevator took a little while. The attendant packed us in the elevator tightly like sardines and sent us up to the 56th floor. The views up top are really beautiful. You can see all of the Gardens by the Bay park, which is especially neat with their giant trees lit up. There are boats lit in the harbor, the CBD, and various other landmarks that are easy to spot. There is a small stand that sells drinks and hot dogs and another small stand that sells souvenirs. If you purchase the S$23.00 Skypark ticket, you cannot go to the bar/restaurant and use the voucher. Just be careful which ticket you buy.

On the way down the line to leave wrapped around about 1/4 of the boardwalk and it took quite a while to leave. We were again packed tightly in the elevator going down. all in all it is a really beautiful view and I think it's worth the money, just do not go if you are claustrophobic as the elevator ride is really packed."
,,"Pricey, but the view is worth it",4.0,,"It costs about $20US to take the elevator to the Sky Park, but the view is very cool. You look down on all of Singapore (including the Singapore Flyer). If you like to take photographs, the view is worth the cost. You are segregated from the Sky Bar and the infinity pool (you must be a guest at the hotel to get into these areas)."
,,Wow,5.0,,This place us just awesome. This is our 4th visit to Singapore but our first at Marina Bay. We decided to opt for the Ce La Vie bar which was excellent value. $20 each buys a voucher which can be used against drinks or food. Even the drinks bearing in mind the unique bar were not overpriced. Well worth a visit the views are amazing.
,,Amazing views all round,5.0,,"This is definitely worth the money you pay for it. I think my ticket cost around 28 dollars which I didn't think was too steep.

I luckily didn't have to queue at all as I think I was slightly out of season. The elevator up seems to take forever as it's so high up, and once you come out of the elevator the views don't disappoint.

From the back of the skypark you can see the Singapore Straight, Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Island, and even as far as Pulau Batam. From the front, you have all of Marina Bay to admire. It really is spectacular.

Tip - I went to the Skypark at around 6.45pm and had a good wander around and took plenty of photos. Sit and relax until the sun sets - it was the perfect location to watch the sunset behind the Business District. At 8pm you can always watch the Wonderfull Light Show at Marina Bay from the SkyDeck, which is also great.

Make the most of the money you've paid and stay for the sunset and the light show! If you want to watch the lightshow from Marina Bay, there is another show at 9.30pm that you won't miss."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,$20 entry redeemable for drink. Dont go up there thirsty expensive as.....the view.....absolutely breathtaking
,,Very Popular,4.0,,We went with a tour group so didn't get to spend much time on the top level (56 floors up). Went at night time so beautiful light display. If i went again i would do the day time.
,,Impressive,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is much more amazing in real life than photos. It dominates the area and is visible from just about everywhere. the views are incredible and is well worth battling the other tourists to go to the top.
,,Stayed tp break long haul outward journey,5.0,,"Very good hotel with a somewhat bewildering lobby at first sight. Efficient streamlined check-in . Rooms a bit on the small side but most with panoramic views. Infinity pool on roof with very cold water. Crowded at weekends.Bar and restaurant could be better in design but good food and service,Underpass to shopping centre with a most unusual canal and gondola system Worth a visit. Somewhat out of the centre of the city so MTR or taxi required.Planned on 3 tower system and a trudge from the room to the lobby in the further towers. Overall worth staying again."
,,Go there by all means- but just for the view,3.0,,"We found that one must either buy tickets to the PARK and THE SKY BAR- or you must chose one. The total was 48$ for both, so we chose the sky bar. Service was grudging, and they had lots of rules about where one may sit and what one can order( i.e. we sat at the bar, but could not order lunch unless we were at a table and had a reservation. Our ticket entitles us to one drink, so we had those. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere, where they actually want your business."
,,Avoid long queue to visit skypark,3.0,,"In recent visit to Singapore, wanted to get the wonderful view from the top of this iconic building. Waited in queue for 20 dollar tickets, then on arrival realised that we could not have a drink In The sky bar as planned, as it was off limits to casual visitors.
There was only a small stand with soft drinks available.
Even more frustrating when we cut our visit a little short as no shelter from sweltering heat, made our way to the ground floor and saw that we could have paid 20 dollars each to get into the sky bar which is air conditioned. The 20 dollar tickets are then redeemed which will pay for a drink or two.
Lesson learnt. Best way to do this visit is to book ahead and don't join the queue. Also important to know that only half of the roof area is available for visitors, the other half is a pool for residents of Marina Sands Hotel."
,,Try visit as night falls and you have light show,4.0,,Fabulous views of Singapore from up here. Best way is up to Ce La Vie bar and order a drink- the views are the same. I have been up in daytime but far preferred night visit when might show is on... Well worth it.
,,Day out,4.0,,"Worth a visit to the Marina Bay Park and to see all the flowers, trees and plants situated in the dome and surrounding park.
Amazing. What they have done here with incredible designs and colours ,very clever. Need at least 4 hours to pool around the place and reasonable entrance fee"
,,Wedding anniv!,5.0,,"It was actually march 14,2015 when we decided to book in this hotel since its our aniv, we really do want to make our day special and believe me its worth it. The architectural design of the hotel is amazing! The lobby is massive and the infinity pool is indescribable! One of a kind experience.. The management is very accomodating and considerate, they knew exactly what you might need to make your stay comfortable, they even offer a free cot for my 10mos old baby. The restaurants has good offers and discount for the guest and the buffet are heavenly scrumptious. Our room's view is infront of the MBS botanical garden! What more can we ask for. Thanks MBS for making our aniv extra special!!"
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"Fantastic view and scenery. Please note that there is no seating available at the top. Is an absolute must, just a pity you can't access the infinity pool as it is only for guests of the hotel"
,,A Must,5.0,,The views from the top of this hotel are amazing. Not user of the cost as this was included as part of a tour.
,,High up ...,3.0,,... but there are many high place to go see the city from above. You can get a free right to the top but wit limited view points. Take the elevator the the top to the restaurant and just go to passed the counters on the other side of the small group of trees you will find a nice little lies point overlooking the gardens by the bay.
,,Great views over Singapore from this amazing space,5.0,,This building is iconic and the view from the sky park spectacular. I paid to go into the bar there and the admission cost was redeemable for a drink. Great views across the city and also the botanical gardens and bay on the other side.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,It was a truly amazing experience! The view was indescribable and the whole visit was a real treat for the family!
,,Three night stay in Singapore,4.0,,It is a must do but a little pricey for what is essentially a great view. Photo of you was expensive but most things are in Singapore. Still would recommend going up
,,The best views of Singapore skyline,5.0,,This was the pinnacle of my tour of Singapore for I love architecture & innovative designs. This boasts the finished views of the city hands down & a good way to see the light show in the evening. It is best suited to when it is clement weather as there is no shelter again any rain & but then again it is well worth seeing day or night
,,"A good view, but only a one-time thing",3.0,,"I was hoping to see he infinity pool, but the view is blocked from the Skydeck. For $23, it's not amazing. But the views are pretty good! Go early to beat the crowds."
,,Oh My Goodness,5.0,,Well what an experience this is .We got a ticket to the cafe and bar on the 57th floor YES 57th Floor. What a view the price of our entry was taken off our bill for drinks .We took photos and had a drink outside for an hour or so we soaked in the view. Then decided to have lunch inside the lovey cafe bar . Excellent real Singapore food served so well .What a day we had . Loved it .
,,A nice view,4.0,,"The top of Marina Bay Sands has a nice view on a clear day but I'm not sure the price is worth it unless you're a hotel guest.

You can't access the pool or the restaurant and there is nowhere to sit and enjoy the view so it really feels like they are just trying to churn people through for a profit which is never how you want to feel as a visitor.

Signage is great in multiple languages and if you want a great view go for it but I definitely wouldn't do it twice."
,,really nice place for drinks and view,4.0,,"must go place at night to have a nice view and drinks. be warned this is not cheap. don't go on the weekend as it will be super busy and a cover charge of around $40 SD/person. Go during week nights and go early. If you are a don't drink kind of person then don't go up as you are expected to drink at least one drink, and I don't mean juice either."
,,The Landmark!,5.0,,"While watching the beautiful structure, I could not help but think of the person who conceptualized and designed this beautiful structure. When we went in, we experienced opulence and elegance surroundings. The view on top of the building was simply enthralling... overlooking Singapore!"
,,Great view!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore you should come here, it's much, to take a look at the whole city! Price is 23 Singapore $, not much for such a view 😉"
,,One of the most fantastic buildings in the world,4.0,,For sure one of the highlights in Singapur. As I can not afford a night (or even a small snack) in that place I have to watch it from outside. And even that is a great pleasure. A good place to watch it is from the seafront at Merlin. But also on some boat trips they give you a great view (but difficult for taking high resolution pictures from the boat).
,,Visit to observation deck sands skypark,1.0,,We are staying in Singapore at Raffles the iconic hotel which is great. However we were interested in the architecture of the hotel with the design of a ship on top. We decided to pay the $40 Singapore dollars to visit the top - as we were waiting someone takes your photo which we thought was a security procedure. However when you get out at the 56th floor you are assailed by a guy wanting $70 Singapore dollars for two photos - a complete ripoff. In fact the experience is not really worth it as the deck area contains no greenery although the views are great but in the heat of the day a bit misty. I would not recommend this at all.
,,3 Days at Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"This hotel has 3 towers. We stayed in Tower 1 on 36th floor with a city view. Great room although some rooms nearby were smoking rooms and you could smell it as soon as you opened the door.
Great Hotel but unless you have plenty of cash i would suggest to go across the street to the shopping area and eat or better still jump in a cab and go to Chinatown. Food there is awesome.
Pool is great to swim in on 57th floor and you can get some great pics."
,,Good Views,4.0,,"The Hotel offers great views over The Bay area of Singapore, very similar to the Singapore Flyer although the hotel viewing platform is higher. Again fairly expensive but I think a must do."
,,Worth to visit,5.0,,What an amazing building. How this architecture is made is very impressive. Worth a trip and worth to go upstairs to the bar for a drink with an excellent view and feeling. Top.
,,HOTEL SHOPPING COMPLEX AT GARDENS AT THE BAY,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a multi function location. Contemporary hotel overlooking the Singapore River, large high end indoor AC shopping mall and a casino. Hope this helps."
,,One time Visit,4.0,,"I just visit Sky Park of Marina Way Sand Hotel.Place was good for one time visit.Just go for see singapore from 56th floor and click lots of photo.Weather was good ,too much crowded and many people around there."
,,What views to behold!,4.0,,"Go here if you are not afraid of heights and want an amazing view over Singapore. It is well worth the expense and enjoyment of seeing the city, particularly at night (after 7pm I would say).

If you eat at the restaurant you get free views but it might not end up being cheaper, though it is an option."
,,Yes!,5.0,,"Absolutely beautiful views, at night and during the day! Make sure you eat before you go up or you'll spend a fortune!"
,,View Singapore from a great location,5.0,,"I turned up and I felt I was in a different world, the staff were fantastic. I had already sent them an email asking for a room that was high up and overlooked the marina as I liked to take photos of these great views. I was given a room on the 73rd floor with an amazing view and I later discovered that I had been given a free upgrade to an executive room. The pool was fantastic and I strongly recommend people to give the hotel at least 1 night of your time. There is a shopping centre a ice rink and lots more to do and see."
,,observation deck,5.0,,Loved it you go in lift to floor 56 in matter of seconds go around and take pictures of anywhere - would of loved to do trip a night time -
,,another icon of singapore,4.0,,"Those building looks very higher and luxurious, this is one of icon of singapore except the esplanade. I didn't enter to inside, but from the outside it was seen how pretentious this building with the unique skypark ship or large boat on the top. But I heard from the peoples around there this hotel is quite expensive. If you would like to seen the pretentious this hotel, I suggest you to come on the evening ( night ) , there you will see how is the luxury icon more clear with illumination light that complements the splendor"
,,Great location if you're looking for night city views,4.0,,"Good location to see the sunset and what night city emerge. Beautiful views and a good spot for having drinks, providing that you're ok with prices. They charge 20 dollars just to get up to the bar, which will buy you one drink. The food choices are very basic and finding a table to stand at could be an issue. Being iconic place in Singapore it attracts a lot of visitors so gets very busy in the evening."
,,Great evening views of Gardens by the Bay,4.0,,We went up just before sunset on the last evening we were in Singapore. It wasn't too crowded and offered very good views of all of Singapore. The trees in Gardens by the Bay were wonderfully lit up.
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"23 dollars each, photograph 30 dollars, with marina bay sands in back ground. Magnets t shirts on the platform, food and drinks, unable to enter the restaurant unless your staying there. Photos to die for."
,,Amazing...,4.0,,It is amazing to see a ship on the top on three skyscrapers...how high is the tide in Singapore?? Final evaluation: Nice
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Amazing venue 57 floors up!
You don't even feel the lift move.
Atmosphere electric! Music lights cocktails stunning view.
We were squeezed in for dinner fortunately as we didn't have a reservation. Min spend is 180$.
Worth it though- food was incredible as were the singapore slings!
Best thing to do in Singapore"
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,We visited here one evening and enjoyed spectular views of Singapore. The cocktails were slightly on the expensive side but I expect that in a Singapore. A fantastic evening with a great atmosphere
,,nothing special,3.0,,"There are other tall buildings with incredible views of the city, so i would not bother trying to get here - not worth the money and time."
,,Don't bother,3.0,,"Although an iconic building you'd be better off going on the Singapore flyer if you want views of Singapore skyline,. You pay $20 each to go to top, this can then be used towards your bar bill, service was terrible. We had 1 gin and tonic..very weak with flat tonic and cappuccino in a very small cup and still ended up paying an extra $14.
The ground floor of hotel where reception is was like a bust shopping centre so I imagine a nightmare to stay there especially looking at the queues of people trying to book in."
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,This structure was very nice and one of the best for me . It looks fantastic. No other building can be compare with this. It was really a nice place to visit.
,,Had a couple of drinks while enjoying the spectacular view,5.0,,"Went for a quick drink the other day and ended up staying for hours. S$20 to go up to the skypark but this is credited against any food or beverage purchase.

Terrific service, great snacks, awesome cocktails, topped only by the amazing views. A great afternoon!"
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must do attraction in Singapore. The entire Marina Bay Sands Hotel will leave you wondering how it was constructed, but the observation deck on top will leave you breathless with wonderful views over all of Singapore."
,,Wow,5.0,,Absolutely another one of my favorite places to visit in Singapore. The views are spectacular. Providing you can stand being 200m above the ground.
,,Could have been so much better,3.0,,"Fantastic views of Singapore. This must be one of the best places from which to see the city. However it is expensive (£28). You cannot get a completely panoramic view as you are only allowed access to around a quarter of the platform at the top and if you want a drink you have to go down to the ground floor and pay again to enter the bar on the top floor, which is a major disappointment."
,,Singapore Visit and Cruise!!,5.0,,"Absolutely wonderful experience, the views are spectacular and the cocktails amazing! A fantastic vibe and atmosphere and not one to be missed if you visit!!"
,,amazing views,5.0,,"We went up to the cest la vie bar and had a cocktail about 24 dollars each
amazing views, a must for photogaraphers.
sadly was raining but did not put damper on our visit
my advice just get the lift to the bar and enjoy the views there rather than pay"
,,"Views, Views, Views...!",5.0,,"Singapore tourism has nailed it! Again...!! This place is suitable for all ages and groups. While the cost per visit is on the higher side, you are allowed to spend time as much as you want and there is no rush. On a clear day, I was told you can see even the neighbouring islands...!!!"
,,Must See Highlight of Singapore!,5.0,,"This is a good value. Go through the lobby of the Sands hotel and you will find a place selling tickets for 20 Singapore dollars to go up to the tower. The views are worth the price, but the ticket allows you to use your ""investment"" to purchase food, drinks or souvenirs. We had a great snack and awesome views there!"
,,Marina Bay Sandfs Park Singapore 2/2017,4.0,,"walked around the bay and passed the park, where erection of various light installations for the light festival took place, nice walk"
,,Gorgeous views!,5.0,,"We went twice to the ""observation deck"" during our visit to Singapore. Once was on a Sunday after going to Gardens on the Bay and the second time was on a Tuesday in the afternoon after walking around the bay (while it was sprinkling). Each time we took the elevator to the 57th floor from Tower 1 and were able to look over Gardens on the Bay and the ships in the bay. It was an incredible view and did not cost anything. If you just go to the 57th floor - there is also a bar (open to anyone, you just need to buy an expensive drink) and pool (requires room key) on this floor. After getting back home to Texas, after doing some research, I just realized there is also the paid Skypark which looks like it has amazing views (can see both sides of Singapore). If money is no object, then you may want to try that...otherwise this is a good alternative but realize you will only see the Gardens on the Bay side. We didn't take any pictures the second time since it was raining, but our pictures from the first visit were amazing."
,,Crowded!,4.0,,"The hotel is huge! Not my style at all, a city in a city. Although the roof top bar was good, it did not feel like a part of a giant hotel."
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,Great place to visit though a bit complicated to reach. The cocktails were amazing. Very expensive but worth it nonetheless. The views from the bar are spectacular .
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Amazing views, great photo opportunities...and you can see for miles. We just did the ticket to the viewing floor..good value."
,,Best place to see fireworks at night,4.0,,A long queue to go there and ticket price is expensive. Best it is best place for seeing Singapore city from birdeye view. It is good place to watch fireworks at night too. But not good place to shoot photos because of a lot of people.
,,The view and the cocktails,5.0,,"The view of the Marina from the top is amazing! Great to be in the bar, paying for a cocktail instead of an entry ticket is not a bad trade-off at all. Watching people by the pool is part of the entertainment too."
,,Great view in the evening,4.0,,"We joinEd an evening an tour, booked from the hotel ,which included the light show at the gardens and a visit to marina bay sands observation point This was great- very vibey and the view was exquisite- would recommend"
,,Questionable value for money,3.0,,"Firstly there are superb views from up here and you can see for miles in every direction.
They charge you $50 dollars just for a photo.
The cost of the ticket to go up here isn't worth it in my opinion and I wouldn't do it again"
,,A fantastic place to have a drink or two,5.0,,57 floors up and the drinks are on the expensive side but it would cost you 23 SSD just to go to the top whereas going to the bar is free and you can then spend the 23 SSD on a drink. fantastic views of Singapore. Just has to be done!
,,View to die for,5.0,,"Wow, what a site! For starters you are taken back by the actual architecture of the building, with its curved walls and boat like structure seemingly balancing on top, then you get to the sky deck and holy cow what a view. You have to pay about $25sing that I can recall, and you don't have access to view the pool or eat at the restaurant unless you are a guest of the hotel, but the view is amazing. If you are scared of heights you might like to pass on this activity. I spent at least an hour just looking at the skyline and picking out sights I could see. The Grand Prix track, merlion, boat quay, parliament, so many things to see, Indonesia, Malaysia, the gardens, skywheel, and the amount of ships in the malacca sea was amazing. Looking up the coast to Changi and seeing al the apartments you are able to get a real sense of what Singapore looks like. Loved it!"
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,One bucket list done more than super amazing view it's heaven on earth you must go there one time fantastic 😍
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Beautiful deck to look over the city. Was not crowded either so very comfortable even on a Saturday! Staff very efficient and friendly. We had already walked all around the Marina so it was fantastic to look down on it from a different angle. If you are not in a rush you can also have a drink on the 56th floor & soak it all in.
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great view easy to get to Location best views on a clear day it's a pity you can't pay to use the pool
,,Ho hum..,2.0,,"We opted to do the Skypark over the flyer given we had done the Eye in London, and that this spot was higher than the Flyer. Further, we wanted to experience the amazing building.

The good: the view is nice.. it's roomy. Um... the view is.... um... nice.

The not so good: Does not represent good value for money. Needs a cafe or bar up top. Not outdoor shelter against the rain. Expensive. They charged an asleep 2 year old $17.

There are plenty of towers and observation decks in Singapore. Plenty of roof top bars and attractions such as the flyer, Sentosa cable car etc that will offer great views. The view here is excellent but the skypark offers nothing more than that for the premium price. Honestly, even the building was underwhelming. Disappointing.

Look elsewhere."
,,An amazing view,5.0,,"We took the opportunity to visit the Skypark - it was not easy to find our way there, but we kept asking questions and eventually where direct outside of the building and down escalators and then we paid the entry fee ($20each) from memory. It was a spectacular view."
,,There are better views else where,3.0,,We went up on our first day in Singapore it cost about $20 you dont get to go to the very top where the waveless pool is that is only for the hotel occupants . Don't go up if its raining you will see nothing. After four days in Singapore we went upstairs to the Swissotel The Stamford for a drink and saw the views at night. Save your cash and buy a drink and see the laser show instead
,,Amazing building...challenging architecture,4.0,,This place is amazing. We only drove past it twice on tours and unfortunately did not have time to go inside.. but its on our visiting list for next time. The veiwing platform on top connecting the three towers has to be one of the wonders of the world dot to mention SCAR -EY. Marina Bay Skypark is a pleasure to look at - it must be even nice to be in.
,,Incredible,4.0,,The sight is fantastic will take he trip up to the top next trip in August as we ran out of time this last one
,,On top of the world!,5.0,,"57 floors up! The views were breathtaking. We had drinks at Ce La Vi while looking at the city on one side, the Singapore Flyer and Gardens by the Bay on the other. We loved it!"
,,The place makes you appreciate it cost 8 billion to build.,5.0,,"Most tourists (like me) purchased a ticket to go to the observation deck BUT from that deck, you can't see the incredible swimming pool hotel guests use. Instead, find the check in queue for the Ce La Vi restaurant and sky bar. You pay the same price as you would to go up to the observation deck BUT that amount is deducted from any food and beverage you consume! Wish I would have known that at the time. It's a great place for a drink and some lite dining with a spectacular view."
,,Views must be stunning,2.0,,Didn't quite make it to the Skypark as it was very very busy and the cost of the lift up to the top was too expensive. I know they have to cover their costs however we thought it was one $ too far.
,,Great view,4.0,,You need to pay to access this unless you stay at the hotel. Has a great view. But i didn't stay too long because it's raining.
,,Great view.,3.0,,"Cost is SG$28 to get up there and the views are spectacular. There is a kiosk for drinks and snacks in the deck area, but you can also go into the bar and/or restaurant for a better experience and a more comfortable visit. I have only been there in the day, but looking at the promotional materials, the night view looks impressive too, although I imagine it might be busier then."
,,amazing views,5.0,,the view from here is magnificent you couldn't paint a better picture. 3 beautiful hotels amazing bay with beautiful gardens. would like to come back and stay here next time.
,,This building is just amazing,5.0,,This building is something that must be seen. I love the amazing architecture its unlike anything that I have seen before. We did a night time tour for photos and it was something special.
,,Very Nice place to go and see in Singapore,4.0,,"Definitely must visit place, If you are confused between flyer and sky park, than you should choose Sky park."
,,Not worthe money,3.0,,"Very expensive view of marina. Not even the highest view point in the area. Even the ticketing staff said there were no refunds for a disappointing view - suggesting to us that there had been some complaints before. There was a small inadequate concession stand at the top which sold hats and tee-shirts. We knew and accepted that the infinity pool was for residents only but on the day we were there the bar and restaurant was also only open to hotel residents. All in all, save your money and spend it on some of the many other great attractions around the marina bay area."
,,Stunning place and stunning views,5.0,,"We had been recommended to visit Marina Bay Sands and were not disappointed. Went up to the rooftop and sat on the terrace overlooking the harbour with our drinks and tapas. Staff were very friendly and helped to find us a lovely seat. Wonderful views all round, not cheap but well worth the visit"
,,Fabulous from the inside - Majestic on the inside.,5.0,,This building is awe inspiring. It's almost scary how imposing it is. There's even a giant infinity pool on the roof. I think it's the most impressive building in Singapore.
,,Great place,5.0,,One of the best places to visit in Singapore. Provides a breathtaking view of the whole city and is a must visit at night.
,,Awesome Experience to be on Top of the World at MBS Skypark,5.0,,"The experience at MBS Skypark was just awesome and simply one-time life experience and it is one of the tourists' attractions NOT TO BE MISSED when you are in Singapore.
There are drinks outlets and even photographs that you can purchase from and leave you and loved ones a lifetime experience in Singapore.
Fantastic, Unblocked and Clear views on sunny days will satisfy your heart contents and make you feel that this earthly world is so pure and beautiful."
,,Perched,4.0,,Birds eye view of Singapore for a cost of $23 .... You can relax and sit up there on the wooden floor for as long as you like. Be sure to carry your own umbrella just in case theres a drizzle. They try to sell you a photo of yourself with the building as the background for $50 which I found very steep... Makes sense if you are in a large group. There's a trendy rooftop at the top
,,A Grand View of Singapore,4.0,,"From the Skypark on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel towers, you have a commanding view of most of the city-state of Singapore. You have an especially good view of the downtown area, the Singapore Flyer and its surrounding area, as well as the many components of Gardens by the Bay. Before traveling to Singapore, the thing we heard the most about was the infinity pool on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, but from the Skypark, visitors are not allowed to go to the pool or restaurant. They are totally reserved for guests of the hotel. From one corner of the Skypark, we could see a little of the pool, but not what we had hoped...especially given the rather high cost of this attraction."
,,great views,5.0,,"great views from top, you cannot access pool unless you stay at hotel but you can see swimmers from side view, souveniers slightly expensive, the floor flexes under high wind (which it is designed to do) and near the edge I felt slightly uncomfortable but away from the edge 2-3 metres all OK Altogether a must do especially on a bright sunny day"
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"The building is unique and the view from the top is spectacular. Pricey but with not that much to do in Singapore, a must see."
,,Fun stop in Singapore,4.0,,"Very interesting design for a hotel, casino and restaurants. Wonderful views from the top. We did not stay here, stopped in for drinks and stayed for dinner."
,,A hotel worth staying at even for just a night,5.0,,This hotel is one of the best places the infinity pool on the 57th floor is a big WOW we stayed for one night enjoyed the extensive breakfast and the view from our room.
,,Outstanding view - Worth it,5.0,,"We had lunch at Spago and took in the amazing view, Though we had a full lunch one could just have drinks and some fries."
,,come and see stunning this view from the roof top !,5.0,,"Strongly recommended to go there in evening. Though we haven't visit Marina Sand rooftop day time, but we believe night city lights are looking so much more beautiful comparison to what day time view looks like. An attraction closes at 22:00."
,,Wow,5.0,,"No matter how many times i visit this place - or stay - I always enjoy. For the size and style - the staff are ever friendly, and what to help. It is appreciated."
,,Magnificent scenery,4.0,,A great tourist attraction. Overlooking the beautiful city of Singapore. Early evening will be the best timing.
,,Watch the weather,4.0,,"The views are amazing, but before you spent the money make sure you have the type of weather you want. We knew that clouds were coming so took the chance and went up anyway. We didn't have perfect views of the city, but we could see the storms coming in. Overall the experience is ok as long as you understand that you only have access to the sky Park and not the other guest areas. It's a once in a lifetime view."
,,Awesome place to visit you can see everything from up there!,5.0,,"This attraction is suitable for everyone unless you dont like heights in that case not for you. This was an awesome view of all of the CBD and surrounds of Singapore including the harbour. We spent most of an hour up there at least, you could spend a lot more time than that depending of your level of interest. You can also view to the top of the Marina sands resort hotel."
,,Wow what a structure!,5.0,,"Friends had told us about the building with a boat on it....so we were curious!
We weren't disappointed!
Apart from the expensive ticket just to go up a lift ...56 floors....23$ each...the view was spectacular and worth the trip.
We are pleased we did it!
At the top there's a snack bar serving drinks and nibbles.....
Tho if you want o book and have a posh meal you can use the hotel section.......you see these three towers are a hotel! The guests have a pool etc on the other end to enjoy......but obviously that's not open to the public."
,,Great place for a cocktail,5.0,,Great place for a cocktail . Staff are really friendly and service excellent . The views from the 57th floor are fantastic and drinks not over priced .
,,Amazing,5.0,,Located a the relatively new developed Singapore river Comprises of beautiful shops Restaurants of leading world known chefs Teatres Music indoor and outdoor A big casino And a top pool on the roof With stunning view
,,Excellent City View,5.0,,Fantastic views at the Skypark; Those who love photo-ops will definitely enjoy their time here; Really fast elevator!
,,Stunning view of gardens and city,4.0,,"You can get discounted tickets through the hop Om hop off tours and save s few dollars.

We visited at night as we had done the Singapore Flyer in the daytime. So the views were very different. You get a photo on the way in $30 for one pic and a special package of $75. for two in folder, very touristy but your probably only going to do this once so.....

It was a great view of the Gardens by the Bay and if you are up there at 7:45pm or 8:45pm you can watch the light show - can't here the music though.

Stunning views of the city and bay side, worth the money to experience the view..

We also visited the Spargo Restaurant at the other end of the building for a drink. You can't really get the same clear view but it was good to indulge in a little luxury..."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,"When I first visited the Marina Bay Sands skypark, I felt astonished. Swimming in a swimming pool at 57th floor hotel was really an experience that you should never miss. It sounded impossible like Babylonian building but it was real and luxurious. The sunset view of the city was great but it was a little bit cold. You could enjoy free entry by being the hotel guest. Otherwise, you might need to pay a fee for admission. It was worthwhile because it was a once in your life experience."
,,Excellent views,5.0,,"The pool was over crowded and the water was chilly but the views from the edge were stunning. Later we managed to find a couple of warm jacuzzis on the side, which was very relaxing and slightly more private (and had a view of the other side, which is the Gardens by the Bay). A recommended experience."
,,OMG amazing views!,5.0,,Okay I have to admit the building alone was amazing. It's three hotel that looks like a cruise ship is sitting on top of it. The casino is hopping and you have to show your passport going in & coming out. It's a very lively place and a MUST SEE!!
,,"Overpriced and underwhelming, have a drink to save money!",2.0,,"There are two ways to get to the Skypark -- one is more expensive than the other. The sucker way is to pay $23 per person to get up to the 56th floor, and walk around a bare deck and take pictures. Mind you the skyline of Singapore minus Marina Sands is like Paris without the Eiffel Tower.
The second way is to go up to the 57th floor, and it is free if you dine or have a drink in the restaurant Ce La Vie. Minimum purchase is $20 per person, which would get you a $16 Tiger Beer or a $24 cocktail. So you have a better view, and a slightly overpriced drink and the view, and save money. The elevator for the 56th is below ground level in tower 3. The one for the 57th is at ground level, just inside."
,,Terrific view,4.0,,We picked a clear day for paying to go up to the top and we weren't disappointed. The view really was terrific and we stayed up there a long time so although it was expensive I would still say it was worth it. Only part of the deck is open to non-hotel guests but that is made clear to you by the staff at the ticket counter. They also forewarn you if there is a chance of rain to give you the opportunity to re-think before paying the entrance fee.
,,Blagged it to the top then failed,4.0,,I wanted to see the views and experience the luxury and maybe even try Wolfgang Pucks famous cuisine but alas as much as we made it to the top I wasn't quite on the ball as they have a lot of security gates only passable if you have a card or they've left them open lol but 55th floor takes to the next lift if you can get passed the gym gates but the girl on the desk would not let us onto nirvana lol but if you say want to have a drink in the bar at £15 + a drink you may get past the gatekeeper lol
,,Highly recommend you visit this,5.0,,"You must go up here. It is in the 57th floor of the hotel. We went to concierge and we arranged to have lunch at Spago on this floor. I think you have to pay a fee if you are not having lunch up here. The views are amazing. There is an infinity pool up there as well. You can only use it , if you are a guest of the hotel. But a whole park like setting in top of the building all in the shape of a boat."
,,beautiful & unusual,5.0,,"again, it is a nice place to start exploring, on the very first evening, when you've just arrived. fantastic views from the top, Gardens by the Bay just nearby and lots of interesting eat/outs & offers inside"
,,Wonderful view,5.0,,"Wonderful place!!we (2adults and a 6years old) went to Flight bar on the top of the hotel.booked in advance.we had a wonderful table overlooking Singapore.watched the sunset,which was amasing!Great coctails,good little snacks,fantastic friendly service!"
,,Great view,5.0,,You have to visit as the view of Singapore and part of the F1 track is spectacular however be warned it is quite expensive. We were fortunate and being a first of the hotel we had free admission but it is one of those things you have to do in Singapore.
,,Wondeful spot for pictures,5.0,,It's the best swiming pool in the world on the top 57 floor. Great view. Nice for pictures. Marina shopping is in front of.
,,A must to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"Breathtaking views from the top deck even with bad weather. Access a bit expensive though for a limited access to roughly a third of top deck. A full circular path would be much more interesting.
The mall on the ground floor and the spectacular atrium also deserve a visit."
,,Worth it!,5.0,,"We went at around sunset during a weekend, which means a long wait in a long queue (both going up and down). However, the wait (and price) is worth it: the views are amazing!"
,,Great view,5.0,,Amazing views and worthy of going. Prices are up there however you forget that when you see the sights and take the photo's. Rooftop pool looked amazing when lit. Would have to be a must do while in Singapore
,,Words are less to describe this beauty!,5.0,,"It's an experience that you should not miss if you have a chance. Words are less to describe this beauty! Incredibly designed must visit this place in Singapore. Stunning Marina Bay, the world-class cityscape, the architectural wonder and the vibrant colours characteristic of Gardens by the Bay. You haven’t seen Singapore until you’ve seen it from Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, soaring 57 levels above the heart of the city. Quite expensive to go up - $15 each but but at night fantastic view of skyline."
,,Expensive but spectacular view,4.0,,"You cannot appreciate Singapore's expanse until you view it from this vantage point. The lines weren't bad. There is a bar, snack shop and gift shop at the top."
,,The ship in the sky.,4.0,,"Breathtaking views from the top, it has a restaurant and other little shops. We had a Singapore gin sling up there that was really good, also very strong! Worth a visit."
,,Amazing views of Singapore from a must-see location,5.0,,"We went up to the Skylark on a Friday night and it was very busy...but it was worth it. Stunning views of all of Singapore were such a highlight and once we were up, there was not a sense of crowds. Take your time, enjoy the view, even have a rooftop drink if you want."
,,birds eye view in the evening,5.0,,quite an experience but you are restricted to just one small part of the sky park so do not get the full experience
,,A rip off,2.0,,"This is a rip off. Pay SG$23 per person for a 45 second ride to the deck, on which you are restricted to one small area unless you are a hotel guest. As a visitor you can't even access the bar to enjoy the view while having a drink.
Don't waste your time or money."
,,Cool roof top bar at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Stunning views of Singapore and photo opportunities. We went there just before sunset and had a few drinks and nibbles.
,,Singapore skyline,5.0,,Quite expensive to go up - £15 each but at night fantastic view of skyline. Some people took drinks and snacks and sat up watching night come and the Supertree show below.
,,View Over The Bay From 3 Sides,4.0,,"It was around 7:20 pm not crowded at tickets area or while going up to SkyPark at level 56 you will have great View Over The Bay From 3 Sides and we do see also the Super tree grove show from up at 7:45 pm
Then you can get up one level by stairs 57 where the bar also you can have nice photo"
,,Fantastic!!,5.0,,Words are less to describe this beauty...! Incredibly designed.. must stay and must visit place in Singapore
,,exciting skypark.,5.0,,Go to the Marina Bay sands Skypark to enjoy the beautiful atmosphere and the rooftop swimming pool. Don't miss this attraction.
,,MEH,3.0,,"Great views, I went during the day and was told night is better. It is expensive at $36SGD each for a small end of level 55. The pointy stick out end. You can see a lot but think other attractions are better value for money"
,,Great View of Singapore,4.0,,"It's a great view.

Just little disappointed with the small area of the observation area, plenty of places to take pictures without the infinity pools ..yeahh....

With total S$132 for 6 adults, we certainly would like to have 3box of Durians rather than visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark.. LOL...

If you would like to see the best view from the top, you better stay a night at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
,,Sky High,4.0,,"The view from the Skypark was amazing. The view is a summary of Singapore.

We went during the day when it was hot. There no shade nor seat to rest on. And there is only a single shop that caters to your need. But it is worth a visit just for the view."
,,Best in world,5.0,,"visited there during sunset time, the view was amazing. great place to see singapore city from tower. having beer from on top and enjoying show.If you ever visit this lovely country please don't forget to go on top for city view specially evening or night time. After that you may visit mall n downstairs walking."
,,What a superb building and view,5.0,,What a beautiful place. I loved it. Walked around leisurely admiring the spacious shops. Enjoyed the view from the top. Looking down saw the gardens and water features. This is a truly beautiful place .. a masterpiece of architecture.
,,Awesome,4.0,,Mind Boggling architecture ...... you can just stand and admire this marvel .... rooftop gives you one of the best views of the City
,,Very high up,3.0,,Going up to the top you feel kind of ripped off! It's very hot with the sun beating down on you and no shade. Wheil the view is beautiful your better off going to one of the restaurants and having a drink.
,,Great View,4.0,,"Cost £28 for the two of us. No queue at 9.30 when they open.
Good views from the top although you only have access to one end, not the whole ""ironing board"". Good information boards at various angles and great photo opportunity but go on a clear day! Pleased we went."
,,Perfect views,5.0,,"Great service, perfect views! Must visit place! We did it waiting for a flight. 25 min from the airport."
,,Must stay and experience what's to offer,3.0,,Stay a night here for only S$600per night Have dinner and drinks with your partner Cost should not be a focus in experiencing this place
,,Buy a beer and check out Singapore,4.0,,It's possible to buy a voucher for around $20 which includes ride to top of tower and any drink worth up to value of voucher. Lovely to sit high above Singapore and look out to sea or towards the city scape.
,,Visit to Signapore after a cruise,5.0,,Beautiful city very modern full of high-rise buildings. Very clean lots to see and good feet for walking. People very friendly and helpful lots of ethnic restaurants.
,,stunning view,5.0,,the good weather was perfect for the stunning view. there a lot of tourist here because it was one of the attraction in here.
,,Great fun!,5.0,,"Great service, good food and a spectacular view made the evening drinks great. It was a bit crowded but otherwise lovely. Good ambience"
,,stunning,5.0,,"We visited the sky bar with friends who live locally and insisted we tried out this bar. You pay S $20 for the lift to the 57 floor and get a voucher towards the first drink which seems like a good deal.
The views are stunning especially when the laser show is on.
It was early evening so the nightclub wasn't busy but understand it's really good later."
,,Wow is the word for this manmade marvel,5.0,,A must-visit while in Singapore. Ground to 57 floors in super fast elevator...the view from top is simply breathtaking.however the travel on the entire stretch at top is limited to hotel guests only.however the view points on both sides are simply mesmerizing
,,Amazing view.,5.0,,"For me, it was one of the most amazing views i've seen.
You can see in one direction all the buildings and the concrete, turn a bit and see the green parks and the clean environment, and even more to see the Huge ocean filled with cargo ships which is what makes the port of singapore the busiest in the world.
Do not miss the view!
Costs S$20 entry."
,,Asia Trips,5.0,,Great experience to know the city park are rich with botanical gardens and unique man made design. Good for all ages to visit this park.
,,Breathtaking evening views of Singapore!,4.0,,"Just inside Tower 3 on the right, is a counter to take lift to Level 57 (Ce La Vi outside bar .Pay $20 for a visit & the cost comes off your first drink! Drinks are expensive but well worth the visit to see this spectacular view of Singapore city lit up at night! (You can pay $23 (at lower level Tower 3 to visit the observation deck which has exactly the same view & no free drink!)"
,,scotchy scotch scotch,4.0,,"the bar has a decent selection of scotch at not the worst price gouging I have experienced. I felt lucky that we did not have to wait. No pool access unless you are staying in the hotel so this is for the bar and a nice view. If you just want the view you have to pay otherwise a 1 drink minimum. I suppose I'll have 2.

The view is great. Finding the elevator to the bar was quite complicated. Getting lost inside such of a large building leads to large amounts of time meandering around. Some better signage and moving walkways would be nice. The staff was not as accommodating as I would have expected. They seemed to be suffering from fatigue."
,,Mike Colliver,5.0,,The best view in Singapore you can see the hole of the city from up on the sky park.It costs about 20 dollars worth every penny.
,,Visiting Marina Bay Sands Hotel's SkyPark Observation Deck and Famous Swimming Pool by Comfortable Bus 106 from Orchard,5.0,,"Marian Bay Sands Hotel's SkyPark Observation Deck is a very popular attraction to the visitors to Singapore.
The SkyPark's observation deck is soaring to 57 levels from the ground, and the hotel's swimming pool on its ship-shaped roof top is breathtaking. You don't have to be the hotel's guests to go up to the SkyPark and view the swimming pool. There is an easy way to travel to Marian Bay Sands Hotel by comfortable Bus 106 from Orchard Road at the bus stop in front of Concorde Hotel Singapore. Bus ride takes about 15 minutes and bus frequency is about 12 minutes. Singapore's smart transit card EZ-Link can be used for the ride with one way adult fare of about US$ 0.70. Cash adult fare is about US$ 1.00. [Minors, students, and seniors pay discounted fares]: (1) Direction by Bus 106: Go to the bus stop in front of Concorde Hotel Singapore (100 Orchard Road). Take Bus 106. After about 10 minutes, look outside carefully. When the bus crosses over a bridge with bay water below, get ready to get off the bus. Once the bus stops, get off the bus (This is Marina Bay Sands stop). (2) Walk back the way your bus has just come (along BayFront Avenue) until you come to the entrance to the hotel's Tower 3 on the right hand side. Before entering Tower 3, look for a separate structure in front of the Tower 3 entrance, and enter this structure instead of entering Tower 3 entrance. --> Go down to the lower level by escalator to the ticket counter area. The SkyPark visiting hours are 9.30 am~10.00 Pm on M~Th and 9.30 am~11.00 Pm on F~S. The adult admission ticket is S$ 23.00, and discount tickets are available for Seniors, Students and minors. (3) Before buying tickets, look at the observation deck tour schedule board on the wall, or ask the ticket agents the nearest tour time which includes free visit to the roof top swimming pool. Then, buy ticket(s) for the tour that includes free visit to the swimming pool area. If you have to wait for long for the next tour which includes the swimming pool visit, you can still buy the ticket, and then go inside Tower 3 for a visit to the lower level restaurant/casino/shop complex until 30 minutes before the tour time. Then, return to the tour ticket counter area for your tour at least 5 minutes before the tour time. (4) At your tour time, you will be asked to go through the usual photo session before being allowed to go up to the observation deck. At the observation deck, a tour guide will let you have a free time to enjoy the fantastic view of Singapore city and harbor before assembling at the designated location for your free tour of the rooftop swimming pool area. You will then have a brief visit to the swimming pool area. Then, you can go down to the photo session area, where you will be asked to buy expensive portraits of yourself and companions with SkyPark background screen. Your tour ends then. (5) You can go back to Orchard Road by Bus 106, or you can spend more time at the lower levels of Tower 3, where there are numerous shops, restaurants, various attractions, and a casino. This visit is strongly recommended. [To visit the casino, you need to show your passport: There are separate entrances to the casino for locals and foreign passport holders. They will all end up being in the same casino after passing through the gate control sections. The only difference is: Locals have to pay admission charge, whereas foreigners don't pay admission charge] (6) To return to Orchard Road by public transportation, you have 2 choices. You can use MRT or Bus 106. MRT station is accessible from the lower level of the hotel. To ride Bus 106 back to Orchard Road, you will go to the opposite side of the bus stop where you got off before. This bus stop can be reached via the passage ways at the lower level. You can ask any attendants there for assistance. (7) Bus 106: You can board Bus 106, and get off at ""Winsland Hse"" stop on Penang Road which is parallel to Orchard Road. This bus stop is about one block away from where you boarded Bus 106 to go to Marian Bay Sands Hotel."
,,"Okay, I Suppose",3.0,,"Impressive building with rooftop outside observation deck. Accessible for a fee of $23 (SGD) Complex includes a casino, hotel and convention center. Easy walk to downtown. If you have time and the weather is nice........I guess so."
,,Very impressive.,4.0,,"What an awesome experience. The wind whips through your hair as you look all around the city. It's a great view, and the only disappointment to me is it's a bit pricey to just stand on the roof, but the only other alternative-ION Sky- is a bit out of the city, so not everyone will get there. Still, this is very good. We did it instead of the Flyer, just by our own choice, and probably got the same views."
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"Opted to visit the MBS sky park observation deck, bit costly for what is technically over within 15 minutes but must admit is definitely a must do in Singapore. The views are amazing, our day was a little overcast and very windy but didn't disappoint. Good peak at the infinity pool across the way which was very busy not for the faint hearted!"
,,Overpriced excessive!,3.0,,"If you want a great panorama of the city, then this is your place. However, the people here are attention seeking and complete show ponys. That dale bed the mood of the place.
I paid $35 to get up to the skypark, and was given a voucher for a $20, however most drinks were $30."
,,Sky high,4.0,,"Great views across Singapore. Nice place to sit , take in the view and enjoy a drink - but not 2 !as does add up. But definitely worth the cost"
,,Fantastic rooftop views at dusk,5.0,,"Please visit this great location if you have time book either in advance or queue for ticket at Tower 3 and take the short queue for the lift to a fabulous viewing arena
You must go at dusk to get the best lights / sunset - there is no shelter if it rains though and no seating either - enjoy"
,,Iconic building and astonishing view,5.0,,Well worth the cost of the ticket to go out on the deck to look over the spectacular skyline of Singapore.
,,One if a kind hotel!,5.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore
While I did not stay at the hotel,
I knew I needed to visit it!
We went up on the observation deck
( which is a little pricey...)
The view was beautiful
I wish we had made reservations to go to the bar for a drink but we were short on time!"
,,Amazing scenery but with super tight sercurities,4.0,,"Was there for a staycation with my friends and since we're there, the pool is a MUST TRY, but they were really strict with letting hotel guest in (1 room card to 1 hotel guest). Seen many tourists trying to sneak in but failed at the gantry, you can only take turns to enter, or if not, book extra rooms"
,,Best veiw in whole of singapore,5.0,,"Breathtaking!!!

Must see in singapore. Located on the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel.

Take the lift to the 57th floor and step out to another world. For hotel guests the infinity pool is on the same floor along with a restaurant and a bar.

I cannot described the feeling of beign up so high. Its as if you can almost touch the clouds."
,,AMAZING,5.0,,The MUST to do in Singapore :) amazing place to be and take photos with your family it worths to go up and take photos
,,Stunning views of Singapore,5.0,,It's a must see attraction due to the stunning views of Singapore's most renowned landmarks and picturesque scenes
,,Great view but poor facilities if you are not a hotel guest,3.0,,Great view at the ship on top of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. When we visited the heavens opened and all the visitors needed to shelter in the lift lobby. The view is great - not one for those without a head for heights though. I imagine on a sunny day it would be fantastic. There is a gift shop and somewhere you can get a soft drink at the top but would be nice to have access to a cafe or the restaurant up there.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"Went up to the cocktail bar at the top. Amazing views of Singapore but as you would expect, drinks very expensive. Still water (from a tap I suspect) cost $12 for 1 bottle - take your own! Worth a look just for the night-time views."
,,Amazing views at night,4.0,,The views from the skypark are beautiful in the evening you pay about £10 to access the bar area and this money also goes towards your drink. The cocktails are really good and about £14 each. The Marina bay hotel has another extended decking level which gets the best views however only hotel guests can use this which is a bit annoying. probably best to book dinner here to get the best views.
,,Pretty view!,4.0,,"I would have to say this is slightly overrated. The view is beautiful! However, I wouldn't say it's a must see! I actually prefer all of our pictures where marina bay sands is behind us. We had lunch at ce la vi so we didn't buy the skypark tickets. We were also able to walk over and get a great view of the pool. The pool is probably the best part to see!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Simply beautiful! One view must to look! That shows the significance of Singapore in Economy and Growth.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Don't go to Singapore without seeing the views from the 56th floor viewing platform. It is amazing! You can see in all directions and the view over the Gardens by the Bay and the estuary is particularly good in the afternoon light
,,A great view of Singapore from an architectural masterpiece !,5.0,,"We went to the Skypark , it does test ones fear of heights , but I survived by one walking to the edge A great view of a wonderful city !"
,,Night views,5.0,,Took a whole loop at marina sands. Walked inside the mall. It's a huge 4 store mall with food and shopping along with casino.
,,maizing experience,5.0,,i was there when it was fog and rain the perfect view of the town. the bar up there had a really friendly atmosphere and the prices was normal
,,One among extravaganza Architecture,4.0,,Was quite taken aback when I saw the first glimpse. But travelling alone I did not find much interest to go there and explore.
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,"We enjoyed the amazing views from the observation deck. We were a little disappointed with the small area of the observation area, but the views were spectacular. I am not afraid of heights, but I have to admit that I felt a little uncomfortable standing near the railing to take pictures. The $23 for the experience is a little steep, but it was something we felt we had to do. We found it very confusing to find the attraction by entering through the Marina Shops. Fortunately, there was a concierge there who provided us with a map and directions. Otherwise, we would have been completely lost."
,,Great views,4.0,,"This is part of the huge Marina Bay Sands precinct and its well worth a look for the panoramic views of the city that you get there. Beware the crowds, but by all means go have a look - it's impressive."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"You only get to see a small part of the Skypark, as most is reserved for guests of the hotels. No pool, etc, you go for the view. And what a view. Fee applies but well worth it."
,,Impressive place!,4.0,,It was an interesting experience to visit Marina Bay and the Skypark. I have never been in such a place before. The building is massive and the views around that area are unique. There was plenty of people. The shopping center near the Skypark was also worth visiting!
,,The long way down,3.0,,"For those who aren't staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the only way to enjoy the view from the top is by visiting the observation deck.

As far as observation decks go, it ticks all the boxes, amazing views, plenty of places to take pictures and a bar to by a drink.

What lets this place down somewhat is that as soon as you get to the top level, you discover you will need to wait in a 40 minute line to get back down again, which puts a dampner on things somewhat.

During said 40 minute wait, people were pushing in lines, leading to arguments between people and the whole thing just wasn't very pleasant.

We, foolishly in hindsight went here on a Saturday night, I'm sure there are much quieter times to go when it's not as busy.

Anyway, no question Marina Bay Sands is an amazing area with lots to do, I'd probably just pick my time to go to the observation deck better next time."
,,Must see when in Singapore.,5.0,,Had a few drinks here at the sky bar. Taking into account the magnificent view it isn't even that expensive. And you can spare yourself the Singapore flyer if you want. Pitty it started to rain after 45 mins. Still a must see!
,,Big pool with a great view.,4.0,,"A bit to crowded when we where there, but a great place with a magnificent view. With the hotels ambition and price, i think there could have been more people in the service staff on the skypark, but the quality was great and the staff friendly and helpful."
,,great view at sunset,5.0,,"just buy ticket for skypark before sunset and stay till dark- we stayed 2 hours, 270 degree view including view of gardens of the bay lightshow."
,,amazing building and views,5.0,,"The building itself is exceptional, and the views of the city, river, harbor are unique. It is worth getting there just before sunset, as you can see the city at day, sunset, lights gradually turning on, and at night. The only minor disappointment is that the restaurant is accessible only for hotel residents - and the buffet on the terrace has only some ice cream and soft drinks."
,,Architectural Delight,4.0,,It's a must and anyone has to get into it if one travels to the Gradens by the bay. enjoyed the spectacular views both during day and night time
,,Great views of the city.,5.0,,"Must visit for great views of Singapore on the most popular building in Singapore. There is a 180 view of the city, with the other side blocked for guests only. The inifity pool is also for guests only, but can be seen from the park."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Place to stay once .... The rooms were huge and beautiful .... The infinity pool is one of the best with an amazing view .... Various restaurants offer amazing food .... Breakfast was a huge display ....mind blowing shopping .... Casino added more fun to our stay
,,Sky High,5.0,,"Well this is the most impressive hotel . A visit to the top and the views are amazing . It costs about 25.00 to go up but it is totally worth it. Best time to go up is just before it gets dark so you have excellent views in the day and then watch Singapore light up . There is a restaurant and it is a truly beautiful place to sit , and drink a singapore sling. The Marina Bay Hotel looks amazing , and downstairs is a huge shopping Mall , mostly designer shops . I enjoyed looking ."
,,one place that you shouldn't miss...,4.0,,Went up and it's worth the price of entry .nice view . There's a restaurant and gift shop on top of it.Romantic maybe at night.
,,Mesmirizing!!,5.0,,The observation deck is at the 56th floor of the hotel. Great view of Singapore skyline. The view is mesmerizing during night. It's breathtakingly beautiful.
,,Big view,5.0,,The three towers always catches the eye of anyone who visited the Marina Bay for it is so huge and nicely crafted.
,,Marina bay,5.0,,Super view from the top. Must visit in Singapore. go at around 6 in evening for beautiful pictures and you will be able to see light show also from the top .
,,Very good view and chill out,5.0,,"Suggest to buy ticket for Sky Bar Ce La Vie, which is 20 Sin $, but is deducted from price of a beer, which costs 27 Sin $, the price for Sky View is 23 Sin $... Same view. But with beer."
,,On the Top of the world!,4.0,,One of the amazing architecture! I gazed at the building for almost 15mins. It is just superb! The view from the top of the building is a no match!
,,Must go... view is amazing,5.0,,Skypark which is at the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands is a deck. View is amazing. You have to pay 23 S$ per head to go there. there is also an extension of hotel at the 57th floor. you have to pay 20 S$ and you reimburse that in the terrace bar. Personally I found that more interesting. You may take a chance for both.
,,Think it twice before paying,3.0,,"The view was good, you could check the Gardens by the bay, the skyline of the city and the port. However, you have the feeling that you could only step in a small portion of the hotel and you don't see the infinity pool. Would recommend to attend the bar (I think you have to make a reservation) at the 57th floor and take a drink instead of paying the observatory deck sky park."
,,Day visit,3.0,,"Was ok. No shade once you get to the top so if your visiting during the day take a hat. It was very hot so we weren't there for long. You can't swim in the pool, only if you are a resident or hotel guest. You can't even go and have a look. Glad we went up though, next time we will go up at night."
,,It's huge!!!,5.0,,"This complex dominates the skyline.
Three towers surmounted with a roof top garden, restaurants, swimming pools and a public viewing platform.
It's 74 stories high and the views are breathtaking.
It's a huge hotel and walking through the ground floor you realise what a gigantic place it is.
Hundreds of tourists everywhere.
It also has a huge shopping mall attached with the biggest and most famous names in the shops. It's a shoppers paradise but not for me!
The gardens are also part of the complex and are famous for the futuristic structures like giant mushrooms sprouting up to the sky.
At night there is a light show and it is even more spectacular."
,,Must go for all Travellers .,5.0,,Excellent view of singapore. This is a must go for all Travellers. The view is stunning especially in the evening. Can view almost 360 degree of entire singapore. Definitely a place for folks to take selfies and the view. Very romantic
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, especially for Marina Bay Sands residents as entry is free. Not for people who are scared of heights!"
,,Best view from the sky pool @ 57 th floor,5.0,,We can see the view from Singapore sky line from this park especially By Sunset was fantastic Swimming pool is very Crowded most tourist fr China Must try Dinner in Spago rest
,,Not cheap but a must go bar,4.0,,"Although the prices are not cheap for any drink or snack, this bar has to be visited for sure in Singapour. The view to Marina Bay and Singapour city is simply gorgeous. The other side offers as well a wonderful to the sea.
The cocktail are quite nice and the services is great."
,,Over The Top,5.0,,"We showed up on Valentines Day without a reservation. I had just been released from the hospital after emergency surgery on my gallbladder. We explained the situation to the maitre di and they immediately seated us so we could enjoy the view, and our overpriced but delicious drinks."
,,Over the top,5.0,,"We went to the Skybar on Valentines Day, and despite the weather, the staff was extremely accommodating as we didn't have a booking. I had just been released from the hospital and I couldn't stand for very long. We explained my predicament and they immediately found a table to sit and enjoy our very over-priced but delicate cocktails."
,,Marina Bay Skypark,5.0,,Well when in Singapore you have to go to the Skypark as the view is something else and the infinity pool is amazing. You can only go in the pool if you are a guest at the hotel. You can also have a drink at the Skypark bar.if you take your gold card as 4 drinks cost us $100.
,,Great nighttime view,5.0,,"Definitely one to visit at night and to gaze down on the lights and sights of Singapore. You can see the light show at 19:45 in Supertree Grove, and the fireworks on The Esplanade at about 20:30. Make sure you learn how to use your camera for the best nighttime shots first though ... I didn't!"
,,"Spectacular night views over the City, Gardens by Bay and Harbour made the once in a life lifetime expense worthwhile",4.0,,"As we were going for the views and photo opportunities we took the decision after reading other reviews to pay for the Observation Deck rather than the ' redeeem ticket price for drinks' deal at the CA LA VIE.
The Observation deck appears to us to offer far more space and perimeter 'on the edge' viewing than the restaurant.
You cannot go to the restaurant deck ( or visa versa) so I cant say from personal experience this is absolutely true.

It was a cloudy pre sunset evening when we went up therefore clear distant views were not to be and neither was there a spectacular sunset but the gradual dusk to night views over the City, Gardens by the Bay, Harbour etc made up for it.

The Sands water and light show is not effective from the deck so would be best to leave the deck and go down to see it ( left of the Louis Vuitton Building).

The Light -Sound show at the Supergrove Trees was less of a disappointment but again probably much better in the Gardens.

All in all we would say dont miss the opportunity to go."
,,A wonderful experience,5.0,,Costly for just a lift ride but the views on the terrace were spectacular. Drinking a king size Singapore Sling 500mtrs in the air was truly an amazing experience.
,,Great views of Singapore sunset,5.0,,Must do this $20 each which is taken off the drinks bill Wonderful sunset views. Do not miss! better go to the bar area upstairs than the viewing gallery
,,Had to do it,5.0,,Lol check in was quick got upgraded to higher floor room had great views and easy access to rooftop pool where youll need a camera lol hotel has acccess to LRT and shopping mall which is great
,,Over rated,2.0,,"Overcrowded, understaffed, cold water, not enough seating. All in all disappointing when this was the selling point in our hotel choice."
,,Expensive but great view.,5.0,,"Not sure what else need to be said...can glimpse the inaccessible infinity pool, and see into the equally inaccessible restaurant, otherwise just enjoy the view in all directions and buy a drink or two."
,,High pricy but worth a visit,5.0,,I brought some friends there during their first visit in Singapore and they where amazed by the scenic view from the skypark. If you're a first time visitor in Singapore it's a must do!
,,Christmas 2016 - our honeymoon,5.0,,"we were there over the christmas period and although it was closed of and very busy, the atmosphere was lovely"
,,Pool water is a cool as the weather,3.0,,I was left chilling after dipping into the pool which is way too cold to get a nice swim. The view is spectacular in all angles. How I wish that the pool is heated to maximize enjoyment of the facility.
,,"Great Views of the Singapore River, Bay and Gardens by the bay.",2.0,,"Although a brilliant experience, it is expensive at S$ 23. each. The viewing platform is very plain and exposed, there is no where to sit, or shelter from the wind or rain. There is a restaurant, however strictly for guests only of the hotel. We went early evening to take photos of the lights around the bay, we had to wait 1/2hr to pay, cash only, because the card machines were down, another long wait for the lift up, and another long wait for the lift down."
,,For completion sake,5.0,,Walking across from Singapore flyer to Gardens by the bay we visited the sky park. Because the Marina Bay Sands is an imposing structure its viewed better from far.. views from the sky park are okay. Its just a short detour so can be accomodated in any itinerary. Would think of staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel though !
,,Cheshiresupermum,5.0,,Went up to the 57th floor of the hotel where the boat shaped floor is. Spectacular view of Singapore. Place was buzzing. Had cocktails at sg$28 each. Worth it for the view. You can pay for a ticket to use the infinity pool on the roof too.
,,Amazing view all over Singapoure,5.0,,Wonderful and for life memorable view of Singapore and especially architecturally interesting building. I love this part of Singapoure and whenever I want to come back there.
,,Not worth it,1.0,,"Not worth the 20 singapore dollars to visit the 58th floor. If you are not a guest of the hotel, they treat you badly. This is all about the money and zero customer service. I would not recommend a visit"
,,Great Park,5.0,,Its One of The Great Skylark Located in Singapore Best Hotel Marine Bay Sands The View Of City From Its 56 Th Floor Is Superb Excellent Place To Visit
,,Farewell evening a success,5.0,,"We had seen the daily lightshow the prior evening from the Marina Park, and went the last evening to the MBS roof-top bar. Stylish seating, gorgeous views, people swimming in the infinity pool right next to the bar, spectacular!
Drinks and food are different, creative and pricey, befitting Singapore.
An exceptionally good experience."
,,Best Views of Singapore,5.0,,"Probably the best views of Singapore are available from the sky park, both the city and the coast can be seen with it's multitude of ships waiting loading / unloading. It's pricey if you aren't staying in the hotel but hard to match."
,,Fabulous place to visit.,5.0,,"We called in here while visiting Gardens Bty The Bay, what a fabulous place, a real must to visit, and especially ""Sky on 57""."
,,Incredible night time views,5.0,,"Amazing experience,well worth the visit. We went at night time,we would have liked to view in day light but we ran out of time."
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,"Well worth doing fantastic views all over Singapore and the harbour, we went up on an overcast day and views were still breathtaking. The entrance to the hotel is well worth a visit in its own right, with spectacular architecture inside to marvel at"
,,Awesome Singapore view,5.0,,Four of our family members visited this place. Awesome view from top. Limited place on the top for walking around. Price felt bit expensive.
,,Amazing view from the deck,5.0,,"My husband and I initially came in the afternoon to the skypark but unfortunately as it was raining quite heavily outside , we were kindly told that we would need to come back when the weather was better and purchase tickets then . Thus we came back after a few hours towards the evening and honestly the view was stunning, you could view the light tree show from gardens by the bay , see the harbour and just generally Singapore from up above .

The staff were lovely but the queues to get and take the lift up were busy and to get out was also busy but honestly well worth it and everyone seemed cordially .

Also on a side note , we thought you could maybe view the fountain show from the skypark but were told it is better to go down and see it by the water itself .

I would recommend the skypark , the hotel is also stunning with the architecture design looking beautifully unusual ."
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a experience not to be missed unless you don't like heights. I must say it does seem a little expensive but when you get to the top of the Hotel and take in the excellent panoramic view of Singapore it is good value
,,No place like Marina Bay,5.0,,"You haven't visited Singapore if you haven't been to the Marina Bay, it really is that simple. I would recommend an evening visit because the area is beautifully lit up. There is also a light show every evening....FREE....and definitely unmissable. It's breathtakingly magical."
,,Dinner at Cie La Vie,5.0,,"Great food in a great location. Food superb, views stunning, very popular. Tip to get to the restaurant quickly - go to the base of Tower 3. Can't say any more!"
,,On top of the world,5.0,,57th floor up with a lovely breeze the day I went 😀 fabulous views. No seating apart from the floor but you can buy drinks and snacks. Worth the visit
,,Expensive view of Singapore,4.0,,Ok the views are amazing. It's $26 each to access these views. To be honest if you've spent 3 days looking around SG then you've probably seen most of the views already. I would certainly visit at night. I would expect the night views are spectacular and best value.
,,Nice view,5.0,,You want to have a view of Singapore and feel top of everything this is the place. A 20 min visit is enough if you visit the observatory.
,,Yonosay,5.0,,Good place very clean just no bubble. Gum as it's illegal here smh you can great deals also lots of competition flying here so you can fly from jfk/bos/ DC. To duabi stay 3 ngts then off to SIN and pay only 685.00 roundtrip like. I did with Emirates great airline and great service enjoy Singapore
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"It was a Sunday afternoon and very busy but worthwhile for the view. Usual heading through ticket purchase and elevator ride, compulsory photo and pushy sales, then freedom to walk around and what a view. Once is enough though!"
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"On your drive the airport this structure stands out amongst the landscape. Although I only viewed it from the exterior , I hope to visit again and stay there"
,,Beautiful views,5.0,,We just arrived at the top of that hotel..we can see beautiful sightseeing and arround Singapore City..
,,Very good,4.0,,"It's a good experience, but it cost 23$ to visit the sky deck. You might as well pay $20 & visit the bar, you can claim your ticket back against a drink. Give it a go"
,,Amazing view over Singapore,4.0,,Singapore is one of the most amazing cities in the world. At night the view from the Skypark is amazing. You can see over the whole Singapore and the lights are breath taking.
,,Nice view,5.0,,Very nice walk and view to Marina Bay Sands with its nice garden. You can go up to one of those artificial tree for a superb air view !
,,Great view,5.0,,Went up to the 57th floor and had a coffee in the restaurant. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Didn't need to go to the viewing platform as there were enough opportunities to take photos from the restaurant.
,,Magic views,5.0,,Amazing what with the infinity pool bars and restaurants plus the observation deck it has to be one thing you must do while in Singapore the views are great woud love to go again
,,Incredible views and experience,5.0,,We opted to go for cocktails and avoided paying the $20 lift fee. the downside is drinks are very expensive but it was a lot of fun and the views are breathtaking.
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"This was our first trip to Singapore, passing through for 3 nights on route to Auckland. This hotel stands out across the skyline and is instantly recognisable by its distinctive shape. The ground floor is busy but when you get up to your immaculate room, the hustle and bustle becomes a distant memory. The quality of the rooms is second to none. You can chill out, go to the casino, go to shopping mall or take a dip. Something for everyone. A great choice, especially if your budget is not an issue."
,,Incredible view,5.0,,"Best time to visit is half hour before dusk, you get to see the fantastic views in daylight and lit up at night."
,,Stunning views.,5.0,,"Fairly new to the Singapore skyline, the Marina Bay Sands hotel is between the marina and the Gardens by the Bay. The top section looks like an ocean liner sitting on top of the three main towers of the hotel. Whilst you can go up and get a cocktail and look at the infinity pool via the restaurant/bar Ce La Vie (oddly incorrect French), going to the Skypark allows a fabulous view all round one end overlooking all the main areas of SIngapore. The views are quite amazing although you need to pick a good day. Refreshments are available from the kiosk."
,,For the best views of city and bay...,5.0,,Exemplary views make the effort worthwhile. Base of tower 3 is where you gain access. Pay $20 to go to the top floor but redeem on drinks. You might have to stand as seating limited. Guests get to go to different areas but even so I'd say this is a must do for great views of Singapore
,,Iconic building with great view,5.0,,"One of the top iconic buildings in the world offering great views of Singapore's best part.
It's nice during daytime, and awesome to be there at sunset.
If it's raining, avoid it, but you will be refunded if rain is catching you in less than 1 hour.
They make picture of you at entrance, for a souvenir, basically adding you digitally in front of the building, but you can notice it's fake. I think is overpriced for what it is, but I still bought it for the first time... :)"
,,ok - over priced,3.0,,it's a mission navigating around this place. not clear. you get lost. too much walking - and nowhere to sit down anywhere in the building or on the observatory. they actively prevent and prohibit anyone sitting down!! bad finish to long days and very very annoying getting from a-b ..no straight forward signage.
,,Beautiful architecture,5.0,,"With a trip up to the restaurant at Marina Bay Sands, simply a gorgeous lunch with simply stunning views over Singapore, a must do"
,,Marina bay sands skypark,5.0,,"Its a fantastic place for photography. Its opposite Merlin, the symbol of Singapore. Boat ride in Malay river takes you around the park with beautiful views & good photography. Recorded voice guide system gives akl information as you take the boat ride ."
,,Nice but expensive view,4.0,,"Visited the sky bar recently in the evening to take in the view and a drink. Both were very good with lots of pictures taken whilst watching the firework display as part of Chinese New Year celebrations. We managed to get free tickets from our hotel for the sky bar so it made it a better visit, would I have paid to visit, yes probably, would I pay again, probably not unless the view changes substantially."
,,Great views,5.0,,"We visited here during a night tour. You go up to the Sky park in a lift but do walk through some of the hotel.The views from the Sky park are incredible in the evening ,we would have liked to have stayed for longer & had a drink but not possible on a tour"
,,Great 270degree views of Singapore,4.0,,"The Skypark is a great vantage point for viewing the city, the Gardens and the harbour. There is a significant glass barrier for safety, but also serving as a wind blocker which was necessary when we were there. There is a kiosk where food, drinks and souvenirs can be purchased also. There are plaques located around the perimeter pointing out places of interest. As an alternative, if you wish to visit after midday, instead of purchasing a Skypark ticket, you can purchase a $20 voucher to the Skybar, travel to level 57, enjoy the same views, and put the $20 voucher towards a drink!!"
,,brilliant views,5.0,,We wanted to go up the trees by the bay but unfortunately there was a xmas fayre on. So we decided to go up to skypark viewing platform we wernt disappointed the wiews were awesome
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,Mind blowing place were can panoramic view visible with heavenly services.Staff was very friendly and helpful.
,,What a view!,4.0,,"As a part of the a tour that began with the Orchid Garden, we ended the day with a trip to the 56th floor observation deck. Despite the overcast and threatening weather, the view pulled together the descriptions of two days of this unique city state"
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"Spectacular views of Singapore on a clear day and dramatic architecture. Wonderful place to take in the surrounding buildings and get a good perspective of the city's skyline specially at night on clear evening. Also you can get a drink and something to eat and take a look at the infinity pool of the Sands hotel, probably one of highest pools of its kind in the world."
,,Great view,5.0,,"You can purchase vouchers 48hrs on line before your intended visit (to make sure you get up there on the day you've chosen) print them off and exchange them at main reception in tower no1 for your tickets to accsess the elevator whic is located at tower no3. Just ask for directions to the elevator when you collect tickets it's about a 10min stroll no problem.
There is a fantastic view of the city and surrounding area when you get up there ,well worth a visit in my opinion. If you want to see the light show properly i would suggest you view from down below from around where the lion water feature is located opposite the Marina Bay Hotel because you can't see very much of the light show from the viewing deck. We went up at dusk to have enough light to take some pics before the sun went down and then capture the city skyline and the laser show when it got dark. You don't see very much of the laser show as it is mostly consentrated on the M B S Hotel.
I think it was $23(SP)pp for a ticket to the top."
,,Nice views of the City Skylines,4.0,,"Exciting views of the city skyline from the skypark. Imagine being some 191m off from the ground, in the open, and free to wander around the glass free observation deck for a good 360 degree view! Good photography locations are restricted and tripods not allowed (obviously). Go only when the weather is acceptable. Best to avoid visiting when the air is polluted or hazy from possible forest fires from nearby countries. Blocks your entire view!

Note: Tickets can be bought online and one month in advance. Or you can purchase on the spot. Please note that ticket only allow you to visit the Skypark Observation Deck. The famous 57 storey infinity pool is off limits and for the guests only! If you were to go to he pub only, you can have access to a 360 deg view of the marina, but you cannot go to the Observation Deck (previously allowed). If only at the skypark to enjoy the view, take about 20-30 mins tops. Grab a drink at the bar instead (everyone must have one drink), and you can enjoy the view of the city from the pub at no additional charge, when standing outdoor! Go if only for a one time experience. Otherwise, too dear for a view of the city. Go to the tallest HDB nearby instead."
,,Stunning views,4.0,,The views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands are amazing. You can see right over Singapore which gives you a great feel for the island country. $23 is pretty steep to get up there hence my 4 star review.
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5.0,,If you are in Singapore even if it's only for a couple of days on your way elsewhere I would put this at the top of my to do list. The views of Singapore are spectacular. We have visited it in the day and evening . Lots of lights in Singapore so the night views are spectacular
,,Nice views,3.0,,"The views are amazing , but if you are staying in a hotel near by , you will probably get a similar view from your hotel room. . When you go up to the sky park you only have excess to a small area to view from, good for taking a few photographs"
,,C'est La Vie at Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Restaurant located at the top of the 1st tower with great panoramic views of Singapore and beyond. Amazing atmosphere and food. Staff very friendly and although the experience was expensive, for a special occasion, this is a fantastic experience!"
,,Have to do it!,4.0,,The views are spectacular- it's a must do. Signpost direct you so that you have to walk the length of the hotel - it's a long way and when we were there during Chinese New Year it was very busy area. However it was a quieter once up top.
,,observatory deck of marina bay,5.0,,"if you are not staying in marina bay,
then this is the best place to connect with this,
one of the largest man made object,
made on man made island.

you have to buy a ticket to reach this observatory deck of marina bay.
you get to see amazing view of singapore,

you see almost all the corners of singapore.

its a nice place to spend some time,
you can buy some food and drink and enjoy the singapore view."
,,"Expensive, but incredible view",4.0,,"Marina bay sands is an incredible building with great view over the city of Singapore. For visitors of the viewing deck, there is a 23$ entry fee, which is a lot. You can buy snacks, drinks and souvenirs there, although you can get those elsewhere a lot cheaper.
The viewing deck is perfect for people who didn't bring fancy clothes and can't go to the bar. Otherwise I would recommend to dress nice and have a drink at the bar, or come on casual Sunday."
,,"Opt for the viewing deck, not the bar",3.0,,"We chose to buy tickets for the bar, the price of which includes a drink. Except the drinks are expensive and my cocktail was mostly water rather than champagne. The only part of the bar we were allowed to use was the smokers' area. And our view across the city was across the viewing deck, so we'd have been better off down there. It was all a bit chaotic, and I can't really recommend it. I preferred the bar at the National Gallery with its lovely views and calm atmosphere. The Skypark is too much of a scrum for my taste."
,,Excellent view,4.0,,This is an iconic attraction of Singapore. I am glad that I choose this attraction over Singapore flyer. This skypark is on 56th floor. It gives excellent view of the marina Bay area. We visited this place around evening time. So we could enjoy both day and night view.
,,Worth the Views,4.0,,The cost of traveling to the roof is worth it for the views. There is a restaurant/bar as well. Only a portion of the roof deck is accessible to non hotel guests.
,,High tea high up,4.0,,We decided to have high tea on the boat on the roof rather than lunch . You have to go to tower 3 and pay 20 dollars to get up to the roof eating area which is refunded when you eat . Having high tea means you don't pay for expensive drinks and there were some nice pastries if you have a sweet tooth. The views are wonderful. However it isn't cheap but nothing is in Singapore
,,Amazing place to visit,5.0,,This is an amazing place to visit. The view is wonderful. Drinks are a little expensive but well worth it. I would love to come back and stay in the hotel just to be able to swim in the pool. A must when visiting Singapore.
,,Good views.,4.0,,"Queued for tickets, queued for lift but views are good although people sitting right round edge. Light show disappointing so queued for lift to take us down again!"
,,Two expensive for what it s,3.0,,"The view is certainly amazing : there is no doubt about it. Yet of course you do not see the Marina Bay Sands itself (which makes it less interesting than Supergrove Tree or 1-Altitude if you consider MBS as being THE symbol of SIngqpore).
But the fact is that is much to expensive for what it is. At that price you can at least have a drink in other ploaces, while enjoying the view.
The good point in people not having drinks though is that you can move easily from one place to another and see the whole city."
,,Great view amazing pool!,5.0,,If you can into the infinity pool it is well worth it!! The skydeck is good too and if you can do both even better!
,,Great Views of Singapore,4.0,,"This offers you great views over Singapore, although it's not a huge area to walk around and desperately needs more seating. You can't access the pool area if you aren't staying at the hotel but you can see it. The complex is HUGE and offers shopping, a Casino and plenty of food outlets to enjoy."
,,best view,5.0,,Cost $20 to go to top with bar & restaurant but your $ applies to first drink of which the usual cost is 24-26. Can see the infinity bar up close but not access it unless staying there. Great diversion.
,,It's a landmark with restrictions,3.0,,Good hotel It's absolutely huge 5 star not a chance Hordes of tourists It's for the thousands not the few
,,High place to see singapore,5.0,,"3rd visit . This time it was made comfortable. As a tour saw whole city, floating stadium, high buildings and sea. Pride of singapore. One must see while visiting this country."
,,Singapore from above,5.0,,"The view from this place is jut incredible. You can probably see the entire city from up above. The sea with the boats in it. The land with its talk buildings. And the sky with its beautiful clouds. To all photographers out there, I recommend visiting this place."
,,Not for the faint hearted!,5.0,,"Although I have an issue with heights, the fact the SkyPark has a bar at the top settled my nerves. Best time to visit is at night, where you can view the Marina Bay light show and take in the astonishing city scape at eye level. There is a glass wall around the normal level, but if you stand up on the stairs to the bar/restaurant you can get the perfect non restricted shot of the skyline. Although a little expensive for a viewpoint, it is a fantastic experience to see the views from up high."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This iconic landmark towers over the bay and we could not resist going up to the 57 th floor to the viewing platform. It cost 23$ each which is quite expensive but we thought that it was worth it for the tremendous views. Be careful if you buy the photo - you can haggle for a lower price!
,,Superb Views!,5.0,,"This is not for those who don't like heights as you are stood on the bit of the ship that sticks out over nothing. The views are amazing though.
I went in the middle of the day and it was very hot and hardly any shade so I would suggest missing the parts of the day when the sun is strongest.
Also everything on top is very pricey, they take a photo of you and superimpose the building into the background then want 70 dollars for it"
,,Smart casual clothing for free lift,3.0,,"First time I was up there we went on a sunday, where you can go to the bar at level 57 in casual clothing for free. Else you need to be at least ""smart casually"" dressed.
So this time we used the elevator to deck 56 for 20$ each. We still had a great view to enjoy."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Nice view from the top of Marina Bay Sand Hotel, It would be better go there at evening with light all over Singapore"
,,Nice view,5.0,,"It is nice view from the top. As a local, I love the scenery from the top with the skyscrapers. The view didn't fail to wow me."
,,Was expecting far more,3.0,,"I understand that these places are there to make money but it was very disappointing when you get to the top and after you have taken in the skyline you find there is nowhere to get a bite to eat or a cold beer.

There is an ice cream stand, but that's just not the way to relax and take in the views. There are restaurants up there but you are not allowed to enter!

Management should go visit Scirocco bar at the top of state tower in bangkok to see how there could improve the experience."
,,The views are outstanding,5.0,,"It's one of those great places to visit and the views are tremendous. Well worth the trip. If your not staying at the Marina Bay Sands then you will need to pay extra, but it is such a great place to see much of Singapore."
,,Nice views but high price,4.0,,Very expensive for what it is. But the view is fantastic. You have to decide if it's worthy to pay for it
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"Get ready to be blown away. Soaring 56 stories above the ground, this is a fantastic place to see the city and a birds eye view of gardens by the bay. It cost $23 p/p, so a cheaper way would be to have high tea (from midday onwards) which is approx $42 p/p includes access to skydeck."
,,Amazing views across Singapore city and harbour,4.0,,"You cannot help but be drawn towards the incredibly impressive building that stands out in the city skyline. After a walk around the Marina Bay followed by a few of shops on the lower levels, any visitor to Singapore should pay to ride the elevator to the 56th floor and take in the stunning views that Singapore has to offer. On one side is the port and views of Sentosa island and after making your way around the front, the view changes to a city landscape and includes many of the other top attractions.

My wife is not a fan of heights, but did not find the viewing platform at all daunting, happily posing for photos while leaning against the glass outer wall."
,,Don't miss this one!,5.0,,It's worth the cost just for the view alone! It was fun to be so high up in the sky and you can see forever.
,,Unrivalled views of Singapore,5.0,,"Looking up at this magnificent building is enthralling. Looking out over the city and coastline from the viewing deck is breathtaking.
Never mind the $23 to take the express elevator to the 56th floor; it's a bargain for views like these!
Or for $22 you can take the stairs up......only kidding!
Seriously though fellow travellers, don't miss this!"
,,Beautiful view of the city,4.0,,"One of the best public places to come to see modern Singapore. One can relax and walk around the open deck and view different parts of the city at your own leisure.

It's like those city towers with special express lifts, souvenir shops, in-house souvenir photo shots etc but the good thing is, it's open deck & spacious."
,,"Expensive and the view is ok, but there's not much to do and no pool access.",2.0,,"It's an expensive trip to the top, which actually turned out to be one floor lower than our own hotel room elsewhere! As everyone else says - you cant get access to the pool, which would otherwise be a huge draw card, There's no seating available and not a whole lot to do."
,,Family Staycation,5.0,,The hotel was superb. The highlight is the sky garden of the hotel where you can swim and have a breathtaking city view. Price is a quite steep. This is my second time there. Will be back again
,,Amazing vistas!,5.0,,This is a great place to see the city of Singapore from above- They also offer Yoga Classes in the mornings- early.
,,A must see,5.0,,Great views of Singapore during the day but also at night. Great to have a drink on the top terrace.
,,Singapore valuable icon,4.0,,"It's on the 56th floor on the top of marina bay sands tower. Perfect time to view whole of singapore from above. It's just like a top mountain but made of a triple tower combine together to put on a big ship above. Very expensive at cost 23 sgd but for once a time, it's ok."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"Well worth the money to ride the life to the top deck.
The views of the city and the bay with all the ship's layer at anchor is well worth it.
Even my good lady who is scared of heights walk out onto the glass platform."
,,Amazing views of the city,5.0,,"The skypark offers stunning views of singapore city, the lightings at night are simply amazing and breathtaking."
,,Expensive but great views,5.0,,Gr8 views of the city but but careful what you pay for- if you go to the desk at the base of tower three it costs $20 each to go upto the the cest la vie bar on floor 57 where you can redeem $20 worth of food or drink. If you go down the escalator to the sky park entrance it costs $23 each and you get a lovely view but no drink from floor 56.
,,Sensational Views,5.0,,"We opted to view the skyline from the Skypark after sunset. The lights on the Singapore skyline are sensational. If possible I recommend going to the deck near sunset so you can catch a day and night view. Also, buy the ticket for the Skypark viewing area. It is much better than the cheap ticket where you get a drink. The drink ticket does not give you access to the beautiful viewing platform."
,,Fantastic View - But Pricey!,4.0,,Its a pricey attraction but the view is amazing and worth seeing! If a view is what your after you could pick between this and the Singapore Flyer (you don't need to do both). There is also a restaurant up the top if you wanted to pre-organise lunch or high tea. We were probably only up there for half an hour or so but you would stay longer if you wanted to read all of the history information provided.
,,Once in a lifetime! Because once is more than enough.,2.0,,"I came with another friend and we brought a Japanese friend as he wanted to visit. It was also my first time here despite being local. We unknowingly sat at some seats that were reserved. A waitstaff came over to tell us that it was reserved for members and walked away. We left the seats without a fuss and ventured inside the restaurant. I asked another waitstaff where we could sit. She pointed at an empty table and said there was a chair there. I guess I must have been blinded. We sat down anyway and we ordered some drinks. After a while, another waitstaff handed me my drink over the couch. I stared at him for a while and he asked if this is what I ordered. I said yes but I thought he would have placed it on the table. Immediately, he delivered the rest of the drinks on the table instead of handing me over the couch. This place is highly recommended if you are an angmoh visitor as the service treatment would probably be vastly different from my experience. The view is great but the service quality leaves much to be desired."
,,An amazing structure!,5.0,,"This hotel forms a backdrop around the bay and gardens. It is an amazing structure, and we were able to walk through the building. It was possible to pay $23 to visit the viewing area at the top, but we chose not to do this . Time was limited and it seemed a bit pricey at the time. If I returned, I'd probably do it next time."
,,Modern avenue,5.0,,We had a couple of appointments in the high rises. The view from the offices was super and the area very clean and well kept. On our last visit to singapore we had visited Marina bay sand resort which is worth a visit and the infinity pool and roof top restaurant superb.
,,Fly by visit,4.0,,"Spectacular view from The Garden by the Bays, definitely something worth seeing at night - in saying that the architecture is something to admire and behold by day & night.

I would highly recommend walking through the gardens and seeing Marina Bay from a distance followed by seeing it up front which you can do via walking through the gardens."
,,view is great - but very expensive,3.0,,"even for a child over 2: you have to pay!!!!!!
we went for a visit and it was worthy: for the adults

so i rather go to the palyground with sprayers for the kids: see playground area 10 minutes walk in the gardens

helpul for yu?!?
then go and have fun!!"
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Amazing views, but very expensive. Worth a visit and a drink, but very crowded. A red-hot for the typical tourist."
,,Beautiful Location,5.0,,"This is the best place to see entire Singapore from the roof top Marina Sands Hotel. Please note that if you are not a hotel guest, you will pay Singapore dollars 23 for the entrance fee and you can buy from the basement of the hotel. Thanks."
,,Expensive views,2.0,,"Expect to pay $23 if not staying at the hotel. It is high and the views are good, but it is restrictive access and not worth the money. I expect it would be better if actually a guest at the hotel and enjoying the infinity pool."
,,Beautiful Hotel....,5.0,,Four of us had a dinner there..and the prices weren't over the top...but the food and service was great. Great experience...fantastic staff...and best of all...we got to relate to the staff..who were very helpful and as we made it a point to interact verbally...were given a tip on how to get to the top..for free...and walk around and admire the amazing view. As always the staff are typical of Singapore...even tho of 'other' nationalities. Would definitely suggest a walk through and perhaps a meal.
,,Amazing,5.0,,This structure is absolutely amazing if you can venture up to the infinity pool you will be astounded !
,,Amazing views this is a must see,5.0,,Traveled to Marina Bay Sands sky Park as part of a weekend getaway in Singapore the views were amazing you could clearly see all across the bay and also the Business district skyline . this is a must do for anybody visiting Singapore don't forget to bring your camera
,,Great hotel,5.0,,"The hotel pays a lot of attention to detail, and with the pool on roof, I would recommend everyone stays here for a couple nights if in Singapore, its restaurants, gardens, views, pool, gym are all outstanding, well worth the premium the hotel charges"
,,Guess what.. A must do!,5.0,,"If you have a Singapore sling.. have one here! expensive but worth it! Freshly made! The views are stunning... Aim for Sunset!!! Night views are phenomenal! Pool is only for hotel guests, but bar anyone can go!"
,,Must see,5.0,,You have to visit this now iconic hotel. The $22 is worth it. The views are stunning from the deck. The view of the hotel is also stunning from the ground
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,"Wonderful view of the city and drinks were surprisingly reasonable considering what a tourist attraction this is, and despite some hesitation, we are really glad we went. We visited at night and the view was remarkable. The music however was extremely loud even though there was no one dancing. Great place to party with friends, but a little too noisy to enjoy a casual cocktail."
,,Best view and good for take pictures...,5.0,,"I always bring my guests to Skypark instead of Singapore flyer. This one has a better view and there is no time restriction.

You should plan to be here by around 6 pm in the evening so that you can get the best view of the city in both day light and night. Carry a tripod for the night shots."
,,Top view,5.0,,Went here in the afternoon til sunset. Wonderful atmosphere and views. Had high tea which was nice. Pastries were bit too sweet.
,,The absolute top of the top,5.0,,"I never thought, that I will return to here one year after my first stay in 2016.

Because of the price.

But, what Do we work for all our lives, if not for something special?

So I booked three nights, because I wanted to show this kind of luxury to my girlfriend, too.

Ok, the prices during chinese new year are expensive, of course. Nevermind.

View from the 30th floor over the city?
View from the infinity pool on the 57th floor over the ocean and the city?

Almost everything in this hotel is a new definition of superlative.

BUT not the fireworks.
NOT the fireworks.

NO, those NOT.

Way too short. In fact embarrasing, I thought, there would be a big one from the night of January, 27th to the 28th.

Neither in Chinatown nor at Marina Bay Sands."
,,Best Views of Singapore,5.0,,"Excellent place for taking pictures. You could spend an hour here, not more than that. The view of infinity pool from the observatory deck is not great though.
Slightly pricey considering the fact that theres no activity to do here. Avoid afternoons as it can be very hot on the top floor of the tallest buildng in Singapore"
,,Ultimate in city views!,5.0,,"Very good views of the city all around. It's in the sun, so in the heat it wouldn't be good to stay long. Morning would be better- before the sun gets too hot and the platform gets crowded."
,,Best views in the country,5.0,,This is certainly a place to visit. The view from here are among the best in the country. You can literally look over the whole city.
,,On Top Of The World?,4.0,,"Stunning view of Singapore! A great place to grab a drink and just pause and enjoy the sights. Of course drinks & meals are not cheap but it is worth it in view where you are. Very crowded and if you are taking kids with you, please be extra careful. And people you meet here are very friendly always ready to take a picture for you. The outlets staff warm, friendly and very efficient! Highly recommended! For senior citizens you get a discount!"
,,"Have a cocktail here, it would be rude not to.",5.0,,Great place to have a drink or two and admire from up high. We got a deal where you pay $20 which will get you to level 58 and you get a $20 voucher to use towards food and drinks. Cocktails are $25-$30 but well worth it just for the view.
,,Sky high,3.0,,Best views to see the Singapore skyline. Restaurants however overpriced leaving a bitter after taste. Pool was somewhat crowded.
,,A great view,4.0,,"We spent all day looking up at the Marina Bay Sands, there was no way we weren't going to go up to the viewing deck.

What we loved:
• the view of the city was unparalleled, we saw out to the shipping lanes and past then Singaporean border
• a birds eye view of some of the spectacular Singaporean architecture
• helpful directional signage that told you what you were looking at and photographing
• amazing iced coffee, frozen drinks and 15$S frozen Singapore Slings

What we didn't love:
• the excruciatingly overpriced fake tourist photos - look, I love the tacky tourist photo more than most... but $90S for two photos that were taken in front of a green screen...?
• nowhere to sit and no shade... Singapore is hot, right? So on a really exposed activity like this you would expect some seating to enjoy your drink or enjoy the view... there is no seating and no shade UNLESS you go to the extremely overpriced bar and restaurant which had a dress code and you need a reservation for
• the ticket says valid till 11pm but... it's one entry only, so we left thinking ""we'll come back later tonight to wavy the Super Tree lazer lights..."" we got to the gate and we're told ""valid for one entry only"" this needs to be made clear at ticketing as many places allow repeat entry, and with tickets worded like that....
• NO access to the pools, bar or restaurant. There is no ticket or pass that gets you into the pools - it's for guests only. I get it, but if they had more inclusive entry at a higher rate that had access to a pool and pool bar, I would have done that in a heart beat. The bar and restaurant require a reservation and have a dress code. Tickets to the Skydeck DO NOT get you into them automatically

I would still recommend this activity it's just really important to be aware of all the pitfalls."
,,Great Sunrise view,5.0,,"I am a morning person and enjoyed watching sunrise. The pool was smaller than I expected, but was pleasantly surprised to find a few warm jacuzzis opposite the pool. If you are staying at the hotel, then definitely make time to visit this."
,,execellant,5.0,,Its really nice place . We loved the skywalk and spent quiet sometime there. small restaurant is there at top. .Please try to go in late evening to get both day and night views .Take Map to roam around in the mall .
,,Sensational,5.0,,"A sensational place to watch the sun go down! Given it costs you to get to the top with that value also credit towards your first drink it kinda softens the blow. The staff here are not as accommodating or friendly as anywhere else I've been in Singapore, seem to be such an inconvenience to them, the service is so slow. Just focus on the view and enjoy yourself people."
,,Late afternoon/early evening is best,4.0,,"Lucked out visiting on a quieter night, plenty of room to wander around and see most sides of the city. Access is right up to the edge of the building, plenty of opportunity for spectacular photo's and you also have a great view of the Gardens by the Bay light show in the evenings."
,,Happy Stay.,4.0,,"My family and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 2 nights - 2 rooms on the 31st floor and 1 room with a super view on the 42nd. We were very impressed with your customer service. Hotel lobby had an airport feel to it a lot of hustle and bustle. Stuggled with variety offered at breakfast more in the way of Mediterranean would have been great, something for management to consider. Infinity pool very nice can get overcrowded, need to go either very early or late evening. Hot pool in tower 2 a bit run down. Overall our stay was good."
,,Disco dissappointment,1.0,,"$20 each will get you to the rooftop bar then that $20 ticket becomes a drink voucher.
As soon as you step out of the lift at the top you're in a very loud disco and your $20 voucher will not even cover the cost of one beer :(
The barman who was too busy to serve us even though we were the only ones at the bar and you can't here the person next to you.
We were there for about 10 mins.
The Singapore Flyer has a better view and very peaceful."
,,A real golden sands hotel,5.0,,A real golden sands hotel. Come here in the evening. Better at about 5;30 to 6;30. You can see it golden face. Its beautiful and amazing.
,,What an amazing place,5.0,,Came here to Singapore for a business trip and went to this amazing place for a drink in the evening - lots of lively busy buzzing bars serving drinks food and cocktails - an amazing experience must go x
,,Amazing,5.0,,Entire Singapore under your sight from Merlin statue and national gallery to gardens by the bay and harbor area.
,,"Stunning architecture, restaurants and shopping",5.0,,"We spent New Year's eve at a restaurant on the top of the boat. Simply stunning view of the city of Singapore and the midnightt fireworks below! The shopping centre at the bottom is beautifully laid our, classy and does not feel crowded. Lots of natural light and more designer shops than you can imagine!"
,,Much luxury. such awesomeness. Wow,4.0,,"Shopping, business, luxury, view - all in one place. This was my second time to Marina bay sands - never tire of the sky bar. Sunrise yoga/pilates on the observation deck was to die for."
,,Great Views,3.0,,The day we visited it rained & limited our view. You pay $20 each to ride the very fast elevator & present your ticket at the bar. You can generally find something to drink for that price. Very friendly staff. You cannot get into the pool area though. Limited outside standing tables with umbrellas or inside seating but no view
,,Great view but overpriced,2.0,,Although the view was impressive it wasn't worth the nearly $100 it cost to take my family. We were also told that if we'd gone instead gone into the bar and purchased a drink (rather than purchasing tickets at sky park desk) we wouldn't have paid admission at all and seen same view
,,Great place,5.0,,Rooms were excellent. Pool was glorious with unbeatable views. Prices of the restaurants were unfortunately exorbitant. Though the food court in the shopping center was well priced. MRT was close a very convenient. Trips cost atound $1.40 SIN.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Really amazing views and atmosphere. Pricey but nice to check it out. The pool was restricted to hotel patrons only.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and the Observation deck is free for guests of the hotel. It is worth going in to have a look and take pictures of Singapore and the curve of the Marina Bay Sands. The views from this Observation Deck are nothing short of spectacular. If you are a guest, definitely go in and enjoy the views. If you are not a guest of the hotel, I would recommend purchasing a ticket and going to this Observation/Sky Park area the views are fantastic and well worth the money."
,,Wow what a view!,4.0,,We did this as part of a tour. Singapore night tour. Great views across the city. Disappointed couldn't walk all the way round and had I paid $23 dollars been even more disappointed. We paid £37 for guided trip that included the gardens by the bay and river cruise. So well worth the money.
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore!,5.0,,"We wanted to buy tickets for the next day, but we were surprised when we reached the ticketing reception and found out that we can just go up the rooftop immediately if we want. It was a great chance since it was at the time of sunset. The view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands was fantastic and we were amazed to see this beautiful city from above. Taking photos are the main thing to do so that you can remember this unique experience for the rest of your life. In addition, there was a cafeteria at the top which served drinks & snacks if needed. The skypark was a must-visit location and we would definitely visit it again if we come back to Singapore soon."
,,Good for the view that's all,3.0,,"Personally I wouldn't waste my money here. Overpriced to see a limited birds eye view of the skyline. On arrival your picture is taken and by the time you reach the top floor (45 seconds in the lift) your picture is ready the moment you step out and the staff are after ""more dollar"" for your cheesy snap.
I believe there is another building on orchard road (ION Sky) with similar views which is free to go up so would consider that option.
Management also have the right to shut the viewing area if it starts to rain in case of lightning."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Was quite expensive as just get a lift up to top but views were brilliant. No access to bar at top (residents only,). Small shop for drinks, souvenirs only."
,,Worth to go,4.0,,"We were here during the day and at night and I do not know, what was better - the view is amazing!. Remember, the third lift is for tourists."
,,Great view from the restaurant but not allowed out,3.0,,Restaurant looks good but food is expensive and not too good. View compensated for food although we were not allowed outside the outer ring to get a good view as restaurant visiters.
,,You just have to do it,4.0,,The sky park sits on top of a very strange shaped hotel but apart from being expensive to use the lift to the top the view is breathtaking and should not be missed
,,Fantastic for Lunch and drinks,5.0,,Book for lunch it is amazing and the view will leave you speechless. Drinks are costly but the view you get it is well worth it
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,"After buying a voucher you can go up to the roof top. However, not all terraces are accessible. In the bar you can use the voucher for a drink. The view is beautiful and worth the trip!"
,,"Fantastic view, well worth a visit.",5.0,,"On our last night in Singapore we made the last minute decision to head up at night to the Marina Bay Sands skypark, and we were not disappointed. The view of the city at night is spectacular. It was well work the S$24. If I had realised it was so good, we would have booked in at the restaurant."
,,A Gondola Experience in Singapore,5.0,,it was amazing trip around the modern shopping center on a gondola in modern day Singapore - the shops are eye catching and pleasing and one need not travel to enjoy the excitement of a casino if that is one's pleasure
,,"Great views, but rooftop bar was not accessible",5.0,,"We went there on Sunday morning in November. Was worried that place will be packed so I bought ticket online, but there was no queues so it was excellent. I was disappointed that there was no access to the roof top bar but looked like was open. Later I found that if you going to the bar you have to register yourself down stairs. Apart from that great place for taking the pictures, amazing view of Singapore."
,,Wonderful view from top,5.0,,The park is located on floor 56 which provides unobstructed view of the city and the tallest towers. Tourists are allowed only on the deck (pool entry is restricted to Hotel guests). Relaxing. Costs SGD 23.0
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit. Drinks are very expensive but the views are incredible of the city of Singapore. Great infinity pool
,,Spectacular Views at Night,5.0,,"Access to the rooftop infinity pool is only granted to hotel guests. But the view and atmosphere up there is amazing especially at night. Marina Bay Sands is an Iconic Singaporean Hotel, and is a must to stay at if you have the budget."
,,worth going to see the city panorama . Limited food on top,4.0,,restricted to the South end of the building. You can still see the swimming pool but only guests and use it. Wait for a clear day of ou will very little. An amazing building
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Yes you get good views but you pay for them. You queue up to pay and then queue for the lift. Then they try and sell you a photo. Once outside, you can buy drinks and snacks but they don't provide anywhere the sit and enjoy them., do we didn't bother. People were sitting on the dirty ground where you then can't see the view. Never got a sense of being special. Felt they just wanted to extract money from you and that your presence there was a nuisance. 1 star for hospitality and 4 for the view."
,,Fantastic at night,5.0,,"Reasonable price to say that there is no time limit to how long you are up there. Make sure to take a good camera so that you get the most out of the visit. Stress free to buy the tickets and get up there and I'm sure you will not be dissapointed. It took a couple of years for me to agree to go up as I thought it would be a waste of money, but I was wrong."
,,Iconic place to visit,5.0,,I visited on my first day in Singapore and it gave me a great overview of the City. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Fantastic views but can be expensive,5.0,,"The views from the bar at the top at night are a must on a visit to Singapore. We enjoyed it so much we went twice.

Top tip.. entering via the tourist tower entrance involves long queues both up AND down. It is an expensive ticket and the bar at the top, is as you would expect, very expensive. However, if you go next door, through the bar entrance, there is no charge to enter, the bar at the top is nicer, has better service and the queues are shorter."
,,Costly,3.0,,Great views from level 57. But make sure when you pay that you are actually getting access to this on level 56. Unfortunately we paid & didnt know we only had access to the bar & restraurant on level . Staff told us level 56 was for hotel guests only but we found out later this was incorrect.
,,Great views by night,5.0,,"I'm rarely amazed of modern cities. Singapore is one of those that makes me believe in modern architecture - and indirectly in our times too.
Seeing the city by night made me feel I was in one of the very well known major cities in the world (NY, LA, etc.) - and I really was: in Singapore. It's just not a very well known fact from where I come...

Don't miss the by-night views!"
,,Be there at night,5.0,,"Excellent pool and cocktails while enjoying the views over Garns by the Bay and the Marina Bay. The service is amazing. However, the food is over rated."
,,Singapore icon,5.0,,great spot too take in the view of those great metropolis. really love the design lf this great building. the skypark is the cherry on top.
,,Go to the 59th Floor to be wowed,5.0,,Another must not miss attraction in Singapore. This hotel is simply out of this world. Go to the bar on the 59th floor which is expensive but just for the chance to be on the top of the world you have to do it.
,,Great View,4.0,,This is the place to visit if you looking to see the city from above. The view was outstanding and well worth the cost to go up. The pool is not part of this pass and it is not possible to get much of a view of it either. Other than that we would highly recommend going up.
,,Business Dinner & Cocktails,4.0,,Excellent location and iconic views for as far as the eye can see. Great cuisine on offer with great service.
,,The best place to see the city from above!,5.0,,"If you are looking for a spot to see the whole city from above, this is the place. Go to the SkyPark Bar. You have to buy a S$20 voucher to go there. It is still cheaper than the ticket for the observation deck and you can use the voucher to buy yourself a drink at the bar. You will have a view with a drink! ;o)
When the weather is good, it might become overcrowded, but it is still worth it."
,,Wow,4.0,,Great place to visit. Walked around the bay. Had dinner at Fullerton hotel. Watched the light show from the roof top restaurant. A highlight of our visit to Singapore
,,Architecturally amazing!,4.0,,"A very impressive structure. The attraction is beautiful from a distance and, unless you are either prepared to spend a small fortune on dining or staying in the hotel and can make use of the facilities, I'm not sure I would go up again..."
,,i mean you have to go on it.. but,3.0,,"to be honest it was so hot up there and there is limited space with shade. not to mention apart from being at the upper deck the glass does'nt allow for the best photos

For all those that have contemplated, highly recommend to book one night at MBS so you can be on the pool instead!"
,,Spectacular Whimsy/Tourist Trap,3.0,,"It's stunning, - quite simply spectacular. From anywhere nearby, look up to this sleek, curved cruise liner mounted like a trophy atop three buildings, and you will have to admire the imagination of the architect.

But if it makes you want to see it up close and from the top, be prepared to accept the apartheid-like distinction between hotel guests and mere pay to intrude tourists.

Line up in the lobby and buy a $20 ticket to ride to the top (redeemable for credit towards your drink, though) but you will be restricted in where you can walk and sit. And no swimming pool access unless you are a hotel guest. They also earn access to an outer observation deck.

The views are indeed great, both of the city, and of the infinity pool that comprises most of the area. The drinks are a consolation prize."
,,The New New focal point,4.0,,"On a short trip, took a half day to tour the city. I actually liked the city, very well organized, easy to access, with good public transportation -- I mean, I managed to take bus and subway -- like a local. Maybe even more local than the local will do. That is how I like it.

The Marina bay Sands and the area surround it -- the new focal spot of the city. It is hard to put words to the description -- in a city of steel and concrete -- this is a pretty nice (and green) spot, among all the tall buildings and etc. Not bad for a city state, with limited space and a lot of tourists. definitely worthwhile to take a stroll and relax and grab a bite"
,,Fantastic views from top and good shopping inside,5.0,,Spent a full day here shopping in the mall and then had lunch at the Skypark. Went back in the evening for a drink. This is a must do if visiting Singapore. Good atmosphere and lovely cocktails.
,,Wow.,4.0,,"We visited here recently, we arriving by MRT was easy, the ticket office was more difficult to find.As we were in our shorts we weren't smartly dressed for the Bar, so decided to go to the viewing deck.It was around $21 each and we were quickly whisked up in the lift.The view was amazing and we could stay as long as we wanted, although we went around the time of the laser show it was quiet .The hotel itself is beautiful,very large and joined onto a swanky shopping centre.Well worth a trip."
,,Great views!,4.0,,"From here you can see all of SIngapore. Really great views. Unfortunately no restaurants in the Skypark area, just a kiosk."
,,The Observation Deck,4.0,,"I will leave the copy-writing hype to the property owners but suffice to say, typical of sky-scraper roof-tops, the observation deck offers breathtaking and unblocked views of Singapore (and a little beyond). Lovely both in the day and especially at night...it is a must for visitors as well as locals - even if it is the only one time you will visit.

Don't rush the entire experience....bring that camera and take home the panoramic views of this hospitable city state that knows something about bringing the best visuals to all who visit.

The usual entrance fees apply."
,,Expensive but worth it,4.0,,It costs $20pp to ride the list to the 57th floor to visit the bar but the ticket is redeemable against extremely costly drinks. The views are sensational and for my wife Linda this was a must do activity so I went with the flow. A glass of beer and a Singapore Sling came to $50 - you have been warned.
,,Speachless,5.0,,"If i could pick anywhere in the world to go, i would go here! Dont want to spoil anything as this experience needs to be had personally! Norhing beats this place!"
,,Awesome View,4.0,,Great views of Singapore in every direction but there is no way they should charge $23 entry as you only need 15 minutes there.
,,Views views views,5.0,,"Great hotel for a visit but I don't think I would like to stay here. Reminded me of Las Vegas in the lobby. Went to Spago's restaurant for a drink and some photos. Little bit like a zoo looking onto the guests in their white robes at the infinity pool. No privacy for paying guests
The views were amazing though. We had a cocktail and one beer $40. Bit of a shock after Langkawi- $2 beers and $6 cocktails but so what you may only be there once in a lifetime.
Had a look around the many designer stores in the mall, couldn't access the casino because we didn't have our passports with us. Zara had a sale so I was a happy traveller.
All in all it's an amazing structure, not somewhere I'd like to stay though but great for a look"
,,Nice view of the city,4.0,,"If you want to experience the skyline of the city, this is a good place to go. Cool buildings and the singapore lion gives you the perfect picture of this amazing city."
,,Marina Bay Sky Park - Great View,3.0,,"For S$28 per person, it's really a bit costly. Moreover you won't be able to go 360• around the ship. Still, I rate views are worth watching from here. Don't go for expensive photoshop pictures click there by Marina Bay Staff.
Cool Breeze is really great feeling."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The fire works display on new years eve is happening there. Such a wonderful view though it's very crowded on that night.

Access of very easy by Taxi or train. Train exit is just Infront of the park. It is also very closer to the casino entrance too."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"If I was paying to stay at this hotel I would not be happy it is just a tourist trap we paid to go up to the top you then get some money of your drinks!! we went up this is also the floor with the infinity pool ( for the guest at the hotel) at the time the weather had been poor so it was not all open, but they still take your money and keep letting more people to go up so no where to sit and have a nice drink also the drink took over 20 minutes to be poured by which time we demanded our money back and left, in the 30 minutes what I saw just a money spinning waste of time and and sadly could not recommend"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"The view from the Skypark is just fabulous! The S$23,00 entrance fee to get up there was well worth it."
,,Perfect view of singapore!,5.0,,"If you want a perfect view with no time limits on a good weather, then you must come here instead of singapore flyer, entrance to the top is cheaper and you can stay as long as you want but you can't access the pool."
,,Incredible views but limited access,4.0,,"The views from on top of this hotel are phenomenal. For 23 Singapore dollars you have access to about the front 1/4 of the skypark. For extra fees, you can access the bar area. Worth it for the views."
,,Great place in the heart of the city,5.0,,"If you are tired after long walk around Singapore city centre - this is ideal place for a break and to relax. Amazing park, lots to do . I highly recommend that you go to visit this atrraction !!"
,,Must Do When in Singapore,5.0,,Check this place out for sure. Avoid paying the entrance fee by booking a restaurant reservation at Spago or the other rooftop restaurant. The pictures are incredible!!
,,Quick visit,3.0,,Not sure about this attraction really having been on the Singapore Flyer it was more of the same. The attraction is just being at the summit of the Sands Hotel rather than the view. It's a great pity that visitors aren't allowed to visit the restaurant or bar to have a coffee or drink but you aren't encouraged to linger I felt and so I'm not sure if it was worth the ticket price as I thought I would at least be able to enjoy the view over a coffee. Rather disappointing!
,,Great view,4.0,,"This destination is basically to watch the lovely view of Singapore! You can see the Gardens by the Bay from above, the skyline behind the hotel and the many ships trevelling in the sea which import and export goods to and from Singapore!"
,,WOW!,5.0,,I don't thing words can describe how beautiful this place is!You must see it for yourself!😍 Add it to your bucket list 😉
,,"Pricey, a very small area provided for visitors, rest reserved for hotel guests",2.0,,"Considering the ticket prices, not worth visiting. Despite the claims on their website, tourists buying expensive tickets are allowed access to a very small area. The rest is reserved for hotel guests only. The view is good but a real let down if you visit based on the description on the website."
,,Not Worth the Money.,1.0,,"My friend took me on an adventure up to the Marina Bay Sands.

What I learnt:

1) VERY expensive to see the view of SG.

2 Ticket Options:

i) $23 To look around the deck
ii)$20 for a drink ticket on the deck with the bar.

Not really worth either. 1 drink is $24 which is much more expensive than going to a market and over the price of the ticket.

2) Should you need to utilize the bathroom you MUST check in (like a toddler) with an employee.

3) Beautiful view not worth the price.

I do not recommend this. Unless you want to fork over a large amount of cash to see a view."
,,Family vacation,5.0,,"The hotel is amazing and the location it is even better, lots of things to do around the hotel, the pool is amazing and the views unbeatable."
,,Truly a park in the sky!,4.0,,"Finding your way into the skylark can be a challenge, as you go into one of the towers and across the central atrium of the hotel to reach the gardens. But, once there, it is an interesting concept. In fact, once in the park, you get a futuristic feel to the whole thing - kind of fitting as that is how this part of Singapore can make you feel. The skywalk is a short adventure giving a different perspective to this amazing city. Entrance to the park is free but the skywalk will set you back only a few dollars - well worth it for the view. All in all, another interesting thing to do in this amazing city!"
,,Just Awesome,5.0,,Had dinner at the rooftop restaurant this was just amazing food taste is good and the wine served was excellent. ..had a great time ...the view was just amazing
,,Amazing view of Singapore,5.0,,"Fabulous view from the skypark over Singapore city and surrounds, Good value. We were heading off on a cruise the next day, could see the cruise ship."
,,A Magnificent view of the city.,5.0,,We visited the observation deck at night and were greeted by a splendorous view of the city and surrounding area. It was monsoon season so a bit blustery and rainy but in no way a deterrent to taking great photos. No visit to Singapore is complete without at least one ride up to see the panoramic view of the city.
,,Stunning view,4.0,,"Our ticket to the view included a drink of beer, wines or soft drink. There was a queue, only a limited choice of beers, no wines left. The area is not comfortable. They obviously want you to have a quick look and go back down and yet it is such a beautiful view. It would be so nice to relax in the (slightly cooler) night air and enjoy a drink. But there was nowhere to sit and the drinks ... well."
,,Breath taking view from high up,5.0,,plan for late afternoon and just before it gets too Dark. sometimes rain could play havoc to cancel the viewing.
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,You can see Singapore view from up here.. The most suitable time to visit is around 6pm so you can see day and night view from up there..
,,Best views in Singapore,5.0,,"I had read about this place before we arrived in Singapore - about a rooftop bar and pool on top of the hotel. So so so much more and worth a visit! We enjoyed a drink at the bar - and the views were spectacular - the Gardens by the Bay that we'd seen the day before and which seemed large - appeared small. Views out to see with all the boats, over the Gardens and docklands - nothing short of stunning. A must-visit!!"
,,"Architectual wonder, best of modern Singpore",5.0,,"We visited after a trip to Gardens by The Bay and the domes. We were able to get up to Level 57 without the usual entry fee (find the correct lift in Tower 1 (there are three towers)
It will take you to the viewing platform. If like us that is all you want you will avoid huge costs. (And yes you cannot go into pool area as a non guest). We also went down to the ground and lower ground floor shopping areas afterward , which house many prestige and well know brand stores as well as the food court where we had a good Asian lunch. Plenty of taxis outside to take you onward."
,,"Pricey, insufficient lifts",2.0,,"We thought we would see the light show from this Skypark, so we went at night. Good view, but not a good angle to see the light show. Took us an hour to get down with the very long lift lines, only three elevators. Language barrier was a problem to try to explain other visitors not to cut in line."
,,WOW!,5.0,,The view over Singapore from the top floor is breathtaking! The fast moving elevators whisk you to the top in no time even if you may have to wait a while. Prices are commensurate with the experience which is well worth while. An experience not to be missed.
,,Amazing light show at night,5.0,,Amazing light show at night for free! You also get to enjoy the picturesque Singapore at night. Truly amazing!
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is built on reclaimed land. The area in front is where we have built a reservoir to contain sea water and waste water brought there by the rivers. The water collected is purified into drinking water and this has brought in some relief to cater for our needs.
What we have today is one of the projects of the late Lee Kuan Yew and we are thankful for this."
,,Its the view,3.0,,"Honestly its still amazing to think the ingenuinity of those people who have made this Marina Bay Sky Park.
And because of that a lot of people visit this park that makes this congested.
But if you dont mind a lot of people this is worth your time.

October 2015"
,,Thrilling and exquisite,5.0,,"A must-see attraction of Singapore.Even if climbing at floor 57 it`s going to cost you 23 Singapore Dollar/person , it`s completlly worthy.The scenery from top floor it`s uniques.Pool acess it`s for hotel residents only,so it`s the restaurant on top (Ce La Vie )."
,,A night tour that included going to the top level of the hotel.,5.0,,"We did a night tour that included several places. The Top floor view is amazing, and although I am terrified of heights this didn't bother me at all. Insufficient lifts for the amount of visitors would be my only criticism, other than that, it was a must see."
,,Wow! what building and what a view from the top.,5.0,,"Definitely a place to visit whilst in Singapore, head for the top of the building and the pool deck. From here you can see forever, but don't forget your camera.
You can spend several hours here as the are endless shops and an abundance of eating places, plus cinemas etc.
Definitely worth a visit."
,,Best View In Town,4.0,,"Ideal place to take visitors - if you can afford it. S$ 20+ to go there is expensive, but in clear weather it is a very good view and better than the Singapore Flyer. Recommended."
,,Great way to see Singapore,4.0,,"Love the view from level 56. The entry price of $28,00 per person is worth every cent. The staff taking the visitors photo and then trying to sell them to you for $50.00 is outrages."
,,Expensive View,4.0,,"You have to pay SGD23 to access MBS skypark. I found it a bit pricey. I guess SGD15 price will do. They will offer you to take a photo with fake background of MBS skypark. I guess it's better to have a photo with a real view like what they do in Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. There's only a small bar where you could buy drinks. I noticed that there's a restaurant/bar on top of MBS. If you want to access the bar, there's a security guard will immediately stop you. Maybe you have to access from the hotel's entrance. I don't get the logic even if you have money to pay. Or maybe that's their way of controlling the crowd. Or maybe they have a proper dress code before you could enter. It's better to just visit the Bar instead of going to the Skypark. We went there during the afternoon and waited for the sunset. The view is breathtaking. It was nice when we visited as there's a rehearsal for Singapore's national day. We managed to witness the jetplane rehearsal plus the fireworks! There's really nothing to do up there. Make sure to take hundreds of photos so the payment is worth it."
,,Wounderful,5.0,,You get some great pictures from top and some good drinks. It s a bit expensive but it s worth to to this
,,Don't forget to visit this one!,5.0,,"Absolute the number 1 in places to visit in Singapore! The view is so great... Especially when the weather is good you will have a fabulous view at Singapore, and Indonesia"
,,Amazing Pool with the best view ever!!,4.0,,"A beautiful Hotel.
You have to experience the Amazing pool and rooftop.
Would i go back? NO!
Why? Too much people everywhere and IT effects the customer service.
When you arrive the bell boy does not greet you and check in was very bad. I felt She was in a BIG rush.
But...beautiful rooms, room-service is 5star, the view is just breathtaking, and the food inclusive breakfast is very very good.
I reccomend to book a Club room, with Club access in the 55th floor. Breakfast, afternoon tea and tapas with a super 360 degree view. Worth the extra charge.

Big lines at breakfast, with waiting time. but at the Club 55 you Enjoy your breakfast Peacefully with NO lines."
,,Gorgeous,5.0,,"Handicapped friendly. A beautiful walkway down and around waterfalls, geodes rainforests fantastic natural specimens. Take the tram to avoid the walk to the exhibit Or between 11-2 take the driverless vehicle but don't take both. The destination is the same and the price is $3 for tram all day and $5 for driverless."
,,Gigantic,4.0,,This edifice is unbelievable. It is one of Singapore's show pieces. The structure is gigantic. Cleanliness is unbelievable.
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"Many say that it is overpriced, but considering the St. Louis Gateway Arch is around the same price for a more outstanding view on the other side of the world...it is worth it! It was on and off drizzling when I went with family, but we got the point and took many great pictures. I would do it again provided the weather is a bit more favorable the next go-around."
,,Beautiful Panoramic View,4.0,,"I am a creature of habit. If there is ever a chance to see sweeping views of a City from a skyscraper or high rise building, you will find me at the top. The experience was as good as a view of New York City, from the Observation Deck of the Rockefeller Plaza. $23 will get you a ticket to ride the Elevator to the 56th Floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for this beautiful panoramic view. The Restaurant you will see above you is restricted to hotel guests only. ( Wear a baseball cap, Sun-hat or carry an Umbrella in case the sun is beating down hard and you have a high sensitivity to the sun- or would like to a good amount of time taking in the Beautiful view )."
,,Exceptional experience,5.0,,"We visited the place at evening....when we reached at the height of 57th floor where the park is decorated as like the huge ship, it was an wonderful experience...as if the whole city was in front of us with its modern structures and lighting. After some time there was wind and rain and enjoyed it."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"No comments just perfect ! Stunning view Lift straight to the skyline panorama. Overview of the city, botanic gardens, docks..."
,,A strange experience,3.0,,We bought tickets to the roof and the view was amazing. But something was missing. Were not allowed to visit the next to the top floor as this is apparently for hotel guests only. Staff were ok but not very informative. The tickets we bought to go to the top could have been used to pay for drinks or food but this was not made clear. A bit of a rip off.
,,Fun to Visit Once,3.0,,"For S$23 per adult you get an elevator ride to 56th floor to the observation deck. Before you entered the elevator, they took your picture for a tacky tourist souvenir. The photoshopped pictures don't even make sense because the fake backdrop is the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, instead of you on it overlooking Singapore.

There's no seating area, and some people sit on the wooden floor to rest or hide in the shades.

Once you're there though, the view is quite stunning given it's a clear day. Take lots of pictures because you just paid a lot for that view. There's no access to the infinity pool. There's a restaurant/bar on the 57th floor that might be nice during the night.

5 stars for the view but overall 3 stars for the price and amenities."
,,Overpriced but still a great view,3.0,,Very pricey just for a 10-20 minute stroll on a small deck. But a nice experience to walk on top of this incredible hotel if you aren't a guest a the hotel. The view is nice as you are able to view the whole city and the gardens by the bay behind the hotel.
,,Vastly overpriced,3.0,,"The view is nice, but that's it. You pay S$23 for a 20 second elevator ride, and then arrive at the deck where there is nowhere to sit (people were sitting on the floor) and only a small kiosk selling souvenirs and drinks. At least they have a bathroom. I would have rather spent the money somewhere else."
,,Place to visit at night,4.0,,A little pricy for a family but worth seeing the views at night. Great seeing the laser show and the grove trees from that height. It would have been better if you could sit and enjoy a drink.
,,Awesome view of the city,5.0,,Brilliant and terrific views of the city from the observatory deck. Great photo opportunities and capturing that beautiful sunset before it disappears behind the high rises. Beautiful Panasonic views. A must see place .
,,Great views - A must see activity,4.0,,"If you're into ogling at tall buildings, city-scapes and marvelling at the miracle that is Singapore, this is an absolute must do.
It's a bit pricey at SGD$23, but it's one of those once in a lifetime things.
The cheesy bit, where they try to flog you a very amateurish digitally rendered photo of yourself with the Singapore backdrop, is something for the individual to go for, or not. To me, it's just cheesy and lowers the classy tone of the building and the view.
The bonus of this attraction is the spectacular mega-multi star hotel and shopping mall, wonderful for window shopping and crowd watching.
The entire precinct is amazing and worth a day out with plenty of outstanding photo opportunities."
,,"Great views, very expensive",4.0,,"The MBS Sky Park has great views of the city, a great place to take plenty of photos. However, there is not where to sit up there- no benches or seats. There is no shade, so you are dying in the Singapore heat. It is very expensive to go up just to take photos and have a very quick look around due to the heat."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It felt very high on the 56th floor, and the view was spectacular. It is certainly not for the faint-hearted. If you are not staying at the hotel, you have to walk quite a distance to get there."

,,Mrs elrefai,5.0,,"Waw this hotel is amazing but unluckly we couldn't manage to stay on it . But we managed to have our dinner in one of its resturant 57th floor and it was amazing food ; excellent service and awesome view
We had a window table which was difficult to get but they managed to have one for us .
Highly recommended to people who can afford it ."
,,Great view over the city and gardens by the bay,4.0,,Great view over the city and gardens by the bay from the 57th Floor. Also Nice place to enjoy a drink. This building Also has lots of shops and restaurants on the ground floor. We could not access the pool on the top Floor as this is only for hotel guests.
,,Visited During Semester At Sea,5.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands during our Semester At Sea voyage and made sure to stop here. The Skypark has lots of shopping venues and things to look at. Remember, no Durians allowed."
,,Spectacular View,4.0,,It's an iconic place in Singapore very close to Gardens by the Bay. Have MRT access. The architecture is breath taking.
,,wow,5.0,,simply....wow. what else can i say.... there is no way of telling what you feel with such view. you must live it by yourself.
,,Gorgeous view,5.0,,"The Skypark at Marina Bay Sands is really something to see. Up on the deck all of Singapore´s skyline and off-shore harbor can be seen. It is an awesome sight that should not be surpassed when in Singapore. However, even the most interesting places can have their dark sides.
The Skypark is totally barren of anywhere to sit down and marvel at the wonders to be seen. There is a small shop for souvenirs and drinks mainly soft.
Nobody ever seemed to give it a thought that you may want to sit downs and sip your soft drink. In fact it is forbidden to sit on the floor which certainly is big enough and you may not even sit on the stairs leading to the guests only restaurant/bar.
Now for somebody that is handicapped this is in fact outrageous.
But nobody seems to care.
The view is gorgeous but the area to watch fromis a shame on the proprietor."
,,The view is amazing but visit Ce La Vie instead,3.0,,View is undoubtedly amazing from the deck but do yourself a favour and go to Ce La Vie bar instead where you pay $20SGD per person (redeemable in drinks) and have a better view and less crowds.
,,Worth a elevator ride,5.0,,I couldn't believe how amazing this place was. Very very crowded but it was worth riding the elevator to view from the ship at the top.
,,Awesome view of an amazing city! Must do!,4.0,,Great quick and easy activity to do. Very well priced for the spectacular views you receive when you get up there. Wasn't to busy either when we went up which was even better. We were blown away from going up there so would defiantly recommend it to everyone!
,,Would be better if they werent so strict on guests,4.0,,"Iconic building with an iconic pool, everything should be maximum comfort, however they changed the system such that we need a card each to enter. Inconvenient! Have to go down to take the card. Should implement a system to clock by the number of guests registered in the room, think convenience!"
,,A drink with a view at the Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"We had an after lunch drink with the families to enjoy the view and visit the top of one of the most beautiful Singapore attractions. The formula is ""conveniently expensive"". You are asked to give 20 SD for any adult (12+) to take the elevator and this amount get deducted from the final bill at the bar. So make sure you spend at least 20SD of a drink to enjoy a wonderful view and a very comfortable bar at the 57 floor."
,,An Undeniably Good View,4.0,,"We arrived on Christmas Eve at 9.15am - the doors opened at 9.30am. Buying a ticket was easy and access to lift and facility was straightforward. The whole experience wasn't as good a quality eg, lift system, seating etc as the Hong Kong Sky 100 Observation deck though which we had visited earlier on in December although that is indoors. We stayed for around 40mins, after which it was getting very busy.

The views really are spectacular and when in Singapore for only a couple of days, the choice is to either gain some height and do this or do the Singapore Flyer. You can sit down on the flyer though! There is no seating up on Skypark and no access to other parts of the upper area of hotel such as the pool etc. This appeared to be packed solid at 9.30am and there was even guests visiting the skypark completely attired in the hotel bathrobe and slippers!

Glad we visited, this hotel is a stunning modern piece of architecture, your eye is drawn to it wherever you are in Singapore."
,,great for pics,5.0,,"$25 to take a walk of the end of the Marina Bay. It feels like a bit of a maze trying to find the entrance, but persevere - it is worth it!"
,,Amazing View!,5.0,,So glad to have experienced the Skypark! Makes one appreciate the design and architectural properties of this megastructure! I would recommend visiting at sunset and at night where the city lights come alive :)
,,Looks like a 5.5 billion investment,5.0,,Wow! The infrastructure is really amazing. The shopping mall is high end and has multiple floors. Great to stay away from the heat and do some damage to your credit cards.
,,Great walk,3.0,,It is a place to go if you visit Singapore. You can go during the day or during the night and it's also gracious. Lot's of places to eat around.
,,Get up and enjoy the view!,5.0,,"While it is not cheap, I strongly recommend you go up to the top and enjoy the view of Singapores incredible water front, crammed with boats. The views are remarkable and well worth the time and money. Amuse yourself counting the seemingly endless series of planes that glide into Changi while trying the count the ships."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,This is something you must visit in Singapore. The Skypark on top is amazing and has breathtaking views across the city and bay area. Its an awesome structure and you need to see it to believe it! Don't miss this!
,,Early morning walk to Marina,3.0,,"I have been up before but was at a loose end one early morning . Walked from hotel over to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel , the cost is 26 Sing dollars and once you get up the view is great , no seats at all on the Skypark so people don't sit up there all day you can get an ice cream ad a coffee but standing room only .
If you have never been then I would go but you only do it once now you have to pay .

I was there at 0930 when the doors opened and it was ok but 30 mins later it was very busy ."
,,Fantastic With 360 Degree View of Singapore,5.0,,It is a wonderful place on top floor of Bay Sands Hotel. It provides you the view of 360 degree of Singapore City. Really Fantastic.
,,sky high,4.0,,Bar area was great - lovely to have a drink and overlook the skyline . just check they waiter understands your order dont just assume the international language of drinks applies as you may not get what you ordered. It can be hot hot so dont be shy to ask for the waiter to put on the fan
,,Great views both otherwise a big pile of 'meh',3.0,,The views are undeniably good but for the price it's a very expensive luxury and in no way a necessity.
,,On a cloudy day.....,5.0,,We visited on an overcast day – late morning in early January – no queues – got a senior’s discount – past the obligatory photo opportunity – then 56 floors up to the platform – suspended from the hotel – high walls with security wiring for the most part allows for unrestricted photography – exception is for a short length at the pointy end that is glass – but no problem – at this height Singapore is laid out in front of you – given the day we could see rain showers rolling around the city – creating different light and drama as the tops of buildings disappeared – real bird’s eye view of the Garden by the Bay – really appreciate it design and layout – for a unique viewing experience for the price of S$25 per person is not unreasonable – thank you
,,"View of the Marina Bay, Flyer, and Gardens by the Bay",4.0,,"It's my second time on the Sky Park. Last time I visit, there were no Gardens by the Bay so I'm happy I can see something new on my second time. I still feel the ticket price is a bit expensive for the short time I spent there, but you can't get this view anywhere else. I brought my husband here and it was his first time seeing the night view from the skypark. He was surprised by the beauty of the view and really enjoyed it that I just cannot regret spending $$$ on the tickets.

Some of the guests sit down on the floor monopolizing some parts of the area, I wish the management would make some rules about that though."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Had been taking many pictures of the ship like top of the Marina Bay and decided that I had to go up to the top. As it cost $20.00 to go up but that could be put towards a lunch or drinks in the bar we opted for lunch. The menu was very expensive for lunch time, I decided to go all out and have steak at $42.00. It was very good however, not that large a serving for the price. The service was good and the view spectacular. Could you see for miles and as we were not feeling rushed took a good length of time to enjoy."
,,MR,5.0,,"Visited at night. Bustling with people. Families with children. Went up and got breathtaking views of skyscrapers, F1 racetrack, Straits of Singapore."
,,Unbelievable!,5.0,,Best view in Singapore. Almost feels like you are on a ship sailing above Singapore. 360 view of Singapore.
,,Worth the walk,4.0,,"My husband and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so we were able to walk across to the Skypark....beautiful gardens and water fountains.....and the show at night worth the look...colourful and with music played.
Lots to see there...unfortunately we didn't have enough time to see all."
,,Infinity Pool & City View,5.0,,Great Architecture. We didn't stay at the hotel as it was fully booked. It is possible visit Skypark for non-staying guests. Phonemanal Infinity Pool and great City View.
,,Incredible view day and night,5.0,,"We have had the pleasure of visiting the sky deck at time of day and also at sunset when you can experience the city starting to light up, viewing from the sky!"
,,Views,4.0,,Not cheap for entrance or anything you buy there from photos to drinks but the viws are truly outstanding well worth a visit but watch the heat index
,,Complete waste of money.,1.0,,"It costs around $20 to go up 56 floors walk around a viewing gallery and come down again. It is simply a con in my view,"
,,Opening times for observation deck.,1.0,,"Note that the Observation deck does not open until midday. Also the restaurant/cafe on level 57 from tower1 does not open until 11am! Not much good to those trying to start early to beat the heat or wanting a coffee at 10. Used the cafe downstairs in the hotel lobby and not impressed by service - they spilt my beverage on my trousers, offered me some wet wipes, did not get me a new full glass, and charged us full price!"
,,Outstanding... Do not Miss This!,5.0,,"Ok, I originally thought it was going to be a big yawn....an observation deck on the 56 floor of the architecturally unique Marina Bay Sands hotel. Was I ever wrong! For SGD 28 you take an express elevator that opens onto a lobby lounge and then onto an enormous open observation deck that offers extraordinary city and harbor views! You can even see part of the famous world's highest infinity pool that is on same level ( but you can't get access it from the sky park itself). Plan on 30 minutes and tons of photo ops: view the two biodomes, the Super Trees, the three tallest buildings in Singapore, the Supreme Court, formula one grandstands, the world's largest retractable roof sports stadium and the famous Singapore Lion from a unique sky huh prospective. Don't miss it!"
,,Overrated and silly prices for drinks,2.0,,"We came here for a drink and to watch the laser show. Laser show was superb and free! Amazing for Singapore as everything is crazy expensive even in hawker markets. London seems cheap in comparison. We could not go up to the sky bar as one of our sons was under 18 even though nothing is mentioned about this on the website and they wanted passport id, well who carries that around with them? We settled for the ground floor bar just for a beer which cost us the price of a pub meal for four in London, really over the top and the ambience was like sitting in echoing Liverpool Street train station. Admittedly the outside of the hotel is a sight to see and an amazing architectural structure, best viewed other side of the river at night."
,,A view with a price!,4.0,,"Singapore is very clever. It has exploited one of its true assets: its skyline views. And Marina Bay Sands has jumped on the bandwagon in the exploitation game.

Yes you will see commanding views of the CBD and the ocean lined with tankers and ships. Even the Gardens By The Bay are amazing from an eagle's eye view here. But the price tags and commerciality are really disgusting and a disservice to Marina Bay Sands. Luckily I was a guest in the hotel and got to enjoy some of the perks, but in all reality, I was still treated as a number been squeezed through after being milked of my money."
,,Amazing vistas.,4.0,,"The Marina Sands complex is worthy of a visit by itself. The hotel inhabits three massive towers and the complex includes coffee shops, major restaurants and some (very expensive) souvenir shops.The entrance to the Skypark is by lift from tower three. From memory the cost is about twenty Singapore dollrs. On the dauy of our attendance access was virtually immediate but the facility has the reputation of being crowded at peak times of the year.
On the extensive viewing deck the vists are amazing, across the fishing boat harbor, the Staits of Malacca to Malaysia and to all points of the city, including the river walk precinct. It is possible to buy drinks and snacks from the roof top kiosk. All areas of the view receive explanation from shields set along the viewing area. It's fun to see areas of Singapore of which you are fond from that perspective.
The Skypark is strongly recommended, especially for first time visitors to Singapore."
,,Awsome,5.0,,"One of the greatest pieces of architecture I have seen, the roof top bar and pool is a must do in humid Singapore, best view of the city at night."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Beautiful experience.. birds eye view of the supercity singapore....must go if u r in singapore... its quite and classy...beautiful pics we clicked there... enjoyable time by me and my family...best visit in evening...
,,The best views in Singapore,5.0,,"Wow! What views! This has to go on the ""must see"" list. The only disappointment is that it would be great if there were a restaurant/barup there for non house guests so that it would be possible to spend more money and have a drink. Of course ther is a pool and restaurant but that is only for house guests."
,,Another great view!,5.0,,Loved seeing Singapore from up here. The frozen strawberry daiquiri I highly recommend up here...has a bit of a kick!
,,Killer view,4.0,,"Boasts the best view of marina bay area, which is likely true. The view is simply stunning, and you can move freely on the deck to explore the different view from every corner, as long as the weather allows.

The queue to go up is a little long, but is already like freeway compared to Sears tower or the empire sate."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark- great view,4.0,,"The Skypark is great, if you want to get a birds eye view of Singapore. When you buy your ticket they tell you, you cannot access the pool area which was fine. We bought tickets and then had a photo taken with a green screen. Once you take the lift to the Skypark and exit the lift they present you with the photo which is $75 - you can buy if you like. You then proceed out onto a deck which resembles a wooden boat deck and can see almost 360 degrees. The view is spectacular and we spent a bit of time taking photos and chatting. You can spend as much time as you like up there."
,,A drink at the bar on the top floor is well worth it and seeing this building from a distance is beautiful,5.0,,We enjoyed a lovely cool drink in the bar at the top of this building and lapped up the beautiful views. It is also a very attractive budding to photograph from a distance because of the boat on the top.
,,Dreadful,1.0,,"We went to top to view and have a drink. It was all over crowded, over priced and just a rip off money maker. Don't waste your money."
,,One of the Best Views of the Downtown Core and Marina Bay Area,5.0,,"I had been dreaming of getting to that surfboard-like structure on top of the Marina Bay Sands. The Skypark gives you a very good view of Singapore from a higher vantage point. You get to see the Central Business District, Gardens by the Bay, The Singapore Flyer, part of Chinatown, and part of the Harbour Front area I guess and many more.

SUPERB VIEW OF SINGAPORE!"
,,Great way to pass time,5.0,,Get ready to pay to ride the elevator to the top. Only hotel guests can swim in the pool. It's was a great experience and it's SUPER HIGH IN THE SKY!!Great place to go after lunch and take pictures. A Singapore's bucket list must do!!!
,,Excellent views of the city,5.0,,If you want a really good perspective all around Singapore then this is a must do. From the 56th floor of the hotel - itself worth a visit - you get views all around the key sites in the city.
,,Great views,3.0,,I have been to both the skypark and flyer years ago. Preferred to take my nephews to the skypark cause you can walk around and take photos without glass in the way.
,,Theme park atmosphere,1.0,,"If you wish to be treated as a number in a queue go to Marina Bay Sands. For $1000 AU a night you too can receive a basic room lacking in basic amenities such as quality pillows. You too can stand in queues everywhere, have a mediocre breakfast, be exploited at every opportunity and upon leaving have your luggage left on the pavement for four hours (with all travel docs and valuables accessible to all who walked by) instead of being put into secure storage. Do they care? Not at all. There are hundreds more in the queue. Very disappointing. Save the money. Buy a $20 voucher for a drink. Go to the deck. Enjoy the view then go stay elsewhere."
,,An experience to see the business district of singapore from sky,5.0,,"Though little bit costly (entry ticket), but a very good experience to watch Singapore's Business district as well as the ""Gardens by the Bay"" and Marina Bay from top.

Best time to visit would be starting 6.30-7pm, as one can get the watch from top the two consecutive Light shows at - Gardens by the Bay (west side) and Marina Bay (east side)."
,,Little singapore,4.0,,Most of the singapore attractio s revolve around marina bay sands casino river front garden of tje bay river cruise shopping and others if u want to see better to stay in this hotel to enjoy more
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,It's not cheap to ride to the top of the Skypark but well worth it. The views across Singapore are fantastic. I rated this better than the 'Flyer' and the views over the city and gardens by the bay are exceptional on a clear day.
,,A Ship Spanning the Top of 3 Hotel Towers,5.0,,"This was about the most innovative and beautiful architectural sites I have ever visited - I have been all over the world. Three towers each with 1000 room and a ""ship"" spanning all 3 towers! This was much more spectacular and beautiful than any hotel in Las Vegas. I wish I had more time to explore or spend time as a guest."
,,Expensive but the views......,4.0,,My husband was really wanting to go to the top of this place to see the view. And wow the views were amazing. It did cost $80Aud to go to the top but we spent some time up there looking in all directions of Singapore. Glad we did it.
,,"In my opinion, they charge too much for the drink/view",5.0,,"Yes, it is astounding. But after a long walk along the Promenade, I wanted to sit. But the view was breathtaking. And later in the evening a section opens where you can sit down on comfy chairs. Call them if you can to get more info."
,,Stunning views,4.0,,"Well worth a visit, the views are stunning. And we got some amazing shots. We paid almost 60$ for 2 adults and 1 child (only part of the skydeck is accessible to non guests) so it's pretty pricey but we'd have regretted not going. The hotel is outstanding too (walk through all 3 towers to see) and the full skydeck (inc. the pool) is available for free to hotel guests. The queues for tickets were long and very slow moving though so have some patience :)"
,,Pricey,3.0,,I felt this expensive for what you get which is basically a restricted walk around the deck on the top. Great views once again but it would have been better if you could get access to the rim flow pool which is spectacular I imagine. You get great views of the Singapore Flyer. I suppose it is a must do when in Singapore as the unique architecture of the building certainly beckons wherever you are in the city. We went mid morning and I'm sure it is spectacular at sunset and the evening. You need to do this once at least if you travel to Singapore but you can give it a miss on subsequent trips rather admire the building from afar or even better reside in the hotel and get unrestricted access.
,,Crowded with tourists.,3.0,,The Skypark is somehow a must do in Singapore but hyped! The view from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is nice but you can have from other spots as well.
,,Great Views but overpriced,3.0,,Great views out over the Gardens by the Bay and across Singapore. Good photo opportunities but I felt it was over priced.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you lookomg into just scrolling around the Marina Bay area at night, its a must. Nice view and weather."
,,Expensive - great views,3.0,,"Probably a must-see, but sooooo expensive. Are they trying to make it exclusive, or get as many people through as possible?

$40 cover charge per couple to access - redeemable in drinks, meals - but at $24 per drink you don't 'redeem' much!

Service is great - as you would expect.

Not sure how you 'reserve' the best spots at night. They might be accessible if you are seen as someone to spend on overpriced drinks. E.g. $590+ for a bottle of Moët?

Great views - for a price."
,,Amazing View But Over Priced,3.0,,"Views from the top are breathtaking. The downside it's it's been turned into a touristy experience.

Cheesey picture on arrival that they add a pic of the hotel behind you. They are very quick to get you up in the express elevator.

At the top you can have as long as you like taking pics and absorbing the view. Realistically you only want about 20 mins as nowhere to sit.

Very disappointed not to have been able to have had a glass of wine or a cocktail as the restaurant and bar is restricted to hotel guests only.

You then end up queuing for over 20 minutes to get down as they are holding the lifts and filling them at the bottom.

In my opinion it could be made into more of a classy experience by letting less people up at a time and allowing access to a bar.

You will only do it once."
,,Nice view of Singapore.,5.0,,Lovely view of singapore all around. Great place to see the development of singapore new downtown. Worth the price .
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"I thought this was overrated for the price. Costs SGD 23 to go to the top, but you only get access to less than 10% of the roof. Most of it is for hotel guests only. Views are good though."
,,excellent view,5.0,,"one of the best of view of Singapore , especially for the night time to be there , infinity pool is must see"
,,Wow!,5.0,,A view that you won't soon forget. The panorama of Singapore is laid out in front of you. Particularly spectacular at night which also gives you some relief from the ever-present Singapore heat.
,,Would only do it once.,4.0,,"Great views, goes without saying. A bit expensive but it is one of those things that you should do at least once. The staff said we could stay on the observation deck as long as we liked. However the area is stark and uninviting. It is a fairly large open deck at one end of the long structure. The tropical setting and trees that are clearly visible from below are for the hotel guests only. There is no weather protection and no where to sit and relax and enjoy the fabulous views. We did not stay there very long. Easy access from the metro station below the shopping Mall right next door."
,,Have to do it,5.0,,Yes it's $26 to get to the Observation Deck of the Marina Bay Sands but well worth it. The views are amazing and you an get to see it 360 degrees. You obviously don't have access to the Hotel pool section however you can actually get a glimpse around and through the gate. A must to experience when in Singapore.
,,Go there just before sunset,5.0,,Futuristic building and awesome view over Singapore from the roof top. The attraction might close in case of thunder and they don't refund the entrance fee. So check for the weather forecast before! I would recommend that you go there 30mn before sunset so that you can experience the sunset over Singapore: it's really awesome! A must-see!
,,Lovely anytime,5.0,,My favorite place. Can spend hours here. Best views of Singapore Has good restaurants too. Great place to spend an evening
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,My partner and I enjoyed a nice wander around the sky although the weather wasn't very ideal we were able to see more than we knew existed of Singapore. It offers a truly amazing view
,,Go for it,5.0,,One of the few attractions that Singapore has to offer ..... so go for it .... best to go at night ..... lights look good
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"On the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
The Skypark is free to hotel guests but I do not know if there is an admission charge for the public. The views, on a clear day, are impressive with vistas across to the city, gardens and the sea.
If the air quality is poor as it was the last time we stayed due to smoke pollution don't bother as you will not see a thing.
There is a rather tacky gift shop."
,,Quick visit!!!!,2.0,,"Not worth the money, yes the views are amazing from the top but you are restricted to one very small area at the top, there is no seating and people sit on the stairs as there is no where else, you can only buy takeaway soft drinks as the lovely bar area is reserved for hotel guests. It would have been a nice place to visit if you were able to sit and enjoy the view with a coffee or a wine for a while but that is not possible. Despite the cost to get up to the top with a family it seems they don't want you to stay too long so they can keep sending more people up. Staff take your photo at the bottom and by the time you reach the top it has been badly photoshopped onto a background and they try the hard sell to get you to buy!!!. It was a good opportunity to see the views but don't plan on being there for long, also because there is no where to sit people sit next to the glass edge and this also limits your options to take pictures and read the view facts. Marina Bay Sands Resort, spend some money and put some chairs out!!!!!"
,,"Good views of the skyline, no pool views or access",2.0,,"Good for a 10 min Picture taking venture. Not really worth the $26 or whatever it was. I wanted to have a look at the pool, but you can't see it unless you stay at the hotel."
,,Such a Beautiful View!,4.0,,"The view of the city, especially at night is breathtaking. The best view of the Marina is from across the river by the Fullerton Bay Hotel or the Merlion Park waterfront area."
,,The invisible woman,3.0,,"I went to the bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands for the sunset view and a cocktail. It was busy, of course, but trying to get a waiter's attention was a major strategic exercise. This wasn't because they were that busy. Another woman on her own and I exchanged notes - yep, older women without me are invisible here. Nice view, shame about the crap service. Oh yes, it costs 20 Singapore dollars to get into this bar. and, although this is taken off the cost of your drink, prices are so high you're still going to spend quite a bit, so polite service isn't too much to expect."
,,LenR,4.0,,"Fantastic views some 50 floors up from the Skypark of the city. They have now stopped people going to the pool area (infinity pool) its only for guests of the hotel. But still well worth the trip up to the top. Small shop with souvenirs and food available. Photography is great from this vantage point, also you can see part of the F1 race track."
,,Fantastic hotel,5.0,,Amazing views from 57th floor. Futuristic design. Very close to harbour and major attractions. A dream place to stay.
,,"Big, brash, impersonal guest processing production line",1.0,,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights.
I knew it was big and have been to plenty of large hotels. It was the first time that I had to wait in a managed queue line to check in to a 5 star hotel. In reality It is at best 3.5 stars.
It's owned and run by the holding company that owned similar monstrosities in Las Vagus. So I guess if that is what you are after this hotel is for you.

Our family room was comfortable for 4 of us but the room was beginning to show it's age and the musty smell beginning to creep in.

The building is an engineering masterpiece.
The only other positive was the roof top pool. To get to it we had to use 3 different lifts and every single person, including kids need their own room key to get in. Once there it was a scramble to get a bed. There was people everywhere!

I realised fairly early that I made a mistake in booking this hotel. My 3 night stay booking made directly with the hotel were deemed non changeable by the guest processing officer and I was told politely to sod off."
,,Panorama view,4.0,,Breathtaking view from the top! The infinity pool is so awesome! The view from the top is so therapeutic for me!!
,,Made a trip to the top for a view at night of the city,5.0,,Wel; worth the expense to see the lights of the city and to get photos. To have a meal and a drink is rather on the expensive side and not worth the high cost. Much better priced meals around the wharf area.
,,City views,5.0,,A great place to visit for breathtaking city and surrounding views. Not for anyone with a fear of heights. Well priced attraction with teaser views of the Marina Bay Sands swimming pool. Makes you want to be a guest.
,,Marina Observatory is on the top of Singapore,5.0,,This observatory is located at the top of Singapore... one can have a bird's eye view from this place... it is higher than the flyer...
,,An Architectural Masterpiece with Stunning Views!,5.0,,If you want to see Singapore from on high this is the place to go. The structure itself is amazing and the views are fabulous! We went just before sunset and watched the magic of the lights coming on. Well worth a visit!
,,Amazing Views at Night,5.0,,"We visited here as part of an organised tour, it was breathtaking and the views are amazing. I have just looked back at some of my photo's and it has given me Goosebumps revisiting such spectacular shots and views."
,,Coo!,5.0,,"We were lifted to the 56 stories to the top of this ""boat on 3 buildings"" more quickly that the lift in our hotel managed 6! Fabulous views - in my view probably better than the Singapore Flyer because you may stay for as long as you wish, and it's cheaper and higher! Big wheel gondolas are still fun,though!"
,,50-50,3.0,,"SO , If you have already been in tall skyscrapers , well this one is no different . Nice top view , on both sides. I presume that everyone wants to do it , but after you go up and see I dont think that worth . this is why my review is 50-50 . Some people will enjoy it . Some people ( like me ) will be neutral"
,,Stunning views!,4.0,,"Stunning views of Singapore atop this architectural wonder! Lining up for tickets was rather long however,particularly for the elderly or young children."
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"We had this recommended by a few people and were very excited to try it out. The views were nice, but not worth the cost. You spend maybe 5 minutes taking photos and there isn't anything else to do, unless you want to pay another 24 dollars each for drinks at the bar. Would recommend skipping this and checking out the view from another point in the city."
,,Great view,4.0,,Great views. Drinks like everywhere in Singapore are expensive. Food was very good. Definitely worth a visit
,,Waste of time for nothing special,2.0,,"You may get confused but you won't be able to visit the swimming pool and garden with this ticket. Those are only accessible for the hotel guests. Bottom line, nothing much to see unless you never saw skyscrapers before ..."
,,Pretty cool views,5.0,,I didn't stay in the actual hotel but my friend and I decided to go for the Skypark views anyway. It provided excellent views of the city and was really nice on top. Guests aren't really allowed access to much of the Skypark which i found pretty annoying for the price it takes to get up there. It's still a must do for Singapore though.
,,Amazing view of Singapore,5.0,,This place is very good to see all over the whole Singapore from the top of the MBS. You may have the good memories for your trip in Singapore.
,,"Overpriced, but great view!",4.0,,"It is what it is: very cool, super view, for more money than they ought to charge... I paid more $ for an ice cream sandwich (up top), than I've ever paid before!! 😀"
,,Nice view,4.0,,The view is good but not as fabulous as from Altitude 1 however it is well worth a visit. It is quite as small viewing area so not a place to linger.
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Great views from up top. It's a little pricey but worth doing it once. They take photos of you before you go to the top and once you get to the top they try and sell you them. They cost more than the trip up there. They closed off most of the top for people starting at the hotel so you don't get to see the pool or anything like that
,,an architectural marvel,5.0,,"This is something yo do once in your life time, we had to pay an entrance fee to the bar which included a drink. the music and crowd where very touristy, as to be expected but it was all worth it for the amazing view and to experience this marvel!"
,,Just to look,5.0,,We didn't go into the building but could see it from many points of Singapore this is a wonderful building just to look at.
,,Can't afford to miss this,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for only 2 hours or less - the only thing you want to see would be the MBS (Marina Bay Sands) Sky Park. Not because of an excellent sky park, but because the views from atop the towers is breath taking. You may even get a chance to see the infinite pool, but I guess the access to that is limited now only for guests. It was open to public when I visited MBS the very first time way back in 2010."
,,Skypark is just for the hotel guests,3.0,,"The view is amazing, but the place is very a Small, you will not see the skypark!! It's only for hotels guests!! You will pay just for the city view in very small area !!"
,,Epitome of luxury,5.0,,"43 floor , with sea view ..that was awesome .

Big rooms , automatic window curtains and once the window opened ,u see the magical gardens by the bay which is more beautiful in the night .

The hotel lives hoto its name and design , ultra fast lifts and awesome views .

The infinity pool is must see attraction and if possible dip in once and enjoy the city view from the pool which is located at 57 floor .

The Sky 57 restaurant has best food to treat your testbuds ,must try ."
,,Nothing outstanding,2.0,,The place clearly is Too busy and too expensive. Not recommended. Singapore has more exciting stuff to offer.
,,A wonderful view,5.0,,"The marina bay sands skypark was one of our best visited attractions in Singapore. I have visited this site with my family. From this very high towers, you can see the beautiful city, lights and buildings. It recommended to visit this location just before the sunset. So that you can see the city before and after the darkness."
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,It was too hot when we went there so we ddn't stay for long and we had already seen the city view from the Infinity Pool. Best to go in early morning or evening.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We were staying at Marina Bay Sands and had free entry to the Skypark which has spectacular views in all directions over Singapore. The Skypark does not allow you access to the POOL unless you are a guest.
,,Awesome Place !!,4.0,,Classic place... Great fun to watch - This is the true Singapora !! Go and watch out this beautiful place !!
,,A must do,5.0,,There is 3 options to see the skyline Marina bay sans is one of it. $25 Singapore dollars or buy it in the airport in the travel place and enjoy a discount of S$5 . Illimité Time at the top 56 floors . A fantastic view it is worth to pay the money.
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,"Our last night in Singapore and we thought why not visit the sky park thinking just another lookout, but Wow! What a gem, if you leave Singapore without going up here then you have missed out on a great night out. Great views, plenty of room. Time your visit with the laser show and garden in the bay light show. A great way to see Singapore in its full glory."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Very busy pool
Probably the busiest in the world!
Very social
People from everywhere in this very big pool
However it's controlled well
It has Number of restaurants and cafes
I think it's one of world best places for taking pictures!
I strongly recommend the visit"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Magnificent views, service and pool. Staying in this hotel is an experience. Worth every cent! Great location too!"
,,View amazing but not much else for non-residents so overpriced,3.0,,"The best views you can get in S'pore - however when you buy a steeply priced ticket for just an elevator and a tiny section of the skypark you at least expect to be able to enjoy a drink (or two) on the terrace. But no, residents only. What a disappointment!"
,,views from the top are worth the price,5.0,,really spectacular. 360 degree views of Singapore. Don't miss it just the WOW factor alone. Even on a cloudy day it gives you a view of Singapore that is impossible to beat.
,,The best view of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the one place every tourist must visit. You have not seen Singapore until you view it from this vantage point. It's a very high end, sophisticated place and the shops are uber expensive but those who can afford it get a chance to spoil themselves. I will book here for my next visit to Singapore."
,,Eye In The Sky,4.0,,I took my sister in law & her family from Kuala Lumpur to visit the Sky Park via the KDT pub. The night view of the city skyline & Marina Bay is breathtaking & unforgettable. Now it is restricted to only Marina Bay Sands residents.
,,Must Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"The views are breathtaking and I strongly suggest not missing this one! Be careful about the ticketing, I bought through voyagin and had to collect the physical tickets at chinatown which is a $10 cab ride from Marina bay. Suggest you buy tickets at the venue or their official website or make sure your online travel agent delivers these physical tickets!"
,,fantastic!!!,5.0,,"what an amazing view go up before sunset starts then stay til evening the view and lights were fantastic,dont missed this opportunity when you in singapore."
,,High above the thinking,5.0,,"I was simply amazed with beauty, it is awesome and mind blowing. The whole country was seen from a single point. The sea, the city, the port and what not. Feeling lucky."
,,The view from thew skypark is amazing,4.0,,"This was a must see the only dissapointment was that we got there at 9.30pm it closes at 10pm, we still had to pay the full price of $23 and then a storm rolled in. So we were there for less than 15mins."
,,Spectacular experience...,5.0,,"The Skypark on the roof provides an amazing view of Singapore skyline. And also Garden by the Bay.. as 57th floor is restricted for travellers other than the guests of the Hotel,
We just went for the Skypark. Great view and well worth a visit if you like to click on what you see :)"
,,Great view,4.0,,"Great hotel in marina bay. Can be expensive and has vast views over the bay. Drinks and food is expensive here, prefer the lantern bar at the Fullerton. Where you can see the light show."
,,Over priced,5.0,,"Ok & cool to see the infinity pool backdropped by the rest of Singapore, but over priced. Recommend going up 1-Altitude & getting the view back instead."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"It's a beautiful view at night time but unfortunately there is no where to sit and enjoy your time up there. You can't see the light show from the observation deck.
It's extremely expensive for what it is, for that much you should be getting something free with it."
,,"Next to the Lion citysymbol and the Raffles, the Marina Bay",5.0,,"from 1975 we where twice a year in Singapore for business and shopping. this building is the new citysymbol_the hotels are *****_the servicelevel is elegant and top_it is really an experience swimming in the pool_we have swimmed a few times in very foggy suroundings, because of the rainy saison"
,,Incredibly view but pricey!,5.0,,"The sky Park has amazing views over Singapore from the inifinity pool but don't forget to look behind you! The view is just as incredible.
Drinks and snacks are a bit pricey too, $40SGD for toasted cheese sandwich with chips and a pink colada. Delicious but not cheap.
The pool does get busy but it also gets quiet. We visited on a weekend and had no issues getting a sun bed by the pool. There is still plenty of room to swim and take the souvenir photos even when it is busy. The adults area is fantastic too!"
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,The Skypark on the roof of the Marina Sands Hotel provides amazing views of the whole of the Singapore skyline but especially of the Bay of Gardens complex. Best to buy combined tickets for the Skypark and infinity pool which allows access to the whole area. We just went for the Skypark without realising that access was restricted. Great views and well worth a visit.
,,A must visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore you must visit as you will not get views like it anywhere else even on the flyer, it seems really classy at the bar and the infinity pool is a great experience."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Definitely worth the look this is one place you have to visit in Singapore without fail. The view from the top is outstanding day & night
,,Great view,4.0,,"It's well worth a trip to this skypark to take a look at the view over Singapore and the bay. It's certainly full of selfie sticks! I was disappointed that they don't have anywhere such as a bar or café for visitors to relax and enjoy the view. The only place we saw was serving slushy drinks or ice-creams, but no sit down area.
We found out later that we could have gone to the bar from the hotel section without paying the entry fee to the lookout deck. Probably would have cost us the same.
But, am glad we went there, even to view to amazing architecture of the building."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"We went for a special occasion and went to the cheese, chocolate and wine buffet. Was absolutely beautiful and a great way to spend an evening. Not cheap, but it was very special. Lovely to sit by the pool as well."
,,Best views in Singapore!!!!,5.0,,"This has to be one of the best things about Singapore itself. Being able to swim around and see the city from this point is astonishing.... we stayed here for a few days and there was always plenty of people, staff were the best anywhere with impeccable service!!!!!! There are restaurants and poolside eating available"
,,Wondeful paoramic views of Singapore,5.0,,"Not expensive as expected. Not crowded as expected. Signs point out places of interst in view. Only half the floor accessable, the othert with a swimming pool belons to the hotel. Bar available (closed on this occasion)."
,,Great view from the top,4.0,,This place is probably expensive but it's worth if your going to take your time at the top with a few drinks and swim. Staff a real friendly and polite.
,,Watch day turn to night,5.0,,"The skypark is the prime spot for absorbing the spectacular man-made views that span the Singapore skyline.
Whilst access is not cheap, it is also not expensive and not time-limited. It is possible to spend hours atop the 'Marina Bay Sands' and it serves as a great vantage point for the sunset, cocktail in one hand and camera in the other."
,,Expensive entrance tickets and photo souvenir,3.0,,Marina Bay Sands' Sky Plaza provides a good view but not all of Singapore. There are no seats where visitors can rest.
,,nice views of singapore!!,4.0,,"nice views of singapore skyline on west, singapore flyer on north with gardens by the bay on east , on background of tens of ships floating in the sea Great views, especially after sunset Overpriced tickets and photo album"
,,Just for the view,4.0,,"We have been there for the view and we were not disappointed. However you need to pay for it. All restaurants are expensive and the food is okish.

This hotel is an airport you walk long distances so I would recommend a visit only to the roof top if you jave young children."
,,A Fantastic View,5.0,,"At the top of the Marina Sands Hotel it offer fantastic views of Singapore, icluding the Gardens on the Bay and Marina Bay. Even better after dark.Quite expensive."
,,Amazing infinity pool overlooking the Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"Decided to stay at the Marina Bay Sands to get access to the infinity pool up on Skypark. The pool area is only available to hotel guests and is strictly enforced. Went up mid morning and water was a tad cold, but the view. The view is amazing!"
,,Fantastuc views,4.0,,My husband loved it . It cost €23 to get to top. If its misty not worth the money. I dIdn't go up so there are a few shops and coffee shop but gets really busy . Not enough seats to wait around for hubby. There a bar and infinty pool at thevtop . Guest in hotel have access to use them .
,,Overpriced view in the terrace.,3.0,,I visited in December of 2016. The view is good but overcrowded and you are always watching the people in the pool in front. The prices of the drinks are way overpriced for what is offered. Unless you are staying in the hotel I would definitely recommend the Suisse hotel view. Much better value.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Went up here while staying at the MBS. Swimming at the Infinity Pool was an incredible experience early in the morning while the whole place was still peaceful. Watching the city waking up in the morning from 57th floor up was amazing. The spectacular view of the city skyline and soaking in the warm water made it a memorable moment.
,,Interesting,3.0,,What a fabulose piece of art to view. To watch the construction would have been awesome. The building stands strong and definitely takes the position. Take the hop on hop off buss first to see the city then go back to places you want to visit more.
,,Must must visit for all,5.0,,56/57 floor.... Just superb view of the city. Plan it in the eve... You can exoerinece the lights... Garden by the way view from the top is just fantastic. Laser show is unforgettable.
,,Wow - a must see!,5.0,,"What an amazing place to see on any visit to Singapore. Make your way to the furthest left tower of the three and pay to go up. Make sure you get tickets for skypark & not the bar on floor above. Expensive, but worth it for the view!"
,,Infinity Pool!,5.0,,"Amazing infinity pool - can see why there's such a hype around it. We lived in the hotel so access was free to us and I spent every morning up there watching the sunrise from the pool or hot tubs and a few evenings in the bar, where the music was really good (as were the drinks/ nibbles). Stunning views both nighttime and daytime."
,,It has to be done!,3.0,,"Living in Singapore for a short time we had to do this. The views are stunning. However it is a real tourist trap. The drinks are expensive and mediocre, its packed and not really a place for a relaxing drink. But we've done it now so tick."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The infrastructure, the architecture is excellent. It's a must visit, the view from the top is breathtaking. The whole skyline is visible from the top. There are many restaurants and pubs in the property. It's a must visit."
,,A suitable place to enjoy night Singapore,4.0,,"A suitable place to enjoy night Singapore from above. In case you a keen photographer you might want to bring a tripot with you in order to make great pics of skyscrapers’ lights and the laser show over the water of Marina Bay. Make sure you get there either by 19:45 or by 20:45 so that you can watch the light show of Gardens by the Bay situated just next to Marina Bay Sands hotel.
The security was really impolite - when they saw us taking night pictures with a tripod they said it's not allowed to use it because it would damage the floor!?!?!?! Maybe they were just instructed not to allow people to make pics with tripod as they might be used for commercial purpose (which was not true in our case) but anyway, the explanation as to why we should not use the tripod was very stupid!
In general - it's worth the visit!
We visited the place with iVenture pass so admission was free for us."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,2.0,,"Although this is a famous Singapore tourist attraction, personally I find there is nothing much to cheer about."
,,Limited unless you stay at hotel.,3.0,,The view is amazing but you're stuck on one end of the Skypark; just the observation deck. If you stay at the hotel you have access to the other 95%. $23 is a little steep for an elevator ride and a good view.
,,"Drop-dead gorgeous views, and great food and service!",5.0,,"This Skypark straddles the three towers that comprise the fabulous Marina Bay Sands hotel complex. It is accessed from Tower ! (closest to the airport), costs $20.00 per adult (redeemable at the bar or any restaurant), and is located on the 57th. floor. We ate at the the ""Ce La Vie"" which offered a three-course lunch for $38.00 (angel hair pasta, glazed chicken and rice, petit fours). A large glass of draught Amstel beer cost $10.00 each. We were in no way hurried, the views were breathtaking, the staff friendly and efficient, and it made for an utterly memorable experience of this amazing city."
,,Pricey 15mins,4.0,,"Level 56 in 5 seconds, THE best views of Singapore, VERY hot up there, only stayed up there say 15-20mins to take my pics, little to no shade, hubby didn't come up a) ticket price b) he works on high rises."
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,"Amazing views over Singapore and a real experience. Not cheap, especially if you are a family and could do with some seating so you can sit and have a drink."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"Encompassing view of significant places that needs to be visited i.e. Gardens by the Bay, Merlion, Marina Bay harbour side and others..."
,,Great views,5.0,,"This is a very unusual building - from outside and inside. A visit to the flying boat on the top is essential. There is a lift that takes you almost to the top - then switch to another lift for the final 2 floors. To see the views you can have a ""cheap"" drink or simply sneak a peak."
,,Expensive but cool,3.0,,The view was undeniably beautiful but it's very expensive $24 I believe and there isn't much to do while up there. There isn't any shade so take a hat and water. It's nice to see the view and take a few photos but it probably isn't worth the expense in my opinion.
,,Amazing !!,5.0,,"One of the best spot to see Singapore city from the sky. Easy to access, although is pretty expensive ticket."
,,Holidays,5.0,,Nice tour Spent a good time there Nice view of all buildings nearby Worth it..will surely recommend to others
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"This is simply he best place from which to view Singapore. It's there only spot which will give you an idea of the size and density if Singapore, as well as its proximity to Malaysia and Indonesia. Absolutely ideal for a first time visit to Singapore."
,,Nice but can get crowded,4.0,,"The Skypark is located on the 56th and 57th levels of the MBS. You can get a lovely panoramic view of the city skyline, Gardens By the Bay and the harbour. There is also a beautiful Infinity Pool there but it can get very crowded. Only hotel guests are allowed to use the pool and entrance and exit to the Skypark is tightly controlled and everyone needs a keycard to tap in and out."
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,Enjoy some great view of the city from the 57th floor. U can either go to the observatory deck or visit the flight lounge. the flight lounge has only 2-3 vegetarian options. Fantastic view. Its a must do and looks magical at night.
,,Something to see,4.0,,Although its something to see and would recommend stopping by don't waste your money and go to the roof top. It's $20.00 per person and not worth the cost. Just walk the lobby and look at it from the ground
,,Singapore Skyline..,5.0,,"Went to the top at night and wow, what an experience. Watch the breathtaking Skyline of Singapore and the beauty of the city. Amazing...."
,,A Definate MUST-Do!,5.0,,Singapore definitely has its charm. There's so much to see from Old and quaint to ultra modern and shiny. But nothing compares to the view of Singapore from the Marina Bay Sands sky Park. Singapore really shines from the sky Park. If nothing else it will entice you to become a guest at the Marina Bay Sands just to enjoy the infinity pool! On my bucket list now!!!
,,go to the rooftop bar!!! amazing views at sunset,5.0,,"Go at sunset - make sure to plan for 15-20 minutes of queuing to get up there. They charge you $20 but that can be applied to drinks at the bar (which doesn't cover a vodka soda! $24 with tax and tip)
killer views at sunset. some people dressed up and others casual"
,,Best pool EVER,5.0,,We took the elevator up to top floor. The pool is number one in my book. Dance and party in the disco. So fun. Some rock back was playing down in the marina below and you could hear them and see the light show from way up there. Not to be missed
,,Nice views from the top,4.0,,"You typical fancy hotel with high end shops and expensive food. Up on the rooftop there are really nice views but if it's sunny prepare for it to be hot.
They have a bar up top and gifts you can buy. Good place to get some nice pictures from around the city."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Amazing Views, 2 options: buy ticket or order something in the bar. Best during sunset as the buildings turn on the lights and the landscape changes significantly. It really worths, highly recommended!!!."
,,Amazing site,5.0,,"This is a must do visit , it has a hotel and if you take the lift to the 50 something floor you can access the rooftop boat bar, views are amazing and food available either outside or in the Resturant. It looked good we just had a drink. Pick your time as busy. Take your camera and enjoy the view with a drink or meal. Can access it from shopping centre ."
,,Fantastic for a look,4.0,,The ce la vi bar is great can have a cocktail and view the famous pool. dont bother paying for observatory deck you can access it from the bar. The watch shops were amazing good to look how the other half live
,,Has become expensive and touristy,1.0,,"Better looking at than looking from. Expensive drinks, poor service, and all the worst of over the top BS attractions, just because it is MBS - stay away. Go to somewhere on the other side of the water and enjoy much better service and you can sip your drink (at half the price) knowing that you avoided what seems to have become a tourist scam."
,,Stunning Design,5.0,,"The sky park is situated on the 100th floor, and the view from atop is amazing. There is also a pool above the floor which is an infinity pool and its a must place to visit. The views are stunning. I preferred it at night when everything is lit and comes alive."
,,Beatuful View of the Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"This is a must see place in singapore as it gives you the limitless view of Singapore & it has to be done at night. The view on one side is the High Rises, Singapore River & on other side Port, Gardens by the Bay, SingaporeFlyer"
,,impressive building,3.0,,Looks impressive but for me that's where it ends cant understand why you want to stay in this building but each to there own
,,Great views,3.0,,I think it is a bit over priced. You are paying for the views but you you are limited as to where you can go.
,,Fantastic view and a must do,5.0,,Incredibly good views of Singapore and the bays. Wow so many ships out there moored. The Gardens at the Bay views were also great. Of course the Infinity Pool was like no other in the world - all fantastic on level 37 and 36 of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,"Quick access at the side entrance to the Hotel, they give seniors discount SGD$19.00 per adult, exceptional view around Singapore, 56 floors up in no time, cold drinks and ice creams available at the top. Worth a look."
,,Great pictures to be taken!,5.0,,The view is spectacular. If you are planning on taking photos visit on a day with a bit of blue sky..
,,Awesome Engineer Example Providing Great Views,5.0,,"Visited during the day on our own and then again during a night tour and were well impressed with the observatory views at both times. We would recommend putting this on your list of things to do while in Singapore. The ticket for admission is a bit pricey but on a clear day you'll get some great pictures of Gardens by the Bay, the skyline, the Singapore Flyer and the Marina area. Unfortunate that you can't access the hotel restaurant while up there but can still grab a drink from the counter."
,,Top of the world in Town,5.0,,"A pinnacle observatory spot overlooking the beautiful harbour in central business district. Must see for first visit to Singapore !

The hotel swimming pool located next to it lends a one of a life time experience with fantastic view & people watching fun. Water is a little cold though at that height.."
,,The best view of Singapore Day or Night,5.0,,We made our way up to the 57th floor to the rooftop bar for a late night drink and our first view of Singapore having arrived from London only a few hours earlier.. Do take time to go up for the best view of Singapore both day and night. A magical place.
,,View the entire city of Singapore from the highest swimming pool of the world,5.0,,No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. This is one of the best spot for a view of the entire city. Unfortunately the swimming pool and the dining room are accessible only to patrons of the hotel.
,,Did not meet expectations,2.0,,Expensive for the experience it offers. Half the deck is shut so only one side view but one can have better views from other skyscrapers in the city.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed it .it was awesome and fun . beautiful view from top . lighting was awsome breathtaking view.but it took a while to find it .all the signs were not clear. We ran here and there .ask direction from front desk they will guide properly
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"The price may be steep, but the view is worth it. Marvel at the city of the future from 60 stories, the angles from all sides provide very different and breathtaking photos."
,,Worth the money,5.0,,I found a bit expensive until a got to the top - awesome view of the Bay. The best is going up at the end of afternoon and stay for the night.
,,Fantastic.,5.0,,Awesome views if you can handle being on the 56th floor that sways slightly. I'm a coward but braved it. Glad I did. Souvenir photos expensive.
,,Great view but overrated restaurant.,4.0,,"We went for lunch at Cevali on the 57 floor Of the sky park.
Food was ok, but not what I would expect for such a marquee restaurant. I know restaurants such as this, are expensive, but I thought it would be better.
If it wasn't for the view I would be disappointed."
,,Nice place!,5.0,,I feel very relaxing in this place. I can see the whole beautiful view. This place aslo connect to MRT system so it's convenience for tourists.
,,Impressive Architecture Inside And Out,4.0,,"This casino, hotel and convention center complex fronts Marina Bay in Singapore and comprises three buildings linked buy the worlds largest cantilevered platform. Inside the building is impressive with a number of restaurants and shops and the hotel and casino entrance. Make a visit to see the architecture and the surrounding gardens which are impressive and if you can visit to top with its large infinity pool."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Just an amazing Skypark at this hotel. We spent almost 2 whole days there just relaxing and looking at the views for both sides and eating their good fries. The pool is only available for hotel guest, which is really nice if you are one."
,,Three day visit to Singapore,5.0,,We have visited Skypark at the night time. It is really nice place to visit with a great view of the bay and city. Staff were friendly and it is very easy to get to if by MRT.
,,The kids just loved it!!,5.0,,"I wasnt sure about spending the money here but we couldnt resist it. It was so beautiful seeing everything from high and we couldnt made the kids to leave they were so excited (6,9,11). At the time we were there it wasnt crowded and the weather was clear. We thought it worth the visit."
,,What a view.,5.0,,"Were able to go to the observation deck for a price of $20, I think. Hotel guests could go to the restaurant and the infinity pool. The view is spectacular. Full view of all the city. Enjoyed it very much."
,,Definitely worth getting up there!,4.0,,"We were on our honeymoon so getting on top of the Marina Bay was something that looked worth doing and it was. It is expensive but it's one of those things you will try once or twice. We didn't book a place for the bar but we just went on top to check out the view from the rooftop. There were a lot of people but it wasn't super packed that you couldn't enjoy the view. Beautiful view of the city.

We visited during our honeymoon in Jan 2015 but cannot change the year."
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,For the admission and minimum drinks you can't beat the views of Singapore from there. Go there after work after a quick bite and watch the sunset. Or get in there early and save. The views are just unbearable.
,,"interesting, unusual, majestic and with many attractions and points of interest.",5.0,,"interesting, unusual, majestic and with many attractions and points of interest. the tri-building itself is a wonder - the three towers are joined atop with a restaurant & lounge, offering magnificent and panoramic views of singapore and the bay. property encompasses museums, casino, hotel, offices and full shopping mall. tour the grounds and ride the elevator - a unique property."
,,Feel on top of the world,5.0,,"Just $20 per person buys a ticket to the top of this magnificent hotel. The $20 is deducted from your drinks order - the drinks are a little expensive but the view far outweighs that. Or for $23 you can just go to the observation deck.
We opted for the $20 option and enjoyed a nice glass of wine (2) and a cheese platter watching the sunset and the lights coming on in the Gardens by the Bay"
,,Worth the S$23 per person,5.0,,"Singapore is expensive! However we did not regret watching the sun set whilst on top of the iconic Marina Bay Sands. We did not order drinks, but I had a look at the menu and it seemed reasonably priced, considering they have a monopoly of the people at the top."
,,Good location too expensive with limitations,3.0,,Beutiful city and bay view but too expensive considering that you can access only few square meters od the terrace
,,Great View...Worth The Price?,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands offers a great view of the Singapore skyline and the harbour. But it costs SGD23 per person to go up there and you really won't spend very long. We were there for less than an hour and I'm still not sure it was worth the price. Still, I did enjoy the view."
,,It's all about the view,5.0,,Really worth a visit even though the drinks are super expensive. You pay $20 and redeem that for a drink which are about $20-$25. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was reasonably quiet but the view is worth the effort. Next time I will definitely go in the evening to see the lights of Singapore.
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,I'm scared of heights & a thoughtful staff member showed me how to balance the feeling by holding one hand on the glass-it worked! Views were nothing short of amazing
,,Whoow,5.0,,Just a amazing view from the skypark at the 56th floor acros the skyline of Singapore. It is a must do/see atraction when your visiting Singapore!!!
,,Didn't see what others obviously do!,3.0,,"I had great exceptions given the good reviews but I was a bit disappointed. Maybe I had set my exceptions too high but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Yes, its an amazing building looking from the outside, but inside - you could be anywhere. Nice pool but not exception in my opinion for a roof top venue."
,,Great view,4.0,,From Skypark you have great views over the city and port area. Also the Gardens by the Bay can be seen very well from here. Very nice when it's not raining!
,,"Great view, impeccable service",4.0,,"...but also very expensive. We went here for drinks and enjoyed the view and atmosphere very much. Drinks were >20$, cheapest beer by bottle 16$."
,,Must do,5.0,,"The Skypark is a must do when in Singapore. Either during the day or at night, up to you. Both options certainly do have their charme. I went during the day and the view is just amazing, including the waterfront, museum, part of the F1 circuit, Gardens by the Bay etc."
,,Another big building,3.0,,"This is an amazing piece of architecture but after that, it gives a great view of Singapore at a price. Suggest you go to the bar which costs $20 redeemable when you have a drink but doesn't give you access to the Sky Walk - hotel guests only."
,,"Nice viewing platform, pool for hotel guests only",4.0,,"To overlook the Singapore area there are only few comparable places (there are, though, like 1 Altitude), the view is great and far reaching. Drawbacks are the rather high price (SD 20.-) to just have a view and the fact that there is no access to the rooftop bar Ce La Vi. We're talking about the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck here.
Ce La Vi is half a floor higher, accessible through the same elevators and offers almost the same view, a good variety of drinks and food, some chilled music, and is mostly full. Service staff are doing their best to serve everyone swiftly, which is not always possible. From the rear part of the bar there is an open view towards the Skypark Infinity Pool: Nice, but for hotel guests only.
For a nice sunset, both observation deck and Ce La Vi bar are good spots, just be there early enough, might get a bit crowded on a clear evening..."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"The view there is breat taking, the prices for the liquor will pull you oants down. This was the most expensive berr i ever had. 25 dolars is quite a lot but tge view was worth it. After 22 they have a dress code, so no shorts there"
,,Best ever views,5.0,,"Included this in my planning from the U.K. All booked & paid on line just had to collect ticket to go in with.
So easy and staff very pleasant.
It is a shame there are no seating facilities out there as I for one would sit a bit longer. But never spoilt it for me far too much else to see & do. Overall a must do experiment"
,,What a veiw,5.0,,"Try to go on the clearest day possible,(sometimes hazy in Singapore).Magnificent veiwing platform and then sit by the pool and have a Singapore ""Sling"""
,,Nice Views,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands SkyPark gives amazing views of Singapore. You have views of the Singapore Strait, Gardens by the Bay and also Downtown Singapore. The best time to visit is around sunset, but be there earlier, to get a good view of sunset because it can fill up quickly."
,,Beautiful Gardens,3.0,,The parc is Nice to see and does have beautiful plants and trees. Take a look At the bridge between the trees
,,"View is splendid, but fee too highh",3.0,,"You get a spectacular view from here and it is truly an iconic site in Singapore, but the fee is too high and options to relax/eat drink too limited."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,This place is worth a stay even just for one night and you need to be a guest to use the infinity pool which is amazing!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Gives you a great over vieuw of the city and how clever the planning of Singapore is. I recommend you do this at the beginning of your trip to familiarize with the surroundings.
,,Must See,5.0,,Outstanding architecture - you see it for miles - expensive tourist attraction - we wouldn't bother paying for the observation level just go to the bar - same view - think they might make you order drinks on the ground floor to lock you in to paying? We had booked at CeLaVie- thought that should have included the observation floor as there is a minimum spend of $80/person to eat there but it didn't - definite tourist prices as it should be
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,Well worth the visit to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Disappointed that only the left hand section was open and we couldn't view the infinity pool. Next time I will visit the skypark by day.
,,Boat on top,3.0,,"When my first time visit Singapore on 2012, this building still under construction, but my second visited that's amazing building. Love the design"
,,Infinity Pool,4.0,,"To be honest I stayed in this hotel because of the infinity pool. The bedroom itself it's not really grand considering you pay more than S$ 400 per night. Normally with that kind of price you get a bathroom with a bathtub. But the bathroom here is only have a shower and toilet. Unless maybe you pay more. The good thing is I get a high level floor so my room have Garden by the Bay view which is very beautiful at night. It's a nice hotel but in terms of value for money, it's not really worth it."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"Went there for dinner and drinks at Spago Lounge and take the opportunity to visit the skpark. Maybe it was night time and dark, the only thing that was nice was the view towards Gardens by the bay. Won't spend so much just for this view if not for the dinner. Once is good enough. Maybe should come during the day to see clearer."
,,Singapore,5.0,,I remain very impressed when see mbs because all visiting items like singapore flyer lion mbs are very close and froends must visit
,,Book a night for the Infinity Pool,4.0,,"It was a special occasion and my friend wanted to visit the Infinity pool which is only open to hotel guests, so we booked a room for the night. Not best impressed with the room, but check-in service was good. Views from the pool and the jacuzzis were fabulous. Drinks and food service on the pool deck was really good."
,,Great view,5.0,,Great view ang worth to visit. You should go to the 53.floor to go to terrasse or bar and there has a great view to surroundings. Especially good to go with good weather.
,,Stunning views,4.0,,Although this is quite pricey I think it is worth it for the incredible views. We sat as a family for about an hour enjoying a cold drink and soaking up the sights.
,,A for AMAZING!,5.0,,What a view! Great for a chilled out afternoon or night. We went up there and had a few drinks and enjoyed the whole city view. A must do!
,,"Good views, not much else",3.0,,"Lovely views, but extremely hot, we were lucky to have stayed up there about 15 minutes. No shade or anywhere to sit to enjoy the view."
,,Great views of surrounding area,4.0,,Went at night time had lovely views of surrounding areas. Would like to go back in the day time to see views from different perspective.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is the best place to be for a 360' view of the Singapore city. We went to Skypark in the afternoon and even though it was bit hot since the sun was out we enjoyed the view of the city and took so many pics. I'm pretty sure that I want to visit this place again on my next visit to Singapore and planing to go in the evening when it is dark and the city lights are on. I feel that the view of lights would be fabulous. So waiting to get that experience on my next visit.
,,Nice view from 56th Floor,4.0,,"Even if you are not staying in this hotel, you can buy ticket and can visit top of the building i.e. on 56th floor from where port, Singapore Flyer, Garden by the Bay. Marina Bay Singapore River, etc etc.. can be viewed from top."
,,Best at night,4.0,,"Visited at night, beautiful building when lit up. Had dinner there and watched the light show. Inside the building is quite spectacular and a trip up to the top with the view at night is not to be missed. Take your passport with you if you plan to visit the casino and you will not have to pay the $100 entrance fee."
,,Unobstructed view,4.0,,I went with my wife and mother-law. Since we are seniors we enjoyed a slight discount. We took a fast lift up and gotten a bird's eye view of Singapore. It is a pity that the part gousing the hotel is not included. If not it will even be better. You are advised to bring along your own drinks as the drinks are over-priced.
,,Excellent views of the city,5.0,,Paid the $20 entry fee to go to the Club Lounge on the 57th floor. The $20 is used as partial payment for a drink...somewhat expensive but worth it for the views.
,,Amazing views brilliant infinity pool,3.0,,"As we were here for a convention, we invariably ended up in the bar on the rooftop for a night cap. Thank God it was all on expense account as the prices are horrendous. But a great place to hang out. During the day the pool is fab, the meals are rubbish - don't eat poolside if you can avoid it. Fries are dry and tasteless, sandwiches no better even the burger had virtually no seasoning."
,,Great View!,4.0,,"Sands skypark offers a great view of the city especially at night. We went there around afternoon and stayed until 7PM. No seats, however you may seat on the floor if you're tired. Photos offered by Sands skypark is very expensive."
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,Do not miss to see this place. We did not book the tickets in advance as the guys at ticket counter said the weather is unpredictable. Excellent view of singapore. Its not very expensive as well.
,,The view,5.0,,The view was breath taking and you get to see both Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the bay. Just an easy access by the Bayfront station and nice to roam around taking pictures.
,,What a view!,4.0,,"For me, another must go in Singapore with you're not traveling with kids.
Perfect place for couples and friends.

Once you're up there, you can take a 360 view of the City and it's beautiful.

There's food and drinks at the bar and you could easily spend a whole afternoon just drinking, eating and appreciating the view."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"A most unique looking building and hotel. Underneath the hotel, there was a large multilevel shopping center... way cool. Worth the look and at night, out on the waterfront, there is a light show on the water which was Incredible."
,,unbelievable,5.0,,This place is unique. The building in itself is a work of enginuity. the views from the top are amazing. The sky bar entrance ticket includes the first drink. The prices are slightly expensive but not unexpected. It is worth the visit for the view
,,Great architecture with nature,5.0,,"Must visit place for concrete & nature lover , full sky line of Singapore city , amazing experience !"
,,Rain,4.0,,"It was a great view despite the downpour. I hung out long enough for the rain to stop a bit and managed to get the pano shot I wanted. As expected, drinks are a bit expensive but the Skypark is free so,to me, it evens out. 3rd tower. 57th floor. The bar is off the elevator and to your right. Only guests can go in the magical infinity pool....despite that, to me, it's worth it."
,,An interesting way to see Singapore.,5.0,,We chose to visit the Skypark early evening but didn't stay to see full sunset over Singapore. You get a good view of the light show at night so if I went again I would go later for sunset & the light show.
,,360 degree view,5.0,,The best place to enjoy the spectacular 360 degree view of the city . Must visit at night .. You cant access the Pool ofcourse but the experience is amazing ..
,,"A must see, great views",4.0,,"Colleague recommended I visit at night. Glad I did. Was nice to see singapore from the top floor at night. Grab a drink from the bar, and then enjoy the views."
,,Nice View,4.0,,"There are two kinds of tickets- one for the restaurants and the other for the sky deck. The sky deck one is a fair deal. The view is phenomenal. I visited it at around 8:30 in the evening. Singapore looks enchanting in the lights. Do not visit it in the daytime. Moreover, the light show is near to this attraction and starts at 9:00/9:15 PM. So, set your visit accordingly. All attractions in Singapore are near to MRT Stations, so there is no point wasting money on Taxis, unless otherwise you are made in cash. Once you reach the deck, you cannot stop admiring about the beauty of this little island. One must surely visit it."
,,Excellent view of the city from the top of the hotel,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore, make sure you take the time to come to the top of this hotel. The view of the city from the top is breathtaking. The best thing to do is to go to the bar and order a couple of drinks; no need to make reservations if you do this. We had such a good time there, that we decided to make reservations for dinner another night. The restaurant is very good, although perhaps a bit pricey, but you are not just enjoying the food and drinks but the view as well. Definitely worth the visit."
,,Night visit,5.0,,"wow is all I can say! worth visiting at night, very safe. make sure to get your tix to gardens by 8pm."
,,Amazing view of this remarkable city,5.0,,"Though it was complicated to find and expensive to go to, once we got to the top and saw the view it was worth it. We were able to get wheel chairs but our friends had to push us. Got tired out after so much walking. We found out that it was free if you ate up there in the (expensive) restaurant with the great view of the city and the Infinity Pool."
,,best view in singapore,5.0,,"if you want a view of singapore, visit celavi at the marina bay sands on the 57th floor. drinks are expensive but it is worth the experience."
,,Speechless,5.0,,"Amazing view of the city !!! Just a great experience, we went twice and had a dink there Better to call before you go to check if you need to pay a fee, (Friday and Sat for sure )"
,,Something to remember,4.0,,The view from here is amazing. This was one of the a highlights of my trip. I would recommend this to any one.
,,skyline view of Singapore,5.0,,The skypark gives you the aerial view of singapore which looks amazing at night when everything is lit. you can also see gardens by the bay domes and supertrees from above. We were lucky to see the lightshow from above. The place has a different vibe all together. Though it was expensive but worth.
,,Beautiful View of Singapore,5.0,,"To enjoy the view at the top,first we must buy S$20 ticket from the hotel. With the ticket, we can enjoy the view in observation deck (just in observation deck not in the infinity pool) because the infinity pool can only be enjoyed by hotel guests only. So we must stay in marina bay sands hotel if we will enjoy the infinity pool.
But in observation deck we can see spectacular view of singapore..so beautiful."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Better than the Flyer, much higher and better views. Tacky shop at the top but ignore that and concentrate on the view. Lift to the top is fast and quiet, you don't realise you are moving."
,,Nice view,4.0,,I went there on 2nd of March 2013 and the weather was beautiful. I think this is a must to visit and you won't regret it
,,Superb Night View,4.0,,Came up here at night and the view is absolutely stunning. There's 2 sides with one facing the Gardens by the Bay and the other the city and Raffles Place area. Most of the people in the infinity pool are not Swimming. Most are just here to enjoy the view and take selfies.
,,Spectacular View of Singapore ! A Must To See,5.0,,"Went for a drink on a sunday night , didnt regret it , the view was one of the best skyline views i have ever seen. Drink prices are what you would expect from a place like this, but the view and atmosphere makes up for it ."
,,A Drink on top of The World.,5.0,,There are two ways to get to the top of this building. One is buy a S$20 ticket from the hotel . travel by lift and walk around the top. This is a bit expensive. The alternative is to get a S $20 ticket form the CE LA VI desk in the hotel foyer and be given a voucher to spend at the top. Get the lift up and alight in a bar/restaurant where you can spend the voucher and see the same scenery. Therefore you can have S $ 20 of food or drink
,,Best views of the city...and a lot of Singapore,5.0,,Take a hat and enjoy a cold Singapore Sling as you look down upon the city. If you own a camera you can't take a tripod but you can look through modern wire railing so that your view and photos are not impeded.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"I have visited the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) Skypark on two occasions. Both times I did not pay anything to go up because I was accompanied by a friend who was a hotel guest. Anybody can visit the Skypark but you must pay SGD 20 at the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

I don't really know how tall it is but the view up there is just fantastic. You get to see the Singapore skyline with the skyscrapers of the Business district. The Housing Development Board or HDB apartments can also be seen in their various designs. This is Singapore's public housing and a greater percentage of the population lives in these apartments.

If you do go there after 6pm you may want to catch the sunset in the direction of the island of Sentosa easily identified by the moving cable cars plying between Sentosa and the mainland.

From the Skypark you can also see the ships in the harbour but what is more prominent since Singapore is a container port is the transtainers that lift and move the heavy containers. Let your imagination run wild and perhaps instead of the transtainers you will see the white AT ATs of the Evil Emperor's camp in the Star Wars movie.

If you look down facing inland you see a body of water. From the shore (all water) to the area behind the MBS, it was all sea. MBS is sitting on reclaimed land and the body of water has been turned into a fresh water reservoir adding to many other man made reservoirs all over the island. As we do not have natural fresh water resources aside from buying some untreated water from Johor Malaysia, we turn to desalination.

Oops! The Skypark itself I think has more than 1 F&B outlets (please check with the frontdesk). The infinity pool is only open to guests. You can walk the length of the boat-like Skypark. If you've seen the movie 2012 when the Mayan Calendar predicted the end of the world with the great flood, don't you think that the MBS Skypark looks just a giant boat capable of handling that flood?"
,,Great view,5.0,,As a guest at the hotel you get free access also to the Skypark. We went here in the evening to get a great view over Singapore. Not to busy during any of our 2 visits here during our stay.
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"Seeing Singapore from above, it's interesting. There are also a swimming pool here, but we have to pay again if we want to use it."
,,Best way to see the city!,4.0,,"I went to the Skypark as part of a night time tour. Amazing 360 degree views of the city and surrounds. Express lift to the top, did not take long at all. As usual in Singapore, everything was very well organised and orderly. The bonus was a tropical storm in the background which provided a spectacular light show. Next time I will go back in the day time for a drink at the bar. The photos they take of you aren't a little bit expensive but it's a nice souvenir."
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,"After we spent the morning visiting Gardens by the Bay, we walked over the the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and took the elevator to the 56th floor observation deck for a 360 degree view of the city. Breathtaking !!!! I don't thing there is a similar hotel anywhere in the world. Amazing views from an amazing hotel."
,,expensive,3.0,,"we went to the rooftop but expensicve, we didnt see the swimming pool with over looking, but nice experience anyway"
,,Singapore,4.0,,Most amazing hotel in Singapore Great view Expensive to stay there A must see in Singapore Don't miss it
,,Level 57 - Drinks at Sunset,5.0,,"probably one of the best places to watch the Sunset in Singapore.

Suggest booking a table as there aren't many on the outside to see the sunset. We were able to get a table (last one) as a walk up - be ready for a S$50 pp min to have a table."
,,Super,5.0,,"We loved the view from Marina Sands. We did not take the Skypark, but the offer of SGD 20 to go to Celavi and have a drink there. I think that is a better deal and experience than the Skypark"
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"We went here for a 50th birthday and had the most amazing time. Everything was perfect from the view, to food and drinks and the staff were so kind and hospitable. After lunch we passed time in one of the roof top bars."
,,Visit the Flyer instead,3.0,,"My visit was alright. I went during the day at non-peak hours, so I didn't experience any overcrowdedness . I have three main gripes about it. 1. The price for just going to the top of a hotel was too much 2. Like many observation decks in cities, you are on top of the most iconic building and therefore cannot see it, kind of ruining the point 3. Being able to see the amazing Infinity Pool so close is both good and bad. Yea, you can say you saw the pool now, but it also hurts to know you can't go and get in unless you are a hotel guest!

Go up the Singapore Flyer at night if you have to choose between these two."
,,Fantastic view..and that's that!!,4.0,,"So, you pay for going on the roof..

But the view is worth the effort. Only issue will be the crowd as well as the humidity. Please make sure you are carrying enough water as the stall selling stuff up there is exorbitantly priced.

Go in the evening. The view of Gardens by the Bay is fantabulous. And if you are on time, you can catch the sound and light show. There is one at GBB and the other one at the riverfront..."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"This is one of the best places you could ever visit in Singapore! It is stunning the view, you get served lovely food and drinks. The Staff are very friendly. The pool is luxury. The view from the pool is mindblowing. The only problem for me was the crowds."
,,Great if you're not afraid of heights,5.0,,Went to the 56th floor to have 360 degree view of Singapore at night. Beautiful outlook and would be better if you're able to go to the edge which we weren't able to due to being afraid of heights.
,,Fantastic!!,5.0,,"Wow!! What a fantastic place. I have nothing to say but You must be here, stay here, spend time here."
,,Good view but expensive and crowded,3.0,,"The view from this iconic building was a must-do on this trip. However, it was expensive, hard to find the way in from the very crowded and busy hotel lobby (the lift goes from the basement!) and offered nothing but the view from the 56th floor. The cafe and infinity pool are reserved for hotel guests. Spend 10 minutes looking at the views and thats it!"
,,Stunning views of Singapore,5.0,,"I have stayed at Marina Bay Sands on three occasions now and can genuinely say the main reason is the for the infinity pool at sky park on 57. The views are stunning, and waiters serve refreshments promptly. Always love returning, never get bored of posing for photos here. I'm not quite sure if you have to pay to visit skylark as i was a guest staying at the hotel."
,,pricey.....can be visited during sunset hours....,5.0,,The tickets seem to be a bit high side.....but the top view is great.....you can get to see the city with a full view......on your way up....there is a photo booth where you will be made to take picture compulsorily......as well on your way back...you may be asked to pay a quite high price for the picture.....if you wish to....then its your choice.....since it was my second visit there...i somehow managed to escape from them.....there is a cafeteria....all high priced.....and you are not allowed to access the pool area as it is reserved for the hotel guests....but you can see the pool from the place you are made to access.
,,Is this the pool?,5.0,,If it is it's great and probably the only reason to stay in this hotel. The infinity pool overlooking the city is a real bucket list achievement.
,,Great photo opportunities - High end shopping,4.0,,"Great for that photo to say you have been, however singapore offers much better and more interesting areas to visit if on a short time frame, so dont waste to much time getting lost in this huge area uless you have time to spend here properly."
,,Not worth the visit,2.0,,"The queues are long, especially to return to ground level. The views are good, but access is to only one small area at the end of the hotel. The price of the mandatory photograph is absolutely ridiculous. You don't have to purchase the photograph, but it is a complete rip-off. That experience alone sours the whole visit."
,,Beautiful Views of the City,4.0,,"Getting to the Skypark was one of the main things we wanted to do while we were in Singapore. On the plus side, the night views of the city and the Gardens by the Way were spectacular. I wish we could have gone earlier to see the views during the day as well. Also note that there are no ins and outs. So once you get up to the top, there's no going back after you leave. On the negative side, we were really hoping to be able to check out the rest of the massive deck, as well as the pool they have there. Unfortunately, paying for the Skypark only gets you access to the front portion of the deck. I guess maybe only hotel guests are allowed access to those areas. The price isn't bad (S$23, so about $17USD per person) and to me, well worth the price. They have a small snack bar and souvenir stand as well in case you get hungry or want things to bring home. Also keep this in mind. There were only two entrances to the hotel, one on each end, so if you're wanting to get to the Skypark quickly, you'll want to go to the building on the most northerly end (From the main street between the convention center and hotel, this will be the one on the left)."
,,Great views,4.0,,We went here in the evening as didn't want to risk views being obstructed by the haze during the day. Stunning views of the city and the Gardens By The Bay. There is a bar/ snack counter and gift shop. It's a great deck as it's not encased in glass so you can get clear pictures. It's overpriced when compared with other observation decks but the ticket is good for the whole day.
,,Amazing view..,4.0,,I managed to visit this place during my short holiday trip on 2010. This place just started to get famous by then. There were many people that day and the view on top of the skypark are really amazing.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Firstly, architectural and engineering masterpiece. Firstly, checking in a past midnight has its perks. Our room was upgraded to a 2-BR suite on the 54th floor, separate elevator lobby and access. This was living it.

I had breakfast cream cheese and smoked salmon bagel and a cafe latte at the poolside. A near 360-degree view, as far as the eye can see was fantastic. High tea the Rise cafe and night caps at the Ce La Vie Club lounge. An experience I won't forget."
,,Spectactular,5.0,,"The views are amazing, and unobstructed as y could imagine from that high up. Fantastic atmosphere and you could just sit and look out at the scenery for hours."
,,"Great Views, but a Little Pricey",4.0,,The views from atop the Marina Bay Sands are phenomenal. On a clear day you can see to Indonesia and probably Malaysia. We liked that we had both a water view and a skyline view. The view gives a good perspective to Singapore.
,,A Must See Attraction!,5.0,,Its a must see attraction in Singapore. Its beautifully located. Prize - 22$ time to visit - evening. Stay there till the sun sets so you will get both the views. Evening as well as night.
,,Superb view!,5.0,,"Chilly place with awesome view! Great for family with kids and elderly or even friends gathering!

We went in the night and my relatives are amazed by the beautiful city lights :)

There have a skybar too which is awesome for friends gathering! Enjoying the accompany and e lightings~

Do experience here if you visit Singapore, I believe it'll be a wonderful one :)"
,,Easily the best hotel in town,5.0,,Been to our company event. For an opportunity to check out the place. It's shear luxury. The casino is a must visit. Visit to the top floor is highly recommended. Gives amazing view of the city n beyond.
,,Great view but 23$ is too expensive,3.0,,Great view of the city but 23$ is too expensive to go up the roof deck. Go instead to the ce la vi bar which apparently is free. Just order a drink it will be cheaper than using the skypark
,,Diving over night stay,5.0,,Cool... spoiled... Book Suite it is worth! Great view. Incredible infinity pool. Price around 800 SD per night.
,,What a view,5.0,,Marina bay Sand sky park has the best view. Go in evening to experience best. You can try the dinner at top. You can also see the Cruise sailing port from top.
,,Great Views But!,3.0,,"We were recently in Singapore and visited the ""Skydeck"" at the Marina Bay Sands.

The views were great and the location spectacular, but it was a bit too commercial and manufactured for my liking.

The pool area was quite impressive. We had a quick drink and left and whilst it ticked the box for this experience I was a bit underwhelmed overall."
,,The views from the skypark,5.0,,The views from the sky park are amazing. Great way to see all the technology and science used to solve air pollution. Amazing clean air and un interrupted views. The information boards all around are very informative
,,Visit,5.0,,"Also my first time to visit, Marina Bay Sands is so high and breath taking. The highest spot in terms of building in Singapore with such magnificent views, one activity not to miss. Awesome view up top."
,,$25 down the drain,3.0,,"If you have $25 to spare and you enjoy taking pictures, then this place would be ideal for you. As for me, paying 50 for a few minutes is not my cup of tea. It could've spent on much more worthwhile outing."
,,Exexpensive great view but overrated,3.0,,Admission price was not called for alt hour was redeemed from drink tab. Very small area considering amount of tourists. Drinks ridiculously expensive. Crowded and busy.
,,Spring vacation in Singapore,5.0,,"Must visit and view the spectacular sunset of Singapore at night, the most of all have your swim suite with you to take a dip in the pool at the edge of the roof top, unforgettable view, feel the wind and 360 view of all corner of Singapore."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark.,4.0,,My wife and I visited the sky park as part of a tour and were pleased. You get a 360 degree view of the city which is lovely at night. There is a restaurant on the park which requires advanced reservation I believe.
,,Wonderful views of Singapore,4.0,,"We combined a visit to Marina Bay Sands Skypark with going to Gardens By the Bay as they are close together with an access path between them. We bought tickets beforehand from the information centre in Chinatown-I imagine there are other centres in the city or go online- which was cheaper and also meant no queueing at the ticket desk at the Skypark. Obviously we chose a day with clear skies! Views were of the sea, looked down on the gardens and the city in general. Spent a very pleasant hour at the top. We were very lucky with having no queue going up on the lift."
,,Exhilarating!,5.0,,Amazing views and fantastic experience. We watched a storm brewing in the distance with regular sheet and forked lightening. Exhilarating!
,,Expensive but with great views,4.0,,"The price to go up is shear extortion! By a drink and take out a second mortgage! If you can afford $100 a head meal it's a cheaper way to get a free ticket up to the top, just prebook.
Once up there it's pretty amazing but.... you are restricted to a very small part of it. The rest is for guests only.
It's the sort of thing you do once just to say you have!
Best to go on a clear day or early evening to see in daylight and watch sunset and see the night view twinkling below."
,,WOW view is amazing,5.0,,It costs S€23 to ride the escalator to the viewing platform where you get a fabulous view of the whole area. Dont expect to get anywhere near the famous infinity pool because that is for residents only
,,The Best ever,5.0,,The most amazing hotel i've ever be. It is expensive but when you get there at the pool area you Will know what i am talking about.
,,Great Views,5.0,,"An almost 360 degree view of singapore. It is hot up there, so an overcast day or an evening would be best. You cant access the pool of course, but it is still worth it for the almost uninterrupted views."
,,What a great view,4.0,,"We spent overnight in the Marina Bay Sands. Our granddaughter was absolutely excited beyond belief even though she had flown in excess of 12,000kms and had already experienced quite a lot in 8 days for a 7 year old girl. She told us we had saved the best for last. When we got up to the roof she nearly screamed with delight. The Skypark rated excellently with us as well. Great views and excellent staff made the visit very enjoyable"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A must visit if you are in Singapore. The shops, ice rink and boat ride through the mall is lovely. Plenty to do and see. You can watch the sky show from Marina Bay Sands and other shows, plenty going on at all times"
,,Singapore trip is incomplete without a visit to MBS,5.0,,"One of the iconic building
And once you enter this hotel
There is lot to see & explore
The lobby is grand & artistic
There are restaurants & waiting areas
Plus some shops
We went to the roof top bar with our local friends
We went thru super fast lifts/elevators
Specially for this bar
It moves like a bullet
Once you reach the bar
It's something out of this world
The bar itself is grand & happening
Plus the infinity pool on the side
And from here you can see the whole of Singapore
One of the life time experience
Enjoyed by all means ........"
,,Must go once,5.0,,I am in love with this structure.. beautifully made and breathtaking view. i went with my husband and we spent good 2 hours on top viewing each side. Its wowww
,,Lunch,5.0,,We wanted to go to the viewing platform on level 56 but as it was lunch time paid $20 redeemable against food and went to the casual eating area on level 57 where the view was incredible. The food was terrific and it ended up costing 4 of us about $36 more ...4 non alcoholic drinks and enough food for the 4 of us. Well worth it.
,,Magnificent building!,5.0,,"One of the coolest place in the world! It's a huge architecture and a entertainment place, it got over 2500 rooms in here. Also have casino and infinity pool. To have a drink in the skybar is wonderful experience!"
,,Great views - shame about the cost,3.0,,"I love going up to the Skypark and used to visit relatively frequently when my son worked at one of the main outlets at the top. However, if you are going up as a tourist then it can work out as quite pricey. Bearing in mind the view which is pretty much panoramic, you shouldn't be disappointed.
Go up on a clear day or evening to get the most from your visit and make sure you have a camera to hand. On a clear day, you can easily see some of the Indonesian islands to the South as well as taking in the extent of the port which spans from left to right if you are looking out to sea."
,,Don't expect full access,5.0,,"We were staying at the hotel but your ticket to this doesn't include access to anything but the public area as everything else is keycard protected for residents.

However, go and do this as it's an incredible location with views to die for, both inland towards the city and outward to the bay.

You can access the bar here as well which is worth a seat and a chill to watch the nightly laser show from a different angle.

Best view in Singapore."
,,Incredible Views,5.0,,This is a must see. Make sure that you spend sometime there and also try the drinks at the bar. Incredible views!!!!
,,View at a cost,3.0,,"My thoughts on this...Yes, the view is good, but the price is quite expensive and access to the entire roof top is limited unless you are a guest. You are not hurried but the reality is that once you've taken your photo's there is not much else to do. It may be better value at night."
,,Sensational view,5.0,,"The view from the Skypark was fantastic. We paid 24$ to get up there, and that money is also used to buy drinks up there. We had a chance to look at people swimming in the Infinity Pool. Worth a visit."
,,Wonderful views,4.0,,"Went up onto observation floor late afternoon and views where fantastic, took many photographs of whole of Singapore. Many points and buildings hadn't even noticed when travelling round city. By time had finished was early evening and marina area lit up was beautiful, perfect time to go up skypark. Before travelling up photograph of whole family taken, on way down was shown and actually liked photo, only to be told $50!"
,,Great views!,4.0,,"We bought tickets to the observation deck to see the evening skyline and it was worth it. The views are amazing and we just took our time and wandered about the deck. If you want to spend a lot of money, you can stay at the hotel and access the rooftop pools and dining. It was not in our budget to do so but I sure it would be great! The shops are all high-end also and cater to tourists with $$$$."
,,it was ok,4.0,,"Nothing much to say really, If you are in the hotel you will of course go up for a swim, good drinks at a fair price."
,,Beautiful Night Views,4.0,,"This is an excellent place to take in the night views, the lighting is spectacular over Singapore. The staff were friendly enough but initially we were told by hotel staff that it was closed at 10pm, we got in before closing at 11pm. This was a great experience & well worth doing & cost approx $23.00 each. Only complaint would be that we were famished but couldn't eat at the restaurant because we weren't staying in the hotel, it would have topped the night off beautifully."
,,Killer Views,5.0,,"We went for a view of the City and were not disappointed because it really is spectacular and worth the ride to the top. Not being local, although I had been once before, we didn't quite understand that its 3 towers with lots of different offers available on top. Looking at the building from outside this is obvious but we forgot. The result was that we ended up having dinner by inadvertently walking through the wrong door when we had only intended to have a drink and take in the view. Dinner was good, if expensive but it was inside the edge so we didn't get the full view from the table."
,,Great View,4.0,,We went to the Sands Skypark as part of a tour. The view of the waterfront and surrounding area is fantastic. It is well worth the cost.
,,Expensive but Must,4.0,,"it charges 23$ for ticket , but it has amazing view. Best time to visit by evening 5:30 or 6 PM. So you can capture sunset view"
,,"Good view, but overpriced",3.0,,"Great view of Singapore, but it is very overpriced. There are no seats or cafes accessible to the public- very disappointing for $23SGD each."
,,Great view from the top!,5.0,,Loved the view! We bought something to eat and drink and was pleasantly surprised at the reasonable price.
,,Remarkable!,5.0,,"It costs, but the view and the experience are amazing. This is an architectural wonder. Beware drinks are expensive, did not eat here."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"I recommend a visit to Marina Bay Sands Skypark just to take in the views of Singapore. Although I have not eaten up there I have had a few drinks. You don't have to be a hotel guest to visit Skypark. I will say drinks are a little on the expensive side but it is Singapore. Worth the visit, head up and take a look."
,,Hmm good view but worth the money?,3.0,,"Without doubt you get the best view of the Marina Bay area from this lookout but there is nothing up there except for the view, not even seats.
For me there is no need to do both the skypark and the singapore flyer and the flyer is much more interesting and worthwhile.
Also if you have seen the youtube video talking about a side entrance into a bar where you can get the views, sorry they must have seen the video as well and changed the set up. You now have to buy your tickets before getting on the lift."
,,Excellent Stay and View,5.0,,"In Singapore, evenif you are staying or not staying here, you must visit this hotel and the skylark atleast once. Casino is bit expensive but view from the top is just marvellous."
,,A nice view of Singapore,4.0,,"We have been there on a sunny weekend with kids. At the entrance of the hotel, Celavu restaurant team welcomes you. If you buy the tickets from them, it is 20 SGD per adult, you can both enjoy the view and can order food up to that amount so a nice deal. The service at the top is not great. The view is nice but I would prefer the Singapore flyer to Skypark for sure."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"It was such a memorable experience to visit one of the ""must visit"" in SG :) I really appreciate it. Very 👍🏻"
,,Great Marina Bay,5.0,,"It is not cheap to stay here but you should come to enjoy your life. My room was ok, clean and enought things. I paid 38 usd/per for dinner which also very good. The swimming pool at top floor hlep you cuold see all Singapo city....it is so lovely."
,,Absolutely Stunning views!,5.0,,"Besides the very impressive and grand facade that is Marina Bay Sands, the 57th floor offers breathtaking views of Singapore. I recommend going there at night because of the lights and the breathtaking view. I think this city is more alive and vibrant at night. There's a cocktail bar and snack bar as well. Unfortunately you wont be able to get into the exclusive bar if you're not a hotel guest, neither can you access the infinity pool. But, the pool is just a pool except that it's 57th floor high and with the views. We were content drinking our cocktails and just enjoying the view."
,,Fantastic Singapore views,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark definitely has the WOW factor. Fantastic views over Marina Bay Gardens on one side & Singapore city views on the opposite. A selfies are a must, although other visitors are only too happy to help."
,,Observation deck: kind of interesting but not very good value,3.0,,"Just to make it clear, I'm talking about the observation deck here. I went up there during the day.
Yes, yes, it's interesting to look around and get a misty view of Singapore from a birds eye perspective but otherwise it's a poor experience for the money.
After you pay your dues, you go up to a baron deck with nowhere to sit. I guess they don't want to encourage you to hang around for too long, once you've paid. That's OK. They only allow a little glimpse of the real Skypark because that's for hotel guests only. That's OK, too. I thought at least I order something at the restaurant raised above the observation deck but no, that too is for hotel guests only. If they are worried about people sitting there for hours over a mineral water, that could've been solved with minimum order values and time limits for non hotel guests but I guess they were not interested in entertaining the plebs. Oh wait! There was this crappy souvenir shop with nothing worth buying where you could also buy an overpriced can of drink.
Maybe, the place is a bit more spectacular after dark but I didn't bother to go and find out.
The whole Skypark doesn't actually seem that big from up there. A few trees, a pool, restaurants and whatnot on top of a building. I think it is one of those things which is much more interesting from a distance. It's the allure of what it might be (and isn't).
I suppose it's one of those must see things in Singapore which you tick off, on your list. Or, be a hotel guest...
So in the end, all you get is a good view of Singapore."
,,Such a cool place to visit.,5.0,,Definite stop in Singapore. Good price. Great service. Even better view. Will be definitely coming back here.
,,"Amazing view, you'll see!",4.0,,"Something different to be able to say you have been on top of the Marina Sands. The views were great overlooking Marina Bay and the greater Singapore . The cost of the souvenir photo was a rip of, $50, but this was the case with all major attractions we visited in Singapore. I'm sure if the price was more reasonable they would sell many more photos.
Good to do once, but wouldn't bother again within 8-10 years"
,,Sightseeing,5.0,,"Well worth the effort, we went at night and the view is amazing. All the lights give great photo opportunities"
,,Guests at the Hotel,4.0,,We spent quite a bit of time allowing the kids to swim at various times of the day. It was always very busy but the staff were very attentive. Great view and beautiful at night.
,,Rodeo Drive in Singapore,5.0,,"Everything about this hotel complex/Skypark is top class. The hotel itself, the beautiful roof-top pool, the food, the drinks, the shops. Just about every ethnic group is seen and welcomed here. Every top international brand in fashion, jewelry, food is here. Just make sure you bring A LOT of money with you to enjoy it all.
Not to be missed in Singapore.
Hope this helps and enjoy the luxury."
,,Nice,5.0,,"Love this place..the views from the roof top are amazing..like everything else in Singapore,it is very clean..the admission fee was $23 per adult..they took a picture of us before we boarded the elevator to the top and by the time we got off the elevator they had the 2 pictures ready and framed and tried to sell it for $150..really!!!
But it is a must do while in Singapore.."
,,What t say for this marvellous hotel,5.0,,"Day or night , for swimming or a drink and being resident or just a visitor , you must visit this hotel and the skylark. In case you 've visited the casino you are not advised t go t the Skypark in case you can not afford t loose !"
,,Amazing view with canapés and drinks,4.0,,Service was great even though I didn't like staying in the hotel MBS. The views were great while being served canapés and drinks while chatting and catch up on our trip! Staff are lovely and remembered our names each time we visited.
,,Not much other than a great view.,3.0,,"Visited a few years ago and was able to see all the glory of marina bay sands, enjoy a drink and take in the views. The skypark is now just an observation deck with no seating etc. the view is phenomenal but better option would be to book a table at the restaurant instead."
,,"Great view, amazing service",5.0,,"We've been on the rooftop bar at the flight at sky 57 without reservation. We did get a seat at the outside with a fantastic view over the harbour and skyline. The food was delicious full of flavour. The drinks not only looked great they also been perfect made and tasty. The service war friendly, helpful and really kind. We just want to go for one drink and spend over 4 hours up there. Absolutely well recommended, you get such a good value for what you pay! I will definitely come back when I get the chance."
,,Panoramic view of Singapore skyline from the observation deck,4.0,,"MBS Skypark

Marina Bay Sands (MBS) has become an icon now for Singapore. Tourists to Singapore must pay a visit to MBS. Otherwise, you will be considered not being to Singapore.

MBS Skypark is the ship-shape structure above the three towers of 55-floor hotel blocks. The observation deck is worth the visit. From here you will get a panoramic view of the stunning Singapore city skyline including the iconic Garden by the Bay. At night, there will be a spectacular laser light show which you should not miss. Don’t be there in bad weather. You will not be able to see anything.

Tickets are priced at $23 for adults, $17 for children and $20 for senior citizen aged 65 years and above.

Admission is permitted between 9:30am and 10pm (11pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday). There is no limit to the time guests may stay.

However, the much talked about Infinity Pool is reserved for hotel guests only."
,,Lovely view,5.0,,"This is a must view place to see , when you come to Singapore. Very fast lift . Must see twice . Once in the day and once at night . The night view is breathtaking"
,,Fun,5.0,,Great place to visit. I have been coming to Singapore for a long time and stayed in the Marina hotel and am always impressed with how magnificent this building is and the entire area surrounding it.
,,Noah's Ark build on top of a hotel.,5.0,,This is a must see hotel. The built a giant ship on top of three 50 story buildings and put a negative edge pool in the middle of it all! There are resturants and bars around the pool and the vibe is really awesome! Do not miss seeing this while in Singapore!
,,Wonderful views.,4.0,,"If you have had your fill of shops and the waterway through the mall then the park is a good escape, spacious, peaceful with a good view of the city both old and new which will give you an impression of roof top levels of colonial times and of course today."
,,Breath-taking views,5.0,,"Our first night in Singapore, we walked to the MBS and took the lift to the Skypark. We did not have dinner as I was wearing open shoes, but we had a drink and some light snacks overlooking the city of Singapore in all its majesty."
,,Worth it for the view,4.0,,"This is a fantastic place to visit at night... but be patient with the staff. It took about 10 minutes for them to process the bill for two basic drinks! Oh but the view makes it very worthwhile, simply stunning."
,,Excellent view,4.0,,"We went on a rainy day so half the bar area was closed and half the seating area allocated only for hotel guests. We paid $20SD each to get to the bar area which included a voucher at the bar for the same amount. Essentially you pay $20 for a beer. I've done it once, not something I'd do again. View excellent but cordoned off as mentioned."
,,up in the clouds!,5.0,,great place to visit despite tje restrictions on where you can go but the views are magic as is the shopping. You can also enjoy a delightful meal at anytime.
,,You are paying for the view,4.0,,"It is pricey, but you are paying for the view from the 56th floor, and I have to say that I enjoyed it, and I think that it is well worth the price. I did find $14 for a can of beer excessive though."
,,Entertainment and food options galore,4.0,,"Preliminarily, the architecture of the Marina Bay Sands is most unique. Once inside, the shops and restaurants are quite interesting. At night the view of Singapore from Ce La Vie restaurant is beautiful. And, the exterior night view -- with a laser light show -- is very impressive."
,,Sunset Highlight in Singapore,5.0,,"We arrived thru Tower 3 to basement 1, paid and up to floor 56. 6.30 pm close to sunset, Sunny skies. After dark it was a great performance. Don' t do it during the, it is very hot."
,,Fantastic view kind of must go,5.0,,"Marina Bay sands is a must go vistit while in singapor , it has also a water laser show in the evening , it s free just sit and Watch .the view is amazing and the lift to go up there is extremely fast but some time there is long queue to wait"
,,Infinity Pool!,5.0,,"One of the best infinity pool in Singapore. Although, Westin SG have one, but Skypark is larger much higher. :)"
,,OK its Kitschy but worth the 23 SND,5.0,,"they keep you in a small viewing area, but its agreat view of Singapore and really a must to for visitors. You can see the whole of Singapore and also into the straight. If you are staying at the hotel they have a roof top infinity pool that is spectacular"
,,Expensive for a slightly different view of the skyline,2.0,,We were surprised to find that entry was very expensive $23 per person to ride a lift to the top for a quick look. The restaurant gave free entry with a minimum spend of $80 per person. There are so many high rise buildings in Singapore to take in the sky line that we opted to opt out.
,,Nice hotel and infinity pool,4.0,,We stay for two nights at the hotel. The hotel is very big and busy. Very good breakfast with a lot of choice. From the room u have a very nice view at the bay ore the garden. That's most beautiful infinity pool I ever saw. We come back very soon.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,"I had a drink at the skybar and enjoy the fantstic view. I really recomend visiting this bar, not only for business but also families."
,,visit to the roof,3.0,,costs $20 which you can use at the restaurant. Food bad and coffee costs $8 fish and chips $20 probably better going to restaurant at other end
,,Excellent View,5.0,,"excellent place and amazing view, definitely worth a visit if in Singapore. We didnt pay to get to the Skypark as we were guests at the hotel so not sure how much it was and if it was value for money."
,,Best place to see Singapore night view,5.0,,"Nice place to view entire Singapore city with night lights, Interior of hotel is best. Has casino too. Best place to visit at Singapore. Skypark has special entrance"
,,A must do whilst in Singapore,5.0,,We took the lift to the skypark and were delighted by the fabulous views. Do partake in a frozen Singapore Sling - delicious !!
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,The Skylark has a fabulous view from all sides. Incase one is going to have a meal at the restaurant cest la vie one can save on the skylark tickets.Very relaxing views
,,No frills for visitors!,3.0,,"They just want to get you in and out as soon as possible. Felt a bit like paid your money, had a look out now go! Talked our way into the bar and had a drink but it was made clear that this wasn't really approved of! Come on, we are just giving you more money, and of course drinks weren't cheap!"
,,Evening views are beautiful!,5.0,,"This was included as part of our Singapore Adventure Pass, both my friend and I were nervous about the height. But once at the top we were breathtaken with the views of Singapore. We attended on a Saturday night, so the lights were twinkling below us. Managed some amazing photos of the Gardens By The Bay."
,,The most iconic view of Singapore,4.0,,"If you have a friend visiting Singapore, high chances that there will be selfie taken at the iconic infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands. So popular is this that the hotel finally restrict access to the top and open up an attraction zone where you will have to pay a fee to go up.
The infinity pool is now only accessible to hotel guests. Even if you pay to go up to the Skybridge, you still won't see the pool area to protect the privacy of hotel guests.
The observation deck now cost S$23 for adults to go u there, but there are a few restaurants that you can book there that can possibly gain you access to the same amazing view, including Ce La Vi, Sky on 57 and Spago by Wolfgang Puck."
,,Best View in Singapore,4.0,,"We had the most wonderful view though place was crowded. But we were given a good table to ourselves. Food was so-so for the price, but I think it's the view that you pay for. Next time, I will just try having cocktails and chill.😎"
,,Plan your visit,3.0,,"This area provides an excellent 360 degree of Singapore but if it's windy or raining it can be a disappointing experience.
The elevator takes you quickly to the 57th floor after you have paid the $20 S charge per person. This price can be used towards a drink but the drinks are very expensive.it is also possible to eat up there but a booking is recommended
Our visit was disappointing as there was a private function booked and all the viewing areas were roped off so the non function visitors could not get close to appreciate the view. Enough visitors complained and eventually some access was provided
It is a great view but the drinks are expensive, it is not pleasant if the wind is blowing and if there is a function which restricts access to the view."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Loved the outdoor garden area and views were amazing. Wished we could have seen it at night but worth a day visit. Loads of high end shops for the rich and famous and casino inside, so if on budget worth a window shop."
,,scathing,4.0,,"big, large, expensive, time to experience the attraction Gardens by the bay with spectacular shows in the evening to experience the adventure .."
,,Gigantic Hotel,5.0,,Beautiful hotel with 57 floors. Top deck is having very long dimming pool and observatory deck. You can see most of the Singapore from the top deck and this area is point for photographic lovers
,,Not bad.,3.0,,It's got a nice view. But can't say more. It was raining a bit when we visited. We were in and out quite fast.
,,a must see view for anyone visiting,5.0,,Great views of the city - come just before dusk and watcht the city change and light up - have a few drinks in Flight 57 and relax and watch the world pass by
,,Fab views,5.0,,Views of the Gardens and the city are great - although I heard tickets can be pricey for the amount of time spent (I spent about 10mins) - free entry for residents at Marina Bay Sands hotel
,,"Amazing building, great views.",5.0,,"The views from the top deck are incredible in every direction. Well worth paying to go up. And the building is very striking too, sitting by the bay like some kind of alien mothership!"
,,skypark,5.0,,"a must visit, stunning architecture and views especially from the top. no cost and good eating facilities"
,,Stunning 360 views across Singapore - spectacular at night!,5.0,,"Go to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Hotel to get the highest viewpoint for viewing Singapore. Watch the Sunset, see Singapore light up or watch the free evening light show. A glass screen allows you to walk around 360 degrees seeing all the famous landmarks and designer skyscrapers. Gaps in the glass create great photo opportunities. At a cost of 23 Singapore dollars it is well worth it. At the weekends this can get busy with tours and you may need to queue for the lifts but don't miss it!"
,,Fantastic!!,5.0,,"A must place to visit! The sky bar is amazing, never been anywhere like it before. Beware there is a $50 min spend, easy done with two senior Singapore Slings!!"
,,Unbelievable!,5.0,,"Unreal views from the top of the skypark, a must see whilst being in Singapore. There is a restaurant and shops to get drinks etc from. Definitely recommend."
,,Stellar views when the haze is gone,5.0,,Great view of the city and strait with all the freighter traffic depending on the night the lines can be long
,,Amazing views and classy place,4.0,,"Great views of an amazing place. Be prepared for the ride up the lift - it's a long way up. The cost is worth it and having a drink from the bar up top, whilst a little expensive you will look back at the city with sights to behold."
,,Highly Over-rated,2.0,,"Although the hotel itself is architecturally stunning, the rooftop bar/lounge area is a rip off. Food is mediocre and overpriced with marginal service. And the great environment/setting is disrupted by the throngs of people who purchase tickets just to access the observation area. Highly over-rated."
,,Amazing Scenery,5.0,,It's so amazing place with too many attractions..especially during night times..will visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark again on my next trip to Singapore..
,,its a must,5.0,,"Need to pay to geg up there now but if you go to the correct tower, the fee, about 20 bucks australian, gets you a drink. Once you get up, the views are more than worth the fee. Fantastic. Great place to enjoy a few beers."
,,Nice Shopping Centre in Marina Sands Hotel,5.0,,Luxury Shopping Center in Marina Sands Bay Hotel. Good Indian food options in the Food Court. Can visit if malls are your thing.
,,The best sight.....,5.0,,Fully recommended specially at night time...Youll see the fantastict panoramic view of Singapore city by the Bay.
,,Best Sunset View!,5.0,,Had fun with my wife staring at the sunset at the skypark. A good place to have relaxation on a busy SG.
,,Worth the money,4.0,,"It was worth the $23.00 to go up the top, cheaper than the wheel and you can leave when you have had enough. You can see over to the pool, if are thinking of eating up there you need to go to the restaurants as the café doesn't have much to eat. If you do go to the restaurant you don't need a ticket to go up. The view is amazing, even better on a clear day."
,,Great views,4.0,,"We went here just before and after sunset, we thought this was the perfect moment to go. You could see the sun go down and the sky was lit pink and bit by bit all the lights in the buildings and on the ships were turned on. The view was changing constantly, it was truely amazing."
,,Outstanding view of the city,5.0,,"Great view of Singapore at any time of day. The bar and lounge area is a terrific way to unwind, especially at night."
,,Quite expensive.,3.0,,"We went at night, maybe if we went just before sunset it would have been ideal. 1st experience seeing a city from a height, it was breathtaking and so was the price to see it!!! we did a week in KL after this, didn't want to go up Petronas Towers, experience seeing a city from a height didn't want to do it again in one holiday."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"Visited with friends on October. A must do but disappointing that can only access a small section of the area. A small kiosk for drinks and snacks, no access to restaurant or infinity pool. A great view of the Gardens on the Bay."
,,interesting place with family,5.0,,My first time on top of the bay sands i was intrigue by the sight of singapore bustling city from above. The infinity pool is awesome but always overcrowded.
,,very nice rooms. pool view was worth the money:),5.0,,"I agree with many ppls review that the hotel service is very impersonal as they recieve so much traffic. At checkout all i had to do was fill in a form and drop it in a box and leave.
At checkin had to wait a while for check in queue as it was quite busy as youvwould expected. We were confused as there were no sign to where checking was. Had to ask someone for help.
Wasnt happy with one staff as they asked if we wanted to pay more as we requested rooms close by. We have 3 kids and didnt want to be in rooms too far apart.
We were told we will recieve email once rooms are ready. Waited and nothing so had to go checkin desk again to ask.
Served by another staff who was very nice and efficient and professional. Told us she found us rooms available next to each other. Really appreciated her effort as it made a big diff when your travelling with small kids.
Rooms were nice clean modern and felt luxurious. Large nice showers/ bathroom. We stayed in deluxe room on the 20th floor. Spectacular views of the gardens by the bay. Was special waking up and opening your curtains to that. I think the gardens view is way nicer than city view and saves you a bit :) Each room had a nice large balcony. No outdoor furniture though, not even a wicker chair to sit and enjoy the view which is puzzling.
Lots of shops mostly high end brands. Restaurants cafes pharmacy small supermarket....prices generally exp. Affordable food court goid for kids on lower floor.
Lastly the infinty pool. WOW. Spectacular views day or night. Just feel unreal swimming up there. Clean and well maintained. Family friendly. Kids had so much fun they didnt want to leave. Everyone is taking selfies up there including us :) Its definitely a must do on evryones bucket list. Best way to end our visit to Singapore."
,,Just Amazing.,5.0,,"Don't miss a trip to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The view of the Harbour and Gardens, all on reclaimed land, is spellbinding. It's not an inexpensive entry but it's definitely a ""must do"" when staying in Singapore"
,,The Ideal Place to Drink Your Singapore Sling,5.0,,"We took the lift to the rooftop viewing platform and bar where we enjoyed a Singapore Sling - not the cheapest place to buy a drink, but an unforgettable location especially at night."
,,A honest report,3.0,,"To visit the sky park will cost you but in my opinion its not worth it for what you get a trip in a lift , the views are good , and there's a small cafe up there , but you are not allowed to use the infinity pool , so if you want to take photos visit it"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Went to the roof top bar on the 57th floor. Excellent views of the bay. Cost $20 each but you get it back off your first drink. Really good atmosphere. Well worth a visit.
,,Pay for photo views,4.0,,This does not get you into the hotel or pool. You pay for the view alone and expensive drinks. Can get busy especially at sunset. But people don't stay long so if you're patient you will get a place next to the balcony and take your pictures. Other than that there is nothing to recommend it. We preferred the view from the city looking at MBS.
,,Nice Place to Visit,5.0,,Thrilled by the lift operations 56 floors in 26seconds. Fansatic scene of the whole country in the floor.
,,Holiday,5.0,,This structure - inside and outside plus up high at the observation deck was an incredible experience. One attraction we will never forget and so glad we experienced it. The views from up there were breathtaking! A must see on your list of things to do and experience in Singapore.
,,Christmas Dinner at Marinana Bay sands Hotel,5.0,,When we found we were going to be in Singapore on Xmas day we booked our dinner at Marina Bay Sands.We had a beautiful Smorgasbord dinner with so much food we were unable to sample everything.The variety was great catering for all tastes.My husband loves Seafood and he was in Heaven.The variety of Desserts was lovely done in the Christmas theme.The cost wasn't any dearer than if we went out to Christmas dinner on the Gold Coast Australia where we live.We would certainly do this again.
,,Beautiful view of the Singapore skyline,4.0,,"Marina Bay sands skypark offers the best view of Singapore skyline especially in the evening. The tickets can be purchased online or from any shops in the city.
Best time to visit is around 6 in the evening by the sunset and then stay on till the night to enjoy the lit view. You can also see the sound and light show from the top that is another popular attraction."
,,A total sun trap!,5.0,,The Skypark is absolutely fantastic. Great observation deck with great panoramic views. Shop and bar there too. Admission is Singapore $23... BUT if you are staying at the MBS its free (and you can get to it from the infinity pool/jacuzzi / sun deck area which is for hotel guests only)
,,"Pay the money, get your pictures",4.0,,It's worth it. The views are simply stunning. Just elbow your way in or wait a few minutes for a spot to open up.
,,AMAZING (no access to pool or entire deck!),5.0,,"You have two options, or you buy a ticket to visit a small part of the skydeck or you buy a voucher of 20$ which allows you access to the bar/restaurant where you can use this voucher to buy food or beverages. We chose the last option.

We bought tickets earlier in the afternoon and returned around 8:30pm to celebrate our last night in Singapore. A cocktail started from 24S$ so we only paid an extra S$8.

As it was Sunday they allow casual wear, on other days smart casual which means no slippers, ect. You can spend unlimited time on the deck. The bar is higher than the skydeck so limited space to walk around when it's busy. If you really want to take stunning photos and have plenty of space, buy tickets for the skydeck. If you want to have a romantic dinner or a drink with limited clear views, buy a voucher for the bar/restaurant. Enjoy!"
,,Very nice spend few evening,5.0,,Very nice but big. So planed well I like the most light and sound show. This show is for 15 min but every hrly from 8pm till 10pm. I shall say it was amazing not to be missed. For food there is huge food court on lower level but good 10 min walk in side the mall.
,,Worth paying for the view,5.0,,This is an hotel which allows the public paid access to what are the best views of Singapore. You are so high up that you can see all the sites and plan your visit - but do wait for good weather as there is no shelter.
,,Worth the visit for the views,3.0,,Don't expect much when you are up the top as there isn't much there but the views are great and you see a lot of Singapore from here!
,,This Hotel Speaks for itself!,5.0,,"While traveling to Singapore, this is the hotel that I wanted to stay at, however it was sold out, but I did get to stay in another great hotel right next to this one, but if you want to stay in the best hotel, this is the one for you!"
,,Great location,5.0,,Nice place to enjoy and make photos. So I visit with my friends and enjoy a lot. So many things have to look. Nice
,,Better than the Flyer.,5.0,,Sorry to the Flyer but this has got to be a better experience (we did not go on the Flyer after coming up here). You are much higher up and have incredible views. There is also a shop selling a limited amount of touristy bits and drinks. You can stay as long as you like and it wasn't overcrowded. You are limited to the City half but you're not really missing much of the Port area. Great photography opportunities and very interesting to watch the selfie Kings and Queens.
,,Oh wow!,4.0,,"At $23.00 per adult the Skypark isn't cheap but boy what a view!!! As soon as you step out of the elevator the view is a ""oh wow"". Fantastic opportunities for photos, walk around at your own pace with written information placed around the edges. But don't think it's a way to access the incredible infinity pool, because that's for guests of the hotel only."
,,Amazing view from an impressive hotel,5.0,,"Well worth taking the time to ride the lift to the Observation Skypark at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. We travelled at night and it was stunning, still humid but the city was glittering with lights. The viewing deck is open in areas which allows you to take photos through the fencing. It is worth the fare from memory about $12 AUD The view from the top is astounding and you can take your time to view with crowds not overwhelming. Well worth a visit to see all of Singapore."
,,Great views but not worth the wait,4.0,,"The Skypark will definitely give you a different vantage point over Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline, but personally I would not queue up for it for more than 10-15 minutes. You will get almost equally good views from the promenade just outside the hotel, minus the height of course. The bar is nice but outrageously priced."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,Great place for those who want to see the fabulous views of Singapore. Building itself is absolutely beautiful and so clean. When you access you can have your photo taken and at the exit purchase a beautiful memory and have access to download photos afterwards.
,,Stunning Views!!,5.0,,We took a trip to the top and enjoyed fabulous views of Singapore!! we spent around an hour 'looking' at all the land marks. Another good feature was that there was a reduced price for seniors.
,,Awestruck,5.0,,"It looks so different in the image and when you see it for real , huge and mammoth building standing so tall with a combined roof - quite a civil wonder"
,,You have to go to the Roof Top !,5.0,,Incredible views !! A Tropical Storm came through whilst we were in the Bar - Thunder & Lightening A experience not to be missed ...
,,Must see,5.0,,Go to the top and view all of the city and harbor. If you have time there's a nice restaurant and bar.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"How they build this hotel is amazing, just walking in it is interesting. The view from the top, especially over the gardens is great. It gives you a great perspective of the city. It also links to an amazing shopping mall"
,,Awesome Views from the top.A must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"A trip to the top of Marina Bay Sands is well wrth the money. With excellent views all across Singapore,definitely a fine day activity."
,,Go on take a look inside,4.0,,"We wandered into the Marina Bay sands Hotel after we had taken a walk around the Supertree Grove which was magnificent at night.
Inside the hotel is huge and has several areas on the ground floor to eat. We decided to have a meal after venturing to the 57th floor to see the views. Its definitely worth a look even if your not staying in the hotel."
,,Great views of the City,3.0,,"The Marina experience was good but overpriced. At 25 SD per person , no seats at the top to allow for looking out, no information on what you were looking at and NO access to the bar unless you were living in the hotel ! It was pretty much up, see the view , back down. Really not the best advert for Singapore."
,,Holiday,5.0,,Relaxing by the pool taking in the sights is amazing. We enjoyed a swim when checked in then went to rise for dinner then back up to the pool to enjoy the scenery by night. The cocktails are yummy but can get expensive.
,,Awrzome city view,4.0,,"You have a incredible view over the whole city on the top. Expensive though, you can do it without paying"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"When you get up to the 57th floor you get absolutely spectacular views of Singapore harbour, especially at night. On one side of the roof area you get the riverside view whilst on the other you get the Gardens by the bay which when lit up at looks amazing.
You can also see people swimming in the infinity pool on this level as well but it will cost you $20 (Singapore) but that can help to get a drink, be warned 4 drinks $90 (Singapore) but you're on holiday so enjoy."
,,Oh the views!,5.0,,"What a treat and thanks to MBS for allowing visitors who aren't guests. It could do with seating up there but the floor was comfy enough if you need to sit and soak it in. Don't forget a frozen Singapore sling, The cheapest in Singapore!"
,,Lovely view on the top!,4.0,,"Whether it's in the day or at night, waiting for sunrise or sunset, a dip in the sky pool while looking out to the beautiful city view of Singapore is a sight to behold!"
,,A must see part of this extraordinary city,4.0,,It's worth paying the S$20/person to go to the rooftop bar at sunset. The $20 can be used to buy a drink.
,,The views are great,3.0,,"The only problem is the lack of shade on the Skypark. The views are great but, facilities do not encourage you to stay too long. Still it is worth thevisit, but take sun protection"
,,Awesome megabuilding structure 😎,5.0,,Wish we could stay much longer to experience more of the overlooking view at the pool....and to relax more in the chic room. My kids and so were we really had fun and enjoy d place. Have to stay much longer nxt tym. 😁
,,A must to visit ! Amazing,5.0,,Fab place to visit the sights are totally brill go up to the viewing points 56th floor or the bar on the 57th floor take some amazing photos ! The sights are wonderful. Even has a shopping centre on the bottom. Something for everyone.
,,Great view,5.0,,"Went here with my wife for a quick lunch and drinks. If you tell the elevator operator that you will be having drinks, no cover charge to go up the ~65 floors. GREAT view all around. We went during the day; probably more spectacular at night. Good drinks, good service, good lunch bites."
,,visit to supurbe place,5.0,,"this hotel is the best in Asia, just to walk around it is enjoyment. it has a big shopping mall attached to it. just minutes from rhe great lion and open sea food resturants"
,,Must place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,Don't miss it. You need whole day to explore this marina bay and nearby attractions . Go got observatory at top floor .
,,nice view but not so worth the money you pay for the ticket,3.0,,"When I went to the Skypark for the first time, they still allowed people to walk to the swimming pool, so, it was more interesting. However, they decided to close the area because it became pretty awkward for actual hotel guests who were swimming in the pool when so many people walked around to take pictures.
So, now, when you go up, you get good view but it's very small and will finish walking around the whole park pretty quickly.
And, in the day time, it can be extremely hot and humid... So, overall, not so spectacular..
If you want to enjoy the view (especially night view), it's better you go over to Level 55 (bar with big variety of beer and enough food to go along) at Marina Bay Financial Centre and spend the same/similar amount of money and get the great view with a drink in my opinion."
,,drinks and Nibbles with Colleagues,5.0,,By Far the best pool and modern ambience of any bar in SG. The food from the bar5 menu was substantial and the bar staff are very knowledgable. Views are amazing also
,,Just do it,5.0,,"For those of us that didn't stay at the hotel, go up to the sky park anyway. Don't go to the viewing section, go to the bar and have a drink or lunch. Sit outside. The bar will cost you $20 each credit to spend on drinks to get up there. Once your up, do it, have lunch and enjoy such a unique spot. Prices are reasonable, service is ok, even if both those are not as good as elsewhere on the ground, it doesn't matter :) a must do in Singapore."
,,Marina Bay Skypark,4.0,,"The view from the top is super. The cost to go up seemed high as you are only allowed access to a small area on the East end of the Skypark. The cost at present is $20 SD each.
If the high cost doesn't bother you, the view is worth it."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,This is an amazing place to visit. This iconic place cannot be missed. This is a superb place and make Singapore one of the top five cities in the world. The words gobsmacking and amazing definitely apply.
,,Lovely views of the gardens,5.0,,This is a beautiful attraction and worth the money. It's just amazing the detail that Singapore has put into their gardens and bird life. This walk let's you see it all and gives you a personal experience with nature.
,,It is an iconic world place,5.0,,This location is one of the iconic place that you must be in your life. The design and the attractive location is unique
,,Coolest infinity pool ever,5.0,,"Words don't really do it justice. After four nights in Chinatown and one night in Indonesia, we returned to stay at MBS. This infinity pool, day or night, is simply stunning. You can have poolside service from Spago (hello, awesome) and just take in ALL of Singapore. It doesn't get any better."
,,Must do thing in Singapore,5.0,,The building is as iconic as the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. The problem is if you do not stay at the hotel or dine at the rooftop restaurant you cannot view the swimming pools.
,,Good Hotel for stay,4.0,,"Hotel and shopping is nice , but if you get standard rooms on lower floors in Tower 3 thank its better staying at other hotels. The standard rooms are very basic . Health club is nice but not out of the world."
,,Breathtaking view!!,5.0,,"Their view is absolutely amazing, just as I imagined through seeing pictures online. You get a complete city view and it really feels like your high up there in the sky. It's a must see if your staying at this hotel... this was well worth it because you don't get city views like this in Canada.

We stayed at Marina Bay Sands hotel so we had easy access to the pool, just went in our elevator and went to the 57th floor.

Keep in mind that each individual going into the pool area will need an access card. You cannot use one access card for two guest, so you both need it. You must scan to enter and scan to leave.

I felt like I was at a Las Vegas night club for a moment when I was here, with the pools and loud party music. There are restaurants here too and it looked like you could have fancy birthday dinners here too."
,,View is amazing at night,4.0,,"Fantastic view at the Skypark, but would suggest everyone go at sunset or night. It cost $20 to go up, so you want to try and go at the right time. There is 2 ways to pay, you can go into the hotel & pay $20 & they give you a voucher worth $20 to spend at the bar, or you can go downstairs and pay $25 just to see the views. Of course the hotel is the best option & the one we did. We weren't disappointed, views were amazing, as you drank your cocktail. Got to look at the hotel pool as well, amazing!!! Now want to stay there next time we come back to Singapore."
,,The most amazing night view,5.0,,The best time of the day to visit Marina Bay is at night. We had the chance to see a night water show in front of the shopping mall. The experience and the show was breathtaking. You can walk around for hours at night as there is always something to see and an event to be a part of.
,,Spectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"What we shall say for this modern art monument?

The view either from outside before you climb is something that only Singaporeans make it happen.
The view from the top is something we will never forget since the feeling is that you are in the heaven. It is so unobstructed however very well organized in terms of visitors safety and security.
They could offer few more tables with seats but I am not sure if will break the harmony of the case"
,,Wonderful views,3.0,,"The views were fantastic and totally worth the price however you only have access to a small portion of the deck, there is a restaurant but it is for hotel guests only. You cannot even view the infinity pool from the observation deck."
,,Treat yourself ro spectacular views of singapore,4.0,,"So I'm not always a fan of these viewing decks but the building itself fascinated me so we all went for walk around the water front area to get to it. I highly recommend this walk if you can manage it. We saw it all lit up in its glory across the water than walked across the bridge to it. This in itself was an amazing experience. As you enter the building you see the large scale, massive area spread out with glamorous shops. If you have lots of money to spend you will be at home here. We walked through past the casino etc to the skypark. You start to feel a little like you are in a maze and definitely not for anyone who may be afraid of heights or suffer from claustrophobic. The process to buy tickets and get to the deck is seamless. However I will add that the photo idea is really a bit expensive. With printing prices so reasonable these days no one can justify paying $50 Singapore dollars for a pic. Once you get to the deck I cannot describe to you exactly what's it's like. But you will get wowed by seeing Singapore lit up before you. They don't do things by halves here. Loved it. For the photographers out there.. well worth the money. I wish I had brought my Camera though the phone these days is enough. Do it."
,,"Fanatstic view, a must for selfie lovers",5.0,,"Initially we planned to skip , Eventually compromised Singapore Eye and visited this . I think that was right decision . Its worth every penny . Spend sometime there , visit after 7 pm"
,,View,4.0,,"We visited the skybar a sunny afternoon. You have a wonderfull 360 degree view over Singapore. S$20 for access, which could be redeemed when you bought something in the bar."
,,Interesting but not great,3.0,,"It's a nice way to spend an hour or so. You don't have 360 views of Singapore so the scenery gets old pretty quick. We were lucky we went at the right time so we were able to enjoy the views and even watch the Sounds and Lights show from the deck which was nice.

There's no where to sit and no shade anywhere so I recommend not going on a sunny day. I've been to much nicer observation Decks where they have a variety of activities, seats, wifi and even ports to charge your phone, nothing of the sort here. There was a souvenir shop which served drinks but no food.

We stayed for about an hour and a half and really took it in but most people stayed for about half an hour, which may not make the $23 entry fee worth it."
,,See Singapore from the eyes of the Sky,4.0,,Nobody sees Singapore like the sky does. So time to be an inch closer to the sky as you view the heavenly looks of the gorgeous lights and merlion's royal aura. Must visit for the charms and charisma of this amazing architecture and view.
,,Must do,5.0,,This is a must see when travelling to singapore. I didnt have to wait at all and the views from the top are definately worth it. Also to just walk around in this hotel was amazing.
,,Spectacular views,2.0,,"Great view but you'll only get one part of the sky deck with the standard observation deck ticket. With that reasoning, the ticket is not worth the price. The photographer taking our 'iconic' picture of us and the skyline is LOUSY. The image had no focus point, no art direction and worse NO SKYLINE IN THE PICTURE. When we collected our photos it was low-res and grainy like an old photograph."
,,beautiful architecture.,4.0,,"Located near the harbor, it's truly a good place to walk and see the sunset.You can find lot of restaurant near this place."
,,Good if have loads of money in your wallet,4.0,,"Its for the rich,of the rich and by the rich. Its a super luxury resort world which has best in the planet luxurious hotel rooms with a infinity pool at the 57th floor which offers stunning view. The Shoppe is a large super mall with many world leading luxury brand stores than you can imagine all under one roof. It has casinos, lounges and hundreds of eateries inside it. 56 th floor has a deck which offers a skyline view bit draws handsome cash out of the pocket.its spectacular at the evening though long queues are an irritant. Also it can be better managed to clear the crowd waiting for the elevators and elevators need proper aircon."
,,Amazing view but pricey,4.0,,This was my first time up to the Skypark and it is an amazing facility for sure. The view is unbelievable. However to pay $117 for 4 beers is very pricey. Ouch!
,,wonderful views,5.0,,"my family were in Singapore on a holiday, and we loved the views of the city from the skypark, the drinks were wonderful and there was all around a great atmosphere"
,,Amazing view of Singapore,5.0,,"Great view from top of boat on top the three buildings: marina bay skypark! View on all buildings, see boat waiting for the port. Saw it in evening, with all light that's fantastic!"
,,lunch with a view,5.0,,"Went up 57 floors to enjoy a very tasty lunch, drink and a view out of this world. I had a salad and everything was crisp and fresh, my husband had a burger and fries and said it was very tasty. We sat and watched people swimming in the infinity pool. Loved it ."
,,Expensive but worth it.,4.0,,"$23 to the building with no maximum stay. Great views of the city, plenty of space and not busy when I went (5pm). Opportunity to buy souvenirs and drinks/snacks on the top. I spent about 45 minutes taking pictures and looking at the views. Easy access to subway after viewing. If you have the time this is great to do!"
,,Ce La Vi Skybar,5.0,,"After a tip from a taxi driver we decided to skip the queues waiting to visit the sky park and wandered down to the lifts providing access to Ce la Vi restaurant and bar.

We zoomed up 57 levels and wandered out to panoramic views of Singapore. Amazing! We could see our hotel across the bay where we were staying on the 27th floor. 30 levels higher...it was time for a drink!

It was early evening and we were lucky to find a table without a reservation. Staff told us that most tables were booked for dinner. We each enjoyed a cocktail and shared a cheese board before summoning the courage to walk over and admire the amazing views.

While you don't overlook the rooftop pool you can wander down from the bar if you want to see it. We were happy with our choice, a relaxing drink under an umbrella in the sky was a memorable experience."
,,"Stunning views, amazing pool (if you're not into lengths) and possibly some of the best cockails in the world",5.0,,"Awesome, breathtaking views over Singapore combined with an infinity pool that is simply stunning mean Skypark should definitely be on your list of things to do in SG. The pool is great, provided you're not wanting to churn out the lengths, as you'll have to avoid the selfie-stick wielding masses, but for memorable images it's a must. The staff are attentive and welcoming, with little touches like remembering your names adding to the overall experience. Great cocktails - and I mean really great here. Decent food too.

We visited as hotel guests so enjoyed better access than day visitors but for views and experience it's well worth a visit."
,,View,5.0,,"It's a good place for view and take the pictures, go before the sunset so have a before and after and both are completely different and see the 2 light show one other on the trees and other on water"
,,Passing by,5.0,,"To join a vessel, very good and nice place we're you cannot forget next time i will till all my friends to travel Singapore to renew there lives"
,,A landscape,5.0,,"I can't really say much here. I walked around but had no reason to linger.However, I know it is a popular area with tourists."
,,Bulding of the future.,4.0,,"It just looks incredible. From both sides it appears to look like a building from the future. Unfortunately I couldn't make it to the top and swim in the pool.
There's a laser show at the event place or sth just at the door if you want to enjoy some evening activity outdoors. Thing to see!"
,,Breathtaking views ..,5.0,,Breathtaking.. woww.. amazing.. only these words i can think of.. when i think about Marina bay sands Sky park.. amazing weather
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark beautiful architecture,5.0,,This is famous location in Singapore. Nice architecture. This building look like as a ship landed over three tower. This is near to Marina Bay Garden. Nice place to visit.
,,Wow what a view,5.0,,What better place to unwind and relax at the end of a busy day than the top of Marina Bay Sands. Great atmosphere and well worth the trip up to see the city and enjoy
,,Good views,4.0,,"There is a $23 charge per person to visit the observation area or a $20 charge to visit the bar at Ces le Vie where you redeem the $20 charge for food or drink. We chose the bar option, which have a view of the infinity pool. This side of the building gave good views of the Gardens by the Bay and the 'super trees.' The other side gave great view of Singapore harbor."
,,Awesome View !!,4.0,,We went as hotel guest and were able to gain access to the pool area with our hotel access key. The view was breathtaking ! Skyline of Singapore in the day and night. The view of the city on one side and on the other side the view of the sea together with Marina Barrage. Tourists without access key are restricted to one area. Remember to bring a sweater as it gets pretty cold at night and even in the morning! Can't imagine why handsome hunks and bikini babes in the pool don't feel the cold though:)
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"From here you can see all the city and the fantastic bay downstair, i am fall in love of this psrt of the city, if you can just go there in the night time ☺"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Have been to the top twice now. The views are just fantastic. You are a lot higher than the Singapore Flyer. Tickets are pretty cheap. There's a lovely cafe up top to sit and relax. You can take a panoramic video looking over the entire city.
,,Stunning views,4.0,,Gives great views over the city and the ocean. Sit back and enjoy the cool breeze. Cafe/restaurant available allows you to take full advantage of the amazing location!
,,Breathtaking Views at night,5.0,,Wow the views are awesome at night and its definitely worth the money. You won't be disappointed. Would be great if you could pay to swim in the pool
,,Beach resort atmosphere with a view,5.0,,"The Skypark has a beautiful infinity pool, several restaurants and a relaxed, resort-like atmosphere. The view is very satisfying at any time of the day."
,,Sunshine in Singapore,5.0,,Excellent views and outstanding Singapore Sling served although not cheap. This is a must visit for anyone who is visiting Singapore. We had just completed a 10 day South China Sea cruise and were spending four days site seeing in Singapore
,,Great 360° views of Singapore,4.0,,This is one of the best places to get spectacular views of Singapore. I have been to the Skypaek a few times and still am just as amazed each visit. Highly recommend to experience this while in Singapore.
,,Was on the roof,5.0,,Fabulous setting good food good music what a fun place to be.Went with two new acquaintances to this Hotel we all enjoyed the ambience
,,Amazing building,5.0,,This is the most beautiful building and the views from the top are spectacular. We had a delicious lunch and highly recommend.
,,An awesome place to stay but very rude staff up the Rooftop swimming pool.,5.0,,"We planned this trip to stay @the Marina Sands and experience the talked about place. We loved it very much but not happy with the staff up where the pool deck who handles the entry cards. She was very rude, a Chinese lady called Angie! She was so rude my girls panicked as she told us to stay aside while others gets in with their cards which we had but didn't work! That wasn't our fault as we were given from the reception, we had a SUITE Room also do you can imagine how costly that is then to be treated very rudely is not on at all. Another security came to us and I told him this isn't a good start for our arrival to this expensive place. He immediately told the Annie lady to get us through after he asked what room number we are! But I did told him that it's not a good start for a new arrival guest:("
,,Must see but it is what it is,3.0,,"In singapore, it a bit of a must see since it is so iconic. However because of this, it is quite overpriced to go up there. I think there is a cheaper way to get up via one of the restaurants/bars but I had no time to research. It is a great view up there, you can sortof see the pool too."
,,I stylish experience,4.0,,Nightclub and the many bars were great. Very expensive as a tourist if your not specific in what you order. I bought a glass of champaign and a beer for over $60. That's a bit rich but buyer beware. Staff are friendly.
,,Nice cityview from rooftop,3.0,,"The cityview from the highest floor is superby. However, the prices of the bars and eateries up there also valued themselves to be more of upscale dining as well"
,,Most stunning views of Singapore,5.0,,"A must visit place in Singapore. Especially if you like a birds eye view. Shows the city from a totally different perspective. Spend atleast 2 hours. Tip: Reach by late evening time, so able to enjoy the day as well as night views- nothing like the city being gradually lit up!"
,,Overpriced,2.0,,"Although the views are fantastic, we found the experience to be overpriced and nothing special. When you look at the top from ground level, it looks as though there is a lush tropical garden up there. When you get to the top you realise that the good bits are for the use of hotel guests only. You pay for the view and that's all you get. I wouldn't bother"
,,Worth a visit especially at night,5.0,,The view of Singapore's skyline at night from the MBS is most stunning. Worth a visit among friends or family.
,,too crowded for a dip,3.0,,"i was here 5 years ago and the experience was breathtaking ... the swim during day or night was very satisfying as you can lae around unhindered.
but last month, when i was there overnight..... the pool was crowded with : non -swimmers just taking photos... took a long time to find a deck chair to laze around.
the water is no more pristine."
,,Great view of the City,3.0,,This is a very impressive building and one of Singapore's icons. The ticket to get to the observation deck is quite pricey $23usd. The views are very good with approx 180 degree view of the city. Unfortunately if you aren't a guest at the hotel you don't have access for the whole top of the building. Apart from this it is a must see of singapore
,,A must see view of this beautiful city!,5.0,,"What a stunning city! Stunning skylines, people everywhere out and about taking in the city and you can watch it all from on high at this amazing hotel with a unique observation deck on the 56th floor.

If you are in Singapore don't miss this opportunity."
,,great view,3.0,,provides a great view had a significant elevation of downtown Singapore. However I felt it was somewhat overpriced
,,Beautiful views,5.0,,"I spent 2 and a half hours up sky park - it was beautiful.
Fabulous views of Singapore it really is a wonderful city.
I stayed up to watch the sunset and because i wanted to see the light display which in my opinion wasn't worth the wait. The display was a bit disappointing however watching the sunset made up for the long wait.

Also the hotel and infinity pool looks stunning - if I had the money or time to spend in there I 100% would."
,,Awesome must visit,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, its must go place, an icon of Singapore, at top 58 floor amazing experience"
,,Unique Night View,5.0,,"Went to Marina Bay Sands Skypark specifically for the view of the Singapore skyline at night. Was not disappointed. You can watch the Gardens by the Bay night show on one side and the fountains on the other side. Go up there for the unique experience and buy a frozen slushie Singapore Sling, and sip away the evening in style."
,,Great view,3.0,,Excellent views but thats all you can do up there. Unless you visit the bar. Doesnt take long to get up there at all. Exactly 56 seconds to be exact. I wouldn't say it is value for money but the view is priceless.
,,Good sunset view,4.0,,We visited Marina Bay Sands observation deck at around 6pm. We had booked tickets using klook and had to get it redeemed at the Hamleys attached to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Sunset was at around 7pm and we got a good view of the skyline.
,,Hum nothing special,3.0,,"The building itself is amazing from downstair...massive, impressive and beautiful! Once on the top, I have to say I had a bit of disappointment. I was expecting a nicer view. Lebua hotel in Bangkok offer much better service even if you aren't guest in the hotel and the view is greater! I was not really impressed by the laser show too....(everyday around 8pm) fortunately this is free!"
,,A whole town!,5.0,,"Seriously, it is a whole town. You could stay there for weeks without leaving! The hotel is a luxurious treat. The service is awesome. They have almost every kind food. The infinity pool on the roof is something else."
,,Nice view,5.0,,Visit the bar at the rooftop. Very nice building and view over Singapore. Absolutely a must have seen.
,,Nice night view,3.0,,"It has a very nice night view up on top.
However when we walked from garden by the bay to sky park, there was no signs as in where and how to go to the sky park. Therefore we had to wander around and asked some people before finding the entrance."
,,Fair,3.0,,"Spectacular view but entrance fee is not competitive comparing to what you will get. If you want to see Singapore top view, I recommended you to select neither here of Singapore Flyer. Only one is ok."
,,the views...,5.0,,"want to get a birds eye view of Singapore then this is the way to do it.breath taking,amazing view of everything,the city,the ships at sea,indonesia...just fantastic. ken"
,,what a view,5.0,,the view is so incredible from skypark good to go when its not so hot because then can't stand there for long and enjoy the city view from top
,,Great Lunch at SKY on 57,5.0,,"Loved the Business Lunch at SKY on 57, as they have a good range of Wines and you have a wonderful view."
,,It is worth going to,5.0,,It is worth going to But notice your ticket is only for one enter. when we goes to the sky Bar at 57 floor and coming back to the sky deck at 56 floor they told us you are enter before and this ticket is only for one enter and did not let us to enter.
,,Just another skyscraper in another city.,1.0,,"Over rated skyscraper with a very ridiculous looking boat like structure atop
Centre filled with expensive stores and not much else at night one waits for an advertised light spectacular ! Well it's not quite that is -10 minutes of laser lights - quite ordinary really"
,,Great views,5.0,,"If you have the chance, you must visit the Skypark. We were guests at MBS so access was fairly easy. But it was well worth the visit to take in the views of Singapore from this location."
,,Nice View,4.0,,"If you like to see the view of Gardens by the bay, Esplanade, Merlion Park, Singapore flyer and etc, from the top then then try this one.."
,,Lunch at cie la vie,3.0,,Three of us had the 3 course lunch at $38++. Average food and very small amount. The brewed black coffee was sourish
,,"Lovely place, unforgettable place , so romantic, so peaceful , so modern , but expensive , with high quality services",5.0,,"Lovely place, unforgettable place , so romantic, so peaceful , so modern , but expensive , with high quality services"
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,Amazing venue for a sundowner or just to admire the view of Singapore from 56 floors high! Cost involved to go up to the Skypark is worth it but we declined an expensive photograph.
,,A beautiful view and a chilled atmosphere,5.0,,The view from Marina Bay is a must see in Singapore next to the Flyer. You will love the scenery and the breathtaking view over one of the most modern and technological cities in the world.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,We went up to Marina Bay as part of our night tour of Singapore this part gave you 360 degree views of Singapore beautiful night and was spectacular.
,,in heaven,5.0,,"this hotel is staggering, so much to do inside cafe,s shops bars and so much more, but expencive. access to viewing area on top of hotel cost 25 sgd, but once up there the view is breath taking swimming pool bars and beautiful to walk round."
,,HIGH light,5.0,,We saw this when we were watching the Grand Prix by the Bay. So the next day it was a long walk and 57 floors to the viewing deck where we had drinks and admired the specticle that is Singapore.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,"A great place where everyone must visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The view of Singapore was very awesome and service are great.
Mahd Nazri (Guest Attendant) was bubbly and friendly, had a small talk and he even explained to us that the lift will take only 35secs to reach to 56 floor. We were impressed by his service although it was a short time.
The garden view was superb and we had the pool view from the Ce La Vie bar.
Will be back to Singapore and will plan to stay with Marina Bay Sands.
We enjoyed every single moment in Singapore."
,,Good view of Collyer Quay & Merlion & Fullerton hotel,3.0,,"Visit here in the evening and enjoy the view as the sun set. It's nice too, when it turns dark and lights are on for Fullerton Hotel."
,,Go at night,3.0,,"We went there at night to see Singapore at night. They charge 23$sin for entrance, and except a ride on the elevator you get absolutely nothing, there isn't even a bench to sit on, so people sit on the floor.
The only good thing is the beautiful view.
BTW they try to rip you off with a photoshopped picture, don't fall for it"
,,Aha View,5.0,,"View is super heavenly. If you are in Singapore, this is a must visit destination. Imagine great cuisine served & you raising toasts with your friends."
,,Worthy place to be,5.0,,"Even though is a expensive place in my opinion I prefer to spend money here than the flyer, there is a spectacular view and is a particular and recognized architectural work in the world...a Singapore landmark"
,,Crowded and Expensive,3.0,,The view was really great. Make sure you go during sunset for an even better experience. It's vey expensive though. You basically spend $25SGD to rid up an elevator and hang out on a deck with too many other tourists and you will spend $14 on a beer.
,,Wonderful - must do!,5.0,,"This is a must do when in Singapore. Yes it's pricey, but you certainly remember the experience. My friend who came to Singapore with me, decided to give this a miss because of the price, and she was gutted afterwards when looking at the photos. You can see for miles. I went up during the day, and the views were amazing. I should imagine they're even better at night/sunset when everything is being lit up. If I ever visit the city again, I would gladly do it again! Also great if you're in your scruffs, as I were, as they don't have a dress code. I was in shorts and flip flops as I was waiting for a late flight, and had no problems going up."
,,Great place,4.0,,Good place to have a visit. U can all nationality people over here. All major premium brands shops are available here.
,,WOW! Not to be missed.,5.0,,"I am pretty sure that the Skypark offers the best views of/in Singapore! Tickets aren't cheap and the access is limited for visitors who are not staying in the hotel (you only get access to the rounded end of the 'deck' - hotel guests get the full experience - including the infinity pool).

If you plan to go for drinks, book a table at C'est La Vie which opens at 12noon and use the correct lift. You only get access to the bar (inside and outside areas including a smoking area) but the view is just as good - in fact it is situated just above the public deck. Bring your wallet and expect it to be hammered, but if you want cocktails up there anyway, this will save you the enterance fee to the observation deck."
,,Pricey But Worth the View,4.0,,"Many people think you need to stay in the hotel to get to the top of the Skypark, but you can actually take the elevators to the top and go the resturant, bar, and view areas. There will be a few spots that you will need a hotel room key for access to some private viewing areas for guests, but the other areas where anyone can go are just about as good as the ones guests enjoy. So don't let that stop you from coming to see the view, which is free if you just want a good photo opportunity. For our group we spent a few hours on the rooftop listening to music, at a bar top table and had some cocktails. Just a heads up the most inexpensive beer or cocktail to purchase begins $25 SGD on upwards to just go with an open mind expecting to pay for a pricey meal and drinks because you are there for the view. That is what makes the experience worth-while. You can see for miles, and the water views of the Bay are stunning day or night. The Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel are in plain sight so there are so many things to see and take great photos from the top of the rooftop bars. If you want to have food, i Highly recommend making a reservation as even really late at night the place was packed. Oh, and dress up, it was definitely a place to be seen and sort of reminded me of Vegas, Miami, Paris, etc."
,,Wow what a view,5.0,,"Well I do hate highlights
And this place is exactly that
However it is very restrictive to where you can be this hotel is not really interested in public looking at the top view because it is for this paying st least $SIN 600.00 plus once the majority of Chinese guest spanning day and night in the casino"
,,Stunning views!,5.0,,A superb place to have a cocktail or two!! Really enjoyed the live music and breeze at the top of this stunning building!
,,Its a must,5.0,,"The 20 SGD as entrance is deducted from your bar bill, for me this is just fair and the rates are abolutely reasonable for that spectacular view over Singapore. Just the Mojito is not worth it - stay with Beer :-)"
,,"Great views of Singapore, especially at night.",4.0,,"My wife and I visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark in early September. It was a Saturday night and lots of people were out and about, so there was a queue to get into the lifts to go up and a long queue to take the lifts back down again. Keep that in mind if you have a tight time frame. The almost 360 degree views are quite spectacular and it is well worth a visit."
,,Go to one of the skybars instead,2.0,,"Rather than paying entry to just enjoy the view, consider going up to the Ce La Vie bar (free entry) and grabbing a drink there to take in the spectacular views."
,,Great view of Singapore with nice ambience,4.0,,The view from Top was great. Seating was comfortable and food served was excellent. service of the staff was prompt and helpful;
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Go have a fantastic set Munch or dinner in this Amazing restaurant in 57th floor! Fantastic views over Singapore, pricy bur worth it!"
,,View of Singapore from another perspective,5.0,,A must go place. You can see a 360 view from here. Almost all of the Singapore can be seen from here. Huge hotel with a infinity pool and large observation deck.
,,Holiday,5.0,,The Marina is great place with all the first class shopping to be done .There is a food court that is good with all types of food there and a wax skating rink for the kids and adults to try.The sky park is great views around Singapore and looking down on a floating soccer pitch $10 to go up to the top to view this. But good.
,,Deserving of its praise,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a place you definitely need to visit when you are around Singapore. The view is as extravagant as the country. If you have the opportunity to check in, the infinity pool is a must-see attraction, overlooking the beauty of Singapore."
,,OMG What a view,5.0,,"My friend and I were lucky enough to stay at the hotel (so we could go how ever many times we wanted), but once up there, what a view!!! You got to see pretty much a 360 degree view of the city skyline, to the ships docked at sea, to being next to pretty much the Singapore Flyer. You were able to have a drink there and something to eat too. I loved it being a plane spotter, as I got to see all these planes coming and going out of the airport. For the ultimate view of the city, HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
,,Dinner @ Spago,5.0,,Visited in July with the Mrs for our anniversary. Had dinner at Spago by Wolfgang Puck. Beautiful views and wonderful dinner.
,,Magnificent,5.0,,These building are amazing. Stunning when you are close to them and majestic from a distance. It's a must visit.
,,go there at nights,5.0,,"For a great view with less people around, go there at night. Walk by the hotel and shopping, pass over the highway and reach the end of the park. Many corners you will find to sit, take pictures and walk. You can take stroller all the way up there, using lift and escalator."
,,Amazing building,5.0,,"It is absolutely essential to take the lift to the 57th floor of this stunning building, have a drink in the lovely bar and walk round the terrace drinking the wonderful views."
,,Bucket list tick.,4.0,,"Bit of a process and some military style marching to get up to top but worth it, great views, tucker was good but on the Exxy side as you would expect from such a significant landmark, back to back visits for us."
,,Great view from the Ce La Vie Skybar,4.0,,One of the best ways to get a great view across Singapore city is to head to the Skybar which is accessed by the lifts at the eastern end of the building. Just say at the reception desk that you are going up for a drink at the bar and you're good to go. Of course you will have to buy a drink which are not cheap but if you going to go up there anyway you may as well pay for a drink rather that pay for access only to the Observation deck.
,,Incredible,5.0,,"Even as you walk up to it it will take your breath away, stunning architecture, take ride to 57th Sky bar, expensive drinks but the views of the city are well worth it Nothing more to say other than you have to visit"
,,Making the most of the Skypark,4.0,,"My tip is to plan on getting to the Skypark around 6.30pm. Take a leisurely walk around, taking in the magnificent view (don't waste your money on the Flyer, this is so much better) and then buy yourself a drink and watch the sunset at 6.50. Watch as the lights come on all over the city and the view changes completely. At 7.45 make sure you are on the Gardens by the Bay side to have pole position for the light show at Supertree Grove. This goes for 15 minutes, cross over to the other side of the Skypark and watch the light show at the front of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Kill 3 birds with 1 stone all for the cost of the Skypark admission."
,,Lazer delight at night,5.0,,"Went here for a walk daily in the evening you can shop, eat, walk, catch your Pokemon and watch a lazer show take as long or little walk. Ample places to sit or drink. Took some beautiful pictures here in the evening of the financial centre, Marina bay sands hotel, water, boats etc most enjoyable"
,,An awesome experience,5.0,,It was myv3rd time to this property. I just do not feel enough with it - every time it continue to amaze me.
,,Amazing place for full city night view,5.0,,"You are on the 57th floor, a park on above of three building,can see whole city view at night full of lights. Buildings,oceans, park and many more. Cannot explain in words"
,,Definitely an experience you couldn't do elsewhere,5.0,,Where in the world can you go to see the infinity pool on 57th floor? It's definitely an experience you don't want to miss if you visiting Sinagpore. The view on 57th floor is breath taking. Singapore has a beautiful skyline. A suggestion is to go later in the day so it's not too hot. You might want to plan a visit to a few restaurant up there for high tea or sunset drink.
,,Good.... But not great....,4.0,,"It is an iconic location. The hotel rightly gives preference to its guests as to access to areas with the best views. Otherwise, a nice place, unique experience in Singapore and a bucket list check off."
,,"Great view...incredible heights, VERY expensive drinks",4.0,,"First time in Singapore for Mum after 55 years and we were in transit for just a few hours....so this was one of theft ring things we did on this night. It is a wonderful view and worth the money to go up and take a look....you can stroll at your leisure around what amounts to about one-third of the total deck area...the rest is reserved for Hotel Guests only....

We bought the viewing deck ticket about 9pm....working out later that we could have gone up a floor....to 57..for no charge, and bought a drink there...and enjoyed the view for free...
But this does not allow you any access at all to the public viewing deck. Also it was $23 for adult entry to the deck...and $24 ++ for a simple spirit and soda drink...

We decided it was a good nighttime view...and worth the money to see the view from the skylark at least once.

On a future occasion, having now been there once...we might decide just to go to the 57th floor and have a drink. The elevator and reception/ticketing staff were incredibly friendly...one even offering to take our photo. We were very happy to accept the offer...and enjoyed our visit."
,,"Great hotel,",4.0,,"This is an amazing complex, hotels, restaurants, bards and specialty shops. The roufetop bar and Rests are amazingly beautiful. It is pricy, but worth a every penny. Rooms are great, and views are fantastic.."
,,Fabulous views in all directions,5.0,,This was included in our stay at Marine Bay Sands and really was amazing. The restaurant was great as were he pool and jacuzzis.
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,Fantastic views of the city from the 57th floor. Great for photographs. When there also visit the nearby bar for a coffee or a cocktail. Don't leave Singapore without visiting here.
,,Breathtaking views to enjoy,4.0,,The views of the Singapore skyline are spectacular. Make sure you choose a clear day and try to time your visit in the late afternoon so that you get to enjoy both daytime and nighttime views.
,,Great view,5.0,,"Excellent views across Singapore. Good location for a drink/meal with the outstanding scene, albeit pricey."
,,Wow. Take a look.,5.0,,Breakfast is 8.30 to 11.00. After this time you can travel up to the 54th floor via tower 2 and take a secont lift to 57th floor.
,,Review of MBS,5.0,,"If you want a good view of Singapore go on Marina Bay Sands either to Skypark or bar to get marvelous view of the city. Best time will be late evening, try and catch day light as well as night view. Skypark will cost S$ 23 whereas in bar you can buy a beer under $ 20 and still enjoy the view while sipping beer. That's my choice."
,,Stunning but expensive views! :),3.0,,"The views at the top of the observation deck are simply stunning, especially at night. However, it does cost a rather expensive 23 Singapore Dollars to get to the top for an attraction you could easily complete in just 15 minutes. Therefore, if you do decide to go I'd advise milking the views for all they are worth and maybe bring a small picnic to enjoy while you take in the breathtaking Singapore city scenery.

The observation deck is open 9.30am to 10pm from Mondays to Thursdays and 9.30am to 11pm from Fridays to Sundays. I would recommend purchasing a ticket and heading up to the observation deck just before the Wonder Full showtimes, which is Southeast Asia's largest light and water show. I saw the one at 8pm (there's another one at 9.30pm and an additional 11pm one from Fridays to Saturdays) and was impressed by the colourful water sprouts and laser effects.

I managed to get some awesome looking night scenery photos of the Singapore Flyer, Gardens By The Bay and of the city skyline so definitely remember to bring your camera with you for some fantastic photo opportunities! :)"
,,Best Vantage point of the City,4.0,,Great view of the city! It's especially beautiful to catch the Sunset or the night lights of the city.
,,Conference,5.0,,Very expensive but worth a look from the roof of the Marina Bay Sands to see the Singapore landscape at night
,,Fabulous Spago,5.0,,"Visited Spago twice in a three day visit. Great bar/restaurant, fabulous food and warm, professional staff. A must do"
,,Great views but very busy,4.0,,Well worth the visit. 57th floor.drinks are expensive. Views of Singapore are great. The night light show is worthy of a visit. Can be very crowded.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"The concierge at our hotel recommended we visit the Skypark and sold us tickets (at same price as buying them at Marina Bay Sands but he said it would avoid us queueing). We got there about 9.30am and there were actually no queues anyway. Very fast lift to the top and we were then on the observation deck (the end of the 'boat' on the top of the three towers). It was good to go early as not too hot as yet. The view was amazing and very well worth $23. Would highly recommend this as something you 'must do' while in Singapore, and it's near the two domes which are also incredible and worth visiting, so ideal to do all in the one day."
,,"Superb Location to see the Gardens, Bay and City",5.0,,"Since we're in Singapore and saw this building on the TV Show 'Megastructures', thought we should visit!

We enquired to go the Skypark and to get to the top was $23 adults and $17 for children. The is a small area that could be visited. For the price, decided it wasn't worth it! So proceeded elsewhere. Got to the lobby and there was an option to visit the skybar and restaurant - charge $20 adults and no charge for the kids. The $20 could be used towards any food and drink purchases. We visited on a Sunday, so the dress was casual, however other days the dress is smart casual so keep that in mind.

Well it was worth it! We had a couple
of drinks whilst taking in the skyline and scenes of Singapore from this megastructure.

Level 57!

Overall worth the visit and glad we found the second option to get to the top!"
,,architecturally stunning,5.0,,Cost 5 billion to build the hotel in just 3 years. great views from the roof top bar and restaurant. Stomach churning lift-velocity to get you tehre
,,A Must See,5.0,,We chose just to visit the observation deck which is a different entrance and cost from the restaurant and bar. We really enjoyed the views at dusk and the breeze was delightful. We didn't have very long lines and they're pretty efficient about getting everyone into and off of the elevators.
,,Stunning views,5.0,,We went up and had a drink. $20 a person to go up but you can put the $20 towards a drink at the top. Around $50 for two people to have a drink but the view is great and the drinks were good as well! Yolo
,,The best view of singapore,5.0,,"Quite simply an architecturally amazing looking building with the best view of Singapore from the top. The cost to get to the Skypark was S$26 per person, but the view is worth the money. You don't get access to all the top deck, just the observation area. You must be a hotel guest to use the pool and restaurants. Nevertheless the view is spectacular and well worth the money."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,A must visit modern architectural marvel in Singapore.Amazing views of the entire city from this sky deck.Must visit place when in Singapore.Time ur visit just before twilight to get the best view with and without lights of the city.
,,Stunning View,5.0,,"Dropped in for a drink to the 57th floor sky bar at11pm, stunning views over bay, definitely a must see if you are in Singapore. Pool area is also fantastic."
,,"shop, shop, shop,",5.0,,Amazing shopping for top class purchases and the food mall had everything. Try the freshly mad fruit and vegetable smoothies
,,GREAT VIEWS FROM THE 56TH FLOOR,5.0,,We went up to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to take in the glorious 360 degrees views of Singapore City and the shipping roads beyond. The floor is a favourite Singapore viewing point and there were a number of people there soaking in the sights. We were surpised to see scores of ships out in the shipping roads towards Indonesia.
,,Great view,4.0,,No denying it is a fantastic view of Singapore and would recommend you take the time. We head to the bar to take in a drink and view. Worth doing even at the price and can also domthe Marina Bay Sands shipping mall which is pretty incredible note food court is very good.
,,view the grandprix track from above,4.0,,It was a view to see! BUT be warned you cannot sit anywhere and enjoy it! standing only which was disapointing especially if it is a warm day. the Grandprix was on their practice laps so that was good to have an aerial view! The ice cream I ate was melted and fell to pieces as soon as I tore it open .
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"You can either go to the rooftop bar and have a drink and some food, or pay to access the viewing platform on the level below the bar. As anyone knows us will tell you it was always going be the bar! Prices were surprisingly no more expensive than our hotel bar but the view was far, far better. Worth it for the view across the marina, sea and across the city. Good atmosphere and great views across the infinity pool for the residents as well."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"This is must when visiting Singapore - magnificent views, great food and drink also you can see the infinity pool. Go, go."
,,Top of world,5.0,,We went there on national day of Singapore and it was a full house. We stayed from sunset to night and loved to be there. The hotel and skypark are different. So be careful
,,Awesome sunset view,5.0,,Expensive but worth a visit. The sunset was spectacular and the view was amazing. Nice place to hang out for a drink after a busy day at work. Worth a visit.
,,Amazing Experience ...,5.0,,"Skypark MBS very crowded last time i went there .. but thats fine, thats family time at the pool .. so the atmosphere is combine between Elegant Cafe & Resto, Amazing View of Singapore and Warm like family .. good combination .."
,,I could reach to the sky...,5.0,,"If you don't visit here, your travel is incomplete.. I must say it was the best part of my trip.. I wish we would have stayed in their hotel so that we could have use their pool as well. U can get the beautiful view of sea, gardens by the bay. It was very hot in the afternoon but I was so so happy that i couldn't feel it."
,,Superb skyline of singapore,5.0,,A swimming pool set on top of marina bay sands. Drinks and food easily available. Capturing Singapore's skyline while swimming is just fantastic. Photo taking galore place especially at night. Need to pay to go up if you are not a guest.
,,Too expensive with little to offer,2.0,,"The views down below was great (so 2 points) ... but other than that, there's NOTHING on the patio or inside the tower. For the sky towers in other cities, there are little shops and other exhibits.... We made the mistake of going there at noon, which was the most sunny time of the day. Everyone who went there at the time (including our family) could not stand the heat and head to leave after 20 minutes. So do not go there when it's sunny or bring an umbrella! Also, there's no access to the infinity pool unless if you are a guest at Marina Bay."
,,A HIghlight of Singapore,5.0,,We had been told about a restaurant on the 57th floor of Tower Number 3 that offered a spectacular view with excellent food. The restaurant is Ce La Vi and it was a great choice on both parts. Our lunch cost $125 SIN as opposed to $28 SIN @ to visit the Sky deck one level below. It is definitely worth the cost.
,,Spectacular View!,5.0,,"A must stop in Singapore. The view is amazing and the architecture is amazing. The entire city for that fact is amazing but this Hotel is unique and definitely stands out. It's a busy place, but the minute you get there your looking up, down and around. Once you get upon the Skypark the view is stunning!!!"
,,Rather expensive but a must,5.0,,"We came there in the evening and couldn't find the right entrance first but when you're up there, you may easily forget everything and just enjoy yourselves. The entrance fee is a bit pricey but it's worth it, the view is amazing."
,,Mariner sands,5.0,,"This was excellent we purchased the photo if us taken upon entering which was printed by the time we got to 56th floor he wanted $50 but we haggled and got it for $30
Amazing views super expensive $47 for 2 x beers on 57th floor but views are out of this world"
,,Magnificent building,3.0,,"Magnificent building with a fantastic view, staff not very friendly, price of food and drinks is ridiculously expensive. There are other roof top bars / restaurants in Singapore with great views friendly staff as well as reasonably priced food and drinks."
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,It is a must see place in Singapor offering 360* degrees views towards the city and harbour. Highly recommended.
,,Plenty to see & do & great views from the top!,4.0,,Plenty bars & restaurants & cafes in this huge complex. Well worth looking around. .. awesome views from the top - it's a pity the infinity pool is only accessible to residents though!
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to be staying at the hotel, so ducked over to the Skypark one afternoon.

It is amazing to be standing there, 56 floors up, with the most amazing views. There is a nice little open café up there, able to have a Singapore Sling or other drinks.

Its just an amazing piece of architecture - and to be standing up there is a must do experience."
,,A boat on top of 3 buildings - amazing,4.0,,"This is an amazing site - a building shaped like a boat on top of 3 towers. One of the towers is the Sands hotel resort. The boat at the top has a pool, bars and restaurants and a viewing walkway (only open to residents of the hotel).
We were not resident but managed to find our way up to the top (only 1 lift goes up for non-residents - floor 57). We had a cocktail in the bar with amazing views over the city - crazy price but worth going up."
,,While Away Some Time,5.0,,A lovely way to spend some time soaking up the views. Accommodated our vegan lifestyle with a few snack items. Fabulous.
,,A must to do,5.0,,Did this at night to overlook Singapore and was not disappointed at all. Great views of the city and it is on the 56 floor of the building and the gardens of the bay view with the flower domes and towers lit up amazing.
,,Great fun!,5.0,,"Fun couple of hours here drinking chilled Pinot Grigio and munching onion rings and edamame beans. Spectacular views, friendly staff and no cover charge if you're having a drink. A great way to spend a couple of hours in Singapore."
,,Great Views but Opt for the Bar Option,4.0,,"Seems like everyone makes this one of their ""must do"" visits in Singapore.

I went up and did enjoy the view but felt the experience was overpriced. I enjoyed the Singapore Flyer much more and I had better views.

Still, how often do you get to visit a ship on top of three skyscrapers?"
,,Great views,5.0,,We entered the pub ce la vu for a plank of meats and cheese and a beer and cocktail. Still able to see the views of singapore.
,,Great View!,4.0,,"Yes....This is a little expensive, but most things are in Singapore. The 360 degree view is fantastic. A great view overlooking the city, harbor and Gardens By The Bay. You can spend as much (or little) time as you like there. You can also stop for a quick bite to eat and a nice cool drink. (Make sure you have plenty of $$ though)"
,,Wow the views!!!,5.0,,Durning the day you can see everything. And at night the skyline is just breath taking!! Must visit the top!!
,,Just come for casino,3.0,,Come here for gambling at casino..it have a big malls with a lot of restaurants and shops.. it have a casini..i think the casinobis better thn genting.
,,Pool at skypark was interesting.,4.0,,"Pool at skypark had lots of people enjoying the city view and taking pictures at 57 level. Pool mostly full in afternoon, need to go in the morning."
,,Leisurely walk,5.0,,It is Singapore - clean and orderly. It's nice to walk there and see the CBD by the waterfront. There's also a big mall if that's to your liking.
,,Expensive for just a view,3.0,,"There is very little on the viewing platform. However, the view is fantastic and gives you another perspective of Singapore. Having said this, the signs explaining the view are in Chinese and the souvenir shop is expensive. We did not go to the restaurant that is there. Like the cruise ships that take your photo at the lift and it is ready by the time you get to the 56 floor. 50Sing Dollars. Too expensive for my taste but it is presented in a nice folder."
,,Not worth the cost,2.0,,"A rather steep fee to get access to a corner of the top of Marina Bay Sands. You get an 180-degree view off one end, but overall its a quick visit. Consider other ways to get to the top of this impressive building."
,,Awesome !!!,5.0,,"Marine bay sands skylark is the best attraction of Singapore . Once you reach top , it's has whole view of Singapore . Awesome place to visit !!!"
,,Lovely view of downtown Singapore,4.0,,"Found the entrance to the top a little bit of a problem, but once up to the top, really good, we had a glass of beer and champagne with some bits and pieces to eat, expensive but had to be done!"
,,Nice view of Singapore .,5.0,,Nice view ! Nearby attraction are Garden by the bay and Singapore flyer. Just ride the blue line MRT line to bay front . You can go to the casino to try your luck and taster the food too :)
,,Nice way to end a day,5.0,,You get the perfect sunset from the restaurant on the rooftop. Drinks and food is very nice. I cannot think of a better way to end a day.
,,Super sunset,5.0,,Go to the bar it is not that expensive by UK city standards. We had a beer a gin and the sharing cheese board and watched the sun go down over the straits. Then walked through the hotel and over the walkway to the gardens for the music showv enjoyable
,,Great views,3.0,,"As people have stated previously, the views here were amazing, but $33 during GP time is a bit steep."
,,Its Popular for a reason,5.0,,"This is probably the most iconic attraction in the Lion City now day or night.

Take the lift to level 57 and you can access the end of the Skypark for a fee. Its worth a look day or night although its not as spectacular as other's like KLCC etc.

They is also a small from area up there via the lift if you can find it."
,,Serenity,5.0,,You really feel on top of the world when you go to the skypark. This was the best time and you can also have a Singapore Sling.
,,Not impressed,5.0,,My issue with over hyped Marina bay sands is similar to the Venetian. They are an organised mess. it was too much of a hotch botch. Casino was filled with random bystanders. I could not see privacy for the guests staying up.
,,Great structure,4.0,,It takes 30 sections by lift to reach the 57th floor. Which is the top floor . It's free . You can enjoy the view of Singapore from that height.
,,Amazing skyline of Singapore,5.0,,By far the most memorable Singapore experience is the Skypark and watching the fireworks. The elevator to the 56 floor takes you in just 30-40 sec. Must visit place in Singapore.
,,For The Best skyline view of Sg,5.0,,A meeting place in high altitudes.. a model for other countries to go for a viable Hotel Business..!! Enjoyed the Sun Set and evening laser shows from so close to the sky.. a must visit place for skyline lovers..
,,1 Altitude is better,3.0,,"You go there just to say that you were on the top of the MBS, nothing else, the 1Altitude bar offers better view and drinks"
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"Visited Marina Bay skybar in august, 2014 . Absolutely amazing place to visit. It is the tallest building in Singapore with an amazing view of Singapore's famous skyline, gardens by the bay and Singapore Flyer. Must visit."
,,Better off going the bar as its free and buying a beer - Cheaper than the ticket,3.0,,"Few issues around this place

You can get to the view for free via the 2 bar areas - when you come out of the lift go left towards the bar next to the pool - the other bar we were pressured to go to has poor views and not a good feel

The bar near the pool gives excellent views of the marina and also the pool - not many seats to you may have to stand around

Drinks are good and price wise cheaper than the ticket

Only draw back is you do not get the view of the gardens by the bay but the city view is more impressive

A must do, but better to buy a drink and see the pool area

You cannot enter the pool which is understandable and good that they limit it to hotel guests"
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,"This is a fantastic, neat and clean place, you can enjoy a fresh air, central lake view is amazing, I would always like to visit this place."
,,Beautiful view from the top.,5.0,,"Its worthy to go on the top. We went around 6 p.m and able to see day view and night view. Night view was stunning very colourful with lights. Such a lovely day. Gardens by the bay lights was seen by the top. All good and worthy but only sad feeling was we were not allowed to go near swimming pool, its only for the guest use. Its fair enough."
,,Looks great but,3.0,,"Because we were there the Grand Prix weekend the $23 ride to the top floor was $33 now that is a surchage.
You couldn't sit in the bar and chill you were out in the sun on a lower platform.
Great views but not a great experience"
,,its worth it,5.0,,"to some people this hotel might be expansive or of their budget range but from my visit to this super great hotel and my experience there I ask u to stay in this hotel even for 1 night coz there are allot of thing u can do great view from each room allot of activities for adults and kids plus the famous Skypak its like a magical place u wont even believe
what u see until u see it ur self"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We only had the afternoon. So had to go up in the day time. But I think I would much prefer to see the skyline at night. I was a little under whelmed as one of the best things in the skyline it's the thing your stood on. However the financial district and the views over the gardens are stunning. To go up to the viewing deck is quite expensive. It is worth booking a lunch or drinks if you have time.
,,Amazing building with an Amazing view,4.0,,"We pre-purchased our tickets and paid S$23 per adult. For this you just get access to a rooftop viewing platform. We went late afternoon so we could see the view in daylight just as dusk was setting in and all the lights were coming on. It is incredibly high - not for those with phobias, that's for sure! But the views across the harbour and across the city were not to be missed. Great photo opportunity. But that's about all that is up there. There is a little food stall with drinks and nibbles and there is access to a couple of restaurants but they are rather pricey. Better idea to book the restaurant and you get up to the skydeck as part of the booking."
,,Overpriced,1.0,,"Went to Skypark during grand prix weekend normally $23 but inflated to a whopping $33. The main plaque in the wall had the normal price the new price only on a note on the ticket desk. The staff were coping well with many saying how bad this was.
Don't these people realise the cost of getting to Singapore and the grand prix ticket is very expensive last thing we need is overpriced attractions
We didn't go up there is little platform to explore and the Singapore flyer gives just as good a view"
,,Worth doing for at least 1 night,4.0,,"Beautiful hotel that, while very expensive, especially F1 weekend, is worth staying at for at least one night and experiencing the L57 roof top pool alone. Family suite was great, couple of minor issues that shouldn't occur in this type of hotel thought, VIP check...More"
,,Very beautiful view,5.0,,We was during the night and the view was espectacular and very strange feeling when you imagine that you are on such a high flor and there is no building support below you
,,"Nice view, bit pricey",3.0,,"If you want a good view over Singapore this is a great spot. However, once up there the things to do are limited, including food. There is no access to the hotel restaurant, or swimming pool, which while somewhat understandable is one of the reasons...More"
,,Expensive,2.0,,The view from the roof was ok but at $25 dollars each it was expensive. It's only the tip of the roof so you don't get to see the roof garden or pool which is very disappointing.
,,Speechless!!!,5.0,,"I paid 33 sgd, Its located in the top of marina bay sands. U can take a lots of pictures. I choose a cloudy day and they were about 15 people so i had all the possible views. There is a restaurant on top,"
,,Expensive,4.0,,The viewing deck isn't massive and the little bar up there is obviously over priced. Views are brilliant though. Unfortunately you can't walk all the way across due to the packed infinity pool only used by guests. I'd say go to ce la vie at...More
,,Wonderful view from Skypark,4.0,,I went to Marina Bay Sands Skypark in September 16 and the time is about 5 PM. So I can enjoy both day and night view from the skypark.
,,This is a must,5.0,,"The best view in Singapore, no need to book in advance, they just close if raining. We have been during day and we like so much that we went to restaurant and enjoy it also from there."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Very nice surroundings was A bit disappointed as you only have a small viewing deck, however the views are very nice"
,,spectacular views,5.0,,"great expericence, going here in the evening for a drink and seeing the views over the beautiful city"
,,Beautiful View,1.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands after our day at Gardens By The Bay, took the elevator to the 57th floor and went into the bar for a drink. The hostess was very welcoming, took our order and invited us to walk around and enjoy the view. No pretensions and no feeling that we were out of place. Be aware that drinks are a little pricey, but hey, you're on holidays!"
,,Oh. My. GOD!!!,5.0,,"I went to Singapore at F1 season and everywhere was more expensive than normal, also Skypark is normally $23 but I paid $33. But it worths every penny! I loved the view of Singapore, took so many precious photos. The sky was so clear but it was so hot. There were no where that you could sit or no shadow. That's the only con that I can say. The Mbs is spectacular enough and going up there is crrazzzzy!!"
,,"Magical view of Singapore marina, architure, lighting shows and city.",5.0,,Awesome view from either end of building. Went up Tower 3 to deck with a night tour group which included a cost for access in July and then up Tower 1 in Sptember to a restaurant with no cost to get there.
,,Amazing view and ambience,5.0,,"Go to Ce La Vie - even if it is just for one drink at the bar. You will save the money you will otherwise pay to visit the observation deck and the bar is one flight higher. Win, win...."
,,Marina bay sands what a buzz,5.0,,What an experience. It was certainly well woeth 23 singapore dollars to catch the lift to the 59th floor observation deck of this amazing structure. The views from the viewing deck make you really appreciate what a wonderful city Singapore is.
,,night time views-amazing!,5.0,,"Standing on the boat at the top pf the marina bay sands hotel and looking out over Singapore, you feel like you are on top of the world. The best time to go would be for sunset & night time views of singapore. There is a charge to go to the top & there can be a queue for the lifts to go up & come back down (there are only 3). It can be quite busy as everyone wants photos of the views."
,,YOU MUST GO TO SKYPARK!,5.0,,"The best day we had was when we were at Marina bay Skypark. There is a fee but it is worthwhile. No limit to how long you can stay. Go there during sunset, to view day/ sunset and night view! Beautiful views! LOVED IT"
,,Great view,4.0,,The observation deck gives a great view of city and a place where you and your family can take plenty of pictures or selfies with Singapore skyline in the background. The experience is not as impressive as visiting Burj Khalifa (Dubai) which gives you great experience as you enter the lift and insight into the design and construction of the building. Nevertheless the Skypark was a good visit.
,,A view to kill for,4.0,,For a stunning rooftop view of Singapore this is a must do and well worth the normal price however beware we did this on the F1 weekend and got slugged an extra $ 10 per person
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"You pay $24 to go up to the viewing area and it is well worth the money, you cant go near the pool area but you can see it from the viewing area. there are views of the whole of Singapore from the top.
There is no shade so take a hat and sunnies."
,,Best bird's eyeview of SG,5.0,,Best bird's eyeview of Singapore from the top of Marina Bay Sands (MBS). They have the infinity pool at the top floor.
,,Beautiful Views,4.0,,"Great place to see the city skyline and enjoy a cocktail on the deck on the 57 th floor, especially at sunset. There is a ""boat"" on top of the hotel! Beautiful architecture. High prices but worth doing once. Easy to get to on the MRT."
,,Singapore GP,4.0,,"Spent 3 hours getting some day then night photos of the 2016 Singapore Grand Prix. Looked for a different perspective than track side. Was surprised to find it not that busy at all. Clear night, great fun."
,,Singapore's Most Famous Hotel and Casino,5.0,,The Marina Sands is by far the most iconic and amazing building to experience in Singapore! The Skypark is obviously perched on top of three massive skyscrapers which are the hotel complex. The top deck of the Skypark features an exquisite landscaped park with foliage and a fantastic swimming pool where visitors can swim at the edge with frightening vertigo views of the city below. Non guests of the hotel must pay a fee to ride the elevator up to the topof the Skypark and then access is limited only to a certain area of the deck. But the panormaic views are worth the price and it was an exciting life experience for us to enjoy there!
,,Amazinig Place and View!,5.0,,"What else can you say! If you don't suffer from vertigo this is a must! The views are amazing! I wish we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and were able to use the infinity pool. Instead we had a wonderful view of Marina Bay Sands from out hotel room, which was not bad either."
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"My boyfriend and I went there in our first day in Singapore. We went by the end of the afternoon which was a great hour to visit, since we could see the view with light and the sunset.
We bought popcorn and a beer - although it was unnecessarily expensive.
A must do!"
,,Wonderful sky high view of Singapore skyline,5.0,,"Iconic building with swimming pool overlooking the city. An experience found nowhere else in the Asia or the world! Safe and secure environment atop a monumental building . Cleverly conceived, outstanding!"
,,See the SAME view for a fraction of the price!,5.0,,"OK , I wasn't going to pay $23 per adult and $17 for my child ($63$ total) to go up to see the view so here's how I got the same view much cheaper!

1) The entrance to Skypark and Ce Le Vie bar/restaurant are near eachother. The Skypark is outside the main lobby entrance through a glass door to the right. Escalators take you down. You don't want this! The Ce Le Vie bar is what we want. Go into the hotel lobby (the one with the sports cars oustide), to the left of the Skypark glass doors entrance, and the Ce Le Vie entrance is immediately RIGHT. Someone will be there. Friendly of course like most Singpore folk.

2) Say you want to have a drink. They will let you go in the lift to the bar/restaurant. Remember it opens at 12PM. Now heres the fun bit! You use the SAME lift as those paying for the skypark! But you got in for FREE! HA HA! What made me laugh is that the lift has 4 buttons. The ground (where you get on), basement (where the skypark customers paying for expensive tickets get on), FLOOR 57, which is the Skypark, and FLOOR 58 which is the Ce le vie bar/restaurant, which is what you want. It is the same outdoor view both sides of the building.

3) Once you get off at 58, you can see the SAME marvelous view of Singapore and Gardens of the Bay just by buying some drinks.

We bought an iced tea, coke and some water for around $18. MUCH CHEAPER than the $63 the Skypark was going to cost! AND we had a seat, AND we had drinks!
You can also see the infinity pool but only guests can enter. We wasn't rushed either.

Hope this is helpful! Please save some money feel free to add thanks!
Thank you!"
,,day trip,5.0,,"If you go to skypark, you can skip the Singapore Flyer. The views will be almost the same. However, from the skypark you are viewing from an even higher level than the Flyer."

,,AMAZING VIEWS!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,We came for a cocktail recommended by friends but forget the cocktail--WHAT A VIEW!!! You can look over the whole city & just see how Singapore lives & breathes & it is pumping.Make this another MUST DO!!!
,,Pricey,4.0,,"You have to pay to get into the hotel and elevators and then you go to the rooftop and the view is spectacular. The price of the drinks are also spectacular. Worth going once, but only once."
,,Nice but expensive,3.0,,"I've been here three years ago and you could get up to the top for free enjoy the view and take a drink. The view is really nice and you can walk around the ship, so you get a 180 degree view. But for what it is, it is too expensive."
,,Absolute rip-off,1.0,,"There's no park in skypark! You pay through the nose to go to the top of the building, onto a small platform with no facilities, except a kiosk for refreshments. You're herded (and treated) like sheep within this, supposedly luxurious complex / hotel, since you're not a guest, but a visitor. The rest of the ""skypark"" is off-limits (guests only). As impressive as this building is to look at from a distance, it is equally disappointing to climb to its top. Remember, you're paying to see the view from 56th floor, not exactly a unique height. Singapore skyline will be equally available and impressive without this ridiculous rip-off. Avoid!"
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,Amazing views of the city and very delicious cocktails accompanied by lovely light lunch. Fun to see the infinity pool and everyone in it taking selfies haha
,,Amazing Building!,4.0,,"You can't go to Singapore without going to see the marina bay sands hotel as it is a stunning and 1 off piece of architecture!

When your at the bottom and look up it makes you think ""how DID they do that""?

A visit isn't complete with going up to the SkyPark...we went early morning and it was a good time as it wasn't busy at all...it was a perfect day and the views are amazing in all directions! You can view the bay/formula 1 track and many of the attractions from up high. It is reasonably priced and well worth a visit!

The one thing you have to go and see if in Singapore is the light show at the bay! The whole of the bay and marina bay sands hotel is lit up and it is well worth the visit...we went around 7pm which was perfect!!"
,,Beautiful design,3.0,,Came here to have a look. Although a superb bit of design we wouldn't stay here as it looked manic no personal service here full of very young Chinese and Indian teenagers who were rushing around all over the place. Glad we came and enjoyed the views but we will stick with shangri la for a more genteel pace and personal service.
,,Great hotel,5.0,,The room & view were great. Pool scarily packed. Quite strange policy on having to pay $100 for each additional room key. Casino was crowded but still ok.
,,A must do,5.0,,"This was a brilliant experience, free admission to the roof top bar... Be prepared for the prices for a beer however. Make sure you go dressed neat & tidy as you sort of get assessed before you get access to the lift."
,,"Most Visited, Happening place",5.0,,"I think you can spent half a day here comfortably ; its 'the' heart of the city, the marina bay (hotel) amaze you each time you visit it be it day or night. Faboulous a must go"
,,Panoramic view of the city skyline,5.0,,"Excellent place to view the whole of Singapore city day and night are different, it's best to go during the day and at night. The view is fantastic , able to see the Indonesian islands."
,,wow,5.0,,We did this during the day had great views all over was a little smoggy but still a great view ran out of time to do a night view
,,Fantastic Views of Singapore,5.0,,"A very worth while investment in going to this location. Only $35 an adult pensioners $20 and if you have a Singapore airlines 15% discount.
I went just as the sun was setting and stayed till after 8pm so I could see the lazer show.
The views were fantastic and to add to the enjoyment there was lots of lightning in the distance giving the city another dimension with the strikes in the background. The views down to the gardens when lit up and all the ships in the background just made the whole experience for my love of photography even more enjoyable.
All i can say to any visitor ""Just Do It""."
,,Breath taking views of Singapore city,5.0,,"Even though I have been to different view decks around the world, this one something unique as it's open observatory deck and you can stay as you wish to stay.

Breath taking views of sea at one side, skyscrapers on the other with infinity view of the sea with numerous ships all around.

Best time to visit during sunset as the city looks amazing in the night from the deck.

Must to do while you are in Singapore and highly recommended"
,,Great view,5.0,,It's located at the top of MBS building. You can access by the same lift to access to the room if you stay there. The view is bery beautiful. You can see the great panoramic Singapore city
,,Great views!,5.0,,Had a great visit to the skypark! Timed it for the afternoon/evening so we could get photos with the sun setting - was such a great view of the city! Recommended to everyone visiting Singapore - surrounding shopping centre with great restaurants and bars for a good night out!
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Audacious architecture. Top of the range shopping - everything you could ask for from premium brands. Food of every cuisine and very high quality, though not inexpensive."
,,Fantastic view at night,4.0,,Great time to go is about 7.30 pm when it is dark as you get a great view of the Gardens in the Bay light show at 7.45 then the laser light show on the marina at 8 pm. Views are astonishing
,,Great City Views,5.0,,"Must see views of the city from the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Complex, go up at night for the best city views."
,,Hot!,3.0,,"Not a huge area - only the very end. Tickets are expensive, although the view is spectacular. No seating or shade up there so it was very hot and humid. Photos are expensive, $30.00 for 1 print and $65.00 for a set. Small kiosk up...More"
,,View from the Top,5.0,,"You don't have to be a guest at the uber-expensive 5-Star+ Marina Bay Sands Hotel to go to the Skypark, but you do have to buy a ticket, which is reasonably priced. The views from the top out over the city, the ocean,and straight down...More"
,,View is amazing,5.0,,"Our uber driver recommend to go to the rooftop bar for a drink, and approx same price for admission for skypark. Great advise."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"Beautiful view of the Singapore skyline and huge observation deck area. Visit by day or night, the view is just gorgeous and if you're not staying at MBS, you will also have a great view of the inifinity pool. If staying at the hotel, it's...More"
,,Worth the visit with great views,5.0,,Spectacular views on offer and observe all the places you have visited or plan to see. Certainly oozes dollars. Extremely well organised and presented with the options to do some Brand/Label shopping or visit a top restaurant.
,,Nice View... I guess,4.0,,"Be prepared for the long queue at the lift both ways.. up & down from the 56th floor . To be fair, we were there on a Sunday. However, it is really quite a spectacular view. Maybe it is because I hv seen many tower...More"
,,For the view,4.0,,We had a company function & the staff had to clear existing customers before our event started at 8pm. Bar counter staff were very strict on not serving any drinks till 8pm. Some clients who came for our event commented our location was less hot...More
,,Come for the view but not much else,3.0,,Went up for the view - no charge. Had a (pricey) drink but that was expected. You cannot get to the edge of the platform as that is reserved for hotel guests but still you get a decent view of the area. If you have...More
,,Drinks with a view - no access fee,5.0,,"I'm not sure if we did anything special, but I don't understand all the reviews about the $23 to get to the top. We went after dinner with a couple of locals and initially it looked like a $38 cover charge including a drink to...More"
,,Overpriced and unfriendly,2.0,,Went to ce la vie and was disappointed. Good view but ignorant staff and full of wannabes. We left and went across to the club lounge where u can see the infinity pool. Service is a little better. Views ok. Probably worth a visit.
,,Fantastic views but nothing more,4.0,,"The visitor fee to the Skypark only allows you to walk around the front part of the ""ship"". There is a small kiosk where you can buy cold drinks, snacks and souvenirs but nothing more. There is nowhere to sit and there is no shade ... not good in the middle of a hot Singapore day. Would recommend though as the views are great."
,,Unique architecture,4.0,,Recommend to go to the top floor and enjoy a drink on the bar enjoying the view of the city. Architecture is amazing.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Enjoyed the 360 degree views of Singapore city. Enjoy some drinks at Ce la vie as well. You should never miss this place while in Singapore.
,,You don't need to be at the Hotel to get up there,5.0,,On the top floor there is a really nice lounge/soho bar where you can enjoy a drink and one of the best city views ever; on one side you have all the boats arriving and departing from the port and on the other side you have all the amazing Singapore.
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5.0,,Once I got over my nervousness of going to the edge.....I loved it! Beautiful views of Singapore. Would rate this as better value than the Eye which we had done 2 days previously. Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri was just the icing on the cake 🍹🍹
,,In transit,5.0,,Had a 10hour layover and decided to take the train to Marina bay. Had a lovely walk around the promenade and then went for sundowners at the skybar. Well worth it! Make sure to get there before sunset and stay till it's dark! Stunning view!!
,,Views Views Views!,5.0,,"For the peasants not staying at the hotel you can still get a brilliant 360 view of Singapore from the observation desk, and look on with jealousy at the hotel guests bathing in the rooftop pool. Costs $23 per person but a lot cheaper than booking a room at the hotel. I think that hotel would make a killing if they opened up a bar for the public on the observation desk. Its a great place to just soak in he views. Suggest going close to sunset so you can see the city change as the lights go on."
,,Must see for the skylit view,5.0,,"Fantastic View of Singapore. Best time to visit is 6 PM. You get to see the transition. Breathtaking view of Singapore. Port, office spaces and what not. Best is when the lights switch on. 56th floor view. 23 dollars. Worth it"
,,Very flash,5.0,,Amazing place to check out. It is very very flash and even has a river thru it!!! Try catch the night show outside too
,,View Singapore from the top.,5.0,,"This is a must . Take lift to the top and spend some time up there, the views are breathtaking,don't forget to take your camera.there is a fee to get up there, but it's worth it,do it."
,,Impressive landmark,4.0,,You can take the MRT subway to get close to the Sands then you can either visit the restaurants on the roof-top by pre-reservation or you can just go up to the bar for a drink. If you do neither of these then you may be asked to pay in order to get to the roof. The rooftop can occasionally close if there is a rainstorm coming in across the bay. Otherwise this is a very impressive complex.
,,Good,3.0,,It was good ...but we're not able to explore more because of health issue ...............nice to see marina bay. We love to visit again
,,Amazing views but not much else up top!,3.0,,Views over Singapore are amazing but it is just that. They don't allow you access to the bar at the top which is a shame.
,,Stayed at the hotel,5.0,,This is by far the best feature of the hotel!! What a marvel!!! So crazy to have a pool 50 some stories in the sky!!! What a place to sit down and enjoy a beer whilst taking in the view!!!! Simply breathtaking!!! You get an uninterrupted view 360 degrees. Cannot beat that!! What a way to see singapore!! Not an exclusive feature of the hotel as locals can pay to go up there so the only put off is that it seems like its constantly full..
,,Wonderful views,4.0,,"Walked across to the hotel after the first light show of the evening at the Gardens by the Bay. I wanted to see the show again from the viewing platform at the top of the hotel. Stunning views from the platform, but the lightshow looked too distant to really enjoy a second time round, and you couldn't hear the music from up there. Having said that, the remaining views out over Singapore were magnificent, and the elevated position really gave you a sense of tranquillity. You have no access to the guest swimming pool from here, but you can see it from the far end of the viewing platform. If you have a head for heights, it's a great photo stop. Walk back through the hotel afterwards too, it's quite stunning inside."
,,A must in Singapore,4.0,,"The marina bay sands is of course the place to see if you're around Singapore. The ride to the observation deck will cost you 23$ for an adult and will take you to a limited area. You will not be able to access the pool (reserved to the hotel guests) but can enjoy a lunch or dinner at the restaurant.

The view is simply breathtaking and will give you a good overview on some of the attractions Singapore offers.

You can stay as long as you want on the deck but 15-30m is probably enough."
,,Nice,5.0,,It is an amazing and beautiful towers. It's not free they are gonna charge you about 23$. They will not allow you to take your tripod or stand.
,,The view from the pool,5.0,,"Pretty neat place. My friends and I tried to get into Ku De Ta (the bar at the top) but we weren't dressed well enough, so we decided to go to the Sky Park instead. Admission is about $23 I believe, which isn't too bad compared to other similar to sky park places around the world (Eiffel Tower, Empire State, etc). The process going up is very much like the Empire State--they snap your photo with a green screen in the background, but here's the difference. By the time you've taken the elevator up, they actually have your photo printed for you to buy. I think it cost $50 though.. we thought we heard $15 but when we clarified they said $50 to us which is absolutely absurd.

Anyways, the view. We went a little before sunset and then just bummed around the top which was pretty typical. I've never seen so many people actually sitting at the top of one of these sky park things. The place is pretty spacious and the ground is wooden and it is pretty clean. You get a fantastic view of Singapore--from the Garden of the Bays and the Singapore Flyer on one side, and then the CBD on the other--it's stunning. It's great when you stay for sunset since you can watch the sun go down and the nightlife begin to wake up. There's a small concession stand that sells some food and drinks if you get hungry as well. I would highly recommend to anyone though--it's a great way to orient yourself to Singapore's layout and the view is quite stunning.

tldr; awesome views of Singapore at a decent price, worth the visit!"
,,Fantastic Veiws,5.0,,The inside is just as amazing as the outside. You must see this place at night & at day they are very difference experiences
,,Fun!,4.0,,"Really easy nice walk, cute shops, very clean, good people watching, you can see lots, I'd def recommend doing this"
,,Perfect Sunday afternoon,5.0,,Went up 56 floors to the Sky Park for the magnificent views of Singapore and beyond to Malaysia. Although very hot and humid there was a big black cloud in the distance slowly making its way towards us. Went onto the Upper Terrace for a scrumptious High Tea at 42SD. Finger sandwiches; mini quiche; macaroons; mini lemon meringue pie; chocolate brownie and a pot of Darjeeling tea. All served on an individual 2-tier stand. Perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon on a sink-into cushioned sofa.
,,climb up to get a good view of the city,4.0,,"This gives you a very good view of singapore. Best time is in the evening, so you get to see the lights turning on. It is an expensive deal, considering that it is just a view point."
,,"Go to the bar, it costs nothing",5.0,,Go to the Marina Sands bar as it costs nothing but you get an amazing view for the price of a drink. If you go to the sky view part they want to charge $22 dollars and you don't even get a drink.
,,Nice views on a clear day,4.0,,"The first time I visited this place was when Marina Bay Sands just opened so the entire skypark then open to the public for a fee. Now, unfortunately, the viewing deck is cordoned off from the infinity pool area which is only open to hotel guests. So sky deck guests can only see a limited portion of the entire sky deck. Nevertheless, the view from above is breathtaking on a clear day."
,,Excellent view from the top,5.0,,"Sands sky park,offers excellent view of the downtown and gardens by the bay. Seen in night time is best.combo tickets are available with gardens by the bay. It is taller that flyer.Infinity pool is not visible from skypark."
,,You'll pay for the fantastic view,4.0,,"We visited on our wedding anniversary for drinks and appetizers. Great quality, but darned expensive. The view is outstanding, and the big draw for the place. Service was exemplary and when our waiter heard it was our anniversary, a small cakes were served gratis. Very classy touch."
,,Great view,4.0,,Beautiful view and well worth the visit for the architecture alone. Service was good as well so have a coffee or drink and rest your feet for a bit while enjoying the vista.
,,impressive,4.0,,"I know nothing of architecture but I suppose this building's is one of the best. Be it day or night, it wouldn't fail to impress."
,,Perfect luxury place & view,5.0,,Excellent night and day view from the top of hotel Luxury location to hang out Swimming pool at the top ot the hotel International standard and services provided You pay and you get what you want
,,"if you have seen singapore flyer, no need to go here",3.0,,"only one third of the top deck is veiwable. Rest are not for public. If you have seen singapore flyer, there is nothin much you can do extra here"
,,Great view,5.0,,"Beautiful view of Singapore from there. And amazing building. It is best to go in the sunset, to see without lights and with lights. Great experience!!! I recommend to everyone!!"
,,Best View over Singspore,4.0,,"It was the afternoon tea. You can sit down under umbrellas till before 6pm and switch to standing seats near the rail with a better view. The deal of $34 includes a drink ( beer, cocktail etc) and all you can eat appetizers ( mainly crostini of all sorts (smoked salmon, eggs, potatoes, corn etc, quiches and a few desserts.
The view from Marina Bay Sand was stunning overlooking the waters with boats and the skyline. Good to relax or to take pictures.

When we went, It was an overcast day with a little breeze, sparing us from the scorching heat ( chilled beer does only help so much). Overall, the experience was very satisfying."
,,Great view....but overpriced.,3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands has become one of the world's most iconic buildings......and the view from the skypark is worth seeing.....however, maybe not for the price being charged.
We only spent around 15 minutes up there. For mine, there are better ways to spend your valuable time and money in Singapore than visiting here."
,,Greatest view!,4.0,,"You need to dress up, but you do not have to drink something on the top in the skybar. The view is breakthaking!"
,,Nicejjmm,4.0,,It is nice but very confusing to find out n I expensive if they allow only kkkkkk the deck....I travelled solo but if you have company it can be fun...the skjh y was clear and view beautiful...go at a time when ynnou can watch the graden rhapsody and laser show....
,,Best view!,5.0,,Do go for a drink but be prepared to pay! Glass of wine and a Margarita $ 60 Aus. The view is worth it though!
,,Good but expensive,3.0,,"The views were great and there is a small shop, bar and soft drink stand at the top. It is quite expensive to go up. There are signs to show the landmarks in most languages including english. The pool area is not accessible to non- hotel guests. You can get a souvenir photo but this is very expensive too ( £45 in a leather folder or £30 in cardboard), so most people don't bother. Great photo opportunities from the top of the tower. A lift takes you up, so no stairs to climb. Very hot at top as there is no shade."
,,Much Hyped,5.0,,"Location is damn good and costly, nothing like being on top of the roof with Beer to enjoy. If you want to see Singapore with single eye...that's it this the right place."
,,Great View,5.0,,Great view of singapore from the skypark. you can grab a drink up there or souvenir and take it the sights of singapore
,,Once in a life time must see,4.0,,"Previously when the hotel started operation we can go directly from the pool, Infinite Pool to this Sky Park, but the latest I came, July 2016 they close the way and open a restaurant or Bar as replacement.

Up in the sky is the view of Singapore, the Singapore Flyers especially. Nothing more ...
But at least if you have a chance you must cross at your check list of things to do ... this Sky Park."
,,Walk on Top,4.0,,"At 56th floor of Marina Bay Sand Hotels, it's huge open platform not just a viewing deck. Enough space for all. Must visit to see actual skyline of the city. Go 45 mins before sunset time. Wait till sunset. Then watch Light & sound show from top or at ground floor...
If you are staying at Marina Bay Sand Hotel hit the infinite pool on 57th floor. Adjoining to Skypark."
,,Upper class place,4.0,,"This is one of the iconic place in Singapore. I like Marina Bay Sands, but it suits the upper class people more. I don't mind to spend my money here if i'm not travelling on budget. And also the place itself was really good to take picture."
,,1st place 2 visit in Singapore,5.0,,"I am not big on observatories at all especially living in Tokyo where the Tokyo Metro Observatory is free so I was skeptical of MBS Skypark, (especially the outrageously priced boutiques,) but I was pleasantly surprised by this and did not feel exhilarated much by Singapore until getting up here and seeing how such a tiny island turned itself into one of the most vibrant, prosperous economies in the world. I had been driving around Singapore seeing things I had no idea what they were until going up here I could figure out what they were and decide where I wanted to visit further.
Do give it a go and read the displays which also give you good info. on Singapore, as well."
,,I have trouble coming to grips with the scale of the place,4.0,,"Where on earth does one begin? Down the bottom in the MRT station I suppose. When you walk between the station and Marina Bay Park you pass a long underground water ride, very popular with kids. From there you are directed down what must be the world's most expensive shopping mall. No normal jewelry stores here, nosiree Bob, every luxury watch brand has its own shop. The prices in their display window are staggering! This is the hotel's shopping area, for it is indeed a hotel.

At the end of this Alladin's Cave of excess is the access to the observation deck of Marina Bay's Skypark on level 56 of this extraordinary building. Warning, the observation deck is NOT suitable for anyone who suffers from vertigo or acrophobia. Also be sure to bring a hat. You are just about on the Equator and the sun up here is brain frying. A bottle of water is also recommended as is a good quality camera, not just a smartphone because the views are spectacular.

When you finally tear yourself away and descend to the hotel's lobby, you will understand why the expensive shops on the level below thrive. China has something like 20 million millionaires. Marina Bay Park is their playground. Well worth a visit."
,,Fantastic views,3.0,,Worth a visit but with inside local knowledge you should visit the sky bar on 57 and you get the same few and all you need to do is buy a drink. Saves the admission cost on the sky deck and you get a drink and a chair.
,,See everything (almost),5.0,,"The haze will make your deck visit day an upset. Otherwise, go up on a sunny day and expect to get a tan and a great view of this garden city, Singapore.
Make sure your charge your camera and capture the scene from every angle possible."
,,Beautifully busy,4.0,,I would definitely recommend going up here around sunset. That way you can see singapore in the day and the singapore lights at night. There are a lot of people so allow time to spare as you will be waiting in line for the elevator to exit. Otherwise if this is the only activity you can do in singapore besides eating i recommend it.
,,Magnificent Structure,5.0,,"It's indeed a place to be visited. The mall has a water way which resembles the Mall of Dubai. Such a exclusively high priced shops with a eat-out section which is the cheapest you can get, SGD 20 is worth for Marina Bay Sands Skypark."
,,best hotel,5.0,,"stayed 2 night here and found best rate and class hotel , warm welcomed on arrival and wet towel with welcome drinks provided every one . very clean hotel with good services."
,,great place for lunch on top floor,5.0,,very high up with great views over 360 deg. you don't need to book the 4 course lunch as you are told you need to by staff on desk. Just take lift and approach the bar staff to get a seat in the bar room for light lunch.
,,Great view,4.0,,"We were in Singapore for a few days, and wanted to get a perspective of the city. The Skypark is an excellent way to do this. Great views across the city - from the Marina Barrage, Grand Prix track and the Financial District."
,,We visited the bar instead,5.0,,"So my husband and I visited the bar instead (you just tell the concierge that you want to go to cest la vie). You ride the elevator (the bar is higher than skylark) and enjoyed a night with drinks (instead of paying for the elevator ride up to skypark). Beer was 16-20 dollars each. Drinks 20+ but considering you saved on the elevator ride...
Fun night and you have great view of the Singapore skyline"
,,Worth it,5.0,,I went at night and it was just spectacular. The views are amazing and you get a real sense of the vibrancy of the city. Take your camera and the panorama shots you can get are just gorgeous.
,,Singapore Holiday,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands and the Skypark were a real highlight. The pool is stunning - swim to the edge and just take in the amazing Singapore skyline. The views are outstanding.
,,Amazing views...,5.0,,This is a must visit place preferably at night time to get superb glimpse of Singapore city. Make sure you don't go there on rainy or sunny days as this place has no shades.
,,Disappointed,2.0,,"If you are a frequent traveler, this place might disappoint you. View from little far is excellent because of unique design of the building. But inside there is nothing much to see. Casino and mall with food court."
,,Must go in Singapore,5.0,,If you go to Singapore you must go to Marina Bay Sands Skypark to have a look to Marina Bay Skyline at sunset hour on in the evening. The panorama both on the bay and on Gardens By the Bay is amazing. Even if you are not guest of the hotel you can go to have a drink in one of the loung bar of the hotel. They are very expensive (as everything in singapore). You can't swim into the infinity pool if you are not a guest of the hotel. I don't know if is necessary a ticket to go to the Skypark.
,,Very nice,5.0,,It was the first building that amazed me in singapore. Most of the building there are build with nice design.
,,Great Views,5.0,,Enjoyed the view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Something you must do when you come to Singapore. Great views of Singapore skyline.
,,"Amazing view, excellent for drinks",5.0,,"Take the Ce La Vi elevator from inside the 3rd tower instead of buying a tourist ticket to the view deck (for 23 S$ per person) and have a drink with a view. You'll pay less for the drinks than for the tourist ticket,and you're one floor higher than the view deck. Awesome experience!"
,,"Great views, visit around 5 so you get daytime & sunset views.",4.0,,This was a great experience although very busy & the bar was very crowded with hotel guests. We ended up having dinner there but didn't realise if you dine there you don't have to pay entry so lost out on over $50.00 Singapore dollars...go straight to the restaurant entry when dining so you don't lose out like us.
,,Dining at the highest level,5.0,,"The site from the viewing are at the top floor was spectaculer,you can see most of singerpore and even the neighbouring indonesia.it was crowded though by the many tourists me being one of them.the experienceis wonderful."
,,It is Nice Mall and Hotel,5.0,,Nice mall with all brands shops in. great views on bridge to marina bay. We had nice evening window shopping and having dinner at Beans cafe.
,,secret,4.0,,"Skip the observation deck. Head up to Ce la via for a cocktail and you get a better view and a cocktail, boom. Best view of Singapore, pretty good atmosphere and the strongest cocktails I have ever had."
,,Wonderful view,4.0,,"Very nice view of Singapore from the skypark. It is not very cheap but it is worth to have a view from the top. You will see the bay, gardens by the bay, financial buildings etc.. It is better to have a view after the sunset"
,,Breath-taking!,5.0,,"So glad we opted to visit here. The views were fantastic, it wasn't that busy or crowded so there was a real sense of space.
We went in the middle of the day - there's little shade at the top and you do spend quite a lo of time admiring the views so you do need sunscreen/cap/umbrella.
A definite must!"
,,Visit to Skypark,4.0,,"Was told the viewing area has been reduced to the front only. It was a nice look out for whole Singapore, however no access to the pool side and also tickets are quite pricey."
,,Stunning!!,5.0,,You cannot miss this when in Singapore!! Go there in the evening. Its just breathtaking. Amazing experience.
,,A must see in Singapour,4.0,,Definitely a must see in Singapour. The boat shape at the very top is just amazing. You can have a drink with unlimited top-notch appetizers at Cé La Vi on the 57th floor ish (34$++). Might sound a bit expensive but it is really worth it if you don't travel on a budget. Perfect to finish an afternoon with a some electro-chill music and great views over the city.
,,What a view,5.0,,We went to the top of this hotel 56th floor! What an experience. People are very lucky who stay at this hotel. Lovely views from the top.
,,Beautiful sight,5.0,,Take a camera and come at 8pm. Snap a photo of the structure and be awed by the beauty of the set up.
,,Visited Sky Park. View was awesome,5.0,,Go in the evening and stay till lighting comes on. It was crowded but we stayed longer and it was worth it. Cafe is nice. serves small snacks and coffee. Restaurant is only for hotel guests.
,,Breath taking,5.0,,"This is simply amazing. A must see in Singapore! I would recommend this attraction to all ages. WOW, I would go again."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Had an evening drink on the top floor, worth a visit! Outstanding views especially all the boats in the harbour."
,,The view,4.0,,Pay a less than $30 to view the Singapore from top garden. Great staffs! It was morning but I went just for couple of minutes as too hot! Anyway nice experience. Will go again in evening
,,THE Swimming pool,5.0,,"a huge hotel, all the high end stores you may imagined and the most amazing infinity pool.........a miracle view and the most romantic dive after 10 pm"
,,Singapore skyline visible from several buildings but this is the best view,5.0,,"Arrived around noon on a Saturday expecting to have to wait in a queue but there was no one waiting and we were in the lift speeding up to the 56th floor having purchased tickets for the observation deck.

There was plenty of space to take in the views but very little shade so be prepared if you visit.

In total spent about 1 hour looking at Singapore from different angles. Hotel guest areas and the infinity pool cannot be accessed with the Observation deck tickets."
,,Excellent View From The Top,4.0,,"Even after having to wait in line for more than an hour in large crowds in a hot basement of the hotel in order to catch an elevator ride to the top, this was a nice thing to have seen and done while in Singapore. The view of the city was Spectacular. There's even a bar on the Sky Deck if you want to stay for a while and have a drink. The whole skyline was visible from every angle and you could take great photos of the city at night."
,,Nice views,4.0,,Nice views for the city skyline. Can see far out across the see and landscape. A bit expensive though which is my only gripe with it. And people sitting close to the glass windows so you can't get a good view.
,,must see,5.0,,this is indeed some hotel and a marvel of architecture. even national geographic had covered when was being planned and built.the skypark consists of infinity pool ( open to hotel guests) bar area both enclosed ac area and in open. suggest grab table if you get it the VIEW is simply out of this world of the bay area and as far as you see. evening times over drinks and watch the lit up singapore. BUT if its windy or raining its closed to all. theirs also exclusive members club also.MUST VISIT.
,,Amazing view from 56th floor,4.0,,"We bought tickets on the ground floor and went up by a super fast elevator. The view from 56th floor is stunning and appealing. It costs $23 for a person so don't leave too quick, just linger here to have a wonderful panoramic view of Singapore"
,,A breathtaking experience... Must visit...,5.0,,"Even though I live in Singapore for more than 8 years but always neglected to visit this sky park but last week I visited there an it was really an excellent experience.

Tips : Purchase the tickets on qoo10 so that it's not expensive. And feel free to grab tea or coffee at the top of skypark, it's not expensive. I stayed there for about 3 hrs, best time is to go around 5 pm and stay there until 8 pm so that you can take the pictures both on day light and also in the night. In night it looks stunning from the top of the park.

Must visit there again .... Go ahead guys and enjoy this pace ...."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"Must visit for everyone who will come to Singapore. Great view over the city, nice cocktails and atmosphere."
,,Worth every penny!,5.0,,"We were on the twenty first floor which seemed quite high enough, but swimming in the infinity pool at 57 stories high was amazing! Best hotel we have ever stayed at. Modern decor and pure luxury rooms. From the moment we stepped into the foyer we were impressed. Will go back there next month. Sky infinity pool was my favourite experience. Breakfast had everything you could want, but pricey. The only difficulty for me, being disabled, was that I couldn't take a lift directly from my room floor to the rooftop pool. I had to get out at floor 49 and walk to another lift to finish the journey."
,,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING,5.0,,"Amazing to look at out our Hotel Marina Manderine balcony then when actually up there it was WOW !!!!!! Had a good look around then wanted a drink at the bar, asked a host how much for 1 beer and 1 orange juice, he told us $35 Singapore so we declined. This may have been because he was getting a cut as a host and may have been a lot less had we just ordered over the bar. As we were right at the end of a 5 week holiday we thought this was too much to pay. View was breathtaking."
,,MAGNIFICENT LOCATION,5.0,,What a view to see Singapore. Stunning view to see this beautiful city. Place is small or overcrowded. Prices od drinks are expensive . Abusively. But AN EVENING IN SINGAPORE which no one can forget
,,Had to have a look,3.0,,Ok place. Visited for a few drinks after work. Great views over the city but left a little non plussed. Can't say exactly why
,,Quick Visit,3.0,,"The views are nice, but it was an overcast day so, not the best of views. If you eat at the restaurant, you get to walk on the upper deck for free. The food is good but service is a bit off. If you have time, the slow service won't be much of a bother."
,,Once In A Lifetime,4.0,,"How much more touristic can life get? We had a drink on the 57th floor, and won't forget it. What a setting. Jockeying for tables is not pretty, but then what the heck."
,,Chill out ..,5.0,,This place is great for evening out and lots of restaurants and bars to visit .. To do list when you are in Singapore ..and don't miss laser show in water ..
,,Best night life location,5.0,,"A top notch nightlife spot, reservation is required. Prices are a bit expensive but it worth for an unforgettable night."
,,Nice view but ruins with bad service!!,2.0,,"We were hesitant to go there because we thought it's expensive so after visiting the place here is my review: the view from the top it's absolutely breathtaking... it's beautiful... the downside: They have this little lovely coffee shop/bar which is accessible to the hotel guests... shame! instead, they have only made a small shop that has some very limited drinks/ice cream and terribly expensive for the large number of visitors of the skypark.... but there are no chairs or tables to sit down... they have this massive wooden decking on the top which is totally useless and empty...visitors were forced to sit on the floor.. I think it's rather rude, expecting people to pay such price to get up there but do not accommodate your visitors with at least some chairs to sit on!!? They probably do not want people to spend too much time up there...fast track... take your photos and get out!!... high turn over for making more money!!? hmm...you decide!"
,,morning walk,4.0,,it's very refreshing place to be ....near almost anything you need food or shopping and it's relaxing.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"This is a one of a kind experience. Infinity pool on 57th floor, bars, and restaurants. Expensive food and drink. Admission charge unless staying in Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
,,Something that has to be done,4.0,,"The space is very small but the views are magnificent. What I did not like is the constant asking by staff if you are staying at the hotel. It's done in a way almost to belittle you in someway.
Also the bar and restaurant have a dress code. We would have gone but we are not the type to dress up while on vacation. Definitely worth the views but the experience isn't mind blowing."
,,Beautiful place.,5.0,,Went here with my partner and friend for visiting. The building were amazing. So easy to get here if you know how to use the train. But you also can walk to get here.we just walking around the lake and sit down to watch the building. Amazing.
,,Better from a distance,3.0,,"From across the bay the structure looks amazing but up close just OK. Not to say that is not a nice architectural structure but a bit over done. Also, it is another chance of shop and eat until you drop inclusive of indoor river, high end hotel and the casino.

The light show is great from the other side of the bay at night."
,,"Great View, shame about the rest",4.0,,"While we couldn't fault the view from the 57th floor, we will not go again. The bars were heaving, the drinks expensive and there was a feeling of 'one in, out out' about the whole place that made the experience very impersonal. Singapore is a place where money rules, and no more so than at MBS Skypark. There was no where to sit, so it was standing room only. There was a scrum to get up to the top floor and lots of VIP only designations which meant the space available was much smaller than you would expect for such a large area. The foyer on the ground floor is just like a huge shopping mall. I can't imagine anyone feels much sense of personal service anywhere."
,,Fantastic view to the skyline,5.0,,"At the skypark you have a gorgeous view to the skyline of singapore !!! In the tower 3 is the elevator to the 56th and 57th floor. For the 56th floor you must buy a ticket for the platform. I recommend the 57th floor, you can have drink at the bar or eat something in the restaurant and enjoy the view. At the 57th floor is the swimming pool as well, but usable only as a guest from the hotel."
,,Fabulous of Marina Bay.,5.0,,"57 floors high takes you to the top of these towers. You could only go to one end of the platform as the rest is reserved for hotel guest. We could not use the bar/restaurant, but there is a cafe on the viewing platform. Unlimited time, which is good for most but there are no seats. Not a problem for the younger generations, most were happy to sit on the floor, waiting for it to get dark. Fabulous views."
,,Lovely view,3.0,,"We came here in the evening,very crowded,queues for the elevator...Not the inspiring place I imagined, but maybe at another time..."
,,Better than a bird's eye view,4.0,,"Went on a drizzly and cloudy day, but the view still amazes me and my Melbourne friends, though a little glum because of the weather and lack of sunshine. The lift ride up to the top and down were extremely fast. The deck offers a 360 degree view of popular landmarks. There is also a photo booth and I must say that the quality and effect of the print is worth buying as a souvenir."
,,Singapore in all its glory,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel as part of our holiday and the highlight has to have been the Skypark. The infinity pools were the best we've seen, and the fantastic views over Singapore and the islands was breathtaking. We'll definitely visit again next time."
,,Great city views,4.0,,Enjoyed the rooftop observation deck; however would like to have seen the pool. The observation deck was a great vantage point for the 7:45 pm Botanic Gardens lightshow. The perspective is very different seeing the show from above the gardens. The city view was spectacular.
,,the most Expensive view of Sinagpore,3.0,,"The place is nice and the views are amazing, but the price is so expensive. Just for walk you pays more than 20$, and there is not any place to sit (whitout paying of course). It isn´t worth."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"Stayed at MBS for my husband's bday celebration and we stayed at the Sands Suite so the skypark is complimentary for us. We soaked ourselves in the awesome infinity pool for hours and the view from the skypark is just breathtaking!! Best part is the pool is open till midnight so we got to see the musical fountain display around 830pm from the skypark. It's really amazing! We love every single bit of it, the cool air, ambience, and of course the view of Singapore city from the top. Point to note, the skypark is at the highest level in MBS so if you're afraid of heights, this might not be suitable for you. But if you're adventurous type of person then you should try it!"
,,Great views!,4.0,,"Take a ride to the 57th floor of MBS and be rewarded with spectacular views of the Bay!

You aren't going to get to see the promo shots of the infinity pool - it is usually crowded with hotel guests taking selfies in the pool against the Singapore skyline.

Alternatively - you can opt to dine at Spargos or at the cafe lounge on the same floor - you skip the entrance fees and use it to pay for a meal or drink instead!"
,,Am a fan of the building and was disappointed.,3.0,,Very expensive and you don't get to see the infinity pool. The view from the marina (near the merlion for instance) is much better and free !
,,Great view go to the bar not the observation deck,5.0,,Would recommend you go to the bar (free) instead of the observation deck that you have to pay for. The beer is cold the view amazing and if you like pineapple juice - freshly made.
,,Sharing experience of Marina Bay sands skypark,5.0,,It was a nice experience as we were able to get a close view of the Marina Bay hotel.Had a great view of Singapore from the top of the marina Bay.
,,Great View,5.0,,"Amazing view from the observation deck. Did not eat there but had a mixed drink...very expensive , it is the view we are paying for. I would recommend a night visit to check out the city lights. There is a club on top...I did not check this out though.

Cheers Bob"
,,"Great views, a must to see",5.0,,"The views are spectacular up here, it's not a bad spot to watch the rhapsody of the SuperTrees at night time, I loved this spot."
,,Drink in the Sky!,5.0,,It is a must to visit the roof garden of the Skypark and enjoy a drink over Singapore! Fantastic feeling!
,,Neat to see but not sure I'd stay here,3.0,,"My daughter wanted to see the pool on top as it was featured on an hgtv pool master special as the one of the highest pools in the world. So we took the elevator up to the restaurant and went to the far edge by the pool to see it. The view was absolutely amazing. A great 360 view of the area and if you don't do the flyer, it should be a stop to get such a birds view of the surrounding areas. Drinks and food were pricey. You can't swim in the pool unless you are staying there, and it is a huge hotel. Fun to visit, but not sure it's worth the expense when there are so many other great places to stay."
,,Wow.,5.0,,"The building is wow and the sky deck is even more so.

Worth the money and the view is gobsmacking.

I had an ice cream at the top and expected a super inflated price but had a Hagen Das cornetto for a reasonable 4.5 Singapore dollars.

Best view in years and best holiday snaps so far."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"This is a must have if you stop by In Singapore.. this hotel is the Queen of the City from every spot you see it there, giant and wonderful.. by night with all the flashing lights even better show.
The rooms are not so special in terms of design but the view if you're at a high level is amazing.
The pool experience.. only one word: divine.
Please try it"
,,Something that should not be missed,5.0,,"A little pricey but worth it
You barely feel the lift moving up the 50+ levels and walk out onto the viewing platform but feel perfectly safe, The views are superlative with a wonderful view of the Gardens by the Bay. Could have stayed there a lot longer just looking but time would not allow it"
,,Nice hotel,4.0,,It is a nice hotel and view from outside is really good. We enjoyed going around this hotel and seeing its beauty.
,,Amazing skyline,5.0,,"It was my second time at the skypark but first time of my wife's.
The view is amazing, simply beautiful. Great view point of one of the most amazing skylines in the world.
One hour is enough for the experience.
The price is a bit high but it worth the wile."
,,just ok,3.0,,"Its like seeing any city from a higher vantage point, plus there are many places to do this free in Singapore, so why pay?"
,,beautiful night view of Singapore,4.0,,"the observation deck is at 56th floor. it provides a great night view of the city, the flyer and the race track. in case you are ready to shell out more, look for dinner reservations at the terrace restaurant for a night to remember."
,,Super view!!,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore, you have to go there!!! The entrance of the bar is free but the drinks are really expensive!! In any case, definitely cool!!!"
,,Marina bay sands,5.0,,Have t go early to see the sunset. Beautiful. Later night we watch lazer show. After that went to gardens by the bay. From there we watch light show. Enjoyed
,,Breeeeeethhhhh,4.0,,Floore 56! You can enjoy all the Singapore view from the higest point of view... Everything will appear so small around of you...
,,"Great view, not cheap",4.0,,"Yes it's an awesome view, but for the fact we went up for only 10-15 minutes at $23 each was quite expensive.

I understand you can go up to the bar/restaurant and it's the same view. We were just not dressed to go there and probably would have had to make a booking.

Can say we done it and been up but definately won't again for the price."
,,Memorable once in Life Time,5.0,,"Don't miss this Marina Bay Sands Sky park, I deal time is evening, nut lot of crowed is there, there's nothing much you can do other than the beautiful sceneries up above Singapore. I ideally 30 minutes is enough."
,,Incredible view - obviously!,5.0,,"We actually went a level up to the restaurant and were able to get the same view for free! If you don't want to pay to enter the observation deck, this is probably just as good. So cool to be able to see the Gardens by the Bay below."
,,Ce la vi visit,5.0,,"Great place, put up a review for their Bar - Ci La Vi - recommened as opposed to buying a ticket to get to the observatory deck. Very friendly staff. Must do!"
,,Unreal,4.0,,"couldn't afford to stay here perhaps one ,visted via floor 57 leads you to restuarants and the pool area which is unreal ,fab views ,great feeling ,drinks little expensive but go with the flow."
,,Great view but short and expensive,3.0,,"In total it is a great experience to get up with the very fast elevator to the 56 level. We paid for the view 23 S Dollar. It was prohibited to leave the marked area or to get up to the restaurant. Therefore is another entrance! So, if you want to take a drink there take care to find the correct entrance ;)"
,,pleasing sunset,3.0,,stay at sunset and see nice view at the night time you can see laser show and have beautiful relax time
,,Do it once...,3.0,,"We read up on this place before visiting. It said that a dress standard was enforced after 6.00 pm. Se we frocked up a bit.

Clearly, other patrons hadn't read the script! Ripped board shorts, Bintang singlets and old thongs were the dress of the day.

I'm OK with that, but don't state a standard on your website and not enforce it.

Drinks were pricey. It was very crowded (on a Tuesday night!)

Excellent service by the bar staff.

Amazing view at sunset.

Got to see the pool at Marina Bay Sands - it was so crowded people were standing shoulder to shoulder. Glad I didn't fork out $1K per night on it!

Do it once."
,,A must experience attraction,4.0,,"You only nee to visit this place once to get the idea. Amazing views, spectacular sunsets,under cool vibe and sky high prices.Tick it off and move on !"
,,Nice view,3.0,,"Its a great view of the city, but the light show isn't great from up here. The photos were great from here of both sides and it's beautiful at night, but the light show would probably be better down on the bay"
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"It's a ""must see"" in Singapore. The view from the roof is more than amazing and cocktails served by the restaurant, located near the roof swimming pool, are fantastic. If you are going to visit the sky deck bar or restaurant you don't have to pay the entrance fee."
,,Why not?,5.0,,I went up and buy only one (expensive) beer. It was totally worth it; nice viewm atmosphere and a really cool pool next to the bar. You cannot swim if you are not staying in the hotel. Recommended!
,,Excellent and must Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"You feel like you are at top of city with great view. I recommend a must visit place in Singapore. Evening after 5PM is the best time to visit this place. You can view all city in evening sun light, sun set and how entire city starts lightning. All view within 2 hours. Amazing experience."
,,skypark was awesome,5.0,,"i reached skypark in evening , you can view whole singapore with winds blowing at good speed , its 57th floor"
,,not cheap,4.0,,"Looks great from far away and close up, the hall of the hotel on the ground floor is phantastic. The visit from the 56th floor is great too, but still a bit expensive; one cannot sit down and have a drink, most of the top floor (the ""boat"") is reserved for hotel customers; a bit disappointing, for the price of going up..."
,,Beautiful view at night.,4.0,,Beautiful but very very high. No time limit but note you are not able to view the infinity pool as that is for guests only (fair enough). No need to rush up to see the light show as the real beauty of the light show is from the other side of the harbour. Cost is $23 but if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass you get a 15% discount.
,,Amazing building construction,5.0,,Just amazed how human constructed this building. Best time to see is also in the evening from Marina Bay Sands with city lights.
,,OMG!,5.0,,"Totally worth the money. The views are to die for. Every partner had to agree and he didn't want to go, as he thought it was a lot of money."
,,Marina Bay and the Rest,4.0,,When you are wandering around Singapore your eyes are constantly drawn to this magnificent building. Curiosity draws you to the top. The views are magnificent in 3 directions covering about 330 degrees. The pool is for guests only and prevents a 360 degree rotation. It's still worth the $20 Singaporean for the ride to the top.The $45 Singapore asking price for a picture of the visit is a bit pricey but it's optional. You can get plenty of your own great shots from such a wonderful vantage point.
,,I bit pricy but the views are amazing,4.0,,"The view of downtown Singapore from the part of the Skypark the public has access to is amazing. We want on a hot sunny day and, as long as you didn't mind the sun, the deck was not crowded and the signs in diction what you were looking at were a neat feature. We didn't bother with the photo taken bu the site staff, way too expensive to even tinker about. It was very clear that part was all about profit. Just Tae your own pictures and take in the magnificent view!"
,,Views are amazing,5.0,,"This is a great way to see all of Singapore, the views from here are amazing, also the viewing deck is higher than the Skywheel, be aware that if the weather is bad they will not allow you on the viewing deck"
,,'Sunset Cocktails',4.0,,Two years ago we stayed at the Marina Bay sands. This time we came for the sunset cocktails at the Skypark. Get there early and find your best seat. Sit back and watch twilight falls and enjoy your flow of beers.
,,Worth the Admission,5.0,,Fabulous panoramic view from the 54th Floor observation desktop. It's free if you stay at the hotel but that will set you back some!
,,Vacation with pleasure,5.0,,"Fulfilling when I visited marina bay.it looks unbelievable! Before I've seen only in the picture but when I go there personally see the structure all I can say is WOW .
hoping to see and visit you soon... if there's a country that I could choose to relax of course ... number one for me SINGAPORE"
,,Iconic building in the skyline of Singapore,4.0,,This unique building changed the skyline of Singapore into a highly recognizable one and looks beautiful at night. There is an admission fee required to enter the sky park. There are also a number of restaurants with a view a below the sky park.
,,Very Good Views of the City; Higher than the Singapore Flyer,5.0,,"As we went there at night, we enjoyed some great night views of Singapore. You look down on the Singapore Flyer from higher up, another popular attraction for good views of the city. It costs you 23 SGD (per adult), but it's worth it."
,,Congested,2.0,,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights, and visited the skypark. Although the view is fantastic, but the layout design for the whole place is horrible especially with large crowd. The place feels congested and no sense of luxury and class the place should have especially with the type of pricing the hotel charges."
,,No Pool for Olympics !,5.0,,"During our sojourn in the Marina Bay Sands ,we decided to swim in the pool of the Skypark.The Infinity Pool is on the 57th floor of the connecting loop of the three towers.It appears to be an illusion .

It is actually a mid sized pool on one of the towers.The depth was probably 1.5 meter .Surrounding the Infinity Pool are terrace , bistro bar and palm trees with sun decks.The pool is very crowded during our visit..We noticed many were doing selfies instead of swimming..

Anyway ,we swam to the edge of the pool .It was our first swimming experience with mobile phone and a camera..Singapore skyline view from the edge was indeed breathtaking..The Infinity Pool is certainly not a swimming venue for Singapore's Olympic gold medallist."
,,Disappointing Visit,2.0,,"I have been here once before and had cocktails from the Skybar whilst walking around the deck to admire the view and it was brilliant. However, I believe the Skypark has recently been taken over to a company seperate to the hotel, and it has been turned into something completely different. Now you have to either go up to a crowded outdoor bar area with a poor view, pay outragious prices to go to the restaurant to have access to the Skybar where it looked to be crowded and small, or to pay to go up onto the viewing deck where you can only see a fraction of the view and you do not have access to the Skybar so cannot get any drinks. Totally ruined a perfectly good place to visit!"
,,Spectacular architecture that dominates the Bay area,4.0,,"As you dock at the cruise port, this building just dominates the skyline. It is very imposing and impressive example of modern architecture."
,,Amazing,5.0,,This was an amazing end to our trip to Singapore. We visited at night. Had Singapore slings and watched the laser show over the river
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"You can see all the city from here, really amazing. It's impossible to stop watching , i've got my iphone gallery full of pics (done near 10 pm) . A must in Singapore! Highly reccomended"
,,Extraordinary view,4.0,,"But average hot dogs, and you can't take stuff up with you. Best advice is to book as a resident and go to the hotel bar, that would be fantastic."
,,57th floor. !!,5.0,,"wow. ears start plugging up as we go up the lift. a huge infinity pool, nice resturant serves alcohol and light snacks.at 3.30 pm Spago the other world famous restuarnat on the other side. great to see the city!"
,,Great Views but Expensive and Crowded,3.0,,"The views are outstanding of both Marina Bay and the Gardens, however if you are just going up for a view it is expensive, we were charge $23 per person, and when we were there it was very corwded, which made it difficult to see the view. The bar was crowded and we struggled to get in for a drink.

The vast majority of the Skypark is set aside for the hotel guests, as it should be, so be aware you have very limited access to the roof if you are not a hotel guest. On the return to the ground floor the elevator attendant shoved so many people in it was near impossible to move."
,,SIA Discount,4.0,,"Since we did not stay in the hotel, admission to the top floor was by purchased tickets only. With our Singapore Airlines boarding passes, we received discounted prices. There were lines waiting to buy tickets & lines waiting for the 3 special elevators to take us to the 57th floor.

The view from the top was spectacular - we were able to view both sea-side and city-side from behind the protective glass ""wall"". The infinity pool was still off-limits however.

We were in position just before sunset, so we got some great pictures, then waiting for the 8 pm light/laser show. It was a little disappointing because we were too far to see it well & to hear the music/narration.

There was another long line waiting to take the elevators back downstairs but overall, we thought the view was quite worth the trouble/inconvenience. I don't think we will do it again, but we wanted to do it at least once for the experience. It would have been lovelier if there wasn't as much haze (smog?)"
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,"The views are great, but it is over priced. The waiting time for lift is irritating. Anyway its one of the best way to see Singapore overall in distance"
,,one of the best,5.0,,incredible design amazing from all aspects great view aremarcable piece of engeneering give u relaxesation and gust peace
,,Great view,4.0,,"A must-see when in Singapore. The deck offers a fantastic view over the city, the financial district and the gardens by the bay."
,,Don't bother. Waste of time and money,1.0,,"Overpriced ticket to the skypark, which only allows you access to one end of the rooftop. Overcrowded. The line to exit was half the length of the deck, and took 30 minutes to get out. A safety hazard at the least a massive inconvenience"
,,Just simply stunning,5.0,,"We have stayed at the hotel itself and made regular use of the Skypark. It is just stunning being in the pool on the 57th floor looking over Singapore Bay. There are Bars and Restaurants on top. You can come up here at any time of day or night and its just such a great atmosphere and feels very Cosmopolitan. Sky on 57 Restaurant cannot be missed. Incredible food with incredible views, quality of food outstanding, service outstanding, really not to be missed. If there is one place while you are in Singapore, this is one that has to be on your itinerary"
,,Do not miss this!,5.0,,"This is the best thing in Singapore, apart from the thousands of people you have to share it with, they are the most beautiful gardens, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are just so special and beautiful, you need lots of time, a fully charged camera, go early or late in the day and enjoy, enjoy, its wonderful. The history of the place was explained on a film clip on Singapore Airlines, so it helps with knowing a little about it before you arrive. Well worth the time and a must see in Singapore. Would go back in a heart beat."
,,"Great view, but a little bit pricey, though",4.0,,"Even though a little bit pricey, we got a great view over Marina Bay and a little bit beyond.
To forget the money spent on getting this view, we bought Singapore Slings (S$ 15). So that might be a tips.

As a tourist, you are only allowed to be at a small part of the boat-shaped roof (the other parts are reservated to the hotel guests)."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Although it is not the only or best spot to see SG from above and entry is now charged, it is worth it."
,,Skypark and infinity pool,4.0,,"The whole place on top is very nice. However, there is no control on the ethic and dressing of the guest. This problem mainly from the hotel guest which makes the whole place looks like market. The bars and restaurants are the nice to chill out."
,,"wow, great view!",5.0,,"paid 23 Sing $ which at the time I was not sure if it was going to be worth it. You are informed that you cannot see the the infinity pool, and only have a deck area to walk about...but what a view! spent over an hour just taking it in. I would pay a bit extra and have a drink or snack at the very top. Highly recommended"
,,The best view of the island at your leisure,4.0,,"This place is somewhere, where I take all my guests, its a great place to look over the skyline of Singapore, gardens by the bay and the ships in the ocean. Its great during the day and at night. Night lights from up there are just awesome! A must see to feel the city!"
,,Just Beautiful!!,5.0,,We've seen this hotel on the Travel Channel and The Amazing Race & we definitely wanted to check it out. No disappointment. Views are stunning & staff very friendly. Worth every cent! The light show at night was very nice too! A must do in Singapore!
,,An absolute must!,5.0,,"Went in the evening to the SkyBar at CÉ LA VI, had a cocktail - pricey but worth it in my opinion. If you go to the sky bar you dont pay to get in. After 10pm gents must be wearing long pants; taylored shorts are accepted before this time. The view is just stunning and you can get some amazing photos. If you want to go to the Flight Bar, gents have to wear proper shoes, they were very strict and wouldn't let my husband in with his summer shoes that have cut outs in."
,,hig flyer,5.0,,this is one of the place you have too visit start in the bottomentre and se the huge bilding inside take the elerwaither to the plattform and look at the city from this high its great higly recomended
,,Mbs,5.0,,Must see attraction pool at 57 floor and casino in basement are highly recommended they also have restaurant at 55 floor
,,Stunning Views of Singapore,5.0,,"We were staying at the hotel so this was included for us but the views are stunning! You want pictures of both the day time views and night time views from here! The pool is amazing but less crowded during the day so that's the best time of you actually want to swim and not be running into a bunch of people. They have photographers that go in the water that take pictures for you that you can then purchase. We ended up with 21 pictures and had 3 printed there, the rest were given in soft copy. I personally think it is definitively worth going up you can see so much of Singapore the pictures you get are amazing!"
,,Spectaculat but impersonal,3.0,,"Massive place, looked great and spectacular architecture. I suspect it would be great if you're stinking roch buy a tad impersonal."
,,the pool and the restaurant and the club service are out standings. Tere is a chocolate special serving excellent as wel,4.0,,"everything excellent except for the room service food that was poor quality. there are many in site restaurants, spectacular views, is near the Mall. To many people in the pool so go early in the morning. ,"
,,Great view but very crowded,3.0,,We decided to join a Singapore night tour that included the Skypark. Once navigated our way from the bus and into the hotel lifts to the Skypark I knew how cattle feel when they are herded through yards!! Once we popped out into the Skypark the views were spectacular and many interesting photos were taken but we had a tour guide who kept us moving as we had to get into the extended line-up for the lifts to get back down. If you don't like crowds and hustle and bustle don't go to the Skypark!!
,,One of the world's Iconic views,4.0,,"This now rivals the view of Hong Kong Island from Kowloon. But to really appreciate it, you have to go into the infinity pool - & you can only do this if you are a hotel guest. The hotel is worth a visit just to experience this."
,,No way! Not worth the price!,1.0,,"Sometimes I don’t mind paying for a very cool attraction but this was not one of those occasions. The price is associated with the name of the high rent district building. No seating, no Wi-Fi, no refreshments but just a limited and crowded view; I don’t think so. Never again and if I were you, I’d stay away and go get a nice meal by the river somewhere."
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,This is a bit pricey but offers the best views of the city. We went at 9.30am on a Sunday and things weren't very busy - no ticket queues or queues for the lift up to the viewing area.
,,Go After Sunset.,5.0,,Go After Sunset and u will experience nothing like it before. Just amazing view of entire singapore. Cost SGD23/person
,,Lookout,3.0,,"It's easily accessible and $23.00 Singapore dollars per adult. The deck is a large space with information about the city around the rails so you can identify landmarks.it gives a stunning view of the city. There is not much shade and the city is warm and humid so 15 mins up there was enough. Would I do it agin ?probably not but if you have time and money to burn sure go for it.as $50.00 ish to
Look at a city for two adults is a bit dear."
,,View is amazing,3.0,,"Nice view, but limited to part of the roof. You can walk around and make some pictures. Swimmingpool is not accessible and only for hotel guests. High price for a nice view."
,,Good view at a cost.,2.0,,"We were amazed at this building and couldn't wait to visit the Skypark, but it was a bit of a let down. The views are brilliant but you only need 10 to 20 minutes up there and I'm not sure that it is really value for money."
,,An average attraction - way over priced,3.0,,"Visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark after several recommendations. We had to queue to get in, and the elevator took us to the Roof top bar, which I found overpriced and below average"
,,Expensive views of Singapore,3.0,,"$23 per person is expensive to see views of Singapore, spectacular views though they may be. We had a couple of beers drink and club sandwich for $80!!! Pretty pricey place. The whole place is pretty amazing though."
,,Quite expensive now - go up One Altitude instead!,3.0,,"Believe it or not, there are better views in Singapore for less cost. To the average public, access to the skylark is only by going to the viewing platform which is a segregated section. There are other ways of getting to the top, like being a resident at the hotel or hitting the night club. However, if a view is what you seek, head elsewhere to One Altitude or the Swiss hotel for better and cheaper views. Still, for what it is, the Marina Bay Sands is quite stunning and unique amongst cities."
,,Nice view!,5.0,,We went up for a drink (around €30 with VAT and service included) and it was great! Nice atmosphere and great view! Go around sunset and stay a little before dinner.
,,Utterly Overrated,3.0,,"While recently attending a conference at the Marina Bay Convention Center and anxious to enjoy the view, I made it a point to ascend to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. From the moment I arrived on deck, my experience was micromanaged to death. For the fee paid, the food was severely lacking and the pour of my cocktail conspicuously contrasting with elegance of the Conrad Centennial. The view, however, was exceptional."
,,"You can't miss this, being in Singapore !!!",5.0,,"The ticket to the Skypark is expensive, but the view from here is worth 10,000 Dollars! Unique, superb!!!. Hope you are lucky to have a good and clear weather, that is important."
,,Had a walk around ....unreal,5.0,,"Got an hour to walk all around this amazing building crowds of people , decor very nice , fantastic shops there we had a drink on rooftop bar views where 365 of city, fantastic views glad I went up , well worth a look"
,,Looks good,4.0,,Good way to enter the shopping area from the Gardens by the Bay. It looks impressive even though we didn't try the bar late at night. Most of the hotels around Marina Bay have pretty good city views and cocktail bars. I'm not in to Casino life but have been told it's good with free drinks all night.
,,"Gotta give it a go at least once,",5.0,,"Went to the skybar at the top and can see the city lifghts. Really enjoyed our time and would love to definitely visit again. Everything else is quite expensive, so make sure to really enough in your wallet."
,,Breath taking view at the roof top.,5.0,,Came here for a wedding reception of a friend. The view was amazing. It is indeed a perfect spot to celebrate an intimate occasion as it feels romantic. The staff service was good . And would love to go back when I can.
,,Worth taking the lifts for the view,5.0,,We took the lift up to have a drink at the rooftop bar. Fantastic view over Singapore (drinks expensive). But you can take the lift and just look out over the view if you wish.
,,expensive but gotta do even once if you can,5.0,,"we loved this place, went to the sky bar on the very top magic to see the city from this height, Singapore is a magical place when evening falls, the beautiful lights in all directions, food very very expensive up here though"
,,What a great view,4.0,,We didn't stay at the Marina Bay Sands however we took the time to visit this amazing facility. Free lifts take you to the top of this great building where you can experience the most amazing views of Singapore
,,Awesome view,5.0,,awesome view. a good romantic place to be with your partner and spend some quality evening. plan on a day when weather is kind.
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,This was part of my Singapore by night tour. Definitely the highlight - the views were out of this world - especially at night. Not the Skypark's fault but it does get very crowded. I certainly would recommend seeing the views from up there.
,,Top Of Singapore,5.0,,This is a bar with the swimming pool on top of the hotel. Its just wonderful view to experience especially with the swimming pool on top of the hotel. But entry fee is bit pricey but still worth it.
,,Splendid view,5.0,,Though i was not staying at the hotel but visited skypark to have a bird eye view of the city. It was worth it and in much way better than the Singapore flyer. Had an amazing view for good shots with some good music.
,,Skypark amazing views,5.0,,Went up to the Skypark as part of an evening tour so didn't have as much time as I would have liked but the views are incredible especially lit up at night. Don't miss this!!!
,,An interesting perspective of Singapore,5.0,,"I have been to the Skypark twice - once for Ku De Ta, and the other for Sky at 57. The view is awesome, both day and night. It would be good to go with someone who can explain briefly what you can see from up there, or read up a little about the past and future plans of the area, as it would help you appreciate the vast development that will be taking place around the area in the near future.. or, just go and enjoy the breath taking view!"
,,Good views,3.0,,Great views over the city but nothing special. If you are not a guest at the hotel you have very Limited space to look out over.
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"The view is amazing from every angle, no matter what age you must do this. Quite pricey just to get to top though at $63 sing Dollars for 2 adults and 1 child"
,,Night view of the city,4.0,,"Enjoyed a pre dinner cocktail at the Sky bar, taking in the Singapore skyline at night. A very up market location, with a pleasant atmosphere for all to enjoy. Other thing to note was the DJ 'Mindy', who kept us thoroughly entertained."
,,Fabulous view from The Top,5.0,,"Was there in the evening and we enjoyed such a fabulous view of Singapore. They had an infinity pool and since it was cold, I did not get to enjoy it but the view was
absolutely amazing which adds to the thrill of swimming.

We did not take a dip but we enjoyed having drinks up there."
,,Top of the World,5.0,,The Hotel with its amazing architecture the imposing cruise liner on top of the 3 towers is plush and the infinity pool makes one feel like one is at the edge of the world. The view is panoromic and the service star class
,,"Amazing view, but a bit overpriced",3.0,,"Note the viewing area is a very small section of the roof. The view is genuinely unbeatable, but i felt a little ripped off paying so much to only have a very small section of the roof available to explore."
,,Must Visit...great view of Singapore !!!,5.0,,"A must visit place if you like to capture Singapore through your lenses...the tickets are bit expensive at $22 per person.

I had been there twice, once with friends and second with family...stunning views...Gardens By the Bay, Merlion, Flyer...you can view the pool and garden on the other side, but you are not allowed unless you are staying in the hotel.

Apply lot of sunscreen as it will be too hot during noon....you will not be allowed during heavy rains and there is no refund...there is a small shop selling drinks, ice cream and souvenirs."
,,Travellgalore,4.0,,Got mouth opened due to Hyper love it. WONDERER of multi nation came and having relaxing moment the day of walking by the bay.
,,OK visit,4.0,,The views are amazing from the top but overall it was a bit disappointing. The hotel itself is very crowded. Would not go again.
,,What a ciew,4.0,,We didn't know whether to go here as we had heard you had to pay. But if you just want to see the view you can go up to the 57th floor and see the beautiful view clear as day for free! Absolutely amazing.
,,Wow,5.0,,"I don't normally like to go in a lift but had to go up 57 floors to get to the top of this hotel and walk around the Skypark ( boat at the top ). You can't go around the garden nor the infinity pool unless you are staying in the hotel, but the view from the 57th floor over Singapore was absolutely fantastic. It's definitely a place to visit, the views are stunning. There is a small shop selling drinks, ice cream and souvenirs and on the 58th level you can get into the bar and restaurant. Definitely worth a visit."
,,My profile pic from here,5.0,,"This is an amazing structure, from my hotel, then end of the building looks to have a ship on it, and the interior is hollow"
,,Too crowded,4.0,,This is probably a place for children a good place for families and just a good place to spend time especially in the early evenings when the weather isn't as hot!!! It's an interesting building it's probably one of the most buildings that I have ever seen that is so interesting to me I love it I really enjoyed being here! It's extremely picturesque ~ and it's a great way to waste time on a slow day I recommend going on Sunday it's not as busy
,,Outstanding views,4.0,,Good to get an overview of the city from this vantage point. I felt the tickets were a bit expensive at $22 per person. Especially if a family like us. A very good bar and restaurant if you'd like to make more of a night of it. Try to go up at dusk then you get the day & night view.
,,Nice view. Too expensive,4.0,,"Nice view of the bay, but it cost too much only for view the area from 56th floor. There is no way to go to the swimming pool unless you guest in the hotel. High prices for the memory gift goods. You can buy the same staff also from the market in half price."
,,Singapore Trip,3.0,,"We were a bit disappointed with this as you only get to go on the front part of the ship. But the view is great. Probably not really worth the cost, but we wanted to have a look."
,,Great at night.,5.0,,"We got up to the park as it was just turning dusk. The views are breathtaking. We waited for the dark and the buildings displayed lots of lights. The trees in the gardens on the bay did a musical light show which could be seen easily.
The drinks were costly for Singapore"
,,Beautiful Architecture,5.0,,You can see this place while you are near Merlion. Excellent architecture increases the beauty of Marina Bay.
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"As a hotel I would not rate it very highly, but as a tourist attraction its great with its amazing architecture and views from the Skypark."
,,Not a swimming pool,3.0,,"The pool is definitely only to enjoy the view from the 57th floor.
It is not possible to swim as it is too crowded, unless you go there very early in the morning.
When arriving in the afternoon it is nearly impossible to find a pool chair, as the look all occupied due to towels lying around.
Furthermore there are no pool attendants who could allocate you chairs. Disappointing fact!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Went up at night to see the city all lit up and what a site. Great way to view the gardens by the bay all lit up at night as well as the city. Good 20 dollars.
,,Great Artwork!,5.0,,"It's not a building, it's an artwork. The marina, bay, tropical plant, blue sky, clear blue water, anything is beautiful there, just go and enjoy it. And suggest walk from here to ECP(East Coast Park) Area D, and enjoy the seafood at Jumbo Restraurant, hahaha."
,,The grand facade,4.0,,The beautiful architecture of this building is just enough to watch. Gorgeous and standing tall. Lots of activities going in and around the building. The building is a photographer's delight to take photos from different angles and different directions. The view also is different from day and night. Lovely place to spend sometime there. Lots of walking is needed. A bit tiring for elders.
,,On top of the world,5.0,,The Skypark is definitely a must see. Views from all around. Down to the gardens. Across the city. Swimming in the most unique pool on top of Singapore is amazing.
,,Great hotel experience!,5.0,,"Nice service and great view. A bit too expensive at certain seasons (Feb, July, August is crazy). Best swimming pool view."
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,"If you want the best possible view of Singapore without actually taking off, this is it. Whilst it is not cheap, the view is spectacular. I recommend getting up there before sunset if you can so that you get daylight and night views."
,,Nice view to cool off,5.0,,"I would never miss this place when traveling to sing,nice view to see and awesome in the nite cos we can see lots of beatiful citylights.
This place is also connected with garden by the bay(though my feet were killing me to walk to garden by the bay ha ha)
And nice foodcourt in the ground floor,but for weekend it s hard to get the seat.
And also we can see the F1 track from here"
,,breathtaking walk,5.0,,"A friend of mine actually took my bf and I to this area and we actually loved it! Great place to walk around. At night, lasers showcase various features along the marina."
,,Don't pay to go to the Sky Park,4.0,,"Fantastic views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel but don't pay, ask to go to the Bar at the top, same views without the cost, use the money you saved on a drink."
,,Marvelous Bay Sands,4.0,,"I'm unable to rate the internal n terrace parts, as I didn't go up. Nevertheless, from the outset the structure is awesome n fabulous. Technology coupled with hardwork could be seen fm outside. Great work, Singaporeans."
,,Singapore at your feet!,4.0,,"We went all the way up to the Skypark and the view is amazing! You have the whole city at your feet, you can see the skyscrapers, the gardens etc. The view is simply stunning and a must do when you are in Singapore!"
,,Very luxury !,1.0,,"Oh my God! Its really amazing , see the luxury shops inside. I felt missing my home town so much . Hahha! Anyway it brought me different side of life. Nice to see. Thank you!"
,,Fantastic city views,5.0,,"A must do when visiting Singapore. Amazing views, superb restaurants, and great photo opportunities await the keen traveller."
,,If you want a fantastic view ....,5.0,,What a great place to visit and get a fantastic view of the bay and city. Would also recommend having tea and amazing cakes in the hotel.
,,Not a Must Go Attraction,3.0,,"As a paid attraction , you are only allowed to the Viewing Deck of Bay Sands, as you cannot access the infinity pool. the cost of only the Deck view is more than 30$ which is not great. maybe high price is charged to keep the flock of tourists away. If you really just want to view the Singapore Skyline , best free option is a Walk around the bay , or better take the Night Boat Cruise, which is ticketed. Not coming to skypark, the view from Top is not out of the world , if you have seen high rise building in other parts of world."
,,Seems like a fast food processing place,2.0,,"I really didn't like that as soon as you present your tickets they try to shove you in front of a green screen to snap digital phots of you so that when you get to the top of the building 45 seconds later you have two employees touting to spend money for a 'digital photo' package in a cheap leather frame. That insults my intelligence, my good taste and shows a complete lack of manners. If I hadn't been with a friend who was taking a real delight in being there I would have thrown the tickets in their collective faces and walked out. Really made me feel like I was nothing more than tourist fodder to be shoved through the system as fast as they could manage it while getting as much money out of me as they could."
,,Amazing Hotel.,5.0,,"All four of us (Senior Citizens) from Perth had a lovely dinner in The Harbor Rise Restaurant, we were attended to by 2 very Excellent Waiting Staff, Kumar & Ruby,Thankyou.. very polite & friendly people. We really enjoyed our meals. We went up in Tower 1 & enjoyed the views, A special thanks to Paul in the Bar on 57th floor.."
,,well casino royale,5.0,,well this place is well known for the hosting of the zee cine awards and the casinos mostly for rich people and the nearby adjacent mall open for all
,,good views,5.0,,"A little expensive to go up to look, but still worth a look, view is great and there are refreshments up there, again not cheap"
,,Beautiful Building with Breath-taking Views,5.0,,"Went to the Skybar and had a few drinks... the view was incredible and totally worth the trip! It is free to go to the SkyBar but you do have to buy drinks... the bartender was friendly and the service was excellent! The music was perfect and although the bar section is small, all the other patrons were friendly - especially when you wanted to get to the edge to take pics of the skyline.
It was definitely a bucket list event ... one I will never forget!"
,,Not to miss,5.0,,Well if you wanna see Singapore at Night-pls go here-whn with kids-you can show how Singapore looks amazingly beautiful at night-pls do go-you will rememmber!
,,Post Baltic Cruise,4.0,,We visited the shopping area all with expensive stores. In the shopping area there were canals with Venice theme similar to Macau. We also visited the casino. The place was excellent to visit in the hot weather. We had yum char lunch.
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"This view is great! I can have an overview of central Singapore from there. However, it would be recommended if service provider gives tourists a small free picture as souvenir (I/o charging them $25) since the price is quite high in comparison with other places"
,,Grand and Perfect Symbolic Building For Defining A Well Developed Nation,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a very grand and stylish building designed which allows you to have a bird eye view of the whole of Singapore.

However, if you are not the inhouse guests, but external visitors just to pay to go up to the skypark, you are confined to a limited area for the view only and you won't be able to enjoy much facilities offered up there. Only in house guest will have the priviledge to enjoy all the facilities up there."
,,On Top of Singapore,5.0,,"Whoa!!! Is first thing to say. Before visiting the rooftop from afar you could see what appeared to be people on the top. Which I said, ""good for them... Must be nice to be in the penthouse."" When my wife said we are going there I was like what?!!!. Heights are not my thing but I could not travel all the way there and chicken out. You ride an elevator up to the 56th floor. The elevator was so quiet and fast I was able to get my nerves together. Once the elevator arrives you don't step right out on the roof so once again you can settle into it. Once out on the deck the site is unbelievable. I would recommend doing this during the day because picture taking became harder in the dark. I imagine sunsets would be great. Also, it cost to get up to the lookout but there is a bar / restaurant up there that can only be accessed thru hotel elevators. Not sure if there is a minimum limit to spend in restaurant but view can be enjoyed as well from there and at least with that cost you get drinks/food."
,,"Great view, but to high price.",4.0,,"The sky parks offers a very detailed look over whole Singapore. From the north to the south you can see (almost) everything. The only problem is the very expensive price to pay for ""just a panoramic scenery""."
,,Two night stay over in Singapore,4.0,,"Worth a look and as suggested by others. Take the lift to the bar on the 57th floor as its free. However, you do need to by a drink and a beer is $16 plus tax, we opted to treat ourselves to a cocktail at $25 plus tax and sit and sip whilst enjoying the view."
,,Night out in singapore,5.0,,"Stunning views from the top, stunning musical fountain show, beautiful hotel, massive casino, coffee, tea, soft drinks all free in the casino with a huge smoking section. Free to foreigners, but you need to produce your passport. Romantic boat cruise"
,,Do not miss,5.0,,"This is a place that you don't want to miss. The architect is Mosher Safdie, the same architect tha design Habitat 67 in Montréal."
,,Wonderful place,5.0,,"It has a wonderful view on the city, many nice restaurants and bars, special shop and amazing swimming pool (only for hotel guests). For me, this place is the main (and the only) reason to stay at Marina Bay Sands."
,,Long queue waiting time,3.0,,"Always have a long queue for restaurants especialy Friday, Sat and Sun. Plan your trip to sands in weekdays."
,,Splendid Light and watershow,5.0,,"The marina sand bay is really outstanding at night. The watershow is great. Make sure you are there in time, it was very crowded when we were there. And the rest of the environment is worth a walk, it is amazing."
,,Best hotel in Singapore!,5.0,,"Great rooms, shopping centre below and infinity pool on roof. What's not to like? Excellent transfer from airport."
,,Expensive tickets but good views,4.0,,"At 23 SGD per person (adult) access to the observation deck is not cheap.

I would possibly recommend instead booking a table at the Cé La Vie restaurant, in which case you are granted free access to the Skypark and can enjoy the same views.

If it is too windy the observation deck may close at short notice."
,,"Wonderful infinite pool, except sometimes too crowded",4.0,,"Great infinity pool, but still too crowded in summer holiday。City view, day or night, is spectacular。Without a changing room, one need to find someway to cover his swimsuit when going up, and return from the pool。"
,,spectacular,5.0,,beautiful..stunning..worth it.. nothing but great things to say here. Singapore is known for its great buildings and infrastructures and this can be said as the heart of Singapore. Everything is within walking distance here and for the view its priceless!
,,Sky park,5.0,,If you visit Singapore you must visit marina bay sands sky park. It's near to Singapore flyer and don't forget we must go on night . We can enjoy to see laser show on night time.
,,great height,3.0,,great height to see the view. quite a small viewing area. short waiting time. fast lift to the highest level.
,,Best views in Singapore,5.0,,"Have cocktails and a snack on Floor 57. Amazing views over Marina Bay, Financial District, parks and sea etc. Good service and very friendly without having to be a resident. You can do this without buying a visitor pass for Floor 56."
,,Amazing laser and water show,4.0,,"Went for cocktails and to see the sunset. Unfortunately the sky was misty but equally spectacular was the different colours the sky went through as night drew in. Simply stunning. The laser show was very good, as was the show in the water. Lovely way to spend an evening."
,,Have a drink at ce la vie,3.0,,We skipped the skypark and had a drink at ce la vie instead as recommended on this site. Still good views of the city and beyond though I'm not sure what we missed from the skypark but with two drinks it was still cheaper than entry for two.
,,Nice photo op,3.0,,Nice place to take a photo and then leave. There is nothing to do and besides the beautiful architecture of the building its a pretty boring spot unless your interested in very high end shopping.
,,view plus frozen Singapore Sling,5.0,,We went on a Sunday night (at almost 10pm) and the weather was just perfect because rain/drizzle has just stopped. We bought ourselves the frozen Singapore Sling and sat on the floor to enjoy the view. It was a fun night chatting and laughing with friends and time flew fast.
,,76th floor view,4.0,,"U get to c d city, gardens by the bay n flyer from.. nothing very special as u get almost the same type of view from Flyer still it needs to b experienced. Sunset time good to b there."
,,A Wonder of the World,5.0,,U cannot visit Singapore without visiting this major landmark. Drinks & food rather expensive but worth it. Views unbelievable.
,,top of the world!,5.0,,very high on the top has a infinity pool for residents had meal on fabulous veranda night club on the top residents have special areas but what a view 360 overlooks sea amazing very expensive and very busy but fast lift!
,,Crowded!!,3.0,,"The skypark was disappointing for me mainly because it was so crowded. There are people sitting on the ground all along the glass which make it difficult if you want to take a look or click a few pictures. I did not think the experience matched the ticket price.

Crowd control is also a huge issue and the staff seemed to have their hands full directing people to stand in lines or filling them into elevators.

Tip: Don't get enticed to buy the pics that are photoshopped to look like you're standing at the skypark. No one's pics look like that in real life and everyone will know you photoshopped yours :)"
,,Unusual rendez-vous,5.0,,We met up with some friends to have a couple of drinks visiting the Skypark. Of course it's an impressive location. You enjoy a drink with friends whilst taking in some of the most stunning views of the Singapore skyline. There's little else which can beat that if you wish for an original pastime. Loved it.
,,Very disappointed,1.0,,Paid to go and see a view. No seating available at the top. Advertises refreshments but unless you are a guest at the hire you have no where available to eat. Not worth the money.
,,Good Food Court,4.0,,The food court offers great range of foods at reasonable price. Good if you do not have a lot of time in Singapore.
,,Nice View,5.0,,"Aha ha Really Nice view from Skypark.I really enjoyed,Better to go evening (after 6pm).you will feel that you are in the heaven."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"A must to see. Make sure you book and stay at the hotel to experience it all, including the pool. You can get to the pool unless you are a guest . Have a cocktail or breakfast by the pool and soak up the ambience."
,,Not a park!!!,3.0,,"if you have the opportunity to stay in a hotel with high floors, never try skypark. it's not a park, it's just a small part of a roof of a tower. it definitely isn't worth 23$."
,,Great,5.0,,"Such an impressive view we went in the evening and thought it was great, definitely worth the time for some wonderful photos"
,,Vacation,4.0,,"A BEAUTIFUL view of the city, bay, & ocean. It costs to go to the top, but get you camera ready. Your able to pinpoint many attractions in the city. If security is nice, you may even get a glimpse of the swimming pool on top of the hotel. It's BEAUTIFUL..."
,,Great views in every direction,5.0,,"Great for a drink at night however, be aware that only hotel guests can swim in the infinity pool. Drinks are very expensive here, admission is at the lobby Tower 3."
,,Best,5.0,,"A beautiful view of Singapore. You must visit marina bay region. You can actually spare a whole evening for the region. Covee gardens by the bay, follow by light and laser show and visit the grand Marina Bay Hotel's skypark."
,,Great view,4.0,,Following a tip from a fellow Tripadviser we took the lift to Floor 57 C'est la vie instead of paying to go to Floor 56. The view was great and we enjoyed a cocktail with the view.
,,Great viewing,5.0,,We went up in the lift in the evening to view the light show and it was extremely busy. The views are spectacular but I feel a little expensive especially if you are family.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,Was here in October last year what a great pula to visit went in the evening time then went to. The top were there is a cocktail bar the views was brilliant but be aware the drinks are very expensive 4 drinks (alcohol) £45 but your paying for the view
,,Must visit unbelievable views,4.0,,"The skypark caters for those looking to chill out in the pool out of the Singapore heat. The infinity pool is amazing. Nothing will be better. The skydeck bar is absurdly priced. $25 for a corona etc. Mixed drink $28.00 sg. So be aware and dont say first shout! There is a nightclub. Great fun.very mixed crowd. Very expensive. Must have long pants, jeans etc. If staying at MBS the skydeck is a must.."
,,Best rooftop pool,4.0,,"Of course the rooftop pool is the draw and it does not disappoint. The rooms at this property are very modern, extremely nice with exceptional views. The only negative I could say would be the drinks are way over priced...similar to other high end properties in Singapore. Other than that, Marina Bay Sands is a must see for the world traveler."
,,"Amazing view, but that's all",3.0,,"Taking advice from another TripAdvisor user, we chose not to pay for just a view. We asked to go to the bar and got the view for free. It's a gorgeous view from the top but really is just a view. At night it is breathtaking. I would definitely recommend going however ask to go up to the bar rather than pay, the bar and restaurant isn't cheap but ok for one drink.

Easy to get to :)"
,,Wonderful view of downtown!,4.0,,"We wanted to sit down and have a drink, but didn't make any planning ahead. So when we got there, there's a line for seats, but we realized to get a decent seat close enough for the view would be a bit impossible...so we ended up walking around the skypark wherever its open for us, toke some photos then left. But truly wonderful view of downtown. Highly suggest better planning and make a reservation ahead."
,,a Must see,5.0,,We hi sited the sky Park after dark which was amazing. The 360 degree view of Singapore with breath taking views. The hotel itself is a marvel of engineering and beautiful to look at. The negative s are: It took a long time to get down from the sky Park and the souvenir picture is unreasonably expensive. They wanted $20 for the printed picture and another additional $25 for them to email you the picture. As someone who has to travel across the globe to go home I was not even interested in the hard copy and I don't think one picture worth $45.
,,Amazing Building,5.0,,This is definitely worth a look. We stayed at the hotel last month so I'm not sure how much this costs for entry. There is a restaurant bar called Ce la vi at the top. Expensive drinks but you can't beat a sundowner here for the view.
,,One heck of a view,5.0,,Visit this. Do it. It's an amazing view! Don't pay the premiums to get up to the top though. Have a search around the bottom and wing it. You can get a lift (elevator for my American/Canadian friends) to the bar at the top. You can buy a drink up there which will be the same price as the 'trips' up there you can book. Highly recommended though!
,,Perfectly self contained bubble!,5.0,,"Simply put: this place is great. Everything that you need, rooms well appointed, the view and ambiance from Level 57 Skypark as good as everyone says. The place is busy but somehow it doesn't feel that crowded. Had a dinner at Adrift. Magic. Would love to retune and spend some time on a poolside lounger!"
,,The best view of the city,5.0,,"its a steep $23 dollars for a view of the city, but the view is too god to be missed. I suggest going around dusk time so that you can see the city in light, and stay back for some time till it is completely dark. Not just the view of waterfront, but what takes your breath away is the garden by the bay- all lit up in night."
,,Fantastic city view!! - must visit!!,4.0,,The skypark offers a lovely view of the city across the marina bay and across the east on the other side. It is a fantastic view point and a must visit for anyone. The views speak for themselves. This would also be best visited at sunset as you can see the city change and light up in front of your eyes!!
,,"Pricey, but SO worth it!",5.0,,"If you are wanting to capture the PERFECT panorama of the beautiful city of Singapore then this is definitely a must! The experience is incredible. Unfortunately when we were there, it was very overcast and was sprinkling a little, but regardless, the views remained stunning. I would definitely recommend making the most of your time while you are up there, as the ticket does not have a set length of time that you must adhere to - you are able to spend as long as you like there. We spent about 45mins there and went during the afternoon, around 3pm. Definitely a spontaneous, but worthwhile experience!"
,,Superb view,4.0,,"Had been to the observation deck, magnificent 360 view from 56 stories up. Less crowded around 8 to 9, good time to visit during the day probably would be 6 or 7 eve, you could see the sunset"
,,Amazing skypark,5.0,,the place is the most luxury place. view at the sky park is such as amazing .the most enjoyful lifetime
,,What a view! What a location!,5.0,,"Although a huge hotel it is a great place to stay in Singapore.

The staff by the pool were the staff we most encountered and they were always delightful and surprisingly would remember us. Obviously the pool is the big draw card of the hotel but the rooms are spacious and very comfortable. We have stayed in a number of different rooms including a suite and they are all equally lovely. A view over the Gardens or the City is great too."
,,Sky bar with a perfect view,5.0,,Its a most go place with incredible view of whole city from a roof top. Just go for a couple of drink and enjoy the view. i'll bet you gonna start loving this city from the day you stepped in.
,,Pool with a view,5.0,,"Stayed for long weekend and had an incredible time. We had a beautiful suite on the 53rd floor. What a view! I have nothing but compliments for the room, it was huge! And as for the pool. Wow. Incredible! To lie on a lounger in the water overlooking the Singapore skyline is unbeatable. It's an experience in itself. It's such an amazing building and even better than the photos! Highly recommend for a spoiling treat."
,,Amazing Views!,5.0,,"Family of 5 came up for the evening. Entrance was quite expensive but the views of the city were amazing (husband thinks not worth it). The lady on the bottom floor (where you buy tickets) was extremely rude. We were told at the beginning that our young son didnt need a ticket but the lady at the lift insisted that we did. Which wasn't a problem, we were happy to go back and pay, her rudeness was not appreciated."
,,Great rooftop panorama. Must visit,5.0,,Romantic rooftop can see allover SG. Must visit. Panorama scene. Have a bar at rooftop. Whole day access.
,,Magnificent swimming pool and city view,5.0,,One of the life time experience at infinity pool. Magnificent marina bay view from above. There are three bar and others restaurants to enjoy the evening chills in Singapore style!
,,A must activity in Singapore!,5.0,,"went here with my family last July 12, 2016. Everyone needs to experience going to the skypark as it gives a 360 degrees panorama of it surrounding areas. from here you can see the garden by the bay, singapore river, the port and everything around it. A must do attraction for everyone!"
,,Chocolate and Cheese Buffet,5.0,,"Chocolate and Cheese Buffet, need I say more. A great treat after drinks and a light dinner, try the Elephant Coffee for the full lux experience."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Highlight of my stay. Nothing beats the view! Absolute relaxation sipping on a drink taking in the skyline at sunset
,,Too good to be true,5.0,,Fantastic view and great pool. The view is fabulous. The best view of singapore. Do not forget to bring your swimming attire. Because even if you do not how to swim the babes and the pool will make you want to swim.
,,Views forever,5.0,,The view from the top is amazing. Having time to walk around and take in the sights is great. Kiosk for a drink and souvenirs.
,,Sky dwelling.,5.0,,"To go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands complex is an unforgettable experience. The views are far ranging, the architecture impressive and there are places to wine and dine. It is expensive- four of us with a couple of drinks each and a small snack cost $200 - but it is stunning. There is a swimming pool up there too but with the amount of bodies immersed I cannot say that it is hygienic!"
,,Skip the line for SkyPark...go up to 57th floor for free,4.0,,"We wanted to take in the view from atop the Sands and were told it would be $22 to go up the elevator to the SkyPark observation deck on the 56th floor. However, we were told we could go up to the 57th floor bar...More"
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Really worth going up for the amazing views. We paid just to visit the observation deck and it was quite expensive - worth seeing if you can visit via another route eg Ce La Vi restaurant and bar
,,Lunch on the boat,4.0,,"We had lunch at the top of tower 2 excellent service, food and view. however you have to book. Well worth the effort."
,,Wonderful !!! 😍,4.0,,Good Experience with children ... Yes too much to walk with the group but what a tremendous view from there up ! It was so exciting and clicking photo became like a hobby there ! I liked it :-) but couldnt love it ;-)
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"I've been to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark several times and I love it! Great views everywhere, a must do! You need to allow an hour to enjoy it..,"
,,"Wow ,panaromic view",5.0,,My first wedding anniversary was truly glamorized by such an awesome place.must visit once on your special day
,,Infinity Pool on the 57th Floor!,5.0,,Started with lunchtime drinks and snacks on the top floor with a fab view...really great views and no stuffiness about not staying there
,,Great views,4.0,,Had dinner with a couple of clients - pretty reasonable priced - food was nice and a good selection. Views of the City were stunning
,,Great views from the top.,3.0,,The building is impressive and looks like a ship built atop two high rise towers. It is a hotel foremost so entry to the top floor has restrictions but you can either pay to go to the top or go and have a meal or...More
,,What a view!,4.0,,"It was lovely to enjoy the gentle breeze, watch the light show and enjoy the vista from the Skypark."
,,Fantastic views!,4.0,,We took the elevator up to the restaurant which is one floor above the sky park. We had high tea up here and it was fantastic- although a little warm as you have to eat outside. You don't have to pay the $21 each to the sky park if you go up here and just have a drink. Views were excellent and well worth a look.
,,View to Die for,5.0,,"Amazing View over Singapore. Easy to access, with express elevator to the top. Spend the money, buy the ticket, don't miss out."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Worth getting a drink at the Ce La Vie bar right at the top of the building for the views. Laser show no good from here though.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Amazing views, expensive but worth the visit - I'm scared of heights but was convinced by husband to do it and it was totally worth it! Shame only guests can use the swimming pool!"
,,Overhyped,1.0,,Only place in singapore which we felt was not worth seeing... not worth the ticket price... as whole view can be enjoyed from flyer... just skip it...
,,"Great views, a little bit pricey.",3.0,,"We went up to the Skypark at about 6:30 pm to see the City by both day and night. We initially joined the wrong queue inside the Tower which turned out to be for the Bar and Restaurant. The queue for the Skypark deck itself was one floor down an escalator. Although it was a Saturday, there were 1000s of people about and it was just coming up to dusk the queue to buy the tickets only took about 10 minutes as did the queue for the lift.
There were lots of people on the deck (watch out for the selfie-sticks!) but we still managed to find space to take photos.
As others have mentioned there are no seats on the deck so your legs can get a little tired standing and walking; there was also a queue to get the lift back down although this moved along fairly quickly."
,,landmark,5.0,,"apparently this was newly built recent years in Singapore, and it becomes the 2nd landmark of Singapore (other than the Merlion). But it indeed an enormous building and you could pay to go up to the 75th floor for whole view of singapore from the top!"
,,Somewhat disappointing,3.0,,"Silly me, I should have checked, but the skypark is not the entire length of the structure, it's just a really small portion of the structure at the top. That said, it is in fact, the best part of the view - you get the skyline, the Singapore Flyer, and Gardens By The Bay View, so it is beautiful. It was suggested to us that we go up at 6:30 in the evening to catch both the sunset and the night-time view. However, I would suggest that you go up by around 5:30 so that there is sufficient light falling on the gardens by the Bay for good photography.

Also, on Saturday, which is when we went, there was also firework displays by the stadium in the distance. That took place around 8:15 p.m."
,,So what?,1.0,,"23dollars for being squeezed on the smallest part of the structure without even somewhere to sit. At this price it's way better to stay in the hotel, at least you can enjoy the pool."
,,amazing city view,5.0,,"Superb downtown view. GO there in evening, you can see sun setting down behind the downtown skyscrapers. Viewing water front promenade and gardens by the bay from the top is amazing. Stay there till it gets dark to see this glittery city, shiny water front promenade, glowing Esplanade the Durian shaped building and lit up super trees of gardens by the bay. it's quite windy, just grab a corner near railing and sit and just keep eye on this transformation of city as sun goes down."

,,what a view!!!,4.0,,"Skypark was a good place to have in your life.
I went up for twice, for the first time was 12 o'clock in the afternoon, the sun is burning my face and high temp out there, I can't imagine how the people working up there.
so I decided to make a second visit in the night which I can avoid the sun and have a beautiful city view in the night time"
,,Fascinating building and view!,5.0,,"First I was sceptic to visit the 47 level of this building, but when I came up to the roof top it was magnificent and I could stay there for a long time just inhale the view and atmosphere. I regret that I didn't took the possibility to go to the restaurant at the level 48"
,,Most people there take selfies rather than swim,4.0,,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 days and in theory could have used the deck anytime I like, but only went up twice as there were too many people!
Compared with my first trip there in 2011, when people used to just go to adore beautiful bodies, this time all you can see is people take selfies of themselves,and there were barely swimmers. You really need to go there at the right time to enjoy the view and avoid dumpling like tourists.
Walk around the deck and you get a grand overview of this tiny world city, at 720 sqkm as I was told."
,,"Very crowded, pool is a place for selfie not swimming",2.0,,"Very crowded, pool is a place for selfie not swimming can take a look, but don't think there is anything special there.."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"I really love this place. We could see Merlion, Gardens by The Bay, Singapore flyer, etc from the top of the Marina Bay Sands which has the pool on its top. The view was amazing. However, the pool could be entered for the people who stay in the hotel only."
,,Awesome view!!! 😊,4.0,,The view from skypark was really picturesque. We were able to watch the lights show of Gardens by the bay. It's just sad that we were not able to see the pool area because it's exclusive for hotel guests only. But seeing the fantastic view was really worth it.
,,Amazing view from the Terrace Restaurant,5.0,,The view from the top is mind blowing. You can actually see the whole city from there. The food and the drinks were also great.
,,A must when ever I visit,5.0,,"I love MBS, and come for a lychee martini when ever I visit (this time being my 9th to Singapore.) although I wouldn't pay the price to go to the viewing deck, I would suggest finding the entrance to CE LA VI rooftop bar in the hotel lobby, taking the lift up the 57 floors and for the same price having a drink while taking in the same views. Breathtaking."
,,Reaching Sky of Singapore,4.0,,"Attraction is free for the guest of Marina Bay Sands.
We enjoyed this attraction while in stay at Marina Bay Sands.
Denote this place is so beautifully designed to take the most view of Singapore Skyline on one side and Sea on other simultaneously.
Don't forget to take binoculars as earth goes really tiny from viewing point."
,,The best view on Singapore,5.0,,"Welcome to the epitome of Singapore's artificiality. The Skypark is a must visit at any time, for its amazing views, but is particularly enjoyable on a late afternoon - early evening, when the sunset behind the high rise buildings of the Financial District. There is an expensive gift shop that also sells snacks and drinks, but there is nowhere to seat at the Skypark."
,,must see,5.0,,"it is one of the best places to visit in Singapore, you can see almost all Singapore from this deck , its place that you can understand the map of Singapore , the sea and all the commercial ships passing by the bay on a side and the wonderful business waterfront from the other side is a must ."
,,Great view from the lounge,4.0,,"One can easily mesmerised by the view from the top sky garden on the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. As the name entails, the view comes with a price of $20 per entrance. Worth the visit."
,,Good views from a unique building,4.0,,The Marine Bay Sands is an outstanding asset to the Singapore skyline. It offers great views of the city and the surrounding bay. Worth a visit.
,,view worth the visit,5.0,,"the skypark offers awesome 360 degree view of the Singapore skyline on one side, the ocean on the other and the marina bay gardens on one side. The sky line view in the evenings is amazing, especially when the lights come on, same for the bay gardens once the domes as well as the sky trees come alive. must visit during your trip to Singapore ...."
,,The view was stunning!!,5.0,,"Must visit this place!!! Atmosphere was amazing, the view is sensational. The drinks were great!!! Will definitely come back, and a MUST place for any tourist to Singapore. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The view is amazing. It's SGD22 per adult and a bit expensive for kids SGD16. But it's totally worth. Accessible via MRT (train), the Bayfront station has exits to Marina Bay Sands and to the mall opposite.
The area is really nice, The Shoppes (mall), ArtScience museum, Skypark and Gardens by the Bay at the end of the day to enjoy the light show."
,,Sky park viewing is excellent,5.0,,"This hotel sevice is good , bed is comfortable and restaurant dish is tasty and can window view the marina bay . If u are stay in this hotel , u can go to the sky park , the park got many kind of plants and u can view whole marina bay especially on Singapore national day , can view all the firework and aircraft . Is very good to experience for children , adult ."
,,Hotel guest,4.0,,"I was worried that this pool was going to be like a zoo. But actually it was very well run.
We got 4 beds without a problem at 2 p.m the beds were hard without cushions so I found it hard to relax.
To take pictures the sun is better in the morning. All our photos didn't work out and are dark. So go early

The water was the perfect temperature
The menu at the poolside was pathetic
I paid $15 for a bowl of plain lettuce. Because I don't want the chicken in the Caesar salad . The chef was unable to improvise and sent out plain lettuce what a joke
They gave us free drinks after I complained
Chips were good but very limited selection"
,,One word......WOW,5.0,,"There is a lot of wonderful architecture in Singapore, but this one tops the bill. I would love to have watched this being constructed. The skypark is on the 56th floor of the hotel. It is HUGE. The views from up there are incredible. When we walked out on the overhang, we could feel the movement. A little scary. What a feat of engineering!! Loved it!"
,,A pool with a view,4.0,,"The gimmicky infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a place to visit once, but perhaps in this case once is enough. Obviously, it is exciting to be in a pool and gaze at Singapore's magnificent skyline from a great height. The other good thing is that there is an adult part and a children's part, and this rule is effectively enforced. Other than that, it is not really a great pool for a swim, as a selfie paradise the pool is dominated by people holding their mobile phones in all possible angles. Only accessible for hotel guests, you either book a room at the Marina Bay Sands (and I noted rooms are luxurious, bright and clean with excellent bathrooms) or you make sure you know someone who is staying there (one guest allowed to the pool)."
,,Spectacular urban view,5.0,,When my friends visit Singapore I almost always bring them to the skypark. I believe their visit wont be complete without going to this place.
,,"Skypark, no access to the swimming pool area",2.0,,"The access area that is designated for Skypark Patrons is confined to the viewing deck, with no access to the swimming pool area, which I feel is the main reason why many people would pay to go up to have that view/sight/experience."
,,"One of the top tourist spots, great views from bar/lounge",5.0,,"We stayed across the bay from the Marina Bay Sands, however, we did visit the bar lounge at the very top. It has great views of the Bay and the Gardens, very nice cocktails and snacks. Well worth the visit."
,,Worth the visit!,5.0,,This sky garden is definitely worth the visit! The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking and you get an amazing view of the skyline. There is also an amazing mall nearby! You can also get an amazing photo taken of your family!
,,A must see in Singapore,4.0,,"Access to top is about 20 dollars per person. Deceivingly, you do not have access yet to the part with the restaurant and pool under 80 dollars per person."
,,Great place,5.0,,How amazing this place is! A small country with no natural resources can have a great construction. Didn't have enough time to walk around. Will be back soon.
,,Too many tourists,2.0,,"When u allow people up by charging a fee, all sorts of monkeys end up going there. They are noisy, uncouth and not befitting a hotel of this stature. Makes u feel like an exhibit if u r in the pool."
,,There's another place that's free!,3.0,,"I won't write about the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, you can easily google it. I want to tell you about another place that offers panoramic views for FREE!
it is called ION Sky (you can google this also). It is located on the topmost floor of ION Orchard building.
To get there, take the MRT (public train service) to Orchard station, find your way to the 4th floor, then find your way to the elevator, located within an art gallery, that will take you to the top floor. Follow the signages or just ask.
ION Sky is free, Marina Bay Sands Skypark costs $22/$23 adult price (can't remember the exact amount).
Skypark is an open-air place, when it rains, there is nowhere to take shelter, and when it shines, it is hot & humid unless there happens to be a nice sea breeze.
ION Sky is an enclosed, air-conditioned place, so rain or shine, you get to see the views comfortably. And it is a 360 degrees view of the city. it is open daily from 3pm-6pm (last admission: 5.30pm). There will be a queue even before 3pm, so if it's a ""now or never"" visit, be sure to get there way before 5.30pm.
There is a bar & restaurant up there, the place will be closed to public when there is a private function.
However, you get different views at the 2 places (no sea view at ION Sky) so if want, go to both places."
,,the views are incredible,5.0,,We stayed at the hotel so the entry was free (otherwise charged around $20-25) and we enjoyed the views around!
,,Great views,4.0,,It was fun to zoom on up to the 56th floor and check out the Singapore views (not quite 360 degrees but almost). We also stepped on up to 57th floor to the Ce La Vie bar and enjoyed a (rather expensive) beer while continuing to take in the view.
,,"..and you can say ""I've been up there!""",4.0,,"I feel it's overpriced but we still went, my mom wouldn't take the Flyer so I though this is my alternative. We went up at around 4pm, the sky's a bit cloudy so even if we sat down at the deck it was still comfortable. Quite a few people in the elevator talking about the expensive $25 photo souvenir. Make the most out of it, look around, sit down, relax, and appreciate that yeah, you're this high up :) Stop looking through the lens."
,,"Amazing view, but overpriced",4.0,,"I had to take my family up there, otherwise i would have left out the highlight at the end of a singapore family trip. The view in the evening allows you to summarise your stay at this vibrant and very very interesting city. The view from up there is a must. But not at htat price. I dont think the hotel really needs those ticket prices that bad. For a 4 member family it hurts. It spoiled my experience a bit."
,,Great views,5.0,,"We used this facility as part of our accommodation at Marina Bay Sands. The park offers great spas, a park area and swimming pool. The views are great especially from the infinity pool. A selfie stick is a must to get that great photo in the pool with the city in the background. The only downside is the pool really needs to be heated as I found it quite cool."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,Very hot on top of promenade in July - make sure have a hat and shoes are required by management. Not much shade but spectacular views from top. Open from 9 - 10 daily. We paid $23 (adult) each. Pool on top is only available for hotel guests.
,,VERY BORING: JUST ANOTHER MALL,1.0,,Very very very very very BORING. Just another mall with clean toilets and very very overpriced foods!! Plus a money sucking casino!!
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"We nearly didn't bother going but on our last night went to watch the sunset, it was busy, but even this did not detract from the fantastic views and overall experience. We spent about an hour watching all the lights come on as the sun set, it is quite magical."
,,What a view!,5.0,,The skybar towers above the rest of Singapore with amazing 360 view Pay entry fee if not a resident of the hotel but one free cocktail and canapés and the view is so worth it!
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"Getting on the top of this building is a thrilling experience for everyone. From the top, you can see almost the whole of Singapore. Even Paya Lebar airport can be clearly seen in the distance. I can only imagine that this spot would have been a great place to watch Formula 1 race, as its pitstop is located just underneath it."
,,Good veiwing place,4.0,,"Well worth the entry fee. Get there early as it can get crowded. We went to the viewing platform and this gives great views across the city and the harbour and the gardens. Very hot in the lift on the way up and they tend to cram you in but is quite cool at the top. We got off at the underground stop and walked up through the gardens, very easy to find."
,,Expensive but great view,4.0,,"It is costly to go up and the entrance was hard to find at first, its outside the hotel and downstairs where you find the ticket box before going up in a different lift. It is costly but was in our budget so we went just before dusk and stayed for about an hour to watch the sunset and the supertree lightshow which is across the road at the gardens by the bay. There is a bar up there with some beverages and snacks available, the prices didn't look too expensive but we didnt buy anything."
,,Costly but good,4.0,,Glad I did it? Yes. Worth the money? Probably not. You can see a lot of the same stuff from the big wheel and not pay up twice. You'll be there like 15 minutes.
,,Date Night,5.0,,"Right across Gardens Of Bay, Enjoy the day at the Garden and spend the night here with fine dining and amazing environment."
,,Wah !,4.0,,Must see what can be done on reclaimed land !! Many activities apart of walking. Nice view of the surroundings. Quite hot on noon time. Best to visit late afternoon.
,,Amazing structure - engineering wow!,4.0,,"A wee bit disappointing that there is only a relatively small area at bow part of top structure that you can view from, but a great view of the Marina Bay area and CBD Singapore.
Wow, what an engineering feat - we were intrigued by the lack of straight lines."
,,High in the Sky Views,4.0,,"The cost of visiting the SkyPark was moderate, and it is unfortunate that there are not more amenities in the viewing area, such as seats and shaded areas. The bar was pleasant but very expensive, again with few shaded areas or seats, and you had to leave the viewing area, take the elevator back down to ground level, and then come back up another elevator to go to the bar.
The views are expansive and glorious."
,,Fantastic view of Singapore,4.0,,Amazing building & views. Just a shame that you could not go into restaurant to have a drink & enjoy the view longer...this is only for hotel patrons.
,,Good Place to See,5.0,,Myself n my Malaysian friend went on Wednesday to have an look. It's really fantastic design n garden care building. Really amazing to see this kind of Building.
,,Expensive View,3.0,,A great view but expensive and once you reach the top there is nothing to do but soak in the view. Fortunately it was a clear day when we went up to the 56th floor.
,,Spectacular Views worth the Tingly Feet!,5.0,,"Probably not for the fainthearted but the Observation Deck reached by express lift from Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands complex, provided spectacular views across the Singapore skyline. Revealed in all its majesty from 56 floors up, we received 15% discount on the entry fee on presentation of our Singapore Airlines Boarding Passes.

We were rewarded with spectacular views of the many ships in the Bay, the domes and gardens of the Gardens by the Bay, the skyscrapers of the Central Business District, across the city to the North and perhaps best of all, the Singapore Flyer and Formula 1 circuit. It was a fantastic photographic opportunity which we exploited. The Deck wasn't too busy and we were easily able to take our photos without having to wait for others to clear the shot. Great fun and not to be missed!"
,,Stunning,5.0,,Highly recommend as the views are breathtaking. You can stay up there as long as you like. It's relaxing and you get lost in the moment
,,What a View,5.0,,They charge 23 SGD per person to visit the Skypark which is in the 56th Floor of the Hotel. Do remember that you wont be allowed entry into the Hotel or the restaurant or bar through the Skypark unless you are staying there.
,,Slightly over hyped place,3.0,,It looks great from the outside and I have taken many pictures of the same. The sky deck offers a great view of the city. The famed infinity swimming pool is open to the hotel guests and this was a dampener for me.
,,Amazing Hotel,5.0,,probably the best hotel in singapore. I stayed here one night on 2015 and had a wonderful time. food at rise restaurant is delicious. view of the city from the room is fabulous.
,,Great view- preferred the Singapore Flyer,4.0,,Its a great view! We had just done the Singapore flyer earlier the same day so it felt a bit like we had just seen this view. It would be great if there was somewhere to sit down and take it all in. It is definitely an amazing building but if I could have only done one... I probably would go on the Singapore flyer.
,,Stop over,2.0,,Although view was pretty good the access area is quite small and restricted. No seating at all we had to sit on the decking . Charging $80 for souvenir photo is extremely over priced .
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Amazing place! Been here last Nov 2015, at all I can say is that it was worth visiting. The view was awesome! Hope to visit this place again someday! 😁👍👍"
,,Good views for leisure,4.0,,"Place so clean, have some high and low cost restaurant l, many people on the spot of statue for take photos, you can find also some group around with a louder sound leader."
,,OMG what a view,5.0,,"Well worth a visit.....$26 Singapore gets you passage to part of the Skypark 56 floors up the views are amazing and it's fun, although expect crowds. There is a bar and terrace at the top and you can peek at the paying guests in the infinity pool in the unauthorised section!"
,,Eye catchy experience,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is divided into 3 parts Tower-1, Tower-2, Tower-3. While Tower 1 and 2 are meant for guests, general public/ tourists can visit tower-3 by paying SD 28 for an adult to visit this building's roof top."
,,The best view money can buy,3.0,,"As someone living in Vegas is kind of nonsense to pay for a view, but if the management of the MBS decided so... Fine. Be ready for disappointment."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Really amazing building n amazing view... i cant stop looking the view from top and say wowwwwww. I love this place... beautiful night
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Breathtaking view, great ambience, fantastic service! Highly recommended for business as well as vacation. Visit to Singapore is not complete without a trip here."
,,One of the best places to view Singapore...especially after dark...and it's free.,4.0,,"Lots of people don't realise that the rooftop bar on the top of the Marina Bay Sands is open to the public, unlike the rooftop infinity pool which is only open to residents. Take the lift from Tower 3 and head for the bar.....you don't even need to buy a drink, you can just admire the views then leave!. Drinks are very expensive but it has to be one of the best places in the world to sip a cocktail and gaze across at a stunning cityscape in one direction and at dozens of huge ships moored off the coast in the other direction. Great in the daytime but I think even better at night...you need to see both! You can pay to go on the ""deck"" but quite honestly you don't need to....just go to the bar."
,,Expensive,1.0,,Expensive entrance fee with limited access to the view. With the same amount of entrance fee you can buy yourself a drink with a better view with the Skypark hotel.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"It was so much funs here, the staffs were very entertaining, yet very processional. I took beef burger and it was great, huge portion as I am Asian but I finally finish it."
,,Worth it for first time visitors,5.0,,Nice view of the city skyline. But slightly overpriced if you have a group of people and you have to pay about $20 sgd per person. Also to get a picture souvenir is also expensive. Besides the view nothing else to do up there.
,,Great view!,5.0,,"We have booked a tour from tripadvisor and one of the key locations was the skypark. We arrived around nine in the evening, it wasn t bery crowded and the view is sublime. They took our pics before we went into the lifts, and by the time we arrived up it was already handed over to us. The pic is around 20 singapore dollars if i remember correctly and it is worh it."
,,Pricey but great view,3.0,,"Being 56 stories up it offers nice views of the city and surrounding area. It is rather pricey at $23 per adult but not bad.

There are restrooms and a refreshment area at the top. Unfortunately it does not come with access to the Infinity Pool or Ce La Vie - those are accessed via separate tickets.

We had done the Singapore Flyer early in the day so chose to use this one entry ticket at night. We were able to see the Wonder-fall laser light show on the waterfront as well as the Garden Rhapsody (solar tree farms in Gardens by the Bay).

Nice for a great view."
,,Marina,5.0,,"What can you say everything amazing,you can just sit and relax in the many bars and cafes eat as much as you like,or the pool is just as great and a unsereal"
,,Best way to spend SG$ 23!!! Must visit,5.0,,"My second visit to the Skypark, and it doesn't disappoint! Amazing views! Only downside is the cost of food, drinks and beer up there! Bring a bottle of water with you!!!!"
,,Excellent views of Singapore a hotel for the masses,3.0,,"Without doubt t an excellent view of the city. However, it's spoilt by the loud music they play through speakers up there. The experience was spoilt by the crass clientele they seem to attract. So many people walking around the hotel common areas in their room slippers and bathrobes, despite the hotel posting signs asking their guests not to do this.
The fact that they have to post the signs says alot about the type of guests they attract.
The food eating places (note I don't call them restaurants) cater for the masses, not surprising seeing how many guest rooms they have, sometimes bigger is not better, but Singapore doesn't know that yet!
My advice is go their and take in the view, then go somewhere else for a drink and dinner."
,,Pool with a view!,5.0,,"We stayed here for one night to experience the infinity pool and it was worth it. We had an early check in so were at the pool late morning and it really wasn't overly busy, which was great. it really is a fabulous pool and a very well designed space. We also ordered food from the poolside menu which was reasonably priced and great value for money. There are also 2 Jacuzzi on this level so look out for those as this area was well sheltered and really relaxing."
,,dont spend money on this,2.0,,a lot of people. you can have a grand overview od marina bay area. but I dont think worth going if you dont stay in the hotel
,,Overpriced!,1.0,,$23 SGD to wait in a line to go up to a limited deck with no seats or wifi. Save your money and head up to the Altitude bar...at least you can get a drink for $23!!
,,Very expensive food and drinks,4.0,,"Great views of the city, expensive food and drinks. $34 per head for 1 drink and finger food, and stand up and eat. Not practical when you are all late 60's and early 70's."
,,Best places to sit back and take in views of the city skyline.,5.0,,"It was a lovely evening in March when we got up to the desk. The weather was clear and a little windy, and the sun was setting. So we sat down for 10 minutes with delicious strawberry slushie we bought earlier at the only parlor they have up there. It was very romantic."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"We went here for a drink after walking around the bay gardens and the views from the top are spectacular try and go just before sunset and sit with a drink watching the sun set over Singapore, the staff were fantastic and so attentive our glasses were never empty and they even had time to talk and tell you a bit about them self barman Michael from America was a pleasure to meet, not the cheapest place I have ever been for a drink but one of the nicest."
,,Worth the price for the view of the city,5.0,,We went in the evening. Fantastic view of the city and sights. Found out there is a decent bar and restaurant that visitor can access on the top. But not sure how true this is
,,Exceptionally impressive engineering feat.,5.0,,The building is even more impressive in real life than it is in pictures. The view from the top is breathtaking. Highly recommended.
,,Amazing hotel,5.0,,Wow- this is seriously State-of-the-Art stuff. Magnificent hotel with enormous lobby and registration desk. A busy hotel but very well organized. Well worth a visit to see the architecture as well as the leading designer shops.
,,Great Views,5.0,,"It was a rainy day when we were on top, but the view was great anyway. We had umbrellas, so it was ok. It's a beautiful hotel/building/pool complex and well worth the price for the ride up in the elevator."
,,Family OE,3.0,,Huge place to look around. Shopping complex very expensive. 20% increase in retail prices above city prices. Easy walk from gardens by the bay
,,Great view from the top!,5.0,,"It is a bit pricey to go up to the observation deck, but it is well worth it if you are visiting Singapore. Tips: go up near sunset and wait around until the sun is down. Singapore is a beautiful city at night."
,,Amazing view but just access to deck,3.0,,Fantastic view from Skypark but would recommend to go to Ce La Vi instead of skypark as skypark entry fee is 20sgd and Ce La Vi is 30 SGD with 1 drink complimentary. If you go to Skypark you will be able to go only in Deck that you see in front of this ship shape thing. But if you go to Ce La Vi or Kudeta you can go to the restaurant and club (1 drink complimentary). View is amazing but no doubt.
,,must visit,5.0,,this is nice experience to go on 56th floor in few seconds.on the top floor we can see the Singapore.
,,excellent view!,5.0,,your singapore trip wont be complete if you dont see this amazing building! we went up the roof with some charges but the view was worth it! brilliant! must see
,,Don't bother,3.0,,Spend your money on the flyer. Don't waste it on the observation deck. They try to rip you off taking your photo. We declined and by the end of the bartering price had halved. Still did not accept the price.
,,Just wow,4.0,,"Gosh what a place! Incredible mall, with more luxury than I think has ever been seen in one place! The rooftop bar was also amazing and offered spectacular views of the city and the ocean An experience i would recommend."
,,Not much other than good view,4.0,,"As we stayed at the hotel, we had access up to the top without additional tickets. Otherwise tickets need to be purchased in the lobby and take a different elevator up to the top. View of the cityscape around evening is gorgeous"
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,"Whether you're a first-timer or a recurring visitor to Singapore, this view never ceases to amaze -- an already impressive city looks even more incredible from high above!"
,,Another beautiful creation.,5.0,,We visit that place after flyer Architect was super. And from the top at night it look amazing the whole city.
,,"Best view in Singapore, guaranteed!",4.0,,"Great views, much higher than the wheel. Quite expensive to go up there and its a shame you cant gain access to the bar/restaurant from the viewing deck - you have to go back down and up again to do that which seems a bit daft???"
,,Beautiful hotel,5.0,,This is a wonderful hotel. The rooftop pool is worth the money alone. Also take time to visit the mall beside this hotel. Fabulous shops and some great places to eat
,,Wow,5.0,,"Went to 57th floor on Tower one for drinks one evening - awesome views, great service and drinks reasonable - food good too! Will certainly return with colleagues"
,,A must do,4.0,,"Honestly, it's something you really ought to do whilst in Singapore. Great views and all very lovely. Stop for a drink at the bar there - it looks quite intimidating but just go and sit and relax. Great views can be found elsewhere though if you're short on cash."
,,Marina Sky park,5.0,,"You can see this building for miles , do not miss the opportunity of actually going there ......Unique building ,,,fantastic views all over the city, amazing restaurant , totally well worth a visit"
,,Great for honeymooners,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore for honeymoon, don't miss this place. For best arrangement, book Ce La Vi (previously Ku De Ta) restaurant at the skypark for dinner, and avoid paying the SGD$20+ elevator fee to the top. Go before 6:15pm to catch the sunset and the dusk lighting from the Singapore skyline. Then enjoy an (expensive) romantic dinner."
,,Amazing Man made Attraction,4.0,,What a structure which gives you panoramic view of one of the busiest city in the world. Salute to the efforts of Engineering and passion towards construction of such a Diamond in Countries crown
,,View from the top,3.0,,"This was a great 360 view of Singapore however very hot with little cover and mostly walking on reflective concrete type surface. Teenage boys described it as underwhelming having already viewed Singapore from the Singapore flyer which was much better value.
Most people didn't stay up there more than about 15 minutes."
,,Wrong Impression,3.0,,Obviously I didn't read the fine print when I paid S$23 for a visit to the top deck of the Marina Bay Sands. The building is very impressive but the Skypark pass only allows you into a small section of the rooftop. Very disappointing.
,,Comfort Stay,4.0,,"Iconic Hotel at Marina Bay, a tourist hotspot. Infinity Pools' the attraction though the Shopping Mall and Casino are also must visit. Spacious Rooms with luxurious amenities with multiple restaurants for variety of cuisines. Connectivity to Gardens By The Bay makes it even more attractive to stay at Marina Bay Sands. Facilities come with a price tag, though !"
,,Infinity pool,5.0,,Recently our son shouted us a holiday at Marina Bay Sands . The Skypark is just fantastic . The pool is out of this world and the views are spectacular.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Can't be more awesome. Best swim in Singapore and if you are lucky there is fireworks over the bay Recommend the bar too but do bring your wallet
,,Awesome View,4.0,,Infinity pool not only brings you up to sky view but also a spectacular view of our Singapore City. With an unblocked view from the pool.
,,Hit the bar,5.0,,"You're told .. you 'must have a drink on the bar up top'..

So I did, with a friend I met along the way. It was a very swanky bar. Of course, great views! The bar staff were very chilled.. they had a really diverse selection of drinks / cocktails. Prices weren't super cheap but it's what you expect.

The management came up for a talk with me, which made me feel extra welcomed (joys of wearing a soccer shirt / Munich)

Everyone seems to love soccer in Asia?!?! You make instant friends.

I would recommend going to check it out if you're in Singapore. The club which is also on the top floor is also very cool, good crowd to be found.. various ages and great music."
,,Worth seeing,3.0,,"The skypark is worth seeing, but for the price it is worth eating at the restaurant on the roof, and getting up for free."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Awesome view from the top of marina bay You will love it , advice is to go on a pleasant weather day . Sometimes its get really hot on the deck"
,,The view from here is just amazing,5.0,,the place is packed with tourists at most times but that doesn't take away anything from the beautiful views you can see from the top. the best part is that it has an amazing view of the singapore flyer which looks beautiful from here.
,,HAVE TO SEE IT,4.0,,Has to be seen to be beleived. Amazing place. Take a walk through and go to the top level where the pool is and check out the fabulous views.
,,Singapore stopover after Vietnam Tour,4.0,,"We visited Marina Bay and went up to Ce La Vi Restaurant instead of the Skypark observation deck. The view is the same and you can go outside into the bar area and look straight down over the Bay Gardens. Our group of three had the Chef's tasting menu accompanied with beers and champagne. Although a little expensive, it was worthwhile as the tasting plates were very good and the champagne - excellent. We watched a rain squall come over with cleared the outside observations decks and bar so we were glad we were in the restaurant. We visited at 14:30 and the restaurant was nearly empty - excellent as we had a window table. We had to go outside to the bar at 16:00 as the staff wanted to set-up for dinner. Recommended to beat the queues for the Skypark and other less expensive menu options were available, all in all, a very pleasant afternoon."
,,Fabulous view at night,5.0,,We went up to the SkyPark to view beautiful Singapore and also catch the light and sound show at Gardens by the Bay from above. A spectacular view. Don't miss this opportunity!
,,casino,5.0,,"you must go in & play something so you can tell people you have played there,but do not take a local friend with you they have to pay S$50 to get in"
,,Aside from the view there is nothing to brag about,2.0,,"Hey folks, if you are a hotel guest it is free to enter, if you are not you have to pay for entry and it is not worth it trust me. Over crowded, messy and very expensive food and drinks. Hey but a great view. forget the pool, it is always crowded except between noon and 1pm when the locals head for the shade."
,,Stunning singapore view,5.0,,"Awesome singapore top view,great music and drinks.Worth visiting this place.Great place to dine with friends,family."
,,Too high expecations,2.0,,"The building looks more stunning from far.
As a visitor, you can only access the viewing deck (no shelter from sun or rain.... probably not to have visitors spend too much time up there). Though the views over Singapore were great, to me they did not justify the entrance fee.
So my recommendation: do not bother.... it is a both a waste of money and time."
,,disappointing,1.0,,total waste of money for a 5 minute walk on the roof of the hotel. no seating provided and the bar is not accessible to non hotel guests. i could have got the same view from the Singapore flyer.
,,MBS Skypark,5.0,,MBS Skypark. On a clear day you can see forever. The view is breath taking & anyone can have a 360 view of Singapore Cityscape. The whole Skypark is well landscape and anyone can laze around relax. Food is good and more important the food is FRESH.
,,Great views over Singapore,5.0,,"I do not like heights but decided that I had to make the leap and go up the 56 floors. Well worth the look although I did not stay for long. The bar staff tried to take a twenty dollar tip and only after 10 minutes of waiting and then asking for the change did they then decide to give it to us. Would I go there again, no, but I'm glad I have done it."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Pricey drinks in the bar, but worth the ride up to 57th floor to see the view. Lots of shopping eateries ground floors and basement and a casino."
,,A cocktail with a view,4.0,,This one fascinating building and its absolutely huge! We visited for a cocktail and to take in the evening views of Singapore. The height is immense and would defiantly go back again. Worth the visit.
,,awesome place,5.0,,"marina bay sands makes me feel good everytime i see her... even if the weather is not so cold, i still love the place... food is good... shoppes are plenty... and inside the building is very cold."
,,Great place for a drink in the late afternoon,5.0,,The bar at Spago is a great place to while away an afternoon. You can enjoy watching the many tourists do selfies!
,,Great views,3.0,,This has great views but there isn't much you can do up there. Unless you are a guest of their hotel and/or willing to pay to join the pool & restaurant there isn't much else to enjoy. There's a drinks and snacks bar available for all visitors serving decently priced items. The view covers the most iconic things of SG so it's worth going up there before deciding where to go next.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Get there early if you want to spend a good amount of time enjoying the views and not fighting for a place in the lifts. Long, long queues but it was worth the wait. The 360 deg views of Singapore at night were spell-binding."
,,Excellent view of Singapore skyline,4.0,,"The skypark provides a very good view of the Singapore skyline. it also overlooks the Gardens by the bay. It is somewhat expensive, though. If you go up in the evening, it will offer both the views, in the daylight as well as after darkness. There is no time limit to stay at the top."
,,Room stay at MBS,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel is one of a kind. It's magnificent views from your room will entice you. The best part of the hotel is the rooftop infinity pool which stretches the whole length of the hotel. And is made to look like a ship. In the pool, you can see the entire view of Singapore and it's awesome skyline. It's pricey but worth it . Come try it out. You won't regret it at all."
,,Breath Taking,5.0,,"Pay an entrance fee, up with the lift to enjoy the view of Singapore! Worth it! Preferably go between 17:00 to 20:00 to catch sundown and night skyline. Beautiful!"
,,Breathtaking View,4.0,,The trip to the sky park is worth a visit but there are a few limitations. Firstly while I understand the need for photo sales it is a bit disconcerting to say no but find yourself buying one just to stop being hassled before even getting into the lift. The other is that you are only granted access to level 56 and so not actually to the top where the palm trees and the guest pool are situated. I respect the rights of guests to have their privacy but I wonder if people realise that this area and the lovely bar that you can access from level 56 is actually off limits. Nevertheless it only costs $23 SGD to take the walk around the level 56 platform and the breathtaking views are worth every cent. We chose to go during the day but I can imagine how visually captivating that view would be at night time overlooking the city lights. I doubt you can get a better view of the city.
,,Night views stunning,5.0,,"We decided to go to the bar for a drink, but wasn't dressed appropriately (we had thongs and shorts on) so we paid the fee to go the the top and look at the view. It was worth it. We went at night and wasn't disappointed. Amazing!!"
,,Most expensive building currently in world,5.0,,"Maybe slightly expensive for what it is, lift to observation deck on 1st tower, watched sun go down over city then watched Gardens by the bay light show and then music and lights show on the bay, all free to watch. Views are stunning but you can't see infinity pool from the deck so if you want that, pay for a night in hotel to use!"
,,Fun date - and I don't even like shopping!,4.0,,Went to MBS to look at watches and ended up spending the entire day there. Great street food hawker style food court was lunch. Somehow ended up having dinner there too - oysters and bubbles. Fun date day and evening! Not as crowded as I imagined and didn't seem as though many people were doing much beyond window shopping - few people carrying bags. But loads of upscale shops with all the major brands and houses. No shortage of choice but also nothing particularly interesting or unique either.
,,Night visit,4.0,,Excellent view from the sky park . Best time to go would be between day turning into night Fab view of the city sky line .
,,Excellent overlooking view over the city,4.0,,"If the Singapore flyer ain't your thing, the MBS Skypark is the place to go. You won't feel that you're several feet up. It's better to go there at night so that all the lights will be seen from above. The infinity pool is also there but is strictly restricted for hotel guests but you can still catch a glimpse of it."
,,an incredible engineering achievement,5.0,,"the view from the top is incredible, it was rainy when i went though it was great, well beyond my expectation. it is great to look at it from the bottom and even better taking the elevator and go up there."
,,need to spent one night here,5.0,,If your pocket is allowed then need to spent one night here to see beauty of Singapore in day as well as in night. swimming pool is awesome.
,,"Fantastic views, a little expensive at S$23 but we really enjoyed the view",5.0,,"Entry to the Observation deck is a separate elevator so you cannot get to the hotel swimming pool or restaurant etc., plus it is a little expensive at S$23 per person. It was a fantastic view though, virtually 360o due to the shape of the building. So we did enjoy it, it wasn't too busy so plenty of time and space to take lots of good photos, views down to the Gardens by the Bay, across to Raffles and the city, was beautiful."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"56 Floors up and the view over Singapore and Gardens by the Bay are incredible. Lift is a nice ride as well, don't loose your stomach. Accessible from Bayfront MRT."
,,Impressive view,4.0,,"I was glad to have had the advice that one can visit the bar on the 57th floor and see the incredible view from there without paying the viewing fees. It was amazing and really gives a good perspective on the Singapore skyline and such places as Gardens by the Bay. Personally I can see that I would not want to be in the infinity pool up so high, or staying in the hotel as I prefer something that is more quaint, and personalised in terms of service, but can see that for large numbers of people this is a really great place to come and certainly for the visitor, at least a trip here to see it and come up the towers is well worth doing. An engineering feat."
,,Great view,4.0,,"I didn't go to the Skypark. I sneaked up in the hotel lift to the 57 floor for the view out the back over the sea, not Marina Bay Area. Skypark next time!"
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,A great place to view all of Singapore. On a fine day it offers fantastic views but at night it is superb. A little pricey for the tickets but well worth it.
,,Must visit place in Singapore,4.0,,The infinity pool at the 57th floor. And is a must be place. You can see all the way to Clark quay from this place. Remember not to forget your camera.
,,"Wow, shoppers paradise",5.0,,"If you like to shop or just look at amazing shops then go to Singapore. Unsure which was which but the trains take you into the shopping centres. One had an ice rink, water canal and every brand name you can think of.
Certainly not cheap but if you have the money to spend or just look it's worth it.

The gardens are beautiful at night with a light display through the trees. A must see!"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Skypark free to guests staying at Marina Bay Sands and for a charge the public can also access great views. Excellent for getting your bearings where local attractions are
,,Love the pool!,4.0,,"We stayed at the hotel, so it was free for us to enter. The pool is amazing and makes for great photos. We enjoyed a cocktail and a bar snack at Spago bar, which was lovely."
,,Only ok if you stay at the hotel,3.0,,"I don't think that going to the skypark is something anyone should do. It's basically riding up and down an elevator to look at the sane view at the Singapore Flyer.
In my opinion, it is much better to go to one of the roof outlets (either a bar or restaurant) and have a drink or food there.
The hotel doesn't charge for the lift in that case, and the money you pay buys you good F&B"
,,Terrific View,4.0,,"We went up to the skypark on a beautiful clear day and you can see for miles.
The viewing level is very safe and I am not the bravest where heights are concerned but it's not to be missed. The main part of the roof is a swimming pool and restaurant for the hotel guests but about one third is the skypark for visitors. Make sure you take a camera and enjoy the view."
,,A wonderful place,5.0,,"A nice place to see from a distance ,it is in sheep shape .A wonderful place to visit . A lot of people come to visit this place."
,,"Worth a visit, what a view",4.0,,"The first time you see Marina Bay Sands it takes your breath away due to its daring original never seen before shape, so yes you have to take the lift in tower 3 and see the city views and beyond.
It takes an hour to go up there and look around and take pictures, obviously best kept for a sunny day and at sunset it would be perfect and then to stay up there and see the lights come up. It is a good attraction and not scary at all where you are up there."
,,A must when you're in Singapore!,5.0,,Breathtaking views! Close to the merlion and beautiful garden. The hotel is beautiful and the restaurant on the 57 floor is breathtaking!
,,Look around and enjoy your drink,4.0,,"It's one of the place you must visit if you are in Singapore. We went there for a couple drinks watching the sunset there. The view is beautiful, my Singapore Sling was great and we had an amazing service person (she is from Ukraine) , sadly I forgot her name. It's a great experience, memorable for sure."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,S$ 23 gives You outstanding experience in day and night. People who visit here is not allowed to go pool area. Best place for seeing singapore city and photography.
,,best view of singapore from top...............,5.0,,you can have the best view of singapore skyline ....best time to visit in night ..........it has the 360 degree view of singapore.
,,Expensive but views are incredible,5.0,,This was fantastic for an hour. We didn't have a drink up there but what fantastic views of all of Singapore! Was going to go on flyer too but this topped it all!
,,Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark should be on ones must do things in Singapore. A visit to Singapore, without visiting the Bay Sands Skypark is incomplete."
,,Amauing Views,5.0,,Although we had to pay to go on top on this unusual building the views were brilliant so well worth paying
,,We went for cocktails,3.0,,"Great view, and great pool, but I think that is only open to hotel guests. Drinks were fine, but of all the things we went to in Singapore you could miss this one easily."
,,Definitely the best place to have a bird eye view of Singapore,5.0,,"This is much nicer than the Singapore flyer. You have a great view of the downtown Singapore extending far into the outside of the city. Take the elevator and you are up and free to move around.

For the flyer, unless you like to just sit in the capsule and take a long while to reach the top and get the view for a short while before going down and I think it is not as high."
,,"A ""Must do"" if you are in Singapore",4.0,,"Not only is this a stunning building, but the views from the Sky Garden are superb. If you are in Singapore - put it on your list. As for the Hotel itself, it didn't appeal to me. Too many tour groups, impersonal and very antiseptic!"
,,"Beautiful view, delicious food",4.0,,"The side-less pool on top of the 50-floor boat shape building gives you fantastic experience. And it's the best place for city view, either day or night."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,The price of admission is not cheap but the views over Singapore are spectacular. It would be nice to be able to sit down and relax with coffee or drink other than from a kiosk but that is reserved for hotel guests.
,,"Food , fashion ,casino , viewing platform , all here",4.0,,"The view from the top of this building is wonderful , to get a true idea of this beautiful City , Food court has lots to choose from , all good prices , we're on a budget ,"
,,Wow Wow Wow,5.0,,"If your visiting Singapore, you have GOT to visit here, we had lunch right at the top 57th floor, not expensive either and very yummy...what a view!....photo feast, amazing views...some people say you have to pay to go up to the top, but we just hopped in a lift and a hotel resident swiped his card and up we went...Brilliant.....we must go for dinner next time we are in Siingapore...."
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the best view here in Singapore specially in night ,. You can see the nice structural form of the city ,. Best for photography and experience the skyline ... Best in couples also as the place is looks romantic ,.😊😊😊😊😊"
,,360 degree view of Singapore! Stunning by day & night!,4.0,,"Sands SkyPark Observation Deck, soaring 57 levels

Prices
• S$23 for adults
• S$17 for children (aged between 2 - 12 years)
• S$20 for senior citizens (aged 65 years and above)
• Children under 2 years may enter for free
We had a wonderful time and staff were very accommodating, especially with families travelling with children (our daughter was 1.4 years old in a pram at the time).

The thrill of going up in a lift in less than 1 minute; numbered B, 1, 2, 56, 57 is very cool.

As we came out of the lift on Floor 57, and out of the hallway, we were greeted by a walkway of approx. 4m in wide and large curved glass sheets approx. 5m high – with a Stunning view of the sea, Gardens by the Bay and the green houses (The Flower Dome etc.)
As we walked around the circumference of the observatory desk, we could see different views of Singapore. One on side Gardens by the Bay, and on the other side the high rise buildings of the Financial district. Absolutely breathtaking whilst feeling warm air sweep my hair.

Can capture some great pictures of each angle, though could not find a single place to capture the whole 360 degree view on camera. (perhaps a video-camera would have done the trick).

A definite Must See when In Singapore, thought if you have done it once, you probably won’t pay for the pleasure again."
,,good view,4.0,,"we went here for a drink, its quite nice but drinks are not that cheap as expected on any other thing in singapore. the cocktails are blended smoothly i recommend getting the berry bellini and the singapore slings, went here twice to get a good view of sg night time and in the arvo too bad though we were not allowed to go sit by the pool"
,,Vegas wonder in Singapore setting.,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skylark sits atop the wonderfully architected Marina Bay Sands Hotel Complex. Offering fun, food and spirits couple with an astonishing view of the inner harbor of Singapore."
,,awesome view. better than flyer,5.0,,awesome view. better than flyer. go here and u can stay here unlimited time. also great views from top.
,,Nce View,3.0,,"I went here seeing as we were checked in at the hotel so I had free access to the the view from the infinity pool. I have also visited this in the past but will not want to shell out extra cash for it. There are other places like Marina Barrage which will allow you to get a good view of Singapore from atop a hill. Although it's not as birds eye view as the Skypark, All in all, it's a good place to visit but if you're tight on cash I'd recommend not going here."
,,Great Icons,4.0,,To be the new icons of Singapore beside the Merlion. It nice to see at the morning as well as in the evening.
,,Beautiful views and great getting there.,4.0,,Getting there is half the fun. The shopping and sightseeing getting to the Sands is wonderful. Once there the views are great and lets you appreciate the city's architecture and marina area.
,,Amazing rooftop party place,5.0,,Its just 23 sgd to ride up. Its worth the visit. You get the entire bird's eye view of Singapore from the top. Excellent view. The rooftop restaurant is bustling with parties even in mid day..Happening place..
,,"Wow, what a view!",4.0,,"Need to see Singapore from the top, it's awesome! We took the lift to the bar but it was busy so we just looked at the view. Could see the infinity pool but no access unless you are staying in the hotel - I wish!"
,,Nice view from the frying pan,1.0,,"Great view of Singapore, and that's about it. Being cooked in the Singapore sun while watching the hotel guests sip Singapore Slingers from their shady tables, in an area that you can't access, was not SGD23 well spent."
,,Nice view.... NOTHING ELSE!!!,1.0,,Not worth 23SGD...!!! No shade. No access to even the restaurant. You watch the hotel guests drinking ice cold beer in the shade while getting sun burnt. IonOrchard is much better... And free!!
,,Great Family rooms in Vegas style hotel,5.0,,"Family rooms are very spacious, sleep 4 easily, our balcony was low and over restaurant so not only hot outside, wafting food smells all day and night.

Restaurants and pool are very popular/ packed but expensive, into Singapore

Casino, shopping mall downstairs..

If you go to SG you have to stay at the MBS"
,,Not worth the money,1.0,,"Great views but you pay a lot of money to go up onto a deck. It's not a skypark, you are restricted to one small area. also the staff are super pushy about you buying a photo which we didn't want. I wouldn't recommend"
,,Astounding,5.0,,"We stayed here for one night to celebrate our sons birthday, from check to check out the experience was breathtaking, the views are amazing, the skypark has to be experienced and the choice of restaurants cannot be surpassed. It is not cheap, but worth saving a penny or two for the experience of the best views of one of the finest cities in the world."
,,"Pay up, not an experience easily repeated",5.0,,"Miserable old things that we are, we wavered about paying up ($23AUD each) and going to the Skypark. Some things you have to view as opportunities you probably will never repeat and this was in that league. Singapore itself does nothing for me (contrived, fake,superficial), but this was great as a oncer."
,,👍🏼,4.0,,"Views from the skypark were stunning. I especially loved the views of the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay at night. However, as expected, somewhat busy."
,,Amazing building,4.0,,"If you want the best view of Singapore at night, then this is the only place to view it from. The building is also a marvel in itself too and it's huge. Don't forget to buy your ticket to the top."
,,Restricted access,3.0,,We got to the top but our access was severely limited as the sky park was open to hotel guests only (through turnstiles) and the restaurant was closed for a private function. Got some excellent photos from the viewing stage but that was it.
,,Incredible views,5.0,,"The views here were incredible. We were on a budget but we splashed out on a bottle of prosecco and sat near the infinity pool. We spent a couple of hours here, and were even given a free bottle by our waiter. It was a fun and tipsy start to our trip!"
,,Mr,4.0,,Amazing architecture . We had lunch at the top food was 7/10 the view was breath taking . There's a pool and another bar / restaurant at the top (Other side of where we were) that I believe you can pay to have access 2. Looks like it would be amazing as the pool canter levers over the side of hotel
,,The zenith of infinity pools...,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is an integrated resort fronting Marina Bay in Singapore. Developed by Las Vegas Sands, it is billed as the world's most expensive standalone casino property at S$8 billion, including the land cost.The SkyPark has the world's longest elevated swimming pool, with a 146-metre vanishing edge, 191 metres above ground.

,,Part of our night tour of Singapore,5.0,,"Our visit here was a part of our arranged Night Tour of Singapore, the view from the top deck is just amazing, the whole venue is an engineering wonder and I would strongly recommend to visit after dark as the panorama of lights below is just awesome, well worth the visit and if this is done as apart of the Night Tour package, the entry tickets are cheaper."
,,amazing views,5.0,,"The view of the city at night was amazing camera got a good work out well worth it.
Also had fun looking at the very expensive shops having a laugh thinking we wouldnt even walk in let alone buy anything would have to motrgage the house just to buy a rolex watch"
,,Excellent view of the City,5.0,,"This place is must go in singapore, for its excellent view of the city. Although its not a free entry but still, must go place"
,,"The place is amazing worth to see visit every one are friendly after 10 pm dress code ( long pans ) required , love it m",5.0,,"I went to the 57 th floor yesterday , the service was great , staff is friendly and very helpful , a bit pricey and they have dress code For couple and family great view and fun time"
,,Worth it!,5.0,,"No matter how sore our feet are strolling the park, the very clean environment and soothing view took it all away! It's worth it!"
,,Good,5.0,,Very well maintenance. Free entry to casino for tourists. Must visit. Please remove this 100 character restrictions on TripAdvisor. Its annoying
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,From the garden has great views of the whole Singapore and especially to the business district . When I visited there was no queue .
,,breathtaking views,5.0,,I am not keen on heights but this was worth the fear of getting close to the edge. Drink champagne and take in the panoramic views of Singapore all around you as far as the eye can see.
,,Too upscale for us..,5.0,,"Nice place if you have the $$$$$. We went up to the bar and have lunch there for the view--nice view!! Lots of high end shops on the ground floor. Would love to stay here one day but at min $450 per night, not today. Looks great, a modern marvel if you ask me."
,,Greet for a drink at night,5.0,,Go to the 57th Floor to have a drink at the topfloor bar after 6 Pm. Drinks are expensive but worth it given the view.
,,Spectacular Views.,5.0,,Ignore the touristy press for a photo of it's not your thing to gain access to truly spectacular views over this wonderful city. Entrance is actually outside the hotel complex so watch the signs. Not for those without a head for heights.
,,One of the best Urban views in the world,5.0,,The architecture of this place is staggering. You will easily spend a good few hours up here just starring at everything down below.
,,Best view in Singapore,3.0,,"You can see this place from pretty much anywhere in the city, the three towering towers with the ship on top. Once you are there, there are more shops than time to visit and the hotel itself is always busy. If you can make time to grab a drink up in the ship at Ce La Vi and enjoy the wonderful views across Singapore and the Gardens by the bay it is highly worthwhile. It also provides an alternate entry point into Gardens by the Bay."
,,"""a boat atop three tower""",4.0,,"the booking is easy, the reception area is like a public place, but then, who could be blamed since the place is so attractive where in tourist would want to be there taking pictures. in spite of the crowd the receptionists are not at all bothered, they are able to accept guest like any other regular hotel.
in fact i was bothered about my luggage when the bellboy got them from the taxi because of the crowd, yet when i got to my room, my luggage was with me. the bellboy in spite of the many guests arriving at that time did not show any dis gusto, he even took his time orienting me on what to do in the hotel with out a bit of a hurry.
the view of the room is spectacular.
the ""boat"" as seen above is the infinity pool is perfect.
on the downside though, i was not able to open the fridge as like other hotel because it is locked and you have to pay to use it.
to summarize the experience, this is a different hotel that is you get to Singapore, you have to try it, it is a must."
,,Lost its focus as a hotel,3.0,,"Stayed twice so far. Apart from the signature Pool, nothing much to praise about. Plus expensive for the kind of service it provides."
,,Great View of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"Go early and have your breakfast at the restaurant up there to enjoy the view of Singapore's skyline while sipping your morning coffee. You cannot see that much from the Singapore Flyer but at the Skypark, the view you see is fantastic and you will never regret or forget. Added to this, there is also a swimming pool where you can swim at such great height. A must to visit for both locals and visitors from overseas."
,,Super evening and great views and music,5.0,,Well you have to come here for the views and the amazing atmosphere. I have never been to a nightclub this high up and open air. Just fantastic and a must.
,,Impressive,5.0,,Clean place and spacious to walk around. Ticket price is affordable. A very good experience and place to see Singapore and recommend for tourist. Family friendly
,,nice view,4.0,,Book the hotel and you get to swim on top of the sky park. Just need the weather be yourside you will have a spectacular view till Indonesia island.
,,"Amazing experience, to see the city from the deck of this ""floating ship""",5.0,,"The architecture of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and skypark is just mind-blowing, and being able to walk on the top of the structure, on the nice open air deck, open on 3 sides (so you can see both the city and the ""Garden by the Bay"" is a great experience.
I recommend you go just before sunset, to see the sun go down behind the city, and witness the skyline get illuminated against the beautiful blue sky..."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"We did this as part of a Singapore Night Out trip with RMG Tours, so we were up there at night looking down on the Gardens by the Bay and the harbour - it was breathtaking"
,,Amazing,5.0,,Total wort paying we should in a lifetime go there and enjoy the infinity pool and the laser show and the view from 57 th floor
,,Not worth spending money to see Singapore from Top.,3.0,,"We visited this place last month. They take you to 56th Floor on the deck. All you can see whole Singapore from Top. Ii think it is not worth spending money for that.
It is better if you plan and take dinner at the hotel on the Top.

Hotel is very nice and it looks much better from the out side. It was not great experience."
,,Staycation with Family,5.0,,"We booked 2 premier city view rooms. Check in was fast and efficient. Counter staff was friendly and cheerful despite the long queues. We loved the rooms and the great view. Sofa bed was requested and made available. Overall enjoyed my stay very much. One thing though, the infinity pool on 57th floor is overcrowded. We didn't dare to swim and wonder when it is cleaned since its packed ALL THE TIME. Took a quick dip，a few pics and left."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,One of the best place and must visit for Singapore holidays. Light show during night gives pictorious view of Singapore.
,,Iconic from the ground and breathtaking views from the Skypark!,5.0,,"Iconic from the ground and breathtaking views from the Skypark!

Our cameras snapped when we were viewing the Skypark from Singapore City, as this building is amazing to view.

Do make the effort to go to the Skypark and look down on Singapore - the memory will stay with you forever.

Buy a ticket to the observation deck or go and have a drink to see the sights - either way, this is a must when you visit Singapore."
,,Great View,3.0,,"Went during the day, was hot and humid, however a great view. Perhaps an evening visit would be better and enjoy the lights of the CIty"
,,high view,5.0,,"We popped up to the skydeck after someone gave us free passes. We wished we had stayed to have a drink and soak up the view, but after spending all day at the gardens by the bay, we were pretty tired."
,,Unforgettable,5.0,,"The view of course is amazing. The pool is spectacular. Try to go in the morning around 11, when a lot of people have already ledt and new arrovals are not checked in."
,,Great view,5.0,,"Fantastic view great to visit at night. Be prepared to queue for the lifts. Can be very hot whilst queuing, take a bottle of water. Well worth the wait fab experience."
,,Viewing,5.0,,"Went up to view - and was not disappointed. Definitely the best vantage point to view the city. Marina Bay just below has a floating Football Pitch with seating for 20,000 spectators.
We had a meal in the restaurant which was good and not too expensive."
,,Expensive views,2.0,,"I think the park is much more interesting when viewed from the ground, but you can pay over $20. for an elevator ride up to the top to take photos of Singapore. Hopefully
you will choose a clear day. There is a viewing platform (no seating or shade) on one level and an expensive outdoor bar & cafe up one level. There is an infinity pool that is reserved for guests but you can catch a glimpse of it from the cafe.
If you want to skip the viewing deck, you can ride up to the bar level for free, but the views aren't quite as expansive and you pay $24. Singapore dollars for one cocktail. Definitely won't do it again, but if it's on your bucket list..."
,,A lot of money for a lift ride,3.0,,Once at the top you are limited to a small area at the eastern end. Still great views but would like more access. Food and drinks are expensive considering they only took a ride in a lift
,,The best pool in the workd,5.0,,Awesome experience swimming on the 57th floor an hotel with breathtaking views at night. Bar service were excellent. Gets a bit crowded on weekends.
,,Fantastic view of the city,5.0,,Great spot to pop up for a drink if you can afford around $70 for two drinks!! At least going to the bar saves the viewing point entry fee.
,,Go at night!,4.0,,"Well worth the visit at night, I didn't need to pre-book tickets, just get them on the day. Singapore is beautiful at night and this is the best place to see it all from! Good bar as well to enjoy the views from."
,,Fabulous attraction,5.0,,This is well worth a visit the view is spectacular the cost is reasonable a must do if your scared of heights then it's not for you as its on the 56th floor. We had a fab time.
,,Overpriced ripoff. Probably different if you stay in resort.,1.0,,"Seriously $50 ish (aus) to go to a hot roof with no seating and look over the balcony at the same view from Sing Flyer and at a bunch of wankers sitting in an overcrowded pool, not being allowed in unless you stay there. (I agree with the not allowing visitors into resort but a little bit more respect for the people they rip off would be better). I wouldn't stay there, granted it was school holidays but people who were staying there had to line up to get to floor 57! If you had to line up to get up there and check out, imagine how disgusting the pool is with all those people in it. Personally I enjoyed where I stayed much more and had as good as view from the Singapore Flyer as from the Skydeck/Hot Deck with no seating and no hospitality! I guess if you stay there the rating is different. IF YOU DONT WANT TOURISTS DONT INVITE THEM MORONS!"
,,"""Worth seeing in Singapore""",4.0,,"A little spendy, but most people don't get to Singapore every day. Enjoyed the time we spent at the top looking at the city."
,,Awesome,5.0,,On of the great architectural eingeneering and design wonders of Asia. What a great place. Awesome. Really breath taking. Such magnificent piece of archchitecture. You must visit. Shops restaurants casino gardens hotel faaaaantastic!
,,A good view of the City,4.0,,If you do not mind heights then this is a place to go for an excellent view of the city and bay area. You need to purchase a ticket ( $23 Sng. for adults) The area is closed during bad weather.
,,Beautiful but don't spend your 23 dollar on it!!,4.0,,"The view from the top is unbeatable. Plus, you get the chance to go inside the most prestigious hotels in the world: Marina Bay Sands. But other than the view, there's nothing else you can do there unless you 've got cash to burn, you can go up to the cafe. I chose not to. But if you have decided to go to skypark, make sure you make the best out of it. Bring some refreshments and drinks with you as if you were having picnic. The best time to go there is at 17pm. Stay until the city lights turned on. Fabulous!

If you don't bring cash, just go to Garden By The Bay, pay 3 dollar for the shuttle (or walk, only 1,3km) to Marina hotel, go up to the connecting bridge, you will still get the best view of the city and Singapore flyer. Then you can enjoy Garden By The Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and Singapore Flyer view in one day in less than 3 hours!!!"
,,Best Skypark,5.0,,free to go on top if you are going to bar at the top and order a drink. no need to buy the ticket and make reservation.
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,4.0,,Nice view from the top. Fast elevator To take you to top in few seconds. An entry fee applicable if u don't buy a drink. Good place to chill with a glass drink in the evening to enjoy the view
,,Nice....but,4.0,,"We like IT and its good as in pictures but some time to many people in the pool and to many selfies at your bed, with your bed and on you bed close to the pool. Not that many that respect your space.
But IT was on the bucketlist and now we have Done it and we are so Happy for that.
We will come back even it is so expensive."
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,"It cost you $23 to go to the SkyPark. The views are amazing from the top. You can take nice photos there. But there is no cafe or bar there to have lunch. To have a drink you need to go to the next level and buy another ticket, which was a bit disappointing as it was right there. So if you want just the skypark which is like a rooftop with views you pay $23 to enter. If you want the bar with drinks let the front desk know. The drinks are super expensive, $60 for 2 glasses of wine. But it is a nice roof top bar but very pricey. Worth visiting, definitely recommend this place!"
,,Marina bay sands gardens by the bay skypsrk,5.0,,What an artitectural marvel . Seeing is believing and magnifisance is the word . This is a historic park crafted with beautiful lighting effects. Seeing is believing. Salaam to the creator who is very innovative
,,Singapore trip 2016,4.0,,"I think going up to the bar on the 57th floor for a beer is one of the things you have to do in Singapore just so you can say you have done it. To get up there you have to go to Tower 3, there is a special lift to the top but you must tell the lift attendant that you are going to have a drink, if you don't they wont let you up. But be prepared to pay for a drink, if you want a table you have a minimum spend of SG$200. To stand at the bar and have a drink, a stubbie (small bottle of beer) that will set you back SG$19. Didn't try the cocktails, to scared to ask the price, I might have jumped. We went up there at night great view unless you are staying at the hotel you are restricted in where you can go up there."
,,Lost Tablet,5.0,,"I visited the Skypark on the evening of June 8th 2016 and unfortunately left my Samsung Tablet on the counter of the souvenir shop on the outside deck. I reported it to the security at The Marina Bay Sands Hotel and they were very helpful but unfortunately it wasn't found.
If anyone knows of its whereabouts I would appreciate the photographs as they are priceless to me and they can keep the Tablet.
I know this is a long shot but you never know unless you try."
,,The best view in town,4.0,,If it is in Singapore you can see it from this vantage point. Take your time don't rush (unless you have a tour guide pushing you). Walk the whole circle and take lots of pictures.
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,"A must visit if you are visiting Singapore, it costs S$23 to visit the Skypark if you are not staying at the hotel. Whether you visit during the day or at night the views are amazing. I had lunch, the food was delicious although a little more expensive than other restaurants nearby. The service was slow and not as attentive as my experiences at other restaurants in Singapore."
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,Well worth the $$ to go to the 56th floor. You can also go to the 57th floor if you would like a drink or eat in the restaurant
,,Looks like every other shopping mall in Singapore,3.0,,"Perhaps I am just spoilt. Apart from a canal that is a rip off of the Venecia in Vegas, this is a pretty typical Singaporean shopping mall. Too large, confusing geometry and impossibly busy with the same range of shops that are in all the other malls. Ho hum."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"This is a must do. Typically touristic but, hey, in a foreign country, even for business, you are kind of a tourist ! So the view from there is quite amazing, as you can see almost all Singapore !"
,,Wow!!!!,5.0,,"We have just been lucky enough to be able to enjoy all this while staying in the hotel. The views are absolutely amazing of course so overall i think it might be better value to pay to enjoy these views rather than riding the the giant wheel if you had to choose. There is a charge if you do not stay at the hotel.....around S $22.00???
The usual little souvenirs and refreshments are available up the top. Night time is equally spectacular and a super place to watch the sun rise/set."
,,"Stunning views, especially a night",4.0,,"The skypark is an absolutely amazing experience, and one that needs to be visited, go at night if you can, as the lights add a completely different dynamic to the view. Be careful as it gets very busy, so make sure you book."
,,"Impressive, stunning view",4.0,,"Fantastic 360 views. Boiling! Refreshing beers, pool only for guests, unfortunately. Still a must see."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Treated ourselves to a night at MBS whilst in Singapore for the F1, spent most of our time in the skypark by that pool. Its a huge complex with far to much for us to do in a day. Well worth the expense if your in town."
,,Crowded and too packed,3.0,,"The pool area is alwAys packed so be prepared for a packed pool view. Eating places is nice place to chill and the guest card access is limited to 1 guest card per entry. to control the crowd but tends to be really troublesome when you have larger family members, will need to take turn to access the pool and skypark."
,,The best,5.0,,most amazing infinite pool ever. Excellent rooms and services. The hotel is huge and a bit crowded but is silent on the rooms. That pool worth it all
,,A place worth seeing in Singapore!,5.0,,"We have explored most of the places in the Singapore, Marina Bay Sands Skypark will definitely be one that is unforgettable. My tip to the travelers is to stay in Marina Bay Sands hotel, that will give you free access to the Skypark. Enjoy a dinner at the restaurant located at the Skypark can perfect your visit"
,,Splendid creation,5.0,,Awesome ! Is the first word one can utter looking at the marvellous structure - 3 towers standing tall to reveal the beauty of tremendous engineering. Great creation
,,Best place to view Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"The place is amazing at first sight, have a park, swimming pool, Bar, restaurant, Night club on roof top (57th Floor). Unbelievable view of Singapore skyline. A visit worth while in Singapore."
,,A good view,3.0,,You're only doing this for the view and the experience. You could get the same view on the big wheel. A little expensive for what's up there...a view
,,"Great view, especially of the storm",4.0,,"We visited on a morning with a storm threatening, but the view of Singapore was clear and expansive. It was also great to watch the approaching storm, which moved rapidly. A little expensive but worth a visit."
,,Wonderfully glorious,5.0,,"We stayed for one night and indulged in a spa treatment. The whole hotel experience was superb. Check-in was a little long and one could have construed the time taken to check-in was due to the receptionist writing a short novel, however that was the only minor niggle.

Room was large, stylish and well equipped and staff throughout the hotel were excellent. The spa treatment was the best spa treatment I have ever experienced and the roof top pool and bar were the icing on the cake. One to visit again !"
,,A must visit in singapore,5.0,,"The view from the top floor of marina bay sands sky pro is breathtaking.
Make sure you have enough space in your camera memory card as you will never run short of clicking the birds eye view you get from this place. Preferable go in the evening. You can watch the gardens by the bay evening show and then proceed to here"
,,Upscale Shopping Mall,4.0,,Ideally located on Marina Bay this mall is an upscale shopping experience. Connected across the road is Marina Bay Hotel. All brands local or foreign are there and Mall is beautifully designed. There is a small canal runs through it which offers unique sight. Another attraction is roof garden which offeres stunning view of Marina Bay in night. Food court is small but offers all Asian and European delights.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,"Go to the Tower 3, take a fast elevator to floor 56 and step out into heaven. Even before you board the elevator, a quick photoshoot is arranged, but the photoshopped print is offered at an exorbitant price moment you step out of the elevator. You can choose to buy or ignore.

The viewers gallery is restricted to one level below the top level where the swimming pool is located. If you wish to take a swim there you have to be a hotel guest at Marina Bay Hotel.

Go after dusk and get a picture of Singapore at night from the top."
,,This is the place to get a great view of Singapore!,5.0,,No need for the Singapore Flyer. On top of Marina Sands one can see everything and hang around to take great photos. With a small eating place there aswell.
,,Must Watch !!!,4.0,,Singapore is always famous for infrastructure. Once you reach on top you would be able to cover/see almost whole Singapore. Specially Garden by Bay I recommend to stay at least 1 Night in Marina Bay Sands Hotel (if in budget)
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,the views were amazing.. they were spectacular at night.. you can see pretty much all over Singapore from up there... It was a good way for us to decide what we wanted to go and see also.. the supertree was amazing from up there
,,Worst hotel Ive been to,1.0,,No personal touch on service and people are too cold. My kid had an accident at the pool and the lifeguard didnt care to do anything. The staff are always on guard like youre going to break the law or youre plotting to do terrorize them. Will never go back
,,Amazing facilities and views,4.0,,"You do not have to be a resident of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to have access to the SkyPark on the 57th floor.
The pool and the view from it are stunning.
The bars around the pool and selection of food offered by them match the stunning setting with excellent service.
I visited Spago and the staff could not have been more helpful or welcoming.
The views from anywhere in the SkyPark are breathtaking as is the laser show at about 9pm.
A 'must visit' on your trip to Singapore."
,,View is beautiful,4.0,,I and my cousin went to this park at morning Main thing is the lift used in this hotel is very fast and when we went to upper deck u will see the entire Singapore with a beautiful view Don't miss this guy's
,,Spectacular View,4.0,,"You get a very good view of the City of Singapore, though in the afternoon, it really gets so crowded!"
,,amazing view,5.0,,"located at 56th floor, this attraction offers an amazing view of Singapore..centrally located,this skypark gives you 360 degree panoramic view of the city.. its a cool place to hang around, have some light drinks and chill.. my children loved the view with the beautiful marina bay and towering buildings as backdrop"
,,Go for the View,5.0,,If you want a great view of Singapore this is the spot to go. Amazing complex and unique design with a great pool on top. Well worth the trip.
,,A Great View,4.0,,To get a great view of Singapore go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Very safe even for those with a fear of heights. It gives you a great perspective of the city.
,,Sands!!,5.0,,This Building is Huge and famous for its ship you can see at the top..which is a restaurant. this is the center of Singapores night life and one of the costliest place to be around in Singapore.
,,Hotel is tooo sexy,5.0,,Worth £12 for the ticket to see the skypark. Get to see the whole of singapore. Arial view of the gardens is nice and the 11 aside football pitch on water
,,For interest and the well off.,4.0,,"This is a magnificent complex and worth a visit because of the size, number of stores, inside 'river' and the casino on the top.Plenty of eating places, designer stores and interesting architecture.Is accessible via a boat trip from Clarke Quay"
,,NO facilities - just a view and big fee,1.0,,"Terrible experience. We paid $23 each to go up and down in a lift. Sure there's a good view. But there is NOTHING else. A crappy little store selling a small selection of low quality stuff. No cafe or bar or restaurant (hotel guest only), nowhere to sit. Not even any shade.

It's a rip off. Save your money and spend more time at the brilliant 'gardens by the bay' which is right next door.

Skypark managers: pick up your game, offer SOMETHING for this huge fee."
,,Great city views,4.0,,"We went here at night and had some nice city views of the lights. It was quite crowded but that's to be expected. Souvenir photos are expensive , especially if you opt for the album/frame option at $75 (we only got the individual photo at about $30).

If you have your flight boarding pass you get cheaper entry. Not sure if it's with all airlines but we had Singapore Airlines/Silkair tickets."
,,Must See Place in Singapore,5.0,,Skypark is Top floor of Marina bay sands hotel. where you can see entire Singapore from the sky park
,,Tallest Ship Building,4.0,,"The Skypark is on the 57th floor. and of course the sight is awesome, you can see the entire city and harbour. Marina Bay gardens looks very attractive from this height."
,,A TOURIST TRAP - STAY AWAY!!,2.0,,"The food is sub par; the staff were a bit snooty and I believe our drinks were watered done. The views, however, are outstanding. The hotel itself is iconic so go see but do not spend any S$."
,,Amazing,5.0,,We went there and found a bar on top and that was fabulous. The staff were very pleasant but it was very busy on a hot afternoon.
,,Spectacular Tourist Trap,4.0,,"You can't go to San Francisco without seeing the Golden Gate Bridge or Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower. All incredible engineering feats of their time. So in Singapore you absolutely have to visit the top of Marina Bay Sands. Best to be there about 30mins or so before sunset and watch the city light up. It's sensational.
Be warned- if you go to the observation deck there is no where to sit except on the floor or some steps on the city side which is pretty inconvenient for people using the steps. Not very good for older people to have to stand for so long. You can pay more and join the crowd at the bar but you'd have to be really early for the few seats there. We paid $14 Singapore for a beer. It's a real tourist trap but the view - wow!!!"
,,Fantastic views across the locality,4.0,,"Was advised to visit here by people we met. Although it cost S$ 23.00 per person for the lift to the top it was well worth it. If you can go twice, once during the day and once after sunset"
,,GREAT VIEW BUT POOL CANNOT BE VISITED,4.0,,Disappointed as was expecting to visit the poolside... No access to that... It's like visiting a Khalifa deck or an eiffle tower... No luxury... No setting place but spectacular view at night...
,,Lovely,5.0,,We came here after Gardens by the Bay to have a drink. We were not disappointed. The bar staff was exceptionally accommodating and we had a great drink (Singapore Sling of course) while we watched the sun set.
,,A must stay place for any Singapore visitor,4.0,,Incredible view of Singapore during day or night. Pool on top of the world is really worth experiencing. Treatment is not to our liking.
,,Bird eyes view of Singapore,4.0,,The best time to visit the sky park is during evening time whereby weather is not as hot and get to see the night lights of Singapore skyscrapers and Garden by the bay lightnings. However the entrance Photo shot is too pricey. More expensive than the entrance fee. End up not many people buying the photo. But the view is worth it. Do sit on the floor like everyone else and enjoy the view . Nice :)
,,Good place,4.0,,Its good to go at the top of this building..the view is amazing u can see whole of singapore .the best time to go for top is around 6 pm so u can see the view in day time and in night time also..
,,Great view but very crowded,4.0,,Try to stay at the MBS instead of paying to enter the SkyPark. The view was great but there were too many people both inside the pool and walking around the SkyPark. An alternative to getting the view would be to dine at one of the restaurants in the hotel.
,,best time to visit is at night,4.0,,"The evenings is the best time to visit because you can see all the lights glow up the night and the light show by the lake. The light show is around 8pm. The bar/restaurant has a dress code after 7:30 but you can still hang out on the observatory. If you have a couple hours of layover you can take the subway there. Take the green line then transfer to the blue line, Stop #16 on the blue line will take you Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Center. Then just walk across the street to the skypark."
,,Excellent Sky Scrapper with Post Interiors,5.0,,The best sky scrapper in singapore . The view is very amazing. Would suggest to visit this atleast once. Its easily accessible in MRT. The building is like a ship with three pillors supporting it
,,Remarkable,5.0,,"Infinity pool is really outstanding, don't miss the evening laser show.Such a big casino. Vegetarian food not available should drive back to Little India."
,,Tourist Trap,1.0,,"Just don't do it!!!! You will get an excellent view. But this is an uncomfortable, tourist trap. You are not treated well and it is un necessary."
,,A must do,5.0,,Amazing view of Singapore. We went when it was not too busy. Reasonable price. Shame you can't use the swimming pool.
,,"Great views, no time restriction",4.0,,Been there in the evening. Go to the Bayfront MRT and from there follow directions. The views from the top are spectacular. watched the laser show at 8 pm from the top. Best part is there is no time restriction at the top.
,,"Crowded, poorly serviced changing rooms but great view",3.0,,"The view is perfecto! Amazing pool design and ambiance is well thought of. Nevertheless, due to the large number of hotel guests at the pool when I was there (a public holiday weekend) the service at the pool was poor. The cafés and some of the restaurants need to be redesigned and rethought as there is a lack of a warm ambiance in most of them! Would I want to go up there again- not worth it really. Once is enough. I see nothing strong enough to draw me back. However if you love cityscapes from infinity pools like I do, give it a try. Perhaps a public holiday is the wrong time to go! Try to avoid that period."
,,Amazing building to look at but a bit disappointing,3.0,,"This iconic building is amazing to look at, but because of its infamous view from the top and excelllent shopping mall and casino opposite, it is mainly a tourist attraction and is a bit soul less. That said the view from the top is spectacular and if you have a drink in the Cei la Ve bar on the 57th floor you do not have to pay the fee to access the observation deck"
,,Great views,4.0,,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands hotel, so had free access as guests of the hotel. It was an exciting spot to take your time and enjoy the views that Singapore had to offer, also a good spot to see the night lighting of the Gardens by the bay"
,,Sky high,5.0,,"57th floor with club lounge access and infinity pool. Breakfast and snacks and great views of Singapore city and harbour and famous Singapore Lion statue, sky forest.
View of army jet plane flying over doing practice manoeuvres.
Infinity pool is always crowded! Night club is too.

Food is average and limited choices compared to other club lounges we have stayed in. Plenty of staff to cater to ur request. More food choices please."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Been there at night and even though I'm not a big disco fan I enjoyed the place and especially the great view you get from up there. When in the pool looks like you're on the edge of nothing, quite exciting (or scary, depends on you)."
,,A pool and view that is unsurpassed,5.0,,"Well worth the ticket or the cost of a drink, the pool is spectacular and the views from the pool and the bar area of the Singapore CBD and the surrounding areas are great during the night or day- easily takes you mind away from the heat of the city. What a way to get refreshed."
,,On Top of The Singapore Sky,5.0,,"I have my numerous visit to the Skypark since MBS was opened. Besides the initial visits with my family members, mainly, I brought many international visitors up to the Skypark and I have always very proudly told them.....if this is your first trip into Singapore, or if you are running a very rush trip into Singapore, I am here bringing you for a very quick tour to view Singapore city skyline......
All my visitors are very satisfied.
I am just very happy and proud to recommend this to all the visitors into Singapore. From here, you can see the Indonesian and Malaysian mountains on a clear weather day....
Thank you for visiting Singapore, and wish you a good trip to this very unique and beautiful Singapore."
,,awsome hotel,5.0,,"Excellent hotel i had seen in singapore. because by see this hotel we can easly understand how this singapore people love the nature and green ness. its splended and min blowing place. its place of heaven .i think so. ecxellent service, fair rooms ,awsome seeneries, near parks, and very near to raffles place. and easy mmts connections and bus services. and big gardens .its an eye candy to be have here."
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,It's amazingly high up and has fantastic views of Marina Bay. It tends to be quite busy with tourists. Make sure to carry a selfie stick to capture some great pictures.
,,"The view from the pool is breathtaking, especially at night.",4.0,,"Try and get a room in Tower One, as the lift goes straight up to the pool. If you are staying in Towers Two or Three, you have to swap lifts to get to the roof pool. Breakfast at the hotel is brilliant."
,,Best view,5.0,,its rather expensive but its worth it. best view from the city. it gives you a complete new prespective of the magnitude of Singapore
,,The place to see the city,5.0,,"There are many places to get different sky views of Singapore city centre, but for me, this is the best.
A trip up to the 57th floor sky terrace (free, unless you want a drink) gives 360 • views of the city, the islands off Singapore (& the port).
Great places for couples to have a relaxing drink and the only place I visited where the breeze made the temperature comfortable! (At 6pm)"
,,Fantastic views; but the best comforts are reserved for cardholders,4.0,,"The Skypark is definitely worth a trip. If you're just there for sightseeing, go early (after dark but early enough to avoid the night-club transition)."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,The views are amazing from the bar on the top floor. The walkways are clean and full of beautiful plants and flowers . Avoid busy times if you can.
,,Nice View,5.0,,"The Skypark provides a great view of Singapore, and the coast line of neighboring Indonesia. I recommend going later in the afternoon, allowing you to see the City during the day and towards sunset. Drinks and light food are also provided."
,,Attending communication asia,4.0,,This place is good but you have all the most expensive brands at the shopping mall not the average sale kinda thing.. Not too many options for food so you have to kind of go out... Place to a bit too long and you can get lost.. Only clothing and perfume shops nothing related to IT even though a lot of conventions happen here
,,Sky park visit,4.0,,Spectacular views across Singapore A must see Charge of about ten pound well worthwhile Lift is fast and not too crowded Disappointed lift stops one stop from the top which is only open to hotel guests Coffee shop at top but no seats !
,,Free if you stay at MBS,3.0,,"If you aren't staying at the Marina Bay Sands, you can take on the view of the city from up above via Skypark after paying for your ticket. It's actually roomy at the observation deck, but if you see a long line of people waiting to buy tickets you'd be better of coming back later. After taking your selfie from the deck, take a walk towards the infinity pool to see what you're missing (or not) regarding the next best thing at MBS."
,,awesome view,5.0,,"It was rainy afternoon when we visited marina bay sands skypark. I had the most delicious king prawn laksa , very friendly staff and amazing view .Great experience"
,,Expensive swim but worth it,5.0,,"4 of us booked into a family room so we could swim on the pool. Worked out very reasonable pp, and well worth it. Views were stunning, expecially as the sun set and all the lights started to come on in the city. The pool area is split so kids have their own pool, and are not allowed in the adult pool. Service is excellent and everyone is really attentive. Not ideal when it starts to rain, though there are lots of other things to do inthe hotel and shopping area until the sky clears"
,,Gary brasher,4.0,,"Very popular by the crowds. Had lunch at the restaurant ces't Le vie I think it was called, was expensive but the food was good and the view over Singapore was fantastic as was the service."
,,"Whatever really! Overpriced, and useless. Go opposite to Swissotel Stamford to have a better view.",2.0,,"So we wanted to visit the Skypark (mostly for the kids). We are 4 people so going up there would have cost us something like SGD 80.00.
As we were about to pay, we were told there was a private function and we couldn't stay more than 15 minutes on the top. So of course we asked if we still had to pay the same price, and we were told they don't give any discounts. When we argued that maybe we would want to stay a bit longer, we were told coldly: ""anyway, there's nothing to do up there. You pay, you go up, you take pictures and you come down!""... needless to say we didn't do all these things as we were frankly pi**ed off by such a bad service.
instead of that we went to Equinox on top of the Swissotel Stamford, it's even higher and we got to see the Skypark from there. And have some food. And the service is great, for just a bit more. Really not worth wasting your time."
,,"View from the ""boat "".",4.0,,Any visit to Singapore should include a trip in the high speed lift to the viewing deck of the Skypark . You get very good views out over the city and down to the river and the Gardens by the Bay . And don't forget to look out at the shipping lanes . When the sun shines on the water it makes for a memorable photo .
,,Just a view tower,3.0,,"It is a beautiful piece of architecture for sure, but it is nothing much other that a point from which you can get a bird's eye view of Singapore. Sands sky park - an observatory on 56th floor of the Marina Sands Hotel with a terrace built in the shape of a ship where one can walk around enjoying a panoramic view of the entire city at a not so cheap rate of 30 SGD per person."
,,Best view,5.0,,"Great view of Singapore, coast to coast. Take your camera, you can get a drink at the bar on top and relax. You can't get into the area with the infinity pool though that's for hotel guest only. It does cost to go up, not so cheap can't remember exactly but it was over $20 SD"
,,Wow,5.0,,"Absolutely breath taking, almost 360° views of Singapore from the 56th floor. We visited at just before sunset and would definitely recommend visiting at that time of day"
,,"Amazing view, Must watch",4.0,,"Unbelievable views and great pictures at night. Luckily, we had no wind, clear sky and warm temperature. Such a great experience, the view was amazing!! My chid enjoyed it too!"
,,Breathtaking views!,5.0,,"Very nice place. Well put together. The only complaint I had is that the staff wasn't able to start a tab using my credit/debit card from the USA. It wasn't that they were unable to, it is just that they didn't want to treat it like a credit card. This is the only place in Singapore I have ever been to that has ever complained."
,,the best infinity pool,5.0,,in the skylark there is the best infinity pool of the world and 3 bars full of beautiful people. There is one must go
,,View the city from the skytop,4.0,,"The hotel itself seems pricey, but going up to the skyview floor was amazing. The city
view is spectacular, you can see the super trees and all other major attractions in Singapore from high above. Very crowded and very hot from noon and later on- go either early morning, or late at night."
,,"Great drinks, excellent view",5.0,,"There is a bar on the 57th floor of tower 1 and tower 3. Goto the one on tower 3 since it has a view of the Singapore Flyer and the rest of the city. Drinks are a little pricey ($24 SGD each) but they are made with precision and are amazing. Food is also offered, though I didn't have any.

I brought a book and spent an hour up there. Very relaxing. Tell the people in front of the elevator that you want to go up for a drink so you do not have to pay to go up."
,,Dinner on Level 57,3.0,,"Ate at Ce La Vi - great dinner. Sat overlooking gardens - not city which was a shame but not the end of the world. Hotel guest ONLY have access to Observation Deck, and Members Only get to be near the pool. Get there before sun goes down and watch the city lights come to life."
,,An unparalleled view,4.0,,"The views from the Skypark are the best the city has to offer - a bit pricey though. However, having visited over a weekend, the place was full of tourists, each trying to capture the 'perfect shot'."
,,Great holiday,5.0,,It was a great place to stay for holiday. The check in counter staff was efficient adn excellent. However more improvement needed for other hotel staffs that were on duty. They dont great the guest when they see one.
,,Great city view,4.0,,Just went to top level for the view and a drink. Worth the visit but the great pool was so crowded it did not look that inviting.
,,Only place to stay.,5.0,,"Initial thoughts was that it was very touristy but will state that I was blown away how perfect everything was.

We had a Grand Club room which was massive, with amazing views over the Gardens by the Bay and a deep tub with views over Marina Bay and the Singapore Flyer.

Service was amazing, and Club 55 access came with room which was what made it worth the price as Buffett breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés service (and flowing alcohol which is way expensive in Singapore) was all included.
Only went for breakfast and canapés but sure that the a/tea would have been magnificent too.

Skypark- wow, wow, wow. Surreal and amazing. Went at sunset and during the day. Pinch myself views.

Highly recommended.

And highly recommend the hotel spa. Amazing."
,,Not the Ideal Skypark to Watch the Stars!,4.0,,"The Island City is just too lighted everywhere for the Star Gazers to catch even a glimpse of our night sky, unlike such in Banyan Tree Villas, Bintan Islands, just one hour by ferry from our Ferry Terminal !
But the MB Sands Skypark remains our top-of-the-world vantage point to view almost our entire 700+ square km domain.
What is AUD25+ compared to such spectacular vista, as some visitors have complained : when one could be lured to burn one's entire life's savings in the Skypark's basement casino ?!"
,,A must do Singapore activity,4.0,,"I found a similar experience on both of Level 56 & 57 bar restaurant. Depending if with more persons in group. Getting there around 5-6ish & ask lift attendant to go to bar as view is quite amazing, as is view from the Sky Park. A drink at bar similar to ticket entry price to Sky park & bar food very expensive & poor quality so wouldn't recommend food. After dark the bar becomes restaurant & a much stricter dress code is applied to the casual dress clothing & footwear prior to this. I believe is 8pm the change over, or maybe tad earlier."
,,Great View but that's just about it!,3.0,,The place gives you a great view of Singapore and lets you take great photos but that's just about it. I just don't think it's worth the price you are paying.
,,A beautiful view overlooking the whole city of Singapore,5.0,,A beautiful view overlooking the whole city of Singapore. ill hope to visit again Absolutely amazing view.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Love the view! Perfect overview of the skyline of Singapore from Marina Bay. No MRT nearby, bus ride or taxi but Singapore is just so convenient to go anywhere!"
,,Hotel guest,5.0,,Seen as hotel guest definitely worth it on a clear day get a fabulous view of the city and view of the garden by bay amazing also beautiful at night with city in lights. X
,,Good views,4.0,,Great views when the sun is shining - otherwise pick you day. Expensive by world standards but a good way to appreciate Singapore. Much better at night with a good drink i.e. a cocktail but they are not cheap.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"Went for staycation and free access to the skypark. It has a nice view with many tourists. However, it may not be worthwhile if we were to pay to have access tpo it."
,,A must see,5.0,,Marina Bay sands is a visit card of SGP. A must see place. A wonderful and absolutely unforgettable view opens from the skypark.
,,'On Top Of The World',4.0,,"The Skypark is a must if you want a feeling of being on top of the world. I think it's a tad expensive at $23 SG equals $23.15 AU just for a elevator ride and a lookout but it is what it is. Before entering the elevator a photograph is taken of you or your group which you are able to purchase before leaving. Very pricey though with the basic cardboard cover photo at $35 SG and 2 other offers even more expensive. Look the view is amazing and wow you do not realise how many ships are anchored until you see them from the air. There is a kiosk with refreshments & snacks to purchase and a bar as well but l'm not sure if you can just walk in or if you have to be a guest of the hotel. If you are lucky enough to view the light show which is on every night of the week it's great. I was at the Fairmont Hotel opposite and got a perfect view every night if l was in my room. I noticed it was on twice during the 8.30 to 9.30 timeslot. It goes for about 5 minutes or so and the lasers constantly change colours Regardless check it out a must do attraction see my photos.
Happy Travels"
,,Sightseeing,4.0,,"Really really nice, long way up but well worth the $23 AUD to go up. Had a Singapore sling at $30 a bit expensive but was very nice."
,,"Must visit place, while at Singapore",5.0,,"We had an excellent evening time with our kids. We enjoyed a lot in this area, entry to this area is free."
,,Best view of land and sea,5.0,,"This is the best place to catch full view of Singapore's main city. MBS is between land and sea, and you get beautiful view of both land and sea from top. It is taller than flyer. And you can stay here for longer period and no one will question. You can get soft drinks and beers on top ( expensive ).Visitors will not be allowed to go to infinity pool. The view from the top is stunning."
,,great hotel,4.0,,love the pool. very nice hotel with a freindly staff. great restaurants and shoppimg possibilities. stayed a few nights and even got to try the night life. an overall good experience with the hotel
,,"Good views, a bit crowded",5.0,,"Reached the top immediate after the sunset so the crowd was thicker. Views are worth it. There was a long queue to get down. There is another option, just double in price, a floor lower (see my other review for Cheese and chocolate bar) that might be a better choice if raining or to avoid the crowds."
,,wonderful experience,5.0,,NOBODY should leave Singapore without going to the tower we went in the morning and i would imagine it gets very hot after noon the views are unbelievable What an amazing city.It is well worth the money and very easy as you go up all the way in the lift FOR SENIORS THIS IS NO TROUBLE .We spent an hour Such peace and tranquility Afantastic experience and the photo taked well worth the money
,,it was Tooo Hot,4.0,,great experience - tho it was too hot! They charge for the walkways - and be prepared for queues! I wasn't - it was around 110 deg - so I bought water and limped back!
,,Just for the view,3.0,,The view is amazing !! The service could be better for a costly place... Drinks are not cheap but I just its cos of the view...
,,As far as the eye can see (of Singapore),4.0,,"Going here is definitely on your bucket list if you visit Singapore. I really like the view (and I bet it would look even more amazing at night, but I have yet to witness this), but you really have to take a lot of pictures and take your time so that you can make the most of the 29SGD you have to pay for to get to the viewing deck.

There's no shade, and the stuff they offer there are overpriced, so be prepared to get some sun if you're going in the morning until the afternoon. We were there at a time where there weren't many people (Monday), but I also went there another time when it was the peak. Once or twice is enough, and maybe a third time if I get to see the view at night."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"It's beautiful and lovely place. One can view the entire Singapur specialy at night. Any one visiting Singapore must visit this place. At times it become crowded at lifts while going up n coming down. Laser show was so beautiful. It's has hotels, shopping malls and casino. It's worth visiting place."
,,Terrific views from the 57th floor,4.0,,This was a unique experience. This is a 5+ star hotel with a lovely casino and there is a viewing deck on the 57th floor which offers breath-taking views of the skyline and well lit surroundings!
,,Experience the express lift,5.0,,"The express lift takes you from ground level to the 57th floor in a couple of minutes and you will feel the rapid acceleration in your ears. That in itself is an experience. The view from the top floor is amazing. You can view the supertree grove from up above and that is the most recommended view to watch that attraction too. You can even see the islands of Indonesia from that height.

You can see all the riches of the world in display here. A place where big money flows endlessly."
,,Food with Sunset to die for.,5.0,,"Wonderful food, lots of choices and the only thing I waited for is the Sunset. We tried the pairing menu
1. Irish Oysters, Nashi pear, cucumber and coriander Salsa, 2. Seared Salmon Black Pepper Coated, Fennel, wakame, ponzu, 3. Snapper Ceviche Red onion, chilli, corn, coriander. Finally had the Matcha Lava Tart Molten lava, Valrhona Manjari 64% cocoa ice cream. Sooo yumm...paired with Sämling 88 Beerenauslese.ooh lala."
,,Breathtaking sunset view,4.0,,"Catch the lift to Ce La Vi at Tower 3.
We paid $25 per cocktail & stood watching a perfect sunset - a better idea than spending $25 to catch a lift to the viewing platform one floor below.
Stunning if you are lucky enough to score a clear sky. We stayed for 1 1/2 hours."
,,HAWK EYE view,5.0,,"Probably the tallest viewing deck in whole of Singapore, this place gives panoramic view of Garden by the bay, Marina Barrage, cluster of skyscrapers lined up in Marina, Singapore flyer, etc. Finding the entrance of this place at the ground level is bit tricky, but once you are on the deck, you can spend as much time as possible.Just before the sunset is the ideal time to visit this place to get good day as well as night views.
Do not miss this place."
,,high around the sky,5.0,,"tranquility of this place is adorable, enjoying city few and infinity pool is amassing, once need to be trying...,"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Amazing view! windy breezy.. best during evening times.. have a dslr with you for superb photgraphy.
,,The View... OMG,4.0,,"The view is by far the best thing about this hotel. Yes there is a lot of shopping, but it is not near anything else to see in Singapore. Just go to see the shopping and the Skypark."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,We opted to not pay the $29 per person to go to the viewing deck and instead we went to the bar which is one level up. This was free. We brought a couple of wines and enjoyed the stunning view! The pool is something that has to be witnessed to be believed! Make sure you pop a visit to Marina Bay on your list.
,,Excellent views over Singapore,5.0,,"Been here a few times for different things and the views are excellent as is the pool. Bars, restaurants and nightclub at night has everything. Not cheap but worth it"
,,Great view,5.0,,Fantastic view of Singapore sky Line and worth it just for the pictures. I would probably opt for this rather than the wheel as you are not time limited and have more room and angles for photos.
,,Nice hour walking around,4.0,,"The cool house was the main thing we wanted to see, short walk through the green house to see the display, well set up and good information about what was in there. We wondered around the other displays, So clean and well maintained and the entrance free was only $5 worth spending and hour or more depending how interested you are in plants."
,,Best place to see complete singapore,4.0,,Best place to see complete singapore. Best time to go is 5 pm . So you can cover day and night view. better to go at weekdays to avoid crowd.
,,Great facilities but overcrowded.,4.0,,"My wife and I spend 3 nights in Singapore and stayed at another hotel, however we had dinner at the roof top restaurant at Marina Bay Sands. The food was lovely but portions were small. The scenery was of course, incredible! The staff were helpful but we're very rushed due to the amount of people at the hotel. There really were far too many people and it almost spoilt what is a truly fantastic place.
On a more positive note, the roof top bar really is something incredible. The views in the evening were amazing and we absolutely loved it for that reason."
,,Great view. Rushed by tour guide.,4.0,,"We visited the skypark at night, and the views are spectacular. It's a great vantage point for the Gardens by the Bay light show. The views of Singapore is quite expansive. It's a shame we could only spend 15 minutes admiring the scenery as we were rushed by our RMG rent a car tour guide."
,,Good view,4.0,,"Some stunning views of Singapore from all directions and well worth the visit.
It is a pity that there is little shade and no tables to sit and take it all in whilst having a cold drink.
One of the best times to go is at dusk when the light shows are all taking place but be warned it gets very busy"
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,This was a birds eye view of the city! Very nice and really cool space to hang with colleagues. Drinks are great and the vibes is phenomenal.
,,Take the SkyPark experience!,5.0,,"If you don't have the cash to stay at this hotel, you can pay a nominal fee to view Singapore from the top of this hotel. Atay as long as you want to stay. There is a food/bar atop. Plan tour visit before dark and olan on staying late to view the lights over the city. Only guests have access to the pool area but no problem there. Take the MTR to Marina Bay Sands (Mall) and walk to the hotel from the MTR station."
,,Magical and electric,5.0,,"It was as if Vegas was in Asia. The resorts and hotel itself is a wonder added to that are the shoppes @ Marina Bay plus the Gardens by the Bay (dont miss the Light show at the gardens) and to top it off at the peak of the hotel is the infinity pool. Marina Bay Sands is a must see and while at the mall, don't forget to visit the food court and have tea at TWG Teahouse."
,,My most favourite skyline view at Singapore,4.0,,Love the skyline view of Singapore from the skypark at Marina Bay sands. I spent couple of hours one evening from the rooftop at MBS. It is wonderful to get a hot chocolate at the cafe and spend a good hour or so trying to spot the various popular places across the city from up above. It is quite windy at the top.
,,Great view of city,4.0,,Its a bit pricey but worth the visit if you want great views of the city. A great photo taking opportunity.
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,Being in Singapore visiting the marina bay sands skypark is worth a visit. Once at the top you will enjoy the view. Just be careful to visit on a clear day!!!
,,Awesome view of Singapore but it was cloudy,4.0,,"I have been wanting to up this building for years since watching a documentary on it. I was so excited and it never failed to amaze me this structure. You can see so many great things from a high stand point. It doesn't get 5 stars because even though you can't predict the weather it was hard to see far due to a lot of haze and cloud. It was too expensive to buy anything from the small stand at the top also. Its a good price to go but would recommend going on a nice sunny day, if possible."
,,Stunning view,4.0,,It's really an amazing place can enjoy the scenery and beautiful view... Perfect place for photography with overlooking singapore... It's just the moment you need in singapore
,,Breathtaking architecture!,4.0,,Marina is one hotel which has to be seen for its sheer architectural magnificence. The skypark is accessible from Tower Three. For those of you wanting to give flyer a miss (shouldnt though) you can see Singapore on the Skypark. You cannot go to the infinity pool if you are just a Skypark visitor. There is a direct access from Gardens by the Bay through the bridge.
,,Good views,3.0,,"A bit disappointing really.
Views are fantastic as you would expect but for $28 each it's an expensive viewing point! For the $28 all you can do is walk around the very tip of the cantilevered end. If you go up another flight of stairs you can just about see the infinity pool. I believe you can go in the bar/restaurant but the prices are very high approx $50 per drink!!

Views are obviously awesome but it's expensive for what it is."
,,View at a Cost,5.0,,"We booked into the Marina Bay Sands restaurant for lunch on a Sunday. The views were extraordinary and well worth the visit. The quality of our food and service was good but extremely expensive in that lunch cost me $680 and the Singapore dollar is almost dollar for dollar with Australian dollars so this price was a bit of a shock. If you eat there, please try the Chef's desert selection - for only $40, this is excellent value even if you only photograph it as almost everyone in the restauant did when we ordered it. Photo opportunity was great."
,,Do not miss it by any chance,5.0,,"We chose this over the flyer. I guess it was a good decision. This is taller than the flyer and gives you better view of the city. Plus you can stay as long as you want as the flyer ride is about 30 minutes. The express lifts takes you to the observatory. There is a restaurant which is only for the inhouse guests and so you cannot enter. The other half of the terrace is the infinity pool of the hotel. There is a kiosk providing water, slush, beers and other souvenirs.
The views are amazing and there are notes and indicators on the periphery explaining the eminence of each landmark. Only way the flyer beats the observatory is that it is air conditioned :). Phew! damn hot out there. But worth the visit. Please take your camera and do not forget your best lens. If you are a selfie person, you will get many opportunities. A must visit."
,,Waste of money,2.0,,Not worth going up to top of hotel. Only allowed on wooden part of terrace. No where to sit. Very nice view but that's as far as it goes!
,,I made it to the peak,5.0,,I did not expect i would able to reach its peak. We came for a quick visit in Singapore but this experience was fun and memorable.
,,Tough to fork over big $ to see a view,3.0,,"I guess we are glad we did it, but $23 to ride an elevator to a platform to see the lights of Singapore? There were probably other ways. By the time we got around to it, it was too late to go for the $25 cocktail option at the bar one level up. No seating. I haven't confirmed this, but a pretty reliable source said you could go to the top of Tower 1 and observe the view over a $15 beer. Maybe the cheapest option. Can't say I would recommend this."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"This attraction blew us away, it was absolutely amazing.
The views of Singapore were gust magnificent. It's not quite 360 degree but close enough You can spend as much time as you want just taking photos or just wandering about. You can have a drink or something to eat as well but,be prepared to pay phenomenal amounts. There is also a gift shop ."
,,A SPECTACULAR MODERN DESIGN,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is actually at the top of a massive, 3-walled hotel, just across the road from Gardens by the Bay. Each of the 3 towers has concave-shaped sides, topped by an amazing boat-shaped construction. To take the lift to the Observation Deck costs around $20 (Singapore dollar almost equal to Australian). The place is heavily commercialised and crowded with tourists but the views are spectacular. The ground floor features an extraordinarily impressive restaurant and 'canal' type waters you can take a boat ride on. If you go to Singapore, this is a must-see place."
,,Not worth it.,2.0,,"I was a guest at the Marina Bay Hotel but not my friends... we went together to this side of the roof deck. Around $20 to go up.. if I remember. You have no access to the pool from here if you are not a guest, so if that is what you are looking for, do not waste your money. The view is incredible, but you get harassed by the photo guys as soon as the elevator opens. We were ready to go and we were waiting for one of our friend using the bathroom,,, and a staff came very rudely accusing my friend of taking a photo of our own photo. After my friend told him and showed him that was not the case, he never apologized to us. made us feel like criminals. (The hotel and the other side were amazing as you can see on my review of the marina Bay)"
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,"The views from here are incredible, you are higher than the flyer, it is a bit scary if like me you are scared of heights, but I could still appreciate the amazing views. If you can hang on for darkness it is even better. Open all day"
,,Worth the $28 just for the view,4.0,,"I was hesitant about going here expecting it to be over rated and expensive. Glad I made the effort. Extraordinary views of Singapore over the harbour, the business district, river, the gardens and out to sea. Stunning. Very few sight seeing spots are better than you expect. This is one of them. We went around 2.30pm and spent 2 hrs admiring the changing view and taking photos. The hotel itself is beautiful and well worth a walk around. Impressed."
,,Plenty of ways to enjoy the view,4.0,,"You cannot move from one end of the MBS rooftop to the other (I.e. between observation deck / restaurant/ bar / pool without transiting at the ground floor lobby. So unless you have the luxury of time in Singapore, the trick is to choose which of these you want to drink in the superb view from (and spend your money on).

Preferences vary, but as a local who has tried the whole gamut, can I suggest that those of you who may baulk at paying the entry fee to the skypark consider getting light bites and a cocktail instead at the rooftop bar, Spago. Cocktails are excellent, you can linger in comfortable lounge chairs, you get a 180 view, and the vibe is great. Or head to CÉ LA VI which offers an even better view. You'll spend a bit more, but you get way more than an elevator ride to the observation deck.

This isn't the Eiffel Tower; there are plenty of options to enjoy the same rooftop. Enjoy!"
,,Great view hideously expensive drinks,4.0,,"As stated ,the view is spectacular,but this wins the prize for the most expensive beers ever 1 stella 1 corona $42 singapore for 2 beers!! They also serve food good luck!"
,,Poor service for such expensive place,1.0,,"While the view and the setting is beautifull, a lot more work has to be done in terms of customer service. We were with a group of colleagues, one of the glass broke. The waitress response was a bit unqualified for this kind of outlet selling expensive cocktail. I recommend for the view but value for money is definitely not there."
,,Any timr,5.0,,"Mandatory to be there, if I have to chose I would like night drink to enjoy the wind and the view over SG bay. Price are related where you are."
,,It was alright!,4.0,,"Amazing views, great to go with friends! Took a lot of nice pictures and the weather of course was spectacular!"
,,One of the best city/pool views on the planet,5.0,,An incredible place for a swim or a sunbake or a drink. 650ft up splashing around in an infinity while looking out across the Singapore CBD skyline. If only other cities had such locations. Also the best photo opportunity in the city state.
,,"what can one say , did they really build this",5.0,,"an other one of dose what man is possible of doing , , but don't eat there , well overpriced and substandard , in proportion to cost"
,,Singapore View,5.0,,"A great place to go to as the sun goes down in Singapore. The roof top bar is a great place to wind down after a long week.

Stunning views of how this country has grow to be the magic it is in just 50 years."
,,Great day out,5.0,,You cannot go to Singapore without seeing this stunning building. It takes up such a big area and makes you feel small when standing under it. Well worth a visit.
,,A city by itself,5.0,,Once you are inside Marina Bay Sands you are fulfilled . The 57th floor is a unique place to dinin and the magnificent swimmingpool is out of the world. The shopping arcades are expensive. The food court is fantastic.
,,best view in Singapore,5.0,,Had a few drinks at the top and it was a great view. If you are not a hotel guest you can still enjoy a limited area of the upper deck but not the pool. There is food which looked great but we did not eat. I highly recommend the trip up to the top for the view!
,,"Ce La Vi Skybar, Level 57, Marina Bay Sands",5.0,,"This is a world class bar with a view. What an experience! Can see the entire city of Singapore, accompanied by the sounds of chic music and cocktails being shaken. Periodically laser lights pierced the sky. It's truly a cocktail bar - couldn't find wine on the drinks list, (although there is a separate dining section, so perhaps one can get wine there.) No matter; we loved our Margaritas and Gin and Tonics. We got there by being dropped off at the end of our riverboat cruise (departs near the Merlion) then took the MRT train back to our hotel. A bucket-list worthy experience."
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,You have to go to the top but it is crazy busy and extremely expensive to eat and drink there... You will always remember the experience and the view.
,,A box worth ticking,4.0,,"Its a bit gimmicky but the views are amazing. Its an experience worth doing when in town, the restaurants are good and its not cheap but its all part of the tourist experience"
,,One of the best views in Singapore,5.0,,I loved being there and seeing the city from so high. The only pity is that from such a position you miss one of the most characteristic building of the city...the one on which you are! It's anyway a must if you're going to visit Singapore.
,,light show and flip flops,3.0,,"good lightshow at 8pm and 9.30pm - best viewed from opposite the skypark.
we were not allowed in the bar at 10pm as my male colleague was wearing flip flops - and not per the dress code. apparently ok before 10pm. and ok shorts and close-toed shoes after 10pm. you can still access the deck for a view."
,,Most extraordinary location and futuristic design.,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands has to be experienced to be believable. It is an engineering marvel with great rooms, fabulous service, magnificent shopping with soaring interiors. The roof top swimming pool is just beyond belief with it's magnificent views of Singapore and where the poolside service is just sensational."
,,Pricy But Worth It,4.0,,At $23 each it was not cheap but the views are spectacular and worth every penny. Just make sure you take a hat or umbrella as the viewing deck has no shade and is extremely HOT.
,,Not too impressed,3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is fantastic, but i think the view is much better from 1 altitude if you are going just for the view"
,,Holiday Singapore,5.0,,"Great view of a night we had dinner there,great service good food,is a bit expensive but it is a have to do in Singapore"
,,Fantastic views and restaurants,5.0,,"Went with friends, walked round at the top and saw some fantastic views. Can see several land marks from the sky deck. Best to go near sunset for sunset. Felt so nice and relaxing chilling place. Highly recommended to visit."
,,Staycation with friends,4.0,,"I like the new rules they implemented, to go to the infinity pool. 1 card 1 person policy. It means that hotel guest have their privacy while enjoying their swim at the pool. It is not like that way before that anybody can go up if you lend your room card to go upstairs to swim.
This will give hotel guests now more privatized moment at the pool, and to avoid overcrowding of the pool."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"For under $s25 this is a must do while your in Singapore. The views are spectacular and there's so much room on the viewing deck to walk around freely.

The only thing I disliked is they try and hustle you into buying photos, you have no choice in getting your pic taken before you go up."
,,Highest point of Singapore,5.0,,"This will be highest point to watch Singapore, it is bit expensive but this is not time limit so you can take enough time to stay"
,,Expensive but worth it,4.0,,Expensive but worth the experience 👌 enjoyed their pool. Plenty of guests on selfies everywhere and seems to be enjoying every minute 👌 staffs are friendly and professional
,,Luxurious hotel!,5.0,,"I did not stay in the hotel but it seems to be so luxurious. The view from the lookout is incredible. The photo the took to you in the first floor is already printed when you arrive at the 56th level, it is so fast! That photo is a really good memory! it really worth it."
,,An excellent dinner,4.0,,"This is a hotel but we only ate dinner. Entering the enormous building did not make us feel we would want to stay in the thousands of rooms, but we had an excellent tasting dinner on the 54th floor restaurant which was well served, beautifully cooked and presented, and with unusual views around the city and port. Good for a one off visit!"
,,MBS is a different world,5.0,,"MBS is a different world. Everything worth experiencing! Its stay, skypark, infinity pool, casino, museums, shoppe and lots more. You need a one day to spend a good time here. The light and sound show is outstanding and an emotional one.
It is difficult to share and write much about it as its an experience all should take whenever in Singapore."
,,chill outdoor,5.0,,"marina bay sands area is a new development in singapore so everything seems so posh and modern design. from fullerton bay you can walk through the marina bay sands outdoor and access via mall to the hotel as well.
so if you like to walk and sightseeing its a very nice environment. to jog or just walk.
at night the view of marina bay sands towers is great"
,,The great place to see Marina Bay,5.0,,"The view is stunning up there. You can also have a drink afterward at Ce la vi on 57th floor. It is a one-time ticket. As a result once you get down, you have to buy the ticket to get up there again. My advice is to be up there as long as possible."
,,Quite an experience!,4.0,,A must do for the holiday in Singapore. This orientates you to the whole city and the view of the harbour is educational. Expensive but worth the cost simply to take in the astonishing view and the placement of all the amazing places in Singapore. an excursion here preps you for the rest of your stay.
,,Amazing view but expensive,3.0,,"I went here last night for drinks with a friend and although the building and the view is incredible, it is very expensive!!
2 cocktails (Singapore slings) came to $60.

It is definitely worth going to the top bar and having at least one drink but not somewhere to stay for a night out."
,,Another Overpriced View,3.0,,Great for sightseers who want an amazing panoramic view of Singapore however the cocktails and food were much more expensive than any other location we visited in the area
,,Stunning view but staff were abrupt,2.0,,"This was high on our list of must dos in Singapore, so we proceeded to purchase our tickets $23 AUD ea. The staff member pointed to the area that we were allowed to visit which did not include the pool and the palm tree area. When I asked if we could swim in the pool she again pointed to the area gave me a sour look and shook her head and said abruptly NO. We then took the lift up to the 56th floor to take in the views of Singapore city which were amazing. Unfortunately there was a lot of haze so viewing was restricted.
I can recommend this as a must do when visiting Singapore, but be forewarned that you will not be treated well."
,,Amazing veiws,4.0,,The Marina sands hotel and complex is one hell of a place and must be seen. The hotel part consists of three towers with a roof terrace that looks like a boat on top very iconic. The towers hold 2000 rooms. The roof terrace on the top floor 57 stories up has a infinity pool that can only be used by the guests and can only be accessed by your room key. Tower 3 is where the observation point is and you have to pay s$23 to use it. If on the other hand you don't want pay and would like to see the amazing looking pool and great views from the top use the lifts in tower one. There is also a restaurant on top of tower one that looked reasonably priced. Under the three towers are where some of the worlds top brands have outlets. There's a very large casino which is free to enter for tourists but not so for the residents of Singapore they have to pay s$100. Also in the shopping mall is various eating places and a canal with gondleers on which for a fee you can be paddled around. On the night there are two a amazing laser and water shows which are free 8:00 pm and 9:30 pm are the show times. The land that the hotel and complex sits is on reclaimed land that had to be left sitting for 30 years before being used but that rule is for all reclaimed land in Singapore. The land that the hotel and complex sits on is estimated to be worth 3.6 billion and the cost of the hotel was in the same price bracket. Overall this place has to be seen to be believed. Well worth a trip to see.
,,Rooftop drinks,5.0,,Visited here on the last night in Singapore for drinks in the rooftop bar and what a great way to end the holiday. Amazing atmosphere and drinks with the view across the city. Would certainly come back on my next visit
,,Great Breakfast!,5.0,,"Great breakfast with a great view at the top of Marina Bay Sands! Nice buffet with lots of choices, great service and of course THE view on Singapore!"
,,Great view over the city,4.0,,We chose to go to this attraction at twilight so we could see the city in daylight hoping to see the sunset as the city lights came on. It worked perfectly and I would therefore recommend that you visit at that sort of time. Note that you do not get to go into (or see with any great effectiveness) the infinity pool which runs along on front of the top of the hotel (this is for hotel residents only). There is an entry fee as you might expect but there is no time limit on how long you stay up there. There is a cafe/kiosk to buy food/drinks which is typically expensive but it's quite nice to have a drink up there watching the city lights come on. Certainly something you have to do in Singapore which only missed out on a 5* rating from me because of the irritating insistence at entry to have your photo taken in front of a green screen so you can be superimposed on a photo which they want to sell to you for more than the entry cost!
,,Marina Bay Sands Park,4.0,,"Nice park next to the hotel, you pay $4.00 to be taken on a trolley ride around the park. All other exhibitions, there is an admission charge. Don't be surprised to be charged double if you are a tourist and not local."
,,Must see Hotel,5.0,,"57 Floors to the skydeck worth the elevator up, interesting hotel lots of shopping and Eaterys, Casino shuts at 12 Midnight"
,,Yet another Amazing place in Singapore,5.0,,"This was yet another Amazing place in Singapore myself, wife and kid visited. We were not sure if we could be able to see the top of this building for a great view and Swimming pool on top of this Building but we visited the mall first for a small walk and took the elevator to 57th Floor and then again to the top to witness the Swimming pool on top of this Building and beauty of Singapore from top of this place. There was a bar cum restaurant near the Swimming pool but we did not try this place out this time. May be next time."
,,3 days to swim in the most incredible swimming pool.,5.0,,"Very spécial Hotel. You Have to be a resident if you want to have access to the swimming pool on the top of the building. If your room is under the 20th floor, choose a room with view over the gardens"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"It is worth the ticket cost to climb up to the top of this world marvel, the Marina Bay Sands, to view the whole bay and docks and islands surrounding and enjoy the elegant architecture of Singapore; in addition you can envy the hotel guest enjoy the Infinity pool on top of the building and why not dream to swim there next time in Singapore?"
,,Amazing views but be warned you're seated by wealth!!!,4.0,,The views here are amazing but they spot the tourists (we must stick out a mile) so if you go to the bar for a drink rather than paying for Skypark (which Id recommend as views are the same and drink will cost same as entry to Skypark!!) then be prepared to be seated away from the best seats.... They lump tourists on the dock side and keep the good seats for those flashing the cash.... I felt a little like a third class citizen but soon got over it when enjoying the view and a champagne cocktail!
,,Excellent views,5.0,,Excellent views over Singapore and the bay. Very clean and easy. It takes no time getting to the top with the lifts. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
,,Best Engineering but luxury,3.0,,Its good to see but its very expensive . So i suggest go if you have enough money and you wanna good selfies. And one thing more if you are planning for Singapore then must plan for 9 august . 9th August Singapore's republic day. And the parade at marina bay looks awesome . Its best view from Merlion. So goto merlion then marina bay sand park.
,,Too good.. Must stay in singapore for 1 night,5.0,,Its the best hotel in singapore.. A must stay for atleast 1 night though its not enough.. Smooth check in as we arrived 3.30 pm only.. rooms are very morden and views are very nice.. Infinity pool is best.. only guests are allowed.. best views of singapore.. Casino and shopping is also good
,,What a view!,5.0,,A must in Singapore because of the great view. Possibility to have your foto taken before the lifts. Quick ride up with a lift.
,,A very good view,4.0,,I came in the evening and when I reached this skypark...i was amazed. A very good view of singapore in the night. The entrance ticket was a bit expensive.
,,View s ok,3.0,,"I guess it s all I can tell because I ve paid 23 sing dollars just to take a lift up that hotel and have a look at the view. No access to the restaurant. No access to the hotel itself. I guess it s all good for security but then it s very expensive for what it is.
Disappointing..."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,$23 entry and a very speedy lift all the way up 56 storeys. Worth it and what an incredible view. Next time we will stay at the hotel for the full experience.
,,Worth the visit for the views.,5.0,,An adult ticket is S$23.00. Quick ride in the lift. Amazing views which are identified on information boards all the way round. Take a brolly to provide some shade.
,,Best Hotel,5.0,,The best hotel in Singapore with the best infinity swimming pool on a biggest counter leaver in the world with spectacular and magnificent 360 degree view over metropolitan singapore. The hotel have a nice selection of international restaurant with michelin star.
,,Best view in house,5.0,,Wow what a view. Best way to see Singapore from a different angle. Only let down is the price to go up.
,,beautiful views,5.0,,sunset is the best time to visit. make sure you book in advance though. there is a bit of confusion on which the right tower entrance to ask the taxi guy to drop you off at the right tower to avoid a lonf walk.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is most spectacular with fantastic views all around and it is wonderful for the whole family to whirl around the beautiful Skypark to appreciate the views of Singapore. To me the best time to go is at sunset where you can absorb and admire both the day and the night views and all the most lovely nuances of the dimming into the night.
,,"Don't pay, go for FREE!",3.0,,"I only found this out once I finally got up there and a security guard told me, but of course by this point I had already spent my $23!!!

Simply ask to go to the bar, NOT the observation deck! Because once you get up to the observation deck, you cant just walk into the bar to get a drink either! Stupid rule...pay more, get less. The bar is even elevated so you get more of a view of whats below! If you plan to be there later than 8pm, make sure you wear smart attire though.

The staff are also very rude and treat you like cattle, its even worse than at an airport. ""Move up! Move up!"" Are the only words that come out of their mouths till the lift door slams shut for you to go up. Instead of ripping people off they should invest in training their staff basic customer service.

The whole place is designed like a maze so you cant simply go from a-b, you have to go through a1, a2, a3 etc etc to get there. Its a joke. The only reason this place is getting a 3 is because the view is lovely, if it was purely based on the rest of the experience it would get a 1."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I loved my time here. The views are breathtaking, and the experience feels like a true reward for coming to Singapore."
,,Wow,5.0,,Breathtaking views all around Singapore. Well worth the visit. 58 floors up. Loved it. There is a shop to buy softdrinks etc but no table and chairs to sit down.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,The views are awesome . You can't go all the way to the top but you can still see the pool on the next level. There's a restaurant and larger platform area to get amazing photos. There is a small fee to go up and it took us a good hour or so to find how to get up there. We had to ask security for directions . But it was worth it
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,"If you thought that Singapore flyer was good then this skydeck will blow your mind. It stands higher that the flyer and offers mesmerising views of gardens by the bay, Singapore flyer and marina bay"
,,"Just ordinary, busy",3.0,,I expected to see majestic view but it was just a dream after what I got on there. If you bring children perhaps it is useful but not for adult. Suggested to go bar and felt better!
,,A must in Singapur,4.0,,"If You are in singapure this is a must, i will suggest you go up the hotel, enjoy the amazing views and have a drink. If You are a hotel guest you will have the posibility yo enjoy the pool.....amazing experience, do it"
,,Perfect getaway!,5.0,,"Went with my husband for our anniversary. Even though we are locals, this place gives you the ""I am overseas feeling""... So relaxing and comfortable!"
,,Must see,5.0,,Definitely visit in the mornings to capture the views. Closes if the weather is unfavorable. Enjoy a cocktail while at the top.
,,"Superb views, expensive drinks!",4.0,,"This is an amazing complex, a boat shaped structure on the top of three 56 storey buildings. To access the observation platform only, you need to pay S$20 to,ride the lift to the top; however, if you want to go up to the bar and restaurant, there is no charge and you get the same views. Drinks up there are expensive, but it is a special place and if you go late afternoon and stay for sunset, you enjoy day and night views."
,,Superb view...,5.0,,"This was a great way to get a good view of Singapore for a reasonable price.

If you want to take in the views for a bit longer and in a more comfortable setting then I'd recommend visiting Ce La Vi restaurant. You obviously have to pay a premium for the food but the view is well worth it for a few hours."
,,Must Visit for sure,5.0,,I would recommend this place for any visitor to Singapore. The best time for you to visit is by 6:00pm in the evening as you get an areal view of the city during sunset and also post sunset when the city lights up! Do carry ur cameras as you can take stunning shots of the whole city.
,,Unbeatable selfie location...,5.0,,"My friend and I crashed at MBS for a night of pure extravagance - and it absolutely lived up to its reputation. Order the cocktails, since you'll pay the same amount for a beer up there!

One warning - the pool is absolutely PACKED by 3pm and children tend to be running rampant. I recommend first thing in the morning (from 8am) and last thing at night (after 8pm).

Great people watching as everyone tries to get the best possible selfie from the world's highest infinity pool... Absolutely classic!"
,,swimming pool with nice view,4.0,,when we went there it was so crowded and a lot of people and kids i think you need to avoid holidays time to visit
,,Excellent,5.0,,During one day sight scenes we have visited Marina Bay Sands Skypark which was beyond our imagination.There were number of tourist from various countries.Photography was done which was amazing.
,,The BEST view ever,5.0,,"An absolute must if you're staying in Singapore, what they've created over at Marina Sands is out of this world. Superb views and so reasonable to go up the 55 storeys to the top, only $23, in so many other places it would be twice the price.
No queuing, they've got this operation running so smoothly.
Suggest you go up at night (again the Night tour this is all inclusive) and day as views magnificent and time of day you get a different perspective.
Would love to have had chance for swim in that Infinity pool but alas not staying at the hotel.
Marvel at all those ships out there lit up, makes you realise how busy the port is.
No wonder those who live in Singapore especially the tourist operators are so proud of this!"
,,Nice Way To Spend A Couple Of Hours,4.0,,The Sky Park is just a cool place in general. I'm afraid of heights so naturally I had to get up on them sky bridges! At night they are even more beautiful so I recommend go there as the sun starts to set.
,,AMAZING ARCHITECTURE,5.0,,WE HAD our picture taken it is amazing structure wish i could stay for good......visible in every corner near merlion park
,,The marina bay club,5.0,,We were there on a Wednesday nite... the place was totally where u wanna be... treat music and great crowd... the food is good the best of all u get a great view from the 57th floor....
,,A classic!,5.0,,"Ok you have to pay, you don't have access to the pool and bar obviously but what the heck, the views is stunning!!!"
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"The view from the top is just breathtaking. If you can't afford to stay in that hotel, do visit the skypark. You will have a view of the whole Singapore which is just amazing."
,,Nice View but better if you stay there,3.0,,"We paid $23 singapore dollars during the day to go up to the Skypark viewing area. The price wasn't that bad as it is close to what we pay for a lot of attractions at home in Sydney. The view was really nice and we took some great photos but there really isn't much there as you are at one end of the very top level. There's a gift shop there too with a few souvenirs. I probably wouldn't take anyone there if I was there again with friends.
My parents who were with us said last time they went at night and actually had access to the bar at the top close to the pool which they said was more worthwhile. They didn't have to pay to access that area but the drinks were quite pricey (understandably as tourists who are not staying at the hotel itself).
My brother has also stayed there months before we visited and he said as a hotel guest with access to the pool it is fantastic. If you do go at night to go to the bar I would recommend wearing smart casual clothing as they have a bit of a dress code for the bar (e.g. no thongs etc). So my recommendation would be to only bother going if you go at night to the bar or if you are a guest of the hotel!"
,,Night visit,4.0,,I wonder if folk realised that there was a night light show to music at Gardens by the Bay! Started at 7.45. Only knew it was on by fellow travellers. Pity they dont pipe the music up there to the Skypark. Amazed at efficiency in getting hundreds off the roof and back to the ground. Suggested it was a better option that the big wheel.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Been to SkyPark with Family. All of us loved it. The view from the top is mesmerizing. But there is no place to sit and enjoy unless one wants to sit on ground.

As a tourist, if you want to pick between Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands Skypark , i would suggest Skypark as you can stay there for a longer time and enjoy a better view."
,,Good Looking Building,4.0,,This is a tall & a good looking building. Its like a ship on the top. And it can be seen from afar. And the lights during the nights are wow. The view from there is amazing.
,,Best at night!,4.0,,"We've been in the Skypark twice. We went before lunch but the heavy rain poured out so we did not have the chance to explore the whole place in the daylight. We stayed for almost an hour before the staff informed us that they will be closing the skypark for a while to clean the area (Slippery!). They allowed to come back at night. After we went to Cloud forest we headed back to the Skypark. The view at night is better. From here, you can see the Merlion park, Gardens by the bay, Singapore Flyer, Helix bridge, and many more."
,,Good view,3.0,,"I think there may be paid for tours that take you up to see the famous swimming pool. We went straight to the concierge desk and knowing everyone is there to see the pool, they directed us to the bar which is one level up from the viewing deck where the tour takes you. This costs you nothing. Other than a very expensive drink at the top should you feel obliged to do so, or should you want to sit down. View of pool is from a distance - understandably to give guests some level of privacy - but must admit this is over rated. What is not over rated is the view of the Marina Bay from there. That alone is worth the trip up."
,,Unbelievable view!,5.0,,"I ate ate at Spago's on the roof with a breathe taking view of the city with the Infiniti pool in front. The food was pricey (as expected), but very good! I would suggest eating here vs paying to go the the observation deck. Even the view on the back side was incredible with views of all the ships in the Harbor to the Botanical Gardens down below. A must see if you are in Singapore!"
,,Getting there,3.0,,"New and finding its feet at a service level. Amazing infinity pool at top level but hotel still needs work to make it one of the best, still prefer the Shangri La."
,,Disappointing visit,3.0,,20 dollars to go up in the lift to the rooftop. Very limited access as we were not paying guests at this giant hotel.The views were stunning but it would have been nice to be able to sit and have a drink. The souvenir stall was tacky to say the least and there was no opportunity to view the garden &pool.
,,Waste of time n money,1.0,,Went there expecting to see the infinity pool but we being tourists were herded to a separate bay on a lower floor just to click picture. Most tourists land there in the evening for the view and are tired. It was nothing great ... Just a view to click pics. Total waste of taxi fare n the sky park fare
,,My visit,3.0,,It is a now hotel will shopping mall downstairs and casino its you need to pay if you want to go on 57 floor its nice to visit during sunset picture perfect view
,,Oddest fantastic building,5.0,,"A ship held up by three massive pillars of a 5 star hotel is the most amazing skyline view in Singapore. If your a hotel resident the fabulous roof gardens, pool and bars are free, if not it costs 30 SD to go up, but the experience is well worth the cost"
,,Spectacular views from the top.,5.0,,"Visited last night, 5th May, just on dusk and left an hour later.

Great views over the CBD, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay

Its interesting taking photos before and after dusk...I enjoyed it very much.

Plenty of family and tour groups wandering around - they appeared to be having a great time.

After a hot day in Singapore it was cooler on top with a gentle breeze making it just right. Avoid rain periods as there is no shelter outside to keep you dry.

Go for the views...you won't be disappointed."
,,"""A posh looking surf board""",3.0,,Nothing extra special about the place. Not all areas of the viewing deck are accessible. Avoid going during afternoons or at times when the sun is actively smiling. Good location though and lots of other iconic attractions nearby.
,,8th Wonder of the World,5.0,,This boat like structure perched onto of the 57th Floor of the 3 towers is wholly amazing offering views across the skyline of Singapore. Fantastic restaurant at the top as well.
,,Marvelous,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore but not visiting Marina Bay Sands then you are missing the most fabulous place ir attraction.
This is 6 star hotel offers swimming pool at the top of hotel i.e. 56th floor.
Wonderful view, world class food drnks and atmosphere you name few.
A must visit attraction of Singapore"
,,Certainly different...,4.0,,"Situated in front of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Skypark is definitely worth a look. A modest entry charge and you can wander around the real and man-made 'shrubbery'.
We used the Hop-On, Hop-Off bus to get there, and also to see the City itself."
,,Skypark like above the sky,4.0,,"Awesome view, amazing Singapore skyline, I would have rated 5 but instead rating 4 because they have closed access towards poolside, earlier non residents ere not allowed to use pool but now u would not be allowed to even see pool. Maybe i am mistaken but this is what happened to us."
,,The front desk check-in experience is not good,2.0,,"We went up to the checkin counter at 15:00. Unfortunately, the front desk staffs kept on checking the available rooms again and again. Finally, we had been waiting for almost half an hour right at the front desk. The conclusion was that there was only one room available out of the reserved two rooms. So all of us had to stay in one room first and waited for the readiness of another room. It was really a bad experience for such a grand and luxurious hotel."
,,"""Best view of Singapore""",4.0,,Here is the best view of Singapore. We went on 57th floor and did not want pay for chargeable entrance and it really worth it. Can observe sunset and how city turns into day to night with night lights.
,,Great View,4.0,,"A great view of Singapore to be had from the Skypark, but nothing else. Cost a bit steep, but if you want the view?"
,,An experience like no other,5.0,,"Yes, there's all the hype, but it delivers! There are three pools, with one being Adults Only. Plenty of loungers available, all with a view. You might be jostled by all the 'selfie' takers etc, but still an experience like no other and always a welcome break from the Singapore heat. Enjoyed spending a couple of hours of looking at the incredible view. There is a restaurant bar and gift shop available as well."
,,An amazing hotel,4.0,,This building sores into the sky and has a garden with trees on the top. Inside there is a man made river with gondolas floating up and down if you pay. At one end there is a huge waterfall. Very high end shops along this river and restaurants everywhere. Next to the gardens by the bay.
,,Cé La Vi SkyBar,5.0,,"A sundowner on La Cé Ve SkyBar, at the top of the Marina Bay Sands, is a must when visiting Singapore. The drinks are nice and the view is breathtaking."
,,Too pricey for just a visit,3.0,,"They charge a hefty sum jsut to go to the top and once there it is a limited are and the rest of the property is only for its guests. You even have to pay to get into the casino to lose your money (if you can get in since the line was long in the middle of the afternoon on a Monday!) All the shops are very high end, but nice window shopping with a metro stop right there, and of course the air conditioning is a nice way to get out of the heat for a while."
,,Biggest Rip Off Ever,1.0,,Very disappointed. Great views. Far too many tourist who just push and shove. Not worth the expense. Would not recommend this attraction.
,,Great view but you won't see the pool,4.0,,"It's worth a trip just to take in the view but if you go around 6pm it is likely to be crowded due people go up there to see the light show that takes place at the Gardens of the Bay opposite. Glad we did it, was it actually worth $23 - maybe if you spend a long time up there. The only downside was that there were many people waiting for the show who sat on the deck in large numbers and so blocked the access to the edge and the information boards."
,,Bit expensive but well worth it!!,5.0,,"Singapore $23 to go to the top but the views are amazing. We were disappointed you can't see or get to the amazing pool anymore but really enjoyed the views. There's lots of info in various languages including English that explains what you are looking at & considering how small everything looks when you are up there to how different it looks when you are up the top of the flyer or the conservatory walk ways, you are up really high!!
The hotel lobby & interior is well worth a walk through with lots of designer shops, water features, nice restaurants etc"
,,What a view,5.0,,"Excellent views at night well worth the money, we took some exceptional night time photos of this beautiful city...would definitely recommend everyone to have a look at night the view is captivating"
,,Nice view,4.0,,Ufortnuatly I did not afford to stay in the Hotel so I could have tried the swimmingpool on the top of the building. but what an amazing view there was from the boat deck on top of the 3 pilars.
,,Skypark,5.0,,Fantastic Views of the City. Can be spoilt by heat haze depending on the time of day. Excellent dining and shopping.
,,Must have a head for heights,5.0,,"A visit here was part of an evening trip to several 'sights', and it was absolutely fabulous. If you like architecture, views, shops, and heights - this is made for you.
I thought it was amazing and could glimpse the rooftop pool through some barriers, and fully intend to get in there when I return to Singapore.
I didn't eat here, just looked around and bought a souvenir, but it was a great sight-see, and I would recommend this"
,,Spectacular!,4.0,,We took a tour from our cruise ship that took us to the laser light show at Marina Bay and then to the observation deck atop of the Marina Sands Hotel/Casino. The views at night were wonderful and showed the city at its very best.
,,For $23 you get a Great View!,5.0,,"Make the journey to Marina Bay stop and walk through this luxurious hotel to go up have a look. For $23, this is a good price to pay for a view. We went at night and it was superb."
,,Great view!,4.0,,"Atop the 56 storyed hotel is the observatory deck (Skypark) endorsing an amazing 270 degree view of Singapore. You also find beer and munchies atop at decent rates. If there is a F1 race on while you visit this place, DO NOT MISS the view of the track from the deck. The infinity pool is amazing to witness but is limited to residents of hotels only. All on all an amazing experience"
,,Beautiful view at night,5.0,,"This review is for the skypark itself, not the pool. I love the mix of people that the skylark draws at all times of day. This is an especially beautiful place at night. My favorite time up there was watching a storm roll in and the lightening in the far distance. The views are amazing."
,,Awesome view!,4.0,,Offers great views of the city skyline! Its a must visit for all the tourists. Try to go in the late afternoon so that you can witness sunset at the top! At evening it offers awesome views with great breeze flowing all around.
,,gorgeous,5.0,,"beautiful hotel, amazing swimming pool on the 57th floor, with a fabulous view over the city. There's a huge shopping arcade under the hotel, with amazing shops and restaurants too."
,,"good view, but expensive!",4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a 57 floor hotel building with a very interesting shape. the building has 3 towers that are connected from the top by a surf board looking structure - this structure forms the topmost level and is occupied by 3 bars, the best being ce la vie (that is in tower 3). on the 56 floor is the famous skypark (observation deck) that gives you a bird's eye view of the entire city. while the view is great (Especially at night) the entrance fee of SGD 23, i feel is a little too steep. intead, i preferred going to one of the bars on the 57th floor. same view, with no fee and you can also get some food and drinks. a word of caution - casual dressing is not permitted in these bars"
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"The entry fee for the Skypark is well worth the money.

You get an excellent view of the whole of Singapore and also out across the bay at all the ships waiting to come in to the port of Singapore.

If you go up in the late afternoon you can purchase a Singapore Sling from the roof bar and watch the light show take place in Gardens by the Bay which is great."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"I am not sure how many pictures I took of this hotel, but seeing it in person is a totally different story!"
,,AMAZING,5.0,,"So amazing in the skypark, the infiinty pool is surreal and the bars overlooking the city are breathtaking. Not great in high pollution, but still worth it. I would love to go back again"
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"Never was in my life time to be exposed to such a scenery in the skies, was like a breath taking moment."
,,Grest View from a fantastic building,5.0,,"Amazing views across the city, something you must do when visiting Singapore. Perhaps good to visit just before the sun sets to see the view in daylight and also the city lit up at night"
,,Best view of Singapore.,4.0,,Worth a visit. Spectacle view of Singapore and surrounds. The attraction only gives access to the viewing deck and not the pool and garden area as these are reserved for hotel guests.
,,Cheep and crazy,5.0,,If you want to see the future you should spend a full day here. I'm still shock and I didn't want to go back home. You can't be in Singapore and don't go there!!
,,Great to see the garden lights,5.0,,"We traveled out here in the late afternoon to se the lights in the evening. We decided to go up to the 'Sky Bar' 57 floors up ...for the view. The staff gave us a table for a drink and as it was my wife's B'day a candle celebration, good service and staff."
,,Walking in the sky,5.0,,Excellent experience. You can see Singapore from 56th floor. Good restaurant and bar. Food is praiseworthy but costly.
,,Thrilling,5.0,,The ride up is 20 SGD and worth it. especially at night You have great views in a 360 degrees angle. Wonderful foto opportunity.
,,A must see,5.0,,Visited this and paid the $23 Singapore dollars for this and $10 for the picture taken. It has amazing views across the port and the city and has to be done when in Singapore.
,,Expensive and only allowed on a small part of the Skypark,3.0,,"The desk staff selling the tickets was terrible, there was a massive queue of 30 people, 5 counters all manned, but only 2 selling tickets, the other 3 were either chatting of counting money, they did not care the queue was growing, very typical of Singapore customer service.

It was expensive and you are only permitted to be on the observation deck and not allowed into the garden or the pool, not even to view them.

The best time to visit is to go 1 hour before sunset (make sure you include enough time due to terrible sale office) and go and see the view during the day and watch the sunset and then the city and gardens in the dark when they light up (in my opinion the best view). There are no seats and signs everywhere not to sit on the deck, but i just sat on the floor and watch the sunset.

There is kiosk selling drinks and snacks as well as a bar, as expected both are expensive, but I bought along my own and had a little picnic whilst the city light up.

Definitely a must do, but don't expect great service.

To get here take the MTR and get of at Bayfront station and follow the signs for the gardens"
,,Up into heaven,5.0,,"From top you will have best view and is cheaper than sinflyer. Not only the overlook is great, take dinner or sundowner on 57floor"
,,"""Experience Top of World""",5.0,,"Skypark Bar is on Top of Marina Bay Hotel which gives specticular Singapore shining view after sunset. Gives kick to enjoy at liesure your Singapore Sling with famous Laska with family. Restaurant Bar located in unique Boat Shape Structure on tallest Marina Bay Hotel.
Exploring Singapore not complete without experience of Marina Bay Sands Skypark especially after Sunset."
,,Great views,5.0,,Visited during our stay . Took elevator from reception to Ce la Vie restaurant for drinks (rather than pay $23 fee to view from sky platform) fantastic views and friendly service. Very busy hotel but look good
,,Amazing Feat of Engineering!!,5.0,,Fascinating boat structure on top of three towers at the hotel!! Very Unique; Very Iconic to Singapore!!
,,Amazing View,5.0,,The view from here over Singapore is awesome. The photo is a big expensive (they wanted SGD$90 for a framed photo!!!!!) but the view is amazing. I would recommend anyone going to Singapore to put this on the agenda. (also the Casino is worth having a look at but remember you need your passport to get in). It was raining before we went up (it is not under cover) but the rain eventually cleared.
,,Great place,5.0,,Must try if you're in Singapore. Great rooms and views though service is just ok. Got to say hello to a Celebrity in CE La Vi.
,,Sky high drinks in Singapore with fabulous views at sunset,5.0,,"Fantastic views from both sides and a great place to have an early cocktail print to dinner as the sun drops below the horizon.
High speed lifts that make your ears pop!
And make sure you get the correct one as they don't all go to to the same floors."
,,Great place for a drink,5.0,,"A great place to catch a view of Singapore and the hundreds of ships in the port. A nice place to have a drink and watch the world go by,"
,,Nice pool,4.0,,"This hotel is very majestic looking. There are 3 towers with a boat-like structure sitting on top. That is the infinity pool. This is the highlight of the stay. The young children love it and can stay in there forever.
There are bars and choice of food outlets providing a good variety of food. Prices of food are reasonable.
The rooms in itself are not outstanding. It's comfortable and have all the usual amenities. The Atrium area is always very busy. Staff are generally well trained and made you feel special.
Top end prices but worth a visit and have a dip in the 'infinity pool'"
,,Go to the bar not the viewing deck,5.0,,"We had a great tip to head on up to Celavi Bar and order the mandatory single drink (SGD 23 or so and nice comfy chairs, great views) rather than pay SGD 23 for the viewing deck (with no seats, no drink and the same views). Definitely worth it if you do it this way :)"
,,"""I've Been Here"" T-Shirt type touristy",2.0,,"You can go up to the observation deck only if you're not staying in the hotel, rather than the infinity pool area. So what you get for your $25 is an empty (busy) decking overlooking the city with a souvenir shop. If you have kids that's fine, but as adults the bar Ce La Vie, or 1-Altitude have a much better atmosphere and just as good a view and sit down with a drink to enjoy it."
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"I only say that because I was obviously expecting more. I thought after you paid your $23.00 to go to the top you would be able to admire the spectacular views and perhaps sit and have a drink and soak in the skyline of Singapore - not to be - the bar/restaurant is for hotel guests only. The famous Infinity Pool can be glimpsed from the side which doesn't compare with the fantastic photos advertising it. Pretty much once you arrive on the 56th floor there is nothing to do up there but admire the Gardens below and the city skyline. The entry fee seems excessive but it would be a shame to go to Singapore and not splurge - just to be able to say 'been there, done that'."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,The place has a great view of Singapore city and also out to the Ocean. If it's raining or too hot then be aware that there is no cover against both. There isn't much to do there once you've looked at the view however there is a separate bar and restaurant near the viewing platform.
,,Great views,5.0,,As entrance is free it is close to a must when visiting Singapore. Fantastic views that can be accompanied with a drink or two. Probably worth while during day or evening.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"As an in-house guest, I had the privilege to enjoy free unlimited access to the sky park and for the amazing iconic swimming pool at the top. Even for the sky park visit is bit expensive but worth the money you pay. Highly recommended."
,,Best View,4.0,,"The view from the skydeck was spectacular. The view of Gardens was worth the visit, seeing super tree grove from above is the best view."
,,YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING !!!,5.0,,"Its a little expensive however you can see the whole skyline and city. From the skypark you get a birds eye view of almost the whole Central Business District ( CBD )

Highly money worth. There is also a pool and some snack bars however I think its only for the hotel guests."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Very impressive architecture and view. 56 floors up to the sky park where you can see to the boundaries of Singapore city and beyond. Well worth the visit just hope you've got a head for heights.
,,What an amazing view!,5.0,,"We went to the Skypark just to have a drink and a look. We weren't disappointed. View is spectacular, the express elevator to the 57 floor is fast and smooth. Drinks are a little expensive. Would go again"
,,Marine Bay Sands Skypark,3.0,,"Although the view is quite good from the top of this hotel, it certainly not worth the £30 for the privilege. To add insult to injury, you can see the hotel guests on the next floor drinking beer but there is no facility for you to get one. The hotel situated at 1 Raffles Road gives a better view and is free although it is pricey if you want to eat and drink."
,,Must visit,5.0,,I guess this is something rather last on the itinerary of people ... But I would rather suggest it to be one of the must visit destinations. Must experience the top of the building view and probably even have a drink in the terrace bar. Usually the bar and pool is reserved for those staying at Marina bay.
,,Nice views but not unique experience,3.0,,"Views are spectacular especially at night but you can see the city in many different ways. The ticket price may put off a family. Certainly, you can see Singapore skyline in all its glory and if you have time its good to see but if you don't have time or money, you wont miss anything."
,,nice view,4.0,,i bring my family to go to the up in the sky the view is awesome. but so pity we cant go to swimming
,,"interesting feeling walking out on the roof ""boat"" overhang",4.0,,"it costs $25 to go up to the roof and have a walk around, great views, for that you will not be able to go into the swimming pool area though. There is a bar and a cafe and expensive restaurant."
,,Great views,4.0,,Amazing building and spectacular views but too many people very touristy and expensive but would recommend that every one at least visit there once
,,Amazing View.....needs more!,4.0,,"Great to do and a must really to see the views of Singapore but.....it needs somewhere up there to sit and have a drink, there is a bar but for hotel guests only!!!!"
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,A must visit spot any time of the day but to feel its beauty try to visit before sunset and enjoy the view. Have a drink or two with friends or loved ones I guarantee you'll never forget this experience.
,,Go to the bar and ascend for free,3.0,,"Think about spending your entrance money on refreshments instead; if you go up in the 'bar' lift, by the main doors, you won't pay entrance ot the skydeck and will have good views although not exactly the same access as those paying. You can see the pool etc though"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Fortunately we were staying at marina bay sands and the skylark was included in our stay. It's just beautiful, if you get the opportunity just do it!"
,,Extraordinary views from here,5.0,,"Whilst staying at the marina bay sands we visited the sky park which has fantastic views across the bay, had a swim up the top as well which was amazing & not overly busy which was good, got to be done when in Singapore"
,,Best panoramic views from Singapore.,5.0,,Soar 57 levels above the heart of the city as you capture the moment of a lifetime at the stunning Sands Skypark public observation deck.
,,amazing architectural,5.0,,"like what other travelers say it is a treat for the eyes. such a wonder place to see the beauty of Singapore, a small country with such an amazing architectural gather from the expert all around the world."
,,Bit pricey,2.0,,$17 per adult to go up and have a look No pool access and still have to pay for food and drinks Ripoff big time We found a nice little spot on 57th floor that was free
,,Wonderful!!,4.0,,First time went up and it is breath-taking! Has restaurants and pubs but nothing beats the night-view!
,,Meet the clouds you can just about touch them,5.0,,The view when you get to the top of this majestic building is just breath taking. Worth the entry price. There is a restaurant and bar at the top so if you want to dine and see the sights its amazing. One of my favourite places to view the city
,,First Stop,5.0,,"A must see. We made this our first stop after the hotel and achieved heaps - gave us a great view of Singapore, the Bay and the Gardens, also helped in orientation as we could clearly see path/bike/bridge paths for walking."
,,Absolutely Spectacular!,5.0,,"On the one night we were in Singapore - a Saturday night - We went up the third tower to the bar - no charge. They were doing renovations and said we could access the outside restaurant patio area instead. A quick ride up to the top and wow - what a beautiful view of the city! We walked around and saw a gorgeous view of the harbour, boats and the night lights. The weather was amazingly warm and even though we had just got back to Singapore from Siem reap, we promised ourselves that no matter what the time was, we'd go to marina bay sands. We each had a couple of drinks and just took it all in. Excellent decision on our part, well worth it and will go back again next time, and spend much more time since we didn't get to really look at all the shops etc."
,,Totally worth it!,4.0,,"It gives a great 360 view of Singapore. You can see the pool from the side but you cannot access it, it is reserve to guests."
,,Wow - incredible views,5.0,,"Held a business event with drinks and dinner. Unbelievable views of Singapore skyline, the bay, and surrounding areas. Food was excellent, great service, and wonderful venue. Highly recommend."
,,Marina bay,5.0,,Just had to go to the top of this..It took a bit of finding as to where to go to get up there..The hotel is massive but if your looking from the front from the sea the entrance is on the right hand side on the outside of the hotel and down a flight of steps.i asked inside the hotel which is very busy..but got directed straight to out from a helpful receptionist. .I paid around $28 dollars to go up to the viewing area which that is all you get to go..The pool and restaurant are off limits to public.the views are fantastic and I thought was worth the money just for that.
,,awful and awesome skypark,5.0,,"looks like a ship in the sky to get up there takes 1/2 hour and the view is great of Singapore from the top the swimming pool is not really for swimming rather just water in the sky, I went there once in May 2015 but not another time again I fear the whole structure is falling down on the next earthquake in Singapore, and just don't tell me there was never one"
,,amazing,5.0,,"Just as what I stated in Marina Bay, I was referring to Marina Bay Sands Skypark with a lovely view deck."
,,The best place to view the majestic skyline!,5.0,,"Its very difficult not be mesmerized by The Marina Bay Sands! Its just a treat for the eyes! More treat for the eyes awaits when you visit the skypark. The gorgeous Singapore skyline takes your breath away the first time you see it! The view of Gardens by the Bay, the National stadium and the CBD is a perfect representation of what Singapore really is! A must do activity when in Singapore, specially if its your first time!"
,,"Amazing view, amazing experience !!!!",5.0,,"Best afternoon had in Sinapore, not the cheapest place to eat and drink but the most amazing experience. Definitely worth a visit!!!"
,,short staycation,5.0,,"Being a high-end hotel, theres little to complaint about. the trip was great, ambience was great, the infinity pool was great. Hardly, anything to complaint. See it, enjoy it, brace it for yourself."
,,A True WORK of ART,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a ‘Work of Art’ and a truly ‘Amazing Design’ which is another true icon in the Singapore waterfront. Even if your not staying at the Hotel it is well worth a visit to explore the Shopping Centre and a Visit to the Skypark is a Must. You do need to pay to visit the Rooftop but the Views are outstanding and well worth it. You may enjoy an evening Drink and then you can capture a Daytime View, Sunset and Night View of Singapore whilst enjoying a Drink at the Bar."
,,Very good view of Singapore,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a must visit tourist attraction. The view you get of Singapore is fantastic. Would recommend going in late evening so that you get amazing view of night time Sg.
,,What an amazing building !,5.0,,"This building hogs the limelight in Singapore, and I just had to go to the top and admire the view. There was no disappointment, having paid my 20 Singapore dollars, (Senior Citizen rate), I admired the view of the Grand Prix Circuit, the Singapore Flyer, and the hotel guests using the swimming pool on top of the centre pillar. An amazing building that you have to visit."
,,Heavenly,5.0,,Had the complete view of the gardens around. Had lunch at a cool ambience. Too good. A lifetime experience!!
,,This place is amazing!!!,5.0,,"If you love to shop, maybe try your luck at the casino or even grab a spot of lunch. This place will have you spoilt for choice and has so many nice suprise!!"
,,Much better if...,4.0,,"This is not my first time to visit a high rise building. If I will compare it to Petronas Tower, I would choose Petronas because it will make you feel you are on the edge and glass all over. Skypark though is an open space on the 56th floor. What I do not like about this place was they insist that you will buy the picture taken from you from the lobby. The entrance fee is around 20 singaporean dollars because I was able to fly with Singaporean airlines. For picture alone, you pay 25 dollars and for picture with frame, 50 dollars. What an expensive picture! I would appreciate more if there were less restaurants so that the people could see more of the infinity pool which I think is the highlight. Overall, it is still a good place to visit but the management must provide a sort of telescope to take view of things closer. Another way of generating income..."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,Whether you're viewing it from afar or viewing the City and surrounds from its top you are still getting breathtaking views. . A must see !!
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"A bit pricy but well worth the trip up to the 56th floor to see it. Souvenir stall at the top, but nowhere to sit and have a beer unless you are a hotel resident, shame."
,,Bar at the top,5.0,,"A must when visiting Singapore. Book in advance. Not cheap, but worthwhile for the view and the atmosphere. Night time is exceptional."
,,Awesome View,4.0,,"I trans ended the Maria Bay Sands and traveled to the top floor
for the view. It was costly but awesome view of the city. Massive hotel with infinity pool for guests. I was not impressed by the casino. Too much security and too much smoke."
,,Fantabulous,5.0,,Please Check the photos i have posted ..they say it all.. 360 degree view of SIngapore from 56th Top Most Floor Of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.. a MUST MUST VISIT for all who love Aerial Views ... breathtaking
,,Absolutely Stunning....!,5.0,,"Singapore keeps on impressing...

A great way to see this awesome building is to book yourself a room for a night or two but if your like me and have a limited budget you can just visit the Skypark and take in the stunning views from the top deck. There is a fantastic view to be had out over the city in every direction and even if you are a bit scared of heights the solid glass barrier should instill enough confidence to get up close to the edge :)..

Just visiting the skypark alone still gives you the opportunity to also spend some time exploring the Hotel complex and the many shops and eateries (including food hall where you will find the locals)."
,,"Birds eye view, but that's it!",3.0,,"You reach on top (after buying a bit so cheap ticket), with a lot of expectations (that is you haven't read about it here on TripAdvisor ;)). It's merely a deck to have a birds eye view of the city and harbour.
Do not visit it when it's sunny as there are no shades to sit back and relax, visit only early morning or late evenings, which has its own drawback of being crowded. The bar up there is small but suffice.
Visitors are allowed to enter the infinity pool ""area"" (not the pool)for a short period of time.
To sum it up, it's worth a visit, after all it's an icon of SGP. You can then say, been there, done that. ;)"
,,Excellent hotel... worth every cent,5.0,,"The hotel is a bit pricey compared to its counterparts but I can tell you that it is really worth every penny. Days before our stay, they sent me a reminder. The day before, they sent me a message asking me for my preferred bed to make checking in faster. Upon check-in, their staff were all very cordial and friendly especially Ms Cheryl. They were able to accommodate my requests and they were very effiecient. The housekeeping guys were also commendable, they showed respect and expertise in what they do. Our room was simple but very well-maintained. The size and lay-out were perfect. The infinity pool was clean and of course the view up there was fantastic. My niece cannot get enough of the pool.
The location of the hotel is very strategic, accessible to all sorts of transportation like train, bus and cabs. Food places are just within few steps and shopping of course. Other scenic spots are also around, like the Singapore flyer, Gardens by the Bay, the Merlion Park, etc. Over-all an excellent and unforgettable experience, we will surely be back."
,,Morning view,3.0,,Nothing spectacular if you've been to the empire state building. Although the hotel is much better because of the high ceiling and max a/c including convenience of mrt and high end shops to see.
,,Perspective of Singapore,4.0,,"Like any aerie, views give an entirely different perspective and scale of land and buildings. We find climbing high always worth the effort."
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"We visited this viewing platform expecting great things. We expected to be able to sit and have a drink at the top but there is a very small bar selling soft drinks. No seats and no shade. We were up and down within 20 mins.The staff taking our money and the photographers were very unpleasant. The Photographer told us it was compulsory to have our photo taken and barred our way to the lift. The girls selling the photos actually shouted at me when I refused to buy the photo. The whole thing felt like it was just a money maker for the hotel and they want you in and out as quickly as possible. Without any shade it is too hot to spend any time up there, which is probably why they don't provide shade. You cannot see the Skypark proper with the infinity pool etc from the viewing platform. This is for guests of the hotel only. Not a pleasant experience at all."
,,NDP 2015,5.0,,"Nice day and night view. Can view spectacular fireworks during Festival period - NDP, Chinese New Year, etc. Please take note that it will be very hot if you visit during noon time as there are no shelter."
,,sky view,4.0,,Expensive. but have amazing views of the city. Difficult to find how to get up there via the only elevator that is allowed by visitors. It is different for those who can afford to stay at the hotel. The little restaurant at the top does not accommodate the tourist very well seem to cater to those that stay at the hotel so that was disappointing we could not get a seat for lunch.
,,Must see!,5.0,,"Beautiful hotel
Views are wonderful- skip the charged terrace and go to rooftop bar, have a Singapore Sling and enjoy the same view
The weather was becoming stormy and I was able to get a great picture
Highly recommend
If you want to see the casino, bring your passport otherwise no can do ;)"
,,"A great view from top, could be the next big thing after the merlion",5.0,,The skydeck for 23 SGD was a great time though the restaurants up top were only for MBS guests at hotel. Get here for the great views around MB and the sea port.
,,Go to the top at night.,4.0,,"A very speedy lift takes you to the top of this hotel. But it only gets you to the observation deck. The infinity pool is only for hotel guests. The view is great at night, where you can watch the sunset and both the light shows, one at the Super Tree Grove and over the other side the laser show on the lake at the boulevard. Make time to get back down, it took us about 40 minutes of queuing to get into lift."
,,You cant come to Singapore and not visit this icon!!!,5.0,,"If you are Singapore, visiting this icon has to form an essential part of your trip. The building is easily accessible via public transport as it has its own MRT stop (promenade) with a short walk to the skypark itself. From the ground up you can get a sense of scale and wonder at how 3 identical tall buildings can have a park placed on top of it connecting them.

There's a shopping area at the foot of the building, but the majority of it is a hotel. Whilst you cannot get complete access to the park on the top (this is only for hotel users, so forget any notion of taking a dip in the infinity pool) you still get use of an observation deck. the view from this is pretty impressive, and on hot days (as most are in Singapore) the decking and glass can get very warm, so you might not wish to sit down on it. Its an open air observation deck so may not be ideal when its wet or raining....

There's sadly no chairs to sit down to soak up the view, with a limited drinks store at the top. The observation deck itself is partly closed off only a third of it is usable for non hotel guests you can still see what your missing out and view the park and pool from the deck. One thing to be weary of is that novelty pictures from the top (the ones which they take of you to buy so if you wish) is very expensive, its about £15-35 depending on what type your after....

Overall its a fast, efficient service and you get to spend as long as you want at the top, so you have no reason to not go as its open for most of the day as well. You can see quite clearly the flyer opposite and the park next to the building. You can easily do this and the flyer both within 2 hours without feeling rushed at all."
,,fantastic view,5.0,,"don't be fooled when you get up there all you have access to is the viewing platform, the rest of the roof is for hotel guests only! It does have stunning views of the bay and beyond but it would have been nice to see the garden up there or had a drink at the bar."
,,Best place in Singapore,5.0,,"We went for afternoon tea. Well worth it, views and food .... Amazing! Just go and experience the sights and the food! Yum!"
,,Lives up to high expectations,5.0,,"The view is of cause breath taking, not to mention the infinity pool at 57th floor. You can spend a whole day at the top enjoying dining and the views. Good possibilities to move around especially if you stays at the hotel, which is required to use the infinity pool. Super hot attraction!"
,,A good view of the city,4.0,,"Skypark is the recreational deck of the marina bay sands. With an entry ticket of just 23$ you get to got to the top of the building to the deck of the boat-like-structure.

A great view of the flyer, the garden by the bay and the rest of the downtown. You can stay here till 11.00PM as mentioned in the ticket, however you are not allowed inside the hotel or the restaurants with this ticket.

Worth a visit, a night view will be a better choice."
,,huge,5.0,,"This place is enormous. A river at the bottom floor where there are gondolas taking people for boat rides. The casino is on the bottom floor as well. Many , many shops of all varieties. There is a ice skating rink there as well although it wasn't opened when we were there. Didn't get to the top floor. Plenty of food shops if you are hungry"
,,One off the bucket list,4.0,,"Well worth the visit to get a panoramic view of Singapore, the down side is picking a low haze day and the cost, if you could afford it eat in the restaurant and the entry is free"
,,Worth to see,5.0,,I am glad waited almost 1 hour to go on top . It was great view and nice to see the infinity pool from side as well. Should but ticket before otherwise spending more time in buying the ticket
,,Disppointing,4.0,,"We were going to push the boat out and stay at this hotel but so glad we didn't, the lobby was full,of people milling around not a private lobby for when guest are checking in and out not something I would have liked. Although the views from the viewing platform over Singapore were amazing, again if I had been a resident of the hotel I wouldn't have liked the fact that you had to pass sightseers to get to the pool, slightly disappointing although impressive to look at, once again a must to vist"
,,Amazing design,5.0,,I took heaps of photos from a boat cruise and while walking around the nearby Gardens by the Bay. Bloody amazing. The architect was definitely on drugs when he designed it.
,,Just not a fan,2.0,,"This is a big sprawling complex that lacks any personal touch at all and despite all of the glitz and glamour it just wasn't for me. Expensive drinks, huge queues to both check in and out, long lines waiting for breakfast service.
The view from the skydeck is impressive but I don't know that it's worth the money."
,,5 Day visit,3.0,,I would only like to stay in this hotel one night it is very busy and noisy. We paid to go up to the gardens but we're only allowed to one small part as we were not resident. You can only get to see the rest of the garden if you are resident.
,,Good view from top,5.0,,"We went here during the day but I was not allowed to go to the top because I was wearing shorts.
People on here have said that it is expensive to eat and drink here and I don't doubt that.
We just blagged it and went up in the lift, we chatted to one of the staff members and just took in the the view and took pics.
You don't have to spend money to go to these places, just give a bit of chat and smile and that will take you a long way :-)"
,,Visit here only at night,5.0,,You feel you are on top of the world when you come out of the 56th floor. Lift take you to this 56th floor in just few seconds. Its amazing to see Singapore at night.
,,Anything Marina Sands Bay!,5.0,,"Whatever is going on in MSB, do it. Visit, Live it, Use it. Share it. We go, I go, they go, everyone goes. For every year it gets better and better. So if you went some years ago, try it again. Can recommend the Bread Street Kitchen/Gordon Ramsay. book window table, but start off with a drink in the outside bar. What a view, what a place!"
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"It was amazing overlooking in the top deck of the building,you viewing includes the port,ships that anchoring, building up...ets."
,,"Did not find this building, but only in Singapore",4.0,,- nice area to walk . - nice restaurants and cafes on G floor . - nice sky area . - nice area to have pictures . - close to marina mall .
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,The views from the top were absolutely brilliant. Having visited the Gardens By the Bay and looking down on what we had visited earlier in the week gave some great perspective to what we had seen. It tends to be a bit hazy so a day when there is a slight wind blowing would be best for viewing. An experience not to be missed.
,,thrilling experience for a high-sick person,4.0,,"amazing place (for those who do not crawl back to the elevator once reaching the observation deck as i did) with stunning panorama, glass walls from the very floor make the experience even more thrilling."
,,"Sprawling Casino, Fantastic Infinity Pool",5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is the best hotel in all of Singapore and it has the BEST view from the Sky Deck. The Casino (in the basement) is HUGE and doesn't seem to end. From roulette to slot machines to live poker, every game is available and you'll almost always find an empty seat (it's that huge). Had a great time at the Marina Bay Sands."
,,Excellent views!,5.0,,"Whilst we didn't pay to go up to the skypark $23, we had full buffet breakfast at spargo which is at the top of the second tower at $44. Great deal!! Plus the views. You can also go up to the top of tower 1 for free as there is a small viewing area for a happy snap."
,,If you visit Singapore you should have visited here,5.0,,"Unofficially, this building is recognized as a symbol/pride/monument of Singapore. You get a view from 57th floor where you can see most of the Singapore from the top. Also we made visit during night time which was amazing."
,,Stunning Views!,5.0,,Great views! Must experience. Walkways to the view deck overlooking the Gardens are also available within the area.
,,Amazing view over Singapore,4.0,,"You can visit the skydeck of the iconic Hotel with a fee. It is quit expensive, but worth to go to the top. You will have a panoramic view over the city.You don't have acces the the infinity pool. But apparantly, if you go to the restaurant, you ""can"" go to the pool. But you cannot swim, just see."
,,Great view of the City,4.0,,"Got to visit this when in Singapore bar and food on the top very good and not too expensive, great view of Singapore if not too hazy, the hotel is a fantastic design and well worth a walk around as well"
,,Wonderful views,5.0,,"An absolute must, evening especially, most spectacular views of Singapore. Have a drink at the top and chill"
,,Cool!,5.0,,"You get a good view from up here and you are pretty much free to stay as long you want. There is a bar and a souvenir shop, although you can't access the pool."
,,Good sky view of Singapore,3.0,,"Nice, but if you do not go nothing happens. However you can see the famous pool from here. It is better to see the Marina Sands from the other side."
,,A masterwork with unique Las Vegas Sands's property layout!,5.0,,"Soaring 57 levels above the ground. How wonderful to be able to enjoy luxurious panoramic view of Singapore skyline and infinity pool! I admire Las Vegas Sands's property layout! I am still wondering, is it a ship with dramatic curves on top? How about to swap it for Eiffel tower? Would it suitable? Or move Marina Bay Sands Skypark to Paris? ;)"
,,top of the world,4.0,,"if you have a chance to have a friend that stays at the hotel, you can get to the private decks and it is truely beautiful. if you get there on time for the laser show, it's a very nice place to see them from"
,,"Great views, questionable value",3.0,,"The view of Singapore is unrivalled and is spectacular. However, be warned that there is nothing to do up there - as a mere visitor you are not allowed to go to the bar at the top (hotel guests only) and the only refreshment option is a stall selling a few snacks and tacky souvenirs. You also get harassed on entry into having your photo taken, then harassed again at the top into buying the photo. It's worth visiting but only if you appreciate a good aerial view. Entry fee of 22 dollars seems excessive."
,,Vegas in Singapore,3.0,,"Before I became aware that this property was owned by the Sands Casino business in America, I found it to be vaguely familiar. Once I put two and two together, I said aha! As a frequent traveler to Las Vegas, I didn't find this place to be anything special; however, my son, who has never been to Las Vegas, thought this was an amazing place to visit. He loved it. Me? Meh..."
,,Picturesque Views,4.0,,"The MBS is a highlight in Singapore for a 360 view of the city. There is admission but worth going up for the view. Easy access via the MTS subway. There are two sides to the island rooftop, One side is reserved for hotel guest the other side is for visitors. Order a refreshing drink and soak in the sights."
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,"Located on the 57th floor, the views of Singapore are fantastic, uncrowded when we were there and you could stay up there as long as you wanted. really enjoyable experience"
,,Memorable,5.0,,One should visit personally to see and enjoy. No words to describe the great experience. Imagine yourself in a dream world and getting what you dreamt.
,,High quality food with an excellent view,5.0,,"A memorable evening with a phenominal view of one of the Singapore skyline. Food was excellent, priece fitting for the quality and location."
,,Unique building,4.0,,Its unique building in the all the world at the top of this build there is park and golf and many activates.
,,Best View of Singapore,4.0,,Best $20 you will spend. The view is spectacular and is a great way to get a quick overall perspective of this city. But it's bloody hot up there
,,A piece of Art,5.0,,"Oh what can I say... Such a beautiful architecture and wonderful place to hangout. A bit upmarket but worth a visit. Hawker food is pricy. The view from the top is great and during the evening the lighting is excellent. Best also view from the otherwise of the bank. A must visit when in Singapore and a short walk to the garden by the bay..
Thumb up.."
,,Stuuning Views,5.0,,Stunning views of the city from the Skypark . Make sure you see the lazer shows from a boat boarded at Clarke Key .
,,The view from the top is breathtaking!,4.0,,"This hotel looks like an ocean liner was stranded on top of three pillars. Who thought of this? It's crazy and it's something to be experienced. We had lunch at the top, overlooking Singapore harbor, and it was a feast for the eyes. Our simple lunch for three, with two beers each cost well over $150, but how can you repeat something like this. The lobby is always busy and people watching is great in this place."
,,Amazing,5.0,,It is the one of the hotel in Singapore for recommending. Nice decorations.. It was feeling so good to enjoy the swimming at the rooftop. Service is perfect.
,,Quick Family Holiday,5.0,,Costly for a family be warned! But the views are incredible. Bring you own water too it gets terribly hot and to purchase anything up top has tropical tax added!!
,,Night Visit,4.0,,When visited at night & it was spectacular! The view is wonderful & all the lights of Singapore looked lovely. Beautiful building inside & out. Loved it all but we only had a short time to see everything but we enjoyed our tour. Would have loved to see it again in daylight. Put it on the list of must do things in Singapore!
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Take the elevator from Tower 1 and head to the top. The views at night are amazing with great photo opportunities.
,,Spectacular view,4.0,,I had gone to the SkyPark as an alternative to the Flyer and it didn't disappointing me at all. The views of all around the places were very good including the flyer it self. There was a good view of the Gardens by the bay as well. Best time to come there is during the sunset.
,,Fountain show,5.0,,"The best place to see business district in Singapore at noon. At this place, you can watch the fountain show. With many light effect made this show very beautiful. Pick your seat, enjoy the show, and you will be feel amazed."
,,Excellent,4.0,,"Great Location, Walking distance to Singapore Flyer Great room with stunning views. Food Court is walking distance. The pool is simply awesome!"
,,"Do it, but don't pay for it!",4.0,,"With just a few hours to kill Singapore this was on the hit-list. Thanks to another reviewer I was aware of how to get the same view without the $20 price tag. Exactly as directed, go to the 3rd tower and take that lift as far as it goes then change to the next lift that goes to the Spago Restaurant. On this level there is the hotel guest only area with the pool which is quite crowded but the bulk of the floor is taken up by the restaurant/bar. It is all open to the breezes on the sides which is a welcome relief with plenty of spread out tables and seating. A cold beer for $15, a relax in a comfortable setting, spectacular view and still $5 ahead of the $20 lift ride that only goes 1 floor higher, might even make that 2 beers!"
,,Impressive view,5.0,,"When you are in Singapore, visit Marina Bay Sands is a must!
But, instead of buying ticket to the to the SkyPark, we decided to buy a cocktail in the bar one floor down for pretty the same price! Stunning view with a nice drink...What more could one ask for?

By the way, the swimming pool at the top is much more narrow than we expected!!!"
,,Spectacular Pool at the comfort of your hotel,5.0,,The Skypark located at the 57th floor of the hotel. It provides a pool with elegant design and spectacular view overlooking the city of Singapore.
,,Spectacular view,4.0,,Had drinks at the 57th floor and all I can say is that the view is spectacular. Great for unwinding after a long day of site seeing and shopping
,,A must do,5.0,,"Best of Singapore views, go to tower 3 at the very end to a person standing at a small desk. Ask to go to the lounge for a drink ( after 12 noon) and they'll let you go up to the 57 th floor ( Sky park)without buying a ticket($ 20+ each normally). Drinks are about $24+ each, but why not have a drink and the view? The restaurant has several great lunch deals going on right now. The lobby is fun just for people watching, and go down the escalators to visit shops. It's an amazing building. From here you can walk to Gardens by the Bay..."
,,Probably a bit overrated . . . .,3.0,,"It is a hugely impressive building and we can see it clearly from where we are staying (Ritz Carlton Millenia). We walked over to see what it was like inside and on top. We slightly misjudged the humidity and after only a short walk arrived there like we came out of a sauna.

We found it very hard to find the entrance to the hotel. It has three but some, that appear to be entrances are actually not and are on other floors. We were particularly looking for the observation deck and bar and, of course, went to the wrong end of the first. It is a very big building so not great to go the wrong way in this humidity.

We found the dedicated lift for the skypark is at entrance 3 of the hotel. The lift is great. It only has three floors, 1, 56 and 57. It gets to the 57th floor in seconds.

Once you get to the skypark there is really very little (as a non-hotel guest) going on. There is a view. A truly great view. A bar that serves pleasant snacks and a good range of drinks and thats about it. There is a substantial pool too but that is not open to day visitors,

We had a drinlk, ate some edemame, squid, oysters and salad (all of which were very nice) and left for our walk back to the Ritz Carlton.

It was pleasant but nothing really more than that. Maybe its better in the evening? The view is great and maybe even better at night."
,,Strange but nice,4.0,,A very strange sight the Sands. 3 towers with a boat on top of it. What in the boat I don't know? But sight good
,,The unique ship-shape of the building,5.0,,The building looks grand and expensive. Even the shops inside are pricey. I use to window-shop whenever I was free to visit this place.
,,An icon of Singapore,5.0,,"When you think of Singapore, this place is one of the few that comes to your mind. You should at least try the restaurants once .... trust me, it's worth it."
,,Amazing Night View,4.0,,"If you want to enjoy Marina Bay Sand Skyview, they would charge you for some S$.
Dunno the exactly amount due to we'd buy voucher from Groupon for some discount.
I suggest to buy combine coupon/voucher with Garden by the bay if you want to press the budget.

I love the amazing night view from the deck but unfortunatelly they have no chair or table there.. if want to enjoy the view and dine in with your beloved one, should go to their restaurant but dont forget to prepare the high cost."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Well worth the trip to the roof of Marina Bay Sands. The perspective of Singapore is amazing from here and the view of the South China Sea just tops it off.
,,Excellent observation deck,5.0,,"Brilliant views of the Singapore skyline, best of all, it is free of charge to view, some areas require the hotel room card to access but there is a small section for the public!"
,,What a view,5.0,,"Having seen this on many information/ books it is a short bus or taxi journey to reach it then it's sometimes a bit of a queue to take the lift to the top but when you get to the top What a view this is something you should not miss as you can see for miles on a clear day we went up at night and to see all the Ships out to sea was just amazing.
They have a bar at the top and a small gift shop toilets but what a wonderful view from the top DO IT YOU WONT regret it"
,,Go to the restaurant,5.0,,Thanks to Tripadvisor reviewers. We listen to them and go to the roof top resturant and have expensive drinks. But it's worth it!
,,Very Costly and yet nothing much to see,3.0,,View was ok same like flyer but pollution was rather thick due to haze from neighbouring countries. Area to walk around was not spacious enough and we covered everything in less than 10 min.
,,Its a must,5.0,,This landmark in Singapore. Swimming on the top is life time experience. Dont forget to drink the cocktail from the bar out there
,,Amazing Architecture !,5.0,,"Never seen anything like this before. Superb ! If you have one thing to see in Singapore, this will be it. Visit at night because there is a light show."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"The view from the top of this amazing building is fantastic. You can see 100's of ships out in the harbour waiting to come into the container port, you also get a birds eye view over the Gardens by the Bay and on the other side you can clearly see the Merlion. It's a tad expensive but worth it for the view and when it's sunny there is no shade so be prepared with hats and sunscreen. You can get some great photos and it is very strange standing on the deck of a ship that's on top of a hotel!"
,,Awesome,4.0,,A must visit place when in singapore...there a corridor in the middle of the hotel that connects from mall to gardens by the bay terrace view....it amazing to see marina bay at night...
,,You must go to this place,5.0,,The pool is amazing and you must go there but the rest of the hotel is very busy with lots and lots of tourists. They are from other hotels but they take tours of the hotel and walk around.
,,Special 50th Birthday Treat,5.0,,Amazing view from tower 3 free entry drinks were very expensive once in a life time experience well worth doing though. My husband 50th Birthday treat. We will defiantly be back to spend one night as a stop over as a special treat. Must do if you get the chance very special.
,,Can be free if you want,5.0,,"Very pretty view of the marina. Take the elevator up to the top and enjoy an expensive drink, or simply stroll around for a few minutes and head back down with your money still in your pocket."
,,bold and daring architectural concept proven a big hit,4.0,,"This park at the top of the three blocks of hotel is just as amazing looking from Fullerton across the river. Compliments to the people who dared to dream and make it a reality.
The hotel is usually fully occupied with the casino package tourist, guest of the hotel can go all the way up to the edge-less pool in the sky and walk around the Skypark, don't do it as your buckets list, do it now!
If you are not a guest of the hotel, pay S$20+ each to go up BUT you won't need your swimmers, you can only peek at the pool."
,,Stunning views.,5.0,,"This hotel is a few hundred metres walk from the Gardens by the bay. The Sky Park is on the 56th floor, and has a viewing point which gives you a view of the whole city, and across the sea and the Bay Gardens. You look across the boat shaped top and you can see the hotel guests in the 56th floor swimming pools."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"69sgd for 3 people is a bit pricey for just a view, albeit a lovely one! Only hotel guests can use the pool. However, we thought you paid at the top (apparently you should pay before you enter the lift) so took the hotel lift and ended up seeing the view free of charge. Think it may have worked as a hotel guest had scanned their card in the lift as we got in so we could press the 57 button and reach the 57 floor- we couldn't access the viewing platform but could see the view just as well from the bar which is above the viewing platform A taxi driver told us that there are many taller buildings in the area that you can go to the top of for free(?)"
,,"No shade at all, do not go during the daytime",1.0,,"There is no shade or seats at all for this observation deck, it is literally a platform for taking pictures and if you go during the day I would imagine that the heat would be unbearable after a few mins. Not allowed to go to the hotel restaurant for food or drinks, why would you even pay to be made to feel like a second class citizen. Personally would never consider staying at this hotel now if this is how they treat their guests, very disappointed"
,,The POOLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,The world best infinity pool on 57th floor is a spectacular piece of Architecture. I was fortunate to be guest of the hotel and had priviledge to visit the pool unlimited times. I visit two times and both experience were amazing. People from the age 2 to 80 were enjoying the experience. You can also enjoy your preffered drinks and Live snacks at the pool. Bath towels and bath robes are provided free of cost to all guests.
,,Better than the Shard,5.0,,"A fantastic experience. We went at night and whereas this is not as high as the Shard in London, the views of this city are terrific. Easy to get into - pay, onto the lift and up to go. Very helpful staff. The photos taken of each visitor are expensive at $55 with a frame, but without is $35 and a great memento. To eat in the restaurant and view from slightly higher up it us necessary to pre-book. We made do with a hot dog and a coke!!"
,,Just elegance !!!,5.0,,"Visited this part of Singapore..in evening
Just loved it so much ... Went to the
Sky park on the top .. It's is ship design on the 3 towers ... The views u see is just
Beautiful .. Of city ... There is bar / restaurants/ & infinity pool of u r guest
Of that hotel ... The scene & experience has to be tasted if u r in Singapore ..
Luxury!!! Wud highly recommended to visit
If in Singapore!!"
,,Definitely visit!,4.0,,Great place to be with an awesome view on Singapore! You can easily take one of the guest only elevators to get up and down so you won't have to wait long.
,,Great view at a price,3.0,,The view from the Skypark is exhilarating. However you will need to empty your pockets to get up there. Prepare for the shock!
,,A must do experience!,4.0,,This is such an iconic landmark in Singapore that you really must go up the top and see the view. Night time is spectacular with the lights of the city. Day time can be a little foggy but still pretty amazing
,,Only the best!,5.0,,"This property is not only unique but beautiful. The iconic building with the ""ship-like"" structure on the roof sets it apart from any other hotel/casino property. The rooms are generous with space and amenities. The staff is excellent. The food at the two restaurants was superb. Plenty to do and see on lay property. A must-see for any visitor to Singapore!"
,,Incredible views while swimming!,5.0,,"We stayed at the fabulous Marina Bay Sands in part just to experience the Sky Park and it was well worth it! A few eating venues included, but the main attraction is the rooftop swimming pool with arguably the most amazing view of any hotel swimming pool! Get your waterproof camera or your waterproof phone bag and take some spectacular pics! The pool can get crowded, even at 7am, but there will be plenty of room for that amazing selfie!"
,,the view is breathtaking,4.0,,I went at night at night around eight o clock . I had a glass of wine which cost me about 21 us .I am glad I went at this time because when I left at 10 oclock there was a cover charge which I don't know how much they charge . The view is worth every penny . I don't regret the experience
,,Breathtaking Views - Magnificent Sunsets,5.0,,"The place to go for a romantic evening, champagne and amazing views of Singapore. Make a reservation for an outside table. You will not be disappointed."
,,Expensive but the view is amazing - night time is better than day.,5.0,,"Evening view is lovely with Singapore lit up. Book to eat or drink upstairs but it's pricey - with dinner, you don't have to pay to see the view."
,,Hazy Singapore,4.0,,"We went to Singapore for the ITB trade show at Marina Convention Center. The timing wasn't so good because the whole city was covered by smoke from Indonesia. So pity.

Anyway, Singapore city was just charming as it was. We walked around at Marina Bay area, visit the Merion, and had a chance to watch the laser shows at Marina Bay Sands. Even in the hazy evening it still looked amazing. Good to watch."
,,the new wonder...,5.0,,an awesome piece of architecture. come out of Bay Front MRT station and u are under the three towers of Marina Bay Sands. u can get a better view of these towers from the Gardens by the Bay but the best view is from Esplanade Drive Bridge. from tower 3 u can go on top to the Skypark. entry for visitors is only to the observation deck and not the swimming pool. pool is only for the hotel guests. but its an experience to see Singapore from the deck. dont forget to see the Art Science Museum when at Bay Front.
,,A must visit!,5.0,,Incredible experience swimming with the skyscrapers! Lots of sunbeds to lounge on with drinks and food served to your bed..
,,Good building,4.0,,"Marina bay sand is one of Good architecture in this world. If you are going with mass rapid transit (mrt) , you can go to bay front mrt station from mrt station near of your location. You must know about mrt map."
,,A little underwhelming,3.0,,"$23 is cheaper than other similar attractions worldwide (Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, etc.) but this one was a bit of a let-down. Unlike the other towers which feature extensive information, history and entertainment, this one is just the viewing deck (plus a restaurant and pool for hotel guests). The view is nice, but I think the best views of Singapore include Marina Bay Sands from the outside. The hotel lobby area and casino are extremely bland. If you need to tick the box then go for it, but don't expect too much."
,,Views are Spectacular!,5.0,,"You must go to the Skypark to see Singapore from on high. For $23 (Singapore) you can view almost 360 degrees of the city. You can only go to the North side of the ""boat"" but well worth the money."
,,Excellent at Night,5.0,,"This is very close to the Casino , the best time to go is night for the gorgeous view . The view is just breathtaking . Go with your friends so that lots of pictures can be taken as you will not get this type of view in any other place. Avoid daytime visit if possible"
,,Awesome view,4.0,,Must done it once! Awesome unique view on the Singapore financial district from outside an infinity pool. Perfect view on marima bay as well. There are pools for adults only. There are two jacuzzi's tip: come in the early morning than there is some space and not to hot to enjoy this amazing pool.
,,Absolutely useless !,3.0,,This is just one of the ways to attract people to have a look from the top of the hotel at an unreasonably high fees. There is nothing worth watching from the top. Do not spend money for getting nothing in return.
,,All about the view,4.0,,"The view from the skypark is stunning, looking at the Singapore skyline is very impressive. However the skypark is also overrun with tourists, so it is good to go up, take some pics and then get out. There are also some bars and restaurants quite pricy though, for those who want to enjoy the view for a longer period of time."
,,A Great Place to See Whole Singapore,4.0,,"We went there at an evening. It was a very pleasant feeling when I watched Singapore from here. My friend who lives in Singapore could explain me whole Singapore from here, including showing Malaysia too. The entrance fee was around 20-25 Singapore Dollars. A very nice place for have a snack while chatting with your friends or your loved one."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,DO this as a box ticker only. It costs S$46 each to go up to a high level wooden deck. All you get are the views. We were not impressed. The hotel itself is more like shopping mall or an airport. We weren't allowed to go to other areas and will not return. There are just as many nice views in Singapore for a lot less.
,,Skybar 57,4.0,,"Went up to the bar not the viewing deck at night. Very dark up there. Food, well snacks very expensive we didn't realise the wedges we ordered were $19 for a small bowl as it was so dark. Alcoholic drinks were nice but expensive as most places in Singapore. The view is amazing. It costs $23 pp to go to the viewing deck then if you have a coffee or something up there is will cost you mid $30. Better to go up to the bar for free and order a drink and enjoy a lovely night out."
,,So much to do,4.0,,You could spend a whole day here with the family. Lots to do in the whole complex. Nothing is open until 9.30 so if your up early try and find something else to do before it all gets going. The viewing platform is a must but get up there first thing or late in the day as it's very hot. Avoid the skating rink. It's not ice and very hard for kids (and adults) to skate on.
,,My first time for Casino,5.0,,"Great to be here on my first day in Singapore, 5 star service and equip, great and well trained staff, I won 850sd just for an hour only"
,,a must see,5.0,,we took the lift to the viewing platform.the pool is not accessible to the general public.only hotel guests enjoy this privilege .there are some food outlets at the top.they also offer the normal tourist photo opportunities at the lift area.you must visit on a clear day to obviously get the best photo snaps.
,,A must do to any travellor,5.0,,A quick trip to the 56th floor and what a sight awaited us. The view was spectactular if a little nerve racking. We saw magnificent scenery in all directions and so glad we paid the $20. To anyone thinking about it.....just do it.
,,Awesome View,4.0,,The view from the outdoor observation deck on the 56th floor is awesome. But you have to be a guest of the Sands hotel to see the rest of the Sky Park and use the infinity pool overlooking the city. There is an expensive restaurant there also but you need reservations to get in for a meal or drinks. Some people go up and stay to see the light and sound show at Gardens By The Bay at 7:45 and see the city lights go on at dusk. During the day it is not worth the price of $27 to just go up and look around.
,,Stunning views - but go to the bars.,5.0,,"This place is quite stunning, both for the views and to marvel at the feat of engineering that put it there in the first place. Acting on advice from a friend, we avoided paying the fee for the observation deck, and took another nearby lift straight up to the bars - you have to say to the girl at the bottom that you are going for a drink and she'll let you through. The cost of the drinks is high, but not over the top, and certainly cheaper than the observation deck prices. You can choose between two bars and you can also look at the infinity pool belonging to the hotel."
,,Stunning View!,4.0,,"If you want a really good view of Singapore then this is the place to go! It's a long way up so not necessarily ideal for people with a fear of heights but you don't need to get close to the ""edge"" if you don't want to. I don't like heights myself, but I stayed close to the centre of the building and am glad I didn't allow my fears to stop me seeing such an amazing view. We were given the choice of either going up to the viewing deck or going up to the bar for a drink and taking in the view from there. We chose the former as apparently you can't get down to the viewing deck from the bar area and that was what we really wanted to do."
,,Absolutely incredible building and a must to see.,5.0,,Went there just before dark and then went over to the gardens to see the night show I was totally astounded at the light show that was held in the gardens. It is something that you will always remember.
,,Free vs paying,4.0,,"We discovered you could pay to go to the observation deck - about $23 I believe, or you could go in the front entrance, ask the concierge where the lift to Ce La Vie (the bar) is and then go up and have a really really expensive drink (with a similar view that the observation deck has) without paying a fee. I enjoyed my drink and the free view!"
,,The infinity pool!,4.0,,"The infinity pool! That is the one and only reason you need to visit skypark.
It offers paranomic view of Singapore's skyline, day and night.

The other side of skypark offers a view of Gardens by the Bay and the surrounding Marina South area.

Best vantage point to view fireworks or F1 night race."
,,Quite a surprise...,3.0,,We stayed at Marina Bay Sands hotel for a couple of days just so we could see the skypark and the wonderful infinity pool. We were absolutely surprised to find it was freezing cold! People were wincing as they got into the pool. Not a comfortable swim considering this could potentially be one of the worlds best pools to experience.
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Terrible food but nice view. Go with Pant, i was in short, they gave me pant to wear its the dress code ! food is terrible (high end chef dont know what it taste like normal food) location is perfect, go outside on the bar later after food. As couple must visit. You can go FREE, yes Take Elevator for Tower # 1, go to skypark but dont go in go into BAR Area, which is surrounded by Sky park ! DONT PAY, again DONT PAY at Tower # 3.You dont need to buy anything at bar either. Pool is only for hotel guest, unless you know someone will give you access"
,,amazing views,5.0,,"We chose to go up here instead of going on the Singapore flyer. We weren't disappointed, not only was it cheaper but much higher and much better views. Although the public only have access to a small part - the rest (including the pool) being for the hotel guests, it was really good. It wasn't too busy (we went around sunset) so you could easily go and take photographs were ever you wanted.
We didn't have a cocktail, so I can't comment on them but if your looking for views for amazing pictures, you wont be disappointed."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Went up there as a hotel guest. Beautiful view and looking downwards, the city was so well organised and neat. Was there at about 10.40am and it was hot. It'll be good if the hotel can out up some shelters. But it's worth visiting even to pay if one is not a hotel guest. Maybe the next round, I'll be up there in the evening. I think the view will be even much better."
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,"The view from the skypark is breathtaking, despite of the fact that it is only one side of Singapore... but it is the most interesting one"
,,An unbelievable structure that must be visited.,5.0,,"A most unbelievable feat of engineering and construction. Just to see it is spectacular and overwhelming. Inside on the ground it is luxurious, spacious ultra modern. The shops, restaurants and bars are first class, We went to the roof top bar, cocktails and beer first class, adjacent to the infinity pool and even though we could not access it (house guests only) it is amazing. The views over Singapore give one a feeling of how big this building is. The downside of this floor is that you can only see the city side of Singapore but that does not detract from the ambience and overall experience. You can pay to go to the Garden Level but the no entry fee for the top level, the reasonable cost of drinks and food plus the atmosphere of the roof is in our opinion a better option.
After visiting or staying or eating or drinking, it is a must to go back to the gardens at ground level and up close for the evening light show - do not miss.
Do not go to Singapore without visiting the absolutely spectacular Marina Bay Sands Skypark. You will not have any difficulty finding it as it stands out like the proverbial dog's hind leg.
John and Chris"
,,It's Singapore,5.0,,Symbol of Singapore. Modern and attractive country. High living standArd but good to experience. Look like a flying ship
,,View is amazing!,5.0,,The view from the skydeck is the clearest most beautiful view you could imagine at night.. i think it was a little expensive to go up ($80SG family) but in saying that it's a view that needs to be experienced when visiting Singapore. The lazer light show was not worth seeing from the top but the city skyline definetly was!
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing view. But you cannot use the swimming pool unless you stay at their hotel. A bit crowded. We took a cocktail at their bar at tower 1 and it was amazing!
,,Views views views,5.0,,"Although the public only have access to the ""front"" part of the viewing area ( the rest saved for hotel clients) this is an absolute must see. Great to view the city of Singapore and try and name the attractions. Well worth the money"
,,Nice - unique - breathtaking but crowded and noisy!!,3.0,,"I expected more ! I saw the pictures and the only reason that I book Marina bay sands hotel was this pool !
It is always crowded with no dress policy!! You can see many type of people with different dresses swimming!!! . Not clean and noisy .
Beer is about 40 s$.
The view is amazing ."
,,Very Costly and Disappointing,1.0,,"Wow, such a huge money grab. I have never paid so much money for a viewing platform that offered so little. It cost something phenomenal like $38 per person, and when you got to the top, you could only walk around half of the outer deck, if that. Take 3 photos of the city, on the sides that the deck lets you see, then go back down again. Absolutely nothing for the money - get much better views and much cheaper by going on the Big Wheel rather than this costly disappointment."
,,Great View & Landscape,5.0,,Beautiful View & modern Architecture.Great place to visit and my family really like it.Hope to visit again this coming December
,,View and Amazing!,4.0,,"You can see the entire Singapore from the top. It is supposedly a 57th floor building and you get to visit the top floor. They no more allow access to the swimming pool and the food court to tourists anymore and it is only for people staying in hotel Marina Bay. We could spend about cool and windy 2 hours over here. Took photos, slow motion videos (jumping ;))! You can see the sea/ships/Singapore flyer/Marina Bay everything from here. Worth a visit for sure."
,,Great views!,4.0,,Worth going to the top for the views! I wouldn't advise paying for the sky park - instead go to the roof terrace bar for a drink and a snack and get the view included! Really lovely on a clear day!
,,Great views,3.0,,"We visited with our 8 and 12 year old boys. Great views once at the top, but not much else to do. We decided to have lunch, but the choice was limited for a family. There was a formal restaurant and bar snacks. Both options were overpriced. I'm glad we went up there for the experience."
,,A massive place!,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is worth a visit to fill your head with the sheer size of this building! Go to the 56th floor to gawk at the view below - just once it ok,"
,,"Too busy, not worth the time if you are a hotel guest",2.0,,"As a hotel guest, you get free access to this and I can see why - there's nothing to be gained by going as you have better access for free within the hotel itself.

As a tourist, it's a good way of seeing the sights of the city but it is too busy and the wait to get up is too long - spend your time somewhere else."
,,Nice views by dusk & night,4.0,,"I went up here before a year and a half ago or so when it was bright and not a very pleasant day. This time I went just before it got dark and then stayed until I got some good night shots. Have to admit that I prefer this place by night, the views are prettier and it also helped that it was a pretty good day with good visibility. Still a little pricey but you get the best views of Singapore from up there. Still recommendable."
,,Nice view,4.0,,nice view of all area in marina bay and around. But nothing more because the bar & cafe is for hotel guest only and the pool too of course
,,Bird's view of Singapore,4.0,,To have a nice view of Singapore this place is an excellent option. The restaurants there offer great cuisine. 57th floor provide a fantastic view.
,,Stunning views (and potentially free),5.0,,"Rather than pay the approx $25 fee per person (we heard its reduced to approx $20 if you show your SIA boarding pass) we were entered tower 1 (not tower 3 for the sky deck) with the intention of buying a drink from the bar on the same level (apparently there is a min charge of around $30) but we were a bit naughty and wandered around level 57 without actually going into the bar and basically got almost all the same views as you would have got from the sky deck, but for free!!!!. The views were stunning!
Coming from Melbourne, Australia couldnt believe the number of ships in the channel (must have been at least 50)"
,,Amazing view from one of the best hotel,4.0,,"Super all round view of the city from the skypark (garden by the bay, Singapore flyer, there were lot of practice firework happening in the near by stadium, hence it created mesmerising experience for us. It had a long queue for getting tickets"
,,Amazing view over Marina Bay! But mostly crowded...,4.0,,"The view at night over Marina Bay was amazing from MB Sands Skypark. Still they charge 21 SGD to go up the elevator. Once you reach the 53th floor you will see an amazing view, but unfortunately the platform is mostly crowded with a lot of other visitors. Still it was a nice experience on top of MBS which is of course a landmark of Singapore."
,,Amazing view of Singapore,5.0,,The viewing deck was amazing you are 56 stories up and can see for miles it's a must for photographers.
,,Bird's eye view,5.0,,Visited as part of our Singapore At Night tour. Be prepared for queues but the views are worth the wait. Would probably be good during the day but is absolutely stunning at night ! Highly recommended 👍
,,Captivating view,5.0,,"Mind boggling architecture. Captivating view, architecture is simply fantastic and scenic view. It just gets better as the night goes darker."
,,amazing views,4.0,,Fortunately as a resident at the hotel I didn't have to pay the charge to access the Skypark observation deck. The views are amazing and we took many photographs.
,,Nice mordern Architecture,5.0,,Overwhelming surrounding and be lucky to get a view from top. Its heart of Singapore. Spend little time in front of fountain.
,,Great view at night,4.0,,"We went up at night and the view was amazing and so was the cost. However, it was part of a tour so we didn't mind! The walk around is great because you can see the city spread out below and the lights really make it beautiful. There was a really cool breeze and we enjoyed standing there in the cool night."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,This is well worth it. Lots of people but the observation deck is huge so no dramas getting a good spot to take photos. Gives a great views of the bay and the city. Dusk is best and cooler too because there is no shade.
,,Beautiful illuminated view of Singapore's Skyline,5.0,,There's a separate elevator to reach the skylark for tourists not staying at the Marina bay Sands. Awesome view of the city illuminated at night. Gardens by the bay looks mesmerising from above.
,,It's pretty amazing up here,5.0,,"The best way to experience the Sky Park is surely to stop at the hotel, but this absolutely worth the visit if you are not a guest at Marina Bay.

The view is amazing, and the chance to get that awesome photo with the whole of the Singapore skyline in the background one not to miss."
,,Awesome view.,5.0,,"I was there on a night time and the view was wonderful. Overlooking the city, your eyes will feast on magnificent light of Singapore."
,,"Amazing views, worth the access fee",5.0,,Amazing views of the Central Business District and surrounding bay and gardens. My advice is go in the evening for best views and atmosphere. The architecture is just amazing and the views can't be beaten.
,,Enjoyable evening,4.0,,Enjoy the views from the marina and the shopping at the Marina Bay Le Sands. Spectacular lights at night and plenty to do around
,,"Don't buy a ticket, just go to C'est La Vie",3.0,,"You can spend $20 on a ticket and go to the observation deck where the views are stunning but they have no seating and minimal refreshments. OR you can just take the elevator one more floor up and buy yourself a drink at the bar one floor higher. The drinks are pricy but you're paying for the views, which are stunning."
,,Great 360 Views,4.0,,The Skypark deck has an amazing 360 degree view of Singapore. You have breath taking views of Gardens by the Bay. On the Sky deck you get peeps of the hotels infinity pool. Oh how the other half live.
,,Save yourself the ticket price.,5.0,,Save yourself the ticket price to visit the Skypark and visit one of the two bars for free instead where you get the same amazing views and can enjoy a cocktail for less than the price of visiting the Skypark. It's definitely worth a visit as you get a real perspective on Singapore and can't get views like this anywhere else. Would have loved to have been staying in the hotel to enjoy the spectacular infinity pool.
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,"The view is nice but not worth 26 dollars when you only get to walk around and take pictures. For another 150 dollars just get a room and have free access to the pool and not be herded around like a bunch if cattle. This is truly a tourist trap and once you've paid a take the elevator up you step right into a photo trap where you have to jump away from the groupies trying to sell you a photo.

While the idea of viewing the Marina is nice for 5 dollars you can go up to the top of the metal trees and get great photos. Would not recommend donating to this attraction might have been more fun to have made donation to the casino on the way out."
,,Amazing Vistas and Friendly Service,5.0,,"Upon entering the booth where you pay to take the elevator to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, my partner and I were apologised to by the attendant for the wait in having to make our way through an empty line.

Unfortunately, the cost to take the elevator to the top of the building is excessive at about SG$25.00/person, but once you are on the Skypark the view is wonderful - encompassing the entire south-eastern part of Singapore.

At the top you will also find a small kiosk attended by lovely staff, however, I did find the food and souvenirs quite expensive."
,,Dr,5.0,,"This is the highest observation deck in Singapore and because of that you do see almost the whole of the city's skyline.
It is expensive for what you get but I suppose it is reasonable if you wish to see the city from this perspective.
They will try and get you to buy a souvenir picture they took of you and I found out beforehand that if you refused to buy on entry, they will try and persuade you to buy on exit. Refused their initial offer and regardless of the offer, knock them down and then attempt to go down on the lift(which just next to the vendor) and he will give it to you at s reasonable price. I paid $20 instead of 35."
,,Awesome view but no shade,3.0,,"Went in the afternoon, very, very hot and no shade. S$20 to go up as we had flown SIA . Don't need to go back."
,,Infinity Negorni,5.0,,Having a refreshing Negroni at the top of this location: great view of Singapore and the super infinity pool of the hotel
,,"las vegas in singapore , good for young people",4.0,,"My daughter and her friends stayed at this hotel, I stayed at the shangri la, but visited my daughter several times. The hotel is enormous, the pool setting is spectacular. The mall connected too the hotel is excellent. We ate at Spagos which was very good, with a spectacular setting. The rooms though had no character and felt like average rooms in las vegas.. The service at the hotel was very average. Very , very crowed hotel."
,,The object of photography,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark be one point of the object of photography because it feels incomplete if you have not got this in the Singapore.
,,Spectacular view on Singapore's skyline,5.0,,"When I have visitors in town I usually take them to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands building from where one has a great view on Singapore's skyline - if it is not raining.
There is always some sort of credit card special on for a discount on the admission, so it is always worth asking for it.
An obligatory photo is taken before embarking on the elevator to the 56th floor and the sales people prize the photos a lot, yet they are quite expensive and probably unnecessary given that today practically everybody has a phone or camera with them.
Thereafter I take my guests to the bar on the 57th floor.
In February I took friends to the Sky on 57 restaurant. This was a bit of a disappointment because despite having made a reservation the table had no direct view of the skyline but of the restaurant's bar instead. Conversation was accordingly difficult given the frequent entering and exiting of people to and from the bar."
,,Drink curry and unique view.,5.0,,"Having looked at the options my wife and l decided that we would rather have drink at the top rather than just stand and look. The reports also suggested that the price was not that different. We went to the lobby of Tower one and spoke with the concierge who told us all we had to do was go to floor 57 and go in the bar. There was a minimum charge of 30 Singapore dollars for the drinks. This we duly did and without fuss, no queues and in incredible speed we were stepping out on floor 57. We then saw on our right the appropriately named 'Sky 57' bar. We went in and were immediately seated outside which was our choice and given a menu. My wife and I opted for two Singapore Slings which were 24 Singapore dollars each we also opted to have two curries at 15 dollars each. Whilst waiting we sat in comfort admiring the view anticipating our drinks. The Slings arrived and although no expert they looked great and tasted even better. The curries arrived which were much better than l was expecting and satisfied our need for food.

One example we had finished we could stroll around the top over Tower 1. Although you have open access to three sides you are able to enter the residents area or pool. However you have unrestricted access to the three sides and you could stay up there a considerable time as there were few people up there and no pressure to leave.

This is not a cheap option but it was quick,easy and allows us to say we went to the top and had a Singapore Sling whilst admiring the view.
The staff we encountered the during this visit were helpful, friendly and a credit."
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is very well situated in Marina Bay. The ticket is a little bit expensive to go to the top for the view but when you arrive to the roof the view is spectacular.
Best spot to have a landscape of Singapore from the Skypark"
,,I hate heights but enjoyed this.,5.0,,"This was a fantastic experience, the sky park connects the top of three builds has a swimming pool at the top and a great views of the city of Singapore. Would highly recommend."
,,Didn't want to leave,5.0,,I went here in the evening. The temperature had dropped. The humidity had dropped. There was a nice breeze. And the most outstanding views you could ever imagine.
,,Great view,5.0,,We really enjoyed the fantastic view from the bar and pool area on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
,,Great place,4.0,,"It is a huge place that have everything needed.
The hotel is very big so you dont feel the personalised service but the rooms are very nice ""Las Vegas style"" specially there is the only casino within the premises..
Skypark only the pool and the lounge bar good to visit once."
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5.0,,We were fortunate to stay at Marina Bay Sands and had unlimited access to the Skypark and infinity pool. Definitely worth a visit and a drink on the bar on the roof
,,"stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (see review!), free to guests, charge for outsiders.",5.0,,"Best view, by far in the whole of Singapore, either from the 280 meter high observation deck or the restaurants and bars or indeed from the 150 metre long swimming pool or one of the 2 jacuzzis. Charge for non-residents"
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"This place is a rip off and I don't often say that about things in Singapore. At SGD23 to take a lift to a concrete floor with barely a bit of green and be told that you cannot return once you leave for the day is gross - not that you would either want to stay long as there's no where to sit except a cafe that charges ridiculous prices and a gift shop that's worse. In reality a visit of 10 minutes is more than enough. I can't think of anything else I would choose to spend over £1/minute on indicating the level of rip off.

The mall underneath has shops with silly prices for things that certainly for me are not every day purchases, in fact I didn't see anything I might want in any of them.

A place to avoid."
,,You cannot go to Singapore and not visit,5.0,,The atmosphere was great and what a way to enjoy a glass of wine taking in the breathtaking views! It was very busy but you did not feel rushed.
,,Visited floor 56 for the fantastic views over southern Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must for all visitors to Singapore. It costs 15$ to go up in the very fast lift. The view of the Marina Gardens, Stadium, Southern Singapore is magnificent.
The viewing area is large and perhaps one day we will return and stay in the hotel. Good sighting of the F1 track."
,,Rooftop experience,4.0,,Take an express elevator to the Skypark and sip a cool drink at the bar while soaking in the view from the top of Marina Bay Sands. The atmospheric pollution can be troublesome and spoil the views but tryo early morning or late afternoon into evening when the tall buildings are seen to their best when lights are on. Impressive.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Amazing 360 degree views across the city. The only downside was that it could be very misleading to find the entrance from inside the enormous mall. It should have also been explained at ground level that entrance to the restaurant area required an extra entry ticket, instead of getting up there and told to go down again to get it."
,,Amassing hotel,5.0,,Amazing hotel. From top of hotel you can see panorama of Singapore. This is a magnificent and amazing view
,,Great visit,5.0,,Skypark is a must when in Singapore. We stayed at Marina Bay Sands Hotel so we had unlimited access to Sky Park. View is fabulous! Absolute must!
,,Fantastic View!,5.0,,"Visited here twice (once in May 2015 and the other in March 2016).

Some parts were being renovated in May 2015 so cant really compare the experiences.

But the view is spectacular! I love how the views also differ depending on which side you look, i.e. you can view the Central Business District skyline, or the wide open sea or the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Expensive drink,4.0,,"You can go up there for a expensive drink and enjoy the view. Many tourists up there, unfriendly staff too. You can't go to the pool as long as you dont stay at the hotel..."
,,Simply Breathtaking,5.0,,"This has great overlooking views of Marina Bay. Getting here can be quite pricy though. Each adult ticket will cost you SGD 23. But the views are stunning.

However, after a few minutes, it get's boring as it's really just a viewing deck.

You can refresh yourself at the bars nearby, but don't expect them to come cheap. It's best to bring water with you as it can be quite hot during the day.

I would suggest to come here at night as the views are stunning."
,,The views!,4.0,,A tad pricey and if you want a picture add an extra $55. The views make up for it all though. Essentially you get a 360 degree view. Decided to go up the sands rather than the singapore flyer as it's higher. Jealous of the hotel guests that get to use the infinity pool!
,,Have a Drink and Enjoy the View,4.0,,Avoid the admission charge by having a drink in the Skypark - it is a much better value. A unique experience.
,,Hospitable concierge with a great coffee shop - 'Sweet Spot',5.0,,"With an impressive structure, hospitable concierge and a great coffee shop ('Sweet Spot'), it is indeed a delight to visit this hotel and its surrounding areas."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Better to visit it daytime , though the view was great at night , cool wind means a lot in Singapore, you can find it there , Good experience"
,,Excellent panoramic views,5.0,,We went here at nighttime where we saw the lovely city lights of Singapore. It was beautiful. A good place to go to when staying at Marina Bay Sands.
,,"Expensive, but unique experience",5.0,,"Costs a lot just for an elevator ride, but the views are incredible, especially if you get let into the infinity pool area (don't think they allow this for non hotel guests any more)"
,,Three Tower Hotel Complex,5.0,,"Iconic hotel on "" bay front"", consisits of three towers, with boat shaped top floor which is called "" sky park"". The sky park overlooks the the entire Bay front and gives a panoramic view of the entire Islsnd city and Malaysia and Indonesia too."
,,Too expensive,1.0,,Nice view but too expensive. There is not enough sitting area to rest and relax. I was expecting to sit back on a park bench for relaxing while enjoying the view. Seems like they want people to get out quickly.
,,Good value at $20pp.,5.0,,What a view from the observation deck in the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. It is a must see for spectacular views across Singapore.
,,Tall if u say so,4.0,,"Good view ,amazing structure, superbly built.The mall below is huge with boat ride also.Good Indian food joint present.you can access the gardens by the bay through there."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"Nice view of the city, but one has to ask whether it is worth paying so much for a 5 minute observation? I am not so sure I would have done it again"
,,A must do,5.0,,By far the best view and great atmosphere - lively and expensive ! Ladies get in free to the club - great music and cocktails.
,,The view of Singapore is amazing,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands, so the trip to the top of the Sands was free. There is a charge for those who are not guests. The inifinity pool is cool! The bars are crowded and expensive. But maybe a drink at the pool is the way to go!"
,,Beautiful Nature break from Shopping or the Casino,5.0,,"Going to the iconic Marina Bay Sands is an exhilarating experience no matter what time of the year one is visiting. There is always so many things to do here. There is something for everyone. In fact, one can spend the entire day here and never get bored.

My family and I visit here every time we are in Singapore. My father and husband like the casino, my mother likes the sky park, I like the shopping, my sister likes the ice skating ring next to the food court and of course, we all love the food court!

Although most of the shops are all very high end designer brands, one can always have a wonderful time window shopping or actually shop from the array of regular shops too. The skating ring is always a lot of fun and the food court is quite diverse with a good range of different types of cuisines.

I would highlt recommend going to see what plays or musicals they are showing at the theatre, which is also housed there. My mother and I have enjoyed conerts, musicals and plays there, even music festivals too. The trick is to do the research a couple of weeks before travel and then book the tickets online.

The sky park is a nice place to take a break from mall and the other attractions. There is a wonderful lilly pond where one can sit and enjoy the skyline and take photos. It is also possible to take a amoke break there. That ia something my husband always keeps track of since he is a smoker and Singapore is quite strict about, well, everything.

And last but not least, the institution houses the only casino in the country and is a must visit for those interested. There's a smoking floor and a non smoking floor as well, which is wonderful. And every kind of game you want to play. There are some reataurants too. But nothing to write home about. And it is open 24/7.

And if you find yourself really enjoying this institution I would recommend staying at the hotel. It does house the largest swimming pool in Singapore. All the way on the roof and in the shape of a ship. It really is one of a kind and therefore has become an icon. It is quite expensive but nothing is too expensive if one plans ahead."
,,Nice Hotel but Expensive,3.0,,"We visited the Hotel when we had friends staying at the Hotel. We visited their room and it was very nice. Very large and gorgeous views. We then went to the top of the building wherein we sat in the bar and had a drink.

The drinks were extremely expensive and the staff were not so friendly. I really didn't enjoy my time at this bar and I will never stay or drink their again. I stayed at the Fairmont in Singapore and for the price you pay at this hotel, I would pick the Fairmont hands down.

Too expensive and very overrated."
,,Awesome View,5.0,,the view from the top was amazing! is kinda a little pricey but it is worth it. for me is one of those things that must see even just once if you happen to be in Singapore.
,,The best spot for views of Singapore,4.0,,"The Skypark is located at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There is a 270 degree view of the Singapore skyline looking out towards the ocean and the city, for Formula 1 fans you are right about the start/finish line of the Singapore night race. The price is reasonable but be careful, they try to get you to buy photos all of the time..."
,,Another haven to enjoy a bird's eyeview of the city,5.0,,"To get a free lift to the top, you need to get booked at one of their top restaurants (Ku De Ta) where they serve sumptuous meals. After the food delight, enjoy the city scenery from above. A lot of tourists flock to it though, so be patient to get your turn to peek along its polycarbonate/glass shielded railings.

By the way, they won't allow you to use your camera tripod, so best to practice a steady hand for your DSLR night shots."
,,Top attraction in Singapore! Magnificent views,5.0,,"You don't need to stay in the hotel to access the skypark, but if you do you don't need to queue downstairs and can just take the elevator up from your room to the pool deck and get in from there. Splendid views and excellent for pictures over gardens by the bay, singapore flyer, Marina Bay..."
,,From the viewing deck the sights are amazing.,5.0,,The hotel is a fantastic thing to look at even without going to the top. There was lots of people walking through and using the hotel facilities. I had to go to tower 3 and pay $23.00 to go up to the viewing deck. I had my photo taken and it was ready when I got to the top. The viewing deck is not right at the top because you have to book into the hotel prior to get to the swimming pool area. The views are amazing so don't miss out on going up there. Don't forget to take your camera. Umbrellas for a rainy day.
,,Busy but glad we stayed,5.0,,"The infinity pool and the views is what sold us on staying here. Yes, it is pricey but it is singapore. Easy access to gardens by the bay and shopping. Would stay again. Ps sweet spot near tower 3 has great coffee and cakes."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Amazing view. Restaurant service is kind and fast. Food is delicous and tasty. Very relaxed. Family, business and friends meetings are all perfect here. Basically, perfect place and must see place of Singapore. I think you have to reserve first. It will be packed if you don't reserve."
,,Awesome hotel!,4.0,,"Stayed here for ten nights whilst exploring the beautiful city.

Close to everything.

The pool area is the best I've ever seen. No comparison what so ever. The 360 view of the city is truly incredible.

If not staying at the hotel, at least visit Ce la vie for a drink and enjoy the view."
,,Okay - but it's only a view,3.0,,"Decided to go up - paid my $23. You queue up for the lift and they take one of those silly pictures of you in front of a back drop (which they then try to sell when you leave). Views are great - but it's just like any observation deck. There is a bar and obligatory souvenir shop up there. Lots of space.
What it is about Singapore and seats by the way? Unless you go to the bar at the look out there are no seats to just sit and rest and take in the view - there is even a sign saying do not sit on stairs. Singapore does this again & again - whether it be malls or wherever, they seem to hate to have people sitting (doesn't make them money?). As someone that can't walk far and gets tired it's annoying.
Anyway, the views were good but really, 10 mins and your done. The deck is at one end of the huge platform facing the Wheel and Raffles City, you don't go near (or see) the famous hotel infinity pools so if that's your image of Marina Bay expectations, you will be disappointed. If it's quite try it - not sure it's worth queuing for."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,"Quite a view from the sky park, best if you can do it on a fairly clear day. There is a charge which is quite reasonable, but the charge for photographs is a bit OTT. When you come down and look where you have been it's a bit scary. You are only allowed on to the viewing platform and cannot access the bar or garden areas they are reserved for hotel guests."
,,Wow - what a view!!,5.0,,Amazing views of the city - we were even looking down at the Singapore Flyer! Great views of the Gardens by the Bay as well as lots of other attractions in Singapore. Well worth a visit!
,,Go to The bar for a drink - and save the entry cost !,4.0,,"Instead of visiting the SkyPark - it's better to pay money for a drink and chill in the bar! The view is amazing ...

The SkyPark gives you access to a 180 degrees view of the city skyline - and the divine gardens by the Bay. However you cannot view the pool or order any drinks ..."
,,Perfect view.,5.0,,"We only made it to the sky park by night. But I think you will get the best view if you go there by dawn.
For this also we have to purchase tickets, what we did was we bought the tickets before we went there(through an agent). There was a little bit of crowd in the ticketing queue. So we had a chance to skip that as we bought the tickets earlier.

You can see the bird eye view of the Gardens by the bay , Singapore flyer and lot of other buildings from here.
There is no place to sit but you can always carry a small mat, water bottle nd some snack to eat. There is one souvenir shop and snack shop but the prices are high."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Amazing views, fabulous restaurant... A must on a visit to Sing!
Great views over the marina, the merlion and the bay gardens.
On an evening the light and water fountain shows are great.....then for the young or young at heart there's the night club Pangea....you never know who you're rubbing shoulders with :)"
,,dream come true,5.0,,I always wanted to be there from the time it opened and it took me only a month to be there and it was worth every penny spent for.
,,Great view.,4.0,,"The Skypark is only a viewing area. This does not give you access to the Hotel, however the view from here is higher than the Flyer."
,,Good view of down town Singapore,3.0,,"Because of the height at 57 floors up, you get a better view of the surrounding area compared to Singapore Flyer. No time restriction unlike Singapore Flyer (one revolution). Also cheaper ticket."
,,Views are fantastic,5.0,,"The best time to go is the evening. You don't need to pay to go up, just go up to the top for a drink in the bar (very expensive drinks but just remember you haven't paid to go up !) you can see just about all of Singapore!
It's accessible from the shopping centre below which contains all the (very) high end shops"
,,Nice place to click some awesome pictures of Singapore bay area,4.0,,Very good place for photgraphy and to see Singapore from a height. There is also a pub on the top. This area is separated from the hotel area - so you wont get to see the pool etc.
,,Surprised,5.0,,"Nice to be there as have been wondering what is this structure is about.
We told taxi driver we want to go to see this building with the ship on the roof
(I must mention also most taxi driver in Singapore are very knowledgeable can almost be a tourist guide )
It's only until our arrival at the site then that I realised this whole complex is made up 2 sections, there a shopping centre-casino sitting on one side of the high way and on the other side is this beautiful iconic 3 towers of Marina Bay Sands Skypark hotel both joint together by a overhead bridge over this very busy high way. Plenty of designer stores at the shopping complex with casino located in that complex, and for the hotel tower itself remind me of Burg Al Arabs ( this iconic 7 stars hotel in Dubai)
except that its interior decoration especially the reception area is another surprised for me in the fact that it so simple not as impressive as one would have expected considering such an iconic and beautiful building's look from outside they don't even have a waiting sitting area guest have no choice but sitting on floor artwork and there these hotel staff keep looking concern and sometimes come to tell young guest not to touch the artwork"
,,A birds eye view of Singapore,4.0,,"I caught the lift to the top of this hotel with many other tourists from all over the world.
Once you are on the board walk in the sky you look down on the city below.You look down at the structure of Gardens by the Bay and wonder about the marvellous engineering.
In another direction is the harbour with many ships awaiting to enter.
The Singapore eye appears a small speck in the distance.
You could almost be a bird looking down on this wonderful city full of such unusual and visually stunning buildings.
Well worth a view."
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,We took the lift up to the 57th floor and were welcomed by some lovely staff who showed us to an excellent table. Drinks were expensive but worth every penny. The views were spectacular! There is a swimming pool on this floor too but it is only available to residents of the hotel. It looked very nice though.
,,Room with a view,5.0,,Visited the sky deck after a business meeting. Went early evening to watch the sunset over the city. What a view! Got a table by the edge and had a complete vista of the city scape. The drinks were expensive (£14 for a cocktail) but worth the price for the situation you are drinking them in. 57 floors up and overhanging the towers. It was busy but quick to get up to in the lift and we got a table quite quickly too.
,,You Should be Here!!!,5.0,,"It's a good place to spend the evening time with my lovely family. The view was so amazing, the sunset was so romantic. Thanks Mylene for recommending us the nice food and beverages. We really appriciate all of the courtesy and warmth that she have shown us."
,,"An awesome view, through a bureaucratic entry route",4.0,,"When arriving to Marina Bay Sands to check out the Skypark - with the best view of Singapore - do choose the bar entry! We chose the platform entry through the ground floor, don't! They have a very bureaucratic way of running that part of their operation, it is slow and cumbersome. The lifts used are not unique to Ground floor to Skylark use, so availability is varied and often the lifts don't offer much space at all as other hotel guests are in the lift already. Once up, no complaints! And our impression was that bar visitors got to visit the platform anyway. The cost of two drinks (juice if you like) are likely similar to separate SkyPark tickets so bar entry is a winner."
,,"It's a beautiful sight, but a little dull if you don't like shopping",4.0,,"You have to see the laser show. It's beautiful and lights up the night. There's also a water show on the other side, but the laser show is better."
,,An awesome building !,5.0,,When you visit the gardens by the bay you are very close to this magnificent building. It's nice to watch but we were'nt interested in the view at the roof of the building........
,,A Sky Ship,5.0,,Visit Marina Bay Sands Hotel. A unique piece of architecture. Visitors can take a lift to the top deck and have a drink at the bar over looking Marina Bay. After your visit there is lots to see.
,,Fabulous views form the skypark well worth a visit,5.0,,"Located on the 56th floor Marina bay skypark give you an excellent viewing platform - accessed from the Marina Bay shopping area by following the signs to the Skypark it is relatively easy to find

The access just gives you access to the viewing platform of you would like to sit by the pool and enjoy the facilities on the 57th floor you need to be a guest at the hotel - this is now on my bucket list for next time I am passing through Singapore"
,,The ending to a day of shopping in Marina Bay Sands mall,4.0,,"We had drinks here, was excited to experience the view from this altitude. One word breathtaking, one of must do in Singapore."
,,Amazing venue and views...,5.0,,"We stayed at this hotel so my pictures of the skypark are loaded on the hotel review. It was incredible, with spectacular views."
,,Great Overall Experience,4.0,,"If you wish to get into the pool, be sure and stay at the hotel. All other activities on the sky park (walkways, bars, disco, restaurants) are free to public. Be careful of dress codes around dusk and night time as shorts and open-toes shoes are not allowed at the vars and restaurants."
,,Sky park MBS,5.0,,"Lovely 360 degree veiw of Singapore
You can see Singapore flyer
All nights laser show starts at 8pm and 9:30 pm
Music and all laser show is nice specially for kids
You can watch the show from 57th floor of MBS or riverside both are good but I preferd riverside"
,,On the list of things to do,4.0,,"We decided to do the flyer during the day and this at night and it was amazing!!! The views of the city, the flyer and the gardens by the bay were simply amazing and I think way better then during the day.

The process was very easy we got tickets and were at the top within about five minutes. We went on Friday night and although it was busy we had plenty of opportunity to get close to the edge and take as many photos as you want."
,,Another 'must do' in Singapore.,4.0,,"The amazing architecture of the Marina Bay Sands is a standout in a city where inspired architecture is the norm. Obviously it's a box that has to be ticked on a trip to Singapore. Arriving at tower three a quick elevator tide to level 57 saw us confined to the bar area due to dress regulations (no shorts). Great views, expensive drinks and given the boot at 8pm when dress code applies to all areas. Well worth the visit although the view is often obscurred by haze."
,,meh!!,3.0,,A little bit disappointed with the Skypark if I'm being honest. While the views are amazing there is limited shade that when you visit during the day its like a sauna up there. The staff weren't overly friendly at the ticket counter either. My advice is perhaps dont go during the day.
,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"From just a basic architectural standpoint, this is an amazing place. Truly amazing!!

A couple of disappointments, however. After paying 40 US dollars to visit the observation deck, I didn't expect to get ""hit"" with someone expecting us to pay $70.00 (yes, $70.00!!!!) for our picture that had been taken prior to the elevator ride. That was truly insulting and the management should be ashamed of such a scam. Also, I was a tad disappointed in the so called ""beautiful"" light show at 8:00 pm. I've seen much better elsewhere.

But with all that said, the trip to the top and the view from the observation desk is worth doing at least once!!"
,,Superb views,4.0,,"probably best to come up her in the morning before it gets too hazy. Note that if you want a cocktail then go up between 12 and 3. Ice creams are good. Nowhere to sit and you only have access to the observation deck at the eastern end of the ""ship"" - you have to be a hotel guest to get to the infinity pool or upper garden levels. Nevertheless, not to be missed."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"The views are amazing and the swimming pool of the hotel is unique, it looks like you are bathing in the sky."
,,Amazing,5.0,,you can't stop looking at this hotel it's amazing and to say that there is an infinity pool at the top is unbelievable but it's 15 dollars each just to go up in the lift to the top There is a restaurant at the top
,,Romantic Place Not Only for Couple but Also for Single :p,4.0,,"Romantic Place ?? Yup !!
But that's not only for couple ... Single also can feel the romantic atmosphere here ... Just take a look down and close your eyes feel the fresh air ... You can be amazed with the beautiful and memorable that created from man power ..."
,,"Wow 57 storeys up, what a view",5.0,,Fantastic experience. For the cost of a cocktail you can sit for hours on a balmy night enjoying the views. Not to be missed
,,Good place,5.0,,Good. place to walk around in the evening Although every area in Singapore itself is worth visiting but yes If not Msrina Bay Sand nothing in Singapore Go and enjoy the evening
,,Great views,4.0,,Can see some great views from the 56th floor. Quick ride up in lift. Would like to see view by day as went in the evening which was nice to see.
,,Not to be missed 57 stories topped with a pool !!,5.0,,"The marina bay sands skypark can been seen miles away and with just a metro trip out to the marina south pier you can visit the top floor bar and watch the patrons enjoying the views from their pool in the sky standing on three massive hotel towers
Singapore buildings look like small pieces in a model village from this height so good place for a camera .Viewing places are all around
On the ground floor is an excellent dim sum restaurant which does specials so good value at $20"
,,Crazy City Views,5.0,,"Its not the cheapest attraction and its fairly plain and basic once your up there, but the view is truly spectacular!"
,,SG skyline like never before,4.0,,"This is by far the best place for views of the Singapore skyline. You do have to pay to up to the top, but it is worth it. Not good on a rainy day or if it is cloudy at all. Enjoy!"
,,"Blown away by the hotel, skypark and pool.",5.0,,"Stayed here for 7x nights, tower 1 facing the bay. Amazing views from our level, got to see the laser show each night.

We had read a few mixed reviews about the check in service and the pool being packed, but we experienced the complete opposite. Check in took 5 mins and the pool we could always find a seat and a spot.

The pool has an adults only section which is great! Best time for the pool is early in the morning at 6-6:30am, as there is no one up there +between 11am-3pm (figure it must be when people have checked out).

Gym and fitness club awesome, open early and late too. Also a hot bath, sauna and steam room which is nice on cold days.

Loved our stay!!"
,,This building complex is a wonder!,5.0,,Exciting shopping - exquisite dining venues with stunning views - this complex is not to be missed. The infinity pool cannot be accessed unless you are a hotel guest but the Ce La Vi restaurant on the 57th floor more than makes up for it!
,,Pricey but beautiful view,3.0,,"You pay to just see the view of the entire city, but you are not allowed to the hotel bar (on top) unless you are staying at the hotel.
But at night they do a beautiful laser light show - but this is best OFF of the tower and viewing upwards.

The mall part of the hotel is very open, but all pricey shops. I'm sure the rooms have some great views - but we only went to the rooftop view. (Again you are only allowed on one side though)."
,,Amazing !,5.0,,"Oh my godnes !! The most beautiful hotel i ever since .. All of singapura view from this hotel .. With pool in up , make the hotel attracted so much .. You shoul been there .. 😀"
,,Skypark touch the sky,4.0,,"Very beautifull views of skypark! We went to level 52, and it's not regretable
We can reach this building by MRT to marinabay
Very easy
And if we also can enjoy the marinabay and gardens by the bay, because they are in 1 area marina
But if we want to go to skypark, as not the hotel guess, we just only can explore the main deck. Not the whole unit of the ship"
,,Thailand stopover,4.0,,"This is a must do when you are in Singapore, absolute so much to see in this area with amazing shops and of course this great building."
,,Sky Park Marina Bay Sands - phenomenal views,4.0,,If possible make the effort to go the Skypark at night for a spectacular view of the Singapore skyline. Easy access through the hotel and you can also access the Sky Bar and Ces La Vie Restaurant.
,,Skypark,5.0,,"Amazing views from the Skypark at night well worth the money, catch the sunset and views over the whole of Sinagapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Feels like your on a giant space cruise ship when your swimming in the infinity pool - just spectacular. Had heard mixed reviews about quality of the rooms but we stayed in a Premier Room and it was perfect and spacious. Had I stayed elsewhere and only got to view this marvel of architecture from another vantage point I would have kicked myself. Sky park is out of this world. Shoppes are excellent for serious big brand shopping. Kids love the pool too. Will be back for a kid free visit to enjoy the restaurants and bars more.
,,Unmissable,5.0,,"A rooftop 'ship' restaurant, a hotel, and shopping mall. Just take a walk through this beautiful complex and you will be amazed."
,,Stunning views,4.0,,"The skypark observation deck that is open to the general public could be better. The platform is fairly small, and they try to discourage people from staying too long by not having seating areas and there's very little choice when it comes to food and drink. In that sense, it's a slight disappointment.

That aside however, the views are stunning, and you get to see seemingly all of Singapore from up high. We were there during the day, and I suspect the view is even more spectacular at night.

It does get a little crowded, but despite this and my aforementioned caveats, it's definitely worth a visit when in Singapore!"
,,Not access all areas but views to die for,4.0,,"A few years ago you could not only go the end that sticks out but also walk behind and see (but not go in) the brilliant infinity pool. The pool area is now closed off to the general public. The views are incredible. We went while it went from day through dusk to night (7pm to 8pm) and it was magic. Don't forget, foreign pensioners get a small ($3) discount on the $23 admission charge."
,,Very underwhelming,1.0,,I disagree with all the great reviews and feel this was a waste of my time and my money. I can't believe I paid for an elevator ride to stand on a balcony. No seats and security moves along anyone that sits on the ground. I think the city views are amazing from the ground- no need to pay for the privilege. I was also disappointed I didn't read up on fact that I could have just gone to the bar for the same views for free. Bummer!!
,,Day tour,4.0,,The view from the Sky tower was superb. We can have the great view of the sea and Singapore. There is a cafe on top of the tower. It's good to visit in the early morning or in the late evening to have sun rise and sun set view.
,,The best views of Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to have nice views of Singapore, this is the place - sorry, Singapore Flyer -. You can walk seeing the city from above, spend the time you want and have nice pictures."
,,Sensational Sundowners,5.0,,A really special afternoon with my partner for my birthday. Such a great view from the top deck at Ku De Ta. Chilled lounge tunes and fantastic cocktails.
,,Walk around at night,5.0,,"Easy to reach by SMRT, and walk around at night, its safe and lots to see, beautiful light tree show"
,,Super Cool!,5.0,,To go to the top is worth the stay at the Marina Sands as visitors who are not hotel guests cannot use the restaurant or the park on top just the viewing station at one end. Still this is a fantastic piece of architect and well worth the money!
,,Clean Experience,4.0,,Its be a long while since i have traveled to Singapore and its my first visit to Marina Bay Sands. The Skypark was breezy clean and refreshing. I don't normally like concrete parks but i have to say this is not normal. Well done
,,Awesome,5.0,,The place is really awesome. The security too is good. The rooftop is the best part of this hotel. There is an infinity pool at the top floor of this hotel and a pub near it. The view here is awesome. Entire city can be seen from here.
,,Must Visit .....,5.0,,Costs 23 SGD per person . but really one should visit the skypark for a breathtaking view . PS : Only residents get access to Infinity pool . You can not even see the pool from the observatory .
,,Unforgettable and beautiful beyond words,5.0,,"This was just an unbelievable experience. Not very expensive, barely any queues, absolutely stunning views. We went up at sunset time and was one of the highlights of our trip. It's a must-do; doubt anyone will dislike the experience (with proper weather...!)"
,,Go on up!,5.0,,"The taxi driver in from the airport said this was a ""must see"" and he was right. Admission is $23 Singapore dollars, and the elevator whisks you up to the 57 floors in no time with no G forces felt. ""Spectacular"" probably does not adequately describe the view from the top, overlooking the city and harbour. They have signs in many languages pointing out places of interest seen from the gallery and a few more or a map would have been helpful. They take your photo on arrival and want $55 for it in a frame which we thought was a rip off but we talked him down to $25. Still expensive but a nice souvenir. There is also a restaurant and bar which appeared very crowded."
,,Very cool,5.0,,I recommend coming here just to look over Singapore. We were here when a storm was rolling in and it was very cool to see all the clouds coming at you before it hit the city
,,A must this restaurant.,5.0,,"The restaurant on the 57 floor is a must. Fantastic views over Singapore the restaurant serves haut cuisine English food and lunch is very reasonable. Afterwards you can walk around the ""deck"" to get a great panoramic view of Singapore. You may have to book lunch as it is very popular"
,,A must for Singapore,4.0,,This is a gorgeous hotel. Which has access for everyone. The skypark was worth the price as the views are fantastic.
,,Good experience,4.0,,"The entry to Skypark is from the Marina Hotel with a lot of shopping on the way. As you get to the top...the view of the entire city is amazing, the infitinty pool at the marina bay sands is simly awesome...it would be even better to stay at the hotel and get a dip in the infinity pool. The Skypark is big enough to take a good walk and spend good time around. There is a lounge/disc at the top with great nieche crowds and good music and food.

Overall, if you haven't been to any other tall building or not seen other city views this is a good experience."
,,Singapore Holiday,5.0,,"We made 2 trips at night and in the day both had its benefits, drinks are expensive but worth it just for the view, if you are brave you can go up for a quick look and dont buy a drink."
,,great hotel,4.0,,one of the best hotels in town and quite expensive too. you can visit the casino as it is just great. just make sure you follow dress code as it is not like any other casinos from las vegas. you can also go on rooftop and get a great view of the city.
,,amazing!,5.0,,This was an experience i will never forget and so glad i did! the views from up here are insane!! get the token photo!! it's worth it! This place is iconic and a must to tick off the bucket list
,,Iconic but Costly,4.0,,"The skypark is atop three towers and is shaped to be a curved ship. Access is on the 57th floor of tower 2. There is a charge for entry (payment downstairs). The canny traveller will enter the lift and wait for a guest of the hotel to press 57 (the hotel is so large that by the law of averages someone is bound to oblige). Once at the top entry to the skypark swimming pool is through guarded turnstiles. Ignore these and turn right into the restaurant. There is a walkway outside, the coffee and snacks are reasonably priced and the ambience is worth savouring. The view from the walkway around Singapore is stunning. The cost of a couple of coffees and an ice cream will be less than the admission price and well worth it."
,,Billion dollar views!,5.0,,"At a whopping 8 billion dollars to build; the Marina Bay Sands delivers stunning views from the observation deck, the chic bar and restaurant, and if you're a guest, from the edge of its stunning beautiful and world class infinity edge pool. All of which are perched 57 stories above downtown Singapore. As if the views weren't spectacular enough during the day, treat yourself to sundowners while the sunsets and the lights of Singapore turn on making skyline sparkle from every angle! The Sky Park is worth the cost a ticket, a cocktail, a tapas, and a few hours of your evening in Singapore."
,,Do visit the skypark at MBS,4.0,,"Do use the swimming pool if you are staying at MBS hotel. If you are not staying there, you could pay the entrance fees to visit the skypark on top of the hotel, giving you a nice scenery of Singapore CBD area."
,,A MUST VISIT!,5.0,,Everyone visiting Singapore should visit this world class architecture. If possible for an overnight or just the rooftop bar for some food and drinks.
,,Night Views,4.0,,"One of the tourist 'must see' sites. Take a drink in the bar at the top of the towers to see Singapore laid out below. Not cheap, but fun"
,,Spectacular Views,4.0,,"You can get a real sense of the south east corner of Singapore from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Fifty seven floors up, have a drink at the bow of the ""boat"", enjoy the view back over the city and then towards Indonesia, with numerous ships anchored offshore. Really is a must do in Singapore, drinks are not cheap mind you.

Have to say that the infinity pool reserved for hotel guests, while also spectacular was overcrowded and looked like a real bun-fight"
,,Excellent view from the top (57/F),5.0,,"The view from the top is fantastic. You can pay to go to the observation deck which costs around S$25. But we instead have a relaxing afternoon drink in one of the bars up there - e.g. Ce la Vie and enjoy the same view, highly recommended."
,,one of the most impressive architecture in singapore,5.0,,"if you have time, go there if you don't have the time, find the time either to the top for the bar, or the ac down below in the luxury mall with all you can imagine brandwise, upmarket or course"
,,Night View Of Singapore,5.0,,A perfect night view of Singapore. A single glance you can almost look the whole of Singapore. Please do come when the sky is dark then you will know what I mean.
,,Overpriced,2.0,,Very expensive and crowded. If it is a cloudy day don't bother. On a hot day there is no shade so along with the crowd it was very uncomfortable.
,,The infinity pool made everything worthwhile,3.0,,"Booked a 3D2N stay at MBS to celebrate my husband birthday during the March school holidays. I have heard so many bad things about this hotel from friends all over the world but I just wanted to give it try. So I set my expectations to low to begin with.
Well check in was terrible. Counter staff told us room wasn't ready just because she could not get hold of housekeeping. She made us wait for 45mins without explaining what went wrong. Check in time was 3pm and we waited till 345pm to get the keys.
Room service was prompt but the collection of food tray may take 6 hours.
Hotel made a boo-boo by forgetting to reserve a table at Mozza for us. My husband called to check at the hotel if a reservation was made. Instead of helping, the reservation desk at Mozza, Joanne, was so rude we decided not to eat there ever again no matter how good the food is. She was condescending and acted in the most inappropriate way for a service staff. Instead we decided to splurge $700 on a fantastic dinner at Imperial Treasure!
The hotel felt bad and apologized with a bottle of champagne, late check out, chocolates and cookies. Though the gesture was nice they again failed to deliver the items on the agreed time. We wasted 2 hours waiting for them. But we gave up complaining.
We tried Adrift for breakfast on the 2nd day morning. I recommend rise unless you can use the club55 members' restaurant.
We didn't go to the casino because our children were with us and we have been there countless times. Definitely prefer casino at RWS.
The sky park was fantastic. You can see the best parts of Singapore from this side. Just try not to be overly annoyed with the crowd. Dusk was simply beautiful!
We went to the pool after breakfast for 2 mornings. It's not the size or the view (nothing much over on this side except the CBD area, Merlin, floating platform, Fullerton hotel...) but simply being able to swim so high up! The sun was so strong but the water cool! Most importantly the children had the most fun time during our stay there. The pool guard and service staff were amazing. Don't ever lose your key card though. Pool is 1.2m deep the whole stretch but do watch your children because a child did drown there before. Floats are not allowed in the main pool except for life vests. Forget about the baby pool! It's too cold and pathetic. To me the infinity pool saved trip.
In the end, check out was smooth and the manager that help me was professional. He offered to give us a late check out the next time round because we didn't use on this time."
,,Really cool for drinks and really impressive architectural site from below!!,5.0,,Really cool for drinks and really impressive architectural site from below!! Truly creative surfboard or boat design offers stunning views of Singapore when getting a drink ... worth the cost.
,,"5 star price, 0 stars for service",3.0,,"It’s expensive to visit, but they still treat the paying customers badly. Once you join the queue for the elevator, you won’t be allowed to sit down until you return to ground level at the end of your visit. Even then, it’s quite a long walk before you see any seats.
The views are fantastic, and we really enjoyed watching Wonder Full from here, it’s awesome.
But management and staff have serious attitude problems towards their guests. Yes there are nice clean toilets, but you cannot sit down at all during your visit. At 67 I am in pain if I stand for an extended period so this is a major problem. In the end I had to sit on the decking, but the security guy ordered us to stand (sitting anywhere is not allowed for safety reasons). My wife strongly protested, and he did then give us a lot of help, but I suspect he broke the rules to do so.
I urge the manager to visit Ion Sky. It’s free, and yes they do provide ample seats. People use them, and do not abuse the facility.
Will we go back? Never! There are other places (often cheaper) with excellent views. Even so, now you are aware of the problem, if you are fit, you will enjoy the visit here. But do remember the length of your visit will be dictated by how long you can stand without resting."
,,awesome place for view,5.0,,A very interesting and must-go site for tourist. Here you can see a whole view of Singapore from above.
,,Do it when is not raining.,4.0,,Outstanding views over the Singapore from the top. However all depends on the weather. Rainy and windy day do not bother. Be prepared to pay twenty dollars each for beer.
,,Otherworldly,4.0,,"This place looks like a UFO from the ground, and when you go to the top, you do feel like you're on a spaceship. Only complaint is that there isn't a nice viewing platform up there. It'd be worth charging people a couple bucks to go up and have a look."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"If you go to the bar and by a drink, which is expensive but you still save the price of admission to the observatory deck. It is worth it to go during the day as well as a night."
,,you need to see this to believe it,5.0,,Another great experience awaits you when you come to the Skypark. Expensive drinks on the top floor but worth the experience.
,,very high and luxury,4.0,,it the hotel have many many floor and skypark will make you can see the view in singapore from high view
,,Worth it,5.0,,It cost money to get up there but you won't find a more spectacular view of Singapore. I just wish they would let you in to that infinity pool!
,,Average,3.0,,"Yes the views are amazing.
But... You are only allowed on one end so can't really get views of the whole city.
No where to sit, they obviously don't want you to stay long.
No access to the bar that is up there.
There is a small kiosk selling drinks and souvenirs.
Huge line up for the elevator going both up and down.
Would I recommend it? Probably not, I'm sure there are cheaper options for seeing the city, unless you just want to be able to say ""I went to the top of that building"" to family and friends."
,,A surreal experience,4.0,,"This hotel is visible from all over the city of Singapore and to go to the 76th floor and have a drink was amazing. Right next to the Infinity Pool (non guests not allowed to enter) but to see it all up front. Bought ourselves a drink each up there, quite the experience."
,,A Mus,5.0,,A must visit specially to the roof top.looks just too beautiful in the night. from the roof top one feels on top of the world
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,We went there with a tour guide the view was amazing it was rainy day but we enjoyed our time then there was a water show it was one of the best shows I ever see it
,,Underwhelmed by Skypark,1.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands charges somewhat more than a nominal sum for non guests to visit the Skypark. Don't bother...your visit is limited to the most forward section of the 'deck'. There's no shade, and it's devoid of anything of interest (even the view is limited, surprisingly). If it's on your bucket list better to make an event of it by making a table reservation in the restaurant. At least you get to the Skypark for free that way.
On the way in there is the obligatory photo-op. Be warned...two digital snaps are offered at S$100!!"
,,Engineering Marvel!!,5.0,,Try to be on top at night time to avoid dehydration and humidity which is pretty obvious in Singapore. Be patient because not everyone get chance to be at the top. If you like tall structures and not bored of watching Singapore over and over again...this will be exciting place to be.
,,Spectacualar Hotel...,5.0,,We didn't stay at this hotel but we did tour it. The property is huge and a wonderful experience. My only problem with this hotel is the location. It is far from everything so you are captive to their shopping mall without transportation.
,,Brilliant views,5.0,,"We really enjoyed going up to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for the views. Quite expensive, but worth it at least once in our lifetimes! My husband got in for S$20, being a senior (65 or over), for me it was S$23.
Gardens By the Bay look particularly good from up there."
,,Sands sky park.. name itself says everything!!,5.0,,Sands sky park... touch the sky and enjoy Singapore city's view... everytime its crowded... try to visit it in evening.. dont miss sunset from sands sky park.. not to get amazed if you are seeing hundreds of selfue sticks with young guys and girls along with couples.. must visit for tourist.. we enjoyed it in evening..we were guest of hotel for a night.. so it was accessible for guest for free of cost.. key card is must for all hotel guest to visit the park free of cost..lol... well nice one.. one can reach sands sky park from tower 2..different elevator is available for toriat who are not hotel guests...
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,This cost 22 dollars each to go to the top. The view was lovely. The only downside is you can only access the left area unless you pay a lot more.
,,great view from top,4.0,,"for 23 SGD the elevator in of the hotel towers takes you up on the 56 floor to have view not only on the SGP island, but also Malaysia.
Swimming pool acces on the roof is however only for hotel guests.Same applies for restaurant.
For visitors are the few souvenir stands selling drinks and souvenirs."
,,Great and interesting hotel with a nice view of Singapore,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands looks like a spaceship landed on top of three towers. The architecture and view also makes it interesting to stay at the hotel for a swim and a drink with nice lounge music playing in the background. The pool has people hanging out long after sunset. Best time to go to the pool would be shortly before sunset for those mandatory sunset photos from the pool. The skybar and nightclub could also we well worth a visit, and the food is good in the hotel, but pricy. Not the place to go if you are on a budget, but treat yourself to a visit if you can. The hotel room was great and with a great view. Best rooms are the 27 rooms. Better view. Only drawback except for price was the staff could be more friendly and helpful."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Can't be more awesome. Best swim in Singapore and if you are lucky there is fireworks over the bay Recommend the bar too but do bring your wallet
,,Amazing views,3.0,,"I guess it has to be done as this building does rather dominate the skyline.
The archiitecture of this building is amazing.
Go to the top and pay for a drink this way dont have to pay an entrance fee. Average cost of drinks around €25. Getting a seat with a view is difficult then when you do you end up with people standing in front of you taking photos of the infinity pool which is amazing but very busy. Not my idea of luxery if i was staying there. There are a lot of lovely seating areas with wonderful views all of which were empty but reserved for members only."
,,Lovely View for an afternoon walk.,5.0,,Nice view in every angle. It was an easy access to the Gardens. Will definitely come back... Don't forget your camera with you.
,,viewing platform,3.0,,great views but you only get to the basic viewing platform guests from the hotel can use the infinity pool and the restaurant it was still a great way to look out over Singapore's sky line
,,Visited with family specially my young son,4.0,,"Awesome view from skypark. Visited with my mother, my wife and son. Garden by the way look spectacular from top. Lane of skyscrapers containing top notch financial office building look beautiful at night. Great view altogether!!"
,,Good place to see complete Singapore,3.0,,Good place to see complete Singapore from single point. One can see skyscrapers and structures from 56th floor of this building. But the restaurant should be accessible to the tourists also not only to the hotel guests only.
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Uniquely placed 57 floors up, the pool is a must for everyone - it gets very busy so you have to be tolerant - given the unparalleled views over Singapore this has to be accommodated"
,,Stunning views!,5.0,,"We visited the Skybar after the light show in the evening. The atmosphere and the views were great. The drinks were a little pricey but not extortionate and worth the money for the experience. Although chips aren't on the bar menu, you can ask for them and you can enjoy a big bowl of delicious chips for about six pounds. The infinity pool is beautiful and although it is reserved for guests only, it's fun looking out over it. There is no charger for going up to the Skybar, unlike certain bars in The Shard. Definitely worth a visit!!"
,,Always Amazing!,5.0,,Stayed at the hotel so went to the Skypark daily. The pool is amazing and the atmosphere something you can't find anywhere else. Poolside service is good and the drinks and food tasty.
,,Worth the money for the view,4.0,,Cost a lot to get up there but it was worth it for the wonderful view of the bay and the city. Be aware that if it rains (which it does quite a lot in Singapore) they will make you leave. Seems short-sighted but there you are.
,,Stunning piece of architecture,4.0,,"Breathtaking from the ground or the Marina Bay Gardens. Quite an amazing feat, don't go if you suffer from vertigo!"
,,Great,4.0,,"Great place with amazing views of the building, the surrounding area is really nice and clean with lots to see. The hotel is truly amazing and it is the petronas towers of Singapore."
,,Amazing,4.0,,This is really amazing. Panoramic view from the deck and nearby places are quite photogenic. Must visit to complete the Singaporian treasure hunt :)
,,Its nothing but Wow!!!,5.0,,What an imagination to place a structure of a ship on the terrace... You will enter a different feeling and an excellent experience to view the poolside in Skypark...
,,"""THE"" Singapore Icon",4.0,,"This is a must-see during a visit to Singapore, as it is the most iconic building in the city with lots to offer. Literally a shopping mecca (every single designer brand you can think of), and the views are amazing. It does get a bit chaotic in certain areas, but you really can't leave Singapore without checking it out."
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,The best view of Singapore is here. Very fast lift up to the skypark-I think it's even less than 1 minute. Will surely go back.
,,Top view of the town,4.0,,"I've been there on the 57th floor of tower 1. There is sky restaurant, you can take nice view of the bay from here. It's very goooood view."
,,50th birthday trip,5.0,,Well what can I say about this place apart from spectacular. this was on my bucket list to visit. Done. We spent the afternoon at the rooftop bar (floor 57). Very windy but what a view. Wow. Was very expensive to drink there especially converting to SA Rands but worth every cent.
,,"Hot, not really worth it during the day",3.0,,"We visited the Sky deck on Sunday. Not too much of a cue, maybe 20 mins waiting for elevator both on way up and down. Deck is pretty small, yes it gives view to most of the town but comparing to Singapore flyer was much less enjoyable. Very hot due to the sun. Kids just wanted to get down as soon as we entered it so not really worth it during the day. Maybe more impressive and enjoyable during the evening when sun is down and it is not hot."
,,Good views,4.0,,"Good views but the crowds made it a very quick trip. We virtually got off the elevator, walked around, and back onto the elevator"
,,Beautiful but crowded,4.0,,"I visited the skypark on weekend. It was very crowded so finding a seats to park your bathrobes and belongings are very challenging.
Really a beautiful place, no wonder it is iconic. But because of that dont expect you are going to be able to swim at that place as people are busy taking pictures and selfies, some with selfie sticks.
It could be v hot and sunny so shades and/or hats are a must-hv.
They provided towels there."
,,Great view best at night,4.0,,"This is a unique building- 3 buildings with a building across the top of all reminiscent of a ship. It is one of the unique places you need to see when visiting Singapore. Ours was included in a night tour of Singapore($58), but if you are doing it alone, go to the bar one floor up and pay for an expensive drink as it is cheaper than paying the ticket to the observation level only. Night time is the best time to see as the Singapore skyline is lit up and if you go at the right time you can see the laser/light show either from above or after descending."
,,beautiful view,5.0,,"go after sun , you wull enjoy the lights of the Singapore city. it is situated at 50th floor and you will reach in less than a minute"
,,What A View,5.0,,Paid and took the elevator to Level 57 at about 7.30pm. Great time of the evening as it was still not fully dark and the lights of the city were coming on. Watched the Supertrees light show at 7.45pm. Stunning display of colour. Breathtaking views.
,,nice architecture,4.0,,lost money in the casino but hey. its gambling right. their bets are rather high compared to ho-chunk casino in dells where i frequent. not much choice for food
,,"A must do, yet overrated.",3.0,,"First of all what people need to know is that unless you are a guest at the Sands, you CANNOT go into the pool.
My experience was a long queue on everything. A line to pay for the ticket (23 dlls) a line to go up the elevators and finally a long line when wanting to go down.
It is a must do since the view from the Skypark is amazing. Recommended to go at night, the view is better and you won't melt from the heat. Up there you can find a small convenience and souvenir shop, prices obviously high."
,,Great view,5.0,,"We went to the bar at the top - which is free instead of paying for the viewing platform.

The bar is actually higher up than the viewing platform and a drink at the bar is the same as the ticket; highly recommend a trip to the bar to enjoy the views across Singapore"
,,Restricted Area,2.0,,In my opinion it is not worth the fee as the area that visitors to this Sky-park can access is very restricted. Only a very small section of the Roof area is open to general visitors and Guards are on hand to ensure you cannot go to other areas of the roof. Good views (was raining and foggy day we visited) but so many other attractions that are much better for view and value
,,The best place for night photos,5.0,,A bit pricey. I think it worth it more if you go on the evening because you can have a breathtaking view of the Singapore Skyline and the Bay! A lot of people go up in advance and occupy the good spots but after dark they shoot their pics and clear up. The ticket gives you unlimited time on the deck.
,,Unique building - sensational views,5.0,,"The title gives the two reasons to go, and either one of them is reason enough. There's really a full length ship 200 metres in the air - I was assured it was intended to be that way and the captain of the Costa Concordia was in no way involved.

The ship is equally brilliant to look at, or to look out from, at the amazing cityscape. Try and sneak a peak at the hotel infinity pool if you can (its off limits to non hotel guests, so you may have to play dumb if you get caught). Hands down the best swimming pool Ive ever seen.

Restaurant at the top is not cheap, but nor would one expect it to be. Food was very good but hobbit size portions leave you both broke and hungry.

In two visits to the sky deck, it rained once. Distance of vision was reduced, but still a magical experience watching the clouds close in over the city."
,,"Excellent food, breathtaking views",5.0,,"I've spent three days in Singapore and could not miss visiting the iconic Marina Bay Sands home. I was told that the rooftop pool area is for registered guests only, so I went to a restaurant at the ""aft"" of the ship. I've asked for a table on the terrace facing downtown Singapore, and should not take my eyes from the beautiful scenery. Since this was a lunch time, I did not have much to eat and ordered Malayan mojito and dumplings with minced pork, truffles and foie gras. It was delicious. So I suspect they have an excellent and creative chef, and other dishes would be equally great. The restaurant is on the expensive side, but the quality and views make it worth."
,,Night visit,5.0,,"We visited at night so we could see the lights of Singapore.Travelled up to the 55th floor,and out to the deck.Wow what a view,also the light of the ""trees"" in the marina bay Gardens are to be seen from here.Cost $22 PP,There is a restaraunt but you need to book,Close by is the Huge Wheel which has pods that hold 28 people and takes 32 mins to circle.
When you enter the 3 towers,look up and see the sculpture made from S S bars it is huge.Plenty of places to eat on the ground floor but due to its popularity I would assume you would need to book.Amazing place if you are interested in architecture and engineering you just have to visit.Even if you are not it is a place not to be missed."
,,I wouldn't bother,2.0,,Be prepared for a huge wait to come back down. I am not sure if this was a bad day and some lifts were out. However it was organised terribly. This hotel is made for the guests that have paid huge dollars to stay here. The sky park is simply a viewing tower that is over priced and a massive queue to get back down with only one lift being used. I would of rather gone to the top of another tall building in Singapore ( there are plenty ) to admire the view of the city.
,,Great views but limited access,4.0,,23.00 per person and only one end to view. It is an amazing view and would have been better if you could actually have had access to a bar or restaurant to further enjoy but it's all limited to hotel guests. You get the elevator up and walk around. Watch out for the photo booth at the bottom who has you photos done by the time you get up 56 floors but the photo is 35 or 50+ with folio.
,,Best views you can get...,5.0,,Amazing place breathtaking views. Visit around 5:30-6 pm in the evening so that you can enjoy the transition period from day to night and enjoy both views from 57th floor. Don't expect to see infinity pool as it is reserved only for hotel guests.
,,nice to look at but expensive,3.0,,"For those travelers who are frugal like me, the best way to explore this skypark is by pretending you checked in in Marina Bay hotel. By pretending I mean be confident. So you can access the place as if you live there."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"The ticket area was a little hard to find but friendly staff showed me the way. Overall a fantastic view of singapore nobody hurrying you just relax and enjoy the view, take photos chat to people. Too bad i was only there overnight."
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,"Must visit hotel. If you can afford it, it is bet in this category.
Excellent staff, ready to help and please
Food - great breakfast on 57 floor
Infinity pool - lifetime experience to take a dip on 57th floor, open pool.
Rooms - they upgraded me to Sands Bay. Simply fantastic. (2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, balcony, bar room etc.)... Cannot be better. Fitted with all modern stuff.

I frequently visit to Europe, U.S. And Asia - never had this experience."
,,A must visit but don't expect good service,3.0,,"We have watched the Marina Sands being constructed over the years and always promised ourselves we would stay at the hotel during a visit or at least go to the skypark for cocktails.

Finally we visited the bar before dinner at Spago and must say it is very impressive. However: it is very busy, service is well below the standard it should be. Despite the great views nobody should wait 30 minutes to order, particularly a the price levels charged.

As far as saying at the hotel, I do not think so. The hotel lobby has become such an attraction with hundreds of people taking selfies, families just sitting around doing nothing. It is just a trendy extension to the mall and not befitting for a hotel."
,,Worth spending money for a night and amazing infinite swimming pool,5.0,,Amazing Infinite swimming pool at 57th Floor. I recommend a night stay in this hotel if u go to singapore. Very good indian food available at the breakfast. Overall the experience at the hotel was amazing specially the feeling at roof top swimming pool.
,,Well worth the entrance fee.,5.0,,"A brilliant view of the city from the skypark. I spent a long time up there taking in the views of the coast, the gardens by the bay (see previous review) the marina and the city. The sheer height of the building meant you could see for miles. Just make sure you go on a sunny and clear day (don't forget the sunscreen through) oh and the Singapore slings help to cool you down if the breezes die down.
Don't worry if you are scared of heights. It looks terrifying but once up there it feels like you are on the deck of that ship sailing out to see. It's not scary at all."
,,Don't miss at night,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark offers a variety of choices: several restaurants, bars, terraces, clubs, skydeck, and the infinity pool (which I believe is reserved for hotel guests).

Each venue operates independently. Restaurants require anticipared reservations, but bars do not. There are cover charges after certain times so be sure to check their websites.

I went to ""CÉ LA VI Club Lounge"" on a Saturday evening with a friend. No reservation required. It has the most impressive view of Marina Bay and Singapore dowtown. The tropical breeze is perfect at night. We picked a bar table right at the edge of the terrace to enjoy the view, and ordered bar snacks which were quite good.

There was an interesting mix of people from all over the world, a nice atmosphere with great DJ music. There was a dancefloor too, but not crowded that day. The club is right next to the infinity pool, but we could not enter as we weren't hotel guests.

I would highly recommend not to miss this on your trip to Singapore."
,,A wonderful staycation,4.0,,"took my husband for the weekend to MBS and I have to say it was a special treat. The rooms are large and nice (I booked the city view, it is worth the additional money) and incl breakfast. As check in and check out time is not generous we asked for a extended check out and received it. The pool is a major attraction so on saturday afternoon it was a bit of a nightmare, totally overcrowded but still the view is stunning. Sunday morning was much better. The service up there was amazing, the crew is helpful with everything. After they learned my hubby had birthday everybody came and congratulated and we got a free drink. The mohijtos were wonderful, best cocktail on the list and the snack food is also very nice. If you buy the room with the breakfast and dine in, you will have the same problems as us, if you don't take the american or other fixed breakfast you need to pay the difference, not very friendly I have to say.
overall no complaints on the room but some of our towels had big wholes and were ripped, so this is not so nice for a 5 star hotel.
also take note that check in and check out can take really long, I felt like we were checking into a flight...that service needs some improvements. But overall it was a nice stay"
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,Having dinner on top floor is an experience to remember lifetime.the restaurant is not at the level of the view...but who cares?
,,amazing building,5.0,,This building can be seen from miles. Did not go in but best photo shots from Garden by the Bay. Amazing sight.
,,Views Wonderful,5.0,,"We booked to go to dinner the ambience in the restaurant was wonderful, service not so good, food was ok, but not worth the money, if it had been downstairs one would have not paid so much.

But the view was amazing, well worth a visit, but eat downstairs :) as overpriced for what it is."
,,Depressingly like a cruise liner (with a selfie site on the roof),2.0,,"Herded into the mammoth hall, lining up to check in, waiting while the bus load in front went through the formalities and the once in a not bad room, up to the roof filled with a million people in bathrobes for the obligatory swim and selfie in the infinity pool. I felt I was on a cross channel ferry or lost in a past it prime Las Vegas Casino."
,,Best 360 degree view of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark gives you magnificent view of Singapore. Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Skyline is visible from here.

I feel its better than the Singapore Flyer because you can spend as much time as you want here.

The disadvantage is that it gets crowded while you go back and there is a long queue for the lift, especially on weekends. So make sure you visit on weekdays."
,,Stopover,1.0,,"We decided to have a look at the sky park as we could see it from our hotel and we thought it would be a good vantage point to photograph the city . The price was $27 each and for that you got I think it was overpriced. Yes there is a good view of the city but that's it . There wasn't anywhere to sit down so if it's busy it can be a pain .
There is what I would call a very tacky souvenir and refreshment shop with high prices to complement hight of the sky deck . Considering this is supposed to be part of a first class hotel I found it disappointing.
To one side there is a flight of stairs that takes you up to a restaurant,but you can't get access to it . You have to go all the way back down to the lobby and then make a reservation . What a hassle . In my opinion it's a waste of money."
,,"Wow, oh wow",4.0,,"all I can really say here is one was going for the view, and the view I got in the extreme. we'll worth spending the time here, and what fabulous views of the Singapore sky line, definitely a must do visit."
,,See forever!,4.0,,Took a chance and just got a lift to the top floor. Finished up eating up there but didn't have to. The views are wonderful - especially the view to the sea with all the ships that wait there. Great views in all directions however. If nothing else you can watch the tourists splash around in the swimming pools that are up there. Surreal.
,,Good view,3.0,,"Awesome view, higher than Singapore Flyer, we thought there was a bar at the top but it is only for hotel guests. So quite expensive just for view. Don't think people need to do both this and the flyer."
,,Great view - but I wish we'd accessed it another way....,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a must for Singapore but at $23pp to get up to the observation deck, I wish we had put that ticket price towards lunch at Sky on 57 instead so we'd have had a great lunch with the views thrown in. Should have thought harder before going up! You can only just glimpse the amazing infinity pool from the observation deck - the pool is only open to hotel guests which they make very clear when you buy the ticket."
,,"FLYPARK, unmatched view from greatest architict",5.0,,"Having this park built up on three towers where you can see swimming pools, garden, restaurants and bar overlooking all Singapore from all sides. JUST LOVE IT."
,,"Great experience, fab building",4.0,,"Fab view from the top overlooking the wonders of Singapore and added bonus having a pint at the bar at the top floor, albeit a tad expensive but you pay for the experience. Loved it!"
,,The best place to see,5.0,,"The best place to see Singapore from top, especially at night time, u can see all Singapore, and nice bar too, so just go there and enjoy evening. Recommend for all hoo visit Singapore"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"The process of buying a ticket and travelling up to the viewing platform was efficient and well organised. Wonderful views and we watched sunset which was lovely.
Was a bit disappointed that we could not access the sit down bar area. You can buy a drink from a café but no where to sit except on the ground."
,,Great view,4.0,,"Well worth the time to visit, great views of Singapore. Gives you a good view of places to visit and not too crowded. Not much else to do up on top except view the surrounding area."
,,"Great view, must see if you're in Singapore",5.0,,"This was probably the highlight of the country/trip. It is VERY pricey, and tough to get on the rooftop pool area if you're not staying there. Best thing is to go up to the restaurant area for a drink/appi's but be prepared to spend over $100 for two drinks and one appi."
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,Expensive to go up for viewing the City.. The bar is good although the seating area is very restricted
,,"Great View, expensive for what it is.",2.0,,"S$23 per person, not cheap to go up in a lift and come down again.

It seems the viewing area is very much for the hoi polloi and the entrance is outside of the hotel, although you do exit into the very end of the extensive hotel lobby area. They take your photo in front a blank screen at the bottom of the lift and by the time you get to the top and step out they have printed off a large photo showing you in front of the hotel lit by day or night which they try to sell you at around £25 - we didn't buy, although it was a good pic.

You have access to the viewing deck only with the skypark ticket, great views from the top but nowhere to sit and take in the views and you cannot access the restaurant - for residents only - no doubt to keep your time up there limited, once you had bought a few trinkets from the gift shop up there, not ideal for those with limited mobility either.

Disappointing, because it is an amazing building, but perhaps easier to appreciate off it than on it, unless you are actually staying in the hotel and have full access to the roof top. Would I recommend it - not particularly, we had great views across the city from our hotel roof and from the cable car to Sentosa, which was rather more exciting."
,,A night view that still remains unmatched,5.0,,"I went to Marina Bay Sands Skypark in the summer of 2012, but the memories of it are still fresh. Many people may feel the 20$ you pay to go the top is not worth it, but in my opinion, it is more than worth it, especially on a clear evening with a lit up view of the Singapore Marina bay.
I had the fortune of witnessing a full moon light, seeing the entire bay beautifully shining. There was a light show on the showers which was lovely to watch from 58 floors above the ground.

Overall, it will remain a memory for the grave for me. I recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore"
,,WOW! That's all!!,5.0,,"What an amazing view! If you do one thing in Singapore, this should be it. The building itself is remarkable and imposing, but to find an observation deck that is readily available to the public, well that's the icing on the cake. Highly recommended, with 270 degree views from 57 floors up."
,,Great views on a clear day!,4.0,,"if you're lucky you get amazing views of SG and the bay. However, I would recommend heading over to the other side and visiting Flight bar - for $25.00 you get a view AND a cocktail. Well worth it. Very kind staff, too."
,,"Friendly staff, great location, soo many things to do. love all th type of decoration.",5.0,,"Friendly staff, great location, . lovely staff, great location, soo many things to do. love all the facilities.The room if very comfortable and clean."
,,A lot of money to walk around a deck and look at an ordinary view.,2.0,,"So, no mountains, no snow, no fabulous coastline. A small area to walk around at the end of the top of the "" cricket stumps"" that is this building. The building is extraordinary but the view is not."
,,A must for first time visitors,5.0,,Best you take the smooth elevator towards sunset and stay until after dark. Considering the splendid views and the free entry the slightly higher price for the drinks are a bargain.
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Very good views of all over Singapore, architecturally well designed and worth the visit. Marina Bay is a nice area and there are other interesting attractions close by."
,,Nice,3.0,,"Good Architectural and good for taking selfies. Great to see only on a good weather , it's very popular and there are always people Taking Selfies."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"It's an amazing view of the city, if a little pricey. But you get what you pay for! I would highly recommend it, the views were just incredible. (Photo is of the sky park not from the sky park!)"
,,Fabulous vies,4.0,,Best views in Singapore. Watch the dress code of a night men must wear long pants. But worth the visit fro an expensive cocktail a must do.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,"From the Skypark you get a fantastic view of Melbourn e. Harbor atea, downtown and Formula 1 racetrack"
,,Fantastic area,5.0,,"Had some nice beers with good friends at the very top - on The Boat. The sun was shining, the temperature around 30 degrees C, the view was stunning and the beer was cold and nice - but as expensive as in Norway.
All together a very nice area wortwhile visiting"
,,Beautiful views at sunset and in evenings,5.0,,"Why wouldn't you go here? It's an architectural wonder, it sits right on the edge of the sea and Singapore Marine Park and it's even an ""integrated entertainment resort"" - read - casino. I loved the views and it was great having some [overpriced] drinks on the deck watching the sun set and the city light up."
,,Awesome Hotel,4.0,,"World class hotel, no doubt. I love the room and definitely the Skypark. It was cool that I got upgraded to a suite too-- that was a nice treat for my parents since I booked it for their visit here in Singapore."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. The view is pretty good. The drinks are extremely expensive.
,,Very nice place,4.0,,The entire Marina Bay are is a must go place in Singapore. The night show with the lights is fantastic. The downside is the boardwalk which is quite dangerous to fall as the there no warning signs.
,,The only bad service in Singapore,1.0,,"Went to use this very expensive facility but as no clear instructions we arrived at the rooftop entrance to pay our admittance fees. Brusquely and embarrasingly told ""you can't come in, you have to pay on the ground floor"" OK I said but could my tired wife wait here while I go and get the tickets. ""No!"" was the answer. I said she only needed a chair to sit on till I get the tickets as she is feeling tired in the heat. ""Not my problem"" was the reply in front of other visitors. Needless to say we left the building. If the management feel this needs further action and want to contact me as to the exact time and person involved please feel free."
,,The best place to seeing Singapore view,5.0,,"Up the 55 floors within min 36 second, you can enjoy the view of Singapore. Open from 10 am - 10 pm. Better time is 6-8 pm. Place must go when you are in Singapore."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Great cocktails. Expensive. worth the view. Lots of pushy folks with cameras and the like, but still worth going."
,,City simbol !!!,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Park have no comparation with other architectural expresions. It's simple, amazing and beautiful from base to top. A human scale realization that combines refinement, sensibility and awesome scale."
,,Not too impressed,2.0,,"Not too impressed. I happened to be there on the day that the glass doors to the entrance of skylark were broken. Instead guests had to queue to go down the service elevator. Although staff did not communicate very well what was happening. Opening time was supposed to be 9:30 I got there on time and didn't get up till 10:30. Was not offered any discount on tickets which would be acceptable remuneration for the extended waiting time. Did not find staff to be friendly at all, perhaps they were not trained for such situations."
,,Great View,5.0,,Great place to meet friends for a drink. Lovely views and atmosphere. Downstairs in the reception is a bit of a scrum!
,,A Must Place to go when visit Singapore,4.0,,It’s a boat shape on top of the building with beautiful surroundings. Love the water park for the kids and the infinity pools atop three 55 storey towers...
,,Best view of singapore,5.0,,"Best place to watch singapore at night. Can see the gardens by the bay with the lights show going on and the flyer, helix bridge, merlion. Fabulous view."
,,What is not the like,5.0,,Oh dear god ! look at the building !! just go and have look and enjoy. have fun at the casino. Go window shopping ! Just go :)
,,Great view.,5.0,,Beautiful views of Singapore! Drinks are a bit pricey but that's to be expected. Remember to dress up a bit as men aren't allowed in wearing vest etc
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"My husband has nicknamed this ""The Cricket Stump"" as it looks like one from a distance! It costs S$23 for people under 65, but it is worth it for the view. The shopping mall is also amazing - you can go ice skating in the indoor ice rink or take a boat ride along the canal.."
,,VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"You can spend time on the Skypark in leisure, it is much better than the Flyer, you cannot go there on a Rainy Day, but you can see whole of Singapore from there and it is taller than the Flyer, very high and very open, refreshments available on the top, definitely a DO NOT MISS."
,,Wonderful and Amazing..,5.0,,"This is the best hotel in Singapore.. It's huge.. So many restaurants and cafes..so many places to see.. This property is having a beautiful Shopping Mall, and you can find all of the world's top and best brands showroom..
Hotel is having a beautiful Casino.. You can enjoy there.. The top floor of this hotel is having stunning views.. You can enjoy nightlife club parties here.. Overall a Must go place in Singapore."
,,Wanted to see the view. From there,3.0,,Interesting view but limited on facilities once you were up there. Difficult to find the way in and little information how to get there. Go to tower three and down the escalator. Pay to have limited access. They would do a lot better to open it up and let people eat and drink at leisure. Could do with seating on viewing level. People sitting on the floor
,,One time visit,4.0,,Great view form 57th Floor. You must experience at least once. You will have complete view of Singapore city. Visit this place in evening so that you can sit and relax.
,,Wow,4.0,,"Very impressive,although for some reason thought it would be bigger and taller.Still an amazing place"
,,Unbelievable views !,3.0,,"We went up to the ""Skypark"" on Valentines Day ! Get views on sunset but the only negative is that unless your a Marina Bay Hotel (have own viewing area) the viewing platform spots are very limited as everyone wants to see and really don't move for you, so rude !!"
,,A Destination in Itself,5.0,,"MBS, although expensive, is a destination in itself. One has to experience staying there at least once in a lifetime. The infinity pool is huge with an amazing view of the city skyline 57 levels above the ground.

You can't also beat the spectacular view of Singapore or the Gardens by the Bay right there in your own balcony or at the Skypark. Most of all, the 3-tower grand structure with its boat-shaped Skypark is a mathematical/engineering wonder in itself.

The Gardens by the Bay is just steps away from the hotel and MBS is a shopping mecca, complete with dining options. Did not try the Casino, but it's there if it's your fancy.

The downside, if you could call it, is its lack of personal touch from the front desk/concierge due to the long line of guests, either checking in or out. Express check out, though, was convenient. The lobby is also full of tourists.

Despite one con, I still rate it 5 stars since it's grand, clean, safe, and a great destination."
,,An amazing architectural experience.,5.0,,"You can see this building from pretty much most of the city. It's is one thing to be amazed at the construction from the outside and the 'ship' on the roof spanning two towers, but you must go inside. There is a multi - floored mall with designer outlets and a canal on where you can be taken on a boat ride. Stunning."
,,Wonderful view,5.0,,"At the start i was not so happy going there, but my husband insist... Now I am so thankful, so amazing, I have never seen such a great view to the city... All from 57 floor and you can stay there how long is prefferd or just sit there for a drink."
,,Great View admisting the Roof Top Pool,5.0,,"This is the famous property in Singapore feature the world's first Roof Top pool on 55th Floor offering amazing view. Although it is open to use only for the guests staying in the hotel which is very expensive, one can rather have a look at it by paying a fee of SGD30 (may change)."
,,Singapore at Night,5.0,,"You have to check weather condition before you plan to visit this place. It will not good if rainy day. And its must be in the night. The skypark is the place that could see 360 of Singapore at day or night. This is a very romantic place. My kids said so (lol) they plan to take their special friends here.
This place need a ticket that you can buy on your hotel or go show. Prepare your stamina ...to enjoy Singapore at night."
,,VERY MAGNIFICENT BUILDING,5.0,,"Three high buildings with a super fast elevator that get you to the highest floor in just seconds, the place of ship made that you can see the very beautiful seen of modern Singapore and enjoy watching the luxury pool at the roof of this sky cracker that you can think this pool ended at the horizon, it is the most beautiful view that I have ever seen,however only the guest of hotel can use this pool but the visiting this building is worth to go and I recommended to see this."
,,Magnificent view and elegant architecture,4.0,,"Don't buy a ticket to go up in the elevator. Instead take the express elevator up to sky on 57 and enjoy a cold beer at the bar. The views are magnificent and you don't pay a fee. If you chose to dine enjoy wonderful views, service and modern French / Singaporean cuisine from sky on 57. One of the top restaurants in Singapore. Chef Justin Queck is world renown . See separate review."
,,Really just another viewing platform,3.0,,"I can't get as excited as a number of other reviewers seem to have gotten over the Skypark. You get a good view, no doubt, but what is it with the rules?! Sheesh, let's not make it out to be more than it is."
,,sky park is a best panoramic views,4.0,,"good and wide panoramic views over there can see around singapore views and good scenic views, very fantastic and interested"
,,Great building on the skyline,5.0,,Great hotel which has 2800 rooms and the most amazing view on the top with a pool and even trees! You can even visit it whn not staying there
,,Incredible views!,5.0,,"I went up to the Skypark at night since it was cloudy during the day. There are incredible views of the bay, downtown and beyond. You can also choose to go to the Sky bar at night and enjoy the same views. Access to the infinity pool is restricted to hotel guests."
,,An Architecture Marvel,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is by all means an architecture marvel for its planning, layout and interiors. The top deck with another level to the infinity pool gives you a feeling which is inexplainable. be there to feel it."
,,It's awesome,5.0,,"Tower 3 is where u can go up on the observation deck. These a fee. Food prices are in high level.There's a casino on the B3 level. All the high end stores are there. On the lower level is the food court, the prices are low to moderate."
,,"Love the view, silly rules though!",4.0,,"What's not to like about a fab view?
This is the second time I have been up to Skypark so was savvy about needing to book online a couple of days ahead. What happened out for all the small print about dress code & children not allowed, dependent on the time of day you visit.
I was sight seeing with parents and a fruit juice arrived quickly but two cappuccinos were forgotten until,we asked about them - by this time the juice was almost finished. It was quiet - weekday about 4.30pm but a bit of rain meat seat covers were put out and bar shuts so inside bar was serving - hence drink delay I believe.
Stupid change in ruling means if you are not hotel guest you have to go back down I the lift to floor 56, to go up one floor to 57 to enter the bar, when you could just walk through a gate manned by a security person. Last time we went they checked our ticket and let us through but this time not - seemed bit ridiculous to me!
Views are undeniably fab though and make it a worthwhile trip, despite my grumbles. Do it, you won't be disappointed"
,,Fantastic hotel! Amazing place and the best view ever!!!!,5.0,,"We were impressed and my hands were shaking when we went up there first time!

It's unbelievable impressions and memories which we will never forget.
I wish everyone will come and will see it.
This view on Singapore is super wonderful!
It was my dream to go to this crazy and magnetic roof since they just opened Marina Bay Sands.

I can't describe my feelings, it's something what I will always remember and wish to come again and again. For sure I wish to live on this floor and look at the city center from the sky park :)))

Ticket costs 23 S$ (17$) but it worth it, it Worth it!!!! Not so much money and you will fall in love with such an amazing and special view.

From this roof you will see marleon park, beautiful skyscrapers, the biggest wheel, gardens by the bay and even Indonesian islands.
We went there at the afternoon, weather was great and we took very nice photos. You can come a little bit later and will stay there until evening and enjoy evening view as well.

Good luck;) Enjoy Singapore"
,,You get to see Singapore without this in view,3.0,,"Pay your S$10 get in the lift and up you go, good view of the city but very restricted access to what's on offer here, hotel guests get infinity pool and gardens, your 10 bucks gets you decked flooring stainless railings and mediocre services, best to visit around dusk when the city starts to light up. Best bit is that you can't see the dubious edifice this sits on when you're up here!"
,,Overated,2.0,,Lots of hye but once you getover the swiming pool on b the roof wit a view you reaise juat how overated this place is.
,,Cool Looking Place and is Cool Place,5.0,,This is awesome place at Awesome Location. I am very happy to visit this place. It have everything which is required for Tourist.
,,Good to see from Skypark,4.0,,"Came here with my wife in the evening and it was worth seeing the night view from the Skypark. It was quite full and the queue to come down was very long. They do try to make you to buy photos as souvenirs but we weren't interested. The view is quite nice but some hotels around Singapore has similar views from their higher rooms :) During the day, you can see the Marina Bay Sands hotel swimming pool which is not accessible by non-hotel residents."
,,Fancy Hotel,5.0,,It's another must in Singapore. Take the lift to 57th floor and admire amazing view. Drinks are also great!
,,Perfect spot for shopping or lunch,5.0,,What an awesome place. You can go all the way to the top and have lunch while enjoying the wonderful view. Or if you stay for longer you can enjoy one of the best shopping malls just across the trip.
,,Great evening...,5.0,,You can go to the top - the rooftop even if you are not staying at the hotel. You can just pay a visit. It is worth visiting the 57th floor - amazing views. Good place to catch up for drinks.
,,Nice and beautiful place.,5.0,,Went there with family to the top sky park. Took some photo with panaroma. Love it. Will visit again.
,,Have a drink on the 57th floor!,5.0,,Really s nice restaurant and bar on the 57th floor Tower 1. Great views of the harbor and city. Beautiful. You can still go here even if you are not a guest.
,,Great drinks,5.0,,"This is a great place to go for drinks. The Singapore slings are excellent, made fresh and actually less money than Raffles. Plus the view is spectacular. The hotel actually has an infinity pool on the top deck. Quite amazing."
,,Amazing views of the city,4.0,,This has amazing views of the city but there is no where to sit once your at the top unless you have a meal in the restaurant. Having no where to sit on a blistering hot sunny day with 2 elderly parents made the visit short and sweet ! Hope to do it again minus the 'old people' to enjoy better !
,,Awesome view,5.0,,A must visit to get great skyline view and rest of Singapore view from top. Best time around 6 pm to get best of both views. First day view and then the night view. Worth the money spent.
,,Lovely place,4.0,,Lovely place with a nice scenery overlooking the city skyline of Singapore. Clear unobstructed view of Marina bay and the city skyscrapers. Vibrant and full of energy.
,,you got to be kidding,1.0,,"The casino wants s$15 to get you up there. I am not about to pay that. The hotel itself is extremely nice and impressive. The food court has excellent food at a good price. The casino is big but so so. Don't bother to look for the skypark, unless you want to pay the fee."
,,"Good views, that is all",2.0,,"Good views from the top but nowhere to sit and take in the views, the restaurant and bar up there we found was only for hotel guests, but was very empty, would have liked to have sat a while with a drink and taken in the views. Basically have a look around and leave, disappointing."
,,Amazing hotel and view,5.0,,"Iconic hotel in Singapore, the views from the top is amazing, there a number of very nice restaurants in the shopping complex, along with extensive high end shopping"
,,You must visit the top!,5.0,,"Stepping into the future of this marvellous building can only really be appreciated if you visit the top floor - level 57. The full length infinity pool must be seen to be believed. Be sure to go up before dark and dine so you get th best of both day and night views.

I would highly recommend the milk fed veal for main if dining up there as it was simply delicious. Be sure your camera is charged for this visit."
,,Just awesome,5.0,,Best views you can get in Singapore esp at night time. We stayed in Marina Bay Sands so it was free for us but even if we didn't it's a must visit place.
,,Breathtaking views!,5.0,,"We went to the 56th floor of skypark. It is a must visit speacially in the evenings. You can see splendid views of the light show at Gardens by the bay, Light and laser show at Marina bay and other views of marina bay at night. So it is best that you reach the top by 7 pm."
,,Best view of Singapore at night,4.0,,never miss a visit to the skypark at night its worth it. we had a good drink and the best view of Singapore.
,,Always a Great View from the Top,4.0,,"I would recommend coming up here at various times of the day to experience the different beautiful sights of the business, cultural and entertainment districts from the top of Marina Bay Sands building."
,,Great views,3.0,,Great views but area open to public very restricted. A bit pricey for a trip in a lift. Singapore Flyer much better value. Souvenir photos also overpriced. Take your own photos. They will be more real.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Whilst perhaps a little on the pricey side to head to the top floor to see the views it's worth it. An architectural marvel
,,Awesome views!,5.0,,"The views from the skypark are fantastic! The elevator that takes y you up there is soooo quick, its great! From up there you get to see the best of singapore! I loved the sights and they also have information for you to read and know what you are looking it."
,,"Incredible building, wonderful views.",4.0,,"Just walking through the lobby areas of the three towers is amazing! Marvel at the bling! Appreciate the conspicuous wealth on show! Admire the shopping storage space in the Lamborghini parked outside- enough for the paper carrier from the Frei Wille store inside!
Seriously, switch off your cynicism of today's materialistic world and take the lift up to the viewing platform, 56 floors in just 40 seconds! The views are incredible, even on a rainy and cloudy day. The architecture of the building is just wonderful."
,,Great views,4.0,,"Well worth the visit to see the excellent views of the harbour, botanical gardens and downtown Singapore. You have views of the Ferris wheel and F1 track."
,,Breath breaking view from top of hotel,5.0,,This is a hotel. 3 tower are connected on top by using boat shape. Its a great peace of architecture and construction. If you are staying in this hotel then entry to top is free. But if not then 22 SGD is entry free. There is a swimming pool on top and full singapore view is available. Laser show is been done daily at 8:00 PM and 09:15 PM. It is very nice to see from top.
,,what a view,4.0,,"An unbelievable construction, after all who could conceive putting a boat on top of 3 55-storey towers?"
,,Bruce Pullman,5.0,,Definitely worth seeing. Inside the building is a unique architectural vision. You can visit the casino and donate some money of course. Next time to go to the rooftop and take in the spectacular views. You can pay the exorbitant fee or go to the restaurant side and take in the view and a few photos before a coffee.
,,Breath taking views of Singapore by night11,5.0,,I can't remember how much it cost. We were lifted to the 56th floor and from there the view at night is amazing.I would recommend to take a camera and you will not stop taking pictures it is just pure amazing!!
,,Breath taking architecture at the skypark,4.0,,The cantilever at the top is enough to take your breath away and the panoramic views of Singapore especially at sunset easily makes this a worthwhile attraction. Enjoying a drink though pricey at the amazing Infinity pool makes it worth the money. When the sun goes down and light come up Singapore almost looks like fairy land esp when you look onto the dark sea with ships in the harbour brightly lit.
,,Iconic sightseeing,5.0,,Stunning view of Singapore downtown from the highest rooftop pool in the world. One can get an access to the pool only upon check in though. Viewpoint access can be bought at the reception
,,Evening drinks,5.0,,"Amazing views! We went for a few cocktails and we're thrilled to gain free entry to the bar, we had expected to have to pay but it's free. The cocktails were priced around $28 per drink but they come with amazing views. It was raining the evening we went but it didn't stop us having fun as they had massive umbrellas as it's partially outdoor space."
,,Great view from the bar,5.0,,Great view from on top of the building. The drinks are expensive $20 for a beer. But the view is worth at least one drink.
,,Breezy and chilly Skypark,5.0,,Nice view at the top. Can be nauseating for some because of the height but still worth a try. Free for all staying at the hotel but quite pricey for walk ins. I tried it at night and the lights of Singapore is awesome. I must try it during the day as well.
,,AMAZING piece of architecture and views out of this world!,5.0,,"To this day, being on top of the Marina Bay Sands at sundown and seeing the panoramic views of Singapore from day and transition into night is one of the most amazing sights I've seen in my travels.

Please don't miss this if you are ever on this side of the globe!

A helpful tip - we decided to forego paying the $25 to just stand on the observation deck and went up a level (to where the restaurant/ bar is - right beside that AMAZING infinity pool). As long as you go up there and purchase a drink you can stand on the deck and get the same views! The drinks are pretty pricey, mind you, however if I'm planning to have a drink anyway I'd rather do that vs. having to pay $25 to stand on a deck.

I'd recommend to get there about 45 minutes before sun down to take some photos and take it in."
,,Tour,5.0,,You don't need to be a patron to visit the Marina Bay Sands Sky Hotel in order to see the great view from the top. You can even see the pool from a short distance away. You can't go into the pool area but you can see it. Got lots of great video and pictures!
,,Busy but worth a visit,5.0,,Gets very busy at peak times but the views are spectacular. There is an infinity pool but it is busy and too shallow to swim in so be prepared to lounge around... if you can find sunbeds.
,,WOW!,5.0,,Stayed with friends in Singapore who took us up to the sky park one evening and wow! Incredible! The drinks were so expensive but it's what I was expecting! It was beautiful.
,,Infinity pool,5.0,,"Inifinity pool is reason alone to stay at this jewel hotel. If you are one that never settles for nothing less than best, this hotel is clear choice for you. You won't be disappointed. Pro tip: if you can't afford, like me, to stay here for a week or so, book hotel for three days. It will be more than enough to get familiar with magnificient pool. First head to some other hotel and run around singapore attractions and then end your vacation here being happy."
,,Not my cup of tea,2.0,,"Okay I admit, I visited the sky park over the use by date that tripadvisor provides. Some time when they were still building the dam and stadium thingy. The view was dismal. Should be good now but I was contemplating suicide over coughing out an exorbitant amount of money to get some air. The tickets were ridiculously overpriced, I am sure they recovered the building cost from this alone. if you forgot to grab some cheap water from 7-11 when you are on the ground , it will literally cost you an arm and a leg to buy one on the sky. So, as a Singaporean I welcome all tourist to spend their hard earned dollar here but skip the skypark"
,,The best view over Singapore,5.0,,This was recommended to us by a member of staff at our hotel. It is fairly costly but the view you get is worthwhile. Unfortunately the cost of refreshments and souvenirs was costly which is a shame as the view is excellent.
,,Best Views of Singapore,5.0,,"You'll be able to experience some of the best views of the Singapore skyline from this park. While you're there, take a dip in the pool. It almost feels scary to swim until you reach the edge and realize there is a ledge below the pool. Go earlier in the morning, probably at 6, to enjoy the entire pool all to yourself. The sun rises behind you, when you're swimming in the pool."
,,Garden and Pool at the Top,3.0,,"This attraction provide us the Park and also the Pool at the top of this Building/Hotel. But to enter the skypark there are entrance ticket to take the elevator to the top, if i'm not mistaken is about 30SGD. A bit expensive, not so much things to enjoy just the view and the chance to take picture."
,,This place is very beautiful,4.0,,I really like the design. Just mesmerizing and it is super huge. Not easy to take a photo. You need to go far to take the overall building photo.
,,Nice View,4.0,,You will be able to have a nice view from the hotel terrasse. Any way the lift is little bit expensive.
,,"WOW, not thats a Hotel Casino",5.0,,"As much as I didn't want to support a Seldon Adelson hotel, I am glad to have sen it. Very well done and the rooftop views were amazing"
,,nice view of singapore from top,4.0,,The price could have been slightly less but worth it if you can spend some money to see the skyline of Singapore. A small food court above would have been good. .
,,New Singapore landmark,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel shaded the Singapore Merlion as a new city landmark. It's an outstanding structure in the middle of the Bay.
It's Skypark at the ship shape top is a place not to be missed. The views from up there are unbeatable. The entrance fee is pricey, but worth it.
Come around sunset for best impressions. When night falls and the entire city is lit up it becomes magical.
I've read here reviews saying not to pay the entrance fee, but to take a drink instead on a rooftop bar for the same views. DON'T DO that!!! The views from the rooftop bar are obstructed and not close to the building edge. The bar is in the middle of the rooftop plateau, so the views are far better from the Skypark itself."
,,Singapore Flyer VS Marina Bay Skypark,4.0,,"Singapore is a very expensive city. Standing next to one another its a difficult decision to climb the Marina Bay Skypark or to ride the Flyer. On the other hand it costs too much for both, specially if with family of 4.
Our choice was the Skypark. It is more centrally located, right in the middle of the Bay, and you can stay there as long as you like (while the flyer is 30 min) and you're always on top for the incredible Singapore views."
,,"WAAAAY over priced, and over rated",2.0,,Can't really do much - everything over-priced including the damn elevator ride. And they don't even allow you to see the world famous infinity pool (don't worry you're not missing much). Go to the Garden instead - better value.
,,Pictureque view of Singapore Bay and Gardens,5.0,,If you want a overall view of Singapore Bay and Gardens then do this. At the top you can have a coffee and snack and also get great pitctures
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"If you are not staying at the hotel you can still go to the top and enjoy the view .
You can either pay $25 to go op to the lookout point or you can go op to the bar and spend the money on a drink while still taken in the view."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The view from the Observation deck is stunning. You can see over the gardens by the bay towards the sea, as well as 270 degrees towards the city center.
As many other have pointed out, if you don’t want to pay the fee for the observation deck, you could also go to the bar for drinks and get almost exactly the same view.
However, the price level is above average in that bar..

I’ve been to the observation deck both in sunny and clear weather as well as in very cloudy weather and of course the view is better if it’s sunny but as long as it’s not fog or raining, the view is still great.

The view from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark would be one of those must see attractions in Singapore according to me so you should absolutely check it out!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"A must visit place. 57 stories up. See all of Singapore from one place. The views are unbelievable, from the city to the harbour. Amazing shopping centre below, casino and restaurants."
,,Expensive Fee,2.0,,"Sorry to say, if you would like to see MBS skypark, then definitely it's not worth the price. You only get to see and explore half of the deck."
,,Fantastic View.,5.0,,"Only went as it was one place my friends wanted to go. Hey Glad I went. Well worth the entrance fee. Even though it was only at one end of the hotel, the views were amazing."
,,As expected.. Expensive and restrictive,3.0,,Remember that this is part of the Sands hotel and casino.. So $$$$ when you get to the Skypark you cannot even go to buy a an over priced drink at the bar. Nice view but for the price! Think about it twice!
,,Nice view,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands ( MBS) is an attraction which can give a pretty Good view of the surrounding. However, the ticket is only valid for a small uncovered portion, therefore, must make sure it's not raining on the day。"
,,Memorable place to visit in a lifetime,5.0,,Enjoyed the rooftop restaurant along with my dad and one of the best memories of my life. I will come back again.
,,There are better ways to enjoy birds eye view of Marina Bay area,3.0,,"Instead of paying so many dollars to stand here, better yet take the Singapore flyer or have a drink at 1-Altitude.

It is located in Marina Bay resorts, and there are many other better ways to spend your time there.

But if you stay in the resort, you get to come up there for free, in that case make time to come up and please enjoy the view."
,,The place to visit.,5.0,,Go to Tower 3 and head for the sky bar. A spectacular view awaits you when you exit the lift. Have a lovely cocktail and mingle. Wish I could join you.
,,A must?,5.0,,"For me, yes this is a must do in Singapore. It provides a completely different perspective and view, one which I could have absorbed for longer and would repeat on a return visit.

Well worth a visit, just be prepared for how high you will be."
,,one place to finish your travel to Singapore,5.0,,you can not omit this part from your travel to Singapore. You should go on top to discover Singapore. it is completely fabulous. Do not miss it.
,,Spectacular views of Singapore,4.0,,I have to hand it to the developers and owners of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Making your property a tourist attraction as well as a hotel is clever. The cost of entry to the Skywalk is $28 but the views are stunning and worth it.
,,"Great Views, but you don't get the full experience if you aren't a hotel patron",3.0,,"If you aren't a hotel guest, all you get to pace along is a relatively small section of wooden deck, instead of the area with the famous infinity pool. Views are great though and its worth a go."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"Wow you really are very high up, it is a fabulous place to view Singapore and enjoy a coffee, cold drink , snacks or a meal. Staff are friendly and there are umbrellas to keep cool or often the rain off.
The place has a great relaxing ambiance and it really is a place to visit night or day. Just take the lift up to the 57 floor and be amazed."
,,"Very different, a little crazy and chaotic inside, but worth visiting",5.0,,"This is a casino; we hoped to visit the very top floor, where the infinity pool and bar are located. There were so many people at the bar, there was no where to sit, so we left. Try to visit earlier or much later in the afternoon, as 1-2PM seem to be a bit crowded."
,,The best - Always,5.0,,"This is my 4th revisit here, beautiful place with lots of shops and attractions around, ice skating at the food court area, waters show at evening and this time I made my proposal to my new fiancé at this place with some assist from marina bay staff...memorable experience for me and my partner..."
,,Top of the world,5.0,,Very luxury and majestic. Great architecture and amazing view from the roof top. Definitely worth visiting at sunset for the great view of the marina and Singapore!
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,This is must visit place in Singapore.this is a building with a ship on top.actually this is a hotel and a very good shopping mall beneath it .Beautiful view!! Laser show goes every evening
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"This was and amazing place to visit. So much to see and do. You need to check it out for sure, shopping, casino and a nightly light show."
,,Ship in the sky,4.0,,"This hotel is a must see during your trip to Singapore. Make sure you visit on a clear day. First I would recommend you take the river cruise from Clarkes Quay and you will see the Hotel, with its ship on top, spanning the 3 large towers from many different viewpoints. After your cruise go to the hotel. Go up in the lift to the viewing platform and bar (you will be on the ship) cost is 20 Singapores Dollers. Great place for photos of other city attractions including the theatres, the Grand Prix circuit, gardens below and many more. Finish your visit at the top with a drink in the bar and marvel at the huge swimming pool. Take a look around on the ground floor and see the large number of people checking in or out of the hotel then visit the large shopping mall with its designer outlets. If possible visit the hotel again after dark, go to the top and watch the light show in the park below (you will need to check the times). Arrive early to get the best position."
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,"In Singapore visit the Skypark. The gardens are beautiful, fantastic views from the skywalk. Very close to the city centre."
,,Visit at Sunset!,5.0,,"Though the entrance fee is a bit steep ($22 for adults), it's worth it for the great sunset views - as well as the following night-light ones. Once up there, you can buy yourself a drink from the bar, or just smoothies and soft-drinks from a small stand. They're not cheap though...!"
,,"Go to the restaurant, not to the skypark",4.0,,"When you do this, you save $20 pp, take a very expensive drink instead and enjoy the same view, though you can only walk around the restaurant area, not the entire skywalk, but to me, more than good enough. It is in tower 3, restaurant ce la vie."
,,View from heaven,4.0,,"After walking through the sea of people on the ground floor I was able to find the elevator to take me up to the top floor. If you are not a hotel guest it's kinda hard to
Enjoy the view completely because you can only go so far before there's a barrier. Even so you can still take some wonderful pictures."
,,A must see,5.0,,The hotel is a very busy hotel down in the lobby it's hundred of people walking through every minute. They also offer tours to visit the skypark on the top. Really great day.
,,a view of the red dot,4.0,,Most well view on a sunny day better than cloudy day to get clear view around. ..we were lunching at Ce La Vi restaurant and view is a bit restricted within restaurant area...not allowed onto the observation deck...whatva shame. .tickets needed even though you are a guests. ....
,,An offered titbit to the hoypolyy,3.0,,"The urge to go and experience this is huge. Entry is $20 SD each ( over 60) $23 if not. We were met at the bottom before going up the lift for a photo by a photographer. We refused but was told everyone had to have one done. As we stepped out of the lift, we were shown the photograph mounted inI a "" souvenir folder"". It was a rubbish photo and they asked for $ 60 SD for it. We refused..naturally and we were questioned why we didn't want it. Firstly, we didn't want one taken and secondly the cost was outrageous. We were told we could just have the photo without the souvenir folder for $38SD..again we refused, much to the dismay of the staff.
The amount of access allowed at the top is very limited.. Our suggestion is ' don't bother'"
,,great View,5.0,,This is a must in singapore!!! nobody should visit Singapore without having a drink or Dinner at one of the places on the top floor.
,,Awesome 5 star experience,5.0,,Beautiful hotel. I have stayed here twice in two different types of rooms. I do recommend the club suite which allows access to the complimentary cocktails and canapes each day. Pool is amazing and Ku De Ta restaurant was also fantastic. Expensive but worth it.
,,Fantastic views for free,4.0,,"If you just want to go to the top for the view and a drink, take the free lift to floor 57 at the far end of the foyer from the main entrance, currently signposted Ce La Vie (used to be called Ku De Ta). If it has been raining or is about to rain, the outdoor bar will be closed but you can still take photos. Drinks are not cheap. Paid S$20 for medium Hoegarden."
,,"Decent views, needs better facilities",3.0,,"23 Singapore dollars to the top. Can spend much more on the photos taken - beware. Obviously very good view, but keep an eye on the clouds rolling in as can soon get a soaking. There is a kiosk and souvenir shop there but public not allowed in to cafe/restaurant (part of the hotel apparently). If you are happy with just the view in the open air, then go for it."
,,Spectacular Views,5.0,,"Such a shame you can't get close to the infinity pool as that is only available to Hotel Guests. having said that you get an awesome view from the roof of the Marina Bay, and all the ships waiting to offload their goods in Singapore."
,,Sky high price for a Sky High View,2.0,,Surprised to find virtually zero facilities available on the deck area. There is no seating available and it is forbidden to sit on the steps. The views indeed are incredible but we left feeling that we had been ripped off in full view of the hotel guests who were gawping from the pool area. As for the hotel complex the entrance foyer/check in area was very reminiscent of a Disney hotel.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"You can see the city from the top. It was loaded with everything. Pool, restaurant, pub, gym, sightseeing area. Worth visiting."
,,Truly Amazing.,5.0,,"Thi is a must visit building,it cost $20 Singapore to visit,don't be fooled to think the snapshot of you entering is free,when you can take your own self or companion snapshots,once up the top you can savour the view late evening best if you are well dressed you might be allowed to get into the roof top bar and enjoy"
,,"Great Views, but not much else",3.0,,"Came by for $23 each and restricted to the east(?) end of the facility; no pool to see, restaurant closed, thought it would be open for brunch (11am), shop wasn't much chop either. They did take a good photo and superimpose the building behind us and not too much (I thought) at $65 including an email soft copy.

Good views but very murky. Need to pick your day a little better.

Note that it is 56 stories and about 280 metres up. Your ears pop going up and down."
,,Top view,5.0,,"As a guest of the hotel, access is free at the rooftop and swimming pool,
also the nightclub : ce la vi before 10pm.
the view of Singapore is just fantastic daytime and nightime:
57 floors !
certainly the best one
all downtown singapore, the merlion and all marina bay including garden by the bay."
,,Celebrate my Wedding Anni,4.0,,"Really good view from the top. Nice location. The infinity pool was awesome whether it was morning or night, me and my family had a good time and stay MBS hotel. but only one sad part was the bed was too soft that we had bad body aches."
,,NOT A SINGLE CHAIR TO BE SEEN,2.0,,"Very poor , no chairs whatsoever and drinks very expensive . This was a small cramped area . It was obvious that staff were instructed to get people in and out as quickly as possible . Avoid at all costs ."
,,Lovely view!,5.0,,"The view from above is amazing! We went during the night, because in my opinion Singapore is a city that blooms at night. I definitely recommend this!"
,,Worth going up just for the views,3.0,,Great views but a bit naff that they don't tell you if you want to use the restaurant you don't need to pay. Mildly annoying that when at the top they told us to go down and come up a different way to eat instead of letting us through a simple barrier. Needless to say we didn't bother and wend elsewhere.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Either pay for going up and walking around the top level, or go to the restaurant and have a drink without paying entry fee. The 2 areas are separate and the area you pay for is much larger. Bar area is relatively small but gives you an impression and picture of the amazing views from the top. Must be amazing at night, overlooking the business district with all the lights. The pool up there is impressive, but only for hotel guests."
,,Amazing views from the top,4.0,,"The third block has a fast lift to whisk you to the 57th floor at no cost, provided you intend to have a drink at the bar. Amazing views over the financial area of the city below - a monument to overt capitalism. There is also a good restaurant albeit somewhat pricey. The open air swimming pool over the top of the central block is for hotel guests or club members. Hold onto your phone if trying to take photos as quite windy."
,,Great views of the city,4.0,,Hands down this has the best views in Singapore. Note you do not want to go up on a rainy/windy day. Our whole family enjoyed this attraction (young and old).
,,City View of Singapore,3.0,,Great place to see the city view and most recommended during night so you can enjoy the lights from the buildings.
,,THE VIEW FROM THE TOP IS AMAZING,4.0,,"It is an amazing view from the top, but be warned that only a small portion of the top you are allowed to visit. There is a restaurant on the top but it is only for customers staying at the hotel. suggest ion take the Singapore Flyer instead."
,,The Views!,5.0,,"Ok, isn't this why you wanted to stay here...YES! This is the point of the hotel. Great views, a pool with a view, bars, great food a service from all."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Went up at night to see the city lit up, spectacular. We timed it to see the gardens light show again! There is no shelter so if it rains they wont let you up."
,,A marvellous experience,5.0,,"A must to see place in Singapore, only thing it is bit expensive. Took some nice pictures of the City."
,,Spectacular view of the city!,5.0,,"This venue gets really crowded on weekends, and especially evenings. The Skypark is located on the 56th floor, and 3 express elevators take you up without stopping. It's a bit unnerving if when you get to the top, you think about the fact you are standing on an overhang of the ""ship"" with nothing below you. Really fun place to visit, but not cheap."
,,Impressed,5.0,,"We stayed in a club room and enjoyed the club lounge which was great, nice array of canapés and plenty of champagne. The only downfall is the club lounge is not as comfortable as other five star hotels. The sands club is more of a restaurant rather than a lounge"
,,Great spot...What a view..... have a cocktail and admire the wonderful view,4.0,,"Went to this place after afternoon tea, and had a great view all around. Couldn't sit down unless you were dining...so on the 57th floor get yourself a cocktail, dress appropriately, enjoy a chat and admire the view. Unfortunately no seats which was a bit of a bummer, especially when your feet are killing you. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Awesome View,4.0,,The skypark along with the singapore flyer is an awesome place to have a look at singapore from up top. The food available on the skypark is quite decent and gives you an awesome view of the bay area.
,,"Breathtaking view, lunch option is great value",5.0,,"We were advised to go at lunch - only slightly more expensive than just going for the view and the restaurant was great with a delicious, modern menu. The view over the city and the bay are amazing."
,,wow,5.0,,this was fantastic they charge 20 dollars per head to visit but if yo go to hotel and go to 57th floor you can view for nothing and have a drink in the cest la vie bar and catch the ambience and views wow wow wow
,,This was very attractive palace,5.0,,Really it is amazing and intersted palace to visit with you loved one i strongly recommended it for all loving person to visit this palace and mbs shopping mall and water fountain around its center wao great
,,What a nice experience,5.0,,"I went to Singapore for a business meeting and eventually have some extra time in the evening and decided to go up to the Skypark, Marina Bay Sand. Cost around SGD23. Reached the top around 6.45pm so manage to experience the day view and night view of Singapore. Very windy and a very nice ambiance at the top. If you come with couple it will be very romantic. A must visit place if you come to Singapore. You can also enjoy the laser, light and fountain show at 8.00 from the top view."
,,Excellent experience,5.0,,"A ""must do"" whilst in Singapore. Cocktails on the 57th Floor Bar, inside the bent boat shaped building on top of the 3 towers. Not only are the views amazing, especially on a dark evening, but the cocktails are strong and flavourful too."
,,See all of Singapore in one go.,4.0,,"After being shot up the 65 floors in not many seconds and you ears popping twice the view is to die for. Yes it's quiet expensive, but if you can ; do it. You will see what it's all about,that's Singapore. The view goes for miles and the sensation is that you are just floating over the city. The pool area is now closed of for visitors ,guests only, but this does not distract from the experience. After this visit the gardens and domes at the bay below most of this is free."
,,SUNSET VISIT,4.0,,"We visited Marina Bay Sand Skypark at sunset and were delighted - while it was initially a walk to find from the station, the walk was well rewarded with the most beautiful sunset. Note that the bar area is limited with to licensing laws with age restrictions. Beautiful views and get place for a photograph followed by a drink."
,,Wonderful hotel.,5.0,,Can't fault this iconic hotel. The hotel is outstanding in everything it does. We received a complimentary upgrade upon check in and given extended check out after explaining that our transfer to changi airport was after 5pm. The infinity pool is just amazing. The views breathtaking from the balcony and the rooms fantastic. Thank you Marina Bay Sands for a truly memorable stay.
,,Bring your camera and enjoy the experience,5.0,,"I was fortunate enough to stay at the Marina Bay Sands previously and to enjoy the Sky Park as a guest. This time around, I paid to revisit the park on a free evening. Whilst there are limitations on where you can go within the Sky Park as a visitor it is well worth seeing the horizon pool and bar area if only for the view and the experience of saying you've been there. Price is perhaps a little much but when you consider that places like Sydney Tower are the same price, it is not too bad. Besides combine this with the Singapore Eye/Wheel and you've managed to grab a good slice of the Singapore skyline."
,,Amazimg,5.0,,U can see the whole city Visit this at night as it is more fancy You can have a dinner only if you are a hotel gust
,,Worthwhioe,5.0,,While you can no longer walk by the pool it is worth the $20 to get up here. Great views at dusk when the island and ship lights are coming on. You can stay as long as you like. Beats the big wheel.
,,Honeymoon,5.0,,Well worth a visit . Ensure you visit all and take your time. Shops are expensive. There are a few shops that I could afford but be aware of gst tax. You can claim this back at the airport. Had a Brussels sprout pizza which was a novelty. Wolfgang puck well worth a visit and the theatre
,,Amazing views worth the trip,5.0,,It is a must to go at least for a sunset aperitive on top of this stunning platform that looks like a surf ....you feel like surfing on top of Singapour .Best to go around 7 pm and wait till 8 pm when the lights of the flowers in Garden by the sea starts to play with music and create a real spectacle.
,,A normal View.,1.0,,This is not a surprising place....full of glasses that prevent take photos...... expensive for what you see.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"An experience that although a little pricey, must be done. Wonderful views, good restaurant (but always busy, need to book) an the infinity pool is fabulous"
,,Fanastic,5.0,,"Stayed at the hotel, while in Singapore just so we could get access to the Skypark and Pool, and it was well worth it!!!"
,,Superb views,3.0,,We chose a bad day - heavy wind and rain. We had to evacuate the outside bar area. Didn't try the food but the drinks were expensive
,,"Go to the bar, it's better",5.0,,"Came with a Singapore local, top tip is to go to the bar instead of paying for a viewing platform ticket. The bar has free entry, but drinks are very expensive as can be expected.
A view without the wire barriers unlike the observation deck. You just have to put up with the drunk trashy tourists at the bar in the background."
,,The view is amazing !,4.0,,"The view is spectacular and it really puts Singapore in perspective ... however, once up there , apart from the view and buying very overpriced drinks/ food there is nothing else to do. No place to sit and have the snack - so it is really designed to get people in and out..... I am not a Wheel fan, however if I had children with me I probably would do the wheel insetad of the sky park."
,,Cool,5.0,,"I dont go to the top of marina bay sands because it was already 10pm after we took late dinner.
Ticket price is $23 to go to the top of marina bay sands.
We spent our time at the mall esp the food court. So many kind of food there. Indonesian, indian, thai, chinese, and also singaporean."
,,Don't expect too much...,3.0,,"- the place that you will visit as an outsider is not that big, only the ""tip"" of the ship;
- the view is indeed great but you can have great views from other places in the area as well
- full of expensive souvenirs

Do not see the point of this. This is a multi-billion investment and somehow they are trying to make more and more money. Also to note that the investor is a company from Las Vegas. We, as visitors, go there because this is a ""must"" but leave somehow not satisfied and waiting for those elevators forever.
The people that stay there should be annoyed by so many people visiting for a few hours and they are to be understood.
Looks like a bad compromise..."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,The views are amazing but not 360 degrees. Buy your ticket downstairs under tower 3 (nearest to the Helix bridge). Then you are shown into the lift to 57th floor. There you are allowed to walk around the 60 foot overhang part of Marina Bay Sands although you are not allowed to go near the infinity pool or into the restaurant area. The ticket cost around 23 Singapore dollars each. You don't need long but you can get some great photos of the surrounding area even though it's generally hazy.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We are glad we visited the Skypark. The views are amazing. A very nice restaurant /bar at the top. The virtual pool is only available for hotel residents
,,fantastic,5.0,,the cost of the ticket for going upstair is 23 singapore dollars but the view and its experience deserve that even if you won't be able to see the pool (as it is only dedicated to the hotel guest)
,,Why bother to pay?!,5.0,,"A stunning view but if you walk into hotel and take lift to 57th floor, you can walk into bar and buy a drink on the floor immediately above the observation deck and see 90 per cent of what you pay to see on the level below."
,,Staycation,4.0,,"experience at the skyparks was great as you can overlook Singapore CBD area. It will be a better view if you can get into the pool during evening time to see the another view of the singapore especially the transition from evening to night. But please be there early, if you want to get the good seat."
,,A must,5.0,,"The best view in Singapore on the best architectural marvel in the city,can't beat this hotel,you must see it and go there if you can stay there even for one night even better!"
,,Awesome Hotel,5.0,,The place was spellbounding! So huge with three towers. One is dwarfed with large structures when you look up from the lobby. At night we were treated to dancing lights.
,,Great views,4.0,,We went at night and the view was incredible. Plan for a very long wait to take the elevators back down. Fyi - the skypark pass doesn't allow you to see the infinity pool. Checkout Rise Restaurant in Marina Bay Sands before or after you visit the skypark.
,,Flight 57,5.0,,"What a great view to chil out and have a great cocktails, tailored to your taste (just ask Michael to mix some for you), it was great!
Great view over the whole Bay from the 57th floor! Who could ask for more, go give it a try!"
,,Breathaking Singapore views from MBS Skypark,5.0,,Simply the best views of Singapore from up here. Why we haven't done it before is mysterfying ut we have now and highly recommend to everyone else? The Singapore Flyer is good but this is better. Great pics.
,,Not as awesome as I expected,3.0,,"The area for the public is quite small and doesn't go all the way around. The infinity pool and most of the rest of the rooftop is only accessible to hotel guests. The view was spectacular, but the light was poor and it was a little hazy. Great views of the city and nearby areas, but not much beyond that. Could not see Sentosa, for example.

The cost is a little high, $S23 for the ride up. The ticket office opens at 9:30AM, which I found out only after I arrived an hour earlier hoping for the morning sunlight. There were a couple of large tour groups with prepaid tickets who went up first. The ticket line was short, but the staff seemed to be extremely slow in processing the tickets. By the time I got my ticket, the tour groups had gone up, so there wasn't much of a wait for an elevator. A nice touch would have been glass elevators, but no such luck. Before getting on the elevator, you can have a souvenir picture taken. I chose not to. At the top, you walk out onto the sky deck. It is protected by glass walls at the bottom and sturdy metal cables and glass higher up. I never had a feeling of danger. There are a couple of cafes up there, but not much else.

As I said, it does not offer complete 360 degree viewing but you can get pretty close. Most of the obscured view is of the western side of the island. I spent about 15 - 20 minutes up there and took a few pictures. That was about all you need. There are diagrams along the railings detailing what is in the view.

It is probably spectacular at night and if I am in Singapore again, I will definitely plan a night visit."
,,View the world,5.0,,It's a must to enjoy that amazing view over the city. Go directly in tower 2 downstair to the counterdesk ca.25$
,,Use the bar and save money,4.0,,"Visited the Marina Bay Hotel on a 4 day trip.

We read a review that recommended going up to the bar instead of the observation deck. This was free to go to and had a great view over the city.
while there we had a Singapore Sling that was really good."
,,Great views,4.0,,We were advised not to pay to go up for the view but just to go to the bar area for drinks and I have to say the view was brilliant and as night fell even better to see the city lit up. Drinks were a little pricey but the view made up for it.
,,Swimming pool in sky,5.0,,Observation Deck on 57 floor . Stunning view from the top. Visit before sunsets change color of sky is must watch. See the Singapore in Day light as well as night lights. timings from 9:30 to 7pm
,,The place to get a good view of the city,5.0,,We paid 20 Singapore Dollars each and the views are truly magnificent. There is a bar up there and a shop for postcards and souvenirs. Well worth the money.
,,must visit Marina Sands Skypark Observation Deck,4.0,,"it is value for money . should visit this place.
Price for this in Jan'16 was SGD 23 per person.
One should spend time here from 6 pm to 8 pm
Take Umbrella as a precaution.
Evening Darkness comes late in Singapore around by 7pm -7.30pm"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"I went to the skypark even though I am very bad with heights.
I must say the views are incredible and you can see all over the city.
I must admit I was so happy to come back down in the lift and get my feet back on the ground."
,,Feels Awesome,5.0,,"They have a entry ticket of approx 20 SGD, they have discount for senior citizens and children. Coffee shop is the only option available."
,,"If you don't want to eat, DO THIS",4.0,,"At SGD23 per head, this sounds expensive, but the views of Singapore, the Marina Bay Gardens, the harbour and the growing financial district are spectacular. You cannot get sight of the famous 57th story infinity pool from this vantage point.

They took souvenir photo as we checked in against a ""green screen"", but for some reason developed the shot against a night backdrop of Singapore even though we were there at midday!

If you have a reservation at Ce La Vie, you do not need to buy a ticket for the Skypark, but at certain times of day, there is a minimum spend in that restaurant."
,,Intersting,5.0,,Stopped or a cool drink in the lobby of the first tower on our way to the gardens in the marina. Took the lift to the 57th floor where the restaurant is and were able to take photos of the whole area
,,Great Views,3.0,,"Other than the truly spectacular views from the top ( or gawking at the rich and famous in the hotel's private Infinity pool ) there's not a lot else . Glad I went , just to say I'd been . But once is enough to satisfy my curiosity ."
,,Fantastic vantage point to see Singapore,4.0,,Ours was a short visit but I'll certainly return. It is an amazing structure which the locals like visiting as much as the tourists. Can't wait to go back to spend more time exporing it.
,,Wow wow wow,5.0,,"Just fabulous. Service is A+ scenery is A+ food is A+ i cant fault it. There is good security and everyone treats you well. Check in was a little slow but it is really busy and we came and stayed just before Chinese new year started so I cant really complain. The views of the city are breathtaking you just have to go, save a bit extra so you can."
,,Great attraction but.....,4.0,,"This was a pleasant experience.

-The views are impressive (not 360 degrees though).

- Poor customer service throughout the attraction.

- No access to pools/gardens which are only for hotel guests.

- Access is limited to a small area and a gift shop.

- Very limited sheltering in case of a downpour.

- A discount is available if you simultaneously purchase access to the Museum of Science (unfortunately the cashier did not inform us and we missed out on the $10 discount per person)."
,,Too crowded hard to access,3.0,,"Hotel was great, now too popular with Chinese house guests and visitors so prices have ramped up too much and it's now all about them making money. The roof pool is great but for guests only, to visit get in the queue loser. We no longer stay there but it's a nice place albeit nowhere near the shopping districts"
,,MARINA BAY SANDS,5.0,,The skyparks offers the best view of the city .. its coastline and skyline.. Its simply breaktaking.
,,Unique Building and Spectacular View,5.0,,"You really can't miss this if you visit Singapore. This building is probably the most incredible I've ever seen. The views from the top are incredible, especially at night. Don't miss this."
,,Rip off,2.0,,Expensive just to go up to the sky park. Had done the flyer so had seen an aerial view of Singapore. Should be free to go up if you buy a drink in the bar.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Fabulous views with no queues but expensive souvenir photos which we didn't bother with.

The hotel lobby is quite a sight and worth strolling through before going up to the top, but as with every hotel in Singapore make sure you check the price before you order any drinks or snacks."
,,Its quite expensive but worth the visit!,4.0,,"Its quite expensive but worth the visit! You get a great 360o view from highest building in Singapore. But if you are on a budget not recommend because it is quite expensive, once you get up you only have the view."
,,Night view,4.0,,Nice view at night. Easy access by mrt bay front station. Suitable for all age groups. Other attractions are very close to this.
,,just great,5.0,,It's the most amaizing place for the city view. If you go to Singapore it's the most representative place for a city panorama.
,,Great view,4.0,,Taking the express elevator to the observation deck and viewing the entire area from one vantage point was great. It is especially nice during sunset
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,It was a thrilling experience as you can see for miles around you when you go here. There is a very large swimming pool and a very nice Bar here.
,,Magnificent building,5.0,,Well worth the time to go to the top of the Marina Tower for lunch or a cocktail. It's a beautiful view and amazing to see the pool at the top!
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,Locate near Marina Bay Station also can reach from Bayfront Stasion its famous landscape which Marina Bay Sand Hotel lie. Gorgeous lanscape
,,Great,5.0,,"You will see it every time you come out of your hotel... its impressive...nice food court at the basement... and we enjoyed the free light show... but it did not wow me... you will see it from every other attractions such as: esplanade, merlion park, gardens by the bay, or flyer"
,,great view,5.0,,"Went up here at night as part of a tour and it was great. Could see so much, overlooks Singapore Flyer and Gardens by the Bay. Great space for walking around, elevator was very quick"
,,Disappointed place,1.0,,"This place is highly over rated. Although the view is beautiful the Service is really bad. Not much selection of appetizers if you are going just for drinks. And no place to sit if you are just having drinks, which means you can't stay there for long. Dinner and drinks are very highly priced."
,,Fantastic Views,5.0,,This must give the best views of Singapore of all locations. Great photo opportunities and a good location to enjoy a cocktail.
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,Worth the elevator ride up to the top floor and kazaaammmm what a view! It was worth the tiring journey. The place is so relaxing with food/bar just around the corner. Great view of those skyscrapers and Gardens by the bay. it is also fascinating as the entire floor also swings. Went their at night but i think daytime would be the best time.
,,Over rated - could use a lot of improvements,2.0,,"We went to the Skypark as guests staying at the hotel. The areas available as a viewing deck were a disappointment. They were sparse and could do with at least some seating.

The bars joined to the viewing areas were a let down also. There were tables to have a drink at but no seating. Service was bad, with everything seeming to hard for waitresses. Just ordering a drink was a chore for them.

There are plenty of other buildings which would have a similar view that would be worth a visit."
,,Mesmerized !!,4.0,,Been in Singapore for 2 years already but always struck my the beauty of this architectural marvel. Wonderful hotel and the view from top is mesmerizing.
,,Great View,5.0,,"The Singapore skyline has become famous highlighting the Marina Bay Sands. Here you'll find a $$$ hotel, huge gambling casino, a ton of shopping, many food places, a Venice style waterway, and the must see Skypark at the top of the Hotel. I have visted the Skypark during both daylight and nighttime and I honestly can not tell you which is the best. Both day and night offer a super view of the city, harbor, and many other areas of the city."
,,Expensive but worth it,4.0,,It was expensive to visit the skypark. However if you dont get to do this sort of travelling its amazing. My kids 9 and 11 loved going the 50+ floors in the elevator and watching the lights of singapore it was really beautiful
,,You see this hotel from everywhere in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited and went to the 57th floor to the restaurant Flight 57. The views were incredible and this attraction is well worth the time to visit. We reviewed the restaurant elsewhere on TripAdvisor. We had heard that if visitors just go to the outlook of Skypark it would cost about $28 p/p. We decided to go to the bar at one of the restaurants and spend our money, yes there is a minimum, instead of paying for just an elevator ride. Great decision. So much so we stayed for lunch."
,,"Completely overrated, skip this and go to Singapore flyer",3.0,,"So here is Catch 22 situation here:
When you reach the ticketing counter of Skywalk (its located in basement next to entrance of Tower 1), they do tell you that you can only go to the tip of skywalk and a little around it but cannot enter pool or restaurant areas as that's for residents only.
I appreciate their honesty because a lot of organisations won't tell you that but they are professional so full marks to them.
What they'd not tell you (unless asked) is their is no place to sit, no chairs or tables or covered area except entry and exit.
The reason it is catch 22 is because the views are pretty much same from Flyer or any other High rise building in Singapore and the fact that you can't sit and eat, it means you pay a hefty fee, go through some high handed service professionals, enter, see the view, click a pic and exit in 10 minutes flat.
I won't recommend this to anyone especially if you end up on a day when it could start to drizzle any moment and you have elderly or kids with you who want to sit, absorb in the views and spend sometime.
I would say, go to Singapore flyer, take a Cocktail, Singapore sling, VIP package: Have your own capsule, have your drinks, chat, laugh and enjoy 30 minutes of Singapore views."
,,Over-hyped disappointment,3.0,,"Disappointing, very disappointing. I got the holiday camp atmosphere from the moment I entered to the moment I left. Guests couldn't find their rooms, people wandering around the foyer in bathrobes; just lacked the 5* it was said to have.

The pool at the top gave the impression of a cheap holiday camp style so little time was spent here.

Don't get a ticket for the observation deck; you get the same view when standing at the bar a few feet above it.

The design of the hotel is pleasing to me but the rest of it, well, sucked."
,,Dull daytime view,2.0,,"Visited it during the day, lucky there was no line up when I arrived. Views were ok but would prefer to have visited during night time. Disappointed could not access the pool platform for a better view."
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"Very amazing view up there from the skybar, floor 57. Expensive also, but that wasn't surprise. Highly recommend."
,,View from the top,4.0,,"Atop at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Skypark is a good platform for you to take a panoramic view of Singapore from above. You can see the magnificent Gardens By the Bay, the Singapore Flyer, the Merlion, and the skyscrapers in the business region. Skypark visitors can only visit one side of the top level platform of Marina Sands Hotel though, as the remainder is reserved for hotel guests. If you would like to dip in the famous borderless swimming pool, go book a night in the hotel!"
,,Bucket list item,5.0,,"Niagara Falls, Eiffel Tower and now Skypark are my most memorable places I have ever visited.. Please go Twilight and stay till dark. The experience is unforgettable. ."
,,You can see everything from top,4.0,,Just amazing how this tiny island has so much to offer! best to go during 6.30pm! and enjoy the sunset and night life! Restaurants available to grab drinks at the skypak!
,,Just stunning !!,4.0,,"The Marian Bay Sands Skypark is just stunning. Both, the general view from the Marina as well as the view down from the top is just outstanding!!"
,,Mesmerising view,5.0,,"The night view at the Skypark is something you won't forget. You get a marvelous view of Singapore's skyline, where countless brightly-lit modern buildings and quaint establishments jointly rest along the Marina Bay and stretching all the way to the Singapore River, a reflection of the city state's prosperity built on old heritage.

What's more, it was drizzling at the time of our visit, the cool and soothing breeze washed away our fatigue while we take in the spectacular scene, we went down feeling completely refreshed.

MBS doesn't provide umbrella so remember to carry one in the event of a heavy downpour."
,,Adrian,5.0,,Worth the trip to the top of marina bay sands hotel just to take in the breathtaking views and how quickly the lift takes from bottom to the top great experience
,,Expensive but worth the view,4.0,,"Great views over the city from the roof terrace. A bit small space at the eastern tip, and a bit expensive. There's a restaurant at the top, didn't go there. Despite the price, it's worth a visit."
,,Amazing !!!,5.0,,"Come here to enjoy the panorama view of Marina bay, should arrive around 6pm and wait for the sunset after visit the Garden by the bay."
,,View View View,5.0,,"Awesome View on a clear night , a good view of a well lit City Skyline , Singapore Flyer and the best view of the Gardens by the Bay. Nice windy and pleasant after a long day evening walking around Gardens by the Bay"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"From all over the city, this iconic building drawers people to it. The boat on top of the three towers is amazing and we had to 'hop off' our bus to visit. We weren't disappointed."
,,A must Do!,4.0,,Don't pay to visit the Skypark just go to the bar which is one story higher and right on top of the hotel. A drink is cheaper than the entry! An iconic building and fantastic views.
,,Great Place Great View,5.0,,"went there as a visitor. to the 57th floor..Costs you $23, but it iz worth it..
The view form above is fabulous..on one side you see singapore skyscapers...other side is Singapore flyer and the other side is the great ocean with ships all around. Just WOW!

went there for just half an hour but stayed ther for 2 hours. Very nice views all around for clicking photos.

Had coffee out there. A must place to go when in Singapore.!!"
,,Stunning views.,5.0,,Well worth a visit. The views are amazing. The bar at the top was not too busy when we visited and the drinks were not cheap but the experience was fabulous.
,,What an amazing place to visit,4.0,,"This place has everything you want. Amazing malls, great location and access. You can go anywhere from this point. The night light shows are not to be missed"
,,One of those things you do once,3.0,,"Overpriced. Great view, but the Flyer is just as good. Go to the Ku Ta De bar instead and avoid paying a huge amount for an elevator ride."
,,Nice,3.0,,"Singapore Skypark is worth it if you want to see Singapore in higher vantage, its taller than the Simgapore Flyer."
,,Somewhat over priced,3.0,,"Do you can pay, a fair bit, to go up to the viewing deck. The view is nice but I'm not sure it's worth the money. Probably wouldn't do it again."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"Head up to the very top, I think it was the 57th floor Tower One. There is a bar, (drinks a bit on the pricey side, $8 soft drink, $16 beer & $25 cocktails), comfortable seating, so stop for a drink and check out the views, totally amazing. The architecture is interesting, and fascinating, views galore, a great time waster! We were there for sunset, highly recommended. Don't forget your camera!!"
,,Just brilliant,5.0,,"Go up to the observation deck and you wont regret it! Simply the most stunning views over the city, on a clear day you see miles.....
S$23 and time up there being unlimited makes it in my view good value but ensure you have a clear day if possible and dont forget your camera or video. There are drinks available but no seating unless a hotel guest and you are not allowed to sit down on the deck, so you will probably spend a max of about half an hour."
,,OK not good!,3.0,,"This place was something I would not go to again as I have seen better, like the Burj Khalifa in Dubai which was more impressive. It was slightly overpriced in my opinion as well, as you had to pay SGD$23 for every adult and SGD$17 for children."
,,SINGAPORE BY NIGHT TOUR - Jam-packed with interest and value for money,4.0,,"It’s not often you come away from a tour feeling that it was value for money and there was a surprise at every corner.

That’s how we felt after the Singapore Night Tour. We went in the cool of the evening, were picked up from our hotel and went first to Gardens by the Bay – where we saw the light and music show under the Super Trees.

Next our coach took us to Marina Bay Sands SkyPark – a platform straddling two 57 odd storey high buildings. The all-round view of the lights and waterways, stretching one way to Indonesia and the other, to Malaysia, was breath-taking.

Next we were taken down to an arena on the side of the water-way and watched another synchronised light, music and water show against a backdrop of the water and city lights.

After a short walk along the boardwalk we boarded a launch which took us on a 20 minute trip up the river to Clarke Quay. There was recorded commentary on the way which gave the background of the several historical bridges we passed under and the buildings which boarded the waterway.

We alighted at Clarke Quay and had time for a walk around part of this vibrant entertainment and dining area.

The tour is jam-packed but not to the extent that it is not easy to handle.

We had a local Singapore lady as guide. She was excellent in shunting us - a group of straggly tourists – through the tight schedule. She was also an expert in pulling a couple of unruly boys into line, whose parents didn’t seem interested in doing so, who otherwise she said would have led us all to the very gates of hell. Well done.

Tragic"
,,Good views of Singapore,5.0,,I visited the viewpoint which is situated at the end of the boat-like structure at the top of the buildings. The views of Singapore and neighboring Malaysia and Bintan (Indonesia) are breathtaking. As a visitor you do not have access to the nearby infinity pool as this is for hotel visitors only but that is of no consequence. This attraction remains closed during bad weather.
,,WOW!!!!,5.0,,"I loved this place. Particularly the 57 Sky Bar. I had a meal here, quite expensive but excellent Chef, friend of Michel Roux. This was on Christmas Day in the evening and the view from the 57th floor the Sands Skypark over Singapore and the Singapore River was excellent, unforgettable."
,,Better view of Singapore,4.0,,"Some of the ""birds eye view"" attractions are getting old but what I really enjoyed about the Skypark was that it gave you a better view of Singapore's interesting architecture! Did you know that their football stadium is seaside? It looks as if it is floating! You really can't do much up there but sit down and enjoy the views. (Although there is a gift shop and snack shop as well.)

I noticed a lot of young adults hanging out with their friends at the Skypark. I don't blame them, with that kind of views... Who wouldn't want to just lounge around here?!"
,,IMPRESSIVE...,5.0,,"A must if you visit Singapore.... Absolutely Stunning Structure with fantastic all around views of Singapora....We're glad we choose this over the Singapore Flyer as once you get up there it's a far better choice... with much more to see and your higher up...
Fantastic Restaurant CÉ LA VI great for a drink and some lunch while you enjoy the breeze in the Sky...."
,,Not to be missed!,5.0,,"IF….. you're unable to stay at the Marina Sands ($$), this is the next best thing, and for $20 well worth the visit to the top. Granted you can't access the entire area, or the pool deck, you can at least get a glimpse.

We went up about 30 minutes before sunset to see both day and night. It was amazing as the city transitioned into the evening. The sunset behind the city was just as impressive.

Singapore in itself has so many cool features, this is just one more stop of the many that photos don't do justice.

As we were there in December, we could see all the holiday decorations come to life in the park below, which was an added bonus.

The daily light shows were pretty cool, as the beams bounced off the surrounding buildings, but I think you get a better view from ground level.

As many other reviewers mentioned, sure, the drinks are pricey, but not as pricey as Raffles :-).

The only frustrating thing we experienced is that when night falls, people start camping along the rails - large groups of people that set up shop for dinner, drinks and just to hang out. Since part is open and part is glass, if you can't get near the rails, you can't get photos and you can't look down. So, you end up climbing over people."
,,Perfect view,5.0,,"beautyfull views from the top of the hotel. I have been there lunch time when the temperatures are extremly hot, on the deck was only few people.Think on sunblock and enough water"
,,Check the weather first,4.0,,"Not long after arriving the weather closed in and the view was clouds. When it's rains here it rains. Fantastic hotel, easy so spot due to shape and large trees on the roof. Tried to make my $26 cocktail last but the view didn't clear!"
,,360 degree view of Singapore,4.0,,You get the whole city view and it looks stunning at the night. can spend 30-45 mins there. It's a good alternate to the flyer.
,,Tricks to travelling!,5.0,,"Fabulous, especially when you can have a free cocktail, gorgeous. Anyway found out that if you go up to the bar area, which is above the normal viewing point it doesn't cost but you need to buy a drink which works out the same as the trip up to the viewing point. Anyway walk through the hotel to the back and just before the glass sliding doors turn left and you will find the lift to the viewing point. Tell them when you arrive that you want to go to the bar and they will direct you to the next lift. Viva! a cocktail and a magic view. Normal trip up is $26 cocktail $26 you work it out."
,,Th3e BBC Asia News Tower,3.0,,"The Very first thing you see on BBC Asia business morning News is the Marina Sands SkyPark .This surely puts Singapore on the map world wide as a place to visit.

However it was raining when we visited on the 29th December 2015 which spoiled the views of Singapore,The Bar was very small with Knowhere to sit."
,,Singapore trip,5.0,,This area you just have to visit when in Singapore! Smart thinking behind this park and a nice place to walk around.
,,Breathtaking View,5.0,,"At skypark there are many activities to do. You can go for jogging, cycling and best of all just sit there and admire the beauty of Singapore with your loved once. Art and Science museum is easily accessible and provides excellent amusement in science. must go for all visitors."
,,Wow amazing hotel,5.0,,This hotel has a wow factor and is must see if you are in Singapore. The pool on the roof top is amazing. And views from the roof are just beautiful. The hotel has great rooms and great food. The best hotel I have been too.
,,Great view,5.0,,We stayed in marina bay sands hotel and had the access to the skypool also. The skypool opens around 6.00 am in the morning. We were there at around 6.30 it was still dark so we had night view as well as day view from the infinity pool. Its a lifetime experience don't miss it.
,,I'm the King of the World!,4.0,,We've got a complimentary tickets from our beloved friends from Philippines. We went up there and the view is stunning. But it's too hot there during the day. Bring your selfie stick!
,,Must visit for every traveller,5.0,,"This a must visit for every traveller and be sure to take a souvenir pic, it is worth it! A top of the world feeling- in Asia with amazing views right at the top of the 56th Floor. Must visit!"
,,Expensive and not welcoming,3.0,,We visited the roof and paid 32$ for a glass of wine and a coke. No seating was available and no access to the walkway around the roof either (hotel guests only). We didn't feel very welcome. Great views of Singapore of course!
,,"If you love the heights, this is the place",4.0,,"The sky park is a great location to see Gardens by the bay, Esplanade and museum from above..But it closes to early and the drinks are a bit pricey."
,,Great views,4.0,,"We saw this from our hotel every day and finally went on a grey drizzly day. The view was still amazing, and of course, the architecture is marvellous. It is slightly expensive but most Singapore attractions cost a lost."
,,To bad,4.0,,To bad that you can't go for a drink or meal if you don't stay at the hotel. The view is amazing and it's a cool building. Worth a visit.
,,Spectacular Views,5.0,,Stunning views with lovely Magical environment at top of Marina Bay. One cannot stop praising this spectacular wonder of the World and it's excellent architecture. We can see almost whole Singapore icons from there and enjoy its beauty. Must visit place in Singapore.
,,Best views of Singapore. Well worth the visit.,5.0,,"View is the best in Singapore, hands down. The light shows at 8 and 9.30pm are brilliant. As a guest of the hotel you need a room key for everyone in your party to get up here. I believe as a visitor you have to pay. The pools get pretty crowded but its a must see and do. Drinks aren't cheap."
,,Best architecture,5.0,,Beautiful building. Did not stay in hotel or visit casino but loved walking around and admiring the architecture. Great views. Great skyline. Great light show.
,,Great view..... But......,3.0,,Iconic location with great views of Singapore skyline and harbour.The bar is very pricey ($18 SGD) for a beer and this is limited shade. Best experienced in the evenings.
,,Surreal experience!,5.0,,"Strongly recommend spending time at the Skypark with family! The facility is just out of the world and the staff are very pleasing and helpful. To maximize your experience, stay with them for access to all features of the property. Its like nothing else you have ever seen. Guaranteed!"
,,Beautiful views from up above,5.0,,"You can't come to Singapore and not visit the marina bay sands. The views are breathtaking, you get to see the whole of Singapore. Our only regret is we didn't stay at the hotel, you don't get to see the infinity swimming pool area unless you're a member."
,,WOW!,5.0,,Stayed in the hotel club rooms so was able to breakfast up here every day of our stay along with numerous dips in perhaps one of the most amazing pools in the world. Hotel guests are also able to go over to the public skylark areas free of charge. The views are amazing from every angle. Well worth a visit.
,,Loved it,5.0,,Awesome view was terrific!!!!!!!!! I can't believe the structure of the building! It is massive when you go inside its wow
,,"Stunning building, amazing views",5.0,,"I first saw this stunning building in the taxi from the way to the airport; the views it offers of Singapore from the top are unparalleled.

Take the lift from the base of the Marina Bay Hotel up more than 50 floors. Step out into the fresh air and take in the panoramic views of Singapore. It's rather breathtaking! It's also a fantastic way to see the city from a unique vantage point. Be prepared with your camera.

When you arrive, before you take the lift, your photo is taken in front of a green screen. later, you can collect the picture, which has the nighttime background digitally added. Perhaps it is a bit of a twee souvenir, but we bought ours!"
,,Depends what you want!,3.0,,While this is an amazing property with a great view it is pretty restrictive. The observation deck does have great views but is quite pricey. Thought might take up the suggestion of having a drink in the bar instead having the same view however it was very busy and make sure you are dressed appropriately or you will not be allowed in. There are other options but maybe it is one of those you just need to do!
,,Great View but long lines,4.0,,"This was a little pricey but worth it I thought. The sunset and night time views were awesome. It got pretty crowded as sunset approached but we were still able to take some decent photos. Although the elevator was fast it seemed like it took forever to route everyone up to the observation area. The line to return to the ground level floors wrapped around the observation deck. Seems as though the moment the sun went down everyone decided to leave. The photographers at the entry took exception to the fact that we didn't want to pose for the obligatory ""tourist trap"" photo before we went up. They insisted that everyone had to take one. I did not. All in all well worth the trip but I would probably go to the restaurant one level up for a more relaxing experience."
,,Expensive but great views,4.0,,"We went first thing in the morning do the deck at the top was relatively quiet - great for taking photos. If it rains it closes and you have to return back down - money is refunded if this happens and you've been there less then an hour.

Entrance fee is $23 for anyone over 12 and they didn't even have family passes - this just gets you to the top and that's it. You can't access any other areas such as the infinity pool - that's for hotel guests only.

A photo is taken on the way in and printed with the backdrop of the hotel - tacky but a nice momento.

The disappointing thing is there wasn't any cafe or anywhere nice to get a drink / food at the top early in the morning so missed out there."
,,How they build this huge thing?Impressive.,4.0,,"I was in awe looking at the canoe shaped top of this Marina Bay building from afar.It captures anyone's attention while driving on the Marina Bay Avenue.Once inside the mammoth building one gets the feel of luxury and much detailed work.The high speed lift took us in no time right to the top-the Skypark.The view was breathtaking.It was spectacular and the large space gives you different views of the watérfront, the bay, the sea and the artistically designed buildings surrounding it.There are many second tiered decks whick provide different outlook posts and view points.We browsed through the souvenirs and ärtifacts and there are ome F&B outlets too.Take your time and enjoy the view and it surprised me that after this visit I got a different perspective of the island-state.It was truly inßpiring and exciting.A must for every visitor and resident alike."
,,"Have to go see it, don't you? :)",5.0,,The view was amazing - definitely worth the visit. You can avoid the fee but just visiting the bar at the top. The view is the same and you can grab a drink. We ended up going late at night and view and atmosphere was amazing. You cannot go to the infinity pool area unless you're a hotel guest (that's fair).
,,Amazing View,5.0,,Well worth the visit to the 56th floor! The view is amazing and the structure had us baffled by the sheer engineering of it all.
,,Singapore Highlight,4.0,,"The Skypark is a good place to get a perspective on Singapore old and new. Unfortunately, the Hotel food and drink provision on this level is for hotel residents only - not Skypark visitors, which is a bit of a pity. The information boards are very helpful, and fill you in on the way the city has been developing in recent years."
,,A great view and place to hang out,4.0,,We went here at night to watch the laser light show but was disappointed as our expectations were high. Nothing really much to see on the light show that they are endorsing but you'll be mesmerized by the great scenery of Singapore.
,,Stupefying view!,5.0,,"Go there for the view. There are two bars on the top, both are in the 18-25 $ per basic drink range. The vibe is better at ce la vi!"
,,Dont bother,1.0,,"This was more like a busy train station terminal than a hotel. Anyone can visit the top deck, which I believe should only be for the use of guests. Plenty of nicer hotels in Singapore."
,,Mesmerising..! What a view,5.0,,Was staying one night at the Marina Bay sands and the sky deck is must visit for all rooftop lovers.Awesome place to chill and have couple of drinks.
,,Awesome view!,5.0,,Totally amazing place with unbelievable view to Singapore! Even as backpackers the $23 entrance fee to Skypark was well worth it. You can't miss this place while in Singapore!
,,Must Go after Sunset !,4.0,,"Even If you are not staying ar MBS Hotel, You can but a ticket (S$23) . I have been at skypark during daytime and now night. Well the difference is 'night and day' :). It is possibly the best view of Singapore skyline at night with a laser lights thrown in as well. During daytime you are likely to be burnt in very hot sun. So choose nights and enjoy the views."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"We spent 4 hours at the Marina Bay, visiting the sky park which was fantastic.

Also in the basement are all the main shops and a canal with gondolas you can go on for a ride with a chinese gondola man singing Andrea Boccella songs, it was great well worth a visit.

Brian Leonard"
,,Awesome,5.0,,Incredible city scape and got to top for free because of 50th year celebrations. Should've been $98 each which we wouldn't have paid but fantastic views and bar
,,2nd best view of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"If you are not willing to pay the dollars the hotel is asking, then the 2nd best option is the Skypark. Everyone can enter for a fee. We did not have to as we stayed in the hotel and enjoyed the best view from the world famous infinity pool."
,,A must,5.0,,"The Architecture is stunning, the hotel is open to the 55th floor to the public to the bar. It is at the same level as 'the boat shape' crossing the two structures. Two beers $16 SIN, cocktails from $22, views....free. Stunning and the shopping mall is impressive. There ia a good cheap eTing hall by the skating rink....eat for around $6 for great meal and that was a small serving, which was very good size."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Not exactly cheap to go up to the sky deck but if you are in Singapore its a must! The views are fantastic, well worth a visit."
,,One of the best viewpoints in town,5.0,,"This is the viewing deck on the top of the Marina Sands Resort block. It cost quite a bit to enter but the resulting views and photo opportunities are great. The admission only lets you onto a small portion of the roof at the end; the centre section is taken up by the hotel, its pool and facilities. I don't know if there are viewing platforms at each end; we went up the one nearest the barrage so had great views over all of the historic and modern parts of the town."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,If you visit Singapore them you must visit this attraction. It has lovely view from the top also the restaurant is nice too
,,WOW MBS,5.0,,"This is my first time visiting Marina Bay Sands Sky park. My family was invited for a birthday party by my friends. At night, it is beautiful and you can watch the nice views. Very cooling place. I can see many visitors swimming and relaxing at the swimming pool. Enjoying the music and drinking beer... very relaxing. This is place you can visit beside Casino and nice restaurant in MBS."
,,Best rooftop bar in Singapore,5.0,,"Absolutely the best place in Singapore to drink a pint of beer, very expensive but worth every penny. Spectacular architecture and great view of this beautiful city!"
,,Only the bar,4.0,,I visited the bar for a bottle of tiger beer (£7) the bar was busy very active and would have been a good place to start a night out in singapore. The view was one I will not forget as the light up tower blocks lined the night sky (photos doesnt do it justice)
,,Superb,5.0,,"The view is amazing . The green the super tree and the entire ambience makes it a wow , it takes you to a new level to enjoy beauty from Above . Don't miss the view ."
,,The Giant Ship,5.0,,"Quite an imposing building from outside. Great, gigantic and beautiful architecture. The tall building can be viewed from everywhere. each view if mesmerizing. I have seen it from Gardens by the Bay, from skywalk, from Cloud Forest, from road and lake and each one marveled the other. Such an imposing building. As it is a giant, the prices are also expensive. Well, you have to pay a price for everything that is too dear."
,,Breathe taking view,3.0,,"The only way I would say to do this is if you are a photographer. Not the point and shot as I am. I would also recommend just staying one night in the hotel. As a guest you are allowed access to the viewing deck, sky garden, and the pool area. Worth more then the 25$ a person just for the viewing deck."
,,Great view: Bring an umbrella.,4.0,,Bit expensive but view is undeniably exceptional. Advise not to go in the afternoons as this os when the storms roll through.
,,View,3.0,,"Well, i wouldnt say its one of the best attractions, but it will do, you will have a birds eye view of the Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer and the Gardens by the Bay, rating it from 1 to 10"" i would rate it a 6."
,,Good place to shop and hang out,4.0,,Went for a half a day of shopping. Got all the top brands and a good choice of restaurants. Did not have the time to visit the casino. Would recommend a visit for half a day or a day.
,,Quite pricy for what you get,4.0,,"We loved the views and it was worth going up, but felt it was a little pricey for what you got; which was essentially views. Have been to better sky towers. Staff were very friendly though."
,,stay at the hotel and enjoy the views,5.0,,"The Sky park is a viewing platform where you can see spectacular views of the city and harbour. We stayed at the hotel and went here in the early morning, no cost to hotel guests. As we stayed in the hotel we had access to all the restaurants, viewing deck, infinity pool, spas etc. a great place to stay and enjoy modern Singapore. If you are afraid of heights, you may be challenged here."
,,Great views and photos OK through wire rather than glass,4.0,,"Went here between meetings as the place is ""famous"". Easy to find with a taxi and at $23 entry is not too over the top expensive. It is just a look out though - nothing else. At night may be even better as during the day i spent 30 min walking around and took some photos and was finished.
Most of the top deck of Marina Bay Sands is closed to public so this gives a little glimpse but to get real experience you must be guest of hotel.
The sign boards describing the various views are helpful and good."
,,Do not go there - it is not actually a park,1.0,,"We were very disappointed by our visit here. It is quite costly and we were very disappointed to find that you can only access a rather small platform at the tip of the roof, rather than the whole garden (which is reserved for hotel guests). Sure, this fact is mentioned just before you pay, but we waited for 30 mins. to get to that point... And on the platform itself, many of the food/snack options were sold out. The better option is to take a drink or have a nice dinner at the bar right next to the viewing platform. Book a table there and invest the money in something liquid - surely the better choice! The views are exactly the same!"
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"An excellent place to stay when you're in Singapore. It's a bit expensive. But luxury costs money and it was worth every single penny. It you take the club rooms or the suites, you can get free lounge access which is on the 54th floor tower 2. My room was the jade suite which was on the 51st floor tower 3. The service was excellent. This hotel has it all. Shopping mall, Casino, restaurants, pub and the luxury. The infinity pool is an amazing place to chill out and have beer. Overall it was an excellent experience for me."
,,Best view in the city!,5.0,,The place is awesome. I reccomend you to go here just before sunset (you are allowed to stay on the roof as long as you want) so you can see the beautifull colours of a sunset behind the skyline of Singapore!
,,Excellent Views,5.0,,Go with a good camera n when it's fine weather. Sunrise or sunset are both beautiful. Avoid cloudy or hazy days as totally a waste of time when weather is not good. Money will not be worth it except for in house guests as non hotel guests can only go a the side where the pool is NOT located.
,,The hype is not an exaggeration,5.0,,"Stayed one night and wished it was longer. I honestly cannot think of anything negative to say about this place. The staff, from reception to pool attendants and table staff were just excellent and should be congratulated"
,,Great view,4.0,,You can get up to one end of the platform on top of the marina bay Sands. You have a great view over the location of the F1 GP as well as towards the merlion.
,,Amazing views from the Skypark!,5.0,,"The first time you see the Skypark from a distance as it straddles the three towers of the Sands Hotel, you do wonder how they constructed it being over 50 floors high. The views give you a good perspective of the Singapore skyline and the Gardens of the Bay which are adjacent."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Well worth the money for the views. Amazing. We were going to do the singapore flyer but didn't feel the need after doing the sky deck.
,,Infinity pool !!,4.0,,What an amazing looking hotel. There was a great vibe to the whole place. If you go to Singapore you have to visit this hotel and swim in the infinity pool -that is an experience. Breakfast is now being served on the 57th floor and I highly recommend it for the views and the food. Service in the general hotel could have been better.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"my wife wish to visit this place last year when we stay at Resort World Sentosa but this year our dream comes true and explore this iconic spot on level 56, we love it and we collect a photo taken by the team."
,,Extraordinary Experience,5.0,,It was a fantabulous moment to freak out the the Marina Bay Sands Skypark Rooftop.. The overall view of the city was speechless.. The swimming pool at the rooftop giving the breath-taking experience being in the water next to the sky...
,,Arguably the best view in Singapore,5.0,,"57th Floor viewing, 360 degrees of Singapore. Free to hotel guests of The Marina Bay Sands. Magnificent day or night. Night viewing stay for the Garden Light Show or later for the Hotel Laser show."
,,Amazing Ninght view,4.0,,Its a place you must visit if you come to Singapore. Night time is really amazing and a bit romantic. One of the best place where you can click your photos. So many shops in the area.
,,Great View,5.0,,"Take the elevator to the 57 floor and the view is spectacular, you can see nearly all of Singapore from the observation deck."
,,Amazing View but not worth the money. One Altitude is better,3.0,,"Important: whats amazing about Marina Bay Sands is the infinity pool on the roof, its the largest infinity pool in the world. you will not get to access this from the Skypark so for this reason just go to One Altitude. its much higher and cheaper"
,,A must,5.0,,"Either just pay the 20$ for over 65,s and walk around the front part at level 56, or book a meal, food is great, at the restraint at the top and get the view from the 57 floor."
,,Romantic view,5.0,,"This place will have you in awe! While the price is steep for the average traveler, $330 a night, a two- night getaway for a couple would be memorable. There is a restaurant on the 57th floor, and an outrageous view of the city from the roof top infinity pool. What’s really cool about this place is you don’t have to stay to enjoy some of its upscale ambience. There are shops and restaurants throughout the ground floor, as well as an underground connection to the mall.

In the evening, take the elevator to the roof top observation deck on the 56th floor, where you can take pictures and enjoy awesome views of the entire city. A great place for panoramic shots, if you have a steady hand. The price is 23 SGD ( $16 U.S.); well worth it."
,,Amazing View of Singapore,5.0,,"Definitely the best place to have a great view of Singapore. Having lunch or dinner at the roof restaurant is always a good choice. It worths the effort to visit skypark at day and at night, a very different spectacle."
,,Mezmerising Feat of Architecture - Must See!,5.0,,I would recommend seeing the hotel outside and in while passing through on the way to see Gardens by the Sea and the Cloud Forest. I just could not stop looking at it because it is so unique and it is hard to believe that it could be built . . . the top part symbolizes a ship which honors the area's trade heritage.
,,high up,4.0,,its just mesmerizing looking at the lighted rooms from a distance. We took a walk through this skypark to go to the gardens by the bay and it was very refreshing as there was a cool breeze blowing through the air. It just gives you a different feel when you are walking so high up and looking at the city of Singapore. Just lovely
,,A look at how the other half live!,4.0,,"A quick trip to the top for the awesome views. It was a toss up between the Singapore Flyer and this and I thought this was better for a flying visit, which it was."
,,Fantastic view from the top,5.0,,"We got pleasant time during our stay in MBS, especially with the Skypark and the famous infinity pool. My kids really enjoy their time, they're extremely happy can feel the amazing, wonderful infinity pool. The different view of the city, morning and night are so captivating."
,,Amazing to look at .,3.0,,Found he shopping here way too expensive for us a good walk around when visiting gardens by he bay .
,,Free entrence + free drinks + nice view,4.0,,"So for some reason, we (four girls in our 20s+) got in for free, plus had a free drink ticket each? I have no idea how this happened, we were there around 22.00 on a Thursday night, and expected to pay a lot for entrence fee but nope. So this remarkable view for free, plus a free drink (which wasn't much but hey it was free) really made a good experience 200 m up in the air! Though the lower observation deck wasn't open, so that's the only thing to complain about since you didn't come as close on the upper deck. But you still had an awesome view of Singapore by night, and it's cool to have been up in this iconic building. Also conveniant that the MRT stops right inside the building, so it's easy going there. Just be sure you catch the last MRT on weekdays, we almost missed the last one by midnight!"
,,Infinity pool .. Oh yes!,5.0,,Fantastic views from the infinity pool and we had a great time here. It does get busy but there's always room for all. They could have had larger jacuzzi tubs or a few more. Can't faulted the service from pool deck staff !
,,Expensive but worth it,5.0,,This building is so iconic and simply stunning from all sides. The viewing platform is a little expensive but thw view is amazing. I recommend going late afternoon and staying until after sunset to get the best for your money
,,Wonderful hotel,5.0,,"This hotel is fantastic. We stayed in a club room, which gave us access to the club lounge on 55 floor. Complimentary food and drink in club loung was great. Staff wonderful. Infinity pool terrific"
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,We had great weather and the view was fantastic. We were much higher up than the Ferris wheel and got almost a 360 degree view of Singapore. Highly recommended
,,What a view,5.0,,"The view of Singapore is amazing from the top. Yes you pay tourist price, but I think it is just one of those things you do on vacation. It gave a great view of the Marina Gardens."
,,Expensive view of city,3.0,,"We went up to have a drink in the bar, nearly 20 SGD for a stubbie of beer. Yes it has a view of the city but it is a very small area. But nice and friendly staff"
,,Vsit to the top,5.0,,"What a view well worth the effort, there is a swimming pool for guests only, there is a cafe/restaurant for anyone, with breathtaking views There is a short walk through a garden setting (what at 75 floors up) with palms etc"
,,Great views,5.0,,"Great views of Singapore, an amazing structure and hotel. Wish we had the money to stay there and sit in that amazing pool. There was a wedding on when we were there, what a perfect venue for photos!"
,,worth it - for the view,4.0,,"The skypark is very overcrowded but you do have amazing views. We stayed the the Marina Bay Sands so we spend some time at the pool. Too many people with selfie sticks, too many screaming children running around, service is not the best."
,,Swanky,5.0,,Take your bathers and get your body out and swim and breathe deep as you look outward towards the sea and the city. ..truly spectacular
,,Amazing views,5.0,,It's even more beautiful in person! Come here at night for the beautiful skyline view. Perfect for a solo traveler as well
,,The pool has the most awesome view!,4.0,,"If you stay at this hotel for the express purpose of using the Skypark, then you won't be disappointed. It has a view of the skyline of Singapore that rivals almost anywhere we've been. An inconvenience is the turnstyle/card requirement for movement between the towers--this is not an element you expect in a hotel that touts itself as upscale. I felt like I was in Disneyland/Disney World with a FastPass ticket. The drinks and food are expensive, but so is Singapore. Anyway, if you want one of the best views of the city while you while away your day in an infinity pool, then you probably can't get any better."
,,yes... i already in singapore... 2013 december,5.0,,december 2013 year... i already visit singapore in place train mrt and lrt nice.. i like it singapore nice.
,,A unique building,3.0,,It's just as beautiful when it's lighted at night. It's not worth the S$23 to get up there now that you cant get to the swimming pool
,,Amazing hotel,3.0,,Has to be seen. Variable service. Sometimes great. Sometimes very bad. 45 mins for pool service after asking waiters 3 times? Wouldn't go again but must be seen once
,,Superb.,4.0,,"- An architectural achievement, given the limited land area - Has Singapore's favourite public pool, I guess. - Fantastic views of the city."
,,Great View,4.0,,"We went at 2pm on a Sunday. The place was pretty empty. People kept telling us that they charge $25 to go to the sky park, but we weren't charged anything. I think the trick is to tell them you are going to get a drink at the bar, Ce La Vi. This is on the top floor and we were not pressured to buy anything. The drinks are a little pricey starting around $23 each. The view is fantastic! They have certain areas closed off to hotel guests only, including the pool. We didn't need to stay more than 20 minutes to get some great pictures and enjoy the scenery before leaving."
,,Imposing,5.0,,This place presents an imposing view both from outside as well as inside. Its a bit pricey but worth it.The place and its surroundings is packed with places to visit. So visit with adequate time in hand. and you may get tired moving around trying to cover the complete place with its surroundings
,,Awesome hotel,5.0,,"The best hotel in SG, very spacious rooms, accommodating staff, nice both city and bay view walking distance to MRT, shopping malls, bars, convinient stores, restaurants, parks and some tourist spots in the city. We will definitely come back here soon!! 😆"
,,"Marina Bay Sands and Singapore are synonymous, must visit.",5.0,,"It was a memorable and great experience and the experience that I and my friends would cherish all our lives. It is a very awesome place, the terrace i.e; Sands Skypark Observation Deck is the best. One could enjoy silence even though crowd is present there at all times that too from across the globe. Also the cool breeze that would blow through you throughout is a memorable experience. One could see the skyline of singapore parallely if you are on this observation deck. The Marina Bay Sands building is very posh the security is very tight and also it feels safe throughout the premises of such a huge marvel. This is the most eye-catching architecture in Singapore. We spent more than 3 hours at this place, I would recommend that all those who want to visit this place should plan the visit in such a way that the end of your visit collides with sunset, because after sunset the experience deteriorates. This experience is such that you should visit this place yourself to experience because this one of a kind memorable experience that no one could put in words."
,,Infinity Pool,4.0,,"My title says it all doesn't it? Really that's the best part, everything else there gets over shadowed because it's just that amazing. Again, Infinity Pool."
,,Must Experience when going to Singapore!,5.0,,"When you go to Singapore you definitely have to go to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark infinity pool. Unfortunately you can only swim there if you are hotel guest, so you have to book one night to do that. Prices are quite expensive but if you have the money for it you should do it! It is worth it! It feels like you are on another holiday destination!"
,,Overrated and packed,2.0,,"Packed with people, the food is just ok and the service is behind expectations. Even the views wont make it up for me"
,,Go before sunset,4.0,,"This was my second time going up to the Marina Bay Sands observation deck and it wasn't as great as my first when I went before sunset on a clear day. This day, it was cloudy and raining on and off. Tickets are somewhat pricey but if you have a Singapore Airlines ticket for that month, you get a discount. Great deal. Despite the weather, the view is wonderful and you do get to peek over at the pool. Definitely recommend for first timers in Sg."
,,A very different kind of architecture !,5.0,,"Of all the different architecture in Singapore, the Skypark is likely the most amazing sight, with a swimming pool at the top."
,,Night View from Above,5.0,,"This is an iconic sight in Singapore. Perched atop an hotel it is a very impressive structure, I took the lift to the 54th floor, which was quick and smooth. The sight over the bay is one not to be missed, and then to sit down and have a drink made the whole experience very memorable. A must see on your next visit to the island."
,,Amazing view from the Skypark but better to stay and enjoy it all!,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and so enjoyed both the infinity pool and the view from the Sky park it is a must do when in Singapore! if your budget will stretch to it, it is worth staying for at least one night to enjoy the hotel properly but either way an enjoyable thing to do."
,,Great experience - secret tip for a free drink,5.0,,"We visited the bar on top of the Skypark. The lift there is free but the drinks expensive, however by saving the Skypark 23 SGD entry fee you can buy a drink and enjoy beautiful view over Singapore. You need to go to the hotel lobby at the tower 3 to get up there. Dont go to the Sky Park entrance."
,,The View,4.0,,"Non hotel guests too can take a separate lift to this place, have drinks and lunch or dinner here. Although, a little pricey, the service was very good. Worth a visit. Want to impress the other half..."
,,"Great View, come when its not high season *o*",4.0,,"Pros:
-amazing view of Singapore
-best at night, you really get to see all the twinkling lights
-better if you can enjoy dinner or swim in the pool
-they also have a family jacuzzi and kids' pool

Cons:
- Don't go during peak season, it was really packed during our visit in January, we can't get any seats or even food because there were just too many to cater."
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,One of the best hotels in Singapore. The swimming pool at the top of the hotel is positioned to give the visitor a magnificent view of the surroundings
,,Great view,4.0,,"Insane view once your up there. The hardest part was getting a ticket to go there. We asked so many people before finally getting a ticket and waiting in a crazy long line to purchase the ticket.

Can't recall whether it was tower 1 or 3 but it was the hotel entrance and to go downstairs to basement area to purchase. The view is spectacular especially at night!"
,,Brilliant view from the deck.,4.0,,Once you go up the elevator to the observation deck the view is brilliant. If your not a fan of heights you may get a bit squeamish but it is worth it. Singapore may be a financial & shipping hub but this one attraction is worth the price of admission.
,,Marvelous plus plus,5.0,,Marvelous plus plus any visit Singapore should came here piece of art lovey attraction over looking the surrounding area
,,Fantastic architecture.,5.0,,This is really someplace to visit. You can't believe from the outside what you see inside. The view is spectacular. The whole place is really something to see
,,Lots to see from up there,4.0,,"The visit to this incredible structure with three towers of access, great restaurants, shopping and access to Gardens By the Bay, The Helix Bridge as well as an infinity pool, roof top bar and food...... makes it a must stay and place to visit, if passing thru"
,,Wonderful views over the gardens,4.0,,"We visited at sunset and the views were great. Unfortunately the haze meant we couldn't see as far as we would have liked, but we could see the gardens by the bay, which was beautiful from such a height, and we saw the sun set over the city. Be aware that the area for public viewing is actually very small, the rest of the rooftop is for guests only, so it gets fairly busy!"
,,Great view for a price.,4.0,,The marina bay sand skypark boast a beautiful view of Singapore that stretches out far then you can see! Best view of Singapore. But with no access to the rooftop pool (for hotel guest only) and being quite expensive with larger groups of people it brings the attraction down in value.
,,No use,2.0,,"The place is overflowing with tourists, the infrastructure is a must see, not worth going inside. You cannot access the top pool area, unless you eat at the pool bar. They have a deck that you have to pay to visit. Inside the hotel there is nothing to see as such. We visited the casino which was very nice, free beverages, and nice setup, make sure you have your passport original with you for the casino."
,,Do yourself a favour,5.0,,"A ""must do"" attraction while you are in Singapore, although if you are scared of heights this may not be for you. Views are absolutely fantastic and makes you realise just how big Singapore is. Shutterbugs will have a ball up here."
,,nice bar to go to,5.0,,"nice bar to go to, ce le vi. Forget about the swimming pool (which u need to be a hotel guest), you could simply skip it if you're going to the bar."
,,Scenic,5.0,,This is a good place to go for the first time visitor to Singapore because you can take time to get your bearings and marvel at the achievement of the Singaporeans. The entrance to the roof can be hard to find but follow the Skypark signs from the Marina Bay Shoppes or Hotel. Note:once on top you cannot use the infinity pool unless you are a hotel guest.
,,NICE...,5.0,,Nice place to relax..Was there on the Eve of New Year..Got to see blasting firecrackers...Enjoyed my time here...
,,Great views,5.0,,If you want a great view of Singapore by night go on this ! Fantastic 360 degrees of beautiful Singapore sparkling. Only negative is the wait for the lift going up and down- be prepared to wait at busy times.
,,Skypark,4.0,,"Yep its high and the view is great, and that's about it, have a Singapore sling and relax for an hour or so..."
,,"Beautiful views, must see!",5.0,,"We stayed here for 3 nights and the sky deck was a highlight. The views up here are amazing. Definitely visit during the day and night, just beautfiul. Pools are very clean and lots of lounges around the pool, get there early to get a spot near the pool though."
,,Amazing spot,5.0,,"We visited after our day at the Garden in the Bay to have a meal at the restaurant at the top. The food was first class no doubt about that. The views were amazing, we were photographed on the way up to the top and this has been a very memorable photo to have had taken, great idea. You won't be disappointed if you do visit. The bar outside with stunning views was not open at the time we were there but would be fun and a great spot to enjoy a late afternoon drink, perfect. Highly recommend"
,,Curiosity,3.0,,We went up to the Marina Bay Skypark. Great view but only from the viewing points - no access to the actual pool - can't even see it from Skypark.
,,Awesome View,5.0,,Uniquely beautiful view when I am on the skypark. The view was really awesome. Having to dine in the skypark is really a good experience where i am able to enjoy the food as well as the scenery.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"The perfect spot to see the view of Singapore city, you can see all the city from the deck. Better to go here in the evening for pictures, from sunset till city night view."
,,Cool place with amazing city view!,5.0,,"This place is always crowded, but the view is really breathtaking. You can sit there and wait for the sunset or night to see millions of lights...very beautiful. Work till 10 pm."
,,oooooooo wow !!,5.0,,"we visited in the evening , very busy elevators , but when approached the skypark its a wonder , plz dont compare with burj khalifa as both the places have there own charms... just go there & have fun. best in the late evenings...."
,,Absolutely must visit!,5.0,,"You have to do it on the sunset, with good weather and then it will be completely breathtaking! Beware of crowds, though"
,,Killer view,4.0,,Went up to the roof top where they have the infinity pool. Simply awesome with a killer view of Singapore
,,Fantastic views!,5.0,,Even though this is expensive it´s definitely worth it. We arrived around 18 and stayed for 2 hrs. To se the sun setting over the skyline and harbor of Singapore is breathtaking. My rekommendation is to do this after you have visited gardens by the bay.
,,Great View!,4.0,,"Unfortunately you can only go up to a part of the deck, which on the other hand is understandable...would've been nice to see the infinity pool though too. Other than that, i love the view."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"This area is a show-place. It is so beautiful. My friend and I walked around and took pictures, looked at all the wonderful attractions. Everything was clean, nice, and we felt perfectly safe."
,,Not the best place to spend New Year's Eve,3.0,,"Disappointed by the organisation of the New Year's Eve event. Long queue for the elevators, compounded by the insistence that each party stops to get a souvenir photo taken before the elevators on Level B1. We stood for an hour in a space not designed for a mass of people itching to get to the roof on New Years Eve. Once on the roof, the area was overcrowded with limited space to see the fireworks and the complimentary glass of champagne was of a very poor quality. Wouldn't choose to come back again."
,,Singapore' s best view point,4.0,,"With panoramic view of Singapore and beyond, it' s fascinating. There are restaurants and bars on the 57th level and a souvenir counter. Best time to go is before sunset so you get to watch the world goes by."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,Superb picturesque place .... The view from above is just breath taking .... A MUST MUST MUST visit for all travellers ..... We went when the city was all decorated with christmas n new year lights n boy was it some view ..... In the evening the lights just make the glitter
,,Great finale to our visit to Singapore,5.0,,Well worth the admission price on a clear day. Gives you a great overview of the centre of Singapore.
,,Good to visit at night,4.0,,If visiting Singapore one should go and see the night view from MBS Skypark. Great way to see the city at the night. Somewhat expensive and can be qoues
,,A must-see when in Singapore,5.0,,"Everybody had told us about the Marina Bay Sands Skypark (called ""MBS"" by locals), so we were looking forward to visiting. The experienced definitely was worth the wait! Amazing views of the city! Well worth doing."
,,New Year Eve,5.0,,Good food in not bug portions. Expensive but good wine. Best view. Many people from all over world. Very exclusive place. Very expensive. For special people.
,,The Place for see city of Singapore from the high floor,4.0,,Is a paid sky desk for you to enjoy a fabulous Singapore city view. Sea and some landmark are under your view.
,,Amazing view!,4.0,,"Amazing view, plenty of space up there to take your time. Was disappointing that you are not allowed access to the bar area though"
,,Unbelievable!,5.0,,"An experience not to be missed, a night tour including a trip to the 57th floor was well organized & mind-blowing in dimensions."
,,Good as it is free,3.0,,Good as it is free. You can see some of Singapore's touristy spots from the area. Good to visit towards sundown. There are good spots for photos.
,,All you imagine it is!,5.0,,"Probably the best view from a hotel pool anywhere in the world. Expensive, yes. Great drinks poolside, with the attentive and professional staff you would expect."
,,Great view depending on the weather,4.0,,"Ok, it cost about $18 US to go up to the 57th floor to the roof deck, Not a bad deal if the weather is good, but when we were there , there was a haze over the entire city due to fires in Indonesia, or so we were told. Our pictures didn't turn out so good due to the haze. There is also a bar on the next story up. Not accessible from the roof deck. Hit the elevator , go up one floor. Drinks are NOT cheap!! But., since Singapore is probably only a once in a lifetime trip for me, I was prepared, and didn't mind spending the money. ( Also , we didn't go to the Singapore flyer due to the haze)"
,,Incredible View!,4.0,,"The view is amazing and unbeatable, but also very busy! Try to make a dinner reservation in Sky on 57th. or Ce La Vi!"
,,"I prefer this over the Flyer, t'is true!",5.0,,"If you have to choose only one of them (for various reasons: time crunch, tight budget, fixed itinerary, etc.) choose the roof of the Marina Bay Sands instead. Apart from the fact that you can come and go for however long, or short, a time you want, it is at a slightly higher level than the Flyer. And I think the view from the top is splendid.

Time to look at the teeny-tiny Merlion from the top after looking at the gigantic ""boat-hotel"" from the Merlion Park.

P.S: While there is no fee to go to the top and click millions of photos, if you want a souvenir, you'll have to shell out quite a price to get the authentic photo of you photoshopped in front of the Bay Sands (Oxymoron, much?!)
Also, the elevator to reach the roof? Quite speedy. You reach the top floor in less than a minute. Don't think about it, and you'll almost not notice the change in air pressure in your ears! Think of it instead as a very wonderful plane take-off and you'll be peachy!"
,,Great place to spend an evening,4.0,,Very close to gardens and the mall has variety of options to choose from. The place is excellent for an evening stroll and dont miss the show sound and light show.
,,Worth the entry fee,5.0,,We decided to take a look at the view from the sky park as a spur of the moment thing and we are glad we did. A highlight of our Singapore stopover!
,,Skypark rocks!!,5.0,,"Entrance to Skypark is one floor below the main floor of the hotel! Costly because if you are not staying at the hotel, you are limited to a small viewing area."
,,Funny looking boat on hotel top,4.0,,"Restaurant is way overpriced-- avoid it! $20(Sing.$) to enter rooftop viewing platform which provides excellent city view. Nightly light show viewable from the ground level lasts 15 min., and fun. Mall at Marina Bay has a collection of the most upscale shops I have ever seen!"
,,I'm on Top of the World!,4.0,,"With panoramic view of Singapore and beyond, the feeling is just like what I've titled this review. Personally, I feel that going up to the Sands Skypark is better than taking the Singapore Flyer as there is no limit to how long you can enjoy the magnificent landscape before you. There are also restaurants and bars on the 57th level plus a snack and souvenier counter. Best time to go is before sunset so you get to see the beauty of the day and the magnificent lights in the evening."
,,Nice addition to gardens,4.0,,Great way to cool off and get a view of surrounds. The walks around the structure was cool. Some serious $$$ was spent to create this. Who needs Dubai? When Singapore spends on this sort of thing.
,,Singapore Visit,5.0,,"This was also a great view. The restaurant was great for a lunch while looking over the city and the bay of Singapore. You cant miss this building, and dont want to miss the trip to the top."
,,A paid tourist-packed view of the city.,3.0,,I guess this is the only public access to view Singapore city. But be prepared to pay and queue. it is a good quick stop if you visit Gradens by the Bay.
,,See Singapore from Top,4.0,,"You can buy all the attraction tickets by online, go to marina baysand and up to 56 floor to sands skypark, see the scenery from the top of the famous hotel."
,,High and mighty,3.0,,"Went today 30th December 2015 whist visiting my daughter who lives in Singapore. Cost was just under £25. To ride up in a lift to the viewing area where. We took photos of the views of the surrounding area, which to be quite honest are spectacular. That was it. Could have spent even more money on overpriced trinkets and a photograph they insist on taking, (£15 each) but resisted. Great views ridiculous price"
,,excelante,5.0,,"unbelievable view and amazing hotel , the high swimming pool and all the equipped things you can enjoy"
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"The restaurants are good; especially Spago, and the view is amazing. If you spend the night in the hotel, don't miss the sunrise. It is the least crowded and the most magic moment..."
,,Go at 6plus - 8pm,5.0,,"Get three in one view of Singapore (daytime, sunset, night time) all at once by coming here at 6plus and staying till about 8pm. You will get a great view of the downtown area of Singapore where MBS, Singapore Flyer, Singapore River, Esplanade, the CBD area and the Tanjong Pagar port can all be seen and captured. 20plus dollars for such an experience is definitely worth it. Remember to swallow some saliva during the ride up the lift to prevent ear-block."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,This is a very cool building. It was on my bucket list to visit while in Singapore. The views at the top was amazing. You nearly get a 180 view of the city. Take your time to pick out all the land marks. It's a must do attraction. Food is not cheap.
,,A view from almost the topmost structure of Singapore,5.0,,We visited at night time and enjoyed each second of the view from SkyPark top deck. We were not allowed to go close to infinity pool. The allowed part of the deck is quite a view.
,,"took a look at the view at night, and a drink!",4.0,,"Took the elevator up to the top floor bar out on the terrace , it is free so no paying to go up to see the view. all you have to do is say you are going up to the bar when you get in the lift. Dress is smart casual. I am sure you get a slightly better view from the sky park level but this is a little higher and you can get a drink too,"
,,"Cool, picturesque View of Singapore",4.0,,Great place to be when you are in Singapore. Covers the prime are of the island. Ideal time is evening/night.
,,Night Visit to the SkyPark S$23 per head,4.0,,Worth a visit to see the night view of Singapore. If you come for 8pm you can see the laser show over Marina Bay. Well worth a visit.
,,"Great views, amazing building",5.0,,Very cool building with amazing views over Singapore. This was on my bucket list and equals Abeno Harukas in Osaka for view and awesomeness.
,,Wonderful views of the city,4.0,,Highly recommend for the city views as well for sushi and drinks (not cheap though). Book in advance as the place was full when we were there.
,,Spectacular Views,4.0,,"The views here get you to see most of Singapore. Perched high on the 5th floor, you get an almost 180 view of the Island. Don't get taken in though by the people selling you pictures that you take as you enter, they are the most expensive pictures ever, but I suppose I'd you have the money, then go ahead a splurge."
,,Just okay.,3.0,,"I guess it depends what you want from your holiday. If you want to end up with a photograph of self and other riding a roller coaster, the Skypark could be right down your alley. On the other hand, if your memory bank is full of those sorts of shots Chinatown, the City Gallery, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum or Theatres on the Bay might be more to your liking."
,,Worth the price for the view,5.0,,Unrivaled view of Singapore! Compares to the Empire State Building in New York. Definitely worth a visit. We went at dusk and got some awesome photographs!
,,Views of the City,5.0,,"An impressive looking building and the views don't come much better. The swimming pool (part of the hotel) is also very impressive, but not private from non-guests"
,,What a view,5.0,,Go to the bar at the topic the hotel and the view is fantastic. Over look the sea and the city. It also has a infinity pool at the top of the hotel. We went at night for a view of Singapore. Simply breath taking.
,,Wow....,4.0,,Nice view especially at night. Not a relaxing pool as it's crowded. The swimming pool is more for people watching but kids love it.
,,Summary of Singapore,5.0,,"Standing on the 57 floor, not the highest building in Singapore but who cares as long as the sea view and the garden view is not block at all. Forgetting about the city view as u can see them on 1 altitude or swissotel. Have a great connection with the nature, over looking the sea with many vessels on the sea, one of Singapore most important trading. If you notice will enough into the sky, u will be able to see plane flying across the sky, yes planes. They are from different countries n are ready for landing at Changi Airport. Worth a visit when u guy traveling to Singapore. Not forgetting for Singaporean to appreciate what Singapore have, once again !"
,,High Heights,5.0,,"""My beautiful gem"" ""Magnificent skyline"" An experience where you feel free, And with beautiful scenery"
,,100% recommend !!!! Infinity pool,5.0,,"Amazing service by DAX and KALOS at the infinity pool. Felt like a queen all day!! They took very good care of me and were very professional. The food was amazing, just like the Mbs rosé champagne. I recommend this place if you want to have a delicious afternoon lunch or even breakfast in a beautiful setting, with the singapore skyline view and the infinity pool."
,,Skypark Viewing,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sky park is offers a great view across MArina Bay and Singapore city. Take note that in the middle of the day, this can be a very hot venue."
,,Awesome views,4.0,,This whole development reminds me of a upscale Vegas hotel/casino. The sky park is well worth the 23 dollars. You get the best 360 views of the city and there's a restaurant up there too. Unfortunately the infinity pool is for guests only!
,,you can view entire singapore city,4.0,,amazing beauty..can see entire city of Singapore...very high place ..have nice restaurant in the top of hotel......................
,,Epicenter of good number of tourist attractions,4.0,,This place is really good to spend some time and absorb the vibrant city that Singapore is. It is accessible by MRT and has connections to and from the airport. Plan to see it during the day and again at night.
,,Very cool and worth a visit,5.0,,"The skypark is the main attraction to the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The main part of it is reserved for hotel guests but the two ends have restaurants and bars that anyone can go to. You can get great view of the central business district, Marina bay itself and also the garden by the bay in the back. I do recommend going here for dinner or drinks and getting a great night view."
,,wonderful view,5.0,,it's only open to hotel guests and you have limited time to spend since the check-in time to hotel starts on 15:00 and takes 30mins to reach your luggages. check-out is also very early at 11:00.i strongly recommend you to wake up early and catch the morning sun on the pool.
,,What a view!!!,5.0,,Went up to the top of the Skypark - to the Observatory and looked at the view of the marina and also out to sea as far as possible. What an amazing view it is even through we were up there when it poured down with rain and there was lightning and thunder going off around us! Normally if it rains they won't let you buy tickets to go up on to the Skydeck. We were so pleased to get to see the thunderstorm and then when the sky cleared we got to see the entire view. Well worth buying tickets to go see the view.
,,Great views on clear days,5.0,,"Of all the attractions in Singapore, this might be the most weather-dependent. We went up on a somewhat hazy day, and it did diminish the views from up there quite a bit. Try to go up either on a clear day (tough to get in the rainy season), or at night.
I know a lot of people say that you can get the same views when you go to the bar on the same level, but that's actually not true. Yes, the bar saves you the money, but you have nowhere near the access to the views that you have when you're in the Skypark. Also, no, no access to the pool up there, that's for hotel guests only.
The good thing about the skypark is that you have about 270 degrees of a viewing angle, which covers both the sea and the Gardens by the Bay beforehand, and a great view onto the new city skyline (most of it built in the 90s or later) around the Bay. Not cheap, but I really enjoyed it."
,,rude staff,3.0,,this venue is let down by rude staff and stupid rules about what you can and can't access. not all staff are rude but some of the bar staff and the woman on the lift access need a personality course
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,These buildings are the attraction on Singapore and thus it is obvious to visit the skypark. There is a pool on the top which is reserved for the people staying in the hotel. There is a good photo-op when you visit the park. It was raining when we visited and it was fun with rain too.
,,A Landmark to look at,4.0,,"Such an amazing landmark to put in the background of your photos. It has become the new signature of Singapore.

It is very difficult to book a room here in peak seasons if you didn't book well in advance.

Couldn't review the rooms as I didn't stay here. But I checked out the shopping mall in the front. All luxury designers brands.

The ground level of Marina Bay Sands hotel seemed a bit busy, buzzing and crowded because it is open to the public and tourists. Hotel Restaurants, buffet restaurant and front desk are all located here too. It would provide more privacy if they are on a different levels for hotel guests."
,,Great View from the Top,4.0,,"I went to the bar ( Sky on 57 ) on the top with my friend.
You will have access to view the whole Singapore, from the above. It is awesome. The weather at night is pleasant, the atmosphere in the bar is relaxing and joyful. It is a cool place to spend time with friends."
,,What a view,5.0,,What an amazing architecture. Man made on a reclaimed land with precision planning. A must visit place. An aerial view with amazing photo ops.
,,Cool bar,4.0,,"Cool bar, nice view. Too bad the pool is only for guests of the hotel. Drinks aren't cheap, but you get quality in return. The music was a bit loud, but good (chill out house)."
,,Ok sorts...Good view of Singapore at night..,3.0,,"I personally think you should see this from outside rather than spending 25 dollars and getting to the top. The view is gr8, especially at night but then its not worth the money spent. Good to see from a distance."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Stunning. Elegant shopping centre inside for the money makers and a fabulous hotel! Head to the top and take in the spectacular views also!! The looks of this place are very unique.
,,views are awesome,5.0,,the views are truly spectacular and it is definitely worth it to spend the money to have a look. wonderful photo opportunities
,,TOP of Singapore with beautiful views,4.0,,Amazing TOP of the building with beautiful views of Singapore skyline. One of the best places to admire Singapore in all its glory. The SkyPark is accessible through an express list which covers 50 plus storeys in less than a minute. An adult ticket costs 25 dollars. Super!
,,All those panoramic pictures are true!!,5.0,,This place offers the most spectacular view of the Singapore skyline. I celebrated my anniversary here and it proved to be very memorable experience. The ambience is sooo romantic!!! This place lives up to all its widely circulated pictures on the Internet. Your simply cannot miss this place while in Singapore.
,,Great view but waste of money,4.0,,"It offers a fantastic view of the Singapore skyline. Although I enjoyed myself, but there's really nothing else to do. Restaurants there are exorbitant. Perhaps if you really want to have a good look at the famous infinity pool then please go for it."
,,Excellent views of Singapore from the top,4.0,,For 23SD you can go to the top of this amazing building and admire the views. Note you are not allowed up to the infinity pool as that is for hotel guests only. I recommend you save your money and admire the building from the Merlion Park.

,,Great views,5.0,,You are only allowed entry to the overhang end of the roof area but the views are spectacular. What a great building.
,,Architectural marvel!,4.0,,"The skypark is above the Marina Bay Sands Hotel resembling a ship atop the three buildings which is quite a sight to behold. The view of the city from the observation deck is fantastic. But i was a tad disappointed that you cannot access its infinity pool to even have a brief look. Would have loved to see it- would have been quite an experience by itself. The infinity pool is only accessible for hotel guests it seems. Considering the hefty price of the ticket for only the visit to the observation deck seems quite steep.There is loads of other things to do in the premises itself like the MBS mall, restaurants,theatres, art science museum, light and sound show,etc which is better value for money."
,,Nice view,5.0,,Excellent view of the city and the sea. Don't expect to see the laser show from here or the infinity pool. Laser show is intended to be viewed from the ground.
,,Amazing View,4.0,,"Ticket to the observation deck is SGD23; stay as long as you like, but nowhere to sit; no access to the infinity pool; the view is amazing though. Worth an experience."
,,Great view,5.0,,"I had previously visited 4 years earlier and noticed the different projects completed in the area. You are able to see all the ships in port.,"
,,Glance whole Singapore,4.0,,You can see all of Singapore from the top. Very well planned and designed. Sky scrapers have a good view from the top here. Only half of the floor is accessible for the people who donot live in marina bay hotel. Swimming pool is not accessible for visitors.
,,Spectacular view,4.0,,"The view from the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands is spectacular. However, to get a truly good view, one would have to swim across the pool to the edge. But it was still worth a visit."
,,Very Good,4.0,,Was staying at Marina Bay Sands so went to the Skypark and was wonderful. One can visit in the evening / night.
,,Stunning Views!,4.0,,No better way to see over Singapore from thus incredible landmark building. We went in the morning and had amazing views of this amazing city. No queues and easy to access by fast lifts. Worth the entry fee and noontime limit once up there.
,,Infinity Pool = Selfie Pool,2.0,,"Visiting guests don't get to access the pool. But as a staying guest, we had full access.
But don't get fooled by the advertisements. There is no swimming in the ""infinity pool"". It is crowded at almost all hours by people standing inside like a crowded shopping mall, all snapping selfies and posing. No seats, too many people and you have to wonder in the pool's filtration system is at its limits! Don't come here to relax or experience something nice. Come here, push, shove and get your selfie and post online..."
,,A place you should visit in Singapore for solo travellers,4.0,,"The roof top night club is really one of a kind. You can see all around Singapore in one shot. The best ambience will make you relaxed, Good choice of food and cocktails"
,,breathtaking,5.0,,"champagne overlooking the pool and the city, was the perfect way to end a trip, even in the rain. Next time I will stay here so i can take a dip in the pool!"
,,Worth the money,4.0,,"Spectacular view, especially in the evening with the light shows. Expensive beer, not too long queues. Well worth the money."
,,Night view over the F1 racetrack,5.0,,"If you get to Singapore for F1 race it is difficult to be in Marina bay skypark Saturday or Sunday. But it is open up to 10pm on Friday and the marina is lighted around the track. It is an awesome view and the skyline of the buildings amazing. There is also a laser, fire and smoke show every 30 minutes in front of the port. It is a must to visit in this city."
,,Felt Top of the world!! Amazing Views !!WOW,4.0,,Its the top of Marina Bay Sands. Entry is Free and here you go..Once you step out of the elevator you feel fantastic just the views are amazing. Only draw back is the service at the roof top bar. Its does not match up to the reputation of the Hotel. Needs a bit improvement!!
,,Snobs,2.0,,"My daughter and I went to the ""shoppes"" as they are known, and the concierge there told me we wouldn't be admitted to any eatery or bar in the Marina Bay complex. I was pretty cranky, as I was actually wearing my best dress ! Although it was not designer-label, it was a well-known designer's fabric, can't say which designer, the girl who sells me the fabric has to keep that a secret, OK, so I also wasn't wearing killer heels, mainly because who thinks to pack them for a five day mini break with teen daughter ? I also didn't have an expensive bag dangling from my forearm. The shopping mall and hotel, it's bars etc are full of posers, it's the place to be seen, but, like many extraordinarily beautiful girls, the heart inside isn't always so nice. I guess it's not the fault of the door girl, nor the guy at the bar which doubles as a night club...I guess they are told to keep the bogans out.
We were not wearing thongs, just not designer bling that I see on some in Singapore. My daughter is 17 , but she did pack on the makeup that night, yet the bouncer didn't let her in...devastated that her 50 year old mother wasn't asked for identification, Must get Botox. I'm writing this just as a friendly warning to future visitors, pack your designer duds, or else you can't get in. From what I can gather, don't forget your wallet too."
,,awesome view!,5.0,,"try to go there at night. the view from up there is indescribable, its to be seen to be believed. you can just stand there for hours and keep looking all around"
,,View,5.0,,"The skypark is perched right at the top of the building. The view from there is spectacular. The skyline of Singapore urban landscape is right in front of you.

There is also a club on this level. As expected the prices of drinks are rather on the high side compared to other places."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Very nice view from the bar. I was there a few times, been to the restaurant and bar before too. Both view is fascistic. The price tag is not cheap!!! A must go............."
,,"Stunning views, but don't pay for the ticket to get up",4.0,,"Stunning views and an incredible building mean this is a must, especially after dark. But don't buy a ticket to get up there. Go and line up to go to the bar and restaurant, Ku De Ta, and for the price of a drink (about the same price as a ticket) you get to view the skyline and have a cooling beverage."
,,Beauitful Hotel but Poor Skydeck,2.0,,We attended the sky deck during the day and I was disappointed as it seemed to be very hazy and couldn’t see a lot. The deck looks like it needs a good oil and freshen up. For $23.00 SGD per person for a single entry I was disappointed it wasn’t a very large area to access. They have a small area to buy frozen drinks and merchandise and a fancy restaurant area you can sit and have a meal and drink at. I personally think this would be better to visit at night and there are other places in Singapore to get an amazing view from that doesn’t cost so much.
,,Fabulous,4.0,,"A bit of messing around to get tickets ,prices $ 23 a bit steep, but incredible views , in house photographers a nuisance."
,,very good,4.0,,The three tall buildings with a boat on its top a Spectacular view. We enjoyed taking photographs here.
,,Skypark,3.0,,The building itself is a must see! Visible from many areas of the city. We didnt look inside but it looked so unusual you cannot take your eyes off it
,,Do Not Miss These Views,5.0,,Do not leave Singapore without experiencing the view from the 57th floor Skypark at MBS. Especially amazing at night.
,,Spectacular View,5.0,,The view from the top of Marina Bay sands Skypark cannot be beat. There is an infinity pool that allows you to feel suspended above the city and there is a restaurant and bar at the top. The elevator to the very top has a charge if you are not a hotel guest or dining at the restaurant but the fee is worth every penny just for the view of Singapore alone.
,,What a view,5.0,,you need to buy a ticket for the lift up to the viewing platform. You will have NO access to the restaurant. That is another lift . Ask inside at the hotel.. The view is spectacular...
,,The most beautiful place in spore,5.0,,"It's one of the most beautiful places in Singapore to visit. Lots of branded shops , casino , restaurants , cafe, food court , pharmacy , cold storage.......they have almost everything in there. It's always crowded with both tourists and locals."
,,Beautiful Views,5.0,,"Came here at night time and what breathtaking views there were. They put on a light show at 8pm and 9.30pm, each day. It would be best to see the light show from outside the hotel as you can't really see much up on the skyline rooftop. The rooftop restaurant was really nice"
,,SCENIC BEAUTY OF MBS,4.0,,Go up to 57th floor to CELAVI skybar where you can have the best 360 view of Singapore while sipping your cocktails. No cover charge needed. However you cant access the infinity pool as they only allow the hotel guests to go in.
,,Ahh the view,5.0,,Don't miss out on going up the 56 floors to take in the views across Singapore. It was hazy the day we were there but it didn't really matter. As we were there before New Years the lagoon below is full of white bouys put there by locals with their new year wishes. Quite a sight- almost sculptural to see.
,,Must see when you are in MBS,4.0,,Must see when you are in MBS. Great and spectacular view of the Marina Bay area and Raffles Place area.
,,Marina Bay restaurants,5.0,,"Three restaurants in this building but you need to book in advance, you can view the whole of Singapore from here BUT be aware its high up."
,,Best view....,5.0,,"Best ocean and garden view, have lunch at level 53, prices a little steep but it is worth it, service is impecable."
,,Singapore looks gorgeous from up here,5.0,,"We were staying at Marina Bay Sands so it was free for us. You shall get the best views from the top so I suggest it's worth the visit. Take a dip into their infinity pool before sunset and stay there until sunset.

It's pristine. Gamut of lights start to twinkle and their high-rises couldn't look any better. View of the Merlion to the view of the Quay is breathe taking."
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,This is a beautiful place to go to see the amazing views of Singapore. They have a lights show on each day 8pm and 9.30pm
,,Stunning views,4.0,,"If you want to experience the view (for free) go up Tower 1. You'll be able to see out each side with slightly restricted views.

We went up tower 3 and had a cocktail at the top. Drink was expensive but the views were terrific. One also has to admire the engineering of the spectacular structure. So on balance probably worth it. We left just as the sun set and the lights on the buildings opposite came on to provide another dramatic scene."
,,Beautiful Place,5.0,,"Really nice hotel and its prime attraction is the infinity pool on top. Several high end shops within the hotel and casino available for the guests. If you want to experience riding on a sports car, you can rent one here and have a couple of rounds around the area. A choice of expensive and inexpensive foods are also available."
,,A pool with a view,4.0,,The hotel was very good but the main plus of staying here is to swim in the infinity pool on the roof of the hotel with an amazing view over Singapore
,,Fantatsic View of the Bay!,5.0,,"This is one of my favorite spot to hang out! The view is WOW, drinks a little pricey but worth to be up there!"
,,Restricted to small corner of the Skypark only,2.0,,"If you are not a hotel guest, forget about walking round the Skypark - you are confined to one end only, although I don""t remember being told this, until I had paid the entrance fee. Still, the view from the Skypark, or as much as one can see, is good."
,,nice view cool spot,4.0,,having a drink and enjoying the view at kudeta is quite nice.. definitely a tourist must-do but it's a little too crowded and noisy to really hang out at.. i prefer one-altitude for that - i actually get to sit and chill there.
,,Its rainy day,4.0,,"So i arrived at mrt botanic garden but wait...its raining! Sigh...
I decide to continue to bayfront mrt when you can go to marina bay mall or garden by the bay without stepping outside
There's art science museum
Inside you can experience some kind of canal when you can take a boat like in venice"
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,This gives you spectacular views right across Singapore. Definitely worth a visit. You can stay up for as long as you like. Not for someone who isn't great with heights!
,,Good views but,3.0,,Was good to go up to the top but I think a bit expensive to be honest one shop selling souvenirs and drinks no where to sit and take in the views as they want you in and out even signs saying no sitting on deck but we did lol
,,Great,5.0,,This place never get old. It's always a very nice place to chill out and meet other people. There food is very yummy and they also have a a nice cocktails. Pina colada is one of my favorites. Gin tonic also is a must try. Nice view.
,,Too expensive,3.0,,"I did not actually go up because it was very expensive for a picture. There are other places in the city to see the view. If you go up to eat, you can avoid the cost of S28 per person but the restaurants are not cheap and the drinks can cost you! If you stay at the hotel, this is alright, since you are already staying there."
,,Flight Bar and Lounge at the SkyPark,5.0,,Great place for drinks overlooking wonderful night time views of Singapore. We were welcomed by a very courteous and attentive male staff to our seat.
,,good,5.0,,it's too expensive to go just in and see up of it so I prefer to see it around Raffels. so I couldn't say s.th important about it:))
,,Amazing for hotel guests; Okay for public visitors,4.0,,"For those staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, I would give it 5 stars. The view from the infinity pool makes it the best pool in the world that I've had the pleasure of swimming in. And you pretty much have the entire deck to soak in that skyline.

For outside guests, I would give it 3 stars. The observation deck is a bit pricey (around $20 USD), and you're relegated to just the northern tip of the skypark. The view from the top is nice, yes, but looking at Marina Bay Sands from Fullerton, Merlion Park, or the Waterfront Promenade is nicer!

As Karl Pilkonton once said, ""I'd rather live in a cave with a view of a palace than live in a palace with a view of a cave."""
,,Day and Night view of the city,4.0,,"You can view the city, Marina Bay and Barrage, Singapore Flyer and Garden By The Bay from the top of MBS Skypark. The night scene is also fantastic."
,,Rather expensive drinks!,5.0,,"We absolutely loved the view but were only able to visit the bar area as we weren't hotel guests. From here you could see the port area, Gardens by the bay and part of the city whereas guests had an extra viewing area which provided a wider view of the city as well. Make sure you have plenty of money if you want to buy a drink while you are up there as it cost $100 for 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers!!"
,,Great view,4.0,,"Me and my buddy were on the pub twice: once in daytime and once in nighttime. The nighttime experience was defiantly the best experience. Then you can see all the lights of the city, and it create a good atmosphere. The drinks are good, but a bit expensive compered to the prices in other bars."
,,mesmarise place,4.0,,"What a finishing and structure, really we all admire about their architectural finishing building. We our family are very much like and un doubtedly the place is iconic one ..."
,,SKY PARK EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"We stayed in the hotel, so could go in freely, its breathtaking enjoyed the view. Hats off to the engineering of this towers."
,,I stayed here and would not stay again,3.0,,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 weeks and found it very nice however there is room for improvements, the breakfast area was so crowded every day we had to wait to be seated for some length of time. There are better places to stay in my opinion, people come here for the name, try the Marina Mandarin or the Carlton service is much better."
,,Incredible Views from an Iconic Building,5.0,,"The stylized ship atop the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands is a Las Vegas-style attraction to this casino hotel that ""out Vegases Vegas."" The view is awesome and worth the price of admission."
,,"Great view, but very limited access",4.0,,"We went up to the visitor platform of the Marina Bay Sands and got nice views of the city, but much more limited than I remembered. Several years ago, I was able to walk along the whole length of the skypark, see the infinity pool, etc. Now you can only look around one side of the park, not much more than from the bar, which is free to access. It was not really worth the S$23."
,,"For first time visitors of Singapore, this is a must-see",5.0,,"OK this is as much about ticking off the box and getting the selfie more than anything else, but if you visit Singapore, its a must do for the view alone and to have experienced on of the iconic landmarks first hand."
,,A glimps of Singapore from the top ...,5.0,,"Great views of Singapore and nice bars. It is suitable for all kind of activities; for business. leisure, family, couples..."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Great view! We stayed at the MBS and went every night to the Skypark to enjoy the night view. It's iconic and very popular among locals and tourists
,,How high?,5.0,,If you have an aversion to heights stay away. The lifts are super fast but you don't have the feeling of moving. Fantastic panoramic views of the city.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Was worth every cent. Great view of the city and surrounds. It was absolutely amazing, would like to have seen it at night as well. The staff were fantastic."
,,Wonderful view great service,5.0,,"Absolutely loved our room ..... almost on the top level, stayed for a week....could have stayed longer. Oh and the pool was amazing. Nothing like sipping champagne on dusk admiring the lights!"
,,Mountaintop experience in the city,5.0,,"This is truly a must see and experience sight of Singapore. Within walking distance of the marina bay promenade this 57 story hotel complex has high end shops on the main floor. The roof is alike to a ship nesting on the roof. At this roof level there are viewing porches, and infinity pool (for hotel guests) and a bar. One can ask to go to the rooftop bar and then can use the express elevator to the top. The bar is marginal at best but one can still get a good view."
,,lovely views,4.0,,we went to the observation floor just at twilight. It was stunning. You can stay as long as you want and take loads of photos. To get into the bar or restaurant you need to enter a different way. However just the observation deck was great.
,,Nothing special,3.0,,"My title says it all. Go if you have spare cash. Just go up, stand around, not much space they allow you to wonder..."
,,Hazy and hot!,3.0,,"Good view, but again felt the cost was over the top! Can't say exactly how much we paid now to get in, but a photo cost between $35 and $55 each, depending on whether you wanted the leather frame with it or not. Rated, just ok!"
,,"if you do not go to skypark, then you did not see singapore",5.0,,we went late afternoon to be able to see Singapore at day light and at night in the same ticket.the view of the marine is marvelous from there at both times but especially at night .something surely not to be missed while in singapore
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,We went when it had been open only four months and we got to see and experience most of it but now maybe only half is open to walk around
,,Good for a long walk,4.0,,It's good for a long walk. Don't go on day time you will be fed up. Best is in the evening to visit.
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"I visited the skypark as soon as it opened at 9:30. It was nice to have so few people up there disturbing the view. This also allowed for great pictures! We only spent many 20 minutes observing the view and taking pictures, but you could easily spend an hour or more as there were many signs posted describing Singapore history and the view. There was a small concession stand located at the top. You will need separate reservation to eat at the very expensive restaurant. The bar is accessible with a minimum purchase of some amount. We paid just the S$23 to ride the elevator up....seemed too expensive but ultimately a fun experience."
,,Worth it for the View,5.0,,We went up to have a drink at night to take in the incredible views. This crazy looking building has one of the most breathtaking views and is definitely worth a trip.
,,A Memorable,5.0,,"What A hotel , what a service just world class. I spend around four hours in their flight sky 57. Just cannot forget it."
,,Great views of the city,4.0,,A great place to see all of Singapore. The cafe and photos are overpriced. Wonderful 360 degree views. Amazing to see must do even if afraid of heights.
,,Awesome Hotel,5.0,,"just great, out of the world experience, rooms are just great and so is the service. best is the swimming pool cant explain the experience, a must stay when you visit Singapore"
,,Visit to Singapore in July 2015,5.0,,"Amazing view of Central Business District, marina bay, Singapore flayer from 57th floor. 23 dollar fee for adults. A must visit."
,,Amazing View Of The Bay,5.0,,"Some years ago I was also in Infinity Pool at the the top of the builduing as a guest of this hotel, but this time I visited the top through the skypark. Note that you cannot go from here to the infinity pool but the view is worth to visit though."
,,360' Panoramic Singapore City and Harbour Views,5.0,,"Perched 200metres up in the air on an observation deck you will not be disappointed with the view. A good tip is to arrive just before sunset. That way you will see this amazing view in daylight and as the sunsets watch Singapore lights come to life ....just gorgeous! Marvel at the super trees as they come to life in the Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore flyer as it lights up and changes colour, the boats in the harbour as they light up,Singapore river and surrounds as they all come to life like fairy land! You won't be disappointed unless you are scared of heights!"
,,Amazing for views,5.0,,"Worth going up to share the views, go up tower one to the 57 th floor for free and then do the same in tower two, if you want to see the full length of the infinity pool go up after 12.30 am and pay for a drink in the bar almost the same price as just going to view"
,,the best view!,5.0,,"23 singapore dollars for the view worth millions of dollars! 56th floor withe the view on Marina Bay and the The Singapore Strait - a 105-kilometer long, 16-kilometer wide strait between the Strait of Malacca in the west and the South China Sea in the east. Beautifull during the day and even more beautifull after sunset."
,,Wonderful Stunning View,5.0,,"Stunning, especially while swimming, breathtaking view no words can describe this wonderful Marina Bay Sands Skypark. too bad the swim pool is not as huge as we expected. Strongly recommend to visit Marina Bay SAnd Skypark to have wonderful city view, sea view of Singapore"
,,expansive but a great place,5.0,,sky bar is such a great place! view is unbelivable. free entrance and until 6 pm it is allowed for men to come in with short
,,Lovely view,5.0,,"The view was fantastic. There is an overhead view of the Gardens by the Bay.

The signs clearly marked the direction of where to go, all the way from the MRT station Bayfront.

The tickets are $23 for adults - which is a bit on the steep side but the view is worth it. However, the photo is just exorbitant and I think it's better to take a selfie outside.

What was annoying was people bringing and setting up their tripods along the rails to take photos when it was expressly disallowed at the ground level and there are signs to that effect.

Overall, still, it was a nice day and managed to get some good pictures in."
,,Go to the bar to see the view,4.0,,"Instead of paying to go up for the observation, I went to the bar and ordered a great small hamburgers dish. It was way more interesting to sit there then just to walk on a deck. We had a great view of the city even though it rained heavily that day."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"The viewing deck is really beautiful. Whole Singapore can be seen from the deck. Not very crowded, and evenings are beautiful go see the sunset. Highly recommended for tourist. There is also a photo booth to take pictures. Abit costly to go up, so just worth for 1 time experience"
,,Expensive waste of time,2.0,,"We went to the bar at the top - had an incredibly expensive drink expecting to then walk;k round the rooftop terrace only to be told thie Skylark is reserved for hotel guests only. OK, but it would have been nice to have been told this before going to the top."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Three of us girls visited Marina Bay Sands Skypark and even had lunch at Sky 57. The views are incredible, you can even see the light show by gardens by the bay from the top!"
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"Looks Amazing from ground level, and the View when up on the observation deck is equally amazing. Where we were disappointed, was we were not allowed into the restaurant from the deck. Seems stupid to me to let you up there and then say, oh btw you can't come in here. We may of not had the right ticket, but for $23 i think it's a bit steep just as a viewing platform."
,,Wat a Superb tower,5.0,,"Great Tower to visit and the view from top is something which will give you some good memories of Singapore, you can see while Singapore from top"
,,drink on the top of singapore,5.0,,amazing experience of a life time to be pampered on top of singapore -57th floor - within the open air area a must do at singapore
,,Luxury Life Style,5.0,,"We visited the Skypark as a treat t ourselves as we wouldn't usually spend so much money on such a thing. But it was worth every penny , the view was amazing from the top and the bottom , the food was excellent , amazing service and all in all a perfect night would recommend this as a one of to everyone.
Cocktails in the Skybar were a favourite very expensive but expertly made!!"
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,You have to put this on your shortlist of places to visit. Views of Singapore are unbeatable and because you are not behind glass you can get good photos..
,,Went to roof top bar,4.0,,"Even if you are not staying, you can go by express lift to the bar on top! Drinks a bit pricy, but worth it for the experience and the views."
,,Must visit in Singapore,5.0,,Its a good experience. Im sure you will love it. Ticket price is $23 pp for 2-3 hrs. There is a light show on sky tower which can be see from merlion.
,,Great views,4.0,,My friends were keen to visit the viewing platform and so we paid our $20 to ride up in a lift to the 56th floor where the view over Singapore was incredible. Not a highlight of our trip but worth doing … once.
,,Amazing Architecture,5.0,,You have to be amazed by the space like quality of this building...it feels as if you have walked into Tomorrow Land.
,,Beauty at dizzying heights,5.0,,This place is at the top of many a visitor's list for a reason. The views are simply stunning. Make a reservation at any of the bars or restaurants up there and enjoy the views.
,,paid our $23 to get to the skydeck and what a wonderful view,5.0,,"took the lift to the sky deck and it was well worth it, the views were amazing, would like to go during the day a we only went of a night."
,,Visit a bar instead,3.0,,"There is a bar called ""Ce la vie"" next to the observation deck, free entrance and no dress code during lunch time. So if you want to see the view before sunset don't waste money for the observation deck and just come here for a drink, will be much cheaper and less tourists around. Entrance to the bar is located in Tower 3 next to entrance."
,,Misleading information and no shade!,3.0,,"We were planning on having lunch up there, but the ticket seller told us the restaurant up there was closed. So we had lunch elsewhere. But when we did go up afterwards, we saw that the restaurant was open and had been open the whole time! That was rather disappointing.

The view is amazing, but it's hot up there. Very hot and no shade! Something to remember if you have children or don't do well in heat. Sunscreen and water is a must up there."
,,How to get the view for free.,4.0,,"On entering the foyer, take the very first entry on the right hand side. Take the lift to the top and walk to the next level. You are able to access the bar area and view across the the Singapore River mouth payment. There is a restricted area open only to Hotel guests but not available to those getting the freebie."
,,One for the bucket list!,5.0,,Give the Observation Deck a miss and head for the bar on floor 57 for what has to be the best view in the world.
,,Amazing view and building,4.0,,"Definitely worth a visit whilst in Singapore.
We went to the viewing deck on the 56th floor and tickets were $22 each, the views of this amazing city are amazing, we spent about 45 mins just looking around with a drink, beers and soft drinks are available. There is information around the platform on what building are what and when they were built and so on.
As we went in December we had great views of the winterewonderland."
,,"Views, views, views",5.0,,"The views from here across Singapore are gorgeous. We went at 5.30 so could take in the views during day light and and night - both are very different. Personally we preferred the side where you could see the Gardens by the Bay as they are beautifully lit up at night. Stay to see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay (I think its at 7.45 and 8.45) - well worth it from so high up!

Note: there is a bar on a higher platform that you can access for free but you miss some of the views from there. Personally we preferred the views from the paid platform as you can look down as well as out."
,,Beautiful Hotel,5.0,,"Did not stay there, but wish we had for at least one night. Could not get up to have a drink as the ""men"" weren't properly!No shorts. We were going to go up and pay, but it was rainng so it would be iffy. You might get asked to leave because of lightning and then your $23 each, when we were there, would be forfited. Thats why we wanted to go up for a drink. However, the bar is not open until noon...go after that for a drink. Probably nearly the same price!"
,,Amazing experience,5.0,,View is stunning! Rooms are huge clean and perfect every corner. Staff all professional. Money wise of course it's expensive but worth it. Singapore is nice place to visit again and again.
,,Marian Bay Singapore a must see.,4.0,,"We were limited on time here, however it was clean, not to crowded and easily accessible via the MRT. Plenty of shopping and access to the Casino."
,,Beautifull but scary,4.0,,"At first - it was very difficult to find the entrance. The entrance is 29 S$ for a ride to 56th floor. View is amazing especially at night. If you are afraid of hights, it is scary. But still worth to see."
,,Great views and experience,3.0,,"Certainly a fantastic view and experience swimming in the horizon pool at that height, good restaurants and service there too, just gets quite crowded on Friday afternoons"
,,"Bar on 57th a mess, view was good",2.0,,"We went to the bar/restaurant on 57th floor. The views were impressive however the bar was dirty with food on tables that had not been cleaned, food scraps on floor and furniture, stains on furniture and carpet and staff the did not care when they saw us looking at the mess. We sat down on a sofa and arm chair and were handed menu and drinks list on the dirty table. This is the scruffiest bar/restaurant we have been to in Singapore. So happy we stayed at the Shangrila instead."
,,Skypark 56 Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,Fantastic view of Singapore City from 56th floor at night. The city was glittering all around. Gardens by bay looked wonderful. Only concern was ticket price which I found a bit expensive SGD 23 per person entrance only at Observatory deck
,,"Expensive, but worth it!",5.0,,"If you are not staying at this breathtaking hotel, it is still possible to take advantage of the views. As with most sights in Singapore, this one is best seen in the early morning or evening, as the heat and humidity can be quite unbearable during the day. The views are absolutely amazing from here, the lift is quick and very stable, and the people who work here are very friendly and accommodating. Try to sneak a peak at the pool and deck area (only accessible by hotel guests) - it will make you very jealous!"
,,City view in the sky!,5.0,,Loved the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands.. An awesome view of the city.. And can have a nice drink while checking out the view too..
,,Take the lift to the bar,4.0,,"Take the lift to the bar at the top, buy a drink instead of paying to go up to see the same views. We visited at dusk which was lovely to see Singapore starting to light up."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,Fantastic views of Singapore best enjoyed at night when you can see the amazing lights of the city beneath you.
,,amazing,5.0,,"the skypark is amazing, definitely a must if you are visiting Singapore and it is also a must to stay at Marina Bay Sands!"
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,"Amazing view from top, but quite expensive. $23 per adult to ride to the top. There is a nice bar/restaurant to enjoy the surrounds"
,,Decent view of Singapore,4.0,,We got in free as guests of Marina Bay Sands. Had a quick look around and the views are nice. Worth it if you want to see Marina Bay from up high.
,,The best 5 Stars Hotel in Singapore,5.0,,"On my last holidays I stayed at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore to check the hotel service and of course the infinity swimming pool, which is the reason why too many people go there just to stay overnight and enjoy the highest swimming pool on the world.
The check-in and check-out are really very organised and the staff are very polite. They start any conversation asking you sorry for any delay, even if you didn't wait any second for the service.
The bedroom is a 5 Star Hotel bedroom, you can find everything you need for your stay and have a very good night sleep.
The Gym is just a hotel gym equipped with basic fitness equipments, mostly treadmills. If you wish you can also pay and enjoy the hotel spa service.
At Rise Restaurant, the breakfast is amazing. A little different from occidental taste, but if you live overseas and like a hot continental breakfast you definitely will enjoy it.
The room service is really fast and efficient, it just takes a few minutes to deliver your orders.
The swimming pool is incredible. Swimming at the pool border or relax at a chaise is an unique experience.
Unfortunately the barman is not very good making cocktails, so if you want drink something ask for a beer or champagne.
My last concern is about the hotel complex, the hotel project is something for the total guest entertainment, so be careful when you are there, do not forget you are in a multicultural city with a lot of interesting things to visit and do.
My overall score for this hotel service and accommodation is 10 of 10."
,,Now that is what I call a view!,5.0,,We were tossing up whether to go on the Singapore Flyer or go to the top of the Mariner Bay Sands Skylark. The skylark won out for a couple of reasons. One it is taller than the top of the Singapore Flyer and two it was cheaper and we were watching how much we spent on sightseeing. I was able to take panoramic photos from the Skylark that took in the Singapore Skyline. We were able to buy some good quality souvenirs and a cold drink as it was very hot at the time of day we went there. Our only comment on nth down side was that there was nowhere to sit and take in the view which would have been good as we would have liked to spend more time up there. A professional photographer took out pic in front of a green screen and the backdrop once hehe pic was developed was the Mariner Bay Sands building lit up at night. We bought the photo as it lookedfantastic.
,,Best view over Singapore,5.0,,It is a little expensive at $23 but it is worth spending the money to see the best possible view over Singapore with all of its fantastic architecture and gardens. It only takes about an hour to get all your photos so no need to allow too much time.
,,Too crowded,3.0,,When this place first opened I am not sure how they did it but crowds were controlled. Now it is just a human soup with not a single spot in the pool available. Such a shame as was really special when first opened.
,,Rip off!,2.0,,"$23 per person for a single use ticket to the observation desk... No place to sit, no restaurant. Good views of Singapore, but at that price, definately not worth it! Spent all but 10 minutes up there..."
,,Great views,5.0,,amazing building - not too expensive either. Shame you can't go to the bar at the top too. But still a great place to visit.
,,"Shopping mall, casino & hotel",5.0,,"This place ia an all in one Shopping mall, casino & hotel and tourists attraction. On top of it there's one of the best sightseeing places in Singapore and the most famous swimming pool. You can only visit the sky park if you don't stay at the hotel."
,,Nice to visit for an afternoon,4.0,,Nice food and shopping. Very pretty walk around and beautiful evening city lights. Besides the casino there are nice restaurants
,,Awesome views!,5.0,,"Fabulous 360 views of this spectacular city; well worth the money to see it from this vantage point. We declined going on the Flyer (wheel) because this was so great, and much higher. Note there are certain areas without protective glass for better photos. Entrance is by tower 3, near the CÉ LA VI restaurant. PS: You can catch a glimpse of the hotel's infinity pool from one angle."
,,Truly amazing and unforgettable experience!breathtaking,5.0,,"This hotel building architecture is amazing. Swiming pool on the roof top, casinos and probably most luxurious and expensive hotel in Singapore. The view in the evening is amazing.Excellent and amazing view on the top,You can also go yo the 57th floor n have a drink at Ce La Vi,If you want to see the whole city of Singapore this is the place to go to. Located in Bayfront Avenue, Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
,,Super view.,5.0,,Don't miss this. Go to the top of the sky view and see panoramic city of Singapore. Althought it's such a hot weather but you will get a special photo with your love one.
,,Only good thing is the view and service,3.0,,"We are in tower 3 restaurant on the 57th floor, for lunch.

Excited about eating and being lovers of Asian food, Sat down and ordered a beef starter, salmon main with aubergine side. Beef got sent back twice, it made me feel sick, it was raw (that's fine, it's meant to be) but really fatty, the fat got stuck in my teeth, horrible. The aubergine was just oil and the fish was sickly.

The prices are silly, but you are paying for the view.

I used to be a chef and a good taster for a world wide concierge company, reviewing restaurants all over.

It was nice to see the view, I wouldn't come here again."
,,"Great views, particularly at sunset.",5.0,,"We visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark as part of an evening tour. Fortunately, the evening we were there -- after the sound and light show at the Super Trees -- the weather was clear, so the views were great. It wasn't too crowded, and there was endless opportunity for great photos. I particularly liked the views of the Marina Bay attractions and the stadium.

Hope you have the opportunity to enjoy it, but if the weather is not clear, it's not going to be worth it."
,,Very nice hotel,5.0,,"Very nice hotel with great scenery. View of Singapore is great. Easy accessible to Marina bay sands,explanade and certain places. Thumbs up stay with family."
,,The most impressive pool in the world,5.0,,"Eventhough the pool was extremele extremely crowded, it was worth searching for a lounge chair for 30 minutes. The view is magnificent. One of the most imoressive experiences of my life,"
,,Beautiful view and Shops,4.0,,"Near the Cruise Terminal for cruise ship passengers. Luxury shops, a great experience to see beautiful architecture and views"
,,Disappointing visibility on misty day,3.0,,"Had a drink in ce la vie bar up on sky deck to avoid observation platform fee. Drinks good but very expensive as expected.

Views would likely be great on a clear day but unfortunately we didn't have that. Worth a visit if only to see the vast marina bay sands hotel and shopping centre on the way.

Maybe not best backpacker budget activity."
,,Definitely a Bucket List Must,4.0,,This amazing structure takes your breath away. We took 3 grandsons to experience this unforgettable building. 19-yea-old must have taken hundreds of photos on his Iphone. A must stay to get to the Infinity pool on the 57th level - guests only entry.
,,Fore great views of the Singapore Skyline,5.0,,The hotel has a lift dedicated for visitors to go up to the Skypark. From the top you can view the Singapore Skyline.
,,For a great view of Singapore,5.0,,We went to the top of the hotel. It cost $23 to get to the top of the hotel. The view is splendid. Don't go on a rainy day.
,,Unique Hotel visit for Unique expireince.,5.0,,"When you want visit skypark you will have areal view of Singapore. When visit this place you will be able to see part of the hotel which is having unique design. It is having water transportation mall in the hotel like Venice. On the top floor there is Swimming pool but it is not open for public, only those who have checked in can have access to it. From the top you can get very nice view."
,,Worth a look for sure,4.0,,"Decided to go into the hotel to have a look for ourselves. Very confusing when you enter as incredibly busy foyer area with guests checking in, restaurants to visit and people looking as we were.

Found our way to the correct lift well to take us up to the Skydeck, only to learn that you have to be a guest of the hotel to get into the wider area with the infinity pool.

Had a drink at the bar sitting outside overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the Bay itself which was quite enjoyable.

I had my very first Singapore Sling and my wife tried the Sky Deck Sling, think the Singapore one won hands down, but both were nice.

Enjoyed the experience, just not really made to feel all that welcome as you weren't a guest of the hotel"
,,Ce la vi,4.0,,"If you need to go to the observation deck to get a view of the city there is no need buying the ticket which cost 23 Singapore dollars, just tell them you want to get a drink at the ce la vi restaurant which is at the roof top and if free. At least you get the view and the drink."
,,Worth it,5.0,,"Great view, amazing building, don't miss this attraction when you visit Singapore! Ps take sun protection it is exposed and can be quite hot."
,,Must visit attraction,5.0,,This is on the 57 th floor of the hotel encompassing all the three towers. You get a breath taking view of the marina... Great sight to the ships and boats from such a height. In the night the illumination of Singapore is a thrill to watch.
,,Excellent views,5.0,,"Enjoy the excellent views from the top. Not worth buying a ticket because if you go for a drink in the bar then there is free access, and the Singapore Sling in the bar on top costs less then the entrance fee."
,,Great view,4.0,,Amazing!! All the Singapore lights and the gardens by the bay ( lights start at 19.45)view makes it truly unique.the only reason why I gave it 4 stars :no smoking area provided!
,,The best view of Singapore,5.0,,It is located on the 57th floor of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel and offers an amazing view of Singapore. One can look at the city as well as its coastline with hundreds of ships. Best time to visit is at dawn so that you can enjoy the day as well as the night view. Also I believe that view from Skypark is much better than that from Singapore Flyer as the Flyer is not that high and is also located near to the Skypark.
,,Might As Well Go to the Bar,4.0,,Our party of 3 paid a hefty price to gain access to this lookout. We realized that just going to the bar for drinks offered a better view and was cheaper (no admission cost same view) so we did that too which effectively doubled our cost. The Super Tree show starts at 7:45 and 8:45 and the Skypark has a great view of it!
,,You have to visit at least once,5.0,,"The skybar is one of those places you have to visit once during your stay. Sure, drinks are expensive but just look at the view. Some areas are for hotel guests but the bar is easy to walk round and on a clear night you do get stunning views over the bay. The entrance is at the far end of the sky park and not that easy to find. Do persevere - better to pay for a drink than buy a viewing ticket"
,,Romantic pre dinner drinks,5.0,,"The hotel booked a table for us at Sky At 57. The view was spectacular, overlooking the city. The waitstaff were very friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend this too anyone wanting to do something a bit different"
,,Dont miss the view from the 57th floor,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore, do not miss the great view from the observation deck (Sky Park) of the 57th Floor of Marina Bay Sands. Extremely romantic and beautiful views. Not to be missed."
,,Busy but great views,5.0,,"Stayed in this hotel, skylark was brilliant, always busy and pool only open to hotel residents! A few bars/ restaurants to choose from, don't let it being busy put you off, this is going to be a big Singapore attraction for a long time to come!!"
,,Nice view,4.0,,"I was told there are three ways to get to the top, 1. being a resident, 2. Paying 23 dollars, or 3. going to the bar at the top and buying an over priced drink (16 dollars for a bottle of beer) but at least you have a view and a beer.
Unless your staying at the hotel you are restricted to a small area at one end, all be it ""the good end that over hangs""."
,,Go to Skybar,4.0,,"Great view form this rooftop skybox if you're lucky enough to get a clear day. SkyBar is separate to Skypark, but might as well go have a drink as the price is close to what you'll pay for Skypark view platform."
,,Fabulous views !,5.0,,We booked our ticket online but really no need to as you can get them easily at the Skypark box office. It so well worth doing this (I think we paid 20 SIngapore dollars each). The observation area is not very large but you get a spectacular view over Singapore - the day we went it was sunny and clear which was ideal so check the weather first as I do believe they close it if it's not good. You need a head for heights!
,,Nice. Amazing views,5.0,,"Have to walk a lot. Wear good shoes, water is must, n. Stay safe from sun, The MRT is useful. It's. Just near the gardens, also take a good camera for a lot of family photos. Nice backgrounds."
,,Too good,4.0,,This is amazing location in Singapore with world class infrastructure. All the international designer clothes are available here. One can even try out their luck in casino.To go to the deck they charge around 25 Singapore dollars.
,,Bring your visiting colleagues here,5.0,,"Rare views of Singapore guaranteed to be a hit with your visiting colleagues. Better yet, head up to the restaurant + bar just above the sky park for great views and drinks. The benefit of heading to the bar is that entry is free (you pay around 20 dollars per person if you go just to the sky park). You can get 2 beers for the same price and still enjoy the view. :) you're welcome."
,,VACATION,5.0,,"The view from the ship atop the three towers is mesmerizing. It is only 56 floors and the visitors are allowed to be at a portion of the skypark. High priced tickets. The rest of the area has a pool
and a restaurant etc. View is the best. Worth a visit."
,,Must See!,5.0,,"You can go the skypark or Go to the skybar and purchase a drink for the same views! Very trendy location, relaxed vibe. Perfect for a drink before a night out."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"We had drinks on the 54th floor ( I think ) whatever floor the nightclub was on and it was so good, the views were fantastic and the atmosphere was great, everybody having a great time, I have never experienced anything like it before, would recommend a visit"
,,Amazing view of Singapore city .,5.0,,The place cost a ticket to go if you are not staying in that hotel . But the view from this place Is unspeakable and at the night all the city was just lighting like stars. A must view place in Singapore . The merlion can also be viewed from the sky park .
,,Seeing Singapore from the best place.,4.0,,If you would like to see Singapore from high up then this is the place to go. $20+ to go up to the viewing deck.
,,Marina Bay Sands is Ghastly!,1.0,,Crowded and expensive. Not a spot of shade at the sky park. Just horrible - it's like and expensive train station .
,,Filled an afternoon on a business trip,5.0,,"WOW!!!! Talk about an astonishing view of this beautiful city...
Well worth the entry fee, even if your not up there for a long time. Took a couple of minutes to feel entirely comfortable after the rapid lift ride up, but once you get your ""sea legs"" the views take over. Amazing views of the city skyline, the newly developed gardens & all the ships out in the ocean...it has it all!!"
,,GET A CASINO CARD AND GET A DISCOUNT ON SKYPARK,5.0,,"Though didn't care for service in the casino, getting their membership card was worth as I was able to get a discount going up to the skypark (normally S$23) if you are not a guest. This view of the whole island from the top of one of most uniquely designed hotels ever is well worth trekking out to Marina Bay. Accessible by subway."
,,Do it,5.0,,"We stayed 3 nights in a club room.it was really busy on check in and we were ushered to the VIP check in and were in our room in 15 mins.
We had City views which were awesome. The rooms were clean, I'm not sure about the pressure things in the fridge which you will get billed if take something out for too long.
All of the staff I dealt with were very helpful, especially the staff on the club level 55. They addressed us by name each time. The breakfast was very good and the canapés in the arvo from 5-7 pm which included all drinks were the highlight of our stay, oh and also the pool! Who could forget that.
This is a place you have to go to once in your life and stay more than one day to get the full feel of the place."
,,Astonished view!,5.0,,Visited skypark with my wife. The view is spectacular! The prices are very very expensive there. tea costs 20 dollars. That is not OK.
,,At least once in the lifetime!!!,5.0,,"Luxurious place in Singapore with an amazing pool and skyline. The only way to swim in the pool is to reserve a room, otherwise you can pay few dollars just to visit the skypark."
,,Singapore is beautiful BUT very expensive.,3.0,,"I had a chance to visit the MBS Skypark because we stayed in MBS hotel for 3 nights. I was quite surprised that they allow people who are not staying in the hotel to be able to visit the Skypark, but I'm more surprised that they charge people 20+ dollars just to be there! I mean, yes, it's beautiful up there. But really, you'll just be on a very tall building.

Tip: I've read it somewhere that you can have a same view when you have a drink inside MBS restaurant. And it's cheaper too."
,,Worth the elevator ride,4.0,,"Yes, it might be a cliche in your Singapore experience, but it is definitely worth going here or the extra cosmopolitan feeling of Singapore. Have a cocktail at the bar while looking over the cities skyline. Great sushi also. The infinitely pool is unfortunatley only for hotel guests.."
,,Great view of the city!,4.0,,"The view is all worth it for 23 sgd! It is even more breathtaking at night (and cooler, too!) Buy drinks at the bar ( Singapore Sling, included). Take your time!"
,,Top of the world,5.0,,Best view of Singapore. Full 360 degree view from the top of Marina Bay Sands. Well worth the entrance fee.
,,Definitely visit at least once!,4.0,,"I visited sometime back but it probably hasn't changed much. Beautiful views that stretches very far out. It is free for hotel guest but you have to pay if you just want to visit. I believe it would be spectacular during fireworks night (National Day, New Year, Chinese New Year, etc) but it will probably be crowded and booked up.
The skypark offers 360 degree views. If you don't want to pay the fee to go up, you can visit some of the restaurants there (eg. Ce La Vi or Sky on 57) - you get to eat and enjoy the view (but I think you cannot walk all around) but only the part that the restaurant is facing."
,,Awesome !!!,4.0,,Walking around marina bay is awesome. You must bring your camera cause everything in there is awesome..
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands has to be the most breathtaking structure and five star hotel in Singapore. Not everyone can afford the luxury of staying here but well worth a visit
,,Spectacular.,5.0,,The rooftop skypark is an innovative achievement. The pool is an experience. The views from the infinity pool is impressive and nothing like it in the city or anywhere else in the world. The bars served good drings and service was great.
,,Great view,4.0,,"I can't tell you about the hotel, but given that it has an endless pool on the roof, I would love to stay here. What I can talk about is the deck, where you can enjoy a 360 degree view of the island. There is also a great bar that serves fantastic drinks. Plus there is a breeze here and that really helps in the hot and humid climate."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Beautiful! That's how I can describe my experience here. Walked though the park, took loads of photos and bought lots of souvenirs in the souvenir shop!!"
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"Great place for most of the day, but very crowded in the afternoon. Perhaps the best lace in town to watch the light show from."
,,Best Views Of The City,5.0,,"The views from the Skypark of Singapore Harbour and the city skyline are second to none.

The Skypark sits on one of the worlds great engineering marvels - The Marina Bay Sands hotel, and is an iconic symbol of Singapore. A case could be made to visit the Skypark two times - once during the day, and again in the evening to really see the splendor of Singapore's skyline at night. Unfortunately the Skypark comes with a steep admission price if you are not a guest of the hotel - so one visit is all the most people will want to make - although you might wish to go up late in the afternoon and stay until night descends......."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,There is a lot to see and do here. A lot of shopping at the mall and great sights all around. Many places to eat. This is beautiful especially at night. You can spend a whole day in this area.
,,Great view don't miss it,5.0,,"U better come at afternoon , twilight time.that you can see the view in light and out light at night. Great view both side."
,,Disapointed...,3.0,,"Very dramatic building, but hotel lobby way too crowded and cramped. Casino sub par (as I live in California we have local casinos and las vegas nearby, and the casino inside MBS lacked the amenities we're used to). The rooftop bar offered an amazing view of the city, even if the drinks were overpriced. The adjacent shopping center was impressive, although seemed to only sell upscale luxury brands."
,,Truly amazing and unforgettable experience!,5.0,,"The best view in Singapore, during the day and night. The building itself is stunning and it's worth it to go upstairs! Pick a day when it not not too hazy and you will not want to leave :-) Also don't forget to enjoy the night laser show at the Marina, the best place to watch is near the famous lion statue or the Fullerton Hotel."
,,Not good if you are afraid of heights,4.0,,Great place to go and see Singapore from. Sensational views from the 56th floor of Singapore. We went at night.
,,Go for aerial view of city,3.0,,"If you are not a guest staying at the hotel then most of the skypark is closed for you. You will practically see nothing of the infinity pool and in the area open to public after a fee, does not have a single seating space."
,,Beautiful singapore,5.0,,Loved maina bay sands must go to infinity pool!! Don't gardens by the bay waste of time but from far view gardens by the looks so beautiful don't go near by it.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,This was the highlight of our singapore trip. We went there around 530pm and stayed till about 8pm. The views of the city was absolutely stunning. We plan to stay at the hotel for our next singapore trip.
,,Stunning,5.0,,Stayed at this hotel amazing views from any vantage point. However areas are restricted if not a guest at the Hotel.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,We toured up to the 56th floor at night and the views of Singapore were amazing. Great atmosphere with great people.
,,Striking structure.,4.0,,Innovative and creative designed structure. Fabulous high end shops and restaurants. Huge front patio are overlooking waterfront
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,$20 to visit the top of this hotel and look out over the city. The views were stunning and well worth the trip. We did get caught in a rain storm and there aren't many places to shelter but it passed and we could see all around the city.
,,Expensive but Worth it,5.0,,The top of this amazing hotel is a fun activity. The drinks are expensive but its worth the trip There is also a swimming pool on the top for residents of the hotel
,,eye in the sky,5.0,,Fantastic all round view 280 Mrs up. small shop or resteraunt for food or drink but would expect it to get very busy in hight of season
,,Do not miss,5.0,,"To go up to the sky park, one does not need to be staying at the hotel. On tower three there is a ticket booth that sells tickets to everyone that wishes to go up.
From groups there's is the choice of taking a picture on the Basement before going up, they Photoshop the silhouette of the Marina Bay."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Its like a luxury liner floating in the sky! Breath taking views day or night. This is the focal point of Singapore. It is very expensive and the wine was dreadful but you don't visit somewhere like this every day.
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,It's a beautiful place and best is the sky park. It's just 20 bucks to go to the top. The access to pool side is restricted only to the guests of the hotel
,,What a hotel!,5.0,,"We asked the folks near the elevator if we could go up for a drink, and did not have to pay. From the top, you have one of the most amazing views in the world. Go in the night-time for the most impressive sights."
,,Excellent Views,5.0,,"Though there are 3 towers, walking from one end to the other takes remarkably little time. Once you are on the observation deck there is not time limit to enjoy the spectacular 360 degree views over Singapore. Definitely worth the trip."
,,Great view,5.0,,Observation deck fantastic view.Could have done with an area to sit for a drink apart from restaurant.
,,Fabulous location,5.0,,"A very pleasant lunch in the mall and a magnificent drink in the sky lounge made for a memorable afternoon.
For a panoramic view of Singapore you should not miss a chance to visit the sky bar at the roof of the Marina Bay Sands. Best view on town!"
,,Out of the world,5.0,,"This place is out of the world and a must visit in Singapore.

DO NOT MISS.

It offers amazing views of the bay area which looks really beautiful in the night on one side and on the other side, it overlooks the beautiful Gardens by the Bay"
,,Perfect place for a cocktail,4.0,,"We went for a drink on our first night in Singapore. You get a spectacular setting, with stunning views of the Gardens by the bay lit up at night. A very cool place to sip your drink."
,,Birthday,5.0,,Great view and choice for a unique dining experience! the view from level 57th allows guest to have a paranoma view of singapore!
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Went up to the top . Fantastic views . Would have been nice to have a few seats to sit and look at view but understand why they don't have any . Wanted to have a drink in bar but did not realise you needed a ticket which was available on ground floor., so think that should have been clearer . Still it did not spoil our time there . Fab place"
,,A giant structure and wonderful view in Skypark!,5.0,,"We have a drink at Skypark after we visit the supertree grove after dinner. Do remember to bring your passport if you would like to try your luck in casio.
The Marina Bay Sands is a giant building which I feel ""Wah"" when I entered the hotel.
The Sky Bar is on 57 floor with dressing code, and the view is great which you can see the Marina Bay/ Suntec City/ Fullerton.... The atmosphere is great for having a drink with friends!!"
,,Unbelievable amazing view,5.0,,In our trip we stopped for a drink on Skybar on Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It was superb experience and drinks are not too expensive. Just one favour for you. If you want to go for sky view and bar go directly to reception and tell them you are going for drinks. Otherwise they will ask you to buy ticket for platform to have a view which I think it's pointless. you rather spend your money for nice drink and have amazing pivs not just fee for pics to get on platform.
,,Well...,5.0,,"Massive building that this Marina Bay Sands hotel, had a long walk around in the park and the suroundings, interesting place to go , quite relaxing"
,,Sky high views,4.0,,Was recommended to get a lift to the 57th floor and have a drink at one of the bars if you wanted to see the views. Spent a very pleasant time sipping on a cocktail (not cheap but worth the ambience) and admiring the view. Was also able to see the infinity pool on the roof although only hotel guests can access it.
,,Stunning,4.0,,What a brilliant place and a stunning view! This is a must to visit and enjoy the pool in the sky and see all around views of Singapore. Totally unique experience
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,I recommend visiting this place in the evening to watch the sunset over the Singapore skyline. Not many places in Singapore are high enough for you to take in this kind of view.
,,Night time views,5.0,,"Pay for the night time visit s$28 for men women free entry ,you get a complimentary drink of you choice ad wow at the spectacular sights of night time Singapore from the roof top nightclub"
,,Unparalleled views,5.0,,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and got free access to the skypark. The viewing platform was very busy but the view it provides is amazing. We went at night and watched the night water show from here. The hotel shines lasers and lights and looks amazing.
,,superb views,4.0,,It is not worth paying for the viewing platform as the views are just the same from the bar while having a drink.It is definitely worth a visit to see all the iconic buildings of Singapore.
,,Expensive for what it is,3.0,,Bearing in mind you have access to a very small and compact viewing area only and not the full run of the Skypark as I had hoped for this is a very prices attraction. We paid $23 each to pop up to the viewing area and snap a few shots of the murky city landscape before returning to the mall within half hour. I would advise taking the Singapore Flyer instead as its a much better experience!
,,Awesome view despite the smog,4.0,,"This really is a must-do while in Singapore as the views are spectacular.
There are 2 options;
1. Pay $23 and get access to the viewing deck or
2. Request access to the bar/restaurant on the floor above
We opted for option 2 and I'm happy with the decision, despite the cost of 2 beers totalling almost $50. ( There were marginally cheaper options on the menu )
The view is a little more restricted as a result of the viewing deck extending wider than the top floor and access to a significant section of the top floor is restricted to hotel guests, however that being said it's well worth the visit. I can only imagine the view on a clear day. As a professional mariner I was stunned by the number of vessels visible anchored just off the coast."
,,An unexpected surprise,2.0,,"The place is really wonderful and worth the travel. Go to floor 57 and try to enter the circular promenade ; you are told that you must pay $23 and buy the ticket at the ground floor.
So I returned to the ground floor but did not return to level ; nevertheless, I could see a wonderful Singapore from the top ; not from the best place, but from a nice place."
,,Awesome vice of the Singapore skyline,5.0,,"This place offers the best view of Singapore at night. Always busy and buzzing, at times it gets too crowded especially the pool where you keep running into budding narcissists with their selfie sticks"
,,marina sky park,4.0,,good Singapore view. if you going to night time can able to see singapore view with lighting. now sky park swimming pool not allowed.. too expensive
,,amazing views!!!,5.0,,"It was one of the most beautiful and awesome experience in my life!!! If you visit Singapore, don't miss it!"
,,Great view of Singapore CBD and bay,4.0,,Visit during the day for the varoius architectural sturcutres and night for the CBD lights. The gardens by the bay offers a great view to the sky tree.
,,Spectacular views on a clear day,5.0,,This is a great experience from the super fast lift to the top and then the amazing views Of the city we went up in the evening and had drinks from the bar Singapore is beautiful !!
,,Have a beer on the top!,5.0,,"Don't spend so much money only to get to the viewing platform, but go to the bar/restaurant on the top and drink a beer there. The price is almost the same, the view is a bit better, cause you can see the big pool, but it is much cooler!"
,,Great views - Must do!,4.0,,do this early in your visit to Singapore so you get the layout of the area. It is quite inspiring to see all the ships as well as the Singapore downtown itself. Definitely worth the cost though we didn't stay long. You can do lunch/drinks as well. Suggest doing that if you have more time.
,,Very high up but breathtaking,4.0,,We were on honeymoon in singapore and really enjoyed the view from the top. You dont have access to the pool as you are not a guest but there is a bar and the detailed info about what you are saying really helps. Definitely a must see
,,view to die for,5.0,,"i was lucky enough to be a hotel guest so it was free of charge to swimm on the top and see the view as well. Loved the infinity pool, not really crowded and great vibe. It's a must for all luxury enthusiasts."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"An area and building is a must see. The area is also good, but to view this building close is something special. And there is a casino close, for those adventurous!"
,,City and Gardens night view,4.0,,"There are various ways to see the City and Gardens from this fantastic view. Check into the hotel or visit one of the restaurant/bars at the top. From the top you have both views, the city sky lights and Gardens by the Bay. We were lucky that the haze was minimal and the sky was clear.Spent just over an hour at the bar in Tower 2 and had a drink. Service was excellent and the drinks were priced accordingly."
,,Hmmm must see,3.0,,Worth a visit for views and unusual sight. I didn't try the restaurant but probably worth going to try this and the infinity pool next time.
,,Beautiful views but VERY pretentious...,3.0,,"My wife and I visited here with a friend as it's something you feel you have to do while in Singapore. However I found the staff had quite an air of superiority about them especially the security staff which put a bit of a dampener on the experience.

Other then that the bar and views were spectacular. I'd advise heading to the bar for a drink rather then paying the $25 entrance fee for the viewing platform."
,,Best in the World,5.0,,"This hotel building architecture is amazing. Swiming pool on the roof top, casinos and probably most luxurious and expensive hotel in Singapore. The view in the evening is amazing."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"The views of Singapore are absolutely amazing from here,it was lovely and quiet when we went. There is plenty of room for loads of people,very much worth a visit."
,,Nice view of the city,4.0,,Not cheap but a great touristy thing to do while in Singapore. We visited right on dusk on a clear day & stayed till dark when all the city lights came on. Good fun had by all.
,,Marina Bay Sands on the cheap.,3.0,,"Whilst in the area, we dropped in to Marina Bay Sands to check the view from the top deck.
We were advised at the Ground Floor Concierge Desk that there was a rooftop pool for the residents, a fine-dining restaurant (with dress code) at one end and there was a bar (with a cover charge, which included one ""free"" drink) at the other end.

En route to the bar for a drink and to check out the view, we started talking to a staff member and mentioned we just wanted to look at the view. They advised that there were two areas where you could check out the view on either side of the structure without even going to the bar. We checked their suggestions first and found that the view was severely hampered by the Singapore haze from the Indonesian fires at the time.

Given this, we decided that we didn't really need the drink and returned to our hotel. Total cost: $0."
,,Observation Deck to Marina Sands Skypark,5.0,,"Excellent and amazing view on the top. The lift up to the deck was so fast, in just a minute, you already on the top of this observation deck. We went up there at nights, sceneries of whole Singapore was so breathtaking and wonderful as if you are on top of the world. Is worth the value of money to go up this deck."
,,Get to the top!! Save $$ by going to the bar vice view deck!!,4.0,,"If you go to the bar/restaurant, you will enjoy the SAME VIEW without having to pay. But, if you do get a drink or appetizer, be ready to shell it out!!"
,,really impressive huge hotel building,5.0,,"It is must visit hotel even if you dont book your stay there.
This building architecture i the real beauty.
Sky park (balcony on top to see the singapore view from height) is open for outside visitors but hotel do charge you something around 23 SGD per person.
Swimming pool at the top is open only for hotel guests.
If you want to enjoy top of hotel without payin extra, just go to sky bar and grab a bear of 18 SGD and hav sips for an hour or two standing at the tip of bar balcony. You will enjoy same view rather better view than skypark. Make sure that you reach by 4pm to the sky bar so you will get enough space to stand."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Amazing views of Singapore from the skydeck. As we were up there we watched a storm roll in and all the lightning looked awesome from up there. Definitely worth a visit.
,,We can say we've been there?,3.0,,"You can see this from everywhere and is one of the boxes to thick when in Singapore. Unless your staying there, other than the views there's nothing up there, no shade, no seating no bar no restaurant, only overpriced souvenirs or warm beer in plastic cups all at stupid prices. Glad we can say we've done it, but not again."
,,Incredible Views,4.0,,"This was the first place we visited upon arrival in Singapore and thought it was excellent. Costing $23 to enter it is a cheaper option than the adjacent Singapore Flyer and I'm sure it gives you much better views. Speaking of which, the views are incredible! The only disappointment is that there is nowhere to sit at all once you are up there. A couple of benches would allow you to take a seat whilst having one of the drinks bought from the kiosk."
,,Beautyfull view,5.0,,I visited this place in November.its good tourist attraction.if you want go to the top if the terasse then you have to pay about 26 doller and only you are allowed to stay about one hour there.onece if you are on the top of terasse then you will see the whole Singapoor City. Its with to visite this place.
,,Views to die for,5.0,,Must do if you visit Singapore. It is the centre of attraction on the bay. You just cannot miss it. You can also go yo the 57th floor n have a drink at Ce La Vi
,,A unique structure with a great view,5.0,,The Observation Deck on the 56th floor of this unique hotel provides a panoramic view of all the Singapore major attractions. It is well worth a visit.
,,Singapore City View,5.0,,"If you want to see the whole city of Singapore this is the place to go to. Located in Bayfront Avenue, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, There is fee going up on the 56th floor. I suggest to go there around 6pm to see the city in the day and wait till sunset to see the city lights."
,,Amazing service and good!,5.0,,"Restaurant ""Ce la vi"" worth every penny you spend....food, service, hospitality, environment, view from the terrace....all was simply amazing! We had a wonderful experience there. ...we will def go back.

We were served by Rita. Thank you Rita for making my father in law's birthday day so great."
,,Great panorama city views,5.0,,Amazing 360 degree panorama city view. Nice place to take pictures and even better place to watch the sun set. It was a great add on on top of the amazing infinity pool. Would definitely recommend it if you are on a budget and decide not to stay at the hotel itself.
,,"Amazing hotels,casino & infinty pool",4.0,,Two Very large hotels with a casino in the middle Wonderful restaurant / bar for visitors as well as guests Very las Vegas style property which has an infinity pool on37th floor with view of the city!
,,Don't miss the night view,5.0,,Agree that the best time is to go before sunset and stay till the Singapore night lights come on. Gorgeous views for there. There are musical fountains that can be viewed from there later at night as well.
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore,5.0,,The ideal time to visit is just before sunset and then stay on till the Singapore night lights come on. The view is amazing and it is also a beautiful photo-op. We were also happily surprised to find out that NTUC card members get discounts! Must visit if you are in Singapore
,,wonderful but crowded,3.0,,"too many people, the pool somewhat did not really make us feel comfortable, so crowded, other than that great view from the top, bit scared to swim to the edge, for those who are afraid of height, not recommended, for those who like selfie, highly recommended :)"
,,Great view but you pay the price,4.0,,"Undoubtedly the view from here is fantastic but it comes with a hefty price. So instead of paying the entrance fee just for the view, I went into the bar and ordered a meal so at least I'm getting food and a view! Sunset is the best time for views. The place is alway very busy so beware that you might have to fight for a spot to take a picture."
,,Very crowded Busy and expensive,3.0,,"We went there to go on the top of the hotel , found lobby was very crowded and busy waited to get help, change our mind to come other time probably in the evening when light are turn on we were told by other travelers that there is fee to go on top floor of the hotel."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,This is a must visit! The views are incredible. Great bar for drinks and something to pick on - the sushi is great here also.
,,Incredible hotel and view!,5.0,,"The hotel is amazing, although too noisy because of too many guests. the view from the Skypark is amazing. Choose night times!!"
,,Nice view of the city,4.0,,"One should visit Marina Bay Sands for a mesmerizing view of the city line. It is higher than Singapore Flyer. However, the ticket of S$23 piches the pocket."
,,Amazing views but expensive,5.0,,A highlight best visited at sunset or night time. Amazing views but expensive. I suggest heading straight to the 57 floor and just saying that you are staying at hotel to avoid the $25 charge. Be warned also that you cant get into the bar nor the pool... so it really is the view only
,,Great place,3.0,,"Always visited this place in December. First time I visited this place was not too crowded. A year later, it was very crowded. Many visitors from all around the world made all visitors cannot enjoy this place."
,,overrated,2.0,,this place is so overrated extremely expensive for everything accommodation food drinks etc . service and staff we encountered were invariably poor unhelpful not trained properly .much better hotels in town centre
,,A must-see for visitors!,5.0,,"Some cash, go to Tower A and go down the escalator beside the taxi stand, buy the ticket and you can view the skypark and enjoy the breathtaking view of almost the whole of Singapore."
,,A very big hotel,3.0,,"Very good staff, serviceminded and efficient. Normal room without any fancy stuff, with a fantastic view over the city. Crowded in the lobby, crowded in the lifts, crowded at the rooftop pool."
,,Enjoy TOP view!,5.0,,YEs! MBS skypark lets you enjoy the top view of marina bay and gardens by the bay. Been there 2 times and still appreciate the place. =)
,,Disneyland.,4.0,,"It is huge, you get lost each time. The Spago is great choice. It is a nice place to visit, a must in Singapore-"
,,Marina Bay Skypark,1.0,,I wouldn't waste my money going there because if you aren't a guest of Marina Bay Sands you can only see part of the skypark and for $23.00 was way too expensive for what we saw
,,View Singapore on a Higher Plain,4.0,,"The view is stunning. I realize that the observation platform is higher than the Singapore Flyer, so you get a wider view of the Singapore skyline. From the deck, one can identify the prominent buildings that serve as testimony to the development of Singapore."
,,Undoubtedly it offers the best view of the city.,4.0,,"Undoubtedly it offers the best view of the city. The tickets are expensive, but if you have good company, this is the place for a little coffee, a little breeze (in fact a lot of breeze), a little chat and superb view. The city is blessed to have been constructed alongside the sea front. Once again, the view is excellent."
,,Great views from the top!,4.0,,Booze fairly expensive (it's Singapore remember) but service and views are worth going. You are not allowed near the pool area unless you're a hotel guest.
,,Great views of the city,5.0,,"Visited this attraction whilst staying at the hotel and the views of the city were great. Ample sunbeds, great service and didn't feel too crowded."
,,A most do in Singapore.,5.0,,At the price of $23 we thought twice about it. But then we figure we are only here once. Paid the price and up we went. Not much haze so the views were amazing.myou can stay up there as long as you want. Evening would be great to watch the light show in the gardens at 7.45 or 8.45. So. We are pleased we went up and saw. Worth the look.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Dine or just have a drink at Skypark. We just went for a drink and to look at the view, unfortunately the smog did hamper the view but it was still amazing. On a clear day I should think it would be fantastic."
,,Forget the observation deck.....,5.0,,"The best way to enjoy the view up here is from the bar! It sits above the observation deck and is free to get to - a drink at £10 a pint also works out cheaper.

The hotel inside is incredible and worth a look on its own; we took the lift to the top and were given 2 for 1 drinks vouchers which really made this a cheap activity. The view is unrivalled and despite the haze you get the best view of the city and off across the ocean.

The bar has comfy sofas along with tables and you can sneak a peak down the length of the hotel to look at the pool - not managed to stay there yet!"
,,STUNNING PLACE,5.0,,A must do if you go to Singapore especially at night! One of the most beautiful cities I've seen! Not something you will see anywhere else in the world! :)
,,What a view,5.0,,The view over Singapore is amazing. We decided to buy a drink on level 57 which gave us a view of the infinity pool. The whole complex is an architectural wonder
,,Stunning views,4.0,,"This is one of those things you just have to do when you are in Singapore. You are limited to only a relatively small observation deck if you are not a hotel resident. However, it is still amazing to see the city from 57 stories up. The express elevator whisks you to the top in no time at all. It does cosy something like S$23 each, but I would say it is definitely worth paying to do this."
,,Must visit to appreciate the grandeur of the architecture,4.0,,This is an awe inspiring development. The skypark is not a cheap place to visit. We went during the afternoon on a Friday No queuing. Downside was the Indonesian haze. Views from the 57th floor are truly worth the visit. Easy access by MRT or water taxi
,,For the ladies - go there on wednesday!,4.0,,"Okay, please follow up this tip! In the afternoon / evening you can visit the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands Hotel (the ""ship"").. for $23. On wednesday evening there's a party in Ce La Vi on that same rooftop, free entrance (and shots) for the ladies. Please go there and save yourself 23 bucks, the night view is wonderful :)"
,,A must do !,5.0,,The best place we could see Singapore skyline and the views were spectacular and amazing. This is a must do !
,,Super View of Singapore !!!,5.0,,"- View of Singapore from 57 Floors above. Awesome !!!! - Night View is Ecstatic - Complete 360 Degree view of Singapore - Awesome Experience , One time Visit."
,,A one of the modern world's wonder.,5.0,,Book Marina Bay Sands hotel with a pool access. One night is not enough. Try to catch a sunny day. But in the evening it also has fantastic panoramic view. Take a coconut cocktail. Just relax near the pool in a bathrobe after long flight or a hectic day.
,,Part of the trips,4.0,,After we've done flowers dome and cloud forest. We walk forward to Marina Bay Sands. This Skywalk let's us see all those area in the high point.
,,GREAT VIEWS.,4.0,,"this is a MASSIVE hotel built in 3 towers. It isn't particularly cheap tourist spot, but the views are wonderful. Unfortunately, the view wasn't as clear as it should have been, because there was pollution because of the Sumatrans burning vast areas of forest.
But they charged ridiculous amounts for photos they took, SQ$52!!!"
,,Superb Views,5.0,,Must do on trip to Singapore ... Even if you have to repeat it .. its worth every penny ... views are class .. i think you can skip the Singapore flyer and instead go to Marina Bay Skypark as its more higher ....
,,Not Value During Smog Period,2.0,,"We decided to go to the viewing deck during the smog period but the view was not great - we should have cottoned on when the sales desk went out of their way to say that no refunds were given, but forgot to mention that the view was poor as they took our money. Somebody said if you go to the bar its free but have to buy a drink."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Great Views, but not a massive area and gets very busy around Dusk and prior to the light shows. Small shop at the top to buys drinks."
,,Definitely a one-off,2.0,,"Nice view but hardly worth the price of admission. I'd be more inclined to go again if you could swim in the infinity pool, but you have to be a hotel guest to access anywhere other than the observation deck."
,,"Awesome structure, amazing design and architecture",5.0,,This is such an amazing property. If you have any interest in design and architecture you will be very happy to see this hotel. The Skypark is truly a modern wonder of the world. You have to be a guest to get out to the incredible rooftop infinity pool though.
,,A Fantastic View,4.0,,"We went to the Skypark after 6pm to see the beautiful view. It definitely lived up to it's name. The price was reasonable and the waiting time to go in the lift was reasonable. If you wish to enjoy a beverage after 6pm, male guests need to wear trousers, which we didn't know until we arrived, before 6pm, shorts are fine. It was a lovely view, but I would have liked to enjoy a drink whilst looking at it."
,,mesmerized,5.0,,"Although pricey, it is worth going since Singapore seems like heaven at the height and the view was amazing."
,,Superb,4.0,,Great view from the top. Theres an entrance fee but worth it...beautiful views specially in the evening. All the landmarks are clearly visible on a clear day. Excellent for photo ops.
,,Night to Remember,5.0,,Sky Bar is an amazing party place and a must visit for people looking for fun and friends. Great Views and rocking DJ.
,,Small place,3.0,,Actually this view is good. But the bridge is not long enough. And we had a limited time to enjoy this view (only 15mins). You shouls pay more to enjoy this.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is just an architecture marvel, am amazing place to soak the sun relax and enjoy the view all around the Skypark. Get a drink at Spago, great mix drinks."
,,Cool place... but,4.0,,"I might be cheapo but $30 or so to ride up an elevator and see a very humid clouded view.... not my cup of tea. Travel Hint. If you get a drink of snack at the bar up top your elevator ride is free, so spend $20 on a drink and save $10 on the elevator ride."
,,A MUST VISIT ACTUAL SINGAPORE,5.0,,Awesome view from upper deck to see whole Singapore it feels amazing to be there.there are charges to go up but its worthfull
,,Superb Place,5.0,,Must watch place.. Really enjoyed a lot from 57th floor. Superb view of Singapore from top. Giving 5 Star...
,,You dont get to visit the infinity pool,3.0,,For 28$ its just the sky deck. You can see entire Singapore from there. You can see the infinity pool from a distance of 150m that too a small glimpse of it.
,,Nice pool,3.0,,"The hotel is ok, but the nicest thing about this hotel for me was the infiniti pool, there are quite a few hotels that are the same standard if not better, the pool makes the difference."
,,A must do,5.0,,Enjoyed the visit to the Skypark. There is a fee to the top however views are spectacular and well worth the fee. It is just a lovely place to visit and see how the other half holiday.
,,The place to be !,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands is the latest and most happening place to be while in Singapore. Has a massive swimming pool stretching over the towers - a unique and very exciting sight !
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,"We visited here for the view from the top of building really, we we not guests at the hotel so we paid $23.00 each to go up there. The views are wonderful, we had a clear day too, it had been quite hazy the day before due to Indonesian fires.
We visited the restaurant too, after we had permission to enter, we were looked over and up and down first to see if we were respectable enough!!
The snack meal was delicious, but tiny portions, no surprise there though.
Another couple sat with us for a while chatting, and they hadn't had to pay at all!! So if you are going there, go to the elevator and press the button to the top floor! Don't ask any of the concierge, they make us pay!
Overall though, a really lovely experience."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,You can't visit Singapore without visiting the Marina Bay Sands. A stunning location with breath-taking views of Singapore. We took the lifts to level 57 and took in the beautiful views whikst taking pics. A definite must-see on an visitor's to-do-list!
,,Awesome view,5.0,,The skypark can be accessed near the Marina Bay tower 3 underground area. The elevator within seconds takes you directly to the 57th floor. The bird-eye view of the surrounding area is spectacular
,,Go there for a great view!,4.0,,Visit the hotel and take the Ce La Vie elevator to up to the 57th floor to enjoy an amazing view - free! There is another option that costs you Sing $ 23 per person but takes you - basically - to the same floor.
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,Amazing view of Singapore from this skydeck. Best time to visit is around 5-6pm so that city can be seen in daylight as well at night.
,,Really cool,5.0,,Good place to visit. Its take away the tiredness. Visit in the night/ evening time its really bustling with crowds and shows are good here too.
,,Something I would never expect to do at this stage of life,5.0,,Wow experience. Scared at first but once in the bubble the experience starts. Take a camera and get the wow factor going. October with so much smoke in the areas from Indonesian burn offs not a good time but still awesome. It doesn't wihizz around so you get a wonderful view. A must do ride loved it
,,A waste of money,2.0,,"For $23SD per person experience the thrill of travelling in a lift, standing on some decking looking over a very hazy Singapore and watching the people who can afford $1000 per night eat and drink in the restaurant which you're not allowed to enter. Skypark? No park about it. Be honest and call it a Skydeck because that's all it is. I didn't expect to be able to swim in the pool as it is obviously a guest perk, but somewhere to sit and have a cool drink would have been nice, and I would have paid the premium to do so. Three days previously, I was in Japan at the Skytree Tower, one of the tallest buildings in the world. It was an amazing experience and didn't cost much more than the Skypark. I sat in the cafe there 345m in the air looking over Tokyo enjoying coffee and cake. This was the first time I have visited Singapore and I loved all of it...except this :("
,,Heart beating fast,5.0,,"Give a try and worth paying it for such a stunning views, you get there to the top will have a whole view of Singapore but if you have heart attack better not."
,,Great views,4.0,,Spent a few hours up here and well worth the entry to view to sample the great views try to get here early to beat the rush.
,,Great views of city,4.0,,"Go there before dawn, so you get the views in daylight and nighttime. Not the cheapest activity, but worth it. It gives you a fine overview of the city. Watch out for the haze between sept-oct"
,,Great View......,4.0,,"This is a great visitor attraction, albeit, we feel it is slightly over-priced. The views are pretty spectacular, however there is little else on the observation deck, which could do with a decent snack/drink bar, as it can get pretty warm and humid up there.
There is the usual attempt to try to get you to part with your money for photographs, where you are superimposed on a shot of the hotel, but the prices were a bit high, for what were average photos. Definitely worth a visit, after which you can visit a great shopping mall opposite, which is fully air-conditioned and has every store possible."
,,not recommended to visit till Haze clears,3.0,,Went there on 23rd Oct. It was too hazy. the viewing distance was very short. It is not recommended to visit this place till Haze clears.
,,Amazing view of the city,4.0,,"It was wrong time this year to come to Singapore with haze from neighbourhood country. However, it was still worthwhile to play a visit to the top floor of Marine Bay Sands. The view is fantastic to overview the city and the water. It was so enjoyable to have afternoon tea there. It will be very nice if air and sky are clean."
,,A Singapore must do,4.0,,"Well worth the price. The observation deck is 57 floors up overlooking the Bay, the gardens, etc. A little hard to find your way to the entrance the first time, perhaps ask your hotel for some specific directions."
,,It is a cool place,4.0,,"The place is so beautiful, specially when you look from up hight the building. There are stores to sell food, drinks and gifts. It is better to have friends or family with you to take photos. Make sure to visit the place during the week to avoid the crowd. I can say that the ticket is expensive. Do not make it a priority to visit,put it at the end of it as it is not impressive for many people however the place is good for contemplating."
,,Nothing Special,3.0,,"This venture offers a 5-star view, however, the venue is poorly appointed, there is little in the way of entertainment at the top, would have been nice to have seen a cocktail bar or cafe. In comparison to similar attractions such as the 'Burj Khalifa at the top' experience, the sky park fell short across a number of criteria.

An additional note: Due to severe hazing across the region the view can often be impaired - would be nice to see the arranging party take this into account with relation to the price, Student pricing would also be a plus!"
,,Over rated,3.0,,"Nothing to shout about. Been once and its enough. During its peak, the pool is packed and you hardly can swim or even dipped in the pool. No wow factor for the price you pay. Fortunately im the resident and not limited to time. There's cafe, bar and restaurants. Amazing 360° view from bay to city.
Will i be back? Ermmmm i dont think so unless someone is paying for me"
,,A big price for a view.,1.0,,$23 just to stand on a deck and look around. Couldn't have a beer and a decent bite to eat. Just a small Cafe selling soft drink and snacks........................................................
,,Nothing special,3.0,,Would recommend u to go to singapore flyer get better view then the skypark so far we can not access the swimming pool since it is a private area for guest.. Hmmm
,,Visit to Skypark,5.0,,"An absolute must, visit the observation platform and the Marina shopping mall, go on a night to see Singapore light up"
,,Experience of a life time,5.0,,"It's indeed a dream come true to be on the Sky Park of Marina Bay Sands , Singapore on the 57th floor. Words are limited to explain the feeling. One has to experience it as if floating in mid of earth and sky!!"
,,Loved it all,5.0,,Fantastic place to visit - the great view over the city skyline rom the sky park is priceless at night. After that you can go through the hotel itself on a high walkway to get to an overlook of the Supertrees in the Gardens by the Bay. If all that made you thirsty head up to the rooftop Skybar for an amazing view over the whole city. Be sure to let them know you're just going to the bar rather than the restaurant or night club and you can skip the queue. Ladies get a coupon for a free drink Wednesday's.
,,Great view over the city,1.0,,"This hotel has a great view over the city. If you visit by day you have to buy a ticket to go to the top, and if you decide to have a drink in the sky bar, take out a bank loan.
Book a dinner in the evening to see the city lit up, The entry fee is waived, the menu is not as good as you may expect from a hotel of this calibre. The food was nothing to write home about."
,,An amazing place!!,5.0,,"I love the way you can walk through this building which is totally amazing with it's slanting walls, space ship on top and nothing but space in the middle on the inside, from the Gardens by the Bay to the Marina Bay Plaza. It blew my mind!!!! Nothing like that in Perth, Western Australia!!! Just another ingenious building in Singapore!! I loved the whole area and it doesn't cost a penny unless of course you go shopping!!:))"
,,Awesome View!,5.0,,A great place to visit if you travelling to Singapura.On this highest peak you be able to see the skyline and all the building surrounding the area.Worth visiting!
,,Ce La Vie,4.0,,"We dined on the rooftop restaurant and while good and maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, it was a good destination. Prices are expensive however the setting is incredible. Better restaurants to be fond however the setting is most appetizing"
,,simply breathtaking,5.0,,"walked and enjoyed the view. Not much more to add, it is worth the heat humidity and all the sweating"
,,Nice view. Marina bay staff could be friendlier,4.0,,S $23 each. Provided us with a great view of singapore. An hour is plenty to experience it. We left it as late as possible in our stay hoping for the haze to clear and were rewarded on our last day which clear bright skies
,,Visit Ce La Vie instead,3.0,,If youre with friends and would want a skyline view go to ce la vie instead. Its a bar located on ther 57th floor. You have to pay 23 sgd to go to skypark observation deck why not pay for a drink and get cozy at the bar instead cocktaik drinks are around 24sgd. Then you get to enjoy both ambience and a good drink. :)
,,Almost the de rigueur selfie spot,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands has become probably the most iconic building of the Singapore city skyline and a photo or selfie on the Sky Park has become de rigueur for many tourists. It is also a favourite photo shoot location for many celebrities visiting Singapore.

The SkyPark offers spectacular views of Singapore's modern city skyline, especially on a clear night. The day view is good too, but I prefer the night.

But there's often a queue to get up, and it's not easy to get a table at the restaurant and bar.

I wouldn't rate it as a ""must go"" but certainly worth a visit."
,,An idea of Singapore's layout,5.0,,"During our vist there was haze because of fire in Malaysia or Indonesia forests. But anyway I did like our visit.
You should enter any of three Marina Bay Sands towers and check the hotel from inside first. There are also some caffes and free WC. :)
Walk to the Tower 3. Follow the signs ""Skypark"". As soon as you go outside the building, make left. You will find ticketing desks. The single ticket to observation platform will cost you 23 SGD.
I think this is better than the ""Flyer of Singapore"", because this is still higher :)
I need to mention, that observation platform is not so big and you are not allowed to see the famous swiming pool on the roof top, but anyway I would recomend this attraction.
And yes, there is a caffe, if you need to have a drink looking at the city from the clouds :$"
,,Can be skipped,2.0,,Of course being in Singapore you have to MBS to have a drink next to the Pool. We wanted to do a drink quickly before the show and started of with a beer and a G@T and ended up paying 40 Sing dollars for 2 drinks. We know Singapore drinks are expensive and you pay for the spots but no need to pay it there. Hope over to the Mandarin for a drink in their Bar or have a iconic Singapore at the Raffles way more fun.
,,Best View of Singapore City,5.0,,Sky Park has the best view of the city. It's like a quick retreat to an exhausting day. It's big enough to handle a lot of tourists and you wouldn't feel that it is crowded since people enters by batches.
,,Panorama as it should be,4.0,,Incredible view of the Singapore. Worth it to visit during day or on a clear night. After 10pm the viewing deck is closed but the bar remains open (extra fee) duration of this visit is about 15minutes. Slightly disappointed as you are not able to see the infinity pool......hotel guests only
,,amazing!,5.0,,"great service, clean but very busy place! Love the swimming pool and the view as well! highly recommend!"
,,great view,5.0,,"You can pay $23 to go to the viewing deck, however you can also go up to use the bar this is free although you are expected to buy a drink. A beer is around the same price."
,,I'm exciting for that ;-),4.0,,I went there and it was good place to see. Make me happy to go. Actually I had been to Singapore for a few times but i just went to marina bay this time. Was so exciting for me to see and have many good shops there. Not waste ur time to see. ;-)
,,Amazing Hotel,5.0,,"This Hotel is an amazing construction. It's absolutely lovely inside and the Bar on the 57 floor is a great place to go and have a drink and see the views of singapore.

Two drink will set you back $50 AUD but your on holidays and certainly worth going up to see it."
,,Awe inspiring views if you can see through the smog,4.0,,This tropical paradise in the middle of a city is an amazing feat of engineering. The pool is divided into several smaller pools including a child-free one. There are spas and plenty of space for sunbathing as well as a massive viewing deck. There are several different restaurant/bar areas and a pool shop but I would check prices before you order anything - it's incredibly expensive!!!
,,What a view!,5.0,,"Fantastic bar overlooking the city, stunning views, attentive staff and some great wines. If you're visiting Singapore this is a must do!"
,,Amazing view but way too crowded,3.0,,"The view from the pool is great, but the ambience is pretty much like at a wet market with a cacophony of voices, sounds and accents. Pity. If you are looking to enjoy the views in more serene settings, then this is not the place for you. Also, there's not much swimming possible given how crowded the pools are."
,,Very overrated,3.0,,The view was great but not worth the line up at the bottom and the money to get up there. I wouldnt recommend it.
,,Amazing views.,5.0,,"I am so scared of heights but I wanted to show my partner so we took the lift - 57 floors high.
We had some tea and cake at the top of tower one.

The lady who served us invited us to sit outside for a short while knowing I was a bit nervous.

This lady was so nice it made our visit a very nice Singapore experience."

,,Nice view,4.0,,"The view is great. A bit pricey, but no better place to see the city. The snack shop at the top serves wonderful smoothies, at a reasonable price. The restaurant, however is extremely overpriced."
,,Too high brow for my liking,3.0,,"Yes, it's an impressive building. And, yes, the view is outstanding. But I had fallen in love with colonial Singapore so this modern monument to progressive growth left me feeling cold. Food and drinks in the Flight Bar all good but couldn't beat satay and dumplings in Smith Street, Chinatown. I left wishing I'd invested the minimum $100 spend somewhere less Western."
,,"If you miss, you can not say ""I was in Singapore""",5.0,,"- amaizing amaizing amaizing
- beautiful view on the marina bay, city and gardens by the marina
- recomend to go during sunset or at night (one enter, no time limit)
- just stay and watch...thats everything...enjoy feeling Singapore
- buy ticket online to avoid the queue (take a credit card you pay by and the personal document with you)"
,,view from the top,5.0,,"best view of the city from up there, go in evening to look around in sunlight as well as when the lights are on. I liked the night view better."
,,Fabulous feat of engineering a must see site,5.0,,"Set in fabulous gardens the Marins Sands is the new icon of Singerpore. Breathtaking just to look up and walk thro the foeyer this Singapore at its spectacular best.So much to see and do and half of it is free and willbe a number attraction for many years to come. We didn't do te observatory as we dined one night in the Ce La Vie resturant right up there on top next to the amazing 150 metre sky pool, again amazing views of teh skyline,funny waltching the light show from that height and greta photo shots. After the meal you can go to the terrace overlooking the skypool"
,,F1 GP,5.0,,Fabulous views from the viewing platform although sadly we were there when the fires in Indonesia were ongoing so it was very hazy and the air quality was poor because of it. We were given the opportunity to have a photograph done whilst we were there.. excellent.
,,Best Building in Singapore!,5.0,,"Perched above the 56th floor is the Skypark which tops out the $5B structure. Marina Bay Sands is the iconic structure of Singapore and the Skypark is must visit - provided the visibility is good - otherwise wait for another day. Unfortunately the pool is only available to hotel guest, while the upper bars are open to visitors, with one overlooking the pool."
,,"Extraordinery building, extraordinery view!",5.0,,"Marina Bay is unique building, which is recognized around the world. Once you are in Singapore you have to visit it. The famous pool on the top boat is unfortunately reserved only for the hotel guests, but for the rest is Sands Skypark. From there you have a great panoramic view for the business district of Singapore."
,,Views are unreal.,5.0,,"Visited the bar on 57th top floor.
As a bar guest you cannot access the pool.
The entry to the bar is via tower 2.
Views of Singapore at night are iincrediable
Drink price expensive however well worth it to sit back and take in the view."
,,Not worth 25 Dollars,1.0,,"Huge disappointment, very nice panoramic views but not worth S$25.

Paid the money had to wait ages in a queue for the lift, to go up and just walk around the deck. Wasn't allowed in the bar as it was full and there is nothing else to do.

If your looking to get rid of your last bit if money then go for it otherwise, not worth it."
,,Spectacular and breath-taking!,5.0,,"A really special view of Singapore's CBD and modern skyline from above. Also a true architectural feat of designing a large viewing deck on top of the MBS hotel towers. Been up at dusk watching the sunset and it's worth the wait! If you are staying in the hotel, the bonus is taking a dip the Infiniti pool. As good as being on the top of the Empire State or Eiffel Tower on a clear day."
,,"A must stay, once in your lifetime",5.0,,"Best would be the breakfast, a must have , so be early till they close, the rooms are a splendid layout, we went out swimming in the infinity pool at night, and 6am, what you pay for the room gets rewarded in the infinity pool, next would be viewing deck, don't miss it before you check out, a awesome place to stay even if its staycation"
,,Great views,4.0,,Our ticket only allowed us on the observation deck which was fine but would have appreciated being able to purchase a drink at the bar. The views whilst walking around the deck are lovely and a great photo opportunity.
,,Beautiful Dinner,5.0,,We enjoyed a lovely dinner in the outdoor skydeck. The food was excellent although a quite pricey. The views were spectacular even though it was quite hazey.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This is a definite must. Amazing building with fantastic views (when it isn't hazy). The Sky Bar is great fun and Cest La Vie (used to be Ku De Ta) is absolutely brilliant.
Drinks aren't cheap (SGD30 each) but no more expensive than London/Paris/New York. Cest La Vie had an excellent DJ and great music. The drinks, albeit expensive, were good. We would definitely go back.
Shame about the queue so I'd advise getting there early. And leave by 4am as apparently that's when the local prostitutes turn up and harass the boys!"
,,Beautiful scenery,3.0,,"In my hometown Osaka, the Japanese second biggest city, there is a 175m twin skyscraper which is chosen as the one of the top 20 buildings in the world by the British famous magazine. But this Marina bay sands consists of triple skyscrapers which height is over 200m. We had planned to visit to there at first day morning in order to get the picture of center of Singapore. We can see a lot of artistic and modern architectures: ""Gardens by the bay"", ""Formula 1 course"", ""Singapore fryer"" and many skyscrapers. We can eat and drink with enjoying these magnificent view at this observation deck. You should check a visibility before you go. Haze often happens. Finally we felt a little bit expensive."
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,"One of the best places in singapore, and one of the most expensive as well. It provides a wonderful view of the skyline of Singapore and the infinity pool is extremely pretty as well."
,,MBS stay,5.0,,"MBS service stuff is excellent, polite. Check in on the hotel. Hotel room is big & spacious. The room come with nice view towards padang. Skypark swimming pools is big & nice. A relax place to go."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"The marina bay sands SkyPark is the one place that is not over rated!

If you're visiting singapore for the first time, then it's worth going to this place. The infinity pool is really charming and there's nightclubs and a nice Chocolate bar for you to enjoy!

Earlier the kids could swim there even if you weren't a hotel resident; I believe that's not permitted anymore."
,,Loved it,5.0,,"The views do live up to what they say to be, the service is friendly, on the day i went up it was not too packed with people it was quite empty"
,,Great place during both daytime and night time,5.0,,"What can I say, the MBS is a great area. The restraurant/pub is very very expensive. You pay for the view."
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,Beautiful view of Singapore and lets you take in all the sights from the 56th floor. Great place to pause and take some pictures
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,"General public only had access to the 56th. floor, as you step out of the elevator, you're met with the most beautiful view of all the Marina Bay down below with it's attractions. Couldn't get a glass of bubbly (this was restricted to hotel guests only from the 55th. floor where the infinity pool was situated."
,,Singapore aerial view,5.0,,"From the top of Marina Bay, there is what it is called skypark. No other attraction here, only Singapore's view from the top"
,,Maybe at night,2.0,,"Check the visibility. If it's less than 15 miles, save your money and time. Be sure you know how to get to the ticket counter before going."
,,"Great view, good for mapping the city",5.0,,"Even if i stayed on the 60 floor in a nearby hotel, I chose to go up Marina Sands to get a different view of the area; spend time to read the descriptions along the glass side, look well all around to better plan your city and gardens by the bay explorations"
,,A dream Hotel,5.0,,"Wonderful Massive hotel, but views from the infinity pool at the top to die for! Lunch in the restaurant again absolutely amazing!! There aren't many hotels that you can stay in with such amazing views! loved it!!"
,,Wonderful Views,5.0,,"Fantastic views of the Singapore skyline, marina bay, Bay Gardens and the race track. Good value and a very welcome bar on the Sky Deck as visited in the heat of the day. Night views will undoubtably be fantastic as well over Singapore."
,,Fabulous Views,4.0,,"Architecturally, this is a very interesting building. It's shape is unique and the views of the city and harbor are great The shopping is good and there is variety in the restaurants. It's definitely worth a visit."
,,A definitive yes!,5.0,,"Go up around 18:00-18:30 and stay at least one hour or two! It is brilliant to see the sunset and the transition of the city from dailight to the brightly illuminated night mode. If you like big city lights, this is one for you!"
,,Iconic building.,3.0,,"Singapore is pretty hazy so the view has less appeal, especially in the day when you really see the state of the air. Night gives you glimpses of the illuminated gardens in the Bayside park. $23 to go up to floor 57 or go to the bar and buy a drink. Cocktails are $24 but not really because Singapore prices sometimes as in this case show prices without tax and surcharge. Buy a beer, the cocktails were not special. Still some nice way to spend time. The building itself is best viewed from around the Merlion fountain on the waterside."
,,fantastic view,5.0,,"we visited this place during a flight transit to australia, for a dringkat Ce La Vie at the 57th floor. quite expensive but the price is absolutely worth of the view. Recommended at sundown"
,,Pricey drinks but worth it for the view,4.0,,"We went up to see the sunset, we had been out all day and we were wearing jean shorts, we did think that they weren't going to let us but they did!

The view is amazing you can see the tree light show in the gardens and all of the bay lit up in front of you. We had a very strong Singapore Sling and a beer which were expensive but not above average for Singapore we are on a tight budget so if you're not it'll be fine!"
,,wonderful views,4.0,,"We took the elevator to the very top floor where the bar and bistro are. We bought a drink (a very very expensive drink I must say) but that way we enjoyed the views without having to pay for the skypark ticket. The vista was very spectacular, but don""t go there on a really hot day because there is not enough shade for you to sit under."
,,Takes your breath away,4.0,,"Go there,-before sunset and wait for the scenic change. Take a drink and feel electric. The drinks aren't overpriced as well - normal highfly rates - as to the bay places but worth any penny."
,,Not worth the trip if you are not a hotel guest,2.0,,"As a visitor you have no access to restaurants or anything resembling a ""park"" (e.g. Grass). No shade or seating Just a boardwalk with good views (if the haze had not been so bad)"
,,Singapore from above! :),5.0,,"Offering a totally worthwhile experience viewing Singapore from above Marina Bay Sands hotel, this place in the shape of a boat deck was just as I had expected; in fact, it even exceeded my expectations since I got to see both day AND night views of the city, but that will depend on the time you go which I suggest is about 6 30 to 7 30 pm. That way, you'll get to enjoy the day views of ""landmark"" sights of Singapore such as Gardens by the Bay & Singapore Flyer from one side of the Skypark and the impressive 40-to-50-story tall buildings of the central financial district, the historic Fullerton Hotel with the iconic Singapore Merlion in front of it & 'the Durian' from the other side of the Skypark just before the sun sets or as it is setting and a little later like after 7 pm the phenomenal after-dark views especially those of the beautifully lit up Super Trees of Gardens by the Bay right beside the Singapore Strait full of container ships (with bright lights on them as well after dark) on one side and those of the amazing ""cityscape"" on the other side.

The best way to get here by public transportation is taking the MRT to Bayfront station (blue & yellow lines), then go up to Marina Bay Sands hotel where you'll walk to the other end of the hotel (toward Tower 3), then go out the door (to outside the hotel) where you'll immediately turn left and walk down one level, and that's where the ticket counters & elevators to the Skypark are."
,,An Enterprise on High,5.0,,"The observation deck and skypark provide you with the best vantage point to secure your panoramic views of Singapore. As a Hotel guest you have complimentary access to swim in the infinity pool whilst being mesmerised by the 360 degree vistas. Visitors can access the skydeck at a cost of 23 sgd dollars. As any good photographer will tell you, to secure those ""catch your breath moments"" you have to be willing to ""spend a little, to get a lot"". What better way to enjoy your stay than floating in the rooftop pool surrounded by the Marina Bay. Marina Bay Sands Hotel takes its guests to a whole new level of luxury and indulgence. Care to enter the ""spaceship enterprise"" and guaranteed you'll be surprised.
The small touches, from being given a red rose upon check in, a complimentary mocktail, this Hotel will have you feeling very special indeed. A stay you will remember, a view you can never forget. Marina Bay Sands - to see your architectural brilliance rising like a spaceship in the sky - is how we first met. I will come back."
,,great view but expensive,3.0,,"Great view. Ridiculous prices even for Singapore. They serve a lovely lunch in the restaurant at the top. Considering what we paid for lunch, I shudder to think of the cost for dinner."
,,Worth the Time,4.0,,Absolutely worth the small fee to ride to the top and check out the view from the skydeck. Iam not fond of hieghts but the sights from the top are well worth it. The view of the gardens from here is awesome
,,excellent stay during the F1 Grand Prix week-end,4.0,,"1 night on the Saturday on the F1 Grand Prix. I ws staying on the 37th floor, room 3719 I think.

Location - Excellent - A beautiful view on both side. It is also very convenient to go and visit the greenhouses, or the bay of the other side. t is very easy to go there by MTR, with a station a few minutes away in the shopping mall. Finally, there are plenty of taxis available at the hotel.

Room - When I checked in, I was kindly automatically upgraded to room 3719. It was a very large room: very comfortable, with all the amenities one can look for. I was advised to choose a room with a view of the greenhouses and of the harbour.

Services - Excellent - Everybody, the reception staff, the luggage staff and the staff taking care of the swimming pool were very friendly and helpful.

Shopping center - I just went there for a Chinese breakfast, in a section of the food court with 10-15 different Chinese cuisines booth. I had to walk through the entire mall. I found it a little old fashion and not very exciting.

Casino - I don't gamble and didn't go there.

Conclusion
I had a very comfortable stay, and I enjoyed seeing the Grand Prix qualifications from the swimming pool around 10 pm on Saturday night."
,,Great view... with a delicious Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Don't miss this bar, especially at sunset! Nice atmosphere, breathtaking views of the city, all for the same price as the visit!"
,,High expectations but underwhelming delivery,4.0,,"I guess probably because of the huge fame of marina bay so that my friends and I decided to pay a visit. The hotel, mall and deck are decent but I feel a bit pricy AND not that fantastic as it is shown on TV or Marketing materials. It's probably nicer to watch the marina bay from the other side of the river and the view from Marina is 'just' fine. The mall is a comfortable walk but all brands can be found in other places and given the price tag and SGD, it won't be an appealing buy. It's a good experience though as first time."
,,Good view but pricey,3.0,,The view isn't as good as the flyers though you can see the surrounding bay and gardens below. To expensive just for a small deck and elevator ride.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"When working in Singers had the chance to experience the view from Skypark after paying $23 to get up in the lift. The viewing platform is well worth it and haze was thankfully not too bad on the day so got the all round view. Our plan was to go on the big wheel first but glad we didn't as the views from that would be pretty poor in comparison. Very cosmopolitan city and this is the perfect birds eye view, well worth it."
,,A great experience,5.0,,An amazing view from the sky park. A fantastic stay in the Singaporian icon Marina Bay Sands. Hope to come back again.
,,Ship in the sky,3.0,,"Disappointing because of limited access, quite expensive for what we got views were good but couldn't Sit or have a meal or drink ?"
,,Good view,4.0,,We were not let in our our first day since there was a private event happening :-/ next day we came early morning and we were let up. The views are fantastic yes but nothing so special. We did not see the infinity pool as well. Not to mention it was really hot up there! But yes nice views although the glass s not so clean hence makes photo taking a bit fuzzy.
,,Wonderful view of Singapore skyline,5.0,,The entry is not free.... but it is worth the money to go up the 57 floors and enjoy the skyline from the Skypark. Enjoy a drink and spend some time there.
,,Wonderful views,4.0,,"Great views of the city from the bar on the top floor. Only had a cocktail and snacks. Very busy hotel complex, like being in an airport!!"
,,Go up end enjoy !!!,5.0,,I had the pleasure to go up in the Marina Sands and enjoy a awesome sundown. It is so great up here and the view is unbelievable. You can go up for free and enjoy a awesome view on the town. I highly recommend to go up here
,,Too common,2.0,,"Nothing much here, it just happened that we stayed in this Hotel. You will just see a good view of Singapore. That you can have while riding in Singapore Flyer as well."
,,Fantastic City Skyline,5.0,,Fantastic. The best place to see the city of Singapore. I was not staying at hotel. It is 57 stories up on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which that by itself is worth a look. The fee is around $25AUD I feel well worth it. The day we went up was a bit hazey which can be a common issues due to burn offs in neighbouring countries. There is also the sky bar there and you get a great look the infinity pool on top of the hotel. Take your camera and enjoy the views. Easy to travel to by bus or MRT.
,,Breathtaking views of Singapore,5.0,,"This was our second visit.....and it was just as breathtaking second time round! We visited on a hazy day so the views were not as good as they could have been, but nevertheless it is a stunning place to visit. The sheer scale of the structure is amazing as is the position of the infinity pool.
Definitely well worth a visit to get a birds eye view of the city."
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,"To use the highest outdoor swimming pool in the world you have to be a guest in the hotel. But for a small fee you can visit the Skypark and get the most amazing views of Singapore City to the north, or turn around and take in the long view of Singapore's southern islands and the sea to the south."
,,Fantastic views of the city (& Grand Prix Circuit),5.0,,One of the iconic attractions in the city now. Gives you brilliant views of the city (the hotels infinity pool) and at this time of year the Grand Prix circuit. We went up to the top in the evening to see the lights.
,,ONE OF THE BEST,5.0,,"I went as a visitor for a drink. it was an excellent experience. The view is amasing and you can see a very small part of the F1 racetrack. There is a pool up there but unfortunately it was closed for visitors. I would recoment everyone to visit this hotel, either to stay or visit it. I would like to say that visitors have to pay in the entarance in order to go to the roof. after that you can visit the lobby and have a good time to the restaurants of the hotel."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"57 floors up, the place provides fabulous view at night. Only hindrance at times is the haze caused due to fires in neighbouring Malaysia. If the sky is clear, one can see far upto Johor Bahu and maybe Indonesian coast."
,,Go for the view.,4.0,,"Worth it for the view if you're not staying at the hotel. I would suggest buying a drink at the skybar, which is around the same price as entry just to the viewing deck (approx $25 AUD). However if you are a hotel guest, then not worth the price tag for a drink. The view alone is the reason for the 4 stars."
,,Amazing - from a distance.,2.0,,So it looks amazing but it's all gaudy and glitzy inside - a tackiness usually reserved for Las Vegas or Macau. It's pretty impressive from a distance but don't waste your money. $AU15 for a coffee in the Skypark. Go to the Gardens and look at it from there. The further away you are the better this place looks.
,,Great pool and great restaurant!,5.0,,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 days for work. We spent all our free time in the Infinity pool / Skypark. While the haze in singapore didn't allow the best of views, it was still very relaxing. The restaurant staff (namely Mylene and Mahesh) were fantastic and really took care of us.
Mylene always greeted us by our name and remembered our orders the next day!! Very attentive and friendly. Gave us tips on some local things to do.
Mahesh really took care of us as well - also helped with local tips and greeted guests by their names.
Would love to visit soon again!!"
,,"No seat, not fully coverd roof top.",3.0,,"The charges for the roof top visit is fair. At the roof top dun have any seat and it was no roof top cover, its hot. The sales person just non stop selling your photo, (taken before you been sent up to the roof top )By the way the view is nice."
,,Hazy but nice,4.0,,"Interesting and should be seen, been there as guest of the Hotel, I do not know how it can be visited by outside guests except for the restaurant that unfortunately was closed due to the haze which basically limited any view during the day, better in the night with all the lights breaking up the fog"
,,Rip Off,2.0,,"Limited access on the deck, nicest areas are off limits with no shade area available. You are better off paying for the Flyer if you want to view Singapore from a high."
,,Magnificent view from UP & ABOVE!,5.0,,"A must go place if you are traveling to Singapore for the first time!!!! The lift taking you up to the Sky Park is simply amazing & super fast. The view is to die for.
You don't get much to eat on the Deck though, souvenirs are also expensive."
,,See the whole city,5.0,,"A great way to see the whole of Singapore, well worth the effort. Try to go when it is not busy. A photographers dream."
,,Great view of the Marina,3.0,,"We paid $23 each and headed up 56 floors. We visited the Sky Park when it was rather hazy so we expected that our visibility would be limited. I'm sure on a clear day it would be a much better experience overall. As we knew, we would not have access to the pool area but I felt the section for viewing was quite small and even with the haze cover it was very hot as there is no roof at all. We may have spent a longer time if we could have enjoyed the view with a roof over us!"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,We took a trip up to the sky park. It was $46 for the two of us and we spent about 15mins looking at the view. This is the kind of thing that is good to do once so make sure you pick a clear day as the haze can restrict the view quite a bit.
,,Good affordable views,4.0,,Didn't cost too much - $23 I think. You can spend as long as you like up there but can't go to the pool as it's only for hotel guests. Great view if it's not hazy.
,,Sight seeing galore,5.0,,"Do not miss seeing this amazing area. Great building a grand design. Watched a documentary on the construction of Marina bay sands and from this was added to my bucket list of buildings to explore. Shopping centre great, roof top bar view better. The elevator for the walk way to sky garden is on the street not inside marina bay sands."
,,"Super view of the entire panorama, provided no haze!",3.0,,"Went to the skypark during a staycation and also later for an evening out with friends. The former was a stunning and magnificent experience. The latter was sadly disappointing, but not for fault of this beautiful building or its skypark. People jostling us for view of...nothing! As the haze sadly obscured view of everything."
,,Just to Say You've Been There,5.0,,"This is one of those places you just have to visit, like the Eiffel Tower. You also want a clear day. We arrived in Singapore during the Sumatra fires and the visibility was less than 100 feet. Fortunately, the smoke lifted by the next night and we were able to enjoy the views from the Skypark with all of the city skyline visible. Expect a wait line at the elevator to go up, but that also keeps it from being too crowded once you do get to the top. There is a restaurant if you want to extend your time there."
,,View of Singapore,5.0,,Great view of the harbor and skyline of Singapore. There is also restaurant and garden on top of the building.
,,Breath taking view of the city,3.0,,"Even though it's a bit costly but well worth a visit. The lift takes you in speed to the sky park. To go on the side where the infinity swimming pool, they charge extra. The sight from the top is really great. Every thing is in a miniature form. The view is so breath taking. There is a cafe at the top but it's very expensive."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"Really high. I had second thoughts about this as it is so high but don't worry, it is so well built and so cleverly done you feel very safe at the top. You cannot get a better very and its worth the money because of this. Try to pick a nice day as the haze will limit your viewing ability but its still spectacular."
,,Good place to visit,5.0,,Nicely arranged park covering Marina Sands Bay HTL in the front.. Access from HTL as well for ease of comfort. A big area overlooking the sea & surrounding Gardens by the Bay..
,,Experience is priceless,5.0,,"It must be expensive for a reason.
The location and experience are amazing! I love the view of city from my 49th level. Room is huge. Breakfast is amazing with choices. Coffee is not good though compared with Melbourne 's.
The pool is a must try. I also found the best dumplings place in the shopping complex. Even food court has some amazing delicious dish."
,,Nice Views of the City,4.0,,"We visited the Skypark observation deck and enjoyed the views over Singapore and the Bay very much. Many people were disappointed that the pool area is open only for hotel guests - a visit to the Skypark does not afford a glimpse of the pool. That said, the views are great, especially on a clear day. The ticket sale process was somewhat slow, but the elevators up and down are fast and the lines moved quickly. You can spend as much time as you like at the top, within the constraints of opening hours."
,,Sky park.,5.0,,"On the top of the Marina bay sands hotle they have made a skypark. You can get a spendid view of singapore ,domes , singapore river and sea all around . It becomes really enchants red as sun sets and then when the singapore gets lighted up to welcome the night .you can spend hours together watching this romantic evening and night ."
,,Have to see this magic once,5.0,,Well it's a pool but this is a great architecture structure as well and I admire it it is beautiful the architect thought of everything from the out standing view you'll see from the pool to the feeling of freedom when you are so high and inside water can each all of Singapore...
,,Top View,4.0,,Good panoramic view both to the City and Singapore Bay. Not so much people - quite expensive. But swimming pool is good for hotel guests
,,My Favourite Hangout,5.0,,"The Skypark is a must. I stop by every time I come to Singapore to enjoy the sunset from up there. Even though people might say that it is artificial I think it is the best place to watch the sun going down while having a cool drink. Any time again, stunning place!"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,This is quit expensive for non-hotel visitors but its worth a look. You don't get access to the pool but the view of Singapore is good and you can spend quite a bit of time up the top reading about different buildings around the city.
,,Great overview of Singapore,5.0,,"Its the best place to overview the whole of Singapore. Seriously I highly recommend this rather then Singapore flyer. My overseas friend was here and took the flyer before heading up here, he was amazed with full look out from the skypark. KUDOS MBS ;)"
,,must see,5.0,,One of the popular places for the tourists! Perfect view from the rooftop to the business part of city and perfect park and sea area!
,,Great views from skypark,4.0,,It was with the trip for the views. It was a misty view that day but still stunning. There were a lot of tourists on this trip so when we wanted to get a drink there was nowhere to sit. And the bar was noisy.
,,Must See - AMAZING VIEW,5.0,,Amazing view out across Singapore - definitely something that every visitor to Singapore must see! The construction of the Marina Bay Sands is spectacular even more so in person architecturally it is amazing!!! There are little souvenirs that you can buy on the top and if you are lucky enough you can eat at the KU DE TA.
,,Spectacular,5.0,,we stayed here for a couple of nights - this gave us access to the sky park and swimming pool - we were there a couple of years earlier and just visited the sky park and so we put it on our bucket list to stay there - something to remember
,,Amazing to swim in this pool with such amazing views of the city. The breakfast in the restaurant was to die for.,5.0,,"We loved the Skylark when we stayed two night at Marina Bay Sands. The pool was lovely and at night the view of the city incredible. The breakfast at the restaurant on floor 57 was the best I've ever eaten anywhere. As well as the usual buffet with all the expected items, hot and fresh, you could also order two items from the menu, a choice of about ten items. I chose Eggs Benedict and I could even have had a Laksa! My only criticism is that to have a drink at the bar we were asked to pay for the night club entry. We declined and had our drink sitting on the comfortable pool side deckchairs."
,,Good View( Swissotel Better),4.0,,"This is the new star attraction and although great because of the outside viewing I prefer ""Eqinox"" Level 70 (private lift LHS of reception) ( above City Hall MRT , Next to Raffels Hotel) of the Swissotel. They have a happy hour 3-9pm (50% off but you don't need to buy a drink). Stunning 360 degree views much higher and a better angle than MBS. If you do decide to go to top of MBS for viewing don't pay the SG$ ++ for viewing, say u are going for a drink (same area) at the top and the cocktail on the top is about the same price as the lift ticket ."
,,amazing building,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands is one of Singapore's top level attractions. Expecially the huge infinity pool and the roof garden are worth visiting this location.
,,Marina bay sands,5.0,,Beautiful place was like being in a big shopping complex . Staff at front desk are ok no feeling of vip service as l guess it has alot of people to deal with definitely not an intimate cosy atmosphere more of a hussle crazy one like a shopping mall but rooms were peaceful and very clean the major wow factor was the rooftop so beautifully amazing quite the jaw dropper . Very romantic and elegantly displayed. The pool was like one ld never seen . And the views were just wow factor definitely worth a look . A place one would not forget in a hurry .
,,Beautiful view but not worth the money for a non-hotel guest.,3.0,,"It cost $30+ each to go up to the Skypark. They take a photo of you in front of a blue screen for your photo which you get when you reach the top and step out of the elevator. I honestly thought it would be included in the price but no, you have to then purchase the photo for about $40! (we didn't).
The view is amazing but go at night time. We went during the day because we didn't get any other time to go and it was like an oven. The air pollution and glare was so bad it hurt my eyes after a while.
You only get access to one end of the skypart and you aren't even allowed into the restaurant as there is security guards stopping you. You can see the pool from a distance so don't go up there thinking you can check the whole place out!
There weren't even any chairs to sit on and you're not allowed to sit on the stairs.
I was definitely disappointed for the amount of money we paid."
,,Amazing building,4.0,,For a quick stopover in .singapore the Marina Bay skypark is well worth a look. Accessible via rail from the airport in a short time
,,A must see place in Singapore,5.0,,The views from the Skypark are just spectacular. We didn't stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel so we didn't get to see the infinity pool which I heard is pretty amazing.
,,mesmerized,4.0,,"I was mesmerized by the structure of the building..was like letter M symbolizes a lot of beautiful meaning.It feels great when we were standing in front of that building,so High!"
,,A long way up,5.0,,Great fast lifts considering it is so high up. Great panoramic views stretching to the horizon. Has food outlets and a swimming pool.
,,"Lots of people, stunning view",5.0,,What a view ! and the infinite swimming pool is a must ! It can be crowded so be careful to pick a low frequentation time !
,,Fantastic Views,4.0,,Well worth a see. The views are fantastic. I was under the impression that the whole top was the observation deck but it is only one side. In the middle is the infinity pool and day area for hotel guests. I would have been nice to be able to go down the other end to see the view there which is closer to the buildings. Make sure you go on clear day.
,,Brilliant view,5.0,,"We had prebooked our tickets as we were there for the Grand Prix weekend and thought that it would be packed but there was hardly any queues at all which meant it was not crowded at all when we got to the top.

The elevator ride is unnerving as you go up so many floors in such a short space of time - had a couple of ear-popping moments there.

Even though Singapore was suffering from the hazy effects of the fires in Sumatra, we were still able to get pretty good views at the top and I can imagine how far you can see on a clear day.

It was also great to be able to get a view of the infinity pool of the hotel.

Definitely something you should do in Singapore."
,,Pricey view,3.0,,Great view but expensive priviliege. Can get booked out so try and pre-book for best viewing times. Recommend only if good weather.
,,On top of the world!,5.0,,What an amazing view of Singapore. On the top of the Hotel is a bar and restaurant. Relaxing chairs to sit and enjoy the sights. You must pay to go to the top and It is a bit expensive. If you buy a meal or drink your admittance charge is refunded.
,,Great View but wait times too long,3.0,,The cruise ship on top of this hotel is unique. The views (we went in the night) were exceptional but the long lines to wait for the elevator were a turn off. Great views but a pain to get to.
,,Skypark 57,5.0,,"Had to check into the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to use the Skypark 57, had a lovely day although a bit pricey for not even sleeping in the bed there only had to kill 12 hours before flying home but I was charged for the night!!!!
The views were amazing, saw the ship I had just come off in Bay and had a lovely swim in the infinity pool on 57th floor, enjoyed the food but Mandarin Orchard Hotel would be the one I would stay in again so central, shops all around, undergrounds on nearly every corner to take you wherever you needed to go."
,,You should go there to feel awesome!,5.0,,"SG50 Marina Bay Sands from both Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay and Merlion Park point of views, is the most important attraction for real travelers and locals who love to shoot photos. Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay is the country's premier arts centre in modern architecturally style. It is the new iconic landmark on the city's skyline as Marina Bay Sands as well and at last but not the least Merlion Park that is the symbol of Singapore."
,,Unbelievable views. Great pool.,5.0,,My wife and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands. We spent an entire day at the Skypark. The infinity pool on the top is a wonder. Superb restaurants. Great service.
,,Amazing views of Singapore but choose your days wisely,4.0,,"Fantastic views of the whole of Singapore. We visited on a Saturday evening which was extremely busy and involved us queuing for quite some time to purchase tickets and queue for the elevator. What we didn't realise was that there was a massive firework display being held as it was the build up to 50th Anniversary celebrations of Singapore, hence the queues. We timed our visit just right as we stepped out of the lift the display started and we took some amazing photos. We stayed and had a drink once the fireworks had finished as the queue to descend was enormous. Two hours later we reached the bottom to wait in more queues for taxis....a lot of waiting around but very well organised,"
,,Amazing,4.0,,Just loved the all experience. The infinity pool a must. The building is just spectacular and the views from the top are just breathtaking.
,,You must see it,5.0,,"This is also a place, you must visit. We have been there in the evening. The view was so great (better than from Singapore flyer), that me and my husband decided to spent one New Years Eve in the Marina Sands Hotel to have this great view for the fireworks."
,,Best view ever,5.0,,We have stayed in the hotel and enjoyed all the amazing views and activities that it had to offer. There is a observation deck where also tourists who are not guests of the hotel have access. Good point to have a full view of the city.
,,A drink with a view!,5.0,,Instead of paying to visit the Skypark just say you want to go up to the rooftop bar for a drink. You get the same view without paying. Definitely worth it.
,,Skypark cocktails,5.0,,Great views of Singapore and great cocktails. Remember not to dress in shorts and thongs. Visited both sides of the skypark and two rooftop bars - both great service.
,,Amazing Building,4.0,,"Its not cheap to gain access to the top deck of this amazing structure , but like most things , you get what you pay for. The lift ride is great by its self, but the view is spectacular. You use to be able to gain access to the pool on top, but now as far as I know its off limits unless your are a guest , or maybe pay a premium to use it rather than just the viewing platform area."
,,A great place to take in the view,5.0,,"This is an great area to relax, have some drinks and take in the view, it also connects to the infinity pool which is just as spectacular"
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"My daughter and I just enjoyed our stay at Marina Because of Infinity pool it's really amazing ,and the breathtaking view of Singapore. It is pricey but worth."
,,Good experience,3.0,,"Must visit. Go during late afternoons as you can see the view in daylight and then stay on till dusk untill night.
Spectacular during both times.you can see the flyer, gardens by the bay ( beautiful at night). If there is haze the view may not be clear- we were informed before hand. Senior citizens can avail a discount- 65 years and above only.
The infinity pool is not included for the visitors but can be seen from the observation deck.
There is a restaurant as well, with a souvenir shop."
,,Superb view!,5.0,,Superb view of Singapore and also the crowd! Plenty of interesting things to see and the Singapore skyline is awesome!
,,The Observation Deck isnt worth it,1.0,,"Was disappoint with the ""Observation"" deck of the Skypark. They only let hotel guest access the the full Skypark which looks to be beautiful. Its not worth the lines and the few pics just to access the observation deck."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"Surely among the wonders of the world. Great Rooms, great food, great service and great place. I would visit this place on every trip to spore"
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,May take some time to get up. Finally made it for a spectacular sun down. A must see for every tourist
,,Must include in your Itinerary,4.0,,"Whether you love shopping or sight seeing, this place won't let you down! Must visit the Skypark at night for great city view from the rooftop."
,,Very crowded,4.0,,"Doesn't seem to matter when you goto the skypark it's always busy. Whether it during the day or at night (for those wanting photos with Singapore skyscrapers lit up). You might have to wait for loungers to become free, though once you have them you can settle down and order some food/drink.
The pool itself is sort of an infinity pool, it does have an edge which overlooks the bay, though there is walkway infront of it (health & Safety I guess).
One of things I guess you do once."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Amazing view from the sky park. Highly recommended heading up to the sky deck. Very reasonable price for Singapore) at around $23s.
There is a bar but we did not go buy anything so can't comment on drink price. You cannot access the pool unless you are a guest at the hotel."
,,Worth a look even with the haze,4.0,,Cost is $23 each. 56 storey up. They try to sell you a tacky photo for $50 which we bypassed. It was well worth it even with the haze currently hanging over Singapore
,,On Cloud 9,5.0,,"You do need to spend a few hours touring this place for designs, views, restaurants, shopping and bars. Terrific time in both hotel, on roof and in the mall"
,,Impressive but wanted a little more,3.0,,"Went up during f1 weekend, so yes too a bit of time to purchase tickets etc. once we were up there - views were indeed pretty amazing. Maybe just spoiled from other Singapore experiences but I just expected to see a little things to do at the top (felt a little Blackpool tower-ish), as the majority of the sky deck is closed and only open to hotel guests. So I was round and down within 10 mins.....mmmm maybe should have done that wheel."
,,Landmark Singapore icon,4.0,,"It's hard to imagine the singapore skyscape without Marina Bay Sands in it. A photographers dream for both shooting at as well as shooting from especially when you go to the top of the deck. The views are spectacular and so is the architecture. There's no building like it in Asia with a pool on top and the perfect venue for dining, drinks and a good time.

At the ground level, apart from the casino and hotel it does have a vast shopping arcade and a wide ranging f&b from fast food to Michelin star restaurants. I also like the exhibition halls which hosts a number of events and a theatre with live performances."
,,Not for the faint hearted,4.0,,"It had been hazy for a few days so not worth goong up. Today was okay. Cost 23 dollars. Cheap kiosk at the top eg comes 4 dollars etc. plenty of room on the deck. See through barriers qll the way around go right up to the edge....dont look down. They take everyones photo at the bottom before u get nto the lift, at the top you are asked to view them , cost thynwanted becausentheynwere in a leather case, 75 dollars! Photo only 35 dollars. I say only but... Anyway, lovely views, worth doing. Just not when too hazy."
,,View from the top,5.0,,"It is really surprising, how easy it is to access this place through the hotel, which is of a different king. One gets best view of the light show of the super trees. A birds eye view of the best part of the city can be seen."
,,Crowded... avoidable,4.0,,On the way to gardens by the bay we went inside the MBS (as they call) also.. unfortunately we added to the crowd even at 9.30 in the morning. . Only 2 casino exist in singapore and one of that is in MBS. Also saw the infinity pool on the top.. and as expected the hotel guests filled the pool. We were not staying at this hotel though. Casino is a free entry for non-singaporeans.
,,"It has become a ""must do""",5.0,,"Going to Singapore, apparently you must go on top of this building at least once otherwise the trip wouldn't be accomplished.

If you are not a resident of MBS you may not enter the pool area, just the Western part of the top for the views.

There are costs to visit the top of the building, at the Skypark, around $20 SGD/AUD"
,,What a view,4.0,,"Spectacular view & architecture! A must see, certainly if you want a special selfie ;-) Tip of the day: go up in Tower #3 to level 57. Enjoy the view for free ...."
,,Singapore Views!,4.0,,This is an incredible icon of the Singapore skyline and from the Skypark the view is amazing from the Marina Bay to Singapore tower and the Supertrees in the Marina Bay Gardens. Visibility is forecasted to be hampered through October 2015 due to smoke from forest fires in Indonesia.
,,Magnum Opus of Singapore !!!!,4.0,,"Singapore pride and Stunning Views that is all about this skypark.
Even though the view of singapore from flyer is more astounding and amazing ,
but the view from marina bay sands park is also good because this will also give you the glimpse of the magnificent Marina Bay Sands Hotel ,which is one of its kind in Singapore .
The iconic and most lavish property of this place .
Next if you want to have bird eye view of singapore this is one the good option after Singapore flyer ."
,,Roof top views,5.0,,"Great place to visit, if going to have a cocktail then enter main entrance as no que. Also no entry charge. 2 cocktails £26. Great views across marina and out to see and gardens by the bay."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Great experience, and worth seeing, but the drinks are very expensive so take your wallet if you want a beer at the top!"
,,"Amazing View, out of this world!",5.0,,"My wife and I went there around sunset in October 2014. Views of the city skyline, and Ocean were spectacular to say the least. Drinks at the bar were expensive ,but par for the course for this type of attraction. If you are looking for a memorable experience to round out a trip to Singapore, this is the place!"
,,DISAPPOINTING,3.0,,"We visited this hotel in March but I have thought about this review before writing it. This is an amazing hotel to look at and on arrival the entrance is impressive ......... but
The standard rooms are good but not more than that for the price. We had stayed at The Stamford for 3 nights on our outward journey and it was equally as good. The reason for the but is the restaurant for breakfast is in the foyer, open plan, just raised with a low partition, so tourists just coming for a gawp of the hotel are walking up and down the massive entrance making it seem very busy. The queue to get breakfast builds up very fast after about 8 o'clock and so they have a table offering drinks while you are waiting and someone comes along offering pieces of fruit. Is this really 5 star? If you build an hotel of this magnitude I feel they could have organised a far better breakfast area. Some people were queuing for 40 minutes. Not a great start to the day, especially if you have a flight to catch. This is ideal for a corporate hotel."
,,Great views from floor 56!,4.0,,"A stunning hotel design both inside and out but what a great view from the top. It is not cheap to visit the skypark, but the views of Singapore are fantastic!

It was a shame the bar was not open when we visited as it was being prepared for a private function."
,,Wonder,5.0,,"This was a swamp last time I visited. We actually fished for the island right about here. The structure should be one of the wonders of the modern world. We had lunch up at the pool bar, enjoyed music and the ver kind and accommodating waitresses . Lovely experience."
,,Day out,5.0,,We spent the day here at shopping center what an amazing place great shops with a good food court that has fantastic selection of food stalls
,,Spectacular bird-eye views of Singapore!,5.0,,If it's your first time visiting Singapore this is a must place to visit. The Skypark is on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and it provides views of Singapore from all angles. Night views are simply spectacular! Dress code is smart-casual.
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,"If you do not mind heights then this is the place to see Singapore, the views are amazing, just take a camera"
,,View of Singapore Skyline,4.0,,After a visit to Gardens at the Bay we went up to the Skypark to see Singapore from above. A fantastic view of the southern and eastern part of Singapore from the large platform. If possible try to go there on a clear day ideally midday as with the afternoon haze and a setting sun the view blurred.
,,Standing on the Shoulders of Giants,5.0,,Marvellous views Like everything else in Singapore it is spotlessly clean and a bit sterile and expensive but the view is worth it
,,Pick your timing on visiting the Skypark,3.0,,"For $23 it's not that expensive compared to some high rise attractions around the world.

My timing could have been better as there was a lot of haze that day. Singapore experiences this each year from forest fires in countries to the south.

I think I spent a total of 10 minutes up on the deck. When you purchase your ticket they are quick to point out that you can't access the Skypark just the front deck. People then are enjoying drinks at the outdoor bar above you that you can't access. You are left knowing exactly what you are missing out on. There is nowhere to sit and take in the view.

It is somewhere you will only visit once by choice. They also take a picture of you at the bottom and try to flog it to you by the time you arrive at the top of the lift on the 57th floor. No idea what the cost to purchase was as I declined the offer.

Beautiful building but as an attraction it's not that well executed."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"Fantastic views from the top, well worth the visit, 360 degree views of Singapore on the observation deck."
,,Panoramic view of Singapore,4.0,,"The Club Lounge at Skypark is the ideal place for a drink with friends in an exceptional place at 57th Level. You can enjoy a panoramic view of Singapore on both sides : Port and Town. However, noted that the music is quite loud when you would like to discuss and chill with friends."
,,Great views,4.0,,We found out that it cost $25pp to ascend to the skydeck so we chose to go up to the lounge bar which is on the same level with the same views but we could enjoy a quiet drink in comfort in the outside area for the price of 2 drinks. I recommend to do this.
,,"great, loved it",5.0,,"This Is a fantastic experience. Stayed there for a few nights and totally loved it. The view from the top in the day or at night is great. Totally loved it. Cant think of any downsides to th experience, if I had to it would be the check-in time of 3pm and the check-out of 11am but that would be nit picking. Plenty of places to eat and drink. Well worth a night's stay for the experience."
,,Sky Park Marina Bay Sands - phenomenal views,4.0,,If possible make the effort to go the Skypark at night for a spectacular view of the Singapore skyline. Easy access through the hotel and you can also access the Sky Bar and Ces La Vie Restaurant.
,,Amazing Buildings,4.0,,Well worth going to see. Easy to get to by train. Positioned by the gardens by the bay. A good view from the gardens.
,,Beautiful island,5.0,,This is a open Terrance on the 57 th floor of the marina bay sands .evening time is best . You can see the singapore in daylight and night . From this height we can get a real birds eye view of singapore .beautiful island.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Whilst we are staying here in Singapore we have had to suffer the mist from Indonesia, however this has not stopped us visiting the places we want to, one of which is the Skypark. It cost 23 Singapore dollars each to go up to the 56th floor. You have your photo taken before you go up the lift and then asked if you want to purchase as soon as you get out of the lift. The photo is shown to you in a leather frame at a cost of 70 Singapore dollars, if you just want the photo is 35 Singapore dollars and when we were leaving it was offered to us at 25 Singapore dollars, we still didn't buy it. Anyway, we arrived at the observation level, not a good day due to the mist but you still got a good look around, it would be amazing on a clear day. You can opt to have a drink or meal at the restaurant if you wish and access is gained on the 57th floor. I have no idea of the prices. We enjoyed the experience and if you haven't been on the Singapore Flyer, you certainly need to visit this attraction."
,,Overrated and expensive,2.0,,"I paid $23 and when I went there, there's not much to do. You can't even sit anywhere because a guard will tell you to stand. I think $10 would've been reasonable."
,,Great views of Singapore and well worth the price,5.0,,"The cost to visit the Skypark is about the same as the cost for the Singapore Flyer. But I believe that the Skypark gives a much greater view and is the better choice. Unless a guest at the hotel or eating at the restaurant or bar, you are limited to the Northernmost part of the structure. But that is fine and gives you access to all the views and skyline that you seek.

If you visit the shopping mall on the ground level and sign up for their Sands Reward Card, you can save ~$5 USD off the regular ~$25 USD cost to go up to the Skypark."
,,Lakwatsera SA Singapore,3.0,,Very beautiful at night. You'll see the light outside. Romantic place ever. I surely recommend this place.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I had conference at Marina Bay and on my free time, I enjoy the view here. Best location, and clean! Magnificent view of Singaore!"
,,Expensive View !,4.0,,Worth a trip to the top. You go in the elevator to the 57th floor. Two ways to go to the top -. you either buy a ticket for around $23 Singapore or you go up for free and buy a drink at the outdoor area and sit and enjoy the view.. Drinks cost much the same so you're better to at least enjoy a drink while you take in the incredible views from up there. We stayed for about an hour and watched the sun set. Well worth doing but make sure its not a hazy day when you go.
,,Extraordinary experience,5.0,,What can i say..Its a great place..singapore has many places that must see and come..and one of the place I recommended Marina Bay Sands Skypark. We can see singapore up here very exciting

,,Overpriced. Just don't bother.,2.0,,"Way too expensive for what it is. Views are quite good, depending on the weather. But it's really not worth the admission fee. You'll be bored after 15 minutes."
,,Waste of money,2.0,,"For 28 dollars you are getting just a view of Singapore - just houses and bay. Small shop at the top. Only hotel guests are allowed to the restaurant area, when the sign itself shows the way to it. Too expensive. We were there during the time, when Singapore was covered by smog, so there was even less to see."
,,views,5.0,,"what an awesome place to be in the view is normally excellent , this time we were there on the wrong day the fires from Indonesia spoilt the view"
,,"Marina Bay Sands park is excellent, must visit",5.0,,"Great place to visit, there are gardens around, flyer within walking distance, there is fee to go on the top of the hotel to get agood view of the surroundings, MRT is closeby"
,,Magnificent!!!,5.0,,Magnificent. Breathtaking. Superb. In short MBS for the Marina Bay Sands Skyview park. 360 view of the whole city. Infinity pool offering you an infinete happiness. Total relaxation especially after a hard day's work. Love this.
,,High class service and wonderful architecture,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is where you should come to enjoy the life like a VIP . I find it amazing in everything from service to room and food. But yeh everything will be a bit costly though.
,,You should Visit,5.0,,Excellent place to visit.From the top you can see the beauty of Singapore city.Little bit expensive.But great value for your money.Very beautiful in the night with city light.
,,Swim in the sky!,4.0,,"If you stay in the hotel, then it is free to go up. But note that you need to hold on to your room key at all time, the staff might check. If you are not, they charge you for it about SGD 5-15 per person but you can stay as long as you like. The height is cool, when you see from up there.

The swimming pool is long, so for people who like to swim, they would love it. But unfortunately, the condition doesn't allow you to do 1 full lap because there's a lot of kids & family playing around in the middle of the pool, so it would be hard to do some exercise here."
,,Great view,5.0,,Great view strongly recommend this as a to do see a lot of Singapore great pictures are able to be taken from up from the skypark
,,Unbelievable architecture,4.0,,"You can go up to the 50something floor for a drink at the bar without having to queue. The queue if there is one, is for the club. The bar is expensive but you must enjoy a drink from this sky garden with the splendid view over Singapore. Go around sunset to get a better place. They used to serve shangria in a jar -but they stopped unfortunately. There is no dress code or reservation required so that makes your visit to Marina Bay Sands really relaxed."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"An absolutely amazing place, exceeding all expectations this has to be on your tick list, and best of all, you dont have to pay to go in and get the views from the top!"
,,Out of this world experience,5.0,,Even if you are not staying at the MBS the views from the Skypark are utterly breath taking. I am uncertain if it costs anything to come up without staying but I would strongly recommend it.
,,Infinity Pool,4.0,,"I got up to the infinity pool for free, which I think was more than half of the fun of going. I actually don't know how much it costs to enter, but the pool is really only for certain members of the hotel.

The views are nice on a clear day, and I did like the way the water just seems to fall off the building from the Infinity Pool.

I can see how some people would really like this, while others might not."
,,Best Place to See Singapore at Night,4.0,,Would like to Suggest you to go this place instead of Singapore Flyer if you are going just for a View. Try to go in the Evening by 6 so you can see Sun set and Singapore View at night with Laser Show. Carry your Water Bottle.
,,wonderful view over Singapore,5.0,,Amazing view over Singapore. I would recommend to go there by night. If you do not choose the visitor's platform you may go one level higher to the bar. Alls drinks 24 SDG (cheaper than a ticket for the platform) and the same view.
,,AMAZING VIEWS OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,We were luckily enough to be staying at Marina Bay Sands which gives you unlimited access to the skypark. I would recommend anyone coming to singapore to visit this place the views are amazing and a must do.
,,Rip off photographs!,4.0,,"Paid our money to go up to the viewing area, which was good. The problem being the rip off photos that were pushed on us. We declined purchasing them as they were rubbish and extremely expensive - this spoiled the experience as the trip in the lift cost enough! As for the price of a drink in the bar on the deck it was a complete rip off. My husband and I think you definitely need very deep pockets to frequent this tourist attraction. However it is a marvelous piece of engineering."
,,Great Views on a clear day,3.0,,Yes Marina Bay Sands Skypark has great views over Singapore if the sky itself is clear not hazy but the cost to get up to the top is quite expensive and once you are up there you are restricted with where you can walk unless you are actually staying at the hotel.
,,The best roof-top swimming pool in the world,5.0,,The Hotel has on top a bar and a park with a huge swimming pool alongside the roof. The view is breathtaking and it is worth visiting specially at night to enjoy all the lights of Singapore Bay Area around you. One of the fastest elevators that I have been too.
,,"Top view of Singapore, especially after dark",5.0,,"Star attraction with superb views from the roof top, especially in the evening. Experience not to forget but watch out for closing time in the evening!"
,,Best Place to stay in Singapore!!!,5.0,,"Awsome hotel...rooms were spacious and luxurious. Staff was veru helpful and service was excellent. What i loved the most about this hotel was pool at the top deck, having a dip in it was an out of the world experience.."
,,Must see when in Singapore,4.0,,"Awesome view of Singapore from the deck. There is a small fee required to go to the roof, but it's worth every cent.
The gardens are definitely worth a visit. Allow plenty of time, you could spend an entire day walking through them and not see everything. The gardens are free, the green houses aren't. Try and get a city pass which include them."
,,Very high but great view,5.0,,Very high up and great views over Singapore; however the day I went there was smoky haze from Malaysia so the extent of views was limited.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The gardens by the bay are amazing. Dont access the gardens by the adjacent shopping center if you are scared of heights as the escalators are fairly high up.
,,Great views.,5.0,,Gorgeous infinity pool to float around in while taking in the views of Singapore whilst watching a gorgeous sunset.
,,Only go if the weather is good and no smog or fog,3.0,,I imagine this would be nice on a good day when visibility was good unfortunately it was not great when we visited. Staff will advise before you purchase a ticket.
,,Best view of Singapore!!,4.0,,"Obs. deck offers a beautiful view of Singapore. On 56th floor, you can feel the wind blowing which brings you closer to nature....while offering beautiful views of garden by the bay, flyer, and small ferries moving in the water....
This obs. deck is higher then the flyer and doesn't have any time limitation. A small restaurant on the deck offers drinks, snacks and souvenirs as well ....
overall this place is worth visiting...... :)"
,,awesome building,5.0,,"marina bay was simply astounding building, it was one of the places where people would just look at it and stay amazed. the idea of such a building is just unimaginable for some people. one would think who would have pictured to build such an amazing building."
,,Lovely amazing garden,4.0,,"Amazing garden with so many kind of tress and flower, nice place to walk around for sport or family gathering"
,,Well worth a MISS,1.0,,Looks like it was designed by a 5 year old child from a distance. Up close it's ridiculously priced for access then any food or drinks purchased are ludicrously expensive.
,,Best Place to stay in Singapore!!!,5.0,,"Awsome hotel...rooms were spacious and luxurious. Staff was veru helpful and service was excellent. What i loved the most about this hotel was pool at the top deck, having a dip in it was an out of the world experience.."
,,Must see when in Singapore,4.0,,"Awesome view of Singapore from the deck. There is a small fee required to go to the roof, but it's worth every cent.
The gardens are definitely worth a visit. Allow plenty of time, you could spend an entire day walking through them and not see everything. The gardens are free, the green houses aren't. Try and get a city pass which include them."
,,Very high but great view,5.0,,Very high up and great views over Singapore; however the day I went there was smoky haze from Malaysia so the extent of views was limited.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The gardens by the bay are amazing. Dont access the gardens by the adjacent shopping center if you are scared of heights as the escalators are fairly high up.
,,Great views.,5.0,,Gorgeous infinity pool to float around in while taking in the views of Singapore whilst watching a gorgeous sunset.
,,Only go if the weather is good and no smog or fog,3.0,,I imagine this would be nice on a good day when visibility was good unfortunately it was not great when we visited. Staff will advise before you purchase a ticket.
,,Best view of Singapore!!,4.0,,"Obs. deck offers a beautiful view of Singapore. On 56th floor, you can feel the wind blowing which brings you closer to nature....while offering beautiful views of garden by the bay, flyer, and small ferries moving in the water....
This obs. deck is higher then the flyer and doesn't have any time limitation. A small restaurant on the deck offers drinks, snacks and souvenirs as well ....
overall this place is worth visiting...... :)"

,,Stunning go view !,5.0,,"Stunning view, love jogging around the Marina Bay Area, enjoy the air conditioning mall at sands, few nice coffee shops and western food dining restaurants wanna try"
,,Top of the world,4.0,,"a great place to be if one wants to experience a swim near to the sky. nicer place to view Singapore city, instead of the Flyer"
,,exceptional view 360°,5.0,,"not to be missed, this is a must go in Sing... be prepared to wait at least 30' to go up with the lift and the same for your way back but the view on top is just breathtaking, the river, the harbour, the skyline... do it at night or sunset... it costs approx 20$ but your camera will find it worth the price ;-)"
,,"tiny,dont bother.",3.0,,very dissapointing :-( 2reasons--> smoke from Sumatra blanketed the city&our view was nothing short of terrible&the other dissapointment is once@the top your restricted to a small area of the Skypark.Its famous for the pool view !
,,Always love this place,5.0,,Once again loved visiting triple towers of Marina Bay. My yonh daughter took. About 700 picture of places around in less than two hours.
,,Amazing Views over Singapore,4.0,,"There are two ways to see Singapore from the top. Skydeck at Marina Sands is the higher one with the better views. Unfortunately, if you want full access to the deck, you have to stay at the hotel. Visitor access is limited to a small part of the deck but the views are still worth it. The visitor deck has plaques describing the view and attractions along the railing and food and dining options at the center. It provides amazing views over the Marina, Gardens by the Bay and the sea beyond on one side. On the other side, it offers views over Singapore City.

Being open to the elements, the deck is at the mercy of the weather. So plan accordingly. Even on a clear day, make sure to go early in the morning to avoid the heat.

Worth a visit if you are in Singapore. Combine it with a visit to the nearby Gardens by the Bay if you have the time."
,,"""Sky - high""",4.0,,"Even though you only get 'glimpses' for free from the tower 3 on certain evenings (NOT Fridays or sats) - it's still worth a trip. Views are inevitably spectacular - even at night and in haze. Would be better if they opened the bar space up a bit (gets very tight) - perhaps lose a dining table or two. Inevitably drinks are also 'sky high' prices - S$14 for a non- alcoholic fruit punch!!
Also impressive (more so) from a distance - with one of the largest cantilevered platforms in the world. Links well into gardens in bay and shopping centre (albeit high- end designer outlets and jewellery)."
,,You can visit once,3.0,,"It is located on the 57th fllor of the iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotels. The Skypark with Infinity pool. It was so packed and you can even swim. Just to take picture or selfie from the pool to get Singapore's highrises building as a background. It is nice at night. If you are not staying in the hotel, you need to pay for entrance fee but if you are a hotel's guest then you are able to go up freely."
,,Not just an Infinity Pool,5.0,,This hotel is luxurious and grand but the service is very personal and staff genuinely care about the comfort of clients.
,,"Okk to visit once, but Singapore Flyer has better view and experience.",3.0,,"You are allowed to go only front side of the SkyPark, which is like 30% of entire skypark. To access entire skypark you need to be a hotel guest. I would recommend to visit Singapore Flyer instead of Skypark to get better value out of your money."
,,Expensive but elegant Bar on the roof top,4.0,,Wow what a view is what one would say. All along the periphery the bar is situated on the roof top close to the inifinity pool which is only for hotel guests. Enjoy the ambience in the evening as Singapore lits up and savour the drinks and finger food at this amazing place.
,,A fantastic view of Singapore,4.0,,"On our first day in Singapore we decided we'd take a stroll to see the marina bay gardens but on the way we took a jaunt up to the top of the marina sands hotel (the one made up of three towers and what appears to be an ocean liner straddled across the top).
The views to all sides are amazing, looking down across the whole city - fantastic photo opportunities and all were take I can assure you"
,,A must place to visit in Singapore.,5.0,,Excellent place to visit in the evening. One can see the entire Singapore from the park. The place is expensive though for the experience.
,,Pricey but worth it,4.0,,"The Skypark is an observation deck located on top of the Marina Sands hotel.
If you are not a guest of the hotel you can not sit at the restaurant or go swimming in the infinity pool. Instead for the hefty price of 30SGD you'll be granted the best view of Singapore ever possible.

Personal advice - go after the sun has set down.
Below you will be the Gardens by the bay, on the left the Singapore Flyer and on the other side a close up view of the skyscrapers of downtown. And in the distance - rows, upon rows of ships in the bay."
,,Sounds better than it looks,2.0,,Just another view of a city skyline. Suggest you head straight to the bar for a drink rather than buy the ticket to the Observation Deck - it only costs a little more and you actually get something out of it.
,,Beautiful at night,5.0,,"Three of us went quite close to the last entry time and it meant we didn't have to queue at all but still had plenty of time to take in the stunning view. I'm glad I did this when I went to Singapore, I suggest this should be one of the first things you do as its really helpful to get your bearings and work out where things are."
,,Impressive Architecture,4.0,,"We were impressed by the statement these buildings make on the landscape, and the views from the top. Distant views spoilt by too much smog and haze.

We entered through the Marina Bay Shopping Centre. Enjoyed the large water feature but by this time were totally unimpressed with all the big name brands.

Still well worth the visit."
,,Nice views,3.0,,"I gave it a 3 due to the price of it as you can go on to the viewing deck 1st floor but not the 2nd as you would have to pay extra for that.

Views are amazing plus seeing the sun was amazing to.

Would I recommend as a 1 one off yes"
,,Skypark amazing view,5.0,,"I came 10min before closing. We payed 23S$, for one person. The view on the city is astonishing, you can see gardens on one side, and F1 track on another with buildings. If you come to Singapore plan to visit this place."
,,Dissapointed,1.0,,"Very poor, inattentive service, over priced ($28 for a Tiger). There are plenty of better roof top experiences in Singapore, won't be back."
,,Best lighting at night,4.0,,A huge building formed like a ship that have a beautiful scenery at night with all the lightings and so on.
,,Excellent View,5.0,,An excellent place to get a bird's eye view of Singapore city centre. The night with the city lights is marvellous. A good place to catch fireworks during the Singapore National Day and to watch the F1 race from afar.
,,Great views from iconic building!,4.0,,"We went up on a weekday afternoon, and didn't have to queue. When we got up it was busy but roomy enough to find a space to lookout. The views over Singapore are great! Make sure it's not raining though as there's little or no shelter, and no refunds!"
,,Not a must see - even if you are right there,3.0,,"We went there with a friend in the evening for a drink. The cocktails were wushu washy and we estimated that we each got one teaspoonful of alcohol in our respective drinks - at the price they are charging - >30$, it is a rip off.

As for the views - you get just as nice a view on the roof top of the Esplanade and it is free! If you are 'thirsty' you can byo drinks there or hop over to 'Orgo' for a drink.

I wrote a good review for Orgo some times back but went back two weeks later and had a so-so experience. My guess is that they only do certain drinks well (e.g. Singspore sling or the lychee martini) and do stinge on the spirit as well ... . Sigh ... - there are not many places you can get a decent honest cocktail with quality spirit."
,,WHAT A VIEW!!!,5.0,,"When you enter the Marina Bay Sands hotel do go on top, a tad expensive is the ticket to watch the view from a top, but once you get to the top its worth the price paid. AND WHAT A VIEW FROM THE TOP!!! Mindblowing"
,,Mixed feelings,5.0,,"The ambience is exceptional. The process to check in is rapid and you get a free drink.

You are taken to your room. The room is very spacious and beautifully designed. The bathroom allows for privacy as the toilet is separated by a door. The bathtub and shower is stunning and you feel like you are in a spa. It had a double basin so makes the morning rush easier for two people. The room is fully equipped with outstanding teas and coffees. The view is breathtaking.

Based on the pool experience I was a bit disappointed. The reason is that the water is really cold. So it makes it difficult to spend long hours in the pool and more hours just relaxing at the pool side. I enjoyed the jacuzzi the most.. its very well maintained and towels are available in abundance.

Definitely will go again"
,,Great but why not have a drink with no entrance fee at Ku De Ta one floor up.,4.0,,At Ku De Ta you have the same view and can put that entrance fee towards a cocktail. Views are stunning and a romantic place to watch the sun set.
,,Too big and BUSY!!!!,3.0,,"A stunning piece of architecture but.... Overpriced and busy. Nice room but a bit misson to get to the pool. There are 6 lifts per tower but there is always a wait for one and then its like playing sardines. The pool is always busy and the wooden boardwalk is lethal when wet. The bar was small and extremely busy and not a nice atmosphere. The staff are extremely pleasant/helpful but it confirms my belief that the way forward is small boutique hotels. If you like crowds, gambling and shopping and dont mind paying over the odds this is for you. If not come ans visit and stay elsewhere."
,,Over Hyped,3.0,,"Too costly, when you can do a lot more at other points of interest, too much crowd at all times except at noon. No entry to the infinity pool is a big letdown.Nothing to do other than talking some panoramic photos and selfies."
,,Awesome views of Singapore.....abd beyond.,5.0,,With out a doubt the best way to see all of Singapore and well worth the entrance fee. A visit wouldn't be complete without a toast to Singapore with a cocktail at C'est La Vie.
,,"Great views, and considerably cheaper than staying at the hotel!",4.0,,"If you can't afford to stay in the hotel next door then this cheaper alternative is a great way to see the Singapore skyline. Unlike other high worldwide rooftop attractions (such as London's Shard) I found it nice to not be penned in behind glass, not to feel rushed and enjoy feeling a cool breeze on a hot day. There was plenty of room to walk around and only a few people there although this may have been the time of year (August). The viewing area is at one end of the Marina Bay Sands hotel complex so don't expect 360 degree views but you can see much of the city. There is no access to the hotel facilities such as the famous rooftop pool. A small cafe sold refreshing fruit smoothies which we enjoyed as an extra treat."
,,Skypark - brilliant view,4.0,,Visiting this place after sunset is a good idea. Even though it is crowded (especially during weekends) the view is spectacular. Within walking distance from Singapore Flyer.
,,Stunning views!,5.0,,"This is situated on the top of Singapore's most iconic buildings. Not for the faint-hearted as it is on the 57th floor, if you don't like heights, this is not for you! Great views over the city and of the infinity pool on the 58th floor."
,,Rooftop Adventure,4.0,,"If you don't like heights then I wouldn't recommend this for you as this will get you HIGH in a legal sense. Offering a stunning view of almost all of Singapore, you feel like you're in the clouds. Certainly worth ticking off in you're in the Marina area, as we tied it in with a visit to the Gardens by the bay, the Merlions and a trip over the Helix bridge."
,,WOW...view,5.0,,"57 stories high excellent view of Singapore and harbour, it is a must when visiting Singapore, you can also have a drink up you But have to use another door entrance no 1 told us."
,,Needs to be cleaner and not so expensive for what they offer.,2.0,,"We wanted to see the views, however we made it to the basement ticket front and it smelled like 1,000 students dirty socks in the sun for days. Further, paying SG$23 for just a ""deck"" viewing is a bit rich. We just ran out of the place without even bothering coming back."
,,Disappointing!,2.0,,"Great view of Singapore, however would of preferred spending my money on something else. $23.00 per person just to go up on observation deck & take photos! Small cafe up there but food is highly overpriced! Pool & interesting things are only for hotel guests.
I would say the view from the Domes or walking between gardens by the bay & marina sands is just as nice.
Don't waste your money!"
,,It has the best view of Singapore,5.0,,"Fantastic view of Singapore. I just love swimming here, though it can get really crowded at times. It is best to visit during night time."
,,Attitude Problem,2.0,,I had a visiting friend who was celebrating a birthday and wanted to revisit the Skypark for a drink. We had been before 4 years ago and they enjoyed drinks at Ku De Ta. There's been a change of establishment but my friends were keen to go as it was their last night in Singapore. The experience was spoilt by the dragon lady downstairs who took one look at my shorts and decreed that I did not make the dress code. I was wearing a smart pair of dress shorts as well as proper shoes but I do understand and respect that there was a dress code but it is not kosher to treat potential customers as if they were dirt. My friends decided not to stay as it meant I would not have been able to join them. Only the club lounge as the Skypark was closed for a private event. I guess they are a victim of their own success. I will not return and will not take visitors there ever again.
,,Best viewing at dusk,4.0,,"The entrance to the Skypark was a little hard to find initially as it's contained near the hotel entrance.

Cost was $23 to access the Skypark, and there's the optional photoshop opportunity although at $70 for 2 photos with picfolio, it was a little expensive.

The view from the Skypark is great - note that you don't get 360 degree views as part of the rooftop contains the hotel pool and therefore only accessible to hotel guests.

We visited before lunch, and were advised the view is better on dusk or at night so you can see the Gardens of the Bay all lit up.

Nice to visit."
,,Stunning views stunning location,5.0,,"OMG what an amazing Hotel the Marina Bay Sands is. Tickets for the Sky park are available just next to the hotel entrance.
You take a fast lift to the top and are met with the most amazing view of Singapore Marina Bay.
There is a wooden walk way with a glass screen all round. The views are spectacular. You can also visit the bar located at the end point of the Skypark, Show your tickets for access. The bar area can get very busy especially if you visit as the sun is setting. Prices for drinks are very very expensive, but the view makes up for the shock of the bar costs!!.
Sit on the deck and watch the sun going down and then you will have an amazing view of the Singapore lights from Marina Bay waterfront and buildings around."
,,Great view but ...,3.0,,"The view is great, but I guess yoy spend more time in the elevator that taking pictures upthere. There is nothing else to do besides 2 or 3 pictures to part of Singapore."
,,stunning views,4.0,,very cool this is a slick building where the shiny happy people go. The views are amazing from every angle inside and outside and on the 57th floor the views of the water and skyline are stunning. If you only have a few minutes while on a whistlestop then get to this building and dash upstairs to have a look.
,,So well planned,5.0,,Easily accessible by the MRT you can stroll around this well maintained garden for hours. The Sky domes are also impressive as well as the sky walk. The only thing I would say is to bring a hat as a lot of the vegetation is low level and it can get very hot walking around. The views from the gardens are also impressive.
,,The Must to.,5.0,,"You should pick the day which sky is clear. Take your time during around 5.30 pm.- 7.30 pm. to see both of Day view-Sunset-Night view in Singapore. If you are solo traveller, recommend that do not forget to use long equipment of camera to take photo of your with view background by yourself.
After fully with Sand sky park atmosphere, you can go down to MBS foodcort,... and after that enjoy with Singapore River Water Show at night (The show was performed besided MBS)"
,,To be on top of the world,5.0,,What an unbelievable views very reasonably priced and the only place to offer travellers seniors discount great great great
,,Bad value for money,2.0,,"23 sgd a person to go up in a lift to an observation deck, without a café to have some drinks. You are confined to a small space, away from the rest of the skyparc. Nice view but not worth the money if you ask me."
,,View is ok,3.0,,After we have been in Garden by the bay we went up here for the view. Yes it is better then the paris wheel but I felt also the price is high enough. Singapore skyline is also not like othere towns
,,Anand Patel,5.0,,The view from this place is awesome...unfortunately we didnt stay at the hotel so couldnt goto the pool but still reccomend going up and checking out singapore from up there
,,excellent,5.0,,"In south east asia, nothing is comparable to this park. Well maintained, clean. You can take MRT to find this location. Its not far from China town. Everything is nearby (food, mall, public transport) etc."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,"the view from the infinity pool was great, but the pool area was so busy all the time and the water wasn't so clean. everybody just wants to take selfies around the pool and that's it. By The Bay from the balcony was fantastic. Food was overpriced but to be expected in a place like this."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"There's an exhilarating feeling when you're on top and that's what you'll fee here. The sights of Singapore at night is truly breathtaking! Although admission here is a bit pricey, it's all worth it. We booked dinner in one of the restaurants at MBS and we truly enjoyed the experience. The infinity pool was fascinating."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"Yes like the other reviews, there is an amazing view down over the city and its fabulous to see the different gardens of Singapore from above. Little bit pricey but we felt it was worth it"
,,Magnificent views of Singapore from here!,5.0,,When we reached the top we were stunned by the gorgeous breath taking scenery. Its beautiful during the day and even more stunning at night when all the lights are on. Its also perfect for watching the rhapsody in light tree show at Gardens by the bay.
,,Perfect place to watch Singapore!,5.0,,"I was there during scorching hot Tuesday but its worth the sunburn! The view was amazing. Please go during weekdays, not many people will be there so your chances to snap beautiful picture (multiple time) are high! Don't forget to bring your camera (DSLR, GoPro, SJCam or even your phone) and tripod/selfie stick if you're going alone like I do."
,,Nice lorr,4.0,,Thumbs up. Only go up so high wish got place to smoke. Smoke until high? Get it?? But don't have... still awesome view lah.
,,Fantastic Vantage Point,4.0,,The observation deck is a fabulous vantage point offering tremendous views of Singapore. It's pretty good value for money - the view is unsurpassed and arguably better than the Singapore Flyer.
,,A must do,4.0,,"Since marina sands bay is ome of the iconic hotels in singapore, the observation deck is a must see.
The ticket only allows you access to the observation deck and not the pool
The deck is packed with people so is the restaurant there. I wont stay in the hotel though since i guess the pool will be even much more packed with people"
,,Amazing Hotel,5.0,,"We watched the light show from the viewing gallery at the hotel about 8.30 each night which was amazing. You can walk through the hotel lobby from one side to the other, its an amazing place to visit, and doesn't cost anything."
,,View from top of MBS,4.0,,"No tripods on the top of skypark. Views from the skypark was really good, where the visitors will be able to view the skyline and sea view of Singapore"
,,"Great view, but where is the service?",3.0,,"The skypark gives you an amazing view over Singapore skyline and the Marina bay area, however the service from the staff ruined the experience for me, with rude staff!"
,,Ahh-mazing,5.0,,This was the most breathtaking moment for us. Amazing & beautiful view at the Skypark. Though my knees are shaking because have fear of heights but yet i overcomed it with hubby on my side. Excellent architectural design. One of Singapore's highlight with the lovely view from the pool. If youre going to visit Singapore please don't miss to see Skypark.
,,"Breathtaking view, at a price",4.0,,"Brilliant view over Singapore, with a large viewing gallery in which to see it all. You had to queue to buy tickets but that doesn't allow you access to the spectacular rooftop pool. The cafe is expensive, but then so is everything in Singapore!"
,,"Excellent, Amezing",5.0,,signature hotel of singapore. amazing swimming pool. suitable for everybody. great breakfast.every thing fantastic.
,,Expensive but view is spectacular,5.0,,You HAVE to come here for the incredible view & experience of being on top of one of the most iconic buildings of the present time. Expensive but worth it as long as you don't have more than one!
,,Amazing views but be prepared to queue,4.0,,"We were hoping to catch the sunset at the SkyPark. Little did we know there was a crowd queuing to buy/collect tickets AND a long queue to take the lift up. The night view was really amazing though.

And, a queue formed at around 9 pm, to take the lift down. Just be prepared to spend at least half hr in each queue.

Other tips: bring a good camera to snap up amazing views (if you are not offended by people getting into your pictures); no tripods allowed; you can get a coffee at the counter, but it is more expensive than usual."
,,Spectacular building,4.0,,A spectacular architectural project. With a perfect view from the 52th floor over the bay of Singapore. Perfect for a tour and see the panoramic views during the day and at night.
,,stunning view,5.0,,"its a must to go up to this sky park the view of the boats alone is magnificent,we counted 86 vessells out on the water,a fantastic place"
,,Great View!,4.0,,"Well its got a great view, you have the great bay and the city skylines! One visit is surely enough though!"
,,Exceptional View from the 57th floor,5.0,,"For those staying at the hotel the skypark is amazing. The pool is refreshing in the sweltering heat and the bar and restaurant are lovely - Cool and with great service. Vermar (I think that was his name) provided great service for drinks and food while we spent time by the pool.

This was our haven from the heat without airconditioning."
,,Just an amazing work of art,5.0,,"Wow can only describe this building just amazing. Had a coffee, juice and 2 cakes and it came to S$45 yummy but! You can takes the lift to the 57th floor and look out all over Singapore but can't enter the infinity pool area any more, too many tourists spoiled it."
,,Slypoint,5.0,,"Fantastic views from the Skypark - looking out over the gardens to across the city, fabulous view await"
,,Opulence in overdrive.,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore. We went to the bar for a drink instead of paying for the observation desk. Breathtaking views of the city at night. Access to the infinity pool is restricted to hotel guests. Yes it is expensive to have drink there but worth it.
,,Perfect Singapore View,5.0,,MBS Skypark on 57th level observation deck and view is quite amazing.I been there several times and best is around 6-7 pm to enjoy sun set and spectacular view.Ticket cost 23$ per pax and really worth it.Another option is go to Flight bar and lounge or CÉ LA VI which doesn't need to pay entrance fees and enjoy the view while sipping one or two drinks and this is what I always did :P
,,What a view.....,5.0,,"SkyPark is on the 56th floor (don't forget to clear your ears) and it, the view, is spectacular. Its open air with a restaurant on the top floor. The buildings are numbered on a map with some information attached. If you like the gold coast tower in queensland you'll love this."
,,Best view in Singapore,4.0,,"This is an iconic building and worth a visit. It's really expensive but like all things you have to weigh that up against the opportunity you have to experience something really cool. The view is spectacular of course but the building itself is really impressive. Even the hotel foyer is something to check out.
There's not much shade on the skydeck so make sure you take a hat."
,,wonderful,4.0,,"a very nice place to view the & marina bay from the top, but you have to be the Hotel resident to have a full access."
,,Novelty wears thin quickly,1.0,,"Visited the place for drinks just to see what the hype was all about and was thrilled for all of 10 minutes.

First up, the drinking hole formerly known as Ku De Ta is simply too hot if you're there too early. The views are nice once the sun goes down but after a while it gets boring. The service. .....well, let's just say you'd get loads of unwanted attention from the other female patrons if you're a white caucasian while Asians get the shorter end of the straw even with service. Why would anyone come here is anyone's guess.
We took a stroll to check out what my companion jokingly calls the world's most frequently photographed swimming pool and he probably wasn't kidding. We left feeling a tinge of pity for he actual guests of the hotel."
,,Wear pants if you plan to go to the top!,4.0,,"A nice stop while touring Singapore as it seems to be the thing to do. Lovely hotel. My husband and I stood in line to go to the top for a good while only to find out ""no short pants"" for men. It was the weekend of the ""50th Anniversary for Singapore. We had a drink and dinner at restaurant in the hotel."
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,"The Skypark was the last item in our itinerary. We thought it would be nice to see Singapore from top as to wrap up our trip..and it was worth it. The view from top was breathtaking and we could see iconic buildings and landmarks below. They offered us the picture taken before but the price was too expensive for a photoshopped pic. It wasn't very realistic anyway, so we skipped it. The Skypark ride to the top and the view were all recommended to try."
,,Tower 3 if you want a cocktail on the roof,5.0,,"Go before 9 and there's no admission charge. Enjoy a Singapore Sling at the top and soak in the incredible views. Not cheap, but not exorbitant either. Lovely by day or evening."
,,Top attraction!,5.0,,"This is a must-see top attraction! There is a free version to the Skypark by visiting the 57th floor of tower 1 plus 3. However, one gets a better view from the Skypark platform on the 56th floor of tower 3 plus it is also the only place one can take photos towards the Gardens By The Sea without shooting through glass. Open till 10pm! We find evening visits more attractive, but that is a personal opinion."
,,What a veiw,5.0,,"Well worth the visit either by your self or as part of a tour it is well worth the time to see 360 view the only problem is when it's busy it can be a wait for the lift down. They take your photo as you enter the lift and it is ready for you when you get out of the lift,"
,,Not family oriented hotel,1.0,,"The staffs are rude in restaurants, skypark bar and swimming pool. Not family oriented, a lot of restriction even for hotel guest. The whole hotel is like supermarket, crowded, long queue everywhere. I don't think I will come back again, even!"
,,Expensive for just a view,3.0,,I guess it's about paying for a view from above. For that money $23 per person. I would hope a bottle of water was included.
,,Wow wow wow,5.0,,I loved this the most. amazing view and beautiful service. Cannot swim in pool unless a guest but that's fair enough. Highly recommend this.
,,Stunning! Speechless! Serrrrrr,4.0,,"Please be there during sunset until night time, the views were so gorgeous! For a sky lover like me, this is one of the good spot to be experienced. On the level 56 of the observation deck, u can see Singapore skyscrapers around, the lighting show and whats happening down there at the museum science. However, infinity pool at level 57 is only for hotel guests. By the way, please make your self a welcome guest by visiting their ce la vi, formerly known as ku de ta. The drinks are just awesome!!"
,,Spectacular,4.0,,To start off I am scared of heights and found this one quite difficult. The views are amazing in many directions. Would love to have been able to see the pool.
,,"Expensive, but great view",3.0,,"Expensive to just go upto the observation deck (£11.00).However, great views, especially if you're a Grand Prix lover as you can see clearly the main pit area."
,,Visiting Singapore without Marina Bay is like cake without icing.,5.0,,"One can't imagine the view from 200 meter height until unless he is at Marina Bay Sands. The view from 57th Floor, the observation desk is spectacular. It will take you 40 secs by elevator to reach 57th floor. You will see the best panaromic view, even better than the view you will get from Singapore Flyer. It is a must see, as it soothens the naked eye."
,,WOW!,5.0,,"An amazing experience! Photos and videos do not do justice to the Skypark. it is one of those have-to-see-to-sights. My husband suffers from vertigo, but even he was stunned - in a good way! The bar is expensive, but worth the view. This is an iconic Singapore sight not to be missed..."
,,Great View!!,5.0,,What a view!!! Singapore looks lovely. And we were there on Singapore's Golden National Day. Had a great view of the fireworks.
,,marvel,4.0,,An architectural beauty. Makes you wonder how they built it. Well decorated at night (but probably because we were around for the 50th anniversary of singapore) If you plan to go to the top you can skip it if you got a window seat on your flight into singapore. youll see the same thing. can save quite a buck
,,Best place to see Singaphore,5.0,,You should go to the top of the building. We sat in the restaurant enjoying great Cappuccino and cake and watching the breathtaking view.
,,Great view,4.0,,"Beautiful building great view, but going solo just isn't the same as going with friends. Would stay there for sure, but pricey."
,,View singapore from here,4.0,,The View from the Deck of this Hotel is very spectacular. There is Swimming pool also on the deck apart from some other things.
,,An hour wait to get back down,3.0,,"Good way to see everything but there was queues to get up in the lift and had to wait an hour to get down as they had let so many people up at once the shop didn't have any ice cream, which was all they sold except drinks.overal it was quite a hassle just to see a view,which a lot of other hotel had similar."
,,Nasir j,5.0,,It is the place to visit in Singapore.fantastic view of Singapore not to miss at all. The ship like shape of d sky park is worth visiting whether in the day or late evening.
,,Magnificent Views of Singapore,5.0,,Well worth the $23 ticket cost (adults) for a great view from the 57th Floor of the Marina Bay Sands - always a good idea to phone check first to make sure it is not closed for a private function
,,On top,5.0,,The hotel is very classy ... the employees are friendly.. we had a room on the 35th floor with an amazing view of the river and city. We later had a relaxing time in the infinity pool on the 57th floor it was crowded of people but lovely experience
,,Definitely worth a visit,5.0,,We were staying in the hotel so were able to use the Skypark for free but I have heard it's pricey but definitely worth it. The view is fantastic and probably better at night when it's all lit up. The decking area is big so plenty of room to walk round. You can buy a souvenir photo whilst you are there which is really well presented in a frame. You wouldn't need to set aside heaps of time to do this but there isn't a time limit and whilst in Singapore I would definitely say to do it. There is also the Singapore Flyer which offers a great view but I think the Skypark offers the better view and would personally say you'd only need to do one or the other.
,,Flight Bar was amazing.,5.0,,"We only had one drink, and it was exorbitantly price, but the view was breathtaking. There in time for the laser light show, what a treat! World class drinks, service and an incredible view. Utterly glamerous."
,,Amazing view !,5.0,,"Very Modern Hotel , on the top there is an amazing view definitely worth the visit .Great for picturing the city !"
,,Family holiday,4.0,,"This building is amazing. You see it as you drive to the city from the airport and it is an attraction, not just a hotel. You can go inside and you can go up to the sky eck and get amazing views over the city."
,,Loud and flashy but worth it.,5.0,,"We stayed in the hotel so we had unlimited access. We have been here before and would happily do it again. Look, it loud, crowded and for food and beverages its expensive. Its also a selfie paradise...but at sunset its amazing. At 9:00pm with the light show its brilliant. If you can get a sunbed and a towel this is a great place, just ignore the kids and the endless photo's."
,,"Excellent View, but super busy at all times of the day",4.0,,"Very busy, only open to hotel guests (all 5000+ of them) Majority of people are taking selfies which ruins any photo you want to get. Pool water not clean, a lot of floating bits in the pool. There is an adults only section which is great as they kick out any children swimming in there that shouldn't be. There is construction works going on (as of July 2015) so limited views of the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Go for a drink,4.0,,"Went for a drink on the top of the Skypark. Didn't pay the extra to go to the viewing platform, which is also free for guests, as didn't think there was much to be gained in the way of views."
,,what amazing views,5.0,,"as i went back to singapore for the 5th time i havent had a chance to go up the sky park, my god it was hot day, just remember water, camera and suncream.
managed to get amazing photos of marina barage, gardens by the bay, kallang, the new stadium and over to indnoesia and malaysia"
,,Best View of Singapore,4.0,,The view is breath taking. It is a must to enjoy this central master piece of the Singapore skyline.
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,"I didn't have to stand in line to go up to the skypark. I decided to go there between 7 and 8 pm this is the time when the sun goes down in SIngapore. I had a beautiful cload formation during sunset and after the sunset a beautiful skyline and I could see the water play in Marina Bay (the water play starts at 8 pm).
The still think 23 S$ is too much but it's Singapore and everything is expensive."
,,Top view from level 57.,5.0,,"Want to visit the top of the Sands Hotel (free)? If you are neatly dressed and behave, walk to tower #1- reception area, when it is buzy, just smile and walk into any lift (elevator) with other hotel guests and press button 57.wait a few seconds and Wow...what a fantastic view!! The lifls will return you to ground level anytime..... Just try it, we did!!"
,,Beautiful views of Singapore skyline and sunset,4.0,,Beautiful views of Singapore skyline and sunset. Good environment to relax after a long day of meetings in Singapore and just enjoy the sunset and views
,,Amazing view..,5.0,,We visited here in June.2015..It was worth to visit this place..In fact this wasn't there in our standard iternary..We took MRT from little India to Marina bay. I would say..Don't miss it..amazing view from top..U can watch entire singapore skyline from here.
,,Good view of the Bay.,4.0,,"We visited on a Saturday night, maybe not the best decision but the view was fab. Lots of people, we queued for an hour after purchasing our ticket but the line moved along reasonably quickly. Many people were sitting on the floor which clogged up the viewing area, cost 23 Sing Dollars."
,,The View was Worth the Price of Admission,4.0,,Good views of the city and decent food outlets. It is located on one end of the Marina Bay Sands. You cannot walk around the entire perimeter which is a shame.
,,Nice lookout Singapore skyline,3.0,,"We haven't been on the top, it was to crowded, but outside the holidays worth while to have a look. Maybe next time we will have another change."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Yes this attraction is a little expensive and the photos really are a rip off, but you have to do it! The views are unbelievable and you can spend as long as you want taking pictures and looking over Singapore. We went at night which I highly recommend - stunning!!"
,,General,5.0,,It is most beautiful and specially the laser show is worth seening it we'll connected by MRT and the sure ending garden building are looking very beautiful especially in light time with light
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"So here is a piece of architecture the world isn't ready to forget! Despite the amazing view, and especially from the pool ( stay a night there, just for the pool, it is worth it!), the sky park offers one of the best spot to admire a sunset. Get there by 6, and sip your favourite drink while watching it go down slowly... it's really worth it!"
,,Great View,5.0,,"Can only repeat what everyone else has said...however, we just got into the lift and went to the top! We didn't see any signs saying there was a charge and there was no-one by the lifts so we just got in with everyone else. At the top there were areas only hotel guests could go but nobody asked us for a ticket anywhere else."
,,Great combination!,5.0,,The skypark itself is nothing but the park on top of a huge building overlooking Singapore is really a sight to see!
,,Make the right choice to make the most of your visit.,3.0,,"Offers a fantastic view of the Bay/Ocean and CBD. I only give it a three star review because it lacks a few things and is a bit gouging, over $20 to access, of course they try to soak you for a photo for $50! WOW...really?! There is no place to sit and take it all in. There a lots of other places to enjoy a view and have a meal or a drink in Singapore. In fact , right there! look up just above you is the bar/lounge and a restaurant. Don't let the thought of a 20 drink scare you,,,you might pay 20 dollars for the same view and NO DRINK. So please if you have the choice to make, go for the bar have a seat enjoy the view and have a drink for your $20. Best time is around 6pm. still lots of sun and the sun will set over the city by about 7:15 and you get to enjoy the lights of the city at night too!"
,,Magnificent,5.0,,This is an amazing structure which dominates the skyline in Singapore. The sky park is well worth a visit just to see the magnificent views.
,,Great view - for a price,3.0,,"There seems to be things that one simply has to do when one is visiting a city, and in Singapore it is to pay $23.00 to go up to the top of the Marina Bay Sands and have a look at the view. Hey, I'm not one for turning down fantastic views, and this is certainly one of them, but I must admit that for $23.00 there is a lot to be desired. In fact for us plebs who are only willing to pay $23.00 all you get is a view (and a small cafe) – there isn't even a place to sit for a drink. They do have a restaurant for those of us who aren't hotel guests (the main part of the roof, including the swimming pool, is reserved for guests only), but when I say that it is expensive, that is an understatement. All I wanted to do was sit down somewhere, have a beer, and take in the view. It turns out that that is not possible when you are on the observation deck. Still, it is a fantastic view, if you are willing to fork out the $23.00."
,,Singapore Sky Park,5.0,,This is one of the highlights of Singapore if not the highlight. This wonder of engineering needs to looked up close and the whole ambiance taken in. Hard to imagine that once this was ocean where it now stands. Fast lifts take you to the top for a fantastic panoramic view of the city of Singapore and the whole Marine Bay Area. I have been to the top of this hotel a number of times and the view is outstanding especially on a fine day. It's a must to visit and go to the top.
,,Fantastic view. Bar service is ok.,4.0,,"It's definitely a highlight and if you can afford it, enjoy a dinner there. We just took a drink and chilled by the stand-up bar.

The view is great. The bar service was average and below Singapore standards, at least for the night we went.

But the mall food was fantastic and the mall was beautifully designed. It's a great place to explore and eat for an affordable price."
,,Another must do in Singapore,4.0,,It cost us S$22 two years ago and I wish we had had time to do it again this month. Fabulous views over Singapore and if you pay more you can go into the swimming pool and rest of the attraction on the roof.
,,WORTH CHECKING IT OUT,5.0,,"Still amazing despite it can get very touristy. Who can blame them, with a pool at this height and the view of Singapore skyline. Definitely worth checking out when you visit singapore!"
,,Best sunset and night view,5.0,,Travel up at dusk and you can catch both the sunset scenery and night lights of the city. Stay up there as long as you like as the observation deck wont close until after 10pm
,,Great views,5.0,,Great view from the observation deck. I just wish that I could have afforded to stay there! The rooftop infinity pool looked excellent.
,,Visitor,5.0,,Amazing architecture. The rooftop pool is out of this world. The view is magnificent. The three towers are structures to behold
,,Spectacular,5.0,,"The view is breathtaking, definitely worth a visit. Go in the evening to enjoy the spactacular panorama of Singapore by night."
,,Ok but long wait to leave,4.0,,Lonely view of the ciri but just be aware that there can be a looooong wait when going to leave. Had to wait around over 30 minutes to be able to catch the lift down and leave.
,,Views!,3.0,,"We visited the 57th floor of this amazing structure and had lunch at Sky on 57. The food was stunning (separate review) and the views amazing, but we were disappointed at being refused entry to the pool area (not hotel guests) and not advised there was an observation deck.
The area we had access to - Tower 1 - was spectacular, however we would have liked to see the famous infinity pool."
,,Unique architectural design,4.0,,"Spectacular looking hotel design! We found that some of the best views of this area are either from the water (via duck tour boat) or from the Flyer, which allows you a view looking down onto the ship top."
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"No need to pay to get up there, just have a drink at the bar. Just take the lift at Tower 3. Drinks are expensive, but no more than tickets, and the drinks are very good. Worthwhile to check out the view."
,,Awesome,5.0,,You will never easily find this kind of architecture even in another vibrant big cities in the world. Amazing technologies has been applied and you will never forget your trip to this fantastic place. All I can say is : Spectacular !!!
,,great views for miles and miles,4.0,,Expensive ticket to go up and see the view but it is spectacular. You can either pay to go to the viewing platform with no entry to the bar/restaurant or ride up free but spend in the bar...
,,Landmark hotel,5.0,,"Visit the Skypark in the evenings to get a fabulous view of the city by night. If you can afford then book a table atop Marina Bay Sands for dinner, in advance! Don't miss the Casino, if you like to play!"
,,amazing,5.0,,"Visited Gardens by the bay, amazing place , visit it at night for the Garden Rhapsody, the light show was something you cannot miss, amazing"
,,good but something have same view in free,3.0,,"its good but you can get the same view form ION orchid, ION SKY at 56 level is worth mentioning. See 360 view of Singapore from here. Viewing Time: 3 to 6 pm daily. Admission is free. Must try once.Getting Here: You can get to the observatory from ION Orchard next to Orchard MRT. Get to ION Art Gallery on Level 4, then take the lift from there to Level 5
ION Orchard: From 1 May 2015, public access to ION Sky will be from 3pm - 6pm daily. Last entry is at 5.30pm. Admission is free"
,,An engineering marvel.,4.0,,"Wow - what a building! Certainly stands out on the city's skyline, drawing the eye. Full of things to see and places to eat and drink. Much time can be spent looking around and browsing. Certainly worth a visit. Unfortunately didn't go right to the top as one of group didn't relish going up so high, but when I return to Singapore, which I plan to do, will certainly make a poit of going all the way to the top."
,,Best View of Singapore,5.0,,"I love how this skypark made me fall in love with Singapore with just one aerial view. Definitely the best place to be hopeless romantic or just to simply appreciate the view. We went at around 6pm so we can see the sunset and experience SG on top under the moonlight. What's good about this skypark is that you can stay longer times for only 23 SGD. No food allowed to be brought inside anyway, there is a small store there where you can buy hotdogs in a bun for 10 SGD. If you have a budget for fine dining, you can dine at Ce La Vi."
,,Must see,4.0,,We visited SkyPark like Marina Bay Sands Hotel guests(free entry) and the amazing view from swimming pool is really very nice!
,,Awesome view but need to provide better facilities,5.0,,"Awesome view from the top. However, when i visited it was raining and there was no covered area for the visitors to go and stand. After paying a hefty sum for taking entry to this place, it is the least you can expect."
,,Go on the big wheel instead...,2.0,,"Waste of money. Booked through a tour agency, ended up having to traipse around half of Singapore to go and pick up the tickets at some random hidden booth (instead of at the entrance to the skypark!) only to get to the top and realise you can only access a very small area. The views are amazing but you don't get to see the beautiful infinity pool and trees and flowers that you see in the photos - these are all restricted. There is a restaurant but We weren't allowed to eat there either, we were only allowed in for a drink - and once we saw that it was around $20 for a beer we decided against it! Wish we had gone on the big wheel instead. Would have gotten the views and a better experience I think. Big let down."
,,One and Only Pool,5.0,,"amazing amaing amazing pool i never see like this pool in my life, i felt so relaxing and happy, really i will come again and agian"
,,Come do tourist things.,5.0,,"So it's hefty to get up there, either 23 or 28 sgd. Which isn't too bad but with the amount they probably rake in from their hotel it seems a bit much.

The view is amazing.

There are some spots of shade and you can buy water and soda up there."
,,"Great views, good cocktails",4.0,,Come here for a drink and views of the city. Expensive but offers interesting drinks and stunning views of city.
,,Iconic,5.0,,Iconic building in Singapore. Must visit casino and skypark though a little expensive. View is magnificent.
,,Singapore Skyline,4.0,,"Steep entry price, so consider making a booking at one of the restaurants in stead, which will give you instant access. Nice view of Singapore sky line. No place to sit and enjoy the vista, but if you want to avoid the pricy cafe, you can bring a picknick like many people seem to do."
,,Great Aerial View of Singapore,4.0,,I supposed you have to do it because you are on your holidays. You'll be restricted to a tiny area at the pointy end but you'll get a great view of Singapore from above. A bit pricey at $23 per adult.
,,Stunning Views!,5.0,,It's a lovely place to be in Singapore if you want to experience a panoramic view of the whole city. Great shopping experience too! They charge $20 to go to the rooftop but my advise is to tell the reception that you are going to the bar and you can get access to the roof top and the lounge area for free. Of course you need to order drinks.
,,Best views of Singapore! Beautiful!!,5.0,,"I enjoyed going here. You can enter and move to the lower levels, and see all the shops. You can go outside to the gardens level, and have a romantic stroll in one of the best spots I have ever gone too. DO IT!!"
,,Beautiful view of Singapore,5.0,,56th floor. Great view of Singapore. It was wonderful. Go before Sunset and stay till dark so that you can enjoy Singapore view in daylight and night.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Worth visiting for the view. Drinks and food prices are quite high and service for non-hotel guests is poor but the view compensates for it.
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"Fantastic view of the city from the top of this gorgeous building! This was worth the charge as when reached the top we could see all the way around the building, and decided on the next places to visit. Seeing part of the formula 1 track was very exciting for my boys!"
,,It has to bedone.,5.0,,"Make sure you do this. It is not cheap, you only get herded into a small zone at the top, you can gawp at the rich people in their infinity pool,but the reason you must go is the view of Singapore from the top. If you have been up the Empire State Building, this is something else. We loved the diversity of the landscapes.Do it."
,,Visually stunning and more so at night.,5.0,,Something for all ages! they cover botany from all over the world in natural settings as well as some cleverly devised settings.
,,Bucket list for Singapore,5.0,,"This is one of the must-see experiences in Singapore. So, head to level 57 and take a look out from C'est La Vie. It's not a real large area for visitors but go to the bar, take a cocktail or a beer and suck it all in."
,,Almost a Fantasy Land,5.0,,Fantastic place - you can even take a skywalk through the manmade ecological trees. The pathways lead through the gardens to the Gardens By the Bay.
,,awesome view,4.0,,Marina bay sands sky park was with incredible view from where you can see almost the whole Singapore from the roof top which is on 56th floor ... But the area from where you can enjoy the view is really small some 3/4th of the hotel's part ..
,,Singapore reference you shouldn't miss,5.0,,Singular and magnificent construction. Go inside and around to enjoy also the big mall. There is a Bar and Restaurant in the upper terrace from where the views are very good.
,,Amazing view...,4.0,,Visited with friends... Amazing view of the city as well as of the sea... Nice restaurant on top... Ticket was a bit expensive... But worth a visit atleast once... Overall very enjoyable experience...
,,Too expensive,3.0,,We went to the observation deck because my boyfriend loves to be in the highest building in every city we visit but to tell the truth paying 23 dollars to go there is too much.
,,Awesome views!,5.0,,"We were there at dusk to watch the sun go down and the city lights come up! it's breathtaking! We were able to watch the light show in the Gardens by the Bay as well as the laser show from the Marina Bay Sands . Both are better from the ground, but you get a unique perspective from the Skypark. Seeing the city from the top of the Marina Bay Sands was definitely a trip highlight!"
,,Great heights,4.0,,"The view was amazing - incredible! It was free to go to the top which i thought was great, cocktails and beers very exy but I guess you don't have to have one and they tasted pretty good if you do."
,,ok,3.0,,Water Laser show is worth to watch Boating is waste of time and money. Casino is good for tourist to Childrens not allowed
,,Nice place near the promenade,4.0,,"Visited it in August 2015. It's a big shopping center with various shopping boutiques, restaurants, a casino etc. It's very nice to visit, especially during the day when it's hot outside."
,,Incredible views,4.0,,Great mall underneath as well as casino. Lots of food offerings. Ate at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Excellent food. The views were also incredible. The infinity pool is accessible to only hotel patrons only.
,,Enjoy a drink and drink in the views!,3.0,,"You don't have to buy a ticket to see the views... Just take the lift to the roof-to bar. See the views, the pool and from the other side - the Marina Bay Gardens."
,,The most incredible hotel pool EVER,5.0,,The hotel pool and bar is in the shape of a ship and spans all three towers that comprise the hotel. An affinity pool for the brave hearted and a bar for the rest of us make this a must stop when staying in Singapore!
,,Great View from Above,4.0,,"A must go as the bar is the best place to have a birdeye view of Singapore Waterfront & finacial district especially at dusk with the setting sun. Went there enjoyed the SG50 #NDP2015 preview of the fly pass, fighter plane show & the firework. Great service staff"
,,Traveler trip,4.0,,"If you fancy the view without the price tag, head to Tower 1, level 22 and transfer to level 57 to ""meet a friend for a drink in the bar."" Get your areal photos (8:45pm for Gardens Trees light show) and head back down. Maybe have a drink if you're feeling in need of a treat as views from bar justify the price. Hotel cost $5.7 billion USD to build with 2,600 or so rooms so definitely worth an explore to take it all in"
,,High on the high rise view.,4.0,,"Just a few seconds are all it takes to rise 57 floors up, then the vista over all the city from a broad viewing platform wrapped around the front of the building. The harbour, the gardens by the bay, the Singapore flyer, the whole financial district high rise. It is posible to have the green screen picture taken before rising, your picture printed on a souvenir backdrop will be available for purchase at the top, if that is your wish."
,,top of the world,5.0,,"Thus sky park is very ""impressionant"". The swimming pool seems infinite. We were amazed and so were the children"
,,Visit Sky Park at MBS,5.0,,"Can have a great view, take photo etc. very windy and at affordable price. Can also view the infinity swimming pools."
,,Visit the bar not the Skypark,4.0,,"An amazing view of the city!

All though drinks are expensive, they are cheaper then nearby Raffles and you receive complimentary peanuts. The bar, which allows children in, is a great place to view the city from (but there are no chairs/stools at the tables-standing only).

It is cheaper to purchase drinks at the bar than to visit the Skypark on the level below."
,,Lovely View!,5.0,,Love the view at the top of Sands Skypark. The best time to come here is late afternoon before the sunset so that you can see the panoramic view of the city while with day light and you can just wait for the sunset to see the beautiful night view.
,,Breath-taking view,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is the skyscraper at the southern tip of the island. Looking inwards, you can see the breath-taking view of cosmopolitan Singapore's other tall buildings and skyscraper. The view at night is even more enchanting. Worth the money for an bird's eye view."
,,Feel at Home,5.0,,Great sight. amazing pool on the rooftop. Great surrounding. A nice meal at the restaurant. You can have a quick breakfast when you arrive from the Airport if your flight came in too early. The Hotel staff will get ready your room whilst you enjoy a cup of coffee or a full breakfast at the restaurant.
,,YOU HAVE TO VISIT THIS PLACE,4.0,,"visit this venue around 5 pm and stay until midnight. chill with cool drinks by the pool side or swim at singapore's highest pool, if you're not afraid of heights. i love to see singapore's skyline from the rooftop and watch sunset. it's romantic."
,,GO THERE!!!,5.0,,"Amazing view from the top, not so expensive for a really nice experience. To do during the night. Lovely."
,,Must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,The views here are spectacular. There is no other place like it in Singapore. Note - buying tickets ahead of time does not make the wait shorter.
,,Must do,5.0,,Amazing! Would love to go there again. Great view. Can see the whole city and right up the East Coast. Food n drink also good.
,,A tad boring,3.0,,"After about 5 minutes, it became a little boring...not much to see in terms of the Singapore skyline but the infinity pool looked very nice (although a bit too open). The restaurants are very pricey too!"
,,Overrated,4.0,,Overrated. Sure the views overlooking gardens by the bay during the night show might be nice but otherwise.. i think the pinnacle at duxton probably has just as good a view.
,,Great View,3.0,,Great view but overrated in my opinion and very expensive. There are always so many people and very crowded. Go for the view and take a photo - go elsewhere to eat and drink.
,,A must to visit while being in Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a masterpiece of architecture, a must have seen in asia.
Well other buildings there as well but this building together with the shoppingcenter along and the quai park around daytime and nighttime is amazing.
Going up there in a highspeed lift, you have a fantastic scenic view all around Singapore.
Good to know, that the infinty pool is just usable by hotel guests. You cannot entrance as a non guest, not even against payment.
A restaurant and a souvenir shop are up there.
It is simply amazing.
Well the fee about 90SGD for 3 persons is worth it.
Do miss it out"
,,Stunning views,3.0,,"Spectacular views of Singapore from the 'sky park' once you have looked around there is little to do. There is no seating available and limited facilities, not even shelter for the sudden Singapore tropical storms..... I got the feeling it was all about raising revenue $20+ per visitor. Just hanging around for the daytime to night time panoramic photographs and no where to enjoy the vista/soak up the skyline was disappointing."
,,Go to the bar instead,4.0,,"Go before 8pm (dress code is less strict and you will get in with tidy jeans and a tshirt) and buy a coke for $8. Similar view, way cheaper."
,,amazing,5.0,,"it was the most breathtaking place i have ever seen. if u visit singapur you have to stay in marina bay sands hotel one night. yes its expensive but this pool deserves that money... whole singapur is in front of you, and you r enjoying this viev with your beer in a pool. what a person wants more ??"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"This attraction is so worth a visit. The entire area around Marina Bay is very impressive.
We visited during the day & also went back at night. I was amazed how the plants had grown so quickly up the entire structures of skypark & to see these structures lit up at night was a delight. Singapore never fails to impress me with the money they spend on attractions."
,,skypark at sands,3.0,,"theirs not alot to do when you have looked around ,,they take your picture on the way up to the 56th floor but at S$50 for an 8""x10"" its expensive for what it is your exposed to the elements so hot and if it rains forget it"
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"Great views, service and infinity pool that is simply wow. Highly recommend this experience even for the breath taking views."
,,great view,3.0,,"take the tour, better than just going up to buy drinks, they are very expensive. Good view, even on a smoggy day."
,,Highly disappointing,2.0,,"Apart from the wide variety of decent pricy services you could engage, the architecture is at best mediocre and the pool is boring, unimpressive and extremely overpopulated.

The view over Singapore is perhaps the only saving grace for a highly overrated point of interest. Unless you are currently staying in the hotel (visits are complementary) it is not worth the visit."
,,Sunset at the Marina Sands,5.0,,"We didnt stay at this hotel but we did visit this magnificent structure, we planned it so that we could go to the rooftop and water the magnificent sunset of Singapore. This is a must when your visiting this wonderful city. Note - men - wear long trousers as shorts are only aloud up to a certain time if you want to have a drink in the roof top bar"
,,a good place to see the Sands,3.0,,Very hot in daytime. Better for evening visitors. Just next to shopping mall and well connected by MRT.
,,Fabulous views of Singapore up on 57th Floor!,5.0,,"The hotel has a commanding view of Singapore from the Skylark up on the 57th floor. On the other side, you can see the Super Grove Trees of Gardens by the Bay, and beyond, ships that are docked off shore. Up at the Skypark is where the infamous Infiniti Pool is. The pool is divided into sections. And there is even 1 for kids. While we were there in July, they were undergoing some renovations in the middle."
,,"Wow, as impressive as I hoped it would be.",5.0,,"Wow this is a big complex. I was staying in a suite that overlooked the park and sea. The room was large with seprerate living room, dressing room, bathroom and bedroom. Curtain electronic. Wifi worked well. A place this big can be impersonal but the guy cleaning my room kep trying. He actually made and elephant out of towels and roses which made me smile. Suite room give you access to 3 choices for breakgfast 2 on top of the hotel with great views. Breakfast was best in sky lounge. Clup room offers coctails and snacks fro 5 to 7. Staff were gracious and remember your name and drinks. Selection of food was very nice. The 3 pools on the roof are incredible, although crowded with people taking pictures there is room to swim and the views of the Bay are unbeleivable. They have 2 outdoor jacuzzis up there also.
I am a fan of Banyan Tree Spas and am a member of their organization. I was disappointed that the spa did not recognise my membership or offer me a discount for any services. Only pormotion was for a cuples massage.
Casino is attached to hotel underground and is a nice one. Only thing with that is you have to show your passport to get in and get out. ATM machines are all on th eoutside so if you need more money you have to go through the line again."
,,Favourite place for cocktails,5.0,,"We came up to the top floor for cocktails, over-looking the city, The Singapore Sling here was my favourite drink of the whole trip! We were jealous of all the people swimming in the amazing pool. It's worth the trip up, if you don't mind heights!"
,,View like no other,5.0,,This affords you a great view of Singapore. You can walk around the platform to get a 200+ degree view. Pick your day. It was a fine day for us & we could see for miles. It was very hot up there & no breeze didn't stay long but saw what we wanted to see.
,,Overpriced Observatory Deck,3.0,,"Although it has a good viewe of Singapore, it is too expensive for such observatory deck. In addition, it is pretty small. I would rather spend the money elsewhere."
,,Skip the skypark and go to the bar,4.0,,On our first day in Singapore we decided to visit Ce La Vi instead of the skypark which I think was a great idea. It cost us $4 less then the admission to the skypark and we still got the same view whilst enjoying a good drink. The views are great and its a great introduction to a fantastic city.
,,fell in love with the grandeur,5.0,,"we visited this place at night, which was not at all a mistake, its even more beautiful when lit up like that. the cool and continuous breeze kept us feeling fresh and the lights emanating from the city buildings which were giving an effect of fairy lights made the mood romantic. a must visit place for everyone. do make sure that you climb up the building and see the city and try to devour all its beauty. And do visit garden by the bay without fail."
,,Excellent scenery,5.0,,This is the place to visit perhaps just as the sun is setting then you can see the twilight the views are amazing and it's free to go upon the roof.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"I went by car with my family from Johore Bahru through the causeway to Marina Bay Sand Skypark for a day trip. It was hot and humid. The skypark is easily get into by train. Good signs of directions are all well marked. Beautifully man made park. The sky walk, the gardens and the swimming pool on top of the hotel are so unforgettable beautiful design. It will take your breath away. It will be better we stay in the hotel for one or two nights to see the the laserlights. What a beautiful country to visit. I had an enjoyable day of with my family. Plenty of refreshments ad toilet facilities around. We took the boat ride to Clark Quay. It is not expensive on the ride. A life time experience. Well done Singapore."
,,Great View!,5.0,,"We were there in July when Singapore was celebrating its Jubilee and just so happened to be in the right place at the right time.
From the top of Marina Bay Sands at the Sky Deck there were fireworks and celebrations going on on the street below.
Next thing we knew there were fighter jets, helicopters and massive planes flying right over the top of us and over the city, it was amazing and we didn't even know this was going to happen.
The view looks out over the bay and the city and even though if your not a hotel guest you only get to visit one part of the Sky Deck you still get great photos.
We went there late afternoon to catch the sun set and then the lit up city.
Was really busy but would definitely recommend if your visiting Singapore."
,,Jaw Dropping!,5.0,,We nearly missed this as we were staying at the hotel and thought we had seen the same view from the pool. We were wrong! The views from the skypark are amazing! A must go!
,,Amazing view a must see experience high up above.,4.0,,Especially in the evening when the skyline is lit up you will be impressed. You will be feeling the height going to 56th floor and once you step outside. It is an impressive design and the view from up there is both spectacular and a little scary because of the glass fence.
,,Great View,5.0,,"I went here for sightseeing only, not to stay. Its really pleasing to see the view from above. There is a casino also on the ground but I choose to enjoy the panorama. The sunset is perfect and this place also easy to be reached."
,,Don't pay!,3.0,,"it's 23$ to go up. As if MBS isn't making enough money with their casino and shopping. Go straight up to the bar, you'll have the same view and you can have a nice drink at the same time."
,,Best view of town!,5.0,,"The view from the top floor of Marina Bay Sands is absolutely stunning! I would highly recommend the hotel bar on 57th floor with equally good view instand of the sky park. Still you pay 20 S$ but at least you get a cold drink! The best time to go there is probably around 6PM (before sunset), when the lights of the city start to glow..."
,,Great city views and a very interesting illusion at the infinity pool of the hotel,4.0,,"Singapore has sprung up with incredible building on newly reclaimed land with the Gardens by the bay, the twing Durian-shaped concert hall, the Art Science Center that looks like a next, tall glass buildings with interesting shapes all over and even an area of cranes representing the ongoing building boom. One can also see container ships around showing the importance of this port city.
With relatively little water in the river, I am amazed at how much they can make of the water views over it.

There are quite some optical illusions that can be made of photos over the infinity pool built on a boat roof top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

If I can have one pet peeve, it is that there can be more signage. For example a building that looks like a giant capsule- is it a new soccer stadium?

Otherwise, definitely worth a visit."
,,bird's eye view of Singapore,4.0,,I have seen the overview of Singapore both from the Singapore eye as well as from here. I would say this is a better place. Worth every penny.
,,amazing views and food,5.0,,the restaurant and bar at the top of the skypark is very lovely amazing views of Singapore. the food in the restaurant is also gorgeous would highly recommend
,,Wonderful views across the Bay and beyond - great photo opportunity,4.0,,"Had read some slightly negative reviews about this but ignored those in favour of experiencing the views for ourselves. I don't think it was expensive for what you are getting and to be able to go up to the top of this iconic building, particularly on a clear day is value for money. There are some souvenirs at the top to buy and they carry a 10% discount from that which are available in the gift shop on the ground floor. I can understand that some people might be a little upset that they cannot get to see the affinity pool up close as a non-hotel guest but you can see something of the pool and it's clear before you ascend what you can and can't do."
,,A must do !,4.0,,"The Skypark is a must do when you come in Singapore ! You cannot have a better view and.. you HAVE to go at the top of the MBS ! The only problem ? When you are on the MBS, you don;t see it ! So it also worth going in other towers to admire this beautiful building !"
,,A must,5.0,,"Best place to watch the free light show,,,,,, fabulous views, cool and yummy juices at the top.. Worth the cost of getting to the top and make sure you get the photo"
,,luxurious stay,5.0,,"hotel exterior architecture is unique in a weird way but inside is very dominating, the high ceiling is incredible. hotel lobby is big but lack in seating, maybe they didn't really want to make people stay so that the area will be clear at all times. buffet has many choices, different dishes from all over asia i think. but expect it to be expensive even if they give 40%-50% off voucher if you checked in the hotel.

our room entrance was so grand, automatic window curtain opened as we walk in. room is clean and neat, bed is soft and bouncy. comfort room is big and very high end you would really expect it to be so expensive. room has tv but all channels or movies have payment, has free wifi but in a limited time only..you have to log in every 30mins.

the long infinity pool is really jaw dropping, water is warm and clear, you could sea singapore in an aerial view while chill'n in the pool.

overall, marina bay sands hotel is a good place to stay if you have budget and experience and luxury style accommodation."
,,Nice views,3.0,,The views from on top of the MBS are nice to see. It is a bit windy and cold in the pool but certainly a unique experience. I'd didn't like that I was staying in the hotel and had a hard time finding a place to sit with my family as it was very busy up top...
,,Must See,5.0,,I'm not usually the one who enjoys such tourist attractions but the Sands Skypark is well worth a visit if you want to get a true perspective of how this city has developed around this most spectacular harbour.
,,Awe inspiring views,5.0,,"Although a little pricey, the views of Singapore are outstanding. Breathing view of Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay and general city skyline. Night views are certainly the best."
,,Out of this world,5.0,,This place is from a futuristic film set. With the park with its metal rhubarb walkways as a back drop who could have travelled 295 years into the future. It's expensive here and really for adult children.
,,Excellent hotel and and beautiful view.,5.0,,I visited this hotel while I was staying in Swissotel in Singapore and it was spectacular the environment was breathtaking it was so grand as if I was in a Place of some sort. It had its grand shopping mall and and restaurants and the outside view was awesome. Near Maria Bay was an attraction of water fountain of Merlion and Singapore flyer.
,,Stunning veiw of Singapore City,4.0,,"Located on the top of Marina Bay Sand Hotel, from this Skypark you can enjoy glittering city in the night. But you have to pay 80 SIN dollar. There is food out let at the top, bit costly."
,,Lovely view not worth the ticket price,3.0,,"Wanted to visit Gardens by the bay for some strange reason our tour guide, Hotel staff misguided us saying it is very far and recommended Marina Bay Sands Skypark, on reaching there we realized they are next to each other!!!

Situated at 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel , the view from above is wonderful. For those planning a visit would highly recommend an post 18:00 hr visit, we made the mistake of reaching the top at 12 noon and returned with a tan!! It was too sunny to stay long, also Im sure the view from the top with Singapore all lit up would look great.
The ticket is priced SGD$23 , our hotel had a special rate of $20. Do check for price online as well.
Have rated the place average dur to the steep ticket price, maybe would have been seen as worth it if I had visited evening while the view was better, if you are short on time and need to visit during morning hours not sure if the ticket price is worth it."
,,Less than impressive,2.0,,"Unless you are a hotel guest or buy a ticket to areas not open to the general public, you have a limited area to view the harbor from. It is definitely a good view of the harbor but you have to deal with the crowds in the limited viewing area."
,,The Hype is Real!,4.0,,"stayed at the hotel for 2 nights as it was close to Chinatown and Suntec City and the other half wanted to experience the talked about infinitely pool. due to overbooking of our requested room the very nice Guest Service Agent provided us an complimentary upgrade from a Deluxe to Premium.

our room was situated on the 25th floor and can i say it was amazing, as they had rang out of King Bed rooms the house keeper was nice enough to shift both the double beds together for us, which i would like to specifically thank Chung Lin for doing something that was a hassle

the infinitely pool is amazing as hyped, don't bother going to the pool during the afternoon to night as this is possibly the peak period and you won't be able to find a seat or let alone a spot to place your belongings. my partner and i made the dedication to wake up at 7am to attend the pool which was the best decision! there was no crowds and no queue to the spa either!

we had dinner at Ce La Vi restaurant on the same floor on level 57, the service started off very well, however during the end of the night the service did decay, the food were fantastic! one again a shout out to the chefs at Ce La Vi, however the front of house service was very disappointing in the restaurant. the lack of persence is not something you want in such a grand hotel

overal the hotel was fantastic, the concierge were nice to answer all the questions to us tourist and checkout was nice and smooth.

definitely need to at least come here once in a life time!"
,,Nice Panoramic View,4.0,,"On the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, A dedicated are the have prepared in U-shape for viewing the city view. You can enjoy the views of Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, Merlion etc from the top. Overall good experience."
,,"Great views, shame about the photo pushing and drink prices.",4.0,,"We went to the skypark and as soon as we paid on the way to the lift we were asked to stop to have a photo taken. Once we reached the skypark that photo was already printed in a folder and offerred to us for just $50 which I declined, it was then reduced to $35 which again I declined. After being at the skypark for about an hour when we left we were then offered the photo again for $25 which I still declined. I don't appreciate this we printed it out so you should buy it stuff (the photo is us with the marina bay sands superimposed in the background). The skypark itself was good with great views of singapore and the harbour. However, should you feel thirsty and attend the restaurant for a drink we were slugged with $19 for a Heinenken bottle. The Skypark is worth going to, just be wearing of the tourist trap side of it."
,,Nice view,4.0,,Lucky to be there when they were practicing for the National celebration. Great view of fireworks and the Singapore night life.
,,What a view,5.0,,We got the lift to the top - it took about 5 seconds - wow - what a view from the top - just amazing
,,If you like heights and a good views then go,4.0,,"not that expensive to go up to the observation deck , I think about $20 sgd,. Fabulous view of the city and South China Sea, small take away café available. Shame they want $80 for the photo taken at the base, ridiculously expensive, would have bought mine if it had been around $20(only as it was so funny!)
Very busy in the hotel and shopping mall, I would advise catching the mrt here and not walking as I did !"
,,"Marina Bay Sands, Singapore",2.0,,Great view but nothing beyond that on offer for a visitor. An over hyped attraction. Simply avoidable.
,,Boat in the Sky,4.0,,"Having seen the boat in the sky perched on three tall buildings before, we went up and had drinks there on evening after dinner.

The views are impressive and pretty special from the 56th floor perch.

The horizon pool would be an experience to use and view the Singapore skyline."
,,Splendor in SG,5.0,,"I always bring my visitors in SG in this place, the view is remarkable, I have been here few times but each time I find the view still breathtaking."
,,OUCH,2.0,,Visited the hotel. Went to check out the skylark and just about fainted when I saw how much it would be to go up to look. OUCH. Save your money this is a pool at the top of a hotel after all with plants. The building is amazing but I'd stick to the gardens by the bay for fab views.
,,SG,5.0,,"Places to visit in Singapore are reallly nice, except that you really need to do a lot of walking so make sure to wear comfy shoes or ride the taxi if you have lots of money."
,,Nice view and pool,5.0,,I stayed at the hotel for a weekend and went to the pool on the sky park which is top of the hotel. Approximately 57 floor if I am not wrong. It's a lap pool where at the edge you can view the beautiful skyline of Singapore. Usually crowded therefore you don't get to swim and rather be soaking inside the water. There are few nice restaurants there.
,,One of the most amaing things ever done in my life!!!,5.0,,Honestly all the hotel package was one of the most amazing things in my life!!! Sky park pool restaurant and bar and chocolate bar everything everything was amazing!!! Its a must place to visit in Singapore
,,This was a one off visit for us but absolutely delighted we stayed at Marina Bay Sands...its a must do if you can..,5.0,,"We stayed here in February 2015 for one night before our cruise. We werent disappointed. Very quick and easy check in, Rooms amazing, we were on 50th floor with a view over the city which was breathtaking. We went up to inifinity pool on the sky park on top of the towers and it was spectacular. The food and drinks were nice but a bit pricy. The shops were outstanding and very exclusive. You need to go up to the sky park at an evening time to watch the laser light show and stand and look over the city's spectacular views."
,,Read and make up your own mind,3.0,,"Cost 23SGD per adult, a little less for children. We queued to pay, queued to go up in the lift (57 or so floors but quick lift). You cannot access most of the roof as it is (probably rightly) reserved for hotel guests who can use its roof garden and infinity pool. The rest of us are restricted to a curving deck at one end which has an upper floor to access the restaurant. There are no seats so you have to sit on the floor or a step so any infirmity requires a wheelchair. We went up to view the fireworks rehearsals but could not find any space on the edge to view. On the plus side you do get fantastic views of Singapore city on one side and the ""Gardens by the Bay"" on the other. Best to go late in the day and stay until city lights up at night. Yes it's expensive and not really very customer orientated particularly if you need to sit down, but what the heck, you come to Singapore how often??? Avoid if you don't like to be treated like cattle and also pay handsomely for the privilege. Do this as a one off for possible the best high rise night views of Singapore - if only just the once. On our visit we noticed the queue to go back down went fully around the skydeck, possibly 150 metres and with only 3 public use lifts, I will let you guess the time it takes to go back down. We chose to go to the restaurant and had to be let through by security. Once through the restaurant deemed my 3/4 combat shorts unsuitable. Fearing the massive queue to the 3 lifts we, ermm... took a right turn instead of returning through the security barrier and found the same three lifts at the top floor and were then assisted along a short corridor into the hotel area where we gained access immediately to the six lifts there."
,,Well worth the money to the 56th floor,5.0,,"Standing on the overhang, one gets the most fabulous views over the city and especially the bay. This is one place that should be top of your ""must sees"" in Singapore."
,,The best of panoramic views of the island (when not hazy).,4.0,,"For some of the best views in town, this is a 'must'. Enjoy a meal or G&T as the sun sets. If necessary, ask at the Information Counter how to visit the sky deck free of charge.

Choose a day when there is no haze, if possible."
,,The deck gives you a beautiful panoramic view of Singapore and Malaysia.,4.0,,"Interesting complex: hotels, casino, high end stores and restaurants. There was a wonderful dim sum restaurant with the most delicious food, and considering the ""high end"" aspects to the Marina Sands, it was quite reasonable. The deck is spectacular!"
,,Great view,4.0,,Great to get amazing view of singapore. Loved the lights at night has great bar at top to relax and take in the sights. Little disappointed at how long it took to get elevator done though. Could be because of Saturday night
,,worth seeing if in singapore,4.0,,"wonderful place though pricey, great atmosphere, nice view expect queue to go up but pretty efficiently managed."
,,Just went for drinks,3.0,,"I went there with a couple of friends and decided to buy drinks, little did I know how expensive it was going to be. ($20 a beer)
The view is breath taking; and I wish I had the foresight to bring my swim trunks. The pool looked so inviting.
Three guys, 2 beers each and one appetizer.........about $200."
,,wow place,5.0,,"very wow place, fountain show world class, very nice, near garden by bay, enjoy place very much, i want come back nest year"
,,Worth a look,4.0,,"The trip up to the 56th floor was part of our Singapore night tour. It took just 30 seconds to reach this level and the view is wide ranging and the lights at night make even more spectacular, if you don't mind heights it's a must do, it's cheaper with a tour group."
,,More of an eye-wash,2.0,,"You are not allowed to visit the top floor where you have swimming pool, garden etc.

The real thing is over there and one is allowed to visit the lower floor and see Singapore from there.

We felt disappointed and rather, cheated as we were conveyed that we will not be able to use the swimming pool.

No fun of spending that much for tickets."
,,Great views,5.0,,It's a spot not to be missed. You will get some of the best vantage points of Singapore from on top. If you are a guest at the hotel you can enjoy those same views from the comfort of a hot tub!
,,A must see,4.0,,"Definitely worth visiting, just purely for the architecture and the views are magnificent on a clear day."
,,Very hot with no shade,3.0,,There is a great view of the city and harbour from here but the $20 ticket price is a bit expensive. There is no access to the horizon pool or hotel.
,,Excellent Views,4.0,,Very good views of Singapore and a cheap extra to add to your holiday. Easy to get to from the MRT station.
,,Piece of Art,5.0,,"Like the title says, this building is a piece of architecture and engineering art and genius. If you visits Singapore and don't go to the Skypark, I don't even know why you bothered visiting Sinagpore anyway. Wonderful view from above there and relaxing experience"
,,Loved it and there's a nice restaurant on the top!,5.0,,"The view of the Singapore's CBD and the view of the MBS infinity pool is amazing from the SkyPark! Here's a very useful tip from me. When we first visited the SkyPark, we bought those tickets from the ticketing booth, went up, took pictures and realised that there was a restaurant there, previously known as Ku De Ta. We paid almost $100 to go up to the SkyPark and we decided to eat something at the restaurant, the bill came up to $100. We realised that you can actually come up to the resultant without having to play for the SkyPark ticket fees, then have a drink and some small afternoon bites, enjoy the view, and save that entrance fee! I'm not sure if this works now cause they have changed the name of the restaurant, but no harm trying as you can have a meal, see the view and also save your money on the SkyPark tickets. We are a huge fan of the restaurant at the SkyPark and regularly go there to eat!"
,,MARINA SNADS SKYPARK,5.0,,"MBS Skypark is located at level 5ow6 of Marina Bay Sands Hotel's Tower 1. The view of entire Business District, Gardens by the Bay and Singapore harbor is very nice. You get to see glimpse of Infinity Pool as well which is accessible only for hotel guests."
,,beautiful place,5.0,,This is a very beautiful and safe place for families. You will love the lights and music at night. this is one place you should not miss when you visit Singapore
,,Fantastic View of Singapore !!!,5.0,,Brilliant trip up to the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Amazing view high up. We went at night was less busy n nice n cool. You can purchase a great momento photo when u leave. A must-do !!!
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"We went to see the gardens, decided to check out the hotel. Paid $20 to gp upstairs to lookout. When we were buying our ticket the lady asked did we fly Singapore airlines we said yes, do you have your boarding pass with you? No, shame you can get 15% discount off the entry fee if you did. No this is a big secret!!!!! Who ever carries there boarding pass around with them when doing the touristy thing? As retirees we would have appreciated the discount. Needs to be advertised more.
However we stayed hours for the fireworks. Enjoyed a hot dog while there"
,,"Best views of the city, the must do of Singapore",5.0,,We were not staying in the hotel but went for a visit and had some cocktails at the bar. Just walk into the hotel and take the lift to the top floor - it's free. The views were amazing and the cocktails were great. It's very cool as you get a view of the whole Singapore from a different perspective than normally. Definitely worth a visit!
,,Marina bay sands; Perfect point to see all of Singapore from one place,5.0,,"Unforgettable and epic views of the whole of Singapore. Needs at 28 SGD ticket. Don't forget to carry cameras. You ccan also have drinks and coffee at the sky park and also purchase souvenirs. There is also the worlds largest swimming pool of 155 mtrs at the sky park but its only for the hotel guests. Recommend time to visit is 1600 to 1700 hrs Singapore time, so that you an view the beautiful transition from daylight to night of Singapore city. Must visit......your Singapore visit is incomplete without this attraction."
,,Visit to Marina Bay sands skypark,5.0,,"Epic view of the whole of Singapore city. A visit to Singapore is incomplete if You haven't seen sky park. Costs u a ticket of 28 SGD, an elevator takes you to the sky park level. Don't forget cameras so you can capture the unforgettable pictures as the Singapore city goes through the transition from daylight to the night. There is also the worlds longest swimming pool, 155 mtrs next to the sky park (for hotel guests only). You can also enjoy a couple of drinks/ coffee or buy some souvenirs up there. Suggested stay 1600 to 2000 hrs local time."
,,Best views in Singapore,5.0,,"We were guests at the hotel so made sure we visisted the Skypark. Pool was amazing to swim in and the views on offer whilst in the pool just topped off the experience.

We also paid the shops on this level a visit and got some good souvenirs. The views over Singapore from the deck at this end of the Skypark were also amazing."
,,Incredible sights,5.0,,Amazing place! Worth the trip to Singapore just to visit here! Incredible views of Singapore! Will be back one day soon!
,,Breathtaking Views You'll Never Forget!,5.0,,"This is one of the most breathtaking experiences imaginable. The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a terrace atop three 55-storey Marina Bay Sands hotel towers. There are nightclubs, rooftop restaurants, a public observatory deck, lush trees and other foliage as well as the world's longest elevated swimming pool (with a vanishing/infinity edge) that's nearly 500 ft long. The 360 degree views of Singapore and beyond will take your breath away."
,,Great view but pay the price!,4.0,,"Got the whisper that if you go up to have a drink it's better value than going up simply to look! We were quizzed at the lift about our intentions, either way it's not cheap!! We went for a drink at the roof top bars hitch turned out to be only slightly more expensive than a look! Beers cost $16 plus tax each! That was the cheapest drink! Drinking area lacked air conditioning which stunned us. Service good though we did hear one complaint about a lack of it to management. View is sensational though some in Singapore say another roof top bar is better! Certainly a really interesting place!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"Singapore SKYScrapper with a swimming pool at the top is a must watch destination for all tourist. The top view almost covers whole of singapore - You will enjoy it for sure.. My suggestion is visit the place between 4p.m to 7 p.m so that you can see the beauty of singapore under sunlight as well as artificial lights in the evening. Avoid visiting the place in hot sun, for sure you wont enjoy it in hot weather hence"
,,Singapore's best view!,4.0,,"Sands skypark observation deck offers the best view of Singapore. How ever only hotel guests are allowed to use the infinity pool which is the world's largest outdoor pool at such a high place.
We had to wait for sometime till the crowds dwindle due to the limit on the number of people allowed in. There are shops as well as restaurants and bar.
Since it rained a bit heavily within 25 minutes after we entered, it was closed temporarily. But we were allowed refund as they don't provide umbrellas."
,,Great view of CBD and Singapore,4.0,,"This is a great place to visit and at a reasonable charge. The views are very good. A must see if you are visiting Singapore. Go in the evening to catch daylight views as well as night views. The transition from day to night is very good.

The laser show is a very popular attraction and it is believed that the laser show can be seen from the Skypark. However, I have seen the laser show from the Merlion and it is much better. The laser show from the Skypark is no where as good. I had visitors and they were disappointed with the laser show view from the Skypark. I advise you not to waste time and go down to the Merlion to catch the laser show."
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,This is a must see. No need to buy a ticket to visit. It's best to visit Skypark and purchase a cocktail. It's worth it! The view is amazing.
,,Value is questionable,3.0,,"A seeming must-do, but the value equation does not stack up, especially if its multiple people going up. I did it once and was disappointed, plus the extra heat up there in an always hot Singapore limits the amount of time you can expect to spend up there anyway."
,,Cocktails with a View,4.0,,"Don't pay for the admission to go up to the viewing platform, but instead head to the cocktail bar and spend what you would have paid for the admission on a great cocktail or two.
They have a DJ that mixes music all day and night which sets the right atmostphere any time of day. Its not to loud that you can't hear what your parnter is saying. Great big lounges that have the most stunning views over the bay and city. Would be spectacular at night, but just as spectacular during the day.
We enjoyed a couple of cocktails and snacks from there bar menu in the afternoon.
Was a lovely way to spend a couple of hours."
,,A view like no other...,5.0,,"You normally get great views from tall buildings and observatories. But the NUMBER and beauty of unique sights from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is extraordinary. The Gardens by the Bay (The Cloud Forest, The SuperTree Grove, the Flower Dome), the soccer field built on the water, the marina, the Singapore skyline, the Singapore flyer, Sentosa island, etc... A fair price for a priceless experience..."
,,To infinity and beyond,5.0,,All I have to say is that their infinity pool atop the marvelous three tower luxurious hotel is the one thing you need to do to complete your Singapore experience. It offers a magnificent 360 view of the city. What an amazing spot!
,,Great Views of Singapore Skyline,4.0,,"We were staying in the hotel and access to the Sands Skypark was free for guest. It is indeed a great view from the top of the hotel. You can take photos of the garden/bay view and the city view. I think if you pay it is pricey for what you can get. The observation deck are only limited to a small area plus in the daytime, weather can be terribly hot & humid. In my opinion if you are paying for the entrance fee it is better value to purchase the airconed Singapore Flyer and you will get the same great views."
,,beautiful evening,4.0,,it was a wonderful walk all over the place....We went to the shopping area....and sat down in front of the bay area
,,Views amazing but expensive - little trick ;),3.0,,"The Skypark offers stunning views of Singapore which just have to be seen. However, its pretty expensive.

Depending on the make up of your group, you could instead take the lift one stage higher and enjoy a leisurely glass of wine or beer (or juice) in the bar. The views are just as good and there's more space to walk around and see different views (from tankers to over Singapore) and it's free to enter - although the drinks are expensive it'll work out close to the same price as the Skypark. A no brainer! ;)

Handy hints:
-- it's quite breathing to watch the sun setting over the Singapore reservoir (especially if you're already enjoyed the hippo tour around the reservoir first as you'll recognise things from on high)
-- if you're in the bar rather than the sky park itself, there's an evening dress code for men so chexk first!"
,,good view!,4.0,,"A strong wind was blowing, but I could see very fantastic scenery from the place. I could look the central of Singapore!"
,,Just beautiful.,5.0,,Wonderful view over the city. We went a bit before sunset (18.30). After going up to the 56th floor you can stay there for an unlimited time. So we stayed to well after dark to make some great pictures of the skyline from Singapore. We did the Singapore Flyer earlier on the day and this was definitely still worth the money. Recommendation is going a bit before sunset.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Well worth a visit - views are amazing. Went first thing in the morning and no queues to be had. Able to spend as much or as little time as wanted.
,,Party with a view to die for.........,5.0,,"Our end of event (wrap) party was held here on one of the private roof terrace called the Ironing Board? The party was great (thanks PUMA) but the views simply overshadowed the food, drink and DJ. An absolute must for any traveler in the area."
,,"Gorgeous view, but too expensuve",3.0,,"We paid the $ 29 to enter the observation deck, but realized afterwards that the there is a public restaurant as well as a club in the level above it. Nevertheless the view was super!"
,,Have to visit!,5.0,,"If you visit singapore you have to visit the sky park, the views are stunning and you get to read a lot of about the history of singapore. Avoid going midday as its very hot up there but windy!"
,,very nice view,5.0,,"we went there and we were able to view the whole of singapore, it was a nice view specially night time were you can see all the lights on, since we were staying in another hotel we paid 20sgd but i may say that it was worth it! hope to be back here and hopefully check-in in thier hotel as well"
,,Epitome of Singapore!,5.0,,"Excellent infinity pool! Very much worth the experience of high class living! The staff are very accommodating and the view is extremely beautiful- enjoyed gardens by the bay, and the light show!"
,,Great view,5.0,,A very nice place. SkyPark at Marina Bay hotel and to stay sandys was very nice. Surely you have time .
,,Marina bay!,2.0,,"Great view, but expensive, $23 Sinpapore, the entrance fee gives access to a very small section of the top floor.
There is no access to the infinity pool for this entrance fee, and if you wish to have a meal, be prepared to pay a hefty price, it is not really family friendly or for those on a limited budget. I honestly think you can get a good view of Singapore from the Gardens in the Bay's skywalk, it's not as high but the view is excellent and worth the cheaper entrance price."
,,Must Visit,4.0,,Marina bay sands a.k.a the ship building is one of the first things that pops up in ur head when it comes to Singapore. I would surely visit again.
,,"Awesome view, best in the world!",5.0,,"Awesome view, great food, good beers, but expensive! You get what you pay for. Get up here and see the sunset and take some pictures. It's worth it."
,,Top of the skypark in Asia,5.0,,"When we reach the skypark we can see all ....singapore city, changi airport , harbour , till batam island in Indonesia. Dream on ....pray for...make a wish.... all your dreams come through..."
,,Leisure,3.0,,A little disappointing as restaurant was closed and only a small area you can access. It was drizzling so the views were not that great. Probably different if the restaurant was open and a clear day
,,Superb Triple-A Rating,5.0,,"Marina Sands was a nicest place to visit during my Singapore stay. A great Mall with all brands and a UNBELIEVABLE beautiful Casino and very good food court. One can spend a full day at Marina Sands , it is incomparable and a beautiful place to visit. A MUST visit place."
,,Drinks in the clouds,4.0,,Take the elevator up to the bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands and see the view. Drinks are expensive but enjoy and soak up the atmosphere and the view. Fantastic.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"so its really painful to have to pay $20+ to visit the visitation deck. there are plenty of tall buildings in singapore and one can go to the rooftop of any restaurants for a good night view eg top of raffles city, oue, china club etc. Even for this observation deck, one can probably get to see it if you choos to eat at the restaurant at the top of MBS - albeit at an inflated price. 

Having said that it is a wonderful view and this is view is from a different vantage point then all the buildings in the city so if you are willing to pay, it is worth the experience. "
,,Great View,5.0,,"You get a great view if Singapore from the Skypark.

While not cheap, be sure to look for discount ticket options online to save a few dollars.

It's definitely worth doing at least once when you visit.

We went during mid-morning and it was already hot up so high, so can recommend take a hat, sunscreen and even an umbrella and drink.

Perfect spot to take photos with a good quality camera of some of the tourist hot spots such as the Gardens By a The Bay and City."
,,Another high for Singapore,5.0,,It seems on this trip I did all the high things Singapore has to offer. The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is nearly or is maybe higher than the Singapore Flyer and is also well worth the visit. It is very hot up there however so its maybe a late afternoon visit rather than middle of the day. The access up and down was very easy and the souvenirs a reasonable price.
,,Misleading,1.0,,"Read online that we could use the pool, got there only to pay $23 per person and find out that the pool is for residents only! Exceptionally disappointed, especially considering the 'skypark' is nothing more than a deck with a gift shop - binoculars have to be rented at a cost of $10 where at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai they are situated on deck for free. Green screen photo costs $90 also.Very disappointed."
,,"The Architecture and Views from the Pool, outstanding",5.0,,"If in Singapore a night in this spectacular hotel is recommended, sip a cocktail at the pool, enjoy the views at night from the rooftop bar, spectacular. You feel like on top of the world"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The 1st time we've seen it was during river cruise (too expensive for a family 80$).but the scene was something different, never thought it's real building when I saw it on google but there in front of us, defiant the traditional architecture. The laser show was another treat, jam on top."
,,Marina Bay sands Skypark,3.0,,"Fantastic piece of architecture, The view was spectacular night photos are great. Very busy. Worth visiting"
,,do it once,3.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark has a good view 360 of Singapore. Also a nice place to watch the sun set over Singapore skyline while swimming in their pool.
,,A beautiful spot to enjoy Singapore's skyline,5.0,,Singapore is a must see for people who enjoy architecture. You wont be dissapointed. The city prides itself in city planning and they have done a great job with green space along with their unique to Singapore buildings
,,Amazing View,4.0,,A little expensive but the views are stunning. You are sectioned off at one end of the skypark as two thirds is kept just for guests. You will get amazing photos on a great day.
,,Great View,5.0,,"Great view in the evening, we were lucky enough to have a slight breeze so it wasn't to hot. The bar prices are a little high but you are in Singapore on the top of a great hotel"
,,A must see structural feat,3.0,,"This structure is obscene but an amazing structural feat consisting of around 2000rooms with wall to wall people trying to dive/swim/selfie photos into this seemingly tiny width pool on top of the Marina Bay Sands and people sitting within 6inches of your lounge chair trying to either drink, sunbake or read. The foyer consists of 3 towers, no seating at all in the foyer and surrounding shopping precinct, other than outside."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"The Skypark offer a nice view over Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Bay as expected...and thats it."
,,Great Photos of Singapore,4.0,,Fantastic views of Singapore and great photo opportunities however it is very exposed to the hot sun with very little shade available. Would be great around sunset.
,,Disapointing,3.0,,View is nice but not worth the money. To be avoided. You'd better go to the night safari for instance.
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,You should be here once in your life. Amazing and mind blowing view on top of the hotel from the swimming pool. A nice Singapore Slingh in your hand makes ik complete...!
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,"because i wasn't stay at marina, i paid ticket to go up. as a wedding photographer, i suggest to go up at 6pm, so can prepare to take a photo. don't bring your tripod. not allowed"
,,Top of Singapore,5.0,,"Top of Singapore, you can see almost all of Singapore from the TOP. A beautiful place to relax and view the skyline."
,,"It's got to be done, sadly!",3.0,,It's a rip off. Lets be honest but the views from the top are amazing. Great to watch the sunset with a glass ($25 approx) in your hand.
,,Why pay?,2.0,,When you can go one floor down to Ce La Vie Bar and see exactly the same views..i simply don't get it!
,,Definitely a bucket list must do,5.0,,"There are some spectacular must do things in the world and this is one of them. If you simply can't afford a night in this magnificent hotel, then the fact that you can access this amazing architectural masterpiece as a member of the public is simply unbelievable.

Pay the $23 and get your self up to this spectacular pool with one of the greatest views in the world. Sure beats a Singapore sling at the Raffles for $32. Spend the whole day and evening in the paradise complete with hot jacuzzi and sun beds plus complimentary towel use.

Mad if you don't......"
,,Skypark,5.0,,"Another brilliant man made attraction,the views around the Gardens are exquisite.Very well organised.one ticket gets you into three attractions."
,,A bit of a let down,3.0,,The hotel is huge and the lift is very fast. Once at the top I couldn't find any seating everyone was sitting on the ground. It is a great place to watch the sunset.
,,World's Best Infinity Pool - marred by China Guests (50 of them) who dived in FULLY CLOTHED,5.0,,"The infinity pool was overcrowded with a lot of China guests. We saw 50 of them (from China) diving in to the pool fully clothed! Even old aunties from China dived in fully clothed with SHOES and cardigans! Male China guests were seen swimming in the pool FULLY CLOTHED and wearing their track jackets and SHOES!! Lifeguards tried their best to fish them out of the pool but the moment lifeguards turn their heads, these errant China hotel guests dived into the pool again! Please put up HUGE signboards iN Chinese warning guests not to swim fully cloth. We (myself and the other American/European/Australian hotel guests) were all appealed and shocked. This went on throughout the afternoon and night. The lifeguards were just outnumbered by hotel guests at the pool on the weekend of 11 July 2015. It was just horrible to see.

A beautiful and classy hotel with the world's best infinity pool marred by these China hotel guests who have NO REGARD for etiquette and manners.

Have I mentioned that they were RUDE too? Some guests told these China guests not to dive in with clothes on. Needless to add, the CHINA guests scolded the other hotel guests and told them to basically - mind their own business. Can the hotel do something?? Urgently please?"
,,Amazing staff !!!!',5.0,,"During my stay in marina bay from july 13-14,2015 room 3016, i didn't swim that much on the pool deck I'm just sitting while observing how the staff here manage this amount of crowd and the amount of heat every single day.. There are some staff whom caught my attention,, i would like to commend dennis during night shift July 13,2015 , while i was having a dip, he seems very accommodating and very friendly, while evrybdy seems so busy taking photo i just notice how hard working he is and how he keep on smiling during his busy day at work and so much noise from the crowd! He said he came from Philippines. He showed to me his skin color while we are talking about his job and how wonderful marina bay is. I wont missed his name..

The next day, my last day early morning swim... I did the same thing, at this time it was very very HOT!! I notice that some staff are wearing shades already and can see their face is reddish. I called this staff name Grace, to order my drink, and same thing happened, she is very friendly, courteous and polite, she is really promoting marina bay, and how nice the company is .. I told her marina bay should pay them well as they are earning much, so again i talked alot of things , and she even introduce me to her supervisor named Maricon? Yeah mariton or maricon? Something like that.. We all chit chat as if we are long lost friends.. One thing ive notice with this two lovely ladies, they are also both filipinos? How can it be possible? How can i have a great service from 3different staff but it so funny that they all came from a same country?! ☺️ this makes me think that majority of filipinos are really very nice, hard working and friendly. I think they deserve some reward from the company! I appreciate this kind of service that the staff give, those nice room views, infinity pool os nothing without this kind of staff that makes a lot of different! Kudos to those 3 staff that ive mention. Surely will recommend marina bay to mu friends not only because of the amazing hotel facility but the excellent and quality service from the staff!!!

Cheers!!
Sachiko"
,,walking in sky,5.0,,Elevator which took us on top within seconds and Free entry to casino for tourists. Day tour would have been better. It was quite dark
,,POOR QUALITY IN HIGH PLACE AT HIGH PRICE,2.0,,"Visited MBS SKYPARK with family of six on 1st july.
The negatives or cons are
1. High price of the tickets.
2. High price of pics taken by them.
55 sgd for single pic.
3. No shades or sitting arrangements.
Not even an umbrella or bench or tool."
,,"So packed, feels like in China!",1.0,,"Spectacular view but the pool is so packed, and there isn't much space to walk. I think for a hotel this size, the pool is way too small!"
,,Not for people with a fear of heights,4.0,,S$23 to get to the top of the Sand Skypark Observation deck is probably worth it. Terrific views of the commercial areas and the Marina bay area. It gives you a sense of the city and is an iconic symbol of Singapore so I enjoyed it. I went by myself. I don't think paying a lot for a large family would be worth it however.
,,"Spectacular Birds Eye viewing of Singaporce, Day or Night.",5.0,,"Befor leaving Newzealand, my friends strongly sugested a visit to the Marina Sands Park. WOW! what an experience. A few years had elapsed since my last visit to Singapore and expected changes. However, the site of the three towers, with what, from a distance looked like a massive boat linking the three buildings together, was SPECTACULAR! And so it was! The vast shopping mall at the bottom was filled with the worlds best, from cars to the exotic clothes renowned throughout the World.
Then, to top it all, Is the ride to the BOAT! (loacal's apparently don't like the Spectacular roof-top being like a boat - but it does.The views of the harbour, city and the Gardens below are breathtaking. There is also an eclectic choicce for Dining.
Definitely a MUST VISIT."
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,We love the Marina Bay Sands Skypark... it was so amazing. The staffs are approachable. Totally superb for this experience.
,,Must eat there,5.0,,The food was fantastic. Views beyound description. The price was high but justified. You pay fro the luxury and the views.
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"After being in Singapore for the second time, I would definitely still rate this view as one of the best skyline view in Asia. With almost a 360 view of the city and observation deck, you are allowed to walk around and soak in the beautiful city air. This place is definitely worth a visit to see the beautiful city view. I would definitely recommend coming right before sunset so you can see the contrast of the 2 beautiful views."
,,Swimming at the top of the world!,5.0,,I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands during the Lunar New Year. The hotel was far beyond what I anticipated. I truly enjoyed my stay. Especially having to swim at the top. What a well designed building. I will definitely return for my honeymoon :o)
,,Incredible view,5.0,,We happened to be fortunate enough to witness the 50th anniversary of SG from the sky deck . Spectacular!
,,Amazing,5.0,,Amazing hotel ... Visited for drinks at the top of the hotel which was the best view of the city great views across the city and inside the bar and across the infinity pool cocktails were great and would defiantly recommend when in Singapore :-)
,,Splendid example of moder afchitecture,5.0,,"I've never imagined it could be. Ultra modern architecture. Just try to imagine a group of 3 high-rise buildings, joined at the top (roof) by a large swimming pool that spans all three buildings"
,,"Brilliant view from the top, but expensive for the experience!",3.0,,"I brought a group of 9 friends here for sightseeing. It was a great view, ticket prices were S$23 per person, unless you have a group of 8 with someone who has an SQ ticket, then the price of each ticket is S$20.

Great views of Singapore from the top, even though it was drizzling. We could only walk roughly 30% of the deck, as the rest (infinity pool) of it was reserved for guests of the hotel. No places to sit, and the prices for drinks in the restaurant were exorbitant, so we preferred to go elsewhere for drinks.

Overall, a sightseeing opportunity, but poor value for money as we finished the walk in 30 mins, which makes the cost >S$1/min!"
,,Great view with best drink,5.0,,Absolutely a place you should visit. You will enjoy the spectacular view of Singapore along with great drinks prepared by professional bartenders
,,Good view,4.0,,A place where you can see the whole city. Night time is the best timing to visit the city lights. *Thumbs Up*
,,Cracking View,4.0,,"As part of our stay we used the skypark, great way to spend an afternoon chilling by the pool with a good book, beer and a great view, certainly worth a visit."
,,Great service,5.0,,Staff all helpful. Great views. Well worth the trip to the Skypark. Spend as much time as you want looking around.
,,The most and the latest landmark of Singapore .,5.0,,The view from the top is breath taking . There is a fee for going up for the view . There are fine dining option avalable for the people more deep pockets - for the memorable events it is a good choice . Advance reservations to these places are advised .
,,The pool is magnificent,5.0,,"The infinity pool was the main reason we booked into the Marina Bay Sands, however there are so many more reasons to stay! The view, shopping, food, services and rooms were all to a very high standard. A must stay when you visit Singapore"
,,Not worth it,2.0,,"Just going on the observation deck is not worth it; the glass is really high so it's hard to properly enjoy the view. There are no seats as you are clearly expected to just walk in and out. It's a very expensive ride to the top, and they even harass you to buy a picture which is taken in front of a screen so it's not even a real background. If you dine at the restaurant the ride up is free, but be aware that they have a dress code."
,,A great view with very expensive beer.,4.0,,"We met another Scottish couple (first time visitors to Singapore) and took them to see Singapore from the Skypark. They were very impressed all the sights we pointed out to them and the general view including the Indonesian islands and Malaysia, easily visible on the clear day we had. Because it was a very hot day we had a Tiger beer whist there. They were very overpriced !!!"
,,Rip off?,3.0,,"A lot of money for a small thrill, unless you really want to say you've done it, give it a miss and take the wheel."
,,"Not a Must Do, But Worth a Visit!",4.0,,"For $23 SGD, you can take an elevator up to the 56th floor to get a stunning view of Singapore. However, please note that you do not get access to the full length of the top deck, it is a only about 2/5 of the entire top level that is open for observation. The rest of it, including the infinity pool is restricted to the in-house guests of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. I personally believe the Singapore Flyer gives better value for money, but this gives the better view. The photos attached would clearly show how stunning the views from this level are of the city. Also important to note is that to access it you must go to Tower 3. If you’re in the area and you want to feel like you’re at the top of the world, this is the place to be."
,,absolutely magnificent and brilliant...there are no dislikes..,1.0,,must get in early to purchase your tickets and avoid crowds especially over the weekend and school holidays but then this is common sense where ever you go but to singapore one must go especially with family
,,Impressive view,4.0,,A great view over Singapore harbour and the central city area. The three tower structure is a hotel an casino but the observation deck is open to the public. The ticket counter and entrance is a little hard to find but the concierge was very helpful. The $23 entrance fee is somewhat steep and the price of food and beverages at the top is above that of most five star hotels around the world. A glass of orange juice was around $12. Never the less a good place to relax after visiting the gardens below.
,,Sky Sand in the City,5.0,,"A romantic place to be at , during early dinner until late night. You can even unwind, chill and enjoy the ambiance with friends or love ones."
,,A MUST,5.0,,If you do not want to pay to go up top for the sky view its worth visiting this building and walking the bridge that joins the building to Gardens by the Bay specially during the evening.
,,20% off entrance to Sands Sky Park (Observatory Deck) on the 56th floor,4.0,,"20% off entrance to Sands Sky Park (Observatory Deck) on the 56th floor. New members to Sands' ""Lifestyle"" membership get some perks, discounts and freebies like umbrella and skating rink access. Limited time offer only. Check their website."
,,great views at sunset,4.0,,"well, the title says it all. There is a bar up there as well but no idea about the prices, or if you need to book etc."
,,Just do it! You won't regret the fee.....,5.0,,"High up on this most beautiful of Singapore's (and the world's) buildings, you feel like you can see forever. Yes, there's a fee to get up there: but the perspective it gives you on the world, is phenomenal. Plus, you'll be standing on a multi-storey sculpture - the building is exquisite, inside and out.

Once you descend from the top, take the time to walk across the elevated walkway to Singapore's amazing botanic gardens 'out the back' - and you can do two of the most wonderful attractions in Singapore at the same time! Just do it!"
,,A great view of the city,4.0,,"I supposed you are expected to get ripped off and the cocktails are expensive,but the views were spectacular and provided a new perspective of Singapore at night for us."
,,WAW,5.0,,"Stunning hotel, with a beautiful shopping centre underneath, a bit like Venice, :-) I don't think I've ever been in a shopping mall with a river flowing through it and men on gondolas :-) What an experience. We headed straight to the top of the ""boat"" to see the incredible view across Singapore, fortunately, we got there in the light and left in the dark. It is DEFINITELY worth a visit, and we would love to go back and stay at the hotel, just in order to experience the rooftop infinity pool :-)"
,,Good experience - Must visit,4.0,,"We visit marina bay sands Skypark. It was good experience. It was worth spending time at the park due to its unique style of pool Although you cannot access pool if you are not staying their , but they have created like observation desk. You need to buy ticket for the same."
,,worth every cent,5.0,,best place to enjoy the sunset and see singapore's beautiful skyline at night. get a great view of the whole city.
,,Exotic,5.0,,"Week end, think of Skypark. Where you will energise for the forthcoming week. Dance,Talk,Drink,Eat, right place."
,,Overpriced,2.0,,We were so disappointed after paying almost $70 to get tickets were sent up to bare very hot observation deck. No benches or shade. Very expensive 5 minutes
,,You will be at the TOP..!!,4.0,,"Though there are few more buildings taller than this in Singapore, this one makes you stand at open space (roof top) .. Worth of the money..!! I am sure you will love when you dip yourself in swimming pool over there,jus get into it wit a drink,or jus lie down there,amazing experience.Note,the pool is open only for the hotel guests"
,,Great experience,5.0,,"Best location with great view to the city and the bay. The Infinity pool is one of the best swimming pools should be try at least one in life. Drinks are a bit expensive but they are acceptable there.
After swiming, lying down on a bench and enjoy a cocktail and the great view from it is amazing experience you should never forget."
,,A Singapore trip without visiting the Skypark will be incomplete,5.0,,"The skypark is free if you are a staying guest in Marina Bay Sands but you can purchase tickets if you just want to walk in and take a peek at the spectacular view on the 57th floor of the hotel. Experience getting a dip in an infinity pool nestled on top of an iconic building. It gets crowded during the day so if you want a good spot go there early in the morning, it opens as early as 6AM."
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"Standing on the deck of a ship on top of a hotel/casino complex, overlooking most of Singapore... pretty neat concept. Not cheap especially for a family, but worth considering regardless. I'd recommend actually going up to the Skybar at C'est La Vie (if you have a reservation to the restaurants on the Skydeck, the elevator is free, having a drink and taking some time to contemplate life and the views."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,Loved this. The Skypark is visually stunning and well worth a visit; like something out of a James Bond film.
,,Not worth money,2.0,,"I don't understand, why queue and pay for this view, while you are able to go for free to even one level up to Ce La Vi bar and restaurant and enjoy dining and cocktails and view. Platform was also quite crowded"
,,Visiting the Skypark,4.0,,We have been to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark many times ever since it first opened. Each time we have visitors we take them along to see the magnificent views. It is best viewed on Sunset because you see it during the day and then in all its glory in the evening. Watching all the lights turn on all around the bay is a view I never get sick of seeing. Well worth the visit.
,,EXTRAORDINARY VIEWS AWAIT YOUR VISIT TO THE TOP OF THE TRIPLE TOWERS!,5.0,,"There are other things to do but just going tight to the top of the building will have you gasping at the incredible views singapore which are the best you can experience! The lift is so huge and comfortable you can""t even feel any movement so no nerves here going up so high! Get clear views of the infinity pool (you don""t even have to swim) and marvel about the technology that spans across the top of the fifty plus hotel floors of the triple towers>"
,,"Go to the top, AMAZING",4.0,,"The view is amazing but you need to get up early, as it fills quickly, but once the sun goes down and the lights of the city are turned on, that is the best. Both side of the viewing deck offer different views, one over the city and the other over the gardens, beautifully alight, so magical."
,,A Must See,5.0,,If you only ever go to Singapore then make it a visit to the Skypark. The views are to die for and a swim in the infinity pool will place you on top of the world. Loved it.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Amazing views go early as you can it's HOT up the top or a night would be amazing to see the city lights a little expensive for families around $100 for 4 there's no seats up top but lots of photo's to be taken.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"A must visit to this spectacular iconic amazing hotel. Been to MBS few times with friends and partner. Kudeta it was called before now selavie . Best time is 4pm onward when it's not too hot. Amazing view of singapore . Walking distance to many places the famous lau pa sat, one Fullerton which is just opposite the building , boat quay. As its right above MBS so for those shoppers . Shop shop shop and enjoy a glass of cocktail after or just come with friends family and chill and enjoy the amazing view. It's quite pricy for some though but a glass will not burn your pocket. So enjoy!"
,,Stunning!!!,5.0,,"everything is larger than life here..just mesmarizing..with the three iconic skyscrapers and the skypark, the interior modern architecture, the bridge that connects the hotel to the Gardens by the bay..everything top class..and we liked the way they have maintained the greenery"
,,A park over the cloud.,5.0,,"This is seems to be the largest& highest park and swimming pool on earth. Stunning view, great bar offers great drinks."
,,one of part iconic at Singapore,5.0,,one of part iconic at singapore. mostly people took a pic at this area. very close central business at singapore. clean city
,,Wow!!,5.0,,It was amazing! Spectacular views. We were there with the sun setting. The city came alive with lights. Fabulous spot to take memorable photos. The garden below lights up and changes in colours! Well worth the money.
,,Great View,4.0,,View from top is spectacular. Visitors are only allowed to access one end only which is a shame. Prices charged are a bit high for limited access.
,,Views,5.0,,"Fantastic views all around from the Skypark, the only recommendation is don't organize the tour through a tourist company, our experience is they dropped us at the front door and told us we had to go over the road and collect the tickets at the booth on the river without any instructions on which tower we had to go in or how we were to get to the booth as you weren't able to just cross the road to begin with."
,,Put this top of your list,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark (and the associated building and underground shopping area) should most definitely be a 'dont miss' priority for anyone passing through Singapore.
Its still relatively new but has already become an icon of the city with its three curved supporting towers, boat like roof platform, infinity edged hotel pool and gardens and its excellent observation deck for casual visitors with unrivalled views across the island city."
,,Unique building in the middle of a unique city,5.0,,"Even if you are not staying at Marina Bay hotel, it's worthwhile to visit the cafe and / or the night club, or pay for admission to the pool. It's probably the longest infinity pool in the world, and the views are truly incredible. Ce La Vi (formerly Ku De Ta) nightclub is also great, and the night views over Singapore offer a different kind of a thrill. If visiting the pool, go in the morning and preferably on a weekday to beat the crowds (it gets very busy from late morning onwards)."
,,Look out for the set photo!,3.0,,"The view from the top of the Sands is every bit as spectacular as you would expect. Regrettably our visit was spoilt by the badgering and harassment from the guys trying to sell a photo that is taken in front of a 'green screen' before you even get in the elevator. By the time you emerge on the 56th floor they're waiting to pounce, we politely declined the photo and went to walk out onto the deck, no, 'wait this will be the only opportunity, you should really consider buying this photo'. Again, no thanks, we were approached on two further occasions to the point I felt like we were back in Bali or Thailand fending off street hawkers. Not good given the cost and the brand of the Marina Bay Sands, certainly tainted our visit - be prepared."
,,Superb Lunch with amazing views,5.0,,"The view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands is fantastic. You can see all over the harbour down to Clarke Quay and it has a fantastic view of the Gardens by the Bay, which is only a short walk.

We had lunch at CÉ LA VI restaurant where we enjoyed some wonderful seafood and seafood salads. The restaurant wasn't cheap but it was worth it for the views and the service. The beers once you added tax were about $35 AUD each.

We also viewed the infinity pool which was also amazing.

Don't miss Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands - thought I'd gone to heaven!"
,,Best infinity pool!!,5.0,,The long infinity pool with the view of the whole singapore is the best way to relax. Enjoy your beer on top of the building while seeing the nice view of the city at night
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"As hotel guests, we had free admission. Others must pay, but the view is great. You can hang around up here for awhile, and they had a booth where you could purchase some items as well. Perhaps another reviewer knows if that included beverages? The overhanging bar as a strict dress code, not shorts for men. Common in Singapore, but not very practical."
,,Awesome Views,5.0,,"The views from the Sands Sky Park and the Singapore Flyer do not compare. They are a bit far from each other and so you'll get to see Singapore from different angles. At the Flyer, you'll see much of Marina Bay, hotels on the other side of it, Marina Reservoir, and the ships passing Singapore on the ther side of the reservoir. At the Sky Park, you'll see much of the Gardens by the Bay and much much closer views of the city. I heard that the Sky Park does not limit how long you could stay at the deck once you purchase a ticket (S$23/adult), which is why I think most tourists prefer this to the Flyer, tickets of which cost S$33/adult with one rotation lasting for half an hour. My husband and I enjoyed the awesome views and got to enjoy more of them on the other side of the rooftop as we enjoyed the infinity pool."
,,You Gotta do it,5.0,,Well worth the entry fee great view 56th floor out on front of deck you just gotta go see MRT Gets you there from just about every were go do it and enjoy the views
,,Try It Out,4.0,,"It's a nice view from the top and you can see a bunch of interesting things in a almost 360° view. The $23 price tag is kind of high for what it is but there isn't too much else to do in Singapore and this is the spot to see the skyline.

I think exploring the other nearby areas of the Marina Bay Sands such as the Shoppes and the hotel itself can make your overall adventure around here more fun and worthwhile.

Also it was difficult to find the entrance to the hotel from the mall across the street. Make sure you walk around the base of the hotel until you find the entrance because it's almost hidden!"
,,Marina bay sands,4.0,,"Great views, worth a visit! Especially on Singapore Day!!! Great air show with helicopters, fighter jet planes etc. Very spectacular!"
,,Mandatory Attraction,4.0,,"With not that much to do in Singapore this is the one attraction that is a must. Ask the taxi to take you to tower 3. It is SGD 23 to go up and is open 9:30am until 11pm. They take your photo against a green CGI backdrop before you get into the express lift and present it to you to buy when you get out at the top (cost is SGD 50).

You can stay as long as you want and the deck stretches 180 degrees around the left hand side of the building as you look at it from Fullerton bay. There are glass panels and wiring up to about 12 feet high and the views are fantastic. There are information panels identifying the key buildings on the skyline, but I think that these could have been both more detailed and with more sights pointed out. What they really lack is a map of the F1 circuit that you can follow.

There is a souvenir shop and refreshment stall at the top, but obviously prices are high so take your own drinks (there is no bag search).

Best time to go for a view during the day is Sunday early as this is transition day for tourists and is less busy."
,,"If you want to gamble, bring your passport",3.0,,"Some very nice views, wonderful selection of high end shopping, but it appears all of Singapore is like that. Several well known chefs have restaurants here."
,,You must visit at least once,4.0,,"We stayed at the MBS for the last 2 nights in order to experience the pool and skypark. The views are incredible...especially after sunset over a sundowner. Unfortunately, the pool is a people magnate and the whole area is crowded...which detracts from the whole experience. Despite the crowds, the food and drinks service is quite good."
,,Very overrated,2.0,,"The skypark is on the top of the Marina Bay Hotel complex. It costs $23 each to ascend to it on the 56th floor. You are then limited to the far left end as you look at it from the city.

If you travelled to Singapore by Singapore Airlines they will give you a 15% discount.

Once up there you get views of the harbour, the city and Singapore.

On top there is a souvenir shop, and after you buy your ticket before going up on the lift a photographer puts you in front of a green screen and takes your photograph. When you arrive at the top of the lift they try to sell you an already framed digital image for $25. If you don't purchase then there at you again on the way out.

Up on top you can get a glimpse of the ""famous"" infinity pool. While we were up there there seemed to be so many guests in it, almost overcrowded.....looked very average.

The marketers of the pool have done a wonderful job promoting it!!

You can have a drink at the bar. Prices are ridiculous say $16 for a beer. But I think alcohol in Singapore is steep anyway.

My suggestion is to go to the New Asia Bar on the 71st floor of the Equinox, it costs nothing and the views are equal if not better than the Sky Park.

For you Sky Park entry you can buy your first couple of drinks.

I have first hand experience having dined at the Equinox Restaurant. The views and experience leave Sky Park for dead. Unfortunately it is as equally expensive to eat and drink.

But I'm not being chased by a photographer and I am in air conditioned comfort."
,,"A top Architecture Art, Never gets old",5.0,,"At the top of these three towers you will find yourself on a huge Deck surrounded by Glasses, but you are on the air! Full view of Beautiful Singapore , Singapore flyer.........

If you stay in that hotel tower, YOU MUST TRY the swimming pool at the other side of the DECK,
Also KU DE TA Club at night is recommended.

Ben"
,,A little tip...,4.0,,"Don't pay the $23 (SGD) to go up on to the Skypark.

Go into the hotel and get a lift to the 57th floor, here you are able to get into the bar and a cocktail costs approximately $20. Yes it is expensive but you get the view and the cocktail rather than paying just for the view!!!

We arrived around 6pm and watched the sunset until 8pm. It was lovely seeing the lights come on over the city and the sunsetting.

I think it's a must do in Singapore but don't be drawn into paying $23 when you can get up there for free."
,,Great View..,5.0,,"We visited Singapore way back april

Great view especially if you will post it on instagram or facebook etc.. It's just that way too crowded..

Better to visit late afternoon so that you can also have a great view at night..

Bring some water because it very hot in singapore during April till july for sure.."
,,Amazing view from the top,4.0,,The view s just breathtaking. The tickets are a bit expensive but then its worthed. U get to see the coastline of Singapore and other attractions from top. Enjoy the sunset view from top with your drinks!
,,The view goes on forever and ever and ever......,5.0,,Staying at the Marina Bay Sands gives full access to the Skypark and of course the iconic infinity pool. At night the view is absolutely amazing and it overlooks the gardens and definitely worth the look. Careful if you are scared of heights.....
,,View is great,4.0,,"and free, if you don't buy and drinks and food, which are too expensive . Great platform in the sky , and overall very good"
,,Stunning view from the top,5.0,,Great view of Singapore skyline..We didn't swim in the iconic infinity pool because we were not guests of the hotel but we saw it and it's one of the best hotel pools in the world!
,,Noisy construction work,2.0,,Sadly at the time we visited there was construction work on it was loud and distracting. It seems rude to charge full admission price when the experience is not as promised. The view however is spectacular.
,,Very nice,4.0,,"Very nice and relaxing park. You can walk and be surprised by the view and the zen environment , if you want to do your jogging it is the best place"
,,Great View,4.0,,"and a nice bar at the skypark too , great for photos too , nice place to meet people from all over the world"
,,Amazing structure!,5.0,,It is truly an amazing structure with an observation desk wherein you can view the beauty of Singapore.. Try it!
,,A pool next to Heaven,5.0,,It was an amazing structure. It's like a ship on the air. The infinity pool was mesmerizing. Though we don't want to swim cause of fear of heights. It's just next to Gardens by the Bay which is convenient.
,,merina bay sands skypark .awesome,5.0,,"merina bay sands skypark .awesome and un believable un imaginational construction . three days i enjoyed alot in this park .. u also enjoy the one dont miss it ,, if u went singapore .. thank u"
,,Stunning View!,3.0,,"The skypark offers stunning view of Singapore! We were lucky the weather was superb with a little wind and sunlight !The view was really clear! The restricted area is actually very small, only offering half of Singapore's skyline.

I find it quite expensive. But worth a visit, especially if you have traveled a long way to Singapore!"
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"If you want to have one of the best views over Singapore, than the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a must. It's around 25 Sin Dollar, but the view is worth every penny. You can stay as long as you like and enjoy the view. Best time would be in the evening to see all the lights."
,,Amazing Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,We Visited Marina Bay Sands Skypark in May it is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever seen. We took the lift to the Sands Sky Park Observation Deck you can buy tickets on line or at Marina Bay $22 for adults. If eat at the observation deck or have drinks at the bar it is free. There are 57 stories high and the lift only takes seconds. The bar and restaurant area takes in beautiful views all over the city. There is also an outer deck walkway to see the sites which you also have to have tickets. The hotel inside is opulent and the staff are very friendly. We did not stay in the hotel as we were there for a short time but will look forward to it next time we are there. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks in the sun admiring the view. If you do not want to have drinks at the bar it is cheaper to pay $22 to enjoy the sites and take photos
,,Stands out,4.0,,"We just went up to have a look at the top, shaped like the Titanic infinity pool, very nice views up the, cafes etc. Just interesting shaped building so felt we would go up again whilst here."
,,Great view,5.0,,Amazing place the view at from here is amazing the bar and lounge are even amazing the singapore city is very clearly visible from here
,,FABULOUS VIEWS!!!,5.0,,Go to the SkyPark to the bar and have a beverage of your choice and enjoy the views. Bring your camera as you will want to take pictures! The infinity pool is amazing! We went for happy hour late afternoon/early evening and the light was amazing for our pictures. Really beautiful. Don't be surprised by the prices of the beverages as a glass of wine is $26. You are paying for the views. There is a fee just to ride the elevator up to see the views so go enjoy a beverage and sit for a while and really enjoy the time at the top of the world - so to speak - on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Casino! It is worth every cent you will spend on your wine/beverage as it is one of those moments in life you will always remember. You will be glad you went. Just a special place with beautiful views.
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,The sky park gives you fantastic views over Singapore and looks directly down over Gardens by the Bay. I would recommend not going during the middle of the day as it is extremely hot and there is no shelter up there and if you want to get your monies worth you need to spend a little bit of time there. Quite expensive for a view.
,,Beautiful views of the surroundings,4.0,,Went there 3 times before. Very good aerial view of the marina bay area and Gardens by the bay. Can be crowded during peak hours. Went once for a F1 party to watch the F1 race last year. It was fabulous except for the haze.
,,Light show at Marina Bay,5.0,,Yes the view is fantastic specially at Night view. I really enjoy a lot to visit marina bay. Specially water dance and the light show.
,,Opulence and Luxury,5.0,,"Where opulence and extravagance come together. It truly is a ""See how the other half live"" experience, even for those of us who live 'the good life'. This is way over the top. A place for the wealthy to shop/stay while the rest of us are left to ponder the shameless luxury and why much of the world must still live in poverty. On the lighter side, the walk across to the gardens is spectacular, and not to be missed."
,,Great View,4.0,,Singapore from a birds eye view. Take your time to digest the scenery. A must do in Singapore. Like doing the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"I was sat in a bar looking over marina bay having a nice glass or more australian red wine, I was there a good time, lots wine looking at these three towers until it was dark and the laser light show started which was massive impressive great atmosphere place would go back and recommend"
,,On top of Singapore,5.0,,Mind blowing view. It's humid up there but when you are on to of Singapore what more do you want... Enjoy some snacks or a good meal. Click a photo and show the world.
,,"beautiful waterfall, and trees",5.0,,"Need to pay a ticket to get inside, but It's ok. we can enjoy the green side of Singapore, a little change, stand out of Shopping, hotel and resorts, My favourite corners of Singapore."
,,Pretty,4.0,,"Its really pretty but the troublesome thing is that you need the pass to enter the swimming pool. The view here is really pretty expecially at night when you can see the lights around,"
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit, although it can be very crowded up there. The view over the city is great, especially at night it is something I will never forget."
,,Whow! The views,5.0,,"Just loved this place, fantastic views and the shape of this building as soon as you see it, It's then a must to go and let's face it you can't miss seeing it.
Looks like a boat upon these giant pillows.
Eating place at the top was good just enjoyed the whole time there and the staff were friendly and helpful. Great thank you."
,,"If you can't stay at the hotel, do this!",5.0,,"We did this as residents, but if you're not, then this is still absolutely worth doing. An amazing view of Singapore in all directions."
,,GREAT VIEW,3.0,,Great view but thats where the buck stops. The service and atmosphere is very disappointing. The hotel is new but looks like it already needs a revamp. Poor quality finishings. One is made to queue and be guided through areas and not allowed into guest areas and just makes the place rather stale.
,,awesome scenery,4.0,,Beautiful place to go and hang out. The place is fantastic and clean. Easy to eat and shop. Wonderful experience and good place to meet people.
,,Wow factor,5.0,,The views of Singapore from the skypark give you the wow factor. It's expensive but for a tourist visiting the area and not knowing if I'll come back it's a must do!
,,TOP OF THE WORLD VIEW FROM THE POOL,5.0,,The Food is excellent and the outdoor pool on the 57th floor is amazing. The panoramic view and downward view is mesmerizing.
,,Take your camera,5.0,,"Breathtaking views across Singapore, have drink and a meal and enjoy the panorama. A camera is certainly a must"
,,THE MOST AMAZING POOL EVER! IM COMING BACK !!!,5.0,,Couldnt get out of the pool - wonderful hotel - great people ! THE MOST AMAZING POOL EVER! IM COMING BACK !!!
,,Love the views!,4.0,,"Absolutely breathtaking views! I love it, i am afraid of heights but I definitely loved the trip up!"
,,A better investment as compred to the Singapore Flyer,4.0,,"For all those wish to experience city center of Singapore by the night , by take would be the MBSS and not the singapore Flyer. Enjoy the pool view ,Lazer show and the Garden on top of the world"
,,Great view!,5.0,,The views from the Skypark are amazing. It isn't particularly cheap but it's worth the price for the great view and the photographs you can capture up there. It never feels too busy so you have space to move around freely but it is very hot!
,,Best view of the city,5.0,,"Amazing view of the entire city from the top, loved the swimming pool and cocktails. Kids had a ball taking pictures."
,,Must Visit,4.0,,A really beautiful spot to fit into your itenary! You can basically see the whole Singapore skyline from here. Makes for very good photo shots.
,,So clean,5.0,,"We were there before New Year 2015, wish we could have stayed longer. It was so clean and tidy and huge. Unfortunately we didn't get to see the pool on top and we missed a lot of other sights. Another week in Singapore would have been good."
,,Restricted area is disappointing,2.0,,"Although view is still great, hotel guests have restricted the viewing area. In the Singapore heat there is no seating or cafe facilities. Cost of $23pp is too much now."
,,"Busy, but amazing",4.0,,"The views from atop Marina Bay Sands are just stunning, and to see how much the Gardens by the Bay have grown in less than a year was amazing."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"I can only say...amazing! If you want to be casual but still be your self and want to enjoy. Sitting in a heated whirl pool with a beer and overlooking S'Pore...that's great and some more you can dive into the infinity pool...kind of feels like your making you last dive!... Hotel room is fantastic and pls appreciate the architect and last but not least the construction workers who made this peice of work! However, if you for some reason will get tired of the room and pool and shopping diversity. Try your luck in the casino downstairs...pls set a limit for your self!"
,,Swim up Pool,5.0,,If you want to look over the top and across the Singapore skyline this is the place to combine with a swim. It is quite breathtaking as you swim towards the edge 57 floors up. I stayed at the hotel and it was expensive but would go again.
,,outstanding view,5.0,,"amazing view ..but entry fee is very very expensive..would recommend going at least once, esp around 8-9 when the water/lights display gets on..it would be good if they included access to the infinity pool with that entry price"
,,A Must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,There are few marvels of the modern world to equal this place. Take a leisurely stroll across the river from the Gardens on the Bay and stand in awe at the majestic surroundings.
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"Always enjoy taking a tour of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The views are stunning and like everything in Singapore, it is well maintained and extremely well presented."
,,Unique,3.0,,The entry fee to the Skydeck is way too expensive. The views are breathtaking and it is a good place to relax after a day of touring if you have time to walk around or have a drink - again very expensive.
,,Imposing casino in park area,2.0,,"This huge casino dominates about a quarter of this space. On the top floor is a nightclub and infinity pool which was full of people and not very private or intimate. Over rated. Shops were all high end with no one in them. Hotel guest running around in robes between floors and open space and as it has over 2,500 rooms it was crowded. Best dining experience was Din Tao Fung which was worth the 30 minute wait.excellent light dim sims. The park area was well laid out with some solar trees and two huge domes with fake forests and clouds but had an eco theme which was good."
,,Nice view!!!,4.0,,"The view from Marina Bay Sands Skypark is amazing and the best part is the entry is free. One should also check out their Skybar -""Ca La Vi"" one level above the observation deck. Prices of drinks are reasonable for enjoying the atmosphere and the view. However, if one had to choose one skybar in Singapore- it has to be One-Altitude because of greater height and thus better view."
,,most beautiful rooftop,5.0,,"From the largest infinity pool at this height, to the incredible 360 degree view to the renowned restaurant, this place is second to none. THe sunset is amazing..."
,,Wow view,5.0,,"Well, it's not free to view Singapore's skyline and I thought 23S$ are a lot of money but after spending 2h up there, enjoying the skyline and a drink+snack at the Ce La Vi bar and seeing the pool and taking incredible pics, I thought - ok, it was worth it...!"
,,Just breath taking!,5.0,,"This is a breathtaking structure by itself! You are able to walk around it, though it, under it, and in it. A visit to the bar at the top is highly recommended. If you can try the infinity pool!"
,,OMG - perfect city views,5.0,,Go up and take in Singapore by day or night - truly magical. Have a Singapore Sling at the bar then relax in the infinity pool on the roof overlooking the magnificent skyscrapers - heavenly!
,,Must go for any Singapore visitor...,4.0,,A lovely place for the basement and the top floor The basement for yummy food from all around the globe and the top floor for a great view ! There is a big ice-skating facility at the basement.
,,Worth a look,5.0,,"Worth a look, if only to see the infinity pool. However I wouldn't stay here, due to the sheer number of non-guests milling around.
Was £10 each for a pint of Stella lager, so if you intend on eating or drinking up there, take plenty of money.
It closes when the cloud is low, so go on a clear day to be able to see the whole of Singapore, and when sunny there is very little shelter, so take a hat."
,,A nice view,5.0,,"I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a week. Skypark was where I started my day and ended my day. Breathtaking views, nice breeze in the morning. Do yourself a favour and go up there."
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore,5.0,,This is a must do at sunset/night (unless you you accommodate yourself in the hotel and can enjoy the infinity pool as well). You can visit the Sky Park without buying any ticket if you get a reservation at one of the bars or restaurants at level 57. Enjoy a nice cocktail (extremely expensive) at sundown or night with the best view you can find in Singapore. They say that you can actually see the closest island of Indonesia as well as Malaysia during the day if the sky is clear.
,,Great views of the city skyline and Marina Bay!,5.0,,"This is one of the places that you must visit. Located at the top of Marina Bay Sands, this is a park in the sky, and quite literally the tallest park in Singapore.

There are restaurants located on this floor and the hotel's infinity pool is also located here. The pool is only accessible for hotel guest though.

Here, you get a great view of the city skyline, the marina Bay Area and on the other side, the view is of the Gardens By The Bay, and the coastline beyond that.

You get great views of the city skyline and Marina Bay! At certain times of the night, there's a laser and light show which is quite spectacular.

Highly recommended!

Must try!"
,,only for hotel guests,5.0,,"it's not allowed for visitors, only for hotel guests. but it really nice view with the infinity pool. the hotel is noting without this iconic attraction"
,,Exhilarating view,4.0,,Visited Marina Bay Sands Skypark in May and had a wonderful experience. The view from 56th floor of the hotel was breathtaking. Lift takes just 30 seconds to reach this floor. We were awestruck with the view of the bay from here. It was mesmerizing to see CBD buildings after sunset with all the lights on. We could also see the floating stadium from here. Its a must visit place when you are in Singapore
,,Nice View,5.0,,"Is incredible scenery.We went to the 56th floor. to have a really good view.Took lots of pictures,and took a pick of the KU DE TA restaurant and night club. No pool access , wich was sad. And you have to pay 20.00 Singapore dollars to go up there..But was worth.You can have a delicious .Donwstairs the beautiful stores and restaurants to enjoy the rest of the day."
,,Park on top of a building!,4.0,,"A pair of skyscrappers with a park at the top ! wow. Marina bay itself was hosting an event for the South East Asia Games - we met the British rowing team - the British Dragons they offered us drinks on our way to our walk to the Gardens!
Waliking to the sky park was hot and humid but we kmade it the builing hosts many restaurants and a venetian river with gondolas for hire!

From here you can walk to the beautiful Gardens of Singapore"
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,From the 56th floor you are able to have a good view of Singopore. You are unable to access the top of Marina Bay and the Pool area any more. The view of the pool is also very limited as well.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beautiful hotel with great restaurants & an amazing pool a must visit when in Singapore. Great view of the bay.
,,Absolute must visit- best view of Singapore,5.0,,"Incredible, breathtaking scenery. The pool gives an unforgettable view of the beautiful city, but even if you just visit the observation deck you will enjoy this trip"
,,A must see!,5.0,,This place was really worth the fee to go up to the observation deck.... I would like to return one day to stay at this hotel.
,,Over-rated,2.0,,"The view up the top is great, but it was very smoggy when we were up there so didn't bother with photos. $120 for an average bottle of white that you would pay about $25 in Oz. They had bottles of spirits for nearly $10k... They wouldn't let me into the restaurant as I had shorts on, yet there were many young women with hot pants on and of course they we allowed into the restaurant. It's a better place to take photos than the flyer as you are not locked into a cylinder for 45 minutes. Just do it cos it's there..."
,,Boring place you can ever find,1.0,,"I cannot understand why Marina Bay Sands is so highly rated. Just a modern architecture so mediocre that you can find in capital cities. If you are planning to spend more than an hour here, I suppose you will end up in any of the cafes nearby. For that price tag to have a ""panoramic view"" of the CBD that you can find even in African capitals, I personally feel that it is just not worth."
,,Best Place to Visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Must Visit if you're traveling to Singapore. This is one of the best place to visit and if you're going there in the evening so you can see the water show of ""What a Wonderful World"" which is really great ever and will win your heart that im sure about. Happy Travel."
,,Head up to the bar for free entry,4.0,,If you wait until midday you can head up the elevator to Cé La Vi bar and restaurant. You get almost the same view as the skypark but with a free beer to enjoy for the $20. Entry is just before you exit the main doors towards the skypark entry. I.e. Still inside the hotel building.
,,"Architecture , luxury and location",5.0,,"Absolutely stunning! The hotel, the famous infinity swimming pool, the luxury brands shopping! Even if you're not a guest, worth the visit!"
,,Amazing views and wonderful infinitely pool,5.0,,"I brought my parents here for a night stay. The room is comfortable and classy.
Of course,it has the best location as its near to MRT, shopping mall and places of interests like Garden by the Bay, Satay by the Bay, alive Museum at Suntec City.

You must try the infinitely pool and go up to the Skypark. Great view in great pool makes me feel great too.

For tourist, if you are staying here around mid- July to Aug 9 on Saturday, you will be able to see firework. (choose the directly facing the river)"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Amazing views of Singapore. No queues and straight to the top. Hop on/off bus stop right outside. A must do if in Singapore.
,,Good views but not good value.,3.0,,"When we booked to see the Marina Bay Sands Skypark, the name indicated that were would be visiting the gardens on the top of the hotel complex. However, the $23 ticket only gave access to a small lookout area on the overhanging portion of the roof. The gardens and pool area were only for guests of the hotel, and were cordoned off and guarded by bouncers. The views from the top were great, but our overall feeling was that we were overcharged for what we actually got."
,,Bucket list - tick!,5.0,,"An amazing pool and hotel, stayed only two nights, but had an amazing time! Buffett breakfast - perfect! Staff - perfect! Pool - amazing!"
,,World Class Hotel! Love the sky garden and pool!,5.0,,"Another one of those hotels in Singapore that does not need much review. Simply a world class hotel. The rooms are great and huge. The sky garden is just amazing. The pool.... well... that's probably everyone's most favorite spot for pictures. You could have a stroll to the Gardens by the bay. Truly a great place for all ages. Okay fine, no casinos for the young :)"
,,Amazing views of Singapore,4.0,,We decided to visit the Skypark on our last day in Singapore. It was not the best of days as it was raining but that meant less people went to the top. The views were stunning especially as there was a thunder and lightning storm coming towards Singapore which added to the excitement. The photos I said no to but when they went down to $10 I decide t say yes - not sure it was worth it even at that price. Worth a visit.
,,Singapore in an hour,5.0,,"The observation deck of the Marina Bay Sands is definitely a must-go site in Singapore. Whether you want to take a good glimpse of what a modern cosmopolitan city is, or enjoy swimming like floating in the sky, or just taking pictures from the deck of the gardens by the bar or the sky line on the other side. I would say it is Singapore in an hour or in 50 years! Happy Birthday Singapore! I love SGlah!"
,,Put it on your to do list.,4.0,,We went up just before dusk and spent two hours taking photos as the natural faded and town lights came on. As a photographer I did enjoy the experience. You are informed no monopods or tripods are allowed. Many people did smuggle small ones up and these can be used safely on the small shelving at the top. Before you get onto the viewing platform you are offered the snap shot they take of you before going up in the lift. 55Sgd with a folder 35 without. We refused to pay that. On our way out we were offered them at 35 & 20Sgd. This is blatant rip off tack ticks. Offer them at a sensible price to start off with and they will sell. Definitely a must do in Singapore and it will cost you 23sgd .
,,Total waste of time,3.0,,"Having spent some money just to get up to the top, we realised we weren't actually at the top. There is a bar that you can drink and eat at which will give you all the best views."
,,This was a must for my visit to Singapore.,5.0,,"The entry fee is $23 to go up to the sky park.
We went here during the day and took a lot of great photos of Singapore.
The middle of the day may not be the best as it is very hot up there.
The guys selling photos are a bit annoying but just say no.
I cant believe they would bin them rather than just sell them at $10 each.
If the photos were cheaper I would spend $50 like I did at Universal Studios and got 4 different ones.
I am still glad I went and will try evening next time."
,,Impressive views but potentially very expensive!,2.0,,"Having wandered round all day we found Marina Bay Sands Skypark. As there were no instructions on how to get to the skypark, hotel staff informed us that there were two options; buy a ticket (Floor 56) or have a drink in the bar (Floor 57) which allowed to access the Skypark.

The best way to the viewing deck is via Tower 3 and take the lift to 56/57 floor.

If you're going to the bar bring your wallet. Two small cocktails came to over $50.00 and to top it off the view was obscured due to the small decking space and the number of people present.

Buying a drink in the bar does not give you automatic access to the general sky view area (floor 56) due to the fact that it is owned by another company. Therefore you have to pay an additional ticket fee (unknown how much/hopefully not $50.00). Concierge staff had told us differently so we felt a bit conned by this point."
,,Truly Amazing View,4.0,,"This is one of the best tourist destinations in Singapore. City view from the place is absolutely fascinating. One can watch magnificent city sky-line from this place. It is a place to be enjoyed with friends, family & kids."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"All I can say is that this is not something you ""leave for next time"" Do it every time! The views are spectacular and go on forever. You can see the whole city, the sea and the Gardens by the bay. The photos are brilliant too! Worth every penny!"
,,Amazing night views of Singapore's skyline,5.0,,The night views are outstanding. For just a few dollars more opt for a drink at KuDeTa skybar instead of buying the ticket for Skypark :-) !!
,,Lousy,2.0,,"Despite its remarkable construction it just doesn't work as a resort poolside area.

And I would imagine it would be pretty hard to make midifications to fix.

Also just a technicality it is not one pool. There is a clear separation in the middle.

Lots of risk and trip risks also to my amateur assessment.

Felt out of place as I didn't have a selfie stick.

No umbrellas either?"
,,Best spot for enjoying the city in high.,5.0,,"Forget the Spore flyer. This skypark has a perfect spot for taking entire city pictures during day time or night time. I was here on early Jun 2015, access from tower 3, use elevator to 57 floor, and it will take you only 30 seconds to reach to the top.
It is free access. Luggage are not allowed. You may take your professional camera to get better results during night time. This level is higher than the pool side level which can be seen from here."
,,Worth five stars but way overpriced,4.0,,"The views are spectacular the best time is at dusk just as the skyline lights up. The laser show at 8 is not very good.
The prices are as high as the view.
Elevator 23. Drinks (bad) 23 - 68 for a sake. But worth doing, once !"
,,Rip off,2.0,,We duly paid $76 Singapore dollars for my husband 11 yr old and child who turned 13 that day so was adult price (we did say he was 12 years old but he piped up and said I'm 13 today remember) so we were charged adult fare for him. We headed to the elevator where we had to pass a green screen and had a photo taken. We waited a minute for the elevator then traveled up to the 56th floor where the sky park is situated. Once out of the lift we were greeted by staff who had already developed the photo of us with a superimposed background of the Marina Sands Hotel on one side of the folder and a shot of the city at night on the other side. Beautiful leather folder and ours for $55 if we liked. No thanks was my answer.once out on the deck we got to walk around and take in the view. Yes it was stunning but that was all you got for the $76. There is not even a close up view of the Infinity pool. That is situated at the far end of the structure with a vast expanse between the observation deck and the pool.. once we finished looking at the view we walked back in towards the elevator where the photo sellers approached my husband to get him to buy the photos. He too refused the $55 package. Not happy to take no for an answer they continued to follow my husband saying if you wish you can have the two photos on their own for $35. Again the answer was no. I would not recommend this attraction unless you really wanted to part with a hefty amount of money just for a view of the city
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Nice views of the city and the sea and ships. A souvenir stand with some nicer postcards if you're planning on sending some.

Note that, if you built up some promotional dollars gambling in the casino (you have to get a rewards card when you first go to the casino), you can use them to pay the entrance fee here."
,,25SGD to see the skycraper building in Singapore,4.0,,Sunset view is beautiful. Honestly speaking i Dont think 25SGD worth it a for that little space . You just go to corner of the deck to see the skycrapers . Just to get to elevator they charge you 25SGD. Actaully what you get to see is singapore flyer and few buildings. I say better go to Altitude bar u can have the full view of marina bay. from marina bay no beautiful view
,,Nice view but too pricey,3.0,,"The view is great from the skypark. But probably not worth the S$24 ticket. There's not much to do, other than walk around and take photos of the view."
,,"Except for the ridiculously priced unattractive photo being sold, everything is exceptional and worth coming to!",5.0,,"Visited it for the first time and it is one of the most breathtaking city scape sight you can get! It gives you a good view of what Singapore looks like from up there and surely somewhere I would never tire going back to.

The SkyPark also has a restaurant-lounge where you can stay at and just digest the fantastic view in front of you.

One thing that is ridiculous is the photo-op and the photo itself being sold when you enter the SkyPark. They sell it at I think 50$ which doesn't make sense because you can get a better picture and background when you get in the SkyPark with the fantastic view as your real background. Seriously?"
,,What's with the hustle???,3.0,,"Singapore is generally blissfully free of the ""touting"" (as the marked signs say: ""NO TOUTING"") hustling and belabored in-your-face pestering and to have the digital photo vendors at the elevator ride to the sky park begin the jargon laden, heavy sell with ""usually $100 Singapore dollars but we have a sale today, not only... but for you, my friend... special price of S$55"" was nearly unfathomable, and very clearly out of place, out of character and incredibly disappointing - this exclusive and pricey ride to the top ($40US for two, give or take) is totally marred by this street vendors abuse - so brace yourself, or at least, be so advised.

You enter from a downstairs location just past the car/taxi drop-off location at the end of the hotel (yes: ""go down to go up"") or you COULD be foolish enough to commit yourself to catching an overpriced drink or a meal at the restaurant and get the same ride for free to pretty much the same location)

There is a 360 view from a higher location in town - but then you don't get to tippy toe ogle the infinity pool with pleased as punch peeps hanging over the precarious edge defining wikipedia style the ""VERY IDEA OF AN INFINITY POOL OVERLOOKING A CITY SKYLINE"" - did get some wicked panorama shots off the iPhone at night even (you know: 'totally Facebook material' - but I am resisting or too lazy to post it..) It's in the category of ""gotta do it, just gotta see it"". Pay up and pucker up for the selfie"
,,Give the deck vist a wide birthe,1.0,,"The unscrupulous owners of this hotel charge something like $30 to just travel up an elevator to a deck, just a deck, overlooking the bay. They even charge children prices for our 2.5 year old.. I found this cheeky and I did not feel it was at all worth the price tag. Avoid."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"Fantastic panoramic view on a sunny day, well worth the price. Drinks are expensive at the bar, but I guess visitors are not here to get drunk."
,,Best view of Singapore,4.0,,"Visited it after sunset , breathtaking view of Singapore from the Skypark . Should visit just before sunset to have a day time view ."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,We visited the marina bay sands skypark for an early evening cocktail. The service was excellent and the views spectacular. This is a fantastic place to take photographs of Singapore both in the day time and at night. There is no fee to pay for visiting this attraction if you are purchasing a drink at the bar.
,,Overpriced,3.0,,Nice view but a little overpriced not really worth the money. Only spent about 20 minutes and thats taking it slow.
,,Infinity pool,5.0,,"Staying at MBS gives you an advantage of what Singapore could offer when it comes to night view and scenery.Overlooking the Merlion Park, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay, Singapore famous garden, etc.....you would not want to leave the place. The infinity pool atop the MBS is a plus."
,,Touristy and cheesy,2.0,,"Another one of those overpiced attractions that only offers good views and nothing else. The topping was the ""mandatory"" picture at the entrance which by the time I got to the top had turned into a kitsch photo frame...
Nowhere near the top things to do, particularly if your time in the city is limited."
,,A must visit,4.0,,Amazing views from the observation deck on the 56th floor it was a cloudy day and raining when I visited but a great experience never the less. A must visit for taking photos of the Sinapore skyline and surroundings. A little expensive at 20 Singapore dollars but worth it. Would I stay in this hotel? Certainly not! Too big and too many tourists like me around the place all a little impersonal for me
,,A very expensive experience,3.0,,"After paying about 20 Singaporean dollars, we went to the Skypark by the lift.

From there, Gardens by the Bay can be seen. Some people choose to come there at 7:45 pm or 8:45 pm to watch Gardens by the Bay's light show from there. It should be added that you are not allowed to enter and take a photo from the pool located above this building.

All in all, not worth 20 Singaporean dollars."
,,Stunning View and as close to the Infinity Pool as you can get w/o being a hotel guest,4.0,,"This was a MUST on my list - its such an awesome architectural feat and that infinity pool at the top is world-famous so why not take a peek! For pool access, you need to be staying at this hotel unfortunately. Its not cheap but definitely doable for a treat-yo-self one night stay!

I just wanted to be at the top looking down so I simply bought a pass to the top. It was not expensive and was worth it for the view - you're higher then the Singapore Flyer, which is the huge ferris wheel just across from this hotel. You get to over look the Gardens by the Bay as well as far as the eye can see in any direction! Breath-taking - night probably looks different from the day though. In hindsight, another way to enjoy this view would have been to go up to the roof-top bar for a drink. It would cost just as much as the ticket to get up just to the Skypark but at least you also get a drink in hand!"
,,Fantastic place to stay,5.0,,"Best thing was the infinity pool and spa. 5 star hotel to be on your bucket list of places to see, 3 level shopping center, casino, museum and rooms are immaculate with all you could ask for. Only downside was drinks very pricey at $25 or more per glass depending on your choice."
,,Breathtaking Experience,5.0,,"My husband and I stayed here our last night in Singapore, even tho the price is quite high, I strongly recommend to stay at least one day in this beautiful hotel, the view from our room was at the Gardens By the Bay ( we even enjoyed the 8 pm light show) , and the pool is something to see at least once in your life... it is worth all the money."
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"Whether you ascend to the Skypark as a visitor, or you can occupy the main part (including Infinity Pool) as a guest, the Skypark is a breathtaking achievement. It sits across the top of the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands a bit like a large alien mothership. The curves of the design only add to your sense of ""how on earth did they build that?"" A fantastic view across Marina Bay; a glimpse down to a portion of the F1 track; great views of the Singapore Flyer and the new Gardens by the Bay."
,,The sensation and the view from the Skypark and the swimming pool with a vanishing edge,5.0,,"The hotel is very big and impersonal. But you ought to spend a night to enjoy during the day and at night the extraordinary view from the Skypark and a swim in the world's longest elevated swimming pool with a 146-metre vanishing edge, perched 191 metres above the ground."
,,Great views but not great on a windy night,3.0,,I visited this area in early January of this year. It had great views but I felt quite uneasy being up so high when it was so windy outside! The floor actually felt as if it was moving!
,,The experience and the view from the skypark is not to be missed,4.0,,I am not 100% happy with heights in general but the layout and construction of this skypark make it feel as if you are not as high as you really are.
,,fascinating,5.0,,fasciniting you won't see something like this elswhere. Artificial trees in a tropical surrounding in many colours and varieties. acces is by bridge a bit hard to find !
,,Outstanding view.,5.0,,"Had a few drinks in the bar at the top, with the most spectacularly view in Singapore. Drinks were a bit pricy, but a beer will cost you the same as the admission ticket to the lower sightseeing deck. So don’t hesitate.
Tried to get a table in the restaurant, but was unable to get one with a view without a reservation."
,,Filipino friends and Laksa? It works here,4.0,,"Never disappoints except when they have private function plus renovation. Nevertheless I look forward to the balcony area with a new look with breezes, sunsets, city views and great local eats. Laksa, Chicken rice and splurge on Maine lobster hokkien mee."
,,The overall look of Singapore,4.0,,It was a beautiful day when we got there and there you can see Singapore. Beautiful view though I think it's overpriced coz' it's pretty plain up there..it just offer the view and a small cafe.
,,Very poor bar,2.0,,"During my 14 days stay in Singapore for the wedding of my son, I went to the bar on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The bar is very small when you compare with the rooftop bar of The Fullertonbay Hotel where you can have a seat without eating.
The rooftopbar of Marina Bay Sands has no fresh fruitjuices.
Only the views are amazing.
When visiting the hotel it gives a very unpersonal impression, I must confirm the reviews of complaints I saw before my visit."
,,Breathtaking View From the Pool,5.0,,It is one of the best experience in Singapore. You find a large pooI on the top of the hotel. There is no poolside toward the town so you can see the breathtaking view directly from the pool. In the night the view is even more nice.
,,Cracking view of Singapore,4.0,,I have give the place a miss many times but finally gave in. Once you arrive at the top you are treated to unchallenged views of Singapore and its well worth the cost to get to the top. I was sunny and hot when we went so remember the sun protection.
,,Best view of Singapore,4.0,,"There is no better spot to get a birds-eye view of Singapore than from the impressive Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Situated right atop the impressive architecture of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, you can get an almost 360 view of the city and beyond. Don't forget to take your camera but tripods are not allowed for some obscure reason although we saw a couple of people with them. And be aware that perched up there it is very very hot and there is very little shade so wear a hat and take your sunblock if you are going to linger. There is a snack bar and a restaurant to buy drinks which like everything else about this place, tends to be expensive. Unfortunately you won't be allowed a dip in the rooftop pool unless you are a guest of the hotel but it's the best view in town even if you are just passing through."
,,Tourist,4.0,,"Very impressive indeed, beautiful building.
I went at night to get an appreciation of the city lights.
$23 to access the sky park but believe you can avoid this if you are going up to the bar? Where a beer is $19 but as others have said it's probably a one off experience and worth it really."
,,Great Experience,4.0,,Amazing views! Great place to hang around! It is conveniently located in a central location which will hellp to go to any place in short time.
,,Nice bay views,4.0,,"For $23, you are allowed to ride the elevator up to the viewing deck. You are not allowed to visit the pool area. The views are fabulous. You can see all the major structures in the area as well as the city beyond."
,,View of Singapore,5.0,,360 degree beautiful view of Singapore!!! We visit there on SEA Game open ceremony day. From 57th floors we will see fireworks of the ceremony with city view in the same time. Worth to visit.
,,wow factor on top floor,5.0,,I have been to Singapore several times in recent years but not been to this iconic piece of contemporary architecture . So on a recent stopover I made a point of visiting this hotel including lunch in the food court basement and a drink in the sky tower bar on the roof .Views were sensational and even the foyer of the hotel was worth seeing . Any trip to Singapore should include this attraction.Budget permitting I would stay in the hotel next trip and experience the infinity pool on the roof!
,,A new landmark for Singapore.,5.0,,"It is one of kind building in the world. Three skyscrapers connected by a single structure,that looks like a giant ship is sittingon top of it. From here, you can relax and enjoy the panoramic view with your foods. The huge infinity pool with many palm trees around make it a wonderful spot for pictures. At lower levels, you have world-class shopping center carry all high end brand products. There is a bridge leading you to the Marina garden by the bay."
,,Watch The Sun go Down .,5.0,,Went up there with little expectations. Probably at the best possible time ( twilight ) ..... To view the transition from daylight to the neon lights is an experience in its own. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Stunning,4.0,,"Well worth the realistic twenty Singapore dollars to go up almost to the top of this iconic Singapore landmark. Actually worth it just to walk through the beautiful hotel lobby!
You can't get up to the infinity pool area but close enough to see it and it doesn't matter because the views are just fabulous."
,,Got to See,4.0,,"This is one place every traveller to Singapore has to visit, the views are fantastic, wether you are looking back over Singapore or the Marina Bay Gardens.
Beware drinks are expensive in the bar, but heck, its only once every blue moon you visit somewhere so special."
,,go and have a drink,5.0,,"a must, great view, expensive drinks, but I guess that is a way to control the amount of people going up there, i will have a bar also at the look out deck"
,,The best view in Singapore,4.0,,"Just the best view in Singapore, so come prepared with your best camera and zoom lens. As a non-resident of Marina Bay you are limited to the bow of the 'ship' (so to speak) but the view north and east is sensational. We could see why there are no seats or shade as they really don't want people to stay there for a long time. Just take your pictures and go. However, on a hot, sunny, day it would have been nice to rest the legs if only for a short time. So, be prepared for a fairly quick visit!!"
,,Simply WOW,5.0,,"What an enchanting view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel - the now landmark of Singapore. What can you expect on it - beautiful experience as if flying in the sky in a large boat, Palm trees & swimming pool - giving a feeling on the beach, swimming pool with border-less view as if you would directly fall off down if swim towers the edges or dine in the sky.

Have those magical moments built up from this Sky-deck (Sky-Park). Enjoy the beautiful Singapore as you can see far-off places from the top - The Merlion, Singapore River, Esplanade, Gardens by the bay, the Helix bridge, the giant Wheel - all with a fascinating view from the deck.

Entry to the deck (and the swimming pool) is free for guests staying at the hotel. However for visitors just to visit the deck will cost SGD20.

Must visit place for travelers to Singapore."
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,You will stand amaze by this structure. After my second visit I was still wondering what it represent I still see it as a boat hotel. Beautiful and you have to go to the top level to have a great view of the whole of Singapore
,,Amazing Skypool. Very good and freindly staff,5.0,,"We only took it for one night, yet very very satisfied. The Staff is super Duper Friendly and upon single request, upgraded me for free to the City view room without any extra cost.

The swimming pool on roof top is an experience in itself, day or night! The Hotel itself is a good site to walk around too. Conveniently located! Would surely come again"
,,Great View,4.0,,We visited this on a day trip from our cruise ship. Was nice. Entrance fee is required to go up. Good view at the top. You are limited to the front portion of the Skypark. The rest is for paying guests.
,,Stunning and Breathtaking,5.0,,"An amazing experience you have no seen anywhere in the world. Nothing is comparable to swimming in that pool. Beautiful view, weather is usually pretty good because of the height. A must to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Best view to Singapore,4.0,,"I was visiting Singapore for a couple of days (business), but I had one dayoff.

I went up there (was definitely worth it), but through the bar. The admission fee for tourists is S$ 26, but the bar is located even higher than the actual rooftop. At the bar I had an ice cold beer for S$ 16 which is still expensive but I enjoyed the view there as well."
,,"Stunning, stunning, stunning",5.0,,Clearly this building is quickly being recognized at an architectural marvel. Living here in Singapore while it was being build I still shake my head in amazement on how they did it. The views from the top are spectacular and if you are there at night the last show is worth the wait. Have a (very expensive) drink at the Ku de ta bar and soak in the Singaporean skyline. If you go to the bar you may avoid the admission fee to the observation deck.
,,NOT worth the price,3.0,,"Not worth the S$23 admission price. You are confined to a small deck area at the end of the building and there is s NO shade whatsoever , They only tell you this after you have paid,.so i wouldn't advise a day time visit. there are no binoculars or telescopes to make it more interesting, so you will only want to stay a few minutes They take your photo before you go up then badger you to buy it when you exit the elevator. I think the Singapore Flyer would be better value.a little dearer but you are in aircondtioned comfort."
,,Great view,4.0,,Great view over the city skyline. Go up just before sunset so you can see the city in day and nighttime. Worth the 20$
,,PHOTOGRAPHERS (real or wanna-be): This is the Place to Go!!,5.0,,"This was an exceptional view of Singapore

WHAT WAS THE BEST PART
- SUNSET was spectacular
- FREE laser light show at night
- AFTER DARK see the city lit up
- COST was reasonable for admittance
- EASY TO GET CAB back to my hotel

WEAK
- No Tripod for your camera (if security sees you)
- Crowded at sunset but not impossible just be patient

* If visiting Singapore, you have to do this!"
,,Boring,1.0,,Boring.Boring.Boring. i rather jump from the sky top into the botom of their river. Save your money from spending unnecessary things
,,Brilliant brunch,5.0,,"Great place to visit, fantastic brunch, great gardens. Dress policy for cocktails later in the day so don't forget proper shoes!"
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"Well worth the $20 to go up,however if you go up to the bar and buy a drink it does not cost the $ 20 only cost of drink,which by Singapore standards not dear. For 4 of us ,3 tiger beers and a cocktail $92."
,,"views are great, service not that well",3.0,,swimming in the infinity pool is an experience you'll not find anywhere else. Too bad that the service is not that good.
,,A Must Go,5.0,,"This iconic building is the landmark of Singapore. The Sky Park is usually crowded with people but good to go up at least once. If you are a hotel guest, grab your swimming costumes and enjoy ""been watched"". Haha …."
,,Terrific view!,5.0,,Excellent view and good service! The right place to be if you love breath taking views. I would definitely recommend this beautiful place to my family and friends. We had a pleasant stay and enjoyed every moment spent here.
,,Great view!,4.0,,The view is worth the cost of going 56 floors up. You are only allowed on the observation deck; no time limit. The pool is off limits to non-guests of the hotel but you can get a small glimpse of it. The view of the city and the gardens is amazing as well as the marina. They also try to get u to buy the photos when u reach the top but I don't think it's worth it since u are gonna take pictures at the top anyway.
,,You need to experience it,5.0,,"Going to the top of this awesome hotel is worth the $20 or so to go up. You can see a great view of the city and Marina Bay. The Singapore Flyer is also a good site seeing opportunity, but the wheel just keeps on turning; but you can stay on top here for as long as you want. I'm in Singapore about 4 times a year and this place is really a site to see. It doesn't get old."
,,Great View!,4.0,,We went there recently. It was a not-to-miss trip if you are visiting Singapore. We had fun & enjoyed!
,,A must see,5.0,,We were guests at the hotel so got to enjoy full access to the Skypark. Amazing views and service by staff. Would fully recommend to family and friends to visit even if not staying at the hotel itself. Might even run into a celebrity.
,,Just fantastic,5.0,,Great views greats service. Pool is great. Better once the renovations are completed. Price are very steep so beware.
,,Dizzy,5.0,,fantastic views from the top drinks are a bit expensive up on top in the bar. There is a gift shop with a few bits an pieces to take away with you as a memento I got a fridge magnet. the lift up is quite fast.
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Took the lift to the top for a nosy. Amazing views of the city and a great opportunity for a drink and some pictures,"
,,Good view...!!!,4.0,,"Paid $23 to get in, at the entrance the staff took pictures of us and get the printed picture on the top, had to pay $55 to get the photo which was ridiculous. The view was good, but dont buy drink up there at the small kiosk if you dont want to get heart attack.

Better go during the afternoon where the sun is not too strong....."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Worth the trip to the top of Marina Bay Sands for the views over Singapore and bay area. Take refreshments with you - not the cheapest to buy there.
,,"amazing views, but thats all.",3.0,,"Costs about 23 singapore dollars, for very limited access, but they do explain that before you pay. Fantastic views, but nowhere to sit- you are not encouraged to stay long. Official photos are expensive."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,Amazing views of Singapore and the harbour. Gives you a good perspective of local attractions. Night time view on a clear night are well worth the trip.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,We went to Marina Bay Sands to see the view of Singapore fantastic well worth it $23.00 each. I only wish we had stayed longer to see all the city lights and the garden by the bay light up. Will have to do it next time You can go to the hotel cocktail bar on the 57 floor for free but with a beer and orange juice costing $32 you are better off going to the sky deck on the 56 floor the views are better and not as crowded
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Managed to have a drink at the bar on top of Marina Bay, great views you will feel like you are on top of the world."
,,An iconic building with great views,4.0,,"Being that Marina Bay Sands is such an iconic building in Singapore - it is a must to visit the sky park if you are not staying at the hotel. Not visiting would be a bit like going to New York and not visiting the Empire State or TOTR for the views of the city.

There are pros and cons to the different ways you can check out the views.
1. You can head straight up to KuDeTa and buy yourself a drink at the bar (we did this) - cheapest was a beer at $19. However, you don't have to do this as no one is keeping track of whether you do or don't. The bar area is small & hot & stuffy with lots of people & you may have to wait a bit to get served. It also lacks atmosphere - so not somewhere you wish to linger. You do not have access to the restaurant area or to the skypark deck below. The views are OK from here (would be good if no people around) but there is very little room to move, put your drink down or to take pictures. Forget even seeing the light show from here.

2. You can pay the entry fee of $23 pp which then gets you into the skypark deck viewing area of which offers much better and clearer views, is less crowded and you can check out the laser lights from above (which are totally different to that on ground level).

As the whole reason for coming to the sky park is to take in the views & get great photos (without peoples heads in the way), then I think in hindsight I would just pay the $23 and head up to the viewing deck and afterwards find somewhere else for a cheaper beverage. I think the option we took of a drink at the bar and a partial view was a bit disappointing and to be honest, we finished our drink pretty quickly and left.

If this review is helpful to you, please click yes."
,,stunning views from the top,5.0,,"while you have to pay to get to the top it's totally worth it (discounts for seniors). The all around view of the city is awesome. Bring an umbrella to shield yourself from the sun. It gets very hot up there (you can buy refreshments).
Signage tells you what you're looking at in multiple languages.
when you're done with that cool down in the hotel lobby and watch the people. It's great fun. Or shop or have some food"
,,phenomenal,5.0,,"the sky walk was cool, and sitting at the restaurant and the view was excellent....my kids enjoyed the height where the restaurant was...."
,,Great view ever,5.0,,"I went there for dinner. Food and wine n DJ was great. It's really a high class point. However, the restaurant was a little bit dark inside"
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5.0,,"The Skypark Observation Deck it at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is probably the cheapest option if you are staying elsewhere other than the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to get up to the top.
Excellent view of Singapore and views of the swimming pool, although you aren't able to have a swim with this option.
There is a restaurant you can visit up the top, as well as snacks and drinks."
,,"awesome views,nevertheless there's a better option",4.0,,"if you visit in the evening, a bit of advice, instead of paying for the entrance (S$23) just go to the tower 3 entry and there is an entry to the bar (sky bar if I am correct). Just go up and have a drink (smart dress they say, just make sure you don't wear flip-flops and shorts). Get a beer or a glass of wine and you will pay the same as entry to skypark, have the same view and have a drink as well. My opinion, not really suitable for family with kids though...Anyway well worth it, views are amazing"
,,Amazing view,5.0,,The best place to go if you wanna see the city from the top don't miss this one its amazing loving every minute of it.
,,Magnificent views,5.0,,"The veiw from the top of this hotel is fantastic we went up a night and the view across singapore was brilllient.
Even brought the photo you have taken before going up mainly because of the back ground.
We are visiting singapore again in November and would love to go up during the day light this time for another look"
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"We started with a walk around the Marina Bay Sands complex, shops, Boardwalk etc etc then decided to go to the Skypark as the access to the Marina Bay Gardens was under repair when we got there. This is a must do if your in the area, however when you go in they take two photos of you (almost without choice) and when you get to the top the photos are printed and in a beaut leather folder. Cost is SG$55 for one or $90 for two which I thought was expensive. We did the walk round, had a beer or two then when we went out the price drops to $25 for one, in a cardboard stand, but you get to choose which one you want to keep. The view is sensational and worth the expense, even though nothing is cheap. This is a must do."
,,Couldn't get a better view of Singapore,5.0,,Skypark is one of the best locations to see Singapore. I decided to skip the Singapore Flyer after having been to Skypark. You might to pay $20 and get access to the sky deck where photography can be a lot of fun.
,,Sunset up there is stunning.,4.0,,If you wear a jacket you might be tempted to take the direct elevator to KuDeTa and avoid the visitors' circuit.
,,WOW!,5.0,,"The top park looks like a spaceship landed right here. Once up, its amazing to see the city of Singapore on one side and the vast ocean on the other. A must visit !"
,,Dispointing rip off,1.0,,"It promised a view and technically we got one, but that is where it stops. For a start COSTS at $23 each including our 13 year old and no family pass, compared to $28 for Gardens by the Bay which was a great experience and good value for money.

There was no shade and no seating and unbearably hot. When sitting on the side on the tiered platform in the only shade for a brief respite we were asked to move on. Restricted access and only confined to the front at the top. It is worth a $5 experience at the most.

It is absolutely unsuitable to people with limited mobility

(If you want a free view of the city go to the Ion shopping complex in Orchard Rd at the 55th level)"
,,Worth the expense,5.0,,"Go to the top and enjoy the views! Warning though, don't go at the heat of the day, it is HOT up at the top!
See the city, the F1 racing arena, the shipping boats, the views can't be beat!
Bathrooms, gift shop, drinks available on top of the boat."
,,Needing a view?,4.0,,We caught the lift to the top and loved the view. Had an expensive drink at the bar and waited for a table before the light show at 7.45. There wasn't a table so we sat outside and watched from there. Very nice.
,,Amazing Hotel,4.0,,"This is a high end state of the art luxury hotel - nothing is too much trouble.
Beautiful from incredibly stunning if somewhat hypoxia inducing top where you can enjoy cocktails on the deck, phenomenal nightclub as well as lounge by the pool in the daytime."
,,great view,5.0,,the building of Marina Bay sands is beautiful. Mall has very well known brands. Skypark is beautiful. Must visit.
,,to much money for this view.,2.0,,"We tried to go to the skylark, but fond out that the price is s$23,- per person. So we went back again. later on we had the tip just go from tower 3 to the rester ant in the Skypark You only have to order a drink. You save at least $15,- per person and the view is the same"
,,worthy addition to you bucket list,5.0,,If you stay in the hotel then entry to the pool and park is free. Otherwise it is $28 per person. Still I think better value than eye in the sky as you are higher up for view. The view the park gardens and the pool are stunning
,,Sky Park,5.0,,"A bit expensive but if you spend so much on your holiday then skypark is not be missed, on the 56th floor of Marina Bay sands the entire city is seen. Best time to visit is in the evening where u can enjoy the breeze, city lights and laser show is there. Last entry timing is 9.30 pm"
,,Views,5.0,,"The views from the skypark are incredible, definitely a must see if your in Singapore, go at night to see the magnificent city lights."
,,A must see,5.0,,A great place to see day or night. Have lunch or diner there. The food is nice and the people are welcoming
,,Views incredible…. WOW!,5.0,,"We had only a limited amount of time and decided to go to the top at the bar and restaurant. We were not disappointed. The view to the cruise ship terminal, harbour and Singapore Flyer was AMAZING! The drink at the bar had beautiful sights."
,,Great views and an array of restaurants in the complex,5.0,,Amazing views from a freakingly stunning building. 360 degree view and you have to pay to wander around the rood top deck if you are not a house guest..from memory around $15. Well worth it so check out the casino and shops...if you don't take photo ID the casino will want $100 entry fee as they assume you are a local (no charge for tourists)
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Looked at from below, this really does look like a train in the sky, across the tops of the tall marina buildings. Up there, there's a great outside bar, which doesn't require booking, though gets pretty crowded at times; and an inside restaurant, which usually but not always requires booking. Great views of the city."
,,Ship like Skypark,3.0,,"I like about this place is the outlook is like a ship.When reach up the top,can have anice and can see whole of Singapore What I dislike is always very crowded with people"
,,breathtaking,4.0,,i was wordless when i was atop this massive structure. the edges give you a real thrilling experience. dont miss the chance when in singapore. really worth the money.
,,Recommend Sky on 57 at other end of the building,3.0,,"Skypark costs you $24 per person. If there are two of you, I highly recommend the High Tea at Sky on 57 at the other end of the building in Hotel 1. That costs $79 for 2 with bottomless tea and excellent coffee. You could just have a drink at Sky which costs you less than ticket to Skypark. Sky on 57 has outdoor access to ocean and city side views."
,,best view of singapore!,4.0,,"I visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark at night and it was amazing to see singapore at night! I loved seeing the singapore flyer at night and since it wasn't busy It was a really nice atmosphere just to look over the city. Would definitely come back at night time again too! OH and the elevator ride to the top was entertaining, but maybe this attraction is a little pricey."
,,"high,that's all",3.0,,"With SGD28 charge, you will have a plain upper deck in level 56. not worth it... okay there's a small shop selling souvenirs. So? not worth it."
,,A good view but expensive to enter,3.0,,Yes you get the iconic view of Singapore from the viewing deck but I think the ticket price to just enter a viewing deck is expensive and should be less.
,,Not Worth It,2.0,,"We paid a hefty admission price, thinking we'd have access to the roof. In fact, we were limited to a small space at one end of the roof. They did NOT make this clear before we paid. The view was very limited. I felt ripped off."
,,Top View Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"The top highlight in Singapore is the sands skypark. If do you want to have a total view of the Singapore skyline you must have to go to the skypark. You have to pay for the ticket 23,00 S$. The visitor terrace is in the front of the skypark. The rest is blocked for the hotel guests."
,,Lovely view of city,4.0,,"First of all, you need to know whether you are going to the Observation deck or Ku de ta. The former, you pay a fee of about $23 SGD and just get to go around taking pictures of the city. The latter allows you to go up for free, but then you probably have to pay for the expensive drinks and such. Unfortunately, the infinity pool is out of access, but i heard you can talk your way into there if you are already at Ku de ta and are good at that kind of stuff.

The view of the city itself is stunning. I think it's definitely better to go at night, because the lights in the city is simply beautiful. One other suggestion, which I didn't do, is going there when they have the laser show on at 8 and 9:30 pm. You can see it from the Marina bay area in general, but I would imagine it's different up there."
,,Great views,4.0,,"The view from the top is really great. You can see the city as well as the sea on the other side. It reminds me of the views from the Eiffel Tower, but Eiffel Tower and Paris have its own charm.
Try to go at a time when the sun is about to set, so that you can enjoy the view at the day time as well as the night lights."
,,Go to Ion sky instead!,3.0,,"You need to pay to see the view which I feel is a waste of money. You can get a similar view for free at Ion Sky. Ion sky is located inside Ion orchard shopping mall which is located along the shopping district of orchard. Ion sky is located on the 55 floor. You need to take a lift or escalator to Ion gallery at the 4th floor. From there, there is a direct lift which brings you to the 55th floor. Do note that Ion sky only opened from 3pm to 6pm daily.

To get to Ion Orchard, you can take mrt to orchard station. There is a understanding pass from the mrt station to Ion orchard"
,,High above the hectic Singapore streets,5.0,,"What an incredible view. Unfortunately you can only swim in the dramatic infinity pool if you're a guest, but you can still enjoy the view and drink or meal, and take in the world far above the hectic Singapore streets."
,,Good photographic vantage point!,4.0,,"I was coerced into going to the Skypark by my pushy friends: I don't like heights, and this is crzy high. It's also a bit pricey for the terror, just to get on the lower deck! The top deck is not accesible unless you are a hotel resident, but that doesn't matter very much, as the top deck is in the centre of the lower deck, and probably has more obstrcuted photography.

The view from the top is amazing, and I got some really good pictures of the whole of the city. The sort of pictures that would make good postcards. There is no where eqivalent to get such views.

The bar is the only place to sit down, but be prepared to pay. I had a glass of white wine, as cheap as they do (it was fine) for 28 dollars!!!

Glad I went, good pics, but pleased my mates paid for me."
,,Lovely at night,5.0,,Went here in the evening and saw the light show. It was a lovely atmosphere although I would have preferred heading to the restaurant. The skypark alone was a bit touristy and felt very similar to the empire state building experience which was not what I was after.
,,Stunning views.,4.0,,"Went up to the skydeck during a visit to the area, and though the views were amazing, I was disappointed, (considering what they charge), that I could not access the gardens and pool area, (restricted to guests of the hotel). Nowhere to sit either, so once you have walked around the limited perimeter, which takes about 5 minutes, unless you want to visit the small café, its back down again. Bit of a rip off particularly when they try and charge a high price for photographs!"
,,You are done after spending ten minutes up there.,3.0,,"The building looks much better from the outside. You will be greeting by many tourists just walking about that famous infinity pool and some even taking their iPad along to take photos. Hope they have steady hands. You can hardly take a photo without anyone ""destroying"" your photo. Just don't sun bath there without any sunscreen you are sure to get sun burn and that is the last thing you want to bring home from Singapore."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Great view but there's nothing really at the top and you can't go on most of it due to the hotel and pool. There's no where to sit down apart from the restaurant which is a shame. There's a small kiosk selling drinks and a few souvenirs but that really is it. You'd be better off doing the Flyer because you'll get the views but can also have a seat! Very disappointing.
,,Marina bay sandspark,5.0,,We stayed in marina bay sands hotel. We don't have to paid the entrance fee. It was fantastic view with high skyscraper and singapore city..
,,what a view!,5.0,,"Amazing experience getting to the top and seeing Singapore and even Malaysia from sky high. View is amazing and if you are there during sunrise or sunset, it will be the most amazing view and photo."
,,Partly closed renovations,1.0,,"waste of time and Money stayed in tower 2 had to change lifts then use stairs to be told that part of the skygarden closed due to Renovations,when we booked in March there was no mention of upcoming renovations planned,poor management MBS,tried to relax by pool but was unable to with power tools and jack hammers being used a few meters away.
Advice plan your trip when construction has finished or stay at the Shangri la garden wing,we did and loved it."
,,Huge!!!,5.0,,"I did not stay to the Hotel, unfortunately. The architecture is amazing, the view from the top is just unbelievable!! Don't pay you as to go to the bar, nobody oblige you to pay for a drink, if you do so you will pay a pint for the cost of the access to the skylark, fair enough!! The view at night is one of the must in Singapore!!"
,,A great view,5.0,,"Fantastic views across Singapore and the gardens by the bay. A bit expensive I think, but then it is unique."
,,What a view!!,5.0,,Glad we visited the SkyPark. Amazing view from 57th floor. Fast lifts. Amazing open swimming pool on top floor which appeared to flow right to the edge. Unfortunately only residents can use the pool.
,,You can't go to the pool,3.0,,You can't see the famous infinity pool if you're not a hotel guest.. This must be new. 23 dollars for another view point might not be worth it.. The bar in marina bay garden seems cooler and from there you can see the hotel.
,,A night view of the cityscape,5.0,,Got an opportunity to view Singapore city skyline at one of the tallest buildings in Singapore. Was there during the evening with the sun setting at the back of the city. The view was spectacular and was able to get a 360 round view on the sky garden as the hotel guest.
,,Ok,3.0,,"Hey don't get me wrong view was amazing but we were there up the top at 11:30 in the heat of the day and really wanted a beer or wine to celebrate where we were. Well no that wasn't going to happen was it because we were to early . We paid all that money to get up there and they wouldn't even let us buy a drink , very disappointed ."
,,Great hotel,4.0,,"Landmark hotel, is it worth it? Depends on how you look at it. Clean room. But when you're in it, you can not see nor enjoy the view of the boat shape hotel. Easy to find good food, attached with a mall which also helpful."
,,Go have a drink !,5.0,,"What's $40 ! Go up to the 57th floor and have a dazzling view of the city at sunset, simply spectacular. The hotel pool is amazing, the whole concept is quite stunning actually. We loved it."
,,Tourist Atrraction - what a view,4.0,,"We could see this building from all over in Singapore , so it was a must that we had to go to the top. The views are spectacular and we sat and had a drink and just watched the
skyline of Singapore. The design of the building is superb but if you are not a guest you can only peer over at the iinfinity pool"
,,The real tourist thing to see,3.0,,"It is obviously a very imposing building in the Singapore skyline, or maybe even the trademark. That being said, the view is really nice, but that is about it for me.
I'd rather sit at the Fullerton One across the water with a drink and enjoy the laser show in the evening than stand on top of the surfboard."
,,A family visit,4.0,,The quickest lift in the world probably going up to 54 floors in a matter of few seconds! When your at the top before you go out onto the great sky park and it's splendid views and scenery you get a group photo shoot. When your at the top the views are breath taking and theirs refreshments and a souvenir shop there too. I went during the evening and I recommend going in the evening as you get beautiful lights.
,,Beautiful at Dusk,5.0,,This is probably the best place to admire the cityscape of Singapore. It allows visitors to view almost the entire city skyline as well as part of the Singapore harbour. I highly recommend that visitors come at least half an hour before sundown which would allow you to see the beautiful views in daylight and then see the city transform itself into a city of lights.
,,Beautiful at sunset!,5.0,,"This is definitely worth a visit - especially if you go to watch the sunset, the buildings light up and stars appear as it goes dark. Lovely views across Singapore and out to the port."
,,Good View Above All,4.0,,"As a hotel guest I got unlimited entrance to skypark, and that's the best facility! An awesome place, has the great view from top, even tho it was gloomy at that time. I don't think it's worth the price enough to pay just to enter the skypark, so better to stay at this hotel even just one night and you'll get unlimited entrance to all faciliies. Above all I enjoy the skypark for its breathtaking view of Singapore from top."
,,A tourist attraction,4.0,,"Singapore's highlight so you have to see it. There's nothing much to see other than going to the roof and seeing the lovely view. End of the day you are only on the terrace of a building but you have been there lol! Try going in the evening and catching the view in daylight as well as when the lights come on. The view of the Garden by the Bay is fantastic from the top as well as the ocean with the ships parked in the background.
As everywhere else they try to rip you off with touristy pics for 25-30$. Take your own camera!
Walk down to the marina after that to see the laser and fountain show."
,,Cut yourself IN on a slice of heaven,5.0,,"I got in by blindly walking alongside a group of high rolling ""Paiza"" members heading for the lift up to Skypark. Sometimes not wearing your contact lenses has its rewards. I did not realize initially that you had to pay to get in. Once there, the very sexy music playing got me staying. It was around 5.30 pm. There were not as many people there for some reason. Had I brought my bikini with me or had it under my street clothes, I would surely have jumped into the deliciously inviting infinity pool. The next 2 1/2 hours was spent happily enjoying the sky high views over Singapore and people watching. High recommended."
,,Fantastic view!,5.0,,Skypark located at level 57 of the hotel. Fantastic view especially during sunset! Stayed at Marina Bay Sands as my husband's birthday celebration and he loved it as well! Will definitely return soon.
,,Excellent View,4.0,,"If you are staying at MBS itself - entrance to the Skypark is free. Otherwise you would have to pay the entrance fee. Aside from the ""infinity pool"", the view is spectacular - Being able to oversea the whole downtown area of Singapore!"
,,The views just get better the higher you go,5.0,,"What can you say.. superb. The lift up 57 storeys then the view from the top you can see forever. Pity there wasn't anywhere to sit and have a drink just an ice cream bar, which was well received."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"While some of this area is only opened to hotel guests, it's worth the visit for the view - and to see the incredible architecture of the building (3, really) from on top. It's one of my favourite buildings in the world, along with the Lotus-shaped museum nearby. Enjoy a drink on the terrace at sunset and count the ships at anchor. Great views over the gardens, too."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Felt like we were on top of the world. Very cheap, equivalent of £11.50 for an adult and £10.00 for a senior. 57 floors up, you do need a head for heights as it is Perspex all around so gives the effect of there being nothing there. Wonderful."
,,Singapore Stopover,5.0,,"Brilliant view of Singapore an amazing city. There is no time limit on your visit so it is possible to watch the sunset and Singapore light up. The viewing area has no cover so if it rains, your wet. There is a little snack shop providing ice creams and sweets and chips."
,,It was ok,3.0,,"We expected to like this a lot more than we did. It is VERY crowded but that is, of course, to be expected. It's an amazing pool on top of 3 incredible buildings. The views are spectacular and it's definitely worth seeing but it was so crowded with people that the thought of spending anytime there was simply unappealing. We were glad we saw it but would not need to go back."
,,Awesome!,5.0,,What an amazing building and view. There are restrictions of visiting the deck as the pool is for hotel guests but you can visit the sky deck and we also had cocktails at one of the bars another night. Visited Feb 2011.
,,spectacular city by the bay lights,4.0,,"its the highllight of seeing Singapore at night. The Marina Bay reveals a one of a kind structure in Asia. Its a well planned building that amazes tourist like me and makes me think that noah's ark is on top of the building. Only, the climate is too hot in Singapore and more restaurants should be available not only kiosk but cool restos and stores as well."
,,MISSING TREES AT SKY PARK.,4.0,,It is great property and no question about it. But Especially People are thrilled by the Sky Park concept. Guest Enjoys Swimming pool which is called Infinity Pool. There are restaurant at the top which serves good food and beverages. But unfortunately Park is missed because there is lot of renovation going on. And you will only see Swimming pool and no park. Observation desk is small and tiny compared to guest they occupy.
,,Amazing View!!,4.0,,The skypark provides an amazing 180 degree view of the beautiful city. Its great fun to be in the super speed elevator.
,,breathtaking views atop this skypark,5.0,,"love everything about this place,,,,,,!! do visit during twilight time - sunset and u will not be disappointed."
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Skypark provides stunning views of the city over Marina Bay. It also looks over The Gardens By The Bay and out to the ocean beyond. You pay around $20 SGD to go up but it will not give you access to the infinity pool. There is also a restaurant at the Skypark.
,,Most expensive cocktail ever!,3.0,,"The bar/restaurant is one way to enjoy the stunning views (vs. paying to access the viewing terrace), but beware that cocktails will cost S$28 and a beer S$20! I guess that makes the drinks reasonable if you look at the viewing terrace admission fee. Staff were a bit on the surly side, and chased us away from sheltered tables at the edge on the basis that they were reserved - an our later no-one had turned up, so I think the staff were being a bit over the top."
,,Only on sunny days!,5.0,,What a great view across the city whether it's day or night! Just be careful if clouds gather as the rain will certainly drench you if you cannot find any cover! Getting to the place via the shopping underpass is cool and though pricey you just have to pay it and enjoy the view! Enjoy a cocktail or a meal and take in the view if the wind stays calm. You can choose indoor or out but hotel guests get to see the other end of the city clearer across from the poolside. The outdoor heat can be a bit intensive so maybe choose dust time for a visit as the city wakes up for the night life as well.
,,Good place for a drink,5.0,,Go here for dinner or drinks and you can even bring your bathing suite and go for a swim with the most amazing view.
,,Hope this is Asia's biggest Cassino,5.0,,Enjoyed alot Beautiful hotel and Cassino ... Amazing view from the top .Yoc can see Malasia in your eyes ..
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"Great view and nice spacious area with glass walls. Lot of space and time to take pictures of Singapore. Maybe could wait until the night falls because I didn't see anything to take us out or any time limit on my ticket.

Got the ticket from the travel agent with lower price and avoided the queu at the ticket counter.

However the down side was long queu to get into the lift to go up and down. Also the main entrance was not easy to find."
,,Great 270 degree view of Singpore,4.0,,"This is a great spot for taking panoramic pictures- no glass and no reflection. There is a fee, $28SGD, to visit and will only allow access to observation deck- restaurant visit is extra, $20 SGD. The infinity pool is reserved for hotel guess only.
Great place to escape from the traffic noise."
,,Sky park,5.0,,"Amazing place to be. Had a really nice time. Specially the barman 🍹🍸, Vincent amazing man. A must visit 👍👍. Never had mojito like this before. A remarkable experience. Cheers !!"
,,Get up high,4.0,,"It's a good way to see the city sprawled out in front of you, you get a idea of the scale of the city and the sprawling metropolis that it is. The observation deck is surrounded by glass which can be a little unnerving if you are a bit dubious about heights. All around the deck they have maps so you know where you are looking. There is no cover on the deck and we went of a hot clear day so be warned and cover up if you are prone to burning."
,,Skip the viewing platform,3.0,,"Buy a drink at the bar so you can get the view AND a drink. The drink is pretty much the same price as the tickets to the observation deck, so it’s exorbitant for just a drink, but you get the view and a drink for the same price. Said bar isn’t on the viewing platform, so maybe the views are a little better on the viewing platform (it’s about 5 meters below the bar), but probably not by much."
,,Spectacular,4.0,,"Resorts in Las Vegas are stunning but this has to be one of the best hotels in the world. Fantastic views from the top deck where the swimming pool for residents is located.

For non-guest you either pay to go to the top or go via the bars free of charge. The bar option is not too bad as the drinks are reasonably priced."
,,Top of the World,4.0,,Fabulous! Worth the money to stay there just to swim here! Really loved to have a fresh juice here in the morning and a bit of a swim! Only saw one roaming photographer there on both of our swims so that was disappointing however we managed to get a fellow hotel guest to take some photos of us on the edge! All in All definitely worth a visit! :)
,,Must see,5.0,,Expensive but it's worth it needed to spend more time but only had one day to see all of Singapore next time I would like to stay at the Marina Bay Sands to swim in the best Infinity Pool I've ever seen
,,Fancy Shmancy,4.0,,"Once you walk inside Marina bay Sands Hotel you know that it is a fancy hotel. It is huge inside! I think that they charge too much for their Skypark but I think that it is worth it.
Views from their deck are amazing. Pool and restaurants are juts for guests so regular visitors can only look at it from far away.
It is super hot there so bring a hat or an umbrella."
,,Fascinating Views,4.0,,"The late evening visit to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark on the 57th floor was a part of our tour programme with RMG tour operators. The visit was well worth the time and effort, despite the long queues over the holiday weekend. The number of visitors on top at any given time is regulated so that there is no sense of crowding on top, which is a good thing.
The views that one gets of the cityscape by night are indeed fascinating.
Just avoid weekends and holidays for this visit and you will enjoy it."
,,Great view!,5.0,,The floor beneath is larger in size so I didn't experience vertigo as could be expected. Nice bar with good service! Not crowded at all.
,,Nice views but expensive,4.0,,"The skypark has some nice views of the city, unfortunately when I went the rain clouds were closing in so perhaps not as panoramic as you would get on a clear day. I think going up at night would be better as Singapore lit up looks tremendous.

The cost is $23, maybe a bit expensive just to take in some views, but you will get to take some nice photos."
,,Very nice,4.0,,"There is a fee for this attraction. We ordered drinks, they were ages coming and then they warm when we ordered a cold drink. It was a bit overcast when we went up to the Skypark so the views were not great. Choose a good clear day to visit"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"This is a must do for travelers! Fantastic views over singapore.
Best view is upon sunset so you get the best of both worlds by seeing it by day then by night! If you stay up there long enough you can see the light show from gardens by the bay next door."
,,what a view :),5.0,,"from the lounge chairs in the pool to the service received from the bar, you must check this out helpful service, great views especially at nighttime"
,,Excellent hotel and amazing view from skypark,5.0,,The hotel is excellent and view from Marina Bay sand skypark is amazing. You should go to the skypark in the evening so that you can view singapore with lights
,,Amazing,5.0,,"My daughters and grand-daughters loved the pool and club lounge. They swam all hours, from dawn to dusk we always had plenty of room. The staff were very caring and attentive. We loved the whole experience, we will be back."
,,Watta View!,5.0,,"The view from the 57th floor, is mind blowing. it feels like the deck of a ship, and the singapore skyline from that level, is beyond words! worth every dollar paid to get on top. Can get crowded on weekends, delaying your entry and exit, otherwise, quite a wonderful place!!"
,,evening view breathtaking,5.0,,"Seriously, this is a must do! Aim for a weekday evening, after dark, and bask in the urban gleam below."
,,Fun with Friends,4.0,,"Good place to hang out in. Find a good spot, sit down and talk with your friends. On the horizon, a bird's eye view of Singapore.
A little pricey, at $23 a pop. However, if it's your first time in the city, this is an obligatory tourist destination.
Don't fall for the photo scam unless your pocket is overflowing with cash. It's easy enough to Photoshop yourself in front of MBS.
Sad that you can only access 1/4 of the whole deck. As I recall, it was much more than this before. All in all, pretty decent.
Refreshing atmosphere, good view, great friends. You can't ask for anything more."
,,Try Ku De Ta,4.0,,"Rumour has it you can't go up to the sky deck unless you pay but, if your timing is right you can go to Ku De Ta and have a cocktail for the price of entry to the sky deck. We did. We also spent...More"
,,Spectacular Views at $23 per entry,4.0,,$23 got you to the 54th floor where one had a panoramic bird's eye view of the entire city. We watched a grand sunset from here on our final night in Singapore
,,Beautiful view of the city,5.0,,Great place to spend a lovely evening with family and friends. Amazing view of the city and great cocktails. Best to visit in the night and the orchid garden looks beautiful from top in the night with all the lights lit up. If you are...More
,,Wow,5.0,,"This is a must. Not only you will be impressed by the hotel, but the view will take your breath away! It's a S$28 ride to the top of the Marina Bay Hotel, but it's worth every cent! Make sure you have plenty of suntan...More"
,,Great view,4.0,,Terrific view although I would have liked more info about what you could see. I would have also liked to be able to buy a coffee and snack but the restaurant is closed off from the Skypark. Q1 on the Gold Coast has a cafe...More
,,Enjoyed the cable trip with family,5.0,,"We booked on spot and traveled both ways using cable. Excellent staff, awesome view and very worth visiting . Price of tickets were felt too high. But we did not have time to look for any shopper deal. Singapore stopover holiday deal did not work...More"
,,Get to see Singapore from a very good viewpoint at the top of MBS,4.0,,"From the Skypark, you will get a glimpse of Singapore from the top. It is a great place to take wonderful photos, having a huge viewing deck. There is also a restaurant and a snack bar available at the Skypark."
,,Higher than the Flyer,5.0,,"It's worth the visit! Jus to experience the thrill of being way up high in e sky! Best to visit at nite, so u can have a drink or two up there wile soaking in the nite sights! Suggest do the flyer (giant wheel) by...More"

,,If you do one thing,5.0,,"Do this, unbelievable views, check the weather patterns first, you are some 56+stories up. And yes to have those beautiful gardens it does rain."
,,Live like a rich just a moment,5.0,,"Amazing view, an architectural beauty, and a really classy bar and swimming pool. You just feel like a rich for few minutes."
,,Great View,4.0,,Great views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands skydeck.Cost $30 Australian dollars I'm pretty sure. Bit costy but for rare views like this it was worth it.
,,Would do this over Singapore Flyer,4.0,,"If you are going to do the flyer, you don't need to do this. Same view. Personally I preferred this to the flyer.
View is amazing in all directions. With the glass fences blocking any breeze it does get extremely hot (mid day was oppressively hot) so maybe time your visit for the cooler part of the day."
,,great views,4.0,,Amazing structure worth the cost of admission just to have a look from the top. Good opportunity to see the bay gardens from a higher view
,,Wow,5.0,,"A bit pricey for an observation deck, but once you are up there, the view is worth the price! The area is small as the 3/4 of the deck is for hotel guests only, however it's the best way to see the city."
,,must visit..stunning views,5.0,,"absolute visit just even to see the hotel, the way it is built and even better if you can go up to the viewing gallery. Stunning city views not to be missed."
,,Unique viewing experience!,4.0,,"Some may say this is a silly tourist trap but I say you have to go check this out! The hotel itself is an architectural marvel and the ""ship"" rooftop is so unique! The view from the top is amazing and worth your time."
,,the high sky ;),4.0,,"What an astonishing perspective. You can see such an extensive amount Singapore from here. I was debating between setting off up to the sky stop or riding in the wheel over the waterway. I am happy I picked this. It's a decent cost and much higher than the wheel.

I just wish there was access to the eatery. It would have been pleasant to take a seat and appreciate the perspective with a supper or beverage."
,,Once and done tourist stop .. maybe,4.0,,"It is kind of hard to rate this. If you are into views, it is 5 stars. If you are not into overpriced sights that tourist must see, it will be a star or two. It is pricey but it is a tourist sight. No, you will not see the infinity pool unless you are staying at the hotel. You will get the same spectacular sights of whole city. I am glad I did it. I am not sure if I would do it again. Skip the overpriced photo they try and sell you."
,,A view not to be missed!,5.0,,An excellent way to get an overview of Singapore. Well worth the money and an unforgettable experience.
,,Absolutely amazing view,5.0,,"The Skypark is a must-do when visiting Singapore! We got there 45 minutes before dawn. So we could see the whole skyline at daytime, during dawn and at nighttime. On the other side of the Skypark you can see the harbour of Singapore and the Gardens by the Bay.

To get to the elevators, you go through the hotel - which is a stunning and chic hotel.

The SGD 23 / adult were worth the experience."
,,visit to sky viewing platform,4.0,,"wow, great view, but not on all of the sky platform, , thats reserved for hotel guests, a nice cold beer was well served in the bar, the staff were attentive and made us welcome well recommended, 1-2 hours maximum"
,,Worth it for the view,4.0,,"The price is a little steep for what is essentially an elevator trip - the elevator itself took us 15 minutes to find after wandering around people wearing outfits that most likely cost more than our entire trip. However we were lucky enough to go on one of the rare Singaporean days where the weather was actually sunny and clear. The view is gorgeous and it certainly helps get your head around the actual size and layout of the city. You also get to experience the realisation that you will never be wealthy enough to stay in the hotel, and your girlfriend complaining that she should have left you for the wealthy American businessman that checked her out in the lobby. I give it a 4/5."
,,really good view of singapore,5.0,,"skip the flyer, skip the merlion. come straight to the skypark and enjoy the view of singapore at 67 floors. please remember to check the weather forecast for nice clear day."
,,okay,3.0,,"well, its a nice to see kinda place...view is amazing but that's about it.. the infinity pool looks crazy good! but that's only for guests sooooo..."
,,The top of Singapore,5.0,,"For an entrance of $23, you may opt to stay as long as you want on the deck and even wait for sunset if you wish to. The breathtaking view of Singapore never fail to amazed me. Went there around 5.30pm and chilled around till sunset. However it rained thereafter. I would say sunset view is by far the best compared to night view. Then again it's personal preference. Good thing I brought some food and drinks so that i could do a mini camp there. There are ice creams and finger foods for purchase there, as well as a bar if you wish to chill there.
Tips: There are only limited tickets sold in a day. Early booking can be done via their website however at your own risk due to the uncertainty in weather. We purchase our tickets on the spot (good thing tickets are still available)."
,,Nice views but not amazing.,3.0,,"The views from the top were nice but not spectacular. The entry fee was expensive for what we got on the night. I had been warned by locals and friends about the all hypes. Since we had a very low expectation of the whole experience before hand, we did enjoy the night and the lovely weather.

I would have prefer taking a stroll along the harbour of Marina Bay!"
,,You cannot miss this if you come ti Singapore,5.0,,"The views are just fantastic and can help you understanding in minutes the layout of Singapore.
We didn't like though that after paying for the entrance, once upstairs yoy are not allowed to enter the lounge eventhough we were willing to spend whatever asked for a drink and a light meal.
Don't miss the lobby which is as spectacular as the Skypark."
,,Getting old but views to die for,4.0,,Catch lift to Re De Ru on 57th floor - no need to pay and order a drink and take a table on the lounge deck and take in the views
,,Scintillating views...,4.0,,"The skypark at Marina Bay Sands offers breath-taking views of the skyline and is a place not to be missed when you are on a trip to Singapore. One can have an view of Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore Flyer and some more attractions near by from the top. The water surrounding this structure just adds to the beauty."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark offers the best view of Singapore. Come by dawn and you get to witness the sun going down with all those red orange black colors you've been craving to see your entire life. At night, the lit up Singapore looks mindblowing."
,,The Views!,4.0,,Great views!! We had lunch and cocktails at Marina Bay Sands level 57. That way we didnt have to pay seperately to look at the view. You do need to book and be aware that it all depends on the weather!
,,Great views. Drinks are expensive,4.0,,Level 57. For drinks be prepared to pay for coffee at S$10.00 a cup. But the view is amazing. To stand back and look at this building from our hotel. It is so odd looking and when you get up close it is something from the future. Worth a look. Amazing
,,Fantastic building and amazing views!,5.0,,I loved this hotel and visit to the rooftop. Fantastic views and an incredible building. Having seen it from the Singapore Flyer I had to go and it was well worth it. Beautiful views over the bay.
,,"If you don't come here, you're missing out",5.0,,"It's literally one of the most spectacular views I've ever seen. I've been to the Sears Tower and other sky rises, this will blow your mind.

Enjoy a drink and lunch at the top while marveling at this magnificent city. Trust me your wont regret it."
,,360 Degree Views,5.0,,This is a wonderful place to get superb views of the Singapore City and Marina Bay area skylines. Time your time with the photo taking its well the visit.
,,Marina bay Singapore,5.0,,"It's an amazing place. In the morning, the view is so great but i love to see it at night. If you come here in the evening around 9pm, you will witness a 'water' performance, that was touched my heart. It's the unforgetable image in my mind even now i am not there anymore"
,,Amazing Place - on top of it all,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is amazing by itself, but the Skypark on top of the hotel is out of this world. You have a view of everything in Singapore from this one place and the atmosphere is great. A great place to get your bearings while in Singapore."
,,"Good view, average experience",3.0,,"The view from the top is good and it is worth seeing although you only get access to the platform at the ""bow"" of the boat, not the whole boat. The actual building seen from below is probably just as impressive. You need to enter near the building at the ""bow"" of the boat. They will try to sell you a picture of yourselves superimposed using a green screen. This was outrageously priced and they are clearly used to people refusing it."
,,See Singapore At Night,4.0,,Nice view at night although full of tourists. Tourists can also have a peek at the infinity pool. Recommend to visit the Garden by the Bay after seeing the Skypark since it is just near the vicinity.
,,Great place to check out,4.0,,This is a luxury hotel which is huge and well worth looking around. There's lots of shops and restaurants which can be explored as well as the gardens by the bay which are linked. Great to go see during the day for the view as well as during the evening when everything is lit up. Recommended
,,Great Views But A Lot Of Hype,4.0,,There are many places in the world now offering those 'wow' cityscapes from tall buildings. Of course the view from the top of Marina Bay Sands does not disappoint but most of the roof top and the swimming pool area is now closed to outside visitors. Maybe more should be offered for the price you pay to take the express elevators to the top?
,,Simply awesome. Best view of Singapore,5.0,,You must visit the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands. The view is spectacular. Facilities are very clean. Put this #1 on your trip to Singapore.
,,Awesome View of Singapore,5.0,,Skypark is a must see place in singapore..You will get a view of singapore from 57th level which is awesome...
,,Wow,4.0,,A must see and do if stopping over in Singapore or staying for a few days. An amazing piece of structural work and the views are amazing.
,,"""Weeeeeell""",3.0,,"As part of an evening tour it is just a money making venture; you cannot read the descriptive plaques outside so while you can see lights in the distance you don't know what they are nor where you are looking at. Far too expensive for what you get and then there are the damn photo peddlers, just like on a cruise liner!!
When compared to the Needle at Seattle which is cheaper and then you do not pay if you have a meal, this is a rip-off.
The light and sound show that is accessed after the Skypark is freely available and so isn't worth the cost associated with the tour.
I would suggest a visit to the Skypark during the late afternoon so you can see what you are looking at, then have a meal (if the Skypark cost is refunded) then look at the lights after the meal knowing what you are looking at. Finally take in the, now, free Light & Music Show"
,,A must see for families here...,4.0,,"A really nice thing for a weekend to do - far in the west of Singapore and not really easy to reach - with bus and MRT or a Taxi. A nice park, lots to see and explore for adults as well as kids. Well worth a visit!"
,,very nice and something really want to try.,5.0,,We did reservation for two wanted to have dinner up on 57th floor. it's kind of expensive but one time won't hurt. we loved it with 7 different course. enjoyed the view.
,,An architectural marvel,5.0,,"It's expensive to get to the top, however the views over The city in one direction and the Singapore Straits in the other will allow for some superb photos. There's a viewing platform at the top, however you can't access the infinity pool at the top unless you a guest staying in the Marina Sands Hotel. There's no building any where on earth like this!"
,,Don't miss this when in Singapore,4.0,,56 floor building with a boat top structure..awesome architecture. The infinity pool is a special attraction. You can't afford to miss this destination.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,Great view from the 56th floor. You can see for miles.Well worth the money. ($23sgd) to take the lift to the top.Fantastic bar for drinks & eats.
,,Incredible views but overpriced,3.0,,"Aside from the incredible view of the city, the architecture of the structure is an amazing view by itself. Admission fees seem a tad unnecessary as you'll only be allowed on to a small observation deck. It can get quite windy up there so hold on tight to your hats and other loose items!"
,,Great view but you shoul know........,4.0,,"I have been at the 56 floor where you pay 23 dollars to admire the view of Singapore 360 degree, however, if you go one floor up you can have a similar nice view from the sky bar where for a beer you will pay 23 dollars."
,,Go in night,5.0,,Try this attraction on night. We went there around 6.45 and stayed until 8.00 PM it was nice. Light show is visble as well as laser show from Marina Bay hotel to nearby river. Awesome scenories - I cannot resist myself - You just forget everything.
,,Bird's Eye Views,5.0,,"Follow the signs in the Marina Bay Mall and you will go on a walkway over the road and into The Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Walk down to Tower 3, which is the one nearest the Singapore Flyer. Go outside the door and downstairs to purchase your ticket to the Skypark. $23 adults $20 seniors. The elevator goes up 56 floors to the top. Amazing views all around, though visitors only get to be at the point of this ""boat"" structure. The rest of the Skypark area is for hotel guests only. I was a little disappointed at not being able to see the infinity pool, but can understand it's only for paying guests of the hotel . It is a beautiful birds eye view of Singapore in all directions and well worth the money."
,,Observation Deck SGD$23 entry fee each...too high,3.0,,"If we had attempted to ge here at the end of the trip we wouldn't have gone up.
But it was at the start of our trip and we decided to go. Could have just sent one person up for a quick look and a couple of photos. Postcards even. But I suppose its all about the experience. Been there..done that. Don't have to do it again."
,,Sky hig,4.0,,A delight to see we arrived on the hop on off bus such an incredible sight we had cocktails in the bar and enjoyed the view with overlooked the bay and the wonderful gardens
,,Nice views but pricey,3.0,,"Was S$23 to get on to the observation deck which was crowded with people sitting along the edges and taking up space. Waiting time for elevator was also quite long. Entering the deck we were confronted with a photo booth attendant requesting S$55 for souvenir prints which were of average quality. One of those ""touristy"" things to tick off your bucket list. The views were great when you could squeeze into a good spot though."
,,Lunch with my daughter,5.0,,"My daughter lives in Singapore and I visiter her and for a trat we had lunch at the top. The views were wonderful, food divine. The lift just gets to the top without yoy even noticing"
,,"Must visit, the view is amazing",5.0,,"Even if you don't stay at Marina Bay you need to visit. The view from the top is simply spectacular especially if viewing at night.

When I think back to the holiday and talk with friends the infinity pool and views is one of first thoughts."
,,Not Worth the Money,2.0,,"Despite the advertisements that make it look like you can access the park, you cannot unless you are a hotel guest. The $23 SGD fee gets you access to a small observation deck only. It's simply not worth it."
,,Great nice view but nothing extraordinary..,3.0,,"We had the opportunity to go up the skypark free as guests of the hotel. But nothing extraordinary though. In most major cities, you get similar buildings which gives you a great view of the city.

The view as expected is great, especially on a clear day. Being right on top there gives a nice feeling too. The pool is nice especially with the end of it near the edge.

Its a nice experience to be here but frankly, if you have to pay to come up here ( for non hotel guests), then it is not worth it."
,,"Over-rated if you are not a hotel-guest, better views at other locations",3.0,,"This one is very over-rated. For 23 SGD (for non-hotel staying folks), you only get access to one of the 3 buildings. Obviously the swimming pool is out of bounds(which is expected), but you can probably get better views from 1-Altitude!"
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"This is an amazing place to visit! The views are fabulous and you can have a meal or drink on the 57th floor, enjoying it all!"
,,Marina Bay Sands is a must stay hotel,5.0,,"if only for the Infinity pool you must stay at Marina Bay Sands. The pool is everything the pictures show and its reputation truly is deserved.

Besides that the hotel, the staff and all elements of our staff were first class. I would highly recommend this hotel (and make sure you spend lots of time by/in the infinity pool)"
,,Magnificent View !!!,5.0,,The view is so spectacular ...When you come to singapore you must see and try by yourself...Really Awesome!!!
,,Great view. Possibly over priced.,3.0,,"If views are your thing, this is a must. You can see a lot of the major land marks in SG and I enjoyed it but I would have expected to pay a little less."
,,Not for families,2.0,,For $80 I was hoping for some shade or somewhere to sit down but they only let you go at one end of it and there is no where to rest! My kids were hot and bored within 5 minutes so I think we managed to make it last 15 minutes before we had to leave. I should have gone to the giant Ferris wheel instead. Maybe if no kids this would be good or older kids.
,,Better views elsewhere,3.0,,"We visited with out 10 month old son. In typical fashion the heavens opened and poured rain within minutes of our arrival at level 56. The rain wasn't so much of an issue though. The views were indeed good but I feel the Singapore skyline is better with Marina Bay Sands in it rather than from it. There was some information about buildings in the area but I was left wondering what many others were. Also there was an extremely pushy sales person attempting to sell me an overpriced, terrible photo of us photoshopped onto the skyline with my head half cut off. It was better having a meal at Level33 and enjoying the view from there"
,,This is one of world's most amazing construction marvel,4.0,,We went up at night and the view was spectacular. Best view of Singapore here while swimming with people from around the world. Just amazing!
,,Great View!,4.0,,"As I was staying in Marina Bay Sands, I took the opportunity to access to the skypark free of charge. The views there are espectacular. My favourite spots are the one facing the sea with all those ships patiently waiting and, of course, the view of the skyscrapers."
,,A must for visitors to Singapore!,5.0,,The view from the Skypark is spectacular! You can enjoy quiet time while sipping a drink at the lounge or walking on the deck below. Please note men need to wear long pants to access the lounge. It's an expensive trip up to the Skypark!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,One of the most beautiful piece of architecture one can ever see. The view from up there is something which can take your breath away.
,,Go for the view... and that's it.,3.0,,"Only having access to the non-guest section, you only get a small portion of the skypark to visit. While the space is not large, the view of the harbour is spectacular. But if you're looking for something else, look elsewhere. Be prepared for the wind up there, it can be quite strong.

As others have mentioned, the entrance is a bit of a challenge to find (you have to exit the hotel, go around a corner and down a set of stairs)."
,,Go there few minutes before sunset,5.0,,"Great to see the sunset, you will see two different Singapore and take wonderful photos and selfies ;)"
,,Excellent view of city,5.0,,"U can find good view of singapore...u can find swimming pool at the top of the building, u can find 3 building connected...its a good experience."
,,Spectacular view!,5.0,,This is at the height of 60 something floor. An amazing view of the entire city and also the sea around. The buildings look tiny at the great height. Also the pool is at a place which is sky touching. The view sets in the eyes for the lifetime.
,,Amazing,5.0,,The view at the top is just amazing 60 floors up costs $23.00 to go up and if you have a beer $18.00
,,On cloud nine,5.0,,"It is bit difficult to locate if you are in bit hurry as the lobby area of Marina bay Sand is very huge, I suggest better ask for assistance as soon as you enter the hotel lobby. The skypark sky deck gives you breath taking glimpse of Singapore. The ticket is approx. SGD 45 per adult. There is one cafe a top where in you can enjoy refreshments watching the sun set or glittering singapore skyline or beautiful garden by the bay"
,,Astonishing view,4.0,,"We succeded to be there when it was very few people and had the whole area for our self almost. We also managed to get over to the pool area (not so observant security!! hehe, and had a beer there. But the price was 25 $ for the pint!. Guess that´s a record? Incredible view anyway to see people swimming around a few inches from the edge of the building with 59 floors down. Must recommend it.entre fee was 20 $. but it was worth it"
,,Great to watch the sunset,5.0,,"Firstly, NO! You cannot go in the swimming pool just from visiting the Sky Park. Only hotel guests can access the main pool area of the roof.

The Sky Park gives you access to one end of the 'Boat' shaped roof of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

The organisation of the staff at the lobby were great and it was straight forward to pay the fee, around 30 Singapore dollars or so per person, and then we were in the lift.

Stepping out into the Sky Park was quite the experience. You can see all of what Singapore has to offer! From the huge Wheel to the F1 track, the packed sky scrapers and the many trees.

You can access an upper level and from here you can see the pool area slightly, and very enviously!!

There's a gift shop and a bar here also.

You can stay in the Sky Park as long as you like and there is free wifi."
,,Best tourist activity in Singapore - Amazing Views,5.0,,Don't miss the views from this observation platform. I went at night and the lights of the city were so beautiful.
,,good place to see singapore from,4.0,,higher than the flyer.... good view of singapore all around... maximum time spent would be 30 min... try to go late evenin to enjoy the sunset...
,,Must be the thin air that is causing it...,3.0,,One of the landmarks of Singapore.. Impressive building.. Spectacular birds eye view.. Average food/drinks quality.. But.. Terrible service.. Waiters moving as if in a slow motion film..One wonders if it is the thin air lack of oxygen at that height...
,,$$$$$,3.0,,"Great view, but you can't access much of the sky deck if you're not staying there. We thought we would pop in and have a drink. A pint of Stella was S$20!"
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,We visited here on our recent stay in Singapore. We actually went to the top 57th floor for which there is no charge unlike the Skypark. However we had 2 pints of Stella up there and it was 47 Singapore dollars nearly £25. The views were absolutely breathtaking so we didn't care about the price of the beer. Would we go up again.... you bet and have a beer.
,,Amazing building.,3.0,,"A wonder to look at but I am not sure it is worth the cost to go up for a family. No shade, shelter or seats on the deck and very little to keep children occupied."
,,Clean underware please,5.0,,"You have to try this if you have a head for heights!. I haven't but providing I kept away from the edge, the views were fantastic. You are on the bow of the ship, so overhanging the towers!!."
,,Best place in the city to see and swim!!,5.0,,"The top of the hotel lookout is free for hotel guests but $23 per person if not staying in the hotel. The infinity pool is breathtaking, and totally worth the cost of a room ($288 + tax on agora) to use this cool facility!! Don't waste money eating up top, you will be horrified at the cost ($68-150 per plate!), rather eat at the Marina Bay shopping mall food court!! There is a nice and inexpensive (by Marina Bay standards) convenience store at the food court level to buy fresh fruit, sandwiches, etc for breakfast. Must see when visiting this city!! Most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in!!"
,,The best view in Singapore,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino was opened in June 2010 as the most expensive building of its kind - reputedly around S$8Bn! And it feels like it.
Topping the three towers is the amazing Sky Park with the world's most stunning infinity pool. At this point, I need to caution that the public can only access one end of the Sky Park - the bit that's cantilevered out over the Northern end of the structure. The rest is reserved for hotel guests.
It costs S$23 to go up to the observation deck and its worth every penny. The view out over the Marina Bay, Singapore River and the south coast is staggering.
If you're new to Singapore I'd recommend this as a 'first attraction' just because it's an awesome way to orientate yourself."
,,Excellent Views of City,4.0,,Excellent views of the city this one is a fast ride.You would see everyone and people from every walk of life around Marina Bay Sands Skypark.The hotel is a good stay.
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5.0,,One of the best places to visit and relax on top of the world. Beautiful view of Singapore and the in house swimming pool of the hotel- just a view up close/ One can relax at the skypark while munching on snacks and cold beer
,,Worth it for the view,3.0,,"We had been told that the public could access the rooftop pool, which has since changed - we were not allowed to swim. It was S$23 per adult to go up, to a very restricted area of the upper deck. You can however, stay for as long as you want, but can only go up once on the ticket for that day.
The view was amazing however, so we were willing to pay for the experience. It was a bit crowded though."
,,THE Address for great view of Singapore!,5.0,,"This huge surfboard-shaped platform is divided into 2 areas, the public area (which you can access from the gound floor after puchasing entry ticket) and the area for hotel guests (including the pool. You can't swim there unless you have a room at the Marina Bay Sands hotel). By the way, you entry ticket entitles you for 1 photo at the studio on the Skypark level.
Even the public area is more than sufficient to enjoy the amazing view of part of Singapore and the Marina Bay area. A great place to take a video while walking along the edge. Take panorama pictures! The skypark also has a bar. Better to go there after 4pm so it is cooler and you don't get sunburn. I believe the evening view must breathtaking.
Dislike: on the skypark there is a exclusive restaurant. The menu is limited, the taste is OK (not great), but the price is shocking.
The photo is in a studio, they will photoshop you with the MBS in the background. I wished they take your photo outdoor."
,,This is when an infinity edge on a pool really pays off,4.0,,"Laying on the edge of the pool looking back at the CBD of Singapore is an amazing experience and a must do for anyone no matter what age you are. I was there for business but people who are visiting Singapore can come for the day. The pool is divided into two sections Hotel guests, which I was, and paying public. The former was relatively uncrowded. The later full, loud and wasn't a lot of places to sit."
,,Singapore,4.0,,"It get to see some amazing views of Singapore, we went just on dust so we could see it during the day and then at night. its well worth doing once."
,,Best view of the Harbour,5.0,,Loved the view! We did it in the 'Night out tour' so the cost of entry up was included in the tour! Amazing views and the best way to make plans if you've just arrived and to see all the major attractions around the Bay
,,an amazing building - and a wonderful view,4.0,,This is a remarkably gorgeous building both inside and out. The sky park is overpriced but does offer a great view
,,View Singapore,4.0,,"Great place to see over the city and bay area but overpriced for the attraction. It would be a good idea if the authorities concerned included something else in the price of the ticket - drinks, snack, etc."
,,Try Sky Bar as an alternative to S$23 panoramic deck,3.0,,"In Singapore, most of the roof top bars will charge you some 10-20S$ coverage, just to get in. The roof top bars are also usually the most expensive, with drink prices btw 15-35S$. To our surprise, there was no cover or elevator charge to Marina Bay Sands' Sky Bar. You only have to find the right elevator that will take you up there. With the ticket given as you enter the elevator, you'll get access to the tiny bar area, that can be extremely crowded for obvious reasons. The drink prices are also sky high, but never mind, if the queues are too long, just enjoy the views and go back down. There is no drink minimum. If you like what you see, you can always buy the tickets to the observation deck afterwards."
,,So So,3.0,,"The view is great but the price tag to go up is too much for what you get. The building is better to ""look at"" rather than ""look from"""
,,Amazing Structure and Pool and Friendly Staff,5.0,,This is my favorite place in Singapore where I can chill in the pool located at the top of the building. We really love our stay here and we love the room location because we can view the Park which has very nice things to see.
,,Bird's Eye View,5.0,,"The view is absolutely amazing from the Sky bar. We had lunch and oh what a view! It was difficult to eat, I was so enthrilled with the ships coming in to load and unload their cargo containers. It is definatley worth the trip."
,,Amazing view if it's not raining!,5.0,,"Enjoyed a trip up to see the famous infinity pool at the Marina Sands Hotel, it looked a bit like Butlins at 600' to me though! It costs approx £12 to go to the top. There is a gift shop where you can buy postcards and other items. You can have a drink at the bar but it looked like rain so we did not bother. If it is raining there are only a few areas you can shelter so I would try and go when it is dry and sunny for the best view. Once you are at the top you can stay up there as long as you like but 1 hr would be plenty."
,,Top of the World.,4.0,,"Just such an amazing feat of architecture. when viewed from afar, just makes you want to experience the views from the top. Combined this with lunch as we did and you will not be sorry you did so. Just fab."
,,Total rip off. Poor value,1.0,,"We arrived and discovered it was closed for a private function. Came back the following day, paid $20 and $23 entrance. (Seniors get a reduction) had the obligatory photograph taken and went up in the elevator. Immediately harassed to buy said photo for $35. Out into the high humidity and sun, took standard photos, went to try and get a coffee, seat and some shade. Fail. Restaurant closed till midday. Small kiosk selling tourist tat and drinks but nowhere to sit. And no shade. After 20 minutes we headed back down to the hotel lobby. It's like a shopping mall with less atmosphere. Small coffee shop has no comfortable seating. What a huge waste of money. Just hope my photographs are brilliant! Spend your money on the Flyer. At least you can sit down in the cool."
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,"Marina Bay is very nearby Singapore Flyer. The view from Marina is almost similar to Flyer, only difference being Marina is at a bit higher altitude."
,,Up to the 57th floor!,5.0,,Great view across the Gardens by the Bay and back towards the city - book early and you might get in for afternoon tea.
,,View from Observation Deck,5.0,,We went to the Marina sands and initially booked the tickets before our trip. The views are exceptional from the observation area. This is a must for photographs. You can see the roof top pool but this is only for guests. There is also a big mall below and you can easily spend a good morning looking around the place.
,,Stunning views,3.0,,"Stunning views over Singapore, especially at night. Non guests are allowed in bars but not pool area, which did look amazing through the Perspex. I think we may stay next time just to use the pool."
,,Go to KuDéTa instead!,3.0,,"You have to pay for the Skypark, and the KuDéTa lounge has the same view and cost you a drink. The drinks are as pricey as the entrance fee for the skypark, but a least you got something for it in return."
,,Completely by accident,4.0,,"Funnily enough we were in another shopping complex, where we somehow managed to get to a park on the roof (which we later found out, we shouldn't have been able to access), this is where we saw 'the ship on the buildings'. ""What on earth is that"", we asked some local lads....they proceeded to tell us about Marina Bay Sands Resort etc, and how to get to the deck for free!!.
So off we went on our merry way to find it and have a look.
The key to get to the top for free....is just to pretend that you belong, and you know where you are going...so up the elevator we went, like two little giggling girls. (once you are around the 50 yr mark, you can giggle if you want to!!).
AMAZING views. You do have to pay if you want to get into the pool area, which we didn't need to do, but we did go to one of the rooftop bars and pay a fortune for a whiskey. I believe we are now the world record holders for the longest time to sip a whiskey!!.
Anyway, I have to recommend checking this out, the views from the top of Marina Bay Sands are phenomenal!!"
,,Beautiful and stately,4.0,,This is a landmark in the area that stands out. It is beautiful and the lazer show is on the bay side of this hotel. I felt the hotel is a bit sterile(massive in the interior and bland). Reminds me of Luxor in Vegas. Unusual in design yet I didn't feel like I would want to stay there. Pricing of the rooms are impressive yet there are other luxury properties that were nicer. Taking pictures at night of the Skypark from the Gardens by Bay off the bridge really amazing photos.
,,Get Yourself a Drink at Ku De Ta,5.0,,"A wonderful view of Singapore. Don't pay for the viewing deck. Instead go up to the ""Ku De Ta"" bar before 7pm (when it closes to all except hotel guests) for free, and buy yourself a nice drink."
,,Amazing views of the city,4.0,,"Although this is expensive if you are travelling as a family the views are amazing. We also bought a photo as a momento. The seller was too pushy for my liking, I had intended buying it anyhow but he nearly put me off with his pushiness."
,,Spectacular but so crowded!,4.0,,"I am pleased to have gone to the 57th floor and seen the Skypark, but I never need to go back. I think it faces the wrong way for daytime viewing - over the city, but no doubt the lights look good at night. When we went, the place was so crowded we could hardly move, and it would have been hard to fit another person in the pool - I would be very upset as a paying guest to have to put up with that!"
,,Don't pay!,5.0,,"We asked at info downstairs and were told you had to pay to go to the top. They said you pay upstairs so we got the lift to the top floor.

We walked out onto a deck where you could see all over the gardens by the bay and the boats in the water.

We walked to where the pool was and were told it was for hotel guests only. So we walked round to the restaurant and viewing platform which is what you need your ticket for...even though you can see anyway! We were so glad we didn't pay $20 to walk 6 extra feet onto a platform.

The view is incredible, lovely hotel. Wish I had the money to stay here! Haha"
,,Unbelievable,4.0,,Fantastic views of the entire Bay area but definitely not for those afraid of heights - 57 floors high. We did the night tour - spectacular to see the colorful night lights of Singapore.
,,Nice view but so so drinks and service at a VERY steep price,3.0,,"This is definitely an incredible view -especially as the sun sets over the CBD. The building is worth seeing- it's huge and well done inside. It was fun to have a drink and watch the sky change. However, it was very expensive (no surprise- you're paying for the location) and the ambiance was a bit uncomfortable (no place to sit, crowded). I'd suggest it for a single drink but for a longer evening of cocktails and chatting, the Fullerton Bay Hotel bar is more comfortable and also has an excellent view."
,,Great views from Ku De Ta but expensive with poncy staff,2.0,,"Our family of 4 paid SGD40 for one pot of tea, one cup of coffee and two fizzy drinks. SGD40.... And we had to wait to both place and receive our order while the staff minced around looking as good as they could and trying to out-mince each other. Customer comes first? Forget about it.

Great for the views but you'll have to wait for the poncy waiters to mince out of the way before you can take your photos.

4 stars for the views but 2 stars overall for the lack of service and poor value for money."
,,Nice views,5.0,,"Go an look Singapore, specifically when sun is setting and you could take nice picture over the city."
,,Great archtecture,4.0,,"This is a really novel way to plant a tree garden... Very well done, with thevines and plants growing over the man made structures very effective. The skywalk is a must do and reasonably priced. We enjoyed exploring the various themed gardens around the Skypark and could easily spend several hours enjoying your time looking around."
,,A MUST!,5.0,,"You have to be a hotel guest to be able to go to the infinity pool but it is worth it, even if you just stay for one night! The views are excellent, the pool is long and you get to relax above all!
Is a Must when you visit Singapore!"
,,Excellent View But Pretty Expensive,4.0,,"The view from the Marina Sands Boardwalk is amazingly spectacular to say the least. Looking Singapore CBD during the night is a truly fantastic experience together with Singapore Ferris Wheel (similar to London Eye) and hilluminated by Singapore's natural ilightings. They all complemented with each other.

However, the $46.00 ticket price tag is relatively expensive considering that visitors could only stay atop for 2-hours max as there no other things to do other than taking pictures.

Vee visited Marina Sands on 4 April 2015."
,,57 floors up!,4.0,,we booked our tickets at our hotel and as a result found it hard to find the entrance for the lift up to the observation terrace. The views were fantastic. However got lost in the maze of shopping malls below and found it difficult to find our way out!
,,High above the city a giant mutant boat has landed on top of a hotel,4.0,,"This place is totally unbelievable. Like a vision from a sci-fi novel, a huge spaceship, half garden half Boeing is perched atop the towers of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, dominating the skyline. The view from the 56th floor, where the Skypark is situated, is spectacular. We were a little disappointed that we could only see part of the hotel garden from the Skypark .. it is restricted to guests of the hotel but the view is what it is all about ... and it is 360 degrees of sea, city and gardens. Not expensive either but a little convoluted to find from within the Mall."
,,Worldclass Hotel and experience,5.0,,"I can highly recoomend this awesome hotel, specially the pool at the top is a one in a lifetime experience. Ku De Ta nightclub is also awesome!"
,,Nice experience,4.0,,"We stayed in the hotel for two nights and it was a very positive visit. Ideally the pool at the top would have been less crowded (at least less selfie-sticks..), but otherwise everything was working very nicely. For the European standards the room-rate was quite expensive, but that seems to be the case everywhere in Singapore currently."
,,Coolest hotel in the world,5.0,,The cantilevered area at the top is actually a swimming pool. What a view up top. It's also worthwhile to go inside the hotel (I stayed there) as there are shops and exquisite design. You generally can't go up top unless you are a guest.
,,AMAZING BUT VERY VERY EXPENSIVE WHEN STAYIN THERE!!,3.0,,"The view from the top IS amazing!!

Although based on paying $2000 for 3 nights, compared to other 5 star hotels in Singapore, it worked out that I had paid approx $1000 for the rooftop pool & skypark access.

The pool is nice, but too cold. The jacuzzis are nice and warm but too few.

The skypark observation deck has great panoramic views of Singapore city.

One of the rooftop restaurants didn't even know how to cook french fries / hot chips, which was unbelievable (re my review of Marina Bay Sands Hotel).

Again, great view though :)"
,,excellent,5.0,,hat an experience. This was one of the most beautiful spots I have been to in a long while. The view is beyond anything you can imagine and the service is impeccable
,,Excellent view of CBD!,5.0,,Been there almost three times and had great photographs each visit .the best part is that you can stay there as long as you like ! Keep an umbrella always as it may be too hot or rainy.
,,a great place to visit,5.0,,During a business trip to Singapore a few colleagues including Singaporeans visited the sky park at night. Instead of go into the garden directly we visited a bar on the top adjacent to the garden the place was called Ku Dé Ta (yes a play on words). The expensive drinks gave you great views of the city plus entrance into the gardens. A fabulous relaxing place.
,,Wonderful view,5.0,,"At a cost of approximately $AU20, this was cheaper than the nearby Singapore Flyer and you can stay as long as you want.

There is a bar and restaurant at the top, and visitors are free to walk around. Unless you're a paying guest, you won't have access to the infinity pool.

There are usually a lot of people here but plenty of vantage points for an unbeatable view across Singapore city and further.

Highly recommended."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"If you love heights, this is one of the places to be.. you get a city wide view but if you already have plans to go to the flyer or sentosa's tiger ride.. maybe you want to save this money."
,,Over priced - 2 stars for the view only,2.0,,"Skypark is so pricey! The value to it is overpriced. The views are nice like every cities in the world viewing from a high level, but one thing Skypark has is the view to the Gardens. Garden's view is amazing.
With the overprice entrance fee, you get to take a picture with their fake backdrop (you need to purchase them if you want it), and take their elevator up to the Skypark, and that's it. You can't enter the pool area, its off limits to non-hotel guests, and there is one souvenir store, which left only the views to accompany you...blah!
We visited the bar next to it, also overpriced drinks , liqueur or non-liqueur, and there is no chairs for you to sit. Basically, I'm standing the whole time trying to enjoy my drinks and the view with tons of people around you trying to find a spot."
,,Stunning view from the top,5.0,,"I have seen pictures of Marina bay Sands so many times, but nothing comes close to experiencing in real life the view from the top of this modern giant ""boat"". Spectacular view!!!"
,,A good reason to stay at this hotel,5.0,,I love the architecture of this hotel and probably would have opted to stay there even if there was no skypark but that really clinched the deal for me. It is beautiful by day and night and you should experience it at both times. There are quiet lounge areas with palm trees and hot tubs on the side opposite the infinity pool. We had lunch at the pool area (expensive for Singapore and mediocre - but it was convenient and after over 30 hours of travel we were not picky). We did not go into the Sky Bar so not sure about that.
,,The best views of Singapore,4.0,,"It's expensive but absolutely worth it for the incredible 360 degree views. And, when you're back on the ground ,you can look up at the prow of the 'boat' and say I've stood there!"
,,Great views but better alternatives,2.0,,"Ok its the best view in Singapore granted but the Skypark is so limited to one corner of the towers it's not worth the admission.
Go to Ku de Ta instead, it shares the same corner but offers food, drinks and is a great nightclub as well. Plus admission fee gets you a free drink."
,,The View,5.0,,The view from the platform of the Marina Bay Sands was impressive. You had to take the elevator to the 76th floor. The cost per person is 23 Singapore dollars. That was worth it in our opinion.
,,Good views ridiculous prices,3.0,,Went to 57th floor bar for the views but cost of drinks insane and goes ultimately to support politics in US I do not support. Take pictures from outside...very impressive.
,,Go to Ku de Ta bar instead,4.0,,We arrived at the ticket office to buy our Skypark tickets just as it started to rain. Considering that due to the rain we would not get great views we decided to go to the Ku de Ta bar on 57th floor instead. Instead of paying the 23 SGD Skypark admission we spent the same amount on a beer at the bar and got a great view as the sun came out. The infinity pool is next to the bar but only accessible to hotel guests. Very happy with our decision as we got to enjoy a drink while taking in the views so would recommend this option.
,,Brilliant amazing views,5.0,,We absolutely loved the views from the oberservation deck at the Marina Bay Sands. Truly breathing of the city and surrounds well worth the money.
,,Don't visit if you don't mind to waste money and time,1.0,,SGD23 for 1 but only 5 minutes can finish，totally waste money. Staff asked to take photo with marina bay sands background but need SGD35 for it if u want to buy，but when u leave after refused to buy，they said the pic is SGD20 only. So try to refuse at the first time to get a cheaper price
,,Not worth the price,3.0,,"Great view, but for$68 for 3 it's just not worth it. There's no seating anywhere on the deck so if the restaurant is not open, and it wasn't before 10, there's no respite from the elements. Not great if you're pregnant/elderly etc and you need to chill."
,,Try Floor 57 right-hand tower,5.0,,There is a greta Restaurant and Cocktail Bar on the 57th floor where you can peek at the Marina Sands Bay Hotel pool and sip a Singapore Sling whilst taking in the brilliant views for free.
,,This is an opportunity you probably won't have again,4.0,,"We had already been to the hotel several times and just felt we should take the time to go to the top. The price to go up is $20sgd per person. If you are not staying at the hotel, part of the roof (pool) is off limits. You have incredible view from up here. We thought we had great views from the Singapore Flyer, but this is even higher. There is a bar/restaurant at the top where we had a hamburger. The service was slow. Try to get a table near the infinity pool because that gives some great photo opps. If you have the time, you should invest the time and little money to go to the top. You need to devote about 1.5 hours if you are going to have a drink or something to eat at the top. quite a view!"
,,What a view,5.0,,This is on the top of Marina Bay SandsHotel.Go at night to see the lights of the city. It is worth the admission charge if you are not a hotel guest. Very busy and great atmosphere.
,,"Poor foods,but great hotel place",3.0,,"I had an average experience because I didn't like the food too much because most of the foods gave me a headache,but the hotel was great, but unfortunately the view from the top made my body shake because I didn't even like the view that bit even when I am taking a picture,my body shakes and especially when I am standing,it also make my body shake too much"
,,Amazing new year,5.0,,We got very reasonable tickets for the new year party. It was amazing. The view of the fireworks was first rate. Very happy!
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,The cost of the elevator ride up is totally worth it. There are amazing views of the island from on top the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The large open deck area is great for taking in the views and snapping a few great pictures.
,,Expensive,3.0,,It costs more than twenty bucks to go up. view was alright but i don't think it worth the money I paid. rather i should have ridden the Singapore flyer nearby and enjoy the skyline of city.
,,good view,4.0,,"if u want see good view and watch all singapore go there,but surely go at night! bcz u burn in direct sun with hot temp ( i burned) and just u can use deck, u cant use pool ..."
,,Never get tired of visiting it!,5.0,,"Fourth visit to Singapore, fourth stay at hotel and always visit the Skypark, yet never get over being impresssed by it and drinking it all in!"
,,Feels surreal,5.0,,The view from the top is excellent. you can also get glimpse of the swiming pool which is on edge . But only accessible by people staying in hotel. I would suggest to go in a restaurant and buy a cheapest drink which would be cheaper then buying the actual ticket ;)
,,Impressive new building with a wonderful skypark and bar at 53 and 54 floors.,5.0,,"You have got to visit this new landmark of Singapore. Impressive new building, so modern and with a view that is incredible at day light, but even more spectacular at night. I may suggest you go up for a drink, at the skybar, and see the skypark. Be aware that after 7pm there is a dress code- no shorts- and after 22pm they close the rest of the skypark, only staying open the skybar, really nice to have a drink at night, overlooking the skyscrapers, and a nice breeze at the 54 floor. Do not miss it."
,,Nothing like it in the World,5.0,,We donned our robes and slippers provided in the room and headed to the 57th floor. Our room keys allowed us access to the lounging area and infinity pool. Picked up towels and newspaper at the towel concierge. No problem finding a lounge chair at the pool. Had to take a picture of us bathing at the edge with the city in the background. Do not miss this if you are going to Singapore.
,,"Great Views, Pricey Drinks",4.0,,"A little tricky to find through the shopping mall, but once there the lift whisks you up to the cocktail bar - and/or the viewing deck. We understood that a $35 cocktail each would get us to the viewing deck - nope that's extra. Thankfully we enjoyed a wander around the bar area before finishing our very nice drinks before being disappointed."
,,What a view,5.0,,Excellent pool and the views are wonderful. Not too crowded and restaurant and bar facility is fantastic. Great thing for a morning swim or a sit at the edge of the sky in early evening taking in the city.
,,Definitely a bucket list item,5.0,,Superb view of Singapore and a wonderful (if somewhat windy) roof-top pool. Something you must try at least once. I will be back.
,,Not my cup of tea,2.0,,"Impressive enough, indeed a must see, but I have a preference for genuine places were people want to be, not because they need to be."
,,Wonderful and scary,5.0,,I had no idea what an infinity pool might look like until I saw this one. Seeing the skyline of Singapore from what appears to be the horizon of a pool is mind blowing.
,,View from marina sands sky park,4.0,,One can have spectacular view of Singapore sky scrapers and marina bay from top of sky park . Entrance fee is about 23 SGD and it is walk able distance from Merlion park and a walk through helix bridge lead you to the sky park . Gardens by the bay also close to sky park .
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent view of the city all around, good food, unique structure, there is a restaurant and bar to enjoy your drinks. If time permits one can spend a good hour and half to enjoy the view"
,,Wow!,4.0,,"The architecture of this facility is stunning. Just about everything about Marina Bay Sands is astounding. If anything detracts from it, it is the time it takes wandering around to take everything in. Another Singapore landmark!!!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"I stayed at the hotel and the view from the deck is as good, even better than any other spot in the hotel. No one should miss this view when in town."
,,Skypark,4.0,,A very beautiful view of the entire city from A TOP the Skypark. Also a very beautiful restaurant at the top to chill your experience.
,,Great view of the City!,4.0,,The best place to see the amazing city of Singapore. It's one of the great spots to go to especially if you are in Singapore for a very short stay. The restaurant is a bit pricey but a must try.
,,Avoid if you have any fear of heights!,4.0,,The Marina Bay Sands dominates the Bay horizon with its size and appearance. It is a fantastic looking building and the view from the skypark is stunning!
,,Best view in town,5.0,,Get yourself to the top of sands. you will see why. The pool is more a plunge pool that you walk in above your waist rather than actually swim. Everyone is too busy posing for photos at night to want to swim anyway. Just wade in chill out and watch the view come at sun down.
,,Amazing by night,5.0,,"I`ve been on top both at day time and by night. Daytime view is so so. A hit and miss. However the view by night was stunning.

At 23 SGD is not cheap but its well worth the price!

You have only access to a part of the rooftop. They will tell you this when you buy the ticket as well. The other part is reserved for the hotel guest. However the part you have access to is big enough to walk arround and have good view over singapore."
,,awesome view but over priced...,3.0,,The view is truly insiring and out of this planet but you pay a lot of money to get up there..And it is only for a few pics!!!
,,Must Go Place In Singapore,5.0,,"The most iconic place in Singapore. If you want to visit the famous ""infinity pool"", you need to book a room. Infinity pool itself makes it worth of staying in Marina Bay Sands hotel, though the hotel service is not that good comparing to other hotels located in Marina Bay area. Even though the pool is available only for the guests, you can freely enter the roof-top bar, Ku De Ta, which is a great place to enjoy the night view of Marina Bay."
,,Terrific Views,5.0,,"While it's a ilttle expensive the views from up in the skypark are fantastic. We managed a twlight visit, so got the best of daylight and night time."
,,spectacular views out of this world,5.0,,"If you want to experience space travel/futuristic spaceship/planet - take the tour to the top of the Marina Sands Hotel - it is amazing to view the incredible and impossible-looking architecture and engineering that goes into the hotel, the wheel, the gardens and glasshouses. The fee was modest and well worth it even if you just have an hour to spare, and there is extremely good signage at the top to explain what you are seeing. A great birds eye view to get our bearings for a later tour of the city by Hippo Bus."
,,Amazing place and views !!,5.0,,"I like this place alot !! Very very nice view, good place for photos, meeting points and you should visit this place when you in singapore,very highly recommended.."
,,An excellent view of the city,4.0,,"We decided to take the trip to the top floor and were not disappointed. It's a great way to see the city and the hotel is something to marvel. It's slightly expensive, however compared to other similar attractions worldwide, it is reasonably priced. Its a must do when in Singapore."
,,So so,3.0,,"There are far better views from the Singapore Flyer and at $23 a ticket it's not really that worth it - to experience the Marina bay Sands skypark, you're better off dining at Sky on 57."
,,A must-do in Singapore,5.0,,"You cannot really visit Singapore and not go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The hotel itself is an architectural marvel, and the views from the top are amazing. The roof-top horizon pool is quite impressive too. The information boards around the edge are simple and informative about what you are looking at. Don't miss this attraction in Singapore."
,,Wow! What a view!,5.0,,"It is MUST-SEE! The view in the evening is stunning! You can see the flyer, gardens by the bay, art and science museum. You feel yourself like on top of the world"
,,"Must-See In Singapore, A World-Class Building",5.0,,"There aren't many buildings like the Marina Bay Sands. As of March 2015, it is reputed to be the most expensive building in the world. It is among the most distinctive. It is the ultimate in the Asian style of massive development featuring luxury retail, restaurants, hotel and attractions. The building is actually three 55-story hotel buildings, each of which probably would be a statement on its own. The three together are awe-inspiring. That the developer chose to crown the complex with a huge elliptical structure serves to gild the lily. We ate lunch in the cafe restaurant, finding the food excellent and affordable. Service was impeccable. By eating in the restaurant, you can visit the skydeck without paying admission; it would be worth the price to see this marvel of design and engineering. You can appreciate the 57th floor infinity pool without needing to walk to its edge. The building is an architectural achievement which instantly trademarked Singapore as a world center of commerce."
,,Sky veiw.,5.0,,"This is our third visit to Singapore and we definitely were determined to do the Sky park this time around. And we weren't disappointed! I particularly didn't think it was overpriced entry, although the drinks at the Sky bar are pretty hexxy. Though you can't go to the top and enjoy the scenery without indulging in a light refreshment. And what a view it is, just so mesmerizing. I would say that the sky park would have to be the most photographed structure in Singapore. May I add that considering how high up you travel the lifts are great as they done fly up and you hardly feel any gravitational pull on the way up. Beware dress code after 5pm! A must do on the list!"
,,Just another place to check off on the list,4.0,,"It was a beautiful view from the top of the sky park. I went with a friend I had met in Singapore, and we went up to have a view of the city, be on top of the Marina Bay Sands, and to have a drink. Drinks up there are expensive, so we only stayed for one. Got some great pictures of the city from up there, and was worthwhile."
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Very busy and expensive bar but the view was superb - don't pay to get to the top just tell them you want to have a drinkin the bar
,,"Costly but an amazing view from the top of Singapore, brilliant!.",5.0,,"I watched the Skypark being built, it has changed the skyline of Singapore and is already an iconic structure like so many other places in Singapore. The Skypark is a brilliant design, an excellent viewing platform to see Singapore night & day, a photo shoot paradise! but also looking up at the Skypark from so many angles, I have so many photos of it during the day it commands the sky and at night unlike many other buildings it stands out in this beautiful city. As you enter photos are taken and you have the option to see yourself with the iconic Skypark background, £10 but has to be done!!."
,,What a view!!,5.0,,The best location to see the skyline and cityscape of Singapore - day or night. Well worth the small fee. A must visit.
,,A View from Above,4.0,,"I reluctantly visited this attraction at the insistence of my wife who likes tall structures.

As you would expect the view from the top IS amazing, especially after dark when the city lights up.

Once again, zombies with smart phones and selfie-sticks dominated the scenery and blocked views and access.

If aerial views are your thing, then go. They are not my cup of tea, and not really worth the hefty entry fee."
,,Singapore in a new era,5.0,,"This symbolized the transformation of Singapore. Gambling is not encouraged but entertainment would be acceptable for the well-being of Singapore's economy. To bet or just walk about there's plenty to explore, we nearly bought tickets for the theatre had we worked out enough time for it. Food courts is no disappointment. Fine dinning choices are many. We have no regrets in going there."
,,Singapore's Iconic Building and amazing view from the top,5.0,,"Do not miss the opportunity to visit Singapore's iconic building and the wonderful view from the top at 56th Floor. For a visit to the viewing deck, you have to approach from Tower-3 of the building, the tickets are purchased at the building basement and the viewing deck is at the 56th floor. There are separate elevators to take you up at the 56th floor and there is also a lovely restaurant at the 57th floor. the view from the top is breathtaking. We loved this experience and loved overall the building and enjoyed the walk through from The Shoppes to the main building."
,,Wow!,5.0,,What a view! The Marina Bay Sands Hotel stands proudly in the bay with its amazing roof top Skypark. Zoom up 57 storeys in the lift and walk out onto the viewing platform for the most incredible views. It's a weird sensation knowing you have nothing but air beneath you as you stand up there and I had the strangest feeling that the platform was swaying (maybe it was) but I wouldn't have missed this experience. Unfortunately you can't access the roof top pool and restaurant from the viewing deck unless you are a hotel guest. Next time we are in Singapore this is where we will be staying!
,,57th floor wonder,5.0,,"A man made wonder of the modern world for certain. In June 2013 I admired this building from Merlion Park on the other side of the bay. Roll on to March 2015 and I was privileged to stay here for four nights. I swam in the infinity pool several times, relaxed by same, enjoyed the spa and phenomenal views on both sides. A selection of photos are attached. I enjoyed the experience very much, a bucket list experience."
,,Something different,4.0,,"Something differet! Still I had I feling that again something was missing? I love the idea of that shipboard, deck."
,,Singapore Vacation,4.0,,Its well worth going up to the Skypark and enjoy the beautiful views of the Marina Bay area. As we did not stay at the hotel we had not access to the infinity pool though.
,,Good location to view Singapore,5.0,,"You really can view SG from the top of it, it's 72th floor by lift. Nice place for those who love see sight, you can stay at the Marina Bay Sands too, they have very nice swimming pool."
,,best view at night,5.0,,I decided to go to the Skypark at night to avoid the scorching hot weather in the afternoon at Singapore. You only have to pay 23 sgd for the view! It has a great view of Singapore skyline.
,,The view is outstanding!,5.0,,Make sure you visit so you can see what the city looks like from I think the 57th floor. The hotel itself is amazing but to get this birds eye view of the city is wonderful.
,,--,4.0,,well it was awesome and we had some delicious pink beer at the pool top bar !!! Cant write 100 words/characters when we stayed there for less than 100 minutes. But the fireworks are better in Dubai. All in all we spent a wonderful evening and a visit recommended for all.
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"The view is spectacular! I was initially disappointed that the entire rooftop wasn't open, i.e. infinity pool, etc. however, when I reflect on that it occurs to me that it would be a total nightmare for the hotel to have to deal with that kind of volume of people trying to swim or ruining their guest's experience (that they paid quite a lot of money for)"
,,Expensive but great views,4.0,,"We met some friends up the top and it certainly gives you some magnificent views of Singapore on a good day, was a little windy but that is to be expected being so high. Food & Drinks are astronomical in price & would just pay the $20 viewing price."
,,This will blow your mind,5.0,,"Get ready for a heady experience. The public can go to the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck for a fee of S$23 for Adults, S$17 for Children up to 12 years old, and S$20 for anyone 65 years and older. The sights and sounds are incredible, you can see for miles better then an airport control tower its so high, on one side you can see the Central Business District, behind you the Gardens by the Bay and out into the Sea.
Only guest who are staying at the Marina Bay Sands can visit the Infinity Pool on the other side of the SkyPark Observation Deck. Experience the world's largest rooftop pool at its height offering the best city-skyline view of of a 5-star hotel in Singapore.
It is easy to get to the Marina Bay Sands hotel by MRT get off at the Bayview MRT station and walk out. Once your all done viewing Singapore from the Skypark you can come down and go Shopping at the Shoppes at Marina Bay."
,,Not too bar,4.0,,"An awesome view from the top, although you have to pay. As the weather in singapore is often humid, it's best to wear something casual and light. Also there is a mini bar that serves chill beer - if I am not wrong it was tiger beer crystal. Cold beer/beverage goes hand in hand with the hot weather as well as with the splendid view. Don't forget to take photos"
,,Glittering sights but not much else!!,4.0,,"At towering height, the sights of Singapore at night are breathtaking. But for merely the sights, you pay quite a substantial amount. Limited people are allowed at the observation deck at a particular time but still somehow it gets a little crowded and you have to make your way around to get a few nice camera shots. It is a pleasant way to spend your evening."
,,Drinks with a View,5.0,,A great way to see Singapore at night with a drink in hand !!! We went up to KUDeTa to have a drink at the bar and enjoy the sights of Singapore rather than the viewing platform. You need to go to the Restaurant/ Bar desk and make a booking if not too busy you can go up and have a few drinks or a meal and enjoy the sights.
,,See Singapore City from the Top,5.0,,"From here you can see singapore city view... and of course, it will more beautiful if you see in the night, you can see gardens by the bay... it's very fantastic..."
,,"Beautifull view & location, nice end of our trip.",4.0,,We visited SIngapore as a stop over between Bali and Amsterdam and had only six hours to spend so we took the hop-on hop-of bus and ended at the Marina Bay Sands around 19.30. Around 20.00 the trees of the Gardens by the Bay will light up. The view is very nice from the 57th floor but it can be windy up there.
,,A better view you will not find,5.0,,"You have two options to access this breathtaking view of Singapore. You can pay the S$23 for adults or S$17 for children (aged between 2 - 12 years) to go to the Observation deck or you can buy a drink at Ku De Ta (a cocktail costs about the same as admission to the observation deck - but a beer will set you back only S$16).

Note that you need to dress neatly and be there before the 9pm cover charge kicks in. Around 7:00 pm is perfect - the sun goes down on the city, the lights come up and you can nick back down to the Marina Bay event plaza and catch the 8pm water and light show. Chars."
,,"Good views, but that's about it!",4.0,,"It was s$23 to go up to the observation deck. It's pretty hot up there with no shade, and only a small kiosk. The views are great (when it's not overcast and cloudy - which it is a lot of the time), but it's quite a lot to spend to just to walk around the far end of the roof and have no access to anything else (only guests can use the infinity pool, etc)."
,,Breath-taking view of singapore city & skyline- Dont miss this one!,5.0,,"This is a must-vsit place...
we went after light showers...were not sure if we can go to top owing to fact that it was cloudy & just had rains..

this was one great visit...to begin with got a dicounted tickets with my SQ memebrship card,.. so a bit of savings..(who doesn't like it)
we spend almost 2 hrs at obeservation deck .. we reached top just before sunset so got the glimpses of the city & skyline during day-light, also woitnessed the changing skyline, oits colors, marvellous sight to behold, as the sunsets in & thousands of lights lit up ...it completely transformed the scene ...
amazing sight to witness ...difficult to describe in words unless you see it by yourself...
also watched the light show at garden of bay from the top...it was as if someone is specially arranged this hsow for us,,...it looks amazing from top as you get the complete view of all trees in garden & the light show entralls you..

On the other side, the merllion statue pouring water on the backdrop of fullerton hotel & then the tall, shy-scraper buidlings that form the amazing skyline of Singapore ...awesome view from top...
clicked hundereds of photos here...
Strongly recommend you to visit it, thta too with friends / family & enjoy the view.."
,,Not worth the money!,2.0,,"Although the build up to the skypark is good, I felt somewhat let down when I got to the top as half of the skydeck had been closed off due to complaints from the hotel guests that visiotrs were intruding on their space. This closure was not reflected in the ticket price and I paid full price despite not being able to walk along the whole length of the skypark.

The views were lovely, although it was quite a smoggy day and so some things were obscured from view.

Lots of people all around trying to get the best picture and often using 'selfie-sticks' which tend to bash you on the way round.

I felt that this was overpriced and would not do it again if I revisited Singapore."
,,Absurd policy,2.0,,"Four of us wanted to have a drink at 6pm for a half an hour, but got refused cause one of the guys very elegantly dressed was having shorter trousers below the knee. Difficult to understand this absurd policy when at the same time you have people in and around the pool in swimming suits."
,,No Ku de ta,2.0,,"We were advised to go to the bar at the top. We did not find this a pleasurable experience. It was difficult to get served, it took 25 minutes to be given change. It was a young persons bar with the staff serving young people first and it was overcrowded even though it was a week night&. Food overpriced"
,,Stunning View,4.0,,"Great View, and very good organization. The super fast elevators don't waste time, but slightly over priced as usual in Singapore"
,,Who builds this?,5.0,,"I'm convinced that the coolest job in the world is to be an architect in Hong Kong. Who builds this? I don't know. But I'm glad they did. We had a great time having a beer at the top of the world in Singapore. I was worried that since we weren't guests at the hotel we might be treated poorly, but as long as we sipped a drink the staff were super happy to have us there."
,,over-rated and boring,2.0,,"This place is highly over rated. its crowded and its typically filled with people trying to get a picture of the skyline. there are more people taking pictures than there are guests actually swimming. a medioce hotel, but the view is very good. the crowd is bad."
,,What a view,5.0,,I do not like heights and this is 56 floors up to the sky park. But it was well worth making myself go to look at the view even though I could not go to the rail. The view of Singapore from here is amazing and the photo opportunity great.
,,Great views,3.0,,The view from the bar in Marina Bay Sands Skypark is fantastic - a great place to watch the sun setting while drinking your sundowner of choice.
,,Awesome and a bit scary,4.0,,Out of this world experience for a hotel. Went to ku-de-tah at the top for a drink. 57th floor. Very crowded and expensive as you would expect but an experience would not forget.
,,Beautiful concept,5.0,,"Light show during night was wonderful,landscaping n choice of plants is really beautiful.Nice specious green n peaceful place in Singapore."
,,Bar with a view,4.0,,"Go to the bar at the sky park and there is no entry charge. The drink however will set you back $23.00 but a least you get the drink and the view. Fantastic view over Singapore, probably best at night and well worth the price. Buzzy young set showing off but if you can bare that it's worth the trip. One drinks enough!"
,,Not Worth It,2.0,,"Please be aware of what you will be paying for. If you simply would like to be at the top of the very distinctive Marina Bay Sands Hotel and enjoy the view from a tall building, then you may enjoy this attraction. On the other hand, if you expect to use, or even just see, the iconic infinity swimming pool, you should know that the pool is only available to hotel guests. Visitors simply get a peek at the pool, which is some distance away from the visitor area. What you are paying for then is a rather barren outdoor deck with a limited-menu, rather high-priced outdoor restaurant and access to a higher-priced indoor restaurant atop a tall building. In comparison to the observation decks atop high-rises in many other cities, the Marina Bay Sands Skydeck simply does not measure up. In my opinion, the view and experience provided by the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel provide a much better return for the money."
,,Great view from the top,4.0,,"This was my second visit to the skypark and found out that access to the garden behind the pool was closed and accessible only to hotel guests. My first visit there was in 2011 and we could still access the garden and enjoy the Singapore skyline view from behind the pool (though we couldn't access the pool). The weather was good (compared to my first visit) so we could enjoy a clear view to the city, to the gardens, Singapore flyers and to the sea. And it wasn't too crowded so we could enjoy to stay there longer"
,,WOW!!!!!,5.0,,A big must do the views are amazing.It cost us $23 each to go up the top but is worth every cent.You would miss so much if you didn't go up to the top.
,,"A bit pricey, but worth a visit",4.0,,"I thought $23 each just to go up to the Skypark was a bit steep, on top of which they take your photo and attach it to one of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background - if you wish to pay another $55 on top! However, once you're up there the 360 degree view of the city is quite spectacular. We stayed and had lunch in the Ku De Ta Restaurant which was very expensive but the food was extremely good, as was the wine. We finished our visit with a few drinks overlooking the infinity pool on the other side of the roof. A nice visit, but pricey. Worth doing once but wouldn't rush back."
,,Simply one of the best pool decks in the world!,5.0,,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands in September 2014 but wanted to review the Skypark separately because my wife and I and our friends found it simply so exceptional.

In short simply one of the best pool decks in the world and perhaps the most exceptional elevated pooldeck on the planet!

Access to the pool and probably 80% of the Skypark is restricted to hotel guests. This is a smart decision by the Sands Corporation as the pool deck would truly be overrun by day visitors. So as guests we were able to enjoy this wonderful piece of paradise. The pool deck opens at 6am in the morning and is open until late at night and it has the most unbelievable view!

On the one side one is overlooking the South China Sea and the Gardens at the Bay which is beautiful and on the on other side one overlooks the Marina Bay area and the CBD area.

There is lots to do up there but the real big thing is to do as little as possible! Grabbing a sunbed as early as you can is a smart idea. There is no where enough deck chairs and sunbeds for all the guests but clearly they have done the numbers and anticipate that seldom will every guest in the hotel, at one time, be at the pool deck. It is often very busy. The best time to arrive is 6am to secure your sunbeds. There are several hot tubs which we found to be maintained at a very high temperature and were extremely relaxing, even if a little difficult to get in!! You have to sort of sit down and then swing your legs over into the hot tub which may appear easy but for those who may have slight disabilities this is not the easiest thing to do without handrails. There is also a lovely shop which offers swimming costumes, flip-flops, sunscreen, hats, etc..

There are smoking areas which makes it more pleasurable for non-smokers whilst catering for everybody.

One of the huge pluses for us was the Adults-Only pool, which is strictly enforced, and made our experience all the more relaxing.

The bar service from the local restaurant is pretty good with waiters and waitresses walking around offering drinks and lite bites all day long until the early part of the evening. They're not too strict if you leave your sunbed for a little while if you need to return to your room or having lunch in one of the restaurants.

What makes this so exceptional is simply its design. A very large pool connecting 3 extremely large hotel towers to make it one property. Simply exceptional!

For those who are not staying at the hotel you can visit Skypark a couple of ways:
Firstly you can buy a ticket and enter through Tower Three's entrance which is clearly marked Skypark. It's around $20 and you can visit the observation deck. Is it worth it - absolutely. From that side of Skypark you are able to see the Singapore wheel, the bay, and the outlet through to the South China Sea. The height of the property at 57 stories makes Skypark skydeck an incredible view point.
Secondly you could dine at Ku Da Ta which is an elegant Asian Bistro restaurant and offers one of the best outdoor deck areas which is part of the observation deck itself but closed off to restaurant guests.

In my opinion simply one of the best elevated pools and observation decks in the world!"
,,On top of the world in a bikini!,5.0,,Loved sitting it the hot spa overlooking the city and enjoying the views! Definitely a must do for everyone!
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,Spectacular (and the best) views of Singapore. Better views than the Singapore Flyer as its much higher. You can see Peninsular Malaysia to the North and Indonesian off-shore islands to the East. Just make sure you go there when there are clear skies because at certain times of the year there is haze over Singapore caused by forest fires in other countries - usually around May to October. You might have to wait to get up there as only certain number of people allowed at a time. You get your ticket either online or at the counters. If you dine at one of the restaurants there is no entrance fee to the Skypark. Restaurants a bit on the expensive side though. Go there late afternoon to see the sunset and then watch as the city transforms into night. Quite special.
,,Drinks with a view.,4.0,,Fabulous view while sipping on a gin and tonic. Pity loud music was turned on blasting the tranquil moment.
,,best bird view of singapore,5.0,,the sky park gives a marvelous view of singapore city.ita a must do attraction in singapore..its best for all ages.
,,Average,3.0,,It's a little crowded so taking photos could be a little difficult. The view from the top is not that spectacular too. But one should visit even once when you're in SG. :)
,,Great,5.0,,Really enjoyed the swimming pool and the Hot Tub. Great view of the city. Perfect for picture taking.
,,Excellent View,4.0,,went to Eat dessert Buffet full of chocolate. Finally got tired of eating so sweet things But overall experience is very good. Must visit place
,,Marina bay sands skypark,4.0,,"The structure of this skypark look like a crocodile on top. The swimming pool is the best , it look like you are swimming on the sky. The scenery are great too."
,,"Must see, especially at night",4.0,,"Getting a view from the Skypark is fantastic. We went at night and the experience is spectacular, though if you plan on having a drink at one of the restaurants (we went to Ku De Ta) be prepared to spend some money. We had 8 drinks and the cost was $240 SGD. Also note that the Infinity Pool is for Hotel Guests only."
,,Amazing view from the deck,5.0,,"We went to the deck area of marina bay during our visit to garden by the bay. Try to go here in the evening before dark and spend time till it gets dark. The view from the top is simply awesome.
You need to buy tickets to go to the deck.
Deck is at 57th floor :)"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"In heavy tropical raining visit ti and it's very beautiful,peaceful and romantic,you can see panoramic view of the city and landmark:garden,flyer and famous buildings also enjoy the lonely pool on the roof"
,,Great Views,4.0,,"The views are spectacular and its certainly a unique building. You can only access the viewing platform and you have to stay at the hotel to enjoy the pool and full views. Personally I thought it was a little expensive even with a SIA travel discount at nearly 40 dollars for two people. Still its one of those experiences you have to do while you are there.
Would recommend."
,,"Breathless view, a must while in Singapore",5.0,,The Scenery from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark to whole Singapore from is absolutely amazing….Night time visit is highly recommended. Be advice that at the entrance they ask you to take a picture. Each edited picture cost a 55 SGD.
,,A view not to be missed,4.0,,"Yes, as it boasts it is the 1st main premier attraction of Singapore. Though the ticket prices are sky high (SGD 33/pax), the view is worth it. Its astounding from 56th floor. The ports, thousands of halted ships, gardens by the bay, the river, the stadium, the Merlion and all high rising surrounding buildings. the view explains why SGP is a 1st world country. Do not miss it. Also a tip , try visiting at dusk or late. Its even more beautiful if its a lil cloudy and windy. And there a free laser on water show behind the Marina Bay convention hall. Its pretty amazing."
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,Excellent views and good atmosphere but bring plenty of money. A pint of beer cost $22 Australian dollars. We went on Sunday and there was free entry.
,,Ok for the view,4.0,,"Liked the shopping mall built in. The Marina Bay sands hotel itself is overrated and what you pay is the premium for architecture, but not value for money to stay in."
,,Spectacular,3.0,,"Spectacular hotel, spectacular view. A place to visit just experiece the place. Many visitors, hotel occupancy always above ninety (2500 rooms). As hotel to stay in, well a little too big."
,,Brilliant View,5.0,,"Went to the Skypark exactly at 8pm. Right on time for the Laser show. I don't think that you're supposed to view the laser show from up top, but regardless the view was brilliant. Easily comparable to the Peak view in Hong Kong.
Gardens by the Bay looked spectacular!"
,,Bond-esque Bar perfect for a celebration,5.0,,"Top of the world the MBS Skypark Bar KuDeTa had all the accents of a Bond casino table without the women. I enjoyed cocktails with the boys and overheard amazingly confidential business calls as the travelling hedge masters checked in with their HQs. Only really viable for those on an expense account I drank int he view and marvelled at how Singapore grows in relevance and reinvents itself each decade - try to spot the MerLion fountain on the side of the river miles below - it used to be a tourist draw - now almost a ""where's wally"" challenge. Great service, pricey and not very generous drinks in terms of size - but as spirited cocktails they pack a punch, have a soda for second drink if you're travelling with your boss."
,,Nice View,4.0,,"Excellent scenery, great architecture, unforgettable memory! Worth to pay - I didn't stay in the hotel, so I need to pay for visiting the SkyPark."
,,Beautiful view!,4.0,,It was about $23 Singapore each to go up on the sky deck but it was very beautiful! I'd bet it's more worth it at night though!
,,SkyPark,5.0,,"Wow, what a experience. What a view. What efficiency. Waht good value. the panorama around the Skypark gives us a better appreciation of Singapore as a city and as a nation."
,,Worth it,4.0,,"Visited the building because of its bizarre construction. The Skypark is situated over the 'suspended' part of the top deck (left, when viewed from the city). It obviously provides a great view over the city and sea and that makes it worth the quite expensive admission price. Skip the photo in front of the blue screen if you don't want to buy a picture of you photoshopped in front of the building later (you can take it yourself).

One floor higher is a skybar with I guess almost similar view as the skypark. I don't think they charge admission fee, but a dresscode is there after a certain time (I guess around 5 pm but not sure)."
,,Great views of singapore,3.0,,"I was disappointed with the cost and long wait to eventually arrive at the top of the place, there is a confined area to walk around.and no access to the pool or bar area. However the views are brilliant, the laser show was good and night views over the Gardens by the Sea was exellent.

I think the better way is to go to the resturant/ bar/ pool area money better spent that way."
,,Must do!!,5.0,,"The Marna Bay Sand complex (I am calling it a complex) has the bueatiful Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Gradens, the best view of Singapore and the Marina. Bring your camera and a light sweater if you are going at night."
,,Must do attraction in Singapore !,5.0,,Must do attraction if you are in Singapore! Superb amazing views over the Singapore taking in its skyline . 56 levels high its a skyscraper with a pool at the top and on a goods clear day you can even see as far as Indonesia and the cargo ships and oil tankers queuing up to enter Singapore busy harbour . For me this is highlight attraction in Singapore deffo worth it !!!
,,Superb view,4.0,,"Lift to the 57th floor enables you to have a superb view of Singapore, the outlying islands, the port area etc and etc. Available drinks are not overly pricey, considering - and particularly if you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass stub offering a discount. Bar area is noisy though, but there is plenty of space outside."
,,Wow Must visit,5.0,,The water and music show happens in front of this hotel. Amazing and must visit. There is nothing in India like this I have seen.
,,Nice view of singapore,5.0,,"You can have a nice view of singapore from Marina bay sands skypark,but to have a good experience of the park,its better if you have access to hte swimming pool of the hotel which is located there."
,,High and WOW!,4.0,,"$20 to go up is a waste.... go for lunch, and take time to sit, relax and enjoy the amazing view.
To understand just how important a seaport Singapore is, you need to get up high. From the restaurant we counted over eighty ships waiting in the bay to load or unload. It was like a still shot of an invasion."
,,Great view of Singapore,5.0,,"I only did the lookout place, but you can get the combo ticket and then you can use the pool. Fabulous view from the platform, definitely a must see if you're in SGP, an amazing structure, you'll love it."
,,Use your SQ boarding pass to get a discount,3.0,,Wonderful view of the city worth going during sunset set but don't wait for light show that's hard to see from top and better seen from the ground. It gets windy on the top and sometimes chilly. Show your boarding pass from SQ and get 15% off.
,,On Top Of The World,5.0,,We went to the bar at the top where you can have drinks while you marvel at the Singapore skyline. Spectacular view. Next time we will stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel to experience the eternity pool.
,,Very impressive,5.0,,I was there with friends only for a visit on the rooftop floor. There were a lot of tourists. View from the top floor is so spetacular. The building itself is also amazing. I would come back again.
,,nice to know but once is just enough,3.0,,"convince by a friend to go to this place..
place where we can see singapore from above high.

located on the 56th floor at marina bay sands hotel
it guarantee a windy and super high location.

though i feel that it is overprice.
with ""only"" that kind of view and we must pay 23SGD, its way too expensive

with not very much to see and to do of course, those with a phobia or high and with children better no need to go to this place."
,,Hang the expense you only live once,5.0,,These admission charges tend to build up after a few visits to various attractions. But the view from the top is worth the hit to the credit card. Take your time and enjoy 360 views over the city. Great fun
,,What a view,4.0,,Go at sunset to see the city at its best. Also we asked to go up to the bar for a drink. The drinks are outrageously expensive but at least you get a drink for your money whereas just a visit to the viewing platform costs about the same. You get as good a view. Would have been good to see the infinity pool though. But we were able to get past security.
,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel at the top,4.0,,"This was a great experience. The Marina Sands is a combination of 3 towers, built like shuffling of cards on their end. With a ship like structure laying across the 2 towers. We took a elevator up to the top of the hotel, in the bar looking at the infinity pool looking out over Singapore. I think it was $15.00 to go up to the top, but for $25.00 you got to have a drink and hangout and walk around. Really fantastic views of Singapore, the Ocean, Marina and all the ships."
,,worth a view,3.0,,"getting to hotel is a small hike.
access to roof top deck is via fee entry to deck or roof bar.
Bar is free entry.
if you get a seat on the edge then good views. Staff not very attentive to yr needs. drink prices average."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Amazing place with so much to do and see go late afternoon till dark as the lights are just amazing.Have to see to believe, you won't be disappointed. Love all of it."
,,Best place to see marina bay,4.0,,The view is just fantastic to see marina bay sands from the top.and also the best time to click pictures where you can see the entire Singapore places.
,,You must love this place,5.0,,"As you can see, I am very impressed by the whole location at Marina Bay. As I always skipped Singapore in the last 10 years, I now know what I have missed. Recommended esp. at the evening or night."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This hotel and the pool is beyond everything I ever imagined! The prices for drinks are big, but worth it."
,,phenomenal!,5.0,,Never miss out its monstrous presence and the architectural advancement!! Mind blowing view from th sky park..
,,What a view,5.0,,"Something you have to do, to take in the sights of a big, beautiful and busy country.you can see for miles and able to appreciate the architecture of the Marina Bay Sands building."
,,Maybe won't visit if not staying here,3.0,,"Visited the sky park twice. Hmm, I would say, maybe not so worth it to just specially pay and go. However, the entrance tic is not expensive.If not mistaken, SGD 20. I dont find it very special , just a typical view of city from a very high building. For Hotel guests, it's free."
,,wow,5.0,,amazing sky view from 57th floor. The whole city looks so vibrant from eagle's eye view from the pool side. The architecture is just awesome & its a must visit on the travellers list when in singapore.
,,Flying High like a bird,5.0,,"This is a MUST for any visitor to Singapore...
In the daytime you can see forever... But in the night-time you have the Laser Show as well...
The cost is reasonable, and worth every cent...
The outside rooftop pool is for paying guests only, but there is so much to see that you will be picking up your jaw..WOW, what an experience..... Make sure you have your camera with you."
,,You can walk here but to get up the 3 billion $$$ building forget it !,5.0,,Very nice view but you have to lie your way up the three towers . Very annoying singers tourist board ! But hey it's a great view !
,,"not the tallest, but clearly the best rooftop",5.0,,"nice relaxing couches make for comfortable viewing with a refreshing drink in hand. Don't opt for the observation deck only. Go up one level to the outdoor, umbrella shaded lounge for a cool one."
,,worth the money to say been there done that,5.0,,"fantastic views, lots lots pics only get very small area to view unless you are staying at marina bay hotel, the end closest to the river is where you get to view Singapore, you don't see the pool on top as that will cost extra money again. but I was told if you get lift from centre of building up to restaurant go there for a drink then you prob will see the pool. we did not go so not sure."
,,fun swimming experience,5.0,,We booked two nights at MBS to enjoy the pool but found we really enjoyed the whole experience. Great views from our room on the 46th floor.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Best to go at sunset, views in every direction. Relax and spend an hour up there. Enjoy the restaurant and bars at the top"
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Expensive if you just go to the 56th floor, Skypark, however if you go to the lobby and tell them you are going for a drink or food it is free. We did this got off at the 56th floor , looked around and then went to the restaurant up a few steps for a drink. Great views from both locations. Very expensive drinks and food, 2 beers $38. But without paying to get up there it is still cheaper than paying to get onto the viewing deck. I would definitely go here again but not for too many drinks."
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit although hard to find way to get up there 57 floors up & 1 photo very expensive very pushy with photo's....view unbelievable we took our own fantastic photo's,.. only trouble there were people sitting every where on deck waiting for the gardens lights & that was up to 2hrs before,.. it did have signs saying no sitting but so many people there just ignored it had there own rules & wouldnt move.....over all views great"
,,Textbook touristy experience but probs worth it!,5.0,,"I agree with the other reviews - the access point is hard to find, the staff aren't very friendly and it's $23 per person plus a $55 souvenier photo if you want it. You're herded in like cattle into the lift and up onto the deck where you hustle to get to the edge to see the view. But the panorama is stunning and completely worth it! Sure you could probably google pictures of the view, but it's such an experience taking in almost 360 of the skyline. The restaurant option is there too but the skydeck has a better view and the restaurant has a dress code, is expensive and had a longer line when we went. I agree with going late afternoon to see the sunset but everyone else is doing the same thing so it's very busy. Forgive yourself for being a textbook tourist, because the view is worth it. :)"
,,the pool is awesome!,5.0,,Well worth the price of the hotel to use the infinity pool on the 57th floor. Amazing views both day and night.
,,Wow! Just google that attraction and check out the images.,5.0,,"Been looking forward to see this in person. All I can is speechless. Pick a nice day, clear blue skies, wow, it's like you are in heaven. Above the beautiful city, with a angular aerial view of many famous attractions around the area. It's astonishing, breath taking, etc. Think of the architectural standpoint to design such a beautiful piece of art. It's amazing to be there and enjoy the breath taking view from up high."
,,Snooty Staff!,3.0,,Loved the architecture and the views but the staff in the restaurant on the roof were so unhelpful! Add to that $55 for a souvenir photo! (Yes one photo) I don't think so...
,,Skip the admission and go to the restaurant or lounge for a drink. It's cheaper.,4.0,,The skypark is deliberately separated from the lounge and restaurant areas. The admission fee is $23 for adults but you can get good photos and pay less if you go to the restaurant and order an overpriced beer. The lounge has the best view of the city and you can buy your $16 tiger beer there.
,,Go in the evening before sunset for the best view,4.0,,"It's fairly expensive and it took some wandering to find the ticket booth - we had to ask the concierge who pointed us in the right direction. The photo people were irritating but we ignored them. Early evening is probably the best time - it's not as hot, you get to see the view during daylight, sunset, and the night lights of the business district. We came on a weekday night, and it wasn't too crowded. We even got to watch the light show in Gardens by the Bay from here, but from this height it was a bit underwhelming.

I wanted to go back down using the stairs, but was told that was for emergency use only."
,,It's like stepping in to the future!,5.0,,"Marina bay sands is definitely worth a visit. When I saw the amazing architecture in the bay I felt like I was in the future or something. The view from the rooftop bar in the hotel is great, but you can skip the Ferris wheel."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,What a wonderful view of the city. Skypark is in 57th floor. Ticket for a adult costs about 23 SGD. Stunning views in the evening. Sky bar is a great choice if you are a drinker. Somewhat expensive. And Sky57 is their restaurant. A classy restaurant with good atmosphere. Food was fine. This place is worth a visit if you come to marina bay sands. Tip: Try some shots or a beer & a good meal. Enjoy!
,,Panoramic Views - Dizzy Heights,4.0,,"I'm not the biggest fan of heights, but decided to go up to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark as we had missed that on the last visit to Singapore. At 200m above ground level, it is higher than the Singapore Flyer and you have some breath-taking views too. Unlike the Singapore Flyer, you can stay up there as long as you like, there's no limit on time for the views. Getting there is relatively easy as you can take the MRT right to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Once up there, you have the option of buying some snaks or drinks to enjoy while taking in the view, or you could go to the bar / restaurant (I seem to recall there being a dresscode for this, but can be checked on their website). Tickets cost (at the time) S$23 for adults, but they currently have a promotion on until September 2015 that if you present your Singapore Airlines boarding pass, you get a 15% discount on tickets. Keep checking their website for other promotions they might have. It's well worth the trip up to that dizzy height for the spectacular panoramic views you'll get to experience."
,,What a view!!,4.0,,"You can view Singapore...from different perspective...Garden by the bay...Singapore flyer, Chinatown, River, Clark Quay and Marina bay sands....its on 56th Floor and 23 Singapore dollar ticket price..."
,,Overpriced and rude staff,2.0,,"Our purpose was to see the nearby Gardens by the Bay at night. We were there around sunset but as it took longer as I thought to get dark I sat down. I was informed that it is not allowed to sit on the platform by the staff. I didnt try to go to the bar as there is a dresscode. Then to mention the annoying ""photo"" people who grabed us to make a picture just before entering the lift. At the top they tried to sell it in a very penetrant way making me feel rather on a bazaar than on the top of a luxury hotel. I also observed the ""proffessional"" staff giggling around commenting the photos. After paying already 23 SPD to enter the platform they wanted 55 SPD for the foto in a leather case. When the people were not interested they would try to sell the pictures for 35 SPD.

We left the platform before it was completely dark and walked to the artificial trees of the nice Gardens by the Bay Park. We enjoyed the nice light show from the ground With very nice view of the Hotel. Ah yeah and that for free..."
,,Incredible views of the city.,5.0,,"Infinity pool with incredible views of the city, what more can you want. You will have stunning photos and memmories."
,,Beautiful but overwhelming,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands complex dominates the waterfront. The three towers with what looks like a giant mushroom cap on top is stunning. We walked around the shops, of which there is an almost too large a selection and variety. It would be easy to get lost here and a serious shopper could spend hours just browsing. The restaurants in the complex run the gamut from very casual to high end celebrity chef restaurants. We weren't that hungry and opted for a light dinner at Mozza Pizzeria which is adjacent to Osteria Mozza.Both of these are Mario Batali outposts in Singapore. I would highly recommend the piozza. It is fresh, good and not overly expensive. We then decided to take a look at the Casino. You need to show your passport to get in, locals have to pay an entrance fee. While almost all public places in Singapore are smoke free, this doesn't apply to the casino. The smoke level was so bad we could last 10 minutes. I would not recommend going to the casino if you have any issues with smoking odors. All in all it worth going to see the complex but how much time you want to spend depends on whether you are eating, shopping, or both."
,,Disappointing trip,3.0,,"We went to the bar area which was not cheap but there were no seats. Since we went for the views we stayed, very crowded for 2 hours (to see day into night)
Would have been better on the observation platform which meant a fee but no drinks"
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,Although expensive it is well worth a trip up to the viewing deck. You can't access the hotel and I would have loved to as this is where the infinity pool is. What an amazing structure. The views are amazing and I would recommend to do this just once. The shopping centre below is amazing. Didn't go into the casino but have heard it is fantastic. YOu could spend a whole day in this area. The skypark is good and I am glad I did it.
,,"Beautiful views, good food",4.0,,"If you have time and are willing to spend some money for dinner go to sky57 restaurant (you don't have to be staying at the hotel to eat here), the food is good but nothing extra ordinary, the view though is well worth the money you spend."
,,What a vista,4.0,,"Visited this in the daytime and had a wonderful view of the city from the 56th floor. Adult Cost was 23 singapore dollars or 20 if a senior citizen, may seem a little expensive but I think worth it.
When to the Skybar on the 57th floor atc night and this was spectacular. Drinks expensive though."
,,"Ku De Ta, unforgettable!",4.0,,"Best part is the location, 57th floor of Marina Bay Skypark. But minimum order rates seemed non-relevant."
,,Good view but too pricey,4.0,,"Nice view. Better here after sunset and at night. It opens until 10pm on weekday and 11pm on weekend. It cost SGD 23. To me its a bit expensive entrance fee among any other skyscrapers, been in Macau Tower, Tokyo Sky tree.. Maybe because sky park located in high class area.."
,,Stunning City! Stunning View!,5.0,,"We visited mid morning on a February Sunday. There were no queues for tickets (which cost Sing$ 20 for old folks) and after the briefest stop for the usual photo we were whisked to the top where amazingly the photo was mounted and available to purchase if required. The views are truly breathtaking, especially looking over the city and Marina Bay. Given that most of the top structure is given over to hotel guests and what must be a truly memorable infinity pool, the public area is spacious and, Given the space we felt would benefit from a coffee but, that aside we really enjoyed the experience."
,,Don't pay - have a drink!,5.0,,"Four of us visited during the day just before Chinese New Year.

Don't bother purchasing tickets. This only gets you to a small side section at the top and you can do nothing but stand and take in the (spectacular) views of Singapore.

Go to the reservations desk and say you want to go for a drink. Access to the bar and restaurant is free. You can just have a drink in either (not sure if you would be expected to eat in the restaurant if it were very busy) and soak up the views at your leisure. The cost of the drinks is less than the ticket would have been. No brainer!

We lingered over drinks for an hour. Lovely."
,,What a view,5.0,,The Singapore Flyer was a great way to enjoy the city sights from above. The largest wheel in the world by 5 metres.
,,Great view,4.0,,Great view but disappointed we didn't have better access to other areas on the roof. Higher than the flyer.
,,Expensive but amazing,3.0,,As expected the views are amazing but there is no seating and you are not allowed into the restaurant unless you are a hotel guest.
,,Amazing structure,4.0,,"Although one cannot get in to the pool area, there is a spot where you can see it and so take some pictures. Awesome view of Singapore, and well worth it. TIP - if you present your boarding pass you can get some discount off the price of your ticket."
,,A must to visit!,5.0,,What a great place to visit. The views are immense and its just a great place to be to watch the sun set over Singapore with a drink in your hand!
,,"Good place to view Singapore skyline, Gardens by the bay, Merlion and Flyer",5.0,,Go around the evening time but make sure you reach there before the sunset as there might be huge queue at the ticketing counter. When you are on the SkyPark make sure you stay for a while after the sunset as the Singapore skyline view looks fantastic under the lights. You could also see the lights show at 7.45pm at Gardens by the bay from top of sky park. The MRT stn to reach this place is BAYFRONT.
,,awsome veiws,4.0,,"awesome views, no concessions for the disabled as I am, lovely breeze on the top, went straight into The Ku Da Ta Resturant for cocktails sooooooo expensive infact all Singapore expensive :)"
,,Awesome piece of engineering,5.0,,If you enjoy shopping and afterwards a nice drink with a extremely nice view go here! You can go up for free to the bar and if you are with 3 people you can go up buy drinks and spend less money than in the situation that you have to buy tickets for the view!
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Just by looking at the towers is already unbelievable. It was just WOWWW. The view from the top was breathtaking.
,,Amazing views!!,5.0,,"It cost $23 each to go up to the top to the sky park which sits on the 56th floor of the marina bay sands building which is iconic in itself. Once you get to the top you see the most amazing views as you walk the small arch that is the park as most of the rooftop is the hotel swimming pool, there are notices that show you what you are seeing from the deck it gives you a brief history of a few iconic sites.

The view from the skypark is breathtaking you are allowed to spend as much time up there as you like there is a shop where you can get drinks or souvenirs. Definitely worth a visit !!"
,,What a view,5.0,,"Went to 57th floor for view unable to go to pool as hotel guests only which I understand as very busy there, but we had a drink in the bar next door where you can view the pool ,views are incredible well worth the look drinks not cheap but the view made up for it."
,,a great way to see singapore,4.0,,"It costs a bucket load, but the sight is once in a life time. it is really a great way to see Singapore! It is a boat in the sky and something you definitely need to tick off your bucket list! I enjoyed it but if you have an issue with heights (like I do) I would be careful! It was beautiful and definitely worth it. While you are there, check out the Marina Bay hotel as well, as it is equally lush and beautiful!"
,,Crazy modern architecture with the best view of Singapore,4.0,,"The Skypark is an amazing piece of engineering looking like a huge ship parked on top of the Marina Bay Hotel.
The general access area is on a massive cantilevered section of the park and provides probably the best views of Singapore city, the harbour, docks and the surrounding see full of ships.
The views are incredible but not for the people with a fear of heights!

There is a café and shop on the deck for you spend a little money.
Don't forget your camera for this trip!

My only disappointment was that the infinity swimming pool is for hotel residents only...guess I know where I will be staying on my next visit!"
,,Tick the box,4.0,,"You can't help but to be drawn to this magnificent building if you are a tourist in Singapore as it can be seen so easily from many parts of the city. Yes the viewing platform has shrunk in size I guess to give privacy to guests staying in the hotel but this does not harm the spectacular views.

It costs approx £12 for a fast lift to the top where there is a small shop and refreshment area but if you arrive near to lunchtime then put that money towards food and eat in one of the restaurants on the same or even higher level. Just check out dress code when booking.

We were going to do the adjacent Singapore Flyer but this building dwarfs it so we give it a miss."
,,Boat in the sky,4.0,,My friend really wanted to go up to the observation deck so after a MRT trip to area we crossed a walkway from train right into the middle and up high into the Hotel. That is a work of art to see. Then go down to purchase ticket to go up to observation deck. Great view. Back down and you will find a coffee shop inside near lifts that is really reasonable. Especially where it is.
,,Good place to view the city,4.0,,"This was a good place to see the city. Would be good for kids and adults and was reasonably priced. Easy to get to, the cable cars gave a nice view."
,,Great view that's it,3.0,,"I think looking at this attraction from the airplane or from the ground is much better than going to it . Certainly the viewed are sharing but the bar concepts are clumsy , not too friendly and expensive"
,,On top of the world,4.0,,"This is one of the most beautifully designed modern building I have ever seen and to arrive to the very top of it by elevator, was really exciting. The view from up there is really amazing, but the space reserved to tourists is somewhat limited. The swimming pool area, which is the second attraction, after the view, is reserved to hotel guests only.
I wish I had known ahead of time that by making a dinner reservation for one of the restaurants, I could have avoided paying the ticket price. Oh well, hopefully, there will be a next time....."
,,One reason to stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel,5.0,,"Stayed for one night at the Marina Bay Sands to be able to enjoy the full part of the Sky park, including the wonderful infinity pool. The infinity was not feeling crowed at all, and all guest services was very friendly and helpful."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Amazing building. High speed lift to the viewing area, fantastic views across the bay. Suggest an evening visit then you can enjoy a musical water feature down on the quay. Brilliant photo opportunities."
,,Great view,4.0,,"We were running out of time trying to get in as much sights to see and places to go to, thus leaving us no choice but to go at 8 in the evening---- and, wow, should have done this the first time!!!! Needless to say, the view was spectacular!!!! It was a cool, clear night with the wind mildly blowing......and the Singapore night lights spread out below you..... Hey its pretty romantic, too!!!"
,,Beautiful Views but is it worth the price?,4.0,,"You can go up to the 56 floor for around $25 but you can only go on the observation deck. At the last minute I noticed a sign while buying my ticket that if you have reservations to one of the restaurants you do not need to pay the entrance. You might as well do that and eat or drink.
The view was great, especially over looking Gardens of the Bay!"
,,Fantastic views!,5.0,,"Just outside of Tower 3 of the ground floor Sands Marina Bay Hotel. Wasn't busy when we went just after lunchtime. No queue for tickets. Elevator quickly whisks you up to the observation deck [floor 56?]. There was an optional included lunch on floor 57 which we did not consider. The observation deck was spectacular. Great views of the bay, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flier, Singapore skyline. The Observation deck only makes up ~15% of the overall deck space. The rest is for hotel guests, swimming pool etc. Well worth doing. Once back down to the ground floor cross over to ""Shoppes by the Bay""...amazing shopping center...as are most in Singapore."
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,"My Wife and I spent a good few hours at this beautiful park.
There are fantastic views of the city's skyline.
It is very picturesque the gardens are amazing
There is also a kids play splash area...................
Beautiful
And it's free apart from the indoor garden dome."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,Really gorgeous 360 degree views of the bay and city. Lots of beautiful photo opportunities. We spent about 30 min taking in the view.
,,Great place to entertain and chill especially in the evenings,5.0,,"A ""must visit"" place if you are visiting Singapore...or even when you are local. Premium fashion and good selection of food, with a couple if places of interest like the Garden by the Bay and The Flyer at close proximity."
,,Great looking Hotel and casino good location,4.0,,Clients of mine returned and told me that they really like the hotel. Restaurants are great a little pricey on some of the venues. The view is fabulous.
,,something deffirent,5.0,,"This is something that you need to see
no place like it
really amazing view that will make you day
worth every penny that you will pay to enter skylark or to stay in marina bay sand hotel
day and night the view is great and the environment is very amusing

the only thing that i didn't like was the water was so cold ! you need some time to get used to it !

Highly Highly Recommended place to visit"
,,Great view,5.0,,Worth to go up! But if u have to pay the 20 sd go to the hotel and get a drink for that price and don't only pay for the view ;)
,,Spectacular view but go at night to see the show from above,4.0,,"I would compare the view from here to something like Taipei 101 although the latter is much taller. Go at night, you will want to see the show at Marina Bay with all its lasers, color changing fountains, and torches from above. The skyline at Marina Bay is spectacular comparable to Hong Kong, perhaps better. Worth the admission fee."
,,Relaxing,4.0,,"Spend a relaxing day at the pool, have lunch, people watch and if u stay at the hotel your visit is free. The view is spectacular"
,,"Fun time, night or day",4.0,,The Sky Park is a lot of fun. I think you need to experience it during the day and at night as you get two completely different experiences. During the day you can have fun in the pool and take a look around the city and get great pictures of all the fantastic views. At night time you can see all of the building lighted up but you cannot really get a sense for the area because it is dark. The pictures do not turn out that great at night either. It is also fun at the night club but make sure you don’t wear sandals as they will not get you in.
,,Out of this world architecture. But you have to pay to get up to the top.,4.0,,"Access to the Skypark is not free. Oherwise, the hotel was fantastic. Great architectural landmark. Accessible via MTR."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,We were staying in the hotel so did not have to pay for entry to the Skypark. It really is a sensational view from atop Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Well worth a visit to Ku De Ta - for at least one expensive cocktail.
,,"Nice view, limited experience",3.0,,"Going up to the Skypark is interesting, but even for seniors (special rate) relatively expensive. Visitors are fenced in into a small limited area, the rest is for hotel guests (might be worthwhile to spend one night in the hotel). The view is, however, splendid."
,,AWSOME,5.0,,What an amazing sight. We walked through the lobby with our mouths wide open in awe! Probably THE most impressive building I have ever seen. We did not go to the very top sadly. There was not much information on what we would see up there and have discovered since that we missed out. We DID take the outside elevator up to a walking park and the scenery was beautiful.
,,Far East Trip,5.0,,"Absolutely incredible view from the top of the hotel, certainly worth the entrance fee. You can see the whole of the city and outlying areas from this vantage point and ,all of the vessels waiting to come into port, the Formula track is just underneath
Its in a wonderful clean area and its a nice walk to Clarkes Quay
for refreshments."
,,Bad Weather ends Play,4.0,,"Bad weather, and maybe the wrong time of the day.

It was raining when we got there so the outside bar was closed, we hand a light lunch that was fine little expensive, then were allowed to go out side and enjoy the fresh air.

Try and go on a clear day we did see the city but I think a late afternoon view would be better. Saying that Gardens by the bay beats this any day... But worth the visit but if you are on limited time do the gardens by the bay Instead."
,,"Great view from top, but not worth enough for the money",4.0,,"If you are not a guest at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel then for sure you have to purchase a ticket for S$20 (in 2013 Nov) to go to the Skypark at the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There is only a little space (around 1000 sqft) in the Skypark for you to walk around. If you are planing to have a ride in the Singapore Flyer, this may not worth for the money you spend.
Good part is that you can also view the three countries (Singapore, Malaysia & Indonesia) from the Skypark (Also you can view all of them from the Singapore Flyer too).
Better to avoid rainy time because they will close the Skypark because of the high wind & lighting at the roof top. In such situation they will refund your money for the ticket you paid. Late evening (from 5.30pm) would be the ideal time to visit Skypark. Then you can get the view of Day time and Night time also. It is a very spectacular view in the night."
,,Nice view and swimming pool,5.0,,The view is excellent. A bit expensive if you are not hotel guest. The atmosphere is relaxed and enjoyable. It is a bit cold to swim in winter.
,,Amazing views not to be missed,5.0,,"We were lucky to get some timely advice not to pay to go to the observation deck - a small area with limited facilities - and instead take the internal lift to the restaurant at the top, this will save you S$23 per adult, give you much more extensive views and the chance to enjoy good quality food in one of the two eating areas which were reasonable for what was offered and the location. We spent two very relaxed hours at the top during the middle of the day and would certainly recommend this to others. Note that there is no access to the swimming pool unless you are a hotel guest and that if you visit in the evening, a smart casual dress code applies."
,,Money grabbing,3.0,,Great view from the sky deck but definately not worth the $24 elevator ride. They then try and sell you a photo as well (they should include that in the entry price).
,,Excellent View from Top,4.0,,It offers an excellent view of the Singapore skyline. Recommend to visit late evenings/night. Pool visits are now stopped and available for hotel guests only.
,,It's OK,3.0,,"If you like paying money for a view from upon high it's a good thing to do.

But you can also pay for a view from upon high at other places which also includes a free drink.

Frankly, it's better to be upon high somewhere else and looking at the beauty of The Marina Bay Sands buildings, rather than being on MBS and looking at more ordinary buildings."
,,Spectacular view of the Lion City,4.0,,"A quick transport to the 57th floor and you are in for an ecstatic view of the city, specially in the evening. But not a must see."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,The Skypark at Marina Bay Sands provides visitors with a great view of Singapore and is amazing either at night or during the day. I have visited this a couple of times with different people and the last time was as day turned to night and the lights of city came on. It was a lovely view. The only problem for some people would be the cost - particularly if you are a family.
,,Surfing the hotel,4.0,,Fantastic view from the top of the hotel on a surfboard looking structure. A bit expensive but a must see. You can wander round the top looking over Singapore
,,Stunning,5.0,,The view of the Marina bay is stunning from the Sands Sky Park. The high speed wind would make you feel like flying watching the picturesque landscape Singapore Offers.
,,Tourist attraction not worth the money,2.0,,Views of the harbor but not worth the money. Better off getting s drink in the restaurant and not having people in your way
,,Nice view,4.0,,"we had visited in afternoon time as we not had evening time to go. we had a great view. but but we felt that when they charging so much why cant they provide seating if I can understand its space problem then why cant atleast they provide shades . I was my kids but have to leave within 15 min as sun was staring at us. and as their is not shades to stand and watch we had to leave.
but have good concept of sky park to see Singapore skyscrapers"
,,It must be one of the Architectural highlights,5.0,,"Even though I live in Singapore, I never get sick of the sight of the Marina Bay complex & I always find the sky park one of the first places I look to take visitors. With Ku De Ta there is a great place to eat/drink & if you are fortunate to be able to spend the day by the pool, then its a spectacular highlight"
,,Great views!,4.0,,"Great views of Singapore and perfect photo opportunities. My tip is not to go up on a windy day. Morning or late afternoon is best for photos due to the sun. It can get busy but it's pretty big up there. You will be mesmerised by the various views on offer of Singapore. You will see the CBDS, the Merlion, Youth Olymics Park, the Singapore Flyer, Gardens By The Bay and the ocean. The views are simply breathtaking!"
,,Good Views but not at all user/tourist friendly,2.0,,"Views are good of the CBD, Harbour and Gardens by the Bay etc, and that in itself is quite pleasant. But.... they charge a premium to get into a place which considering it is pitched at passing toursits has poor facilities. Drinks and snack prices are exhorbitant (bring plenty of money if you are a group or a family) and staff are not all customer friendly.

Like much of Singapore lots of rules guiding the circumstances under which you are there as a visitor and security staff aplenty to enforce them. Case being the 'No Sit Down on the observation deck rule' which is printed on about every 3rd or 4th glass panel that acts as the safety barrier on and around the observation deck.

Now while that might seem like a simple enough proposition and I fully accept it from a safety point of view, the glaring ommission that exists at this observation deck is that there is absolutely no seating anywhere what so ever at this site. So there is Do not sit on the deck rule that is rigorously and enthusiastically enforced by the security staff, but there is nowhere to go and sit, so in short the operators/managers of this site have provided no alternative facility.

I had a verbal exchange with a security person after I had I sat down to eat my snack and drink my drink. I sat down because because it is difficult and uncomfortable to eat and drink while standing. When I protested to the guard the lack of seating of course the security guard had no alternative to offer me and just ordered me to stand up. His was a single function task which was to order me (an many other tourists who had also sat down on the deck because of the lack of facilities), to stand up. This activity by security was continous and ongoing as various people sat down on the deck due to the lack of seating facilities.

For a tourist facility such as this that serves (expensive) food and drink, and charges a premium for entry it is unaccpetable and quite inexusable that have chosen to omit seating for visitors.

The cynical side of me can only imagine two reasons as why this has been done. The provision of seating would detract from the aesthetics’ of the site (ie outdoor all-weather seating is too ugly and does not suit the tone of the site) or if visitors get too comfortable during their visit they will stay too long and not move on of their own accord in a timely fashion which I believe is the more likely case. I suspect it this mechanism is there to keep the crowds moving on, but it is not conducive to a good experience particularly for family groups who may have been out for much of the day and are with tired infants or adults for that fact that just want to have a bit of a sit and relax with a beverage or snack for a moment.

In short a worthwhile view but an expensive and not a friendly or welcoming experience"
,,Had to be done,3.0,,"I couldn't not visit this place and sure enough, once you get to the top, the views are spectacular.

The whole area is clean and safe with plenty of space. There is a kiosk selling soft drinks and beer as well as snacks but not really anywhere to sit down and eat.

There are a couple of bars and restaurants at the very top but these are restricted to hotel residents so those of us staying in other nearby hotels were denied the chance to eat or drink in comfort.

Also note that if you are wanting to see the infinity pool that the hotel is famous for, you are limited to peaking over a fence which separates the general public from paying guests (to be honest it looked a lot more like a Butlins play pool than the exotic infinity pool in the brochures)

But as I say, it had to be done for the views alone"
,,Visiting the top,1.0,,Accessed by going through the hotel lobby - felt a bit like being steerage passengers on the titanic Nice view but overpriced and the greenery you see from the ground builds up your expectations to something that's not there for you to see
,,Nothing special,1.0,,"We originally wanted to have drinks at the bar but were informed there was a dress code, and (forgive me for not bringing my tuxedo on holidays) weren't allowed in. You also aren't allowed anywhere near the pool unless you are staying at the hotel, which is fair enough I suppose. But the staff were rude and had a bit of attitude whilst informing us of this. I've encountered this phenomenon before in some places where staff (having spent so much time there) start thinking they own the place. Anyway, they said we can go up to the viewing platform instead. There is a minor cost involved and since we were there anyway went up for a look only to be greeted by hordes of people just sitting on the edges doing nothing. It's very difficult trying to go near the edge for a photo from all the people just ""sitting around"". No idea why. Either way you don't really see anything different here than you would at the Singapore Flyer nearby. It really wasn't worth the trip or giving the staff the enjoyment of telling you off with their noses in the air. And to think we nearly chose to stay here, so glad we didn't."
,,Good views,4.0,,Expensive but worthwhile. The views across singapore are pretty spectacular. It's a shame we wasn't allowed into the swimming pools. But I'll survive.
,,Missed this :(,4.0,,"Make sure you go this place Marine bay sands hotel, underground counter at end of third tower and collect tickets entry, a little costly, but should be worth it. View infinity pool, prefer going in evening, stay till city lights come up"
,,Nice Place to celebrate New Year Eve!,4.0,,"Please book in advance if you intend to celebrate New Year Eve 2015/2016...
The love the swimming pool. My room was without the balcony. The room is spacious and clean. The bathroom is big, not cramp.
You need to bear with the crowd at the lobby (in-house guest and public), once you check in on the day of new year eve, try to have meals in the hotel / MBS, don't drive...you would be stuck at traffic!!!!"
,,Sunset,4.0,,"Sunset is the best time to take a cocktail in the Sky Bar.
Crazy expensive as you would expect & mega busy.
The views are amazing.
We tried to get a table in the restaurant but nothing available until after 10pm. Surprisingly good value for such a popular restaurant so worthwhile booking ahead.
Worth the visit."
,,Great view,4.0,,"With only a few hours in Singapore (there as a stop over) we still spent a couple of hours up on the skypark. We went up before sunset, and stayed to watch the sunset and the city lights come on, there is also a laser light show on the bay - but it isnt that impressive. Enjoyable but possible the Skypark isnt the best spot for viewing the laser show as alot of the show is coming from the sands hotel. That being said worth the visit. The skypark isnt an ok size, you can purchase snacks and merch up there to if so inclined."
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited on 26 Jan 15. Points to Note:-

1. Must visit place in Singapore.
2. Check Deals on official site /GROUPON as well. Better to book online.
3. Try to be there before Sunset so you can take the photos in evening.
4. Wait for the dark when lights on buildings and other places start putting on.
5. You will get mesmerising clicking views.
6. Enjoy the beautiful evening with your beloved."
,,Short but impressive and memorable visit,4.0,,"Our visit here was too short, maybe barely an hour or more, but it's worth it. A realization of what we only see on pictures or on the net. We did not fully appreciate the beautiful skyline coz we were there only until around 7:00 pm. As you know, even if it's already 7pm, it's still bright as daylight coz the sun has not set down yet. Hence, the building and city lights we not lighted on yet. Generally, it's very overwhelming to see a grand architecture such as the Marina Bay Sands. The pool atop is incredible, the view is spectacular, breath-taking and amazing. We have no problem getting on top. Thanks to our companion who served as our guide. She is a permanent resident but pinay, the daughter of the condo unit where we stayed during our stay in SG. They were our hospitable sponsors during our short getaway in SG from Jan 30 to Feb 2, 2015."
,,Perfect View,5.0,,One of the sites you need to visit while in town. Huge building with lots of restaurants. Selected areas available for tourists so keep in mind the infinity pool area is only open for staying guests.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"We went while it was still light but stayed until it was dark. View is fantastic in the light, but is spectacular at night with everything lit up"
,,Wow wish I had the money to stay here...,4.0,,Love the building and the pool really looked like fun. Very good view of the skyline. Was a little difficult figuring out how to get over there from the mall/casino but it worked out.
,,Top view,4.0,,"This has to be done once. Not too expensive and great views. Camera essential. Not too crowded if you choose earlier times, and well documented information about the city easily seen."
,,Great view and drinks,5.0,,"Fantastic atmosphere, wonderful drinks and amazing views. If you wanttovisit the bar then it's best to bress smart casual avoiding shorts!..... Just do it!"
,,Definitely worth the trip,5.0,,We had wondered about staying in the Marina Bay Sands hotel but opted for a smaller one in the end but the evening trip up to the top of the skypark was definitely worth the ticket price and the short wait to get up there. We had a couple of cocktails up there and took some photographs and felt truly special and on top of the world. A beautiful place to spend an evening if you don't mind sharing it with lots of other people
,,Strange,3.0,,"From the ground floor looking up this looks spectacular but once up on floor 57, in the fastest lifts I've been in, it is strange peering throught the hotel guests in the pool out to the view beyond."
,,For the rich'es,4.0,,Its super cool with all rich people walking across & awesome buildings. Lots of people jog here after their work....Nice river nearby and the famous Merlion (lion spitting water statue)....good experience !!!
,,Is it the pool you are coming for?,5.0,,"We had a great buffet dinner downstairs and later a chance to walk on top through the sky park. What we wanted to see was the endless pool as everybody talks about it. It indeed is long and impressive, yet, pictures gave us a different expectation. This day ALL 2500 rooms were booked out, therefore the pool was filled with people, but you might have still found a chair for yourself. Nice to see once walking along it, probably much better once you have a chance for a dip (had no swimming gear with us). A wonderful view, both day and night. Thinking bout going to see it? Do it. But make sure you spend quite some time for getting the best out of the entrance fee ;-)"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"Never miss this opportunity, did it at night as part of a tour and would do it again, The view was indescribable, we were lucky enough to see the second flower dome display at the Gardens By the Bay, take your camera as the photos we took are amazing."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,This is one place that should be top of your list! Have a drink in the bar and get there before it gets dark so you see all of the lights going on. I was there with work colleagues but would love to take my husband there! It's the only place that I could match with New York views! Fantastic!! Be warned drinks expensive!
,,"Avoid the Observation Deck, Go to a Bar/Restaurant",2.0,,"sited the top viewing platform back in mid January. My first experience was the counter staff, who were very unenthusiastic, sadly this was a sign of what was to come. Someone had booked the top out for a party, so we only had a limited time at the top. There were trailing cables, cases, speakers, boxes all over the place, very untidy and lots of trip hazards. They also started to sound check by blasting loud music at us, this really ruined the experience for me.

Yes there are some great views, but you only get to walk around half the top, unless you’re a hotel guest, so you don't get to see all the views. It is very expensive for what it is. I would recommended going up to the cocktail bar on the same level, and buying a drink, as this is free and you get the same views!"
,,360 degree views,5.0,,"I was advised to go to the 57th floor bar, this is actually above the observation deck and you only have to buy a drink as opposed to the fee for the deck. There are bars in both directions as you come out of the lifts. To the right you get a view over the infinity pool - guests of the hotel only, and to the left another bar with views in the opposite direction. I wasn't hurried or hassled and took my time. There was no queues for the lifts in either direction, so was a lovely relaxing visit"
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"Been here many times. If you want to avoid the Skypark charges then why not drink or done at Ku De Ta? It's one of the more expensive places to eat or drink in Sg but worthwhile if you're not on a right budget or doing it for a special occasion.

The pool is only for hotel guests but you get almost 360 degree views up here. On a clear day you can see Malaysia (Johor Bahru) and Indonesia.

If you happen to be in Singapore from late June to early Aug then I would recommend coming here around 6-730pm as there'll be amazing National Day rehearsals with real fire works and you get to see things like the helicopters, jets, boats, tanks (etc) - all out on display for the parade practice."
,,The Best View,5.0,,"This must be the best view of Singapore. And getting there can be fun too!
If you're not too hot, you can walk around the harbour. Otherwise one of the train lines will take you. The Marina Bay Sands Mall is spacious and HUGE, and apart from elite brand shops, has an unusual 'fountain' and also it's own ice skating rink. Both of which you can watch while sitting for a coffee.
The Skywalk is well signposted, the rapid lift smoothly takes you to the platform, and photos of yourself are available if you want them. Souvenirs and drinks are available on the roof.
The view is breathtaking: over the harbour to the Merlion, Singapore Flyer, St Andrews Cathedral, Raffles and the main financial business district. Out too sea you will see amazing numbers of ships waiting to load or unload at the port, as well as the Rainforest Park. The busy port and the large oil tank farm are also visible.
The view helps to orient yourself to this part of Singapore, and worth the price - $23 per adult. We spent an hour there. So much to see."
,,Good views,5.0,,Great views of Singapore but took so long to get back down as there were only 3 lifts & a long queue waiting
,,The best place to view Singapore's Sky Line,5.0,,Brilliant..Simply Amazing....Breathtaking views of Singapore's Sky Line. A treat to the eyes.Try to reach early by dusk to enjoy both the views before and after it gets dark
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,We felt that we had to visit this iconic building.We went to the desk at Tower Three and asked to have a drink in the bar.We were sent to 57th floor where we had a very reasonable beer and enjoyed the views and the view of the infinity pool from the Club Room.All the staff were very welcoming and all for the price of a drink!
,,Impressive view and price!,3.0,,"Yep, this place was crazy expensive. We got a 'tip' from a helpful staff person who let us know that you can go up to the Skybar bar right next to the observation deck for free, rather than pay the steep price to go to the obs deck. Sounded great....but then you sort of have to buy a drink (talked to a lady who got hassled 3 times by wait staff because she didn't have a drink in her hand!) and the drinks are VERY expensive. It appears that the pool and skypark are only open to casino guests.....well we couldn't find a way to get there even after asking around. But that aside....it is a very impressive building with a spectacular view! We went there on dusk and watched the sun go down and the city light up."
,,Touristy but worth it -- great views,5.0,,"OK, it's become a popular tourist spot, but it deserves to be so. From the top you can see gorgeous views of Singapore -- particularly fun at night. The lights and water are beautiful."
,,"excellent view, nice place for a drink",5.0,,"Don't pay for the entrance fee, just go up to the skybar for a drink. Drinks are not over the top expensive and even the restaurant looked reasonable prices (didn't try the food). had a nice glass of white wine with excellent panoramic view of Singapore. highly recommended!"
,,Don't like heights but.,5.0,,After a lovely day walking around Gardens by the Bay stopped at Marina Sands for a well earned refreshment or two. Up we went to the 57th floor. What a 360 view.
,,view to remember,5.0,,"Disliked that the rooftop restaurant was for hotel guests only, especially paying over $30 per person to access the view. Liked the amazing view over the city, port and beyond."
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,"This appears to be Singapore's newest go to place - a ship built on top of 3 tall towers so decided to book ticket to go to the top to the 'skypark' to see what it was all about. When you look at it, you think you will get to into the whole area but no, it is only one end of it with a viewing platform and a bar above. The rest of the 'skypark' is for hotel guests only featuring an infinity pool and restaurants - fair enough but would have been good to know as probably wouldn't have bothered.

Had a couple of drinks at the bar - they have a sort of dress code but suspect anyone who wants to spend money would get in and drinks the normal £12-£15 each."
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,Buy a ticket and go up to the Marina Bay Sands observation deck and you will get an amazing view over Singapore! Go before the sun goes down and you get to see Singapore in daylight and when it's dark and it all lit up. Really beautiful :)
,,Don't Waste Your Time,2.0,,Simply not worth the time and cost not even a welcome drink in spite of the cost - go to Jurong Bird Park instead!
,,Costly and excellent view,4.0,,"Near to cloud forest, gardens by the bay. Note: ticket to the skybridge is very costly. If you are travelling by MRT and want to go to gardens by the bay and Marina Bay, get down at Marina Bay Sands station."
,,A Must See - Best in early evening,4.0,,I highly recommend as a way to end the day. It costs $20 to go the observation deck on the 56th floor but free if you are going to the bar or restaurant on the 57th floor. However a tall glass of beer is $26.50 without tip! So look at it as $20 for the view and $6.50 for the beer. Reservations are probably necessary for the restaurant. The bar is quite crowded before sunset and few places to sit. Plan on nursing a drink until the crown thins out but then you will be treated to a magnificent view of the city and harbor. Close by islands of Indonesia and also Malaysia visible in the distance.
,,Better than Singapore Flyer,4.0,,"Becoz of limited time I could visit one of Marina bay and Singapore flyer. Glad I made this decision. You can spend as much time as you want at the top observation deck. Best time is 30 minutes before sunset so u can have both of day and night views. The restaurant at top is expensive so take ur drink with you, and food if u r with kids."
,,Absolutely Stunning Experience,5.0,,"We've been travelling for 6 months and have experienced the obersvation decks at the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and the GM Renessaince Center in Detroit. We've also had at least a dozen other chances in other cities to do their version. Shortly put, there isn't another oppurtunity like this one, it is by far the best.

The biggest difference is most observation decks limit your viewing time because there is limited space at the top and always other people waiting to get up. Here this is not the problem as there obsevation deck has significantly more space than others. Once you recieve a ticket you can go up anytime (closes at 10 PM) and stay up as long as you want to.

We went up a 6 PM and stayed up until about 8:30 PM. This allowed us to see both the day time, sunset and nighttime views. At the top there are a few drinks and light food available.It is a bit pricey though.

A few other tips:

If possible go on a week night (we did).

In hinesight I would have taken a bit more food/drinks up as they did not check our bags.

Go up at 6PM and stay there until 8:30 PM to see daylight, sunset and nighttime views. After go down and watch the light show at Gardens by the Bay, starting at 8:45 PM. To get there you have to leave the main skypark building, walk out to the main street and follow the sidewalk to the approximate middle of the buidling where there is an elevator. Take the elevator to the pedestrian bridge and from there you have access to Gardens by the Bay and the light show. The light show is only 12 minutes long so be quick."
,,"Love it or hate it, but go to the top",4.0,,"Ok. You might not like the building. I certainly do not. An ugly wall between the Fullerton side and the Sea. On the other hand, it is and will be a future landmark of Singapore. And a trip up there is worth it just for the view. So you should go. And you will have even more cred talking it down afterwards."
,,On top of the world,5.0,,"This is a must visit for anyone visiting Singapore - I believe a person must always seek to gain a view that encompasses any city they're visiting to gain perspective of their overall experience there. The view is awe-inspiring and a helpful tip is [we went with some locals who taught us this] if you just want the view and don't want to pay the fee to enter Skypark, let the staff who police the lifts up to the top know, that you are visiting the bar only - That way you get the same view and are adjacent to Skypark, so can still see the pool and you end up sitting in the bar area relaxing and having a refreshing drink with the money it would've cost you for the same view from Skypark."
,,Must see in Singapore!,5.0,,The entry coasts 23$. If you would like go to the roof top bar (over skypark) - go to the hotel's reception. The entry to bar is 30$ (1 drink included).
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"This is a must if you visit Singapore. Its fairly expensive, but the view from 56 floors up is brilliant. We went during the day and we could pick out many of the Singapore landmarks. Its a pity they do not allow you to visit the bar from the Skypark. You have to either book a meal at the restaurant or be a hotel guest."
,,AMAZING VIEWS!!,5.0,,"When in Singapore, this is a must do experience. This building looks like nothing on earth and the views were incredible!! We thought it excellent value for £10 each!"
,,Best View of Singapore ever,5.0,,"Mind blowing view from 56th Floor of Marina Bay Sands Skypark... Amazing crowd and feel... Worth Visiting. PS: Don't miss skypark, if running short of budget, then skip Singapore flyer but don't miss Skypark."
,,Great views- money saving tip,5.0,,"My husband and I wanted to visit the Marina Bay Sands viewing tower and Ku De TA bar. We were in the marina bay shoppes on a Sunday and we wandered through to the sky park area and further to the Ku De Ta area. As it was a Sunday, dress code was casual until 5pm invludi g shorts, so we went up for a beer which was $sd 37 Inc gst for 2people. We had great views over Singapore, plus I asked could we go through to the club lounge and we were escorted through with our drinks and also got to see the infinity pool at the top. We think this was much better value rather than paying $20 sd each for the skypark"
,,I'm giving this 5 stars simply because it's a swimming pool on top of a skyscraper,5.0,,"... simple as that really. And I didn't even experience the pool!

It's a weirdly awesome looking building. I haven't stayed in the hotel but it's my dream to one day do that.

Me, my family and mam's friend paid to go to the top, all we did was look at the views, take pictures and envy the people lucky enough to be in that pool in the clouds, we still had an awesome time.

Oh the hotel itself inside is pretty awesome just to gawk at the extravagance."
,,Not worth the price,3.0,,"This was my second and last visit to the Marina Sands Skypark, at least as a non-hotel guest. Last time around the hotel was only recently opened and the trip to the gallery at the top of this magnificent building also allowed access to the bar and cocktails beside the infinity pool even if access to the pool itself was limited to hotel guests. On my trip skywards last week, however, the bar and poolside areas were restricted to hotel guests only. I can see why as it was crowded with hotel residents but the downside is that I feel that what remains is barely worth the expensive cost of S$25 per person. Maybe if this was my first visit I might have reveiwed it more positively but I really don't think so as there is really nothing up there except a platform with reasonable views that you can walk around for five minutes and take a few photos."
,,Put it on your Bucket List !!,5.0,,An experience for young and old enjoy the water and the view free towels and the service is excellent....
,,"Great view, but nothing to eat up there",4.0,,"Unless you're a guest at the hotel itself there's not a lot up there - we saw some excellent eateries available online, but when we got there we realised we could only have the hotdogs, of which 2/3 flavours were sold out. Still, nice view of the city and cool in the breeze."
,,Not worth the price,2.0,,"The queues and price are just not worth it. Great views but nothing else except overpriced souvenir and snack stands, with no shade whatsoever. Spend your money on the Flyer instead"
,,Must visit,5.0,,Definitely visit this amazing bar/ restaurant top floor Nice ambience. View of Singapore. Pleasant music. International people
,,My Best Experience Ever,5.0,,"We had a cocktail on the Floor 57, Sky Park and it was the best place to have a panoramic view of Singapore city. The view is amazing at the night. Most of the city attractions are very closed to here and its a marvelous experience to see almost all of them as a night bird from here."
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,Breathtaking views from here for nearly 360 degree's. Try and choose a non cloudy day. costs about S$25.00 per person.
,,Architectural marvel,5.0,,"I was here on a short sightseeing tour while on business in singapore. The hiotel is a sight in itself, but the rooftop pool/ park is amazing. One downside is that you cannot use the restaurant unless you are a guest- we would have loved to have lunch there. The ticket its a little pricey, but where else can iu have this experience? A must do for singapore."
,,Not so spectacular if you aren't a hotel guest,3.0,,"$20 something to go up to the observation deck only. Which is only the very front of the boat shaped skypark. You cannot go up to the pool or any other area up the top. We were disappointed because for some reason we were under the impression you could go up and use the pool. You can take a sneak peek round at it though from one corner of the observation deck. It's kool to say you have been up there but I think admission is overpriced for what you get, I reckon you can get equally just as good a view elsewhere, but I guess it's all about saying you went up the top of the hotel!"
,,On top of te world,5.0,,No words to explain the experience and feel that you get when you are there seeing the whole of Singapore from there.
,,Awesome views!,4.0,,Definitely worth the trip to come to the top of the towers. You get great views of the city both during the day and at night! I had come here during the F1 race and you get a great picture of the track from here!
,,A 'Ship' on Top of Buildings,5.0,,We went to the highest floor where we were only allowed to visit Kudeta. it was understandable since we were not staying in MBS hotel. The view was amazing. 2 hours with the dollars spent was worth the money
,,Must visit on Singapore trip.,5.0,,Boat shape restaurant on the top of building is glamours all round the year and its an identity of Singapore..Must visit for anyone.
,,The pool is unforgettable,4.0,,"Placed in the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel, its main attraction is the pool. There is an amazing infinity edge that seems to end in the sky. It is located 57 floors above the ground and from inside the pool you can enjoy a beautiful view of Singapore. There is also the restaurant ""Sky on 57"" where the Chef Justin Quek offers a mix of Asian and French cuisine. Do not miss."
,,Do not miss it!!!!!,4.0,,"The view is excellent from the deck, you must see it! The cost of entry is SGD 23 per person, then you end up on the 56th floor. You can go up one floor to 57th outside on the deck.
You can see the Gardens by the Bay, the Formula 1 racetracks, the Singapore Flyer and a floating soccer ground as well.
After coming down, pay a short visit to the Casino on the ground floor. The rotunda is awesome in there!"
,,An Amazing Complex,5.0,,From a far one marvels at the engineering ability to build these three towers then join them together on top with large boat design and to incorporate a skypark for the public to view Singapore. In saying that we were disappointed with the actual viewing area set aside for public viewing. One is confined to the pointed part of the skypark the rest is reserved for hotel guest and apartment owners. We paid and went up late afternoon along with hundreds of other people to view the lights and laser show. The show is much better viewed at ground level facing the building rather then standing on top of the skypark. Then after the show finished there is a long wait for the lifts to take you back down. When visiting Singapore and you have time by all means go up to the skypark but I think there is a lot better places to visit before hand then the skypark.
,,Awesome,5.0,,This is worth either the $22 or buying a cocktail in one of the bars up on top. Great views and like being on top of the world. There are 2 bars and a swimming pool up there and if you are a guest at the hotel there is a viewing terrace as well. I loved it and enjoyed my cocktail too
,,Great Views,3.0,,"It's worth at least one trip but was disappointed no seats unless you went in restaurant. As a pensioner it is hard to stay up there too long, it felt like we take your money have a quick look and go down again."
,,Great shopping for the Brand Hunter,5.0,,"Wow, excellent centre with a fanatic light water show on the promenade. Look out and book the serious celebrity chef restaurants on level 2."
,,Give it a miss unless you really have to go up!,5.0,,"The lift up to the skypark was very fast but once you are up there all you get to see are the views which are spectacular but you do not get to see the pool or get the chance to go into the bar for drinks. I was thoroughly disappointed with the experience and would never pay that kind of money for that kind of experience again.

That being said I can appreciate it if I were staying at the hotel I would probably object to people gawping at you around the pool area. Next visit I shall stay at the hotel!"
,,MBS Sky Park- a must visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"Sky park is an attraction you must visit when visiting Singapore! The view from that high up is absolutely Breathtaking!
Admission is not really expensive, the place is open in reasonable hours and once you're up there there's no time limit.
I recommend arriving around late afternoon so you get to see the view in daylight, enjoy a beautiful sunset and get a spectacular night view ."
,,The most happening place in Singapore,5.0,,The most happening place in Singapore. Best location. Very expensive - but still worth a try. Amazing crowd......breathe-taking ambience from the 60th floor....but really toooo expensive....go there and see for yourself one of the best places in singapore
,,Marina bay at singapore,5.0,,"very nice place at singapore. from there you can see all the singapore costal area. fresh air, good food and enjoy with a small bar."
,,Pretty cool place,4.0,,In reality it looks far better than you see it during the F1 races. Unfortunately it was raining the day I intended to go up to the Skypark.
,,Go to Ku De Ta!,5.0,,"I don't understand why folks don't go the restaurant instead. You can get food, drinks, AND the view for the price of the Skypark admission. Very nice views of the city."
,,Wonderful View,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit to the 56th floor. Luckily it was a very clear day so the view was amazing. They have a negative edge swimming pool on the 57th floor but only available to guests although you can see it from the observation area.
,,Sky is not the limit,5.0,,One can enjoy the whole scenery of beautiful Singapore from the Marina Bay Sands Sky park with the description in different languages.
,,"Views, views, views",4.0,,Talk about high up and amazing view of the harbor and Garden by The Sea. It was thrilling and there were so many lights at night.
,,Beautiful Skyline View of Singapore City and Harbor,4.0,,"We visited the roof top bar and restaurant for drinks and dinner. It is a beautiful view which makes it a little easier to accept the exorbitant prices charged but - location, location, location. You can go the roof area with buying drinks or dinner but the charge is more than it will cost if you go to the rooftop bar and just order a drink and enjoy the view. It is easy to get to this attraction by taxi which is very inexpensive."
,,Commanding view of Singapore,4.0,,"I'm sure on a clear day it would have been better nicer, the advantages of being this high is that I got to see the rain that ruined the rest of my day! The bar offers a nice vantage point and a seat if you can get one"
,,Stop over,4.0,,Worth a visit. View from top wonderful. Senior discount if you show pension pass even though it said locals only.
,,Pick a clear day and go,5.0,,Great city views and the perfect way to see S'pore and get a lay of the land. Worth the cost to go up for a look!
,,Fair,3.0,,Marina bay Sands Skypark is not really worth the money. I stayed I the hotel a few times and the guests of the hotel can use the worlds largest infinity pool on the 57 floor. its amazing but the Skypark is a viewing platform only. you cannot use the pool enter the guests area. so I think its a bit of a let down. better things to see and do in Singapore. its like getting into a great club but you cannot access the lounge. Anyway that's my opinion
,,Lovely views but expensive for what you get,3.0,,"for a family of four, this was expensive at $28.00 each. Whilst the view is great, it is hampered by the fact that you are limited to only a small section of the viewing deck as the bar and pool is for guests only. You get a good perspective of Singapore though and can see most landmarks including F1 track, Singapore Eye, Gardens and the river. Would not visit again as this is only worth doing once and is a little pricey."
,,Just OK,3.0,,We visited after the botanical gardens. Long walk through the very busy hotel. Good view but you can't visit hotel part or the infinity pool. I wouldn't bother going specially.
,,view from the top!,4.0,,"Took the trip to the 56th floor observation platform. Well worth the money (23 SD). View is excellent. Well informed maps etc around this large decked platform. Coffee shop, gift shop and restaurant if required. Definitely a talking point. Been there etc."
,,Great views but really limited.,3.0,,"I was actually disappointed. You get to go to the top of place but only actually see about 1/20th of the top area. The rest is blocked off for hotel guests. I get that. But then don't call it a Skypark, which insinuates something grander than what it is. If I knew then what I know now, I would have skipped it entirely."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"The view at this bar is simply amazing, but the crowds and the lines put us off. The architecture is very cutting edge but once you've seen it escape somewhere a little quieter and less crowded. A must see once."
,,Amazing views,3.0,,"Plan two visits to this great attraction. During a clear day you can see the beautiful surroundings, the blue water below and the beautifully designed buildings. However, it is at night that you can enjoy the beautiful lights coming from the Gardens and the city on the other side. Come ready to pay big bucks for a couple of drinks. The bar is nice, but the seating seems old and has a funky smell. It can get crowded at night so come early. Great experience."
,,See the city sparkle,5.0,,"The views might be similar, but the Skypark deck dwarfs the Singapore Flyer by quite a margin. Go for the sunset and see the city lights start to glow once the sun has said goodbye to the day.

Most certainly the most picturesque vistas of the city are from the Skypark."
,,Free to Hotel guest.,4.0,,I was stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It's free of charge to hotel guest. Just good look out singapore
,,Expensive but worth it if you want to kill time,3.0,,"The exorbitant price of the entrance is only beaten by the equally ridiculous pricing for the souvenir photo view shot with Marina Album which they charge($55) more than the entrance fee. But the camera views you could take truly is one of the best vantage points a tourist can have while in Singapore and if you want to rest your tired feet and kill some time before your next activity, then this may be your thing."
,,THE Hotel with view,4.0,,"The building itself is really very special. We arrived there with MRT and after the station the way toward the lifts for observation desk is not good marked and long. You must go outside from the building and in again. At the time of our visit there was no crowd. First you will see astic. beautiful Gardens by the Bay, with Sea sourrounding (full with ships). On the opposite side, the panoramic view of the city is really breathtaking. Time upthere is no limited. I was missing just a place to sit down and enjoying the view."
,,Great View! Very Windy!,4.0,,"We had the great pleasure of being able to come up to this roof deck with someone that works in marketing for this hotel. She was able to show us around and invite us up with ease. It was a beautiful sight to be able to see all over Singapore and see how beautiful it really is. It may be a one of the smallest countries, but it definitely has a lot going for them.

The hotel itself is just ok, but the rooms are spacious and the service is great!"
,,Okay overall,3.0,,"Some nice views of the area. Easy access, but would have liked some signs perhaps pointing out local features? Inexpensive, so happy enough to do the walk."
,,Recommended at night,4.0,,"I went up at night and the view with all the lights on is fantastic. If you time it right you can enjoy the light show of the Gardens by the Bay, which is quite nice. On the opposite side, the panoramic view of the city is breathtaking. There were no queues at 8:30pm on a Sunday and it was not very crowded on top."
,,Looking great,5.0,,This is new for my eye. I really like building Marina Bay. I love to take picture from this place and tell my friend that I am here now
,,Worth paying the fee to go to the top,4.0,,"If you are looking for a birds eye view then this is a great place to get it. I think this is better value than the wheel as you can spend as little or as much time as you want up there. It's a shame you can't go right around and go past the infinity pool on top but then again I guess guests of the hotel are entitled to their privacy. It's a great view over the gardens too and if you were wondering if you should go then this view will seal it for you.
The photos that they take of you before you head up the lift, whilst excellent quality are too expensive and let's face it how many of us put them up in the frame that they also try and sell you (again good quality) once we get home.
It can very very warm up the top so if you have a hat, I recommend you take it or an umbrella. Not a lot of shade up there!"
,,Great view but a bit expensive as a group,2.0,,"Its a bit expensive just to go up to take a picture of the city. Its much better to go to Ku De Ta for an evening cocktail, you then don't have to pay to go up and you get the pleasure of a refreshing drink for about the same as the entry"
,,Breathtaking Skyline,5.0,,"Not a free attraction but worth every dollar. You get a panoramic 360 degree's view of Singapore. While there, identify the buildings from afar and see if you can spot the famous Orchard Road or Clarke Key. On a clear day, Bukit Timah hill's can be spotted with ease. Enjoy the breeze and look how beautiful Singapore is. You can see the super trees located below and admire the boats park in neat sequence. Bring an umbrella along for it can rain or be quite warm. The Skypark sells souvenirs and also have a photo booth for you to take a picture as a momentous"
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"This was disappointing, it was obvious they don't want people up there, the restaurant is only available to house guests and you can't see the resort. Well worth the view but not sure that it is value for money."
,,Amazing Structure.,5.0,,Absolutely amazing building .. looks like it has come straight from Las Vegas ... It dominates the skyline & is a must visit place ..
,,Best full view of Singapore,5.0,,"Included in your hotel accomodation rate, definitely worth the trip up to level 57 beyond the pool and tower 3 to see this full view of Singapore. The only area you can't really see is Sentosa. Great at sunset."
,,Give it a go .....,5.0,,I hate heights but had to do his and glad i did as it gave outstanding views. Not good in the rain but if its sunny or dull out then give this a go.
,,Great View - A bit pricey though,4.0,,"The whole Marina Bay Sands complex is massive and impressive. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was relatively easy to get the tickets and up to the top. The view is spectacular on a clear day and we were lucky enough to have that. It's unfortunate that it's just one end of the top area and that unless you're staying at the hotel you don't get the opportunity to see the infinity pool.

It was a little expensive in my eyes but as a once off we were happy we did it."
,,Must see!,4.0,,"The viewing area is limited to the 56th floor at the front of the ""ship"" on top of the three towers. Excellent views over the sea, and marina and centre of Singapore City. Singapore Air passengers get discount by showing their boarding passes."
,,breathless view,5.0,,the best place to have your drink in Singapore. You can have a 360 view of the city while drinking a nice coctail. I believe everyone should pay a visit in this place.
,,Paradise in the sky,5.0,,"This has to rate high, the infinity pool is fantastic and to be amongst trees 57 floors up is unliveable!"
,,A waste of money,1.0,,"We admired this building from afar and heard about even before our trip but after viewing on the sights from the Singapore Flyer, the views from Marina Bay were duplicative plus the food on top of Marina bay is horrid - hot dogs and overly processed ice cream. For this we paid 20SD? I understand the nice dynamic parts (including a view of the infinity pool) are reserved for resort guest but I thought the hotel would sell some kind of nice cocktails or tea to visitors desiring a drink with a view. We won't come back and I will tell people not to visit. Plus it off the beaten path, not convenient to the rest of wonderful Singapore and all of its ethnic culture."
,,good view but huge line,4.0,,Definitely worth doing but just keep in mind that the line to get back down the lifts specially in the late afternoon takes over an hour just waiting for an empty lift.
,,"Wonderful views, exhorbitant prices, disappointing toilet facilities",3.0,,"The views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands were amazing. It is worth making the effort to go and have a look. It is a beautiful hotel. However, a warning. We expected drinks from the bar to be pricey. This is an understatement. They are exhorbitant. The drinks prices are as high as the view! Two beers, a very very small glass of wine and a champagne cocktail cost $100 Singapore Dollars. We wanted to do something special for our very last night in Singapore, the view is amazing. The main thing that let this sky high venue down was its very very ordinary ablutions. The quality and standard of the ladies toilet is extremely poor, in what is such a high star rating hotel. Imagine a cheap pub toilet that needs a good renovation and a clean and you will be close. There are nicer and far cleaner toilets at the train station. Quite surprising seeing as they are placed right next to a rather upmarket restaurant."
,,Do It,4.0,,We didn't want to spend the money to go up to the skypark. Instead we asked to go up the elevator to the restaurant and spent the money to have a drink and see the same view.
,,Must do in Singapore!,5.0,,"Great ambience and views from the top of Marina Bay Sands. Sure to get you in the mood. As expected, drinks are not cheap."
,,Wow what a view,4.0,,we went all the way up to the Sky Bar Ku Da Ta ! the view is crazy you cant miss this but the prices for cocktails or even no alcoholic is dreadful and the service worse ! go see the view leave the drinks !!!
,,3 night stay with teenage daughter & friend,5.0,,"Best part about this hotel is the infinity Pool ,very busy in the morning so we took our time and decided to go up after 11am . We were on the 53rd floor so not far to go for us . Had to wait to secure 3 beds together but so nice to enjoy the views from both sides of Sky park . Enjoyed the pool and waiters service and we stayed around the pool until evening . There are two Restaurants up here as well and a night club smart dress and rather expensive but still enjoyed it until the early hours ."
,,Head for the bar level 57,4.0,,We did not go up to the Sky Park but went up in the lift in tower 1 to the bar. No entrance fee to pay and you can see the same view. I would however suggest dropping into the bar for some afternoon cocktails. Fantastic view and service.
,,Wow,5.0,,"We didn't leave the skypark for 3 days. The pool was unbelievable and we just wanted to soak up the atmosphere all day and night. We had breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and dinner there. Everything is fantastic. Worth the expense for a luxurious treat."
,,Very good swimming pool with fantastic views,4.0,,This january we stayed at marina bay sands and we went up to the skypark. We found the swimming pool was fantastic with unbeatable views. I wish the had heated pool 😊
,,Nice view over the city,4.0,,This is a nice way of getting a overview of the city. I would recommend to do this in the morning when the air is clean or in the evening when the city lights are amazing.
,,Got to go!,5.0,,"This is an iconic building. If you’re in Singapore you simply have to visit. We only went up to the 57th floor to the Bar and Night Club but the views as you would expect are exceptional. A great atmosphere. The Marina Bay Sands hotel is part of the complex where there are great shops (all the top brands), great restaurants and bars and a great buzz."
,,Less than average (Flyer is way better),3.0,,"The skypark is very small with a good view. However, the view from the Flyer is waaaaay better.
In my opinion this does not worth the money. Additionally, everything was closed because they will have a party that night. Even if the cafe was open it still does not worth it. Keep in mind you can go and see the pool (only for guests)."
,,Superb view! Must see in Singapore!,5.0,,"The best view in the city. Simply great. Looks different in daytime and at night, more impressive and the best at sunset. We were staying in this hotel so went to the infinity swimming pool every day. Once in a life you must feel it!"
,,great views,4.0,,"lovely views over the city and the harbour and the Flyer. Only part of the views are through perspex so you can take photos over large areas without annoying perspex reflections.

The infinity pool can only be photographed with a decent long lens but is good."
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark contains mediocre views due to the limited access to the whole park, only allowing 180 degree view."
,,"Worth the money, excellent views",4.0,,The views from the top are amazing. $23 entry fee seemed worth it in my opinion. The sun was shining bright and the photos i was able to take came out brilliantly. The viewing platform is big enough to get all of the best views. People complaining that they were not able to access the full area need a reality check! If I had paid god knows how much to stay in the Marina Bay Sands I wouldn't want hundreds of tourists snooping about whilst I was sunbathing.
,,Best place to capture the Jewelled scrapers of Singapore,4.0,,One of the iconic pic of Singapore is the Night shot of the Jewelled skyline of the Singapore. One of the best view to capture it from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. One can spend hours together over there capturing panoramic view of Singapore. The best time to visit it to during evening time. A must visit place in Singapore if you can shell out about 23 SGD.
,,"As an alternative, visit the bar at Ku De Ta",4.0,,"We took another reviewers advice and just took the elevator to the bar/restaurant level. There is no admission fee for this. We walked out to the bar and ordered a beer and a juice (S$30). The view is amazing, plus you can relax and enjoy a drink. Depending on time of day shade can be limited. Table seating was reserved for the restaurant brunch diners when we went to we had to stand.

The viewing platform is the floor below. It is quite large but barren. No shade, no tables and only a small refreshment stand."
,,Awesome views from the Skypark Deck,5.0,,"In a way the views are similar to what you get from the Singapore Flyer! However there are 2 major plus points, 1 you have no time constraint. 2 you can walk around the deck back and forth, up and down and also sit and indulge!

That's what makes this something not to be missed!! Absolutely superb !!"
,,Impressive views of Singapore,5.0,,"The place is right on top of the marina bay sands complex... Wonderful views of the Singapore flyer, Fullerton hotel, merlion, an the cbd of Singapore... Guess Dubai got their ideas from Singapore... Great for photos... People are very pleasant😎 amazing place to be in"
,,No better view in all of Singapore,4.0,,"Entry fee: S$23 = about $17US. I visited the SkyPark just before sunset so that I could see the view in the light of day, during sunset, dusk and an night on a single elevator ride. If you don't do well with heights, this may not be the thing for you, however there is an outer viewing area on floor 56 and you can walk up a flight of steps to reach a higher, but recessed viewing area on floor 57. On a 'mild' evening with lower humidity levels, the view is incredible.

I brought along a non-intrusive, retracting tripod and a good digital camera to capture some absolutely stunning panoramas of the cityscape. However, if you only have a cellphone camera, I found that it works well too. The cellphone will be a little more grainy and lower resolution but it is typically all that you need to wow your friends when you show them what you experienced during your trip to Singapore. It will be difficult for most people to understand why they can't get a good picture of themselves from the observation deck with the lights of the city behind them. I saw this play out over and over again....most cellphones can't pull off the long exposure to capture the background of the city followed with a flash at the end to illuminate the foreground subject.

Bring a good digital camera and snap away. Marina bay, the flyer, super trees, opera house, ArtScience museum, there are tons of potential targets for your eyes and your lens."
,,What a Night View!,4.0,,"The viewing platform is bigger than we expected, and it is fascinating what care of the detail, eg of the roofs, one can see. The Esplanade a theaters roof look like durian etc. Beautiful view of the port, Gardens on the Bay, each moment at least three aircraft homing to Changi Airport. Worthy quite expensive entrance fee."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"The service on the way up was fantastic. The view was absolutely amazing. If you can't handle heights though, don't go. The height made me a little dizzy, so I stayed away from the edge. Having said that, it was still an awesome experience."
,,Very Impressive,4.0,,"I saw the Skypark from the Singapore Flyer and sight seeing tour so it jumped to the top of the list. It did not disappoint me. I have seen it by day and night and it is amazing. Definitely worth a look.

Tip - evening meal at the same time would be a good option if your budget stretches"
,,Yes.. them views.,5.0,,Had to visit this place for the views. And wasn't disapointed at all. Had been up the flyer earlier but I was sure that the waterfront views would be great from here. Also great views of the harbour and the Gardens by the Bay. Worth the climb.
,,Not value for money,3.0,,"$23 to go up to a small part of the decking area, per person, may be good at sunset but better off doing the flyer."
,,A sad experience for those who aren't hotel guests,3.0,,"So, if you haven't heard already, you won't be allowed to enjoy the Infinity pool unless you are a hotel guest of Marina Bay Sands. I understand, as it's already quite crowded on a sunny day, but it makes for quite a disappointment for people who pay insane amount of money for an elevator ride only to find out they can only take some pictures from the observation deck and that's basically it. So either book one night with the hotel or don't bother."
,,TOTALLY WORTH IT- Priceless views,5.0,,"A trip to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark in Singapore is a must, and if you do dont bother about doing the nearby Singapore Flyer. Perched above the Singapore Financial District's skyline, the skypark offers a kiosk if you want a drink or food, and amazing views right across beautiful Singapore. Apparently on clear days you are able to see all the way to the coast of Indonesia. Absolutely BREATHTAKING!"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"Fantastic views from the top of this amazing structure. Admission fees apply but are worth the cost. We went at about 10am in the morning and were able to access the view quickly and took several photos easily as it was not too crowded. A ""must do"" if you visit Singapore."
,,"Pricey, but great views",4.0,,"Whilst a tad pricey, the views afforded from the top are brilliant. Its a shame that there is only part access at the top. The pool and dining is open only to hotel guests, for obvious reasons."
,,Unsurpassed view,4.0,,"We went up in the middle of the heat of the day and didn't regret it. Whilst there is a fee, please note that there are a number of options - you can pay for the ride, or another option is to go to the lovely bar at the top and buy some drinks. We opted for this option during to middle of the day, and were very happy.

The infinity pool is reserved for hotel guests, but looks amazing, however even though this area was out of bounds, we still got great view. One side looked over the bulk of the city - yoy could see Raffles clearly and many other notable sites. The other side showed the marina, the Flyer and a good corner of the Grand Prix track.

Recommended."
,,Awesome 360 view!,5.0,,Nothing I can ask for more for its wonderful view from the top. Actually this is my 3rd time to visit this place and been to Marina Bay Sands (hotel) for an over night experience nothing ask for more on its panoramic view there is no such a word of a waste once you get in there! I love the experience and a highly recommended to visit.
,,Wow,5.0,,"We were a non guests but went up to the very top and had a drink, the views were amazing, what a fantastic view over Singapore, recommend just for the view"
,,Rooftop Swimming pool,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino has a rooftop swimming pool and a viewing deck from where one can get panoramic views of the city of Singapore and the ocean. Another side gives you an aerial view of the Gardens by the Bay attraction. The viewing experience is spectacular.
,,Incredible view of Singapore,5.0,,"Stunning view of Singapore city from level 57 of MBS! Yes it is crowded (what did you expect?), yes it is expensive, but it is worth it. Sunset while in the pool is such a great experience"
,,Top Deck,4.0,,"With so many tall buildings in Singapore, our visit list required a three dimensional view of the city. We were not disappointed with our choice. Timed to coincide with late afternoon and the lighting up of the city, we had the best of both day and night. Not booking into the hotel, we could only go to the viewing deck and bar.
The bar played great music, and the views were magnificent. Mostly full of westerners, it has a strict after 6pm dress code. We were warned upon entry (at about 5.15pm) that, wearing shorts, we would have to leave by 6pm. The staff showed a degree of flexibility with the rules, and, In the event, we stayed till about 7pm, when were were politely asked to leave the bar.
The rest of the viewing platform accessible to visitors, is not large, but enabled us to soak up the atmosphere of the early Singapore evening."
,,Breathtaking views at night!,5.0,,Beautifull view of the illuminated city in the North and of all the ships on anchor in the South behind Gardens By the Bay. Expensive drinks but worth it for the view.
,,Sunrise yoga on the observation deck - how novel!,4.0,,"As a non-guest I thought this would be a great way to see the view from the top, walk through the infinity pool, see a painterly sunrise and exercise all at once! It was… so for the same price I got a little better experience, without the heat of the sun, without the crowds!

But then it got complicated. You see, a lot of your service staff don't know (or appear to know) about sunrise yoga or that non-hotel guests (who have paid $25) to participate even exists! After the session, I had to get back to the fitness centre (level 55 tower 2) to collect my bag from the locker. To do that you have to sign in with your temporary card which'll take you back through the infinity pool etc etc, I left my card in the pants I was wearing when I turned up rather than the loose yoga shorts I wore. After discussions with several security staff, I did get escorted back to the fitness centre where I could even have a sauna! I didt really get to take a lot of photos before and after, but the lesson here is 'always carry the card!'

I'm glad not to have done this with the crowds and is an experience I will always never forget! And I even felt limbered up for the rest of the day!"
,,View to the world of Singapore,4.0,,"A fantastic view over the city , we had intended to go on the flyer , but having been upto the Skypark there seemed little point , we spent a good 30minutes on the park admiring the fantastic views over the Marina barage , Gardens by the bay , Formula 1 circuit , Financial District , Singapore Flyer , and Fullerton Hotel. At the base of the hotel is the massive Shopping Mall with many famous shops , although i have to say it was very thin on customers whilst we were there."

,,View to the world of Singapore,4.0,,"A fantastic view over the city , we had intended to go on the flyer , but having been upto the Skypark there seemed little point , we spent a good 30minutes on the park admiring the fantastic views over the Marina barage , Gardens by the bay , Formula 1 circuit , Financial District , Singapore Flyer , and Fullerton Hotel. At the base of the hotel is the massive Shopping Mall with many famous shops , although i have to say it was very thin on customers whilst we were there."
,,Limited view.,3.0,,"Decided to see what the hype was about. Firstly if arriving by foot, the sky deck is not easy to find. Based in tower one, we walked from tower 3. Most of the entrances were closed off. Found the sky deck entrench. $23 approx to get in. Queueing you are told where you can and can't go as the area is pretty much guests only.
Took the lift bit had to
Stop for a photo, even though we declined we were told we had to have our picture taken! After being blinded by the flash, up we went. 50 seconds later we were being presented our picture resplendent in a Cover for a bargain $55. We declined.
Walked outside and around and took in some of the sights. Tried to go into the bar but unable to due to it being cordoned off.
Overall after 15 minutes and many dollars lighter decided to leave. In my opinion I'd rather put my money elsewhere. Certainly not worth the money. The best part of the hotel is the 'free' lightshow you can watch at dusk from the esplanade."
,,A Better View than the Flyer and Worth the Price,4.0,,"At first I thought the $20.00 price tag for a trip to an observation deck seemed steep, especially having been on others like the CN Tower, Sears Tower, and the Stratosphere. I felt like this topped them all.

It's a quick elevator ride to the top, and if taking a cab ask them to drop you off at tower 3 as I believe that's the access to the sky park. After paying the seemingly hefty fee, you take the elevator to the top. First off, be sure to do this at night, or perhaps even dusk. One main difference from certain other observation decks is that this has railings and occasionally a higher plastic shield, but it's completely outdoors and makes you feel the open space more. When looking at the Marina Bay Sands the sky park is the front of the ship, and you have views of both the ocean and bay with all the ships waiting to dock, and then a fantastic view above the city of Singapore. Lots of sights to take in, and great opportunities to film panoramics. So while I thought the price was expensive, I soon learned it was completely worth it."
,,"Nice, but too much like Las Vegas",3.0,,"This is a cavernous type of complex, very large and crowded (at least when we were there in December). We had dinner at the restaurant on top and ate on the patio facing the ocean. The food was very good (not fantastic) and the service was very professional. The prices were fair (given you are in Singapore) and on top of an icon landmark building. I would recommend visiting The Skypark, because it is a bit special, but make sure to have reservations far in advance otherwise it is difficult to eat inside (more upscale menu) and climate control is preferable."
,,"Great view, but overpriced and bad service",3.0,,"Defiantly worth going up to the bar for the view, but that's all the service was very average and the drinks expensive $16 for a stubby of tiger beer and it was warm"
,,Second stay here,4.0,,"Second stay in the hotel and second visit to the skypark. Prices of food are more normal now, service as good, although the toilets were not very clean in the afternoon. As an upgrade from my last visit, they now have a smoking area up in the skypark. If you want a balcony for your room, do not choose to pay extra for the cityview! They do not have the free shuttle from/to the airport anymore.
Still is a great hotel!"
,,A Nice Mall with Branded Shops & Fine Dining Restaurants,4.0,,"We visited the Bay Level part of the Marina Bay Sands. From this level one could see and walk out to Marina Bay a lovely sight of the main business centre of town. At the ground and basement level there were many branded shops such as Zara, Gucci, Hermès etc. We also enjoyed a special drink at Gong Cha. Gong Cha (Tribute Tea) originated a long way back at around 1000 BC in ancient China. Tea is usually offered as a tribute to the Emperor of China.
After a round of mall we went out for a walk around Marina Bay and then to the Gardens by the Bay enjoying lovely views all the way. Finally having our brunch at Gardens by the Bay. A very enjoyable morning session in Singapore."
,,It was ok...,3.0,,"Nice views from the top but that's about it, having already done the flyer we weren't seeing anything new so it was a bit disappointing - The pool at the hotel (not accessible via viewing platform) looks cool though.

The viewing platform takes 20 mins max to walk around, additional facilities up there (eg sit in cafe or somewhere to sit full stop) would make it feel a bit more of an experience."
,,Breathtaking,4.0,,"Simply breathtaking more so for couples, so romantic at night. A perfect view of the city too. A must for first time travelers to Singapore."
,,Hungry? Have lunch instead of buying just a view,5.0,,"Since we were not staying at MBS hotel, we knew we would either have to pay for the great view or buy lunch and/or drinks at Ku De Ta and have the view included.

Based on many TA reviews, the view alone was not rated excellent, so we opted for lunch at Ku De Ta, and then ended up staying for drinks at Ku De Ta (see reviews for Ku De Ta as well). Yes, the restaurant is expensive, but we wanted to see the view and it was terrific.

If you want the views, and are not a MBS hotel guest, and want lunch, go to Ku De Ta. If you go at night, there is an 80SGD minimum spend requirement, which does not apply for lunch.

We thoroughly enjoyed seeing the views while eating and drinking. For us, a scenic Singapore view was worth a splurge lunch and drinks. Paying for a view alone when we wanted lunch too did not seem the best value."
,,Wonderful views across Singapore,3.0,,"To save yourself some money, I suggest that you do this instead of the Singapore Flyer rather than doing both like we did. The view from the top of Marina Bay Sands is wonderful although pricey at $23 Singaporean (approximately $21 AUD) per person. There isn't a lot to do at the top either and the gift shop and beverages you can buy there are very expensive. It makes you envious to look across to the other side and see people swimming in the hotel's swimming pool, an area you're unable to visit if you're not staying at the hotel."
,,"Great place to visit, a bit overpriced",4.0,,"Try to go late in the afternoon, shortly before it gets dark. As Singapore is almost on the equator it means sunset time range is very small, say from 6:50 PM to 7:20 PM.
This way you will get to see the views before and after the sunset as your ticket only grants you one visit to the top, no re-entry.
Note that it gets windy up there, even chilly sometimes."
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Unfriendly staff, poor service. You are not allowed to visit the pool area, nor to drink or dine in the restaurant. The only option is to have a very expensive take-away coffee from the kiosk. The view is great, but not worth 23$ a person."
,,What a View And What a Lunch,5.0,,"We chose to try the buffet lunch at the Rise Restaurant, what a feast, at a reasonable price. The selection was unbelievable. The staff service was excellent and so friendly.
After we went to the ""C"" Tower basement to buy tickets to the observation deck, which is on the 56th Floor. The elevator takes seconds to get there. The view is magnificent, with views to all around the Singapore. You also get a wonderful view down onto the Garden Bay grounds, not to be missed. It is a wonderful building. We did not try out the casino, left that to people with an excess of money, they do not want."
,,Surprisingly bad service,1.0,,"I visited MBS with high expectations of the hotel since it was a 6 star hotel. I went there with my family of nine, including 2 young kids, 2 elderly and 1 baby. We were celebrating my sis's birthday there, therefore we booked a room there. Only a few of us were staying the night, since there was not enough room for everyone. However, all of us wanted to go to the skypark to enjoy the view/swim, since this was a rare experience. We were given 2 room cards, and each card could take 1 adult and 1 kid into the skypark. I had been here before, so I knew that there were no such restrictions the last time I was here. This infuriated me a little. So, 4 of us went in (including the kids) and I came out again to get my grandparents in, since the frail old couple was waiting at the lift lobby for us. I was about to get them in when the pool attendant asked me whether my other family members had left in order for my grandparents to enter the skypark. I said yes, although i wasnt too sure. They let us enter, and my grandparents sat by the pool area to watch us swim. It was GOOD...BUT NOT FOR LONG. The same pool attendant came all the way to the pool and pointed at my family members, saying that they were here and threatened to chase us out. She mentioned that this was against the law and said that there were CCTVs around and the police might catch me. I WAS COMPLETELY BOILING WITH RAGE. This was utter POOP since my grandparents were obviously NOT in the pool and this is NO WAY to talk to your guest. As a 6 star hotel, they should have FULL AWARENESS on how to serve your guest WELL. My aunt then came and tried to reason with the attendant, but she continued pursuing the matter and chased us out. In the end, we had to go ALL THE WAY down to the reception at the hotel lobby to request for a temporary pass. This might seem like the pool attendant is not at fault, BUT SHE IS!

This inflexibility is completely RIDICULOUS. As one of Singapore's famous hotel and icon, it is THEIR DUTY to make tourists' stay pleasant and THIS POOP is in NO WAY pleasant and has given me a rather UNPLEASANT impression of Singapore. If the pool attendant had been polite about it, I wouldn't have minded but THIS UTTER RUDENESS calls for an explanation. This is a disgrace to MBS itself and I will not be satisfied even with a simple apology."
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,We went to the Garden by the Bay and decided to go to top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. As expected the views are amazing. There is a bar and an observation deck.
,,"Fantastic view over the singapore bay, port and the central district",5.0,,"the pool is wow, no really! The pizza is great at ku de ta, and drinks on top there are worth it for sure. Not to be missed if visiting singapore."
,,Must see!,5.0,,"Great view and best possible way to have a view over the city! It's really high, but safe for children."
,,Great Views over Singapore,4.0,,"Yes perhaps the Skypark is slightly overrated and yes you have to pay SGD $23.00 per adult, but you can't come to Singapore and not be drawn to Marina Bay Sands.

Getting to the 56th floor takes a mere minutes in the super fast lift, but when we got onto the observation deck, we were there only about 30 minutes, as it is not that large. It's a great vantage point and we took quite a few photos, after that, there is nothing else to do!

I have been fascinated by this building ever since it was completed. Marina Bay Sands is truly an engineering and architectural feat, and standing atop the observation deck you really appreciate the enormity of what has been achieved here. So for that experience alone, it was worth the visit."
,,Another obervation deck but it's free,4.0,,"We decided not to pay the high price for the lift to the top. Instead, we went to the 3th (?) floor of the hotel where there was a walkway leading to a large observation area. (You can see the walkway looking up from the lobby of the hotel). It offered nice view of the Mariner Bay and the Gardens by the Bay."
,,"Overrated, really.",2.0,,"The Sands SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands is really not worth the money. Although advertised as providing one of 'Singapore's best views', in my opinion, there are plenty of other attractions in Singapore that offer better views. The trip to the 56th floor costs $23 per adult, yet the observation deck is extremely small. It only provides a 180° view, rather than a 360° view as most people would expect.

While buying tickets, we were told not to use the infinity pool as it is only for use for the hotel guests, however, the pool and the rest of the 'ship' are barely visible from the deck! For a better view of Singapore, ride the Singapore Flyer."
,,it's a must,5.0,,"finally i had visit this area on my third time going to singapore
the access to this area is easy, i visit here to eat, for me the price is quite higher than usual food court, but it is worth
the mall is beside the hotel and right in front of garden by the bay
the view is wonderful, but i cant go up because i have to walk to merlion, and it turns out not to far from here"
,,Sky park singapore,3.0,,Initially I thought there will be a park in the sky but it turned out to be a small deck. The overall concept is good. It is ship shaped swimming pool. Access to swimming pool is only for hotel guests. Small space (deck) is for common public. Nice view from 56th floor. Good for photo shoots. Little more space with shelter would have added more grace to the attraction. Little more expensive.
,,Better go to KuDeTa,1.0,,"Instead of paying $26 for the elevator ride, you can pay $30 for a drink ($10 for a water) at the KuDeTa bar right next to it."
,,Must do!,5.0,,"It is just as good as you have heard! The views are incredible and at times you completely forget you are 50 off storeys in the sky! the pool is incredible, the surrounds are fantastic and the adults only section is a godsend!"
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to see Singapore, this is the place to SEE IT ALL. Best place to view CBD and beyond. I always bring my foreign visitors here."
,,A panoramic view of Singapore,3.0,,"As some of you are aware, I wrote a suspense thriller called Smokescreen with the bulk of the story taking place in Singapore. Some interviews and reviews that I have had have focused on the places that were featured in the pages of the novel, where they have been described as ""exotic"" and ""vivid.""

The protagonist, Jet West, is first introduced physically at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark where he attends a party hosted by the Singapore Tourist Board, and then, in subsequent, the adventure begins.

The ship like structure (The Skypark) resting on top of a building, which has now become a Singapore icon around the world, is what attracted me to include it when introducing the protagonist although the story began earlier in some other country.

I have been to the Skypark several times o recce the place for details. In the novel, the scene takes place in the evening but if you'd like to have a panoramic view of Singapore, my suggestion is to go during daylight hours. Bring a good camera or video-cam with a solid lens. The view isn't as spectacular as some views in other parts of the world. But as I mentioned earlier, the ship like structure - or like a sliced French loaf -- is worth seeing.

Bear in mind that unless you are coming to Singapore in the December period, I suggest you bring a hat to avoid the searing brightness... not to mention a good pair of sunglasses.

The unfortunate part about The Skypark area is that unless you are a hotel guest, you can't swim at the pool but the restaurant and bar is open to the general public. I saw Paris Hilton doing a little promo here during the Formula 1 event last year. Unfortunately it would not be possible to sky jump from the building because of the glass panel bordering the whole place, but I have seen a YouTube video of a drone travelling beyond the area, so if you've got one this is going to be fun.

The Sands itself is an interesting building with lots of entertainment, restaurants, shopping - and there's also an arts/science museum nearby. Enjoy the visit."
,,What a view!!,5.0,,This is an absolute 'must do' whilst in Singapore. I found it a bit disconcerting to begin with as I suffer from vertigo but once I'd focussed on the magnificent view I was fine and thrilled to see so much and so far ... e.g. so much shipping coming and going.
,,Simply spectacular view,5.0,,"I was blown away by the fantastic view from the observation deck at the Sands Skypark. Only the observation deck (at the northern end) is open to non-residents of the Sands Hotel. The cost of admission was 19.60 SGD, but definitely worth the price. The views range through about 270 degrees - from the Gardens by the Bay, The Singapore Flyer, the Esplanade theatre, City Hall, Victoria theatre, the Downtown area, and the container shipping terminal further south.
I went in the late afternoon.
I think this is the best view to be found in Singapore."
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,"At first though it was a bit expensive but as soon as you step out of the elevator you know it was worth every penny. Only a small section to walk around but wow, what a view!!! Amazing. And so cool to see the city from up high."
,,57th Floor over looking the city,5.0,,If your looking for a view This is It...@ level 57 this is a Awesome view of Singapore by day and by night.... I had both today and lived it.
,,Panoramic View,5.0,,"My wife and I were given a discounted ticket of 17 SGD each being senior citizens & traveling on Silkair to go up the Marina Sands Observation Deck. You should go on a clear night especially after the frequent evening showers to get a panoramic view of the city. You can see the Science Arts Museum, Esplanade Theatre, Helix Bridge, Gardens by the Bay, Fullerton Hotel, Merlion, Commercial Buildings and Tanjung Pagar Port. The laser & light show is also a delightful experience. Put it on your itinerary if you visit Singapore and you will come away with many beautiful snapshots of your visit. Enjoy!"
,,Best view in Singapor,5.0,,"Went up to the bar - Ku De Ta - in the skylark. Free entry. The views are amazing although the drink prices are a touch expensive, even for Singapore. The views make the trip worth it. Stunning in the evening."
,,Great view of Marina Bay and Singapore!,4.0,,"I took the MRT here and was a bit confused how to get to the actual skypark. I found out I need to walk into Marina Bay Sands, and exit the back, to the left there is a glass looking entarance with wording Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The ticket price is not cheap, but I got a discount using my Singapore Airlines ticket. While going up the skypark, our photo was taken but when we got to the top. We were ask if we wanted to buy a photo of us with a frame costing ($50 SGD) which is very expensive comparing with USD. So we declined but the gentleman looked mad when we declined. The skypark can be very hot and humid under the sun even in November, so be aware if you dislike hot weather. There is not much to see but Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay. There are no bench or chairs for you to sit to enjoy the view. Maybe a better view at night. The bad part is, once you enter the skypark you cannot come back, I wanted to come back at night time. I thinkt he skypark should let tourists come back during a time frame to enjoy the view at night and day. I won't visit the skypark again due to cost and nothing much to see."
,,Great views,3.0,,great views of Singapore but confined to the observation deck only unless you are a hotel guest. Nowhere to sit or get a drink / something to eat and you aren't encouraged to linger at all. Pleased we did it but wouldn't rush back
,,For a terrific view of Singapore,4.0,,Accessible by MRT this hotel with 3 towers and a boat shaped topping with pools and gardens is a must for a visit. Nonresidents can access the Skypark by direct lift in tower no 3. The experience is well worth the effort of getting there and the all round views at the top are breathtaking. We considered this our second best venue after the Orchid Garden. Plan to visit the Cloud Forest after the Skypark as it is just a modest walk away by passageway from the Hotel
,,Superb Views,5.0,,Superb views of Singapore from a unique piece of architecture. We did not try the restaurant as we were told it is rather expensive. Great place to have a drink at night.
,,Good view but expensive and can be missed,3.0,,"The view is great but this ""attraction"" can be given a miss specially when one has to shell out 23 SGD and then not even able to sit around the skypark (no seats)

Good : View
Bad : No access to pool, restaurant, no seating

Missable specially if you have visited Petronas in KL"
,,On Top of The World...Looking Down on High Tech Creation,5.0,,"Yes, it is true, the views you will get at the Skypark are like no others in the World, let alone, Singapore. This is an amazing feat of technology and cannot be missed. You can only access the swimming pool part of the skypark when you book a room at the hotel, otherwise you can go up on the west tower side for $25S, so it is pricey for a short activity but cheaper than staying at the hotel. All of the hype about this place is true. Try it you will like it. Take the MRT to the ocean side of the hotel and Gardens by the Bay and make a day of it."
,,Wonderful View At The Top,5.0,,"Nice view of Singapore at the very top of the hotel/casino. At night, the view is very colourful. However, if you are not the hotel's guest, you are only limited to one corner. If you stay in the hotel, then you can enjoy the Infinity Pool at the top.
The hotel is made up of threee separate buildings connected at the top that look like a ship.
To access to the top (Skypark), you have to actually leave the main building and then come in through another smaller doorway. We couldn't find it at first and we had to ask 3 different people to point us to the right direction.
It cost SG$26 / person, unlimited time to stay up there.
Better to go in the evening or late afternoon. It will be cooler and nicer and more colourful view.
There is also a Casino on the ground floor."
,,Fun to see the luxury and view,4.0,,"I often bring here groups of 10-30 people. The Architecture is a jewel for those who are interested in its technique. The many shops are interesting to go window-shopping, but not more. Wonderful is the view from the Skypark over the city and the see. If you can afford a meal up there enjoy it then it tastes delicious or even a cold drink will do to enjoy the scenery and the interaction with your friends. Before or afterwards, enjoy the laser show down by the water."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"My wife and I visited in December 2014 and were very impressed with the design. The view is breath taking and if you fear heights - well maybe not so great for you. Everything in Singapore is generally expensive, so the cost to visit this iconic building was no real surprise for us two worldly travellers. We wouldn't consider booking accommodation due to the cost and really, wouldn't you want to spend your hard earned dollars in a more value-for-money way."
,,expansive view,3.0,,"liked the view. did not like that there are no seats at the top. there is a restaurant up there ,but exclusive for the hotel guests. it would have been nice to be able to sit down and enjoy the view with a glass of wine and dinner!

there is a refreshment cafe, but you had to sit on the floor if you wanted to spend time there. at $23.00 to get to the top, you want to spend time soaking up the atmosphere.

As usual, there a official photographers! We said we wanted to decide about buying it when we left, only to be told we would be leaving by a different door and would not be able to get the photo on the way out! when in fact we left by the same door and walked by the same photographer!!! if you want to decide later - then stick to your guns!"
,,Great View,4.0,,A 180 Fantastic view if you are not a guest at the Hotel. $25 per person for the privilege to get to the sky deck. It would have been nice if there were tables and chairs to sit at and have a drink and a snack. It was just a souvenir shop and very limited drinks. (No water) There was no shade so on a hot day you don't want to spend too much time there. But it is still worth the trip to get some great snaps.
,,Sky deck is sky desert,2.0,,"For $23/adult I really expected more. According to the ticket you have access from 9.30am to 10pm but would defy anyone to spend more than 40 minutes on the deck! All you get access to is the tip of one end of the structure, a wood panelled floor, no seating, no shade, The views are great. But the Singapore Flier (the wheel) is probably more interesting as you are getting different views. We were there this afternoon - it was 29 degrees, humid, virtually no wind. An ice cream cost $7.50.

The building is amazing but save your money, do a boat cruise which gives you an interesting commentary on current and past Singapore and the Flier for the arial views."
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"Excellent view but expensive. 23SGD per person for once you go up. So if you need food, water please purchase that before going up because its very expensive in skypark. Go at evening so that you can aslo enjoy the night view and night show. If you visit this place , you can enjoy merlion park, Singapore flyer, water shows, garden by the bay altogether."
,,a nice bar and restaurant kudeta,4.0,,"We were there in april 2014, and my son (we were travelling with family) wanted to visit the sky park.We asked around and were advised to visit kudeta the sky park bar n restaurant. A visit worth the effort... forget the food , but the view is fabulous"
,,A bucket list experience when in Singapore....despite the cost and reduced viewing areas,4.0,,Viewing deck access is getting smaller over the years... Entry cost is up there!!!. Photo people are pushy. Views are to die for !!! on a clear day.
,,Fantastic experience!!,5.0,,A beautiful shopping centre; a unique building and a fantastic experience with views all around Singapore. We visited in the late afternoon and saw everything in daylight and waited to view everything at night with all the skyline lit up - a must see and do in Singapore!! I highly recommend it
,,Great views almost made this a 4 star,4.0,,Really worth a trip for a view of Singapore that is super. Great views on this weird building. Had a drink at the top not cheap but worth it. Security staff at top a bit officious.
,,Good way to watch the Sunset,5.0,,"Took the lift up to Skypark (after we found how to get to it), and was greeted with great views over Singapore. We were able to watch the sun slowly set and then see the lights of Singapore come to life. A trip back down and then over to the Gardens by the Bay for their light Show. Brilliant!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark good view through the haze,4.0,,"A great view but is it worth S$23 for an adult? We payed for our ticket, then a photographer wanted to take our photo and became very insistent/rude when I didn't want my photo taken. I don't think they were going to give me my photo for free so isn't it my choice then whether I pose for them? The view is good, there is interpretive signage in English and at least one more language but the air was't very clear for photography."
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,Taking the lift to the observation deck is a must. The night views are spectacular. Try going up just before sunset for the best experience.
,,Tom,1.0,,"Terrible, view was lackluster and ticket was $23. Limited access, could barely see the infinity pool from the deck aswel."
,,Great for one drink...better to look at then look out from,3.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is an incredible piece of architecture, beautifully designed and a perfect highlight to the Singapore skyline. It is not easy to get up to the Skypark, trying to navigate through a mall, hotel and more and especially tough with kids because the bar is nearly the only way up. After getting up, the view was great but the view looking at the masterpiece from across the water is perfect and in my opinion, better."
,,Best views in singapore,5.0,,"What a marvel of building, a bit pricey but well worth it. Worth going up and buying a drink(which works out about the same as the $23.00 just for the entry).a little tip the lift to go up to the viewing gallery is in tower 3."
,,The View,5.0,,"You have to go to see the amazing view from the top of the Hotel. From there you can see all the financial city, the ocean and other beautifull parts from the city. If you travel to Singapure we have to see that place....."
,,The place to enjoy Singapore's View,3.0,,"If you want to see the beauty of Singapore, this is the good place to see. But the fee for enjoy this view is rather expensive. In my opinion, you should come to this place in the late afternoon and then stay there until evening, especially at the weekend."
,,Fantastic view of Singapore from the observation deck,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a huge structure , considered the 2nd famous structure after the Merlion Statue.There's an observation deck on the skypark ,to witness the stunning view of Singapore City, the best time to visit is during the evening.
You have to be a hotel guest if you want to experience the view for free ,but if you are a visitor , you have to pay quite a lot , to enter a space of the skypark.
Limited number of people are allowed at one time at the skypark.
The skypark is located about 50+ storeys up ,a short ride on the express lift (considered one of the fastest lift in the world).
Ticket price:

S$23 for adults
S$17 for children (aged between 2 - 12 years*)
S$20 for senior citizens (aged 65 years and above)
Children under 2 years may enter for free.
Single admittance from 09.30 to 22.00
Can be bought on MBS Ticket Box Office or Online."
,,Amazing,4.0,,Marina bay Park sky nice and comfortable place to visit with family and friends .Ahead of Christmas and New Year holiday I suggest for your holiday to the marina bay sky park
,,The Birds Eye View !!,4.0,,"The Sands Skypark observation deck is located in the premises of Marina Bay sands Hotel and offers a peek into the highly coveted infinity pool..just a peek no more as the area is segregated and the viewing gallery is at the same level as the pool

It offers amazing views of the Singapore Skyline and gives you a extensive view of the land mark buildings , the Singapore Flier , the gardens by the bay , the new indoor stadium and the expanse of the Sea full of colourful Cargo ships and if you are lucky you may spot some cruise liners as well

The ticket costs 23SGD .There is a cafe on the walk if you feel like sticking around for a while

There is also a HBD ( Subsidized housing) building which is high enough to give you the same views for as low as 5 SGD..without a peek in the infinity pool that is !!!"
,,Must visit for an excellent city view (expensive though),5.0,,"A unique building in itself housing offices, a hotel and a mall- this building has an amazing terrace experience to offer. However the ride up comes in an express lift (which takes you to 50+ floors in less than a minute). The terrace has fantastic restaurants and a decent wine collection to go with an amazing view of this lovely city."
,,Iconic,4.0,,"It's well worth a visit even if you're not staying at the Sands. Visit at sunset and enjoy cocktails at Ku De Ta. At present, there's no cover charge at Ku De Ta before 9PM. On a clear day, the vista is breathtaking."
,,Don't expect to be able to walk the entire Sky Park.,1.0,,"Personally I find that this visit for the price is a rip-off. Visitor are only allowed access to one small end of the skypark. Its not even a park as per se. You are not allowed into the other areas which are deemed for hotel guests only. If you want a full view, the other option would be the flyer or 1' Altitude."
,,Great Vantage Point for the city's skyline,5.0,,You'll need to purchase tickets (SGD23) to access the Sky Park. Very fast lifts up to the viewing platform on Level 57.What you won't get to see much of is the Infinity Pool but what you'll get is a great view of the city skyline so you won't want to leave your cameras at home. Best time to visit: Just before sunset (~6pm) till dark (~8pm) so you get to see the city transition from daylight to night. You can get a cocktail and hangout at Ku De Ta while you're up there. Oh yeah and do call them to check if its open to the public on the day and time that you are planning to visit because they do occasionally close for private events.
,,"lovely staff, amazing views, but a couple of things to consider",4.0,,"We spent 4 days at marina bay sands for our honeymoon. The service was outstanding and the staff are very friendly and some knew us by name by the end of our stay. We had the orchard suite and that was also lovely with lots of mod cons. Highly recommend getting the club package if you can, we took advantage of the free drinks and canapés every night and watched the sunset from the sky deck, it was bliss! Only a couple of things for people to consider- particularity for a honeymoon 1. The champagne that comes with booking the honeymoon package tasted soooooo bad, we couldn’t drink it (and we are not fussy drinkers by any means)Ii wouldn’t bother with the honeymoon package. 2. Most of the people using the pool spend the whole time taking selfies rather than actually enjoying it, which we found really pretentious. There is no doubt it is an incredible view, which is why people want to take pictures, but we watch some people traking selfies for up to 2 hours! 3. The money secured on your credit card when checking in, is not released straight away after settling the bill. They still have not released about $3000 of our money and said it could take up to 2 weeks which is extremely inconvenient."
,,A very high but wonderful place,5.0,,"I am afraid of height but when I visited Marina By Sands, I gave up that thinking. I got a breakfast in a restaurant here with fresh delicious seafood!
When I saw people swimming on top of the world, I was so surprised and to be afraid of height again, hahaha!
I love this place, I think I will bring my children here soon!"
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"We have just been to the skypark this afternoon, it was amazing.
Price $23.00SGD, the cue was short & lift to the viewing platform was quick.
Views were great.
Highly recommend.
Note: if you are going from 6pm onwards there is a dress code..... No shorts ect...
Found this out last night"
,,Th building is better than the view,2.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is a magnificent piece of architecture, however the view of the outside of the building is better than the view you get from inside.

The trip to the top is expensive and does not allow access to the pool which is only accessible to guests of the hotel (we were aware of this prior to going!) The view is pretty typical of that which can be seen from any sky scraper in Singapore (or the world for that matter.)

A hint to travellers on the MRT, get off at Bayview NOT Marina Bay, as the stop 'Marina Bay' is a good 20 minute (open air) walk from the hotel/shops."
,,Superb views but........,3.0,,You get a superb vista of Singapore from the roof of this very impressive hotel. If you are not staying there however you will be asked to pay $23pp for the privilege of visiting the observation deck or you can visit the bar and pay about the same for two drinks. Take the lift from tower 3 up to the 57th floor for free.
,,Take in the view cheaply,4.0,,"Going to the top is well worth the experience BUT .. Suggest you don't take the formal viewing area tour at a fee. Rather take the private elevator to KuDeTa Bar, order fries and a drink and use their balcony to check out the skypool and views. Sensational.

Do this twice. Once in the day and then at night. Spectacular difference and both wonderful."
,,Great views!,4.0,,"So if you are visiting just for the great views then ok but bear in mind this pass does not allow you anywhere else. The observation deck is at the bow of the ship and takes up approx 30% of the ship so to speak. You cannot get access to the bar, restaurant or anything else. The rest of the building is for residents of the hotel which I guess is fair enough but worth noting if you are expecting to eat or drink whilst 'up there!'
Once out of the lift you are ushered in front of a camera where they super impose a picture of the attraction behind you, we didn't purchase the photo due to the ridiculously high price!! I would recommend this attraction purely for the views and because this is such an impressive structure, just a shame you can't see more of the hotel."
,,A must visit!,4.0,,"Put this one on your list to visit. Amazing building and amazing view from the top. The shops downstairs are quite nice to visit, and don't miss the gondolas."
,,"Not Skypark, just observation deck",2.0,,"very disappointing. No entry to view infinity pool, hotel guests only!
However when I visited in May 2013, the same ticket cost, SGD23. We were given a guide who pointed out landmarks etc, and gave facts & figures re this amazing building , took us thru to view the pool.
This was my second visit & I was with a friend, I suggested this was the place to go, umm wrong .
We had booked for 0900 ""tour"", but office didn't open till 0920. No guide, amazing views however."
,,A must visit - Go around 6pm,5.0,,"Dont think much about the ticket price. Its 23 SGD but totally worth it. If you go around 5.45pm then u can experience Singapore with and without lights. Views are great. Yo have plenty of views to capture. Singapore skyline, Habour, Gardens by the bay, the flyer looks great from here.
I think if you can select sky park over the flyer if you only want to try one."
,,Go at twilight and catch 2 great views!,4.0,,"The Marina Sands Hotel is a very distinctive hotel that looks like a ship on 3 posts. It's all by itself overlooking the ocean on one side and the Singapore Bay on the other. At the top on one side is an observation area called the Sky Park.

We debated back and forth a bit about the best/cheapest way to see the sky park. There were some suggestions about just getting a meal or a drink and enjoying the view that way. We eventually decided to just get a ticket and go to the observation deck. We bought tickets from a tour center in the lobby of our hotel and they could be used at any day/time.

We took the MLT (subway) there and got off at the Marina Sands stop. There's a huge mall attached to this exit and signage to the Sky Park was REALLY confusing. Just follow the signs to the hotel, take the escalators up and turn left and go all the way to one end and then OUTSIDE and back in another door for the high speed elevators to the sky park. There is the ubiquitous (and annoying) ""pose for a picture""- just grin and bare it and move on. Arguing with them just takes time and they are relentless.

We got there just a bit after sunset and it was so pretty. Over time the lights all came on the high rises across the bay and it was a lovely sight. We also got a chance to see the bay light show from above. It was quite interesting. There was a small little souvenir/snack shop. The bars and restaurants were PACKED. So if you want to eat/drink call and make reservations ahead of time."
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,"Take time to visit this place, you can take the lift to the 57th storey for drinks, the views from the top are wonderful and you can see the whole of Singapore. Although it can get busy, like most places in Singapore its not push and shove busy!!!"
,,Not for those who don't like heights,5.0,,57 floors up - what a view. we went up Tower 3 and bought a drink in the bar. There wasn't a charge. Our friends went up Tower 1 and had High Tea. Don't miss this one.
,,Amazing Hotel,5.0,,"It is a boat on top of the hotel. The view is amazing you can see the whole of Singapore, the best time to go is late afternoon, then you can see both day time and evening and night time."
,,Top of the world,5.0,,An architectural Marvel . Best time to go up is half an hour prior to the sunset. Enjoy the views as the sun sets and the entire country lights up. Breathtaking beauty of the concrete jungle mesmerises you. Drinks are available at the top for which the entry from ground level is separate . The only soar point is the slightly offensive photography which is thrust on you before you get on to the high speed lifts. A must visit .
,,"Nice view, but",3.0,,"Not the cheapest attraction in Singapore. The views are wonderful, even on a murky day but the whole idea seems to be squeezing the most revenue for the least effort. Yes, you can buy ice creams and light refreshments, but there is no seating at all to sit and enjoy them.

Also, we were persuaded to have our photograph taken before ascending in the lift. As you got to the top there was a big sales job to try and get you to buy the photo - not cheap at $S50 each. In the event, I did decide to purchase a photo - gave the staff my credit card to pay but their machine wasn't working and wouldn't process the purchase. After many minutes and about six fruitless attempts to get it to work, I was then hassled to pay cash instead which I was reluctant to do as we were about to depart for the airport and I needed my cash for the taxi. Eventually, after much arguing the staff did very reluctantly actually send the photograph to our email account free of charge. This was the only unpleasantness we experienced in our whole trip to Singapore!

Next time we will go for a meal or drink at the Swisshotel, where the views are also superb and you get to enjoy something to eat, in comfort, at the same time."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for 5 days so we had the luxury of using the Skypark facilities almost everyday. The views during daytime from atop is so different during night time. There are a number of heated pools and spas around the place but I guess the best one to try and have lots of photos taken is from the infamous infinity pool. The kids had a ball and were not scared to dive into it. It can get very windy and cool up there but once you are in the pool, the cool climate is quickly forgotten. The views from the spa area is different from the infinity pool as it is located opposite the massive infinity pool. Lifeguards and other staff are there to assist you with. I love their huge towels too!!! From memory, hotel guests had special access to the lifts.
Try to go up the Skypark during the day as well as during the night as the views are both spectacular on these different times."
,,Really great and really poor parts!,4.0,,"Ku De Ta restaurant was exquisite. Very pricey but excellent view and excellent service and food.
The bar on the floor below was like a student bar! Very poor decor. The drinks are very expensive, even for Singapore and I feel the bar din not match it. Clearly tourists pass through this part a lot for photos etc. but it really doesn't leave a good impression. It lets the rest of the complex down."
,,ship in the sky,4.0,,"This 150-metre pool has been designed with an infinity vanishing edge 58 th floor above street level. From the pool edge, it seems that you are swimming in mid-air. A row of palm trees, present a striking beach water edge, still trying to come to terms with the altitude. Beneath the palms are two rows of sun loungers. Another row sits at the water's edge, low enough to almost be submerging. Swimming in the pool is like been on a silver lined cloud. The pool holds approx... 1.8 million Litres of water, atop the world's largest cantilevered platform.. The three Hotel towers on which the pool is perched are almost 250 metres high all around me, Singapore sparkles and shines, From the sky park every building that the eyes can see its seem to be an architectural masterpiece. But I remain at a loss as to how to describe the shape of the Sky Park and that swimming pool now being licked by cloud. All I can say it’s a master piece it must be experienced to believe the effort and genius planning, and not to mention the construction."
,,Just OK,3.0,,Average experience and won't recommend it to others unless they really wanted to try it. View was magnificent no doubt about it but I believe you can get much more unbelievable views of Singapore by boarding the Singapore Flyer. The good thing about this experience though was seeing the interior of Marina Bay Sands which was really luxurious & spectacular.
,,Amazing,5.0,,A boat built on top of three buildings. Amazing architecture and design Whoever thought to build this is a genius
,,"Not worth the time, money or effort",2.0,,"If you're into structural engineering, then this iconic Singapore building is DEFINITELY worth seeing - just do so from the ground rather than from the top.

At S$23, you'd expect to be treated to sights of the famous infinity pool and bars that are dotted along the top of this amazing structure, but no, you get to wander only the ship's 'bow' which equates to maybe one quarter of the top deck.

The bars and pool are reserved for the hotel guests staying at the complex and are not on offer to those who merely want to visit.

While the view is lovely (make sure it's sunny and not foggy or smoggy), similar views can be found 'doing' something like taking a ride on the Singapore Flyer or on the Sentosa Cable Cars.

To truly appreciate this impressive structure, remain on the ground - take pics from the outside and venture inside for a look - but don't waste your time with the Skylounge unless you absolutely 'must'."
,,Totally Worth It!,5.0,,"My wife and I booked a room at the Marina Bay Sands just to experience this pool, and let me tell you, it's completely worth it. The view is stunning, exhilarating. The night we stayed it was raining. But, we caught a short opening of weather and ventured out into the pool. The view at night is fantastic. It seems unreal. The lights from the buildings that surround the marina seem so close you can grab them. The following morning, with clear skies, we ventured out into the pool first thing. As the sun rose, we swam in the pool. It was a bit cold early in the morning, but as the sun starts to splash the pool, everything gets warmed.

Very memorable experience and great photo opportunity!"
,,Brilliant view,5.0,,Unsurpassed views of Singapore! I think most attractions in the world that offers this kind of view charges an entrance fee and I think it was worth every penny to go up to the Skypark Observation Deck on the 57th floor. We found access well signposted. If it is a cloudy day you may find the night time viewing preferable.
,,view galore,4.0,,"The views are incredible and that's about it, not much more to say, go and say Ahhhh. There are probably not many sightseing points like this in the world."
,,Worth doing but no need to pay!,4.0,,"There are excellent views from the Skypark once you find the entrance which is difficult. You can either pay 23 dollars or go up to buy a drink, then it's free. We went up at 11.30 am to buy a drink but the bar was closed so it was free! Apparently the bar opens at midday."
,,Great views!,4.0,,Very interesting place and definitely a must in Singapore. Although dining up on the top deck can get a bit costly the views certainly make up for it.
,,Nice views but a little pricey,4.0,,"Went up to the Skypark with a colleague. At S$23 it's a little pricey because once up there you can only walk around one of the edges of the ""ship"" because most of it is reserved for hotel guests of the MBS. You still have good views from there though. And there's a nice bar where you can sit down and watch Singapore from high up, don't think you get this type of view in Singapore from any other building. So if you've got time go up there, if you've travelled that far to be in Singapore (be it for leisure or business), you might as well splash that money for the view."
,,The pooooooool,5.0,,"The whole purpose of going to this hotel wasn't really the hotel (although the service has been great). it was the pool thats the main attraction. We spent the whole day out at sentosa island with all those rides and everything. By the time we got to the hotel the first thing was the infinity pool. Must say, worth every cent. Though i suggest you go at night if you intend to actually want to swim or chill. less kids, less annoying people on the balcony taking pics of you swmming. On a minor note, just be aware that there are plenty of idiots taking their selfies standing right in the middle of the pool thinking they're top notch models. Then they'll complain you're getting them wet coz you're swimming. word of advice, ignore them and splash harder XD"
,,It has wonderful view of Singapore,5.0,,We had a wonderful evening on the Top Floor Deck of Marina Bay Sands Skypark. We went there around evening & we enjoyed both views - Natural in Sunlight & Awesome after Lights were on all over Singapore.
,,Fantastic views of Singapore!,4.0,,"Great views of Singapore, worth a visit, though you do get a staff photographers taking photos of you, so they can sell you it on the way out! Unfortunately you can't get a drink in the bar area, but there is a small gift shop selling soft drinks. The entrance to the lift for the obs deck is actually in the basement of the sands bay hotel, not the easiest place to find!"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,"This attraction may depend on the weather and the time of day that you visit. Even though the day we visited the visibility was poor, we went just before sunset. What a fantastic experience to photograph the sunset and slowly watch the city light up to be one of the most stunning views I have ever seen. All of the visitors there at that time were certainly enjoying the experience. So pick your time, evening I would say was likely to be best."
,,The best view of Singapore,5.0,,"Take the elevator to the top deck of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and resort, for a fantastic view of Singapore City.
Well worth the entrance fee and the best photo op in town.
Just notice that you will only be allowed access to the northern observation deck of the hotel. The rest of the top is only for hotel guests.
You can buy refreshments and souvenirs on the deck, just note that you will more or less be forced to have your photo takes before entering the elevator. The framed photos are offered for sale as you exit the elevator.
Save the experience for a clear day."
,,Over priced and over rated,2.0,,"Over priced, with little shade from the heat. Drinks in bar very very expensive. Go up the tower and don't waste your money."
,,Limited,2.0,,"You pay a fair amount to go up here and you are limited to only one end of the observation deck, the ship on top at the front. If you go on the flyer you see more it is airconditioned and you are given a map so you can pinpoint where you are. I wouldn't recommend this unless you just want to say you went up there."
,,What a view,4.0,,I think if I was choosing one from the Singapore flyer and this it would be this. I really enjoyed the experience of walking around the part of the deck you are allowed on and looking at the view and sneeking a peek at the pool with the Hotel guests in. You seem to be able to stay as long as you want.
,,Watch the Sunset and the Laser Light & Sound Show,4.0,,"A visit to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is something you have to do during your trip to Singapore especially if the Marina Bay Sands is in your list. You can avoid paying the entrance fee to the SkyPark if you are a guest of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. If not, you can still get a free access to the Skypark by dining at the Ku De Ta Restaurant. We got a 10% discount after signing in for free membership in the Marina Bay Rewards Club. The SkyPark's Observation Deck offers a 360 degrees panoramic view of Singapore City and its skyline. At sunset you can watch the Gardens by the Bay laser light and sound show."
,,Worth the cost,4.0,,"The cost to get up was around S$23 to get to a viewing platform, but for those that haven't been to Singapore before it's really worth spending the money to get a good overview of the city and to orientate where everything is. There is nothing to do once you are there but look at the view and take photos. Beware the photo they take of you on arrival will set you back S$50."
,,Views!,4.0,,"Wow! It's a bit pricey, but the views are pretty spectacular. Tourists can't see the infinity pool, but everything else you can see is really nice!"
,,just okay,3.0,,"If you have been to observatories in other major cities, say Empire State Building in NY or Willis Tower in Chicago, the views from the Marina Bay Sands observation deck will not overwhelm you. But if it is your first time to go up an observation deck, the views are quite okay. Tip: If you intend to get a panoramic view of Singapore's skyline at nighttime, go up the deck after 8:00 pm as the sun sets rather late in Singapore (we went late February, not sure if this is the case every day throughout the year)."
,,Great place to view the city,4.0,,"On a recent trip to Singapore, me and a co-worker who lives in Singapore stopped by the Sands Skypark to get a good view of the city. Wonderful views of Singapore. We got there about a half hour before sunset so we could see the city while it was still light then got to watch the sun go down.
It is fairly crowded and I hear during the weekend you must make reservations but there was plenty of room early in the evening.
No cost to go up to the bar but there is a charge to go to the lower observation deck which has more views.
Great place to start a Singapore tour."
,,Outdoor Singapore Views,5.0,,"I have a large fear of heights although, when in Singapore did not want to miss out on the views from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. It was well worth the small amount of anxiety. There is an admission fee, which if you are 65 or over with your passport available will be admitted at a Pensioner Discount. There are no time constraints on the Skypark & the elevator ride requires equalizing your ears. The views were sensational! Cameras are a must & do call ahead to confirm that it is open to avoid disappointment due to weather as this is an uncovered decking area up on the 56th floor. There is a Bar & Resturant available bookings are a good idea & a Gift Shop & Professional Photographer too."
,,Great view for FREE,5.0,,"Most people are fooled into paying 23$S to go up to the sky park however all you have to do is say you want to go to the bar and you get up for free in the hope that you buy a drink. However we were not in any way asked to buy a drink at the top, we just took some photos and headed back down.

This was definitely a must, it cannot be missed out on. You also get free wasabi chips."
,,Awesome architecture,4.0,,Great piece of modern architecture.This is the landmark building of Singapore. One of the must-see's after the Merlion!
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"Its one of the most amazing places which I visited in Singapore, Absolute woth of money you pay to get here...The View is amazing in the evening...Not suggested if you are scared of heights..."
,,Not worth it!,2.0,,"Dont waste your time, to expensive to go up for the view; you cant see the pool or gardens, not even have a drink up there! .................."
,,Not so exclusive,5.0,,"Travelled to Singapore recently for a Birthday trip, my 4th time in Singapore. Opted to stay at a the Fullerton hotel this time. It was my girlfriends first time in Singapore and i wanted to show her the skypark and infinity pool. Alot of the places say that the infinity pool is exclusive for hotel guess only however this is not the case. I was told by consierge that i would pay 100SGD to use the infinity pool for the day definatly worth it. Although Marina Bay Sands is a wonderful hotel i wouldnt stay there again just get access to the pool. Its to much of a tourist attraction and inconvenient for public transport."
,,Lovely area,4.0,,Shops are all the labels stores so very expensive. food court was very good and cheap. lights and show at night was beautiful
,,Ariel view of Singapore City-Must Visit,5.0,,"I have visited this awesome place during my 3rd trip to singapore. The tickets were purchased online. Have visited by around 11 in the morning and spent around 1 hour. from the observation desk we get an Ariel view of the singapore city with lots of photograph opportunity. It was a very nice experience. Also note that Marina bay sands is a 7 star hotel. Got the oppurtunity to visit its lobby as well...

The hotel was developed by Las Vegas Sands (LVS), it is the world's most expensive building, at US$ 4.7 billion, including the cost of the prime land of 15.5 hectares. .

Ticket rates are below.

S$23 for adults

S$17 for children (aged between 2 - 12 years*)

S$20 for senior citizens (aged 65 years and above)

Children under 2 years may enter for free."
,,Not worth it.,2.0,,"from the moment you arrive, you think its Disney or something. Too many people running around in the lobby. The hotel is more a tourist attraction. Must say, níce view from the pool."
,,Worth a visit: Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Mall/Casino and the Skypark,5.0,,"One of the newer attractions to dot the Singapore skyline is the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Skypark.

The hotel itself has amazing brand shops lined up (for window shopping of course! :-))
They also have a Casino with free entry for Adults over 21 years. No Children allowed, so we missed out.

The next big attraction is the Skypark Observation deck which is essentially a part of their sprawling rooftop. It's divided into two parts. The infinity swimming pool is accessible only to the guests while the Skypark is open to visitors.
Tickets are available at the basement. SD 25 or so.
No need to book in advance.

There is no time restriction on the amount of time you spend on the top.
A good idea is to look for clear weather/no rains and get to the top about half hour just before it gets dark.
That way you get to see Singapore day time and experience as the lights come on.
The deck is open with no shade. Avoid hot days and bright sunshine as you won't be able to spend enough time there. Evening times are perfect.

The Singapore flyer is right beside the Bay Sands but once you see the views from the Skypark. it is not necessary to pay the price for the flyer."
,,Beautiful scenery at the Top of Singapore,3.0,,"It's a highly rated place to go in Singapore. The view at the top is definitely magnificent. So it's worth the visit.
Do bear in mind that this place is really popular and the pool up there is always full and crowded. If you are not the guest at the hotel, you will need to pay $20 to get up there to enjoy the pool and the view. Seriously, given the crowded pool, you probably will not enjoy it much. So the alternative is to get a drink at Lu Te Da Club Lounge which will cost you less than $20 to enjoy the scenery and the drink. If you are the guest at the hotel, please do go up and enjoy the facility and take in the view."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Singapore has developed at such a great pace over the past 30 years. Some of the modern developments could have destroyed the older cultural and heritage sites but they seem to have been able to blend both without either suffering. Has to be the easiest city in the world to get around.
,,Nice view up here,5.0,,"Try to have a drink or have dinner up here. There's a bar and restaurant up here. The view is also great and the infinity pool is nice. Best to visit in the evening, where it is not too warm."
,,Fantastic skyline view,5.0,,"Beautiful overview of the whole of Singapore skyline, with view of Indonesia as well. Night scene is fantastic. Not to miss , must visit."
,,Imagination PLUS,5.0,,The mall below is extensive. The food court delicious. High end restaurants galore. And the Skypark is a fairy-tale land beyond make believe. Don't miss the nightly water and music shows by the bay.
,,Great View,3.0,,"The view is spectacular, but that's all there is - very hot during the day and basically you go up, walk around, check out the view and go back down. But definitely check out the Coffee shop on the ground floor. The cakes are to die for."
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,Had to visit this impressive landmark which can be seen wherever you go. Took a ride up to the 57th floor of Tower 3 and had drinks and nibbles whilst taking in the spectacular views of the city. Definitely a must if you get the chance.
,,Very good view,5.0,,Marina bay sands and one altitude are only 2 places from where you can get good view of Singapore. Very beautiful view specially view of Highway. Best time to go there is toward evening. its not very hot in evening and you can get view of day time and night view. Both day and night are worth the time. Reach there by 4pm. After 5pm its gets bit crowded.
,,Skypark should be free.,4.0,,"I'm not sure why anyone would pay $24 to visit the Marina Bay Sands Skypark when you can have the same views for free by taking the same elevator to the Skybar of the Ku De Ta restaurant on the premise of ordering a drink. We went on a weekday at 3pm when visitors are still allowed to wear short pants (at 6pm trousers are required). No one bothered us to buy any of their $20 drinks so we didn't. And they didn't ask us if we were guests of the hotel. I believe the restaurant and bar are open to the public. We just took pictures of all the great views for free and then left. You can view the Infinity Pool from the side, but you cannot cross a line to walk in the pool area."
,,What a lovely night view,5.0,,Ahhh!!! when i remind of the sands sky park i am always thrilled. What a view of the city this place has. Standing on the 56th floor of the world's most expensive building itself is a great feat to achieve. I was lucky enough to be there on 9th August which is the National Day of Singapore. All the air shows and fireworks and water show... AMAZING!!!! It was truly a lifetime experience. I would suggest to go to the Sands Sky Park on 9th August and the timings of your visit should be not late than 4pm. Only then would you be able to witness all the lovely and amazing shows you'll remember for a lifetime!!!
,,Great Views of Singapore,4.0,,"Great views, unfortunately you have to be a guest of the hotel to view the infinaty pool, you are restricted to one level for viewing there is another level with a restaurant but that is for patrons only !! price is about singapore $24 so not too bad for some fabulous views."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Awesome and fantastic view of Singapore, we took a lot of picture with different background view and bought the t-shirts there"
,,Amazing View of Singapore's CBD,5.0,,Wow! We were amazed with view and wished we had the same in the Philippines. Our pictures don't give much justice.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark 2014,5.0,,This is another top thing to do in Singapore. You will get fantastic views from here all over Singapore . It's just a shame that you cannot use the restaurant it's for the hotel guests I think they are missing out on that one as you have already pay to go up . Never mind it's expensive to dine there !!!!!
,,"What a great place to be , Day and Night !!",5.0,,"We to view the City from the top of the"" Marina Bay Hotel ""
Looks great from the top and street level.
Thought the price of the photos were overpriced.
We came back at night, simply amazing , great fireworks display and the LV building is Impressive ."
,,Excellent view of the city at night,5.0,,"Personally I thought this was well worth the money. I really wanted to say I'd stood on the 'boat' at the top of the hotel and also wanted to see Singapore at night. I did the Flyer in the day which gave me a good overview but Marina Bay is beautiful at night. If you flew with Singapore airlines then take your boarding pass with you and you get 10 or 15% off (I can't remember which it was). Yes, the viewing area is only part of the boat, but in comparison to the size of the Empire State building viewing platform, its a similar size. I went up at 9pm and stayed to watch the 9.30pm light show from the top."
,,Excellant for a first timer,5.0,,"There might be people's advising that it's not worth the money. But my take is, if you go up just before the (an hour or so) sunset, you can enjoy a beautiful view of the sunset as well the view of Singapore.

For me, it is worth the money...

Tips: Don't let other sway you. If you want to go up, then go. If not then don't. Cause you might end up dissapointed"
,,"Amazing Views, Annoying People",3.0,,"WAY TOO CROWDED!

For what we paid to stay in this hotel, I was hoping it would be more relaxing and less crowded with families and children.

That being said, the pool is breathtaking and the views are unreal. Just don't get to close to the edge... it is REALLY easy to fall off the side of the infinity pool with nothing to catch you... haha just kidding. It's fun and safe!

The pictures they take for you in the pool, are hilariously expensive. Like hilarious. $300 album hilarious."
,,"Water, Water, everywhere.....to enjoy!",5.0,,"Don't miss a drink at the Marina Bay Hotel and see magnificent views. Lots to do in the area. Views from any of the skyscrapers are fantastic. Easy walking to many attractions like Gardens, fine dining, boat rides, etc"
,,What a disappointment - view great but service and staff below average,1.0,,"I was really looking forward to seeing the view from the Skypark and having a cold drink in the bar watching the sun go down on my recent visit to Singapore. I dressed appropriately and looked more like a hotel guest than a tourist but the staff and service in the bar at the Skypark were nothing short of appalling.

After lining up at the bar and ordering a beer, I handed over my money, received my beer but no change. When I noticed the bar man making further drinks I asked about my change and he said to wait a minute. It wasn't until then that I noticed they had one person as a cashier who was processing all the payments! When I finally received my change, I found a table to sit at while savoring every slip of my almost $19 beer!

My friends joined me a short time later and I asked for a menu to order some food and was informed that the food closed at 6pm. That was fine, my friends ordered a drink and I was then approached by a staff member advising that I had already been informed I had to vacate the table as they were fully booked for dinner. I informed the man that this was the first I had heard that I had to vacate the table and he responded that his colleague had informed him that I had so I informed him again that I hadn't!

This will be the first and last time I visit this place. The view might have been spectacular however the service and the way the staff made me feel was absolutely disgraceful."
,,head up,4.0,,"wondering if its worth it? true it dies feel a little like titanic (us & them, visitors & hotel guests) but its a long long way up, the views are uninterrupted & there are drinks available to sit on the deck & admire the vista. On a sunny day you won't last long in the direct sun - so perhaps go early morning or for sunset & the light show.

there isn't much to do once you've walked around the small area a few times"
,,Great way to view Singapore,5.0,,"We found this to be a great way to get a view from up above of central Singapore. I have been up twice, and the earlier in the day you can do it, the less crowded you are likely to find it. The entrance to the skypark is at the far north end of the Marina Bay Sands and one actually enters from outside the hotel towers themselves.

Access to the skypark does not include any access to other areas of the sky ""deck"" including dining establishments / bars."
,,great view,4.0,,"On my bucket list was seeing this spectacular hotel with three towers and they're connected by what looks like a big boat up in the sky. It's pricey to go up but if you only do it once it's well worth it because the view of the bay and the city is spectacular. What I didn't like is I didn't get to see the infinity pool but didn't know they only let guests in to see that. While I understand that it was disappointing to fly 7,000 miles to see this thing and not be able to watch a sunset at the pool. We just had drinks because the food is very expensive. Singapore is very expensive!! My husbands Corona (yeah a Corona) was $16. (that's US) and my coffee with two liquors was $18. I wanted a singapore sling but by the time one added up the initial cost, service charge and tax it was almost $30. No thanks. But the coffee was excellent. The wait staff was okay but less so when they knew we were only having drinks. Even an appetizer for the amount you get was very over priced. But definitely worth going to once. The bus system is good but an all day pass is $30. I think the subway would be best. But a beautiful city and I plan to go back at least once more."
,,View point of Singapore!,4.0,,"It is certainly worth a visit as this is the central monument of Singapore! You get a great view of the whole city! Be aware that the bar, lounge and restaurant have European prices and I do mean on the higher end. It's not excessive but as a backpacker, it may hurt... The view point is free of charge!"
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,Merlion park is historic place to be visited during your Singapore visit. You must have a photo with Merlion in your Album. The area is a tourist spot and should not be missed.
,,Aikido trip,5.0,,"This attraction seems expensive on first look 23 Sd to ride in a lift. But believe me it is well worth a visit, the views are spectacular and breath taking. On your return to terra firma there is a very large shopping mall underneath it, both exclusive shops and the more affordable if you keep walking. There are Saipan rides also but we didn't see them."
,,Great Sunset views,4.0,,"I have visited Singapore many times but never visited the Skypark. However, on my last business trip, I visited a business meeting early & decided to visit before dusk. I was rewarded by great views in both daylight/nighttime. You're able to buy drinks/snacks & therefore won't feel left out as the hotel guests sip their cocktails & strain their necks to see the view but looking down their noses from Ku Da TA ( the view is better from Skypark); although the view arguably is better from MBS' infinity pool."
,,Nice Views,3.0,,"We thought it was a bit on the expensive side compared to other attractions. That said, you do have views but did not have the wow factor"
,,a Must + little tips,5.0,,"hi all
1) perfect view ! awsome ;-)
2) some areas are not allowed (eg pool, is only for hotel guests)
3) 2 bars, but a bit expensive eg beer minimum 20S$ (could be a problem to get in during peaks)
4) by mistake we used the ""wrong"" elevator, a hotel guest had a card and took us to the top (sorry sorry for that!!)
5) watch the light/water show (8pm, 9:30pm) NOT from the top, watch it from the bottom, right in front of the show are seating possibilities (once again: awsome)
6) recommend weekday evening/night ;-)
cheers"
,,Not satisfying,3.0,,"It's just wonderful and stunning when you see it from afar but when you get in and go up, the view is boring for the money that you paid for. I suggest if you are curious on how it looks like at the rooftop, just get in at the bar/ restaurants so you don't have to pay anything."
,,Absolutely Worth for the Panoramic View,5.0,,"Although it was an expensive affair to watch the entire Singapore , but if you have not seen this view at night , you have certainly not Singapore .

It was Magnificent to watch the entire view of Marina and the Sea from this height .

Restaurants were reasonable on their pricing and service was prompt ."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Firstly, for the travelers who are fond of architecture and buildings, you guys must see this. Secondly, the inside too, is very beautiful and we went up the top floor and the views were exceptional. There is a mall and casino on the lower ground floor and basement, which were really impressive."
,,Go try the Jacuzzi,4.0,,"If you manage to find a timing to go to the pool without the crowd photo bombing your photos this place would be pretty amazing! I'm quite impressed by the jacuzzi it actually feels like a massage! My greatest take back for this place is actually the jacuzzi, although the view is pretty crap when you are in it."
,,Magnificent View,5.0,,"You can view the whole country from here. The best place so far in Singapore. Don't forget to take a peek of the infinity pool. However, the entrance is for hotel guests only."
,,Too pricey for just a view of the city skyline,3.0,,"It is an expensive way to get a good view of the Singapore skyline, just one item off your bucket list since Marina Bay Sands is reputed as one of the topnotch hotels and an iconic representation of modern Singapore."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"We went there for an evening drink, and it literally took our breath away. The view you get is amazing and definitely worth the very expensive beer!"
,,Hmmm...Beautiful But....,3.0,,"This was a weird one. The hotel itself is breathtaking and it has a great location.

The hotel lobby feels just like a shopping as anyone can hang around in there ( at least that is the impression)
In order to see the famous Rooftop Pool. You will have to pay a considerable amount of money ( I can't remember how much) HOWEVER, this does not entitle you to swim in the pool as this privilege is reserved for those staying at the hotel."
,,No pool view,3.0,,We were prepared to go up but found out before buying the tickets that you are not allowed to see the swimming pool. My daughter was eager to see the pool but with no access to it we decided not to pay the high price just for a quick view.
,,Sight To See,5.0,,"We saw this place from our hotel and it just called out to us! An amazing structure of 3 platforms with a boat shape building on top. The view of the city and sea from here was so amazing! There is a price to pay to go up and also an opportunity to get a picture (for a price), also a restaurant which you can have something to eat or drink at (this is as far as you can go without being a hotel guest).. definitely a place to see in Singapore!"
,,Wow!!!!,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands houses a Casino, Shops, Theatres, Art Museum, Hotel, Conference Centre, Exhibition Centre and River where you can take a gondola trip. The shops are designer and wholly bespoke, where you need a serious amount of money to spend there as are the restaurants. That said, visit the basement where you'll find an array of foods to choose from at affordable prices. Customer service and friendlyness throughout the fabulous complex was excellent. The whole place was an experience. We took the lift to the Skypark, observation deck (you can opt to have your photo taken prior to this). You are lifted 200 metres high giving you magnificent views of the Marina, Singapore Flyer, Sentosa, Docks, Gardens by the Bay and more. Just amazing and worth every bit of $23. However, if you visit congierge on 2nd floor prior to visit you could get discount on various attractions to include Skylark. :-)"
,,Over-rated and over-priced,3.0,,"This is a very brief trip to the top of Marina a Bay Sands as the viewing area which you have access to is very small. The experience is over-priced but I am still glad that I did it just to see what all the fuss was about. I won't be making another visit though.

Just a word of warning... The barriers are glass so not a great idea for anyone afraid of heights (my husband was terrified and couldn't wait to get down).

Wait for a clear day for the best viewing and photo opportunities. It was extremely hot so be sure to take water & a hat."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"The 2nd time I have visited here, this time with my wife. An amazing view! No rush or time limit. Enjoy a beverage at the bar if you can. A must do whenever you visit Singapore!"
,,A must see in Singapore!,5.0,,The view from up here was amazing and a must see when in Singapore. We will get a room on our next visit and use the pool facilities. The cocktails at the bar are fantastic.
,,Day time visit,4.0,,"We went up to the Skypark as soon as it opened as we only had a short amount of time in Singapore. The view was incredible, definitely worth it. However we thought they could have dressed up the lift (similar to the Top of the Rock lift in USA)."
,,Head for heights is needed for this one!,4.0,,"What fantastic views of the whole of Singapore we went up in daylight on quite a clear day so excellent, your only allowed on the observation deck part, and apart from the views up there there's only a little gift shop and a bar (not sure if that was only for residents.) with the curvature of the building you could just about see the rooftop pool but only residents are allowed in it, the pool was smaller than it looks on all the pics I've seen so I did wonder how it coped with all the guests for this massive hotel. Any way if your going to Singapore and you have a head for heights go up it's an experience."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"Singapore by day and night are unique, and the Skypark offers the opportunity to experience both. Perhaps even better if one is staying in the hotel, because the infinity pool is not to be believed."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"Though the area where you can roam around won't extend to the other end of the building (as the pool is exclusive for hotel guests), it's worth it.

I recommend going up around 5pm and staying until sunset since there's no limit on how many hours you can stay.

We really enjoyed the view. :)"
,,A must see!,5.0,,"Visit Marina Bay in the evening to view the laser light show of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is a visual spectacle. It is also a multiple point to see the city icons like Marina Bay Hotel, Marlion and business districts."
,,Extraordinary,5.0,,"This is well worth the effort, go for a drink at the bar. Cant get on to the bow, but can get the full impression anyway. Surprised me it wasnt as expensive as I thought it would be."
,,Great view when not hot,4.0,,Stopped at the bar at Marina Bay Sands. View was amazing but the heat was intense. Drinks were very expensive but then that is to be expected. The bathrooms were very cool surrounded in stone slabs which kept the heat down.
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,"Best views of Singapore, expensive but worth it for the photographs you will get. If you can get here for sunset (6:45) even if it is cloudy you will still get photographs in daylight and nightfall. Obviously it's pricey but I think that is to be expected. If you want to see Singapore in all it's glory, dip your hand in you pocket and fork out for this. I think it was well worth it."
,,an impressive view,3.0,,a great place to look out over the city but you have to pay to go up in the lift. Cafe prices inside are steep - as expected. The air conditioning is a relief from the outside humidity
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,"Visited the skypark on 16 oct 14, only to find out there is no access to get photos near the pool as you previously could do.

The ticket just allows walk from one end of building to the other. There is a big push prior to enter the lift up the building to get your photo taken to purchase.

Views were great but $23.00SGD not really worth it."
,,All hype,3.0,,Came here after eating at Ku De Ta. Great view which enchants you all of 5mins. Then it's like ... crowded ... and the pedestrian traffic is poorly planned. Only tourists need come. Once.
,,Fantastic place with awesome views,5.0,,stayed 1 night between destinations and what a great place to spend the night. Checked in early without any drama friendly staff from the moment out of the taxi. Very comfortable room with more than enough amenities on hand. Luscious king size bed that you could sleep for days on. Sky park pool with restaurants and bars were fabulous. Nothing could fault the amazing experience had at Marina Bay Sands. Will without a doubt definitely stay here again if ever to return to Singapore
,,"Great views, but overpriced",3.0,,Higher than the flyer and great views. Go on a clear day and enjoy the sunset and the lights of the flyer and the city skyline.
,,Should have paid for the Flyer instead,3.0,,Great view from the Skypark but it lacked something to make it worth the $23. We should have paid the extra dollars to go on the largest ferris wheel in the world. It looks like it would have been a better experience.
,,Views over Singapore,4.0,,"Picked up this tip from a local, don't go up to the Skypark viewing platform of an evening. Go to the Ku De Ta restaurant desk on the ground floor and say your going up for a drink. Okay you can't get onto the viewing platform but your in a bar above the platform with the same view and a glass of wine in your hand. You don't pay the fee then. Oh we did also stay for dinner."
,,very good viewpoint!,4.0,,"I love photography and this is the apt place to click lots of pics and selfies! According to me, one may either visit Skypark or Singapore Flyer! Both is a waste of money. Personally, i felt the park to be at better altitude than flyer.
One down thing is when the sun is too bright, its really hard to stay longer!

All in all, its a great place to get a top view of Singapore. Must visit!"
,,Pricey,4.0,,"The views are amazing and the photo opportunities are everywhere. The buffet lunch is better than average. I thought the price was a bit OTT but lots of people go there, so..."
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"Even though my partner is not into touristy stuff per-say he lived this as did I - don't miss it, it's awesome, you feel like your in another planet , magical"
,,View yes,4.0,,"View is great. Of course.

Chairs are overcrowded and hard to come by. find someone leaving and get one! The staff will help as they come, but they are hit or miss.

Sat up here for four hours. Watched the tourist with selfie sticks fight to take hundreds of photos. They do like their selfies.

Okay vibe, but scaled to meet the masses. prices are as you would expect.

Go for a quickie of the view and keep moving with your night."
,,Great views but expensive,3.0,,"Thw views are really stunning, you have the city on your feet. It's really nice going there in the sunset but take into account that it's really expensive."
,,good orientation tool,3.0,,Spectacular views but the most expensive lift ride ever (S£23 each - about £12.50) worth a look especially to get your bearings of the city...but in all honesty these buildings are impressive to look at more than from.
,,Excellent view,4.0,,I can really recommend a trip up to the observation deck on the Marina Bay Sands. It cost S$ 23 but it is worth it. The view is amazing and at good weather you can see really far away.
,,dont miss it even if your afraid of heights like me.,5.0,,"this is where you catch a lift up 54 floors to the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel and have a lookout over the city. Cost S$23 and the lift is super quick which you then walk out onto the observation deck towards the front of the ""ship"". now I found this super scary but hung close to the walls whilst my fearless husband went to the edge to take some amazing photos. it was a fairly clear day and not too windy, much to my relief. You have a beautiful view all over Singapore and then the best part, NOT, was walking the other side to get to the lift. most normal people would have no problem but my legs went a bit shaky and was glad when I approached the lift. Just remember to look ahead, not down. defiantly worth doing but don't think I could stay at this Hotel as the infinity pool is up the 54th floor as well. Yep, amazing view if you like heights. Maybe next time would be good to do at sunset to watch the lights start twinkling. Probaly a lot more busy at that time thou."
,,Never has a Fanta 'slushie' tasted so good,4.0,,"On a good air quality day it's possible to see Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, on a not so good day, the haze blowing in from Indonesia (thanks to the slash and burn methods employed on the palm-oil plantations) the view is far less impressive. We visited in the early afternoon and while restricted in our viewing, we were still impressed by the views of Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore Flyer and the Harbour filled with ships. Be warned, on a no wind day it gets very warm and there is little/no shade. There is a small shop selling drinks and souvenirs, and we highly recommend the slushies!!"
,,First time experience on the top hotel,5.0,,"First time in MBS sky park but a lots of people going there to view the places. Top there are very windy. At night will be the best to enjoy and relax with friends, family and couples."
,,You pay for the views,3.0,,"Pro's - Magnicient views, great picture opportunities and I am sure better at night (we went daytime)

Con's - very expensive for what you get. $29 SGD and $20SGD children. Also you DO NOT get access to the infinity pool (which is an icon spot) and pool area as this is for the hotel guests...fair enough.

Overall you weigh up if the view is worth the cost. Probably only spend 30 mins up there."
,,Fabulous Place,5.0,,Its really fabulous place to visit. Anyone wil be freshen up by visiting this place. The skytower wilth every floor on outside of lots of flowers and plants is worth to see. Further park deligts with all over the greenery and colorful plants. Enjoyed alot...
,,Sky high! Beautiful View,3.0,,"You can get the tickets at the basement of the marina bay sands hotel then you'll be guided to take the lift exclusively for the skypark (there are just 3 buttons on the lift, G-56-57) which is amusing to me :) and it'll take u there in a second! Anyway , the skypark gives you the best view esp. At night when all the surrounding structures are lit. You can really see the Durian shaped ampitheater , the merlion, the Sg flyer etc beware thou the picture they take is worth $50sgd which is quite expensive for just a souvenir photo"
,,Love the view,4.0,,"We stayed from 6:30pm to 7:30pm, taken in the day and evening views...so different and yet just as beautiful. A must site to first time visitor."
,,not worth the noney,1.0,,"i have to say: it is a nice view. But not for 23 SGD! The Park, almost every attraction you can see on pictures are for hotelguests only. You are allowed on a small plattform, where you can see the flyer and the gardens from above. It is your decision how you spend your money, but i wouldn't do it again!"
,,Cool,5.0,,Great views and the place to really see how amazing Singapore really is. Fantastic place for a nice drink as well because it is pretty much always HOT!
,,A Cracking View,4.0,,A great vantage point to view the city. The skypark access gives you access to the 'bow deck' of the ship with views through a grass screen of the city. Worth doing just to say you have done it but probably wouldn't do it again.
,,Breathtaking City View from above,4.0,,"The awesome city view is best to view during night time. Compare day and night...best to view and prefered is night...as the city is lights up with beautiful scene.
Things to note:
Entrance fee: 23sgd for adult, 17sgd for children, 20sgd for senior citizen.
The photo taken before up the lift cost 50sgd with hard frame.which is expenisve. Without frame with just the photo, 30sgd. Marina bay sand area is consider expensive due to tourist attraction. Advisable to bring enough money for spenting."
,,Pool in the Sky,5.0,,"There is no doubt at all that the sensational pool that stretches across 3 hotel tower blocks is worth visiting. Best is to stay at the hotel and then get full access to the entire park, gardens and pool. Otherwise access is strictly limited to the pod at the one end."
,,Go to Ku De Ta for cocktails instead,3.0,,"Entry to the Skypark is about S$26, providing access to the viewing platform; however, one floor higher than the platform is the Ku De Ta bar & restaurant. During the day there is no apparent dress policy (I was in shorts & singlet, with thongs). I got the best cocktail for S$27, with the same view as the platform accompanied by a shaded table right next to the bar. Admittedly you can't go right to the edge like the viewing platform, but you're a level higher & overlook the platform. Ultimately, you get a cocktail & view for the same price, so if you just want a chill out experience go to Ku De Ta instead - it's free, just gotta buy a drink when you get there."
,,One time See..,4.0,,"Well I wont say outstanding but it is good at least you should visit once if you are in Singapore. Observation Decks/ Towers are good and give you a outstanding view. You are really want to experience you can even have a glass of wine at the Restaurant enjoying the view. But this experience has Cost to it.
As said one time See....Go n enjoy."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Love the place n the coctails not to mention the food. We were spoilt by the staff. Such friendly bunch
,,Underwhelming,2.0,,"There's no doubt Marina Bar Sands is a spectacular building, but Skypark is totally underwhelming. And that's quite aside from there being no park.

Before going up you need to realise you can only access a fraction of level 57. The area you can access has no shade, no seating and doesn't have 360 degree views (more like 250-270 degree).

Save the $26 dollars and try the Singapore flyer which has 360 degree views. On the plus side, you can stay up there as long as you like, which isn't the case for Singapore flyer."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,Amazing building! The view from the rooftop bar is absolutely amazing. Make sure to go at sunset. Must visit!
,,Luxurious hotel with best swimming pool,5.0,,I have visited MSB in feb with my wife and kid . We went to observations deck I don't remember the entrance fee but it's not so much I will say it's nothing because the view from observation deck is remarkable I can't say in words . Best place to visit in Singapore
,,WORTH HAVING A DRINK ON TOP OF HOTEL,4.0,,We went to see the hotel and casino. They will only let you go to top as a non guest of the hotel if you are at least going to have a drink. Two drinks $53.00 but worth it. This is a park with trees and a very large swimming pool overlooking all of Singapore across the bay. The casino is magnificent with great food and most types of gaming.
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,"Do visit this hotel with the skypark, it is amazing. The hotel is very luxurious, consisting of three huge towers, atop of which is the skypark - with infinity pool and restaurants for hotel guests, but a great viewing platform over Singapore for visitors. Well worth a visit."
,,It worth,4.0,,"Like in every city, the tallest point to admire the city view. If u pay just for the lift u got not access to see the swimming pool."
,,Great view,4.0,,We went up the sky ride to see the view from the top. It does give a great view out over Singapore. If you want to sit and enjoy the view with a couple of drinks go up to the bar within the hotel instead. There is nowhere to sit and enjoy the view on the observation deck and it free to go to the bar.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"one of the best experiences in Singapore, amazing views at sunrise and sunset, beautiful area for drinks, snacks, or dinner, the pool is amazing but it was too crowded and limited swimming, recommend visitors go early morning.."
,,Unique experience,5.0,,Definitely worth every penny. Fantastic bits eye view over Singapore. Visited in the afternoon but suspect it would be even better early evening as the city lights come on.
,,A great view of Singapore,5.0,,You get a great view of Singapore from the viewing platform. The lifts up and down are quick and there is food and drink available at the top. The only downside was that there was some pollution around which limited the view a bit.
,,View from Marina Bay Sands...,5.0,,"Take a trip up to the viewing platform on top of the amazing Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Views right across the city, worth going up there. Take a drink with you, it can be very hot up there!"
,,Busy busy hotel,2.0,,"Very touristy. Long check-in lines and constantly busy, regardless of time or day. As a result, the service is mediocre. Beautiful views and pool area but there are other hotels in Singapore with great views that have better service."
,,What a fantastic view,5.0,,Go when it is daylight but nearly nearly nite time as you get to see how it looks in the day and nite as the nite is more spectacular . You can have drinks and buffet dinner up the top . The view id to die for . Take you camera or ipad for the best shots
,,Impressive view,5.0,,My hubby and I recently went to MBS and the view of Singapore is spectacular. We went in the afternoon and it was simply amazing. Costs ~ $23 however it is definitely worth it! Would highly recommend to all! There is also a bar up the top as well so you cna enjoy a nice drink overlooking the view.
,,Absolutely Fabulous Building,5.0,,"We visited this unique Singapore landmark whilst staying with friends in the city. The place is buzzing around the clock and the hotel very popular. A tip for the rooftop bar is that they do not accept men wearing short trousers at night which is ""policed"" at the lift entrance in the lobby. It must be one of the must do venues in Singapore."
,,Had The Same View From Our Hotel,2.0,,"We went up to the top of the hotel for drinks and possible dinner until we found out you need to spend $80 minimum in the restaurant. The bar area has no seating and basically we had a better view from our hotel. If you just want to ride up in the elevator to the top, it is a $25 fee. Definitely a tourist trap."
,,A Must Do in Singapore,5.0,,"Don't miss the opportunity to grab this magnificent view of Singapore. It is a great help to orientate oneself, especially if your last visit was 20 years ago, like us. The best time to go is just after the rain, as not too many people will venture out."
,,Amazing View!,4.0,,A very touristy thing to do... A must if you are a fisrt timer to Singapore. Amazing view of the city. In short it is similar to visitng the empire state building Or the Rockefeller centre for the first time.
,,ok,3.0,,We went to Marina Bay to go to the observation deck on the big building that looks like it has a boat on top of it. Its 23SGD to take the trip up to the top of the building. They take your photo if you want it & that will set you back 50SGD. if you are really scared of heights I don't recommend the observation deck. I'm afraid of heights & spent most of the time in the middle of the deck not at the barrier as I felt dizzy. Great views of Singapore from here though although we went on a cloudy day & there was quite a bit of glare.
,,Love the view from the rooftop,4.0,,Get up to the roof for beautiful views over Singapore. A bit expensive and you don't get access to the pool. Worth it from a photography point of view.
,,Singapore 360,4.0,,"Get ready to be amazed by 360 view of Singapore. You know by hunch it would be great, but nothing gets you ready for the actual sight at twilight. If you book dinner at one of the top restaurants, you will get some of the view free! A nice closer to your Singapore visit."
,,Great Views,5.0,,"wonderful views of Singapore and well worth a visit. When visiting the reception area of the hotel, we were quite happy that we were staying somewhere else."
,,Wow it's high!,5.0,,It won't take you long to be amazed at the view (and your stay there will be short because there is nothing else to do at the viewing point) but a visit to Singapore needs to include a family photo opportunity there.
,,Get a Million Dollar View for SGD20,5.0,,"If you're not staying at the Marina Bay Sands, there's still an opportunity to view the city from atop this ridiculously amazing building—go to the Skypark.

There’s something about being skyhigh and looking at things from a different perspective. From the 57th floor, the city of Singapore looks like a miniature model. You can see the city skyline, the different gardens inside Gardens by the Bay, including the SuperTree Grove, the Singapore Flyer, the Helix Bridge, and a teeny-tiny Merlion across the way. Try to get here right before sunset and enjoy the already spectacular view."
,,Top view of Singapore,4.0,,"Visiting the place in between my workshops, spend almost 3 hours enjoying leisure walk from the Merlion status in front of the Fullerton hotel - passing the Esplanade, eating @ Makansutra, passing the Singapore F1 GP track and crossing the Helix bridge before reaching the site.
For a price, the elevator will take you up to the skypark. I was hunting sunset but too late. Still, the view is breath taking. For an acrophobic person - like me :), the glass wall gave you the secure feeling.
To the southeast - there's the Marina Barrage (Singapore Dam) & Garden by the Bay. To the east, the Singapore Flyer and the main stand of Singapore F1 GP track. To the northeast, the Merlion and the city of Singapore while to the southwest located the famous infinity pool of Marina Sands Bay Hotel.

All in all - worthy a visit if you're in the area.."
,,"Stunning view of Singapore, amazing architecture",4.0,,"You can find in Marina Bay Sands hotel the best view of the Singapore skyline.

It is hard to choose between the Flyer and Marina Bay Sands, but I suppose Marina Bay Sands has a slight advantage since you can take in an unobstructed (read: no glass walls) view of Singapore. The air is fresh and it feels great to be high up the Marina Bay Sands hotel!

Only guests are allowed inside the infinity pool area, and with good reason: too many people can crowd the pool, but not so much since the infinity pool stretches out pretty long."
,,Top Of The World...,5.0,,"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands Hotel for 2 nights. It was awesome specially the skypark and swimming pool was great. We enjoyed full view of Singapore from the highest place of Singapore. Specially the night view of Marina bay area and Sun set moment was awesome. It seemed that WE WERE IN TOP OF THE WORLD... We enjoyed the observation tower, cafe and swimming pool in the sky-park..."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Me and a friend visited Singapore for a short 5days. We planned in going to Malaysia for a day and take the overnight train before coming,but as soon as we did sight seeing in Singapore we realized there is much to see and overnight travel to Malaysia would be a waste of time and effort not that there's nothing to see in Malaysia but being on the road overnight and back the same day is much more of a hassle and tiring. One of our roommate in the hotel suggested to see skypark, ticket is 23$ but its all worth it he said. So on our 4th day we decided to go to Marina Bay Sands SkyPark. We have seen an amazing view at night in Gardens by the Bay overlooking the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Without a doubt the view was super beautiful. But being at the Skypark is another spectacularly amazing view. Up there you could see the coastline of Singapore and see almost everything in the City. Night view is even more beautiful. Would definitely visit again when i go to Singapore."
,,Have to see,5.0,,"Fantastic building, if inside, look up and fully appreciate the architecture, both inside and out.
View from top is unbelievable - can see 3 counties at once. I don't like heights, but was ok with being on top deck, so for those scared of heights, give it a try, can always stand inside if not liking the outdoors. Great night views."
,,Great Views,5.0,,Views of Singapore skyline from this vintage point are simply breathtaking especially at dusk and into the night as the night lights come to life. A very ideal place to unwind after touring around Singapore. You can also take memorable photos from here.
,,The Best of Singapore,5.0,,It is the highest place in Singapore with the wonderful view of the city. This place is a must to visit if your touring in Singapore.
,,Worth it for the view,4.0,,"I disliked the actual building the moment I saw it dominating the Singapore skyline- overbearing, ill-proportioned and a total lack of elegance. But our Son insisted that we just had to go up the highest point and see the view, and we were talked into it.

Glad he did! The view is outstanding, especially with a good camera. There is enough of it (the left had 'rounded end' bit) open to the general public so that it didn't feel too crowded.

Guards to ensure that the common people don't stray into the hotel guests section."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"I love the view from above. It could be easily access by train. Apart from taking pictures, you can have your meal there but quite spensy. I won't be here if I need to purchase the tickets, it's included in the package though."
,,amazing views and sight,5.0,,i like the viewdeck the infinity pool u can see lots of ladies in bikinis there is even a restaurant on the skypark lots of toilets very courteous singaporeans lots of foreigners and tourists in the skypark wow
,,amazing view,4.0,,"As hotel guest I get to access the Skypark for free and unlimited time. Almost 360 view. I came at noon so a bit sunny but the view is amazinggg. But stay there only 10mins to snap some pics and left because i don't know what else to do there..
I don't think will purchase a ticket to come back here again (unless its free i will come at night for night view hehe)"
,,Wowza,5.0,,What a view and amazing pool. The view at night is particularly stunning. The skyline at night is breath taking. Definitely worth doing.
,,Fantastic experience,5.0,,"Love the Skypark ,so much to see and do. Dinner was great plenty to choose from. Price was good.Drinks expensive for Singapore."
,,Limited Access,2.0,,"This experience is not dear that is in its favour. The impression form the ground is stunning, but unless you are a guest at the hotel the viewing park is modest. No seats to admire the outstanding view, and only a drinks stand. Entrance to the Cafe/restaurant appeared to be by pre purchased ticket from the box office down town. Views are stunning but combined with the heat and no shelter not a experience to prolong. The pool and hotel can been seen from the deck, but is totally for hotel guests not the viewing public. If you haven't got a lot of time in Singapore, I'd give this a miss."
,,Divine pool and views,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is fabulous, from the luxurious ground floor shopping area of the hotel the lift to Skypark is breathtakingly fast. Best to go in the early evening and wait for dusk to fall and you will see Singapore at its most glamorous best. From the beautiful city lights to the ships in the bay. Although I didn't stay in the hotel so couldn't swim in the highest, longest, scariest infinity pool in the world, it would be worth staying just to experience it. A wonderful place to enjoy one of the most interesting cities in the world."
,,Magnificant pool in the sky,5.0,,Wonderful place to chill out! Excellent when u are seeing the fireworks from the top near the national day!
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,"Fantastic views of the Singapore skyline. Best time to visit is in the evening just before sunset, so you can see the daylight view and then the nighttime view with all the lights."
,,Marina Skypark.,5.0,,Top of the Building and excellent view that can see entire Singapore and Indonesian Islands. Excellent experienced in the evening with nice cocktails serve.
,,Great Views,4.0,,"We visited the sky park, for the views, we weren't disappointed. We got great views across the city from so high up! It is quite something to look at from the ground too. Whilst it is worth a visit there are only certain parts you can use as the main part is for the hotel guests. I also think it is a little on the expensive side for what it is. However we did enjoy our visit!"
,,Awesom,5.0,,Do book a night at the hotel and you can use the swimming pool..highest in the world...Worth visiting
,,Breath Taking View!,5.0,,Awww - I just simply love the amazing view from the Marina Sand's Sky Park! Everything looks awesome! I am so impressed! I have nothing but love on this place.
,,Awesome landmarks,5.0,,"This place is a remarkable achievement of Singapore. I truly admire everything about it. A must visit if you go to Singapore. The fee entrance to the Garden By the Bay was reasonable, it is a place worth visiting too."
,,Awesome View.,5.0,,Another great place to be. Do visit the Dali Museum below too. Combo tickets to both places is a very good deal.
,,Amazing Architecture....Worlds Highest Swimming Pool......,5.0,,"Beautiful, Amazing, Class of Art, Costliest, you name it. There is a fee to go on the Top. AT the Bottom Casino is FREE for foreigners. Nice, coolest and costliest Hotel. Worth the visit."
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,The building with a ship on it. Awesome views across Singapore. You can see all the way to Malaysia from here. 56 floors up. Reasonably priced and no time limit.. Opportunity to get some fantastic pictures of Singapore.
,,Awesome view of Singapore,4.0,,The view from the Skypark is just awesome! On one side you can have a great view over the city and Marina Bay and on the other side is the sea with heaps of cargo ships. There aren't benches available!
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,I do think it's worth visiting even if you don't have a room at the hotel. The view is amazing. I am glad I went.
,,One Stop Travel Experiences,5.0,,"Experience Singapore for the first Time? This one of Singapore best spot they had. Must visit pace. Shopping Mall, Iconic Building, Museum, Jogging Track, Park, and it's complete in one areas. The best time to visit is in the afternoon, you can paly around in the outdoor are while looking for local citizen do the sport exercise."
,,Excellent Skyline view,4.0,,Its been a good experience to see Singapore from Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Water show in the lake in front of Skypark is also nice.
,,I recommend anyone visit this place,5.0,,I like everything i feel so enthusiastic there. you will all feel so happy you can see most of the Singapore from the top it is so good thing and a lot of people swimming with you from different nationalities.
,,Nice view,2.0,,You get a nice view. Nothing else. No access to the restaurant. Only a few snacks available. Entrance is not clear: you need to know what the Skypark is. You have to go DOWN escalators near the hotel main entrance.
,,Experience of the sky park,4.0,,One of its kind. Best place in Singapore. I had a wish dat if ever I go I will visit marina bay sands. Beautiful . U can have a lovely veiw of Singapore from this 54th level skypark. A bar nd a swimming pool on top will make u feel u r on top of da world. I loved it
,,Best view,5.0,,"I think this is on of the best views in Singapore, I went there with my friends for Valentines Day, we did a picnic and saw the sunset, we were just chilling there seeing kites."
,,Excelent,5.0,,That was really Awesome views from the top the Marina Bay. Really enjoyed the moment its a must place to visit
,,Expensive but a great view,4.0,,"We wanted to get some great pictures from up on top of the Marina Sands Hotel and the Skypark is the place. Be warned, it cost $23 each to go up and look around, there is no food or drink up there, as the bar and the restaurant is for the guests only."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Amazing views from the deck. There is a souvenir store where you can also buy drinks such as coffee or slushies, which come very handy while on the heat outside. There was no access to the bar the day we went there. They take you a photo at the entry that you can buy while on the top but $50 for a picture was a bit to expensive for us. Overall a very good experience."
,,No seats,2.0,,The view was fantastic bit with tired and swollen ankles from the heat I needed to sit. No chairs at all and signs everywhere saying no sitting on the deck. Even had I disobeyed the signs (as did about fifty people) I could not have got up again with dignity.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Any visit to Singapore isn't complete until you have checked out the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. You won't be disappointed,"
,,"Go just before sunset! best value, daylight, sunset & night lights",5.0,,"We arrived at our hotel at 6pm so just caught a taxi straight to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to get there in time for my wish to see the aerial view of Singapore in daylight, twilight/sunset and then night lights! Best idea! I LOVED it. Yes it cost $23, and we prob could have gone up there for free if going to the bar for a drink (yes you can get outside from the bar), but we weren't sure about the set-up up there so just paid $23 and went up. Snapped daytime shots from every angle, enjoyed the sunset, the watched the 7.45pm light show (Garden Rhapsody) over at the Marina Bay Gardens from the rooftop, then crossed over to the other side and watched the 8pm water show from there as well, enjoyed the night lights then walked to Satay Street for dinner which was a blast. Yes you don't get the best views of the light shows from up here (the best is to go back another night and watch the laser/light show on the hotel from the other side of the water, near the Merlion statue), but wow it made it good value, and is also not so stinking hot."
,,"Great view, terrible service",2.0,,"We decided to take have a drink at the bar on the top of the building, very nice view, very expensive drinks. After having spend 100$ on drinks we got told, that we cannot get out of the bar, on the walk around the bar, the security guy told us ""you already had the privilege to admire the view""... and we were send down. This was very disappointing and not 5 star-like. A real cash cow, no interest to warmly welcome tourists."
,,"""For the price, we can get more""",4.0,,"I had nice weather and I took a lot of good photos but
It was beautiful weather and I made a lot of nice photos. but I am still disappointed that I could not see the PARK and POOL because the visit was limited. As an architect would like to see the rest of the not only the side terrace. My suggestion: allow more visits and visitors from abroad should have a little advantage."
,,A must to see when visiting Singapore.,5.0,,This is certainly worth visiting. We waited until late in the afternoon when it was a little cooler and stayed for the beautiful light show. This is an extremely relaxing way to spend a few hours. Don't forget your camera.
,,"Excellent view, not so excellent price",3.0,,"Paid $23 to visit the famed Marina Bay Sands Skypark, only to be declined entry to the bar because of my dress code (which was just shorts and a polo shirt - mind the weather in Singapore). You are allowed free entry to the bar on the skypark, but if you choose not to have a drink or you are haven't adhered to the dress code, you are shuffled to the ticket office where you would need to pay $23 for access.

Superb views, but the entry price needs to be reviewed."
,,"Not really a 'park'. Disappointing,",2.0,,"S$23 buys you a ticket to mediocrity....
Sure, there are 'views' but the inference that it is a sky park is completely misleading. I had pictured a grassy area, some trees and maybe even a bit of play equipment for the kids... Instead, you emerge from the air conditioned building out in to the hot sun. No shade. Anywhere. (Unless you head to the kiosk) No seating. Anywhere. (Yet lots of signage instructing you NOT to sit on the stairs etc) No grass, no trees, not anything that would have you believe you might be standing in a 'sky park'. The views were not even 360deg... You can only access 1/4 of the deck. Couple the overall disappointment of the actual sky park with the pushy photography sales team, the self important security staff (because heaven forbid you might want to access the restaurant or pool!) and the RUDE ticket sales staff and I'd say resoundingly, spend a little extra and ride the Flyer!"
,,Fabulous view,5.0,,We caught the MRT to Bayfront which brings you to Marina Bay Sands. We had to walk the length of the building to get to the ticket office and entry point so it is quite a walk for someone not fully mobile. We arrived just after 6pm to get a daytime view and stayed until after the laser show at 8pm. Watching the sun go down was great and the view of the laser show was fantastic but we couldn't hear the integrated music due to background music of the Skypark. This was the only disappointment. We felt it was worth the $SGD23 each entry fee. They could do with some seating on the deck not just in the bar area.
,,Not satisfying,2.0,,"It's just wonderful and stunning when you see it from afar but when you get in and go up, the view is boring for the money that you paid for. I suggest if you are curious on how it looks like at the rooftop, just get in at the bar/ restaurants so you don't have to pay anything."
,,What a view,5.0,,At this stage costs $23 to get up to Skydeck. We'll worth it for the amazing views. Can spend hours up there as there is a coffee shop and so much to see
,,Substitute the entry fee for a drink,4.0,,"The attraction of coming here is to get aerial views over Marina Bay and the city. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with its three towers and “ship” on top, is the location and you would not have difficulty finding it. (We took a taxi to avoid the unbearable heat of just walking from the Fairmont as we were told the MRT didn’t have a direct route across).

With your back to Marina Bay, Tower 1 is on your left. This is the access area for the viewing deck at Skypark on floor 57. There is an entry charge of SG$23 for adults, SG$20 seniors and SG$17 children aged 2 to 12 years and no time restriction to the length of your visit during opening hours 9.30am to 10pm (11pm Fri, Sat & Sun).

Alternatively you can take the lift to floor 57 and go to the Ku De Ta Bar where a cover charge of SG$38 applies only after 9pm Fridays, Saturdays and on the eve of Public Holidays. Provided you buy a drink there’s nothing stopping you taking in the view. The restaurant has a minimum spend of SG$80.

There’s no access for non-residents to the infinity pool and hotel security is present to oversee matters.

We took another alternative and went to Tower 3 at the opposite end of the hotel which gives you a chance to wander through the building and gaze up the towering architecture - it’s quite a place. There we took the lift to floor 57 and the smart “Sky on 57” restaurant and lounge bar where the minimum spend in the bar is SG$30 for non-residents (don’t worry a couple of glasses of wine will take you through that); or a minimum spend applying to everyone of SG$50 for lunch or SG$100 for dinner. There is seating on terraces outside however one of the staff advised us against this as the heat was too uncomfortable at that time so we sat in the air conditioned lounge on a comfy settee and had our drink instead. It was all very pleasant and quiet. We followed this by wandering around outside on the east terrace facing the ocean and the Gardens by the Bay and then across to the west terrace with views over Marina Bay, the city and the infinity pool. The glass screens are not obstructive and we got some good photos. Yes we had paid for a drink however we thought this was better value than paying SG$46 entry charge for two adults and the same views. The Tower 3 area was much quieter than Tower 1 in our experience."
,,My first glance in Singapore,4.0,,"We went here at about past 5pm and it was not nice because of the dark & cloudy sky. After an hour it started pouring of rain so I didn't enjoy my lookout over Singapore. I suggest if you want to go here, much better in the morning or middle of the day for better viewing from 10am to 3pm so that you can see around Singapore by over looking at the top of the Marina Sand Bay park & you can appreciate the side by side views.

The entrance fee is quite expensive but you can't remember what you have paid when you are on the 57th floor that's the deck of the bldg that you can look around."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,"The best time to enjoy the view is about 5-7pm. That way you can enjoy the view of day time and night time which are both magnificent. Nice weather up there. You can also get souvenirs and food there. The prices are not quite reasonable but I don't think anyone would expect that anyway. What I don't appreciate much was the limited space for tourists. If you wanna see the whole 360 degree view, you have to pay for the overnight stay at the Marina Bay Sand and that way you can relax in the rooftop pool as well. I'd rather Anyways, the view was worth the wait for me."
,,Amazing view on Singapore,4.0,,The view is amazing! Would never regret to pay 23SD for this... even if found it very expensive even more when you arrive on the top and that the staff mention to you that you can't eat in the restaurant as it's reserved to guests of the hotel... FAILED!
,,See it free!,5.0,,"I read a review that said take tower one elevator to 57th floor and get off to look around. We did tonight. Went to glad windows and saw the view free and could see the infinity pool, too, through the glass. Then we went on other side of building and there was a man on the left checking people into pool area. We walked past him over to the restaurant area and there is a little area right there that you can look out over the water and Garden by the Sea. We had made restaurant reservations but after going up and seeing the cute from both sides if the building we went in and cancelled or reservations. No one batted an eye when we got in the elevator and zoned to the 57th floor. If you go, go up the tower one elevators and see the view for free."
,,If you must......,3.0,,"I understand the attraction,- once in Singapore, why not pop up to the sky deck.. However, it cost 20SGD just to get up there, and from the glass wall surrounding the deck you can not take a nice picture. But you do get to take a good look around, at least you will see half of Singapore, as the other half is the famous swimming pool, where you can only set foot, if you are a hotel guest. There is a tiny souvenir shop on the top if you fancy to splash out on a postcard, umbrella or a fridge magnet."
,,Try the ku de ta bar first!,5.0,,"After the skypark we then went to the ku de ta bar for a drink. It is on the same level as the skypark. Entry to the kudeta bar is free and the views are the same as the skypark, arguably better because you can see the infinity pool. If I has known this I would have rather spent the $23 skypark entry fee per head in the ku de ta bar! Highly recommend the iced coffee at kudeta."
,,awesome scenery for us,5.0,,"when I split it with a friend because he was taking care of his business, and I take care of my business.

I went this place to meet my clients, and I queued from the 1st floor to rise to the top of the marina bay sand, which is level 56 which is located skypark, my own photos while installing equipment in observed by several people.

I was asked by the doorman, Are you a prewedding photographer? , I answered yes i am. and he invited us first to reach the first lift of the queue is so long, wow its service is extraordinary great.

Then we rode the elevator to the top level where the skypark there, my ears a little watertight because I liked the location of the altitude. I am in a professional and direct them among the crowd. I really like this area.

I actually really appreciate the privacy of my clients with no self-capture, but they offered to photograph me, I did not think long, and I say yes once again.

singapore is my second home.

,,The view is awesome,5.0,,"Missed going here last year so went in June this year wow what a view It does cost to go up but I think it was worth it.
This hotel is something else I would have stayed but could not afford it unfortunately.
You can see a lot from the skypark and there are souvenirs you can buy if interested you can have a bite to eat up there if you like you can have a photo taken but I thought it was a bit steep so we took our own.You can look out to the ocean you can see all the ships waiting out there you can see all the buildings gardens by the bay and other land marks.
Whilst up there when you look across there is a wonderful swimming pool up there for the guests just amazing a very interesting hotel a must see while in Singapore."
,,Wow,4.0,,Visited last August. What a stunning building! We went to the bar on the 56th floor rather than the observational deck. I get a bit nervous with height so not the best place for me to be but even I could appreciate the spectacular views. Well worth a visit.
,,Stay here if you can afford it!,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands hotel is amazing. You have to stay here to use the rooftop infinity pool. I stayed here for one night purely for that reason. Beautifully equipped rooms and the pool is by far the best pool I've ever been to. Great views, service and photo opportunities!"
,,Needs to be seen,5.0,,"If you don't stay there, you need to at list tick it off your list, you can see the crowded pool but can't get into the area from the observation deck but the views are sweeping. it is also adjacent to the shopping centre which has some amazing little touches all of its own inclusive of a Gondala ride down the middle (don't get too excited though it's unique but more like a ride)"
,,Just go up there and enjoy the view,5.0,,"It is great form up above, not too cheap, but a great look out in Singapore if you have a couple hours either between flights or on vacation.
The signs on the rails outide are very informative and the view is spectacular.
The elevator ride only takes a minute or so to get to the 56. floor."
,,WOW,5.0,,We loved this 57th floor experience. It's totally worth the experience to go up and have lnch at the Ku De Ta restaurant at the top and enjoy the spectacular views and good food.
,,Well worth it!,5.0,,"Be prepared to pay a bit to get up the top! has to be done though, youll regret it otherwise. Went at night time when there was a gig on at the club up the top. The place was buzzing and the view is amazing"
,,Observatory Deck only,2.0,,"You will have to pay SGD 23 (after tax) for the Sky Park entrance, it is only to the observatory deck. The infinity pool areas are not available to public visitors. In the past yes, there was a path connected to another end, ticket holders could walk on the path and walk between pools (not into the pools or near the pools!) but now the public area is far far far away from the pools. If you are going there for the infinity pools (like what you saw on most MBS hotel photos online), you should book a room with the hotel.
It is very safe, drinks at the bar are reasonably priced. If you are a local bringing friends/family there, bring your NTUC card or Passion card for discount.

Personally, I prefer Singapore Flyer to Marina Bay Sands Observatory Deck. Firstly, MBS is the latest visitor spot in Singapore downtown, from MBS Observatory Deck, you can’t see the MBS itself as you on the top of the building. Secondly and most importantly, barriers around the Observatory Deck is very high for safety reason, I didn’t enjoy the view there as much as I did at Singapore Flyer (with full glass windows) and I’m not quite sure if the younger (or shorter) kids can see much views. If you want to see city view and you have kids, just go to Singapore Flyer, it is safe, totally unblocked views with the glass windows, kids will be impressed.

I had been to MBS Observatory Deck twice - once at night and once during day time - I still prefer Singapore Flyer."
,,What a view,4.0,,"Definitely the highest building on the marina bay area, the marina bay sands house the skypark which is the highest floor in MBS hotel.

It houses a bar, restaurants, infinity pool (imagine swimming to the edge and looking down)

It used to cost s $20 to get up to the skypark, but its free if you are a guest in the hotel.

Its a landmark.of singapore nowadays with marina bay as its backdrop.

Well.worth a visit to the skypark if you are in singapore"
,,Very nice at daytime and night,5.0,,"Marina Bay is very beautyfull
Go to 57 th floor enjoy one of the restaurants have a cool drink.
Enjoy the view of Singapore.
Great to relax here in afternoon.
Later have diner near the Lion which is on now and through the water in the water.
At night beautyfull view on the 3 hotels with the ship on the roof"
,,"Only for view, not pool",2.0,,"Careful, when you pay for the Sky Park entrance, it does not include the infinity pool area like what you see in photos. You only get on the Observation Deck.

Although the view up there was lovely and you can see whole of Singapore's skyline, they didnt really prepare seats/ chairs for people, so most people just sit on the ground to enjoy the view there.

Although it's quite windy and high up, everything feels very stable there, so you feel safe. no worries.

I didnt try the bar, but if you can afford it, please have a go.
From the observation deck, you can take a peak of the Infinity pool on the other side (like wild barbarians). but other than the view, and the bar, there's nothing else you can do except take in the skyline view.

$23 for that, it's not really worth it. if you're on a budget, i'd recommend you to skip it, cause it's not much. Nice view and all, but $23 can be of better use elsewhere."
,,Pay the price for the Skypark,5.0,,Expensive but a visit to the Sky Park will make you forget what you paid. Great views. Nightly water/ light showout front is free & amazing. Bring your passport if you want to go in the casino.
,,Ultimate view,5.0,,"You have a one day transit in Singapore, then just go up here and enjoy the view. Best view of the skyline, enjoy a drink at the Ku De Ta Bar and take lots of photographs. You can see the oil tankers out in the sea, the Singapore Flyer, the Formula One Track, skyline and many more attractions, all from a birds eye view... I watched the Formula One Race from up here, ok i admit, i had to watch part of it on the tv screen to see who was leading :-) but it was great fun. I costs you around SGD 20. Go there in the morning, not between 12:00 and 15:00 when the sun is the strongest."
,,Worth the effort,4.0,,Top top for the Marina Bay Sands Hotel if you fancy going up to the 56th floor Skypark rather than pay use the internal lifts and go to the 57th floor bar and buy a drink the view at the top is just the same and you get a cocktail to drink cheaper than the entry ticket! Was great watching the sunset whilst sipping a cocktail and taking photographs.
,,Wonderful View,4.0,,"Great View of Singapore. However, spend your money and stay the night for the infinity pool or pay for a drink at KuDeTa instead."
,,Amazing views :-),5.0,,This walk is worth taking the time to do and if you have the budget take the time to visit the bar abd the restaurant for a meal. Walk around and take the time to read the signs that set out what you are loking at its really interesting.
,,Bypass the Skypark and go to the Cocktail Lounge instead,4.0,,Outrageous charge of $28 to access the lookout. Go to the Ku De Tah bar instead and order an overpriced cocktail - we paid $23 but at least you get a drink for your money. Views are amazing and a Singapore must do.
,,"Great view , relaxation.",5.0,,"If you are not a hotel guest you can't go to the swimming pool area.
You pay for the observation desk you visit to enjoy the view. There is a bar you can buy a drink. It's taller than Singapore Flyer. You feel safe there despite of the hight and clear glass barriers."
,,Good but not Great,3.0,,"Entry to the open air Skypark at 56th floor, costs $23 for an adult, $12 for children under 12 and $20 for 65+. There is no limit to the time you want to spend there. A kiosk sells beverages, snacks and water as well. You cannot go upto the restaurant or the pool but can access 1/2 of the boat shaped deck with views of the waterfront and the city.

I wouldn't say it’s spectacular but its not bad either. $23 is a bit much according to me so one visit is enough to satisfy my curiosity :-)"
,,Dont pay,5.0,,Before the paid elevator is a stand that invites you up to the 57th floor. Ask for a drink pass and its free. Mind you a Coke is S$10. Dont need to buy anything but the photo ops are just as good. and its free!!
,,Nice view - shame about the boat .....,2.0,,"At my daughters request we went up to the MSB Skypark - I had been there one evening 4 or 5 years back when entry to the bar gave you entrance to the top deck.
Found the current set up - restricted access at the pointed end a little disappointing with no real view of the infinity pool that let's face it everyone wants to see. The view over Singapore is great but there is little or nothing else to do there so at S$23 each very overpriced - as were the S$50 green screen photos of you at the Skypark. Won't be going again - better things to spend money on, like the hotel itself over priced & over rated"
,,Impossible to miss,5.0,,"Seen from virtually everywhere in Singapore CBD this three tower hotel with a simulated ship,on its top deck is spectacular. Entering the adjoined lobby area from any of then three towers will give you a lasting impression and having a night time drink on the sky roof bar is essential"
,,Awesome view....but a bit of a rip off!,3.0,,"We went up to the Sky Park as the sun was setting. It gave us an exceptional view over Singapore. We stayed on the deck until the sun had completely set, so we were rewarded with the amazing view of Singapore at night, lit up with all the colourful lights. I was disappointed that we were not allowed to go to the restaurant for a drink or a bit to eat as this was reserved for the hotel guests. You are able to get drinks on the deck, however the drinks menu is rather limited and quite pricy for something served in a plastic cup!"
,,Must see attraction when visiting Singapore!,5.0,,"When I had to travel to Singapore for business, the first thing that popped into my head was ""MARINA BAY SANDS!"". It lived up to the hype! The sky deck was worth the admission fee (which some thought was excessive at SGD 23) and the views were breathtaking at night. When I go back, I'd like to spend more time to appreciate the view and have a drink at Ku De Ta!"
,,"Stunning views, obviously.",4.0,,"I enjoyed going up here, wasn't too busy as it was quite late on in the evening but when the city was lit up, it was beautiful.

Doesn't take too long to walk round, I was done within 10 minutes or so but I was also alone so no family taking lots of photos etc.

Definitely worth going but $23 per person could work out quite expensive for a family of 4."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,"Loved it, for guests only when it came to the infinite pool. You can pay a ticket to get to the restaurants/cafes at the top, but only guests actually staying at the hotel can use the pool. Really enjoyed it."
,,View of Singapore,3.0,,The latest Singaporean attraction. We visited the hotel and went to the Sky Deck. Very hot and no shade on the deck. A great place to view Singaporean skyline. Glad we didn't stay at the hotel the queues at reception were crazy!
,,Views to die for,5.0,,"Wow, if you are scared of heights, you still need to go to the top!!! I am, and I did and lived to tell the tale!! Amazing 360deg views of the city. Great architecture and facilities at the top"
,,Super wonderful !,5.0,,"It is already very famous for Japanese due to TV CM of SMAP in Japan !
And in the world we do not know such place and such building as it is very unique building.
Basically hotel guest can use swimming pool at the top of the building, but for outsider if you pay some dollars, you can go to the top of the building by direct elevator.
View from the top of the building, it is super wonderful to be able to see all Singapore island.
Please go there to make a story of travels to talk to your friends or family."
,,Magnificent Views,4.0,,This is a must visit when in Singapore even if you aren't staying at the hotel. Great views that you won't be able to get anywhere else in town. One criticism is that I objected to having my photo taken & being hounded to purchase a copy. Surely the entrance fee is enough to pay!
,,Excellent views of Singapore but go at night,4.0,,"To get here you'll have to go through SMRT North South Line and get off at Marina bay and take the circle line. Make sure to put Marina Bay Sands as your last station not just Marina Bay. Outside guests are charged $23 pp and you won't have access to the pool area, just the deck alone. You can only see that one of a kind pool from afar. Great views both day and night but it's best to go night time. Not much people by day and no long queues but not as good as night views.. Make sure to bring your camera! Their photos for sale are at $50 each! All in all this should be on your to go list while in the beautiful city of Singapore."
,,Well worth the visit,5.0,,Had seen this place being built each time we had visited Singapore so on this occasion we went over. Nice gardens and the sky-walk is a must do. Well worth it and good to get away from Orchard Rd
,,Superb Views. Worth staying at the hotel for this!,5.0,,"Just for this reason alone, I think a stay at the Marina Bay Sands is justified. There's nothing like swimming at an infinity pool 57 storeys high with a spectacular skyline below you. Stay around 7-8pm for the lights show."
,,Nice view,5.0,,"We had a nice evening there. view of the city from skypark is spectacular. especially at night . Its better to by 6pm , so that u can enjoy the view in day light and also at night."
,,Great View,4.0,,"View from Skypark , is wonderful view much more better that "" burj khalifa "" and N Seoul Tower in Korea , View of the marina is awesome i think that give more charm to Skypark"
,,Bird's eye view of Singapore,4.0,,"I went there in the noon time and it was a scorcher. To enjoy it better, would suggest to go in the evening. However, the view is great up there and you can see basically the whole Central business district of Singapore. Though I find the ticket a little expensive."
,,Marina Bay Sky Park in Gardens by the Bay,5.0,,"In the shadow of the Sands Casino (which in itself is a world wonder) this is just one high rise route to ‘The Gardens by the Bay’ and The Sky Park. This route has panoramic views of Singapore (we sat on the terrace there and had a hi-rise picnic ).

The whole experience from accessing and leaving the gardens & Sky Park is a feast of visual, technical and artistic delights. Art instillations , exciting visual innovative architectural textures and materials can be experienced through many access routes to the gardens. Stunning flora and fauna everywhere. I would definitely pay the $5 to access the sky garden walk. But I was disgusted by the service and facilities in the sky garden restaurant the Indochine. Stunning views but customers not made to feel welcome (Entry $10 to $18), The smell from the toilets so bad I would not go through the door (not at all representative of Singaporean standards) . However beyond that the rest of the Bay gardens are amazing and the adjoining water park for children is enlightened, perfect for keeping kids cool, safe and happy in the climate there. The cycle/walking path leads to other restaurants in this enriching environment that has blended city, nature, technology and art magnificently. What a triumph!!! We visited as often as we could. Loved being here."
,,You get it all from here,4.0,,We were contemplating different options for getting the best view over the city. And this one probably beats them all. The tickets are 22 Singapore dollars per adult so the its not for free. But I would say its worth it. Try to be there half an hour before sun set so you get the wonderful transformation of the city when the lights come on. The best time for photo is 15-30 minutes after sunset.
,,"Good view, worth a look.",3.0,,If you are in Singapore and have the time it is worth heading up to the Skypark to take in the views over the city. The $23 price tag is about what you'd expect to pay for a similar attraction.
,,Brilliant views,5.0,,The trip up cost 20 singapore dollars which was not cheap. The elevator takes about 40 seconds to get you to the top where you are rewarded with views of the bay and the city. Don't expect to be alone - it is a major tourist attraction.
,,Awesome Experience,5.0,,"Everything seems perfect here. Casino, Shopping Mall and above all the majestic building. One of the best sites of south east asia. Must go."
,,Good view,4.0,,Good views but at steep price. Book early as it may get full during peak hours. Better view at night just before sunset. Also checkout the infinity pool.
,,"Modern, high standard place.",4.0,,"Nice walking area. Safe, clean. A little to much luxury scene. Inside where the casino is, very crowded."
,,Great views with an entry fee.,4.0,,"Visited in the early evening when the cooling breeze made it more comfortable and the views over Singapore City could be seen in daylight and after dark, there is an entry fee of $23 reduced to $20 if you are over 65, the entire building is very impressive and the views were great, worth a visit."
,,Loved it,4.0,,Fantastic views of Singapore on a clear day. We managed to get some great photos. Worth the entry fee
,,Grand view,5.0,,"Given the choice between the Singapore Eye and Skydeck, Skydeck wins hands down. Walk the deck at your leisure, be sure to walk the stairs to view the infinity pool. No doubt a magical spot to hire the nightly light show."
,,What a view.,4.0,,We went to the sky park at the Marina Bay Sands ... And the view from the top is stunning. The building itself is quite impressive and the shops and hotel are as well . The infinity pool looks quite an experience but unfortunately as we were not guests at the hotel we weren't able to take a close look .
,,A must see but is expensive,4.0,,"We visited the skypark after reading the reviews. Yes it is expensive for what you get, but the view is amazing. Is a bit disappointing that the viewing area is so small for the charge they do charge but as I said it is worth it for the view. If you go in the evening you can go for free if you go to the bar (At the other end of the deck away from the viewing area. May be a better option for a group of more than 3 people. Would say it is something you should do however, and would rate it better than the Singapore Flyer."
,,Wear pants to be allowed in,3.0,,"I heard that the view is really nice up there and that there is a wonderful bar you could go to in the evenings. Unfortunately, one of us was wearing shorts (it is quite hot walking around during the day and shorts were the best option for him!) and we weren't allowed to enter. I had flip flops on for the same reason that it was just hot walking around Singapore during the afternoon but it was fine. The flipflops looked more like sandals than simple slippers and I guess that's why I got away with it. In any case, make sure to wear pants if you want to get to the bar."
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,"That's an amazing building, with great modern architecture, very interesting inside, beautiful externally and with cool views of Singapore (you can see both the city with Marina Bay's main attractions at one side and the Gardens by the Bay and the shore at the other side). The view is much better during the night."
,,good view,4.0,,"Went to the skypark around evening time.. Crowd started pouring in towards late evening since the night view of the city is most loved. Skypark gives a perfect view of the flyer, gardens bay, theatres and stadium. You can have good photo taking opprtunities and we aren't allowed to go to the upper deck since its reserved for guests. There are few mini snacks available for purchase. can stay for an hour max.
tip - late evenings give a colorful view of city."
,,Head up for a drink,4.0,,"For the amount of money it costs to go up and just take a look around I suggest you jump in elevator and go have a drink or 2 in the skybar it cost you nothing to go up and then you get more bang for your buck. Its exactly the same spot. same view.. same same,"
,,Great view,3.0,,"I went here with my collagues..there are 12 ppls. The cost is $SG 23. Nothing much to do in there, Just seeing singapore from the top. Only take picture, that""s it."
,,The best way to enjoy the city impressive skyline,5.0,,"I visited in the evening about 40 minutes before the the closure (11pm) and absolutely enjoyed marvelous views and few people around.

I would highly recommend this observation deck opposed to Singapore flyer, because here you don't have greasy glass to obscure the view and you are not limited in time to take in all fantastic views without moving up-down. And, yes, it's higher (and cheaper)! :)))

Surprisingly I seemed to like the ocean view most - with its numerous anchored ships.
I bet at daytime It's spectacular too!"
,,Great Views at a Price,5.0,,We paid a fee to take the elevator up and ended up having an excellent lunch at the restaurant up there. Unbelievable view of the harbor and all the ships as you can see from the photos.
,,very interesting architecture,3.0,,I took the one tower up to the top to a look out place. It was a very hot day and it was just as hot up there as down below. I took some pictures and you get some very good ones from the gardens below and a long way out to all the cargo ships. A few further steps up is an outdoor restaurant. You can have a meal or just a drink. There is also an indoor nice air conditioned little restaurant. However that was empty and nobody was allowed to get in. That would have been nice on such a hot day. You need to go down to the shopping mall to cool down.
,,Great views,4.0,,"We visited in the evening, which I think is the probably the best time, Singapore looks fantastic all lit up at night. The boards giving you details of the views are informative. The only downside were the other visitors who sat around the edge undefined the boards, making them difficult to access."
,,Expensive but a Must See,5.0,,"I was skeptical, $20 each to go up an elevator (I a town where 4 people can have a great lunch at a Hawker Centre for under $20) seemed steep. But once we got to the top, the cost was quickly forgotten. The views were unparalleled . Just go!"
,,Amazing view and cocktail bar,5.0,,"Wow, I love this building from every viewpoint and angle. Inside, it's noisy as in a large train station :-) and gets very busy. Therefore, take the elevator to the Sky Bar. There you can enjoy great drinks, reasonably prized for Sing standards, feel the breeze and get baffled by the phantastic views allround, especially later, when the Skyline puts on its night lights. There is a restaurant as well, so dinner is a great experience although the food is quite pricey."
,,The best view in Singapore!,5.0,,"I love this skypark - the pool is amazing with excellent view. The best view is at night - pool is opened till 11p.m. so you have time to enjoy it. You can get in pool only as a hotel guest but it is worth of it!:) When you want to see this place less crowded, go in summer time (july - august) ;)"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Marina Bay Sands is such an iconic building in Singapore that it's hard to go past the opportunity to take in the view from the Skypark. Although it is expensive (around SD$80 for family of four!) it is an amazing view and well worth seeing.
,,Woohoo,5.0,,"This place is very cool and architectural wonder. This is a must see from both the ground, (I think you can see it best at the Gardens by the Bay and via the river boat and from the top. The only other way to get a really good view of the city is from the Flyer. Do both."
,,Nice place but too crowds,4.0,,It's a nice place. Amazing view. But too crowded. Sometimes difficult to get a place. Otherwise worth taking a visit
,,The whole thing is quite striking!,5.0,,"Quick trip up and down. Bad weather but still this is a must see for all who are close. If you are in town for a few days, just pick a nice sunny day and go on up."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"This is an incredible experience, you have to do it. There are many negative reviews saying that access is limited (there is no access to pool, restaurant, garden etc.) but you are told that right from the start, it is an observation deck with some of the best views in Singapore. If you want to use the other facilities, stay at the hotel! It is well organised with short queues, there is a drink kiosk at the top and of course, the view! You can see nearly a 360 degree view from the sea and Gardens by the Bay, past the flyer, and Marina Bay. Don't listen to the bad reviews; it's really worth doing!"
,,At the Top of Singapore,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a 200 Meters high skypart at the top of the World renowned Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It is on the 55th Floor of the building that gives a wonderful panaromic view of the Singapore Skyline. It has an admission fee of 23 Singapore Dollars per person for adult visitors. The elevator to the Skypark is extremely fast and gets you at the top within 2-3 minutes once you're in it. Great place to sepnd and hour or so. The best time to get up would be at 6:15 and stay there till 7:30 to see Singapore skyline both in daylight and in night.
,,AMAZING,5.0,,Great place to visit. Amazing views and a must see and do. You could never visit Singapore without seeing this attraction.n
,,Splendid views all around.,5.0,,"We went with lots of expectations and equally well rewarded. Offers real good view of Singapore. To avoid the extreme heat, we only entered just before sunset. Spent a couple of hours and pictures were awesome. The small refreshment outlet helps.
All in all - very happy with this place."
,,Great view,4.0,,Instead of paying to go to the top we opted to have a drink that way we got a pass to the restaurant and bars and still enjoyed the views. In fact you get a better view!
,,A great view is spoiled by surly staff,2.0,,"I have visited this bar several times to enjoy the views at different times of the day. I find it extremely crass that apparently it is company policy to serve Diet Coke by the glass and not give one the full contents of the can. When I asked what happens to the rest of the drink the surly staff (on each occasion) inform me it will be used in someone else's drink (I THINK NOT!!).
What a ridiculous policy. If the staff were more friendly I would probably order a rum and finish off the diet coke in the can with that but I find the whole place pretentious and over priced."
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"My wife and I took the opportunity to visit Skypark after having having an afternoon tea near-by and having a short walk through Gardens by the Bay.
The price of $23 each was reasonably expensive but the opportunity to view Singapore from such a vantage point was worth the cost.

We stayed just to see the sky darken and some of the Garden by the Bay features start to light up. I would suggest that you should plan to arrive just prior to dusk so you can see the city in day light but not have to wait too long to also see the night lights and lazer shows etc.

The view is spectacular."
,,A different view of Singapore,5.0,,"In a city with many skyscapers, it is a change to be able to stand outside in the open and take the magnificent view all in. On one side a view to the city, the other a view to the sea. Combine it with a drink at the Skypark and make the visit a deal"
,,Worth a visit..,4.0,,"Take a lift from lower level of Marina Sands Sky-park.
Charges are $20 / person , within seconds it will take you to 56th floor , where stands the Observation deck of Marina Bay Sands . No matter what time of the day you go , it will always be crowded, no access to lounge if you have not done the advance booking .
View is Almost 280 degrees , you can just sit down and enjoy a wonderful view starting from corner of Gardens by the bay to end of marina bay front . Dont forget to buy the laser light & Sound show called ""Wonderful"" which happens in theater by the bay ."
,,What a view,5.0,,Well worth the time tracking down the somewhat hidden entrance. Really fabulous views of the city. Bit pricey but feel worth it. How can you go 86 floors in 15 seconds? Very fast I presume.
,,Spectacular night view of Singapore!,3.0,,We ascend to the top at about 8pm after visiting Gardens by the Bay. The view from the top was simply amazing. I wonder what does if feel to be at the top in the day. The ticket queue was not long (on a Tuesday evening) . The admission fee to the top was a little too high to be honest - $23 for a walk at the top which took us less than 10 minutes. Probably worth going if it is your first time but there won't be any returning visits for me in this short period of time.
,,Unrivalled views of Singapore,5.0,,"We were here for drinks and to watch the sunset over Singapore, what a glorious spectacle. The views are amazing, looking out to sea across the Gardens By The Bay - a photographers dream, particularly at sunset."
,,Best of the Whole Trip,5.0,,"We purchsed a ticket to watch the night view and lazer water show for $23 each person......Initially we thought its too much cost....but after watching the view it was just mind blowing.......We reached at 6pm,,,the view was awesome....but as the clock stuck 8 pm all lights were on,,,,,you feel you are in Vegas.....Its located on 57th floor where they have a Pool ( restricted for members who stay in hotel)...but you can enjoy the Dinning and drinks ( bit expensive ). They have a small shop as well which is reasonable to grabbing a sandwitch or beer ....But worth watching the lazer show, Garden by the Bay, Tall buiding..Gaint Wheel...."
,,Great pool & view,4.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for two nights at the Marina Bay Sands so checked out the skypark on our second day. Well worth it.

Views are amazing, the pool is great (take a waterproof camera so you don't drop it in the water.) and it's right next to Ku De Ta which is good for brunch. Food at the skypark itself isn't that great (just sandwiches by the pool).

Service by the pool isn't that great either so you'll need to go to the bar to get any drinks.

Worth a stop if you're staying at the hotel."
,,"The View, the best.",5.0,,"This is one of the worlds iconic buildings. You go to the top to see the view and you realise what 'trade' means as you see how many ships are anchored off the port. Makes the few container ships you see at Felixstowe seem like - well - a third world country!

We ate at the restaurant on the 'Poop deck' of the platform and watched the Founding day Fireworks and display. Expensive but worth every penny."
,,Okay Okay,3.0,,"This place is very average considering the fact they charge $23 Per Person for this attraction.

This place is nothing like Burj Khalifa where you actually feel on top of the world.

For me it was a very ok attraction, one can easily skip is. This is specifically for Skypark and not the area with the infinity pool."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Whilst it was expensive to visit the sky deck, the views were amazing. There is no cover so it was very hot and therefore didn't stay long. Still worth a visit."
,,Expensive but the views is amazing.,3.0,,"Rather paying for the admission tickets (at ~$23 a ticket), we went straight to the Sky On 57 Bar, we ordered drinks about $30 a drink and some munchies... We had a table facing the Garden By the Bay , the ocean and when the sun was down we switched to the city view. The views were awesome. We captured a video of tropical rains moving in to and across Singapore city... Really enjoyed."
,,Have a drink to see the sunset!,5.0,,"Great view. Have a drink, pricy (23 SGD for a magarita) but you can relax and enjoy the view and sun set over the city. Make sure you come timely, otherwise no seat with view available"
,,Very expensive,3.0,,"Last year, i visited this place for $15, now they have hiked it for $23. All they provide is a lift to the 56th floor, what surmounts to this huge charge, i cannot understand. There is no cover when it rains, exactly why this ticket, no idea.
However the view from this top level is mesmerizing."
,,Best view of Singapore town,4.0,,"Have been here a few times. It is still the best view along the pool to see the town area beside Singapore Flyer, i have to say the area is pretty small size. It is quite crowded during evening to night time. And to have the best experience with entertainment, visit during the national day where you can get to see the firework closer and aircrafts flying just above you.(If you want to prevent the crowd, you can go during their NDP rehearsal which is almost the same experience anyway)"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"The less expensive room is 420 sgd / night. The big hall is very noisy with many chinese restaurants. I felt like i was in china snd this is all i wanted to avoid. We did wait 20min to get our luggage delivered in our room. The phone near the bed table does not work simply because there no wall plug matching with their phone!! If you are being put on garden view side and are on floor 1 to 6, there is no lift going to the swimming pool!!!you have to go down in the hall change tower and take another lift! Not really convenient when you are in bathing suit and towel yo cross the hall/lobby with hundreds of people around. Unbelievable but true: the swimming pool water is very cold!!! We stayed only 10min in the water as we were freezing. On a more global comment: the hotel does not deserve the luxury status. It more an industry (1600 rooms!!!), crowded of people everywhere. I would more recommend to stay at ParkRoyal on Pickering which is much more personal in term of service, standards and privacy. And less exepensive than marina bay sands!"
,,Awesome,5.0,,The view was spectacular for one can see the whole of Singapore from the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands hotel. We intended to have a dinner in the restaurant but unfortunately one us was wearing slippers so we indeed up eating somewhere else.
,,Massive hotel lacks a personal touch,4.0,,"We had a 3 night stay coming home to Australia via Europe.
We were much looking forward to this stop over as we had heard great things.
Unfortunately our flight arrived early in the morning, on check in there were no available rooms which was fine however we were told we would be contacted when the first available room was ready... We freshened up in the fitness club and proceeded to the infinity pool on level 57 and waited!!!! And waited and waited @ 2.30pm we were very annoyed and again went to the check in... A room had been available for some time and nobody bothered to contact us.
Marina bay I feel lacks any level of personal touch which is probably understandable in such an enormous hotel.
The level 57 infinity pool is magnificent however getting a deck chair is almost impossible.
On a positive note breakfast in the club lounge was beautiful each morning plenty of variety and good efficient service.
We stayed in a club room which was nice on level 47 great views and comfortable beds.
Marina bay is great for shopping and easy to get around, has the MRT train system so getting around is really easy.
We enjoyed our stay minus a couple issues but probably won't rush back next time in singapore."
,,Awesome place.,5.0,,"A must see, come when the sun starts to set (I believe it's opened for public access at 6pm, for $20) and enjoy both the daylight and nighttime view."
,,You may need a key card,4.0,,We tried going up tower 1 but the restaurant was having a private event and we were told to go up tower 3. Got to the elevator and found out we needed a key card but the kind guests let us use theirs so we made it to the top without one. Awesome views. Only hotel guests could get to the pool area.
,,Views! Views! Views!,5.0,,"Need I say more? A great way to see CDB of Singapore, Marina Bay area, and the Gardens by the Bay from Above.

Casual clothing allowed during the day, but there is a dress code at night. Have a drink at Kudeta Bar and enjoy the sceneries."
,,Great place to go for a drink,4.0,,"Managed to visit the skypark and have a cocktail on Level 57 (entrance through Tower1), with a great view. Hint: Get there early at 6pm opening to ensure you can get a seat outside on the city-view side, as there are only a few seats available and if you leave it later, there is no guarantee you will get a seat - dress code at this end is casual (unlike the ku de ta restaurant at the other end which has a strict dress code). Fantastic views and they give you binoculars for free also!"
,,Make sure you visit!,5.0,,Highest infinity pool in the world and the views are great. Make sure you take the elevator to the top and see everything you want to see in Singapore!!
,,A rip off - don't bother going!,1.0,,"We thought this would be another ""observation deck"" style attraction which allowed us to see a 360 degree view from the top but the view for non-hotel guests is extremely restricted (only about 1/4 of the roof top). Most of the area is blocked off and only accessible for hotel guests. This includes the restaurant, bar, garden areas and pool areas. The available drinks and food for non-hotel guests also only includes soft drinks, juices, slushies, water, a couple types of bottled beer, chips and chocolates. There're are no chairs or benches - just wooden floor planks so if you want to rest or sit down and take in the limited view, you'll need to see on the ground.
Given the lack of view, lack of hospitality and lack of worth in this commercialized ""attraction"", I'd recommend everyone to save their money and spend it on the Singapore Flyer instead."
,,Excellent,5.0,,What an excellent experience! You should come here when they open the outside pools for travellers (2 times per day).
,,Observation deck versus bar,3.0,,"I hope this clarifies the options for people regarding what you see for which option. Basically you can either pay the 26 Sing Dollars (£13) each to go to the observation deck or go up to the Ku Te Da bar and buy a drink. We did the latter as there were 4 of us. A beer was about 18 Sing dollars (£9) and a coke was 8 Sing dollars (£4). An apple juice was 9 dollars. Expensive yes, but over all we oaid about $30 which was about £4 per person for 4 of us which seemed a more reasonable charge especially as it included a free drink! The views are similar for both, the bar is situated on a raised level a few feet above the observation deck, but you get a slightly better view of the infinity pool from the observation deck which extends a few feet further round. From the bar they have tried to obscure your view. There is an opening through from the bar to the observation deck viewpoint but when we went, it was heavily guarded and we were not allowed through without paying.. You can however, still glimpse the infinity pool in the distance if you go to the corner to the left of this area and peer between the plantpots! it was good enough for us to say we had ""seen it"" and have to say it looked extremely unpleasant and crowded in there! When you get to the lobby, go to tower 3 and at the base tell them you would like to visit the bar. As other reviewers have said, she will give you a ticket and allow you up in the lift. At the top. A guy takes your ticket and directs you to the bar area."
,,Pay and Pay for your stay,1.0,,"I had just stayed in a Premium Room with City View at Marina Bay Sand hotel from 15 to 16 Jul 14. The reason for my stay there was to celebrate a birthday. But after checking out from the hotel, I think that for all the hype about Marina Bay Sand Hotel, it is probably overdone. The room I had booked cost me about S$728. I was expecting a world class service hotel during my stay but certainly, I left the hotel feeling that it probably not worth paying so much for it.

First of all, I had drove to the hotel and intend to park my car at the hotel during my stay. With the price that I am paying and the expectation of the hotel, I would think that the parking (including valet) would be complimentary. I had travel extensively and most hotel would provide complimentary parking and it would not have cost such a high price to book a room. However, Marina Bay Sand Hotel DOES NOT PROVIDES complimentary parking to their guest. On top of that, they charged a S$12 surcharge valet parking with multiple entry/exit for 24hrs periods.

Secondly, I had brought a cake to celebrate the occasion. The hotel was kind enough to allows me to put the cake first in the hotel's chiller/refrigerator when I check in and then bring it to my room for the celebration. This is due to that the hotel's room has those automated fridge where whenever an item is removed from the fridge, it will automatically be charged to the room. So we are not able to store our cake in the room. However, we could not finished the cake that night. As such, we requests to the hotel to allow us to put the cake in the hotel's fridge again so that the cake would not be spoils and permits us to bring back home upon our check out tomorrow.

The hotel kindly turn us down as they said that due to hygiene reasons, they are unable to accede to our request. However, they would provided us with a mini fridge at our room to let us store the cake. BUT THIS COMES WITH A S$10 surcharge. Imagine to my surprise that despite staying at a premium room and paying a high price for it, I am still required to pay an additional charge for such a simple service.

For these 2 reasons above, I think that the hotel had not live up to its name for providing world class services. It left me with a very bad impression that all the hotel care for is ONLY about money and charges. It is not concerns about the comfort of the stay of its guest despite paying such an exorbitant amount for the room. (Yes, if the guest is willing to pay more?)

In short, I do not think that I would not be returning to stay at the hotel any time soon and certainly would not recommend my friends to stay at such a place unless they are willing to keep paying."
,,breathtaking view,5.0,,"unique building; one of a kind. worth paying S$20 to reach the top...expensive though but of course, it is to be expected...would want to come back if given the chance..."
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views over Singapore from the 56th floor observation deck. They also have information maps and diagrams to point out what you are looking at.
,,what a view,5.0,,"Well worth going up to , a terrific view over the city , bay and the super trees. Gives you a good idea of how busy the port of Singapoe is, looking out at all the ships in the bay."
,,Spectacular Panorama view in the world,5.0,,"Spend SGD23 to go the skypark is worth to see the spectacular panorama view in Singapore. Choose the time to visit close to sunset at 6:00pm, it is wonderful to take the beautiful pictures of golden sky and best shot of the city without doubt."
,,Sky park is really a high on top.,4.0,,"Entrance is sgd 27 and was a bit pricey for me. The view however made it so much worth it. Lift ride from ground floor to the 56th is but a few seconds only. You can have your picture taken before entering the lift and claim the same at 56th for a fee. Again a bit pricey for Sgd50. It is optional though and you may or may not get the picture. They can hard sell though.
As for the paid viewing, it was awesome! We came in late afternoon and sat by the deck and watched the lights below come to life as night fell. It is a spectacular view of Singapore and the Bay Area. You can't miss the Flyer of course, the super trees, the domes and look hard and you can see the Merllion.

Spectacular view and awesome pictures, yes worth it."
,,Worth a trip up to the top!,5.0,,What a great view from the top! You can see all of Singapore & even Malaysia from a distance. Marina Bay Sands is such a unique hotel & there's a casino inside too!
,,Great view and fastest photo service.,5.0,,Photo taken in groud floor and during elevator trip to Skydeck aprox. 20 seconds and sales clerk showed your picture in frame. Normally we don't buy these expensive souvenirs. But the speed make me open my Visa this time. Even photo sended to my mail and in few seconds in Facebook. I like speed and action. View from skydeck is really good and wish we had room in this hotel. Swimming in infinity pool 200 meters above sea level could be nice.
,,Thoroughly enjoyable with a scenic view,5.0,,"I really liked the skypark! Although it cost 23 SGD to go up, it was well worth the price as you had an almost 360 degree view of Singapore, especially Marina Bay which was beautiful. Souvenirs are not too expensive, bought a magnet which cost 4 SGD, that was okay. For iphone users, panorama comes in handy so use it! Either morning or evening is good; went before lunch. Although you can't access the infinity pool, you can just see it if you climb the stairs to the bar. Service was good, lift ascended 56 floors exceeding fast! Take loads and pictures; better than Singapore flyer as you can stay up there indefinitely.

Overall, would definitely go back for the scenery, I highly recommend this for everyone (unless you stay in the Marina Bay Sands hotel in which case you don't need to go, really)."
,,Best way to see the whole of Singapore if you are short of time,3.0,,"Amazing view of Singapore, especially Marina Bay. Go an hour before Sunset and watch the spectacular view of the star going down in the straits of Singapore."

,,Overrated expensive views,3.0,,"In my personal opinion, paying SGD23 to go up to the deck for a few pictures is kind of not worth the money.

Before you enter the lift, there's photographers offered to snap your pictures. When you reached the top floor, our photo was already photoshopped and developed. It's sold together with a leather casing cost SGD50. I didn't buy it as the photo wasn't good and the photoshop picture looked fake. :(

When you enter the deck, you can see the lights of super trees from garden by the bay and other buildings from far. You can enjoy the cooling air and snap some pictures.

I believe I won't go up for the second time. Haha! It's just overrated...."
,,Good place,4.0,,You need to book a room here for swimming at the infinity pool. Only hotel guests are allowed. For tourist can just go to Kudeta restaurants to see the scenery from above. Don't waste the money to pay to go up.
,,Surreal Experience,5.0,,"The whole experience is surreal when you see the rooftop pool. The restaurant is outstanding - expensive but worth it, and truly a dining experience you wont forget. I am not sure I would like to stay in the hotel, as it is very busy with tourists, but for a visit it is fab."
,,Excellent view,4.0,,I got to the top one Sunday evening after dark. Beautiful view of Singapore - the lights are stunning in almost every direction. I now wish I had gone at dusk as I would have also liked to pick out details during the daylight. Watching the transition from day to night would also have been spectacular...
,,AMAZING VIEW,5.0,,"The structure is very impressive from outside but when you are on the top of it, you seem to enjoy a unique privilege. The view in there is simply unique. A useful tip can be to go there not in the weekend (the place can be crowded), of course if this is possible, and maybe if you are lucky no any fee will be required."
,,great experience!,5.0,,"unbelievable view! worth every penny!! roo bad it wasn't a sunny day, but even like that we've loved it. it was a little bit strange cos of the slight movement of the building ;)"
,,View,5.0,,"Great view from the top of the hotel. Definitely worth a visit. Hotel guests can enjoy the pool at the top which was also amazing. If you are in Singapore then do not miss this. Also there is a casino in the other building of hotel , which again is good and worth a visit. Make sure to take your passport if you would like to enter the casino."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,It was fantastic swimming at level 57 and looking out at the skyline. The pool did become quite crowded during the day so we chose early morning and later in the evening. Forget trying to get into a hot tub -they were crowded all of the time.
,,A must-see view,5.0,,"Take the trip to the top of the Marina Bay Sands complex to see the most amazing view over Singapore. We just did the elevator trip not the full pay experience but were just as happy to have an awesome birds-eye view. A must-do experience in Singapore. With the limited trip there is nothing apart from souvenirs to buy - no food, drinks, no bathrooms and no place to sit! Difficult for someone with a mobility issue."
,,awesome!,5.0,,This unique building is an architectural feat. We loved the views and the experience. Our photo with our grandson will be treasured always
,,Nice view of Singapore from Skypark.,3.0,,You can get a great view of Singapore from the sky park. Admission fee is pricy. You can see a view of parks by the bay from there. .but overall Not very impressed .
,,Better at dusk.,5.0,,"Go in the late afternoon so you'll have the chance to see S'pore skyline at daylight and at night. Great photos of the S'pore Flyer, of the Gardens by the Bay, CBD and Marina Bay."
,,Here is where you can Singapore end to end!,5.0,,You get good scenic and birds eye view of Singapore. Don't forget to bring your best camera when going up.
,,High in the sky,4.0,,This attraction is pricey but can be part of the extra benefits obtained by using the City Sightseer Hop On Hop Off bus system. Visitors are limited to one end of the 'skateboard' but the views are amazing. It is a great way to orient oneself in Singapore.
,,Should see,4.0,,"I watched this amazing building being built a couple of years prior so being back when it was finished it was a must visit, you only get to be at one end of the building so don't get to see the amazing pool. There is a small bar on the top with snacks but expensive. Views are great and you can take some amazing photo's. Worth doing once."
,,Best View in Singapore,4.0,,"You may have seen the three-story building with what looks like a giant boat joining all three along the top floor. Yes, it's $20 to get to the top, but it's worth it for a drink and look at the Marina and the Singapore Skyline."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,I didn't go here for a gamble but to see this amazing structure that i used notice in Singapore attractions.
,,Great View,5.0,,Awesome view and photo heaven just pricey worth doing at least once $23 a beer at the bar or $23 to walk around the skydeck we opted for the beer.
,,One of the coolest viewpoints we have ever been!,5.0,,"There is a viewpoint for fee, where you can take amazing pics from Singapore's skyline, but if you want to see the infinity pool too, go to the bar for free (not restaurant) and have an expensive drink, but it really worth it. Beata&Gabor,Hungary"
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"We chose to do the observation deck over the merlion, tiger tower and the singapore flyer. It only cost us $20 each. we probably spent about 20 minutes up there MAX but it was very cool wont need to do it again."
,,Nice view,3.0,,Its a been there done that experience. It was nice to go have a look. Just be mindful of the weather. Its quite over priced for what it is. And not a lot of seating.
,,Great Views,4.0,,"The views from the deck are amazing. Try reaching at 5:00 pm to see the sunset in all its glory.

You can skip the Singapore flyer in you visit this.

Don’t expect to see the infinity swimming pool as that’s only for hotel guest.

There is a small café at the top, nothing great but serves hot / cold beverages. There is no place to sit on the deck, so if you travelling with little ones at the end of the day, beware."
,,Not as special as you might hope,3.0,,"Yes the views are good from the top, but somehow it all seems a bit over-the-top. Personally I prefer the view from the top of 1 Raffles Place. MBS is worth a look for pure voyeuristic appeal: at times this place can be like the bar in the original Star Wars movie, although there aren't too many people with 2 heads walking around."
,,Modern facilities like that attract people and are a funny addition to your trip,4.0,,"Modern facilities, like ""Sands"" and ""Marina"" attract people form all countries and walks of life. It is an interesting Addition for an seasoned traveller, after serious nature locations with deep experiences... a funny stage to watch and walk. and admire modern architecture."
,,"""Better go for Singapore Flyer""",2.0,,"Above here, you will see the partial city of Singapore downtown. There is nothing to see here and you can't explore the entire Skypark. You could only just be on one side of the hotel. I wasted my 23 SGD here and won't do visit again anymore. Not worth at all for being here. Take Singapore Flyer and you will see more views than here or better check-in this hotel to get all access of the Skypark for free."
,,Amazing Place-Most see on Bike-cars,5.0,,"I went four times to Marina Bay Sands, you have to see it during the day and at night for the lights that come from the hotel, it starts at 8pm and you can enjoy it from any little cafe or restaurant.
The second time I went there was to have some party with my husband and we took a Bike-cars that were just great, this lovely guy took had music on it and the way we saw the city was amazing."
,,Tourist Trap! Expensivley non-exclusive,1.0,,"If you want to pay a TON of money to stay in a packed hotel, this is the place for you. The pool, yes, it is absolutely stunning, BUT the view is hard to enjoy when there are 100s of people in it. My boyfriend and I walked around for about 40 minutes trying to find a poolside chair to no avail. We finally gave up and just jumped into the packed pool. We tried to enjoy it as best as possible but the mass quantity of people/the massive amount of photo shoots going on inside of the pool made it hard. I got out of the pool and stepped on a nail that was sticking out of the ground (a light was broken and they just put duct tape on it, five star hotel standards?). Oh, I also forgot to mention that when we came up to the pool and gave our hotel key they said we needed one key per adult and made us go back down to our room to get our other key. They forgot to do turn down service in our room, when checking in we waited about 20-30minutes, checking out was about 45minutes, and the whole hotel is just packed with people. All around awful....my least favorite hotel in Asia!

If you want to see the view just go there for dinner, DO NOT STAY HERE!"
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,23 sgd just for using the elevator to the 56th floor is too much. If you cannot go to the gardens and pool there is no point. Even at the bar there is not even a stool to sit. I bet you can see this view from somewhere else for free.
,,Nothing much,2.0,,"Not much to see. Great view sure, but what's the point if we can't explore the entire Skypark. The fact that I got to pay just to enter a pathetic tiny portion of SkyPark is laughable and I'm better off going to 1 Altitude for better view and variety of options to actually do something fun while enjoying the great view"
,,Singapore,5.0,,It is worth going to the top. The views are well worth seeing. It is a chance to see the swimming pool at the top.
,,the highest amazing infinity pool in the world,5.0,,if you like nice views. dont forget to get there by sunset and be amazed by the great infinity pool that you can observe right at the bar for the purchase of a drink. theres also a nice restaurant with 360· views
,,Amazing view go to the bar for free!,4.0,,We wanted to go up the top & found out we could go to the bar part for free if you purchased a drink. For 2 cocktails it was just over $50 with their taxes/service charges. The view is really good. We went up at around 4pm on a Friday afternoon & it wasnt very crowded we got a lounge chair. The bar has a really good view of the pool area. Its worth the trip up to check it out!
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"There are two ways of going to Skypark. Pay $23 per person and go to the observation deck and see an amazing view or go to the Ku De Ta Bar or Lounge Bar and have a drink and/or lunch dinner. Went to the Bar and had a drink and wished we had gone for lunch. This is not an extremely expensive exercise but it is pricey, but what would you expect when you are on top of Singapore!! Worth every sent. the Lounge Bar have a great brunch on Sunday as well. Absolutely worthwhile, whichever choice you make!!!"
,,Singaporean Oppulance,4.0,,Yet again Singapore has pushed the boundaries of both construction and presentation. The building itself with cantilever deck is an engineering marvel. Beautiful views and the infinity pool is just about as luxurious as you get in a urban metropolis.
,,Fantastic facility,5.0,,The artificial trees are great and the view from the walkway is spectacular. The free parts of the park are worth a visit on their own.
,,disappointing,2.0,,"the hotel seems quite nice, but for $23 all you get to do is to go to the observation deck; there isnt even a chair for you to sit down and have a drink. the view itself is nice, but not worth the money"
,,Fantastic Singapore skyline,5.0,,"Truth be told, this is the most amazing sight we had ever, not only the views but from where we were. Only hotel guests can have complimentary access to both the Infinity Pool and the Observation Deck. The Deck is open to the public but not the Pool. The Deck could accommodate a thousand guests but we saw no more than 10 when we went up there. Find the best spot for photo capture, it offers 360 degree view of the skyline."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"As others have written, the views are fantastic. You can look out in every direction and it is fascinating to see the bay beside the busy port beside the city. We had just visited the Gardens by the Bay which are next door so it was interesting to see this from 56 floors up (extremely quick ride). Fortunately we had clear weather on our visit. We were there on a Saturday and it was pretty busy but waits were at a minimum. The hotel lobbies were quite crowded.
It is a bit expensive and there is not a lot to do once you have walked around each side. It can also get quite hot and many visitors were sitting in the shade on the non sunny side.
The view is definitely worth a visit."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"Nice view, but as other reviewers said, it is way too expensive. Suggest to visit before sunset so you can see both day & night view of Singapore, the sunset was beautiful, stunning and impressive!"
,,Sky High,4.0,,"First and foremost, it was beautiful. If I'm not mistaken that was on the 52nd or 56th floor. From the top we saw the Garden, city and harbor view. From afar, the Skypark is a boat shape which is really cool.

The downside, it was expensive! Just to get in the elevator cost $23 and they will take a picture of you which you can claim at the top for $50. If you want to dine in the resto on top, you have to put a reservation. If you're not that hungry, they have some refreshments available for all.

It was worth it! But I will never do it again..."
,,Awesome,5.0,,You need to have a good clear day but the view from the 56th floor is amazing. It's very safe and good for photographers. You can see everything for miles around. Well worth the expenses of going up it's not something that you can do or see everyday ( unless you live in Singapore of course) just be sure that the weather is good otherwise it will be disappointing if too misty. Not done the night trip but guess that is pretty good too.
,,Save your money.,1.0,,More BAD reviews than any other place I remember. Rude Unhelpful Staff; Nothing that can't be experienced elsewhere for less $$$ Poor standard of accommodation exorbitantly overpriced. Set fire to a $20 note and enjoy the warmth !!!
,,Must do for everyone,4.0,,"This is a must do, although take your own water as it is expensive to buy food and drink. Also take a hat as there is very little shade. The views are amazing and well worth the visit."
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Not for the feint hearted, if you are afraid of heights, then don't try, the walkway can get quite narrow and with a lot of people on the walkway can get a bit wobbly, and your head can get a bit dizzy.
But if like me it doesn't bother you then the views are very good you can see the harbour, Sentosa, the Flyer and of course marina bay sands.
$ 5 for a fifteen minute walk and some really good photo shots, wouldn't try if the weather not good either."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"First time to the Skylpark, but once you get there this is worth it. Outstanding views, and has to be a must."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"So clean and safe. Singapore is an awesome city, but that area is specially nice. The best for shopping, wonderful landscapes..."
,,Speachless!!!!,5.0,,Could stay without food for days just to live once again this expirience!! Will never forget the view from our balcony straight to the gardens.... and swimming again on the top of the world!!!! Must do for everyone!
,,Marina Bay observation - a much better way (and cheaper),5.0,,"Want to go to the observation deck of Marina Bay Sands and see the unsurpassed view of Singapore?
Want to go free?
The view from the top is unrivaled especially at dusk but it costs Sing $23 per adult.
If you go to the lift and say you are going to the pub/restaurant you go one floor higher for free. There is an expectation that you will buy a drink but hey its always hot in Singapore and why not!
You don't have to and while the viewing area is smaller than the paid area, its pretty still good."
,,Great views,4.0,,"A not to be missed opportunity to get the fabulous views but, and they will point this out when you purchase your ticket, it is only for the viewing deck at the very front of the Skypark. The ticket charge is quite high but as pensioners we benefited from the Senior rate. Regardless we would have paid anyway just for the experience. Wherever you go in Singapore you see the Skypark so why not go to the top."
,,Better than the Flyer,3.0,,going to the rooftop once can be enough for the sake of experience. the hotel is grand and nice but i was quite disappointed with the restrooms in the mall having those low lying bowls. what are they doing in such a wonderful luxurious landmark. overall it is a place you must not miss to check out in singapore
,,Capture skyline of Singapore in a breath,5.0,,Breathtaking view of southern and central Singapore. A nice place to have drinks. Pool area is very crowded with guests. Nice pool but it is so crowded you may not want to step into it.
,,Impressive views,5.0,,"I have been here at least a dozen times and still enjoy each visit. The views -almost- all around are unparalleled. Being able to catch a glimpse of the spectacular infinity pool and taking a picture of it is great too. And there are various F&B options. If you want to enjoy any of those, be sure not to come in shorts and flip-flops, since you may get denied access."
,,Stunning View,5.0,,"WE can say it as a pride of Singapore today. Gives a stunning view of who;e Singapore. Its a little expensive. My personal opinion don't waste money over here , in verge of this try Singapore flyer as it gives the same view in a little less money also you get a cance to see Indonesia too."
,,Not worth a money,3.0,,"The property is good piece of architect from outside. But the rooms are very expensive compare to the siz of rooms. We there fore decided to go to 57th floor by buying ticket to enjoy the view.

But beleive me it is just a waste of money. They just allow u to one side of the top level. You cannot even go near to swiming pool area which is said to be the main attraction of the property.

The lobby is so much crowded dont have the feel of a seven star property.

I once again recommend that dont waste the money for going up for view.

And also my opinion for staying there just to enjoy the swiming pool is too expensive. Hotel management should come out for some reasonable packages."
,,great view!,4.0,,"There is an excellent view of the Singapore skyline up here. Very happening and wonderful atmosphere. The only setback is the steep price, going up there. But, in my opinion, it is a worthwhile experience."
,,Great view but little expensive,4.0,,"You have one of the best views of Singapore from up here. But it's truth what most other reviewer are saying, it's a little expensive for just a observation deck without any other services. Yes you can buy a souvenir and a drink but no place to sit and drink ik enjoying the magnificent view. Still i would recommend a visit! Please note that only hotel residents are allowed to use the pool and other facilities that are up there!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Views, Views, and more Views you can see for miles and miles. Wonderful atmosphere enjoyed several cool drinks and relaxed and enjoyed the amaxing views of Singapore."
,,Not so good,3.0,,"I though MBS was really a jaw-dropping attraction as what I have read here but seriously I did not find anything good about it. Aside from the 3 towers which are similar to each other that I have seen in other places too, the only difference is there is an infinity pool. Purchased my Skypark ticket and realized that I just wasted money 'cause it just an overlook to the city. Nothing much there. Nothing new. Wasn't surprised when I came at the 57th flr."
,,PANORAMIC VIEW OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,"For S$20 Singapore is offered at your feet! Wonderful panoramic view of Singapore skyline and seaview. You can walk leisurely at your leisure pace taking in the breathless view and of course a photoshoot to remember that beautiful moment. Towards sunset and twilight are the best moment and if you are hungry you are spoilt for choice ... various restaurants like Ku De Tat, Sky57 can b one of your picks."
,,park in the sky,4.0,,"entertaining,, indoor, colorful, nice, different, walk, highup, should be free, but this is singapore"
,,This place is a joke!,2.0,,Initally my boyfriend planned a surprise (before us moving out of Singapore) by taking me to Skypark. We arrived at 11am and could literally leave in 5 minutes. It doesn't worth the money at all! No one can actually stay too long because it was just too hot and without shelter. The view was ok but wasn't breathtaking. They should seriously lower the price of the tickets. We would never do this second time for sure.
,,AWESOME!,5.0,,Infinity pool is the best. The 5-7 happy hour on the 57 is also top notch....unparalleled service....partied like a rock star!
,,Spectacular view of Singapore's Business District,4.0,,"Crowd is a bummer due to it's overwhelming popularity among tourists. The best time to be at the skypark is in the early evening so as to catch the sunset and watch the city coming to life under the dazzling lights of the skyscrapers in the central business district..

Inhouse photographers are around to snap your pictures amidst the beautiful sunset...a must see for all visitors to Singapore for sure.."
,,Always a great place to bring visitors,4.0,,There are always lots of oohs and Aahs when I bring guests here. Generally also go for a drink at ku deta as well.
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,"Nice place to chill out, have a drink with stunning view especially at night. However, it's too high up if you are thinking of watching fire works here, only get to see some sparkles covered with smokes."
,,An Aerial view of Singapore Bay Front,4.0,,There is no tourist helicopter ride available to see Singapore from the air. A good alternative and affordable way is to visit the Skypark to get a bird-eye view of the central business district. Best time is around 6.30pm in the evening. It's not so hot and balmy enough to watch the sunset (with beer or cocktail in one hand). Do stay till 8pm to see the night lights.
,,Tantalizing view from the sky park!,5.0,,"You have to see it for yourself, as you swim towards the edge of the pool at the sky park; the view is simply captivating looking across the skyline of Singapore."
,,Good view,4.0,,"MBS sky park is definitely an attraction for tourists but would suggest choose only one between MBS,Singapore flyer or one altitude bar otherwise going to sky park will not be worth the money.

You will be spending $23for the deck only as visitor to sky park are not allowed to the infinity pool.You can just get a view from the deck .
Do note no chairs on the deck and always check with the hotel before going as it is closed on a cloudy day when thunderstorm is expected.

There are few restaurant up near the sky park but not very cheap."
,,too crowded,3.0,,"We went back for a visit to Singapore after having lived there for two and a half years and watching Marina Bay Sands being built. We went to have a drink after failing to book a table for dinner in Ku De Ta. They could only offer us an outside table (to be fair to them, it was a spur of the moment thought so we weren't surprised) so guessing that it would be very windy we decided to go just for a drink. The service was decidedly amateur and they had far too few waiters for the number of people scrambling at the bar for drinks. It was, as we thought extremely windy and after a drink and a chat with two ""newbies"" to Singapore and the exchange of details for my hairdresser there we decided to leave. It was overly crowded and not a terribly pleasant experience.. The view though was spectacular and all the more poignant as we could see the apartment where we had lived for two and half years very clearly."
,,The marvel of the modern Singapore,4.0,,This place is located at the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. First you have to buy tickets which is quite reasonable (only$23 per adult). After that you reach this place through a superfast lift.This place offers a scenic view of the commercial hub of Singapore. Then there is also the Infinity pool here. Although you cannot use this pool unless you are a guest of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. However you can have a drink and eat something here. You can also have a look of the pool. You just cannot afford to miss it .
,,Skip the day. Visit at night!,4.0,,"The Skypark offers unparalleled views of the Marina Bay skyline. It is the current pride of Singapore and deserves to be. The location and view that is. The pool is crowded in the day and best usage hours are early morning or after dinner hours. In summary, bring your camera down after dinner for one of the most iconic photo shoot in Singapore."
,,Excellent view of Singapore...must visit,4.0,,Excellent view of Singapore...must visit. Chose evening time so you can get pics of day and night views. Be cautious of rush during weekends and especially public holidays
,,Awesome view not to be missed,5.0,,It's worth getting high up there for a panaromic view of the city. In The day you can see more whilst the night skyline with the beautiful lights are also something not to be missed. My suggestion is go around evening and stay till night creeps in.
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,Day view is nice but night view is fantastic! Worth paying to view. Great place to go for visitors and locals too!
,,Best View of Singapore,5.0,,Your Singapore trip is not complete without visiting Marina Bay Sand Skypark. It has the most breathtaking view of Singapore. And the houses the most beautiful infinity pool in the world! It's magical up there!
,,Great view,4.0,,Great view on the Singapore City landscape. No chairs to sit and no access to the infinity pool (hotel guests only). S$ 23 per person
,,Great Views,4.0,,"The ground floor entrance to the Sky park can be difficult to find but the walk through the main hotel is worth it.
The views from the 56th floor are amazing and provide an amazing view of Singapore. You can spend as long as you like on the sky deck but sunset is the best time. Even on a cloudy day the views are good.
Cost $25SGD?
Would recommend this over the Singapore Eye Wheel"
,,Great views but they make you feel pretty unwelcome,3.0,,"There is a SIN$25 charge to get up, and there's no doubt there are spectacular views. But there is not a single place to sit down. It is clear they want you to go up, snap a few shots, and then get out again. Of course people did sit there... on the ground.

There are multiple signs saying that you may not go here or there, and I recognize the Marina Bay Sands is first and foremost a hotel.

It is worth going up because of the views, and you certainly look a long way down on the Singapore Flyer. For the price, you might want to pay for an expensive drink at another high bar, and see if for free."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,What an amazing view of Singapore you can see everything and if it's a clear day you can see Malaysia and Indonesia. You can enjoy a cool refreshing drink on the top and watch the view. They take a picture of you down the bottom at the lift and then when you get up to the top the cost of the picture is $50 and they are really pushy for you to buy it and then when you exit they are still pushy but this time the price is lowed to $30 this is the only downside to the whole experience. Plenty of open space to walk around and see the views and soak in the ambience. One of the female security guards was so lovely and took the time to answer some questions I had. If it rains and you already payed you do not get a refund.
,,Just OK,3.0,,I would not have called this a skypark as there is nothing up there except a view and the price is a bit steep. The view is nice and you can just see the pool area around the corner. There is no bar at the top. You can get similar views for free from surrounding bars in buildings.
,,Great views,4.0,,"Great views from this amazing vantage point above the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. But once the views have been admired there's not much else to do. The Marina Bay Sands is an engineering triumph and the views are incredible, but after that - there's not much else."
,,Great views but no access...,3.0,,"We were really disappointed to find out that since we were not a hotel guest, we could not get into the rooftop restaurant. We were gonna have another splurge night watching the sunset with drinks and then dinner, but no we just stood up in the main section (no seating except the floor). No chairs and a small canteen we did not even browse at. We stayed to look around for two hours, but we had to spend our money elsewhere at another dim sum place for dinner and drinks. A miss of over another $100 spend for a couple of people besides the elevator fee. I think they need to capitalize a bit more and add more restaurant space. Someone needs to do a cost analysis! We thought about staying here in t future but we do see the reviews about the rooftop pool gimmick and long lines for check out....which we witnessed."
,,wow is lovely long way up though,5.0,,Bit scarey going up there im a little scared of heights but I honestly got some beautiful photos of Singapore and lots of views of the ocean and the ships all waiting to get emptied .
,,Amazing views,3.0,,"Whether you love it or hate it, it's undeniable that the views from here are jaw-droppingly awesome.

Swimming up to and lounging at the edge of the pool was my favourite thing to do for my stay at the Marina Bay Sands. I really don't think there is a better vantage point for a breathtaking bird's eye view over Singapore.

And while, I'm not convinced paying SGD23 just to visit the Skypark is worth the view, perhaps grabbing drinks at Ku De Ta with good company definitely is.

I definitely don't recommend it for people who have issues with heights."
,,Higher than Singapore flyer..,5.0,,"We took the half day tour including the tour to the skypark...spellbinding view...nice planning,photos at the entrance can be avoided or the photo company should use better technology...overall very good.."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,I would recommend coming here for the set lunch. This is the cheaper option than dinner and you can still see the lovely view. You will need to book though. remember that in Singapore the day after a heavy rain the sky is usually very clear and bright for great photos!
,,Great view over Marina Bay,4.0,,"During our visit the weather was not very nice, but I can imagine that with better weather it would be perfect. I was a bit disappointed that the area, where you can get, is quite small and you cannot get closer to the infinity pool. As for all such attractions with view I recommend visiting it in the later afternoon and stay up there during sunset."
,,Excellent View,5.0,,Perfect view of the city and awesome place. Must visit it in night and also experience water show from 57th story.
,,Best,5.0,,Standing atop this iconic structure with sweeping views of Singapore is an experience in itself. The infinity pool is the caking on the cake.
,,Great views,4.0,,"The view from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is quite spectacular, but I would suggest picking a clear day or night to get the most out of the SD$23 cost to get to the Skypark by high speed elevator. As my photos show I had perfect conditions with not even the usual hazy sky to blur the view.

The accessible area for the public ( not hotel guests ) is a very small part of the Skypark, just the tip of one end, so there is a lot of the Skypark which cannot be visited.

I would not regard this attraction as a ""must do"" in Singapore, but it is worth a look if you are in the area and the weather is clear."
,,Try the Tower 3 elevator,5.0,,"Instead of buying a $23 ticket to go up the middle tower elevator to the public viewing deck, we went to the Tower 3 elevator bank, checked in at the Ku De Ta Lounge counter (it was after 11 am, and luckily, we were not dressed too casually) and took their “free” elevator up to the higher Ku De Ta Lounge level. We found several excellent viewing locations outside the bar area, as well as comfortable lounge furniture in the area overlooking the infinity pool. There was no pressure to buy a drink or food, though we did buy one frozen cocktail for $27, and saw soft drinks on the menu for much less. Definitely worth a try, especially for the wonderful view of the infinity pool that is not visible from the public viewing deck."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,"For the price of SD$23 this is definitely worth a visit. The views over the Marina Bay area are spectacular and you even get to glimpse the F1 circuit from on high.

There is a degree of snobbery about this hotel, especially around dress codes when trying to have a drink at the roof top bar. That aside, the attraction is brilliant and we had a brilliant time here."
,,Must visit in the evening,5.0,,"Singapore trip is incomplete without a visit to Marina Bay Sands. Excellent view of the city, sea and bay area. Its a master piece of construction and engineering.
The restaurant at skypark is worth a visit . Having couple of drinks at that level with amazing weather is a great experience."
,,Almost hits the 'excellent' rating,4.0,,"You can't go to Singapore and not be struck by the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Even if your budget doesn't stretch to anywhere near the grandeur of staying there you can still get a sense of the engineering achievement of the place just by looking at it. You'll see it from so many points of inner city - from the Singapore Flyer (though given you'll be looking at its 'bow' you won't get the best view of it from there) and from Marina Bay.

Apart from the thoroughfare aspect of the place (you can walk through parts of it at will such as the lobby and if you are transiting through it from Marina Bay to Gardens by the Bay) there is part of it open to the average 'Joe Public' and that is the Observation deck at the bow of the ship. This is not cheap. But few things in Singapore are. The observation deck itself does provide a wonderful view to both landward and seaward. There is a sense of space as it is open to the elements and would be spectacular in a tropical downpour. There are interpretive panels so you can read about what is in front of you view wise and it is best to take your time and checking out the view of the Gardens by the Bay, the Barrage and the ships beyond it, Marina Bay itself and the promenade. Photography buffs will have a field day.

There aren't really any places to sit and bide a while. Presumably they don't want to encourage you to stay too long. There is a gift shop and yes it is expensive but... well what would you expect? Look if you simply must have that fridge magnet but baulk at the cost of getting it here then pick up a cheap one down in Chinatown later on in your stay.

Totally recommended with a couple of tiny caveats."
,,Splendid view at night...,4.0,,"Ticket to the park can be bought at the Hotel Lobby. I feel the ticket cost is a bit dearer. Its $23 per adult.
The skypark stretches over all 3towers of Hotel Marina Bay Sands giving tourist and locals great view from all sides. It’s a kind of open roof observatory…. The Glass fencing at the edges should have been a little clearer for photography. Awesome view at night when the city is lit. you have the courful view of the city and also the reflection of lights in water is splendid.

If you visit its ok if not it’s still ok!"
,,Its high,4.0,,An elevator takes you to the viewing platform in a matter of seconds and this hotel is even higher than the Flyer and you are able to look down on it. If the weather is clear then you will have good views of Singapore
,,not worth going up,2.0,,"there is very limited area permitted to walk up there. you can see only view of the bay,no garden nothing else. for the view you can see it elsewhere in singapore such as singapore flyer, high floor restaurants, nearby hotels' rooms. i think it's not worth the 23 sgd you paid."
,,Lovely Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay is a must stay or at least visit to admire the fantastic architecture from outside, inside and the garden at the top with it's famous infinity pool
Across the pond is Sentosa Park....take time and bottle water...this place is loaded with all type of distractions for all ages. It's a huge open park with great waterfalls and water displays,restaurants,Casino,Games,rides,Walks,Hikes,Benches and more.
I love The Lion statue at the top....you'll see it."
,,What a view,5.0,,"It only takes seconds to arrive at the top and your photo (taken on the way in!), is ready and waiting.... The sheer speed makes it worth it!!.......And what a view! The whole of Singapore is beneath you. We enjoyed a drink from the bar as we looked down in wonder. If you are ok with heights dont miss this!!"
,,Fantastic view from the top,4.0,,"This was my second trip to singapore, tho ive been to MBS
Before to watch the Wicked at the Sands Theatre but didnt stay there. I was excited to stay there and was looking forward for the pool, and YES its worth it, the pool is really cool and the view is majestic especially at night, you can see almost everything of singapore in every angle from MBS. The room is comfy, more like for business type of room, the view from room is OK, they put us into the garden view. The dining experience and the shopping is quite ok but its more expensive there than other shops outside. The casino is just ok, they are very strict for people coming in and out, they need to check your belongings and ID."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Awesome experience, very close to the Flyer. had a great fun. can see very far from the top and could enjoy the visit totally."
,,Skypark at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel,3.0,,"My family and I were guests at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel so we had card access to the 57 floor, this makes the difference as only hotel guests can get into the larger pool area where there is more space and better views of the Singapore skyline, the non guest viewing area is small and gets very busy so either get there early or be prepared to hang around to get a good picture."
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"Located on the 57th Floor, bridging the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, this Skypark is open to the public on payment of S$24. Very express lifts take you to the observation deck which is spacious and affords breathtaking views across Singapore."
,,Good,4.0,,"Easy to access this place, however, too many people were there. Limited place to see the city view due to bunch of people."
,,Go for the awesome views,4.0,,"Located on the 57 floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the skypark truely offers breathtaking views of Singapore. The entrance price is worth the views and you can stay there as long as you want. There is an express elevator which takes you to the top in like 10 seconds. There is a cafe in the skypark. You can capture the gardens by the bay, the Singapore wheel from that high point. One good thing is to go there just before the sunset, it looks magnificent during that."
,,Magnificent View Singapore,4.0,,"Utilised Hop On Hop Off bus to travel to Marina Bay Sands. Magnificent structure, worth the entrance price to gain access to one of best views in Singapore. Express elevator to top. Towers over Singapore Flyer. Highly recommend the experience, views astonishing."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,We loved this. Not for the feint hearted as you are very high up on an extended platform. Very exciting. Walking through the shopping mall to get to it is great as well. Very luxurious beautiful building. Would have liked to see the infinity pool at the Sands.
,,Breathtaking View,4.0,,I personally am afraid of height but i always curious to places that have bird level view. This Skypark is one of the best place to see the whole Singapore beside Singapore Flyer. A good side of this Skypark is the visiting time is unlimited but lil bit pricey.
,,Get a drink at Ku De Ta instead,5.0,,"We went to the top of Tower 1 for the same view as those who went just to the platform. But, we had a jovial bunch of folks near us, having drinks, watching the sunset. For the same price! Can't bring little ones up there (which was kind of a plus for us, to be honest). Beautiful view, worth the price of the drinks."
,,Worth the visit because it's free,4.0,,I went to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. You can take photos there with the Marina Bay Sands hotel as the backdrop.
,,Great views on the waterfront,5.0,,The view from up there is just unbelievable. The Singapore Flyer is a dwarf in comparison. i highly recommend the audio guides that explain the engineering challenges that the architect and civil engineering teams had to solve for the first time in building history.
,,Not worth going....,2.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is in fact quite expensive but the view is not as good as I think. However, it is still the best high rise view in Singapore. (Not recommended if the sky is not clear!)

Only part of the deck is open for visitor. That's why I think it's not worth going..."
,,The sights from the skypark,5.0,,"The views of singapore skyline from the skypark are sizzling. Fresh air on the top and you can see the CBD, esplanade, gardens by the bay, singapore flyer, marina barrage and the views extend upto east coast park on a clear day. Plan to go late evenig when you can see the city in daylight as well as all lighted up after dark. Unfortunate that you dont have access now to visit the infinity pool unlike before"
,,Good View,5.0,,"You might want to go there if you love the High rise View. Also,,, you could see the Swimming pool on the Top of the Hotel from a distance(ofcourse), as it not allowed for visitors."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Although i didnt stay at the hotel I am glad i paid the trip to walk the skypark. its on the 56th floor but you reach there in seconds in the express elevators.The vista from the top is breathtaking. once can see the high rises well along with the flyer, garden by the bay, the merlion statue etc. It would be teriffic if you get to stay at the hotel and use the infinity pool."
,,Worth seeing (Expensive),4.0,,"Amazing gardens and wonderful views. One should not miss when you visit Singapore.But the Entry fee of $S23 is very high for just viewing, without having any comfortable place to sit. Further the charges for photo $S 50 is also very high"
,,Great views with no time to enjoy.,3.0,,"Just visited the sky deck and paid the S$24 per person price. Without a doubt, the views are amazing however because there is no shade and no where to sit you are forced to do a quick lap around the restricted non hotel guest boardwalk and then another if you're extra keen. We were advised that there was a cafe (kiosk only - the restaurant with shade and seating reserved for hotel guests only) for drinks and snacks and that our tickets allowed us to stay as long as we like which was great to hear but upon arriving we were forced by Mother Nature to retreat. My tip: take an umbrella for longer lasting comfort or stay a night to take in the full sky deck experience."
,,A must see,5.0,,"The whole Marina Bay area is a must see. The hotel and mall are quite large with an amazing restaurant and view at the top. The whole area is always energetic with outdoor art displays, amazing gardens and just wonderful views."
,,Don't miss this,5.0,,"Luckily, we read about the ""moderate"" haze in the newspaper the day after we went, but the view was still great. The view out over the magnificent new gardens, the waiting container ships, the new passenger ship terminal, the racing track, the huge ferris wheel, the river with its magnificent big skyscrapers. It was exceptionally hot and humid, but I didn't want to leave. Our photo was taken on the ground floor, and ready for us when we got out of the lift. I think $50 was on the steep side, but it was a good photo of our trio so I bought it. They also sent the photo to my email, which I have forwarded to my two friends who can download it and have it printed. Reduction for seniors."
,,Not worth the admission price,2.0,,"The $S23 they want you to pay to go to a viewing platform with one kiosk and nowhere to sit, is just not worth it! (Go to the bar instead....at least you get a drink with the view for your $23!) The view over Singapore was no better than we got from our hotel room at the Pan Pacific. (In fact, the Pan Pacific seems much better than this hotel all round.) This is an unusual and interesting structure but the so-called ""Skypark"" is just a marketing ploy. Stick a boat on top of 3 tall buildings, charge a lot for admission and make more money than you deserve for what you offer."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"Wherever we go in the world, we always seem to end up somewhere high and this is one of the most memorable views on earth. My daughter and I were enroute to Sydney, Australia. We had a 3 night stop over in Singapore. We were staying on Orchard Road and visited the Ku De Ta Cocktail Bar at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on two consecutive nights. What can I say? We didn't want the night to end. It's magical, awesome, an experienc we will treasure for ever! The Cocktails were divine and the staff, in particular, Fredrick, were both highly attentive and very professional. We were on our own in Singapore, a long way from home, but we couldn't have felt more safe and welcome. Reluctantly we had to leave, but we will return! Thank you Ku De Ta!"
,,Like being part of a Spielberg film,5.0,,"I've gotta say that despite the fact that all I did was go to the top of a building and look out over a city, I loved it. Maybe its because we started our walk in the business district at the cusp of dusk and by the time that we got to the promenade that leads to the Marina Bay Sands complex it was already dark and the millions of lights sparkled across the bay's rippling waters. Maybe it was the huge complex itself full of luxury shops and opulence that got that excitement boiling. Maybe it was the feeling that despite all the Louis Vuitton, Rolex and Mont Blanc I felt that we got a Singaporean steal in that instead of paying $22 for the viewing platform, we got the lift to the Skybar for free (mind you, the cocktails here cost $22; so just look at it this way - $22 for the viewing platform with a free drink thrown in!). The Skybar is just above the viewing platform and you can look out into the Manhatten-like skyline with stars in the distance whilst sipping your cheesecake (yes, really, cheesecake) cocktail! Loved it."
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views over Singapore at night - beautiful and you can see the very cool pool at the top - but can't use it. Just wondering about the hotel is great too. Connected to a mall with lots of bars and restaurants.
,,fantastic view of city,5.0,,"pay the 18 dollars or so for the terrace view. Better view than the bar, plus one beer will cost you the same amount of money if you just go to the bar. Excellent views of city."
,,Absolute Rip-off,1.0,,"What a whole heap of hype this place is!
""Sky Park"" is not a park unless you are a hotel guest. If you are simply visiting the ""deck"" for a little while, all you get is:
Pay $23 each for a lift ride to the roof
Harassment to buy a photoshopped picture FOR $50!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
On the roof, the only access you get is to a real ""decking"". No park no grass
No chairs or any seating for that matter
No shelter or cover from the burning sun or rain
A small kiosk where you can buy a drink to have while you walk around (no seating remember)!
There is a nice area on the upper deck, with a bar, tables, chairs and shade umbrellas......but that's for hotel guests only and they have real security guards at each entry point, even though the place was practically empty

Remember: access to the ""rooftop Park"" is reserved for hotel guests only -NOT YOU!

The views are good, but just as good at the Stanford rooftop with free access bar & lounge facilities.

Strongly suggest you give this ""sky park"" place a miss....ITS RUBBISH AND A RIP OFF!!!"
,,Overpriced and overrated,2.0,,"The Skypark could be a lot more, but is not. For the $23 (Singapore Dollars) you do not get a lot: A quick ride up, look around the observation deck and very annoying staff selling you fake leather bound photoshop photo for $50 of your visit.

Be aware there is no cover from the elements, seating or telescope on the observation deck.

If you like to be high up in Singapore with a view, better to go up the top of the Swissotel (The Stamford). You can get a seat, drink, etc."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark Observation Deck was well worth the visit.,5.0,,"Opens 9:30AM to 10:00PM. Adult single entry S$23.00. They give Senior Citizen discount for 65 years old and above for Singapore residents ONLY. Short walk, follow directions from the Bayfront MRT, NOT Marina Bay MRT.

The day we went, the weather forecast was rain from 1PM onwards. Thought it best to do the outside attractions early, so we were there at 9:30AM. We had the place pretty much all to ourselves:))) We could have done cartwheels if we could:) Took as many pictures for as long as we wanted. And looked down at The Singapore Flyer (and everything else).

I have to say, it was oppresively hot and humid before 9AM during the 5 days we vacationed in Singapore:((( From our vantage point, we saw that the Marina Bay Sands infinity pool was Packed at 10AM. Geeh....."
,,"Give it a miss, take the ferris wheel",1.0,,"My family and i did both the Marina Bay Sands Sky Park and the Singapore Flier (ferris wheel). The ferris wheel is the winner hands down. SKY PARK- horrendously expensive, $80 for two adults and two children, restricted access to top level, no cover from searing heat which limits your ability to stay on the observation deck before passing out.
SINGAPORE FLIER- air conditioned comfort, 360º views, in car comentary, plenty of time to soak up the sights of the city, comparable cost to sky park.
CONCLUSION- the upper level of the Mar"
,,Don't bother unless you stay there,2.0,,"I initially wanted to stay at MBS but the room prices seemed too high, so decided to book elsewhere and just go there for the sky deck views later. First member of staff we came across was promptly rude and acting like he didn't want to be there when we asked where the entrance is (was the guy at the desk where the exit from the sky deck lift is near the hotel entrance). Well, apologies for bothering you, mate. Won't happen again. So entrance found we coughed up something like S$25 each, then avoided the pestering ""picture sir"" people before taking the lift up. The green screen pic they take of you downstairs can be yours upstairs for a mere S$50!

The area of the sky park that visitors can access is tiny - just one end of the roof. You won't see the pool and there's virtually no cover from the burning sun. You get a reasonable view of Singapore due to the location, but to be honest you're probably better off heading to Swissotel Stamford - they have a bar and club on the 70th floor with better views. The whole Sky Park is only accessible to hotel guests and as a mere visitor you won't get 360 degree views. All you get is a small area to walk around on. That's it. So unless you stay there as hotel guest and can use the whole thing, I'd say don't bother going there."
,,Old and slow,1.0,,"We stayed in a club suite on our second night of our honeymoon and were so very disappointed with the hotel. Firstly the hotel itself is very outdated and not at all luxurious like I was expecting. I've stayed in a lot of hotels (including at an airport hotel the night before) and they've all been better than this one. The service was friendly enough but very slow and we were waiting for over half an hour to get our keys cut (we'd checked in earlier that morning) meanwhile everyone that checked in around us came and went. The 'VIP' check in area was pathetic-no extra service for what we were paying there were just big queues. The only 'consolation' for us being stuffed around was a slightly late check out which, as I was waiting for our room, heard being offered to other people around us who didn't incur issues. Given that we had an early flight that didn't really do much for us-nor did they care when I pointed that out.
The room itself is very average-the only consolation being good views.
The pool area was hideously overcrowded and due to everyone saving sun lounges we couldn't even sit down. I was told by our taxi driver that if you weren't staying at the hotel you could just pay $20 and hang out at the pool-if that is the case then that's disgusting as we paid a hell of a lot more than that to stay here and we couldn't even use it!
They have lovely big baths in the suits but some idiot putting in the tap positioned it so that you can't turn the hot water up past warm (as the wall gets in the way) so that's great if you like warm baths as opposed to normal temperature.
If you want luxury then don't go to this hotel. The pool isn't even worth it."
,,Spectacular.,4.0,,"A magnificent building. How ever, very expensive to pay a visit up to the Sky Park. Almost $100 with restricted access."
,,Only 180 degree View,4.0,,"If you really want to enjoy the view, I recommend to stay in the hotel for a night and enjoy the infinity pool along with the 360 degree view, as the sky park has a limited view of maximum of 240 degree view."
,,Good view,4.0,,"My friends and I went up there at different times. I preferred the night time as the lights were beautiful. It was very hot during the day. This is a great alternative to Singapore Flyer because it's cheaper, the view is higher, and you can walk around as far as the deck would allow you to"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,The view was amazing and there were performances too by the magician. It was a little humid but that's just singapore weather. I will go back to chill out
,,Amazing,4.0,,"had good afternoon at the Skypark with some Tiger beer. Beautiful view of ocean, harbour, city, and gardens. not so busy at all so they did't take me long to buy the tickets and take a lift. if you want to drink at the bar on the top of skypark around/after sunset, a dress code is required so if you feel like stay for a drinks with sunset, dont wear short pants."
,,Expensive,3.0,,For what you get they charge lot...... Not really worth the $... Im sure you can get the same view for free somewhere else
,,Wow!!! Awesome,4.0,,This place is awesome. There is a pool at the skypark which a few fantastic restaurants that serves mind blowing sort of food. The service there is rocking and I really hope that it remains that way.
,,"No Matter what they say, it's worth it.",5.0,,"$20 Singapore seniors, $23 regular. It's well worth it. Beautiful! We went at 6:30 and stayed until 8:30. Were able to take some nice pictures while it was still light out and then after dark it got more spectacular. We watched the light show at 8pm. They say the light show is better from down low, but hey, once you are up there stay and watch it and watch it from the ground another night. You can see many of the highlight sights from up there and then decide which ones you want to see next. If it looks like rain , bring an umbrella. They sell them there for $23. Yes, the pictures they take are expensive $50 SN, but you don't have to buy them if you don't want. Take your own selfie.
We loved it and thought it was great."
,,Good view,3.0,,"This is amazing skyscraper hotel. Views from top floor are amazing. However, too pricey. I would prefer Altitude bar for better views of Singapore"
,,Great view,5.0,,Didn't have to pay entrance fee as we stayed at the hotel. Loved the awesome view. Would recommend this.
,,Amazing view; consider drinks at bar,4.0,,"The view over the Singapore downtown skyline and across Marina Bay and out over the coastline is absolutely gorgeous, especially at sunset. Paying $18 each or so will allow you access to the outermost deck with the best, unimpeded view. Consider going to the Ku De Ta hostess stand at ground level within Marina Bay Sands Hotel lobby area. Tell the kiosk staff that you are going to the cocktail bar for drinks at the Skypark level. This bar is on one end of the restaurant. There are a few tables along the perimeter with amazing views. While the Skypark viewing deck has clearer views at the building's edge, you have great views from the bar area and you avoid having to pay the fee just to ride up the elevator. You only have access to the bar area, not the viewing deck, but it's still a good deal if you want to buy a drink (expensive) and enjoy the views."
,,Luxury with a Wow factor..,5.0,,"Just when you think what more could a hotel/casino/resort do to wow you the answer is found here at Marina Bay Sands..........check out the shopping, roof top pool, casino, museum, theatre, restaurants, gardens and spectacular views of the best of Singapore. For many people this is a once in a life time experience and while it can be a little expensive it is worth it! Drive a luxury car like a Ferrari on the streets of Singapore for 15 minutes up to one hour rental periods....you will not be disappointed by your time here. Enjoy."
,,Great Panoramic View of the City,5.0,,"We had a cocktail function for our conference ending at Sky on 57. Oh Whao!!! so beautiful views of the city, garden, Singapore flyer and the food at the restaurant was delightful.. it is pricey yes but it is worth it. Did not have the chance to swim in the pool however it would simply have been an awesome experience. a must to visit for me next time i am there and this time definitely taking a dip in the pool with such breathless views."
,,Great view,5.0,,The view from the Singapore eye used to be the best. This view surpasses all. We have been there many times. During the day be sure to take a hat.
,,Worth a visit.,4.0,,"We visited here around dusk, and found we got great views over the city. The number of ships moored in the bay was amazing. It was a bit crowded, but, worth it, if you have limited time in the city."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark - Best if you stay in Hotel,4.0,,"If you are staying in the hotel then you can enjoy it to its best. You can swim or sit at the pool just next to the corner of the skypool and enjoy amazing view in the night. - Very Good.

But if you are just paying for the Skypark view then you can other sides except skypool. Worth visiting once. - Average"
,,Brilliant Views from the top,4.0,,"Its worth getting vertigo for the views from the top, at certain angles you can get some great photo's of the park with the hotel and other famous attractions in the background. There is a restaurant at the top however you can not enter if you havent booked a table without paying another fee. Just the walk around the amazing man made steel treetops was very enjoyable enough for us.
They do close the tree top walk if it's raining, so save a visit for a fine sunny day."
,,"Just a great view, that's all",3.0,,"You go up there, you get a breathtaking view, and that's it. You can get that from many other buildings, rooftop bars/restaurants in Singapore.

You could go to Ku De Ta I guess, but it's a pretentious place for 20-somethings. Hardly exciting, been there done that.

There's the wonderful pool - the photo of which they repeatedly use to show tourists to lure them there - but they can't even use it unless they are a hotel guest (and you need to have a significant amount of moolahs to be one, trust me)."
,,Very good view of the Singapore cityscape,4.0,,"The location and height of the Skypark is perfect for viewing the cityscape.
However, if you want an even better experience you have to swim in the pool at the Skypark,
that would give you a complete experience. Though, you would need to stay at the hotel in order to swim in the pool."
,,Take you pick...,4.0,,"Getting to the top on the Marina Bay sands is well worth the effort. The views are almost unrivalled (One Altitude may be slightly better) and you get a spectacular view of the city and island. Not quite panoramic but almost. This is a far better option than the Singapore Flyer which is quite limited scenery wise. How you do the top of the Marina Bay Sands is the question. The tickets aren't exorbitant but also aren't cheap. My suggestion is to take the 'free' lift to KuDeTa, queue and company permitting, and go to the bar (no the club - you will be charged for that). The views are almost as good as from the sky park itself and you can enjoy a drink for the price you would have paid to get to the sky park alone."
,,"View is fine, but not very big area",3.0,,"For the price of the ticket, I don't think it's worth it. View is fine but in singapore there are lots of tall building so you need not spend that money unless you are there for dinner or like me got a complimentary visit."
,,Good View of Singapore - 360 degrees panaroma.,4.0,,"It is indeed quite an experience. Different from the experience at the Singapore Flyer. Gives you good vantage points for sunrises or sunsets (if you are looking for great ""i've been in Singapore!"" selfies). Spend a little more time there during the periods of the day when the light changes (early morning or late evening). Other times, do cloud watching and enjoy the blue skies."
,,Cityscape,4.0,,"The Skypark is a wonderful platform from which to view the Singapore Skyline; both a view of the financial district, Marina Bay and downtown Orchard Road, or on the other side, a view of the more recently reclaimed Gardens By The Bay and Barrage area. An alternative to the Skypark is to go up to Ku De Ta Bar at the other end of the Marina Bay Sands complex. There is no entry charge but drinks prices are very expensive. It is $20 for the Skypark and $18-28 for beer or wine in Ku De Ta. However, you do get a chance to mix with trendy expats from downtown and the views are perhaps more spectacular. The best time to go is just as the sun is setting and the skyline is lighting up with lasers, so around 6.30 p.m."
,,Great views over Singapore,4.0,,"Although expensive, and if you have a drink at the Kudeta bar it is even more painful, the view at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel is pretty amazing and should form part of any visitor's itinerary. Singapore now has an interesting array of modern skyscrapers and cultural buildings and seeing them juxtaposed against some of the older shopfront houses, and charting where the old harbour was in relation to the reclaimed land, is quite fun."
,,Singapore Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"Nice view of Singapore city, overlooking Garden by the bay. Beautiful structure sitting on top of the Marina Bay Sands Casino and Convention center. A very nice place to have a romantic meal at Sky lounge, though a little pricy at cost."
,,"Not a must, but nice if you do visit",3.0,,1.Provides a good view of the new business district. 2.Usually no ques. 3.Single Entry Ticket valid for 1 day 4.Best around dusk in time for the Laser Light Show
,,Nice view and bars,3.0,,Myself and a couple of friends decided to go out there for a drink and the view. Well awesome view. There is a long cue down in the hotel lobby to get in due to the popularity of the place. Drinks are quite expensive though but this i think its kind of the Singapore life
,,Excellent View,5.0,,Great place to visit if you are in Singapore. Entry is FREE is you are a guest in the hotel. Amazing view. Is a good place to take a deep breathe there. I enjoy a lot when I stay there for 2Days. You will really feel good.
,,57th floor wonder,5.0,,The sky park with the 360º view deck is located on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands & costs 20 dollars per visit. The pool is available only for the hotel guests so you can only see people enjoyng. It is a must to go in Singapore both day & evening time. The working hours up to 11 pm.
,,Stunning view. Pity about the crowd.,5.0,,So that's the way it is. Jaw dropping view. But packed with Koreans and Japanese. And many young ladies posing away for their pic to be taken. Eek.
,,A great view amazing sites,4.0,,"A great place to visit and something truly spectacular.
The smoke from the fires in Indonesia spoilt some of the view but overall a good place. You can also see the Gardens light up next door in the evening. Pity it was so expensive but a once in a visit chance."
,,Stunning view of downtown.,5.0,,What a view of marina bay sands. Don't miss out the boat ride and merlion park. Evening and night view of downtown is almost awe-inspiring. Do see the laser show at Marina Bay sands.
,,What an amaxing view,5.0,,We eventually found the entrance to this viewing area in Block 1. 56 floors to the top and an amazing area to walk round to see the whole of Singapore city and surrounding areas. No Charge.
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"The view is breathtaking.It is definitely worth the money to stay in the hotel. If u like watching sunset,i advise to come up here around 6pm and stay till 8 at night. Don't worry about feeling cold in the waters as the pool's waters is heated. You can see the sun sets slowly and soon the landscape of the tall buildings began to lights up. You may also relax yourselves on the seats and enjoy a drink while reading your favourite book.♥♥♥."
,,Would love to stay here,5.0,,"It was not possible to get to see their fantastic infinity pool because guests of the hotel did not like all the tourists traipsing through, and to be honest if you paid to stay in a hotel like this, you would be justified in feeling like that.
We walked through the hotel with its spectacular shops, and then went to the viewing platform, which was probably one floor below the pool, so we got the stunning views. We were there as the sun was setting which was beautiful. It meant we also got to see Singapore by night which was magnificent. I got some great pics with the help of my zoom lens. You can see the wheel of the Singapore Flyer, the river, the boats moored out beyond the harbour, the conservatories for the gardens, and also by dark, all the Supertrees were illuminated and clear to see. We only bought a coke up there, but the man who served us gave what I call ""grunted"" service and no smile. The lady who sold the t-shirts was very helpful and charming. The view from the top is not to be missed."
,,great view,4.0,,"great time spent with snacks & drinks, great ambience.. strongly reccommended not very expensive when you compare the experience"
,,lovely!,5.0,,went there sometimes with my friends. you can have drink on the top of the world. Or enjoy the nightlife in kudeta. one thing i can assure that you will want to come back once you been here.
,,What a view.........,4.0,,"After being on the Singapore Flyer I was not going to go ahead with my planned visit to the Marina Sands Skypark but for whatever reason I did change my mind and I was so glad that I did. An amazing view, even though I had been on the Flyer the photo opportunity is far much better from the Skypark. I had just missed the afternoon downpour and the deck which does look like a ship was not crowed at all, I was able to stroll round and take in the fantastic views of Singapore let alone take so many pictures along with some video clips.Once you are are on the Skydeck you can walk up a few more steps and one will get a reasonable good view of the swimming pool.
I would definitely suggest the visit to the top."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,Views are something else. Have a drink and a bite to eat on top of the world. Worth the cost of a trip up if not staying there. Enjoyed it immensely.
,,"Went for a drink, cramped and overpriced.",3.0,,"Seemed like it had to done and yes the view is great and the pool looked amazing. But...it had rained and we were rather cramped into a spot just under shelter. The bar was jam packed, the music was too loud for conversation and the service was slow.
Would I go again? Yes probably! It's just kinda cool to be up so high on a ship in the sky!"
,,Best vantage point to see Singapore,4.0,,"This is the best place to go to see the sights of Singapore and then spend time to check out the high end shops afterwards. The daytime, dusk and nighttime sights of the city are a must see. Best time to arrive is 20 minutes before sunset and staying until it is dark to see the lights. The infinity pool that the hotel is famous for is no longer accessible if only visiting the skypark - too bad."
,,68 floor,4.0,,it looked like a ship atop the building. on reaching on the top nice scenic beauty was every where and the sea beneath.
,,S$23/USD$18 and it is worth it,5.0,,"This is a much better option compare to The Singapore Flyer. You could take your time to have a 360 degree walk around the deck, snap fantastic panraramic photos or relax with a drink to enjoy the breathtaking views at the peak of Singapore. After that you could shop in the Marina Bay shopping mall, dine in one of the fine restaurants or food court. Highly recommended if this is your first visit to Singapore."
,,Spectacular..!!,5.0,,"Super view from the top.. You can buy the ticket and visit the top of the hotel however if you match your time of visit with their official tour times, you can get closer look at the infinity pool.
To enter into the pool you need to be a guest at the hotel.. else the best chance to get anywhere close to the pool is the official tour - the timing for which are available on their website"
,,Great View but tickets are a little overpriced,4.0,,"Even though we travelled as a family of 5, we chose to leave our kids in the cruise ship kids club for this particular outing as it would have been a hefty $100 for the 5 of us to literally ride up in an elevator and look at a view. Even so, for the two of us $46 was still a little over priced in my mind. Yes it is a sensational view of the city, but you only get to walk around the very front of the Marina Bay Sands as the remaining areas are for guests only."
,,Overrated site,3.0,,"I remember visiting Singapore with my family to especially enjoy Marina Bay Sands. Once we arrived and we saw the charge to enjoy the skydeck area I was a little disappointed. So I came up with the idea of enjoying lychee Martini at the Sky Bar. And it was definitely worth it. It made more sense to sit and enjoy a drink whilst enjoying the view, as opposed to walking around on the deck. I have seen a lot of views, so this is isn't the best view but for Singapore it is vibrant."
,,Great views,4.0,,Entry is free if you are a guest at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Don't know the charge otherwise. Nice to look down on everything but you could see as much without going up if you have to pay.
,,Excellent view of the bay,5.0,,"It's a must see, even if obviously full of tourists. Spend some good time just looking and taking it all in. Definitely a unique place with a wonderful view."
,,Wow,5.0,,"From the bottom it looks doubting but once you travel the 67 floors in 22 seconds the views are worth it
You feel very safe and the light show at 8 pm is worth seeing
A must do
Ps group picture when you go in very expensive"
,,Worth it,4.0,,"Great views from the top, better than I had expected. I was expecting hundreds of people squeezing past each other (like the Empire State Building) but it wasn't so busy as it had been raining just before, although it did get much busier at sunset. We went up when it was light and waited around 45mins until sunset. By the way, only the front part is accessible to tourists. The rest of it is only for hotel guests."
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Amazing, can't wait to return! Staff were so welcoming and friendly, couldn't be more helpful. Views unrivalled."
,,The coolest pool in the world!,4.0,,"It's gorgeous! You see the photos on line and you wonder whether in reality it will live up to those photos

It does! It's outstanding, just awesome. There are probably 300 lounge chairs, most of them seem permanently busy, it's a very popular place. The view is fantastic and I thought it was extra special that I was able to look out and not be behind safety bars like you are in most other spectacular locations.
It's super busy on weekends, but much more comfortable for hotel guests Mon-Friday. I am so glad to have had this experience."
,,Don't Waste Your Money on This,1.0,,"Very expensive to ride a lift up and stand in the blazing sun on one end of the building - nowhere to sit, no shelter, a bit of a kiosk. Pay more if you want to go (and pay more) into the sit down bar/cafe, but it still would be too much to pay. Hard to get good pohtos because of the steel wires etc. We certainly did not think this attraction was worth the money. Lots of better things to do in Singapore."
,,Just go see the view.,5.0,,S$23 was so worth it. Go at sunset on a clear day. Stayed up there for two hours watching the cityscape and beyond (harbour and Malaysian islands) light up as the sun went down. Amazing.
,,Amazing view,4.0,,This is a great way to see Singapore and get some good photos while you're at it! The barriers and safety measures can get in the way a bit when you are trying to take photos but otherwise it is great. It is quite expensive but it is so unique and different (like many things in Singapore!) and i think it is worth a visit at least once!
,,Sky is at your reach,5.0,,"This is one of the best place to view the beauty of Singapore. Specially in the evenings. However the cost is too much and also they are not providing any guide to the visitors. I think there must be a guide or at least pre recorded explanation about the view from the sky park. Otherwise we just go there paying S$20.00 and lean against the wall and watch outside. The garden by the bay view from the sky park is amazing.
although there is a discount voucher for 10% with the Sky Park ticket most of the visitors cannot enjoy it since they cannot afford to spend S$ 50.00 at the restaurant."
,,The view is great~,4.0,,"This one is the alternative of the Singapore flyer. both are good views for Singapore city. Previously visitors can go around the pool area, which was quite nice place. but now visitors is prohibited from pool area. The view is quite nice, only thing is the glass for safety purpose prevents many cameras ..."
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,"the pic of this place makes one just go there...this is special...perhaps the best in Singapore...

the skypark is a must go....guests in MBS can go for a swim and if you are not staying you can vist it...theres a 27$ entry fee for tourists...however the better way to go is just vist the lounge or the bar or the restaurant in the sky park..."
,,Don't miss the view,4.0,,"I do not regret my plans : visit Gardens by the Bay and go to the MBS roof top before sundown to enjoy the view by daytime and nighttime. Great views to the sea , harbor and city. Why miss on this ?"
,,"Nice pool, beautiful view",5.0,,I didn't live in the Marina Bay Sands hotel so I didn't get to swim in the pool. It the view is beautiful at sunset and in the evening. The pool is really nice. I would love to spend some time in Sands next time.
,,Worth seeing,5.0,,After over 5 years since last visiting Singapore I was getting a little annoyed with all the photographers at the entrance to most major attractions. Best say no to the photos at Skypark entrance and get a passer by to snap you on the Skypark itself. It's just a shot against a blue screen photoshopped onto basically your chosen backdrop. The skypark itself has magical views with no glass but make sure that wrist strap is on.
,,Well worth it!!,5.0,,"Typical tourist attraction - pay for ticket, go towards entry, 'hold on a minute, we'll take a photo'. If only I'd known I would have taken my bags off and maybe combed my hair! (We did buy the superimposed photo, showing us in front of the Marina Bay Sands and the Science Museum & it will remind us of our visit)
The views were well worth the fee - although there is no seating on the observation deck everyone seemed happy to be at the glass appreciating all one could see. It was almost impossible to see the infinity pool & that part is not open to observation deck visitors. A peek around the barrier gives just a glimpse of the stunning facilities for those staying at the hotel.
There is a bar and restaurant in the observation area with very comfy seating and sunshades - people were vying to take our space when we were leaving. It was lovely to laze and enjoy a drink in such an unusual place. Would recommend a visit if you've time whilst in Singapore - but I guarantee you won't want to go on the Flyer afterwards!!"
,,Nice views,4.0,,"This is a must when visiting Singapore. Go in the evening, have a drink and soak in the views of a great city."
,,View from the top,4.0,,"I love any roof top view. We came here twice, once in the day and the second was at night. Bith times it was an awesome experience. We came in the day and had a cocktail at the bar which was well worth it taking in the magnificent view. ( this was at Ku Da Ta). The second time we came we went to the observation deck at night, bought a hot chocolate took all the usual night time view pics, then we went round the back before you exit to sit down and watch the 9pm light show. Which was great. As we had just seen the light show at 7 from the bottom."
,,Outstanding Views,5.0,,"The views are outstanding...a must see when in Singapore..57th floor is pretty amazing!!! We started off with drinks and snacks and ended up staying for dinner. Just to sit and see as far as you can and relax, it was awesome."
,,Great views but.....,4.0,,"Can't argue with the fabulous views but a few minus points: On the observation deck there is nowhere to sit down and there is only an extremely basic drinks kiosk. Some of the staff were unfriendly. When buying our tickets, 3 of the 6 counters were closed even though staff were sitting around doing nothing. When we went up to the counter we were told off because we hadn't waited to be called forward. On the way to get in the lift we were approached by the in-house photographers. We said we didn't want a picture but they said it was compulsory! On getting out of the lift at the top they pounced on us with the picture and were quite off when we wouldn't buy it! It just felt like they know they are the premier tourist attraction and are doing you a favour in letting you visit!
Having said all that we wouldn't have missed it."
,,Thrilling in every detail!,5.0,,"One cannot go to Singapore without having the marvelous experience of admiring the city from the Observatory Deck of this iconic building. One can go up there for lunch or dinner at the ""Ku De Ta"" restaurant; for having a drink at the bar or just to admire the breathtaking views of this gorgeous city. We've been there in a Saturday evening and it was great!"
,,Nice but very expensive view,4.0,,"After reading all not so positive reviews we decided not to spend 23 Sing Dollar /Person to visit the deck, rather we went up to Ku De Ta Bar for free and had some expensive drinks. The view is fabolous and the atmosphere too. Staff was very welcoming and polite. Dresscode applies! No shorts tank tops and flip flops. Spend your money on drinks rather than on the observatory. It is even one floor below the bar. One drink approx 23 sing Dollar but view awesome!!!!"
,,great views,5.0,,excellent photo opportunities and to see the amazing infinity pool!! also amazing views of the gardens
,,Exotic experience worth going to Sky park Marina Sand Bay,5.0,,"""Marina Bay Sands Skypark dominates the skyline across the bay. The viewing platform at the top is a very big wooden deck / style platform with wide views across the city of Singapore. We visited this during the middle of the day, (very bright and the glare was quite strong, so be sure to take sunglasses), which was fabulous.""
not to forget to go ot the roof top Swimming Pool very amazing Experience"
,,Must See,5.0,,"We went to the top for a drink and the views are spectacular, a must see when in Singapore. The drinks are expensive but well worth it, we would like to go back to Ku De Ta for dinner one day."
,,WOW !,5.0,,"What a spectacular building ..awesome ...we just had to go on the roof terrace ...surprised by the cost ...but hey ho its a must do thing
We had a drink in the terrace bar and providing you dont think about the lack of supporting structures beneath you ....its a lovely experience with fantastic views"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"This is a must see/do - such amazing structures and detail, you feel like you're on a different planet.. Take your time to take it all in then pop over to Ku de ta for a cocktail. The most amazing view of Singapore."
,,Expensive 10 minute photo taking,2.0,,"A huge disappointment.
You pay $23 per person to get the lift up to the viewing area with high hopes. The speed of the lift should perhaps be the highlight of the visit.
You eventually arrive at the viewing gallery to find there's nothing up there but a seedy bar area selling expensive drinks.
You can look over at the infinity pool, just, but the promised 360 degree views are simply not available as you only have access to a small area at the 'front of the boat'
Wondering round, fighting to get to the areas you want for your photo takes a few minutes. There were few people here when we went, but I imagine in the peak of season this would be a nightmare.
Once you're done with the photo taking there's nothing else to do but go down again.
You can get many of the same photos, with the possible the exception of one down to the gardens by the bay from the top of other buildings so save your money and have a nice drink somewhere else to celebrate."
,,Something to remember,4.0,,"The views from the top of the hotel are really something to remember. We did not pay the entrance fee, but chose to take the elevator to the bar and did not regret. The bar is located on the same floor as the swimming pool and though you would not be able to come close to the swimming pool, you would still be able to see it quite closely and make some wonderfull pictures. The viewing platform for which you have to pay is located one floor below and you would not be able to see the magnificent pool. We also ordered club sandwich at KuDeTa and it tasted nice, so spend you money on some food/drink and enjoy the beautiful views while sitting at the bar drinking some cool juice and having a snack."
,,Expensive but worth it,5.0,,The Strand has an excellent observation deck which can be visited by non hotel guests. You pay a hefty S$23 for that privilege but the view on top is amazing. They do not let you in the pool area which is reserved for hotel guests but that is no major let down since you can see pools everywhere and I guess you are there for the view. You have an almost 360 degree view and the signs help you identify the landmarks. Definitely worth doing.
,,Amazing Building,5.0,,This was one on the highlights of my visit to Singapore. The superfast lift whizzed me up to the 57th floor in the time it talks to go up about 3 floors in some lifts. At the top you are restricted to a small area which does not include the infinity pool but does provide almost 360 degree views of Singapore. After checking out this view I decided not to bother with the Singapore Flyer as I was looking down towards it and it would not have been as good a view as this.
,,The Singapore White Elephant,3.0,,"Much has and will be written about the sheer size and scale of this development which forms a recent imposition on the city state island's skyline from which there is little escape. Designed to look like an inverted sailing boat it looks from afar like a massive concrete surfboard supported by three concrete pillars.

On visiting, the bold and aggressive architectural statement gives way to an impersonal and unimpressive arrival point and a vast entrance lobby with queues so large, the moor well heeled can check in at a more genteel desk away from the madding crowd.

The vaunted Level 57 was a disappointment. The bar was tacky and unclean whilst the furniture was stained and varnish peeling. The view is what you would expect from being that high but the pool area was claustrophobic with sunloungers crammed together in one orderly line giving the appearance of an elevated hotel in the costas on a larger scale.

There were tell tale signs of deterioration of finishes and several areas on all levels including ground floor retail were closed due to maintenance works.

The upmarket retail and casino will no doubt attract the well heeled crowds from Asia and the less discerning Europeans escaping the northern hemisphere gloom but as a holiday destination it is frenetic and expensive and as a building already in a state of disrepair it's legacy will be that of an unmistakeable white elephant on a beautiful skyline."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,What a view at the skyline from singapore especially at financial district! I recommend to go up there a few minutes before sunset and watch the city pretending in a sea of lights Stunning moment!
,,top of singapore view !,5.0,,"Not only can you see the entire view of the whole Marina Bay area, you can actually enjoy the view with the lazer lights etc when the water show is on nightly 55 floors below at ground level. if you are up there and looking out, let me a lcoal gvie you an overall feeling view of the area. you are actually standing on reclaimed land !! YES the whole was reclaimed ! what you see across looking at the Fullerton hotel was the former General Post Office built by the British and that was in front of the sea too !! so everything from that road when you are looking out was land and everything on your right and left including the Marina Bay Financial Center (high rise buildings and condominiums etc) on your left AND the durian looking structure on the right of your view are the Esplanade theater and the Marina Center where the 4 hotels are located too.
So now enjoy your view again with this understanding and if you have time go to the adjacent attraction which is called the Marina Barrage which regulates and hold the water which you see infront of you. this is the latest reserviour to save water for Singapore and in future will be used also for water recreation as well. if you are still there, peer straight out and just infront of the long rectangular building infront of the Fullerton Hotel and next to the newly added Fullerton Bay Hotel, you can spot the MERLION, the mystical creature of Singapore."
,,Breath taking views,5.0,,"Got the lift to the 56th floor for about £10 - pensioner rate. You only have access to the observation deck but it is awesome. There is a restaurant up there for visitors but they are not allowed to access the swimming pool thank G**. Google it to see what I mean.
The observation deck is only just higher than the Singapore Flyer & also overlooks a football field in the harbour below with water on 3 sides.
Out to sea I have never seen so many boats.
At night they put on a fantastic laser show which can be seen from the other side of the harbour."
,,great views,5.0,,We loved the view from level 56 . 360 degree view of area. Not for the faint hearted. Amazing shops in the complex
,,"Great for drinks, dinner or both",5.0,,A unique experience. Overlooks the city which is spectacular at night. The roof top infinity pool that runs the length go the building has to be seen to be believed. Long pants required for evening. Drinks are pricey so sip it if you have too. Dining room offers same spectacular experience.
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,"This is a small city,that has been fit into a major mall.It has anything and everything ,theatres,casino,hotels etc.And be assured,its quite ,quite pricy as most of the shops are brand names from across the globe.Its sooo huge,I kept getting lost within it.Then take time to visit the Casino-its free for foreigners and see what a world class Casino looks like.I didnt gamble,being in Singapore had already stretched my backpackers budget."
,,A Great View,4.0,,You have to pay to get to the top although the price is reasonable. You get a better view than the Singapore Flyer. However only part of the Skypark is available to you. The bar can be accessed and the drinks are only a bit dearer but beware as after 6.00pm 'gentlemen must wear long trousers'. A great view is to be had.
,,great view,5.0,,"You have to pay to go up to the sky park which was about 40$ dollars,but the view from there is fantastic and well worth it,we had 2 stella`s which was way overpriced at 50$ but thats singapore for you."
,,"Structurally great, but overcrowded and over-rated",2.0,,"Nuisance in having to show room card everywhere. Very crowded, no separate area for hotel guests. Restaurants (Ku-De-Ta, and Sky57) very poor food, and very expensive."
,,"Not for the Height Challenged, but Awesome!",5.0,,"This unique landmark of Singapore is spectacular. It has this awesome sky-park with infinity pool atop the 3 57 story towers. If you like good views, they don't come any better."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"The view from 57th floor is breathtaking, especially in the evening, when the city center lights up. The laser / light show is something they still should work on and not worth your time."
,,Superb amazing place,5.0,,"At the top of marina bay we feel we are in the heaven. Nice view to Singapore flyer, Botonical gardens. Awesome place we had lots of fun."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"I saw the building by chance just walking around in the harbour area and decided to try to get to the top. From at distance you see the building as three massive ""towers"" with a shiplike construction on top uniting the three towers. Go there! Its worth the 20 SGD it costs,- the view is really great of Singapore as well as the open waters with hundreds of ships. The restaurant is ok but a bit expensive. From the ground you can spot a number of palm trees as well but that area is only for hotel guests."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands has a fantastic mall at its base. The Skypark cost 23 SGD. It is a good view of Singapore. I would say the Singapore Flyer is a more enjoyable experience, but they are both great. You can see all of Singapore from the Indonesian islands to the south to the Malaysian mountains to the north. It is a very interesting place to visit on a clear day."
,,Must visit while in SIN,5.0,,This is a must visit place in SIN. Its taller than Singapore Flyer. Actually if you visit the sky park. you don't need to visit the Flyer. Except you really want a turning experience. If you wish to have a drink than just ask the guard to show you the lift for BAR. You can skip the entrance fee for the Sky park. BAR is just on the deck of Sky park. The bad thing: Only a limited part is open for Sky park visitor. You need to be a guest of the hotel for visiting whole Sky park including swimming pool.
,,Very nice hotel with singapore city view,5.0,,"The hotel is very good and stylish. Although , they charge entry fee for going to 56th floor, it is worth visiting. you can enjoy the complete singapore view. w felt it is better than singapore flyer."
,,A Fine View from the Top,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is an iconic structure in Singapore. Seeing Singapore from this perspective is a definite thrill. If you are not a guest, going up to the Skypark is charged at 23 SGD. You're limited to staying on the viewing deck, though. It is a better perspective from a hotel-staying guest because you get to experience dipping in their infinity pool which looks out to Singapore. The experience from this may just be unparalleled."
,,Great view,5.0,,"We went here by night, and the view was really good. You had to pay to get up there, but it was well worth it. Compared to the Singapore flyer I would say it's a close call, this is probably a bit better as you get an unobstructed view across the whole of Singapore from this place.

I would really recommend going here if you are in Singapore."
,,Thrill...,4.0,,Skyscraper...One of the best place i have been in singapore...You can have a complete 360 degree view of singapore city...MUST VISIT...
,,At the top of the world!,5.0,,"The view is literally breath-taking.
In the early morning (8am would be early for a holiday) it was not as crowded as expected; it gets a bit more populated later, but not unpleasantly.
Can get a bit windy because of the height, the water of the pool is not exactly warm.
I am definitely fishing for cons here...
LOL
DO NOT MISS IT!!!!"
,,Awesome view from the top!,5.0,,Get the thrill and see the skyscraper of Marina Bay. Dip on top of the Skypool and get to see the Marina Bay horizon. You'll be surprised to know to know that you have activities to choose from while there. Take a dip at the pool or get yourself a Jacuzzi or satisfy your appetite after your activities at the Skypool.
,,Perfect City view,3.0,,"From the Marina Bay Sands Skypark you will be able to view all the greatness of Singapore. Would recommend you to visit at night, when all the city is lighted up and you can enjoy a refreshing breeze. You will have stunning 360 views of Singapore' skyline."
,,MUST Visit,5.0,,"Again, this is MUST visit place. The experience of watching the city from such height itself is amazing. If you have taken a singapore flyer, then this would be same, but this is far taller than the flyer and it also gives you 360 degree view of the city. And by any chance, if you get a chance to book a room in this, then you are privileged to swim in the infinity swimming pool which is altogether a different and amazing experience."
,,Over-rated and expensive,3.0,,"This is a very expensive way to see the view of Singapore. When you get to the top, there is nowhere to sit and only a very small gift shop."
,,It´s all about the view,3.0,,"So you have heard about view of The Sands? Yes, it is quite amazing. But do not expect a fancy roof top bar like for example in Bangkok (Lebua State Tower or Red Sky at Centara Grand). With plank floors and average service it is just about worth it. The price of 18 SGD for a pint is still worth for the view but the drink bar it self is not worth to visit."
,,Will give it a second chance,4.0,,"Was staying at the hotel on business and fell very ill. As I could barely get out of bed I tried to call the concierge and the special service line to see if I could bet some medicine despite calling over 10 times no one picked up. I finally had to use my dubai phone to call the hotel internationally just to get a response ( although they did say they were having issues with their phone system). Finally got through but was told there was no medicine sold in any of their shops (I was just after paracetamol) and that the nearest pharmacy was 10 minutes away. I could barely speak and it was clearly apparent that I was very sick but rather than offering to send someone to go there for me they just gave me directions.

As a hotel it was just too big and if you are looking for intimacy then this is not the place for you. The room however was well furnished, very spacious and had great bathroom facilities. The check-in staff and the bellboys however we're amazing friendly and very efficient"
,,Wow! Incredible views!,5.0,,"For me it wasn't just about the views at the top, but rather the entire experience of the Marina Bay Sands. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't a guest at the hotel, I just followed the signs for the Skypark from the Helix Bridge and somehow ended up in Tower 1 instead of 3. This meant I got to see inside the hotel and all I can say is WOW! The architecture is incredible with its pyramid like structure inside that allows the ceiling to seem never-ending. The artwork installations are wonderful and I really wish I had the money to stay there for just one night. If the hotel itself doesn't blow you away then the views certainly will. For about 20 SGD you get to ride the elevator to the 56th floor and step out onto a large deck area, 200m from the ground, with panoramic views across the whole of Singapore! If you are a guest at the hotel you can indulge in the infinity pool and a number of bars and restaurants. For us ticket holders you are restricted to the one side, however, there is a restaurant to enjoy a meal or drink. The views really are spectacular with one side showing off the bay with the hundreds of ships heading in and out of Singapore, the Gardens of the Bay, the Singapore Flyer and everything in between. On the other side you look down on the Helix Bridge, Art Science Museum and the whole of Marina Bay and beyond. There is no time limit so you can wonder up there for hours which is what I did. I highly recommend this if you are visiting Singapore and to spend time in the lobby of the hotel as well, the architecture really is great!"
,,Amazing views,5.0,,We couldn't get on the observation deck we apparantely left it to late to book but we went up to the bar for a drink which was soooo expensive. The views from the top were amazing and well worth a visit its not for vertigo suffers.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Must see attraction! I was lucky as I was staying in the hotel so could come up at any time so I went up during the day and night. The views are simply amazing at night when you see all the lights of the city light up! Good atmosphere and best view of Singapore.
,,Un-believable,5.0,,Accessed only by being a room guest of the hotel it has absolutely crazy views of Singapore. The pool is amazing to lounge around in on a hot day and the cocktails will flow very easily if you let them. Waiters are everywhere ready to pounce if you need something. Definitely some of the best customer service I have ever seen in a hotel.
,,recent stay,5.0,,"great pool albeit very crowded and a lot of litter around, the view was amazing and especially at night. BUT its not worth paying the price of the hotel room to swim in it. Pool side Service was very slow"
,,Go!,5.0,,"It's one of those places you can see from everywhere and yet you don't know whether to go!
Go.
You have to find the entrance to the sky park and then choose to get a lounge pass. This is free.
go to the 57th and you exit at the bar restaurant
We went mid afternoon and had a light lunch and fruit juice.
The prices are what you might expect...a little high!
The views are great and there was no pressure at all to vacate our table.
We enjoyed the experience and will go again.
Relaxing and the best view in Singapore. All for free"
,,Nice views,4.0,,A good place to visit but nothing amazing. The pool covers 180 degrees which is not accessible unless you are a guest so you only get 180 degrees or less of the view so can be done & dusted in 15 mins or less.
,,Unreal,4.0,,"From a distance it looks as if a boat has been grounded on top of 3 huge towers.In fact straddling the 3 on the 57th floor is a bar/restaurant and a beach/infinity pool looking down!Not for vertigo sufferers!Fantastic views,can eat or drink outside or inside if you want a/c.Good drinks and food."
,,Top of the World,5.0,,"I had never heard of this fabulous place before visiting Singapore. The Skypark is a crescent-shaped deck at the 56th floor level atop three hotel towers, overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and Singapore harbor on one side and most of the city on the other. The views are fabulous and the Skypark offers unobstructed views for picture-taking. Yes, it is rather expensive (about US$16) but worth the money in my opinion. Guests of the truly expensive 2500 room hotel have full access to the entire Skypark, including restaurants and a swimming pool. When I was there on a Saturday afternoon in February it was not at all crowded."
,,expansive,3.0,,"just a small part is accessible, no seating, no shade but one fast food stall. No access to the Restaurant. Admission fee p.p. S$ 20.00"
,,Nice but full of selfie picture takers,4.0,,"I admit, I wanted to be in the place while I was staying in the hotel, but mannnnn.... it was full of people taking pictures of themselves. The view is lovely and luck for us the the weather was good, but still - kinda hard to enjoy the place with all those selfie photographers..."
,,Worth the money,4.0,,"The view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel is amazing, on a clear day you can see almost all of Singapore, or it at least feels like it. It might be a little pricey but it is really worth a visit, you get a great view of Singapore from the top!"
,,Above the rest,5.0,,Amazing architecture and enjoyable spot for a sunset visit or SkyBar/restaurant. Drinks aren't cheap but what would you expect. Loved it.
,,if you like heights..,4.0,,"This is not for the faint hearted..
Even the lift up to the 54th floor is quite an experience..
So fast it makes your ears pop..
The skywalk gives you a panoramic view of the city flyer
The marina etc..
It was windy the day we went up and you feel as though you will be swept over the edge.."
,,amazing view!,5.0,,"You really have an amazing view from up there. But before you go to the View Platform, consider going to the Ku De Ta Bar. Grab a drink, have the same view and pay almost the same!
After 6pm there is an dress code in the Ku De Ta."
,,A world in its own,5.0,,"Yes you got the title absolutely right, its a world in itself which is full of wonders in it, You will see the majestic view of Singapore from here and probably you shop in one of the world's best place to shop. Everything here is so special in itself that I am sure we don't come across with these places so easily.

So its my recommendation do visit this place."
,,Marina bay sands,5.0,,"this is a real happening place, but mind you don't visit this place in afternoon, just go to the top floor in the night and see the whole of singapore from the 56th floor it's mind boglling."
,,Great observation deck especially at night,5.0,,Way higher than the flyer and great view from the observation deck. Stayed at hotel so got to use the pool as well and well worth the effort and cost!
,,See it once - so you can say you have done it !!,3.0,,"Before entering the lift to travel to the 56th floor, your photo was taken. Staff said before leaving the skypark your photo will be ready. Instantly stepping out of the lift - our photo was ready and waiting and for 50 Singapore dollars it was yours (was presented in a nice folder, but, seriously way too expensive - delete the folder and it was cheaper. Entry was S23.00. A warm day but, still breezy there. View was lovely, but, preferred to spend my time and money on the Singapore Flyer. A small gift shop was available - once again expensive for what was on offer. Can say I have experienced the skypark but, would not do it again. Upon leaving to go to the lifts the lady was still trying to get us to purchase the photo (with or without the cover, the answer was still no)."
,,must see,5.0,,"excellent different, large, good relaxing indoor and outdoor time, very pricey,excellent different, large, good relaxing indoor and outdoor time, very pricey,"
,,What a view!,5.0,,This is absolutely the best city view in Singapore. Enjoy cocktails at night at the top of the building. Make a reservation or just go up and stand at the bar. Seats do open up in waves. You can even go later when it's less people.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Fantastic views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, although note that you do have to pay and only get access to a deck at one end and not the whole of the top."
,,A must do,4.0,,"As with the flyer I have always put this trip off, but so glad I did it.
The view is outstanding but I couldn't stay up there too long, too high for me, there is a small shop and photo will cost you 25 or the book in a case $50au & entry to the Skypark is $20au....still well worth it."
,,Another must do!,5.0,,"The lift whisked us to the 56 floor and the moment you go out on the cantilevered decking the views just take your breath away. We also had lunch and drinks on the higher deck, access is controlled probably to limit numbers or keep children to a minimum? Recommended for all but the very faint of heart!"
,,"Wow, its so high",5.0,,Go to the top of the big hotel. There is a shopping mall that goes on forever near there. The whole area is very fancy.
,,Wow,5.0,,This place is amazing... The view fantastic it's one of the things you have to do when in SG. . I have been up a few times.and the SG skyline never fails to impress.. The new stadium there building looks amazing
,,Wow !,5.0,,Well worth the $20 and no queuing at time of my visit (1000). View is amazing and appeared you could spend as much time there as you liked. Not to be missed.
,,Great view from high up in the sky,5.0,,"Better than Singapore flyer for the view, open air and place to walk. The photograph which is a morphed one for 30 sgd is not worth it. Without the spend on photos felt 'twas value for money."
,,Fabulous views,5.0,,"I did enjot going up to see the view on the 56th floor but I did feel that $23 was a bit expensive as I went and had a look, took photos and came down again so really I probably would not go up there again. However you can see all over singapore in all directions"
,,The Best Rooftop View Ever,5.0,,This building itself is simply awesome with the top of the building built like a ship. You must go to the rooftop to get the most magnificent view over Singapore. Simply awesome.
,,Absolutely overpriced - visit Pinnacle@Duxton instead!,1.0,,"Paying 20 SGD for this small observation deck is just too much! The promised 360° panorama look is missing as you can only move at the very front of the ""Skypark-boat"". I understand that this must be a delightful place for hotel guests who can use the infinity pool and stuff but for a mere public visitor the provided (or better: not provided) service is very poor for this price.
For only 5 SGD you can go up to the 50th floor sky terrace at the Pinnacle@Duxton in Chinatown and walk on a 500 m skybridge (the longest worldwide) with excellent views on Chinatown, Sentosa-Island, the harbour and the Singapur skyline!
It's much more space over there, great panorama and really worth the entrance fee!"
,,Great views - but expensive,4.0,,"Wanted to go up to the top of Sands but only the observation deck is open to non hotel guests. The views are great but it's expensive to get up there and the drinks are expensive swell. Still worth doing!
Might have to stay to experience the rest of the top level."
,,What a view!,5.0,,Great experience.... photo taken very expensive at S$50 but we looked on it as a great memento of our visit.
,,Excellent Views,4.0,,"We have done the Singapore Flyer during both the day and night, the Skypark has the advantage of being at the maximum height for the entire time. If you had a choice of the Flyer or the Skypark, take the Skypark.

Like all tourist attractions, everything comes at a cost, don't expect things to be cheap when you get to the top."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This is a feat of engineering and does not disappoint. If you get a chance to stay at the Marina Bay Sands, ensure you make time to take in the Skypark. Great atmosphere and wonderful views."
,,Night views are amazing,4.0,,Go at night or during sunset so that you can see the transition. Spectacular views of city/bay during night. Almost always crowded whenever we went. No place to sit and food/drinks are too expensive and not worth. Nice place to enjoy.
,,Fantastic View but Expensive,4.0,,"We had been told by a friend that a visit to Skypark was a must whilst in Singapore, so we decided to give it a try. We were a bit surprised at the admittance price, which was 25 SGD each; however we paid up and took the lift to the viewing platform on the 57th floor. The views were magnificent, but there was a haze which meant that photos did not come out very clearly. Having walked along the viewing deck, we were longing for a drink. Despite what some reviewers have said, the staff at Ku de Ta restaurant on the next floor up will let you through into their rooftop bar area for drinks, and you can then take the lift from the 58th back down. We finished up wondering if you could take the lift directly up to Ku de Ta for drinks and avoid paying the Skypark admittance price."
,,Great viewing,4.0,,"Expensive but amazing, panoramic views. Worth it althoughvwoild have loved to buy a coffee & soak up the experience but sadly the restaurant wasn't open..."
,,Breathtaking modernity,4.0,,"It's a very unusual building, a boat atop three columns, a cathedral in steel and glass with superb views, but it has no soul or artistic merit other than sheer sensatyion, and it's quite expensive to drink and eat up there..."
,,"Worth a visit, but very crowded",3.0,,"This is one of those places that you want to experience, but not for very long! The views are, as you'd expect, fantastic, but it is completely packed of people waving their smartphones around taking pictures, including (and indeed especially) in the pool. Don't go expecting anything restful or serene, it's noisy and full of people."
,,Best View of Singapore!!,5.0,,If somebody wants to see the real beautiful Singapore from the top and enjoy too.This is the best place to visit.
,,Only for the scenery,3.0,,"You can see the singapore icon from above, windy, makes you relax.however, lots of people there, it's so crowded. Since we cannot bring the towel to the room, and it so windy the only choice for my daughter is taking shower but unfortunately, there is only 1 room for showering with no soap and shampoo. No locker to keep your money/card/mobile phone."
,,Good view and it is free for hotel guests,5.0,,Not worth paying S$25 for the entrance ticket though. You might as well spend the money for a drink at KU DÉ TA for same but restricted view.
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,truly larger than life structure and absolutely awesome!the view form the top is super amazing!especially at night!
,,Worth the view,4.0,,"This is basically a viewing deck at one end of the platform on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. You have excellent views over parts of Singapore. It's quite expensive, but worth it."
,,The place to be,4.0,,this is a place which is now an icon of singapore. The amazing view of singapore is eye treat for all. also the evening light show is not to be missed.
,,"Cool but pricey , still worth it ( no entrance fee)",4.0,,"Excellent view ; the harbor, the wheel laser show. Go to the bar and have a drink instead of paying the 23 $ entrance fee for the terrace, you are not going to be near the railing but still have a nice view. Drinks were expensive indeed 14 $ for a draft Hoegarden and 16 $ for a McCallan single malt ( we are talking Singaporean dollars a bit less than US $). You can have almost 2 drinks for the price of the entrance but the fee won't guarantee the access in the bar if the bar it's full.Advice, go up and look first ,its free don't have to drink , but it's cool to sip a drink at night, if you feel it's worth the 23 for better pictures you can go down and up again."
,,Beautiful view - must see,5.0,,"The skypark offers you a 300 degree view of the Singaopore skyline. The view is breathtaking to say the least and the best part is that you can spend as long as you like. The skypark is higher than the singapore flyer and offers a wider view. The experience is well worth the ticket price and all visitors would be advised to visit the skypark.
You can stay as long as you want but when it gets too crowded, the staff come around asking people not to sit (so less space is occupied and people who have been there for quite sometime will get tired and leave).
The skypark is not covered and can be closed during inclement weather, in which case refunds are allowed only if you have spent less than an hour in the skypark. So pls check the weather before going there and avoid if it is raining.
The best time to visit the skypark would be sometime before sunset, so you can see the daytime view, the sunset and then view after sunset (which is spectacular).
If you have young children, they might get bored though, since there isnt anything for them to do (apart from buying food at an overpriced stall)."
,,Best ever...,5.0,,"The most memorable place i ever being to. i went there in the late night and in the morning as well since we stayed at the hotel . the infinity pool can't be access by the visitors.but the skypark is allowed.
if you happened to being Singapore , this is one place you should check in your list...."
,,Super Sky Park,5.0,,This is a must !! Take the lift to the 56th floor for the experience of a lifetime. You'll have to walk to the 57th floor to see the swimming pool.
,,"Well, it is nice if you haven't tried Singapore Flyer",3.0,,"The view is nice but the entrance fee is a bit expensive if you are not a hotel guest. I would rather to go to 1-Altitude (at least I get a glass of drink) and the view is great.
If you have tried Singapore Flyer, then skypark is nothing compared to it."
,,The restaurant with the best views across the Bay,5.0,,"You must check out Sky 57 which is a fabulous rooftop restaurant with panoramic views across the bay and beyond. Try swimming in their infinity pool and you feel like you are going to fall off the end of the globe! Fabulous food, wonderful service and excellent service."
,,Great view!,4.0,,Great view from the 56th floor of this hotel. Steeply priced at SGD 23. Gives a good overview of Singapore.
,,Tremendous view,5.0,,I visited at night and the view of the surrounding skyline and harbor was tremendous. I was a little disappointed that the skypark area was limited to one section however it was still very sufficient to take in the full view. I'd suggest visiting slightly off peak to avoid crowds and longer wait times. I visited on a Sunday night just after dark.
,,Excellent views & very grand design,5.0,,"Great views, with a very high market shopping centre below. The whole design just wows you, and you will leave impressed. The views at the top are great but only give 180 degrees and compared to other tower view structures around the world don't offer the same impressions, however, it is outside and you can walk around. To top it off the non alcoholic drinks and food are reasonable to buy. The actual shopping centre and hotel are impressively built with nothing held back. This and the flyer are the 2 iconic structures of the Singapore skyline."
,,Stunning Architecture,4.0,,"A must if you're in Singapore. Fantastic panoramic views with great photo opportunities. Only rated 4 star as I think it's a bit cheeky charging $23 for an adult and $17 for a child (aged 2-12)
Best time to go would be dusk - night time"
,,They think they're so hot...,2.0,,"....And of course they are the hottest spot, but perhaps their service reflects this complacency and so I won't return.
Service is slow. Staff are not welcoming or friendly. Getting in, even if you are hotel guest, is unfriendly and onerous. Come here to admire the architecture but go elsewhere for a warm welcome."
,,Worthwhile experience,5.0,,If you are visiting Singapore I would certainly recommend that you visit the observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Excellent Singapore experience which will be one of the highlights of a visit to Singapore.
,,An Absolute Must,5.0,,"One of the architectural wonders of the world. A view only matched by the Pudong skyline. Unfortunately the space ontop of MBS feels cramped; never mind, you'll turn your back to the crowds anyway ;-)"
,,amazing,5.0,,"loved it, only fault the pool was freezing and food was very expensive but we stayed for the experience of the infinity pool and spectacular views from an amazing structure"
,,Best Hotel in the World,5.0,,Need I say more?? As a Airline Pilot that travels the world. This is by far the best hotel in the world. If you an catch a deal.. BOOK IT! I paid $690USD which probably was a little high.. But would do it again!
,,nice spot to relax,4.0,,The skypark is a great spot to relax if staying at MBS. plenty of chairs in both the sun and shade. when you get to hot just jump in the pool. the food and drinks served here a great. can be a little pricey but when you are relaxing you dont care. haha.
,,Excellent Sunday Brunch,5.0,,"Amazing Sunday Brunch, the food was delicious and the views amazing, can't fault this, if you are in Singapore it is a must do!"
,,Awesome!,4.0,,Drinks and dinner to enjoy the stunning 360 degree views. Definitely worth a visit. Food was nice and service was good but it is definitely the views that make this restaurant worth a visit. An experience like no other.
,,Great view as expected,4.0,,My partner and I went to the Skypark on a Friday night. It was surprisingly quick to get up (small queues) and the deck wasn't crowed at all. Easy to see the sites and great opportunity to take photos.
,,"Thrilling, but pricey",5.0,,"The views from the bar at the top of the hotel and simply breathtaking, well worth the $30 martini :-)"
,,Breathtaking in every way,5.0,,"If you’re not too afraid of heights, this is the place to be on a sunny afternoon in Singapore. 56 stories up; on the prow of a massive, curved boat-like structure that rests along the tops of three 55 story hotel towers. The view is breathtaking in every direction, and there is a modest snack bar with draft beer to enjoy at your leisure. A year ago when I saw a model of this building, I thought it was just a designer’s dream. It was amazing to see it up close from the ground and from the observation deck. The $20 admission seemed reasonable when compared to other observation towers we’ve visited. There is also an option to include dinner at the restaurant one final floor up. Highly recommended!"
,,MBS city view is awesome,4.0,,"MBS is one of the best hotels in Singapore, with amazing view (Gardens By The Bay View and City View). Pool spa are crowded anytime of the day."
,,View in the Sky,4.0,,"Superb panoramic views, liked the fact you had a very clear view across the Marina Bay an then the city. Single price ok. But don't waste extra money going to the bar as the view is the same."
,,Breathtaking View!,4.0,,As a landmark Marina Bay Sands is absolutely stunning. For viewing Singapore skyline this place is perfect. View from 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands is absolutely breathtaking. Ticket price is SGD 23 for adults which I feel is overpriced. It’s just an observation desk. However it’s recommended if you visit Singapore and want to get an outstanding view. I recommend visitors to go there in the afternoon time. In that case you can enjoy both day and night time view and heat will be lower.
,,Unbelievable......,5.0,,"this attraction n its experience was just awesome,matchless.seeing the amazing views fm the skypark was heavenly.the bars n pubs there r v good. total ambiance is infectious n romantic.but ya the tickets r very expensive and the bars also demand u to shell out lot of money.so b prepared for that but dont miss it out..there is a huge swimming pool also giving u a feel of another world.it gives u the overall look of singapore fm the 57th floor.and yes a good tip--its free to go up before 9pm but have to follow the dress code..."
,,Best place,5.0,,This is the best place i visited in singapore. Once really enjoy the night life. View is very good. At night you can also enjoy the light show
,,Most unfriendly staff,1.0,,"I do not recommend it, the view is nice and you can take several nice photos, but is quite expensive S$ 23 for adults, and the staff is about the most unfriendly I can recall in my experience as a tourist. There is no place to sit and no shade, and the restaurant and the booth are way too expensive, about twice the price you pay at ground level for the same food. This iconic hotel is really something to see for its architecture, but if I were a hotel guest, with the price it has, I would hate to see so many tourists walking around the lobby"
,,Not a park,5.0,,"Not to be confused with a park, this is merely an observation deck. This is a good way to get an overview of Singapore from the 57th floor."
,,Go to the skybar and get the same view free,5.0,,"The view is exactly the same from the sky bar/ku de ta restaurant, so go there and save your money. It's free to go up before 9pm... As long as you comply with the dress code."
,,It's a tourist trap.,3.0,,"It's crowded, and expensive. You only get a 180 degree view of Singapore if you don't access it through the Marina Bay Sands Hotel Guest Pool. Not really worth the expense if you are here just to take a peek. It's also very hot up there."
,,Go to the skybar and get the same view free,5.0,,"The view is exactly the same from the sky bar/ku de ta restaurant, so go there and save your money. It's free to go up before 9pm... As long as you comply with the dress code."
,,"Over rated, over priced, and under serviced",2.0,,"Chose to pay the s$23, to go up the 57 or so flights to a very limited part of the north end of the sky deck. Cheaper than the Singapore flyer(big wheel) and you can stay as long as you want. One overpriced standing only kiosk, with security guards to prevent access to the sit down area/ cafe for hotel guests only. If you want to pay min $400 night, you can visit the sky garden for ' nothing' . Maybe I just had a bad day, or it was really over priced, under serviced, and over rated."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Just said it all on marina bay but will say again if you do anything in singapore this is number1 the views are amazing you see singapore in one visit here breathtaking views photographers heaven in the sky could not recommend enough got to be done
,,Spectacular view!,3.0,,This is worth it the views are amazing but go in the early evening and watch the sunset behind the skyscrapers. This is a little pricey at S$23 it just went up on Jan 1st 2014 nice going Sands soak the tourists for everything they got. And then you want to charge me S$15 for a photo come on try and be an ambassador of Singapore instead of trying to cover your way to expensive rooms!
,,What a view,4.0,,"Fantastic building great views from the top, dont miss it and the laser light show in the evenings it is truely wonderful"
,,Spectacular,5.0,,The most breathtaking view over the city! A MUST if U are in Singapore!The best if you stay at Marina bay sands and have everyday access to the pool
,,Great view,5.0,,Not cheap but worth the 23SD. Fabulous view over Marina Bay and beyond. Alternatively you could just do cocktails at the Ku De Ta bar but view is limited.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Well worth the admission price, awesome view. Certainly something for the locals to be proud of and will definitely be a landmark for years to come."
,,Excellent at night,5.0,,"We came here at night to check out the view. It costs $20 to go to the skypark, but it is free to get a lift to the restaurant that is above the skypark. It is a bit of a tourist trap, but excellent. Sitting on the desk with white sangria, is the perfect way to end a day exploring in Singapore."
,,Great views over Singapore,5.0,,Good to get your bearings. Stopped for a refreshing drink at the Skypark restaurant/bar. Pool area is only for hotel guests (looked quite incredible)
,,Picture time,5.0,,"You can't miss this,having cocktails on level 57 ,enjoying 360 degree view It's priceless . ticket at reasonable price for a great observatory deck."
,,great attraction,4.0,,"great thrill was had on this tour experience,a bit pricey but well worth the visit.by prepared with an umbrella especially during this time of the year"
,,Breathtaking!!!,5.0,,"A trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete without a visit to the unbelievable Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The views from up there are incredible, and you can watch for hours, all the activity going on down below, in the harbour or even the planes coming into land.
At$23 it isn't cheap, but feel it is better value than the Singapore Flyer @$33.
While over at Marina Bay area, you can also wander around the shopping complex, bay front, and the Helix
Bridge.
A great afternoon."
,,Nice view from the top,4.0,,Although it's of a small space but The Skypark has a great view from top to the whole of Singapore and the marina. Enjoyed it and would recommend it.
,,Get a great look at Singapore,4.0,,"If you do not like heights - reconsider your adventures, but it is really worth the visit. An another amazing feat of architecture in a city that is so diverse in its skyline!!"
,,Breath taking view from above,5.0,,We had wanted to view a landscape of singapore. There are so many tall buildings but we settled down with this as we were shopping our moolahs out at the Marina Bay shopping centre. Singapore is a city of light. So beautiful.
,,Skypark rooftop,1.0,,"The amazing 3 linked towers look like part of a giant flyover that just stops, until you see that there on the linking rooftop, there are gardens and trees. The hotel and shopping complex is vast. A visit and a drink on the rooftop (you will have to pay) definitely a must, although the drinks are very pricey."
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"We went to the pub on the roof for the amazing views of the city, avoiding the S$20.00 required to get onto the viewing platform and as we weren't even pestered to have a drink we got to see it all for free. Just ask at the last desk on the left inside the main building for a pass to have a drink in the bar. And don't forget to walk through the Marina Sands Shopping Complex with its skating rink or have a ride in a Gondala along a small river that meanders around the ground floor. It was amazing and reminiscent of Malls in Dubai just smaller and easier to get around."
,,Restaurant meal on sky on55,3.0,,As we went there for a special occasion. we found the food very average for a lot of money. but saying that we were seated at a window table with fantastic views over Singapore
,,Overpriced and over rated,2.0,,"There is no doubt that the views from such a high building are spectacular but apart from that there is little to be said in favor of the trip. The observation area, which is relatively small, was the only available area to visit unless you are a hotel guest when the restaurant and bars were accessible. The commercial ""shop"" sold junk goods that were available in china town and malls at lower prices (should anyone wish to buy such items!) and apart from the obvious photo shoot the overall experience was disappointing.
The view of the sky park from the Merlion is much more appealing that the reverse."
,,Perfect Bird's Eye View,5.0,,"It was beautiful, going up to the topmost promenade of SE Asia's most famous buildings was exhilarating. The view from the top was gorgeous and it really was worth the trip up, you can see almost all of Singapore and the gardens were impeccable. Although we only availed of the tour and were not guests of the hotel, it was a pleasant trip that made our holiday more satisfying."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Tourists, especially those visiting for the first time, should really come and see the view Marina Bay has to offer. Really great. Definitely worth it!"
,,Great Panoramic Views of Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"Only guests are allowed to get into the pool area so if you want to get into the Skypark to check out the stunning panoramic views of the Singapore skyline, you have to be a guest of the F&B outlets namely Ku De Ta, Sky on 57 and The Club."
,,nice,3.0,,"The building is very impressive, but when you get to the roof you have limit area for viewing as you can`t get to the pool area. If you want to see some more views, go to the pub on the roof . You may see the unique pool from there and more views of the city skyline."
,,Views forever,5.0,,"So were werent a guest of the hotels so didnt get to swim in the infinity pool , however the view of both the pool and Singapore with cold cocktail in hand was a wonderful experience"
,,French fries recommended,5.0,,The experience was once in a lifetime thing. The pool is not suitable for swimming with the crowd people. But anyway it's for your unforgettable experience in lifetime. I went up there in the middle of day and fully enjoyed strong sunshine shower and spectacular view I can't describe with my tongue. One couple ordered French fries and it looked delicious and funny. So I ordered it. It was the best French fries I ever had eaten.
,,A view to die for!!!,5.0,,"Fabulous view day and night, we saw fireworks that were spectacular, definitely worth a visit, you wont be disappointed."
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,How many times do you see something like this?? I highly recommend you take a ride up to the top or go to the bar and avoid the cost of the view platform. Then walk around the water below to take in the scenery of such a unique structure. I took the boat ride around the river- relaxing and full of nice scenery!
,,Unbelievable views.,5.0,,A must do while in Singapore. Although you are 56 floors up in the sky you feel very safe and the views are to die for.
,,Wonderful Views,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is a spectacular building so no visit to Singapore would be complete without a visit to the top to take in the view of Singapore. Even though they point out to to that the viewing platform is only a small section of the roof top, it is sufficiently large that you can still get a great view of both the sea and the city. You can certainly take some spectacular photos up there and we thought the cost was not too bad (you get a 25% discount for using AMEX). For 3 people, it was around $57 Singapore. They also take a photo of you at the beginning which is available for purchase superimposed onto the Marina Bay Sands as a background ($30 Singapore). Others have also complained that you cannot see the famous infinity pool - however, you can see it quite clearly from the top of the stairs leading to the 57th floor - all be it you are not right next to it. Other reviewers have suggested getting a drink instead at the 57th floor bar - which is definitely worth thinking about - however, this has a $30 minimum spend per person - so this would have cost a lot more than $57 for the 3 of us - and it seemed that you needed to make a booking with the hotel to visit the bar. So the Skypark is well worth a look!"
,,Amazing Views and amazing building,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel rules the Singapore skyline with S'pore Flyer. We had a dinner on rooftop terrace KuDeTa and then took some nice pictures. Especially night time view is truly amazing. Don't miss this one.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,This is an amazing bit of Architecture. It overlooks Gardens By The Bay. Great pictures are to be had day or night. Eat at a restaurant and you can travel to the park at no charge.
,,Magnificent Views....,5.0,,"Loved the view from the pool from top of Singapore. Services are great too.

Just hope that Pool water temperature is a bit higher at Sky Parks cause we were all shivering within 10 mins. Tried the pool in the evening and the afternoon, but same temperature both times."
,,Fabulous views,4.0,,"Well worth the trip to the top of the tower you get fabulous view across the city from here for miles. Unfortunately our timing was wrong because with had one of their regular downpours whilst up there but even that was an experience. You probably would like to spend more time up here but unfortunately there is no seating unless you go into the café bar but this closed when the rain started to come in and they wouldn't let us in, we were directed to an interior bar but seating here was very limited so we had to stand for quite awhile until the rain stopped and we could escape. The actual building and shopping malls are beautiful and you could spend quite awhile in here."
,,You on a high when you walk here,5.0,,"Man made and just plain impressive. That is the best way to sum up the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. With a pool that resembles a beach deck, restaurants, bars and viewing decks, this will take you to another level."
,,You feel like your floating on air,5.0,,Fabulous views from on top of the world! A great concept and a 'must see' item to any trip to Singapore.
,,Very impressive building,5.0,,This is a must to visit at night. The lights make it very special and the height is amazing! Great to go here after visiting the Gardens by the Bay at night and within a easy walk.
,,Mind boggling architecture at a dizzy height,5.0,,"From the ground this is a really startling and unique building, standing as it does on reclaimed land close to the Garden Bay Area. The three towers stand separately but joined at the 56th floor by what appears to be a ship which straddles across all three. Reach this attraction by a lift which ascends at astonishing speed. Unfortunately you have to negotiate the mandatory photograph by the in-house team who will present it to you by the time you get to the 56th floor for SD$30. We didn't take up the offer!
The view for the platform is breath-taking, much like the Empire State Building. However you do get a true feel for the investment that has been put in to this end of the island. Combine the sky park with a visit to the gardens across the road and don't miss out on the Marina Barrage as well!"
,,Crowded but nice view,4.0,,Crowded! But it is worth coming up for a photo. They only open up the pool for hotel guests. There is also a bar and a restaurant at the top. The rooftop opens up to both side of the hotel - view of the city and view of the ocean and harbor.
,,What's all the fuss about?,3.0,,"It's a pool and gardens on a roof of a building. Good views, especially at night, but really didn't excite me."
,,If you're not a resident forget it...,2.0,,"We were really looking forward to a visit to the Skypark, but after a long walk in the blistering sun we were disappointed that visitors could only view the pool and not bathe in it. You could get a drink but that was it, a lot of money with very little reward other than the views."
,,Vertigo-inducing,4.0,,"Paid S$23 for a vertigo-inducing experience. On the way up your picture will be taken and for S$35 have it printed and framed with the picture of the hotel as your background. A little scary at the top if you stay close to the railing, and winds are stronger. There is a bar where you can shake off the giddiness but the drinks are expensive."
,,Perfect!,4.0,,"A chilled beer at Ku De Ta club, next to the famous infinity pool with an awesome view of the city and sea. We couldn't ask for more. People are friendly and attentive, though they should smile more. They should also ask if patrons wants additional orders or drinks."
,,Fantastic pool,5.0,,Well worth a visit. The infinity pool view is spectacular with poolside service that makes spending time anywhere else very difficult.
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Friends have recommended this to us. Quite excited but when we got to the top I was disappointed. Yes, we saw the views but it was not something that would take our breath away. As such, we felt that what we paid for the experience is not worth it."
,,A little too over rated though still a good experience,3.0,,"I would opt for the Singapore Flyer if you want to have a view of the city. The sky park got too many people and it's noisy so i didn't enjoy the view. However, i can just imagine that with less people, the place can be quite nice."
,,I wouldn't have gone up to 56th floor if I knew what my epxerience turned out to be,1.0,,"The skypark views at night time is what you've seen on every website. So I won't give a clueless comment on whether the views are great or not--it's definately great. there is no doubt about it.

BUT!! just so you know, so as Hongkong, New York City, Maccau, Auckland and many other cities around the world have more outstanding view points/standing decks. If you have ever visited those other big metropolitan cities then I think you'll be disappointed at Marina Skypark. I do NOT recommend anyone to pay twenty-something dollars in Singapore just to go up to 56th or 57th floor to plainly see the view.

is it WORTH the money? we paid $23 or $26 in between range of money per person for an entrance to the Skypark WITHOUT having an access to observe Infinity swimming pool and WITHOUT get into the restaurant/bar. I definately knew from the first that I had to make a reservation to get into the Skypark bar but the woman standing in front of the bar was very rude when I asked her a couple of questions. There's simply a deck crowded by a slew of people taking pictrues, sitting on the ege of corner. Well, NYC is same as well regarding this matter (actually way more crowded than here)

But still, unless you are staying at Marina Bay Sands Hotel or having a dinner at the Skypark bar(which was extremely windy for outdoor setting) THINK TWICE beore you purchace the ticket.

Rude staffs standing in the in front of Skypark bar and Infinity pool are not options."
,,Poor customer service,1.0,,"This hotel is absolutely disgusting. They think they're one of the best in the world yet do not know essence if customer service. They must send their employees back to school. Not a single person in the concierge offered us help as we are checking and and out. Their rooms are cramped up, with joy enough sockets to plug our gadgets. Extremely over prices for their kind of service ."
,,Just a great view,3.0,,"I've stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so I know what's on top. This time we stayed in another hotel but wanted to show the skypark. I was surprised for that you're only allowed on the tip of the deck. Magnificent view but to see the pool is also a wonder. But I suppose they want privacy for their guests. So after a few minutes of picture taking, taking in the view, there's nothing else to do."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,For those of you who do not mind heights a great view of the whole city can be seen from the top of Marina Bay Sands Skypark but ensure you have a clear day to make your visit more memorable
,,A Great Place to View the City,5.0,,"This location...on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel...was the best place to view the city. It overlooks most everything in the city. I believe, for tourists, it is the most visited place in the city. You can get a ticket to go to the top for $22 Singapore dollars or got to the first tower in the hotel and go to the bar on top. The bar overlooks the Skypark area. There is no charge for this elevator to the bar."
,,Spectaculor,5.0,,An amazing building with an even more amazing view day or night. This has to be definately included in your Singapore experience!
,,Exciting Moment at Marina Sands Sky Park,5.0,,A beautiful scenery overlooking the whole city of Singapore. Its something that you are hoping to return someday to see it all over again.
,,Skip the queues and take the lift to the bar instead,5.0,,"This is a must-see attraction in Singapore. The view is spectacular, but go during sunset or later.

TIP: skip the queues and fee and take the lift to the bar instead. This lift will take you to the bar where you have the same view but are able to spend the 20dollars on a drink instead. You will get the benefit of the view + you will be able to enjoy a drink for the same price as the viewing ticket alone!
After you finish you can then go down from the bar to the viewing platform anyway.

TIP no.2: There is a long queue to go down so simply take the bar lift down too. Or else go 1 floor up above the queue and access the lift there. It will stop for the people in the queue but you will not have to wait :-)"
,,A must visit.,5.0,,"A spacious viewing deck on the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Note: this does not have access to the infinity pool area but does offer a nice view of Singapore's major tourist points. In the evening, one can have cocktails on the deck. Nice visit."
,,"Great view, and must see in Singapore",5.0,,"This is an engineering marvel. I must admit I was a bit skiddish as crept toward the edge of the viewing platform. but the views were well worth it. I wish I had been there on a clear day, but a bad day at a Sands is better than a good day at work anytime!!"
,,High Five,5.0,,Located on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel this Skypark offers spectacular views of the central business district of singapore and the singapore flyer. This houses a pool but only for in house guests. There are nice coffee shops located here for a sip high in the sky!
,,"Just OK,, for the View, 57 floors UP!",3.0,,"Not like in the post card,,,23 dollars each to go up the elevator,,,
then,, not much to do but try to get a few pics..the Restaurant is way too pricey ...so,, just for the View? they take your pic, and charge 30 dollars without the cover,,"
,,You cannot miss...,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, this is something you cannot miss.... from the deck you can have a breath taking view of Singapore ... A must go!!"
,,Pricey with Great Views,3.0,,"We visited the Skypark even though we felt it was overpriced. We took the elevator up and enjoyed overlooking the beautiful city. We did it once but for the price, we will not be doing it again. You do not get access to the pool area with admission"
,,Spectacular well worth paying for,5.0,,"What a view, stunning, brilliant viewing area overlooking Marina Bay and Singapore. Definitely well worth visiting the skydeck, another of Singapore's stunning treats for the visitor."
,,Brilliant aerial views over the bay and the city,5.0,,"Although we were told it was just a viewing point- there was a large area to walk round with plans explaining what you were looking at. I thought it was very exciting to be able to see all around and get to understand the waterways, bridges, gardens. And the views over the gigantic sky scrapers on the city side was pretty impressive. There is a restaurant and shops up there and way down below is a shopping mall. Nearby you can take a riverboat to Clarke Quay. Altogether very worthwhile ."
,,excellent view of a night,4.0,,"Went at night to see the views, views were excellent over the city and surrounding areas. Is quite costly ($80+) per family of four to get to top. Only guests can see or swim in the pool. Has a restaurant but very busy and you may need to book. Beer very expensive (plastic schooner cup) $13 but again you have to pay that in Singapore as it is overpriced in general. Only a $10-$12 cab fare from the Quay area."
,,Cool Structure,5.0,,"I love this place, even though I hate heights. We had a lovely walk from the Marina Mall to Gardens by the Gay through this skypark. If the weather was a bit cooler in Singapore, it would have been a nice place to hang around here and get some sun. Nevertheless, a walk in the evening is a relaxing one. You get to wander around the gardens and look up at the high rise Marina Sands Hotel, and have a good view of the bay and the wide view of Gardens By the Bay."
,,amazing building and view,5.0,,"it's a must see, even if obviously full of tourists. the building is just amazing, you see that there's no limit in regards of size and place. the view is great and all sides. The pool (on 57th floor, roof top) must just be amazing (we've been there in the evening, people still were sitting in the pool enjoying the view over Singapore). OK; beer's a bit expensive, but it's anyhow worth!"
,,"Must go there, but..",4.0,,"Probably they are 100% professionals, there is no doubt, but you will feel the "" industrial smell"" ...my opinion, better to visit than to stay there in case you need relax in the hotel."
,,Great views from the top,5.0,,We visited this on a cloudy day but still had great views from the top of the Helix Bridge. Interesting to learn all about it too. Cafes and even a pool right on the top. An interesting structure to say the least and worth a visit up 56 storeys to the top.
,,Expensive,3.0,,Expensive! No chairs or shade provided and no sitting on the deck allowed. Amazing views but would have been great to have some chairs and table provided with reasonably priced drinks. Optional audio commentary would have been great!
,,Amazing. Simply Amazing.,5.0,,"I didn't even use the pool, just the bar and the views - but it was amazing, a real 'do not miss this ever' sort of thing."
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"Visited for birthday drinks before dinner at Pollen.
Pouring with rain when we arrived so couldn't go outside at first. Terrific views of city and infinity pool of the hotel. When rain stopped, nabbed a table outside. However, still got wet, mainly by the splashing of the overflowing roof! Maybe management should extend roof or put in better guttering!
Top location though and well worth a visit for the views."
,,Great for views of the city,3.0,,"Take the
Fits at the far end of MBS hotel up to the skypark for great views of Singapore. You can go up for free ( though not always at the weekend, or later in the evenings, when you need a reservation at ku de te"
,,$22 for adults...too bad...price has increased :(,5.0,,"i remember it used to be $20...surely the management DOES NOT NEED to charge us $2 more in 2014...anyway, I know this place is gorgeous looking from the ground up, but once you're up there, its a view that does take your breath away but pls remember...if there is rain or lighting, this place closes, so do check the WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND!"
,,Good view,3.0,,"I'm not very happy now that I have read other peoples reviews. Got sucked into paying $20 each, for a ride in the elevator and a walk around the end of the boat! Didn't see the pool or the shops! Rip off."
,,Special views and fab shopping,4.0,,"Shopping canter sells everything u could possibly want but going up in the elevator to the sky bar is fab to sit with a cheeky vino and watch the sun set, even take a dip in the infinity pool"
,,Overhyped viewing tower!,3.0,,"When we saw pictures of the Marina Bay sands, or even the three towers in full view as we approached it, the anticipation was great. Expectation was to walk along the whole three towers, go around viewing the city. The grandness of the lobby, all built that expectation.

When we got up there, first of all the access is to a tiny part of the whole tower, a simple terrace, no facilities, not even rest rooms. We did not see the pool, only view was of a bar with people standing packed like sardines, and the skyline on the other-side. So you don't get the whole experience. The towers themselves are far away from the city, so we did not get that great anticipated skyline experience.

The worst part, at 10 PM, a set of rude guards showed up and herded everyone off the terrace, not at all reflective of the Singapore or Asian hospitality."
,,Head for Heights,4.0,,"If you go by MRT make sure you get off at the correct station - not Marina Bay! Don't follow the signs from the shopping centre - they do not make sense! We went up and down and round and round, inside and out! Go through the hotel lobby.The view is outstanding and the gardens fantastic. Say you are going to the bar because there is no entry charge but you can have a drink or tea for about $10 or less whereas there is an entry fee for the observation deck and the view is just as good! The food is OK too. Check the dress code for time of day of visit. We had to try 3 times because we were too late/ had wrong clothes etc."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,It was a great experience being on top of the hotel and watching tourists enjoy themselves. The sight of the infinity pool was breathtaking. The restaurants and clubs are a must visit.
,,Great View!,5.0,,"We wanted to see the great view for $23. Singapore dollars. Lucky it was a clear day. Had a Singapore Sling in the bar. Could see Gardens by the Bay and, harbour. A fun thing to do, as we weren't staying at the hotel."
,,Must Do In Singapore,4.0,,"$23 Singapore dollars per adult, if not a hotel guest, is not cheap for really just a view; but it is a great view. The specific lifts needed are at the northern side of the whole complex and they are downstairs on elevel from the street. No seats up top and security will move you on up there if you dare to sit down. Best view is probably late in the day but the typical haze that encompasses most of asia most of the time these days, means that there were no spectacular clouds or magical sunset shots on my visit. Surprisingly lots of open-ness between the edge barrier wires for photo opps and yes there are also some fully glassed in perimeter panels. I do not think that tripods are allowed.
Well worth 30-60 minutes, particularly late in the day. It was quite crowded on our visit at this time."
,,Go for the cheese & chocolate buffet with stunning views!,5.0,,"We really wanted to go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands but wanted to take our time and enjoy the views. After hunting around on the website a bit I found that they have a cheese and chocolate buffet. You get an outdoor table for the evening, with as much cheese and chocolate as you can consume! Hot chocolate, tea and water are also included. The selection of food is fabulous and you have the makings of a very memorable night with those spectacular views."
,,Great views!,4.0,,"Worth entry fee SG$20 but only if it's a clear day. You get fantastic views of the city, the Gardens by the Bay and the harbour. Visited with my wife and daughter and had cocktails in the bar. This let us chill for an hour with superb views, helping justify the entry fee (for non hotel guests)"
,,Great views,4.0,,"After viewing the outside of this hotel from the lovely Gardens by the Bay, we wanted to visit the Skypark for the view down. You will not be disappointed by the views, but it is quite difficult to take photos due to the high glass walls and you are so high up, it can be a little misty. Be aware you have access only to the 'deck area'- not the whole of the Skypark and swimming pool, as this is reserved for hotel guests only. Take a stroll through the hotel atrium first- well worth a look, though the bars looked a little pricey."
,,Nice view!,4.0,,Don't really think that it's worth $20 going up there. But the views were great. It was a shame that it was drizzling when we went up so our short stay was not as pleasant as expected.
,,Great View of Singapore,4.0,,"Nice. Good experience. Non hotel guests like myself are charged SGD20 to go up there and enjoy the views. What I didn't like was to see local people bringing their ""lunch boxes"" and occupying all corners to sit down and eat their home-brought-foods. This is generally not allowed at other such places overseas! That was disappointing and That is why we decided to go up to KuDeTa. That was enjoyable."
,,great views of the marina,4.0,,some fantastic views of all around the bay area!! the maps could have more detail and be in english also!
,,Swimming with the gods!,5.0,,To come up on this roof and walk down in the pool is a special experience. Even if there is a lot of people it feels like a cool place.
,,"Amazing views at night, and a smallish lightshow",5.0,,Entry is free if you are a guest at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Don't know the charge otherwise. Nice to look down on everything but you could see as much without going up if you have to pay.
,,Best Viewing Spot in Singapore,5.0,,Amazing to look down from the glass walled sides of the Skypark. Some people stayed away from the edges and still enjoyed the city scenery. Do not forget your camera. Well worth the entrance fee.
,,Even drenched it was a great view,4.0,,"The view here is amazing! To look out over Singapore was a special way to spend an evening. We headed up just as the sun was setting so got to see the sunlight fade and the nightlife start. Especially cool when looking out over the harbour.

The title of this review comes from the fact that it started raining whilst we were up there. Not a gentle tropical rain that last a moment and then is gone but a proper, full on storm and we got drenched! It was so wet that my mascara ran, my dress clung to me and my hair was dripping (and we'd dressed up to go out for a fancy dinner). Still it was gorgeous and quite a unique experience to get that wet up there."
,,Stunning view,5.0,,From the 57th Level you can really see this beautiful city & at night you can also see the laser light show which is really impressive. As for the swimming pool unless you are the hotel guest otherwise you are not allow to swim inside the pool. But anyway it is still worth the visit.
,,Better than singapore flyer,5.0,,We did both marina bay sky deck and singapore flyer. Definitely better than singapore flyer for anyone looking for photos. Also worth checking out restaurants as its cheaper and u can enjoy the view for longer.
,,Must See when in Town,5.0,,"Not only for the landmark architectural design, but also for the unparalleled views over the city, this should be a fixed point on any itinary in SIN.

I would not bother with the Ku De Ta Spin Off on the top, which is not worth a stop unless maybe for a deficated romantic dinner, but then again there are better places for that as well.

The space itself and the views however are truly amazing and the picture landmark maps make it easy to identify the other important sights and buildings of the city.

Highly recommended !"
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,It was such a pleasant stroll at the skygarden. Those in the swimming pools can pretend they are almost falling out of the edge due to the special design. Good photo taking opportunities from the tallest building in the Marina bay sands area! Capture the beautiful city from the top!
,,Views to take your breath away,5.0,,"This is a must be seen attraction when visiting Singapore, the view point at the top of the sands is something that will take your breath away and you can also have something to eat at the same time making this a very special occasion if you so wished . The sands to a laser light show every evening across the whole of the marina, with water features as well as music being part of the performance . This is something of a spectacular experience that should not be missed and very reasonable cost to get to the view point."
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"Celebrated New Year's Eve at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. As soon as we stepped out on the deck, it was windy and exhilarating! The view was amazing! And watching the fireworks from the 57th level was such a treat. Instead of looking up at the fireworks, we found ourselves looking down at them."
,,"Expensive but a ""must"" in Singapore",4.0,,"Paid Sin$20 to get up which isnt too bad, and its worth paying just to see the spectacular view at the top. But a pint of beer cost me Sin$20 which is quite allot!"
,,Wow..!!,5.0,,What a view? If you manage to pick a clear day you'll be so impressed you wont want to leave. Ku Da Te is expensive for a drink though - but SIN$44 for one glass of champagne could take the edge of the view
,,"Expensive, but amazing views",4.0,,"Entry to the skypark is quite expensive, but the views are unique. Drinks at the rooftop bar are also very expensive, and the strong winds and loud music makes it difficult to stay for long periods."
,,Fantastic view over Singapore,4.0,,Definitely worth a visit just for the view from both sides. Drinks at the bar are not cheap though but worth it for the setting.
,,Wonderful view,4.0,,"As all skyparks or tall buildings in the world, Marina Bay Sands Skypark offer a 360degree breathtaking view of Singapore's well-litted and mesmerizing skyline. Singapore definitely has a skyline unlike others as the landscape is very beautifully sculpted. I would recommend a stay at MBS in order to get a complimentary ticket up to the Skypark. If not paying $20 per head does seem a little hefty!"
,,Go to Ku De Ta for a drink,5.0,,"Cheaper than paying to go to the Sky-park, take the same lift and look at the city from a fabulous angle. Watch people swimming in the infinity pool without paying the price of admission!,"
,,Magnificent!,5.0,,"The architecture is magnificent! one hell of a distinct structure of strength and uniqueness that is becoming so famous that if Merlion could only speak up and complain, you can't replace me! It is rapidly becoming iconic as Singapore's newest landmark lording it over noted structures nearby such as the Esplanade,Art/Science Museum, Gardens by the Bay, the Singapore Flyer and SGs skyscrapers. The price is quite high going up there. We preferred the night view to compliment the sky Bar if you wish to stay for a while. And don't forget to drop by the souvenir shop. I have not noticed any telescope. Signature shops will welcome you when you decide to go down."
,,What a great view,5.0,,The entrance fee is quite high but the view is worth it. A great place to start your visit of Singapore.
,,"Nice view from up there, well organized",5.0,,"Not too expensive to get up there, no long waiting lines although finding a place that actually sells tickets is not too easy. Nice view of the city and the sea and ships, definitely worth the entrance fee. Apparently guests of the Bar up there do not have to pay the entrance fee, I am not sure about the prices of the drinks though, I would expect them to be expensive to make up for the entrance. We did not go to the Bar but paid the entrance fee instead."
,,Extroadinary,5.0,,"This is well worth the effort, go for a drink at the bar. Cant get on to the bow, but can get the full impression anyway. Surprised me it wasnt as expensive as I thought it would be"
,,Great!,5.0,,"The dazzling view from the Skypark on the Singapore skyline is amazing. Don't pay 20S$ for a tour but go for a drink, the coctails are delicious though not very cheap. During the day you can also go to the lounge bar and see, almost touch, the infinity pool."
,,The Best View of Singapore,4.0,,"This is quite an amazing hotel both on the inside and the outside. For those not staying at the hotel, it is possible to go to the top of the ship. I paid the $20.00 for the elevator ride to the ""bow"" of the ship. This gives a great view of the city, the harbour, the gardens, the floating soccer field, up not knowing about the bar option. It makes one appreciate the shipping that enters and exits Singapore. I did not know about the bar option for getting to the roof, so look at other reviews to se if that is a better option for you. The hotel and Skypark is also easier to access by foot than the Singapore Flyer and goes higher above the city."
,,Not for Vertigo sufferers!,4.0,,Great views over Singapore! For those staying at the Sands Hotel you can enjoy the infinity pool at the top of the hotel
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,"We enjoyed the view from here. Do go to the chill out bar next to the platform for drinks, that way you don't have to pay for the platform and you'll have the same incredible view. A stylish place for a couple of drinks above the rooftops of Singapore!"
,,Great View with limited access,4.0,,"You have two options. Either go for the tour and pay S-Dollar 20.00 per person or go up to the bar and have a drink for approx. S-Dollar 25.00 per person. We chose option two. While having a drink we could enjoy the view over Singapore and get a glimps on the roof pool. The bar section is not very huge, but is totally enough to grab and breathe in the scenery."
,,UFC Singapore Fight,5.0,,Here for the UFC & what an excellent experience it has been. Very excellent service & food. Very internationally friendly.
,,A rip off,1.0,,"The visit up to the 56th floor of the marina bay sands sky park is one of the biggest rip offs
You pay 23 dollars usd, you take an elevator up, walk around for 150 feet, you look at the city for about a minute and a half, you turn around and go back to the elevator and go down again.
You are basically paying 23 dollars to ride an elevator for a smoggy limited view."
,,Not a bad experience,3.0,,"Not a bad experience to view Marina Bay from high up. Costs $20 per person, do get a bit windy up there and you can feel the building do tend to move. Photos before the ride is taken from ground floor can be picked up for $50."
,,Spectaluar,5.0,,This is the best view in Singapore. It cost us $26 each but was well worth it for the photo opportunity. A definite must see.
,,Stunning sunset,5.0,,"Maybe not reasonalbe to pay that much just for watching a sunset, however it was definitely worth going up, it's just a view I'll never forget. If you can, go in the evening and enjoy =)"
,,This place will live inside you forever,5.0,,The Skypark on 57 floor is unforgetable experience. The day view is a calming retreat with resort feel. At night it transforms itself into spectacular view where the sky is the limit of endless lights of Singapore. I could not leave the place. It was magnetic.
,,Breath taking,5.0,,Although I didn't stay at the marina bay sands I did go to Ku TeDah right on the very top. . It's worth a visit to see the breath taking views . Stay for a drink or a meal either inside the restaurant or out on the deck. . Unfortunately you can't go poolside but can see the pool by walking around. . There is no need to pay $25 for tour . It's a must do in Singapore. Then head down to the shops . Most of the designer brands are here . Stroll through the hotel lobby . One of my best spent afternoon in Singapore
,,Takes your breath away,4.0,,"For 20$, it was a truly breathtaking view from above. It was slightly drizzling but didn't ruin our experience. Could see everything, and makes me motivated to go to the Gardens By the Bay later in my trip!
Protip - don't wear a skirt up here. My cousin found that out to her detriment..."
,,Just so so,4.0,,It is SGD23 for each adult with fast elevator. It's only opened part of the roof. We went there in the morning so not so many beautiful views could been seen. But it's good to have a overlook at Singapore.
,,Great view,4.0,,"The ride up was fast and smooth, the deck itself was well done, felt safe, and provided an amazing view of Singapore.

As it was raining, lightly, some of the eye height glass panels were difficult to see through, but, the deck had a combination of wire safety rails and glass, so you only had to move to a wire section to have a fairly uninterrupted view.

Great experience"

,,TotallyAmazing!,5.0,,"This place is indescribable one just has to see it and experience it for themselves to believe it. The views are spectacular. Warning, the water is freezing though, so bring your towel, slippers and robe."
,,marina Bay sand,4.0,,Like ...very nice & peaceful garden...a garden in the city very well build ...the lake is beutiful & serounded by Marina sand casino..semilar to the casino in Macau
,,Good - Must go for first timers,4.0,,"The place looks really good, I heard from couple of my friends that you have to pay to visit it, but fortunately I did not have to bump into something like that. The bar is expensive but the view is awesome, I believe if you are not staying in the hotel then going once definitely makes sense. The place is not for somebody who has already visited high rise buildings and taken a view, but yes if you want to come back and say that you visited the most famous tourist attraction, then goooo and irrespective - the view in night is really amazing. Once on top you can stay there for as long as you want, just chill and enjoy at the bar."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"The Skypark was only $5sgd to go up and along there, which is pretty good! The domes are expensive to enter, especially considering foreigners can only pay for 2 dome entries, not just 1 like the Singaporean people can.

Anyway, the Cloud Forest dome is WELL WORTH a look! :)"
,,Gorgeous Views,4.0,,"The hotel has I believe 53 floors. For around $25 you go to the top and see the skyline of Singapore. Although the city at night is amazing lite up, it's a gamble because if the clouds that rolls in some times. I believe there is a grill and bar up at the top with of course a souvenir store. Bring your swim trunks if you want to take a dip in the pool up on the rooftop."
,,Nice park but very expensive to visit,3.0,,"The place looks really cool, but you have to pay to look. I decided to opt for a drink at the bar instead (which has a great view). No matter how you slice it, it is going to cost $50 dollars to see the view."
,,Great views,4.0,,"I was told by some guests that they had to pay to go to the top? I'm not sure as we did not pay... .. if we were asked to pay, we would be quite upset. Great views and great place for visitors or to bring guests to enjoy a tipple/"
,,Nice but not worth the money,3.0,,"There are two ways how you can get there:
1) You can tell the security guys you are going to the bar and you can get there for free. You can have a nice view from the bar, even if you cant step on the deck.

2) You can spend 20 dollars per person to get to the deck and walk there as long as you want. But do not expect that you can see 360 degree view and the infinite pool. The pool is just for the hotel guests (I can understand it). Views are beautiful but if you stay in one of the high hotels, for example Stamford, you can see beautiful views too for free.

It is something I would not do again, as I did not find anything amazing about it."
,,Very unique shape for a hotel building !,5.0,,We only saw the Marina Sands Hotel from a distance.It is certainly unique.We have never seen such a building.We never went to the roof of this hotel but we would love to.
,,Remarkable,5.0,,The engineering and architectural design of this building is totally remarkable. A visit to the viewing deck is an absolute must. Drinks expensive.
,,Must do,4.0,,"Whilst not cheap, it's a spectacular way to get a different viewpoint of Singapore. Whether watching the ships at anchor, looking over the city or peering over the neighbour's fence toward Malaysia it is well worth the money."
,,Very disappointed - limited access,3.0,,"No doubt about it, view is great, though no better than other vantage points such as the New Asia Bar at the Swissotel Stamford which is free access. Was only able to access about a quarter of the top deck - rest reserved for guests. They really didn't want to allow us space to have a drink - more concerned about setting up for dinner... Well, we've crossed it off the list and won't be going up there again."
,,Great views better than Singapore Flyer,4.0,,Cost $20 to go up to observation deck (front part of boat shape). Fabulous views. Drinks very expensive up there so buy before heading up. I thought was more worth doing than the Flyer.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Brilliant view of the Singapore skyline, but a shame its really only a 270 degree view. Well worth the SND20 entry fee for the basic viewing."
,,Observation Deck 56 stories up!,5.0,,"Great views of the city and explanation boards of what you are viewing are scattered around in English.

There is a stand up only kiosk that has food and drink.

The cost is $20 Singapore $ for an adult and $17 Singapore $ for Senior Citizens.

Tickets are good for the hours of 9:30 am - 11 pm so you could take a look during the day and go back in the evening for another look and see the city lights.

The 57th floor is only for hotel guests and there is a swimming pool on the 57th floor and a restaurant!"
,,Marina Bay Skypark,5.0,,A short visit turned out to be a long visit just looking around knowing in Simgapore that you & your family a safe . you are able to relax and enjoy your stay hassel free
,,Unique view and building,5.0,,"If you can get to see the pool side of this amazing architecture, you will just want to sit down and soak in the view!!

It is so high up and the deep blue huge pool seems to just float effortlessly amongst the clouds. One side you have the sea view and the other side is the modern city of Singapore

Have a drink or a meal there."
,,Great by night,3.0,,"$20 to get up but it's only 1/3 of the top but the area which you can see is stunning especially just after sunset. I was disappointed at the lack of staff assisting. Everyone was sitting against the glass to get a decent photo was hard but theirs no where to sit and enjoy.
I was lucky to get so,e great shots but could miss it to be honest for the price and experience up top.
Souvenirs very cheep plastic, thought such a place would have something but more special"
,,GREAT VIEWS - A MUST DO,5.0,,Basically 3 hotel towers with a boat structure on top -- you can get the lift to the top - can remember price but quite reasonable --- looks fabulous & offers fantastic views across Singapore. Highly recommended!
,,FABULOUS - DONT MISS IT,5.0,,Marina Bat hotel Sands a must see in Singapore!! Basically 3 hotel towers with a 'boat like' structure across the top -- you can get to the top & have the best views of Singapore -- can see for miles! A 'must do'!!!
,,Beer with a view!,5.0,,"Yes at S$20 per head to go up to the viewing deck, it is a bit pricey - but if you pay with AMEX you get $5 off - which will go towards the cost of a pint of Stella at S$20! But this is Singapore, and it is still well worth it!
We were told when buying our tickets that you can get a drink at the kiosk, but can't sit down, and the restaurant/bar area is only if you have a reservation, but once we were up there and had taken hundreds of photos of the beautiful skyline of the central business district, marina, gardens etc... we just strolled into the bar and enjoyed aforementioned Stella whilst feeling we were on top of the world. We had been planning on visiting the Flyer (Wheel) but it seemed so low down in comparison we did not bother. So if you enjoy heights and want to be on top of the most unique looking building, this is well worth the visit."
,,WOW Factor,5.0,,We went there after friends recommending it and it's all worth it. Couldn't get enough photos and we're still looking at them 6 months later. The view was spectacular and will definitely recommend it again and again.
,,Go up to KuDeTa instead!,3.0,,"Went to visit the skypark, was told it was $20 entry per adult and that i could not bring an umbrella up, even though it was raining heavily. We decided to go up to KuDeTa instead. Visited the concierge and was sent to the elevator... Free entry, with no obligation to buy anything before 9pm. View is phenomenal, the same as what you would see by visiting skypark! With less of the touristy-cameras-in-your-face kind of thing. I say save your money and make a night at kdt instead!"
,,Tricks to See for Free!,5.0,,"Aside from staying at the Marina Bay Sands - which we did luckily - there is a viewing platform on level 56 - this is what people pay for - however if you buy a drink at the various bars and restaurants on 57 you get the whole view and the infinity pool is quite a feature - you can see from both sides of the sky park - which extends along all three towers - several of the bars/cafes/restaurants charge less for drinks than Ku Da Ta - and day & night the views are spectacular we enjoyed the span from before sunset, during and then afterwards when the light & laser show come on which is fun but because you are so far above it some think the show not that dramatic. ALso fine for disabled! Marina Bay Sands is 110% disabled friendly with ramps all over the skypark hotel, and shopping/casino complex in the lower level. Be careful buying drinks near the cake shop at the bottom - my friend got caught paying $25 for 2 mineral waters ( italian ones!) Other than that we also decided wse do not need to go to the flyer because the skypark is well above the flyer - so that saves $$ too!"
,,Love it,4.0,,This is a wonderful addition to Singapore and great to visit and photograph. We went over as a storm was rolling in and the clouds were amazing. Take the time and visit
,,Best View in Town,5.0,,"This is the only way to get a good view of Singapore marina, bay area, Gardens by the Sea and business district. For the few dollars it costs it can not be out done. Make certain your camera is charged because you will be snapping wildly. The directions on the plaques are great. Make certain you have a hat and sunburn cream. Do this early in your trip and you will have a good idea of where things are and what you should go to see. The atrium in the resort is beyond belief."
,,A CREATIVE AND UNIQE ARCHITECTURE,5.0,,"Enjoying a sky view from the top of a tower or a high building is always a fun ,but indeed this is not the real value of this place;It is actually the genius and extremely creative and unique architectural design of having such a lovely boat extending so elegantly over the three towers. It is unmatched allover the world,so it deserved to be the icon of singapore instead of that stupid merlion statue laying humbly at the feet of this magnificent building.Before going up enjoy your eyes first at a suitable distance away enough to catch the whole scene.Ticket office is in tower 3 for 20 S$
The observatory is only the front part of the sky park,there is also a nice bar and restaurant.From there you can also see the rest of the skypark which has a swimming pool but is inclusive to the hotel guests."
,,Will never get sick of this view.,5.0,,"Welcome to ""selfy central"", and you'd be silly not to follow suit. When you get up to the Skypark, everyone is catered to. You have the amazing infinity pool which has sections for adults, families with young children & everything in between. Lots of spas on the other side which share a view across Gardens By The Bay and the South China Sea. If you're staying at the hotel & have secured ""Club Level"" then you're going to enjoy the dining benefits up at Sky Park too. Ku De Ta lounge & restaurant are also up there and beautiful to visit. Advice, if you plan on having brunch at Ku De Ta on the weekend, book well in advance. Very, very happy we chose to stay at Marina Bay Sands, because the Sky Park is a most beautiful place to be."
,,The view of Singapore,4.0,,This is a must - no other way to get a view of Singapore and its skyline. We had lunch at Ku De Ta - great food and great view. A bit expensive to eat - but the view is worth it.
,,worth seeing,4.0,,"you don't get to see the whole roof, just one small section, but amazing views. from up there and they serve beer."
,,breath taking!,5.0,,"The view is breathtaking. Towels are provided. There is a bar and a fine dining restaurant.
the views are a lot of fun!
The Skypark has fast become a symbol of Singapore and with good reason, so relaxing and enjoyable gazing out onto the city then jumping in the spas facing the bay itself. Needs to be done!

Try the top balcony at night time, breath taking view"
,,Check out if you're close by,4.0,,"Long line, and sort of expensive. But I'd probably recommend it if you're clsoe by, because the views are a lot of fun."
,,Spetacular view,5.0,,Rooms have to be booked in order to go to the skypark. The view is breathtaking. Towels are provided. There is a bar and a fine dining restaurant.
,,What a place !,4.0,,The incredible structure sets the scene for when you enter this amazing place - who cares about the casino - the shops and the views from the 57th floor are fantastic !
,,Not so good if you aren't a hotel guest,3.0,,"We were visiting Marina Bay Sands, and as we were not hotel guests we had to pay S$20 each and could only visit the observation deck. It turns out only hotel guests can access the entire Skypark. The view from the deck was fine, but it was hardly value for money. What was good, however, was having lunch at the Ku De Ta restaurant that was also up there. I also think that if you went to the restaurant directly, you don't have to pay the $20 lift fee."
,,fantastic views,4.0,,brilliant views out over singapore / marina bay. great photo opportunities and a nice pool with Jacuzzi's. it is worth doing while you are in the area.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Stayed just one night in December 2013 and we were looked after so well from the bell boy to the reception staff , our standard room was fantastic with a great view of the sea and the roof top swimming pool busy but awesome lunch in the resto was also very nice , not the cheapest place to Stay in Singa's but I would say the best and worth paying the extra for that special time ."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"If there is one thing worth doing head up here and make sure you get in the pool. The Skypark has fast become a symbol of Singapore and with good reason, so relaxing and enjoyable gazing out onto the city then jumping in the spas facing the bay itself. Needs to be done!"
,,Sensational Sky Park,5.0,,Enjoyed a fabulous cocktail whilst overlooking the amazing Singapore skyline from this luxury bar on top of the world. Great drinks menu and good measures allows you to slowly sip and enjoy a magnificent view out over the whole area. A must do whilst visiting. Highly recommended
,,spectacular views,5.0,,this is a must do if in Singapore. a wonderful view which goes forever and easy to get to via the hop on hop off bus.
,,Good view,3.0,,I love the shape of the building. It's outstanding. Kudos to Las Vegas Sands team… well done! Shops are of good quality.
,,Worth to vist,5.0,,"Try the top balcony at night time, breath taking view... if you stay in the hotel you can also swim in the the top pool and enjoy a drink or two"
,,What a view!,5.0,,It cost 20 Singapore dollars to get up to the Skypark Observation deck but it was worth the view. There is a bar up there too that you can get a bit to eat. It's all a bit expensive but it's got to be a ''must do'' when in Singapore.
,,Outstanding views from sky view on 56th floor worth every penny,5.0,,After delightful morning in gardens by the bay we had sushi at ku de ta Japanese restaurant at top of marina bay sands hotel - truly the HIGHlight of our trip to Singapore
,,Superb,5.0,,This is the deck of the ship which is on the 40th floor of the hotel a must place to visit to have a view of the Marina bay in the night its looks amazing as the area is lit up. Must visit
,,Superb.....,5.0,,The best place i have ever visited hotel in a ship made on the top floor which is a swiming area and a dec for visitors to visit and have a veiw of Singapore which is lit up during the night. Its huge from within. Must place to visit.
,,Fabulous view,4.0,,"Very touristy, and had to wait in line and pay $20 per person for a very short event. However, the view is unbelievable and shouldn't be missed if you're in Singapore for the first time."
,,Spectacular views,3.0,,"Costs quite a bit but the views are spectacular. Ordinary punters are not allowed in the hotel area where the pool and restaurant are, so its more a viewing platform with a snack place. There are a lot of info points up there so you know what you are looking at. Access if on foot is through a very luxurious shopping centre and the packed hotel foyers. There is what now seems the customary photo call - they managed to sell ours to someone else!!!"
,,Stunning Sunset View in the Middle of City,5.0,,"Went to the observation and chilling around. It was amazing. Even its situated in the middle of busy city but once you step on the deck, the feeling switched to relax. You feel the soft wind on your face and suddenly you feel calm. The bar & resto is a must visit and they have the stunning infinity pool as well with the great view. The best thing is you can embrace the sunset view from here too. I can say your holiday in Singapore is incomplete without checking this amazing place."
,,Expensive for a partial view.,3.0,,"This iconic building is visible from the Marina Bay Area of Singapore. It is a spectacular building and really makes one wonder how they ever constructed it! The best photos will be taken from a bit of a distance away as it is so large.
You can pay $20 and go up to the top and get a good view of a lot of Singapore. However the viewing area is just from one end so you can't see everything. To get the best and whole view you obviously have to stay in the hotel and swim in the infinity pool! Personally I didn't think it was worth the money. It is after all just another big, expensive, busy 5 star hotel. The view of the building is definitely better from the surrounding area, such as from the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Great view of Singapore!,4.0,,"It was cloudy and raining a bit when we were there recently. So the view wasn't brilliant, but still good. You can see the wonderful architectures of buildings, bridges and other structures in the city-island-state. To get the best view, you need to either dine or buy a drink at KuDeTa bar. The quality of the food and drinks is nothing to boast about. You pay for the view, so the price is steep. The KuDeTa is a second location. Their first location in Bali has better food, I think. Great for first visit or for company party."
,,Nice swimming pool on edge,5.0,,"The night is still young when you get on to the Marina Bay Sand Skypark. Drinks cost expensive but the view up there is marvelous. Snap a view shots of the skyline. The skypark offers a swimming pool on the edge of the building, imagine a swim just ride on top of the mountain. Definitely worth coming here. Never come on a weekend. It is pretty crowded."
,,A unique view of the city,4.0,,"The Skypark is the boat shaped thing on top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. If you are not a guest of the hotel you can pay $20 ($17 seniors) to go only to the bow part of the Skypark. If you are going to the bar or restaurant, you will be given a pass which allows you into those venues. Neither allow entry to the massive pool area, although the bar has a view of the pool.

The views on either side are magnificent. On one side is the City and harbour (?) with the Merlion and on the other side is the Gardens by the Bay, the Flyer and the real harbor with lots of ships riding at anchor."
,,Not bad,4.0,,"I like the skypark as it really has a good scenery and some locations to eat, relax and unwind! Quite crowded though but worth the time!"
,,On Top of the world Ma!,5.0,,Cant remember the exact entry price around 20 Singapore dollars but so worth it you can stay up there fore ages and/or return until 11pm at night. Views are amazing.
,,Very good views of Singapore.,4.0,,The title sky park is a bit misleading as actually you only get access to a viewing area at one end of the park. The views are very good and at only 20 Singapore dollars it's good value. So worth it just for the views.
,,Nice view of the bay,4.0,,"If your staying at the hotel I think its free, if not make an afternoon of it and spend time at the pool, you'll get the same food and a greater view."
,,How the other half live!,5.0,,"I hate heights, and yet I felt really comfortable up there. It is a wide open space, so lots of room to move about. Awesome views of Singapore and I think well worth the $20 fee. And you can see the rooftop swimming pool area for the hotel - a glimpse of how the other half live! My only complaint (and I generally found this around all of Singapore) there was nowhere to actually sit and enjoy the view. Perhaps they don't want you haning about, or maybe they want you to wander into Ku De Ta to spend money in the bar!"
,,Fantastic hotel!,5.0,,"I really like this hotel! Singapore is not that big a place, & it's hot, so it's good to be able to stay in a hotel with plenty to do. As well as the hotel facilities, there's a 300 shop shopping centre attached. The MTR system is a short walk underground, & we went to visit Chinatown, etc via there.

My advice is to book well in advance, because I tried to make another trip to here last year, & the hotel was booked out 2 months in advance!"
,,Great View - Worth the Visit,4.0,,"This was my second visit and I was somewhat disappointed as access is now limited to one section of the observation deck. On my first trip in 2011, we had full access to view the infinity pool area, which was spectacular! Now the area is totally blocked off. Perhaps the reason is to give more privacy to the guests.

Still....$20 SGD isn't too much to enjoy the fantastic view provided. I recommend an umbrella if it's sunny as the area is unshaded."
,,Sunset skyline,4.0,,"The best time for going to the Skypark is during sunset. Especially beautiful to see the buildings turn on lights gradually while enjoying the sunset. It was interesting to spot all the different buildings in the Marina Bay area from the high angle.

Ticket price was $20
Security did not allow seating on the wooden floorboards
There was no shelter so bring a hat or umbrella"
,,wear a head gear!!,5.0,,"I was there last April 2013. I am Malaysian and it was my first time to Singapore. Since i am not familiar with Singapore, i used to think to go to MBBS i should stop at Marina Bay MRT but it is not to go MBBS you should stop at Bay Front. It was great experience to be on top of singapore BUT REMINDER it is very very hot up there so make sure you are wearing a head gear especially kids."
,,Skypark,4.0,,"Very nice afternoon, kids loved the skypark, we stayed at the hotel so we were lucky enough to see it from above in the evening."
,,A modern Icon of the Singapore Skyline,5.0,,"I stayed at the hotel so I was able to visit and swim at the sky park for free, so I cannot speak to the value quotient. However, the sight was definitely impressive, and I would recommend it."
,,Worth trying but not awesome,4.0,,"This iconic building cries to be seen and you feel obliged to go to the 56th floor but your basic price ticket ($20) takes you only to the viewing area, not the palm trees, which I found a bit disappointing. I believe other areas can be visited at extra cost, worth checking out before you go. I am glad I went, the view of Singapore is wonderful."
,,Amazing,5.0,,It is absolutely a must see when you are in Singapore. Beautiful scenery from the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel. I was impressed.
,,Just something you want to once in your life,3.0,,Probably something you would want to try once for the fun of it and its novelty but that's about it.
,,skypark,5.0,,"Don't miss out from this place, very nice and beautiful view. Bring your digital camera or zoom cannon camera, its take only 1/2 hour to view Singapore."
,,Great View and Pretty Building. That's about it,3.0,,I went here to check out the hotel and paid $20 to go up the look out point. It was way too hot at the look out point. Tips for those that are planning to go up the look out point. Do not pay $20 but go up the elevator at the Ku De Ta bar. This way you can buy a drink for $20 and enjoy the view for free. Husband and I made a mistake of paying $40 going up there and we still had to pay for drink because it was too hot.
,,A must,5.0,,"Skypark really worth a visit. The ticket is cheap compared to the view. Of course best view is sunbathing in swimsuit from inside the swimming pool but over there the access is limited to hotel tenants. Well the view is the same from Skypark but you are standing ....
Inside Marina Bay Sands offers every kind of shop, restaurant, entertainment, you could spend a week without going out!"
,,Sick view,5.0,,"I went up to the rooftop of this holt while on vacation and wow. I live in Dubai so have high standards for skyline and this is just as good as Dubai.

Of course hotel drinks are even more expensive than Dubai. And much of the roof is roped off for hotel guests.
As nice as this place was if you want a club experience with an even better view then consider one raffles place.
As"
,,Amazing!,4.0,,"The Skypark and pool area really are a feat of engineering and a fantastic place to view Singapore City as well as surrounding areas.

Drinks and food are expensive (as one would expect) and the towel service for hotel guests is below par (we asked the towel staff to mind our hotel robes whilst we had a quick swim as it was pouring with rain. They refused and said we needed to leave them on a 'sunbed' in the pouring rain, even though the place was empty thanks to the weather).

We also encountered a large number of Chinese visitors who seemed to lack basic manners on several of our visits - continuously pushing in front of people etc. Not to the fault of Skypark but does get annoying after a while.

All in all pick a sunny day, and go and be part of this spectacle - it's definitely worth a visit."
,,We saw this building as we drove in from the airport,5.0,,"We hadn't heard of this building before our trip to Singapore; I saw it from the taxi and just knew I had to go up it. There were four of us and with an Amex card and one person being a Senior, the total was Sing$62.76 (UK£32.48) for four people - a bargain given that the Singapore Flyer, which is much lower, is nearly twice that.

We did not prebook but there was no queue.

In fact we think this is a bit of an unknown gem as we saw no marketing or adverts for it, the building is its own advert. Staff warn you that you cannot access the pool or hotel area but you still have a large area to roam around in and we were excited to be up in such an unusual space. I'd definitely recommend a trip up the Skypark."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,The 360 degree views from this 57th floor observation deck are fantastic. S$20 admission charge for non hotel guests. Discounts for children and seniors.
,,Great architechtural attraction but .....,3.0,,"It must be a singapore thing but here.... c'mon let's take a photo on the green screen..... that's on top of the $25 fee to get up the damm thing.... the bar service was atrocious and then we were offered the buffet $110SGD.... not my idea of a day out on a holiday! .......

great views of all around singapore though.."
,,Elderly and wheelchair unfriendly but fantastic view from top,4.0,,"Price is $20 for adults and $14 for kids. The only way to get there is to take escalator outside tower 3 (near taxi drop off point). We were accompanied by an elderly person relying on wheelchair for mobility. Had to leave her behind as there is no elevator (lift) to ticket counter.

Also there was no seating arrangement or shelter at sky deck. If it rains, bad luck as you can't hold umbrella as it too windy.

Otherwise, the view from atop is fantastic and not to be missed.

Don't miss out laser fountain show at 8pm and 9:30pm every night. The show takes place at open gallery opposite marina bay sands towers but can be viewed from sky deck as well.

For a good view of marina bay and laser fountain show, walk all the way to the other end of sky deck observatory and climb the steps to reach top level. The view from here is unhindered.

There is a small over the counter food stall serving refreshments and snacks. Toilet facilities are also available on skydeck.

Before taking lift to the top, don't forget to take a souvenir snap against green screen backdrop. By the time you reach skydeck, a wonderful photo will be printed out and ready for collection. They charge S$30 for photo and S$50 for photo with faux leathery frame which is not worth IMO for a photo with computer generated backdrop."
,,"Expensive, but worth the views",4.0,,"It cost $20 to go up to the Skypark, which is at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. (Tip - if you hold an American Express card not issued in Singapore, then you can get a 25% on the second, third and subsequent tickets). Go around 6.30 - 7pm to get a nice sunset view of Singapore. The views from the top are great."
,,"Head for a drink at KuDeTa, skip the $20 fee!",4.0,,I was dining at KuDeTa (which wasn't as fantastic as i thought). They place was cramped and you could actually participate in the conversation of those sitting next to your table. Food was so-so. The only good break was walking out to have a breathtaking panoramic view of the entire city skyline! The infinity pool was also one of a kind! We skipped the $20 fee since we were patrons of the restaurant. You can actually head up to the pub for a drink which cost < $20 and then head outside to enjoy the view!
,,One of those truly touristy things to do,5.0,,"Many Singaporeans told me that there are other places to see the skyline of Singapore, for free. I opted to do the touristy thing, instead, and paid SGD 20 to see the view from the Skypark. I did not regret my choice. The views were superb! You can see all around Singapore, the CBD, Marina Bay and the newly reclaimed areas from here. There are signs showing what the buidings are. Unfortunately, you cannot see the famous swimming pool of Marina Bay Sands Hotel from the Skypark deck. But the view is worth seeing!"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"You get to see the ocean on one side, and on the other one, the tall skyscrapers with the bay on your feet.
The only bad thing is that you don't get to see the cool pool, which is only for hotel guests, and some other people that manage to sneak in.
Also on the side of the skyscrapers, there is a glass, which is not crystal clear, so your pictures won't be that good."
,,Top of the World Feeling,5.0,,"I went at night and I must tell you that the scenery at night is simply gorgeous. I can see the ships docked at the bay and the whole of Marina Bay lighted up, it is really something to behold."
,,Spectacular Singapore Sparkles,5.0,,This is a place you don't want to miss! We found the entrance and lift to the Skypark very confusing and not easily signposted. Once we found the elevator we took the lift to the 57th floor for a drink and the views were breathtaking. We went at dusk and saw Singapore light up and spent at least 2 hours here meeting people from all over the world. You must add this to your to do list in Singapore.
,,Great view,4.0,,"This is a great place to be at if you wish to view the small island of Singapore , maybe you need to be at different area in order to get a better view but other than that it is really good. Would visit again one day."
,,Best View of Singapore,4.0,,"Definitely worth a visit - tip, you can go to Ku De Ta instead of paying for the tickets up. The pool is only for hotel guests - worth a night's splurge on a room to do so. The mall downstairs is very Vegas like - lot's of high end stores, restaurants run the gamut from food stalls in the basement to celebrity chef type places. The light show at night is best viewed from across the bay - they do projected images into water vapor directly in front of the Sands, but personally didn't find it that exciting other than the technology of it."
,,SPECTACULAR VIEW,4.0,,"View at the top was spectacular but trying to find the entrance and ticket counter was a bit confusing. You have to take the escalator outside the front entrance to the lower level where you can buy your ticket, then take the elevator up to the top."
,,You should not miss this,5.0,,"If you are on a tight budget and do not want to give this a miss, go during tea time instead of meal time!"
,,What a view,5.0,,Interesting place to stroll around and look at views. Breezy and safe to walk around. Sunny but comfortable and relaxing to look around at so many nationals from all over the world.
,,best view at night,5.0,,"I like everything about Marina Bay Sands, Ku De Ta's posh atmosphere, all the beautiful young people that hang around , the Sling"
,,The best view in singpore,5.0,,It's one of my favorite places in Singapore and love taking friends there when they visit. Views over the city and and Gardens by the Bay are incredible.
,,Marina Bay Sands Sky Park,3.0,,"Indeed, the view from the <MBS Sky Park> is spectacular. However, you may visit places like <Level 33> at MBFC, <Equinox> at Raffles City, or <One Altitude> to get spectacular view of Singapore. Plus you will be able to enjoy finger food and drinks in these outlets. It is not worth to pay S$18 or more to visit the Sky Park"
,,Not A Penny's Worth - For Sure!,1.0,,"Marina Bay Sands complex makes for interesting photo taking. Beyond that, everything else cost big bucks and not worth the experience.

The Skypark offers limited views. You fight with crowds for the non-existent spot to take good pics.The safety pillars in place obstructs good views. You have to stand on tiptoes, raise your camera above your head and hope for the best.

You pay for your entrance to the Skypark but are not allowed to enter the infinity swimming pool area, etc.

You have been warned. You queue to get into the lift that brings you to the Skypark. You queue to get into the lift to get down to street level. I dare say your queuing time far exceeds your touring duration at the peak. There

If at all, the hype is the bragging right to say you have been at the Skypark. There are no definitive or iconic landmark to show you are in fact at the Skypark. Its true.

A better way to see Singapore's skyline is to go to the viewing roof at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. It it has been raining, the viewing roof is closed for safety reasons - be mindful of this. Because the roof is low, one can enjoy the marina sights and, ironically, can have a good shot of the Marina Bay Sands to boot! Admission is Free."
,,Stunning views of Singapore,5.0,,There is do many ways to see the views of Singapore from the MBS but the restaurant in the 53rd floor at night has to be the best. Swimming in the pool if you're staying at the hotel is fantastic. Or just go up to the viewing deck at sun down. Stunning. You can't kiss this in a visit to Singapore!!
,,best views of Singapore,4.0,,"Yes, you have to pay to go up, but its well worth the visit - not for the faint hearted/anyone with a problem with heights - its a great place to get some really good photos & to get your bearings; its great to look down on all the places you've been to & connect them all together."
,,Confusing at expensive,3.0,,"Great views but outrageously expensive if you are not staying at the Marina Bay Sands.
I’m still confused as to what and how we paid last time when I took guests up there. You have to pay to go to the viewing gallery but you don’t have to pay to go to the bar/restaurant (also overpriced and too many hookers in the evening) Ku De Ta. You can go to the viewing gallery but can’t go to Ku De Ta - or was it the other way round? Either way, we’ll send guests up there the next time but won’t go ourselves."
,,I liked it,5.0,,"good place to walk around, dine or lunch,shopping, light show is a must to see. Go there in the day time and night time both is good. I go there by boat and walking both is good. go to roof and take million pictures. I am sure you will like it."
,,BEST CITY VIEW ANYWHERE,5.0,,"This place is a stunner. Purely magical. I went with some friends including an 86 year young woman and she loved it as much as the ""younger folk"" We did a three week tour and saw so many incredible things in ASia and UAE but this was one of the great highlights for all of us. See the view and set yourself free!!"
,,Not For me but apprecaite they engineering,3.0,,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. A hotel on steroids for the wanna be travellers . If you into over inflated prices , shopping that is all signature labels beyond the reach of most than this is the place for you. If you are the new generation tourist of money and wealth that borders on arrogance and rudeness than this is the place for you. The hotel is out of this world and is great for the trendy set but for travellers that want to go for a swim an not compete with loud music and kids taking over the pool stay away. Nice things about the hotel are the pool an its views if you are prepared to put up with music , noisy kids ( even in the no kids area) The food court located in shopping precinct is disappointing when you have all of what Singapore has to offer the foodie in its world famous market food stalls.This hotel is world class in 5 stars and others areas but for the more matured traveller there is better value and environments in town. Won't be going back as i love Singapore and sorry but this hotel does not deliver a true Singapore experience"
,,Up High in the tree tops,5.0,,A welcome break from the bustle of the city. Skywalk cost S$2.50 per person. You go up in a lift and walk a short distance high in the sky and look out a long way.
,,limited access if not a hotel guest,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands complex is extraordinary in the size and scale. There are the 3 hotel towers sitting on top of a shopping mall, attached to a large convention center complex with many amenities. The Skypark is an engineering marvel, sitting atop the 3 buildings. A major disappointment as a visitor (rather than a hotel guest) is that your $20 buys you access only to the observation deck at the end - you will not get to see the pool or gardens. On top of that, drinks are about double the price of elsewhere in Singapore. I recommend this as something that one should see in Singapore just for the experience but downgraded it due to the limited access. If Kerry Z is correct and you can get access free just by purchasing a drink, that is definitely the way to go."
,,wonderful,5.0,,"I just gotta say this is really a masterpiece. I spent a half day in there without boring. they have a chain interesting point. First, in the top of hotel, this is the Sand Skypark, I had been enjoyed the best landscape. This location allow visitor to see the overview of Singapore. Especially, When standing here, I can't express my feeling by exactly word. wow. In hotel, they also have the art way, It performed a lot of famous artistic work. Although the ticket is high, I think it's worthy"
,,Skip the Singapore flyer and,5.0,,"Just skip the flyer and drink a caffee or icecaffe on the top of the hotel tower (price 10 S$). Staff is more then friendly, the view is breathtaking. Use the metro, orange line, it is just stop in the basement of the hotel."
,,Great weekend,5.0,,"MBS is Unreal Amazing place!!!! I've never seen anything like this. Staff is very pleasant and friendly, very nice view from the balcony in rooms."
,,Amazing 360 views all across Singers,5.0,,If only we could afford to stay here - just the view from the top is to die for. Imagine swimming in an infinity pool that is at the very top of the building .... The art installations around the complex - as in all over Singapore - are gobsmacking.
,,Perfect view,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore Marina Bay Sands is just an iconic must see. You have free entrance if you're staying in the hotel. Just enjoy this special treat, swim in the pool, enjoy the fantastic view of Singapore from the observation platform and have breakfast on the 57th floor."
,,amazing view,5.0,,"Ppl always spend 20dollars for attraction,actually no need. i always like to go there to have drink a night, there is reception as hotel lobby, then tell them you go for a drink , u wll got a pass."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Go up and enjoy the view while youre sipping a cocktail. Cocktails are expensive but worth buying one. On the menu they didnt have a singapore sling but its the drink you must have when youre enjoying Singapore from the skybar. You are able to see the seaside and the gardens and from the other side the city. Great music too!
,,Marina Bay Sands; great view,5.0,,"Best view, able to see the famous pool and great views of the city and the gardens/see. Free entrance but cocktails were expensive but worth it!"
,,Place to visit,4.0,,"Beautifully located with must see view from rooftop. You need to pay an fee to view the Singapore, or else visit the Hotel and pay extra for drinks with better view to the city"
,,"Don't pay $20 to go up to the deck, go to the bar on top Ku De Ta and have a drink.",4.0,,You get the same experience if you ask to go to Ku De Ta on the top of the building. Buy a drink and enjoy. Drinks are very expensive but you get something for your money and still enjoy the view. Staff at the bar were very slack and need to Lear good customer service skills. The view is amazing and not to be missed. Make sure you are dressed in smart casual for the bar. Men must have a shirt and long pants.
,,Be thankful for Seniors !!,5.0,,"Took the old girl, my mother 78 yrs and luck would have it, they gave her a seniors rate !! She enjoyed it after initially not wanting to spend $40 to view the city.
Have viewed as a Guest on previous occasion, but had to do it with my mother !!"
,,lovely view,4.0,,"We went at night time, awesome sight all the night lights, and a novelty to be so high up and outside. Cost $20 each though and they tried to sell us a photo for $50 !!"
,,Great place to have a cocktail,4.0,,What a great piece of engineering. A standout stucture that gives one a great view of Singapore and its port from the top floor bar. Beautiful infinity pool.
,,Awesome viewof Singapore,4.0,,"Firstly, make sure you go at night. its just more breath taking. The trip to the top costs $20/Head.

Now, this 20$ trip does not give you access to the Infinity pool. that is reserved only for the Hotel guests.

The view itself is quite spectacular. as you enter, you take a one stop life to the 56th floor. as you exit the life, you see the Gardens by the bay. the deck is a semi-circle, with a restaurant/Bar at the top. (Quite expensive). and as you walk the circumference, you can see, the Garden by the bay, the Flier, the Promenade theatre, Helix bridge, the Singapore Skyline (Quite a nice view).

You can at max spend about 30 - 45 mins here and enjoy the view. I would also suggest to take the MRT to get here. get off at Marina Bay (Red line) and follow the signs..

Nice and Romantic, but can get crowded. :)"
,,Great views,5.0,,as you would expect the views are just fantastic. $20 to get up there but you can spend as much time as you want just taking it all in. definitely a must do!
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"The infinity pool is an amazing feature! Looks like you're going to fall off the edge, which you of course don't. The view is to die for, 57 stories above the ground. Nice area, lots of sunbeds. Note that you nust be a hotel guest to use the pool. The bars and restaurants are open to all though so you can see the pool even if you can't use it."
,,Never seen anything like it!,5.0,,"This Lounge is unreal...you sip your cocktail with Japanese and Russians swimming next to you, while you are overlooking the Bay from its vantage point. Try to spot the little Merlion or Fullerton Hotelfrom here...it's fun!"
,,Wow !,5.0,,"We visit with business so need a quality hotel with great efficient service, and the Marina Bay does not disappoint in any way. Rooms are great and views looking back on the city are unsurpassed! Service in the main areas are excellent, staff so attentive!"
,,Do not pay for this attraction,1.0,,"Please don't spend S$20 on this attraction as the bar (separate entrance) is at the same height and allows you to view it for free.

The bar's entrance is just inside the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to the right. Do not go down the escalators to the Skypark entrance."
,,Worth it for the veiw,3.0,,"Worth it for the view, make sure it is good day and you will enjoy the view. It does cost $20 per person but does give you a great view. A little more information on how it was built and so on would have been good. You can't get in to the pool area but there is a little cafe up the top that has beer, coffee, snacks and souvenirs"
,,Must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The most amazing view in Singapore. There are several spots to visit at the roof. First of all is the observation deck which has a fee. This allows you to get access to the edge of the roof with plenty of space for pictures and views. This is located on the 56th floor and gets you a small access also on the top floor. Then there is the bar at the top floor. Free entrance, nice music, spectacular views and nice coctails. After 11pm you get also free access to parts of the observation deck. Next to the bar is the night club. There is a cover charge to enter and it is next to the amazing infinity pool. The infinity pool is only for hotel guests but from the night club you get a very decent view of it. It is a must see"
,,Best views of Singapore,5.0,,If you like to get one of the best views of Singapore then there is no other place to be. $20 gets you to the viewing platform and some of the best 360 degree views of Singapore City and harbour. A bit of shade on a sunny day may make it a bit more comfortable.
,,Pretentious and expensive - better views elsewhere,3.0,,"Want the most expensive cocktails in Singapore with plenty of attitude from the bouncers? Come here.

I get it, it's the cool place to be seen but there's no need for the unfriendly attitude and the requirement for a dress code after 6pm when an hour earlier you can go there in shorts, thongs and kids can eat bowls of fries, then I don't want to pay $28 for a cocktail in that environment. Still, it's a stunning building and worth bearing that for an hour."
,,Great views from the top of this iconic building,4.0,,"The view from the sky park is fantastic great for taking photos, it costs $20 each to visit the dedicated viewing platform atop this unusual looking hotel, there is a shop there where you can get drinks and souveneers. We really enjoyed the views and stayed for quite a while as there was a storm brewing above the city and we watched it come in across the bay before they had to close the platform, it was quite a sight."
,,Great views of the bay,4.0,,Loved seeing the bay from above. It gives a different perspective on the light and sound effects at night (check out the baby and the singer images projected on the clouds/water below the building). Wish I could have gone swimming in the infinity pool!
,,Top of the world,4.0,,"At $20 to go up, it is not the cheepest thing to do in Singapore, but where else do you get a view like this. The enterance is right at the end of the Marina Sands Hotel and like everyone else we were wandering through the foyer taking photos. Go outside at the end and it is just around the corner. No queues on a Thursday, during the day and quickly I was in a lift that takes you to the top in seconds (no view from lift). At the top you can only wonder around the very end of the ""park"", the rest is reserved for hotel guests. Plenty of photo opportunities. There are no seats at the top, which is probably a careful plan to get you to not stay long and there is just a gift/ coffee shop selling a few very pricey souviners (no seats). Also, there is very little shelter at the top from the sun or the rain, and none of the shelter designed for seeing the view from. If the place is not busy, they open up access to the restaurant and the KU DE TA bar, but were quick to close the access when a few people arrived. Possibly if you ask the hotel person at the top if you can get passed he will let you. The lack of seats at the top is the only thing that droppped this from 5 to 4 stars for me."
,,Great Sunset,4.0,,"We arrived right on Sunset. As others have said its $20 to get up but cheaper if you use a AMEX card and buy more than 1 ticket. You have to go down the escalators from the lobby level to get to the ticket booth and then take the elevator up from there. You can walk around the one of the ends of the Skypark but can't get into the Hotel pool area. There is snack bar and then a bar and restaurant. We were impressed that the wind was not an issue up there, it was very still. Good views over the city which is lit well at night. There are also a few laser and search lights from the building which look good of the usual misty weather."
,,What a view,5.0,,The area and view were the best in Singapore. The drinks were expensive but to see the view was fantastic. Massive complex but well worth the visit.
,,Unbelievable Views,4.0,,"I was in Singapore on business. My friend had suggested that i take in the views from viewing platform on the 56 floor. It costs S$20. By getting a pass to the restaurant on the 57 floor you get a fantastic view, and you only have to buy a beer, for S$18!
Go on, do it, you know your worth it."
,,Excellent view of Singapore,5.0,,"I had 1-2 hours to kill before a flight out of Singapore. I arrived shortly before sunset and looked like there were lots of people living. I had a hire car that I parked in the underground car park and walked through the shopping mall into the hotel reception. I was then directed to a side entrance of the hotel where I purchased the tickets for the attraction. No queues. I noticed a large queue for taxis outside the attraction (people who were leaving).

I didn't appreciate the hard sell of photos, etc. as soon as we reached the top - extortionate prices for just a photo or two.

Lift took us to the top fairly quickly - not too busy on the top - spent about 30 minutes looking around and taking photos, etc. Great views out to sea and also over the city towers. Some sort of bar selling snacks/drinks at the top - looked OK."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"The view from the sky park is fantastic great for taking photos there is a $20 charge if you are not staying at the hotel, there is a shop there where you can get drinks and souveneers, well worth a visit.5
They charge to much for the the photos they take of you as a moment of your visit $50 Singapore in a leather bound frame"
,,Nice hotel,5.0,,Very nice hotel and observation deck. What I also liked is that there are no long queues you can go up straight away. It's a shame that you can't get to the infinity swimming pool if you are not a hotel guest. But beautiful views from the top. Definitely worth it.
,,You just have to go there!,4.0,,"Having spent our trip to Singapore photographing this building from every conceivable angle we just had to go and see the view from the top. We had read about going up via the Kudeta restaurant but we didn't and in hindsight I think that was the right decision as you don't have access to the observation deck from there which you really need to get the most from the view. The price isn't high and they weren't too pushy when we didn't want to buy their photograph. It was very hot up there.
The view was fantastic, particularly for me all the shipping coming into Singapore which you are totally unaware of from ground level. The views of the gardens by the bay and the flyer were also great not to mention the bay itself. Really glad we went."
,,Overwhelming Experience,5.0,,I think this is the best spot to view the Singapore skyline. I don't know if it is just me who gets so overwhelmed when you're in a high place but the experience was really great!
,,What a view,5.0,,"I have yet to find anyone who does not like Singapore as it seems to cater for just about every activity a tourist wishes to undertake, including providing great locations to experience the sights and sounds of the city. Of course all great cities have their landmark viewing spots and for Singapore I believe this is the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Located on Level 57, Skypark offers unparalleled views of both the city and bay areas and also provides access to bars and restaurants. Taking in the sights at sunset is very special as the lights of the city take over."
,,birds eye view,5.0,,Was an amazing spot for a total view of the city area - better than the flyer in my eyes. photo opportunities are good - lots of room to take panoramic shots. Found the afternoon was a little crowded in comparison to the morning but you were still able to get good views and photo opportunities.
,,The view! you need to see it...,4.0,,... but suggest you do not give them your credit card! They lost mine and later found out they gave it to the wrong guest who had payed his drinks already with it.
,,Kudeta on top of the Casino,5.0,,"What an amazing place to go to at night.
A lift takes you to the very top of this amazing building where there is a nightclub/cocktail bar and viewing decks.
Around 8 pm there is a light show below at the new Gardens and a laser light show from the top of the building somewhere that lights up the sky above.
Views all around are magnificent and it doesn't cost anything to ride the lift to the top."
,,unforgetable experience,5.0,,We were guest in Marina bay sands hotel. the pool is never overcrowded and you can easily find a spot for yourself. The famous over the edge picture is a must.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I arrived at the hotel at 10 am and they immediately let me check in early free of charge, the room and facilities where very clean and beautiful, the swimming pool was out of this world and the staff gave the best service I have ever received anywhere, I would strongly advise anyone visiting Singapore to stay at this hotel. When I return to Singapore this hotel will be my first choice everytime"
,,Not for you if you get vertigo....,5.0,,Well worth money 20$. Would be great if you could get a proper look at the swimming pool and gardens.
,,Nice hotel,5.0,,Very nice hotel and observation deck. What I also liked is that there are no long queues you can go up straight away. It's a shame that you can't get to the infinity swimming pool if you are not a hotel guest. But beautiful views from the top. Definitely worth it.

,,Not for you if you get vertigo....,5.0,,Well worth money 20$. Would be great if you could get a proper look at the swimming pool and gardens.
,,really touristy,3.0,,"We went to the science museum and were offered a visit to the Marina Bay Skypark at a discount. Felt like we were in a big cattle car to get to the top - plus they were trying to sell photos of us all the way through. You'll get equally nice views from lots of other locations, and this ticket does not get you to the pool area of the hotel - just to an observation platform and bar - filled with throngs of tourists."
,,What A View,5.0,,The hotel is beautiful view is amazing. There is a shopping centre and casino attached. Also food everywhere. Besides the view which is a must see. You could spend the whole day around that area. The Gardens by the bay is within walking distance. Also for you car buffs. Outside the entrance to the Marina Bay Sands you can pay to have a ride in a Ferrari or Lamborghini. They are Brand new too.
,,Truly wonderful,5.0,,Amazing waterfall. Lovely to get out of the heat and see all the amazing plants and trees. Could have spent all day there. A must and for a special treat eat in Indochine on top of the trees.
,,Waste of time and money,2.0,,"What a disappointment! Wish id read the reviews to save the $20 charge. For a view you could go to new asia bar, and at least for the cover charge you get a free drink."
,,Sky High,4.0,,For only S$20 you can go to the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands tower and visit the Sky Park. The views are specatular. Althought not quite 360 degree views - as you only have access to the front portion of the sky park. The other portions are reserved for hotel patrons.
,,What a view !,5.0,,"This was my second time up there, and again its an amazing 360 degree view .... enjoyed the friendly staff that was offering to take a picture of us. Next time, I am sure; I will be up again."
,,Worth a look.,4.0,,"The skypark is on the ""ocean liner"" structure which sits atop the awe inspiring three towers you see as you drive into Singapore from the airport. I've been here several times now with work colleagues and family members. Entry is approximately SGD$20 for adults and are purchased in a ticketing area outside one of the towers. You need to go down a set of escalators/stairs to the ticketing area. I found it difficult to locate this area the first time, so just ask one of the friendly hotel staff for directions. The view from the skypark is stunning, especially after dark. There is an infinity pool that you may have seen in photos but this area is now off limits to visitors and is restricted to hotel guests. There is also a restaurant/bar, however, booking is required to avoid disappointment. You can purchase draught beer in a plastic cup for SGD$12 from a kiosk if you feel the urge and there is also a souvenir shop. It is definitely worth a visit, even if only once. I have really only been multiple times to show others. Easy access to and from Marina Bay Sands by taxi."
,,Once in a lifetime experience!,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands just so that we could have access to their pool! It was such an amazing experience and totally worth it! It was so beautiful up there in the daytime and at night. The views are amazing! We watched a couple storms come in and go over us, which was really pretty and when it rained too hard we just skipped over to the hot tubs :)"
,,the best view of the city,5.0,,take a tip just go to the hotel in tower 2 and ask to go to the bar for a drink - that way it cost you nothing -except the drink - also go half an hour before sunset and stay at least half an dhour after - brilliant
,,Dull. Very common.,1.0,,"Very disappointed. Paid $20 SGD to go up 56th floor. Looking at the view. Its better going to the places you are viewing rather than wasting you time going up. Nothing to do except for photo taking. And scenery. Apparently umbrellas are not allowed to be used in this floor but everyone were using umbrella. No shed to go if you want to stay dry. Expensive food and souvenir. It wasnt the one i was expecting.

Tip: do not visit and waste $20SGD. Better to go to see the places up close rather than going to 56th floor. Unable to access for swimming pool bcoz it is for guest only."
,,Amazing views across Singapore,5.0,,Great experience travelling up the fast elevator to the top to an awe inspiring view across the whole Bay and up to the hills in the north. Pretty hot out on the deck but worth the experience. The gift shop staff were very friendly. Worth the price.
,,WORTH THE EFFORT,4.0,,"For me, it was had to find with a lack of good signage. And getting across the road from The Shoppes was not so easy. But it was worth it as the 360 degree views from the 56th floor at sunset and early evening are pretty spectacular - and you look down on the Flyer. Information was good, but there no seats as I guess they want to keep people moving."
,,Excellent view,4.0,,"Excellent view of Singapore, including the Singapore Flyer, the Fullerton, and Esplanade. Quite windy up there, so bring along a wind-breaker. If you love photography, be warned that the use of tripod is not allowed."
,,This is the most amazing place,5.0,,A must if you aren't scared of heights. Be prepared for the heat and make sure you have water with you. You can buy food and drinks. The views on the sky deck is spectacular.
,,As with Singapore everything is huge!!,4.0,,I went to the roof top which overlooks Singapore and its breathtaking. Would have like to have spent more time there.
,,Better than the Singapore flyer!,5.0,,"On level 57/F of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the skypark is open to public at a fee but it's free for hotel guests. You get to see the whole marina bay, the BCD, gardens by the bay, and as far as the orchard area, in my opinion the view up here is better than the singapore flyer cause you get to access to the swimming pool (being a hotel guest) and the view from the pool down is priceless!"
,,MARINA BAY SANDS,5.0,,"A prominent Building on Singapore's skyline is that of ""MARINA BAY SANDS wth ARTS & SCIENCE MUSEUM"".A unique design of three buildings with a boat shape structure with sky park is not only famous but the $ 8 billion costly project in the Singapore.We took many pictures from outside but because of time constraint could not enjoy its interior & kept this in our list for future exploration."
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,If you aren't a hotel guest you only get access to part of the deck but it's plenty of room to see everything. On the small picture they show you when you buy the ticket makes it look small. The deck is really nice and most of it has 6 inch or so openings you can take pictures without glass in the way.
,,Must-see,5.0,,"An amazing city overview, you have to come 2 times, one in the morning and one at night, the place has 2 restaurants and a bar as well, all with great view to the city center, however, be ready to pay 5* hotel prices or you can just enjoy the view for free."
,,Breathtaking view at a great price!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands complex is a striking piece of engineering in itself, and the view from the top of this extraordinary structure is something to behold, costing just S$20 (£10) to visit. The viewing deck is spacious, and is also completely open to the elements, allowing for spectacular, uninterrupted views of the entire city-state and the Singapore Strait. I was even able to make out Johor Bahru in Malaysia, and a bit of Indonesia. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Singapore!"
,,"Not good, if you care about your S$20 fee, and human rights!",2.0,,"For S$20, I expect unobstructed views and unlimited access to the deck locations, anywhere and everywhere, for as long I wish, and no controls on the use of photographic equipment. This is not the case here, no tripods, monopods or whatever allowed, no loitering, no access to the swimming pool (why is the stupid swimming pool there in the first place?), only half of the deck is accessible for viewing, bags are subject to searches (terrorists in Singapore?) and the place is damn crowded (why don't make it online booking only to control the amount of people here?)."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,"Accessed from the base of Marina Bay Sands hotel, the views from the top must be the best in Singapore."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Elevator up to top large area to walk around to see amazing views of Singapore. Well covered as I am not the greatest with heights found it fine.
,,Great views,4.0,,Recommend going to the observation deck only. The restaurant you are looking at paying close to $30SD for a beer stubby. Great views. Quite a lot higher than the singapore flyer.
,,What a view!,5.0,,We paid a discounted price because we went to the ArtScience Museum. The view from the Skypark was a great addition to a wonderful day.
,,It feels like you are the top of the world.,5.0,,The view from the roof-top swimming pool is fantastic:)
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is a unique building worth visiting at least once. I'm not sure how expensive the hotel is, but you can get access to the awesome looking rooftop pool if you stay there.

Otherwise you can either pay to go to the top of the observation deck, or get in free into the club at night. Of course the drinks will be expensive when you get up there, but it's a free evening view of Singapore."
,,On Top of Singapore,5.0,,"As advised by our cab driver, we went to the Marina Sands SkyPark instead of the Singapore Flyer because it was higher and we can stay longer as compared to the Flyer's 30 minute flight. For S$20 an elevator will take you to the 56th floor in less than 30 seconds to the observation deck. Don't expect to see the swimming pool because they are exclusive to the hotel's guests and you are only allowed at a certain portion of the deck. The view is just breathtaking and you'll get a bird's eye view of Singapore and beautiful photos for sure. Be prepared because the winds can get strong so hold on to your hats."
,,Worth seeing,4.0,,This park is worth seeing although some of it is a bit unreal overall it is a must. The domes are a must.
,,must do for the big view,4.0,,"You are isolated from the Hotel guests and that becomes a bit insulting - but I can see why

Singapore flyer is more focussed on the day visitor - if that makes a difference - don't do both.

What is annoying is those ubiquitous photographers pushing fake - green screen photos - for a huge price -"
,,Awesome view,4.0,,For 20SGD it will bring you to the top of the building and you have a magnificent view over Singapore. Don't forget to bring your camera!
,,Awesome 180 degree Singapore view ...,5.0,,"The best place to view Singapore from the sky . Really an awesome view especially at night ... the office building , flyer , esplanade , Garden by the bay etc... considered as one stop center"
,,Amazing view!,5.0,,Worth paying the money to go up here - amazing view of the city. I would not have paid to stay in the hotel so I could go in the pool though - it was absolutely rammed when we were up there.
,,On top of the World,5.0,,This is the most amazing place. A must if you aren't scared of heights. Be prepared for the heat and make sure you have water with you. You can buy food and drinks. The views on the sky deck is spectacular.
,,Impressive structure at a price,3.0,,"While this building and concept is amazing its pricey for what you can do. You can get a $5 discount for paying with American Express card, tickets $35 or there abouts, there is nothing much available to you when you get up there. The lift...More"
,,Swimming Pool with a View,5.0,,"Never ever have I seen a swimming pool so big (150 metres long) with a view to die for. Simply stunning. The whole area is well managed, clean and the towel concierge does a great job. The whole atmosphere within the Skypark is terrific from...More"
,,Jaw-dropping view specially at night,5.0,,"The first time I saw it in a picture (it was my brother posing at the edge of the pool with the city’s afternoon skyline), I was already mesmerized, and so what more if I would be able to experience this first hand? Thus, the...More"
,,great view,5.0,,its called skypark after all. and it is a totally a skypark with a terrific view of singapore. and the edgeless swimming pool are the focus of the show here.
,,Good outlook over Singapore,3.0,,The view over Singapore is very good but the skydeck itself is very uninspiring. Good to do once but would not need to go back
,,57 Floors high- what a view!,5.0,,This attraction was something we wanted to see. But be aware of the photos taken at every attraction and how it can start to get really expensive. After purchasing our tickets we were ushered to an area to have our photos taken. My husband did...More
,,To get into the pool you have to have a room key.,5.0,,Outstanding venue. Best views of the harbor in Singapore. The infinity pool is best used at sunset and plan on staying there to see the lights of the city at night. There are spots in the pool where you can only get wet up to your ankles. Don't miss the hot spas on the opposite side of the park. I've never seen so many ships in one harbor at one time.
,,Spectaculat Skypark,5.0,,"This is just a must do when in Singapore.Such an amazing City, brilliant architecture everywhere you look and ths Skypark allows you the opportunity to really soak up the atmosphere of some of this brilliance."
,,Disapointed,2.0,,"We didn't realize the trip to the observation deck would be so expensive, then getting there finding there was very little refreshment opportunity.

We visited the restaurant and I complained to the manager because the service was terrible. Very rare for me. In fact the food (which was great once it arrived) was only forthcoming when i told him we would be leaving without settling the bill.

Could have been so much better."
,,Overcrowded at night,4.0,,"Great breathtaking view of Singapore skyscrapers and the Gardens By the Bay. Good location for photo taking and enjoying the view on the roof top. However, the place is somewhat overcrowded, especially at night."
,,A must see landmark,5.0,,Went here with my family. I go to kudeta bar instead of the observation deck so i can get pool view. Best time to come: 5-7 pm to get both afternoon and night view. The view is fantastic.
,,Fantastic View!,5.0,,"Amazing view of the city from the 56th floor! Its best to go there just before it gets dark and stay there until its completely dark to get the view during the day as well as night. Its worth it!

I went to the skypark first and then went to the Singapore Flyer the following day. After Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer did not feel like it was worth the visit as the view from Marina Bay Sands Skypark was better. In fact, I got a better view of the Flyer and Gardens by the Bay from the Skypark too. Morover, it was easy to capture the view in my camera as Skypark is not enclosed. But in the Flyer, it was an enclosed capsule."
,,Great view but expensive,3.0,,"Such an expensive experience. AUD$20 to go up to the top and if you would like a cocktail whilst you are up there you can only have one if there is a table available and there is no way of knowing if you will get a table until you pay and go up. We happened to be lucky enough to get a table and we ordered a frozen margarita and they were AUD$30 each and the same drink at Clarke Quay was AUD$12. It's not that I can't afford it, I just hate being ripped off - so maybe it would've been better if we were not able to get a table that day. There is no shade up there so beware of that. Also if you need to go to the toilet, elderly people be warned, you will need to manage about 20 stairs down to the toilet and of course climb the stairs back up. I know my mother would've found this a real issue."
,,"Wow, what a building",5.0,,"You must see this both from a distance in the day time and lit up at night. A visit to the skypark on the 56th floor of this hotel and casino is an absolute must to overlook Singapore, but do choose a clear day if you can."
,,Club room bar,5.0,,"Incredible view, I highly recommend getting up on top of this truly amazing structure. Three tall towers (around 58 stories) with a ship on top bridging the three towers. I was never much of a sailor, so this looks like an accident I would have if I was driving the ship (lol).

I stumbled on an alternative to spending $20 just to see. They have a club level at a level one up from the paid observation desk. They let me up there with no questions asked (free entrance), but I suspect I looked like a paying customer. They did not seem to require it, but I had a glass of wine and a very nice salad and had an incredible view to go along at the cost of a typical nice Singapore restaurant. Not inexpensive, but the view came for free. I made the mistake of buying the Sky Park too, but it was redundant so it was a waste of money. If you have money for a nice drink or meal, skip the Sky Park, and enjoy the Club level."
,,Mariner in Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"Was with my family, 4 all in, and we all enjoyed much the fantastic creation that has taken place on this beautiful spot in Singapore. Hope this may never be history....."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"This is a must do, although take your own water as it is expensive to buy food and drink. Also take a hat as there is very little shade. The views are amazing and well worth the visit."
,,Wow,5.0,,Wow is the only word to describe the view of the city from the sky park bar. The infinity pool looking out over the city is truly breath taking. Take a drink at the sky park it is an experience not to be missed be prepared though as he cost of those drinks is also sky high
,,"There is a free way, depending on what you are looking for",3.0,,"There is a free way of doing this attraction, however it really does depend on what you what from it.

We wanted to visit the roof top of the Marina Sands Hotel, to get an idea of the view, see what people were talking about and generally get a view of Singapore at night as we had done the Flyer (the wheel) during the day. We were also keen to get a drink from the bar on the top deck. I had read on here that you could get the bar at the top without paying the entrance fee. To do this we spoke to some helpful reception type people who were standing next to an entrance to some lift at the end of the 3rd tower. I simply asked them how we got to the bar on the top deck, they showed us to the lift and up we went. The super quick lift took us up to the highest point were we found a restaurant and the open air bar. This was fantastic and the view was awesome. As we hadn't paid the entrance fee we couldn't get access to the actual observation viewing platform, however the bar was actually a floor above this and has ample areas to take in the view from both sides of the hotel and is completely out in the open, the view that we had was just as impressive.

My advise would be go to the bar first, check it out, in reality you don't even need to buy a drink, and then see if you need to pay the entrance fee for the attraction."
,,wow....wow.....wow......,5.0,,"Bucket list.............Another one off the list...!!!
truly amazing.......... The pool and the views are breath taking. there are also two Jacuzzi's a restaurant and a gift shop on the top. You can spend hours up there and surprising enough we were expecting the place to be packed solid, but that was not the case. A must see..."
,,Iconic bar scene with great view,4.0,,Happening place at highest and most iconic building in Singapore. A must experience for visitors to SG.
,,The place to be when you're in SG,5.0,,You have to visit Marina Bay Sands when you're visiting the big city of SG. The view of the city is really beautiful. Especially at night!
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Nice view, amazing place. You can drink something and see all Singapore in this place. If you are in Singapore you should try once"
,,Big Thank you,4.0,,"We forgot our handbag contains wallet, monies, credit card and passport of my wife in the taxi which brought us at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. A big thank you to Erin Ono whom responded was immediate, friendly and professional, in one hour had located the taxi and we had our handbag back.

Erin really saves us all the trouble and once again congratulations!!! Erin. We will be coming back to your wonderful hotel.
Reliable hotel"
,,Stunning view!,5.0,,"Everything in this place was nice. You can see the whole skyline of Singapore! The service was also nice, every staff was helpful."
,,Koo de ta bar is great alternative.,3.0,,Skip the $20 for the Skypark and get pass for the bar for free. Still good views and good place to get a good drink and relax
,,Kudèta is the right choice,5.0,,"From a distance, the place will already captivate your curiosity... Just wait and see what else it offers.

Been to this place before, and i must say it just keeps getting better and better. It never fails to give u breathtaking and relaxing sceneries, delicious and mouth-watering foods from appetizers down to desserts, heartwarming service from the friendly staffs esp from the manager, Ms Irene Wong who made sure that everything is perfect for me and my friends the night we were there.

What else to say? ""just don't leave Singapore without visiting this place."""
,,Expensive but great views,4.0,,"The Sands Skypark observation deck is quite expensive s$20.00 to visit but the views over Singapore are outstanding, look out for the floating football pitch."
,,Excellent view from the 57th,5.0,,"Went to Skypark @57 with friends. Excellent view from the top. Initially they won't allow us to the outside deck without ordering alcoholic beverages. However, they relented and we had our soft drinks outside. The view was magnificent, very beautiful skyline especially during the sunset. I strongly recommend it. The food was a snack like. But it is worth the visit."
,,Sigh,2.0,,"Staff are quite inflexible and not particularly friendly. A little on the stiff and starchy side. Considering all the hype, one would expect it to be fantastic. MBS - Fail."
,,Excellent place for views of Singapore,5.0,,"Looking for a great place to take pictures of Singapore, drink and dine from high above, this is the place!"
,,"Expensive, and PACKED with tourists.",3.0,,"OK, so everyone wants to go up here. Please note you do NOT get access or views of the pool. You need to stay in the $550+pn hotel for that privilege.
For $20 you can go up and look at Singapore from a tall building. This is not the highest building in Singapore mind you, just quite tall. Seeing that Singapore is very humid, you would be hard pressed to find a day with a clear sky thats not hazy,.
If going up tall buildings to look at other tall buildings is your thing, then by all means check it out. There is a bar up there too. But be aware it is PACKED with tourists, and its really not that amazing."
,,Great View!,4.0,,There are so many things to see and do in Singapore but there is one that I would recommend you experience while here. It is not a high priority but one that is nice. The view as you travel across the bay is worth the ticket. In fact you may want to experience it more than once because it is so relaxing and enjoyable. If you have the opportunity make the time to experience.
,,Waste of $25,2.0,,I dont really see anything special about this skypark. Just same as any other places. I think they charge too much.
,,Birthday celebration Restaurant on 57th floor,5.0,,"We celebrated my Dad's 70th birthday recently by going to Singapore. On the birthday we went to the 57th floor restaurant and indulged in the amazing chocolate and cheese bar. The buffet was extensive. There was fruit, crackers and different types of breads to go with the cheese and chocolate. The service from the moment of booking was faultless. I got an email confirmation and a phone call on the day to confirm the arrangements. A little cake was bought out and the staff (along with the restaurant) sang happy brithday to my Dad.
The views were just stunning. We walked around the whole area and saw the stunning infinity pool.
A special day made even more special."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Well worth a visit & the view form the Bar is spectacular - the drinks are very pricey, with a beer worth about $18 & cocktails, $30 ! Was pretty crowded,so the price of drinks certainly didn't detract from its appeal."
,,breath taking view of Singapore,5.0,,"vow what a architecture, you get an amazing & breath taking view of Singapore from top of Marina Bay. we felt it was worth the money to have view from the top."
,,On top of the World,4.0,,"After a short time in the queue, I have my (Sing$15.00) ticket. Before you even reach the lift, you’re ambushed for a photo which of course they hope you will buy on the way out. A very quick ride takes you to the rooftop of the building and views in every direction over Singapore. Unfortunately the day I visited it was very humid and the moisture was visible in the air, reducing the quality of the photos I took, but nevertheless it was a worthwhile experience to stand on the top of a building in the open air and see a city laid out before you.
Food and drinks are available on the rooftop."
,,the amazing restaurant on the 57th floor..,5.0,,"had a wonderful time in Singapore, Kuala lumpur and Penang an awesome place to visit all the locals were very friendly. A lot of great fun with great friends, visited a lot of attractions including the Singapore Flyer, Raffles Hotel for a Singapore Sling and a different world in Penang so very interesting, also the ride on the trishaw they do a great job its hard work for so little money. Lots of wonderful places."
,,Awesome Place,5.0,,"My husband and I loved the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. We didn't get to see the pool but we will on our next visit. If you are not staying there it's worth book the Singapore Night Out tour which includes the Skypark, Gardens by the Bay light show, Water Light show plus a short river cruise to Clarke Quay."
,,Great views,4.0,,"This is an extension of the hotel and the views are great, can see most of the Gardens and at night quite unbelievable."
,,Architecturally brilliant,5.0,,Absolutely breath taking view & design of this area is very impressive. Restaurants along this area also capture these views. We did hit a busy time so wasn't so relaxing but Adult section was a little quieter.
,,Spectacular and just a great place to be!,5.0,,"Truly amazing views of the Singapore skyline right through to Malaysia and of the boat-laden coast over to Indonesia. We stayed at the hotel for one night for my daughter's 15th birthday and although we were upgraded to a spectacular room, spent most of our time up at the sky park. We were there for a Thursday night and found it not too crowded and truly enjoyed lazily swimming around in the highest infinity pool in the world.

The staff were very friendly and accommodating, although I seemed to have to chase up the waiters for the two lychee mojitos I treated myself to whilst lounging poolside on a pool lounge.

Definitely a highlight of our trip!"
,,Fascinating,5.0,,"Loved this little piece of Singaporian architecture. Fascinating place to visit,. Had a drink on one of the tall trees. Very interesting just to wonder around"
,,Great views,4.0,,"Breathe taking views of the Singapore skyline, had lunch in the restaurant was good. When finished lunch enjoyed a cold beer while looking at the beautiful skyline recommended"
,,Not as big as I expected but spectacular,4.0,,"The Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands was well worth a visit - - while it is expensive it is spectacular.
the views over Singapore are outstanding and well worth while. you have all the time you need to take in the sights and take photos.
The majority of the Sky park is reserves for guests of the hotel and you are not permitted access to this.
The elevator to the top is spectacular and can be quite frightening as it ascends the 56 floors - - there is quite a wobble felt as you ascend and descend.
your picture is taken on a blue screen when you arrive and you are offered the pictures to purchase when you arrive at the top but there was no pressure on us when we said no."
,,"Sky on 57, Wow!",5.0,,As I was only transiting in Singapore I just had to have breakfast at the top if this hotel as where it was situated the sights were there all to view from the top. For just SGD39. It was well worth it. And you can see the amazing Skypark too.
,,A Postcard Memory,5.0,,"You know sometimes when you go away and can only get crappy photos of your own that look nothing like the postcards or other photos you've seen. Well this is different every view is absolutely amazing and easily captured. The city, the harbour, gardens by the bay and the singapore flyer all look so small as you gaze in awe down on them. Sunset is a perfect time to visit this must see attraction and take your own picture perfect postcard."
,,Great by night,4.0,,Great by night to see the light show of the Marina Bay Hotel and just relaxing. The bay is a good place to overview the Singapore skyline.
,,See most of Singapore in a Heartbeat!,5.0,,"There is no better place for getting the bird's eye view of the Lion City! Stunningly located, and one of the best strolls you could take to see the panoramic splendor of Singapore. Also located (and requires separate access) is one of the most breathtaking infinity pools in this part of the world."
,,Great views,5.0,,"This is a must if you want great views of Singapore. Take the elevator up and walk out the deck and be prepared to be blown away. Best views, and great photo opportunities. I took some of my best photo's from up there. The cost was about $20.00, I don't think there's any time limit as we were up there for ages. There is a restaurant but we didn't go in. There is also a drinks and ice cream kiosk."
,,Amazingly awesome views,5.0,,Standing in Ku De Ta having a beer looking down on the Grand Prix track is something to remember. Watching the sunset over Singapore is amazingly colourful and breathtaking. Seeing Singapore light up as night falls was absolutely great.
,,"Nice, futurist, place to go for sure",4.0,,"This site is very ambitious and i think represents well Singapore. Futurist, well done, and refreshing We were there on the end of afternoon, and had a fabulous sunset. The view on the MBS and skyline is breathtaking."
,,The most stunning nighttime view of Singapore,4.0,,"On a warm balmy night, take yourselves to the Bay Sands hotel and marvel at its three towers stretching up 56 floors with, yes, a boat on the top. This is now the iconic Singapore building made famous by its Formula One appearances with the pit lane only just below. The restaurant has stunning views - altogether a great experience. Don't miss the opportunity if you are in Singapore."
,,Closed For Private Function,1.0,,"Went all the way down there only to be told it is Closed today for Private Function. Was told to come back tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes! Was closed next day too. Best to call before you go maybe."
,,What a view,5.0,,This view of Singapore is a must see! Especially if you can time it for sunset and then see the gardens by the bay light up at night. You can then take the foot bridge from the hotel across to the gardens direct
,,Great views of Singapore,4.0,,"Go for the sunset, great views of the city. The bar at the top is expensive, but worth a visit for the view alone!"
,,What a view.,5.0,,$20 for the most incredible 360 degree views from the 56th floor. An absolute must do when in SIngapore.
,,Great view of Singapore!!!,4.0,,I would recommend coming here for breakfast or set lunch. This is the cheaper option than dinner and you can still see the lovely view. You will need to book though. remember that in Singapore the day after a heavy rain the sky is usually very clear and bright for great photos!
,,A Night Visit to Remember,5.0,,"An almost 360 degree view of Singapore By Night - Gorgeous - lights galore - a camera is a must !! From memory you are about 56 floors up, the open deck tour is extremely worthwhile. You can also plan a Tour of the Pool Deck but spaces are limited."
,,What a view,5.0,,It is well worth a trip up to the Skypark. There is a fee but don't let that put you off. A very fast elevator ride and there is one of the best views of Singapore. It is all very well organised and you a very informative video prior to entering the elevator. There is a merchandise store at the deck of the Skypark
,,Skyhigh view,4.0,,"Great views from this amazing vantage point above the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. But once the views have been admired there's not much else to do. The Marina Bay Sands is an engineering triumph and the views are incredible, but after that - there's not much else."
,,Great views,4.0,,Very pricey to stay at but a visit to the observation deck is worth it. Great views in all directions and you can stay as long as you like. Food/drinks at the top also pricey but as a one off indulgence it's OK.
,,A shopping/dining wonderland,4.0,,"There was so much to do, I could go on for some time. But let me just mention a few high points. 1) A big casino, 2) A huge shopping mall, 3) Indoor ice skating rink, 4) High end and unique stores, 5) Breathtaking architecture and design, 6) A great view of Singapore city sky line, and that's just the beginning. You must see it for yourself..."
,,"Marina bay sands, a mark, an Identity for Singapore.",5.0,,"Marina bay sands, a mark, an Identity for Singapore. Awesome artitech with many events with lotsof fun and knowledge. It's bit expensive of accomudating when compared with INR, especially South Indian living, but worth it for enjoying the global lifestyle nor visiting the bay roof top for day trip. A must places to visit in our routine Singapore trips and I do."
,,Brilliant views,5.0,,One thing you must do when in Singapore is visit the SkyPark and enjoy the views at the top. Brilliant feat of engineering and awsome structure - incredible. Links to Marina Bay Shopping Mall too!
,,Great view but crazy expensive,3.0,,"Going up to the Skypark is a must, but just once... The view from the deck is amazing. You see both the city and sea-side because of the great location. However, the admittance price is really high. They take a photograph of you when you go in, but you have to pay an exuberant price for the ""cut-and-paste"" photograph if you want to take it with. Not recommended... When you get to the top, the normal Singapore heat makes you crave a beer, and they know it up there! The bar is crazy expensive! One nice thing is that the high prices makes for a quiter attraction! Which is great!"
,,you are the sky,5.0,,"excellent, fantastic, it has not shairs, new technologies, the best time for visit it is sunset. Good choice to have a dinner to the restaurant"
,,What a view!,5.0,,"If you are staying at Marina Bay Sands, it's worth the extra money (if you can) to have access to this amazing pool area.
You'll fight to get a pool lounge but pounce when someone leaves. People get there early and grab them with towels. Kids end is crazy, but as we were a couple, we opted for the adult end.
We didn't do the flyer as this view trumped that view."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"I had read that most advisers here recommend you afternoon hours to escape the fuss and the queuing. if you have very limited time, I would agree.
But honestly, I prefer the view at night. Cities like Singapore to me are much more fascinating with the night- shiny buildings lights.
The view is breath stopping.It is amazing how creative a city can be in terms of infrastructure and architecture.
I would be visiting it each time, I will happen to be in Singapore."
,,Too big,3.0,,Very nice area but way too big and confusing. Bring $$$$ nothing cheap here. Def a playground for the rich.
,,"No,atmosphere",2.0,,"And they couldn't wait to move you out so someone else could jump in your grave, had to walk a long way through the hotel to get to the sky bar and then told if you want a meal up there you need to go back to lobby and see if any vacancies from there as they couldn't do from we're they were, which is ridiculous they all have computers access. Wouldn't waste my time going back"
,,Overlooking Marina Bay from high above,5.0,,"The skypark on the rooftop of Singapore's new iconic ""Sands"" hotel is a must do when visiting Singapore. The nearly 360° view is well worth the money and the height offers some great photo opportunities. You get a discount for the bar but as the cheapest beer is about S$ 16 we decided to go without that."
,,"Great view, shame about the drinks",2.0,,"Arrived at about 9-30pm The downstairs entrance and hallway to this hotel reminded me of Terminal 5 at Heathrow, busy, noisy, soulless place, somewhere I would never want to stay.

We took the lift to the top floor and went to the bar that looked into the pool area. The pool was mainly populated with canoodling couples, some looked more like Sugar daddy's!

We moved onto the bar that's part of the restaurant. Very busy and international in the clientèle. Eventually we were served, and to be frank, the bar tenders had little idea of what they were doing. I ordered a cocktail that required remaking twice and the first wine ordered was corked. So 50% of the drinks required returning, I don't mind paying sky high prices, but expect sky high quality and service, this was in short supply.

The view is fabulous and a visit is a must when in Singapore, but don't good service or products on offer. We walked through the restaurant to get to the bar, apart from needing a torch to see what you were ordering or eating, what I did see of the food little every average."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Awesome views and could avoid viewing charges by going to Ku de Ta for a drink and it is one floor higher which makes it bettwe with music
,,Most impressive views of Singapore bay,4.0,,"Unfortunately the observatory deck does not give you access to the bars and infinity pool on the main deck ( you will need to be a hotel guest) but if you can live with this handicap, then it is definitely worth a visit."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"The most amazing views and a great night club! Make sure you are dressed properly, smart casual is fine. Drinks are a bit pricey but that's Sinapore."
,,Spectacular,5.0,,We went up to the top of this fabulous building and were extremely impressed with everything - views are amazing. The drinks and food quite pricey but I guess you only do it once?
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"My partner and I went to the top of the Marina Bay Sands. It costs $20 each to go up but there is a small discount if you pay with Amex. The view at the top is amazing! You can see everything in Singapore. They have maps which locate and explain various things you can see from the top. We were going to go to the restaurant and buy a drink rather than pay the fee, but I believe the view was far better from the viewing deck. You can see the hotel guests in the pool. Must do!"
,,Visit the bar and get value for money (ish),4.0,,"Definitely worth doing the trip up to the Sky Park as the view is amazing, but do as we were advised (if you fancy it) and don't pay the $20 per head to go up and look at the view go straight up to the Sky Bar for free. Dependent on your pockets you could just order a coke for $8 and enjoy the music and the view (which is actually higher than the observation deck) or you can get a nice cocktail for $25 (so in a way you get a cocktail for $5 along with the view - a bargain in Singapore!). If you ask the guard at the entrance they will let you out onto the top of the observation deck but not down onto the rest of it but I do not think you miss out as you still get to see the full view whilst relaxing to music and a nice drink."
,,Great Views,5.0,,This was our first time at the Sky Park and we were amazed at the views from the top. We went up to the sky park at around 5pm and it was not that busy - there were no queues. You can take some great photographs from the top. There is a small gift shop at the Sky Park where you can buy souvenirs. Please be aware that the Sky Park is only a small section at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the pool and bar are off limits unless you are a guest at the hotel.
,,"Great views, day and night!",5.0,,"Top tip - it costs $20 to visit the sky park, but you can go to the Sky bar (Ku de ta) for free, the drinks are pricey, $38 for a caraffe of Sangria, $24 for a cocktail, but the views are worth it, what better place to have a drink. Get there before 6 to avoid the queues, after 6 there is a dress code, no flip flops or shorts and they are strict, but dress correctly and you can be up there enjoying the sunset with a cocktail in hand. Heaven."
,,nothing much!,3.0,,"If you go to the Singapore Flyer don`t go to the Marina Bay observation deck because you will pay $20,00 just to have pretty much the same view!!You are not able to go to the restaurant area or see the infinity pool view!!"
,,It's worth it!,5.0,,"Amazing building and spectacular view, especially at night. We went to the Ku de ta bar at the roof floor (57th) to have a drink and it was worth it (20 singapore dollars for drink + view, not bad)."
,,A must do whilst in Singapore,4.0,,56 floors up & it's a 360 degree view of all of Singapore! Yes it's pricey for what it is at $20SGD but you have to do it as the view is sensational.
,,Nice view from skyline,4.0,,I like the scenic view from the top of skyline. But I don't like the officer who offered me to take picture with Marina Bay Sands background. The price is not reasonable for ordinary picture.
,,Amazing view of the city,5.0,,"Good thing the weather was fair when we went there because the skypark is really an open area. They warn you that if it rains, you cannot open an umbrella because it will be blown off by the winds. Shelter for the rain is also small, with just the area to the elevator or small store there as your choices.

Nonetheless, the view from the deck is spectacular. You can see the gardens by the bay there, the bay area, the city skyline, etc. You just have to shell out a good amount of money though."
,,Place for a cocktail,5.0,,"In Singapore for 2 days with 3 friends we had to go there. Amazing building. Bar top floor access not easy want to stay exclusive, anyway take the lift tower n*1 57th floor minimum spend at the bar 30$ but well worth it. Fab views of the city. I say no more. Charming service and efficient, good bloody Mary.
Go around 7 ish and wait for dark to arrive. Just fab!!!!!"
,,Great views worth the $20 especially at night,4.0,,"Loved the views, you can see for miles. Night time you are right on top of the marina bay light/laser show."
,,swim on the top of the world,5.0,,"roof top pool on marina bay sands hotel, free access for hotel guests. Sands SkyPark Observation Deck is open to members of the public who purchase a ticket."
,,Great View for first timer,3.0,,"They open at 9 sharp, The View is great for first timer in Singapore as you can see without blocked anywhere, including some of Batam island (i think). They also let you in to see some parts of Marina skypool @ 10, Wow the sky pool is great with nice view and lots of people swim and hang around. It's great for first timer to visit skypark, but i don't thinkk it'll interest me the same next time."
,,No cotton is allowed in the pool!,2.0,,It was my brothers 18th and we decided to go for a swim as we were staying at the hotel. We saw the view which was good then we grabbed a complimentary towel from the life guards and jumped in the pool. Before we could swim we were told that no cotton is allowed in the pool and only bathers! We like to cover up so it was a terrible experience!
,,cool down in hot Singapore,5.0,,"This is a nice, big mall in a short word. There are a lot of (looks) nice restaurants. We didn't eat here, so can't comment, but regret to have eaten here instead of Chinatown. Food court looked amazing. Will definitely come here to eat if we go Singapore again.Area ground are also very nice to browse."
,,Breathless !,5.0,,"Yes it is real. I don't know how they did it but it's fantastic and it's worth seeing in the morning at sunrise, during the day to relax at the pool and in the evening at one of restaurants or bars !"
,,Normal exprience,3.0,,The type is just like other tall towers in the world. If you like you can have a try but It's not that you die if you don't. Cause the experience is quite normal. and the ticket is not cheap at all
,,57 gloors,5.0,,Take the high speed lift for $20 to level 56! An awesome sight awaits when you ventue out tonthe view! Well worth a visit! No time limit either like The Singapore Flyer. Such an interesting view over the city taking in The Gardens in the Bay bell below!
,,AWESOME VIEW,4.0,,"A must visit place, gives you a sky view of the entire singapore.... should be visited in both day and night as it has different things to offer. Drinks not upto the mark in the rooftop resto and costly too..."
,,Superb view from the top...Visit at Night...,4.0,,"The splendid building that is Marina Bay Sands offers a spectacular view of Singapore from the sky park at the top..... The entrance fee is 20$ but its worth the money.....Make sure you visit at night when there is no hot sun to ruin you visit...Also at night the view from the top is spectacular... You can sit there and rest for sometime sinking the whole view in.... You can see The Singapore FLyer, Gardens by the bay, F1 racing track, Esplanade Park... all from the top........ A must visit....
Tips
1. Make sure visit the place at night...or at least evening when the sun does not trouble you....
2. Get a good camera to take great snaps"
,,""" Heaven of Heaven """,5.0,,"Travel to singapore is impossible not to visit this place - one of the beautiful architecture and the most famous singaprore Incredibly unique architecture is the most attractive place here. A view from the top of Marina Bay Sands hotel gives a great overview of Singapore. I paid $ 20 SGD for the elevator ride up to the top of the ""Boat"" deck and hoped to get some photos of the city from up high. It's not at all worthwhile money. I could see the entire city in focus. A wonderful picture. How could I forget this. The atmosphere was great and I really love it I will come back here with my family so they can see this amazing scene."
,,Brett & Lynn,5.0,,"What a spectacular view, it was a very hot day when we went up. Drinks are very expensive at the bar. Could see everything in Singapore from here."
,,Ripped off,1.0,,"Entrance fee was S$20 per adult, you expect something a little bit better! What you expect is a bright hot sun over your head so you get sunburn and a very small area for viewing! Basically you will see everything and take a few photos and be out of there in 10 minutes! You can't even sit down to enjoy the view or anything. And they also wants to charge you S$45 for the photos they took at the entrance!"
,,A View from the Top,5.0,,"A must do ... two ways you can either pay to visit the viewing platform or visit the Cocktail Bar for free, via the hotel...... entrance is just inside to the right . Cocktails are expensive but food is reasonably priced. View is magnificent. We had a great time and certainly enjoyed the cocktails, food and the view."
,,"Impressive, but tourists not really welcome on the top",3.0,,"Great to look at from afar, shops are excellent, hotel staff look down their noses at tourists. The lift ride to a small deck at the front of the ""boat"" will give you great views, but not sure it's $20 worth - perhaps an expensive drink or meal at the bar would be, if you can persuade security to let you in"
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Great views and very interesting architecture. It's amazing when someone's imagination and creativity comes to fruition. Will definitely visit again in Jan 2014.
,,Visionary building,5.0,,"There are some great landmark buildings all over the world. Singapore has this hotel and this is really a beautiful building. Views from there are excellent, only downside is that you need to be a hotel guest to visit the pools, but nevertheless, can't beat those views from the observation deck. A must for all travelers."
,,A very Expensive partial view of the city.,3.0,,"Coming from a structural engineering background, visiting Marina Bay Sands was pertinent to my return visit to Singapore - after 10+ years. Without being a guest of the hotel, I was only able to see the structure from the general public point of view.

So I paid $20 SGD for the elevator ride up to the top of the ""Boat"" deck and hoped to get some photos of the city from up high. It was a sunny day with few clouds in the sky, which typically is great for photos. However, in Singapore that also means hot hot temperature with a side of humidity, even though it was still early. Be there plenty early as the free tour to the secured area starts promptly at 9am.

There's a little gift & snack shop up top. I don't remember finding a chair to sit on. There's absolutely no shade provided except for a little awning in front of the gift shop. As part of the free guided tour, they do give you a small bottle of water and a pre-packaged cotton towel to mop up your sweat! How considerate ;-)

The view from the Skydeck is quite beautiful, however, keep in mind that you can only walk around the ""bow"" of the boat. So there is no possible way for you to see a full 360 view of Singapore.

As for the free tour, and keep in mind it's free but require you to sign up. There is a 15 minute time constraint and you are ONLY permitted to walk along a VERY short portion of the shaded walkway with the famous infinity pool to your right and some individual hot tubs on your left. However, in no time are you allowed to step off to the right and be 1 extra centimeter closer to the infinity pool. Again - Hotel guests ONLY. The ""guide"" was not able to answer my slightly more technical questions, at the same time with only 15 minutes, there's not much time to do anything.

If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to join the Free tour, I would just go there for the sunset and wait for the lightshows (Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay each have their own light/laser shows, separately)."
,,worth a visit,4.0,,A view from the top of Marina Bay sands hotel gives a great overview of Singapore. It was a terrific view and gave us an understanding of of the density of the city. also the restaurant on the top level was great
,,"Overrated, Flyer better",4.0,,"Very hot, the deck burned through my shoes. Not enough seating if you just simply wanted to sit, have a drink and enjoy scenery."
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"We found information pretty hard to come by for this, even on Trip Advisor, so hopefully this will help others.

Firstly there appears to be three areas at the top of the Marina Bay Sands - 1) the pool area available to hotel guests only, 2) Ku De Ta - a bar/restaurant with a separate entrance and 3) the Sky Park. We initially wanted to go to Ku De Ta but got there at about 6 o'clock to be told that after 5.30 men must be wearing long trousers or jeans (the men in our group weren't). As a result we paid the SGD20 per person to go up to the Sky Park.

When we got to the top we discovered that the Sky Park and Ku De Ta are both at the front of the 'ship' (ie in the same place) with the pool further back. You can just about see the pool from a distance but not clearly. Ku De Ta appeared to be very busy and we quickly decided we were glad we weren't allowed in! The view we got from the Sky Park was much better as there was much more room to find a place on the edge for photos.

I'd suggest you go up just before dusk and watch the lights come on over the city. You get an excellent view of the CBD which looks amazing at night.

There is a gift shop at the top which also sells drinks and there are toilets too. There is no limit to the time you can spend up there. We were there for just over an hour as we waited for the lights of the city to fully come on but you could easily do it much quicker if you wanted to.

Entrance is just outside Tower 3 and the Bayfront MRT station is the closest one.

Overall I'd strongly recommend this be part of your trip to Singapore and I hope this review is helpful."
,,No entry to the pool area,3.0,,"The pool area, which i heard has one of the best sceneries, is restricted to non-guests so we weren't able to take some pictures in there. Just like any other tower in other countries, this would give you a good view of the city, both day and night time."
,,Sensational,5.0,,Unique expérience swimming up to the edge of a huge infinity edge swimming pool 57 stories up. Gets a bit crowded so get there early to get a deck chair. Fantastic views of Singapore.
,,WOW!,5.0,,"I stayed here in March 2012 and am staying again January 2014 so I am very excited!
The Skypark alone is just amazing! It resembles an artists impression before construction takes place because it is that perfect looking!

There is a spa on the opposite side which is warm, bubbly and fun. The pool is open until 11pm which is great. Too many hotels close there pools down at 9pm and that is so frustrating when on holiday. Night time swims are so fun. Especially with a view such as the MBS Skypark."
,,"Just Crazy, Wonderful.",5.0,,"This place, just wow. We found out on our last day that the incredible piece of architecture was a hotel, and could be visited by those not staying at the hotel. We paid our $20 odd dollars and within seconds were in the fastest lift I have ever been in, and was at the top of the Skypark on the observation deck. The night lights of Singapore were just breath taking. We spent a while enjoying the atmosphere, the sights and taking copious pictures, before retiring to the bar just away from the viewing deck. We had out delicious drinks, of London quality and pretty cheap considering where we were, and soaked up the all around awesome. Would LOVE to stay here."
,,great!,5.0,,"have to go! 20 dolars to go on 56 floor - to see all there is to see. you see The Flyer and all great hotels arouns, the Gardens and the entire city. there is a lounge also. but you can not use the pool, it's only for paying guests accommodated in the hotel. go for it!"
,,great view of a great city.,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore definitely visit the Marina bay sands skypark. Singapore has such a beautiful marina, skyline and gardens . going upto the skypark at night is a breathtaking view of the city, the gardens and the singapore flyer. If your afraid of heights go out of your comfort zone and still pay the $20 to go up the fast elevator to the top and enjoy the view, worth the $20."
,,The Flyer is a better value,3.0,,"Although we did enjoy the views and you can see the infinity pool from a less than expected angle it is a little pricey for what you get. My recommendation is walk thru the lobby and enjoy the views from the bottom, then take the Flyer and see the city views as it is all air conditioned and more relaxing and also a nice view of the Marina Sands. We considered a room at the Sands but at $860 per night we instead decided on the Four Seasons. No Regrets!"

,,really excellent,5.0,,"what an architecture
amazing and huge
go the 57th level ( i think only from the tower number 3 ) and you see the swimming pool the gardens by the bay , the bay and the flyer and a big part of the city and the sea with all the ships and ..."
,,"great place , sadly no refreshments at the top",5.0,,"pricey tickets , great views when you are up there , but very little in the way of affordable eating and drinking when you are up there ."
,,Just a view,3.0,,Have to buy a ticket to get there but there were not any place to seat. We came at 4pm and standed until 8pm. They waste of money when they took a lot of photos and not many people bought it even the photos of them because it looks not real.
,,The lastest symbol of Singapore,5.0,,"The view from the top floor is magnification. The whole Singapore is sparkling under your feet, can spot most of famous attractions from the 57th floor."
,,Swim in the sky,5.0,,"Worth a view , day or sunset or night , its still amazing !! Only the guest of MBS hotel are permitted to enter this area. They will give you paper bracelet as entry code , and it changes everyday so you cant bring the same bracelet for your trip next days. Because it is written (Monday) on it. The color is different too everyday. They gives you limit up to 4 persons to enter this area per room. They have warm jacuzzi too, lounge , bar etc. They lend you towels here but you cant bring your towel down to your room."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"You won't find this within the next 1000 Km range, the view up and from above are breath taking. It is sure something not to be missed, even if you think it is a bit crazy."
,,Ruined by an exceptionally rude staff,1.0,,"Short story: The breathtaking view is totally ruined by an exceptionally rude staff who makes guests never come back. Especially, when they are willing to enter the restaurant.

Long story: I was there at a late afternoon with covered sky, so it was not as crowded as other guests might have experienced. Just for a short glimpse it seemed a little expensive, so I looked at the Sky Park restaurants menue downstairs and decided to eat something up there. I was not a hotel guest, so I bought the ticket for S$20. First, you get instructions where you are *not* allowed to go (pool, garden) with your ticket. Thank you very much.

Just next behind the ticket corner, on the way to the lift, the staff hassled me to get a picture even if I did not want. Is this Disney Land?

The staff around the lift obviously think the guests are to stupid to find the directions and show in confusing ways where to go. It is really easy to find, when you ignore them.

Finally I made it to the Sky Teracce and enjoyed a great view with only a few people around! I headed to the restaurant.

First impression: Outdoor not one guest, but a lot of staff (5-6) rushing around on the terasse, ruining any atmosphere when you image to sit in between. Indoor it was almost empty. Not a good sign. Well, I have already had a look at the menu downstairs and wanted to enter. A guy at the restaurants entrance stepped right into my way without saying a word. As I ask him what he does want, he replied ""Show me your pass!"". No ""please"", no ""Sir"". As it turned out, he did not mean the passport but the ticket for the lift(!). Possibly, at times, people fall right from sky there and are not allowed in the restaurant then...? He stated: ""You can not enter, unless you buy a drink."" Well, actually I wanted to eat something - correction: I had wanted.

I am sure, there are plenty of nice places in Singapore where one feels welcome. This is not the place."
,,Must go!,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore then you have to go to Marina Bay Sands Skypark! You will have like a 360 view of Singapore; sky, sea, bay, skyscrapers, singapore flyer, you name it! The sky pool is breathtaking, but you have to be a resident in MBS hotel to access it. There is a sky bar, restaurant and a small shop selling MBS souvenirs.
I think the best time for being up there is when the sky is cloudy as the sun might be quite hot. There is a fee for entrance but definitely worth it.
Note: The skypark is closed during heavy rains & thunderstorms."
,,Average.,2.0,,If you have been to any other skyscraper viewing deck in the world such as Dubai and the worlds tallest building you will know what to expect. It's a great view but is disappointing you can't access the gardens and swimming pool unless you are a hotel guest. Expect a simple but good viewing deck.
,,A Must in Singapore.,5.0,,Wow! 57 floors up you feel on top of the world! Fantastic views. The large infinity pool is breathtaking. There are seats and sun loungers. It is a good place to watch the nightly laser light shows. Residents staying at the MBS Hotel have one daily access included in their room price. Take a swimsuit and enjoy! There are bars and restaurants up there too.
,,worth a view,5.0,,"though they charge you for getting there, the view is worth it. try to avoid buying the photograph which they click - its a waste of money, they just do some photoshop and make u luk as if u r standing infront of marina bay sands, luks ridiculous.
one more bad point is they dont allow you to visit the poolside( infinity pool), its closed for outsiders, only for the hotel guests."
,,Visit the Club on top floor,5.0,,Must visit the club on top floor. Its awesome and you will enjoy the rooftop party. If you are going with your wife or girl friend then you should visit club.
,,A must do at night on any first visit to Singapore,4.0,,"$20 entrance fee but well worth the expense. The skypark only allows you limited access but that's all you need. Your be hard pushed to find a better view of a major city. I went at night and it was incredible, stayed up there for 1hr, if you go in the day it wouldn't be half as good. So do it properly and go at night!!!!!

If you arrive early enough they do 3x 20min tours a day for no extra cost on a first come first serve basis. 1 in morning, afternoon and night. Only holds a max of 50 ppl per tour. We managed to get the last 2 slots on the night tour. They say its a tour but really they just escort you to the infinity pool which you can hang around for 20mins, take a few pics then leave. It's to crowded. The pool is class but you can go in there unless you have a room. It's good to see but wouldn't say this tour is a must. If you turn up to buy your ticket and you can by chance get on it then great. But if not its no big loss.

There is a resturant and snacks available at the top but as expected very expensive.

The most important aspect of this is to go at dusk and after !!!!! You won't leave disappointed"
,,Super!,5.0,,"Had a great time up in the sky. You have a lovely view but the water and light show seemed quite little from there. But I loved it, especially at night it was a must-do. Not cheap, 20$.."
,,A must see,5.0,,This is one of Singapore's must see attractions. At first the $20 fee seems a little rich considering you only get access to a limited area but once there you soon forget that! Go at night!!!
,,Nice view of the city,4.0,,Great opportunity to have a nice view of the city without spending the money to stay in the hotel. Access to the pool is only available for hotel guests but the view can be enjoyed by everone willing to pay the cost to go to the top.
,,Great spot,4.0,,"in One word, its a wonderful view. it was good a experience for my friend and i in singapore. i took photos of the flyer & Singapore City. its a 'must see' in Singapore"
,,Worth the Admission for the View - Avoid the Photo Ambush!,5.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands Skypark is an architectural marvel. I have watched over the years as it went from design concept to completed structure but only recently had an opportunity to experience it directly.

The view is stunning as you would expect even though visitors are only permitted entrance to one end of the Skypark, the middle section and other end reserved for hotel guests.

We visited at sunset which I would recommend as it is both cooler and the colors are beautiful across the Singaporean skyline - weather permitting.

The only annoying aspect of the visit - which seems to be viral in Singapore - is being ambushed at the entrance for a green screen photograph which is ready by the time you arrive at the top for an exorbitant fee. Better to take your own photos. This is certainly one of the least eco friendly aspects of Singapore attractions as they obviously print and throw away and enormous number of photos each day - easy to do charging those prices.

We politely declined these photo ops at each attraction saving ourselves an outrageous cost and the environment unneeded garbage."
,,Great view,3.0,,"The skypark is open to the public on a limited area only. You don't have access to the pool area or the gardens as these are for hotel guest. Beautiful view of the Gardens by the Bay, specially at night with all the light shows."
,,Great place to visit when in singapore,5.0,,"marvellous is the word.I really enjoyed the ambience and feel.The infinity pool experience was great and must be on ""must see""list when in singapore"
,,Views are awesome,4.0,,"It was an awesome view - great for me to take photos of the flyer, gardens by the bay & Singapore City. It was $20 per adult & you had a photo as you first walk in, it is ready for you when you go 56 stories up in elevator- $50 for a photo was a bit steep so we passed on that. We got a mango & strawberry drink which was lovely & cold as the sun was so hot $5 per drink vs $12 for a beer"
,,Impressiv as an airport,5.0,,"Huge, but not as spacy as expected. Lovely lunch restaurant in the basement, TWG. Possible to go to the Flyer, the stern, but nothing else. Impressive, but is not taking part in the beutification of Singapore."
,,Great View of the City,4.0,,"Amazing View of Singapore. The architecture is just plain awesome. The infinity pool is amazing, great view, chilled-out area, lots of happy people around, a must see if you visit singapore, it is a signature design."
,,Amazing experience!,5.0,,"We went to the Skypark when visiting ""The Club"" for their Dessert and Cheese Buffet. Instead of paying the $20 just to go up to the Skypark or the $100 minimum spend in the restaurants we decided the buffet was for us - and it was very tasty! With matched wines (and taxes) we spent $90 so we weren't far off. The view is amazing and it's definitely an experience I would recommend."
,,Unforgettable,5.0,,"Ever since I saw that this building was being built, I fell in love with it. A boat on top of three towers? Yes please! Despite being crowded and a bit limited I was glad I went on the tour because the view was stunning and unforgettable. Even looking at the pool was a fantastic experience since it's not something you see every day. If you want to admire the beauty of Singapore from one of its best architectural masterpieces then don't miss out on this opportunity."
,,nice glamours location,4.0,,"went to marina baysands, must go to observation deck, very nice and fantastic pools up on top. shopping mall and food court superb too"
,,limited tour,4.0,,"i visit the sky park on the top of the 57th floor with 20 S.G.D
in the night and this was my mistake the views were
not clear and so the photo
i took a photo from the gallery for30 S.G.D
there no way to go the pool area if u not a hotel guest
the two restaurants are expensive and by reservations"
,,Night visit!,5.0,,The cost for foreigners is $20 to access the Sky Park so I decided to have dinner at the restaurant that had a min $80 spend but no entry fee for the Sky Park. The restaurant is a level above the Sky deck and has a bar. From either level you get stunning views of the island and bay. There's lots of room to move around and enjoy the view. The lights at night are so pretty and on a clear night you can see for miles.
,,Just a view and only a view,3.0,,It costs $20 but it's one of those things you have to do even though you will be under whelmed by the experience. Don't get me wrong the view is great but $20 is a bit steep. You can't even sit down. We chose this over the flyer.
,,Nice,4.0,,Is like Market very crowded. But once you go up to the top you will have a good view. Is a breathtaking view. Enjoyed
,,A place to visit,4.0,,"Pitty u have to pay $20 each and u cannot use the hotel pool, .. Great views, better than the flyer.. make sure it's a clear day. Gives a completely different view of singapore from above."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,3.0,,The infinity edge pool is cool but is a bit like an Asian subway - way too crowded. Good luck finding a deck chair if you just want to relax and good luck taking a swim amongst the ppl who are just interested in taking selfies. Great view though.
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Expensive food, smoggy view. The whole environment feels sterile and only willing to take your money!"
,,"disappointing - no poolview ""only skyline""",3.0,,if you don´t book a guided tour you can only have a loook from one side of the terasse. You will not see tha famous pool or anything else.
,,Just WOW,5.0,,"Impressive building, amazing view from the rooftop bar, very good food inside the hotel. You can't miss it if you are in Singapore!"
,,Costly view. But,3.0,,Everything in Singapore as gone up a lot since I was here 3 years ago So I suppose paying $20 to go up to a high roof top and look around fits in with all the other blown out excesses which has befallen this city.
,,marvellous bulding,4.0,,"enjoy this amazing construction, is like a mini city in itself. i love the pool and the scenery. service and food just fine. i will be back"
,,Nice view but price is steep,3.0,,"The view from the Sky Park is nice, but I preferred the view from the Singapore Flyer more. Only hotel guests get to enter the pool area, so if you're only paying for the Sky Park ticket you don't really get to the topmost floor of the building, where the infinity pool is located.

The area where Sky Park ticket holders are permitted to roam is rather limited, which was quite disappointing, especially when you're sharing such a limited space with so many people jostling for a nice spot to take photos.

One of the very few good things about it is that it's a high up open space so the air is bound to be (relatively) fresh and windy. But other than that, it's not much to boast about. I'd rather go on the Singapore Flyer once more."
,,breathtaking,5.0,,I would recommend to all I love it but I think 20SGD it's little to much probably should be more like 10SGD
,,Must go,4.0,,"The skypark and MBS itself are no doubt among the top highlights of Singapore, the building and the facilities around is definitely fascinating and you dont really get to see that many places that is interesting in itself and also serves as an observation deck of the whole city (think Eiffel Tower, Paris). However going on weekends is a no-no, too crowded."
,,Not Worht it,3.0,,To the best of my understanding and liking the sky park is not worth spending 20 bucks unless if someone is a hard core fan of high rise views. Travellers are not allowed in the swimming pool - for your information.
,,Need to do to say I have done it,3.0,,"For a first time in Singapore, I was compelled to do this. Would not do again but glad for the experience. Great views."
,,A unique experience,4.0,,"I did not pay for full access to the ""skypark"", but took the elevator to the hotel bar. There is a large indoor bar (Ku De Ta) and another outdoor bar on the very end. Both have great views, we settled in at the outdoor terrace and enjoyed a fantastic view of the setting sun over the city. Of course, like everywhere in Singapore, the drinks were outrageous - $25 SGD for a martini, $18 SGD for a beer. So, order 1 drink, sip it, and enjoy 1 of the truly amazing rooftop bars in the world.
I did not have access this time, but I have to say the pool does look spectacular - infinity edge on the 57th floor....may just have to do that next time."
,,VIEW OF THE SINGAPORE NIGHT LIGHTS FROM TOP,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands is one of the most fascinating piece of architectural marvel in Singapore. The Sky Park which extends around 360 metres across the three towers on top with a cantilevered deck of 50 metres give every the view of Singapore specially during the night with lights all around an experience of life.
,,World Tallest Infinity Pool,4.0,,"Like: Breath taking vie of the city, great pool, great Jacuzzi, unlimited towels, a name with prestige.

Unlike: the pool tend to be a pool party. never seen so much people in the pool, especially in the hotel pool. You need to wear the paper bracelet as a pass for a day. I repeat, a day."
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,Marina Bay Sands you don't want to miss because this place very attractive and romantic and of course foods also expensive.
,,Nice view,5.0,,It is very nice to see around the Singapore from the sky park. Specially in the night when they having the light show by using different colors of laser beams. Lights are located on the top of the hotel building and they project them on to the lake in front of the hotel.
,,Not a good as you would think,3.0,,"After spending a good amount of money to get to the skypark, we found it quite disappointing. The views are good, but no better than the Singapore Eye."
,,brilliant,5.0,,"exelent hotel, perfect location...swimming pool on 57th floor...loved it....if you going to singapore and not staying in marina bay sand...its fine....still u can go to 57th floor by paying just $20 SGD"
,,Unbelievable Views,4.0,,"Very busy but well worth the visit, definitely something to be seen, quite expensive but no where else could you have a drink with a view like this one. Grand Prix track lit up beneath us, just magic!"
,,wonderland after 25years my last visit,5.0,,shopping and shopping many shops many brands. easy way to spend money. easy way to eat Michelin restaurant here.
,,What Views!,5.0,,$20 to get to the 56 floor to look out at Singapore from the Skypark. Worth it? Every penny. But be aware - there are no seats once you get up there!!
,,Amazing pool,5.0,,Three towers connected at the top by a great swimming pool.swiming in this top pool is quite an experience a I felt swimming in the sky.the bar in the 57 for is great.casino and mall are also great.ome of the top hotels of the world
,,Skypark View,4.0,,"Its really more fun have a drink over the top of the towers experiencing the beautiful view, swimming is good to watch and the gardens."
,,"Nice view, you can cycle and skate too",5.0,,"You can shop, have a drink, dinner at the lower floors and come up for some fresh air and some sights. Worth a visit"
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,The skypark can be accessed through the elevators of tower number 3 headed to the Ku De Ta which the bar of the hotel. You will be granted free access to the 57th floor and will be able to enjoy the fantastic night view from here. There is no requirement to drink anything at the bar as the view is accessible on a separate place. Drinks at the bar seemed very expensive (cocktails around 25 SGD at least).
,,A dream comes true.,5.0,,"Am sure this place is everybody top 1 to visit in Singapore and sure it is. when you are up there, you feel like the world is your's."
,,Awesome Pool,5.0,,"SG trip won't be complete without experiencing the MBS pool. It's worth a try. Going up on the deck and see the whole city, enjoying happy hour for me it's the best birthday gift for myself. I highly recommend to include this in your itinerary in SG."
,,Nice place,4.0,,"The trees are very funny. I like the skywalk the most. The Singaporeans are so considerate. If there's wind and then the bridge will be closed. At that day it was open and walked to the bridge across the tress, which was a good experience. The flip side is it is not free."
,,Nice experience but...,4.0,,"It's always a great experience to climb tall building like this, espcially when they have an open swimming pool on their roof. Panorama is awesome but the skyline from the 57th floor misses Marina Bay itself and looks a bit anonymous.
Sunset and/or night the best time to visit."
,,Sands Skypark - V. Disappointed,1.0,,"Are you willing to SGD 20 for nothing? If you do, no one can prevent you to go there. I do not see why it costs 20 dollars to go there, the place is small and you can only view one side of the bay area and you cannot have 360b degree view as the view were blocked by the swimming pool. I would rather keep the money for a sumptous afternoon tea."
,,"Very expensive view. Could be run better. A definite ""Money Grabber""",3.0,,"Its hard not to take pics of this amazing structure whilst in Singapore as it keeps popping up everywhere you go and it is absolutely amazing but,,,,,

If you are not staying there then you don't get access to the top deck unless you pay $20 which we decided to do but I will justify the Money Grabber part of my title here.

There's a $20 cost to go to the top. When you get there there is a small bar at the top that sells the usual crap at ridiculously expensive prices. You're restricted to where you can go and really there is no point in spending any more than 15 minutes at the top.

They could make it more worth while by placing some seating and tables and chairs so you can actually sit and enjoy this amazing view albeit, better from the flyer in my mind.

You're restricted to the front of the platform for obvious reasons so cannot access any of the bars and for $20 I would have thought the front bar could be opened up.

Expensive view."
,,Awesome Views of CBD at night!!!,5.0,,It was one of the best attractions in singapore indeed and it was worth spending 20 SGDs on this one.. Worth visiting at night when all the lights is on.. the timings are 10 am to 10 pm only..
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"Loved the view from the skylark. Singapore is truly amazing. Felt fabulous to see it from such a vantage point. Everything about Marina Bay Sands is amazing - shops, restaurants, casino, skating, boating through the shopping mall. Winderful!"
,,"Spectacular views, and a one of the most unique infinity pool!",5.0,,"Well.. for starters, if you are staying at the hotel, you get unlimited free entry to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark including usage of the infinity pool.

The night view of the place is spectacular and leaves you in awe. Unlike most other observatory deck around the world, this is not a covered arena... so if you are photographer.. there is no glass glare, etc as a distraction.

Staying at the hotel, I was up there just about every night, and even though the music from the rooftop bar was loud.. it wasn't bearable.

Using the infinity pool was an experience in itself.. as it really takes you to the edges, with just about a glass sheet separating you from the dropping down!

For outsiders, there is a fee of S$20, which is basically for a tour of the place. I would say, its a once in a lifetime opportunity, so pay and go, even though the price may seem steep. Suggested timing: its much of a personal choice, but the view at night is more spectacular.

For photographers, you can do blue hour shoots, and its simply amazing. Just get the right spot with your tripod on, and you will have some amazing memories to take back home!"
,,Great views amazing building,5.0,,"This is an amazing building to see and if you pay to go up to the skywalk you get great views of Singapore, the gardens and shipping bay."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"An absolutely breathtaking building with a superb view. But, like everything in Singapore it is expensive to go to the top deck, to have a drink up there or even to buy souvenirs. Still a lovely view though..."
,,Lovely!,4.0,,"Been here a few times and the views are just amazing as the hotel's architecture. I just wish they can do something to control the crowd, as there were instances whereby even non inhouse guests were able to go up. Not being anal here but there's just some people who wants to bring his whole village up there. The thought is nice but please reconsider.

At any rate, I wish this skyark will be well-maintained."
,,Great Views of Singapore and Bay,4.0,,Worth the money to go up and have a look at the views. We went up in mid daytime August and it was more humid on the viewing deck than outside on the marina bay walkway. Take an umbrella up ladies or wear hats as it is very open to the elements. Spectacular views. Would be great at night I am sure.
,,You got to do this once in your life,5.0,,"From hanging over the edge of the infinity pool to sitting in a jacuzzi with just 24 mm of glass separating you from a shear drop, it's a must."
,,Stunning place to view Singapore,3.0,,"Personally I found it as another spot to have a bird view of a city. To pay SG$20 for an entry is quite dear to be honest. When we asked the counter if we would be able to see the view when having a drink in the bar, she said no. Of course, I later found out that it was an incorrect information. If you would like to have a glass and looking out the view, DO take the opportunity to drink in the KU DÉ TA Restaurant. The security was very tight and quite annoying. However, the view has given all the credit back. The view to the harbour is absolutely terrific, with the bird view of the Garden by the Bay. Even though I am not a fan to be a typical tourist, I still recommend you to put this spot in your itinerary."
,,Spectacular piece of architecture,5.0,,I absolutely love everything about this building. You have to see it with your eyes to understand its presence. Such a dominating piece of architecture but in my opinion it works perfectly. Pay the $20 and go to Skypark - the view is mindblowing.
,,The world's most spectacular swimming pool atop the world’s craziest hotel,5.0,,"The real draw at the dazzling Marina Bay Sands resort is undoubtedly the spectacular Sky Park, which is situated on the world's largest public cantilevered platform, spanning all 3 towers and overhanging the north tower by more than 60 metres. With a length of 340 metres, the Sands Sky Park is longer than the London Shard (308 m / 1010 ft) or the Eiffel tower (324 m / 1,063 ft) if they were laid down.

It is the “raison d'être ici “ for the majority of tourists booking a room at this resort. I’ve stayed 2 days at the Marina Bay Sands and have to say that the Sky Park exceeded my expectations.

Apart from its fabulous 150-metre swimming pool (3 times the length of an Olympic pool) it features a landscaped tropical garden with real palm trees, whirlpools (on the Garden-by-the-Bay side), two upscale restaurants (Sky on 57 and Ku De Ta), a circular bar atop the observation deck (Ku De Ta), a chocolate and cheese buffet (The Chocolate Bar) and a Club Lounge with great pool and city views (The “Ku De Ta” - I was told it has no connection to its famous namesake on Bali).

Last but not least, the observation deck -situated on a platform which overhangs Tower 3 (the north tower) – is accessible to the public via a dedicated elevator (admission costs S$ 20 for adults and there is no time limit for visits). Best time to visit the observation deck are at dusk, when the sun sets over the city. It offers unparalleled 360-degree views over the entire city, the Gardens-by-the-Bay and the Singapore Strait, with views reaching as far as the Batam and Bintan islands in Indonesia on a clear day.

Be aware that there is no seating and no shade area (no parasols) on the observation deck, so make sure you pack a sun cream and a hat or a sun umbrella if you want to spend a longer time up there.

The spectacular pool is off-limits for non-hotel residents – the only access is through a separate lift from the hotel rooms and the staffed pool gate is opening only to guests bringing their pool card with them (each guest is issued with a pool keycard). Pool hours are 6am-11pm.

It is neither the world’s biggest pool (this title being held by a monstrous pool longer than 1 Km at the San Alfonso del Mar resort in Algarrobo / Chile, covering 20 acres) nor the world’s highest (that is the indoor pool of the Ritz Carlton Hotel at the International Commerce Centre in Hong Kong, located at the 118th floor) but it’s the highest pool of its size and the biggest at its height (200 m / 656 ft high, 150 metres long).

When you enter the Sky Park’s pool area, the views are breathtaking: the water apparently ends in a sheer drop, with Singapore’s skyscrapers rising behind the water’s edge. But swimming to the pool’s edge isn’t quite as risky as it seems at the first glance –when you’ve arrived there you’ll be able to breathe relaxed again: the water spills over into a lowered catchment basin -from where it is filtered and recirculated- and there is a double protection against falls for the odd swimmer who might backstroke over the edge ;)

Although reserved for hotel guests only, the pool area gets crowded around 9:30-10 am, so the best times to enjoy a swim are early in the morning (6:00-8:00 am)
- early birds have a definite advantage. If you visit the pool area late at night before closure (22:00-23:00), you can also take spectacular night photos from the pool’s edge. Bring your tripod and a wide-angle lens for best results.

This spectacular attraction is a must see in Singapore, whether you are on a business trip or just on a short stop-over in the Lion City. You won’t be disappointed.

,,must see if your are in singapore,5.0,,they gave is a senior discount for the elevator. It was a great place to view the city. the Lights at night are fantastic. this place is a must do. Ski the flyer and do this
,,"Great view, very overpriced",3.0,,"The view was great but at $20 per person i feel it was a bit overpriced. There is no shade at the top and hardly any seating so once we were at the top I felt fustrated couldn't sit and enjoy the view in the hot Singapore sun, glad we did it once but I would not go back again"
,,No 1 at your must-see places in Singapore,5.0,,"The Skypark at Marina Bay Sands offers breath-taking views on the city - the Bay, the Flyer, the Merlion, the Gardens, the sea. If you have to choose only one view-point, definitely choose this one! The views are spectacular!"
,,Amazing View,4.0,,An amaxing view of the city. Recommend day and night time viewing to experience both aspects of Singapore. If you stay at the hotel you can access this for free.
,,Great building but ......,4.0,,I had a great visit but visibility was not great up there with lots of smoke the day I went up. Would like more guilded tours of top as only three per day and was all booked up at 10am!
,,Amazing views!!,5.0,,"One-of-a-kind experience overlooking the beautiful city. The SkyBar is a good alternative to paying for the viewing deck tour, as you can access the viewing platform free from the bar/restaurant area. (you must order though to get up)"
,,It was OK!,3.0,,$20 per person to go up in a crowded lift to get to the top and have to contend with more people was a bit ordinary if you ask me. The views were great but really it is a bit of a steep price to pay. Would I go up again......probably not.
,,Sharkies,5.0,,My children absolutely loved it and seeing these big monsters so close to you is amazing. The place is a great day out and prices are really friendly
,,Amazing even for someone afraid of heights,5.0,,I am so glad I visited the Skypark. Tickets can be bought from basement level of marina bay sands. left hand side entrance. $20 for adults. The views from the top are breathtaking (and slightly terrifying lol) I cant wait to go back at saty there so I can use the pool
,,As far as you can see,4.0,,I was there during a clear day and the view was just amazing. You could even see the neighbouring country of Indonesia.
,,Great view from the top,5.0,,Great view from the top. Admission is included with stay of course. Nice bar on top also that has great view of harbor.
,,Too many people,3.0,,"Disneyland type atmosphere. Difficult to swim or relax in pool with all the people taking photos on cameras, phones etc. nice early in the morning or last thing at night."
,,Big trees with lights and colours,5.0,,"The viist to the bridge between the trees at 22 m was very nice. Too short, since it was for only 15 m to allow the people to hace access, but really a nice view of the Bay. By night it is a plus."
,,Not worth it,2.0,,The view from the Skypark is good...but then you can get the same from many other buildings in Singapore...
,,Don't waste your money,1.0,,"Cost $20 just to go up and look from a deck, unbearably hot in full sun. Unless you pay almost double for a 'tour' you don't get to go into the garden and infinity pool area. While its a impressive view, why not see it from the Singapore Flyer next door for only a few $ more where you tower high above Singapore, over double the height of the Marina Bay Sands? Flyer is gorgeous at late sunset as all the Bay lights twinkle on at 7.30ish. Marina Bay Sands is an impressive piece of architecture, but to appreciate it you need to be looking at it, not from it. Cable car is also a much better view of Singapore. If it's a sunset drink your after, forget Ku De Ta where your packed in like sardines and hit up for a minimum spend, and go across the Bay to Lantern Bar at top of Fullerton Bay Hotel, it's a gorgeous roof top bar around an infinity pool, with stunning views of the Bay, friendly relaxed atmosphere and great drinks menu."
,,Nice view when the weather is nice,4.0,,"It's a nice place to enjoy great if you want Singapore, mostly for the City view and the harbour view. You can also see the recently-completed gardens by the bay, especially for the evening and night view. For $10 singapore dollars per person, you can only access one side (1/3) of the roof top garden though, the other 2/3 are for hotel guests only."
,,Light and Sound show,5.0,,This spectacular night show of lights and music is great and shouldn't be missed. The syncranisation of music and light is spectacular.
,,somewhat disappointing,2.0,,"The view on Singapore is really fantastic, but you only have access to the end of the platform, hence no view on the swimming pool."
,,Great roof top bar with stunning view,4.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore this should be a must to visit. Enjoy the bar with the great view. On Saturday evenings you also can see a firework just in front of MBS. Drinks are nic, prices are high, so you have to pay for the location."
,,Marina Bay,4.0,,The best time was to visit the roof is at night. Best to take a picture of it from across the harbor. Not much to see inside. Need to be on a tour in order to see the swimming pool located on the roof and there is great view of the city from the roof.
,,"beautiful views, made me feel quite emotional",5.0,,"Expensive but really amazing views. Drinks etc.. are expensive too. Best time to go is late afternoon to see Singapore in daylight and sunset and in the dark, which is beautiful."
,,Good view,4.0,,"I didn't spend much time on the sky deck, but you could see the view of the city which was good though."
,,Not a bad view ..... But....too pricey!,3.0,,$20 to go to the top.... A little bit of a rip off.... Think the fee should include a drink at the bar!!!!
,,Great view !,4.0,,"Nice view on the gardens and on singapur and the place is not closed you can breath fresh air and if you are lucky you can see the infinity pool, that is amazing. worth a visit"
,,The pool is just disappointing!,2.0,,The swimming pool at the top is cram-packed with screaming kids!! Avoid at all costs!! Or maybe take a picture and leave. Not for swimming!! Restaurant mediocre at best..
,,Mind Blowing View,4.0,,The view is worth the SGD 20 entrance fee. best time to go is just after sunset - you still have some natural light to see the city skyline in natural light and then you also get to see the night sky and lights as it gets dark. the extra money for a guided tour of the infinity swimming pool is not worth it. the only issue is that they do not have any place for you to sit unless you want to plonk down on the wooden floor. definite must see. far better than the flyer. the ride up and down on the lift to the 56th floor is an experience.
,,Overpriced but Awesome..,4.0,,"When you travel all the way to see the Marina Bay Sands, its kind of a must do to get to the top. A bit pricey for just getting to the Skypark, but it offers amazing views of Singapore. It was a pity we didnt hv much time to go for a tour through the swimming pools and gardens on the top, but it seemed like there wasnt much to miss anyway.

Wouldnt say avoid or anything, coz theres no point in missing this out when u get all the way there, but it might be better if u just go to the bar n maybe hv a drink while enjoying the view."
,,"A incredible garden , pool and view",5.0,,"Even If you are not staying at Marina Bay Sands, you can buy a ticket to top floor, and enjoy the Garden, two restaurants and be jealous of that people in the pool . It´s a place to go for a drink or a dinner. Be prepared for queues, on weekends."
,,Spectacular views!,5.0,,"Must do attraction in Singapore - up there with a visit to Raffles.
Book a brunch at Ku De Ta up on the Skypark. Eat as much as you like buffet, plus delicious, freshly prepared light meals. It can also be booked with cocktails (recommend Bellinis) and with champagne.
Fantastic views across Marina Bay Gardens, Singapore and the Straits from the top of this amazing building."
,,Breath taking view,5.0,,"Located above the 54th floor, a full fledged garden with pools and restaurants. you can see almost the whole of Singapore. A nice photo taking point for all ages and groups. Although you can access a small portion of the top as a visitor. You will have to stay at this hotel to see the whole top garden area. Nevertheless, it was worth checking it out for only 20 Singapore dollars."
,,Pricey - but views are awesome,3.0,,"for 20$ adults (12$ kids), it was pricey. you don't get much other than entrance into the skypark, you can't even see the infinity pool. The views are amazing, but there is nothing up there - no place to sit, just a glorified snack bar with no place to enjoy your drinks. This leads to a ton of folks sitting down by the shaded part of the viewing area, and making it quite getto-ish in the evenings. This is a visit-once never-again type of thing. I wish they would make it more friendly, allow visitors to grab a drink, sit down, soak up the view. 20$ used to buy you at least that. :)"
,,Scary - great views,5.0,,Excellent views over the city! For everyone who isn't afraid of heights! One feels on top of the world!
,,Too steep to go high,3.0,,"The price to see the skyline of Singapore was too steep. Paid close to $30 USD for 2 and that is with AMEX discount. Skyline was fine has a small business district. You can see some part of the tourist attraction but on a cloudy day (in the summer), there's really nothing great about it."
,,You need a head for heights,4.0,,"Worth the ascent if a little pricey - totally mind blowing being so high above the city on a fast moving road. Never been anywhere like it, and better views than the flyer."
,,"Free views if you're cheeky, but I bought a drink",5.0,,"Go to Tower 3 entrance and say you want to buy a drink in the Club Lounge.

Pros:
-Fast lifts
-Free entry, but you're expected to buy a drink. I bought a Coke (S$8).
-Great views (your higher than the Singapore Flyer), but obstructed by the viewing area below.
-Sofas & tables (some undercover) or standup areas
-Toilets

Cons:
-No signage to indicate where Singapore sights are located, but you can see Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day."
,,on a deck of a flying ship....,4.0,,"buy entry ticket for SGD 20 at the basement, right side of tower 3, taking the lift to the top. Walk arround the deck and see the view of singapore, and sea with many tanker ship on the ocean. it is great to feel as if you are in a giant ship but flying...,better time to visit before sunset ,and after sunset can see the lighting view of garden by the bay ,see the flyer, .must come here."
,,view the city,4.0,,you cant enjoy the restaurant without staying in the hotel. moreover can have pleasant time with your partner on the terrace above the casino.... which is across the street.
,,Kinda must do!!,4.0,,"The viewing deck at the marina Skypark hotel is a kind of must when visiting Singapore. However, at 20 dollars (£10) for what is essentially a lift ride to the top then ten mins taking in the views of Singapore and taking a few pics...its a bit steep! My advice would be go at sunset this way you get great views but with the added benefit of magnificent glow over the city and beyond. Take a drink with you, the small kiosk and bar are also expensive!"
,,nice place to take photo,4.0,,very nice view. no long lines. no waitting. amazing.worth a look. you will go to the hotel then go to basemnt and buy the ticket.
,,Not bad,5.0,,The admission for observatory costs $20 and only for certain part of the observatory. I spent only about 20 mins there. So I think it is quite expansive. But it is a landmark of Singapore. It is a must see.
,,Skyway,4.0,,"Rather over the top. However the view from the top was worth while, although rather expensive. Shops, canal and water features inside the complex would appeal to the very wealthy!"
,,The best view,5.0,,Pay the $20 and go to the top of the Marina Sands Hotel - the view is the best in Singapore. Take the 7.30pm tour - book early - See the sun setting and WOW not to be missed.
,,Excellent,5.0,,We arrived on a hot and wet morning and headed into the malls to seek cover. They are incredible in themselves but going on to the top on the skywalk once the weather cleared was quite spectacular. The building is stunning and the views far and wide. Hard to beat.
,,A very worthwhile trip,5.0,,"A good stop off after 'Gardens by the Bay.' Simply walk across the bridge, head for tower 3 and take a lift to Ku De Ta on the top floor. The lady by the lift gave us a pass to show at the top which was checked by security - remember to get this before your ascent. We chose not to drink at Ku De Ta but took advantage of the view which is spectacular. As long as you realise you can't access the swimming pool part you will appreciate this for what it is - a must do activity on the tourist trail. Why not head to the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre afterwards for some excellent food."
,,It's quite OK,3.0,,"Not argue that the view from up there is outstanding and amazing, but the price was quite high compare to the activities and area. The floor was made with nice material, so it looked good.
Anyways, give it a try, but I think once is enough."
,,unbelievable experience,5.0,,"Take a lift to the top, get yourself a drink, see the view of Singapore. Simply memorable experience"
,,Good food good view,4.0,,"Book in advance, very busy, request table with a view. Great food, good service, fusion Asian food. Try the crispy calamari and the salmon"
,,View amazing,5.0,,"You have to go to the top and look over the city, the colours and lights around the city are beautiful."
,,small viewing area,4.0,,"we went up to the sky park as part of a night tour. I found the way they crammed people into the elevator was a bit like loading cattle cars. how many people can you fit in an elevator? I think we found out the sweaty way. the view was fantastic and worth the visit but the area open to the public was quite small. we could only walk around the pointy end and maybe 25 metres down either side. we couldn't see any pools or restaurants only the night club bar.. I would like to have seen more of the skypark, maybe the area is limited at night or something."
,,Amazing night view of Singapore!,5.0,,"I visited there on NDP to capture shots of jet fighters and fireworks. The view from above is great since it is different from the usual perspective on ground. I can see many attractions from here such as Gardens by The Bay, Singapore Flyer, the entire Marina Bay Street Circuit and also the skyline. At night, you can even see the lights from Clarke Quay and Singapore River."
,,"Excellent View, Very Crowded",4.0,,"The Skypark is a victim of it's own success, a fantastic attraction which everyone wants to go to, but so so busy!!
Views are great, go late in the day, you see the daytime views and watch nightfall with all the lights. The pool is massive but crowded, the infinity aspect makes it appear that it drops off the side of the building. Weather was good so the pool was warm. Also known as the sky garden, I am not sure why as there are not to many trees or plants there. Plenty of food and drink outlets if you want to chill with a snack and some drinks."
,,Amazing pool,5.0,,"Views are outstanding, hundreds of people at the skypark you feel like you are in a public pool no space to swim people just there to take a photo."
,,Awesome View,4.0,,The view is Just Awesome..Must see if u r in Singapore But he fee to the park is too much..it should be $5 And its quite awkward when it nears the swimming pool area.
,,Cool experience,4.0,,The view from the 57th floor was awesome although some parts of the area had restricted entry. The restaurants were too expensive.
,,Awesome Plane,5.0,,This is an amazing place. I would recommend travelers to Singapore to visit the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Its worthwhile your visit I would say.
,,Breathtaking view of Singapore!,5.0,,"The bird eye night view of Singapore from the Skypark is amazing. You can see the entire skyline, the floating stage, Singapore Flyer, F1 pit building and Gardens by The Bay from here."
,,Great view but very crowded,4.0,,"Perfect location of MBS gives the Sky Deck wonderful views of Singapore from the highest point… great view of the city skyline plus esplanade theatres. On the other end also get some good views of the Flyer, expressway and Gardens by the bay. Worth it to see Singapore from the Top!"
,,Sigapore is a great country,5.0,,Singapore is a great country every-time you visit you find an new attraction and that too world biggest or world's best. Sky pay is just amazing. Loved the infinite pool was unhappy as was not allowed to take a plunge into it as it was allowed for the gusts staying into it. Amazing view of Singapore from the top and best part was the top restaurant there. Had a beer amongst the fast winds blowing there.
,,All the way to the top,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands is quite something, with gondolas and a skating rink on the lower floors. We visited the Skypark and the views are absolutely amazing. Even looking at Marina Bay Sands from ground level is quite spectacular - three towers with a ship set right across the top of all towers, This has overtones of Vegas and even has a laser show with dancing fountains at night. The Skypark provides the opportunity to get an all round view of Singapore. Well worth a visit."
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,Quite simply a must do if you visit Singapore - it's taller than the Singapore Flyer and would get better views higher up.
,,Great Views,4.0,,Expensive to go up to the top but the views are good. You may want to consider getting a lunch reservation at the restaurant as you also get the same views but with good quality food. Business lunch buffets are on offer most days..
,,Nice aerial views of the Singapore city and the surrounding sea,3.0,,"Aerial Views are nice. However, there's no place to sit back and relax and enjoy the views for a little longer or so. So it's really upto you to decide if you wanna spend the money just to stand and see the views through he glass panel or not."
,,A Must see,5.0,,"We liked the views, pool, & bars, but it was too crowded, be better if time was limited, as difficult to find even a space near the pool, but worth the trip."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,If you are going here and want to have a drink make sure any men have long trousers on if getting near 6pm as they refuse entry. We went back the next day dressed appropriately and it was worth it. Loved seeing the infinity pool at the top and the view was breath taking
,,The best view of Singapore,5.0,,"You can see everything around for miles, it's the best place to go if you want to see Singapore and the strait."
,,Great view from above,5.0,,"This is one of the must visit places in Singapore. The view from the top is just amazing. The best time would be around 6 pm as you can take few photos from the top of the city. The view is just stunning as you can see the city getting darker and the lights starts to be on, it’s just amazing Singapore city from top of this building."
,,Good views,4.0,,"We went at night, timing our visit perfectly to see the ""super trees"" on gardens by the bay at 7:45 as these look very attractive from above. You get slightly ""wobbly"" legs if your afraid of nights, as you know that beneath you is nothing! If you can overcome clinging to the side, there are great views of the CBD and Singapore flyer (also a good thing to do). Efficient lift service to the 56th floor."
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Great viewing over Singapore. The shopping centre below is spectacular with a waterfall and the food hall is great value with lots to choose from.
,,Fantastic top view and stunning pool,4.0,,"I was staying at Marina Bay and, somi did not have to pay for fee to come up there. Very nice pool and varieties of breakfast. But too many people no privacy, seem everyone one wants to be in the talk of the town place."
,,Too Many Tourists,4.0,,"This undoubtedly has the best infinity pool around. The view is awesome and cannot be beaten. Unfortunately the throngs of tourists are suffocating, and I think that cameras should be banned from the pool itself as well. There is no place for 'serious swimmers' who want to work out to have a real swim during the day. i'd hate to have my photo incidentally posted up on a stranger's facebook page just because they have a camera there. Absolutely no privacy, so this is not a place for a celebrity to be incognito..."
,,"Gotta visit it, if only to catch the spectacular views around sunset",5.0,,"It offers a full 360 panaromic view of Singapore. Come around 5pm and get to see both a daytime view of much of its landscape the city and bay views and its sea views, leading into a wonderful sunset and a spectacular view of Singapore as the city lights come on."
,,Awesome View,4.0,,"Would certainly recommend to visit this place. Chargeable at $20 per person but worth it. Higher than Singapore Flyer, you get a better view of the city (Singapore Flyer charge $33). Entry is to a common deck area but not to their swimming pool side which is only for in house guests. Their is no time limit so you can take some good shots in day light as well as wait for the evening when city looks more beautiful. They also have a restaurant at the top (which certainly is expensive)."
,,Very expensive,4.0,,"I went to the top of Marina Bay Sands with some friends. The views were spectacular, however in order to avoid paying the $20 fee to get onto the observation deck, we travelled to the bar where one of us bought what was still an over priced drink. Do this if you are going to go up the towers."
,,Waste of time.,2.0,,"For some reason this country thinks that this thing is impressive or fantastic or something. It's just a tall building up in the haze overlooking office buildings. There is nothing historic or impressive to look at.If your a fan of office building architecture than this is for you.

They even want to charge you extra to do a tour of an overcrowded swimming pool just because it's there!!! It's like taking a tour group to your local swimming pool and standing around looking at people who can't swim. You have to be joking.

This place is indicative of most things we saw or did in Singapore, if your an idiot, mentally impaired or never been out of the jungle before in your life then this place would be great."
,,Bring your credit card,3.0,,"We went up to the bar on the roof as we'd been told that the views were spectacular. They were indeed but don't expect to have access to more than a tiny portion of the whole roof area unless you are a hotel guest or a 'member'. The drinks are extremely expensive but I guess if you only have the one and then enjoy the views (if you can get anywhere near the edge to see anything - this is a popular place to stand), it's probably worthwhile."
,,Great Pool but a little crowded,4.0,,"Fabulous pool, that you should visit for sunrise. Although this year on my visit it was quite crowded compared to the year before when i stayed in July."
,,Great view,4.0,,You get a great view of Singapore from the top of Marina Bay Sands. Well worth a visit. The weather was not great when we were at the top but we still got a great view.
,,You have to have a look!,5.0,,"This is incredible. The scale is mind blowing. High end shopping and dining, but great to walk around, and has fascinating walk way through to the Gardens by the Bay complex."
,,Absolutely stunning views,5.0,,"We arrived just before dusk, it was fantastic to see the city in the light and then to see the city come to life at night. If you can get over fact that you are 57 stories high, it's lovely to be able to sit back and enjoy the view."
,,Sands Skypark is beyond description.,5.0,,The hotel looks like a huge ship sitting on 3 tall pillars. At night there is a light show from underneath as well as above. The observation deck is great: you can see the bay and marina of Singapore plus a great deal of downtown. It is especially great near sundown and into night. Fabulous!
,,Highest Point to View Singapore City,4.0,,"Skypark is located on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands complex which include a hotel, casino, shopping mall (The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands) and next to the Art Science Museum. It also has Infinity Pool. But unless you are a hotel guest, the pool is off limit. If you feel like dining with with a view, there are Sky on 57 and Ku De Ta restaurant.

We (4 adultsmalls + 6 yo child) could see the beautiful landscape of Singapore including Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Marina Barrage, Helix Bridge, Marina Bay Floating Platform (where many events/festivals are held including Singapore National Day Parade) and many places of interests. We took many photos with superb background. It was a hot day when we visited Skypark and we didn't bring hats so we ended up buying hats which cost about SGD$20 each (its a nice souvenir though). If you go on a hot day, don't forget to bring hat as it can get very hot and glaring on top. Umbrella will be useful on rainy day although the wind is definitely very strong, and beware of lightning as you are indeed on top of the tallest building in Singapore.

If the view you are after, personally, I would prefer Skypark than attraction like the Singapore Flyer which more or less have the same offering but less view."
,,The Greatest view on the City,4.0,,"The view is amazing!!!

If you want to visite restaurans\bars you need to book in advance or stand in a long que on the first floor being ready that there will be no room for you.

During the day Skypark is very crouded, many people living in a hotel coming to swim in infinity poo, other tourist are buying the ticket to enter the territory of Skypark or just taking a free guiding tour throught it (3 times a day, lasting 15 minutes).

Be ready for lots of people, families with kids, no place for laying\sunbathing, sitting, or even for a pleasant swim (at 9^30 AM already crowded). The water in pool is too warm and with a huge amount of chlorine. Towels can run out, so you need to wait for them.

But the view worth it!"
,,Not worth the elevator trip,2.0,,"First it is pricy ($20pp) for a just a 'view' and then we didn't find any touristic info on the building itself or its construction or neither a location map showing you the landmarks that you see from up-there. The building is fantastic, however it is a better deal to look at it from a distance to appreciate the design. From the observation deck the view is smoggy, there is no shade against the burning sun and you can't really enjoy the building itself because it is below you. We are a bit disappointed and don't recommended it."
,,Awesome view of the Marina from the Sky park,5.0,,Best time to get on the sky park is around twilight hours in the evening when you can see the sunset.
,,Swimming in the sky,5.0,,"We were Hotel Guests at Marina Bay Sands so access to skypark was free. We certainly enjoyed the infinity pool and it's surroundings and did not feel the need to go onto the Sky deck to see even more stunning views and have to juggle for elbow space to take photos with others who had had to pay for that priviledge. The swimming pool has a child friendly area and an adults only area which is where one of us swam. Whilst there are ramps for a wheelchair user to access skypark there was no direct access to the swimming pool itself. There were plently of deck chair loungers to take advantage of the views either in the sun or shade and fresh towels when you needed them along with a full bar service should you wish. There were at least three eateries on this level (57th floor) and one night we chose to dine at Ku de Ta, offering modern Asian Fusion Food with stunning views, which also had an open air bar and nightclub to enjoy and was obviously 'the' place to be seen - my only gripe was that it was not smoke free"
,,Amazing and huge shopping mall,5.0,,"Lots of pricey brands such as Ferrari, Luis Vuitton and so on. Because it was raining, we decided to stroll inside the hotel and the mall. Also, there are quite a lot of places to eat, and there is a casino, where foreigners/ tourists don't have to pay an entrance fee otherwise, I believe it's about a hundred dollars."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,Don't miss out on this excellent experience. Marina Bay Sands is an iconic landmark building with a unique rooftop. Amazing views all round.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Great views of the city from the rooftop. It can get quite windy up there. Didn't bother going on the Flyer after seeing the views from the top of Marina Bay Sands.
,,A tip to go to the top for free or so..,4.0,,"I didn't stay at the hotel, but if you want to go up to the 57th floor For free .. Few steps From the tower 3 entrance, you tell the staff you want to have a drink only and they allow you. Once up there you can have a fruit juice for 10$ only :-)
However you are not allowed to the bridge below, and the swimming pool is only for hotel residents. But you can take lovely pictures. It was crowded over the night, and we decided to go back at daylight too."
,,Spectacular Views from Skypark,4.0,,"The views from the sky park are great, breezy . However, it can be really overcrowded with visitors sometime that you are unable to take a good picture from the best spot. Overall rating - nice to visit but not a must"
,,Unbelievable Awe Inspiring Views of Singapore!,5.0,,"You can easily gain access to the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark viewing deck as a hotel guest with a room key to access the 57th floor by inserting your room key once inside the elevator. Also, as a registered hotel guest, you will receive a pool pass that will get you a wrist band allowing you entry onto their 57th floor infinity pool, which also has spectacular views of Singapore Bay and the Singapore city skyline both during the day and at night until 11pm when the pool closes. Singapore comes alive at night in colorful glistening lights! The view atop Marina Bay Sands Skypark is not to be missed!"
,,Awesome views....,5.0,,Although not for the faint hearted this attraction is not to be missed. Make sure you go during the time where you can see the infinity pool too !
,,Amazing aerial view,5.0,,"Small fee of SGD5 to go up the Skypark. Not accessible when raining. We go up in the lift to the top and walk around, taking in the magnificient views of the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and the coastlines in the distance. Definitely worth the visit to see this iconic place recommended in Singapore tourist brochures."
,,Beautiful view of Singapore skyline,3.0,,"You can get a very beautiful view of the city skyline. However, unless you stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel you have to pay a fairly stiff fee, which makes it not that worthwhile. There are many tall buildings in the city where you can get similar views."
,,"Amazing view, not much else",4.0,,"The view at the sky park is amazing, however there is not much else to do here. If your planning on going to MBS to walk around, eat, club then i would suggest coming to the sky park. dont plan your day around it as there not much to do up there."
,,Another way to visit the Skypark,4.0,,"If you are not a guess of the hotel and wanted to go to the Skypark, you can visit the Ku De Ta either for a drink or a meal. A visit to the open bar is the cheapest alternative to the Skypark as the drinks are reasonable considering that you get a pretty good view too. I visited at around 7pm and it was crowded. There are kids there too, and they serve non alcoholic drinks as well. There is a good mix of people, mostly tourists. If you do not mind being watched while you eat, you can dine near the open bar which offer some great view while you dine."
,,Really a nice experience,5.0,,"Fantastic pool and skypark.A special experience to swim on the 57 th floor, in the worlds largest pool."
,,Great views !,5.0,,Brilliant views from the top - very reasonably priced and and not too busy ! Would recommend a visit -
,,too hot to visit at day time,3.0,,"We group of 4 booked the tour at 2 pm, the heat and hot really drove you insane. Maybe the night tour will be much cooler and with better view as well.
In general, this tour was not that special. From my side, you can get the same good view at Singapore Flyer or maybe just one of the Skyscrapers in the city.
The swimming poor is lovely, but it was just too crowd to walk around..
The most downside for this tour I would saw is the tour guide, he was leading a group of 30+ visitors outdoors without any microphone system equipped, plus his strong Singapore accent, I would not hear a word."
,,amazing views,4.0,,"Go for the views which are amazing - but don't expect much else.
There are good toilet facilities at the top but the viewing area is not very big or well planned considering how big the top of marina bay sands is & the cafe is small & basic with no seating.
You do have access to Ku Da Ta for a high end meal or drink - but I believe you need to book this first - as I saw some people being turned away at the enterence.
We were wanting to sit & have a coffee or a light meal up there - so the inadequate cafe was dissapointing - but the view certainly wasn't & that by itself was worth the admission."
,,Pricey View,4.0,,"First, make sure that you understand that ONLY A TOUR ticket will get you to the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel top deck. The tour is the same price as an elevator ride (awfully expensive for several seconds on the lift) to the observation deck, but must be booked in advance (get there early, and plan to kill some time at the mall waiting for your reserved slot!). But, don't miss the infinity pool! Hotel guests who are allowed to swim there appear to be headed over the side for a long fall onto the top of the Louis Vuitton geometric wonder-building built right on Marina Bay! Don't worry - there is a safety ledge you can't see for swimmers who may have spent too much time at the pool bar!

But, if you can't wait around for the hotel tour, you can still ride the elevator to the observation deck for an amazing 360 degree view of this incredible city, complete with close up photo ops of the Marina Bay skyscrapers, Singapore Flyer, Gardens By The Bay, and tons of cargo ships anchored offshore."
,,best attraction in singapore,5.0,,"skydeck with a guided tour is must visit place to go in Singapore.
right above the metro station , easily accessible by MRT .
its worth every dollar you spent to have a bird eye view of the city.
prefer going in the evening , since they dont have any covered area to sit."
,,Go for the stunning view,4.0,,"We were not staying at Marina Bay sands but only visited the sky park ( level 56 ) at night. Spent close to 45 minutes at the top and since it was a clear night, we had a great view of the Singapore skyline which is very beautiful. Could not visit the pool area as it was only for the hotel guests . They also take a photo of you at the ground floor and your photo, with Marina Bay Sands in the background, is ready when you reach the top. We bought the photo but the price is quite steep. But overall a great place to get a birds eye view of the entire city and would recommend this over the Singapore Flyer , if you have time only for one."
,,wonderful view,4.0,,"Sky park is located on the 56 th floor of the Marina bay sands hotel and at a cost of 20sgd per person one can get a birds eye view of Singapore eye , merlion, gardens by the bay the bldgs around the bay the Singapore river and adjoining area. the experience is worth the money spent. One can reach the Marina bay sands hotel by MRT and the station is just below the hotel.Best time to visit is just before sunset and spend an hour till , the only problem is there is no place to sit , either you have to sit on the floor or keep standing."
,,fantastic view,5.0,,This is definitely one of the best places to go in Singpore. You will get a fantastic view over the city and the inner harbour.
,,"Stunning views, a memorable experience",4.0,,"This offers fantastic views of Singapore and the Gardens. The infinity pool is amazing and at night the bar offers a different experience and view, though very noisy. A popular place but not busy all the time so worth making the effort to get in. Take your camera."
,,See the view,5.0,,We went to the top of the Skypark at the time of the pollution scare. What a view! I wonder what it is like on a clear day! Drinks expensive but atmosphere worth it.
,,A superb aerial view of Singapore.,4.0,,"Thankfully, I got free tickets through a purchase I made in the mall itself. It is especially beautiful during sunset where you see the bright Singapore city lit up, especially the central business district which never sleeps.

On an especially good and clear day, you could even see the length of the East Coast of Singapore and be impressed with the lovely modern architecture Singapore has to offer."
,,Great view of the city,5.0,,They have guided tour of the hotel in the mornings and in the evening which takes you upto the Infinite Pool. The view from there is amazing. Overall a nice experience
,,Great dinning and viewing experience,5.0,,"My friends who are based in Singapore brought me at the marina bay skypark. We dine at Kudeta restaurant. It was amazing experience. It was fun hanging out with friends where you can also see the whole Singapore up there. Overall, great experience! i would like to go back here with my loved ones."
,,Awesome Views!,5.0,,"It is definitely worth the price of admission to go up ! The 360degree view is out of this world. The bar on top outdoors is very nice... The sitting is limited , a few bar stools with tall tables."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,3.0,,"The right spot for the bird view the city landscape nearby Marina Bay. If you no stay at Sands Marina Bay, you got to paid to access to Skypark.

The swimming pool here will give you a unique experience since the city is actually below you.

Here you can see the nearby attractions, from flyer, art museum, Garden by the Bay and so on."
,,They don't allow public to the Sky Park if it is raining heavily,4.0,,I have visited Marina Bay Sands Sky Park 3 times and all the three times I have never regretted for money I paid. The entrance fee is $20 per visit. They don't allow public to the Sky Park if it is raining heavily.
,,Awesome Stay !!,5.0,,i stayed here for 3nights wish i could have stayed longer.The bar on the roof top and sky park pool are so amazing. pool get quite crowded at times but view in the morning is to die for...Absolutely Beautiful!!
,,Exciting Fun!,5.0,,"We got access to the park by virtue of the fact that we stayed at the hotel....I am not sure what a day pass costs or if you can even buy one - but you need to experience this place at least once as it is unique and the views are unparalleled - day and night. Lots of pools, food and fun await you here. Worth a look see."
,,Nice venue,4.0,,"We had a very nice visit with friends in May, the weather was not great but the food and service wad"
,,If you like crowds....,3.0,,Nice view. But all a bit follow the herd. Gotta do it. Once is enough. Lots of people milling around a ground level / hotel lobby so at Skypark and at Ground Level all very hectic.
,,Outstanding views,5.0,,"Recently visited Skypark, level 56. Awesome view of Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore River all the way to Clarke Quay etc. Well worth the visit and cost, just to be there"
,,Great view and bar,4.0,,"For such a view, you just have to pay... The building is sort of out-of-this-world and the bar on top (you are not allowed to go to the pool, which is only for hotel guests) with cool music, is of course busy and expensive. However, you do not have to pay to take the lift up, if you tell security at the bottom floor, that you will go there, other from those people who visit the sky park for the same view, who pay 20 sing dollar for getting this view.
All in all, enjoyable and something to write home about."
,,Very Nice Hotel ... Skypark Cool But Crowded,4.0,,"Booked into the Marina Bay Sands primarily because of the skypark, which looked so amazing on the internet. We did love this hotel, but only went to the skypark once as it was pretty crowded. Still, the infinity pool is really out of this world."
,,"Abit overpriced, but first timers should do it",3.0,,"The Skypark at MBS is abit overpriced. The fee is $20SGD but there is nothing to do there, except to enjoy the view.

The park can be access through from the hotel. There is no shade in the Skypark itself, and no access to the lounge Kudeta. They have little cafe with refreshment but no seatings.

Its great if you are first timers, as the view will blow your mind. But once you have been, personally I wont visit again."
,,On top of the World!,4.0,,"My first time going up to the skypark which is 57 storeys high above the ground! Wonderful experience to witness the awesome cityscapes from high above, the only regret was no beautiful sunset, however I was blessed with nice blue hour and witness the laser and iLight show from Marina Bay Sands (starts from 8pm).

And 1 more thing that I missed out was the tour visit to the infinity pool, as the tour time were 10am, 2pm and 9pm only. I didn't wait for the 9pm tour as I have to rush for another laser show shoot under the Helix Bridge.

Will definitely come back again, hopefully next time can enjoy drinking wine at Sky on 57! =D"
,,"Fantastic Hotel, Great View of Singapore",5.0,,Was amazed at the size of this fantastic hotel. Went right up to the top to take photos and the view of Singapore was brilliant. A must to see.
,,cool place for sunset,4.0,,just another cool place for having a sunrise in the city. but the price quite expensive just for take a walk rounding the deck.
,,Stunning,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing. The building was a masterpiece, and the view from the top was as you can imagine, 56 floors up, was just incredible. Looking down on the Singapore Flyer. Our only criticism was the price of the photo's, which we didn't buy."
,,WOW - AWESOME VIEW,5.0,,I was quite blown away - feeling on the top of the world - an amazing view and one marvels the technology which has gone into making of this wonderful place. The infinity pool connecting the bar and the restaurant gives you a high as one can enjoy a choice of the best wines and gourmet food up there..
,,Loved it,4.0,,"Though the skypark was packed with so many people, the area is amazing. To be so high up in a massive pool is just mind boggling. Glad to of made the effort to visit such an amazing place"
,,This is just a must!,5.0,,"If you are not staying at the hotel it costs $50 per person, but well worth it just to swim in the pool"
,,"Great view, also a marvel to behold from the ground.",4.0,,"We went up to the bar for a quite expensive drink, but it was one of those things that you do to enjoy an Amazing view. You can see into the skypark pool area but only guests can go in. One of the reasons I didn't stay here was I read that anyone could pay to get into the pool area, but that is not the case. Maybe next time!"
,,Chocolate buffet marina bay sands,4.0,,"We don't stay at the Marina Bay Sands, but booked into to their chocolate buffet on the 57th floor.
You had to walk past the infinity pool to get to the buffet, and the pool was still packed at 8:00 PM. You have to pass security when you get out of the lift, and they check that you are booked in before they will let you pass. No real problem.
The buffet was lovely, with so many choices. Even a chocoholic like me can only eat so much chocolate. We thoroughly enjoyed this, and only had a light din before we went."
,,stunning,5.0,,stunning...but a bit too crowded... Go in the early morning or in the evening (before 11)...otherwise go to the expensive Ku De Ta to have a drink and dance with the beautiful view
,,Marina Bay,5.0,,We were amazed at the size of this fantastic hotel. We went right up to the top to take photos and the view of Singapore was brilliant. We had watched the documentry of when the hotel was being built so it was nice to see the the finished thing. A must to see.
,,Not tworth the money,2.0,,The sky deck has a great view however you cannot sit anywhere without paying more. The drinks & food are not good value for money & you can't swim in the pool. Go once never go back.
,,Very crowded,4.0,,The Marina Bay sands complex is large & crowded. Believe the reviews when people say you have to wait for everyting. The trip to the Skydeck will cost . A diet coke will be $20 so it is an expense trip for a view on a cloudy day. So pick your time.
,,Awesome Hotel.,3.0,,"I dont normally describe something as awesome, but to me, the design of this hotel is just that. Absolutely stunning. Fortunately, you dont have to stay there to be able to admire it. We didnt but were able to get to the top and have a drink in the bar / restaurant on the 57th floor. but to swim in its infinity pool also on the 57th floor, then yes you do have to stay there. go see and judge for yourself."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"The skypark is on the top of Marina Bay Sands, a huge hotel in small country. Relaxing when you're in infinity pool area, you can see Batam island also from here, lovely place with stunning view of Singapore. At the skypark in the afternoon, the sun burn you indeed."
,,don't waste your money,1.0,,"don't waste your money, go to the Ku De Ta bar, that will grant you the same view with no fees... of course you will be forced to ""enjoy"" a good beer in the open roof bar... and no waiting lines"
,,What a view!!,4.0,,Great overviews of Singapore. Brilliant French style pastries and coffee on the ground floor. Next to Gardens by the Bay so a great half day.
,,Stunning views! Must visit!,5.0,,"We were lucky enough to stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The skypark access is free if your a guest so we made the most of this super hotel and visited the Skypark during the day, evening and night. Views are superb! Would highly recommend it!"
,,Magnificent night view of Singapore city,4.0,,"We went up there at around 7:30 pm on a weekday, just to avoid the hot summer sun. It's worth paying S$20 for the trip up there where you can see a some 270 degree view of the city by night -- the Bay below, the laser night show and the harbour beyond. A weekday visit is recommended to avoid the crowd.

Can get back to the hotel's basement level and enjoy a light dinner there without having to spend a lot in the hotel restaurants."
,,Massive structure,4.0,,"You can walk through limited parts and it is worthwhile seeing this at night to see the majestic tall columns. It is very busy, but you can wander through the Shoppes nearby. Allow yourself plenty of time to wander."
,,Loved it!,5.0,,$20 and well worth it as the views are stunning! I wasn't planning on a visit but had a couple of hours to spare and so decided to visit. Enjoyed an expensive drink at the bar but it was worth it to take in the views. I would recommend.
,,Restricted viewing and costly,3.0,,"The trip to the skypark costs $20.00.
You only have about a third of the top floor deck available.
Most of the area is open only to hotel guests and visitors to the Ku De Ta bar.
On the day we were there it was searingly hot, and it was only about 10.30 am! Needless to say we did not last long.However views are stunning if you are into photography.
Probably would not visit again.
A little confusing finding the way to the Sky Park, and the area is incredibly crowded, as the complex houses a Casino (say no more)"
,,Amazing view - restricted access,3.0,,"Wonderful view! great roof top bar and restaurant! Go during the evening to avoid the scorching sun. Be aware that access to the whole rooftop is restricted, and if not a guest of the hotel your SkyPark entrance fee will only get you to 1/5 of the top - you will not get close to the infinity pool or other amenities."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Outstanding views and ambiance, very busy however. One of those places you simply have to experience for yourself"
,,great views,4.0,,It cost $20 each to go to the top but were not allowed near infinitity pool. Views were wonderful from the top so we didnt go on the skywheel. Marina Bay sands was wonderful to look around and the casino was good although it was a nuisance having to show passport both going in and leaving
,,Out of a film,3.0,,"The hotel is massive, looks like something from a futuristic film. Paid and went up to the sky deck, views are fantastic!!!! Only problem I had is that the bar on the viewing area deck, staff will not let you enter if you have any kind of shorts on....their loss"
,,The Park in the Sky,4.0,,"Was it worth the wait, yes I guess so. Be aware there are tours which you can take which will let you see the whole Sky Park.
They were all full by time we got there so could only see one end of the Sky Park. The views are worth it, and have one drink while your there and enjoy the views."
,,Amazing views!,5.0,,"We weren't sure whether to choose the Singapore flyer or the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. The Skypark was slightly cheaper and a lot taller than the flyer so you can actually look over it. The views are amazing and the infinity pool looks like it would be amazing too unfortunately it is only for guests of the hotel. You can take as much time as you like to look around the views which felt good not to be rushed we even took time for an ice cold drink at the top and relaxed in the views! They also offer a couple of tours a day which takes you across the whole of the deck which spans the three towers, we didn't have time to participate in the tour but have heard from other tourists that it was worth the wait!"
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a MUST GO,5.0,,"You may not be wanting to stay in that beautiful hotel in Singapore for various reasons but a visit is worth it. Especially the Skypark gives a fascinating night view of Singapore. You might have taken the Singapore Flyer during the day, but for the night view, this Skypark is the best. The ambience at the Skypark is just exhilirating and they take you by a lift up there in seconds....DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!"
,,Outstanding views of Singapore,5.0,,Its worth it to go up top and see the views from the sky deck. The adjacent shopping mall is one of the nicest I've ever been in
,,The view from the top of this iconic building is amazing,4.0,,"The view from the top of this iconic building is amazing but on a particularly hot day there isnt a spot of shade to be found. though the view is great there is just open decking, a souvenir shop and a bar. was a bit bored after a few minutes."
,,What a marvelous architecture,5.0,,"The cost to get on top of this superb piece of archictecture was well worth it. Getting on this ""ship"" shaped structure nad taking pictures of Singapore harbour and beyond at this height, was a great experience."
,,An Engineering Marvel With a view!,5.0,,"The title says it all. The skypark is the one feature we went to Singapore to see. It did not let us down. 2 days there was great. We wish we could have had several more days to explore the city.
But it was great just relaxing up there looking at he city from that angle"
,,Good view,3.0,,"U can see Indo from here, Maldives from here.. its a good view but not worth the money. Like whats the point of going up there and just get photos and all?"
,,A must,4.0,,"We went up to the top with our two kids and another family of four. At a cost of $20 for adults and $14 for kids it as going to be very expensive. We decided to get up to the observatory another way for significantly less cost.
The views are spectacular. The very best way to get and instant orientation of Singapore and then to plan were to go."
,,Great views but really expensive,4.0,,We were lucky to have quite a clear day after all the haze. Also hardly any people up there for a Saturday afternoon. Views are spectacular. Cost us $54 for 3 of us to enjoy our 15 minutes. Bit pricey but we did this instead of Singapore Flyer. Dont think you'd need to do both.
,,Over the top,3.0,,"Cost as non guest is $20 adults $15 child to get to top for view ,average value but worth it,many tourists can get very cramped."
,,Cool experience. Amazing view,2.0,,Well we can chalk this one off the list. We got pictures. Paid out the butt for cocktails and got to sit for a few minutes to take in the view. Walking around was amazing up there..for me it's a One and Done experience. Been there done that.... Next...no need to return.
,,Chocolate Heaven,4.0,,"Treated ourselves to the ""chocolate bar"" a chocolate lovers dream. Operates every evening from 8 pm until midnight. A Chocolate Buffett with all things chocolate on the roof top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Price includes trip up to the rooftop, all you can eat chocolate desserts, tea,coffee or hot chocolate, beautiful views!"
,,Quite a View,4.0,,"Had a day in Singapore between flights. Unfortunately at time of our visit it was a little hazy and perhaps not the best view. That said was still a worthwhile visit.

View from the top is amazing with much more potential on a clear day. Again we could not do the guided tour due to time constraints as it only runs at certain times. This would be well worth doing if more time was available.

You can spend as little or as much time as you like at the top with plenty of room to walk about."
,,Beautiful place to enjoy night view of Singapore city center,5.0,,"I really like the view from the skypark, it is really beautiful and you can enjoy nice cool breeze at night. I don't like though the crowds which I think is overly packed most of the time."
,,Great view from up here!,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an icon - definitely worth going up to the Skypark for a view of the city and the harbour! Every time you see the hotel's unique silhouette on TV you'll be able to say you've been there!
,,Impressive place,5.0,,I really enjoyed being at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Amazing view - great location and highly recommended.
,,unforgetable view on Singapore,5.0,,"An experience not to be missed if you are going to Singapore.
You go up on 56th floor of a spectacular building and you enjoy the best view you can have over Singapore.
Additional you may visit the swimming pool for an amazing experience or have a wonderful cocktail-with-view on the terrace.
Photo or video camera is a must, you will get really spectacular shots!"
,,Glorious views,4.0,,"Located on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Skypark is an open-air observation lounge with the best aerial views of the city. It's open till 10pm, and perhaps makes sense to visit late evening for clear views in daylight, and also witness sunset and night views, if you have 2-3 hours to spare. There are 2 restaurants as well - and it seems if yo're dining at KU DÉ TA , access to the skypark is free. Access to the famous infiinity pool is restricted to hotel guests only, but its worth joining a guided tour (watch out for tour timings telephone : +65 6688 8826 ) that allow selective access to such areas. Definitely worth a visit."
,,Better than Singapore Flyer,5.0,,You need to book in advance to have proper guided tour and get access to the whole area. Guide is included in the ticket price but without the guide you can't access to the whole area
,,Awesome skyline view,4.0,,Wonderful experience to be on 'top of the world'. Can spend more than an hour taking snaps and enjoying the scenic beauty. The swimming pool is literally one of its kind and gives a truly amazing experience. Small palm trees and few floral collections also add to the beauty. Must visit preferably when its not sunny/rainy.
,,Paradise :):):),5.0,,"Every Singaporean Tourist must visit this place especially at night time. The spectacular Singapore Skyline view from 56th level is mind blowing. It really cannot be described in words.

There is also a Wonderful Light and Sound show which happens at night, Sands sky park is not a right place to see that though.

There is a ticket to enter Sky Park which can be purchased on the spot. Prior reservations are advisable as you may not grab a ticket during peak times.

There is a cafe and a Souvenir shop also to bring memories back home ;)"
,,Swimming at the Top of the World,5.0,,"You can't enter the pool unless a guest, but there is a small observation platform for the public near the elevators at one end (tower 3). If you are a guest, get their early as seats near the pool fill fast."
,,Swimm in the clouds,5.0,,Very nice experience. Try the down and the sunrise. At sunrise nobody is there but you began to change black and white to colour step by step...
,,A tall-ish building with an observation deck.,3.0,,"Unique. If you're at Marine Bay Sands, take 30 minutes and go up. Great views of the Bay and City. There is a fee, but I forget how much."
,,Busy Skypark,3.0,,It looks spectacular and is a marvellous feat of engineering (who would have thought to build a boat on top of 3 towers?) but not exclusive to residents - too many noisy visitors and having to wear cheap armband cheapens the whole experience
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,Well worth a visit for the view which is sensational. We timed our visit to see the view in daylight and also as the colourful city lights came on. Certainly worth a look!
,,GOOD PLACE.,5.0,,"This building is so high that my friend could get the Digi signal cause we went to Singapore From Malaysia. Now is this high. This is higher than the Singapore Flyer. There is also free WiFi here which is good. You have to wait till it is dark and then you can take amazing photos form here. There is also a shopping here as well as food,Good place to visit. Even though i didn't stay there i think it would be a good place to stay."
,,Exquisite Indulgence,5.0,,"If you want to understand the lavish culture of Singapore, go up here. Sometimes, you just have to bring yourself to higher grounds to see the big picture."
,,nice views day and night,5.0,,"i was staying at the hotel, so had lunch here and went for a swim, wonderful views and great music at night (due to club next to pool)"
,,Perfect,5.0,,"The view was beyond words. you will enjoy then skycrappers. at the time i was there, there are too many visitors in the pool and thus it was not really appealing to get in there and swim."
,,Feels like you're king of the world!,5.0,,"Pay a small fee, go up a really fast elevator and you're there.
An excellent near 365 degree view of the city of Singapore. Day or night, there's sights to enjoy.
Spend at least a good 30min up there before coming down.

It can get busy on weekends beware."
,,By far the only reason to stay at Marina Bay Sands.,5.0,,"The hotel itself was incredibly poor service and I wouldn't recommend an extended stay there.

However the Skypark is just sensational. Based on my experience during the day I would only give 3-4 stars, this was because during the day it was just so busy, screaming kids everywhere, even in the zone dedicated to adults (no children allowed), and hardly room to swim in the pool.

But taking into account the atmosphere and experience you get at night it has to have a 5 star review. The pool is much quieter and peaceful with an incredible view of the lit up city."
,,Cool,5.0,,"the food, the atmosphere and the view, the music is also cool, but the security guard did not allowed diners to go to the skypark deck ..."
,,Combine the 2,5.0,,This and the water park is a great 1/2 day with little cost and much too see add a Bum Boat ride to Clarke Key and you have filled in a large part of the day.
,,A superb 360 degree panoramic view of Singapore c,3.0,,The view was super from the top of the tower. However the ticket to skypark was way too expensive. We enjoyed the food at Ku De Ta restaurant...but again expensive!
,,Really nice view of the city,3.0,,"Maybe its just me, but I didnt think it was worth the 20 dollars each just to see the view. Dont get me wrong it is a very nice view from the top of the hotel. But unless you take the guided tour all you can enter is the viewing area...no pool or the other 80% of the top. The tour doesnt cost any more but it fills up quickly."
,,Nice view,5.0,,You should visit skypark based on the weather..Its closed if its raining. Make sure you get a free trip around the swiming pool.It has got specific timings when they show around.There is restaurant up there. Good time is to go around 6 pm onwards so that you can enjoy both view Daylight as well Night view. There is no place to sit..so you have to stand or sit on the steps or in the restuarant.
,,Worth Every Penny,5.0,,"It only cost $38 to eat all the chocolate sweets you could eat...very rich but extremely good quality. The service was fabulous and the view from the top is amazing. It was worth going just to see the view and the fantastic pool. Make sure your you book as it can get quite busy and try not to eat too much before you go. The restaurant is open from 8pm-12am and they only serve sweets that are chocolate. You also get tea, coffee or hot chocolate provided or you can order drinks. The tea they use is also good quality tea. Nothing cheap about the whole experience. Before you go up to the top floor make sure you get your pass from the foyer so that they will let you in."
,,fabulous views,5.0,,The views at sunset are fabulous as the sun drops and the lights over Singapore come on. $20 to go up on deck. Dress well and have a cocktail in the bar. Great photo opportunities
,,Great view from the top,4.0,,The view from the top is amazing and one must visit this place specially at 6 o clock so that you can take few photos from the top of the city (specially of Garden by Bay ) then view stunning city once lights are on as it keeps getting darker.You would love to see vibrancy of Singapore city from top of this building.
,,Great View,5.0,,"Was great places to see beautiful of Marina bay area, this is it 'Skypark' we can see most of Singapore with out walk around , especially in the evening see laser light' the best one !"
,,Worth it.,5.0,,Probably one of the most visited spots in Singapore and definitely worth everyone checking out and soaking in the Singaporean heat with a beer and a lovely view.
,,Impressive,4.0,,"The view from there is amazing. But the ticket is so expensive. It costs 20 SGD. The view should be very great at very dark night. I could see the durian dome and many main buildings from there. Unfortunately, I reached there around 6 pm. I actually wanted to wait for the sky to get dark but had to get down to other places so I missed it T_T"
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,I wouldn't waste your money going up to see the sights if you can see through all the smog then maybe you will get a nice photo. The cost to go up and then they try & slug you a further $50 for the photo they take is quite frankly a rip off. Most people go up to view the pool & bar area which you cannot access anymore unless you are staying at the hotel or go at a designated time (which isn't made aware to people until you arrive).
,,Spectacular View of Singapore,4.0,,"Went up 6:30pm and stayed there till 8pm amazed me. Indeed its beautiful and as we witnessed its beauty from daytime to twilight time and night time...its stunning. The views were spectacular. This is a must for me for all those visiting this fine city.

The Wonderfull Light and Water Show is a big plus to this attraction and it s for free.

Apart from the expensive entrance fee in going up to Skypark, another thing that I didnt like was that they do not allow visitors to sit on the floor. Its nice to stayed there for awhile to relax. I think its their way of forcing visitors not to stay longer as visitors were limited to i think.

The Skypark is on the 56th floor and there s a bar on the 57th. We were sharing the same views so I think if you intend to relax you can go to the bar instead."
,,Great view but overpriced,3.0,,The view was amazing but the price was ridiculous. The only way to justify is to actually stay at the hotel and visit the Skypark as included in your stay. Otherwise it's not worth it.
,,"Love the pool, jacuzzi and the amazing view",5.0,,"I have stayed here previously and always enjoy the hotel. I love the infinity pool, jacuzzi and amazing view. Also enjoyed the Laser show."
,,Stunning Views,5.0,,Well worth the trip - the views are incredible and the laser show is great. Even if you can't get on the tour just go to the top to see the amazing views.
,,a guided tour,5.0,,this building was magnificent and the views from the top were awesome ..although we did not visit any of the shops the building is a terrific momument and can be seen from any place in singapore.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is a must visit, if in Singapore. The best time is in the evenings when the sun doesn't beat hard. Amazing views of Singapore from top."
,,Simply amazing!,5.0,,"No words can really describe it - the view is just stunning from the top! If you come to Singapore you have to come to Marina Bay and then travel up the top of the skypark or the ""cricket pitch'!"
,,Similar to the Singapore Flyer,5.0,,"We went to the Skypark in June, 2013. Our entrance was free as we stayed at the hotel. Overall, it was very similar to the Singapore Flyer re: views. If you are going to do one, I would recommend the Flyer. However, the skypark is a good experience for sure if you want to do both. Be sure to bring your camera and sunblock (no cover up there and you can burn very quickly). The nearest MRT is the 'Bayfront Station'."
,,Tacky,2.0,,"We went up to the bar on the top for a drink and found it tacky,staff not interested in looking after visitors. Did not stay."
,,Unique but a bit over the top.,4.0,,Must see to experience what Singapore has achieved. Brand new with a billion dollar Disney type feel. But truly unique and environmentally great.
,,Another been there done that moment.,3.0,,"Sure I loved the view, the giant storm clouds rolling in providing great photo op's but that was about it. 20 SGD for an elevator ride. An hour of photos. 10 SGD++ for a beer -thankfully the skies opened up and we were kicked out. KuDeTa ...pretentious."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"Well worth visiting the marina Bay Sands Skypark. I didn't realize Singapore was so large. The sky gardens were booked out, but we could see the area fro the Skypark. They have an infinity pool which would be amazing to swim in. The restaurant area was great, if only to have cocktails. a must when visiting Singapore!"
,,WOW!,5.0,,An absolute MUST DO on any holiday check list in Singapore! The view is breathtaking and it is just simply amazing thinking about the architecture that went into the design and building of the Marina Bay Sands. Must have a cocktail or two while taking in the view.
,,A head for heights!,5.0,,An exhilerating experience as I rode the elevator at high speed to the 56th floor of the Sands Skypark to the observation deck. Great coffee at KuDeTa before taking numerous photos of the city from up in the clouds! This visit is a 'must' for all travellers.
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,The view from the pool is simply breathtaking. A must see and do. Great service from the friendly pool staff.
,,No sitting on the floor!,3.0,,"I visted the Skypark recently, and while there is probably no disputing that the attraction is worth a visit for the views it offers - I feel that certain aspects of its management need some serious re-consideration.

After a long walk around the Marina Bay area, I went up to the Skypark. Feeling a little tired, I decided to sit on the floor to rest while enjoying the view. Suddenly, the Skypark security approached me and said that I could not sit on the floor. Naturally, I asked why? He said that ""it's for safety reasons"". I was simply puzzled with this. The Skypark was not at all crowded at that time, and I was not even obstructing any passageway nor the movement of visitors. Apparently, it was not only me, but the security personnel also told a few other visitors sitting on the floor to stand up.

Why are visitors not allowed to sit on the floor of the Skypark?

Perhaps the Skypark management do not want visitors to stay too long by just sitting on the Skypark area. Perhaps they are concerned when too many visitors sit around and obstruct the movement of other visitors.

I can understand these reasons, but I think there needs to be some flexibility in whatever rules that they have. If the Skypark is not crowded and visitors sitting on the floor are not causing a nuisance to others, why just chase them away?"
,,Great to visit,3.0,,"The view is great but you have very restricted access to certain areas unless you have paid for executive rooms, very expensive. Do the sight seeing but stay in at Clark Key it is better value."
,,Pricey but great views,4.0,,"They charge and arm and a leg to ride up 58 floors to the top, but the view is quite fantastic in both directions. (If you take a drink at the bar, they will waive the fee..ask before you pay the fee.) It is an extraordinary perspective on one of the world's greatest cities."
,,Wow - a swim on the top of the world!,5.0,,"Have never seen anything like this before. An infinity pool on the 57th floor of a skyscraper, looking over the Singapore skyline. The pool was fun, service was great, plenty of lounge chairs & towels, and many life guards watching over the kids."
,,Brilliant view from up above,4.0,,"There are a few places in Singapore you have to go to for a brilliant view of the city skyline from above, Level 44 at MBFC, 1 Altitude at OneRafflesPlace to name a few. The MBS SkyPark is my favorite. 360 degree view of the city. KuDeTa is just round the corner for some evening drinks and chat with friends. There an infinity pool which unfortunately is for hotel guest only. But that doesn't stop us from ogling at the awesome sight from the pool."
,,6 times and counting!,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and I am forced to take my friends/ family around through the usual hotspots but the one place I never tire of is the Skypark. The best time to go is at twilight- you see Singapore by day as well as by night and the two views are different-at 1945 hours, the gardens by the bay has a sound and light show you can see from the top (not hear) followed by the laser show by the Marina Bay sands on the other side of the deck at 2000 hrs! So you get a lot more from the single visit! Some mean official people insist you don't sit but you can stay as long as you want to- so that makes it worth the while."
,,awesum place in Singapore,5.0,,Brilliant place.... dont miss this place in Singapore.....at 57th floor the swimming pool is just too good ....excellent view.... excellent staff ....
,,Nice view,4.0,,A good respite from all the shopping at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes...gives visitors a 360 degree view of the city
,,Nice but hardly worth the money,3.0,,"You have a nice view, but actually it is not worth paying for it as it is far from being something really special. One has to admit that mangement of Marina Bay Sands does an excellent job to promote the building as a global senasation."
,,Wow! Incredible,5.0,,Amazing views over Singapore at night. You must visit the nightclub! the views sobered me up - totally unexpected
,,"Pricey, but the view is priceless",4.0,,"Great panoramic views of the bay, docks and city. Not that cheap to enter, but where else can you get this view?"
,,Views plus Heatstroke,3.0,,"Gives terrific views ( for $20 ) but it's very exposed and there's really no where to hide from the sun. We only stayed about 15 minutes as it was unpleasantly hot, but would be ok for great night views of Singapore."
,,Stunning views but...,4.0,,Stunning views but too many people and the sense of exclusivity is lost with too many screaming children everywhere....
,,Impressive,5.0,,"what a view from the roof terrace (have dinner in the restaurant on 57th floor, really recommended). Sigapore at its best, and creating a new landmark on its territory. Must have seen if you go to Singapore!"
,,Spectacular View,5.0,,"A bit expensive, but well worth the price. Magnificent view over Singapore and the harbour and as it was clear we could even see the islands of Indonesia in the distance.The official ""greenscreen"" photo is expensive"
,,A great place to enjoy the view of Singapore,5.0,,"The impressive three skyscrapers with boat on top architectural wonder that is Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a must see when in Singapore. The entry fee of 20S$ may be a bit steep, but is well worth it.
You can even buy a few drink/ soft drinks / souveniers on top and get a kitchy picture.

We went just after seeing the water show in the marina - and saw some of it from the Skypark as well. I had no Idea the whole building was part of the show! Unfortunately I did not have time to see it from the other side of the marina - but will do so when I am back in singapore another time.

If you show up in time on the day you visit you may get one of 50 places on the free tours of the other part of the skypark. Unfortunately you cannot book the day before - only on the day you want to go to the top. I would have loved to see the infinity pool a bit closer :o)."
,,Over-rated but great views,3.0,,"The MBS is undoubtedly an amazing icon building. We wasted time wandering around looking for the access lifts, poor signage. The $20 price to access the Skydeck was excessive as the deck had no seating, no shelter or no information. Not even allowed to sit on the steps if you were tired. It was very hot the day we were there. Staff were disinterested and quite blunt, bordering on being rude. No question though, the views were breathtaking with outlooks over most of Singapore city and harbour. A good head for heights is needed to get the full benefit from the deck but even though I struggle with heights I was able to appreciate the views."
,,Wow - Great design!,5.0,,"Modern, pretty (nice and green) and amazing views :) Huge pool, lots of seats near pool if you wish to sit."
,,Ocean liner on a building,5.0,,"Imagine an Ocean liner parked 200 m into the sky, balanced precariously on top of 3 tower blocks
That is the sight that greets you when you approach Marina Bay
This mesmerising sight is extraordinary, a real feat of engineering
What is even more amazing is that the 'liner' is decked out the same as a cruise liner - complete with promenade deck and deck swimming pool. An expressive lift will whisk you up to the promenade in no time at all, although it may take your stomach a little while to catch up. Stroll round the deck and admire the view of the harbour and city stretching out in all directions - just forget that the deck you are stood on is high above the ground floating on air not water. The bonus is you can't get sea sick, but it does sway when the wind blows"
,,Lovely at night...,5.0,,"It is not expensive to get up and it's worth the few Dollars. Lovely view, especially at night. Nice bar and restaurant. So you can take a time off from touring the city. Would reccomand!"
,,great view,5.0,,"great if you dont minfd heights , we really enjoyed it and think it should be high on visitors list of things to do , reccommend"
,,Views to die for,4.0,,"Although you need to pay to get to what is the roof of the MBS hotel, it's worth the money and all the visitors that I've taken there have felt likewise. On a clear day you can see for ever and the infinity pool, reserved for guests, is seriously impressive. Can get busy on occasions and beware electrical storms or high winds which cause closure."
,,On Top Of The World!!,5.0,,"Stayed a night with my wife on her birthday,had dinner and party at Ku De Ta Club Lounge up on the Skypark , What a fantastic view from way up the 73 rd floor I think??
In the morning was another adventure wher we had a great breakfast by the largest Roof Top Pool in the world. We had to take a dip into this marvelous pool with a view. Everything was Just Perfect !!"
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,This is one of the must-see spots for Singapore. The views are absolutely amazing. Stay at the hotel if you can so you an access the pool and get a drink at Ku De Ta.
,,Nice pool and great view,3.0,,"We went there on the eve of holiday and it was very packed. The infinity pool (only for hotel guest) was very nice as you can see Singapore city view while you relax in the pool. The Jacuzzi was very small but I love the strong bubbles and warm water. Children below 16 are not allowed in the Jacuzzi due to the water temperature. The Sky park is not very big so I feel it may not be worth to pay $20 to go up, However, you get to see quite a lot of Singapore. I think it's a better buy than Singapore Flyer. My main disappointment is that though MBS is suppose to be a top class hotel in Singapore, the ladies toilet was under maintanance. My daughter and I had to queue up for the handicap toilet with so many other visitors. The toilet was very dirty. This is an embarrassment to the hotel. They should fix the toilet before the holidays and have someone standby to maintain the toilet cleanliness to up keep the reputation of the hotel. The experience with the toilet made me feel like I was in a public pool but hey, I was in MBS. It was really not up to my expectation."
,,Another view of the Skypark,5.0,,The gardens are well designed and give another great view. It a little confusing for new visitors to get there by MRT but worthwhile..
,,Top views of Singapore,4.0,,Complete all round views of Singapore! If rains within hour of buying your ticket you get a refund on request!
,,"Glad we did it, wouldn't take a 2nd trip",3.0,,Heading to the top of this mega structure was worth it just for the one off visit. Great views of Singapore. There is a guided tour if you want to see more of the skypark but these only went a couple of times a day so we skipped the tour as you can still see plenty on your own. They were very keen to sell the souvenir photo standing against a green screen of the skyline which detracted from the initial experience.
,,Something different,4.0,,Having visited the gardens I was not going to miss out on walking amongst the sky trees. Yes it is an extra $5 charge and for that you can either walk up or ride up in the elevator. It is quite an impressive structure and you do get good views across the entire gardens. Whilst I am not particularly fond of heights I did not feel concerned at anytime that I walked on the suspended walkways.
,,Greatest view,5.0,,"Unless you are opposed to a twenty dollar beer, don't let them charge yu twenty dollars just to go up. Go to thrower three and ask to go to Kadeta. You can see everything and have a beer for $20.00. At night they have dancing and music and light show 8:00 and 9:30. And on Saturdays an addition show at 11:00. Enjoy"
,,An amazing view of Singapore,4.0,,"The view of Singapore with the infinity pool was just spectacular, it's as if you're on a beach high above from the ground just because the pool was exceptionally huge. I don't know about some who had commented about the bad service but the time when I visited there the staff was very friendly where there's one young staff who was in charge of greeting and valedict the visitors near the elevators offered to help me take pictures of me and my family. The visit to Marina Bay Sands contributes to the amazing experience of human architecture beyond boundaries."
,,the most amazing place built by man,5.0,,"the feeling of floating in the air, the beauty , the uniqueness , the huge trees on 57th floor, the food , everything!"
,,"great view,but overpriced",3.0,,"as my title says,great views but very overpriced $20 each to go up then $45 for a photo which we did decline,but yes the views are great."
,,Nice view,3.0,,"The viewing area was very limited for the amount you pay, there is also a dress code for the bar and restaurant which isn't very well advertised."
,,Most disappointing part of Singapore,1.0,,To visit Marina Bay Sands was on the top of my to do list but wish I had skipped it. Staff are extremely rude. The deck area feels very unwelcoming. Bar staff would not serve us and just kept walking past even though there was no one else there. Had to ask then for service and even then they didn't want to help. Very expensive and not worth it. The wheel get just as good views and had a better and higher view from my hotel. Made to feel like scum as we were not staying at the hotel even through we had purchased tickets to go up. Had to argue with one of the staff just to let us into the dinning area as we were not guests even through the the tickets gave us access and we wanted to have cocktails while there. Avoid as there are much better ways to view Singapore
,,Great Business Lunch,4.0,,"Great business lunch, effective menu and very attentive service with an amazing view. Go to Ku De Ta for dinner!"
,,Nice view,3.0,,"The view was spectacular however the viewing area was in full sun and extremely hot. There are no seats or shaded areas, and there are signs saying not to sit on the deck. There were hats for sale, however the heat left us itching to leave after 20 minutes (which could be the intention), which was a bit of a waste of the $44 it cost to get up there. I would not recommend visiting this in the afternoon."
,,The view is spectacular,5.0,,"We have been to Singapore many times and the Marina Bay Sands is an incredible engineering feat, that you literaly can't miss. We didn'y stay there and doubt we would as it is too big and far too busy for our liking, but we did pay the $20 to go up to the sky park observation deck. What a view, even on the overcast day we went. Well worth the visit."
,,Night out stunning views,5.0,,"Great place to relax with a drink at KuDaTa roof of marine bay sands amazing, good cocktails.Went with friends the view is amazing especially at night.Ffantastic for Singapore grand prix. If you want to take it to another level use the pool then after a few drinks go to the casino but have your passport with you or you might it hard to get in the casino"
,,Was told it was well worth a visit!,5.0,,"We didn't go up to the Skypark but met someone who had just come down and said "" well worth the money"" it costs $S20 to go up,the view must be exccellent!!!!"
,,Good Scenery,4.0,,"Good Scenery and Pool. You like swim in the sky when you look to the end, because no end there, so the water is like falling down. But better you stay there, so you can go there for free."
,,Broke the bank,1.0,,"So we were the silly ones to ride up in the elevator costing $40 and then we get to the top and have some drinks, $25each drink. The drink wasn't even that good and the waitress even counted our money we paid right there at the table, so rude. Was not impressed with the service at all."
,,Breathtaking view,4.0,,"This is where you wanna spend an evening to dine with a breathtaking view, or dip in pool while watching sunset. If you're not staying at the hotel there is a paid tour with a bit overpriced fee."
,,Great way to experience Singapore,5.0,,This is a place to get beautiful views on Singapore. There are tons of restaurants that are very highly rated with great reviews. There is also a casino near by.
,,must go here,5.0,,"Do the tour, its 20SGD and well worth it. Book early tho, as I got there 1030 and no tour available till 1400. The Infinity pool has to be seen to believe but as not a hotel guest not able to use the pool. amazing views"
,,Nothing beats the view,4.0,,"Obviously a must see for first tie visitors, but it's crowed, the swimming pool can only be used by guests and it's expensive."
,,Total rip-off,1.0,,this is so overpriced! just to see hotel guests in their sky pool? there are far nicer sights in S'pore
,,Fantastic views,4.0,,"We went at night, after dinner. As there was no chance to get onto the tour of the pool and garden, a local friend just told us to go to the Ku Te Da bar, and not bother with a ticket. So we told the guards below that we were going for a drink at the bar and they let us onto the lift. We bought a Coke each at SGD8++ which was cheaper than the ticket. The bar was noisy, packed, crowded and not nice. After not getting any space, we walked out and could get onto the deck - but had to leave the drinks behind. We could then wonder round the deck (which was the rounded end) and take photos as long as we wanted. Then we left without bothering to pick up our abandoned drinks.
The views were fantastic - worth a visit, but I thought SGD20 each was a bit much. There is a kiosk selling overpriced T-shirts and souvenirs, but nothing else on the deck."
,,MBS skypark & pool,5.0,,We stayed at MBS in May and utilised the roof top pool and surrounding area a few times. We found the weekdays to be less hectic than the weekends and had no trouble finding a spot to take pictures on our own. It was especially lovely around sunset with a cocktail in hand overlooking the citylights of Singapore below us.
,,Impressive views but expensive,4.0,,"There's no denying the views are amazing. But once you've walked around admiring the view (which takes all of 10 minutes)....that's it. It's expensive for what it is. There are restaurants you can eat at, but they are ridiculously expensive."
,,Only worthwhile with the complimentary tour!,4.0,,"At the end of the day SD40 is a lot of money for two people to spend a few minutes on a viewing platform... That being said it is a 'must do' for any visitor to Singapore! It's an AMAZING view from the top but you must try and time your visit with their complimentary tours which provide access to view the pool and gardens (along with a free bottle of water and cold refresher towel). From memory the tours run at 10am, 2pm and 9pm but be there at least 30 minutes early to secure your spot. The Gardens by the Sea are right next door so if you want to do the tour you can book you ticket, check out the gardens, and return for the tour!"
,,Limited Access,3.0,,"We could ""take it"" or ""leave it"" with regards to the Skypark. We paid about AUD$20 each for a ticket which only allowed you limited access on one side of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There were great views from up there, but don't expect much in the way of food. There is a restaurant up higher but you have to pay extra for that - its like a meal deal with views."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"In Singapore?? Then this is a must to visit, it's amazing.
You pay to go up to the sky tower....and if you choose to have a drink in the bar up there, S$20 for a beer and a martini....that's each, plus combined taxes of another 14%. Water was S$12.... Just so you know.
Obviously you don't need to have a drink there, you get just as great a view on the deck itself."
,,beautiful,4.0,,"but you always have access to two points of view: - The sea - And on the bay and the city of Singapore (for the latter, you need to go to the bar, but you do not really have to consume)"
,,Get a drink at the bar instead,4.0,,"We paid our S$20 each to go up to the observation deck, and the view is fantastic. However we then went into the bar and paid (fairly steep) prices for a drink each, and had the same view with seating, so just go to the bar! The only advantage the observation deck has is that you can just glimpse the magnificent infinity pool of the hotel, which of course only guests can swim in. One day we'd like to go back and stay at the hotel just so we can swim in that pool!
We were told that you can get a free tour with your $20 ticket so you'd get to see the pool up close but the tours were all booked out."
,,Attractive view of surroundings,3.0,,"we have not found this place worth watching, and it is not worth paying S$ 20 for one person. when we can see the entire view from singapore flyer, it is not advisable to see this place paying huge amount. entrance to swimming pool is not at all times, so without knowing the swimming pool entrance timings, visiting this place is damn waste. you cannot find any food or soft drinks around."
,,Amazing View,5.0,,"We've visited Marinan Bay Sands Last Jan 2013 and we really enjoyed. The Hotel is amazing as a design and the Skypark is one of the best attraction in Singapore. We enjoyed the view, pool, food and pics."
,,stunning views,5.0,,Great views over singapore. Advise to go there for sunset. All other times it might be too hot. would go to skypark instead of ku da te - same view you get and all i heard drinks and food not worth it.
,,Go up Tower 1,5.0,,"By mistake I went up Tower 1 to take in the view from the tallest structure in Singapore. A odd three tier building with what appears to be a boat on top. Ready for global warming :)
I was fortuitous in my mistake, I went up to the restaurant desk and asked whether I could get a snack and a beer. No snacks available but I was welcome to stay for a beer. The staff even gave me binoculars. All for S$21 I believe the entry from the Tower 3 costs S$22 so a great way of taking advantage of it all. Note that the Infinity Pool is only open to houseguests."
,,Wonderful view of Singapore CBD!,4.0,,"I have visited Marina Bay Sands Sky Park 3 times and all the three times I have never regretted for money I paid. The entrance fee is $20 per visit. They don't allow public to the Sky Park if it is raining heavily.

Basically when you pay for ticket, you can enter the place and total lift time is only 40 secs for 57 floors, it goes in amazing speed and you will not realize you are moving so fast.

When you go up there you can see a wonderful view of Singapore Central Business District, Gardens By the bay etc., The top floor also contains a good swimming pool and a restaurant of Hotel which public is not allowed to enter, but there is a small counter where in you can buy some drinks and snacks. There is also small Marina Bay Sands souvenir shop but all the items are over priced.

I would suggest viewing this place in the evening the evening around 6pm after sun set but when you still have light. Spend till 7:15pm where in all the buildings would be lighted, so you can have both day and night view of Singapore. And after getting down you can walk to Marina Bay Sands shopping center and watch Laser light show at 8pm which is worth watching. If you go 10 mins early you can sit in the open space because on the weekends there is lot of crowd.

Don't worry if you miss 8pm show, you can have a good food at Rasapura food court in the shopping mall basement or in any of the restaurants in the shopping center and watch 9pm show."
,,Nice view and even better with the pool,3.0,,"The top view is great and personally think the best part is the pool is located right at top.
However, because the size isn't that big, it really feels like a good design roof terrace.

The service at the hotel is so-so as it claims to be a five-star hotel but from the facade and design, it sure makes an iconic statement."
,,Panoramic,4.0,,"If you want to enjoy a great panoramic view the city do not go to the sky park but instead enjoy the amazing view by having drinks or dining at the Ku De Ta club lounge. The Sky Park charges $20 per person and with that amount you can get a Singapore Sling and enjoy Singapore skyline at the club lounge rather than the Sky Park.
Only hotel guests are allowed in the pool area. We went there at 5:30 so it's just about sunset. This is the most ideal time to enjoy the views day and night while enjoying drinks or snacks or even dinner. The staff are friendly and very accommodating and they always refill the complimentary chips and nuts they serve as you order drinks."
,,"Excellent place to have fun, relax full time and take beautiful photos",5.0,,"Entry Fee : 20 SGD

Tourist can go in 56th level and from there you can see the entire city center and other beautiful structures like Garden by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Raffles corporate business center, Marina Bay Financial Center, Merlion Park, Esplanade Theater, Olympic Park.

No body should miss this beautiful attraction and much better than other height ed towers like tiger sky tower, Singapore Flyer etc.

Best time is before sunset, so that you can get view of both before and after sunset"
,,Spectacular views from the top of the hotel!,5.0,,We visited this hotel and had a cocktail on the top floor. The views are amazing! Although you can see the affinity pool this area is only accessible to hotel residents.
,,Incredible views,5.0,,"There is also a bar and restaurant at the infiniti pool area which is pretty decent. From the bar you can see forever, it is pretty impressive a must do."
,,Very windy,3.0,,"You have to pay to get up there and it was very windy. Pictures of ourselves did not turn out well, but the view was good. Not worth the money though."
,,Not for the faint hearted.,5.0,,"This has to be one of the most stunning venues in the Far East. The view from the top is spectacular and even though I have always thought I had a good head for heights, even I was steeling myself to go to the edge for photographs.
You can see all over Singapore and the ships in the harbour and if you are in Singapore this is a must do."
,,Memorable view,5.0,,"Loved spending time up at Sky on 57. There is no cover charge here, you just have to buy drinks. Mellow vibe. Expect expensive beverages anywhere in Marina Bay Sands!"
,,A boat in the sky,5.0,,"Less than a minute in the lift to the top of what from the distance looks like a boat on top of three pillars (a marvellous engineering feat). The view is spectacular, the Gardens by the Bay, the river, the city, the harbour, and if you go with a group at prescribed times you can walk amongst trees past the swimming pool (with water right to the edge). If you are staying at the Marina Sands Hotel you can have this all the time"
,,A photographer's haven,5.0,,"Fifty seven plus stories up with views over most of Singapore city, and the Merlion Park. Look down on the Flyer and across to the open sea with numerous ships at anchor. Just so much to see."
,,Worth a visit!,5.0,,"Great views. Awesome pool!!! Get there early to secure a sun lounge! Very kid friendly, but also has an adults only section."
,,Simply The Best,5.0,,"We stayed here and had the club package free Access,Free breakfast,Afternoon tea, and Free Cocktails.."
,,Great views of the city!,5.0,,Great views of the city from the top! Try to get in early in the morning or towards the evening when the weather is not too hot.
,,Awesome view..,5.0,,"If u r in Singapore u should just go to Marina Bay Sands Skypark ,u will get a awesome view of Singapore.One side u can see tall skyscrapers and one side sea view.If u get chance then u should to infinity pool that's really awesome.
If u r in Singapore then u must visit this place.

If u like casino then there is one just opposite to this marina bay sands."
,,It may not be worth it to pay $20 just to go up to see the view.,3.0,,"My friends specially came from London to celebrate my birthday on last weekend, and I brought them up to have a look at the Skypark, of Marina Bay Sands.

I wasn't aware that even just going up to the top, we have to pay $20 per person, and the other friend from London, who is over his 60s, only got $3 discount.

However, we were a bit disappointed, as when we reached the top, we were only told that only the hotel guests could use the swimming pool. My husband thought that it was not worth it just to pay $20,to go up to look at the full view of Singapore."
,,A must of Singapore,4.0,,One of the best rooftop bars in Singapore. Great atmosphere and classy club. Unfortunately the access to the swimming pool is restricted to hotel guests and outside visitors have to pay a ticket or go to the bar/restaurant Ku de ta to enjoy the view.
,,Must do activity,5.0,,"A fantastic vantage point for a good photo shoot of the central business district of Singapore as back drop. On a clear day, you will be able to view the extreme ends of Singapore."
,,View from the Sky,4.0,,"You can see around the area from the higher place. But for me, it's a bit expensive to pay for the view. As once you're on top, just take view shot and than nothing more.Better we enter the Kudeta resto for free, buy a drink and we can get the same view also and we pay cheaper than just enter the skypark itself."
,,Nice scenery,4.0,,Very nice night views of Singapore bay. The area is fenced by clear glasses. So ones can enjoy the views without any obstruction. It is best visit before sunset. The tickets are a bit expensive.
,,Loved the view!,5.0,,"I loved he view from the rooftop of this marvel of architecture. The entrance fee paid was definitely worth it, and you get to see the beauty of Singapore literally from the sky. A couple of tips: first, the visit to the pool area is not included automatically. Only 3 or 4 times a day there are tours to that area (usually reserved to the hotel guests). The visit is included in the regular ticket price, but needs to be scheduled in advance when you purchase the ticket. Second tip: I went up about 6.30 / 7pm. To be able to see the views both by day and by night. I would recommend you doing the same, as you will see very different, both beautiful, faces of the city."
,,Sail through the clouds on a ship atop a building,5.0,,"This building is the most remarkable I have seen but it does not prepare you for the experience when you walk out onto the deck of what is for all intents and purposes a ship sailing through the clouds 57 stories above the streets of Singapore.

For those of us who have experienced cruising it is quite an amazing thing to experience the same feeling so far above the ground.

The curved shape of the building allows for interesting photos showing the 'aft' of the ship from the 'prow'.

The cost is (s)$ 20 dollars and our taxi driver tried to convince us it was a waste of money but he was very wrong. I would reccommend it to anyone as a quite unique experience. The view is worth the $ 20 but the amazing feeling of sailing through the clouds is quite another thing."
,,Fun and a must try,5.0,,"Quite simply one of the best swimming pool areas in the world. There were lots of children but because it is so large, it didn't feel as though the place was over run with children. The pool food and bar service was quick (although the quality of the satay and calamari could be improved), you had access to free WiFi and the views are amazing. And Ku De Ta is a fun place to sip a cocktail.

There is plenty of staff - and even life guards. It had a real holiday atmosphere."
,,OMG!,5.0,,"This is the biggest hotel I have ever seen, its massive inside and goes up 57 floors! On top is a boat that spans 3 towers of this hotel. The boat contains restaurants and a large swimming pool that has glass sides that look straight down! Quite frightening! It's such an unusual quirky building, everybody wants to go up and see it! Fascinating!"
,,Good but optional,3.0,,"Three luxurious hotels joined together; beautiful sky terrace, best views of singapore are from the SkyPark.... just keep it as an optional visit...."
,,Chocolate overload at the chocolate buffet.,4.0,,"We enjoyed the chocolate buffet and if you factor in that it is about S$20 just to access the Skypark it is quite cheap at S$38. We enjoyed a great view of Singapore at night and were able to marvel at the pool area etc of the Marina Bay Sands.
The buffet is very rich as just about every item on the buffet contains chocolate in some form. We were warned of this before we booked but it is still hard to fathom and almost impossible to try all the 50+ items available."
,,Cool as!,5.0,,"An awesome view and experience on top of Singapore. We went for the sunset and it was spectacular.
it's not cheap, but well worth it.
there is a restaurant up there but be warned they have a dress code after 6 so you cannot wear shorts in - which was really disappointing."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Okay, it is very touristic but it it really really worth a visit. The view ower Singapore is just amazing and the atmosphere is nice. It costs you to get up and the drink in the bar is not cheap either, but it is really worth it!"
,,Small viewing area,3.0,,"It was good but 1-Altitude was better. Higher up, less crowded and you got a seat. KuDeTa bar was next door to the viewing platform and think it would be better to actually go in there (and pay the cover charge) rather than just pay to go to the viewing platform"
,,You have to see this...,5.0,,If you're visiting Singapore you have to see Marina Bay Sands. It costs $20 per person to go up to the viewing deck but the view across the city is worthwhile. Its a feat of engineering bulding 3 towers and then a ship on top! Go in the evenings for the light show at 8:00pm.
,,Skypark.. Skypool.. Skygym.. Just Amazing..!!!!,5.0,,"All i can say about this place is amazing. Love being here.. The pool is just like what people said and also with amazing city view. You can also see laser show at night. So cool and awesome.. KuDeTa restaurant makes this rooftop perfect, nice restaurant though.."
,,It's all about the view!,4.0,,"Pricey..... Yes, but what do you expect in Singapore.
You go here for the panoramic views over the city and it does not disappoint.
It's very swish but there is no dress code until after 6 which is handy as I was in casual sight seeing clothes."
,,"Fantastic views, but expensive",3.0,,"We spent less than 30 minutes here after a trip to the ArtScience museum. At $20 each to go up, it's an expensive family trip. The views are amazing, though it would have been better if landmarks had been marked in some way. Probably wouldn't recommend it unless you really wanted that uninterrupted view for a photo. Was also a bit miffed to see that we could have had a discount if we'd bought our entry with our ArtScience tickets...no one mentioned that..."
,,World in Every Angle,5.0,,"Like the title said: World in Every Angle. The most beautiful architecture in Asia, the most efficient building. There is shopping mall, dining, hotel, pool, theater, coffee shop, and the famous lion&fish of singapore is right on its backdoor.. stunning..!"
,,WOW...dont go if you dont like heights!!,5.0,,definitely a sight not to be missed! take in the amazing architecture of Singapore from above and see how the other half lives with a walk amongst the gardens and infinity pool of the Marina Bay sands hotel
,,Completely over the top!,5.0,,Not for the faint of heart or ones suffering from vertigo! Simply mind boggling the logistics in the creation of this. The views are one-of-a-kind. Beautiful aerial view of the Gardens by the Bay next-door.
,,Must see!,5.0,,"The view of Singapore from the 56-floor-height is amazing! Don't go to the shoppes (this is the way they spell it) - they are super-expensive, go straigt upstairs, enjoy the great view of Singapore."
,,Amazing!!!,5.0,,"The daily show between 1945 and 2045 is just awesome. Its such a treat to watch. A perfect setting for an evening stroll in the park with family or with your partner. There is a bridge that connects two of the raised tree like structures, to go on top for a walk on bridge is by purchasing a ticket ($20 / adult) . Mind you the ticket counters close as early as 2000... Missed the opportunity as i went 5 minutes past eight :-(.

As this is located near the Marina Bay Sans.. The Skypark with the well lit Marina Bay as the backdrop is an awesome view that picturesque to say the least."
,,Magical night,4.0,,"My son and i reached at 9 pm so missed the guided tour by few minutes,we then embarked on our own after paying the 20$SG fees.the view from the 57 th floor is breathtaking.i wish they keep the food stall open for some more time tho'.
We watched the water fountain show happening at the marina bay from this tall angle and it was a very different experience.a must visit."
,,"A bit pricey, but a beautiful view",4.0,,"I visited the Skypark at night, about an hour before it closed. The views were spectacular - you can see almost 360 degree views of the city. In daytime it might be easier to see more, but nighttime is lovely too. There is a snack vendor up there, and a souvenir store as well.

When you are on the way to the elevator, the staff take a photo of you in front of a green screen and when you go to leave you are offered a photo of yourself Photoshopped in front of the Marina Bay Sands... This is nice, but shockingly expensive at SG$45 per photo! Would have bought one if it was cheaper. That's my only real critique of my visit."
,,LARGER THAN LIFE,5.0,,MARINA BAY SANDS>...the skypark...the pool are simply outstanding.when you lok down from the sky park..its just scintillating..the lit up buildings..bridges..and their reflection in the river water..! awesome !
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,5.0,,"It is higher than the nearby Flyer, doesn't keep moving so you can you can admire the views for as long as you like and you are not in a glass bubble. We took drinks at the Ku De Ta restaurant before the rains came, but were unable to eat there in the evening because of other commitments. This was a pity as the menu looked very reasonably priced and the choices varied. The views must be fabulous at night with all the lights of Singapore."
,,Great view,4.0,,Nice place. On a good day the view is magnificent. The view at night is also something spectacular. I am not to impressed with the hotel foyer but the elevator to the top moved at an incredible speed. Worth a visit.
,,Top of the List,4.0,,Fantastic Viewing platform. Went to the top but didn't seem to pay. Views all round were amaizing. Couldn't get into the infinity pool but enjoyed a beer right next door which did the job. Frankly it's another place on the must do list even though your time will be limited. Just had to be visited.
,,What a view,3.0,,Its expensive at 20 Sing $ but the view is fantastic. Only go if you are not afraid of heights !!.Apart for the view there is nothing else to do up there.
,,Excellent View,4.0,,We went there in the evening. The breeze there was refreshing and view was excellent. The attraction itself is little expensive but was worth visiting there. Later there was a free laser show nearby. It was amazing. Enjoyed it fully!!
,,Scarry Views,5.0,,"At 57 floors up you wont want to have a fear of heights. We visited the bar after having a look around. $20 per person for entry is not bad,must have cost a mint to build this complex. Might want to have lunch if the timing is right."
,,Great views,4.0,,For really great views but very expensive for what you get - you don't see the whole of the Skydeck only a small park. best visit early evening to see the sun go down and the lights come on.
,,"Yup, the view is impressive",5.0,,"What a spectacular view of the Singapore skyline. It costs S$20 to go up. To make the most of your time and money, go shortly before sundown, and stay until it is dark. That way, you will see the city both in day light and under night lights."
,,"Pricy, but an incredible view",4.0,,"Taking the elevator to the top costs $20. That gives you access to the observation deck. You can get a guided tour through the rest of the top (eg the swimming pool) at 10am and 2pm, but places in these book out quickly. Without the guided tour, you can't see the pool or restaurants etc. The view from the top is over 270 degrees, from the Gardens by the Bay round to the financial district cluster of skyscrapers. On a hot day it can be blistering up top, so a hat or umbrella is a good idea. When you enter the elevator, your picture is taken, and at the top a print is waiting for you (your picture superimposed on the view from the top). About $30 for the print alone."
,,View with a drink at Ku De Ta,4.0,,The view from the MBS Skypark is an excellent way to get a view of Singapore. The downside is that the elevator costs $20 per person. The alternative is to arrive looking relatively smart (no shorts and decent footwear) and visit the Ku De Ta bar. This has the same view but they very kindly waive the fee for their elevator and allow you to invest the $20 in a hard earned beer (or beverage of choice). The crowd was a mix of local expats and savvy tourists and none the worse for that.
,,Spectacular View,5.0,,"We took the lift to the bar next to the Ku De Ta on the 57th(?) floor which overlooks the Marina Bay to the north. What a fantastic view!

All the more interesting when a thunder storm rolled through. Felt like we were right in the middle of it! Not for the feint hearted.

This method of access does not allow entry to the 'bow' of the ship skypark itself (A$20 fee applies) nor the swimming pool which is reserved for hotel guests. You can however overview both facilities from here. Drinks are expensive, but what else would you expect at such a stunning venue.

Note there is a dress code for the main Ku De Ta restaurant, and the adjacent bar does not allow open foot ware after 6PM.

An experience not to be missed."
,,Go for the Ku De Ta bar instead: same view no admission fee.,5.0,,"The Skypark view is great but there is not much to do their besides from this. Instead go directly to the Ku De Ta bar, which will save you the 20 dollars Skypark admission (better spent on a nice cocktail at Ku De Ta) and has the same view (actually one floor higher). Here you also get the great bar feel and a little relaxing music."
,,What a view,4.0,,"We had intended to grab a drink at Ku De Ta but the man was only wearing shorts and the dress code requires long pants. In any case there is a public viewing area looking over Gardens by the Bay, all the way up on this 57th floor. It is breathtaking. Take the lift in Tower 3 to get there.
An additional view of the city, without going into the bar, can be found by taking the lift in Tower 1 all the way to the top. There is a glassed in foyer which faces the city, and then an additional open balcony looking over Gardens by the Bay."
,,The only way to see Singapore!,4.0,,"What a spectacular view from the Skypark on top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Head to tower number 3, line up to buy your ticket ($20 each a bit steep in my opinion) and then take the lift to level 57 for amaing views of the Singapore skyline and surrounds.

There is limited shade so be mindful of this when heading out! The building sways (yes it is not your imagination you can feel it) and you can buy the odd souvenir or overpriced drink from the skypark as well. Head around past the bar area and up the stairs to catch a glimpse of the infinity pool.

Dedicate around 1 hour for your visit here and be prepared to take plenty of happy snaps!

Definately worth the effort on your trip to Singapore!"
,,Go in the morning - not too busy,4.0,,"We just missed the time slot by about 5 minutes for the 10am guided tour that goes to the infinity pool but reading the previous reviews about it being crowded at the pool im glad we missed it as it wasnt crowded at all on the observation deck!

The skypark ticket office was a bit difficult to find at first as we entered the hotel via the opposite end of the building. However, we only had to queue for a couple of minutes to get our tickets and no wait at all for the lift to take us up to the 57th floor!

As we went through the doors onto the roof the heat was almost unbearable - luckily there was a shaded area over the opposite side and the views of the city were breathtaking! We only stayed about 15 minutes as it was very hot and once we had taken photos there wasnt much else to do unless you wanted a drink in the bar.

Overall it was a great experience and to me, even though some might say it was expensive, it was totally worth the money for such a wonderful view."
,,Brilliant view amazing skyline.,4.0,,"Spent a lazy afternoon enjoying the view from the top of the hotel. The view is spectacular. We sheltered from the sun and enjoyed a few gin and tonics at the cafe bar, pricey but to be expected."
,,It is all about the view and the bucket list,4.0,,The entrance fee and wait are worth it to take in the awesome view and to scratch it from your bucket list.
,,A must visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Nothing to dislike, the views are fantabulous, service is truly 5 star, prices are not too expensive (a long island ice tea, margarita cost S$36) We stayed in there so we had access to the brilliantly made infinity pool. If you wanna a decent deck bed, come in early by around 5:30 pm and stay on. The evening laser show does not make for a great viewing from the skypark."
,,The view,4.0,,The view is fantastic but thought it was a bit pricey to go up there. Decided to have a drink while on the top but a glass of coke was very dear. Still the view of Singapore and beyond is worth seeing
,,Spectacular views,5.0,,The best unobstructive viewing platform in Singapore for a 360 view of the city. Simply spectacular a must when in Singapore. Expensive at $20 a ticket but then you are in Singapore and everythink is expensive.
,,Great Attraction to Visit,5.0,,We visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark recently and although it was smoggy you really got a good view of all around Singapore. There is no shade on the top and you cannot use the hotel facilities if you are not a guest. It cost us $20 each adult and is on the 57th floor. This Skypark is on the tip of Tower 1 only.
,,Very nice place to visit,5.0,,"Come here for a panoramic views and a cup of cappuccino, but stayed here for a dinner. They have very nice steamed rice with seafood, variety of fresh juices and little bit strange apple pie with an ice cream. And also amazing views of the city!!!
I didn't retreat about any minute a have spent here. Very nice place, must visit!!!"
,,Excellent Vantage for Overall Singapore,5.0,,Fantastic Views - see a large part of Singapore from the Sky and Indonesian islands to the south. Visit once.
,,Good View,5.0,,"we've went to Marina Bay Sands Skypark on 08/04/2013, and have a very nice time there, they have food outlet there selling light snacks and drinks, the view there are very nice and excellent."
,,Must do,5.0,,What an amazing view. If you are travelling to Singapore you have to visit the skypark!! It has the most amazing view on a good day and you can see for miles. Well worth the money.
,,Incredible Views,3.0,,"The view from the Skypark is amazing, but we were disappointed that the fairly expensive cost to go up to the 57th floor only included the observation deck and not the Skypark area. Only hotel guests are welcomed to the Skypark or the pool. The observation deck offered incredible views, but was very hot and there was not much else up there. A few, albeit amazing, photos and we had to leave due to the heat. I cannot say this is something I would do again especially given the price and the opportunity to do other things as the Marine Bay without a cost."
,,Expensive but priceless view,4.0,,"After a stroll around the marina go the the Skypark at sunset to enjoy an astonishing view of Singapore.
This is an unique point of view and you will probably take hundreds of photos.
Ok it's expensive but you will remember the view all your life.
Have a look to the swimming pool also for another sensational view."
,,"Great view, but expensive",4.0,,"We went to the top for a martini, which was about $20 US for less than a shot of vodka. If you go, order one of their specialty drinks (i.e. Cosmo) or a beer. It's the same price, but at least the glass is full. The view really is worth it. You must walk to the far end of the lobby and tell the elevator guard that you're having a drink, or they'll make you pay just to ride to the top. Not sure I'd stay here (it's like a super large Vegas hotel), but it's worth the view to go for a drink. Also, it makes for a great view from across the bay looking back at the hotel, which resembles a gigantic boat."
,,Amazing but crowded.,4.0,,We went to the chocolate bar one evening and thus got to walk through the sky park. Its worth a look but we were amazed at how crowded it was. The pool was heaving with people and just wasn't that appealing. I would not be inclined to stay at the hotel based on this alone.
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"An obvious engineering masterpiece gone horribly wrong as non-hotel guests can pay to enter. Pool dirty, crowded with no seating available and toilets with broken cisterns, tiles missing and water running everywhere."
,,It's the next wonder of the world !,4.0,,"You just cant stop staring at it !
it's a marvel of engineering ...
The design ...the grandness of it all...the pride and place of it in the bay !
It's a boat on top of 3 building for god sake !
Whats does it have ?...What doesn't it have ?
Restaurants...bars...shopping mall...hotel...The most expensive night club in the world .. Ku De Tah restaurant on the boat overlooking Singapore...the infinity pool of infinity pools
Go...just Go"
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Spectacular view night or day! It’s a must while in Singapore at least for once, even though it is a little bit pricey. It’s a misfortune that you can’t have access to the infinity pool unless you stay there."
,,Fantastic pool with stunning views,4.0,,"Had a one night stay at the MBS which included the skylark pass, normally payable if staying in rooms below club rooms. Am not sure I'd pay for the experience though, whilst its a great pool with stunning views it's extremely busy."
,,Limited space,4.0,,"While the views of Marina Bay, and the skyline of Singapore from the Skypark were awesome, there was limited space for visitors to stroll. As a hotel guest, we could have unlimited access to the pool and park for free. But being alone, I just spent 10 minutes to take a look at the infinity pool and Skypark, snapped a few photos and left."
,,Why Stop at the Skypark when the Infinity Pool is Just Next to You?,4.0,,"The Skypark offers you a great 360 degree view of the Marina Bay, but personally I would have been frustrated not to dive and swim in the Infinity Pool and benefit from the same great view in style! Yes, you have to be a hotel guest to access the pool, so try to plan and budget at least a night; you really do not want to miss the unmissable: swimming on the top of Singapore!"
,,Great view nice LARGE Hotel,5.0,,I've been here 5 days and have about five to go. Everyone has been very nice. It's a very large hotel so not for those that want a boutique experience. Concierge has been helpful and service has been good. I read other reviews about long slow lines I have not experienced that.
,,Not too impressed..,3.0,,"We opted for the 9pm free guided tour expecting to hear something about the history/ construction etc about MBS.. but the ""guided"" tour was nothing but a chance to look at the infinity pool on the top floor and take pictures for 15 minutes. The skypark itself was quite dark (we could hardly see each other's faces)and there was absolutely no place to sit except on the ground.. Views were good (270 degree vew).. and they did click our photo (on the ground level) and gave it to us free of cost but overall I was not too impressed and felt that the flyer would probably have been a better option. The views OF MBS from Gardens by the Bay were excellent though."
,,Can now say - Been there Done that!,4.0,,"Well this is another one that we can say been there done that. The Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck is on the 56th floor and the elevator up takes about 20 seconds. Entry to the deck is S$20, they take your photo before you get in the elevator and 20 seconds later when you get out the photo is already printed, in a nice folder and ready for you to buy, it is amazing how quick it is. I forget what we paid for the photo but it was expensive maybe $50 due to the nice folder it was in.

Anyway the views are fantastic , there is a bar and restaurant up there if you are lucky enough to find a seat. Of course you cannot access the hotels pool which is the world’s highest infinity pool, you can see it though and it looks quite impressive but this is not a cheap hotel and to stay somewhere this big with 2500 rooms is for us not a nice thought."
,,Great view,5.0,,"This is a place to see, fantastic view of the harbour and the city. It's a must when in Singapore, I can highly recommend it."
,,Awesome,5.0,,The view from the 57th floor was magic and worth every cent and if you are over 60 years of age the cost is only SGD17- Have a drink or two and a snack and soak up the magical view. The infinity pool can be partly seen and understandably only for hotel guests. Take a trip on your next visit. We intend to have dinner on our next visit at Ku De Ta Restaurant & Club Lounge but bookings is a must.
,,Lets try and empty tourist pockets,2.0,,"One thing we noticed when we arrived in Singapore was how friendly everyone was. The local people always smiling and happy to help, something I really enjoyed about Singapore . We when to the sky bar on the 57 floor and for what ever reason they had Russian bar girls working there who were the rudest,most unfriendly I've ever come across. After we paid for crazily over priced drinks and snacks and made to feel guilty for asking the staff for the privilege ,we were told we could not use a small tripod to take photos. So even when the views of the city where amazing we where unable to take photos with our camera equipment, crazy as the idea was to go up there was to get photos of the city. So while the views here are fantastic and people will alway come here no matter how bad the customer service is i would recommend to give this place a miss"
,,"Good views, but limited access.",3.0,,"Good views of town, but rather boring outlay, worth the admission fee, but not a fantastic experiance."
,,Amazing Infiniti pool,4.0,,Great views from the skypark. You can see all of Singapore and the ocean. The Infiniti pool is something else. You can get a meal or a drink and it doesn't cost you a arma nd leg. A must do while in Singapore. Only down side is the taxi drivers don't like to take you there as its out of the way for them.
,,POOL in the SKY,4.0,,This is simply something you must experience when in Singapore. We liked the warm water but disliked the changing rooms.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Love the gourmet fries, fried in truffle oil and then sprinkled in parmasen, makes my mouth water writing about them! Cocktails in the pool. Sunset followed by a light show. Ku de ta for cocktails and dinner. Best hotel in the world!"
,,Beautiful and Romantic View - Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Skypark,5.0,,"Marina Bay is something everyone should see. Beautiful, clean and impressive! We decided to go to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark to look out onto the Marina. What we were able to take in was absolutely exquisite. This hotel is built on 37 acres that houses a convention centre, exhibition halls, theatres, shopping, restaurants, and a museum. The hotel itself is comprised of three 55 storey towers that are all connected or crowned with what looks like one large platform shaped like a ship that sits on the top of all three towers. The base of all three towers is connected by a huge atrium that is 23 storeys tall and about 850 feet long! For anyone who is into architecture and design, this is a must see! On the very top where the lookout is, there is a bar called the Ku De Ta which is very chic and upscale contemporary. To the left of the bar, you see a very long infinity pool for guests' use only and that whole western side give you a spectacular view of Singapore's Marina Bay which is lit up in many different colours that throws beams of light upon all of the highlights in the Bay...absolutely beautiful to see.

So how to get to the top viewing deck if you are not a guest of this hotel? You can go pay $25.00 pp to go to the viewing deck that only offers views from one perspective (not the bar or pool side) or...if you want to be on the bar and pool side (western view), you can go up to the bar. If you walk to the very end of the Atrium (last elevator), you will see someone standing at the entrance to the bar elevator. If you say you want to see the view, they will point you to go around the corner and down some stairs where you can pay a fee OR, if you say you are going up to the bar, they will tell you that you ""can't see the view"" from there to deter you as a sightseer. However, if you go up to the bar and have a drink, (we did not order a drink) you will be able to enjoy the entire view from the bar!

NOTE: If you are a shopper, this is the place. The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands are likely the largest you will find in Southeast Asia and are very high end, so bring lots of money and good shoes!

Remember that if you are going up to the bar for a drink or the view, you cannot bring your children. This is the place you would go as a couple and have some great fun!"
,,High life!,4.0,,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands when it first opened, but could not use the Skypark as, like other parts of the hotel it was not finished. went back recently and would thoroughly recommend it. The restaurant was surprisingly quite for lunch and I did not need to book; good food and a truly spectacular view. Do go to the nearby gardens as well."
,,Views are well worth it!,4.0,,"It costs visitors to Singapore S$20 to visit the Skypark; however the 360-degree view from the 56th floor of this amazing complex is well worth it. The Marina Bay Sands looks like a ""ship in the sky"" thanks to its creative architecture, and on my third visit to Singapore I finally made it to the top. You can stay as long as you like; however be aware there is little or no shade on this level, and it does not fit the typical image of a ""park"" (e.g. no trees or grass). On a hot day like the one I experienced in late March, you might want to wear a hat or bring an umbrella to shield you from the sun. There are simple refreshments and souvenirs available; I appreciated the cold-drink choices! There is also a sit-down restaurant, however I didn't have time to eat there. Be sure to check the need for reservations before going; it looked crowded when I was there.

Despite the above, no visit to Singapore is complete without viewing the city and its environs from this perspective. You can literally see everything including, on a relatively clear day, the islands of Indonesia in the distance. You're quite a bit higher than the Singapore Flyer, the largest observation wheel in the world that takes about 30 minutes to make a complete circle, and likely have a more expansive view than from the flyer. I particularly enjoyed seeing a bird's eye view of the new Gardens by the Bay attraction...that's on my list for my next visit!

Next time, I will go up to the Skypark at night; I've heard the night-time view of the city is spectacular!"
,,The best view of Singapore... is your camera ready?,4.0,,"50 odd floors above to this Skypark, & boy the view is mesmerizing. Once you are there, you will just keep shut & watch the view with awe & contemplation. As much detail your eye can perceive, that much you will appreciate & enjoy this attraction.

The entire Singapore skyline, from the Singapore Flyer, to the Singapore shipyard, to all the ships at sea at the other end, to all the banks which have flourished & pushed this country to what it is today- the view is a wholesome detail of what this country stands for.

Best time to get there would be there by 5:30 in the evening. Watch through the sunset, & once the lights are on, it is another experience & another view.. lights on the buildings & the flyer below & on the streets down under,- Wow!

You can get to the bar on top for a even better view- if you have the money to splurge, but sadly you cannot get anywhere else on top of marina bay sands. The Skypark is Marina bay sands is open for public for about $20, & it is a small property atop the marina bay sands hotel. For access to all other properties, you need to stay at the hotel."
,,great observation point,5.0,,"If your timing is right you can get a tour from the top of the skypark. On a clear day you get a 360 degree view of the skyscraping wonder that is Singapore. The skypark is a little pricey, but really the location is wonderful and worth an hour or two of your time enjoying the view."
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"The Skypark gives awesome views of the entire city. Its heaven to sit there in the evening, have a pint of beer and enjoy the sunset. Must see destination of Singapore"
,,Obviously amazing,4.0,,Amazing...although it closes at 11pm - be warned. Shame you have to book a very expensive room to have full access...
,,Great views,4.0,,Went up to the SkyPark for a couple of cocktails before our cruise and to enjoy the view. Unbelievable. Drinks were a little pricey but everything in Singapore is. Great place to stop by for dinner or drinks and to catch the sunset over Singapore...More
,,Great views,5.0,,"Excellent value - 20 dollars per adult. Great views of the City from the 56th floor, and higher than the Singapore Flyer. You can stay at the top for as long as you like. Souvenirs available to purchase at the top. Photographs available to purchase."
,,"Spectaulsr views, but.......",3.0,,"Fantastic views from the top, but the overall experience was expensive, money making, noisy, busy and very Vegas! Quitw frankly, we had a bettwr experience at the Traders in KL looking over the city I Do go if you like great views."
,,Indeed Great Skytop View of Singapore but Expensive,3.0,,I guess we thought the ticket we got to the SkyView was the one complete with guided tour. . . . though they give Senior Citizen Discount for those above 65 years old. But we were wrong . . . what we got only afforded...More
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,Amazing view of Singapore at nightime. Don't go up there if you have vertigo! My husband was too scared to go near the edge lol and he doesn't have vertigo.
,,Awesome view at night,5.0,,This is a must do when visiting Singapore. It is amazing and almost the highest point at Singapore. You get to see the city skyline and best to go at sunset so you get to see the night view. You can buy at ticket at...More
,,During sunset is an indescribable show.,5.0,,"With no doubt this is the most beautiful place in whole Singapore. The Marina Bay Sands Park is a vantage point that literally breathtaking spot, the best moment to go to admire the view from up there is undoubtedly during the sunset when the daylights...More"
,,Great Views!,5.0,,"The views are great of the city. If you are staying at the hotel, it is a must do! Not sure that I would pay to go to the observations deck, though I may have dinner there then check it out."
,,The best view of Singapore,5.0,,"Go either in the morning (from 09:30) or in the evening to observation deck. At these times you can make the best photos. If you join the tour (maximum 50 people), you can go to the pool area. Otherwise you may be only on the side of the hotel tower 3. It really is recommended."
,,An over-rated attraction,3.0,,"There was no scheduled guided tour when we visited Skypark so we had to content ourselves with just going up to get a good view at the top. I wasn't happy with the entire experience. I felt, why did i have to pay a stiff price to view places and structures below without anyone to explain and identify them to us. As a tourist, i would not have minded paying the admission fee, if only there was a guide to assist me in making the experience more worthwhile. Other than that, the souvenir photos were overpriced. After the in-house photographer took our family photos, we went up to find them ready for purchase at the top. They initially wanted $50 for each photo which was mounted in a hard-bound album. We felt that the price was exorbitant so we did not get them. On our way out after the viewing, we were again offered the photos...this time at a discounted price. We ended up buying the two souvenir shots as memento of of our visit despite the still-not-so reasonable price."
,,"Impressive, but still just a building.",3.0,,"We took a tour to the Marina Bay towers with the infinity pool. It is a stunning view from the 200m above ground and the infinity pool looks very inviting, but unfortunately you can't use it. It is just for hotel guests. You get a good impression and overview from Singapore."
,,Have to do it.,5.0,,Even if you aren't a guest you can go up to the bar on 57th floor for a drink or make a booking for lunch in restaurant Drinks aren't cheap but the view is worth it.
,,light show,5.0,,it was a great evening the show was excellent and the shops were great loved the ferrari shop there was an abundance of eating places the walk along the promonade at night was breathtaking the only drawback was the wait for a taxi which had long qeues
,,Spectacular but maybe too popular?,4.0,,"You have to see the Skypark at least once while you're in Siongapore. The views are amazing and so is the architecture. Just be aware that you will be sharing the Skypark with lots and lots of other people, and the staff will be pleasant but very busy."
,,"Great views of the city, go at night",3.0,,"I enjoyed the views, but photo ops can be limited by the glass walls surrounding the pool, which runs a good part of the distance of the skypark. My visit included a free entrance, but I don't think I would have paid for this."
,,I was astonished watching it.,5.0,,"I can not write about the Hotel because there I've never been into it, but I'll just comment on the structure within.
I went up twice and I must admit that the view from up there is magnificent, one of the most beautiful spot you can ever enjoy from the top of a building so high.
The Marina Bay, however, is not just a simple hotel or a point of observation, but it is also a huge Mall and a place where you could find everything.
With no doubt I think is the top attraction of whole Singapore."
,,Great view with overcrowded guests,3.0,,"Pros: Great breathtaking view of Singapore skycrapers and the Gardens By the Bay. Good location for photo taking and enjoying the view on the roof top. However, the place is somewhat overcrowded, especially at night."
,,What a view,5.0,,Well worth the time to get to this outrageous hotel and experience their skypark. Views over Singapore are breathtaking. Morning or early afternoon best for clear viewing.
,,the 1st most-see in singapore,5.0,,"pay 20$ and go to the best site of singapore for pictures and view, good Kudeta bar on top of the city, try a beer or a singapore sling to forget the hot climate!"
,,Essential Visit,4.0,,"A delightful development we loved the Flower dome but did find the cloud dome stagley ugly but engaging; make sure you go straight to the top and work your way down, the sky park is incredible also and worth a visit; its great to see such dedication to excellence in public areas and spaces; special."
,,"Nice view, nice place",4.0,,"The view is splendid. The pool is nice. However, surprisingly, they have very basic facilities for changing wet clothes. Most people just go to and from their room in bath robes and wet swimming suits underneath."
,,Breathtaking views,4.0,,Great place to visit for the views. Unfortunately ran out of time to visit at night but have been told it's a must. If you have an AMEX and are going with a couple of people there are some savings using this card.
,,Been there done that.,4.0,,"We find it good to keep up on the building growth in Singapore so worth a one time visit...the views are litrally 280 degrees, unless you do the full tour."
,,stunning view but not cheap,4.0,,"The view is certainly stunning and worth seeing, especially looking down over the Gardens by the Bay and across to the financial district, but the price is a bit steep. I would suggest if there is a an alternative way of getting up there through the hotel restaurant etc it might be better value."
,,Wonderful view,4.0,,Its on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Getting to the top tends to bit of a drama but entirely worth it. The infinity pool at that height in itself justifies its rating. However I would highly recommend for visitors to go for breakfast at Sky on 57 which is very nice and you get to see one end of the Skypark for free!!
,,A drink with a view.,5.0,,"Wow, wow, wow, this is an absolute must for anybody visiting Singapore, so worth the few dollars you pay to go up to the Skypark if you are not a hotel guest.

Now, I'm not keen on heights and so when we first arrived way up there almost in the clouds, I stood well away from the edge with my back casually attached to the wall of the building. My man happily snapped away at all the wonderful views to be had while I felt quite comfortable staying where I was. However, after we had ascended the few steps to the Ku De Ta bar, sat there for a couple of hours and enjoyed a couple of jugs of champagne daquiries, I was as keen on getting to the edge to photograph the great Gardens by the Bay and everything else spread out before us. The Ku De Ta is fantastic, and I can't wait to get back there in July, but this time we will have a meal up there as well. And if you are looking for some nice souvenirs of your visit, I have found that the jigsaw puzzles they sell there are an absolute hit with folks back home.

Do go."
,,Nice work,5.0,,"I had doubts whether to go there or not, but believe me you will have the best views of singapore skyline from here!, the fee was 20 S$, with the last admission being around 10 pm. The pool area is only for the guests, although with in certain times some guided tours are available to take a maximum of 50 people to have a close look at the pool area.
Actually From the observation deck at one end you can see the end of the pool and people swimming in it!
Well done singapore!"
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,"An outstanding opportunity to see Singapore either by night or day, save the fee to the top and buy a drink in the bar instead, you'll see all the same views, it's definitely a must do in Singapore"
,,Great view,3.0,,Really is an amazing view. $20 per person though. Better to eat at Ku De Ta and see the view that way. Or swim in the pool
,,fantastic views,4.0,,superb view of the Singapore skyline but not alot up there mainly due to the Hotel guests requiring privacy which is understandable. No sit down cafe until after 12:00
,,Amazing views,5.0,,This is a great place to see the views across Singapore and although alot of people think the price tag is steep I think its still worth the money. We visited during the day and it was really hot and there really is no shade up on the platform although there is a little kiosk you can buy a drink to cool off!! I would definately recommend this attraction to see the skyline of Singapore.
,,Top of the views,4.0,,"Go to tower 3 and miss the queuing hoards and the charge. Straight to the bar and a drink. A must do but very busy and the pool looks like a nightmare,crowded regimented and noisy."
,,Fantastic View and Good Food,5.0,,"We stayed 6 nights in MBS and I guess we had 4 lunches in the poolside bar so we loved it a lot ;)
In late March it offers cold ocean breeze that is really wonderful. The view is great and poolside bar foods and snacks those were being served in Skypark are great as well."
,,Outstanding views,5.0,,"Great views both towards CBD and the Gardens by the Bay. The price appears to be on the high side considering the limited access to the deck. However, the visit is definitely worthwhile."
,,WOW. The construct and views are great,4.0,,"It is truly something you need to see. Singapore is all about the man-made architecture so go check this area out. Go into the hotel, go to the bar on level 57 and take in the skyline/birdseyeview of Singapore."
,,Go for a drink at the bar up top. Free entry.,5.0,,"Visited on a busy morning, and found staff friendly. Easy to get to by MTR. You can buy a 1,2 or 3 day trip pass to use MTR. If you want to go up the top of Marina Bay Sands it will cost you $20, but it is better value to say you want to go to the bar on the top floor for a drink. It is free entry, and you can spend your money on a drink there. (Not cheap though), but hey it was less than the $20 and you still get a very similar view from the top, just not from the front. There are a couple of places to take excellent photos."
,,Proud of the view..,3.0,,We paid the price and went up to see the view from the Marina Bay Sand observation deck. The view is very nice and while I have no real regret the price was quite high. There are many nice vantage points in Singapore to see the skyline so if your on a budget maybe this is money best used elsewhere.
,,one time visit,3.0,,"I was expecting something really grand but personally it wasnt money's worth. The view was OK. Because its a tourist attraction that would justify the pricing but if i was given the chance to go again, i wouldnt, even if it was free."
,,High in the sky,5.0,,"I marvel at Singapore each trip. What they do not have as natural scenery & attractions, they create. Well worth the visit in the evening for the light show and well worth a day time trip to do the skywalk between trees. I dread heights but was glad I forced myself to do this one."
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,Access to the Skypark is limited on the basic ticket to the viewing gallery and does not permit entrance to the restaurant or infinity pool. This problem aside the views of Singapore are amazing. During our stay American Express card holders got a 25% saving on any second ticket purchased.
,,Worth a go,4.0,,Cost $20 sing. But worth the visit on the express elevator to the top of this magnificant feat of engineering where you see the city of Singapore stretching out in front of you. You have to spend min of $50 though if you want to sit and enjoy with a drink or food.
,,Go to the top,4.0,,Cost $20 sing. But worth the experience to take the express elevator to the top and see the whole of Singapore from this magnificiant building.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark...what a hotel,5.0,,The most impressive hotel I have ever been to. The view from the top was amazing and to see the infinity pool on the 57th floor was something. A must do when visiting Singapore.
,,Great View,4.0,,The view from the Marina Bay Sands Skypark was great. I would recommend it if you decide not to go on the Singapore Flyer as they both provide a similar view of the city. The skypark costs 20sgd which is probably the most i would want to spend. The cafe/bar was not open when we went up at 11am so i was a little disappointed. We were staying at the Swissotel Stamford and the view from the City Space Bar on the top floor was just as impressive but i do feel the location of the Skypark provides for a broader view of the city. Im not disappointed i went but i wouldnt pay to go back again
,,Really hot at daytime!,4.0,,"Well, this is a the better alternative than the Singapore flyer because you'll be seeing almost everything you'll see in the flyer. Moreover, it's higher than the flyer."
,,Wow Infinity Pool,5.0,,"Brilliant, as soon as the elevator door opens, to look out over Singapore is amazing. The pool can get quite busy but there is also a adults only section which is a bit more relaxing"
,,Awesome :),4.0,,Marina Bay Sands is very creatively build and good place to walk around there nice view of city specially in night time . Great Experience I had there good place to spend time for couples.
,,great view,4.0,,Great view but you only get to see a small portion of the observation deck... Better to eat at the restaurants instead unless you can get the tour (fills up early)
,,Marina Bay 57th Floor is a must,5.0,,"If in Singapore, don't miss it. The view overlooking Singapore is phenomenal, and the infinity pool is out of this world. Order a drink and enjoy!"
,,Beautiful view!,5.0,,You can have spectacular view of Singapore city at night from the roof top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The hotel itself is a one of the best landmark I have ever seen. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,You wont be disappointed the views from up here are amazing! Definately worth a visit whilst in Singapore.
,,Must join the free guide tour,4.0,,"There are only 3 tours per day (50 ppl per tour) which is free to join if you purchase your ticket onsite, this tour allow you to actully walk into the infinity pool area to have a close look, great for photo taking. (of coz u cant swimming there~~)

anwsome!!!!"
,,On Top of the World,5.0,,definatly worth the £15.00 to get to the top. the veiws are amazing. Its a lovely way to sepnd a couple of hours.
,,Amazing View,3.0,,"When in singapore definatly make sure you take a trip up the top of Marina Bay sands. The view is amazing, you can see over the hole city and the Bar on the top is ok price £6.00 for a redbull so not to bad considering where you are. The people pester to take your photos, make sure you let them as they will take photos with your camera once they are finnnished and you dont need to buy the ones they took."
,,Best view in Singapore,4.0,,"It's exclusive only to hotel guests. While visitors have to pay an entrance fee.
Lovely viewing deck boasts some of the most stunning views of Singapore city and its coastline. The pool however can be rather crazy. But you just have to take a dip in it and swim to the edge overlooking the Merlion. But be forewarned, the water is ice cold, even on a hot hot day. But well worth the experience, in spite of the crazy crowd."
,,Stunning views,4.0,,You need to know that you have to pay S$20 to go to the viewing platform and extra if you want to visit the garden and pool area. If you intend to go to the restaurant and bar at the top mention this and access fees may not be charged. The views are incredible and I would advise anyone to go. The shopping centre opposit is also very nice.
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,"We went up at night and the view was spectacular. The viewing deck was smaller than i thought it would be but you'll still get an amazing view of the bay.

There is a bar on the top of the sky deck but there is a dress code for it : no flip flops .. So if you think u may want to have a drink up there, be sure to dress for it before hand."
,,A little disappointing,3.0,,"We didn’t do the sky package thing, we went for a drink at the sky bar, which is free apart from Friday and Sat evenings. Drinks are pricey, but you get to see the same views as you would with the package. The views were just ok. Not as many nice lights at night as I hoped for. The swimming pool looks much better in pictures than in real life. I’m happy we didn’t stay at the hotel."
,,Breath taking view of Singapore from Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,This is one of world's most amazing construction marvel. You can have a panamoric view of whole of Singapore Sky Line from the observatory deck here.
,,Good place to lepak but not much F&B choices,3.0,,"Good place to lepak in the evening with friends. However, there are not much F&B choices if you require outdoor seating where smoking is allowed. If KU DE TA is booked for corporate functions, you are left with only Sky on 57 (serves Franco Asian Cuisine) or the Chocolate Bar (S$38++ per pax). We decided to go for the Chocolate Bar but seriously, how much chocolate can one eat? They should have allowed some ala carte menus. The staff were nice and professional though."
,,Awesome View,5.0,,Costs $20/pp to go up and see the view -- a one-trip only ticket so choose time (day/night) to see view you desire. And if day go when it is clear and not hazy.
,,Spectacular view,5.0,,"Spectacular view of the city, the cruise ships ( on Saturday when they're in port) , the many boats and ships in the sea and marina. Cheapest beer is $15 , soft drinks $8, so you pay for the view. So with tax and tip, easy to spend $40 for just 1 drink each for 2 people. But it's definitely worth it! They give you wasabi potato chips which we liked, but some people didn't eat much of theirs, I don't know why, various reasons I guess. It was fairly crowded but we got a pretty good view. People were very friendly and offered to takeout photo for us. Not to be missed!!!! Just the view is worth it. We spent about 1 hour there and saw the big rain cloud move across part of the city. ..interesting"
,,Disappointed,3.0,,"I was expecting a lot. I did the queue, pay the hefty price and took the elevator up. When I reach their it was only an observation deck and the access for Ku Deta restaurant. Thats it. You only see the city from a glass, take a picture and finish. Everything for 20 SGD. And you can also see a little bit of the pool from one of the corner!! just a little bit....

I truly feel scam. I wasn't expecting to swim on the pool or been in the middle but at least having the chance of seeing the full structure. I know that for that they have a more expensive way of doing it by taking a tour but the schedule are scatter and its usually full.

Would not recommend it."
,,Make sure to find out the times they do the tour first before going,4.0,,"They have tours around 9am, 1PM and 4PM. I think.... Anyway, if you don't then you just spend the money and stand on an observation deck. At least if you do the tour you see the rest of the top.

After doing that go into the casino. Crazy big!! Makes Vegas Casinos look tiny with the vast size rooms. Make sure you have your passport as they check it when you go in and when you leave. That was wierd being asked to show my identity on the way out. LOL!
Bottom line you will not get into the casino without a passport.

Killer shopping in the mall there also."
,,over-priced and disappointing,3.0,,"We were disappointed by our trip up here up here,it takes quite a while to get up there and costs 20 singapore dollars,then the areas you can get to are limited
We would probably recommend saving your money,watch it and the laser shows from the ground,and have another Singapore Sling at Raffles instead ."
,,The pool was oh-so awesome!,5.0,,There's the large infinite pool and there are many small jacuzzi wading pools around. Good for couples and children. Best view of Singapore here while swimming with people from around the world. Just amazing!
,,"See it to believe it, the swimming pool on such a height.......",5.0,,"Wonderful experience if you are staying and enjoying the swim in the pool, that is one of a kind.
Otherwise it's equally wonderful to enjoy a drink at kudeta, while enjoying people and the place, go in day light and finish your trip when the lights are on and it's lightening beautiful view of Singapore.dont miss the water and light laser show at the the marina bay sands on your way back."
,,A must do visit !,5.0,,A little short for a visit but exceptional all the same. Cost of some 30$'s worth it for the spectacular views but drinks / snacks etc expensive .....
,,Amazing views of the city,4.0,,"The marina bay sands casino and resort primarily comprises of hotels, large shopping malls, a casino and the viewing deck on top. The views of the city are amazing from here, and i'd say it has far better view than the flyer. We were here during sunset and got some great snaps. It offers view of the flyer and gardens by the bay as well. They also have a cafe and restaurant on top so you can have your drink, but the pool is open only to hotel guests i believe.
Oh, and they don't allow tripods..."
,,Landmark of Singapore,4.0,,"This is the second time I visited the Sands Shopping Mall, I like the food court due to there are variety food available, price is reasonable even though it is one of the attractions in Singapore. The malls are mainly selling branded stuff with easy accessing the casino from different entrance.

The mall can be accessed by MRT. It is easy to take taxi as well.

LV flagship store, Museum are located opposite the bay. It is beautiful scenery viewing the downtown and Ferris Wheel from the mall. There are lots of people jogging outside the mall as well. There are bistros outside the malls with nice environment."
,,Must view sight,4.0,,go to the top and view the city at night - awesome. bring camera for some best shots. Dining is expensive but worth every penny.
,,"Great View, Go at Night only",4.0,,"Its far to smoggy in SG during the day, go at night and be there for 9pm water and laser light show over the Marina. Also if you stay at MBS the Sky Park is free, just don't forget your pool pass."
,,not a worth,3.0,,the view from skypark is similar to singapore flyer with $ 20 entry ticket one can go only a small area of ship the pool and other areas & facilities only for the hotel guests. if you are going then try to take a fix guided tour and see the remaining areas of it the entry for skypark is from tower three and lift is nice less then a minute you are at the 57th floor the view is nice in the evening at sunset time garden of bay & waterfront area is look nice from top &roads look like a car video game.
,,Good view up there,5.0,,"Such a good Singapore view up there. A lot of tourist but not that much. Better go with good skill photographer so you will get a great picture with the blue sky, crazy pose! Don't care of other eyes on you!!! The best time to visit is 4.30-21.00 pm"
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"Only hotel guests can access the top pool area. Outsider tourists can take the elevator from tower #1 to to the top for 20SGD and walk around the front of the ""ship"" which offers a spectacular view over gardens by the bay and the whole marine bay and backgrounding skyscrapers"
,,Stunning views!,4.0,,"The Skypark had amazing views from the public area and is worth the trip and cost. Given you go up 57 floors in under a minute, the lift does not even feel like it moves.
You will have to pay $20 to go up and have a look and more if you want to go on one of the guided tours.
As is tradition now at all the tourist attractions, they take your photo......if you want it be prepared to pay $45.
You can stay up there as long as you want during the skypark's business hours."
,,Could use a few chairs...,3.0,,"Entering SkyPark costs one SGD20 if you're not staying in Marina Bay Sands. I did enjoy having a view of Singapore especially since I just went to Gardens By The Bay and appreciated seeing it from a higher perspective. Since I visited around 6PM, the lights from the buildings weren't turned on yet, so the view might have been better at night.

Would have wanted chairs to have been present there, though. Guests ended up sitting on the floor to rest, so a lot of us were in clusters by the floor enjoying the view and waiting for sunset. A telescope might have been nice, as well.

Hoping they work on these soon."
,,"Wow, What a View",5.0,,"Stunning view of Singapore City to one side and Gardens by the Bay on the other. While we visited at night, I would recommend late afternoon to see the sun set, then go downstairs for the light show at the front of the complex."
,,Nice new Area,4.0,,"Lovely Views, the best swimming pool at Marina Sands, expensive drinks though be careful, bottle of chardonnay costs £59"
,,night show must go on,5.0,,"beauty view in nighttime and daytime. Good choice is go there by boat, I think in nighttime when performance gone. Important building in area of Marina Bay. Other experience to use swimming pool on the top of building"
,,can try if you want to have a bird eye view,3.0,,overall this is a nice place to have sight seeing u can see the coastline and also have a look at the Central Business District ( CBD ) area. day time might be hot and night time the night view is truly beautiful
,,overpriced money grab,3.0,,"interesting way to see the city, but we were very disappointed to wait in line for a ticket, only to find out that to have a drink or something to eat, you need to make a reservation back in the hotel...we were not going to leave the line, go line up back upstairs, then line up again! and $20...pretty steep. Now that I have done it once, I won't do it again."
,,Best views ever,5.0,,We were lucky to be able to utilise the viewing platforms whilst dining at the restaurant Ku De Ta. I would say that this must be one of the best man made platforms I have used.
,,View to die for,5.0,,"There is and should be only one reason to view the skylark at marina bay sands - the million dollar view. While the management would have u believe there's great foodanda delectable chocolate buffet, the view has to take utmost priority as nothing else at the deck comes close to distracting you. Well, maybe for the girls in sexy bikini in the infinity pool... :)"
,,imposing,4.0,,"a very imposing Architectural feat indeed. The visitors are no longer allowed to go upto the infinity edge pool and limited only to the skywalk deck, still worth a visit to the 56th floor to view Singapore below."
,,"$20, could have eaten 4 meals for that.",1.0,,"you only see a small section of it with no view off the pool area unless you book a tour, witch always seem to be booked out. nothing to do up there unless you have a mortgage for lunch!!!"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"Stayed at the hotel for a few nights and spent a lot of time at the Skypark. Mainly at the pool. The horizon pool is just spectacular!

Drinks are not cheap but come quickly and well made (cocktails), and the service is fast efficient and unobtrusive.

NOTE: You can NOT visit the pool unless you are a guest staying at the hotel. Now I understand why - it was always busy but not crowded. Any more people and it would ruin the experience!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is the perfect way to begin your evening in Singapore. Go to the roof for sunset to see the skyline take on a different look. They had a light show after dark too which was stunning. It seems like all the buildings work in unison to create a magical effect.

Definitely worth the price although I didn't eat or drink up there so cannot comment on that."
,,An amazing view of Singapore from way up there,4.0,,"From the observation deck, you can see the amazing view of Singapore. If you stay at the hotel, you can enter for free. But if you are not a hotel guest, you have to pay for entrance fee. Not sure how much though."
,,Beautiful building,5.0,,"The building is impressive. The view from the skypark too, you can see all the financial area and the sea with lot and lots of boats. You can´t see the infinity pool very well, but worth a visit."
,,Marina bay sands,4.0,,"Nice to see how the other half live. A beautiful place with lots to see. I took the $20 trip up to the top and got great views of the city, would have been even nicer at night with all the buildings lit up. Probably one of the cheaper methods of having a good look at the city below."
,,Worth a look .. particularly if you're not staying the the hotel,4.0,,Make a booking and have a drink at Ku Da Ta.. very impressive views. The passionfruit mojitos were my personal favourite served here.
,,Infinity pool on L57,4.0,,Spectacular view and to be experienced at least once. It is expensive for food and drinks. Best to go early morning or late evening.
,,Tanker on top of a building ?,5.0,,"Infinity pool, waterfall and palm trees on top of the structure. This is mainly a private area but small numbers of interested people can pay to go up and see the view from the top. Best to go early."
,,What a view from the surfboard,5.0,,"first I thought 20 SGS was kinda high, but then once you are on top you'll enjoy the view, we visited during the day, must be great at night too, we were on the Singapore Flyer the night before, spectacular!!"
,,Vegas,4.0,,"A bit Vegas-y but the view and cocktails were unbeatable. We went late afternoon which was nice after a day of sightseeing but beware, there is a dress code after 6pm."
,,a bit touristy but very cool,4.0,,Great views and interesting footbal pitch in the water. We had cocktails at the Marina Bay Sands which were very good.
,,Amazing views over Singapore,4.0,,"As part of a whistlestop stopover tour of the city, the Skypark was high on our list of attractions and we weren't disappointed! Although initially it felt a bit steep at SG$20 each for what is essentially a quick trip in a fast lift, once up there the almost 360º views were well worth the price. Camera buffs will love the photo opportunities and we took dozens of great shots of the marina, gardens, cityscape and riverside. Much of the rooftop area is only accessible to hotel guests and so we were a little surprised to find that the one public restaurant/bar was completely booked out to a private party (?) and we were shown into another bar - usually reserved for hotel guests! Pleasant enough, it was very 'clubby' and drinks were expensive - but not too surprising given the luxurious surroundings of the very impressive hotel complex. Worth doing if you have time during your visit/stopover."
,,Wow so high!!!!!,5.0,,"What a gorgeous place to visit, especially the skypark's observation deck, the views are amazing, you can see for miles, its well worth the visit. We went just on dusk and watched Singapore light up it was out of this world. The staff were very helpful and friendly."
,,great view,4.0,,great view of the city. amazing building and location. The spcae at the top of the building without any obstruction of the sea and city is unique.
,,OK,3.0,,Place was lovely... Service was excellent... Food was OK not bad just not GREAT.... I hate to be critical and the food was good BUT... missing something! There was no WOW factor. Staff were excellent and the place was lovely but overall was just OK.
,,Skypark,5.0,,"Amazing on the outside as well as inside. Views are spectacular, lovely restaurants downstairs, I missed going here in 2011 so had to do in 2012. Was glad I took the time to visit. On th ebus tour route so jump off adn go inside."
,,Nice Views,4.0,,"Absolutely Amazing Views, but very expensive and there are not opportunities to sit down.
Nonetheless definitely worth the Visit when you are in Singapore, just for the Experience.
While you are there, have a drink at the bar below. Although pricey as well, but again, it's an experience."
,,Not so impressive,3.0,,"The view is ok, not something great. May be that is because I got there in night time, with last admission but I was not so impressed. Long queue for the tickets, I could not buy ticket for 8 pm as everything was sold out and I was the last one who managed to get ticket for the last admission. So, may be it is better to buy tickets in advance to avoid dissapointment. In my opinion it is way too expensive."
,,"Amazing view, but price is a rip-off",4.0,,An alternative option is to just go to the bar on the next floor up. Ridiculously expensive but still less than the SGD20 admission fee to walk around on the floor below. The only downside to the bar is that you have to sit at a table so you can't walk around and take in the entire (close to 360 degree) view as much as when you're on the floor below.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"This is Singapore at its best, saying ""look at me!"" And you can, if you take the fast lift to the top. The views are terrific and most of the city is laid out before you. If you have never been to Singapore before, indulge in this bird's eye view of many of its attractions. Cannot comment on the price as our generous Singapore friends treated us."
,,At least on Top of Singapore,5.0,,"Visiting the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands is an wonderful experience. Unfortunately we did not get tickets for the conducted tour and had to be satisfied with normal visit to the 56th & 57th floor observation terrace. As we had gone just before sunset, we could see the key spots of Singapore in day light as well as well lit in the evening dazzle. A bit pricey, but worth it."
,,The view is awesome but the price is a complete scam!,2.0,,"You would expect to pay for drinks at the top of a hotel, maybe stay for dinner or pay maybe 5 dollars to go see what it looks like, but the price is ridiculous, the view is nice but you can only get to a certain part of the terrace and... thats it!! Nowhere to sit, cant walk around, there is just a roof and a overprices souvenir shop, the view again is nice, but I really dont thinks its worth that much, specially since its a hotel! I mean its not their main income so why make it so ridiculously expensive to go on a elevator that your customers use anyways, wouldnt pay them again if I had a choice"
,,Nice view,4.0,,Went there during our stay at the hotel. Nice sun rise and sun set views. Swam also but the pool was too crowded.
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,Incredible building design and over the top experience going up to the 57th floor and enjoying a drink and the view! Can see the ehole of the city and harbour - really worthwhile experience.
,,Good views,3.0,,"Expensive to get to the top, views are awesome, but there is no place to sit and enjoy the view. Some people sat on the floor and they were moved on by the security guards. The day we went the access to see the infinity pool was closed. Rather disappointing apart for the view. There is no shade"
,,On a clear day...,4.0,,"...you can see forever. Fab experience, wonderfully high and amazing views of the city. It's a bit pricey because, in reality, it takes about three minutes to walk round, but still worth doing."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Worth a visit if you can stand heights!! On a clear day, which is not always the case in Singapore, the Skypark is a must visit"
,,Worth the price,4.0,,"I paid about 20 dollars for a pass and went at night time to see all the city lights. Even though it was raining, I still enjoyed the breathtaking views, so I definitely recommend it! If you are one of the ~20 first to purchase your ticket, you are allowed to go on an extra tour of the infinity pool that the guest use. It was cool but not amazing. If you don't make it to the extra tour, don't worry, you are not missing too much."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"Loved coming here, was a nice place, amazing views of Singapore and well worth the price paid... The pool is just amazing, shame I couldnt go in it Would definitely recommend and would go again if going to Singapore"
,,Brilliant. A must see.,5.0,,This was my second visit to Marina Bay Sands but my first going up to the sky park. Well worth the visit and simply breathtaking views. We also did the tour of the infinity pool which showed us what we were missing out on. Amazing.
,,Highlight of my Singapore trip,5.0,,Even although it rained for an hour or so I wouldn't have missed this visit for the world. The views from the top are absolutely spectacular and even wandering about down on the ground floor is quite awesome. The architectural engineering achievement is something else. Hats off to the person who dreamed this one up.
,,This place has great views.,4.0,,"City &port views are wonderful. No information boards to tell you what you are looking at.... Fortunately.we were with 2 younger family members who knew the city reasonably well. Amazingly, they give discount if you pay with American Express. The luxury shopping mall at ground and lower floors ( free and not part of the attraction) is interesting for a couple of minutes when it became nauseating."
,,Yes you can see the infinity pool on a tour,5.0,,"We went to see the skypark to see the sunset around 7 pm but on check in we became aware that there was a limit of 50 places for a tour of the ""guests only"" 150 m infinity pool area. It is free and included in the $20 admission price. The skypark is amazing but seeing the pool area was the icing on the cake"
,,Best Spot for photo shoot,4.0,,"For photo hunters, this is the spot for you. best time to be there is when sunset and it gets dark. but if you're not staying in the hotel, and you only intend to see the view, u will need to pay $20 to get up there. but it's worth it, considering the view you will get and you can stay as long as you need. the first time you stepped in, you will find many people just sit on the floor of the skypark while enjoying the view. but when it starts to get dark, there was security popped out of nowhere, and telling you not to sit on the floor. The other option is, you can get into the KuDeTa Skybar, then you don;t need to pay. just buy the drink at KuDeTa. but flippers, shorts are not allowed. you have to be dressed up to get in there. but overall... it's an awesome location to hang out and enjoying the view."
,,Gardens By the Bay,5.0,,"Spend a day here, with a walk around the gardens, see the Electric trees, and visit the two enclosures. Places to eat and shop are really nice and clean. Not expensive, brilliant views, take an umbrella though, it will be needed."
,,OMG,5.0,,"if you have Vertigo or fear of heights in anyway, stay off this skypark, I was paralysed by the sheer height of the place. I couldn't really relax and enjoy the amazing views until I was able to go upstairs to the bar area and feel a bit more secure. My husband and 10 year old loved it, hanging over the edge for the best pictures etc."
,,You are on top of the World,5.0,,"If you are looking for a place that is high in the sky provides you a panoramic view of Singapore, this is the place to be. The swimming pool is glorious because it is like you are going to fall at the edges. This is not for those acrophobic people. You can stay here and get crispy friend. Before you do that partake in their beautiful potato chips. They are nice and brown. The best!"
,,Great Overlook on the City!,5.0,,It is worth the 20 SGD to go to the skydeck and take in the view. There is a small bar and a place to eat while hanging out up there.
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,5.0,,"Breathtaking views of Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline. Absolutely ridiculous. Like, whoa. Really cool spot to check out."
,,Sundowners,5.0,,"Great location for a drink ( but not cheap ) , after 6.00 smart casual requried , no short pants for guys."
,,Too commerical,3.0,,"Too commerical from my view. Spend SGD20 for person to the rooftop to see the 'buildings', not quite interest. Many groups and tourist around from different nations. Depending the lifestyle, do not push to be there."
,,Excellent views of the esplanade,5.0,,"If you plan to take the best pictures of the Singapore financial district, you should pay the 15$ and go up to the Marina Bay Sand rooftop terrace. You'll never forget that impresive views. Better at night"
,,great park with great view,5.0,,"it is the most perfect park, with a great view if you are in Singapore you must visit it. kids will love it and prepare your camera to take perfect shots of Singapore"
,,Great view,4.0,,"We went to the sky park mid morning to beat the crowds. Cost is $20 entry and you can only stand on the end. No view of pool area or rest of skypark unless you staying there.
Views are fabulous and tower much higher than flyer. Would recommend as a must do still."
,,Fantastic views of Singapore,4.0,,Do not miss the opportunity to see Singapore from the sky. The views from the Skypark are terrific (well worth the admission price - seniors get a discount). We've got some wonderful photos of the city as the viewing platform gives you unobstructed views in all directions.
,,Spectacular View,5.0,,"This is a place one MUST visit - best around sun set. At night, the bar / nightclub is vibrant. The view is spectacular and one can enjoy drinks whilst overlooking the whole of Singapore. Dinner at the restaurant is also great but a bit pricy."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,If you want some amazing views of Singapore make sure you go up here. You can also follow the route of the F1 racetrack which goes through the city if you get it up on your phone (there was fee wifi in the hotel/complex). It is a little crowded and would be good if they have some information signs so you know what you're looking at.
,,Blows you away,4.0,,"Its a wee bit expensive (20$) pp but it is a incredible view from up there. Go for the sunset and watch the lights of Singapore come on. Doing 57 floors in less than 30 secs is also something to experience, your ears go pop!"
,,"No benches to sit on, and no indications of what you are looking at.",3.0,,I have been to many viewing galleries around the world. Firstly this place lacked any benches to take a break from the hot Singapore heat. Then there were signs asking visitors to not sit on the broardwalk. The other thing that irritated me was that there were no placards to inform tourist what were the landmarks in the direction they were looking at.....could do more for $20.
,,Sands Skypark,5.0,,Better than Singapore Flyer. You need to book in advance to have proper guided tour and get access to the whole area. Guide is included in the ticket price but without the guide you can't access to the whole area
,,Outstanding.....,5.0,,Ignore those who claim its too expensive..... It is well worth it. $20 to go up and the beer is $12 but the views are OUTSTANDING. Spend the money and go enjoy a couple of hours on the top of the world!
,,Outstanding views,5.0,,"We had no idea about this venue... while we were in the cab to the zoo we saw this amazing structure and had to examine it further....

Wow... well worth the $20 pp to be on top of the world. We stayed up there for hours and hours..... The most expensive beer we have ever had... but the most outstanding and well worth every dime. Some reviews have said it was overpriced... but it is NOT. Consider where you are...... ""the top of the world"" 57 floors up, outstanding view and a $12 beer..... All well worth it...

When you are there.... take time to go and walk through the pools for the hotel patrons.... Amazing affinity pools and hot tubs.... I didn't price out the hotel ... but imagine it would be an amazing stay."
,,High point to see Singapore,5.0,,"This is great as you can see indonesia on one side and the rest of singapore on the other2 sides.
The fourth side is blocked off for hotel guess which also has the infinity pool on the other side.
A great place to take photos and see where you want to go next or where you have been.
There is a bar at the top too if you fancy a drink.
Be prepared to swollow your saliver when you are riding the lift as there is only 2 floors. G and skypark.
if you like sceenary like me, you can spend hours up there."
,,What an architecture,5.0,,"I was planing to use the swimming pool for a day but even with charge they are not allowing. This must be open even for limited number, and they have to provide advance reservation for outside usage"
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,The experience and the view from the skypark is not to be missed. I am not 100% happy with heights in general but the layout and construction of this skypark make it feel as if you are not as high as you really are.
,,Superb View on top!!,5.0,,I been there on the morning. There's quite amazing view on top. But nothing to do actually. Just only look around and enjoy the superb view of Singapore. I think if you guys are going there at night should be better :)
,,Rather Expensive for just the View,3.0,,"Tickets
Ticketing counter for Skypark Observation Deck at Marina Bay Sands (Skypark) is located on a separate venue outside the hotel, right after the hotel's tower 3. I happened to purchase a combo ticket at SGD38 which entitled me for access to Skypark as well as Artscience Museum (separate review for the latter). In all, the Skypark ticket after discount cost $15 (normal is $20).

The Experience
The experience begin with a photoshoot right after the turnstile gate. You may opt to decline, but the staff is rather pushy to get your picture taken. Right after, a normal size elevator (but high speed) awaits you, there is a total of three high speed elevator shared by Skydeck's public guests (access from G), hotel guests (access from 1st), and the Skypark (on 56th and 57th - the latter is restricted to restaurant guests). Unlike other observation deck experience, no ""guide"" providing info on the attraction available (either a person guide or electronic guide), nor anything special during the climb up/down the elevator.
P.S. Free guided service for limited guests is available on select hours only.

The Skypark Deck
Arriving on 56th floor, those who take photo can purchase their photo on the booth before entering the deck. The deck is basically designed in circular shape so guests can come in from one side and exit from another circling some restaurants and open deck area on the 57th floor. The view was stunning with lots to see: gardens by the bay, offices in Raffles Place, Esplanade and Marina Bay view and more.
One thing that's missing is perhaps the binoculars, seating, and shaded area. On a cloudy day of my visit, I could see lots of guests are sitting on the wooden deck doing their picnic or just enjoying the view or having a chat. There is also no information on the view which could be an added value of the attraction which so far is felt like paying the entrance fee to pay for the construction of the place and staff's salary only.

Facilities
Washroom for men and women is available near the elevator area. A cafe and shops are on one side of the deck selling Skypark merchandise (which one can also find on the gift shop in tower 2 of the hotel lobby area). The cafe has limited bar and open air seating. Not much visitors are using the facilities on my personal observation.

Staff
Staff is generally welcoming and friendly but you could see most of the time they're just enjoying themselves by chatting to each other (in loud manner) even when guests are around.

Verdict
While my expectation is rather high for ""observation deck"" type of attraction, the Skypark which has ""budget airline"" model of operation is rather expensive. For the basic admission you paid, basically you just got the access to the deck and that's all. For all other services; you have to pay extra such as audio guide rental, merchandise, food and drink, etc..."
,,An excellent view of Singapore Bay area.,4.0,,For me this was amazing to do and see but i wouldn't pay to go up there again. The view was spectacular and the pool area interesting.
,,A 'must visit' if in Singapore.,5.0,,"This is a trip not to miss. Best at night-time if you like spectacle.
A great way to get the feel of the place even on a short stopover
Get a taxi there and go up to the 57th floor. We paid nothing to get up there, possibly by going up with hotel guests.
View fantastic, way above the Singapore Flyer big wheel.
Take a coffee at one of the restaurants with outside seating and take in the view at leisure.
All of the city and the new Botanical Gardens before you, lit by night. Remember your camera!
Marvel at the sizeof the hotel and take a long walk through the Mall. Never knew that there were so many designer brands- and all in one place!
Outside you are likely to find a light show and, when we went on Saturday evening, an orchestra and laser display. All for free.
Return on the water taxi for a fantastic evening view of the impressive cityscape.
So good we did the whole thing twice."
,,Wonderful views from the sky deck and amazing interior designs,5.0,,"Marina sands bay is a MUST see attraction, the amazing structure of the hotel and the sky deck that is overlooking the city is a breath taking experience, best time to visit is before sunset so you get to see the skyline of the city in it's glorious moment."
,,Stunning view!,5.0,,"Although i need to pay extra SGD20 to get up there (as i am not the hotel guest), but it didn't disappoint me. I manage to see the whole layout of Garden by the Bay and the amazing city landscapes around the city during sunset and night time. This is truly a wonderful experience! The only exception was perhaps the ticket price (SGD20) should come with the complimentary welcome drink? :D

Also, they should also open up the bar / lounge for visitor or non-in house guest patronize without any dress code requirement..."
,,Expensive trip up top,3.0,,"We got there early to go on one of the 'free' tours, if you are going to go up to the top I highly recommend that you get there early to do the 'free' tour, otherwise you are paying just to go to a small viewing platform on the top. There are no seats there to sit on so once you've seen the view ( which is very good on a clear day) there is nothing else to do
The 'free' tour takes groups of 50 people 3 times a day to one of three areas on top if the tower, fir 15 minutes. you can view the infinity pool from here, however it is sectioned off, you aren't allowed to close to it and definitely not in the pool - this is just for guests of the hotel.
You'd be devastated to pay for a stay in the hotel over a rainy day."
,,excellent,5.0,,"High class, modern, 5 star hotel and attraction; best views of Marina Bay from the very top of this hotel and its Skypark; there's even the highest outdoor infinity swimming pool (supposedly). The only downside is that the pool is accessible exclusively to guests of the hotel."
,,Stunning!,5.0,,"This is by far the best view we saw anywhere in Singapore. Yes, it is pretty expensive (and all the fee entitles you to do is walk around one half of the roof top) but we loved it. It just felt really bizarre to be overlooking the city from so far away and so high up. We also went on the Singapore Flyer and if I had to choose between the two I would go with Marina Bay Sands Skypark every time."
,,Treat yourself......its worth every penny!!!,5.0,,"I was upgraded to a one bedroom suite so this added to my experience but overall staying in this hotel is just an amazing experience I cannot recommend enough. The infinity pool, restaurants and bars on the top floor are deluxe and offer a brilliant view of Singapore! We had our dinner and cocktails poolside and overlooking the night time skyline. It really is the life!"
,,worth visiting,4.0,,"If you stay at Marina Bay Sands, you should go there of course as it is free but if you come to this place only ,you have to pay money and you might be disappointed.
You can enjoy good view but you can do that from other places as well and you can swim but for the swimming there should be better places. It depends on how much expectation you have in advance and make up your own story."
,,Impressive,4.0,,"If you consider yourself a frequent traveller or beyond and still have kept a little bit of naiveté, you may be quite like us. So chances are, on your first trip to Singapore you will lounge at the - very nice - pool at the Mandarin Oriental on day one, eyeing the bombastic extravaganza of the Marina Bay Sands Pool which boasts the longest (or highest, cannot remember) rooftop pool in the world and think ""oh, tomorrow, I will leave our pool and swim over there to check if it is so much different"" (""our"" would be the Mandarin's pool, which is absolutely fantastic).
Day two. You decide for some truly fabulous swimming gear and venture over to the Marina Sands, taking photos and laving to Louis Vuitton's private island in Singapore's most prestigious bit of water. Considering Singapore's climate leaves you drenched in sweat, you will arrive at the Marina Sands in what shall we call it - well, a quite disshelved and not so polished state. Upon arrival, you will learn that the Marina Bay Sands' pool is only open to hotel guests, but that you can visit the Skypark for a quite small fee anytime you please - how about now.
Feeling like a prize idiot, you will hand over the entrance fee, take an elevator ride complete with humiliating tourist pictures before departure, wander around with your swimming bag for a few minutes on top, take some compulsory photos, modestly and politely decline the professional photos offered to you of your ascent to the top, and then venture back to the comfort of the Mandarin. There, you will change into your swimming gear to conclude your day poolside with the thought that ""well, we would not like it either, if anybody could just come over to our pool here, wouldn't we.""
Glass of cool white wine in your hand, a luxurious day of being stupid comes to a close. Good night, Singapore."
,,Expensive and couldn't even have a drink!,2.0,,"We had planned to have a drink up the top at the bar, however were unable to because we were wearing shorts. We weren't aware of this at all, we were on holidays and it wasn't exactly cool so we were very disappointed. I think they are limiting themselves of the potential for tourists buying drinks by something so simple as shorts. I can understand thongs, etc, but shorts? Come on! Anyway because of that it ended up being a huge waste of $40 each for us to just have a look over the edge."
,,Crazy building,4.0,,"It is worth paying for a vist to the sky park, the views are amazing. The hotel is an an incredible peice of architecture, you just can't imagine what was going through the architects mind!"
,,Very nice complex!,5.0,,"We were in Singapore 2 nights and 1,5 days one of which we spent at Marina Bay. There are a lot of things people can do around the complex. We personally loved the sky bar. Had some sangria there (not recommendable at all!) enjoying the view and later at night we went there again for a party. The place looked completely different full of nicely dressed people and good music. However the prices are very high (Heiniken 15 US dollars, long drink 22-23 dollars). What impressed me the most is the infinity pool...oh wow! Be aware you have to pay if you want to go upstairs for pictures and a walk around. If you say you go to the bar then you go for free but then you are really in the bar area but the view is the same ;-)"
,,Over priced but an amazing view,4.0,,"Worth going to however I feel its over priced at $20 pp.
The view form the top is incrediable and the lift up is an experience in itself - your ears pop and everything. But be careful of the green screen shot they do at the bottom they will want you to buy it on top. They charge 30 but quickly will sell for 20 if you wont by at 30. Personally I feel for the price of the ticket they should give you the photo and then it would be value for money."
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,"Went up top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel to enjoy the views at sunset. Well worth the $20 cost. Disappointing was the fact that we could not enter the bar area without long trousers on the males.
Would have liked to have been able to see the pool area but not accessible.
Great to go up before sunset and stay up there till dark."
,,Top Notch!,5.0,,Not for Vertigo sufferers but those of you who have a head for heights receive the benefit of great views over Singapore. For those staying at the Sands Hotel you can enjoy the infinity pool at the top of the hotel
,,Great Value for the View,5.0,,"Visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark observation deck. Only $ 20, an elevator up to the 56 floor and what a view from the observation deck. You could also have lunch at the bar if you wish. But you only have access to that area. Definitely work a look at the Marina Bay Sands Skypark"
,,EXpensive and not worth it,1.0,,"We went through the restaurant route to see the skyline so it was free, otherwise it is absolutely not suggested to spend 20$ on this .

Dont go in daytime, the view is good at night only

The staff in the hotel anywhere is pretty rude"
,,Wonderful views !,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands skypark offers wonderful views of Singapore especially if you visit on a clear sunny day. It is even better in the evenings. Now accesssible to everyone for a fee - might be closed in case of heavy rain and thunderstorms.
A must see in Singapore."
,,Well worth seeing,4.0,,"I had originally left after enquiring about the entrance fee and thought that it was a little bit pricey. But after leaving and knowing that I likely wouldn't be back in Singapore any time soon, I went back and purchased my ticket. I was glad that I did. The views were incredible and although you couldn't get too close to the pools and go the length of the building, it was impressive nonetheless. I did however feel that after about the first 10 or 15 minutes I was ready to leave."
,,Amazing complex,5.0,,"The main attraction here is the Marina Bay Sands Casino and Hotel Complex. The whole area is reclaimed land and has been beautifully set out. There are little structures surrounding the main casino and hotel complex with a botanical garden. Unfortunately this was not ready when we were there.

The observation deck right at the top of the hotel is very impressive. The swimming pool complex has one of the best views of Singapore. It truly is quite amazing with its infinity pool on top of the three towers linked by a structure which resembles a ginormous surf board.

The ticket for the observation deck costs S$40 and you can stay up there for as long as you like until the next paid event in the evening - fireworks at that time.

There are several restaurants here headed by top international chefs. Cheaper fayre can be found in the food court which is reasonably priced and very good. A great variety of food in a lovely food court.

The whole complex is very swanky, top designer shops, highly polished marble everywhere and teams of cleaners sweeping, mopping and polishing!

Entry to the casino is free for tourists and non citizens. You must show your passport for free entry. Singaporeans have to pay S$100 entry fee - to discourage locals from gambling.

There is a stand alone Louis Vuitton shop in the grounds. Impressive building.

Marina Bay Sands is worth a visit. I'll be there again next month. Looking forward to it."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"Simply stunning views of the surrounds. Even better at night when everything is lit up. If you want one vantage point from where to see the whole of Singapore, this is the place to go. Yes, there is a fee if you're not a hotel guest, but I consider the views to be worth spending the fee."
,,Magnificent views,5.0,,"The views from the rooftop is simply stunning. High prices, definitely, but if you look at the views from the top, you easily forget that. A feat of engineering? Most definitely.
A place from where to survey the surrounding areas. Good view of the Gardens, excellent views of the surrounding skyline.
I was lucky enough to be invited along by one of the guests. If I could afford it, I would definitely stay here."
,,Part of the hotel visit - incredible!,5.0,,We visited on a fairly sunny day - between showers - and had a fantastic view over the city. There was plenty of room to have a good look even though there were lots of people up there.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"Loved everything about it!Loved the Jacuzzi, the pool the food everything there :)Our kids enjoyed it totally...spent almost the whole day up at the Skypark on one of the days our 3 nights stay there!The pool is emptier in the mornings so if you wish to grab a nice seating area then get up there early :)"
,,Use your AMEX card for 25% off entry prices,4.0,,"Journeyed up the 56 floors to the sky park and caught the views across the city and the new botannic gardens to the south of the Marina bay Sands complex.

We watched the rain come in across the city which was actualy quite spectacular.

NOTE: to save a few dollars on the admission price - pay using your AMEX card. We got 25% off. Normal admission prices are $20.00 adults & $14.00 children."
,,What a place!,5.0,,"Actually we went there a long time before March 2012 but it does not allow you to say. The virtual pool is magical, the view both from the top of the Skypark AND from the ground looking up, are great! It is one of the landmarks in Singapore! Expensive just to go up in the lift to view and if you want a drink at the bar at the top, it is very expensive, but worth one drink! A word of warning, IF you have a fear of heights, you either don't go up there, or you don't look down! We did see one poor person clinging on to the side of the building as she walked..."
,,Great City View,4.0,,"We were there in the evening & the city lights were stunning. It was raining & windy, though, but it didn't stop us from enjoying the view."
,,Awesome,5.0,,This Hotel is a Singapore landmark. The views from the top are stunning. It costs $20 Singapore but I feel it is worh every cent. It's a must do while in Singapore.
,,Nice view from the skypark,4.0,,Good place to chill with nice view on Singapore. There are some nice cafes and restaurant on the skypark. The area was open aired.
,,Aerial View of Singapore,5.0,,"Breathtaking views from the tallest hotel roof in Singapore - don't forget to take your camera.
There is a tour that allows you to go into the hotel only gardens and pool area but sadly the timing was not convenient for us. Zoom lense onto the infinity pool with drop shows how extraordinary the whole design is.
Delicious fresh fruit juice (or beer!) at the top. Worth a visit."
,,Ohh la laa,5.0,,"what else to say, this is the best ever experience in Singapore...the view from the pool is amazing and experience the majestic feeling...Evenings are very nice as you can see the city lights up while enjoying the amazing pool. By all means this is an exotic experience."
,,Inaccessible for seniors/ people with disability,3.0,,"Visitors who cannot go on escalators cannot enter the skypark as per normal visitor-we had to go through a different lift, etc. Its weird how when we reached the skypark level there is a disability access when you dont have one at the skypark underground entrance level. LOGICALLY< there should built a LIFT to the underground entrance! If you do not ask, you wont know if you can actually enter the skypark. Once we are at the viewing deck, there are no seats or benches available .. my group of people with disabilities required a sit down, we ended up sitting on the steps. It was very sad for them as they were also hungry and were trying to eat hotdogs at the same time. The seller also tried to trick us the price of the hotdogs and when we looked at the receipt and complaint, she finally apologised and gave back the correct amount of change. I think MBS have to reconfigure its seatings, selling of food and having an honest staff person. People dont normally stand around to eat hotdogs. Please provide some cafe chairs of some sort. You have to be kind to your visitors who are senior or have disabilities. Also, the parking to go to the skypark is ridiculous. You enter right next to the skypark but you have to walked all around the shopping centre in a big loop before going via the hotel lobby. It took me 30 mins after parking to get to the skypark. Thank God for SELVEN the security guard who helped us navigate and got us to the skypark. MBS have to reconfigure their accessibility for people who are on wheelchairs and unable to walk far. MBS as a big name company, also need to TRAIN people in assisting people with disability. Its a shame you dont have such programs in place for such a big reputable organisation."

,,Great view,4.0,,"This place offer a great view of Spore. A perfect place for photographer. But i don't understand about the ""no-tripod"" rules, and even more surprised that after leaving my tripod down, a lot of people are using tripods. Why the rule if it is not enforced? And why have the stupid rule in the first place?"
,,Good Observation Deck,5.0,,"The Skypark is special as we were staying at the Marina Sands. The infinity pool is well designed and enjoyable. Most people were simply wading in the water for pictures and then scampering for their robes as it was January when we were there and temperatures were cool.
The hotel was charging non staying guests $10 to visit the Skypark. I thought this too much. But considering the facility and the fact they charge Singapore residents $100 to enter the casino, this is Singapore and there's nothing inexpensive."
,,Amazing view from Top,4.0,,"Went on top to the observation deck, paid 20S$ for it, it was worth a trip to go on top, view from the top is amazing, you can see both sea and city. It is just another way of looking at this incredible city."
,,Worth to see but a little wasteful cost,3.0,,"The view over SkyPark is interesting. Visions to most of Marina Bay landscapes are covered here. But if you're unlucky, SkyPark may be closed or opened only in certain hours, especially when there is an F1 season (they opened only until 3pm). Too many people then, cannot really enjoy, but overall this place delivered a memorable experience."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"We went to the Marina Bay Skypark during the day and night. Both experiences were good. The views across Singapore are seemingly endless. At night we hoped to have a cocktail whilst gazing out on Singapore. This particular night it was not busy - perhaps we arrived early. When I inquired as to a seat within the parameters of the bar I was told it would cost our party 2 drinks each or a bottle of champayne. Ok, not a problem until you find out how much that will be. $3500 for the Champayne. It was enough to keep standing near the rail and have our expensive cocktails. When we went during the day we could sit at the same area for nothing and the drinks in comparison to the night before - reasonable."
,,Wow just breathtaking,5.0,,Having seen many images of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Skypark on tv and in photographs I didnt really expect to be overwhelmed by this structure but the reality totally took my breath away. Our first view of it was from our hotel window lit up at night and we just stood and stared in amazement. The views when you are actually up on the Skypark are unbelievable. Try and get booked in for one of the tours of the infinity pool and gardens definately work a look. One word of warning though there is very little shade on the viewing deck so if you are booked on the tour don't go up too early or you will get very hot hanging around. There is no extra cost for the tour and they give you water and a wet towel at the start which is a nice touch.
,,A breathtaking sight over Singapore,5.0,,"The best is to get there before sunset.
The 360° view over the harbor and city when night comes and the city lights up is breathtaking.
Getting up to the 200 meters above ground rooftop sky terrace with the rocket-speed elevator is impressive and seamless.
Don’t leave without a visit to The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands with all its luxury stores, and the amazing Louis Vuitton “Island Maison”."
,,amazing,5.0,,"just well worth a visit, so much money spent on an awe inspiring sight. You just stand looking up wondering how on earth you could begin to think about designing such a structure."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Go to the roof top, even if you have to pay the $20SGD for the viewing deck, or go to KuDaTa restaurant and bar to get to see the amazing view of the whole of Singapore, plus see the infinity rooftop pool which is second to none! Shopping mall attached to the hotel is worth a look too for keen shoppers"
,,Niceee placeee,4.0,,Best time to visit this place is aftee 7 pm in the evening ... Nice crowd trickles in and the atmosphere is just electric to say the least ... enjoy a drink or meal in this vicinity
,,Fantastic view of Singapore--especially at night !,5.0,,"When at Singapore, do not fail to go to the rooftop (Skypark) at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Marina Bay. The three towers are brilliantly connected at the rooftop which boasts of a swimming pool about 100 metres long ! The view of the city from the Skypark is simply breathtaking ! And the place is open till midnight and more ! Of course, there is a bar and a restaurant at the rooftop---(with skyhigh prices to boot ! ) And the superfast elevator ( 57 floors in 25 seconds with ear-pressure being felt slightly( is an experience by itself !"
,,Very nice view of the City Area!,5.0,,"Besides the Skypark, hotel guests can also enjoy the Infinity Pool on top. What an amazing view! One of my memorable days in Singapore! There's a spa, a sauna and the amazing pool! 360 degree view of the City and the Harbour Area!"
,,Great view,5.0,,"I returned here to show my wife and kids. It is a must visit. But only go if you can see the pool. They offer at a price of, if I recall, $20SGD to to a tour. The tour is the normal visit to the viewing platform, which is on the left side of the top sky platform, plus a quick visit through to the pool. You cannot touch the pool but can get a good look of the view and the pool itself. I would still go if you cannot do the tour. However, there are only three tours throughout the day. The tickets are sold on the day only on a first come basis.
You should go at 9am and buy your ticket. Perhaps best to buy for the nighttime session, as the view at night is great."
,,Spectacular view,4.0,,A great place to view Singapore. The staff makes the experience noteworthy. Everyone was willing to take a picture of our group. $20 Singapore for a beer did not seem out of line in such a wonderful setting
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,"we love hights and we have seen tall buildings in KL,Bangkok. But this is the best! Loved the view.City View and the ocean view. Very lively place. Did not have the time to visit the rooftop bar but will be back soon!"
,,Views Galore,5.0,,What an exceptional spot....a must see for anyone in Singapore. The views are electric and sipping a cold beer looking at the Singapore skyline feels like you are on top of the world
,,Take the tour,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is certainly spectacular and can be seen from many angles around Singapore. We also went up to the observation deck which had a great view of the city, but did not include permission to walk around or even view most of the Skypark. Our recommendation is to pay the extra and take the tour which, as I understand it, will take you all the way around the Skypark."
,,Must see,5.0,,The Marina Bay Sands is a must see location of Singapore. It is also worth to participate in a guided tour so that the pool area can be visited too. Take your time to have a drink at the bar and enjoy the view especially during sunset.
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,"The skypark is a great place to visit. We spent hours there with the children and wanted to return, but we ran out of time. Next time we'll be back...."
,,wow. killer views,5.0,,"we went to Ku De Ta restaurant and the nightclub next door, but sat outside. The skypark obervation area has the best views (so does the hotel pool), but if you're going to drink or eat, save your money and just go to the lounge, bar, or restaurant."
,,Excellent place at sky park and infinity pool,5.0,,"The infinity pool is great place ...how we wish we can also swim on that infinity pool , but we are given a chance to go near the infinity pool ..."
,,Cannot beat the view,5.0,,"Its breath taking view… Especially at night and very early in the morning. Just cautious that it can be very crowded, especially during weekend"
,,Nice to do it once,3.0,,Something to do and see while you are in Singapore. But the garden is beautiful and a must to see! I enjoyed the garden in door and out door. Many varieties of plants and flowers to look at.
,,Best Place,4.0,,"The View from the Deck is the best & gives a complete panoramic view of the entire city, viz, the flyer, the city skyline, the merlion, the dockyards & also the malaysian Border."
,,Not worthwhile,3.0,,"If you stay at Bay Sands Hotel, well, the admission could be complimentary (dunno). If not, you have to pay to get up and only have access to a limited viewing area! Not worth it! Go to Singapore Flyer!"
,,Awesome view,5.0,,The view all around is way better that the singapore flyer but it can get pretty hot in the afternoon. We had great time taking pictures from different angles and view of the city and the bay.
,,nice view,5.0,,really nice atmosphere! very fancy and hip.. good for hanging out with friends at night or family during the day. Was there with friends and work colleagues (and boss) and had a nice day (and night) out!
,,Amazing views of Singapore,5.0,,"Just to support previous reviews of this attraction...

The Sands skylark is a phenomenal way to see the Singapore skyline! I feel it is best visited at dusk/night, it provides a 360 degree view of Singapore, the Straits of Singapore and all points beyond!

The architecture is mind boggling, and the tour guide is very personable. Allow time to take in the grandeur of this incredible city. Make sure the camera has a fresh battery and you will be delighted that you took the time to visit the Sands!

Dont forget to look on the water side of the Sands to see the busiest waterway on earth. At night, the Straights almost look like a city with all the shipping traffic.

Simply the best way to see all of Singapore in one location!

Also, there is a nightly light show at the foot of the Sands, not to be missed! Best seating is on the waterfront. The water, Light and Laser effects are incredible."
,,"great views, good bar",5.0,,Must place to visit. Best views and great bars on rooftop. Worth paying for expensive drinks have the view. Take camera
,,lovely view ever,5.0,,I was excited to visit this skypark. And once I reach then from 56 level then I look down and wow you wont believe that the view is fantastic. To go for the swimming pool then you must book the room in this hotel in order to enjoy the swimming pool but because I didnt know about this then I could only took pictures. But i love the swimming pool and great view ever.
,,A Must While in Singapore,5.0,,This is a lot of fun. If you are afraid of heights you probably should avoid. The views are magnificent. Next time I would plan ahead and get on one of the tours.
,,An Ark on the Sky,5.0,,"Getting There: Buses 133 from Bugis and 106 from Dhoby Ghaut, 97 feeder bus via suntec city. Bayfront MRT from Promenade or Marina Bay Mrt. If you are taking the bus, moment you get down at the busstop, turn left and walk towards the SKY PARK counter, located near tower 3 entrance of Marina Bay Sands. GO down to basement 2 and et your tickets. If you are coming through MRT entrance, upon exiting out, walk straight towards the Leica camera shop, further down, take the first Right and take escalator to B1 and again to Level 1 lobby of the hotel. Turn left and exit out through tower 3, to the sky park counter.
Price: 20$ for adults, and avail children.
Skypark: The lift to level 56 was under 30 seconds without any jolt and as smooth as butter. Your ears are blocked as we crossed level 30 to level 56. Exit out to the wooden deck, its a wonder to see the entire 360 degree view of singapore. The deep blue seas, the urban civilization of high rises, the water front promenade of marina bay, astounding engineering designs of the Arts and science museums, Crystal pavillions and the entire event plaza areas were indeed mesmerizing for the first time. Around 8 pm, when the laser show starts, the laser lights from the hotels, on top of MICE and casinos, to the event plaza areas, captivates us for next 10 minutes. Its a true wonder to sight and sound. Move up a level, you will come across Kudeta, a night club and restaurant. Prices are resonable if you want to have a drink, while food menus are a bit high. Move towards the INFINITY POOL, the swimming pool that feels like, it has no walls and gives you the thrill of swimming on the sky with a foot to earth below. With palm trees and wooden deck chairs and lounge, its a real picturesque setting for a beach in the sky. We were not able to go any further, as you require a room card, if you are guest and produce it to the security officer on guard there.
Enginnering Facts: The Wooden deck can stand upto 600 people at one time with a length of 60 meters. Its supported by cantilevers from the main frame of the hotel towers. On par with todays engineering standards, its a architectural wonder and rated as the highest freefall structure in the world.
Best Time to see: Evening from 5 pm, so you dont miss the laser show at 8 pm.
Pros: Great and stunning views of singapore skyline, like you have never seen before
Cons: Not for a second time
Verdict: A must to visit this Ark on the Sky, least once in your life time. Experience is truly amazing."
,,A must do when in Singapore,4.0,,"This is probably the one must do thing you should do experience when you are in Singapore. Much better than the Singapore Flyer! Costs S$20 per adult. An elevator quickly whisks you to the 56th floor of Tower 3. From the observation deck you have dramatic views of Singapore city, the harbour and most of the island.

Easy to get too; just take the MRT to Bayfront and exit at street level by Tower 1, walk to Tower 3 and take escalator downstairs to the ticket booth."
,,Great views of the city and harbour,5.0,,"Although a little expensive for only being able to see a quarter of the upper deck of 'boat', the views and general facility is worth the effort. Unfortunately, on arrival at the book-in facility, which can be hard to find, we were informed that we would only be able to see a small part of the upper deck as most the platform is reserved for the hotel guests. There is a free quick tour of the other areas available, but each tour party is limited in number and at set times in the day. Needless to say that when we arrived at the facility, the only tour remaining for that day was already fully booked.
As this building can be seen from almost the whole of Singapore it would be a shame to miss out on the views from the top - don't miss it."
,,Awesome ! Must do !,5.0,,"I had a tour on the skypark and also at the bar.
If you go to Singapore this is really a must do.
20$ to enjoy the view and get some (ok quite expensive) drinks at the bar, but you will not regret it ! absolutely magnific !"
,,At the top of Singapore,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark dominates the skyline across the bay. The viewing platform at the top is a very big wooden deck / style platform with wide views across the city of Singapore. We visited this during the middle of the day, (very bright and the glare was quite strong, so be sure to take sunglasses), which was fabulous to see as the day was reasonably clear, however I can imagine the view would also be good to see early morning or night time. This platform is much higher than the Singapore Flyer (giant ferris wheel which you can look down on from the platform) so views much vaster from Skypark."
,,Overhyped,3.0,,"With a $20 ticket , the place is overhyped.Avoid it.and even after paying $20 you are not allowed on to the infinity swimming pool.What a waste!!"
,,Spectacular view over Singapore,4.0,,"for all visitors of Singapore: This place belongs to the top 10 locations and offers a spectacular view over the bay, downtown, the Fullerton Hotel, the Gardens by the Bay and if not hazy, to Bintan, one of the Indonesian Island. The drinks at the bar are extremely expensive"
,,Great Views of course,5.0,,This is a lovely place. One has to pay an entry fee to go up to the Sky garden..we had dinner at one of the restaurants so we did not have to pay the fee. It is a beautiful place to relax and enjoy dinner ..pricey but for a special occasion..its great.
,,Best part of Hotel,5.0,,We booked a Club room with unlimited access to Sky Park. Club members have access to great breakfast afternnoon tea as well as drinks and nibbles 5-7pm. Staff were first rate and after two days rembered our names Unusual in such a large Hotel
,,"Interesting, but you need to know what to expect",4.0,,"I did some research in advance, so I was prepared, but I saw many people disappointed. People expect they can tour the roof with the pool, but Skywalk park ticket typically includes just visiting only part of the roof - which looks like a big flat deck. You still get the nice view, but I won't see the pool area. They can take you on a 30 min tour where you can see part of the pool, but still you won't be able to see everything, you'll be always supervised and you'll need to leave when they say so. They have only several tours per day and you have to indicate you want to be on a tour when you buy your skypark ticket. I can't remember if it costs more or not, probably not, and there is only one time for a tour at night - around 9:30 pm. Number of people is limited of course - only 50 people or so. I think to really experience Marina Bay Sands roof experience you have to stay at the hotel."
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,Great views over the bay and surrounding city. Would recommend going up as the sun sets as then you get to see the lights from the skyscrapers coming on across the cities. Amazing city views.
,,WOW,5.0,,Must visit place in Singapore to get a breathtaking view of the city as well as to admire human achievement in having the worlds largest cantilever undertaking. The cu-de-ta restaurant is also worth visiting.
,,Nice shopping centre,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, walk to the gardens by the bay and see the new three towers hotel all at the same time"
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"It's amazing view on Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay. Highest building, where you feel like on the deck of the boat. If you want to see swimming pool remember to be before 10, 14, and 15:00. I've made a lot of great pictures from that place."
,,Awesome place,5.0,,"The place is so awesome. Breath taking view from the top of MBS especially at night, the details and architecture, the concept of being in the sky watching down below...it's awesome!"
,,"Visit the infinity pool during tour times of 10am, 2pm and 9pm",5.0,,"At the marina bay Sands skypark, you will not be able to see the famous infinity pool, unless you join the guided tours at the 3 designated time slots.

There is no re-admission allowed for the skypark too.. so do plan your visit to coincide with the tour timings, so you do not leave disappointed.

Choose to visit the skypark in the early morning from 10am onwards, or during the early evening time - the deck can get pretty warm at other times of the day."
,,Great way to see more of Singapore,4.0,,"The Sands Skypark dominated the skyline from Clarke Quay as walked towards the Merlion and the bay. Not having an up to date guidebook, we just followed out eyes and instincts to find out more on our first day in Singapore.

Once we found our way to the top, then the views were stunning
Good value for money. As a previous resident and visitor, I was able to put a completely different perspective on Singapore's growth and change. ... and also how new waterfront developments are masking the older parts of Singapore :-(

Great cocktails in the bar at the summit.

The entrance / access is not well sign posted. If I recall, we had to ask in the end, as the ticket office is located outside the main hotel mall (western end, I think). We approached by foot, so may be better from the metro station itself."
,,Awesome,5.0,,You have to pay SDG 10/= to go up and get an awesome view. Go just beofre sunset and get a fantastic view. While walking thru the Marina Sands Hotel you feel real good and posh. Great place to send some time in the evening.
,,great views,5.0,,The whole experience is not to be missed. Incredible views of Singapore and the top of the MBS pool area is amazing
,,Only worth the bother for the view.,1.0,,We had mistakenly thought one could pay to access the pool area as a non- hotel guest but this wasn't correct. It is quite expensive (for a family) just to ride up in the lift to see the view from the top and that's about all you can do...mind you it is a fantastic view...so not sure why it should be called 'Skypark'. As a visitor once you've walked around the accessible area that's about it unless you want to eat up there...didn't check the menu but it wouldn't be cheap. It was raining when we went up and there was some fear about lightening (although there wasn't any) so the security became rather controlling and aggressive 'for your safety' and people weren't allowed out on the viewing decks. Given that there was no discernible lightening...it seemed more a question of them being concerned about their liability.
,,A Must See!,5.0,,"You MUST see and experience the Skypark! Bring your camera and expect to pay slightly higher food and beverage prices but the experience is worth it. I would NOT rush through any part of the Skypark, instead, have a drink and people watch!"
,,Best Evening in Singapore!,5.0,,We really enjoyed our visit to the Marina Bay Sands! The view from the top is breathtaking overlooking Singapore! We had dinner at the restaurant at the top (reservations needed) and it was great. Well worth the experience. If you have dinner or drinks there you don't have to pay an admission fee. The swimming pool is something to see!
,,What a Waste,1.0,,Stopped by in the evening. Completely over-packed with people. Too many people to enjoy any sort of view. Staff was rude and seemed more interrested in the special event that was going on than answering any questions. Bar tender was horrible.
,,unbelievable views,5.0,,The biggest and highes swimming pool in the world. It is really worthy to go and see this architecture masterpiece
,,worth seeing,4.0,,"really enjoyed our visit lift only takes seconds and you are at the top fantastic views over singapore there is a small bar on the observation deck and a shop selling t shirts etc, you are restricted to where you can go but you are told this before you purchase your ticket the whole experience was worthwhile and its easy to get to via the mrt marina bay stop"
,,Awesome View........,5.0,,"Make sure you go at night. Spectacular Lighting across Singapore including the new Gardens. Yep its high, but well worth it. A really cheap at only $20!!!"
,,Just a small observation deck,1.0,,"Taxi driver recommended me to visit Marina Bay Sands park and advised to bring a swimming suit to spend a couple of hours at their pool. But when I bought the ticket and got to the observation deck I found out that we can not even observe the pool , because it is for HOTEL GUESTS ONLY! So You can see the Singapore from rather small observation deck and THAT's IT!"
,,ok ok to go there,3.0,,Frankly shelling out 20$ for a trip to top is little on higher side considering you can always to other roof top resturants & have a drink with that money. Full skywalk is not open in that ticket & only one small part is open which further restrict your movements.
,,Spectacular View...,5.0,,"If you stay in Marina Bay Sands hotel, you will get free access to the Sands Sky Park, failing which you will be charged a fee to access the Sky Park.

However, if you have not gone up to the Sky Park before, at least do so once as the view up there is simply beautiful. You get almost 360 degrees view up there, from the Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer, Marina Barrage, Esplanade, city view and many others.

Up at the Sky Park, you get some simply amazing picturesque views. If you are there on the right day at the right time, you may even get to view some amazing sunsets! :)

There are some food and beverage outlets up at the Sky Park as well though some are only for guests of the hotel.

The infinity pool is one of the most talked about pool. It looks as if you will drop off at the edge of the pool but this isn't so.

We were fortunate to be able to 'catch' the shadow of Marina Bay Sands Hotel onto the Gardens by the Bay."
,,Great view,3.0,,"Taxi driver told us that Skypark is better than Singapore Flyer, so we managed to visit it. We first thought it was free but actually it didn't. There were good views of Singapore city and Marina Bay. If you are into photography, this is a must visit place for you."
,,"Nice view, windy. Not that much to do though.",4.0,,"Exclusive... unless you fork over money and pay to get in. They were really checking our wristbands closely to ensure that folks didn't just wander up there without paying.

The view is spectacular from the top, and it was very windy. I was wondering if I would have some Marilyn Monroe moments with my short dress, but all was secure. ;)

There is a gigantic glass surrounding the viewing area for safety reasons, but it kind of hampered any photo-taking. I don't think the view looks so nice with a giant plexi-glass in front!

There isn't so much to do up here, so after a quick peruse, we were ready to go down again."
,,Great views - do the tour!,4.0,,"I was pleasently suprised at how much i enjoed this - the views are amazing. we booked onto a tour which are no additional cost but only 3 per day but it was worth it to see the famous infinity pool. Theres nothing to do here but take pictures of the view - worth taking some binoculars and spotting raffles, your hotel etc. its quiet expensive for what you get and hte lift gives you a head rush like taknig off in a plane but the views are outstanding, higher than everything around (including the flyer) and you can stay as long as you like. closed in the rain."
,,WOW Singapore,4.0,,"The view from the top here is amazing. This is higher than the Singapore Flyer, cheaper & you can stay up on the viewing deck as long as you like. There is a Bar where you can have a beer or a meal or what ever you want, (however they are priced accordingly)"
,,Excellent view of Singapore,4.0,,"Excellent view. Amazing building. Went to the bar itself and had a drink. 1 cocktail, 1 beer and 1 soft drink equalled $45 AUD."
,,Gardens,5.0,,"Nice change from the hustle and bustle of the city, Enjoyable Park walk, weel worth a visit and its free"
,,One of The City's Highlight,4.0,,"As a guest of the Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights, we had unlimited free access to the Skypark. The view is nothing but spectacular! The best time to go up is either early in the morning or late at night as the rest of time may be very crowded with all the tourist. Personally, I think the view is better than that of the Singapore Flyer with no time limitation."
,,Spectacular views!,4.0,,"Outstanding views. The tour was not really informative though we appreciated being able to see the famous infinity pool, it seemed like we were gawking at the ""wealthy"" aka guests using the pool."
,,A Great Experience!,4.0,,"The hotel itself is an amazing design and dominates the Singapore skyline at the marina. It costs $20.00 to take the lift up to the 56th floor, giving access to the Skypark deck (but not the infinity pool which is exclusive to hotel guests) which offers an unrivalled view over Singapore. You are not rushed, and so have plenty of time to take in the views."
,,Nice place,4.0,,A nice walk to do.I really enjoyed this place.If you wish to withdraw from the city and relax a little I suggest you to do this walk.
,,Overpriced beer with a view,3.0,,"As far as city observatories go, it's a pretty good one because it is open air but it is a bit spoiled by being corralled into a very small area and excluded from seeing the rest of the hotel. We went up and had a drink at the bar (which makes for free entry but be prepared to spend $20 minimum on a drink). The views were nice, but the staff were fairly bossy and abrupt. I suppose it is a bit inevitable when you deal with so may visitors every day, but they shuffle you along and generally rush you through the experience. We had barely taken a sip of our drinks before they presented us with the bill. Overall worth doing though if you like a nice high view of the city."
,,Great views,3.0,,"The view from the top of this iconic building is amazing but on a particularly hot day there isnt a spot of shade to be found. though the view is great there is just open decking, a souvenir shop and a bar. was a bit bored after a few minutes."
,,What a view!!,4.0,,"Went up to Ku De Ta on the 57th floor for a Singapore Sling and the most breathtaking views anywhere in the world from a bar!!
Yes it was around £12 a drink, but it was just worth every penny to sit there and look at the views all around, and casual dress if you visit during the day before 1800."
,,No further comments... Just do it!!,5.0,,No further comment. Spend the money for the elevator. Its something you don't find in any other city...
,,Amazing amazing!,5.0,,the views are amazing! was there during the Singapore national day rehearsal and got to see the city view like no other. Fireworks rehearsal was a bonus!
,,Great view but pricey,3.0,,"Great experience but costly drinks, however costs $20 for just the viewing so might as well have a drink for a few dollars more"
,,It's my second time to tour in Singapore .,5.0,,A nice place to visit.The Skypark. I am coming back this Chinese New Year 2013. I want to visit again Skypark but this time I like night time.
,,Birds eye view,5.0,,This is an amazing attraction that puts you up with the birds to give you an awesome view of some iconic Singapore attractions. There was a lovely welcoming breeze when we got up there which is such a relief from the humid conditions.
,,Not As Good As Expected,3.0,,"With so little available to general public admission, unless you book a tour, the observation deck is the limit of your access, you have to take a tour to see anything of the Sky Park.

There are good views of Marina Bay and the City but the views from the Singapore Flyer are as good and you have the comfort of an air conditioned pod and the ability to see the views from different perspectives as the wheel rotates."
,,Great view of Marina Bay and the city...,5.0,,"I thought it's free but it's not. =)

For me, it's the best place to see the Marina Bay and nearby places. I should tell you to go there before sun set to check the view while there's still bright light and wait till evening to see the wonderful lights of the city.

Closed when raining, so check the weather first before coming. The floor is somehow slippery also after raining so watch your steps or hold onto something."
,,The future now,5.0,,This place is amazing. Step into the future of gardens and see the most fascinating botanical structures. Don't miss the sky walk
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Love the experience being on the top and viewing the city of Singapore.. we follow the tour package which makes it easy to go up.. The Garden by the bay nearby also has great sceneries especially the lights..
,,Spectacular but busy,5.0,,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and visited the Skypark at night and in the morning. We swam in the busy pool and enjoyed the view.
,,One of the best observatories,5.0,,"I always visit an observatory whenever there's one. Marina Sands was one of the best ones I've been to. What makes it to special is its maginificent architecture which you can appreciate from a distance as well as on the deck. I like the fact that the observatory is outside and there's little obstruction to appreciate the view. The breeze feels great.

If you tell them you are going to the bar, you don't have to pay the admissions, but the cocktails tasted pretty bad to our surprise. On average they cost $20-25. You would be much better off with a beer."
,,"Great view, but it'll cost ya!",4.0,,"Had a great experience here, but a round of beers for 5 people cost about $100. Go for a drink, take a picture, and move on. :)"
,,great venue,4.0,,excellent location and buzzing! It was Christmas and never been in Singapore at that time of year before- surprised how many people were passing through and deliberately wanted to experience Singapore at Christmas time- can't blame them it was great!i
,,Beautiful,5.0,,this is the best part in the hotel. We could have stayed here the entire evening but we had other plans. We really wanted to go the club but we have seen enough clubs back home and around the world. Will return just for Ku De Ta
,,Best scenery,4.0,,Was surprised that it just took me 28 seconds to take me up to d 56th floor.. what amazed me is d scenery in d evening when its sunset n d lights at d streets n buildings light up decorating d whole scene.. d entire of singapore can be seen and also parts of indonesia as well.. my advice d best time to get up there is during dusk and get the swimming pool/gardens tour as for visitors we can only be at observation deck.
,,Awesome view over the city!,5.0,,"Not really cheap but definitely worth it - enjoyed a lot the fantastic view over the skyscrapers, the harbour, marina bay and the sea. It was actually not so crowded as I assumed it would be. Great place for taking nice pictures."
,,Dont do in wet season and limited access,3.0,,"This is an amazing architectural feet, unlike anything we have ever seen, well worth visiting, however you are extremely limited to access only being the deck, probably better to have lunch or dinner at the restaurant on the deck level. It started to rain whilst we were there so best not to even try if you feel it may rain!!!"
,,What a sight,5.0,,57 floors up in the Marina Bay Sands will get you to the top of this impressive hotel structure that overlooks the harbour and the city central district. A must do.
,,Good for Impressing your Guests,4.0,,"The best time to visit the highest spot of Singapore is around 5:30pm to experience the transition from day to night and to get the best pictures. Just walk and enjoy.

The Ku De Ta Restaurant is not really worth it. The Bar on the deck is fun, but expensive for drinks.

The best way to visit is to ask at the reception on the ground floor to visit the Lounge Club Bar on the deck. Entrance is free, but you got to buy some drinks or food. After your visit to the Club Bar you can visit the Skypark too without a ticket or standing in the cue at the ticket office.

A place to impress your guest, whether business or family or friends. One can enjoy the drinks, well-served, and the conversations. Being high up there brings people in a positive mood. Thanks Singapore!"
,,Why all the Hype?,3.0,,"When in Singapore, you need to do what all the local expats tell you to do. And that's why I went to Marina Bay Sands Skypark, Had some drinks with friends up there. Unquestionably, the view is breathtaking (on a fine day, which was the case when I went).

Having said that, what's the idea? Just take an artificial garden, plant a few skinny palm trees, fill a big (far too big) swimming pool, and instead of doing the sensible thing and keeping them where they should be (i.e. at ground level) pack the whole lot together and raise it 57 floors at a staggering construction cost, with high-speed elevators, millions of tons of concrete, environmentally unfriendly air conditioning and all the usual stuff that goes with high-rise buildings. I'm sure the hotel is a civil engineer's marvel, but frankly, I'm getting a bit blasé with this sort of slightly decadent architecture.

The hotel lobby is very reminiscent of other over-hyped places such as the Atlantis at Dubai Palm. Too many rooms in the hotel means that there are tons of people milling about the reception and concierge areas. And clearly, to fill 2,400 rooms means that you need to tap the group and mass tourist market. We know what that means in terms of atmosphere.

This sort of pretentious construction could still pull it off in the last century. Frankly speaking, in this XXIst century, I'm sure that better concepts, more respectful of the environment, will find the hearts of modern-day travellers."
,,Best view of Singapore,5.0,,Great views of Singapore. Great place to watch the sunset over Singapore with a drink at the bar. I think it is well priced for the view. I found it was great to go up just before sunset and watch the lights of Singapore fire up.
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"Brilliant. Awesome. Have the lunch at Coup de Ta. The Tuna is the best I've ever had by far. 180 degree views overlooking the harbour, city and Singapore Flyer. The Marina Sands infinity pool is up here and one of the best pools I've seen."
,,excellent views of Singapore,5.0,,what a stunning place to visit. excellent..well organised and classy. even the 50 dollar coffee at the top is worth it lol ;) a must see in Singapore..i would say much better vantage point than the Singapore eye
,,Amazing views a must see!,5.0,,I am a regular visitor to singapore as my family are based there. Singapore is not renowned for great tourist attractions.However this is well worth the visit amazing views I loved it. We got free entrance into the infinity pool so we could take pictures. A bit uncomfortable as you felt like you were imposing. None the less it was worth it!
,,WOW,5.0,,"I was not staying here so paid 20 singapore dollars to go up to the top. It was worth every penny.
What can i say i spent over 2 hours on top of here and watched it go from day to night, it was absolutely breathtaking. You can see so much from up here.
This is a must for anyone coming to Singapore. The building itself is amazing against the Singapore skyline."
,,Incredible views,4.0,,"This is sort of one of those things you have to do in Singapore simply because the building is so extreme and impressive. I met some colleagues in the bar on my final night in the city and walked to Marina Sands, across the bridge (definitely more of an experience than taking a taxi to the door) and then took the lift up to Skypark's KU DÉ TA bar. The drinks here are expensive (the only downside) but the view is fantastic. You can take in the entire city vista which you can't help but be amazed by. When I visited the sun was just setting and we hung around until it was dark so we could watch the laser show in the bay below. Definitely an experience."
,,Could not get up the top,2.0,,"Spent time in the Sands shopping area and food centre this was fantastic but sadly by the time we found the entrance to get up the to the Skypark it was about to rain and they wouldnt let us up even though it was not late, will save this for our next trip to Singapore"
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"This is the best place to get a bird's eye view of Singapore. The place is generally full of tourists. You can go there and have a drink at Ku De Ta.
Preferably go just before sunset to experience the Sun and followed by the glowing lights.
The downtown area all lit up looks great. I love seeing the Nicoll Highway looking like a Hot wheels track.
Also notice the Helium bridge below.
Its a lovely photo stop to capture Singapore!"
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,"A place where you can rest in peace. Its our first time to visit other countries and will definitely visit more especially now that we experienced such a wonderful and glamorous place.

When we went to this place we want to take more pictures anywhere coz we didnt expect that it is more beautiful seeing it personally rather that in pictures, though it requires more walk but its really worth it. You must try also their dirty ice cream for only SGD1.20. How I wish i could here the soonest."
,,ok,3.0,,the guided tours are few and far between and are restricted inb no to see the infinity so everyone does not get the full money worth
,,Has to be a World Icon,5.0,,Spend the money and make the visit. We stayed at the Towers so were had all access. You should review where and what you can do as an outside visitor - but do it!!!
,,Romance in the sky,4.0,,Definitely not for those with acute acrophobia. The view from here is simply breath-taking. Increased adreline from the height makes the experience more unforgettable.
,,Breathtaking view !,5.0,,"The Skypark is located on the 56th floor of the Tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands. There is a fee of SGD20 per pax per entry for adults, SGD14 for children and SGD17 for Senior citizen aged beyond 65 years old.

Just take the MRT from wherever you are to Marina station. The Red and Circle Line stop at Marina but you may need to change Line if you are on the Green or Purple Line. Else, just hop on a taxi and stop right in front of the entrance to the Skypark.

The view is simply excellent. However, visitors are not allowed to visit the swimming pool as it is reserved for hotel residence only.

There is a merchandise and snack bar at the observation deck. There is also a pub.

Overall Experience - Very satisfying !"
,,Really not that impressive...,2.0,,"Just another average city.. Didnt find make me say wow, just another view of the shops.. most interesting to me was the view of the uncountable amount of vessels laid up out on the water..."
,,well worth a look,4.0,,When in Singapore don't miss Skypark. you really do have to see it for your self. Excellent. The view is amazing.
,,infinity......and beyond,5.0,,we stayed at the hotel so were granted free access to the pool. But it is worth tourists staying elsewhere the fee to come on up and get some great photo opportunities.
,,Worth for the view,4.0,,"There's a reason why it's Singapore's newest attraction. It's impressive view of the entire city makes it a must visit even if it's for a while. Go at the evening time and if possible, eat at the restaurant to get a discount on the entrance."
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"Charge to go to the top of this impressive building, bit worth it on a clear day. Only residents are allowed to use restaurant/bar at the top."
,,Amazing View!,5.0,,Lucky enough to be here during the Grand Prix and you can see the entire track set up. There is a fantastic light/laser show every night. The garden behind this hotel is also amazing at night very relaxing :)
,,Surreal !,5.0,,Without actually going to the roof (you had to be a hotel guest) - the hotel and complex surrounds are worth the visit anyway. It is a visually and spatially stunning place to visit. Recommended.
,,Wow,5.0,,The infinity pool is picture worthy and everyone does take a picture or 12. The view is spectacular. Looks like people were having fun at the disco!
,,What a view,5.0,,"We visited the Sky Park to stop in for a drink at Ku De TA, what a stunning experience it was. 57 stories up in the clouds we watched a tropical storm slowly descend over the city. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Beautiful,4.0,,Great views of Singapore all around. The food court had a huge variety of yummy food at reasonable prices. The atmosphere was spectacular and the convince to get there makes it easy.
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands SkyPark is a uniquely designed architecture, the most dramatic landmark in Singapore where there is a boat or surfboard alike pool on the top of the 55 stores building. it offers a panoramic view of the spectacular sights of Singapore there. the lighting in & around the area is amazing. the entire area comes to life in the evenings & night.
Casino is the largest casino in Singapore & is open round the clock.The entrance fee is free for visitors but S$100 for locals and residents.it is much more than just hotels and casino. In fact, it has everything to become Southeast Asia’s next top entertainment destination."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"Great Views, limited access to skypark but great spot for a drink and the views of Singapore are Spectacular."
,,Definitely worth a visit,4.0,,Its a bit of a squeeze at the bar (unless you want to pay $$$ to sit in the VIP area) but its worth it just for the view.!
,,Great views,4.0,,Great views for a price less than in Singapore Flyer! It's a pity only the hotel guests can go to the pool area.
,,Spectacular building,4.0,,The building is spectacular. But you can only see a small part of the top floor. And then only via the bar. A commercial trap
,,Better views elsewhere,3.0,,Novelty factor is good but value for money it is not. One Altitude for $20 with a free drink is better and can see more as is LeVel 33 for a beer and a sit down.
,,Beautiful but pricey,3.0,,"We went there at night and the sights were beautiful. You can see most of the iconic places in Singapore. But for an attraction that is basically just sight-seeing, I think it's overpriced so I won't be going here again. Once was enough."
,,$20 bucks a beer worth it for the view,4.0,,"Think of it as an admission fee with a free beer !, and relax
Throw a laser show in - a couple a night at the moment
Check out the rich people in the hotel horizon pool beside you
The city has lots to observe, and admire - the reverse bungy at clarke quay looked very small from up there"
,,A bit dissapointed,3.0,,"When I get to the highest point of the Marina Bay Sands, the hippest building until today in Singapore, I get excited. I pay S$20 to get upstairs, then take an elevator to level 57, getting out of the elevator still excited but when on the observation deck, nothing much to see except just a view and a souvenir shop. A binocular and a decent place to seat would be better i think."
,,Open Air,4.0,,Liked the view and swimimng but not enough staff to help us order for drinks and shortage of towels provided for guest. The seats are not enough too
,,Theme Park Madness,2.0,,"We had ""club"" privileges for breakfast and had to join lines just to get a table every day. Thought we were staying in a luxury hotel - not a wild water theme park with literally hundreds of people running around."
,,Breathtaking View,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands SkyPark has become one of the iconic symbol of Singapore. Shaped like a ship across three towers. I went there a couple of times, with the roof top swimming pool (accessible only for hotel guest), but you can almost go from one end of the 'ship' to the other. The downside is that if you're not a guest of the hotel; it will cost you SGD$25. But if you happens to be visiting Singapore, and NOT staying in Marina Bay Sands, you can visit the Skypark. Be Warned: do not visit at 2 PM on a sunny day. It is scorching hot."
,,Great Views But Expensive,3.0,,"Once you get over the novelty of being suspended 57 floors up, you realize how expensive the whole experience is. At $20 its not the best value for money. If you went on the Singapore Flyer or up the Tiger Tower on Sentosa the views are not that much different. The area open to the public is not large and believe me it does get VERY hot up there around midday. It's a real tourist thing so at least you can say you went up there. But once is enough."
,,Marina Bay SkyPark - A Great Pool Day,4.0,,"My husband, sister and I had a great time at the Sky Park. We visited the pool twice: once in the morning and again at night. The vibe was great, there were lots of loungers in both shaded and sunny areas, and the view was unbeatable. During the day, the pool was dominated by families, in the evening it had more of a party vibe. We ate and had some drinks during the day. The service was very friendly and efficient, and the food was good. It was served on trays so that you can eat comfortably on your lounge chair. In the evening the pool bar closes early, but we discreetly brought in our own bottle of wine without any issue."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"this is a most unusual hotel - built on three ""stilts"" with a boat afect at the top containing viewing, bars and restaurant, and the pool for the hotel.There is a fairly stiff charge to be allowed to go to the top via the elevators. can stay as long as you wish..great view. lots of younger people drinking, sicailizing, etc.. a one time expereince in my mind due to the cost of ticket to be able to go up to it"
,,Great views,5.0,,Great views and only $20 Can get access to the bar from here too seems better views than the flyer. Can also see a glimpse of the residents pool
,,Uh-mazing pool with a view.,4.0,,"Wow. Singapore set out to create an iconic building and here it is. This is one crazy-cool pool! You really do get the feeling that you are hanging over the edge of the city.

Order a drink and a bowl of fries, have a swim and take some snaps, then you might want to move on because it's really really busy up there!"
,,amazing view - the iconic skyline!,5.0,,"The bar at the top of the Marina Bay hotel, home to luxurious shopping and the most profitable casino in the world ($2B investment recouped in <1.5yrs... enter for free with a foreign passport! or else it's $100 for locals). Observation deck requires a fee, but the bar is free to visit! Of course you'll be paying far more than your share for drinks, but it's a must do in singapore. View from the top is just as impressive as from the bottom of the Marina where you can see such other famed sights as the floating soccer field."
,,Public access area is very small.,3.0,,"After paying $20, you are led up to the lifts going up to the 57/58 floors.
Once there, the area which you are entitled to go to is ridiculously small. Simply, you can cover the entire place, with photographs and all, within. The bar is always full and crowded, or have all seats ""reserved"".

With many other similar alternatives in the marina bay area, paying $20 to go up to the tiny SkyPark is simply a ripoff. Going for the novelty, yes. For the views, definitely no. Otherwise, only tourists will go up."
,,Lovely place to wander,5.0,,"Lovely walks with opportunity to people watch, the views of the city are superb. While you make wishes of returning someday"
,,Amazing,5.0,,"I did not get there in tome for the guided tour, so I was only able to visit the observation deck. Incredible views of Singapore from there. Must be a truly amazing place to stay."
,,Boating in the sky!,4.0,,"A place where you can see the whole Singapore from here! At one side you can see Ocean, the other side you can see another attraction which Garden by the bay, you also can see other sky crappers in Singapore..Beautiful view! and if you are lucky enough you can see a rainbow! (if suddenly it's raining while there is sunshine)
While I'm there we become Model for the day! Hahah, as my accompany on that day was different from me ^^ and the best part is we really enjoy while being there!"
,,Overated,3.0,,Looked forward to the visit here. Awesome views from the rooftop but apparently overcrowded with tourists with children running around everywhere. Avoid this place on weekends.
,,A fantastic attraction and a good view but the guards at the lifts should sharpen up...,4.0,,"We have been here some months ago to have a drink in the evening. A fantastic place to visit.

However this time I had dark sandals, long trousers and dark sock but what not let up due to my almost not noticeable sandals!!!!

The guards should be better trained and be able distinguish between tourists in swimming trunks a casual well dressed person with dark socks and sandals.....

We just laughed at this ridiculous behavior and left...and spent quite some money at another venue in town...."
,,Great views over Singapore City,5.0,,"Relaxing, view was excellent and I loved the adults only section. A nice afternoon cocktail by the pool with a snack was great. Pool was very cold which was surprising."
,,This is a place you really should visit,5.0,,"Go up on a guided tour I thin its at 14, 21 o clock. See the city at night is really special, and walk around in the constructed gardens and the pools on top of the building - its nice"
,,Superb,5.0,,Very well put together with a lot of thought and planning. Very entertaining to tourists. The evening light show was very good and also quite spectacular
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Superb view at the swimming pool area. Quite windy. Do warm up before going for a dip. It's cold in the pool. Try the cakes/pastries at the lobby area. Pricey but worth it. The rooms are spacey. For those who don't stay there, you have to use another entrance to get it. Go with a tour. Will be easier to get in."
,,Tickets cancelled,5.0,,Tickets cancelled on the Flyer due to electrical storms at the last minute. Thanks to Freddie and Ronnie from Duck N Hippo for getting our money back. Staff at the Flyer were not going to refund money as the scan showed we have used the tickets even though there was a stamped and handwritten message on it stating the ride had been shut down due to storms. So disappointed with the attitude of the staff member at the Flyer. Very disappointed that we missed this ride.
,,If you want to see Singapore on a different view this might be it for you.,5.0,,"What I liked about this is we got to experience to ride the fastest lift/elevator there is, that's what the operator said, and it was really fast reaching the 56th floor in less than a minute if that's not fast enough for you. The view was amazing, you can see the Gardens by the bay, Esplanade and a part of Singapore basically."
,,Great Views,4.0,,"As per the title, the views are impressive (especially straight down haha)
You're better off going when it's quiet for obvious reasons.
At $20 per adult to visit the Skypark, I'd have expected some sort of seating up there.
Note to people who wish to see the gardens and infinity pool: you will need to book into a special tour to see those as they are normally off-limits to the public."
,,Breathtaking,5.0,,"Marina Sands Skypark is a must do when in Singapore the views are amazing and if you go up at night it makes it all the more special. It costs $20 to go up but was well worth it and if you time it right 3 times a day there is a free tour to the guest only part of the roof terrace where you get the full marvel with the infinity pool over looking Singapore skyline, you cant get in and swim but it nice to see how the rich and famous live! Great photo spot."
,,Simply great,5.0,,What a view! What a glamorous hotel! What a neat light show! I was very impressed by what I saw. Please make sure you do the tour so you can go top floor pool and see more of the city.
,,CRAZY BUSY!,4.0,,"Get there earlier in the day because the afternoon, it is PACKED! We went after breakfast one morning and it was cold unfortunately in the water, we only stayed 30mins, but the kids enjoyed it too."
,,Great view,4.0,,"We went up thinking that we should go up not knowing if we would ever do it again. The kids enjoyed it, it wan't too high. Other than the weather being overcast, it was a perfect view."
,,On a budget? Buy a drink!,3.0,,"Don't buy a lift ticket. Go to the Ku De Ta desk on the floor directly above the lift ticket desk and get a pass to go to the bar. You can go up for free and buy a drink, ridiculously overpriced, but still cheaper...More"
,,Too Many Kids at the Rooftop Pool,3.0,,"The kids are running everywhere, there are people everywhere, and I'm not sure it's worth the price, but that is one heck of a view. If there is a way to separate the children from the adults in the pool area, then it could be...More"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great views, good food at the Club room, what more can you ask for ? Ah, maybe for outsiders, a dip in the fantastic infinity pool on the same level, but the catch is, you mst be a hotel guest to be able too. But...More"
,,Eye in the sky,5.0,,"The skyscraper looks like a landing place for an alien vessel! It's really original: When you look at it from the bottom, looks like the vessel is ready to move...From the top - behold Singapore and its neighboring islands. The swimming pool is awesome, whatelse!"
,,Crowded,3.0,,Not sure how they will get around this but the place is just teeming with screaming kids and really over crowded Perhaps they have to have some restriction on children who under 12 after 7.00pm Now the bar area is impossible to get a table...More
,,Great construction,5.0,,"Beautiful construction with great engineering,excellent view of Singapore from top observation deck."
,,Best Placr to Capture Singapore City View,5.0,,"This is the best place to capture the Panoramic Singapore City View. Get ready the camera. Can see as far as Indonesian island from this 200m hight MBS hotel roof top. If you stay in the hotel, you can access to roof top pool also."
,,Sky High in a Storm,5.0,,The Skypark runs acroos the top of the three Sands hotel buildings making a 56th floor. The public only get to visit a part of the Skypark - the pool etc is reserved for Hotel guests. We went up just a storm swept across the...More
,,Great Views !!!!,5.0,,I stayed at the hotel and went up to the Skypark. Thought the view was better in my room though : ). I like the Singapore Flyer better...
,,What a view,5.0,,"What a view, tickets are a little expensive but worth the price once you reach the top… the elevators are very fast and you don’t even realize you have reached the 56th floor… the best time to visit it in the late afternoon so that...More"
,,Excellent location,4.0,,The Sky Park on the Marina Bay Sands is really good. We went in the evening and waited till after sunset to see the city lights. It is worth going in the evening and enjoying both day and night. But it is very tiring as there is not even a single seat to sit on. I think it is on purpose as there is no time limit to the stay and with sitting comfort no one would want to leave. A definite recommendation to all visitors. The view is better IMO than the Flyer but we did both.
,,Should drop by,3.0,,"Went up to the skypark in the evening. The ticket price of $20 was rather steep but the spectecular view from the observatory was worth it! Not for a second visit though.The area to move around was limited to the skypark and I don't see any place to sit for those who wants to hang around longer to enjoy the view.

Overall, enjoyed the experience."
,,Worth having a look.,3.0,,We found this a little hard to find but it was interesting walking through the hotel towers. Definitely not for someone with a fear of heights but worth taking a look. We didn't do the free guided tour but we could still catch a glimpse of the infinity pool. Beautiful view of singapore.
,,Visit if this is your first time to Singapore,3.0,,I am not a tourist so spending SGD20 to access the Skypark alone is not really worth it especially after the visit to infinity pool is ended. The view does not impress me much. I will recommend for first time traveller to Singapore. Locals might want to choose to visit the bar at Skypark to enjoy the wind and view.
,,Visit if you staying at the MBS hotel,5.0,,We visited while we stayed at the MBS hotel. We really liked the Skypark as being guests we could use the pool also. If you are not a guest you can;t even walk around the pool and you are generally confined to quite a small place near the nightclub. You can still get nice views of the Merlion park and the Flyer but it's much nicer if you are staying at the hotel also. You have to pay an entry fee if you are not a guest.
,,Fabulous views and cocktail lounge,4.0,,"Amazing Casino style architecture, with Ku De Ta lounge on the top floor giving fabulous views over Singapore. We visited by night which was wonderful , just watch out for the price of the cocktails when you visit, but worth it for the view !"
,,Great place to hangout in Singapore,5.0,,The views from the top floor or Skypark at or near the pool area are amazing. Great for relaxing between business meetings!
,,Loved it!,5.0,,The entrance fee of $SGD 20 is worth it! Though we didn't manage to get to infinity pool. It is worth going up there. The souvenir photos are sooooo expensive though at $SGD45. much more expensive than the entrance fee.
,,Great view,4.0,,"My boyfriend and I went to visit the observation deck to check out the view of the city. We showed up early (10 AM) and there were no lines or waits. An elevator takes you to the top deck, where you can walk around, take photos and grab a drink or lunch (the restaurant wasn't open yet when we visited, as it was early). Really, really warm on the deck, even at 10 AM. Great to check out!"
,,Go to the top of Singapore at the Skypark,4.0,,"A must see in Singapore is the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Mall. The area around the mall the skypark at the top of the Hotel are two of the top attractions in Singapore. I think that if you tell them you are going to have a drink or eat at the bar in the skypark you can get up for free . If not it is 20 per person to go to the top of hotel, unless you are a hotel guest."
,,The Casino,3.0,,"We were a little disappointed with Marina Bay Sands. It was expensive for a drink. We did go to the top and the bar shut with six drops of rain fell. In the Casino you can smoke but not drink, so it is like walking into a wall of smoke. The view from the top is fantastic."
,,Wow,5.0,,"What a place! From the outside it looks mad and the views from the top are amazing.It costs $20 SGD to go up, but it is worth it."
,,Superb,4.0,,"The view is amazing, and it is much more amazing when you go there at night. The only thing for the reminder is that you can not bring tripod, I don't really know if gorrilapod is acceptable, but if you really want to take super quality pictures, take out the tripod while the security is checking on another side of the deck."
,,Not for the faint-hearted,4.0,,It cost $20 each which I thought was a little steep but for a wonderful view of Singapore it was worth it. We didn't stay long as one member of our group was desperate to get his feet on terra firma. Yes it is high but it felt safe. we decided not to think too much about there being nothing below us for 200 metres. Maybe we are cheapskates but we didn't enjoy the compulsory photo opportunity.
,,"Edgeless pool, gorgeous skyline of Singapore, perfect photo-op",5.0,,"You won't find such a gorgeous edgeless pool anywhere else even including Miami, certainly not such a high elevation! Beautiful view of the Marina Bay and Singapore skyline. The rooftop bar/lounge has a great ambience, and it's nice to see couples or ladies hanging out at the pool. Best to go at sunset or night. Great place to watch the Sands light show also."
,,Incredible views,5.0,,Ariel view of the most glamorous part of the Singapore. I went uo with my family and parents in law in the evening and had a great time shooting family pictures in the background of the beautiful scenery.
,,"First timer, go ahead but...",3.0,,"I have been up there a few times. My observation is that if you are first timer, yes give a try, it is worth going up even paying 20SGD, so you can boast about the experience. But from second time, may be keep it for occasions when you go up for drinks or meal up there when you are exempted for paying the entry fee."
,,Go for a visit of the Sky Bar! - It's Free too!,5.0,,"So I opted to skip the Sky Park (ticket price is 20+), and went to the Sky Bar (Kudeta is the name). You still get to go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands, so if you are after the city view, this is the way to go.

You don't have access to the pool / park area (you can't get in the pool unless you are a hotel guest anyway). So I did this twice and I enjoyed it both times!

I will go back to this attraction every time I'm in Singapore to take in the breath taking views. Do it both during the day and night, it is amazing!"
,,Location Location etc,5.0,,"Its great because its a pool in the sky with restaurants and views in an otherwise hot city environment. Having been to singapore I would only recommend this hotel or otherwise you are going to a city that is expensive, hot and at times boring."
,,sky view,5.0,,"Currently, the view from the top is quite an experience. I do feel the place is a bit commercially done and business is the key to tourists' dollar."
,,Excellent Views!,5.0,,"Don't pay for admission. Instead make a lunch reservation at Ku De Ta - have a drink and a snack for about $40 per person instead of paying the $20 admission to just the Skypark and not getting anything but a view! After your drink and snack, you are able to walk around the Skypark observation deck free of charge (with your receipt)."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,Go up for a drink and watch people seeming to swim up to the end of the roof of the skyscraper. Nice Gin and tonics for the price in a usual bar in Singapore but with a view to die for ( or if you are nervous of heights) a view to die from. Amazing!
,,Definitely worth it,5.0,,Definitely worth seeing. Excellent city views and of the harbour. Drinks at the bar are ridiculously expensive but that's expected.
,,Sea the whole singapore the sky way,4.0,,"Great way to stroll and relax above the sky. Skypark is the best place to whine out, bum and release your stress. You can actually see the whole city because it is even taller than other buildings. Don't miss the swimming pool tour at 2 and 9pm"
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,"It's a nice attraction if you're not afraid of height. Located at the 56th floor, you can see some of Singapore's famous places from above, like the Singapore Business District, Arts & Science Museum, Floating Stadium, Singapore Flyer, and the Marina Bay Gardens. A good place to take good pictures. It's quite pricey, though, SGD 20 for 1 adult."
,,very impressive,4.0,,"very interesting park, still developing but full of potentially amazing things to come, very hot to walk around as very little shade"
,,Views worth paying for,4.0,,"Wonderful view, one of the best place to get unobstructed view of Singapore city. In comparison to other locations around the same area, without doubt the view from the Skypark would beat the rest. However, one down side is that there are simply too many people within the small area."
,,Breathtaking!,5.0,,"The view from the observation deck is truly spectacular and in many ways the experience is much better than the Singapore Flyer which is close by. The view is much the same, it is cheaper, the Skypark is higher and you can wander around and enjoy taking as much time as you want. There is a very nice bar to sit and take in the views but it is certainly not cheap - Singapore Dollars 37 for two beers."
,,Wow....what a view!,5.0,,The view from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is simply phenomenal. The food served in the restaurants on the roof are just out of this world. The service is as good as it gets. This is something that needs to be experienced.
,,Great view. Make sure to sign up for the free guided tour.,5.0,,Great view. Make sure to sign up for the free guided tour. It's the only way to see the pool if you are not a hotel guest. The regular skypark is walled off from the pool. Sign up for the tour at the ticket counter and get there early in the day because the slots fill up fast. By the time we got there the only slots left were at night so we dutifully returned hours later but the view was fantastic.
,,Beautiful at night!,4.0,,Beautiful view from the top at night with laser lights. See singapore's city lights and enjoy a dip in the pool at the same time.
,,Visited during rain,3.0,,"During rain you'll get a warning, that no refund will be provided in case you get wet. I came up when the rain was just finishing. There's no roof (actually one dry spot is on the Marina Bay side of the skypark). You can see part of Sentosa, whole Marina Bay, city, Flyer and also Gardens and the sea (so it's approx 300 degree view)."
,,Stunning Views,4.0,,Unique in every sense looking back over the heart of Singapore and the Merlion. Good to have drinks and dinner although the pool is closed to non residents
,,The Infinity Pool Spectaular,4.0,,Although it cost roughly £18 for the two of us - it was worth every penny. The views from the top over the pool were really different to any other view you can capture - shame we couldn't go for a dip.
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Awesome jacuzzi at the top,nice view looking out to marina bay.the best swimming pool as well,infinity pool really got me dreaming going there again.ITS EXPENSIVE STAY thou"
,,one of Safdie's crowning glories,5.0,,"this great architect will be among the world's historically know finest - right there with gropius, van der rohe, saarinen, wright, etc....
and this has to be one of his finest...
a breathtaking masterpiece of form and function - the rooftop skypark is an amazing attration - the polished metal sculpture atop the three great towers....the disappearing edge of the htel pool and the breathtaking vistas of Singapore.....alll worth the $18 ride up the elevator to enter the facinating park ...a sight to see and shouldn't be missed ....
the museum, shoppes and casino all very interesting as well, expecially the museum...."
,,Expensive but beautiful,4.0,,"A little pricey just to go to the top, but the views are hard to beat. The tours of the infinity pool almost impossible to get. They fill up quickly so try to book as early as possible. Had dinner at the restaurant which was also very expensive but you are basically paying for the views. Glad we went, but once is enough."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"That so great to come here, like a dream. Swim and enjoy drinks, along with looking at Singapore from above is a most relaxing feeling."
,,The View,4.0,,"This was fantastic, the view says it all, with such a short time I am glad we got this one in, I was a bit sad we couldn't go to the hotel part and see the swimming pool that looks as if it is hanging on the edge of the building, but I did get a photo from the side of the part we were aloud into."
,,200m above sea level.,4.0,,"Been to the sand sky park few times, always love to have the surrounding view. If you choose the right time visit sand sky park , maybe you got a chance to visit the swimmimg pool. You will love it too. (The swimming pool only attend house guests.)"
,,Change in policy: Not able to view the infinity pool,2.0,,"It seems that the policy has changed! $20 used to allow visitors, who were not hotel guests to experience the views and the pool area of the sky-park. As of this time, you can no longer access the infinity pool as a visitor unless you are a guest. We did get a better view from the lounge area, but after spending $150 on two appetizers, two glasses of wine and two beers, we were hoping to get a view from the infinity pool. I wish I would have known, I would not have wasted my time. The view that you pay for was nice, but not worth $20. In writing this, I just want other readers to be informed of what they are getting for the money: I nice view, but barely even a peek at the infinity pool. Saying that, I would consider this an improvement if I were actually a guest at the hotel. We chose to stay at the Swissotel, which I am not disappointed at all!"
,,Awesome night view from the 57th floor !,5.0,,Marina bay Sands is connected to the Gardens by the Bay by a flywalk over the road. We went there using this route. We visited the bar at the top just for the sake of the views. The fee was around 20 SGD per head.Costly but totally worth it. Loved the beautiful night time views of the skyline.
,,Take the tour,4.0,,"Went there by MRT to Marina Bay, red line, need 1 more stop to go to MBS with CCE line, just top up 10 cent at the counter of the MBS stop. Go to the hotel lobby,at the end of Tower 3, turn left, and go to the entrance of Sky park. The ticket is 20 SGD, and can only see the observation desk, expensive. The best way is take the guided tour (15 minutes) at 10 am, 2 pm and 9 pm, you have the privilege to enter the pool side, got wet tissue and a bottle of water . You have to registered first since only 50 people can book for the tour at one time. The view is amazing from the observation desk and from the pool side as well. It is worth if you take the guided tour."
,,"Worth it. Amazing views, thrilling to see. Buyer your souvenir at the top!",5.0,,"Great views and great photos. Never a line, plenty of room, not crowded. Worth the price. Suggest avoid eating up there as there's no point, the foodcourt in the shopping mall below the hotel is better."
,,Amazing structure,5.0,,"Most unusual hotel, which unfortunately attracts too many tyre kickers. The pol on the roof is something that has to be seen. The rooms are excellent and spacious, with great views of Singapore and the coast. The shopping mall below and across the road will keep a keen shopper busy for days!"
,,its very windy up there,4.0,,"Worth a trip up for the view and some photos, although quite expensive. Try and book a table at Ku de Ta, the restaurant on the roof early, even before you go."
,,The Skypark.,5.0,,It is the most amazing experiences . The view is spectacular. It is a must if one is visiting Singapore. One day I want to swim in the Infinity pool.
,,Marina bay sands skypark,5.0,,"The best observation tower/building I have experienced by far & I have seen a few. Excellent view of singapores skyline through the glass & open areas of the skydeck. Value for money, a must see."
,,Simply wow!,4.0,,"Firstly it's the infinity pool. Secondly is the ambience of the place. And the wonderful view of Singapore skyline and the newly-opened Garden by the bay. This place is definitely worth a visit. A word of warning though, my father who has high-blood find the view from the top a little dizzying..."
,,"If you miss this, you're mad!",5.0,,"I generally hate modern architecture, but this place is incredible.

I can’t believe that reviewers are still complaining about paying $20, when a number of very helpful Trip Advisors have said that you don’t have to pay this fee to access the Skypark – Just ask the nice lady at the Ku De Ta counter for a pass for the bar and you can either go up in the lift for free, although I recommend buying a nice cocktail or 2 when you get to the top, watch the sunset and admire the incredible views of the Singapore skyline on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other.

Top Tip – if you video the views, which you will want to, make sure you save it…. I didn’t!!!"
,,Infinity Pool,5.0,,Amazing view obviously and the pool was great. It's worth the money to me! You won't get this view of Singapore anywhere else in the city
,,Great View of Singapore,5.0,,"I first went to the sky park back in 2010. I returned as a guest of the hotel in 2012 and always enjoy the view. The decor of the place is relaxed and peaceful. It's nice being able to view the city from the pool as a guest of the hotel. There is plenty to see and do. You can spend hours just gazing over Singapore, trying to get your bearings and picking out landmarks. Singapore from above just gets better an better. A great place to visit, price friendly, not over crowded. The cost to go up is worth it just for the view."
,,Absolutely Fantastic,5.0,,"To have travelled up to the Skypark after seeing it in the distance from our hotel room every day was the most amazing experience. The lift to the 56th floor was exciting and to arrive up there was like being on top of the world. My partner is not keen on heights but he also did the visit.
The young man in one of the shops downstairs had come to the shop on the top to serve us our individual needs. The staff were really friendly. A must-do in Singapore."
,,Great concept,4.0,,"From outside, it looks so nice, but when I went up for the views, it was just ok. But the views were definitely great. And realize there is swimming pool up there, just at the side of the ship, with the views of the city, just great."
,,Excellent view of Singapore - CBD & Ocean,4.0,,"The view from the skypark gives you 2 great views. First is the central business district, the lake, the Merlion statue of Singapore and the other is the ocean view with the many freight ships going in and out of the Singapore port. There is a bar to relax as well as have refreshments and beverages. Singapore is a beautiful city and the skypark provides an awesome way to see it all. The night is even more beautiful with all the lights across the ocean and the city."
,,One of a kind,5.0,,"Nothing quite like it. Infinity pool overlooking downtown Singapore. If you want a view OF the MBS, then go to One Altitude."
,,You won't forget the view!,5.0,,"We did not know that you have to pay in order to visit the Skypark, so we went to Ku de ta bar at the top, the view is unforgettable. Love it! we went on an evening, did both Marina Sands and Singapore Flyer on the same day, they are close, we walked from one to another.
Worth the money spent on a cocktail or a beer ;)"
,,An awesome place you should visit,5.0,,"This place is located at the top most floor of the 3 towers of Marina Bay Sands. It is situated at the 54th floor and you can see the whole city of Singapore from here. It has a swimming pool, restaurant, bar and pool side dining facility. If you are a guest of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, you get to go in free. Otherwise there is a charge to use the facility. The pool is not very big for you to swim like a tournament, but its a nice pool to dip in the whole day. From the pool at one side, you will be able to view the City of Singapore, and from the other side of Skypark is the sea view.
The place can be over crowed especially during weekends. Food is quite good. There is also a photographer, who goes around snapping your pictures in the pool and you can purchase the photos at their kiosk situated at one conner of the Skypark. On the whole, the Skypark is all about spectacular view. A place you must visit if its your first time to Singapore and dip your self in the pool. However i would not make it my top of the list place to visit on my next trip to Singapore, unless i have some extra time."
,,Breath Taking Scenary,5.0,,The MBS Skypark has a breath taking view. I could not take my eyes off the scenery of the Garden By The Bay from the top of the Skypark
,,Great view of Singapore's skyline,4.0,,This is a great vantage point to see Singapore's skyline. Best to go there in the evening to see sunset and the night view of Singapore.
,,View from the top is overrated,3.0,,"Took the elevators to the club lounge level for a free view, but we were disappointed. The infinite pool is rather short and could not be seen without having to pay to get inside for a drink, unless you are a hotel guest. The view next to the bank of elevators is nice but again very limited."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,"The skypark is all about the view view view!! Food is expensive, access to pool area is limited, weekend crowd can be over whelming but still it is a great place to visit . If you are a tourist you should not miss this place. Try to visit during the weekday around 6pm to get a good sunset view as well and to avoid entry fee."
,,Great view but no shade or seating,3.0,,"It is $20 to go to the skypark at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the view is spectacular. Unlike other high rise observation buildings there is no capacity to see the view from inside - you get out of the lift and go outside to a large platform with no seating or shade. Given the regular high temperatures in Singapore, it is very hot on the viewing platform so it was a quick look around and then back down in the lift. There is a restaurant and bar but meals and drinks are a bit pricy. You are not permitted to sit on the ground so I did not linger."
,,Nothing spectacular,2.0,,Luckily I was given free ticket to go up to have a view. Find that the admission ticket is not worh the price for the view.
,,Awesome View of Singapore,5.0,,"Once you get the view of Marina Sands three towers with what looks like a ship on the top you have to go up. For only $18 adult you get to see all of Singapore and the surrounding area. The try to get you with a souvenir photo with a greenscreen at the start but ultimately it is up to you to buy or not. The photo is printed for you by the time you get to the top floor.
The view is stunning when you get to the top. There is a tour if you want to take I am sure is imformative. There is also places to eat.
Overall it is a view you will never to forget."
,,Sky Park,4.0,,"We paid 20 $ per person to go up that interesting building named SkyPark Marina Sand Bays. It is very close to Flyer, you can go both in half day time. Up there, the view was amazing. I wish we were staying at that expensive hotel to be able to swim in that pool since visitors are not allowed to do so. If you get there in certain times you can join tour to go see pool area, othervise you are limited to the bar area. I liked the shopping centre nearby. All fine brand you can find there. There was a art shop which I loved, they had very nice paintings look like oil painting but used all sort of colorfull stones and dusts. Very nice, price ranged from 500 $ up. The parking is very expensive. We could not use our outopass card because they said it is a new card that the Tuas Checkpoint is giving to boarder line passengers which is not useable yet is many places in Singapore."
,,5* Plus............... but 'play the system' to get best value......,5.0,,"Brilliant...... one word sums up this experience. The whole area is stunning including the new gardens, the three towers of MBS Hotel, the shopping mall with gondolas on mini canals (I kid you not) and of course the view of Singapore from Skypark.
But $20 each is a steep price to pay, so head straight for the Kuh-De-Tah reception desk at ground level at the opposite end of the hotel complex from the main entrance (turn left out the shopping mall exit). Ask to visit their lounge and you'll get a ticket for free each and be shown the lift to 53rd(?) floor. From the lounge you have THE VIEW of Singapore plus the MBS affinity pool and we were made more than welcome by the kuh-De-Tah staff, and even paying our way with a Tiger Beer and nibbles each we came out at less than $20 each .
A Must Do!!"
,,"Lovely, but you dont have access to all areas",3.0,,"Nice =view to the sea, but the sections facing the city are baricaded off for hotel guests. A lot of cash for half a view."
,,The amazing viewing zone,5.0,,"Dont pay for this! They sometimes want you to pay to get up here.. Just say you are going to the bar or restaurent then you save yourself 20$ each time..
Instead of just standing on the deck, walk around the whole ""Roof boat deck"". Go to the skybar, the restaurent of the extremely nice 2nd. skybar right next to the infinity pool. Its amazing uphere..
I prefer to be up here at night due to the colours of the different skyscrabers, the lights in the dark is amazing.
- Remember your camera, an be patient... many others have the same idea as you about taking a lot of pictures on the same spot."
,,Skydeck worth the $20.,4.0,,Was a little put off by paying $20 to catch a lift to a roof. Once on the roof - you were treated to amazing views across Singapore Island. I am glad I did it.
,,"Go straight to Ku de ta bar, and skip the fee.",5.0,,"The view from the top of marina bay sands is excellent. You can either pay to visit the skypark, or head up to ku de ta and spend the twenty dollars on a cocktail - the view's the same!"
,,"Best view, besides Singapore Flyer",4.0,,"The Skypark of the Marina Bay offers of course the best view of the town. There are some restaurants up there but they just open in the afternoon. It would be nice to see more of the pool of the Marina Bay Sands, but I...More"
,,Great view of Singapore from the south,4.0,,"the MBS hotel, casino and skypark is a recent addition to Singapore and it is nice to be able to see the city from this viewpoint. You can see the urban, the modern and the tropical. There is a bar/cafe for you to sip your...More"
,,Great way to see Singapore and enjoy the sun setting,4.0,,Definitely worth a visit and the $20 pp cost did not seem so bad once you see the view and enjoy a drink at Ku Da Ta. We passed on the mounted photos...
,,The best view of course!,5.0,,"Well yes , it is the best view of singapore and seing it is just part of the must of singapore - as the view is so impressive, beautiful and complete ! saying that i think still a little pricy for just a view! i...More"
,,Excellent Hotel,4.0,,"Service was great, the pool was beautiful with excellent roof top views. Food was delightful and there were many shopping centres in the vicinity."
,,Great view,5.0,,View from the top is spectacular. There is coffee shop so it is great place to relax and enjoy in view.
,,Great View,5.0,,The best view in all of Singapore. They charge to go up and observe the view but it is free if you stay at the hotel.
,,Skypark Singapore,3.0,,"was OK, just another tall building experience, great views as you would expect. S$20 fee, but still OK to do"
,,A Long Way Up,5.0,,Just amazing. An experience we just couldn't miss. A view like no other. And really friendly staff. You don't go to Singapore and not go to the Marina Bay Sands Sky Park. So much to see and so many photos. Worth the small fee of...More
,,JUST DO IT!,5.0,,"For 17 Singapore dollars you got to the KuDe Ta Bar area 57 floors up ,one floor below infiniti pool deck for an unimaginable view over Singapore which gives a better view than night though without the lights. If paying with Amex, you get a 15% discount on ride for card holder
Twenty Singapore buys you a Beer so you may as well quench the thirst after your Lift ascent to ready you for the ride down.
Scale of the development walking through the long foyer area on ground is awe inspiring.
Catch train to Marina Bay then change to special train for Marina Bay Sands."
,,Need to stay at the hotel,5.0,,The view from the Marina Bay Sands is quite simply stunning. You overlook Singapore harbour and the business district which at night is breathtaking.
,,A fabulous view,5.0,,This new iconic tourist sight is a must see for those who want to have a birds eye view of the city. It's a very glamorous location as well.
,,One Time Look,3.0,,"After you've been up a few times it's the same views...nighttime is more romantic and fun, but it's not as well to take photos. Daytime can be very hot."
,,At gr8 Height... Nice view...can skip flyer for this place...,4.0,,"Its not free... u need to pay n buy a band 2 go to skypark... if ur staying @Marina bay sands hotel then its free....
Its worth u can enjoy fresh air makes you feel nice ..

Dont 4get ur Camera.... many pics 2 click....
Cheerz.. Enjoy...."
,,what a sight,5.0,,"this hotel/park is truly breathtaking. up on the roof in the sky park is the wonderful view of this bustling city. only regret is that we couldn't go into the pool alongside the park. definately worth a visit, simply breathtaking."
,,"Singapore ""short list"" of things to do",5.0,,"I did this during a Thursday night after 7pm, and decided to pay the $20 per person, which included a short elevator ride up to the 59 fl I believe....there is another way to get there by asking for Tower 3/Ku daTe bar, ( thereby avoiding the fee, which will let you enjoy a beverage ( for about the same price, however...)

Prior to getting to the tower 3, there are plenty of restaurants in the Sands that appeared quite nice/ trendy.....I read an earlier review that indicated that the viewing area could be quite bust, and uncomfortable....although my experience was not bad, I can believe the earlier reviews that it could quickly become crowded......"
,,"nice view, nice staff",5.0,,"Going up there is for free.. Amaaaaaazing view. On Wednesday evenings it's ladies night, you get a drink for free."
,,Imagination park,5.0,,SkyPark on the top of hotel is like usual park on the ground. Take time to relax and feel clean air there help you feel fresh.
,,You have to go!,4.0,,"I stayed at the hotel for a couple of days, wow, it is expensive but I am glad to have been there as this iconic building represents Singapore in the media as the Merlion used to do at one time. The skypark is better for people staying at the hotel as you can choose your times. early or late is cooler and there are fewer people about and the backdrop is great for pics at sundown and evening. During the day there were so many people there that it lost its attraction quickly."
,,Bravo view of the whole Spore downtown!,5.0,,"I cannot find another place which can give me this amazing view of this beautiful city! The so-called infinity pool is always crowded, awarded to this amazing creative design. Some restaurants there which can also enjoy the beautiful scene. Good!"
,,Busy and uncomfortable,2.0,,Maybe it was the season and particular time I visited but I found my time here unenjoyable and uncomfortable. The Skypark itself is mind-blowing but mixed with the crowds that were there it was not fun. I felt squashed up there in the middle of the sky and would really prefer if it had been quieter so you could take in what is surrounding you!
,,More worth it than Singapore Flyer,5.0,,"You have to pay an entrance fee to go up but the view is really amazing, the best I have ever seen in the whole of Singapore. View is similar to Singapore Flyer but the difference is you're not moving so you can walk around and take photos from different sides or buy a drink. But take note that you cannot see the famous swimming pool as it's for guests only."
,,Sky view,4.0,,"Best view of Singapore , The Bay, Downtown, Golf Course and Gardens by the Bay all for one price . Discount for American express card holders."
,,Great view,4.0,,It's worth going up for the experience and the views and to dream what it would be like seeing it all from the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel!
,,"Great views, but there's a better way........",4.0,,"Yes, if you're in Singapore it's worth going up and taking photos and getting a sense of the singaporean landscape. However, a better way to do it is to get a free guest pass to Ku De Ta Bar (if available) and using the entry fee you would have paid to go to the Skypark to buy yourself a drink and enjoy the exact same view with a cocktail in hand. You also have the added feature of a better look at the infinity pool. I've done this both ways and trust me, it's better using your money on a cocktail with a view, then just a view."
,,Garden in the Sky,5.0,,"Wow! Hard to find words to describe this place. Visible from a great distance, this massive shopping/casino/hotel complex is just breathtaking. Pay twenty Singapore dollars to take the super-fast lift to the viewing deck for unsurpassed views of this impressively modern and ever expanding city. The Shopping mall across the road has every type of retail and food outlet imaginable including all the major international designer names. There is even an ice rink (artificial ice) at one end of the mall surrounded by eateries and a canal with small boats flowing through the other end. Views over Marina Bay and the Merlions and the giant lotus shaped science museum as you browse the shops. Just so impressive. A must see."
,,A good view,3.0,,"It was good to go up for the view, but nowhere to sit when up there unless you go into the bar and get adrink, which is what we did."
,,excellent,5.0,,it was very nice and worth to be visited.you must have with you a tour guide at least to explain to you in details about every thing.
,,Just for the view,3.0,,Make sure you catch this at night - it is beautiful at night and you get to see Singapore and the amber lighted harbour. Make sure you make it before 10pm - it closes than.For SGD 20 you get to see lots of lights but that is all - don't expect too much
,,Amazing View over Singapore at Sunset,4.0,,"This place is a must see in Singapore, if you happen to be in the neighborhood of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It's right at the top on the 57th floor of this astonishing building, an epitome of Singapore and its role as a harbor and international city.
You tell the people downstairs you're going for a drink at the bar; enjoy your drink there, and you don't need to pay to go up there. Go there just before sunset, enjoy the panorama, and do not forget to bring along your camera for unforgettable memories of the place."
,,View is better,2.0,,"Thanks to a completed Gardens by the Bay, the view up there is better. but that's all about the sky park."
,,Great !,5.0,,"We visited it in the morning. It was a special tour so it was possible to enter in the garden of the hotel "" the sky garden"" with its famous swimming pool. The view is great ! Spectacular ! Just do it but Marina bay sand hotel is more nice from the ground !"
,,"A good view, but thats all",3.0,,"For the price, I would expect something a bit better. What you get is just a good view, but thats about it. There's actually a trick to get up there without ever paying anything. Its not something I did, but I noticed that you can do.

Go up in the guise of wanting to go to Kudeta lounge. The receptionist will give you a ticket to go use the 'other' elevator. After that, it depends on your charm and wit to get out of Kudeta and have a look around. Enjoy ;)"
,,Amazing building and great views,5.0,,Ku De Ta Club Lounge on the top level of the hotel building for a casual lunch and great views of Singapore.
,,Great view,4.0,,Great view but go early to avoid the coach tours. Pity the poor hotel guests who have to share the pool with crowds of gawking tourists.
,,Beautiful views,5.0,,"Quite difficult to find the entrance which is in the third tower of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, downstairs, but worth the trip, just a bit weird being so high with nothing under you! Beautiful views of a beautiful city all lit up."
,,Marina Bay Sands Singapore,5.0,,The set up fantastic It was raining we dislike is worth a visit It cost $20.00 dollars to go up and look at the view
,,A windy and sunny view,5.0,,"If you save 20 SGD, you miss an interested experience. When I went to the elevator, I thought I can make a sleep and then wake up to see Sky park. :-p No, only 10s, I can see the sky park. Elevator moves so quickly. In the 56th floor, I have a best view to see the city. A nice view n a sunny day- I love them. :D"
,,Breathtaking views and lovely setting,5.0,,"The views from Marina Bay are absolutely wonderful....the only negative is you can't see the hotel!! The trip is cheaper than the Singapore Flyer, the view is arguably better and you can stay at the top as long as you want!! Lovely place to spend some time relaxing"
,,defintely nice place to see the city from atop,5.0,,"Worth a trip, try the rooftop swimming pool around late afternoon so that you can have a city view in the day light, & in the eveng when lites of tge buildings & nearby locations come up. amazing experience. take lots of pictures"
,,Best view,5.0,,"Excellent view of singapore. Gives a different perspective. Must visit if visiting singapore. But its one of those things. Once you've done it, you wouldnt visit it again if you came back."
,,Good view!,3.0,,A rather expensive way of getting a panoramic view of the city but still worth doing. You don't get to the very top floor with the infinity pool as that is for residents only.
,,Breathtaking!!!,5.0,,"There is only one word: WOW! This is a must see!!! The view is amazing...You could see the whole city and the harbor. It is quiet up there and the serenity with the peace and the view will really take your breath away!!! Bring your family or loved one, this will impress them and the memory will last forever!"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"We checked-in at the Sands Hotel on our last in Singapore. The experience was amazing, great food, scenery was wonderful! Im going back definitely!"
,,Fantastic 360 degree view of Singapore,4.0,,"Rather crowded but the view is marvellous! Ku De Ta, the hip Balinese restaurant, is on the same level. You cannot visit the poolside although I was there courtesy of one of the hotel's directors; it was crowded. Architectural marvel as the park is literally sitting on top of - nothing!"
,,Does what it says on the packet,3.0,,"Exactly what you'd expect - a little overpriced, and nothing different to any other big tall building, but still, a really good view of Singapore."
,,infinity pool bar has great service,5.0,,"perhaps it was the bikini, but the waiters serving drinks were most attentive! cocktails at this pool overlooking the skyline are fantastic."
,,Great view,4.0,,"The view was amazing, but we felt a bit giddy as it was so high up! There was a band performance up at the skypark as well."
,,Epic view,4.0,,Go during a tour time to get most access. Lots of stuff is limited to guests. Kinda pricey. Infiniti pool is unbelievable.
,,YOU HAVE TO DO IT,5.0,,This is the current premier attraction in Singapore. The view is spectacular and a great vantage point for those who knew what the area looked like before the hotel was built. They kindly gave us seniors discount which was much appreciated.
,,Amazing views over the entire area,5.0,,"On our recent visit we decided to visit the Sky Park alongside the Singapore flyer. Our original intention was to visit the Flyer during the day and the Sky Park in the evening. However after booking my tickets online for the Sky Park I received an email stating that the park would be close early due to a corporate event in the evening. This didn't cause an issue as I am now glad that we went on the Skype park during the day. The views were even more spectacular than that of the flyer across the bay. The park wasn't particularly busy however it offered a large open space for plenty of guests to enjoy the views. It also offers a good view of the famous infinity pool just a little further down at the back of the hotel. On the Sky park there is also a small shop and a place to eat, however I have not experienced either of these to review.

The whole Sky Park experience was extremely worthwhile and relatively good value for money. If you have limited time in Singapore and wanted to visit either the Flyer Wheel on Sky Park to sample their spectacular views, I would say the Sky Park has the edge. Allow around 45 minutes to 1 hour for visiting this attraction (or longer at peak times)."
,,WOW!,5.0,,"100% architectural wonder. If you're lucky to visit on a clear day, you can see all the way to Bintan!"
,,It's high!,3.0,,"Nice view, from very high up. Avoid peak hour queues and don't forget that you can also decide to go the restaurant up there. Bring a camera because the panorama is worth snapping."
,,You got to be there to belive it,5.0,,"If possible, don't settle for the view and buy a ticket to the sky park pool. It feels like swimming to the end of the world.... A must."
,,Choose the Flyer instead,2.0,,"This is a spectacular building but the staff are keen to keep the riff-raff away so the trip to the top of the building is little better than herding cattle and once there the staff are unfriendly and unhelpful. OK, it is a high roller hotel and they are trying to preserve the image but if that is the case, don't market the Skypark as a place to visit non-guests."
,,great,4.0,,"The structure is awesome both exterior & interior. View form skypark is good, but you get the same view from flyer / but not the exterior feel!! Again cost is 20SGD!!"
,,Do this early on in your trip! I loved it and dont like heights,5.0,,"The lift is amazing! It really doesnt feel like you have gone so far in such a short amount of time and its a super smooth ride. I dont like heights but felt very comfortable in doing this.
There is an audio tour if you wish to listen. I choose not too, but my husband did.
It did get a little windy when we were up there, but still glad that we were able to do it as on a previous night it was closed due to bad weather. If you are on limited time I would plan to go to this early in your visit just in case they close it due to bad / extreme weather."
,,Amazing views of Singapore!,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to Marina Bay Sands Skypark, it was well worth the S$20! We went at night, the views were amazing and we also enjoyed having a couple of drinks at the bar to soak up the experience... We can definitely recommend the Sangria!!"
,,The boat on top of a hotel,5.0,,"Don't pay the ""trip"" price, just go to the bar for a drink - then enjoy the view, with a cold drink!
You can walk about and enjoy everything there is to see without paying the $20 entrance fee - you still see everything there is to see."
,,Make sure you do guided tour,2.0,,"I heard the admissions fee used to be $40. I would have been really really angry had I had to pay $40 to visit this ""park"" which was really a tiny corner of the ship that was up on the 5x something floor of the Markina Bay Sands. Yes, the view is pretty beautiful, but you dont need to spend more than 15 minutes on there before you are done with the sky deck. It now costs $20 and you get a tiny bottle of water.

In order to get more bang out of the buck you are spending here, ensure that:
1. you sign up EARLY for their daily tours (10am, 2pm, 9pm) as they get filled very quickly
2. come back right before the daily tours, so you dont sit around waiting for nothing for an hour like i did.

The best tour to go to is the 9pm one - go right before dusk to watch the sun set, maybe if you have $$$ have a drink in one of the restaurants up there, then go on the tour that allows you to check out the infinity pool (no access without being in the tour). You don't get to swim in it regardless. After the tour (which doesn't explain anything to you and basically only gets you access to check out the pool for 15m), at around 9:30pm, the light show begins down by the esplanade and you catch a gorgeous view of the light shows."
,,Awesome view over Singapore,5.0,,"I love viewing city skylines, especially at night. The vantage point from the Sands Skypark is just spectacular. The viewing deck is only a small corner of the Skypark, you can't go near the pool of anything as that's just for guests. We were there the week before the F1 Grand Prix so the whole street circuit was illuminated below us. Great experience!"
,,For family ONLY!,3.0,,"If you go with the whole family in Singapore, please go here instead of shopping. But, if u go with friends or solo, and doing sort of backpacking and budget traveler things, do go here! EXPENSIVE!!"
,,Guided Tour,4.0,,"Pre paid entry and guided tour online from Australia.

On arrival booking counter given access tickets for deck and guided tour, booked on 10:00 am tour, guide escorted group up to Infinity pool deck, tour group visitors are allowed to access the first 50meters, pity the Hotel guests having tour groups over looking them, however they have another 300meters of pool to escape to.

Guided tour takes 20 minutes.

Allowed to stay on lower observation as long as you want to.
Well worth the visit."
,,Wow wow,4.0,,"Went there with friend , we both love it there as traveling as a single girl it really suit us.
It so luxury and we love all the shop there . It a bit more expensive than what we expected but for window shopping is fun!"
,,Worth a trip,5.0,,"There is plenty to see in this area and if you don't mind walking that is the best way to do it, but the river cruise does come up here. The buildings are an architectural achievement in themselves, stroll over the Helix bridge which is beautifully lit at night."
,,"Nice, but probably nicer looking from the outside",3.0,,I am not sure if it's worth it to spend money to just go up to see it. We had dinner up at Sky on 57 (definitely not worth it) so they just send you up there. I think the best plan would be to go up there for a drink (either at Sky on 57 or Ku De Ta) but I would not eat at Sky.
,,Wowser!,5.0,,"Loved the Skypark. Went up at night first and did feel a bit queasy regarding the height. Good view of the lit skyscrapers opposite. However, we did really want to see the infinity pool so made enquiries about the free tour. The lady told us to get there around 9am to queue before they open the doors at 9.30 am. This is because travel agents can rock up and buy multiple tickets and quickly take all the available tickets ( only 50 for each tour). We were 1st in the queue so got on the 10am tour no problem. So worth it as you can to see the fantastic pool and take good photos. Much preferred visiting the Skypark during the day - did not get so much of a feeling of vertigo and the views are amazing. The deck is huge so if you do suffer from vertigo don't let that put you off - as you do not have to be anywhere near the edge."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"An out-of-this-world experience. The Skypark is truly amazing. It cost $20SGD per adult (small bottle of water + wet packaged towel included in this amount) for the tour but was well worth it. The tour guides were also very happy to take photos of us so this was a great opportunity to get our family in the one photo. The ""official"" photos they take of you on arrival aren't worth it - they also have a photo in the background ie. not the real view. Don't miss out on the experience of the Skypark."
,,What a View!!,4.0,,"Most people go up there for the view and it doesn't disappoint. The drinks are expensive, but it is to be expected from this type of place. Just have one and enjoy!! Just don't go up there is there is a storm expected and everyone rushes for the lifts :/ Luckily we were staying in the hotel, so were able to bypass the lifts in Tower 3 :)"
,,excellent view of the city,5.0,,good value for money - only $20 to have a great view of the city. The lift up to level 56 only took a few moments. The only downside to the viewing platform was no places to just have a rest and a seat. You could purchase a cofee but not sit at a table to drink it which was a tad dissapointing. You get the feeling you are there for 10 minutes and move on. The price for the photo at $40 was a bit rich too.
,,Pretty with a cost.,3.0,,"Quite a magnificent view with a $20 fee.. But I wouldnt say it's a must-do for every trip in Singapore. Once should be enough. I was there to view the sunset but the other 200 people there for the sunset as well in a limited space was quite annoying. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time. The staffs there were really helpful, took photos for us, explained what was where and really helpful. But one time is enough."
,,The best view of Singapore !,5.0,,"Ypu can basically have a 360 ' degree view of the whole os Singapore. Having a nice glass of mojitos from Kudeta certainly elevated the overall experience. Select a nice clear dry day for this outing, a nice time would be around 6 pm ish."
,,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,4.0,,"Very well organised great panoramic view of Marine Bay,the view looking out is outstanding. Looking down on the garden is like looking down on fairyland at night"
,,A great view of Singapore and lovely pool,4.0,,"This is probably one of the best views in Singapore. The whole area has been very well designed and it is worth a look. It looks a lovely spot to take a dip. We were staying at the hotel, so entry was free. I understand that there is a charge if you are not staying at the hotel."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Wow, 57 story's all the way to the top and the view was simply amazing, could see as far as the eye cold take you. We stayed for a nice cold beer enjoying the sun for 2 minutes before the weather turned to thunder and lightening, we were the only ones to stay outside sitting under a sun umbrella, neat. We are going to stay here next time we are back in Singapore."
,,Nice View can looking view of Singapore,5.0,,"We were go up to top floor 57floor very nice can see every thing, pub on roof top nice but drink very expensive a bottle of beer was S$16++ that i can buy in my country almost a case"
,,Exquiste View,5.0,,"Here you go 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Ask for club longe coupon and bomb up the lift...ofcourse buy yourslves a drink in the lounge lest you throwen out. I think it makes more sense to just pay 20 bucks for the view. I would rather pay 18 bucks for a glass of hoegaarden beer and get to see the view free. Make it around sun set, so enjoy best of both worlds... marevellous view of Singapore skyline. Picture perfect."
,,This is the second great garden in singapore,5.0,,Very wide and large garden near the great hotel marina bay sands. Also the lamp is very spectacular especially in noon and night.
,,Just skip Ku De Ta,4.0,,"Worth the visit an a great view of Singapore, havea drink instad of paying the ticket but skip the Ku De Ta restaurant as it does not deliver on the food at all."
,,Gotta Go,5.0,,"Okay, yes they charge for the elevator ride to the top. The view from there is worth it. The bar has nice cold beverages and if you are lucky, you might strike up a conversation with people around you that is as interesting as the view. They do a nice job of showing you some of the construction."
,,visit ot Marina Bay SkyPARK,4.0,,"Good place to visit allow lots of time to explore and take in the view.The visit to the restaurant is must,Tip star your day in the morning and visit as much as you can during day light to get good view of the gardens."
,,Amazingly different to anything I have every seen,5.0,,The imagination is outstanding. Looking down on the garden is like looking down on fairyland at night
,,Skypark,5.0,,"We enjoyed our afternoon and morning swims, while getting service from the bar and restaurant. Walking the full length and looking over from the lookout points to the sea I was amazed the number of ships."
,,Not impressive,4.0,,"We didn't know that there's a dress code in the place, no sandals or rubbers shoes. Since we are tourists from Canada, we were not aware that there's that kind of dress code rule in a non-formal and open air place like that. They asked us a proof if we are resident of Canada and we showed our driver's license. To our surprise, we saw some guest wearing short pants and sandals and we felt a little bit discriminated. The experience with people may not be good, but we just enjoyed our drink and company. Our group had been to Altitude in Singapore and the place is far better than Marina and no discrimination. The Altitude actually is the highest building in Singapore."
,,Worth the ride to the top,5.0,,"$20/adult, $14/child gets you up to the viewing deck 56 floors up. This will give you an amazing view of the city. Probably the best viewing point in Singapore.

The trip to the top is effortless and just takes a few seconds. Depending on the haze/smog level of Singapore will depend on how far you can see.

Well worth the cost, just to say that you have ""been there, done that"". Especially if you are not fortunate to be able to stay in the actual hotel itself."
,,Infinity Edge Pool 57th Floor !!!!,5.0,,"Great Pool area, We were guests so we weren't limited to just looking. I dont think it is actually worth the $20 SGD to go up there and just have a look. Yes the view is great but its a big tease when you can see everyone cooling off in the water, drinking cocktails.
If your not staying there its not worth it."
,,Terrible,1.0,,"What has Singapore become; they want to be known as the Garden City, yet this aweful concrete jungle has been built.....the foyer is like a bus terminal. Rooms well appointed. Don't stay here it is expensive, overrated and bloody awful!"
,,Nice roof top bar for drinks,4.0,,"Worth the view and a drink - at least once. Music at the bar was ok. There are sooo many people, no one goes there... ;- )"
,,Amazing View!,5.0,,"For just a minimal amount, you can get up to one of the highest point in Marina Bay to take a look at the whole area. The night view is especially fascinating"
,,Amazing views!,4.0,,I got access to this as I was staying at the MBS hotel. Great views over Singapore and definitely worth a visit although only hotel guests have access to the infinity pool.
,,Unique concept,4.0,,"As expected it was very crowded, so go early to secure a deck chair. And don't forget to bring your key card - one card one admission."
,,Great view,5.0,,Great view but instead view from the free to enter floor above th e observatory (skybar) as it is FREE
,,"Great view, not much else",3.0,,"Our visit to the sky park was relatively brief, as theres not a lot to do other than look at the view. We got a taxi to the entrance and purchased tickets right there. They took a photo in front of a green screen when we went in, had a look at a model of the complex, then ascended in a lift to the top.
Stepping outside, you have a great view looking over the gardens by the bay that then sweeps around to the flyer and the F1 track, then onto the city itself. The view is high, unbroken and as good as you can get of Singapore.
Our criticism would be that, thats about it. There is no information on the building, the views you were looking at or anything extra.
The deck has no roof, so it can be quite hot, although there are shaded areas. You can also see the hotels swimming pool from one vantage point, which is up some stairs and the best spot for a photo looking over the bay as the barrier is lower.
There is a cafe/restaurant in centre, but when we visited it didn't look open, which was dissapointing as we would have loved to sit and have a drink. A person to take your photo would have been nice too, but we still really enjoyed it and thought it good value, so I would recommend a visit as the view is excellent."
,,"Great views, day and night",5.0,,"The Skypark is just amazing to visit, for a great view over the Marina Bay. Staying at the marina Bay Sands hotel will give you access to the full park with the huge pool, which should be even a better experience all-together."
,,You are almost in haven,5.0,,Go there and see Singapore ! A very unusual building with so much to see inside as well. Also the restaurang on the top is something very special KU DE TA
,,Magnificent view of the bay from the Skypark,5.0,,"I went to the Skypark around 2pm. After getting up to the sky deck, beautiful blue ocean view with cargo/cruise ships far and near filled my sight! In contrast with the greenage of the Gardens by the Bay, the river that runs through the city, and the skyscrapers, this is definitely one of the best city views that one can image! You can see almost everything from up there. Make sure you reserve for a guided tour upon purchase of your ticket (only offered 3 times a day with limited space!) for the chance to visit the swimming pool in the sky, which is usually restricted to hotel guests. They even give you a wet towel and a bottled of water at the beginning of the tour to help you cool off~"
,,Nice View,3.0,,"As you would expect, the bar was very very expensive, but the view was almost worth it. Very nice. Sunset is obviously a great time to go."
,,Unparallelled Views,5.0,,It is like floating in the sky among all the tall buildings and the swimming pool looked like a dream.
,,Great view,4.0,,"they can charge up to $20 SGD to go to the top but if you say you are going to the bar/restaurant you can get up for free. but you will have to buy a drink. PS its closed off during the F1 race :( unless you are staying at the hotel, nice shops below"
,,Expensive,4.0,,"Did a trip to the top, best time to go is in the evening when singapore is lit up.note that the pool is only for residents which is fair enough as they are paying a lot of money to stay here."
,,A bit too pricey but fantastic views,4.0,,"Paying $20 to go up a hotel and not even access the pool nor the gardens was a bit too much for me but my boyfriend insisted for us to go. When we bought our tickets, we had a surprise : we discovered that they were organizing 3 tours a day (15 minutes only) of the pool and the garden which gives you a bit more to see (but it's a first come, first serve basis and groups cannot exceed 50 people). I have to admit that I didn't regret going up the hotel. The view was great and we enjoyed the sunset and the city turning into night mode. Moreover, there's also a bar and restaurant where you can enjoy a drink or dinner while watching at the amazing views. But I find the drinks too expensive. So, if you decide to go up there I would say go around 6.30 and make the most of it."
,,Breathtaking View,4.0,,"Like : The view was excellent especially if you during the sunset. The bar offers pretty good drinks and sitting space. If you go during the day, make sure you have your sunglasses can be really glaring. Stay a little longer and you get to catch the water and light show below at the marina water bay. Excellent.

Dislike: The drinks are way way to pricey. I didin't get to check the food. Also, it can be really packed and swarm with people so just be careful."
,,What a rip off!,2.0,,"We tried to go up there once, but it was closed for a private function. It was a sign, which we obviously ignored. We turned up again on a different night, paid 20 dollars to go up there in the evening and we expected to come back with some nice photos. Unfortunately, we were told by the security staff that we were not allowed to put our camera on the tripod - sadly, this was the only way to take a decent photo of ourselves in the dark - security guard didn't give as an explanation as to why we couldn't use a tripod - we were not taking professional photos, just snaps of us for our private photo album. In addition to that, most of the skydeck is enclosed in a glass fence, which makes taking photos 'a little' difficult'. For that price, it's not worth it. There are other places in Singapore from where you can get a nice view of the bay. We would expect to at least get a complimentary drink in the bar for our 40 dollars! 2 stars just for the view, but the rest was terrible. Would not recommend it to anyone."
,,Dodgy roof top bar!,1.0,,"We visited the roof top bar to have a couple of drinks and admire the panoramic view. The bar we found very impersonal, and the bar manager actually accused my son of not paying for our drinks!! Despite the spectacular view, I wouldn't recommend a visit!"
,,Birds eye view of Singapore,5.0,,"Great place to have a birds eye view of this city. Nice infinity pool overlooking the skyscrapers, good bar and restaurants, something for everyone."
,,Expensive & Limited view,2.0,,"It takes some kind of juggling to get the ticks and get to the elevators to the floor. If you can, say you are going to the bar and get a free view. It's not a complete view of the city, one part of it is enclosed so it was a disappointment."
,,Stunning!,4.0,,A must visit for any tourist to Singapore. A truly spectacular attraction. The view from the top is stunning.
,,$15 to go to the observation level,4.0,,well worth the money to get to the top of noahs arc. if you want to have a wander around the rest of the top floor you will have to make a booking to get into a tour.
,,Spectacular but very hot,4.0,,"We made our way to skypark as we thought this would be a great experience, it was but we were slightly disappointed, took us some time to find the entrance then more time to buy tickets which was not easily signposted, but we got our tickets and made our way to the top. The view was spectacular but we had been on the flyer also so not much difference, found we could not see the pool unless we booked onto a tour or were staying in the hotel, and the next tour was 4 hours away, we also found there was no shade at all, so on a very hot day we did not stay long as the heat was unbearable. If you have to decide which attraction to take I would go with the flyer, unless you book the tour with the skypark"
,,Nice view over Singapore but costly,4.0,,"The observation is accessed from the third tower of the Marina bay hotel , you should buy your tickets in the basment floor accessed outside the tower.
Try to check for discounts (when we were there , American express card gave some discount).
The view from the room is very nice , mind you can not access the pool on the roof or even to view them from the observation."
,,Ask for a Pass to Ku De Ta - Don't pay,4.0,,"They wanted $20 to go to the observation deck to see Singapore from the 56th floor observation deck. I did two things; I asked to go to the Sky Bar in Tower 1, got on the elevator and snapped some nice pictures. The security guard was nice enough to let me get some snaps of the Garden by the Bay. Then went back down, walked over to Tower 3 and told them I wanted a drink. This was during the day about 1pm. Got the free pass to Ku De' Ta. Went up, had an $18 50cL Stella Artois beer and scored awesome views of downtown Singapore. The pool on the top of the hotel, which is right next to the bar, goes right up to the edge!!"
,,Don't pay,4.0,,We said that we wanted to go to the bar for a drink and managed not to pay anything....this made it worthwhile the view is amazing.....so blag your way up :)
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"What an experience, not to be missed if visiting singapore, go to the top and have a drink and take in the views."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"It sits right on top of Marina Bay Sands. It give you an exhilarating view of the city and the skyline. Great spot in the evenings, Highly recommended"
,,Great View of Singapore at night,4.0,,Interesting for anyone who has not been here. For those who are swimming will have better view. Good for an experience! Kids will like to be in the pool.
,,Hmmmmm...,2.0,,"Stayed in the incredibly expensive hotel for the privilege of using this. Spent about 5 minutes up there. Absolutely packed. All the food is hideously overpriced. And you constantly feel like you're on display to the hordes of tourists who get herded through the pool facility and to the observation deck. Was it worth the experience - not really. The who pool is only a couple of metres wide. And you can't really swim cause you will bump into people - its just really for taking a photo. Perhaps my previous two weeks on beautiful, serene and empty thailand beaches have influenced my review here though."
,,OMG,5.0,,This is a must. Book to do the Pool and Garden tour when you go up to the Sky Park. The hotel itself is a little confusing to work your way around. Be prepared to ask for help as the maps do not assist.
,,"WOW, WHAT A VIEW!!!",5.0,,"The view here is just sensational and the staff make the experience so much better - so personal and attentive. A business associate and I arrived about 5.30pm, relaxed in the comfortable reclining seats, enjoyed beer and nibbles for about 3 hours as the sun went down and nightlife kicked in. I would veit there again no worries."
,,Overrated,3.0,,Very over priced and it's hard to get a good view or photo through the thick plastic surrounding the deck. A photo will cost you $30.00.... we wouldn't go again.
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"Beautiful pool, excellent view, great location. if you catching MRT go to bay front station not Marina bay sand"
,,skypark,5.0,,what a amazing view and you can swim right up to the edge giving you fantastic views you can watch the f1 from here and see maybe 3/4 of the track and there 4 litre tiger beers by the pool hmmm
,,"very grand hotel, skypark is good too",4.0,,"hotel looks amazing, went there to visit the skypark, but wished I had stayed at least one night at the hotel too. Skypark was good, nice views of singapore. The guided tour of the infinity pool was good, but as only hotel guests can swim in the pool, we were unable to go right up into the pool."
,,Infinity pool up in the sky,5.0,,"If you are a hotel guest, entrance is free to the skypark. If not, be ready to shell out something like SGD20 per person. The swimming pool is fantastic and it gives you a view of the city. A Jacuzzi is also available"
,,Not much to see,3.0,,You get a view of the city up high but it was nothing amazing. The 20SGD ticket gave you access to part of the Skypark that did not include a view of the infinity pool. We were told of this when we got the tickets and so expected this but still thought the views were nothing special when we got up.
,,A view like no other,5.0,,"If flyer gives a vertical 360 degree view of Singapore, the Skypark gives a horizontal one. Go around 6 and stay till end to catch the laser show across the bay. You won't regret it. If you are going on weekends or holidays, go early as the entry is limited to a certain number of people and the tickets get sold out."
,,Views are fantastic,5.0,,We visited the viewing deck at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel complex out of this world and a definite experience when in Singapore
,,Not to be missed,5.0,,For a few dollars you can enjoy priceless views of the city. Especially during sunset this is really stunning! Drink your tiger at high altitude :-)
,,What a view!,4.0,,"Take a visit to the skypark at Marina Bay Sands, $20 Singapore dollars well spent. The view is fabulous and if you have time sit back and enjoy a drink while you take in the views! The shopping complex at Marina Bay Sands is well worth a look as well, even has its own water canals plus all the high end shops. Easy access via MTR"
,,Great Views,5.0,,"The best elevated views that I had when I was in Singapore. When you get your tickets watch the time stamp on them very carefully, as if they close the skypark due to heavy rain you can get a refund if you have not been up there for an hour. This almost cost me but lucky for me the rain let up. It is well worth the S$20 to see the views."
,,Fantastic place,5.0,,"Having stayed at marina bay sands in the past, we wanted to show our friends the pool and view from sky park but the $20 to go to skypark did not include the view of the pool area. A little misleading as you would think the trip to skypark would include the world famous pool"
,,At the Skypark,5.0,,"Toured the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands first then paid the $20 each to visit the Skypark. Best to be up there an hour or so before sunset and stay for an hour or two after sunset. Great photo opps then. There are jacuzzis at the edge of the park. We didn't but you may be permitted to lounge in one. Call and ask if you can. Then, if so, you could wear your suits under clothes. We took sandwiches and snacks with us. Prices in at the KU-DE-TA restaurant at the Skypark are $148 ++ each per person with a minimum of 2 people."
,,Really outstanding views,4.0,,"57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and LOTS to see. The views are OUTSTANDING from every angle. Look at the bay, the gardens, even the container yard and be impressed. There are also plenty of (expensive) bars and restaurants to choose from, even an 'infinity edge' swimming pool!"
,,Kids and tourists.,4.0,,"The view is of course, one of the most breathtaking in the world. That's what the 4 stars are for.

But with the size of this hotel, the pool is full of tourists and kids. (obviously) Kind of gives it a cheap public pool/resorty feel.And there is NO shade..There is a kid free zone...but still....

If your not staying at the hotel you have to pay to go up there I think?

One visit is enough. Take your pics. Go shopping."
,,must visit,4.0,,Good place to walk in the morning. It is a fun trip for the children and the elderly. It is a must to bring the Camera along as there are lots of beautiful sites.
,,Fantastic View,5.0,,"It's a great place to view the city from. Ok, it's $20 to get in but have since been told that if you say you are going to the restaurant then you can get in for free."
,,Top of the World,5.0,,The Skypark is the best part of MBS. I dont think there's anything else like it in the world. Worth the visit whether you are staying at the hotel or not.
,,The best infinity pool.,5.0,,"It is one of a unique skylark per he'd on the 57th floor.It commands the best panoramic view of the city specially the bay.Most relaxing with very nice service for drinks and snacks.If one wants to chill and relax no better place than this.Even if you are not a guest a must visit.You have to pay about SGD 20 Appox for entry if not a guest of the hotel,"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"You can see all of Singapore here! We had free entry here because we stayed in the hotel. However, if not, one would has to pay $20 which I think is a bit exhorbitant just to walk around and take pics."
,,A little too hyped,3.0,,"It was ""something you should do when in Singapore"", so we did. It was OK, nothing too special. Yes the views were great, but it is an expensive view!"
,,Magnificient Views,5.0,,The panoramic views enabled us to bring home some lovely video footage to remember our trip to Singapore. We could see the Marina Bay Sands Skypark from out Novotel Clarke Quay Hotel room so it was fantastic to actually be there. The views were great.
,,Up in the Air,5.0,,"We decided to go to the Skypark instead of the Singapore Flyer ride. You can stay as long as you like -58 floors up.
Great views.
There is a charge involved (Seniors cheaper).
Also have about three free tours when you are up there ( one at night). It would be a good idea to check the time for these before deciding when to go."
,,Great views,5.0,,"A nice way to see Singapore from a different view. The entrance fee is a bit steep, but you can take your own sweet time to take in the views. Best time to visit is the end of the afternoon."
,,Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Well, the Hotel is Huge! The lobby is very much like checking into a Mall. There are people everywhere. I'm glad we didn't stay there. The Hotel connects to a beautiful mall with all the best shops in the World. A must see is the top of the hotel, and of course you must pay $25.00 to get there. Once on top you can see for miles on a clear day and it's guite breathtaking!"
,,Great view,5.0,,"This is the best view in the city. If you are staying at the hotel, go up early to avoid the crowds. We had breakfast up at the cafe at 7am and only saw 2 other guests."
,,Very nice views,4.0,,"We found that the ticket was a bit expensive (20 SGD) but the view is really nice!! The only thing that is a bit annoying is that you can only go on the deck and that’s it really!!! They could offer a complimentary drink or something else as the only thing they are selling is a good view when it is not raining!!! The time we chose was just before dusk and we saw all the lights open from the skyscrapers, I will recommend this time for a visit. I believe visiting the Sands Sky Park is a one off thing to do just for the experience and the great views!"
,,Nice view but expensive,3.0,,A great view of the city but very expensive Lovely to sit drinking cocktails looking over the city - the professional photos were nice but too expensive
,,Amazing hotel,5.0,,Restaurants shaped like a boat ate very top...scary if you don't like heights. Loved the views and the food too
,,Nice view but not much to see,3.0,,good to be high up to see the bay and city. scenic is good. have very nice pool and bar there too. at night you would see the light show as well.
,,Beautiful views!,5.0,,"Go into the hotel lobby and say you want to visit the sky bar for a drink. They give you ticket for the elevator and you can have drinks in the bar and then go through to observation deck. No charge for admission just the cost of your drink which, was less than the admission. A great wee visit!"
,,An amazing SkyPark,5.0,,"We had very wonderful view about Singapore panoramic, day and night time, made us so impressed and made us stay longer and longer."
,,Nice view but overcrowded,4.0,,"Excellent view of the city skyline, however, it is overcrowded and feels much like a public beach. Everyone just want to dip their toes in the pool."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,At S$20 for visitors it was well worth it. The view from the ground alone is breathtaking. Once up we found ourselves in awe of the achievement that is the Skypark. Gives a whole new take on the skyline. Bit sad to look down and see the poor Merlion forgotten though. At night the laser show is brilliant. Well done Singapore!
,,Incredible views at Sunset,5.0,,"or for the lazer show twice a night below. Don't pay 20 dollars to go up for the view, go to the bar and spend the 20 dollars on a cocktal ... just be careful you don't stay too long, or your bar bill will be as high as the swimming pool!"
,,Visit for the views but give the drinks a miss,3.0,,"Sands Sky Park at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel is worth a visit for the views but the drinks are very expensive and not great quality unless you stick to water or beer. My advice would be to go up to the viewing platform take your photos and move on for drinks. Sunset is lovely up there on a clear evening. As an alternative for views you could try Altitude Bar in Raffles Place - that has even better views and better drinks, you have to pay to go in but you do get a drink included. Altitude also provides a great view of the Marina Bay Sands nightly laser light shows"
,,Nice view,4.0,,Breathtaking view and a great place to capture the landscape of Singapore. My kids just love running round the park. Free for MBS guests but S$20 for non-guest. There are restaurant serving good food but not very crowded. A souvenir shop to attract the kids.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Its in my review of the marina bay sands hotel for details but its simply out of this world. Even better dare i say it than Traders sky bar in KL. thats a big boast but it is. Im an old 35 year old and after the DJ kicked in i found it too loud but we were taking it easy. If you want to party and can afford it, ths is thee place to do it"
,,Don’t pay the SGD 20 per person – Just go to the SkyBar for free,4.0,,"If you want to visit the Sands SkyPark you will be asked to pay SGD 20.- per person. You will found the access one level below the main lobby at the east of the 3rd tower.
You can also have access to the bar from SkyBar and SkyRestaurant reception, located on the main floor at the center of east tower. For about 9 SGD for a soda, you have a better view to the SkyPool and about the same view to the city. When leaving the bar you can access the terrace for free (terrace accessed by the persons who paid SGD 20.-)."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,"I hadn't intended visiting the Sands SkyPark but when I saw the structure from the river boat, I couldn't resist going up there for a look. There is a charge of $20 for visitors who are not guests."
,,Impressive Building with views,5.0,,"Impressive design, Go to Restaurant at top. 25 seconds to the 57 floor. Views 360º. Cocktails from $25. Food Average but then you don't have to pay for the View.. Lots of expensive item shops. Walk every where."
,,Nice and quite in a busy city,4.0,,"We could walk on the roof of the Marina Sands Bay shopping mall, it was a nice park as well as the whole complex. The view from then top of the Marina Sands Bay is amazing, especially by night, tough the ticket is a little bit expensive (for non guests only).."
,,"""swim on top!""",5.0,,"I'm afraid of heights all the more i can't really swim!!!..so what are we doing on the 57th floor of MBS?!....it's the experience of it, hell yeah! Singapore skyline is a must see in Asia. Life is short! So fear nothing!"
,,What a place!,4.0,,"The MARINA BAY SANDS SKYPARK is an amazing place and a must see/do. The views are amazing from the edge. It is often crowded with hotel guests and the public. The infinity pool is only for hotel guests. We swam in the pool and enjoyed the views, and as it was a extremely warm and sunny day, it gave us the relief from he scorching sun. I recommend visiting during the afternoons as it is less crowded. Overall an amazing,clean and cool place."
,,Worth Visiting,4.0,,We went up to the Sky Park but not to the floor with the pool. Pool is only for guests and can be seen from the Sky Park level anyway. Well worth the effort and the entry fee.
,,Don't spend the money,5.0,,Unless you can jump in the water and snap a picture. So not worth it. YOu need to stay there to swim in the pool to get that amazing photo. Other than that the hotel is a tourist trap. With zero customer service.
,,Why?,2.0,,"I'm still asking myself why I spent my money to go there. The view is nice, but not exceptional: one of the highlights of Singapore' skyline is the Marina Bay Sands, and of course being at the top of it you can't see it. It is just a platform with glass fences. There are better places to go in Singapore..."
,,over crowded swimming pool,3.0,,"I didnt get into the pool but saw the crowd that was there. you cant really swim but just sit and relax. There was strong wind in the sky park. the ambience of the resturant was good, didnt taste the food, so cant comment."
,,What a view!,4.0,,"The Sands Sky park was well worth the visit, with an incredible view over the city. The extra benefit of visiting this attraction was the walk through the hotel lobby area, WOW! Very easy to get to via the MRT with the station situated just under the hotel concourse area."
,,A MUST!,5.0,,"I mean, cmon... A pool at the roof? Just the idea of it a must-go. However, you must be a hotel guest to enter the poolside area. This is not available to the public. Enquire with the lobby staff before entering."
,,What a View,5.0,,"A must do if staying at the Marina Sands Hotel and if not pay the $20 to experience it. The Pool, facilities and veiws will blow you away."
,,Worth the Cost!,5.0,,"The 360 degree Views of the entirety of Singapore and its harbour is worth the $20 ($17 for Seniors). One can also purchase food and/or drinks up there! (And one can ""glimpse"" the rooftop pool of the Marina Bay Sands hotel) A Very Enjoyable expenditure!"
,,Not value for money!,3.0,,"For $20 per adult, I believe Singapore Flyer has better value as the result will be the same - panoramic view of Singapore CBD and some sea view. Alternatively, dine in one of the restaurant or stay in the hotel to enjoy the free visit. I definitely will not visit the attraction again in future unless is free."
,,Too much loud music,3.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, so this was included in our deal. The pool was fantastic and of course the views were spectacular.

What spoiled it for me was the loud music, which was incessant. I couldn't get away from it in the garden areas where the monotonous beat intruded on my consciousness when I was trying to read a book, so I retreated to my hotel room.

My husband loved swimming in the infinity pool and, if you liked the music, then it would be 5* for me too."
,,Well worth paying for that view!,5.0,,"I paid the extra to go up to the pool area. It was good and for the small amount more it was worth it but wouldn't bother paying it again. I would just go to the cocktail bar instead up there and you'll see the same thing.

The view at the sky park is jaw droppingly beautiful. I went during the day, next time I'll go at night and yes there will be a next time."
,,Not worth it for a family,2.0,,"$94 dollars for a family of 5 but it was not worth it.
No family pass
No where to sit down, unless you spent money at the bar.
Only allowed into one cornor of the deck.
It was very hazy when we went up so the view was vey minimal.
We only spent about 15 minutes at the top in the end.
The actual mall below was far more interesting."
,,Worth the $20 for sky deck,4.0,,The sky deck has fantastic views and you can see over to the roof pool for the people to poor to stay at the hotel its self. We lashed out and had a drink at the bar witch was very costly but well worth it. The hotel is amazing and well worth a look around and you get a great birds eye view of the gardens by the bay witch is just a short walk away.
,,Amazing Views,4.0,,"Must visit when in Singapore the structure is amazing and the views are incredible, some nice restaurants and although a bit pricey still worth a visit"
,,Great views,4.0,,Loved sitting here taking in the sights and the people Had a drink on a Saturday night and watched an air show that seemed just about on our level. We loved t
,,Worth getting a drink in the SkyBar,4.0,,"Great view of the city and a very cool place to hang out. You have a choice of either paying about $20 to just get to the top and walk around, or, if you walk back inside the hotel and ask for the SkyBar itself, you can have a drink/food overlooking the city and the pool without having to buy the $20 ticket. Much more a memory than great cuisine and definitely worth it!"
,,Visit for the night view of Singapore,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands is the most iconic structure in the Singapore skyline. I was there in July,12 and it was the 3rd time... The entry fee is SGD 20, a bit steep in my opinion and does nt include access to the infinity pool and 2/3 of the skypark. That part is reserved for the hotel guests.

At the observation deck, the best time to b is after dark, when the whole city lights up. You can catch the Singapore flyer and F1 track on one side and the Clarke Quay and other high rises on the other. The recent most attraction is to observe the lights show tht happens next to LV building. If i recall correctly, the show happens on weekend nights only.

Its a treat to be there for n enjoi a fantastic view of Singapore!!"
,,Best view in Singapore,5.0,,"My partner and I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands, so naturally, visits to the Sky Park were complimentary. Nevertheless, the views were staggering. We just loved it. We visited a few times with our favorite being at night. On a clear night, with a light breeze, it's wonderful. And might I add, romantic. A must visit for any traveler to Singapore."
,,Way too busy,1.0,,"This place was teaming with human life at all hours. Nowhere to sit, wet towels, the pool full of bobbing heads. Hey, I don't mind sharing but this was not a nice experince. Would be a pain to implement but think it needs a booking/ticket system."
,,Better view from the bottom,3.0,,"Make sure that the day you go up to the Skypark there's a good visibility otherwise you'll be disappointed.

I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would especially when I went down to the Marina outside the shopping centre. At 8 pm there's a water show, breathtaking. and the view of the commercial centre is also stunning.

My advice, save the $20 and stay downstairs for the laser and water show at 8 or 9:30 pm, each day."
,,Top of the World,5.0,,"Fantastic views all round. well organised and presented. time was short but will be returning for another visit. The lift reaches the 57 floor in less that forty seconds , wow that is moving but is so silky smooth."
,,Absolutely Perfect.,5.0,,"Great view, great amenities, great pool, great bar (although Ku De Ta closed at 12mn), great pictures.. everything was great! I loved it! :)"
,,Good views,4.0,,"It is a bit on the expensive side at S$20 to get to the observation deck but you can get some great views. Another option is to get a pass to the restaurant. You will still pay around S$20 for almost the same view but you do get a nice glass of beer to drink included in the price, plus a nice table to sit down at and maybe order some food."
,,The roof of Singapore,4.0,,"Can see the CBD of singapore and beyond from the tip of the ship shaped roof of the Marina bay sands, a giant hotel in the Marina Bay. It was a magnifificient view no one should miss but it is a bit expensive - S$ 20 per adult."
,,Great Gardens!,4.0,,"It was great to see the gardens from our view and at night, it was so much well lighted and beautiful."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The views are fantastic, Cheaper than the Singapore Flyer. Cost $20 per person which included a tour to the top, a bottle of water and a refresher towel. Well worth it."
,,Perfect view,5.0,,Simply a great location and a stunning view. A Must-See for everybody (unless you can't stand heights).
,,Restrictions...,1.0,,"Unless is a hotel guest, else, paying to go up, not worth the money, compare Taipei 101, much better in terms of view and service (esp Taipei101 comes with explanation in different language)"
,,Stunning views,5.0,,"Well worth the effort and 20 SD fee for the lift up, the view from the top is stunning, there is a cafe at the top but was booked for a function when we were there."
,,Well worth a visit.,4.0,,Really enjoyed the views from the top. We didn't think it was very clear to find your way to get to the top but once up there it was lovely.
,,View is okay and experience with Kudeta Restaurant,3.0,,"Twice time going to Sands Skypark for 2 different occasions within 2 months in July & Aug. The view was just okay, but not superb ones. I think I was put more attention to the building and really admire the architecture of The Marina Bay Sands hotel from outside than the view of Skypark itself. However, still this place is a must visit place if you are going to singapore. Pay for SGD 20 / pax for entry ticket.

How to get there ?
by MRT - allign at Bayfront station (circle line / orange line ) from anywhere and easily follow the sign to Sands Sky Park.

by bus if you are from USS / Sentosa / Resort World, you can hop on to free shuttle bus
by showing your passport and just say that you will allign at Marina Bay. From the shuttle bus stop at Marina Bay, walk to your left and follow the pathway until you see a glass wall with big label Sands Skypark. Then go down with elevator then buy the entry ticket.

by taxi water - suggestion itinerary is : morning photo stop at Merlion then from Merlion directly hop on the water taxi ( pay SGD 4 ) and allign at pier at The Museums (see the building that like giant white flower), enter The Shoppes mall then follow sign to Sands Sky Park. Basically you will be directed to Tower 3 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel (There's 3 tower at Marina Hotel).

There's Kudeta restaurant at Skypark, but, a feedback must be given to them as I'm not too convenient with the way they welcoming guest if only buy for drinks instead of lunch or dinner. We're not allowed to sit on the sofa as the sofa is just for people who will having lunch or dinner so we're only able to sit on the wooden chair. Understand about the policy and by the time we arrived it was a lunch time, but still wondering what's the different of sofa and wooden chair as both are in the same place, near each other."
,,Great View,5.0,,"Costs $20SD to get to the 56th floor. It was a clear but very hazy day. But, did get a lot of great photo's of the area that turned out OK, not great, when I loaded them on my computer but not Sky Parls problem, it was the haze. The view was well worth the $29SD"
,,Great view of Singapore,5.0,,What architecture. It's an amazing design inside and then you get the lift to the 57th floor and the world opens out. You get spectacular views as far as the eye can see and you can get a nice refreshing drink to chill out with and take it all in
,,A full view of Singapore,5.0,,Go through tower three of Marina Bay Sands Hotel at sunset and you will have a full view of Sinapore at its best. At 8 pm there is also a lazer/ music show for about 15 minutes which is spectacular.
,,magnificent architectural design,5.0,,"I am awed by this magnificent, expensive, gigantic, wonderful architectural masterpiece. So awesome to behold especially night time. Looking down was a great experience where you can see all the lights of the city at night."
,,See the views and pool free from Ku De Ta Bar on the roof.,5.0,,Incredible views will take your breath away. Number 1 must do thing while in Singapore. It's worth the price of a slightly pricey drink while you take in the magnificent view at night.
,,One of a kind.. worth the fee paid,5.0,,"For a chance to see the Infinity pool, the spectacular view of the Singapore Skyline and the Marina bay as well as the New Gardens by the Bay. Well worth the entrance fee and try to visit at dusk so you see far as well as wait for the night view."
,,Dizzy-ing Heights,5.0,,Terrific way to see Singapore and for some reason we managed to get up to the Sky Park for free (usually S$20 each) which was an added bonus!
,,Top of the world,5.0,,"Well, what can I say, aside from feeling that you're on top of the world... you can basically see the whole of singapore so what's not to like? Its quite an experience and good venue if you like taking photos!"
,,"Sands SkyPark, nothing to see there!",2.0,,The amount we paid for the entrance ticket was not worth it. There's nothing to see up there. It's much better to ride the Singapore Flyer to see a great view of Singapore than to go at the 56th floor of Marina Bay and see nothing!
,,Great Views of the City,3.0,,"This is a great observation deck 56 floors off the ground. From above, you can see a lot of attractions, the Theaters by the bay, the Gardens by the bay, The ArtScience Museum. Even the Merlion. However, there is no place to sit down and it can get exhausting especially in the afternoon what with the sweltering Singapore weather and all.

A little footnote: The Singapore Flyer is an observation deck too and is in the same vein as the Skypark. I would suggest choosing just one of these to save time, energy and money."
,,Great view from the best hotel,4.0,,This hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels and sites in Singapore and cannot be missed. Costs $20 to get to the skydeck.
,,Singapore flyer is a better option,2.0,,Skypark is over rated. If viewing the city your plan then do it with the Singapore Flyer. Flyer gives you a better experience than to just standing on the terrace of a random skyscraper and viewing the city. You pay 9SGD extra for the flyer but you experience much more. So choose well.
,,Stunning views of the city,4.0,,"I had long desired to see this structure (Marina Bay Sands) up close and personal for a while now, being a lover of architecture, and decided that the experience was not complete without a trip to the infamous SkyPark.

Perhaps it was the blistering heat of the Singaporean afternoon, mixed with fatigue from checking out Gardens by the Bay, but I felt a little underwhelmed at first. There are no places to sit, so if you intend to stay for awhile, be prepared to stand. Likewise, those hoping to get up close and personal with that beautiful infinity pool will be disappointed. You can look, but from a distance as the SkyPark is separated from that area.

Still, the views up there are breathtaking, and most likely are even more so at sunset/evening. Like the Empire State Building, Tokyo Tower, or any other highrise with an observatory, this spot provides beautiful views of the city."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Wow! The view is just amazing. Pick out all the landmarks, watch the traffic below, overlook the new gardens."
,,Brilliant for photos if you are happy to pay £10,3.0,,...but there is little else up there apart from a pricey restaurant. Was a little tough to find but it's by tower 3 at the very end with the entrance 1 flight below ground level.
,,A must to do in Singapore,5.0,,"This is new and is brilliant. The design is clever braid appeal for young and old, the person behind this concept should be congratulated as it fills what was an empty space so brilliantly.
There are 2 parts to see on clued on your entry pass flowers / plants from around the world and the forest meets the sea both are amazing Excellent Value."
,,Very Cool,5.0,,Fantastic 380degree views. Very busy most of the time but it's a must see. Excellent fine dining (Sky57) and bar restaurant (Ku de Ta).
,,"Great view, full stop",3.0,,"You certainly get a great view from up there.
But there, absolutely no atmosphere. The platform itself is fairly bare and sterile, as is the location which is quite disconnected to the rest of Singapore.
There is one cafe up there which is expensive and apparently indifferent to iits customers."
,,Amazing View,4.0,,"Awesome view from the top, and well worth visiting just for the experience. It can get a bit busy though so be prepared that!"
,,A thrilling view,5.0,,"Nothing is free in Singapore, not even the lifts to get to the top of the bizarre Bay Sands complex. We had a drink in the viewdeck bar and were truly astonished. At a price."
,,Fantasic views,4.0,,"Nice views of the cdb and the whole island, make sure you carry small kids in your hand once you approach the counter for payment so you can save $12."
,,If only for the fantabulous views...,5.0,,"Access to this is open only to folks who are visiting the restaurants or are guests of the Marina Bay Sands. We managed to visit as guests of some relatives who were staying at the hotel.

Incredulous views from the top, especially on a clear day, you could probably see at least 10 km away. It also helps that there are no buildings close by the hotel, so the downtown skyline looked great. And you can take a walk around the entire park to get the full experience.

Restaurants are pricey but you get what you pay for. But I think the highlight has to be the infinity pool. Gets really crowded at certain times of the day, so go early to stake out the best deck chairs. There's also a small kid's pool in the corner."
,,Fabulous Experience,4.0,,"Not cheap for the lift ride but the wow factor is all there! Views forever and you can take your time, no pressure to move on. Drink prices border on the ridiculous but you've got to have one to take in the atmosphere. When you get your photo taken, there's a bill coming if you want a pic - just be aware. My thoughts are OK, if you are offered a digital image."
,,worth it,4.0,,"Definitely worth going to the Sands Skypark. I think the admission fee to the observation deck was about $20 (AUD) at the time, but worth it once you see the amazing views of Singapore below.
There is a souvenir shop on the observation deck and also a couple of bars/restuarants too (not sure what they are like, as we didn't go in)."
,,Incredible view,4.0,,Provides an incredible view of Singapore. Well maintained area. Prices at the shop were exorbitant though.
,,Restaurant,5.0,,"Loved the location of that restaurant, can't remember the name but it's on top of the Sands, food is good and the views are amazing! Waiters/Waitresses are nice too. Will definitely go back!"
,,9th Wonder of the World,5.0,,This 54 floor sky park has to be seen in Singapore with a swimming pool and some great restaruants but only if you are staying at the hotel. If you are not staying you are only allowed on the viewing deck and one restaruant.
,,Fantastic views,5.0,,We were lucky enough to stay at MBS just before we left Singapore after our two year stay. We enjoyed sharing the pool and sky deck with friends. It's the best spot in town to view the Singapore skyline.
,,Good for first time,4.0,,The Sand Sky Part is woth visiting in the evening but due to time constrain we visited it in the afternoon which proved quite tiring due to the heat.
,,Nice view,5.0,,"Nice view, nice bar. Very relaxing view. I ordered my favorite Singapore sling. Too many people although we went there Saturday night."
,,Great view of Singapore,4.0,,"SInce the Sands is across the bay from most of Singapore, the SkyPark affords a great panoramic view of the city and sea.

It is somewhat expensive, especially since the ""park"" aspect of it is only viewable via guided tour. For most people, it's just an observation deck. But it's a well-located one and worth the cost, in my opinion.

Earlier in the day is better, since the afternoon sun makes viewing the city more difficult."
,,A place with a view,5.0,,The sky park is a beautiful place for couples and family alike. There is a chocolate buffet that is pretty decent. Do bring a shawl along as it can get quite windy up there.
,,Must visit!,4.0,,"OK, we gave it a try and it was worth a visit. We enjoyed the magnificent views of the whole city which was not possible from anywhere else. The architecture must be great to do such a handsome work! Costs a little but worth to pay for it as you won't get similar from anywhere else!"
,,So high suffered verigo!!!,3.0,,"Went up for a drink, that way you don't have to pay to view and so glad I didn't pay as I was soon back down. Have been up the twin towers in NY and it didn't bother me, but suffered vertigo for the first time in my life at Sands Skypark. Not a good feeling at all :("
,,Marina Baysand SkyPark is Awesome,5.0,,"You can see F1 track, Merlion Statues, espalane, singapore flyer, Bay Garden and entire Singapore Island from up here."
,,excellent views,5.0,,"Seems a bit wierd at first u have to pretend you are going to the Kudeta bar, the u can sneak into the skypark once there."
,,Stunning views,5.0,,Amazing views over the city and well worth the entrance fee. Dont forget your camera. We felt it was a much better experience than the Singapore Flyer.
,,Wow,5.0,,"Splendid view over the city and its incredible skyline. A must, not to be missed! I visited it by night, it's magic."
,,Perfect! Just perfect!,5.0,,"I am in love with marina bay pool.
It's incredible, by far the best infinity pool I ever saw (and I saw quite a lot, I am a bit of a freak over infinity pools, they are one of my favorite things ;) ).
I was NOT a guest, but I got invited in by hotel guests so I entered with no problem and legally (no sneak in... if you can make it I'll be so impressed because right now security is better than the white house :O ).
I drunk a cocktail, and it was 18 S$... but yeah, what could I expect there? It was fancy, tasty and no complains. This is an experiemce that is a MUST once in your life. Singapore without this pool would have been HALF as beautiful."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,Well worth the money! The views from here are amazing. Even though it was drizzling (you get your money back if the weather is terrible and you were up less than 1 hour) you will be amazed by the extend of Singapore and its views.
,,MUST SEE!!,5.0,,"Spent the evenings in the pool and watched the sunset - WOW, really a lifetime experience - jump in the hot spa pools and look out over the Bay!!"
,,Breathtaking Marinabay Sands Hotel.,5.0,,Pool on the 57 floor is simply breathtaking with it's edgeless feel. The view from the Skypark is out of this world.
,,Amazing building & great views,4.0,,"Great views of the city, the newly opened Gardens by the Bay, and on a clear day all the way to Malaysia. Go around 6pm, enjoy the views during daylight and the night lights from 7ish, then grab dinner at one of the many eateries at Marina Bay Sands and head over to the riverside for the free light show.
The SkyPark would be even more impressive if there were information boards and free binoculars, like many other tall landmarks I've visited. And sadly there is no seating unless you have a reservation at the restaurant... I felt very sorry for some elderly visitors who had to sit on the floor - come on Singapore, surely you can spring for some wooden benches, especially when you charge $20/person entry fee???"
,,Is Wonderful,5.0,,Sands sky Park is a must place to visit in Singapore for those who choose not to stay in Marina Bay Sands hotel!!! :) Full Singapore is clear view from there! during night time is very romantic!!!
,,Great view of Singapore's CBD skyline,4.0,,"Like what many have already mentioned, great view to see if you are not staying at the hotel.

Go before the sunset, to enjoy both day and night view.
Price at $20 per person is very debatable. Some may like it but some may not. So it depends which camp you are in.

If you are a tourist, then why not?? Since you are here once. Enjoy the view, marvel at the sight.
If you are a local, then maybe you would have seen similar view from the other buildings nearby."
,,Fantastic views put flyer to shame,5.0,,"Breathtaking views over Singapore and the bay, which put the Singapore Flyer to shame. At S$20 per head instead of S$28 for the flyer make it a bargain too. The drinks at the bar ludicrously expensive, but this is only to be expected I suppose."
,,Honeymoon trip through Asia,5.0,,The skypark provides a breathtaking view over the whole city. It also has a wonderful restaurant / bar. Combine it with a visit to the Marina Bay shopping mall!
,,Worth the wobbly knees!,5.0,,"This is an outstanding architectural feature in the Singapore skyline and therefore a once in a lifetime required visit. It sits like a giant surfboard straddling three towers over 50 floors up. The S$20 cost for the lift to the top is a bit pricey since all you can do there is take the views and eat at the cafe at the top. But what views. The area is glass surrounded so you never lose that fear of being very, very high up. Worth fitting in to your Singapore trip early on so you can get a fantastic sense of the city layout. And access is very easy, by an MRT station under the whole development. Really amazing for anyone who remembers Singapore back in the 70's because almost everything for miles around has been reclaimed from the sea."
,,"Marina Bay of Sands, Singapore",4.0,,"This place is a must visit. Like some of the previous travelers who gave reviews, the view from the viewing platform which costs $20 only offers views of the surroundings and Gardens By the Bay but not the infinity pool. To see the pool, you have to visit the bar and no fees are charged if you say you want to have drinks at the bar. I only spent 15 minutes up there as there is no place to sit.The architecture is amazing..."
,,Overcrowded pool,3.0,,Great View. Overcrowded. Could do with greater sections. There were just way too many people and so noisy.
,,On top of the world!,4.0,,"Choose your time to visit wisely. I suggest you go shortly before dusk and wait for the sun to set (it goes dark quickly) so you see the magical transformation of Singapore from day to night.

Unlike the Singapore Flyer (which is now dwarfed by the SkyPark), you can stay at the viewing area for as long as you like, enjoy a drink from the bar or even food from the restaurant. There are also free tours available to see the infinity pool at gardens that are part of the hotel."
,,Worth the price!,5.0,,"Even if it's a bit S$20, it's totally worth going up there. The landscape near the Marina Bay is totally wonderful. I went at the end of the day, so I could have the day view, sunset and night view. I spent about 3 hours there.

Only negative thing: no where to seat (even on the ground, if you seat they will tell you to get up, which is...), even at the small bar."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Lots to see in the Marina area.$20 to go up to the observation deck 56 floor.Great view.Got lots of photos.Sound and light show after dark.Go inside to see Hotel,Casino and shopping.A short stroll to Gardens by the bay there Sound & Light show 7.45 free also."
,,A view of the world,5.0,,Only 56 floors up and then take the classic Tytanic photo at the bow of the boat that sits atop 3 huge towers.
,,Fantastic View,4.0,,"The observation deck gives a spectacular view of Singapore. If you are not staying in the hotel you can only look around the very end of the deck, so there isn't really anything to do except look at the view (there is a restaurant too)."
,,UNBELIEVABLE!,5.0,,"The pool, the trees, the infinity pool - 57 stories in the sky.............so awesome! I wish I coulod have stayed longer to experience it for hours!"
,,Limited views not worth the entry fee,3.0,,The Skypark offers amazing views of Singapore. Thats the good part. The problem is that a non-resident's access is limited to only about less than a third of the entire Marina Bay Sands roof (the rest of the roof is accessible to hotel residents). So...More
,,Good experience,4.0,,"Though the price is a little steep the experience was pretty amazing, if the price is set at 20 they should have at least offered complimentary drinks or a souvenir ."
,,Good View,4.0,,"If you love the heights, the view and the cool breeze of wind then this is for you! :) I loved the part where you can take photos and have it printed. It is a romantic place to make a proposal or to unwind and...More"
,,The place to be in Marina Bay,4.0,,This is the reason why you should not avoid a moment in Marina bay. The Skypark offers an amazing view over Singapore. Too bad we can't also use the swimming pool (only for hostel resident)
,,Great city view,4.0,,I think this is a rather good place to come to if you would like to enjoy the scenery and city view. It's a little crowded most of the time so it may be a little hard to take a nice photo without obstructions from...More
,,Have an overpriced drink at the bar; it's free,4.0,,"The drinks at the bar a over the top expensive (like Sangria for $38 for a carafe for two) however you take in the beautiful view happy in the knowledge that it was absolutely free. To go th eobservation deck, it costs $20. If you...More"
,,Excellent view of Singapore from MBS Skypark,5.0,,"Tourists are allowed to go to observation deck on top of Marina Bay Sands for a fee of SGD 20. It offers 3 side view of the city- Gardens by the bay and sea on one side, SIngapore flyer on the other and Singapore river....More"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,The staff were very unfriendly but the excellent overview of Singapore was definitely worth it.
,,INTERESTING,3.0,,A day trip $20 allows you to view from the sky deck - something you would do once.
,,what a view,5.0,,"amazing! If you stay at the Marina Bay Sands, the SkyPark is free. If you would buy a ticket as a tourist, you will only be able to go to the SkyPark, you will not get any access to the Pool area."
,,amazing,4.0,,"I dislike the fact that to enter this place we have to pay a lot.. n that they charged under age kids.. but hey, they have stunning view.. so I guess its ok? :D"
,,Excellent Sky View,5.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Skypark is alive at night. The view is beautiful at night. This place is good for photo taking and the besy place to view city view and garden at the bay.Highly recommended and you won't regret for paying the price of $20.There are few restaurant such as Kudeta and Sky 57.
The infinity pool is very nice and it will be great if members of public able to swim."
,,Sensational View of Singapore,5.0,,"Entry price is reasonable for the view it is really amazing, went at sunset and the place was packed. Drink and food prices at the bar match the height of the building and are waaaay up there (SGD $75 for 1 mixed drink, a beer and 3 soft drinks(ouch)"
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Amazing view and good spot to capture the city. Ticket prices currently cost S$20 and you can spend as much time as you'd like. Note: They don't allow your tripods.
,,The best infinity pool we have ever been too it were great,5.0,,We liked everything about the pool something different
,,INCREDIBLE,5.0,,"The skypark is simply stunning, loved the infinity pool"
,,The view is worth it!,5.0,,"Everything in Singapore is expensive and going to the top of the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel is no exception at $20pp. However, the view is totally worth it! I wish I could have gone in the hotel's infiniti pool too, but it's only for guests :(

I recommend going at dusk; it was a great time to see the city skyline in daylight, then in sunset, then at night! It was nice and breezy up there too. You really get a good view of the whole city: the big buildings, the water & all the big tankers in harbour.

The observation deck at the Marina Bay Sky Park is an absolute must when in Singapore!"
,,Nice View,5.0,,"I love capturing city views. This is one of the best place to capture the Singapore City. I was in Singapore Flyer this moring, but shots from here is the best."
,,Great view,4.0,,A bit pricey but the view is worth the price. Sky on 57 restaurant serves fantastic asian fusian dishes by Chef Justin Quek.
,,"High in the sky, nice view",4.0,,"Nice view and something special, suggest to go at night where it's not too hot. Below is a big shopping mall, you can try your luck in the casino also. There's also a water show at 9pm every night, nothing special but have a view if you're there."
,,I fell in love with singapore,5.0,,the view was amazing... incredible pool.!!!!!! you hav to love it
,,Could be better but well worth a look,3.0,,Pretty pricey to get up there and then you cant really get access to many areas but if you have a spear 30 mins and $20 then pop up it is a great view but be a bit carefull of the $25 beers that they dont even fill to the top.
,,Greatest view over Singapore,4.0,,"The platform on top of the Marina Bay Sands complex provides a 360 degree view over Singapore harbour and city. After a visit there we felt no need to go on the Singapore Flyer, as we were looking on top of it."
,,Sunday Recovery,4.0,,"Spend at bit of time here for the weekend. Every morning was getting food, drinks and swims. Great location, but prices a little expensive"
,,Get a tour spot to see the pool!,5.0,,"Was worth the money as we did the tour. If not I may have been dissatisfied as I had been sipping a Singapore sling in the even higher altitude bar the night before. We went at 9pm and loved the city lights, not sure it would have appealed on a hot day, no seating available.
On the tour you lounge on deck chairs and I even sat on the spa edge and soaked my feet. Was disgustingly jealous of those who were in the infinity pool of course ;-)"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"The Sands SkyPark is worth a visit for the $20 you pay. I was lucky to have visited it when the pool area was still open to public. Now I heard it's cordoned off already to give hotel guests more privacy at the pool. Still, worth a visit as it gives you fantastic views of Singapore."
,,better go to kudeta,3.0,,"better views you get from kudeta bar and you pay what you want , then from kudeta can acces skypark"
,,Great views on a clear day,4.0,,"The views are good, but go on a clear day. Really the view is limited only by the monstrosities of concrete that make up the central city district. Not really the authentic old Singapore, but if you look hard enough you may be able to catch a glimpse of Fort Canning Park and Raffles House now dwarfed by the high rise!
I can't really comment on the laser show at night as I haven't seen it yet"
,,Nice View,5.0,,It was worth to visit skypark. Can see Singapore's skyline.
,,Marina Bay Sands,4.0,,"upgraded to a suite...what a miracle...awesome views,so much room and quiet with access to the infinity pool..yummmm :)"
,,Great view but expensive admission,3.0,,I felt that the $20 admission fee was a little expensive. Nevertheless it was a great view.
,,Boring,3.0,,"More should be done during the ride. It's boring to just stand around looking at the scenery when there could be commentary provided via headphones or the TV available on Singapore's historical sites and landmarks, making use of the view avaialble"
,,very nice view of Singapore city,4.0,,"if you want to have a better view of Singapore city, then I recommend this one. Singapore flyer is smaller that this and this worth a try. not that much expensive to go up but no place to sit up there. only you walk around took some pictures and that's it."
,,View from the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark fantastic,4.0,,Cost was S$20 to take the lift up the 56 storeys to access the Sky Park. Well worth it for the view.
,,An awesome trip if you are looking to try out your camera lenses!,5.0,,"While on business in Singapore, I took som good advice and visited the sky park by my self. The photos and video I took with my phone are worth showing everyone.... The shots on my Nikon are good enough tomake postcards. The Deck is pitched across 3 buildings in the shape of a huge vessel. It's breathtaking to see from a distance, and even better to see up close. The price to go to the top is about 20 bucks, but free if you are a guest in the hotel or dining at the restaurant up there.

Hold on to your hats... Because its windy on the deck. Take your time and stay for a while...there is no time limit..."
,,spectacular view,5.0,,What an outstanding view and experience.Easy to get to and lovely to go right up the top and see right into Malayasia
,,What a view!!,5.0,,"Go in the daytime so you can really see Singapore. The hotel, shopping and casino are unbelievable. If you are afraid of heights don't go too near the glass wall and railing!!"
,,Great,5.0,,"A must do for people who travel to singapore spectacular views of Singapore from one of the largest gravity-defying cantilevers in the world cost is SG 20 peradult. If you are staying in the hotel than its free to visit, i enjoyed the pool the most"
,,Observation Deck,4.0,,"the Lift very fast.. When you reach the deck your activity will be checked, observed,took pictures, and that's all. there is snack booth but quiet expensive, and KU DE TA for fancy dining & Bar.
Better to visit in the late afternoon to evening, you'll get both view of sun down and evening lights from the building, flyer, and merlion"
,,A great view but that's about it!,4.0,,If you are looking for a great view then this is it! We spent easily an hour up here just staring at the big city. It costs about $15 Singapore to go up but the view is worth it and better than the Singapore Flyer in my opinion.
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,"Special place, best to go to the bar and savour the sunset with a drink."
,,Excellent view!,5.0,,"This is a must-do in Singapore! The view from the top is amazing, I was left speechless. I didn't visit any other of the towers and viewpoints, so I cannot assure you that this is the best view of the city you can get, but it's worth every dollar!"
,,Great City View of Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to captute the great panoranic view of Singapore city, this is the place to be"
,,Worth a trip just of the view but expensive for what it is,3.0,,"The view from the top of the SkyPark is excellent but it costs 20 SGD (10 GBP ish) and there is a better view from bar at the top of the Swisshotel which is free to get into.

It does give you a slightly different persective of the city however and if you have time and money to spare then it is worth it"
,,Must Do,5.0,,This is fantastic; the whole area is new and has a great vibe; fantastic views of the city and bay with funky bars and restaurants.
,,infinity,5.0,,"We were billeted at the MBS 47th floor, so we had unlimited access to the Skypark.First we checked it out, then the next day, we tried the pool. It was a cloudy day so we enjoyed the swim minus the sun. We also went to the view deck and the view was awesome..."
,,Lovely View from the Top!,5.0,,What can I say? SkyPark is a bit crowded (just like most places in Singapore :P) BUT it is worth a visit! Wait til the sun sets and you will be awed by the view of Singapore at night ;)
,,fantastic view,5.0,,you will get fantastic view but you will not be allowed to even see swimming pool! you have a better option to visit bar on roof top and they have happy hours in the evening. you can have full view of swimming pool and no need to visit observatory!
,,Fantastic Singapore View,4.0,,"Awesome place to view the Singapore City, especially during the night time. So I would recommend those if you want to go, do go during night time. You can see the beautiful light of Singapore City and now you can see the Garden By the Bay.

However, I feel the entrance is quite expensive just for the view(you will not be able to use the infinity pool). If you are the guest of the hotel, you can go up FOC and you may get to enjoy the infinity pool."
,,Love the marina bay view,5.0,,I really liked the view of singapore from a height of 200 metyers above the ground and also while having a swim in the swimming pool there. The skypark has a feel as if you're aboard a ship and the cool breeze which keeps flowing throughout. I liked the pub Ku De Ta which has a decent collection of wines and beers which you can keep sipping and have a chillax time.
,,Define Perfection. Its MBS,5.0,,"Rising above the sea level as high as 54th floor, this Marina Bay Sand Skypark is strategically located in Marina Bay, Singapore.
Considered as the Pride of Singapore, Which is indeed yes, they offer a room ranging from 150SG$(promos) and higher..
Amenities? Nothing you can ask for..
Shop at the high end boutiques of Marina Bay Sands Mall, have a bet at the Casino, Take a stroll into the Olympic walk, dine at their classy restaurants and find youself plunging into the infinity pool at the rooftop..
Have a view of the city lights at night as you swim into their magnificent pool..
have a break. Try MBS ;)"
,,Wonderful View of Singapore,4.0,,"We had good but not excellent buffet breakfast on the skypark after our wedding the previous day. The view of the skypark is superb, but the swimming pool doesnt offers much privacy."
,,Park at 57th floor,5.0,,"Excellent view from the sky park of marina bay sands.
its better option rather then to go for Singapore flyer.
They have made swimming pool on the top (on57th floor)
And view from the top by doing swimming was very very good
They charged 25 $ per person for spending time there.
View from there was very good you can see all the skyline of the Singapore.
ONe must have to go there for excellent view of Singapore."
,,Exceptional views,5.0,,"The SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands is a must see/do. Exceptional views at 190 metres of downtown Singapore. The Marina, Fullerton Hotel, Merlon Statue, Central Business District, Padang, Raffles Hotel, Boat and Clarke Quays, the harbor among others can be seen.

Go here at the end of the afternoon to see a beautiful sundown. You can have a drink or diner upstairs, but prices are steep."
,,Once is enough,3.0,,"The ticket is rather pricey, just a little bit cheaper than the Singapore Flyer. It is actually higher than the top of The Singapore Flyer. Unless you're in a tour access to the infinity pool, you will not have a complete 360 degrees view of Singapore."
,,Great View,5.0,,"liked the long laps,and view, but not much kids friendly facilities such as slides, kickboards, water features. etc"
,,This place is amazing,5.0,,"This has to be the most amazing place, had a drink in the bar on top, noone should miss this the view and pool is spectucular. We thought we would have to pay to go up the top but anyone can go up there you just pay if you want to go to all of the viewing deck. We went to the bar and the view is the same, drinks were expensive 21NZD for a handle of beer but worth every cent for the experience."
,,A good but expensive view,4.0,,"After paying 20 SGD, it was a very good view. But the crowd and the restrictions in not able to visit the other parts of the park (like Swimming pool) is a bummer!"
,,Great views,5.0,,"Perfect place to go, at the top there are fantastic views over Singapore"
,,Worth every penny!,5.0,,"This is one the best attraction to get a good view of Singapore. It cost S$20 and you get a 360 view. This is cheaper, taller and better than 'Singapore Flyer which cost S$30'."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"So the price of admission is rather high, but so is the park. We highly recommend going early and getting tickets to one of the 2-3 free tours so you can see the pool. If you aren't on a tour, you can't see the pool and then you are paying a lot of money to just to walk around the deck of what looks like a ship."
,,Wonderful Views of Spectacular Building,4.0,,The views allow you to see in all direction but the main thrill was to go up into the amazing marina bay hotel building.
,,Expensive but worth it,4.0,,"Like everything in Singapore, overpriced, but definitely worth a look. Amazing views of the South China Sea and the Central Business District from 57 storeys up, plus good restaurants and a decent bar."
,,View at night,5.0,,This is a top of the world experience similar to the empire state building or the Eiffel tower. At night you experience the lights. I don't know what it cost as we entered the lift on the hotel level one floor above the Sky Garden lift entry.
,,Birds Eye View of Singapore,4.0,,Well worth a visit to take in the extraordinary vista of Singapore in all directions. No haze on the day we visited and you could see for miles. Only down side was there were no cafes open or refreshments available.
,,Great bar,4.0,,"If you buy a standard sky park ticket, there's a restaurant and bar that you can go into. Great view of the city from the bar, especially at sunset. Could do with some bar stools though, rather than having to stand up. Also, it's possible to get a free tour of the pool and garden, but these can only be booked on the day and for the first 50 people, so if you're interested in that then get there early (ticket office opens at 9.30am)."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,An out of this world experience. The infinity pool must be one of a kind.
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"We weren't going to visit the SkyPark but the kids talked us into it and I was pleased they did - fantastic views all over Singapore and beyond. It was very hot up there and not much shade so take some sunscreen and a hat. We did purchase some drinks from the small kiosk which also sold a few souvenirs. When purchasing our tickets we were offered the opportunity to return later that evening for a tour of the pool area, however we were unable to take up the offer.

Definitely worth doing - pick a day (if possible) when there's not too much haze in the sky to maximise the distances you can see."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,Go to the 57th Floor and take in the views of Singapore. Amazing sight to behold especially at night. The infinity pool is not to be missed -- great photo moment.
,,wow,5.0,,"awesome place with great view of the city, god range of fod at the park.Best place to spend the late evening if ur staying at the marina bay sands."
,,What a view!,4.0,,If it's a hot day don't plan on staying too long because it gets really hot up there and there is no shade. Excellent near 360 degree view of Singapore. You can see the amazing pool from up there too. Even at S$20 I would at least do it once. Great photo opportunities.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,The view from the Sky Park is amazing and you can see all of Singapore. the Infinity pool and spa (if accessible) is such an amazing/relaxing experience. At least have a drink here
,,Absolutely spectacular view,5.0,,"This is a must-see. Try and go as part of the tour that takes place three times a day so that you can also see the infinity pool because that is really worth seeing. Singapore is a stunning city to view from up above. If you do want to take the tour, call ahead and make sure you get there much in advance of the tour to get tickets as the spots fill up pretty quickly."
,,Breathtaking views,5.0,,Fantastic views! and amazing drinks. Worth the stop!
,,Best views,5.0,,"Anyone coming to SIngapore must do the SkyPark deck at the Marinna Bay Sands Hotel. I have taken friends adn family of mine up theer a number of time and it never disappoints. The view are stunnning accross to Indonesia adn Malaysia and it changes depending on whether you do it during the day or in the evening.
Well recommended"
,,All about the view,3.0,,"The Sands does not really accommodate to those not staying at the Hotel. Paid to go up top during the day adn while the view is nice, there is no shade or seating, just a large timber deck that wraps around the back or the hotel. There is a small kiosk to that sells softdrink, beer and pakets of chips. The Hotel Photographer took nice snaps of the family with our camera and also her own which are avaialbe on the way out. not too impressed with the whole 20mins up there (was very hot) but can say I have been there."
,,We stayed in Marina Bay Hotel .,5.0,,"Swimm at the Top of the World!!! Great feelig , it is like to walk on the sky."
,,Great View.... thats it really,4.0,,Best view in singapore with a great pool as well. but thats it really. Too many ppl there all the time for my liking. Bring a camera and use sunblock days get be really bright and hot. Uhmm nothing else made this visit special
,,WOW,5.0,,"thumbs up: WOW. just go. Thumbs down: $20 to go up, and you can't see the MBS building from up there (as you're on it!)"
,,Magnificient viewa,5.0,,Must go. Never thought SIngap[ore could be so beautiful. But there is charges for non-hotel guest. Each visit cost about S$20 per pax. This is just enytrance fee only.
,,Amazing wonderland perched on top of three spindly-looking towers!,4.0,,"What an engineering miracle this place is. It looks like a curved cruise ship perched on cricket stumps, but when you get up there it's an oasis in the sky!

Truly amazing and worth the S$20 to go up and be amazed at the place and the views."
,,Hard to find but worth the effort,4.0,,"Well we obviously found the Skypark, you can hardly miss it, but it took ages to find out how to get to the top. There was a huge shopping centre, and the signage wasn't that good. We seemed to walk around for hours, and then we had it all in reverse when we got down. When we finally got to the top, we were chatting with a couple of young girls and they too had found it hard to get to the top, so we didn't feel too bad. We went at night, and it was a great view. However, having walked round Singapore all day, it would have been nice if there had been some seating. We went to the bar for a drink, but it was only when we got in, that we found out that you can't sit down there either, squashed, standing room only. Only if you buy a meal can you sit down. We would have done that but it was fully booked -- so - be aware. All in all though, it was worth the visit, it is a fantastic engineering feat."
,,Fantastic view,4.0,,A good time to be there would be at sunset. Amazing skyline. Be sure to have a good camera with you.
,,Park with a view from the 57th floor,5.0,,"Partially open to day visitors, the Sands Sky Park is really the pool area of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Spactacular views, relaxing park areas, resaturants and bars add to the thrill of the huge and inviting rim flow pool."
,,Awesomely Beautiful Place,3.0,,"Went there on Saturday 5pm. The air was humidly hot, the sun is harsh and due to its popularity the place is as crowded as a foodcourt. There is no space to hide from the sun-unless you are the hotel suite guest. Kudeta was also fully booked. Anyway, I have been there, swam there, and will not go there anymore."
,,skypark,3.0,,Fantastic view of Singapore but what i didnt like about it was the photographers
,,Amazing building but just another high view,3.0,,"In fact, I really liked looking at the building more than looking down from it. Its quite expensive just to get a view from the top. You can only access part of the top of the building - the remainder is closed for hotel guests only (which is probably fair enough if you're a guest). The view is spectacular because you are so high. Hold on to your hat if its windy."
,,Arguably the best view of Singapore,5.0,,"The amazing boat shaped structure on top of the three towers of MBS is arguably one of the most iconic pieces of modern architecture from this decade in the whole world. The view is best from the swimming pool but to get there you have to be a hotel guest, the Sky park is already pretty good."
,,Best Pool Ever!!!,5.0,,"Drinks were great, people kids are in a different area, very nice!!! Great Views!!"
,,What a view!,5.0,,"Great 360 view. Enjoyed a lovely glass of Berry Bellini at the top, expensive but worth it!"
,,Dissapointed,3.0,,Great views but pounced on by the photographer for 13 shots! Extremely Expensive. Busy! Instead go to Swisshotel The Stamford for sunset and cocktails on the 69th floor. Stunning.
,,Someone fell from SkyPark,2.0,,"Nice view of Singapore landscape. Read in the local news that a tourist fell from SkyPark and landed on the grass patch: http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_810533.html Now, is it safe? We planned to visit again."
,,"Great, Unblocked, Panoramic View of Singapore",4.0,,"Went up to SkyPark with my family. Everyone enjoyed it. We went near dusk, which is perfect since it is not too hot, and we get the view of Singapore both during the day and during the night! It is fairly windy so do remember to bring some extra clothing."
,,Phenomenal colorful aerial views adjacent to the world's largest outdoor pool,5.0,,"A must-see area for travelers who love colorful scenic aerial views is the Marina Bay skypark. The skypark is located at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The modern architecture of Singapore comes to life as you get to enjoy a pretty illuminated water landscape of the Marina Bay waterfront. On your left you will see the world’s largest outdoor pool at 55 story’s high. The skypark is one of my highlights of the Singapore trip. It is also worth exploring the promenade and if you’ve travelled extensively in Asia Louis Vutton is a common sight; however, this one is known as Louis Vutton Island or Louis Vutton Island maison and is located on the Marina Bay promenade."
,,Nice scenery,3.0,,"It was great scenery of Singapore!
But... i had to pay 20 SGD for only small space for walking...
I thought we'd get a chance to go walk around the garden.
But in fact the garden and pool are for hotel guests only.

I'd like to recommend others to go there before sunset and stay there until sunset,
so you can have both sunset and night view of Singapore!"
,,great view. but just that.,3.0,,"i like the view. dislike the photo session. if it's given for free, it is more suprising."
,,wow,4.0,,Worth going up. You get a fantastic view of Singapore. Next time I would consider having a drink up there with friends.
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Nothing really special, but just a view of the city. If you are checked-in, definitely check it out, worth it! But if you are gonna pay extra bucks to see it, I don't recommend it. You get to see the neighboring hotels and skyscrapers as well as the Singapore flyer."
,,Probably worth the money - great views - and a breeze!,4.0,,"You may think 20 Singapore dollars in a bit steep (if you'll pardon the pun!) to get in a lift and go up 53 floors. But the views were great, there was a lovely breeze up there too. I think it's probably better to do this than the Singapore Flyer wheel, which is actually much lower than the viewing deck on this hotel!"
,,Sands SkyPark,5.0,,Fantstic experience. Great views of Singapore and out to sea. The SkyPark has two modern Bars and a Restaurant which makes the whole experience all the more special. We fully recommend visiting the SkyPark just before sunset so that you get the chance to see the view in daylight and then at nightfall as the Singapore building alight by night is something else.
,,Excellent views,5.0,,"Went to sky park to see the sun set. We chose a day that was bright sunshine saw some fantastic views, then a storm came over then it cleared for the night lights to come on. It is so worth the money to go to the top."
,,"nice view from it, but overcrowded",3.0,,"The hotel is overcrowded with tourists, and so is the SkyPark. I went on a Sunday afternoon, perhaps that explains why. I think there is more hype about this place. Try the restaurant, one floor up. Ku De Ta, you will be able to get great view from dining outside up on top of the world."
,,Mesmerizing pool...and view of the city,4.0,,"The infinity pool on the top of the marina bay sands hotel is an experience in itself...
Though the number of ppl inside and outside the pool will make you wonder if you are on orchard road..
The pool is overcrowded and its not really possible to swim..
its meant to enjoy the singapore skyline i suppose...
But its an architecture marvel and should be visited if ones staying at the hotel.."
,,A nice city view from SkyPark,5.0,,"A nice city view from SkyPark! You can view the city by Singapore Flyer or SkyPark. You can only stay in Flyer 30 minutes but in SkyPark, you can stay as long as you can. :-)"
,,Amazing views on a good day,4.0,,"The views of the whole city and the anchorage are truly spectacular, and the bar is good fun too."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Worth the entry fee, the views of all of Singapore alone is worth double the fee. Grab a drink at the bar and pretend to be a guest of the hotel. Sadly you do need to be a guest to get into the pool (one of the main attractions of this hotel)"
,,Most amazing sky pool,5.0,,"Huge, expansive and with a view to die for. We sipped sangria and watched the sun set over Singapore city. It was like a dream."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"We stayed in Marina Bay Sands hotel, and spent most of our time at the SkyPark.
Even if you are not staying the hotel, I would highly recommend a visit, as it is a architectural wonder how that pool, garden and restaurants all sit on top of that building so beautifully.
Staying at the hotel will allow you to swim in the pool, but a paid visit will let you wander around the Skypark in a group, and take photos.
A must do in Singapore!"
,,SHAKING !!!,2.0,,"I felt a vibrating feeling in my legs,at some parts of the Skypark,this may be due tothe suspended nature of the structure.the stay was not very comfortable. Took the guided to the Infinity swimming pool ,it was interesting,but too much regulated."
,,Amazing view,4.0,,Great to go up the to 57th floor and enjoy the amazing view and the great bars there. Not cheap but who cares...the feeling up in the clouds will make up for it.
,,Pool is not allowed if you are not staying at that hotel,3.0,,"We wanted to enter the pool we had seen in the pictures before,but we were not allowed. No rooms were available so we stayed somewhere else. We were disappointed even though the view was perfect from the top. I wish we had been able to pay and swim there..."
,,Too crowded,3.0,,Lots of people in pool area and the Observation Deck. Recommended time for visit - till 10 O'clock in the morning. The water in the pool is too cold to stay in.
,,Fantastic views of the CBD of Singapore,4.0,,"The infinity pool is the highlight here but if you are not a hotel guest, you will not be allowed to the pool. Otherwise, great view.

Tip:
1. For those who intend to snap lots of photos, please note that you are not permitted to bring tripods up. Otherwise, keep taking as much photos as you wish!
2. If you intend to visit this place along with the Art&Science Museum just situated in the same area, you can buy a combination ticket which is cheaper than buying two separate tickets. (check whether they still offer the tickets because they may not always offer it on special occasions)"
,,Good View,5.0,,"It's a tourist attraction where you have to suck up the thought of paying 10 per person to visit a rooftop. It is an architectural feat (highly recommend that you watch the documentary on the construction of the towers) and gives perfect photo taking opportunities.

The one thing lacking is that it is named sky park however there are no benches, seats or greenery on the viewing platform to relax and take in the view - the sun is hot!

You can have a drink at one of the restaurants and use the receipt to access the viewing platform instead of paying the fee. We did this at Kudeta, one cappuccino was 12.00SGD and cocktails are priced between 15.00 to 20.00 SGD - although we paid more it was good to sit down and relax before going to the viewpark."
,,Great View,4.0,,"Great view from the Sky Park; the price a little steep though (but hey, if people will pay it, you may as well charge it). They need a little shade up there so visitors can temporarily escape the sun/heat during the visit. The cynic in me says that the absence of shade is to promote a fate turnover of visitors."
,,Open it up some more,4.0,,"The views are great, better than the Eye, but at S$20 per head, only allowing access to the small area is a bit disappointing."
,,amazing views,4.0,,"did not do the tour, would be good to know a little more about the direction you are looking at ie: menu board"
,,Great place....,3.0,,One of the best place to visit but.... the charge for taking the family photo is outrageous... People will buy the photo if the price is lower...
,,A 360-degree view of Singapore,4.0,,"Sands SkyPark is located at Marina Bay Sands - the closest MRT station to the hotel is the Bayfront MRT. The entry tickets to the observation deck are priced at SG$20 each and can be bought at the SkyPark Box Office located at B1 Tower 3.

Tip 1: There are 3 guided tours scheduled for 10am, 2pm and 9pm. We took the 10am tour, the registration for which starts at 9.30am - each guided tour is restricted to only 50 visitors and therefore it makes sense to get to the ticket counters a clear half hour before tour starting time.

Tip 2: The big deal about catching the guided tour is that you have about 30 minutes access to view the poolside area, otherwise accessible only to the hotel's guests.

Tip 3: Its best to avoid the temptation of having your souvenir snap taken - billed as the 'SkyPark Photo Experience', it just isn't worth the additional cost of SG$30 (more if you want it framed in leather!) - having done it, am quite convinced it is the most expensive way of getting a lousy snap. You might as well get your own snaps on the observation deck - chances are they will be a whole lot better!

Sands SkyPark Public Observation Deck, located on the 56th level is open to the public daily from 9:30am -10pm Monday to Thursday and 9:30am -11pm on Friday to Sunday.

Tip 4: However there are times when the observation deck is closed to the public on account of private events being held there - so its best to check the hotel website to make sure that the deck will be open on the date and time that you plan to visit.

If you have made sure to be on time to make the guided tour, then you can go on up to the Sands SkyPark at the 57th level which features a breathtaking 150 metre long infinity pool set on top of the world's largest cantilevered platform. One envied the guests in the pool who looked like they were swimming in the clouds at the edge of the world! But here's a thought - how can one not be nervous when swimming at the edge of the world?

The three hotel towers are in fact crowned by Sands SkyPark. In addition to the pool, this oasis in the sky is bedecked with lush greenery, beautiful gardens, and boasts of restaurants like Sky on 57 and KU DÉ TA Restaurant.

Tip 5: Your best photographs are going to be at the 56th level Public Observation Deck which offers a stunning 360-degree view of Singapore. (that's because with one side of SkyPark occupied by the pool to which only hotel guests have access, only the garden side of SkyPark is available for taking snaps even if you make the guided tour.)

Every iconic landmark of Singapore including new ones under development such as Gardens by the Bay (scheduled to open in June 2012) is on show from the observation deck - that this offers amazing photo opportunities is a huge understatement.

Quite clearly the highlight of the Sands SkyPark experience is having your head in the clouds even as you take in the splendours of Singapore quite literally laid out at your feet!"
,,Sky Park,3.0,,"The view from Sky Park was great. As the crowd is unregulated, too many where there when we visited it. The entry tickets are expensive and it is single entry only. They dont allow you to visit the swimming pool area."
,,Magnificent views from top,4.0,,We loved the view/s from the top and tried to spot many of Singapores Landmarks when above. Those taking strollers kindly note that the stroller has to be folded when on top...at least that's what we were told and so our sleepy boy had to walk all along. The other half of the skypark has a huge swimming pool ( belonging to the hotel) and so one cannot walk right round for a 360 degree view. We took some pictures and also bought some pictures of us as a souvenir although they were quite expensive.
,,Justin Quek!! Still delivering good food and sympathy,4.0,,We dined at Sky on 57....perfect balance! His dishes are just elaborate enough to satisfy the palate. Excellent atmosphere and a great Chef that is down to earth and takes his time with his customers.
,,Better views,4.0,,This is not cheap at SGD20 each but worth it for the views which are better than form the flyer. There is an optional tour which gives access to the park & pool areas (usually guests only) which would be worth it if you don't mind having to go at a set time
,,Amazing view at Night,4.0,,Well worth the trip upstairs . Great at night to take some pictures and to see all of Singapore.
,,Swimming pool on top,4.0,,"Expensive, high class place. Cool ambience and the pool is amazing. Scenery here is very nice, worth coming."
,,Charge to visit a roof top?,4.0,,"The view is great, but should we really be charged for that? It cost 20SGD to go to the top, just to look out the roof top. Really? I mean its great, but why charge to visit a roof top. Or at least charge it reasonably. Too steep if you consider families visiting together. But yes, the view is great. And thats all you get."
,,Worth a visit but pricey,3.0,,Your best off saving the $SD20 and going to the KU De Ta bar for a drink (subject to availability)
,,Worth the trip,5.0,,What a view! next time I come I will stay at the hotel to enjoy the pool
,,Fabulous views,4.0,,Fabulous structure that is worth a visit for the great views. It does cost $20 to go up in the lift. Restaurant etc up the top is really expensive and there isnt much shade up there on a scorching hot day. Worth the visit.
,,Stunning views of Singapore,5.0,,"We love going to the SkyPark for special evenings or to take visitors. Amazing views of the harbor and over to Indonesia on one side, and stunning views of the CBD and surrounding Singapore from the other side. Sky On 57 is a wonderful restaurant for celebratory dinners (though service has room for improvement) and the Ku de Ta is a great place for afternoon drinks."
,,You just can't miss this,5.0,,It's an out of the world experience. The sight from the 57th floor is breathtaking the least. If you get a chance to take a dip in the Infinity pool you have experienced a worldly experience. Do not miss making a trip to the Skypark and also checkout the Bay Garden and Laser show near Sands
,,Birdeye view of the city!,4.0,,Great view of Singapore! One of the best thing to do when you only have a few hours in the city!
,,"Nice view, but I preffer Singapore Flyer",3.0,,"Entrance is 20 $SGD and view is wonderfull, Personally, I preffer the view from the Singapore Flyer since you can see all the city around your. In Sands Skypark you just see one part of the city."
,,Best when enjoyed with a Singapore Sling!,4.0,,"Even though you have to pay $20 SGD to get up there, it'll be worth it! The SkyPark offers breathtaking views of Singapore. You can literately see almost the entire city! Don't forget to hit the bar and enjoy a Singapore Sling. The drinks can get expensive (~$20 SGD) but would be well worth it with the view."
,,wow!,4.0,,Incredible view of Singapore! Infinity pool was realy cool.
,,Fantastic view,5.0,,If you want to get an amazing view of Singapore this is the place to go. Breathe taking.
,,beautifull view,5.0,,"Beautifull view and pool, very nice night scenery,unforgettable experience."
,,one of the wonders of Singapore,5.0,,"The new Marina Sands is a stunning hotel, and one of it 's most unusual features is the rooftop Sky Park that spans all three towers. The park 's best feature is the immense infinity pool hundreds of feet above Singapore, but there are also 36 restaurants on the park and throughout the hotel, and fantastic views over all of Singapore."
,,Only for Hotel residents !,1.0,,"I was halted by a Security guy outside the Tower 1 57th Elevators door. Without Room key, you can only access a very expensive Restaurant. very short stay upstairs, Very upset. Does not worth the trip !"
,,hot,3.0,,HOT HOT HOT!! try to avoid to go in day time as the sun will melt u down! n i personnaly think its isnt worth for hte money
,,Disclaimers galore,3.0,,"Too commercialized and they don't allow full 360 degrees view. Guided tour to swim pool and gardens is only at night 9pm. Yes, the view is lovely but the staff is indifferent and more interested in clicking photographs and selling them at a bombshell price."
,,A must-visit in Singapore,5.0,,"Certainly a ""must-visit"" venue for the wonderful view of the Singapore cityscape. Some info to better enjoy the Skypark:

1) Best time to visit : 5pm onwards
2) Bring camera tripod for the great night scenery
3) Even best time to visit: on 2-3 months preceding the National Day (9 Aug) on weekends - might catch the National Day rehearsals from the SkyPark (including fireworks)
4) Ideal time to spend : 1-2 hours (it's S$20/adult, maximise on the fee)
5) Depending on crowd level, access may be granted to view the SkyPool (but blinds have been installed to provide privacy hotel guests in pool.
6) If you have to choose between The Singapore Flyer or The SkyPark....choose the SkyPark!
7) Have a souvenir pic at the Skypark souvenir booth. Great for memories.
8) Just go...don't hesitate."
,,Well worth the price of admission!,5.0,,"Spectacular view from the top. It wasn't as crowded as I expected, and we could watch the laser light show going on below. Good bird's eye view of the city (higher than the Flyer, although that's good, too)."
,,So so......,2.0,,"This was probably one of our least favorite activities on our recent holiday in Singapore. As previous reviewers have noted for your $20 you have limited access to the Skypark, and so it is basically a very expensive look out. The views are certainly fantastic and there are some great photo opportunities, so I guess if that is your prime goal, you will enjoy this. However we found this to be crowded and not our 'cup of tea'. Additionally, I personally found the height bit challenging so if you aren't a heights person, avoid this like the plague!"
,,Fantastic View of the City,5.0,,What is great is the fantastic view of the skyline from the Skypark especially at night time. Ku De Ta is a nice restaurant at the Skypark and great place for celebrating anniversaries and the like. An area in Skypark can be used for private and corporate events. Truly a must visit when you are at the Marina Bay Sands
,,I wouldn't go there if I wouldn't stay at the hotel.,3.0,,If you don't stay at the hotel then you have no access to the pool or facilities so you just go there for the view.
,,Love the view,5.0,,"Wow what can I say what a fabulous view from up here. The only problem I had is when I knew I was no longer standing on a bit that had a building underneath it, the overhang if you like. I just felt so unsafe and how those people swim right up to the edge is beyon me!

My 10 year old loved it, she was over at the edge taking all the pictures, well worthe the $20 we paid but that was April 2011."
,,Sky View,5.0,,Perfect location for chilling with one of teh best views in SG.
,,Sands SkyPark,5.0,,One of the highest places I have ever visited and the view was spectacular. If in Singapore make this a must to visit.
,,Spectacular Sands Sky Park,5.0,,Liked - the views were spectacular; admission price ($20SD) was great value. Disliked - the heat; more shade shelter needed.
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"Very impressive place to visit. Great view. Loved it. Just be aware that you will only get access to the overhang area at the tip, the rest is for hotel patrons only. You won't be able to use the pool."
,,Was great before....,3.0,,I went to the Skypark a few times back in 2010...come now and the park is now closed to guests only. All you get now is views of the cateleivered part. Still good but I seen better times...
,,was okay,3.0,,"would be better if there were less people in the pool, the more crowded the pool just make it looks cheap"
,,Changed after a year,3.0,,"In January 2011 you were able to visit the area behind the horizon pool where there were trees and little water features. In March 2012 that was no longer an option.

It's sort of overrated for what it is. The bar with no surprise was more than double the price of what drinks are.

Would recommend either staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel to enjoy the full experience or just ride the Singapore Flyer"
,,What a view!!,5.0,,What a view !!!! A must visit if not just once. Obviosly its THE landmark of Singapore now. The infinity pool is simply outrageous and also worth the one visit.
,,What a view!,4.0,,"Fantastic view and for free. Sometimes the bar area gets ""full"" and they don't let people up. Even scruffily dressed Women seem to always be allowed up to the lounge/club area, whereas men in short trousers are refused with various excuses. I don't like the policy - discriminating against men - basically guys, where long trousers!

Anyway, the view is great and you can buy souvenirs and pictures of yourself up there. This is a must visit spot for sunset!"
,,"Crowded, noisy and too flashy",3.0,,It was nice to see the view of the Singapore City but there were so many children splashing in the pool it spoiled the experience for us. And having to pay for a view and also pay for very expensive mineral water just adds insult to injury. Not recommended
,,Roof top oasis,5.0,,One of a kind. Swim to the edge of the pool than stroll on the visitor deck and mingle with day visitors as well have have sunset drinks at the bar.All with the background of the city over your shoulder
,,Even if you are afraid of heights.... Go Up,5.0,,"The lift booking was efficient but quite expensive...or so I thought... until we went up.
The 360 degree views were worth every penny.
Go late afternoon, so that you can get good daylight photos, but stop long enough to watch the transformation into dusk & night time.
Unfortunately, when we went, we were not allowed to see the infinity pool, as guests had complained of tourists gaping at them. Sorry but I would have been gaping at the view, not them.
I found Ku De Ta to be quite expensive, even by Singapore standards.
A small bottle of Tiger & a very small vodka set me back S$40....
The souvenir stall was more reasonably price, with a free poster thrown in.
Allinall a very impressive bit of engineering, and a veiw to die for."
,,Felt like the animals in Singapore Zoo,1.0,,"We had many tourists and guests of the hotel walking around, watching us, taking photos (not us exactly) while we were sun bathing and swimming. It was very uncomfortable. You almost feel like an animal in a zoo. I don't think the hotel has thought this through."
,,Amazing views and museum,5.0,,We really enjoyed skypark particularly as it was raining! We went to th
,,fantastic view,5.0,,Best view in Singapore. Amazing building. worth the money forget the flyer just go up here and gaze...
,,Ok laa,3.0,,"Since this is the iconic building, I did go there once with tourist friends. That was the good times, during the opening year. We could go anytime and enjoy the whole deck.
Now that they restricted the tour, still thinking, is it worth to pay 20$ to get to the sky park. Why not go up to One Raffles and Enjoy the view and a drink !"
,,Skypark magic,5.0,,Excellent views on a clear day. No commentary now as seems they have discontd headsets. Cafe and dinng facilities.
,,The pool is awesome.,5.0,,I still get people oohing and arrhing over my facebook photos of us in the pool. It's an incredible idea and a heap of fun.
,,UP AND AWAY,5.0,,"You cannot miss this epic building, just look for the ship on top. Visitor passes are available but best to pre-book before arrival."
,,Great from ground level,4.0,,Visually so impressive from the ground - I'm not good with heights so didn't go up to the skypark but the views must be sensational.
,,Great View,5.0,,Its a brilliant idea and design. Nice 360 degree view of Singapore especially at night.
,,Sensational views!,5.0,,Do yourself a favour - spend the money on a ticket to the top! The views are just awesome!
,,Not to miss in Singapore,5.0,,Great place to view the whole marina bay on top of the ship. A unique building design. The skypark looks amazing with its infinite pools. Certainly not to be missed.
,,Infinity and Beyond,5.0,,"The pool, restaurants as well as the Sky Deck are just fabulous and nothing short for life-long memories..."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"The view here was truly amazing, both during the day and at night! It truly has the best views in all of Singapore; and to top it off, you get to see it while lounging or wading in the swimming pool! Must see!"
,,Great view.,4.0,,"Didn't like paying $20 for a view, but they have to limit the traffic somehow. We took the tour, which wasn't much--but no additional cost and allowed you to get close to the pool."
,,Must visit,5.0,,The Skypark alone should be reason enough to choose the Marina Bay Sands as your hotel. The view is out of this world. Having a cigar on top at night with the city in full view .... it doesn`t get any better than this :-)
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"The view and setting was beautiful. However, even as hotel guests, we could not find any seating and it was a mad zoo."
,,Great view!!!,5.0,,Well worth the S$20 to go up to the 57th floor. Try to go for the 9:00pm guided tour of the pool if you are not a guest at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. You get an almost 360degree view of the city. And be...More
,,GORGEOUS!!!,5.0,,"This place is absolutely amazing. On the 57th floor of Tower 3 of Marina Bay Sands, the view is out of this world. You can basically see all of singapore - the beautiful marina bay and the city on one side and the sea on...More"
,,Singapore April 2012,5.0,,We went to the Sky Park for a cocktail and to see the Singapore Nightscape. The views were breathtaking.
,,This is the coolest place. Go there!,5.0,,The Skypark is the best way to see the city and port in Singapore. Great view that can't be beat.
,,what a view,5.0,,"spent the acouple of nights at the MBS for my 15 year olds birthday...what a fun place to swim and spend a very enjoyable afternoon and evening...great spot for pictures...bar and snacks by the pool were good quality and ""normal"" prices for Singapore...service was top...More"
,,Lovely view,4.0,,"Singapore has lacked somewhere to see the whole city. Unfortunately the Sky Park doesnt alleviate the problem completely. The views are predominately to the North, South and East, the West is a bit more difficult to see. Its worth the experience, the SGD 20 entry, and maybe the risk of rain. Stay in Marina Bay Sands hotel and access is free to all the Park including the pool area and the available view is somewaht better."
,,In the clouds,5.0,,"A fantastic view over all of Singapore. I thought it was a fascinating place with a pool on the top, although only residents could use it."
,,Better than the photos...,5.0,,Loved spending time in the pool on Level 57. I think you have to be staying at MBS to enjoy this area. The view is sensational while keeping cool!
,,The view is definitely worth $20.,5.0,,"I have to admit, I was a little skeptical the view was going to be much different to riding the Singapore Flyer which we did a few hours earlier, but we all enjoyed the fantastic views and the tour of the pool area (no extra cost just put your name down when purchasing tickets). A must do on a clear night as the city and surrounds are just stunning."
,,Best view of the area,5.0,,"Located right next to the SIngapore Flyer, the Marina Bay Sands building is a marvelous structure in itself. The view from the sky-deck is absolutely stunning. The best time to go up to the sky-deck would be late evening as you can appreciate the full view of the city in daylight as well as the view of the city all lit up.
We were not able to take up the tour but spent some quality time on the sky-deck. I think the tickets are not very pricy and it is certainly less expensive then a ride on the Singapore Flyer."
,,BORRING!!!,1.0,,"You pay to go upstairs and if you want to sit down and have a coffee, and you don't want to go to Ku De Ta, the only thing you find is HORRIBLE hot dogs, with coca cola and a place on the floor to sit down! SERIOUSLY??? i refuse to pay to go there, if there's no options for everyone in here. Plus, as a guest in the hotel, hundreds of tourists, taking my picture when i sunbathe??? NO THANK YOU!"
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,This is a must for all people visiting Singapore Go up to the sky bar at the roof top to have drinks and enjoy the amazing views of SIngapore.
,,View,3.0,,View is good but does not offered 360 view at level 56. Directions to get to the ticket booth is vague.
,,Best view of city,5.0,,If you dont mind heights this is the best place to see Singapore. 57 floors up. wow
,,Great view,4.0,,"It's a bit expensive for what it is, but it is good to be able to look at the city from a different perspective. We didn't do the tour which takes you over to the infinity pool, but got a decent glimpse of the pool from the main viewing area. It's a similar view to the one you get from the Singapore Flyer but if you have to choose between them then this is the better view (and cheaper than the Flyer). We went during the day but the view at night would be even better."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"Best view in Singapore. Take an umbrella with you as it often rains fro short periods throughout the day. There is no areas under cover at the Skypark and no umbrella means you'll curse the SGD 20 you paid to go to the roof and not enjoy the view, for fear of getting soaked."
,,Amazing,4.0,,This is an incredible place - the view is spectacular. The architecture of the building is amazing. But watch when it's windy; it's a bit scary when you're so high up in the open.
,,The Best view of Singapore,5.0,,The bes opprtunity to take a look of une of the tallest most beautifull hotels in the world... the ticket goes for 20 SingDollars but is worth to do it. Best Regards
,,A must,4.0,,"The infinity pool there is perfect. However, it was crowded and all visitors can watch you swim. As a visitor, the view there is fantastic then!"
,,Don't fall for the tour!,3.0,,"If you are not a hotel guest, then the additional monies for the tour doesn't give you that much more to see or do, especially if the skies are not clear. They need to give an overview of how and when it was built and more details about the architecture, how much steel, etc. to keep it interesting. I would do it again, but not do the tour."
,,okay,4.0,,nice place a little bit expensive when I come directly without booking before.
,,The view is worth the money,4.0,,If you aren't stayng n the hotel then it is worth paying $20 to go p to sky park and watch the sunset. The Singapore city lights Re magical and the activity on the water and at the Singapore wheel makes it a great tourists evening
,,Amazing Night View,5.0,,Such amazing view from the Skypark and The Infinity Pool is simply awesome. The kids really enjoyed it.
,,Nice view,4.0,,Nice view of singapore skyline. Have to be a guest to use it. But no smoking area for smokers.
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,"To really get a feeling for the expansiveness of Singapore's skyline and shipping operations, the Sky Park is the best view in the city."
,,great view,4.0,,a little pricy to get up there and you are limited to one end of the building but very worthwhile - great views of the city and the building is amazing
,,Great view,4.0,,The view and the pool are impressive. Mojitos at Ku De Ta are pretty good.
,,The view and the arcitector,5.0,,It was just fantastic; the idea and the finished prosject
,,"love the restaurant, million dollar view",5.0,,the restaurant/ bar is accessible for everyone. the food is good Basic fare and a bit pricey. $38 for breakfast. $48 for lunch and $68 for dinner. The one thing is the fact that you have the unobstructed view of singapore. So in a way it's worth at least one splurge.
,,Great view,4.0,,Great view of harbor and city. Non-guests are limited to only the observation deck with $18 ticket
,,Amazing view of the City,5.0,,Went up to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark at night and was totally amazed by the beautiful view of the City. Well worth a stop.
,,bloody magic,5.0,,bloody magic you ask for 50 characters to review this place you don't need 50 characters
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This is a MUST SEE in Singapore. The view from the 57th floor is fantastic. Try to get there in the late afternoon so you can enjoy the sunset. The price is SD20.00 or for seniors SD17.00 with id. Obviously a clear day is helpful.
,,A must visit place,5.0,,This got added as an attraction only during mid 2011. One gets a nice panaromic view of Singapore and bay area from 56th floor. Great for photography at night - great experience. Select a time - may be late afternoon so that you get day time view. Have a drink and wait for - Singapore by night view.
,,a pity you can't have access to all of the skypark,3.0,,his would have been so muh better if you were not limited to just the viewing platform. expensive at S$20 just to take pictures from the top
,,Swim on top of the world (Singapore at least),4.0,,The pool area is a wonderful experience and is well managed and supervised. Some great photo opportunities are to be had during the night and day.
,,Fantastic views - but no access to the swimming pool views,4.0,,"We went up here on a brilliantly sunny day and saw views of Singapore at its best. The views from up here are stunning and although the entry ticket is quite expensive, it is worth it overall. We had looked at some of the photos on trip advisor and were looking forward to taking views of Singapore with the infinity pool in the foreground. Since Sept 2011, it is impossible to do this unless staying in the hotel, or booking on one of the tours. Since we arrived at 11am and the next tour was at 2pm, this did not work for us. However, we still had good views and overall would recommend this trip."
,,Fantastic view!,5.0,,"We went there on April 2nd at 2.30 pm, and found that they closed at 3 pm. The price was 68 SGD for for 2 adults and our 2 children. Anyway, this was a once in a lifetime experience, so we decided to do it anyway.

We went up 56 floors, and the view was absolutely fantastic - even on a hazy day. We saw lots of ships off the shore of Singapore, wonderful highrises in the city, people paddling canoes and a lot of road traffic. We were able to take some wondeful pictures while we enjoyed our 30 minutes on the roof.

We took a photo on the way up that we could buy for 30 SGD (cash only!) before going down. A nice and expensive memory :-)

After this stunning view we enjoyed a coffee break with great cakes at the hotel's ""Sweet Spot"" in the front desk area."
,,Superb Singapore Skyline from Sands Sky park,5.0,,The view is fantastic. Have taken many visitors up there. Only a bit expensive to go up. It is worth it for the visitors to have a fab view of the whole Singapore skyline. Go around 6.30 p.m to enjoy the before and after sunset views.
,,"Fantastic View, Ridiculous Price",4.0,,"The SkyPark was definitely on my 'to-do"" list when in Singapore, however the price of $20 to get up there was definitely a buzz kill. Though the view was FANTASTIC so it was sort of worth it!"
,,Best view,5.0,,"Great view of Singapore, it better then the Singapore flyer!!"
,,great views,4.0,,"great views from the bar, no need for a trip to the flyer"
,,Amazing,5.0,,This place gives you the best views of Singapore at night...... You can pay to go up and view or visit the bar and enjoy a drink....
,,Superb View,5.0,,"An absolutely superb view from the top of this builiding in Singapore.
You should spend a couple of hours up here just taking each piece of the view, and also add your name to the tour of the swimming pool area (no extra charge when I visited).
Early morning or late afternoon for the best light to take photographs as it is too bright in the middle of the day."
,,Great views!,5.0,,"Great way to see the city. Panoramic view of the port area, city center."

,,Great views!,5.0,,"Great way to see the city. Panoramic view of the port area, city center."
,,First class views,4.0,,Great expansive views. Best to go at dusk when the colours of the sky change from gold to mauve and the lights of the city come on. It's magical.
,,2nd Best View In Singapore,5.0,,"Expensive? Yes. But it's not really when you think about how much other iconic buildings charge for their view. The entrance ticket comes with a free drink at the bar on top of MBS, and if you go to the chocolate buffet you get entrance to the iconic infinity pool on the top of the skypark. Go up just before sunset and you get the best of the day and night skyline."
,,Breathtaking view while having breakfast.,5.0,,"The view, the breeze and of course good food at the club room.Sat outside facing the pool."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"It was fantastic, spent a lot of time here and well worth it....."
,,great view,5.0,,view from the sky park is amazing. well worth the entry fee. a must do in singapore.
,,Nice View But Restricted to one side,4.0,,The cost is $20 which is a little expensive and we are only allowed to stay on one corner of the roof. Once at the top there isn't much to see after a 5 minute walk around. There is a gift shop up there that is way overpriced.
,,Swimming pool with the best view,4.0,,"Guests at the Marina Bay Sands are given access to the infinity-type swimming pool at the 57th floor. The view from the pool is absolutely stunning! It can be quite chilly for a swim, but the view is breath-taking!"
,,Not worth the 20,2.0,,"The Skypark looks beautiful and well kept. It resembles a paradise built high up in the skyline of Singapore. For 20 dollars, you are free to roam about a desinated area within the SkyPark. On a clear day (not that often in tropical Singapore), it offers a stunning view that is hard to match. The only problem is the crowd. As a guest in the lovely pool, you will mimic one of the creatures you would find in a Zoo on display to to paying visitors. As a visitor paying the 20 bucks, you will be thinking at the exit.... is that it!!??"
,,Nice view,5.0,,The view is very nice. You can see the Singapore Flyer Is free for hotel guest. $20 for non hotel guest.
,,LOVELY VIEWS OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,"We went to Marina Bay Sands Sky Bar just because we wanted to see the view of Singapore & we were not disapointed. The bars trendy, Dj's playing, cocktails are good and not much more then the average price that you'd pay normally in Singapor go at sunset to see it both in daylight and in the dark. My tip would be don't pay to go to the viewing deck (about $20 dolars), go up to the bar its free to get in and you can have a drink whilst watching the sun go down."
,,Magnificent view!,5.0,,"i love it! you can have dinner and wine at Ku De Ta and enjoy your view. if you only go to skypark dont forget to bring you camera. i suggest you come here from 4 - night, so you wont miss sunset and beautiful lights at night."
,,a bit expensive,5.0,,if you are not a resident in this hotel you can go up to the top of it ( has a swimming pool on roof) for the sum of $20 and what i learned was that it is not worth it unless you go at certain times as you can only access a small portion of the roof when no residents are using pool area.
,,Wonderful Scenery,5.0,,Absolutely breath-taking view from the top... Shud try to view sunrise or sunset from that point...
,,Great views,4.0,,"It is quite expensive to go in at $20 but the views are great. Also, try to get a peek at the swimming pool on that level. The edge of the pool is the edge of the building. The pool area and gardens were closed to the public when we went even though they advertised tours if you registered."
,,Tourists will love it,3.0,,"first of all its a very very costly place to be.
even the bar which sells drinks at a price way beyond of any local bars.
mainly make up of high end shops.
its still a pretty place for pictures and such but beware of over spending there."
,,Great View Great Pool,5.0,,Panoramic View of entire city is at the eyesight. We could see as far as East Coast to West coast. Not only that far far away the Indonesian islands.
,,Good but better views elsewhere.,4.0,,"The skypark was spectular and had great views, looking back over Singapore. its cost $$ to get this view and thats all you get for your money. A better option was to go to Altitude One at Raffles place. I went there with a friend about 9.pm and was able to view the Marina Bay light show from a better angle.
To go up to this bar cost $25 but it includes your first drink, so in affect the view is free. well worth a look."
,,Wonderfulview!,5.0,,"The view is great from top of Sands SkyPark. View point is separated from swimming pools and gardens. If you want to visit pools and gardens you must go with guided tour. Check for tours time before you go (10 a.m, 2 p.m, 9p.m)."
,,For S$20 you can do better...,3.0,,"While the view is spectacular (especially at sunset) and the photo opportunities abundant, I think you're still being ripped off. It's better to go buy an overpriced drink at Ku De Ta, where the service sucks but the view is awesome. Another alternative is the Singapore Flyer, where the view is just as good as long as you don't mind being cooped up on a ferris wheel for a half an hour."
,,Stunning view of the city!,5.0,,"This is absolutely stunning! Overlooking the city, it's truely unique! :-D Loved it!"
,,Say you are going to the restaurant.... Free lift then!,4.0,,"We arranged to meet some people at the bar, so told the lift people that was where we were going. We got a ticket and up we went. I didn't even know there was a cost for the place until I read the reviews here. You have to go there and look. Fantastic views, it's a must do for Singapore."
,,nice and freindly,4.0,,for a light bite and a beverage you can not beat the breath taking views
,,Singapore Skyline all in a glance,3.0,,"Gives a great view of the whole city, and the increasingly beautiful skyline. Go there during National Day Parade (Previews, or actual parade) and you can even catch the cool fireworks, and airshows in close proximity. Food & Beverages are really expensive there though, and because of the hype, the place can get a tad crowded at times. So much so that swimming might be near to impossible for hotel guests at times. Nothing much other than that though."
,,Great view,2.0,,Great view... but everything else from the food to the getting there is not good.
,,Great views but over rated,3.0,,"First you pay to go up to the sky park, then the drinks and food are very expensive. One of those places were it is nice to say you have been but I would not be going back."
,,A must do!,5.0,,Higher than the Singapore Flyer (like the London Eye) and supeb views over Singapore - make time to visit.
,,great architecture,4.0,,"Only 1 night stay at MBS is not enough time to explore this hotel. We spend time for the Sky Park in the afternoon for shortly, unfortunately these area for children is very limited. Of course the architecture and building style is admirable.
Inhouse in the MBS, so we freely in and out of the Sky Park.
Can see the sights around Singapore.
Better just pay SGD. 20 only, to enjoy this area rather than overnight in the MBS."
,,Breathtaking view,5.0,,Brilliant view of Singapore to city or out to sea . Anytime of day but night is best with all the light shows
,,Jewel in the sky,5.0,,"A must to see. If you are just visiting the Sands, for a small fee you can enter the Sky Park it is really worth the trip. Have a drink from the Bar, Resturant or night club. Very comfortable garden area and spa's. 10 out of 10"
,,Cant be missed,4.0,,"Whilst my husband did this, I was safely on Level 1 shopping! He loved it, he doesnt share my fear of heights, so enjoyed every minute of it. He got fantastic photos. Especially of the ArtScience Museum looking down on it.

If you have seen the documentary on the building of the Marina Bay Sands - this is not to miss, even just to say ""I was standing on the top of that""."
,,Good view.,3.0,,"The view up there is good, and you can see quite a bit of the city. But for SG$20 just to take an elevator up, it's not really worth the money."
,,Book a meal at Ku Te Da and go up free,4.0,,"The sky park offers lovely view of the city. Great photo spot. Instead of purchasing tickets for teh skypark, book a meal at Ku Te Da and you get to go up free!"
,,Amazing Views of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore either for Transit or a planned Holiday this is a must do! The sky park tickets cost only $20 (As of Feb'12) and the views are amazing. It is a really good idea to go after rain as the views will be more clear. Remember that the Sky Park ticket does not mean that you will have access to the Sky Pool for that you need to be a Hotel Guest! Although if you arrive early in the morning, you can get a free tour to the pool area, the registrations for the tour are very limited and it is advisable to reach early in the morning. Although the height is not as high as Burj Khalifa in Dubai but this is the highest view point in Singapore, and you can get a glimpse of Malaysia and Indonesia too."
,,Unreal,5.0,,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and the SkyPark absolutely made our experience. There is NO better view of the city in all of Singapore, especially while swimming comfortably in their infinity pool!"
,,Great spot for a cocktail,4.0,,Not sure if you are meant to pay for this but we managed to get a lift up in a lift with a hotel resident. Very good truffle caesar salad and cocktails at the lounge bar. Awesome views.
,,Excellent place to see Singapore,5.0,,A must when visiting Singapore. You will have an unforgettable view of the city and surroundings.
,,Excellent Panoramic view of Singapore and Surroundings,5.0,,A great way to see Singapore day or night is going up to the Sky Park at Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You'll have the best view in town.
,,Excellent vantage point of SG,5.0,,View from the top; truly not to be missed. Especially at night.
,,another place for nice views!,4.0,,"Visited the skydeck for some more great views of Singapore, the skyline, harbours and ships at sea."
,,The Top of Singapore,5.0,,Best time is on the evening before sunset....stay a lil an enjoy the city light up before your eye's
,,"Great view, don't miss it if you can afford it.",4.0,,"Like many other reviewers we went up to the bar next to the SkyPark to have drinks and avoided the entrance fee. You have to use the elevator at the end of tower 3 to go up there and there is a host infront of the elevator who provides you a small card which you can show to the security to get in.
Before you get in there is a small balcony looking to south with the view of sea and construction sites which is not really good and you can just skip it. The bar is just next to the infinity pool and you can take a look at people enjoying the view while swimming.
It was very crowded as expected and no seatings are offered outside. You have to be a member or stay inside if you don't want to stand.
If you are lucky like us you can get a stand by the railing and enjoy cocktails while watching the sunset over the modern buildings of the financial district and the marina.
Service is very slow and it is a bit pricey. Take your camera with you and you will definitely have some good material to show friends when you are back home."
,,ku de ta bar,1.0,,"four of us went to this bar on 18th feb.2012 , the outside part ( with the view ) was cordened off , so sat on lounges inside with our drinks $ 85 later , had only sat a few minutes and told to get off lounges as they had been reserved !! the young man was very unpleasant , if we had known we could not sit we would not have had drinks which we had to finish standing !! the men in our party are 80 years old and us ladies in our 70s , never before have any of us experienced such rudeness in singapore which is world renown for their politeness, needless to say we won't be going there again"
,,What a view,5.0,,"Had a late lunch at Ku De Ta, fantastic food (big servings) cold drinks and a view that is unsurpassed. It will be on my itinerary for my next visit in September."
,,Beware,3.0,,If you are not staying in the Marina bay and want to go on to the roof you can but you are limited to a small section only at the end of the building. There is a restaurant however for visitors.
,,Nice view of Singapore skyline,4.0,,"Nice view, not too crowded Hotel guests need to present their key card in order to access the Skypark - others will have to pay a fee"
,,Overated?,3.0,,U have to pay to go up there and yet U cant access the view at Infinity Pool unless you're the hotel guest.. and that's a different story. There's a better place to catch the city view plus MBS itself! Go 1-Altitude
,,what a veiw,5.0,,The best $20 dollars you can spend in singapore!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can spend as much time their as want.
,,a bit of a rip off,3.0,,"Yes, indeed, the view is great and I was very willing to pay the S$ 20 to get to the top. Once there I was a bit disappointed. With all intention to enjoy a cocktail closer to the clouds I experienced the bar on top as boring and missing the touch I would have expected in such environment. rather than being purely touristic there could be a much cooler bar here providing just some sort of chilling atmosphere. I can relate to the fact that the day time visitor is no longer allowed to the pool area as this is reserved for hotel guest, but nevertheless, the touristy area could do much better. I would not repeat the trip up there, but rather go and sip a cocktail at Altitudes bar"
,,It could have been truly great.....,2.0,,"It is BEAUTIFUL up there with magnificent views of the new Singapore skyline! Timber decks all around with infinity pool and restaurants.

However, the scary thing is that if the crowd capacity is full, then it has the potential of becoming a death trap as there are ONLY 2 lifts servicing the whole area which can accommodate hundreds.

We had this experience once during the National Day fireworks display and when it was over, most people wanted to leave and it took more than 30minutes to wait for the lift which was the only way down as they had blocked the emergency staircases.

Bad Bad Bad quality of service for such a ""top class"" hotel.. and not even mentioning the expensive fee one has to pay to go in..."
,,Average,3.0,,"Do not Go to SKy park as it waste of money if you have taken singapore flyer ride,as S Flyer is much better with the view and height Its better to go for Flyer Rest it depends on person to person,they do not let you go to pool side ,its just small deck"
,,Great views but over priced!,3.0,,"The views from the Skypark are superb, but not surpassing those of neighbouring office towers at Marina Bay Financial Centre. The cost of $20 to use the lift and listen t an audio tour is a little steep to be fair, only to be fleeced for hotdogs and keyrings when you get to the top. Although, it is unique."
,,Kudeta on the rooftop,5.0,,"One of the best places in Singapore is the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands. They have a restaurant, night club, huge swimming pool with sun beds and amazing 360 degrees view to the city."
,,Beautiful view of the city! Bring your camera,4.0,,"They now charge you 10 dollars to go up... There's a way around that. Just go have a drink upstairs, it will cost you only 6-8 dollars, and you can enter the premises as well and have a drink"
,,Newly build A Great New Landmark of Singapore,5.0,,Looking at the Three building together and looks like a long ship on the top... Once goes in on the observation deck beautiful views but not 360 degreee view as some part of the area was closed. It had swimming pool at the top but cannot go in as it is only for hotel visitors to use this facilities. Great to be on the top and get the real feels.. Cost S$20 to go in.
,,Fantastic view of the city,4.0,,If you like a great view of the city of Singapore and the near by islands including Indonesia from the Sands Sky park. The flip side of the coin is that If I was a hotel guest I would really dislike all these visitors running on the room top and I can't work on my tan.
,,SkyPark was awesome,5.0,,The view was spectacular! I love the night view and the infinity pool!
,,Wonderful views!,4.0,,"Sadly, only hotel guests can use the pool. But the views are amazing!"
,,What a View,5.0,,Great views all over the City from Sky Park. The bar on the 57th floor must be one of he best/coolest bars in the World
,,View of singapore city as of subsitution of Heli!,4.0,,"It was a tremendous view! the sky park was awesome, My suggestion to the hotels, if they would be able to create more places to view the city from the skypark. The pool, Excellent!"
,,"the views are fantastic,",5.0,,"The views are great from here, the nightclub/bar is special !!"
,,superb views,4.0,,"superb views esp during sunset ..
scenery is fantastic .. both overlooking Singapore skyline & the sea
camera is a must ...
the garden is nice & cool during the night
recommended for garden party
rooftop swimming pool makes u feel floating on top of the world
entrance fee is expensive ,, but .. its free admission for Marina Bay Sands hotel guests"
,,"Great view, but overpriced",3.0,,"The view form the top is great, but being limited to such a small section of the top and having to pay so much to get there meant it felt like a rip-off. Certainly wouldn't recommend it."
,,"top view, great pool, great food",5.0,,this is one place you got to add to your bucket list
,,Great Views Expensive lift ride,3.0,,"This is amazing building great architecture and spectacular views fantastic for photographs maybe not so great if your scared of heights.
You do get fantastic shots of the city and marina bay area, but other then that there is little else to do.
Saying this though if you don't visit and see another persons views you may regret it and it only takes approx 45 minutes of your time."
,,Wow,4.0,,"This is a must for any visitor to Singapore.Whilst it costs 20SPD it was well worth it for the Fantastic views from the top.It certainly gives the visitor the best view and impression of the City/State.
After visiting try the bars near the Marina during happy hour and take in the Laser Show at 8p.m."
,,Awesome!!,5.0,,"Pure awesomeness!! Place was too good to be true. Awesome view, cool place to have a party and get to know people from different places and stuff."
,,Spectacular view of Lion City,5.0,,"'ve been on top of the Sands Sky Park several times taking guests who were visiting Singapore. I love the view of the entire city from such a dizzying heights which may not go well with people with height-o-phobia. Otherwise the view from the top overlooking the sea, Singapore River, the Central Business District and overall city is very spectacular and certainly breathtaking. I love the pool which is an interesting design as if the water is flowing down from the top of the pool from the roof. The several jacuzzi's are great as well, unfortunately the facility and pool are exclusive to hotel guest."

,,OH PLEASE!,2.0,,"20$ to just go to the top? There are so many better places to see Singapore. It's a novelty, I'll grant you that, but a waste of money overall. (and it isn't hard to find places to spend money in Singapore!)"
,,Awesome views,5.0,,"Even thought i'm not one for heights, it was well worth a visit. Cost 20 SD but you can stay up there as long as you like. You can go up at night too if you fancy it."
,,Nice view,4.0,,"Nice view of Marina Bay from the sky deck at Marina Bay Sands. Quite expensive to go up and you are not able to enter the hotel area, swimming pool etc. Go up for the time of sunset for the best experience."
,,Infinity Pool on the 57th floor,5.0,,"Staff was friendly, plenty of towels and areas to rest."
,,good view,5.0,,it is amasing from above .. the view of the marina is wonderful.
,,No for the scare of heights,5.0,,"This is a great experience and if you want to go for a clear view of Singapore, this is the place to go. It is a bit pricy but when would you get the chance of doing something like this again? Sign up for the guided tour which is free but find out what time is on as there are just a few a day and if you miss it you could probably have to wait a couple of hours there to the next one."
,,$20 per admission,4.0,,it just $20 n it comes with a complimentary drink. nice view.!!
,,"view great, restaurant not",3.0,,"The view is great, I didn't like the restaurant at all, the atmosphere is lacking considerably, it reminds me of a sort of medium-higher end fast food place. I would skip the restaurant but go to see the view."
,,Rather interesting,4.0,,"I'd say it is worth a visit. For its scenic view, it is a fascinating venue. Not to mention the restaurants and clubs around it which would blow your entire trip's budget and even more. Make sure you dress for the occasion and leave your hat and wig at the reception counter."
,,Great views!,5.0,,"Seriously plan to spend some quality time up here. Bring a book, get into the pool and heated jacuzzis...and stay for sundown or come at sunrise. You won't regret it. Be warned though - drinks are expensive...cappucino at $18 or something."
,,Bird Eye View of Singapore,5.0,,Its a cool way to see singapore Skyline. You must visit this and experience the sight and beuty of singapore. Buy the Singapore pass which comes with duck tour and flyer.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,I really love the experience at the skypark. its worth visiting. You must dine at the skypark you will really enjoy it. The sight of Singapore is fantasti from that height and the lighting around the marina bay area is beautifull. Sometimes when its windy it really scares you. You just cant stop clicking snaps. If you happen to visit Singapore make sure to visit it and I promise you will love it.
,,Great view,4.0,,Great view from the top. Entrance is free for hotel guests.
,,Fabulous experience,5.0,,It is a must to go to sands skylark if you are in Singapore. At least once! The experience is fantastic and we are so in love with the view!
,,Overpriced and Not Really Amazing,3.0,,"Don't get me wrong, the views from the top of this place are pretty impressive. But you soon get bored and I feel the view from the Marina Bay bridge is just as good. The cost is also a little high. Visiting the viewing decks of Rockefeller or Empire State in NYC are truly impressive and there is history to boot, the views here are mainly of the bay which you can get from the ground.

You may enjoy it but it may seem a little over-hyped and overpriced."
,,Great view,4.0,,The scenery was really beautiful. Good for a one time experience
,,Skypark @ MBS - Singapore,4.0,,Unique Skypark with a Birdeye view of Singapore & a Swimming Pool up there. A good place for visitors to view Singapore skyline but the cost is very high. Only if you can afford. Otherwise take the Sentosa Cable Car ride. The view as good.
,,Nice views at night,4.0,,"Went there for sunset, the night views are spectacular."
,,Amazing View but a bit overpriced...,3.0,,"This building definitely adds to the city Skyline in Singapore. We had a view of it from our hotel room so we decided to check it out. We went up on a lovely clear day so the view was fantastic. However, it is so overpriced from what you actually get and the amount of time one would spend up there. Done it once, but wouldn't do it again."
,,Sands Skypark,4.0,,"Great view of the city and its cheaper and better than the Singapore flyer which you look down on.We walked to it and it is very difficult to find the entrance, even though you can see it for miles, due to the road systems."
,,too much,3.0,,why do i have to pay to see the view? the lines were long and there were tons of people taking pictures...nice but never again
,,"Not really a park,yet a great view",4.0,,"It is an interesting thing to call a really high place with some plants and trees a Skypark,the name is catchy but it is definitely not a park.

The view from there is amazing,though. I recommend specially to go by evening time when you will be able to get a glimpse of Singapore city and its wonderful skyline. Kind of an apperitif for a nice night out in Lion City. That's all."
,,Amazing view,5.0,,"$20/person - awesome view, and cafe. The cafe is pricey, but the view! don' think you're going to get a look at that awesome infinity pool - that's for guests only."
,,Amazing,5.0,,What an experience. If nothing else this has to be seen.
,,Nice panaromic view of the city,5.0,,The views were nice. Although would have liked to go towards the pool side on the roof top too but its reserved for hotel guests only.
,,All Tourists MUST go up. But it is a disappointment.,3.0,,"Yes the view is amazing. Yes Ku De Ta is there (although not associated with the Bali venue except for their legal battle) and yes there is an amazing pool. On a clear day the views are awesome. Awesome views, everything is average. Ku De Ta is overpriced and lacks authenticity... Pool is for hotel guests only (and rightfully so) and the rest is just a viewing platform. Do it once, check it off your list, but don't expect too much."
,,No-1 Attraction in Singapore,5.0,,The night view of singapore with a bath at sky park is my one of the best experiance.We staying here in this hotel Marina Bay Sands.and Its was @57th floor of the same hotel
,,no big deal,3.0,,water was too cold for swmming. besides the view there was nothing special
,,View to die for,5.0,,"Just a stunning location and view. Can only go in the pool if staying at hotel, but views are still brilliant if you're not."
,,Beautiful view,5.0,,"If you are not guest of Marina Bay Sands Hotel you have to pay more or less 20 singapore dollars, I think you can choose between Sands SkyPark or Singapore Flyer. If you have time go in both attractions."
,,Nice view,4.0,,It is worth to go to the top of the hotel and enjoy the view of the city.
,,Nice way to start the evening,4.0,,"Worth while. Went at sunset so got a good veiw of Singapore. Access to swimming pool & restaurant not allowed unless you register for a tour. Queue not too long, but after dinner, say 8pm-9pm I would expect longer lines, especially on weekends. Not as good as Pearl Tower in Shanghai. See website for costs."
,,Slightly overrated,4.0,,"Did this for free by accident I think. Noone stopped me as I followed others looking for the lifts up to this deck. Depends on when you go. I can see going for sunset, and to eat if you can. Would be worth it. But just to go during the middle of the day... not worth it for the price. It can certainly be quite scary up there for people scared of heights. You look down right over the freeway."
,,Sky high,4.0,,Well worth the 20 dollars for the views of Singapore.
,,Just ok,3.0,,"We went there when the non-hotel guests were allowed to go up and look around. It was horrible. You would feel that you're in an aquarium, being looked at and ending up in someone else's photos!  It was simply too crowded especially by the pool area."
,,very worthwhile,4.0,,For me it was worth going up on this architectural masterpiece. Good views of the harbor and city. Had lunch upstairs. Nice asian buffet and menu items for lunch. Pricey but a good experience.
,,Dream views,5.0,,Spent a few nights in the hotel and went to the sky park and the pool...breathtaking..really a highlight of the trip
,,Recommended but overpriced,3.0,,"I'm torn because this attraction is pretty cool; unfortunately, it is hideously overpriced so it's debatable whether it should be supported. For $20 you head up a lift to the boat stretching across the marina bay skyscrapers and can have a look around. The view is absolutely incredible, especially at night but I'm sure not everyone will share this opinion; in addition, you are restricted to a small area of the nose of the boat and can't wander far. I really think that everyone should go up and experience this but the price is just too much - I think it should cost about $5-10 instead for what you get... I also didn't check out the laser show from the top - might be worthwhile to see but I can't be sure if you would be able to see a thing since I wasn't there. Also - please keep in mind that the skypark closes relatively early (around 10 I believe) so don't go late like we did and end up rushed!

I would say this experience is worth about 3.5 starts taking the price into account."
,,Great view of Singapore!,4.0,,"Have a good 360o view of Singapore from the Marina Bay Sand's observation deck. However, it's a bit pricey as the price is still S$20 but you cannot visit the VIP pool and rest of hotel top floor."
,,Great view of Singapore financial district from MBS,4.0,,"Went to Marina Bay Sands' Observation deck, which has a great view of Singapore; however, it's a bit pricey now as the ticket is still S$20 but you can only have the front view, cannot visit the VIP pool & rest of the hotel top floor."
,,Not what we were expecting,2.0,,"Guess it wasn't our lucky night. It started well, good table with a great view, friendly staff who helped us through the menu. It all went wrong just after we had our starters ( mushroom soup in a tea cup which was delucious). First a waiter dropped a glass tgat shattered all over the place, then we had over an hour wait for our main course. After chasing after our meals the main course turned up cold, which put us ( my wife and I) off our meals. Still the girl serving the bread did a great job as we were kept in good supply during our hour long wait. Although she had no clue as to where the toukets were located when asked!"
,,Killer views of SG,5.0,,I made it up for the nightly laser/light show over the bay (it may run a few times per night I'm not sure). It's a great place to see many of the iconic sites around the city. I would definitely recommend that people visit at night as the city looks amazing all lit up.
,,Too Expensive,2.0,,"The view is great, but there are plenty of places you can get this at a much cheaper price."
,,Incredible architecture,4.0,,These are a must see in Singapore. Along with the Casino in the bottom. The view is great and you can really treat your self with great food.
,,a definite must!!,5.0,,definitely have o try this. across from the pavillion but what a view!!
,,Amazing views of the city,5.0,,"This place has amazing city views , even better if you are here to watch the grand prix as the pit lanes are just below it. Worth at trip to the top."
,,"Stunning venue, service could be better",3.0,,"Balancing over the ECP, 57 floors up, views over the CBD and the sea.... should be perfect, no?

Well it would be BUT you feel like you're being herded into and out of lifts, shuffled around the skypark and interupted by (numerous) lightning warnings.

Take this and the fact it's over SGD 20 to go up and I don't think you get the best deal.

My alternative tip is to go next door to Ku De Ta at 6:15, no cover change and as the service is so bad you can go up and hang around for about 10 / 15 minutes check out the views and leave! If you decide to stay for a drink you will end up paying the same as the skypark however you'll have a beautifully crafted cocktail instead of an entery ticket!

Even better tip is to go to Altitude at the UOB Building in Raffles Place for 360 degree views (and the benefit of getting MBS in your pictures!)"
,,Great view,5.0,,Enjoy a cocktail in the open air at the top. Great to get a different viewpoint.
,,Excellent views,5.0,,"Get there in the afternoon as the infinity pool is open for public at 2pm. Rest, the view and experience can only be felt there, cant explain in words."
,,Unspectacular Views,2.0,,"The best place to catch a wonderful view of the Singapore skyline isn't on the top of the Marina Bay Sands. Rather its from the roof top of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, in its drinking hole, Lantern. You get a better view of the light show the Sands puts up from Lantern too.
==================
http://AppetiteTeasers.blogspot.com"
,,Like on the top of the world,5.0,,"The whole Marina Bay Sands complex is trully amasing - huge hotel, big shopping mall and the biggest casino in the world - crazy. The Sky Park is on the top of the 3 towers of the Hotel, and it looks ike a huge surf board. The infinity pool at the top is amasing and the night view from the pool even more (you can get to the pool only if you are a hotel guest).
The view from the top is breath taking (at least for those who love tall buildings and the lots of lights), you can see the whole Singapore area on one side and the sea on another.
There is a souvenir shop, a bar and a restaurnt with great garden and nice food selection. If you plan to go to the restaurant, be minded that clothes can not be casual (no sneakers or shorts).
A must go when in SIngapore, definitely!"
,,Magnificent view of the Singapore skyline,5.0,,"We wanted to join the View Deck and Garden tour at 9pm but unfortunately it was fully booked so we opted for the Single Admittance, General Admission tickets (View Deck only). We went there at around 8pm. In my opinion, it's better to go here because it is higher than the Singapore Flyer."
,,Incredible in every way.,5.0,,Absolutely a must do in Singapore. Try the mango smoothies.
,,"Views, Views, Views!",5.0,,"This is an incredible building - three 60 story towers topped by what looks like a stranded tanker ship! The ""ship"" is actually an infinity pool (can only be used by hotel guests but you can arrange a tour) and an observation deck which provides incredible views of Singapore. You can get a ticket which also gives you access to the nearby Arts and Science Museum (which currently has a wonderful exhibit on the Titanic.)"
,,Cheaper alternatives,3.0,,"Without a doubt the views are amazing but the cost of visiting is too steep, so it was a once off for us and we won't be doing it again. It was not easy to find this attraction when we were in the hotel complex.

We have had some very good views from the hotels we have stayed at."
,,Over rated,3.0,,"Gotta love the view. But besides that, the experience is over-priced."
,,Best View over Singapore,5.0,,Whether it be the busy shipping lane or the bustling city there is simply no better place to view it. Real bonus if your staying at the Sands as you get to enter the fabulous bars and restaurants not to mention the infinity edge pool.
,,Not for the faint hearted!,4.0,,"The whole setting, high in the sky with its electric atmosphere makes it a 'must-be' in Singapore"
,,Swim with a view,5.0,,I love this pool - there's nothing quite like an infinity pool especially one with a view as good as this.
,,Nice view but ticket a bit expensive.,3.0,,"Since they have close the walk way to the pool, you will have only some space to walk around. The view is great but may be for the price it's not worth. Too crowded."
,,Just another lookout.,3.0,,"Went up to the roof on an elevator. Highest viewpoint of the city. Sure, parts were pretty and it made you appreciate how big the place is, but there are much prettier places out there. I wasn't a fan of the smog to begin with, but it really ruined the birds eye view."
,,Vintage Point,5.0,,"Vintage point to look around the island. You can see the whole of Singapore on a good day, and even to neighbouring Indonesia!"
,,Would Have Rated it Excellent if it still included access to the gardens.,4.0,,Great views from one of the highest points in Singapore. Bad news as of December the pass to the SkyPark only includes the observation deck. The park is off limits.
,,Horrible!,1.0,,Just like a water park! Nothing classy or private about this property.
,,Amazing views,4.0,,"We timed it so we could see the skyline in daylight and watch the sunset whilst sitting having a drink in the open air bar. The views are stunning and the night views of the city are good too. Amazing to think that the hotel and all around it are built on what used to be the sea. Some local people don't like it and say don't go there and it must be hard, but the views are amazing."
,,No access to infinity pool or garden,3.0,,"$20 a person to go up to the SkyPark observation deck & have a look down. You can't have a look at the infinity pool or the garden anymore, unless you're part of a previously bespoke tour group. Fair enough though, if I were a guest at the hotel I wouldn't want randoms from the street popping in to have a look while I had a dip in the pool. Felt $20 was a bit too much for the privilege of going up the observation deck, but you get to say you were there and check in on FB & foursquare and what have you :)"
,,1st time to try since the opening,4.0,,"Great bird-eye view of Singapore from here.
Worth for life time experience.
And if you like to partying, there is club up here called Ku.De.Ta, you can try to enjoy the beat along the night scenery of Singapore
But make sure the time you go there, the weather is good, because when storm or raining, the management will close this facility."
,,Nice view but not worth the money,2.0,,"For $20, it is definitely not worth the money. No doubt the view from the SkyPark is beuatiful, but you could get a similar view from probably the Flyer or other slightly less tall building. There is no commentary provided. After paying, you just head to lift, go right up, being told where you can go to and where you can't...enjoy the scenery, snap a few pictures and that's it. You either go down or just stay there to admire the beauty of Singapore night scene."
,,great view and cocktails,5.0,,a fantastic place to enjoy city views and have a cocktail
,,Fantastic. What a view,5.0,,Probably the best view I have experienced from an infinity pool on the 57th Fllor of a building that seems to drop over the side.
,,Wonderful view. Nothing like it in Singapore,5.0,,"You get a wonderful view of Singapore from the Sands Sky Park. The only down side to it is that if you want to have a drink or snack, the bistro is just a bit pricey for my taste"
,,Fantastic View of Singapore,5.0,,If you want a cracking photo of Singapore - do this! the view from the top is amazing. Its much higher than the Flyer (London Eye type wheel).
,,Brilliant,5.0,,But only if you are a hotel guest and can access the pool.
,,Over-rated,4.0,,Yes you see the beautiful skyline and good for an evening drink. But I won't pay to get up there.
,,outstanding,5.0,,"we didnt stay at the marina bay hotel but belive me we will next time, the view from the top is amazing, we went upto the roof in the evening well worth the $20 to go, drinks like everywere in Singapore cost around £7 on the rooftop bar but well worth having a few drinks while there."
,,High Above it all,5.0,,Go up to the SkyPark just before sunset and watch the sky turns colour with backdrop of the city. Sun sets at about 7 PM all year round.
,,Awesome view,5.0,,"See review of Marina Bay although I mistakenly put Hyatt instead of Sands. Good shops as well, but that is the same over all of Singapore"
,,Great Views,4.0,,Can get a little busy and are only allowed at on corner of the sky park
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,What an experience. This was one of the most beautiful spots I have been to in a long while. The view is beyond anything you can imagine and the service is impeccable.
,,Great place for a cocktail,5.0,,The view is amazing. It is worth the $20 to go up and see Singapore from the sky. Very cool.
,,"Panoramic View of Singapore, Best at Night",4.0,,Top of the Sands Hotel and Casino. Great view of Singapore. The $20 Sing is expensive so go for a drink or meal and the ride is free
,,Great,4.0,,"Sky park is fun as it is on the 57th floor.
If you are an resident of Marina Bay hotel then you have an advantage as the access to the terrace is limited to guest staying at the hotel. Although there are many speciality restaurants which are open for non residents as well."
,,"A ""must do""",5.0,,Fantastic views and just an amazing building. Pool area is quite amazing also.
,,2nd to none,5.0,,"This was just great, the views spectacular although the price to go up if you did not stay in the hotel was quite high, would recommend a look"
,,Really rude reception staff!,3.0,,"The entrance was pretty hard to find, very badly signed from within the Marina Sands complex (I guess they want you to wander past ALL the shops first) and the staff taking your money were ill-informed and basically lied to us about the facilities at the top. The views are good if it's a nice day and that's your thing, but not especially picturesque (high-rise forever in 3 directions, industrial port in the 4th). The staff in the bar/restaurant on the other hand were very professional and helpful."
,,Nice view,4.0,,Awesome view! Heaps of areas to walk around and look at the view from different areas. Only disappointment is we couldnt go into the pool area unless we waited for the tour but we didnt have time. Would love to swim in the pool! Might have to stay at this hotel next time! The whole boat on top of the building looks amazing from the ground level of the city also
,,Very Unique,5.0,,"Though it is not the highest pool facility above the horizon, it offers the best ambience. Users of all ages love it and the orderly manner it is being managed make you enjoy every moment you are there."
,,Best hotel in Singapore,5.0,,This hotel is a must for everyone's 'bucket list' - as NIKE would say - 'just do It'!
,,Spectacular views,4.0,,Amazing buildings. Fantastic views all round. Worth a visit.
,,Overpriced and underwhelming,1.0,,"With access to only a small element of the park, with the remainder reserved for hotel guests, this was a disappointing experience. There are no seats or shade and the only refreshments available were through the high priced outdoor bar making a daytime visit a hot affair.

You queue for entry in the basement, then enter via one elevator lobby and exit via another, compounding the feeling of being 'ushered through'. Additionally, if you have a pram, as we did, there are several sets of stairs to negotiate. As a result, while the view was good, the Flyer was a far better experience."
,,Nice view but a bit pricey,3.0,,"For admission of $20 per person, guests can only access the Observation Deck, and admired the pool etc on the other side (which are for hotel guests only) Get a nice view of the city, and photos opportunities, but not sure it is worth it."
,,magnificent ....,5.0,,"breath taking view, if you are a resident in the hotel, the swimming pool and Jacuzzies are awesome, the SkyPark restaurants are great (and obviously extra expensive)."
,,Amazing views,5.0,,"One of the best views of Singapore that I have ever experienced. 150m of clear pools, and 2 jacuzzis XD"
,,We didn't realise just how big Singapore is until we visited SkyPark!,4.0,,"A feat of engineering, there are some great views to be had from this attraction!

The lift from the ground to the SkyPark is very fast, and you barely notice that you are even moving!

Just note that access to the pool and garden park are restricted to hotel guests only, however those just visiting for the observation deck can join tours of these areas at certain times of the day."
,,"A unique building, but sky park alone is not worth the money.",3.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel itself is an interesting building. For this alone it is worth a visit to the building. But that is about where it ends unless one plans to stay in the hotel.

For non-hotel guests, the access is now limited only to the observation deck in the pointy corner of the sky deck that joins the three towers. Only hotel guests are allowed in to the infinity pool area which probably is a much better proposition. The price to get to the observation deck is steep (cost S$74 for our family of 4) and once you step out of the high speed lift all you see is a bit of the ocean crowded with variety of ships and Singapore – a city full of nothing but sky scrapers. On a clear day you may see far and the view may be good at night. But for us it was not worth the money.

Of course you get to see the Merlion park below but that, in our view, is best observed at ground level and not from high above.

We found the experience to be a bit disappointing. If you have been up any other tall structure (e.g Sydney’s Centre Point Tower, Empire State Building, KL Towers etc) then you can safely give this one a miss. It is best to take a boat cruise along the river at night and enjoy the glorious sight of this building (and many others) from below – a far better return for your money."
,,Stunning view of Singapore,5.0,,"A simply spectacular view of Singapore from here, worth the expense for the three of us."
,,Swimming in heaven,5.0,,Swimming in the pool was wonderful. The sky park was the reason why we stayed at this hotel.
,,Beautiful view,4.0,,"Panorami is very beautiful, but the access to swimming pool in denied if you are not an hotel guest...Not nice, not kind."
,,Skygarden in the clouds!,5.0,,"Brilliant a do not MISS, spectacular views, and from Clarke Quay at night you would think a flying ship. This is indeed a Skygarden!"
,,Expensive for a view,3.0,,"You will probably want to go up for the sake of it. The view is great but you are given access to only a very small part of the top level, there is no pool access. I think the charge is $20, which for an elevator ride is expensive."
,,Good views of singapore,4.0,,"Unfortunately on the night our party visited, only the observation deck was allowed, for non-hotel guests. Hence, the views were restricted. Good thing was that from the observation deck, views of merlion park, the Singapore flyer and the durian were seen. The queues going up and down from the observation decks were long! However, that didn't matter too much, just a heads up. All in all, it was a good experience and was very reasonable for the price of S$20"
,,nice view,3.0,,"looking at all the people swimming in the pool 55 floors up makes you really jelous, next time i visit singapore i know where im staying!"
,,Breathtaking View!,4.0,,Amazing infinity pool! Excellent view of the city from the rooftop at the edge of the Island.
,,What views,5.0,,"Amazing views, try and get a drink in at Ku De Ta which is pricey, but worth the extra. Also by goinbg to ke de ta, you get free entry to the roof, although you cannot go to the rest of the skypark (unless you pay of course) the pool is only for residents of the hotel, and that area is blocked off, but it did look pretty cool. From the bar at the top we could see a great view of where the pits are during the GP."
,,Worth every cent just for the view!,4.0,,"We visted here after going on the Singapore flyer. All I can say is I wish we had come here first... The views are stupendous, and the peak at the infinity pool makes me want to return to stay in the hotel so I can have a swim there! Well worth the time and the money.."
,,What a view,4.0,,A sensational view of the entire city. Can get very warm during the day but is spectacular at night.
,,Fantastic View from the top,4.0,,Ku De Ta bar at the Marina Bay Sands hotel wonderful view of Singapore but the bar is a bit too small when I was there coz they cordon off a private party area and another area is only for member. Walk-in guests have to jostle for space. Many would like to stand at the railings for better view of the night skyline.
,,What's to say - this is it in Singapore!,5.0,,"If you ae in Singapore for even 3 hours, I beg you to take a taxi and pay a visit to the sky park. You see Singapore like you have never seen it before. The view is unlike any other high point in Singapore, because you see the city on one side and you see the wide open see on the other. Much better option than the Singapore eye or flyer which costs much more and the time is limited to one big boring spin. With the sky park, I think you pay $20 and you can spend as much time as you wish!"
,,"Must Do in Singapore - but do not worry, if missed out",3.0,,"This is certainly a must do in Singapore, but if you did not go there - do not worry. Other locations are as good as the Sky Park. Try to be there before 9 PM it is less crowed and there will be no cover charge!"
,,Nice views,4.0,,"Great views of the city and the bay. Don't look down, esp. if you are afraid of heights. It's nice to enjoy the skyline and sunset with a few drinks from one of the two bars by MBS. If you do, bring your wallet. Drinks about S$20 for a small beer on up."
,,Great view of the city,4.0,,"Worth a trip up the elevator to see the city, river and ocean."
,,Best view in town,5.0,,"It's quiet unusual to take a bath in the sky, this is the possibility you have here, with the highest and longest iconic Infinity pool, 57 storeys above the ground. It's only for guests of the hotel but you can cross it if you say you go to the restaurant Sky on 57. From there you can have a 365° view on Singapore and the harbour."
,,Great views of Singapore.,5.0,,The hotel/mall is well worth a visit on the way to the observation deck. Try and visit when the weather is clear. The deck is higher than the Singapore flyer so probably no point in doing both. We visited in the day but it would be very good at night also.
,,A must for all visitors to Singapore,5.0,,"The panoramic view on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is one of Singapore's newest and best attractions. They give you a free headset that explains the different views and you get a great feel for the city state from this vantage point. While you're up there visit the Ku De Ta Bar, which has become one of Singapore's most chic nightspots."
,,Worth the price!,5.0,,Great views of the city. We went just as the sun was setting and stayed until dark.
,,"Beautiful Views, good drinks and food.",5.0,,"Excellent way to see Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia all from one vantage point. This is a great place to take in the wonderful views of Marina Bay, The many ships in Singapore Harbor, The Esplanade, Fullerton Hotel and more. If you have to choose between The Flyer and MBS Skypark, it is Skypark hands down. You stay at the top, there are bathrooms, food, drinks and room to move around. Try to avoid weekends and public holidays and by all means make sure your visit includes the evening. You really must see Singapore lit up!!!!"
,,WAO,4.0,,nice nice nice nice view. beautiful skyline at night. must go!
,,Amazing Views,5.0,,This is a must go to place when visiting Singapore. I went in the evening for drinks and the views are amazing. There is also a light and laser show projected into the bay below.
,,Best view of downtown Singapore,4.0,,"This is the best bang for your buck in terms of nice views in Singapore. It is higher than the Singapore Flyer (which is more costly). On a clear day you can see both Malaysia and Indonesia. Don't forget... there is that fabulous infinity edge pool as well (only to view, not to use). Even SEEING it is fairly exciting! I'd skip the food up top, though. Extremely expensive and really not worth it. Advice: do NOT go on a Sunday or public holiday as it is mobbed and hard to get a good view at the edge."
,,Nice view,5.0,,The view is very awesome..And the pool in the 57th floors and that's the highest pool i ever swim..
,,Nice view but overpriced,3.0,,"You get a good view from the top of the Singapore skyline. However, SkyPark is not among the highest points in Singapore. Sight of other taller buildings in the vicinity slightly diminshes the experience.

Snack bar did not have all the items on the menu, little disappointing for our group.

Price (S$20) is slightly overpriced. Earlier, ticket holding guests had limited acces to other parts of the hotel roof (pool, gardens etc). Now that has been revoked.

Tip: Go to roof top restaurant 'ku de ta' and you get free access to SkyPark! Double benefit at almost the same price that you will pay at the restaurant!"
,,Just average,3.0,,"If you stay at MBS, it is great to see Singapore from hight level especially at night. However if you are not, you have to pay. I don't think it is worth it."
,,Good view and nice atmosphere,5.0,,"Good to be there for once, remarkable buildings. Went there in the afternoon, but I think the best is at night."
,,A must see,5.0,,What a wonderful view - right accross to Indonesia. Also got to see the infinity pool which si almost unbelievable - 55 floors up and what seems like nothing behind the swimmers.
,,A must! - but you must stay at the hotel.,5.0,,"Since we stayed at the hotel, it gave us access without any limits to the stunning pool."
,,Love their Mohitos,5.0,,loved their Mohitos.. though i wont want to stay in MBS again.. too crouded for my taste.. :)
,,Awesome,5.0,,The sands sky park has an awesome view of singapore. If you have not done the singapore flyer then you must do this.
,,Nice view at 56 floors above ground,4.0,,for SG$20 u get to see the the vast singapore metropolis and the main ships in the sea
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Was great to go up to the top, apparently you can go up to the top of a Heli-pad though which is actually higher than the Skypark and they hold parties there every first Thursday of the month."
,,Unbelievable experience,5.0,,We stayed at marina bay sands and the skypark was the main reason. You can spend hours and hours in the infinity pool. The view is great in the sunshine as well as after dark. The skypark also has open air jacuzzis so don't forget to spend some time in them.
,,excellent vist to sky park,5.0,,"excellent place to see singapore better than the london flyer coz much more higher than the london one,, can see indonesia also if weather is clear very close to the singapore formula one circuit"
,,Better than Flyer,4.0,,Very nice view on the observation deck. Recommend to visit at sunset/early night. Higher than Flyer. Admission ticket quite pricey (SGD20). During our visit there is no 15 minutes tour as stated in the website.
,,swimming in SKY,5.0,,it was amazing and great experience looks like swimming in sky and having a nice and superb view across harbour and skyline
,,must see,5.0,,"i stayed in the hotel, sky park amazing. pool amazing. view amazing."
,,Beautiful View of the city,5.0,,A nice hotel with all the facilities as our first visit to the hotal
,,Nice view,5.0,,"We stayed over at MBS in the weekend, swam at the infinity pool. The view was amazing!!! However, the pool is actually divided up into 25m segments and very croweded, can't swim far, good for a soak. The staff around the pool are very attentive and friendly. Love the bubbly jacuzzi too :) Would I pay $17 to just go up for the view? may be... But Would I stay in MBS again, definitely :D"
,,Fabulous!!!!,5.0,,Great swim and location. Views spectacular. access free with club rooms.
,,We got our refund,3.0,,"It was really a bad timing to visit Skypark last weekend as it was pouring rain every night. We booked for the 9pm tour which was cancelled (we had waited almost 1/2 day for it). Fortunately the staff was nice and refunded our money.

Morning view was not bad, but bet the night view will be much better. Downside, they cancelled the morning and afternoon tours so we were not able to visit the pool and restaurant area :(."
,,What a view!,5.0,,"There is no question - this is the best view Singapore has to offer. With shops, bars and even a vicarious swim in the glorious infinity pool (if you're not a guest of the hotel, all you can do is watch) the ambiance up there is wonderful. It costs a bit to go up to the viewing deck (about $20SING per person) which for a family can get quite steep, but I enjoyed immensely and didn't regret the spend."
,,Unexpectedly good,4.0,,"I thought this would be a boring place with so-so views, but I was wrong. The views are amazing. Well worth the trip up and the price. Though I wish they'd put a more casual and affordable dining place to have coffee or a snack will enjoying the view. I haven't been up at night though, so that could be even better. Also maybe they could put some awning for when it is raining."
,,What a view...,5.0,,"If you want to see for miles then take a tip to the 58th floor at SkyPark for amazing views, relax with a glass of wine, it was wonderful. All glass sides so you need a head for heights or you may find a problem. Costs 20 Singapore dollars for the lift."
,,Nice but not great,3.0,,"Been there a few times. It started out well but it is now more of a restricted area and the only area that is free for visitors without reservation is full with people taking pictures of each other. Too many security guards, too many private functions. Not fun at all. Drinks are ok but nothing special. Nice view but there are better places in Singapore to go for view and drinks."
,,Greetings from 57th florey !,5.0,,"A must do... you can't go to Paris without climbing on Eiffel Tower, so you can't visit Singapore without experiencing this view. And if you stay at MBS hotel, the infinity pool is awesome."
,,Awesome Pool,4.0,,Unique pool and quite extra-ordinary feeling that you are swimming to the edge of falling down off from the pool.
,,awesome views,5.0,,"I thought this was going to be better and at S$20 its cheaper than to go on the stupid London eye's copy of Singapore. The Sky park is much taller than the singapore flyer and overlooks all 3 main directions of Singaproe and the bay area and you can stay there for long as you like unlike the wheel. I would recommend going at sun set so you get glimpses of day time views as well as fantastic night time views. There is a bar up there too, perhaps expensive."
,,great views,4.0,,Even better now that they let you pop in to the pool area for photos and a look around - an amazing pool garden area. Great views but little else as yet. Worth a look for the wow factor
,,Great view but not value for money,3.0,,"Don't bother to go up there if it is not free! If u are thirsty, the drinks there are also expensive!

Paid so much for only a 10 minute view.. Nothing to do except to look at the outside view. I took some panoramic view though but that's all I can think of doing."
,,nice place,4.0,,paid $20 SGD to get to the top. cannot access pool area though. was a nice view. probably only stayed 20 minutes there but worth it i guess
,,You have just got to visit,5.0,,"and see what genius modern architects have. Don't bother to go up to the Observation Deck, rather take the lift to the Bar where you have the same view but you can have a sit down and a drink.
In such a sophisticated place I wanted to be really grown up so I drank my first Martini - a Grey Goose with Lychee, now isn't that just the perfect way to see all of Singapore and the hundreds of ships out at sea ... or was that double Martini vision?"
,,Worth the S$20.00 per person for the view.,5.0,,The full name is Skypark Marina Bay Sands. Three towers with a cruise ship built on top. Brilliant pictures taken at night. Along with a few hundred other tourists.
,,Nice experience,4.0,,Love the design and the exhilarating feel at the top. The price is kinda expensive though.... :)
,,Super food,4.0,,I loved the sky and food. Suggest yo get a table near the right hand side view - it looks good
,,Sands,5.0,,"incredible though this is, it will be overtaken in the wow factor but the Gardens in the Bay domes when they open in mid 2012. They were opened for one week for the world orchid conference. A new world highlight."
,,Awesome night view from roof top,5.0,,"Hotel guests access for free to both ends of the sky park. Public pays SGD25 (and still need to queue) to access one end of the roof.
The public area has a restaurant. View from there would be Singapore Flyer, Maritime Museum and the ships docked at the pier."
,,Meh,3.0,,I'd do the Flyer over this one. The queues to get a ticket to get on the lift to go up can be horrendous. Too many people let up to the skypark at once so it can be pretty hard to take a decent photo. Go to the Flyer or walk up the Marina Barrage instead.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The views from the ""boat"" are spectacular. As one would expect the bar is very expensive but worth the visit. The pool is not available to anyone who is not a hotel guest but it's still an amazing thing to see."
,,better views that the flyer,5.0,,amazing skyline and better views that from the singapore flyer. also rest kudeta was nice. really cool place to check out the whole of singapre.
,,Incredible View!,5.0,,To really enjoy you need to be a Hotel Guest and spend time at Pool. View is really amazing!
,,Too ordinary,3.0,,"Lucky me, I got free access to enter Sky Park because my friends stayed there and I went into the hotel-guest-area. It's different from the general visitor area. In hotel guest area, there's a swimming pool with a great city view from high above. We can swim there, ah relaxing! When I enter the general visitor area, it's only an empty area, I think with S$20 it's not worthed, except you do really like to take photos there."
,,Amazing aerial view of Singapore,4.0,,"Great to see the city of Singapore spread below and around you. Once you get up there, there is nowhere to sit in the shade and admire the outlook unless you make use of one of the restaurants."
,,Expensive,4.0,,"The view is spectacular, but the ticket is expensive for a few photos from there!"
,,Great views out day or night,4.0,,Have been a few times and you can't get over the setting. Have not done the full-tour round but been to the bar which seems better value for money. Recommend a glass of champagne which seems to be quite reasonable amongst the expensive drinks
,,Excellent view,5.0,,"One thing that i have to say is that, you should try this place. No words to describe, just feel it."
,,Still selling ticket during rainning day without informing the guest.,1.0,,after buying the ticket and come up to sky park found that is rainning. we have to stand under the rain and there is limited room for us. why the service staff selling tickets didnt inform is rainning. our money all wasted. very bad service.
,,Views are amazing,4.0,,Again a great spot to take amazing pcitures of Singapore. At 9pm there is a tour where you cna see the swimming pool and roof gardens. Worth to join. I was disappointed that the roof restaurant does not have a Singapore Sling. I was hoping to get one there and drink it on the roof of Singapore. Also do not miss the laser show which is I guess each evening around 8-9 pm. Totally amazing.
,,Loved Sands SkyPark,5.0,,"This was our first stop on our trip around Singapore. It costs 20SGD's to go up to the Viewing platform or alternatively you can ask to use the bar at the top and just pay for a drink which is 20SGD's but a cocktail always goes down well with a view like that. We also used the Casino which is quite tense and had dinner, a must do attraction in Singapore"
,,Beautiful view of the city,3.0,,No seating area...no shaded area to shield visitors from the scorching sun or rain.
,,Whatttt?,1.0,,"The queue was so long. It's like the long and winding road. Just pray it doesn't lead you off the edge! I wasn't sure who had it worse, the gawkers (i.e. visitors) or the gawked (hotel guests). Very disturbing and surreal."
,,Amazing Views from an Amazing Piece of Architecture,4.0,,"The Marina Bay Sands SkyPark is an exemplary way to see Singapore from up high.

After you've paid for your ticket, you will take an elevator up to the 57th floor. While walking down the steps, you will see the remarkable financial district of Singapore. Take a nice panoramic shot of the staggering skyline. However, you will most likely not realise that you are making your way out onto a 200 foot cantilever which has nothing under it.

After you take pictures and soak in the breathtaking views, you can take a tour (which is paid for in advance) that will show you the bit that usually is only accessible to hotel guests. You will see the remarkable ""infinity"" pool and also the rest of the SkyPark.

I would recommend this attraction to a friend that has no fear of heights.

There really isn't much to say; it's just something you have to experience to understand."
,,Sands def worth a visit.,5.0,,Amazing views and hotel. Went to see the Lion King here too and that was great also.
,,"Hazy Day, but nice views",4.0,,"If you can, go on a clear day. It was a very hazy day when we went, but the views are amazing (could only imagine what it would be like on a clear day!!!)
To walk around the pool, you have to pay an additional fee and go at night."
,,Must See,5.0,,One of the Top must do things in Singapore. Once you are up there look at all the smiles on every bodies face and you to will feel like a kid again swimming on the edge.
,,The best view of Singapore,5.0,,A trully awesome experience with a view from the 150m long infinity pool into Singapore.
,,Go to the observation deck,5.0,,"Unbelievable views and great pictures at night. Luckily, we had no wind, clear sky and warm temp."
,,Excellent view!!,5.0,,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and loved it! Such a great experience, the view was amazing!! My chidren enjoyed it too!"
,,Another must see in Singapore,5.0,,"Has an observation deck, bar, restaurant and most importantly the worlds highest infinity pool. Even if you only have a short time in Singapore, it's surely worth your time to check it out."
,,not worth the money,3.0,,"a little overpriced and can be very crowded, not as good now that you cannot go the the infinity pool."
,,Don't forget your camera!,4.0,,"OK, so you have to pay to get to the top, but it's worth it. My wife isn't too good with heights, and was clinging to may arm so tightly for most of the visit that it was beginning to turn blue, but she would not have missed it for anything.

The views from the top are absolutely spectacular - the new downtown business area, the harbours, the new riverside entertainment area, the old city. You can see it all from here.

Take a cocktail at the bar to steady the nerves."
,,Drink at Ku De Ta,5.0,,Brilliant view but drinks very expensive . Quietest lifts I have ever been in
,,Over crowded public bath......with a view to kill,2.0,,"The view is impressive, hopefully you will have a clear day. But other than that....it really is crowded. I would NEVER place my toe in the pool. G_d alone knows what goes on under the surface with all the crowds. The toilets are filthy! And if you look at the infrastructure, its grotty! Go for the view if you have to but then leave. There are much better places in Singapore to catch a site of the island."
,,Skypark,5.0,,This is similar to Singapore Flyer. Nice place to see the surrounding area and relax with a drink on the top. The drinks are not that expensive considering either.
,,Nice view and nothing else,4.0,,Spent there about twenty minutes to look around. Great view. I would say it is worth to go.
,,Great View,5.0,,The infinity pool is so cool with spectacular views.
,,What a spectacular view!,5.0,,"Me and my wife were visiting Singapore for the very first time. As soon as we arrived, we quickly decided to go to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

Upon reaching the Sands SkyPark, we immediately went to see the Singaporean skyline and its surrounding areas.

The park is well secured, clean, and you are assured that everything are in its place. Plus it is very safe despite of its altitude.

Definitely will visit this place again."
,,Best View EVER,5.0,,Never enjoyed a drink with such a magnificent view.
,,SUPERB,5.0,,What can I say. What a place to visit. Worth a wee trip here just to see the sites.
,,OK - be careful of the weather. A bit disorganized,3.0,,"We felt conned into buying the tickets for the 'tour' at 2pm since we could see the pool. It started to rain and we all got rather wet - understandable and expected, but a full 12 minutes after the tour was supposed to start some kid comes up and tells us it is cancelled. It was fairly chaotic since only one elevator would go back down, and there was no one communicating much to anyone. Don't buy the tour tickets. Just go to Ku De Ta and get a drink/app if you want toe sights."
,,Sky Park,1.0,,"On the 26th October my husband and I visited the Sky Park with two Australian friends. As we had visited previously we were excited to show our Australian friends the Sky Park. On arriving we purchased four senior tickets at $35 (sing) and preceed to the top in the lift only to find that it was raining heavily. Due to the rain all the tourists were crushed together under what little shelter there was and we could not go onto the viewing deck. The pool area was also closed and we were refused entry by the security staff. We immediately returned to the ticket office and requested a refund and was denied. The Supervisor asked us to come back to the desk in 20 minutes as she was waiting for an email from Hotel Manager to confim a refund. As it was still raining heavily we noticed that the staff were still selling tickets to unsuspecting tourists. On returning to the desk were told that no email had come from hotel management and no refund would be given. I was disgusted with the outcome and will not be recommending this landmark - and to all other tourists don't go there on a wet day as you will do your money cold - you cannot see a thing. They don't care who's money they take as long as they get it.

,,Great view - free of charge,5.0,,"The SkyPark and the pool area are not accessible to the public anymore, but you can access the terrace. There are two ways to get up there: pay somewhat around 20 SGD and access the terrace or don't pay and visit the restaurant which is actually one level higher up. The view is great and you will have a 360 degree sight of Singapore."
,,Can see forever when up there,5.0,,"Awesome views, worth the hassle of tickets, traveling through the crowds of snobs."
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,Great views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands over Singapore. We were going to stay for the tour too (free) where you see the famous pool but it was so hot and had to wait for another hour
,,AMAZING!!,5.0,,One of the highlights of our trip. The view is out of this world and we went on a Sunday night and were lucky enough to score a table outside. Only glass between you and the Marina.. The cocktails were also fabulous!
,,What a view!,5.0,,Glad we visited the SkyPark. Amazing view from 57th floor. Fast lifts. Amazing open swimming pool on top floor which appeared to flow right to the edge. Unfortunately only residents can use the pool.
,,"Good view, add a cocktail at Ku De Ta to enhance it!",4.0,,"Definitely exceeded my expectations as I expected the observation deck for non hotel guests to be small. View is also better than expected and yes I echo the recommendation to go around 5.45-6.30pm.

It is like the Top of the Rock (rockefeller centre) experience in New York but with a nice bar/restaurant on the observation centre where me and my friend had dinner. The restaurant was nothing to rave about and definitely over priced but its was nice and cliched a little to have a cocktail to go with the views. Otherwise there are snacks and drinks to be purchased as well. It costs about SGD 20.

Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I do it again? No. Once is enough. Would I recommend it to visitors to Singapore? Yes."
,,View is Unique,3.0,,"Otherwise, it is just another crowded rooftop bar and pool"
,,What a View,4.0,,"The view from the top is staggering, aim to go just before the light dims and stay until it's dark. The photo opportunities are great and you can enjoy a beer as you wait."
,,What a view,5.0,,Best view in Singapore lovely chilling by the pool during the day and spectacular at night.
,,Best views!,4.0,,Even on an overcast day you get fab views up on the observation desk. $20 gets you 15 mins. Plenty of shops and eateries at the Marina Sands
,,No words for this,5.0,,"Just wow..... The most amazing swimming pool ever. Its an infinity pool, a breathtaking experience overall. Theere is a pub, jacuzzi and all on the top, the water is also exceptionally clean and the people around are also great. Excellent staff behaviour"
,,Over Hypedplace,3.0,,The place looks great from outside but if you stay there the quality of service is bad bad bad. Food takes 45-60 mins to arrive and housekeeping looks confused. The only good thing is Casino where again its not of the quality of Macau as the tables are too crowded.
,,"Nice view, worth doing once",4.0,,"Went there on a slightly windy afternoon, and it is qutie a nice view. Not sure it is really worth 20S$, but having a drink at the bar on top was a nice experience. I might go there again to have dinner at the restaurant to see the night view."
,,A place to get a view,4.0,,"It's on the 57th floor, if I remember exactly. A great place for city viewing. If only S'pore was not a concrete jungle."
,,Nothing great!,3.0,,"Nothing great about it, only it's on top of the building, 57th floor"
,,One of the best and lavish places you can treat yourself to,4.0,,I loved the ambiance of the skylark. It is so well built and so lavish that everyone should visit at least once to experience.
,,Amazing boat in the sky!,4.0,,It was a pity that access to the gardens and pool was not available. The view of course is amazing and one wonders at the work involved in creating this 'boat in the sky'. We liked sitting in the bar and seeing the clouds gather over the city (especially when the rain came after we left). The service was pleasant and efficient.
,,Sands Sky Park,5.0,,"Brilliant, fantastic a must! The inifinity pool is amazing although it is better if you are staying; it did help that the F! took place the weekend we were there."
,,Amazing view of Singapare,5.0,,The ticket to get on top of the Sands Marina Bay Hotel with the excellent view is not cheap but in my opinion it is worth the money. One has an excellent view over Singapore. If you go around sundown you can see Singapore at day and night. It is very busy up there but there were no significant delays when using the elevators up and down. The pool can only be used by hotel guests and if you want to have a drink or some food in the restaurant at the top make sure you are not wearing short pants and sneakers as the doormen check your outfit.
,,Amazing views !,5.0,,"I didn't really go to the skypark but did go to the top of the building to catch the views from the top of this Modern Marvel. You can either pay $20 to go to the top, or, if you are eating at the restaurant/bar at the top, you can go up for free. Either way, make sure you go to the top. You can see the Straits of Malacca, Indonesia and Malaysia from the roof, as well as perfect views of Singapore."
,,Singapore Bird View,4.0,,It costs SGD 20 actually there is nothing you can do up to there except enjoy Singapore city view and it is quite lovely. There is a restaurant but not sure about its pricing. You can't enter the swimming pool area unless you are staying at MBS hotel.
,,A little expensive,4.0,,Had drinks and a meal - if going to the viewing platform say you are going for a drink - get up free and pay for the drink - a cheaper option
,,Pool in the sky,5.0,,"What a fantastic swim, on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands, great views and great service and great photos"
,,Birdseye view of the city,5.0,,"What a shame you can not get into that pool up there, what a view. It's a bit of a hike fro the MRT station in the heat but well worth it."
,,"Impressive construction, great views",4.0,,We had dinner at Ku De Ta bar and restaurant. Very nice and up scale place. Prepare your wallet! Nice spot for taking some cool pics of SNG at night. It's an icon in the city that you can't miss
,,"Great views for free, but expensive drinks if you visit the bar",4.0,,"You can ride up to the 57th floor for free and taek a look from the viewing platform, but if you do visit the bar, sit down before checking out the cocktail menu"
,,Beautiful view during the night,4.0,,"This was my 2nd visit as a hotel guest to SkyPark. The previous 1st visit was in the day and I did not manage to view the whole area, as it was rather warm and humid in the day.
2nd visit was done in the night and I am glad that I am up in the park. The night view was very beautiful especially when you are standing at the observation deck, where you could see both the city and sea view at a great distance.
It was rather crowded during my visit, but manageable, as now they are controlling the non-hotel guest going up. Better organize as conducted tour group being done.
It is a good place to take pictures if you do not mind people walking and crowding around the deck area.
It is a place you should pay a visit, especially at night, to view the scenery of Singapore skyline."
,,Great Views of Singapore,5.0,,Great views over all of Singapore and a pleasant way to spend an hour or two.
,,Expensive,5.0,,Probably worth a visit but bear in mind that the staff keep you well away from the affinity pool and other guest areas
,,A bit tricky,4.0,,We had trouble finding how to get up to the skypark. Awesome views once we got there though.
,,"Amazing views, interesting structure",4.0,,"I probably was more interested in the ""ship on top of the buildings"" because I saw it on one of those Mega Builder shows. The views are amazing but it is just an observation deck! You do get a glimpse on the infinity pool but that area is limited to the hotel guests. Seeing the entire Marina Bay Sands complex was worth the walk from the MRT station in the heat! Very upscale mall, casino, museum, theaters, gondola rides, hotels, etc. I was glad we went and I have great video footage of Singapore from the top."
,,Great views of Singapore,5.0,,"I loved the views from the top and took videos and photos. You see all of Singapore and the incredible modern skyline of this city peppered by construction cranes all over. The sea port is full of vessels and I have never seen so many together. Spectacular.
I paid $SG 20 for the visit and it was worth it. The elevator takes you to the 57th floor in 25 seconds and you do not even notice you are moving.

The hotel itself is grandiose ""a la Vegas"" and the shops inside are a must-see. Louis Vuitton, Prada, Hermes, Bulgari, Rolex, everywhere and in all shapes. A super giant mall of marble and Western brands.

Go see!"
,,Sky on 57,5.0,,"A great place to have a drink with friends. The whole of Sky on 57 is a room with a view, whether you're having a drink, or in the jacuzzi or in the pool. Incredible."
,,View from here is fantastic,4.0,,Great place for photos and viewing the city. Lunch in the restaurant next to the Olympic size pool is definitely worth having.
,,What a view,5.0,,"A bit on the expensive side as the 20 singapore dollars did also get you a swim in the infinity pool up to the end of september 2011. The pool is no longer available and is for hotel guests only, but the price of the sky deck remained the same. That aside the view is amazing and makes for some wonderful photos."
,,Limited Viewing Area Is Disappointing...,3.0,,"Concessions tickets if you are over 55!! Slightly disappointed because the are open to the public is limited, feature like the Infinity pool are only open to residents of the hotel itself....Still worth a visit for the view...."
,,Good if limited,4.0,,"Paying for a visit to the observation deck of the MBS will only let you access the observation deck. From here there are some great views weather permitting so only go up on a clear day or evening. You will only have a partial view of the extraordinary infinity pool and not from a good angle as you won't get that ""infinity"" illusion."
,,Infinity Pool!!!,5.0,,"If we knew about this Hotel, we would have stayed here! The views are simply majestic!! And the pool is unbelievable -"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"Get to the top of the worlds most insane hotel and see the view! We went up right before sunset, amazing views over the whole bay and city. A little expensive we felt but worth it in the end."
,,Worth a look!,5.0,,"Whilst I thought 20 Singapore dollars each was quite expensive to go up to the top of this amazing building, it is definately worth it. The view is fantastic and its quite a thrill to be standing on a boat like area on the top of 3 buildings. Best on a clear sunny day."
,,Heavenly if you're staying in the hotel,4.0,,"The SkyPark with its infinity pool in the sky is truly breath-taking. The staff are unremittingly friendly and the service is excellent. Don't go there hoping to swim, though, because the pool is busy with people enjoying the 1.2m depth with their cameras.

If you don't have your swimwear with you, there is a clever feature: a couple of pool areas with only shin-deep water where visitors can roll up their trousers and walk to the edge (where there is a glass protective barrier) to take the essential photos to prove they were there!

There are bars and restaurants in the SkyPark but I believe some of them are available only to residents in a minimum standard of room. We only used the poolside service for snacks and drinks, and the food, drink and service were all superb. The serving staff and life guards are really friendly and happy to chat.

I believe it's possible for people who aren't staying in the hotel to pay a fee to visit the SkyPark. I don't know how those people are identified, but I can imagine they might not have the same privileges or receive the same effusive welcome and sterling service."
,,A stunning experience,5.0,,"The views from the top of the Skypark are unbelievable and it is definately a ""must see"""
,,Does it get any bigger than this?,5.0,,"We were a bit apprehensive at first to go up to the top thinking it would be another revenue raising for a hotel. Well let me tell you we were pleasantly surprised. Do yourself a favour and find some doco on the whole making and putting together of MBS. It is an architectural masterpiece and very pleasing to the eye. Once we took the whole 3 seconds to get to the top we were greeted by staff who usher you out to the deck. WOW.....it is magnificent and so tastefully finished. Depending on what day you visit you are allowed access to the pool area but you must remain behind the rope at all times as the pool area is reserved for guests. The infinity pool is beautiful to say the least and again the attention to detail with the palm trees, foliage and spas make it a truly spectacular place to visit. We were glad that we took both boys ages 12 & 11 up to see this magnificent structure."
,,Not friendly!,2.0,,"Visited the Sands Sky Park and felt like people were being treated with disdain.
After much ado about going there and charging $20, one cannot have a drink unless they are dressed formally - we had come for the F1 on holiday....thus could not go to KUDETA Restaurant....the attitude of the Security made one feel very unwelcome....the Singapore Flyer is a much better location to view and see Singapore in its glory!"
,,Not worth the money,2.0,,"Very impressive from the ground and a magnificant site as you walk around singapore. However, when you get there it is expensive just to see some views of Singapore ($20 each). Unless you are a resident you cannot use the infinity pool (& if you are would you really want a lot of tourists staring at you!). The helix bridge across is quite cool but when you arrive the resort itself is very expensive. If I were to return to Singapore I would not come back here."
,,Seeing is believing,5.0,,"The scale and outrageousness of the Sands Skypark complex makes it a must-visit attraction. The trip to the top does not come cheap, but the view makes it worth while - bring a camera. Afterwards, we took a boat trip up the river to Clarke Quay which was a great way of seeing the City."
,,We stayed one night so we could swim in the pool,5.0,,My children (three teenagers) really wanted to swim in this pool and the only way to do this was spend the night so we spent the last night of a seven night stay in singapore there. We stayed in a premier room (that was all that was available) - beautiful! The pool was excellent - not for a seven day stay but for one night to swim at 10pm looking out over Singapore at night - MAGIC!! The kids and I loved it...well worth the money as we will probably never do anything like that again
,,I am like a bird,4.0,,You get a fantastic bird's eye view from this place and standing up on the roof of this amazing architectural piece in itself is a great feeling.You can take some good shots of the city. They even have a bar and a restaurant on top where you can have your meal.Make sure you go there on a sunny day coz to get the best view of the city.
,,Yes good views- but worth $ 20? Felt sorry for the hotel guests,3.0,,"Family of 4 would cost you $ 80. I agree the vista is very nice and you get a bird's eye view of a large section of Singapore. But it's just a viewing area with no place to sit and no shade. 5-10 minutes is enough.
The prices at the restaurant is astronomical. $ 9 for a cup of iced coffee! We also went to the swimming pool ( as far as they would allow you) and I'd hate to be a guest in that hotel and pay steep price and have practically no privacy and finding my way in my swimming trunk through hundreds of on lookers. But the view from the infinity pool was great."
,,Highly recommend going for the views alone,4.0,,"This wasn't the most exciting thing I've ever done but I'm so glad I did it and would have felt really gutted if I'd missed out.

Just walking up to the huge structures across the equally interesting bridge was pretty amazing. Even the views here are amazing but once you get to the top it just gives you a whole different perspective of Singapore and to see all around you is pretty cool.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore, it might all be over pretty quick but it's still worth it!"
,,Must do when visiting Singapore,4.0,,Really nice view of the city from the top and that pool is amazing. Ask for directions on how to find it as it may not be obvious.
,,Wonderful views of downtown Singapore,4.0,,"The best time to visit Marina Bay Sands Skypark, as with the Singapore Flyer, is between 6.30pm and 7.30pm, so one can catch the transition of the city's skyline from daylight to dusk and night; at the same time avoiding the searing UV radiation from the tropical sunshine during an afternoon visit. I visited for the first time last year in the evening and was blown away by the wonderful view of Singapore's cityscape. I enjoyed myself thoroughly and deemed the skypark worthy of a repeat visit, but was wary of feedback that the teeming crowds at the Skypark had recently gotten worse.

To avoid having elbow room only, I decided to pay a little more to hit the observation deck in style by doing a three course lunch at 'Sky on 57 Restaurant' by paying about USD50 where I could take in the fabulous views at leisure. The trade-off is not having 'two (views) for one price' i.e. day view and night view if our Skypark visit was at the 'optimal' time of 6.30pm through 8pm. The tasty lunch more than made up for it. We had a choice of western cuisine or Singaporean cuisine with a fusion twist. I picked the local pork rib consomme and barramundi, with green tea creme brulee for dessert, while my companion had the duck confit from the western selection, fish curry with rice from the Singapore selection and sorbet for dessert. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and decided that doing lunch was better value than just paying an entrance fee for standing room only, With a restaurant reservation, we avoided the 'regular' queue and also got to visit an area of the Skypark that is closed to the non-hotel guest visitors."
,,"Breathtaking View, especially at Sunset",5.0,,"If you want to experience a truly unforgettable sunset, I would definitely recommend going to the Marina bay sands Sky park. At first I was hesitant to pay the $20 to just go see the infinity pool and the view, but i think it was totally worth it. The only depressing part is the pool is so lovely and extensive, you definitely feel like jumping right in and end up envying the guests who are tanning or swimming around the edges. If you are in Singapore, do not miss this opportunity - standing on top of a hotel on a boat on the edge of a pool!!! If you can afford it definitely book the hotel, even though the visitors only have access to one area of the pool, there is quite a bit you can see. After 10pm no visitors are allowed so i would imagine that would be the perfect time to be up there living on the edge!!!"
,,Expensive but stunning views !,4.0,,"80,- SGD for whole family is not very cheap for afternoon ""trip by hotel lift"", but we parents and children were fully satisfied. View is really stunning, especially at sunset, glass plates and trees block wind blasts. You can avoid all tricks, recomended by taxidrivers to go by ticket office: last ticket check is at upper terrace itself :-)"
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"Good:
The hotel and the views are certainly impressive.

Not so good:
When we walked through the door to buy our tickets we were rushed up to the counter by a staff member (we have no idea what the rush was about because it wasn't busy). When we requested our tickets from the man behind the counter he put a lot of pressure on us to also buy tickets to a show that was on at the hotel. He didn't want to give up and we had to say 'no thank you' twice before he finally gave us the tickets we came for.

The deck area seems to be all concrete, wood, glass, glare and is unbelievably hot. There is also no shade so we walked the deck, took some photos and moved on quickly.

If we had chosen a different time of day our experience may have been more enjoyable. We have been to Singapore four times and most things we would do over and over but I doubt we will try this one again."
,,"Pleasantly surprised by view. However, name is misleading.",4.0,,"Overall, for one of the best views of Singapore I highly recommend the Sands SkyPark. However, I'm deducting one point from my rating since as a non-guest, you don't really go to a 'skypark' but rather an observation deck. It's basically the equivalent of New York's Empire State Building.

However, if you're a guest of the hotel I would call this a skypark. You get access to the amazing looking infinity pool (largest in the world I've heard), much more area to roam around, and probably even better views.

For $20 it was worth it, but definitely would not need to do this again."
,,"NIce views, but the Flyer is better value for money",3.0,,"We went to both the Flyer and the SkyPark during our recent trip.

I think it was ~$30 for a trip to the top. What isnt overly clear is that you only get access to about 10% of the roof, and have to squint to get a tiny view of the infinite pool (for the hotel residents). The views are nice, but pretty much the same as the Flyer which is only about $20.

Definitely do one of these attractions, but no need to do both."
,,"Amazing building, a visit to view the Casino is a must",5.0,,Dont forget to take your passport with you to enter casino or you will need to pay Sing$100. If you visit the skypark on a weekend (57th floor) the gardens and pool cannot be visited. (cost Sing$20).
,,Amazing View of Singapore - well worth the visit,5.0,,"It isnt cheap to get to the top viewing area - but it is worth the cost. It is higher than the Singapore Flyer. We bought our tickets when we got there as the online ticketing seemd to want to know what date and time you were getting there. With unpredictable weather - we didnt want to end up with tickets that we couldnt use. It was easy to get tickets once we found the entrance to Sky Park.
There is a very expensive restaurant on level 57 - but on the viewing deck there is a little bar next to the souvenir stand that sells hotdogs and drinks.
The website stated that"" members of the public will be able to access and view part of the swimming pool deck adjacent to the Public Observation Deck"" - we thought that we would be able to get closer to the pool area - but we could only see it though a glass security door."
,,Must-go when the sun is about to set...makes you feel you're one with the city!,5.0,,Plan the trip ahead as there are a lot of tourists who usually go up to the sky park. What I did was I bought the ticket together with the ticket museum - its cheaper and more convenient. Do not be in a hurry when you visit. It's good to just take it all in and enjoy the view. It's a time to relax the mind and spirit and just have that quiet moment...
,,Worth paying $ to get the best view,5.0,,"We got there after 9pm on a Friday night and the whole area leading up to Marina Bay Sands is beautifully lit up.
After walking around we decided to go up for the best view of Singapore.
There are 6 people in our group ranging from little children to grand parents in 80's everyone enjoyed the experience even though we had only half an hour to explore.
Plan your time to go early!
It was worth paying."
,,INTERESTING PLACE TO SEE ALL OF SINGAPORE HARBOUR,5.0,,"It is quite expensive to go up to the top - $10 Singapore dollars each. However, the view is wonderful. You only get a rather obscure view of the infinity pool though."
,,Great view for the tourist but I felt for the hotel guests who have their privacy invaded.,4.0,,"Unfortunately as much as I love the Marina Bay Sands building as a piece of wonderful modern architecture, I am pleased we did not stay there on our recent trip to Singapore as even the Reception Area for the hotel was basically a public thoroughfare to gain access to the shopping plaza. The Skypark afforded a wonderful view of Singapore however I felt sorry for the hotel guests who had a myriad of onlookers while they were trying to enjoy much of the infinity pool."
,,Very expensive - not worth the money.,3.0,,"Although the views are good, at S$20 each it's a lot to pay and we've seen much better for free! We also had a drink in the restaurant but didn't look at the prices first - big mistake, as a glass of wine and a bottle of beer cost S$50! Go to the top of the Swisshotel instead - it's higher, free and the drinks are normal prices!"
,,Amazing View,4.0,,View and $ better than flyer. It was then possible to walk around the skypark pool area (cannot use it unless you are a resident). Make sure you visit on a bright afternoon and stay till late evening
,,Great view of the Marina Bay and surrounding areas,4.0,,"If you have time and its your first time in singapore, then going to sands skypark will certainly be a great experience. For one going to MBS itself is truly an experience with the architecture of such an amazing building and then building able to go up to check out the views. I know for sure per night would at least by 400$ singapore or more.

So we booked our tickets online just so we didn't have to buy it there and we just went to the office to collect tickets & catch the lift up to the top. When you get to the top, you get a good view of the marina and the back side as well too. We went during the morning and it was a nice sunny day to take photos.

Because your at the end of the top section, the middle part is where the pool is which you can see but there are guests there swimming and it would be awesome just swimming there with the view of the marina - wish you could buy a swimming pass but its only for guests only.

So we took our photos and once satisfied, we went downstairs to our next destination. We stayed for about 30 minutes and i think 30 minutes is suffice to take in the views and look around at the top."
,,Well worth a visit if you can afford it,4.0,,"We visited the SkyPark towards the end of a few weeks in Asia, which also included a visit to Petronas Towers in KL. The SkyPark experience was not disappointing and much easier than the chaos we had to endure lining up at petronas.

The entrance is easily found and at $20S it is a reasonable cost (unlike Petronas you are not time limited once you are up there)

On top there are amazing views, and if you are thirsty (and rich) you can even enjoy a cocktail, beer or meal on top. Beware though these are expensive. A cocktail and pint of beer cost is $S36

On the $20 ticket you can ander about half the length of the top skydeck. You need to look though for the connection to the main skydeck viewing area to the swimming pool etc. It is subtely hidden and I am sure many people leave without seeing everything

in short, worth a visit"
,,Great views,5.0,,We went to the top of the Marina Bay Sands and it was great to see the city from up there. The sky was clear so you could see quite far. The bar at the top is also nice. We made great photos and spent 45 minutes looking up at everything. We did not try the swimming pool for lack of time but next time we will! It looks great!
,,Go in the evening.,3.0,,"For many, a trip to the top of the Marina Bay Sands will be a must do. So this review will mainly be to optimize that experience. I went during the day, and it was very hot. Screens were up along the pools for guest privacy, so the famous view of the city behind the infinity pool was obstructed. Also, you feel like a peeping Tom, not supposed to be there. As far as views to, a similar view is available from the Singapore Flyer. For night time views, which I think are more dramatic anyway, I believe that the pool screens are down. If I were to go, again, I would time it with the nightly MBS light show. If you have the time catch the first show from the bottom, and the second show from the top. As far as views of the city go, there are similar views from all over, example, from the Esplanade Walk, and from a Singapore River bumboat ride. Take the river cruise at 7:00 pm for the best time of day light conditions."
,,What a view,5.0,,Paid the $20 to enjoy a Singapore sunset from the skypark deck. We had a cocktail at the 'Ku da Ta'Bar which was a great spot to enjoy the sun setting over the infinity pool. I was disappointed that only hotel guests get to use the infinity pool - but it is certainly understandable.
,,Aerial view of Singapore,3.0,,"S$20 per person and you are up at top of one of the famous hotels and landmark of Singapore. Because we decided to go to observation deck we entered this marvelous architectural work or we would have just seen it from Merlion park.

The hotel interior is very good and nearby place is also very well developed. Pay for observation deck and catch the elevator it hardly takes 10 seconds to reach the top on 56th floor. Take a view of Singapore and you can see some big rises, Singapore Flyer, theater, etc.

We were lucky that we were allowed to go through swimming pool area which is restricted to hotel guest only, and the view was much better from swimming pool and people were really enjoying it.

Overall it's worth a watch ones when in Singapore."
,,"Up, up and away!",4.0,,"We wanted to have a good view of Singapore. We were thinking of doing this via the Singapore Flyer. As we have done the London Eye previously and as we were visiting the Sands hotel, we decided to abruptly go to the Skypark instead.

The entrance fee is $20, which can add up as there were four of us but in return, you get outstanding 360 degrees views of Singapore.

There is a superfast elevator to the 56th floor and you are then free to wander around taking snapshots. Part of the pool area is out of bounds to give hotel guest’s privacy and there is of course no sneaking in neither for a quick jump in the pool.

There is construction work going on in the Marina area so the area is being developed. You can see the Singapore flyer next to it and of course can glimpse part of the F1 circuit as well.

It does seem strange wandering around whilst hotel guests are having fun in the infinity pool. After we descended, we went on to the nearby shopping mall."
,,Only for the view.,3.0,,"My companion is disabled. Cannot do stairs. We were not advised that she would not be able to see the swimming pool - only available by a long flight of stairs when you are just doing the $20 visit. When I asked how the disabled would be able to see the pool, I was advised that they would have to stay at the hotel! So, great views of Singapore and surrounds, but disappointing that only half the space was available to my friend."
,,best view of SG,5.0,,"i was staying in Sands Marina with a friend and my husband for a short vacation, as a hotel guest, you get free access to the Skypark (non-hotel guests pays a small fee)-- this place offers a great view of the city!
simply amazing.. i loved it more at night!
they have an infinity pool and it's warm during the night!
overall, a really nice Singapore attraction to visit & experience!"
,,Tacky and expensive,3.0,,"Impressive from a distance and from the ground looking up for sure, and the views are amazing and 360...however one feels like a poor relation doing the $20 tour as you stand and gawk at those who can afford to stay and pay for the priviledge.

Would I go again, probably not, but if you want to say you've done it then head up there, but there's not much to do if you're not staying there as a guest. Have to say that I would be very miffed to stay and be gawked at by those who aren't!"
,,Now That's a view....,4.0,,"After visiting the lame KL Menara a few weeks back, I was a bit hesitatnt to throw down any more money on supposed ""views"" - glad I decided to. True, S$20 isn't chump change for most of us, (I think they could have made it a bit cheaper), there are no better views of Singapore, period. I was surpised to look and see all of the cargo ships on the back side of the Sands. It was an amazing view, and I suggest this attraction."
,,200 meters up in the air!,5.0,,I was lucky to stay at the Marina Bay Sands and didn't pay any entrance fees but after I saw the park I thought it was worth the entrance fee. Just watch my pics from the skypark. They ar breath taking.
,,Better Than being in Slow Flyer for 30 minutes,3.0,,"On the first day of our Singapore trip on 14th June 2011, we reached at Singapore Flyer to enjoy Duck Tuor first. It was an hour's ride that ended at 0630 pm. View of the marina Tower building while we were sailing on water was spectacular. Then we decided to go for Sands Sky park instead of flyer as it is higher than the flyer and kids were more interested to be on the ship type roof of three towers instead of wasting 30 minutes on the slow speed flyer. So we hired a taxi again and reached there (later we found that it was just a 15 minutes walk from the flyer). Anyway we purchased tickets and the quick lift took us to the 57th floor in no time.
It was time of sunset and we enjoyed beautiful view of Singapore in day light as well as night. We could see Singapore flyer, under construction botanical garden and other buildings of Singapore. We were not allowed to go to the pool side as it was meant for hotel guests only, however there is a point where we could see a restricted view of pool and garden and took photos there. There is a restaurant and Bar as well. But the problem is that you don't find any place to sit other than restaurant unless you are comfortable sitting on the floor. Anyway good place to spend an hour specially in evening time to have a view of Singapore in shining lights."
,,Waste of Money,2.0,,"This is a very expensive way of seeing a view of Singapore. It is crowded and there is nothing to do except walk around and take photos of views, yes there is a bar/restaurant but they also are very expensive. The only good thing about it is to be able to say you have been to the top."
,,Simply Breathtaking,5.0,,"Having watched the Marina Sands Complex being built over our previous visits to Singapore I can honestly say that the final product is ""Simply Breathtaking"".
We had the oppurtunity to attend the Lion King Show at the Theatre... a must.
Dabble at the Casino for a few hours (and come out winning) and wander the shops and art galleries. But the icing on the cake of this amazing complex is the sky deck. At $20S per person, some may say thats a bit steep, I would say its worth every cent and then some. The views of Singapore are sensational. Having visited Singapore many many times this is one perspective of the city you must see. Add it definately to your ""must do"" list."
,,Best view of SG Skyline,5.0,,"The view from the Skypark is breath-taking. Best time to visit: late afternoon (dusk) going towards evening so that you can see the transformation of the city lights. Catching the sunset is also a must-try activity for relaxation.

One thing though, it would be nice if they provide more lounge or sitting area for non-hotel guests."
,,A fanastic way to view the city.,5.0,,"The fee is $20 and the views are priceless. The elevator to the 56th floor is super fast and you are then free to wander around taking in the Marina area as well as fantastic views over the city.
It was fascinating to see all of the construction work going on in the Marina area, and you have a birds eye view from the observation deck.
Part of the experience is wandering by the endless swimming pool which looks like it extends right off the edge of the building. It was a little strange wandering around up here and taking pics while the guests were swimming but they seemed quite accustomed to it.
Worth the entrance fee.
Also, worth noting - most of the area is not under cover so if it is a rainy day or raining you will get wet (and the views obviously suffer also)."
,,A leading Singapore attraction...........,5.0,,Top shelf attraction (pardon the pun). SIN $20 very well spent for amazing views in all directtions. Would recommend going at night. The building itself is completely amazing and over-the-top.
,,Worth going if you're in the Sands Casino area or you like this type of thing,4.0,,"It's expensive for an observation deck- SGD19 for an adult; SGD13 for a child.

You either like going to observation decks or you don't! If you do, I'm sure you'll justify the cost.

You do get a nice panoramic view of Singapore, and the building and casino are interesting.

I suggest you combine a visit here with some of the other local attractions.

By the way, if you are a non-resident, remember to bring your passport for free entry to the Casino!"
,,Amazing views - Well worth a trip!!!,5.0,,"It is not every day you get a chance to see the tallest swimming pool in the world and I must say it was pretty impressive. (You can't use the swimming pool, unless you are a guest, which is fare enough if you are paying mega bucks to stay at the hotel). None the less it is good to see. The views from the SkyPark are amazing, some say it is rather pricey, but in comparison to skytowers in other countries I would say it is v reasonable and definately worth paying!!!"
,,At least I can say I did it!,3.0,,"The day we went up to the Skypark a thunderstorm swept through Singapore. By the time we headed over at 7.30pm, the storm had passed and the skies had cleared. We walked from the MRT station, took photos of the hotel from afar, then walked across the Helix Bridge to the complex.

When you first walk up, there is a free light show on the water's edge that is played twice a night. We had just missed the first show, so were hoping to head on up and return for the second one. From the Helix Bridge, you have to walk into the shopping centre and past the casino and exit through the other side. Then cross the road and walk to the left, all the way to tower 3 (or c), where there is a counter to pay. It costs $20, but if you pay $5 more you'll get a photo of the MBS with you (and you companions) photo-shopped onto it.

Once up top, the night view is magnificent and with a breeze blowing, it's quite a comfortable place to linger and talk. There is a restaurant up there, but it was very busy, and also a gift shop, but no seats to lounge around. There's plenty of room to wander around and take clear photos of the view, but there isn't a lot of lighting on the deck itself.

There's no access to the pool area, so your ticket only gets you access to about half of the Skypark, but I'm only guessing that the view from the other side is out to sea. After taking lots of photos and video footage, we had our photos taken (as part of the package), then headed back to the shops and to the water's edge to watch the light show.

We probably spent about 30 minutes up there and although it cost us $25, at least we can say we did it. A few years ago I went on the Flyer and I have to say that the view from the MBS is better, it's cheaper and you can leave when you want."
,,Quite pricey for what you get but otherwise ok.,3.0,,"It was just a treat so didn't mind the fees otherwise I wouldn't cough out S$20 just to go up there. Having gone up higher structures e.g. WTC, Empire State, etc. with better views at a cheaper price, I wasn't all too impressed. The pool area was nice but us being non-guests of the hotel, all you can do is stare. I suggest if you do decide to go and to get your money's worth is to sign up for a Marina Bay Sands membership at the hotel lobby first. Membership is free anyway and you get a cool souvenir shirt for free when you purchase your entrance ticket. The Marina Bay complex can be quite impressive though if you're into modern architecture and design."
,,Superb views of Singapore,4.0,,"It is worth a trip for the views alone...
The $20 is a bit on the steep side, especially as it's just a viewing gallery with some information boards. but this is a new 5 star hotel complex and it's not every day you are going to stand on a structure like this so far in the air..
Also found the bar staff to not be the most dynamic and a bit aloof, but the skypark staff assisting on the deck were very friendly and only too willing to take photo's of couples and groups for you.."
,,Expensive view and rude staff -give it a miss,2.0,,"While there is certainly a great view from the Sky Park, it is not worth 20 $SG
The description 'Sky Park' is a misnomer-there are some trees, plants and a swimming pool and a bar up there but thereality did not meet expectations
The bar staff ignored myself and my wife as we sat at a table for a drink in the outside bar. After 10 minutes we gave up, and as we left we were asked by surly security staff to produce our our 20$ tickets, which we did.
If this is their approach to customer service the staff need re- training. Not an enjoyable experience.
Much better is to go to the top of the Swisshotel and and have a great view for the price of a drink. Also great views to be had from the Pan Pacific hotel."
,,"Expensive, fantastic views of Marina Bay area",4.0,,"We visited the Sands SkyPark a couple times during our stay at the Marina Bay Sands last week. The view from the platform is pretty tough to beat. This attraction just might put the Singapore Flyer out of business in terms of getting nice views of S'pore (said jokingly!). However, the price is very steep at Sing $20 per head to visit. We recommend going as late as possible in order to see the infinity pool area when the guests start vacating the pool. This is a major attraction of the SkyPark but the infinity pools is like a human zoo during the day time. Later on, it starts to clear out and you get better photo opportunities. Plus, its considerable cooler than if you visit midday.

Unfortunately much of Marina Bay is still under construction and development, basically all area past the Sands hotel, thus it makes for a less valuable experience now compared to what it will be in another 1 to 2 years time. On this basis, we recommend waiting until the construction is completed prior to spending the heavy price for a visit to the Sands SkyPark. It seems this could be a real gem of an attraction in a few years time."
,,Totally mad - but still worth going up,5.0,,"This building is totally mad - but cool. I don't usually like paying lots of dollars for views like that but I have to admit that it was worth it (and I only went for the views - nothing else). We went after sunset and stayed till the sky was completely dark. The weather wasn't very good and there was some rain. The person selling the tickets warned us that it would be very windy and that we would get wet - which I thought was quite nice of them.
After darkness, head down to the most wonderfully tacky video show (lots of pathos and kitsch!) in front of the hotel: look for the data projectors in the water - it starts at 8pm (and there's a second show later on, too, I think). It's not very subtle government propaganda - but certainly an experience."
,,Views and experience well worth the $20 price,4.0,,"Having read other reviews, I was skeptical as to whether the $20 admission to the viewing platform would be value for money. However we were taken aback by the experience of viewing Singapore from the 56 storey Skypark.

The architecture of this building is incredible and the views in all directions give one a real understanding of the continually developing city of Singapore.

I would recommend spending at least an hour viewing the city from here at the start of your visit!"
,,Sands SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore,1.0,,"The Sands SkyPark attraction at Marina Bay Sands is popular with both locals and tourists.
It is the opportunity to visit the impressive top sky deck of this newly opened Intergareted Resort in Singapore. The cost is S$20 and visitors get a panaromic view of Singapore from 200 metres above sea level,landscape gardens,exclusive restaurants,observation deck and the 15 metre infinity swimming pool - the world's largest pool at that height.
On Monday 17th January 2011 I went with a friend to the SkyPark ticketing station and then saw a printed notice saying that for that day no views of the garden or pool areas would be possible because of a private function. I told the ticket-seller that if that was the case then they should not be charging the usual price of S$20 since we were going to be denied access to 2 areas of the SkyPark. I was rudely and condescendingly told by
Shairi the ticket seller that views of the garden and pool were a bonus and that I could come back the next day when I would be available to see all the attractions promised in the $20 fee. I refused to pay for the ticket and went to the Hotel Concierge desk to lodge a complaint. The concierge agreed wth me that the pool and garden views were not a ""bonus"" but a main part of the SkyPark experience. Sadly no Manager(Kyle Carson) or Supervisor(Siti Azlina) from SkyPark bothered to come and meet with me. I was basically told to ""take it or leave it"" and that was all she would do for me.
I was totally disgusted by this treatment by a so-called 5 star hotel company and I will never patronise the hotel again."
,,"Great Views, but very expensive!",5.0,,"We went here at about 9:00 at night. The night views were impressive, but it was hard to get pictures because there wasn't much light on the deck. Overall a great sight and better view than the Singapore Flyer."
,,Not as impressive as I thought,2.0,,"If you are not a hotel guest, you get limited access to the skypark. For $20, it provided very little value. They even tried to charge $14 for 2 years olds when almost every other attraction in Singapore is free for toddlers. The pools and views were nice.

You will not be able to take any amazing photographs of yourself and the cityscape. A souvenir shop is however nearby who will willingly photoshop your picture on some nice backdrop. Artificial and expensive."
,,WOW,5.0,,"Incredible view and well worth the entry fee of $20SGD. Would recommend this highly and we had planned to go on Singapore flyer, however the view from MBS Sky Park so much better and gave the flyer a miss. There is a very expensive bar on the top along with a restaurant but again, worth paying for the drinks just to take in the wonderful views. There are viewing platforms and plenty of area's to see different views. You can access the infinity pool area up to a certain place where only hotel guests are allowed. There are even seats for you to sit down. I didn't see anywhere that the public could pay to enter the pool but maybe just missed that. When we were there, there were lots in pool and lying on the sundecks around. This was one of the highlights of our time in Singapore as well as a look through the Marina Bay Shopping plaza...expensive yes, but we worth a look."
,,An unofficial modern swimming complex with bad food but lovely views.,4.0,,"The Sands SkyPark is the recreation area of the Marina Bay Sands hotel (which I have a 3/5 rating, see my review on it). It is well worthy of its name indeed for its stunning views impress.

When I stayed as a hotel guest with my family, we would go up to the SkyPark for a swim. For a non-hotel guest, one would have to pay $5. Some do complain they have to pay for the price, but I simply consider it a public swimming complex, stylized to perfection and atop a hotel. $1.30 approx is needed to enter the public swimming complex, so consider the SkyPark 'of good value'.

The swimming pool is lovely. There are beach chairs lined up for relaxation, and a whole swimming pool separated into three zones in accordiance with the three towers of the hotel. Swimming while enjoying the skyline of a city? Simply spectacular. There are two jaccuzis to complement it.

However, the dining options there are horrible. There are no restaurants open as of August 2010, and the only cafe over there is horribly bad. Heated food? Dirty tables? Saddening.

All in all, the Sands SkyPark is a great place to view the skyline of Singapore and swimming many metres above the air, but you may have to bring your own food along."
,,Don't go up after sunset!,2.0,,"We made the mistake of going up after sunset, and it was not well lit up there. Can't see much things, no good condition for photo taking. The only thing is the surrounding lighted-up city night scenery. Please visit in the day or at sunset."
,,it cost to see the city from up high? give me a break,2.0,,"Sorry to spoil your fun, but I'm the minority on this site thinks that this is just a total rip off, and it doesn't worth the money paid for it!

Why on earth pay SGD$20 just to get on to a rooftop of a building? Sure it is tall, sure it has spectacular view, but it does not worth $20 at all. Especially when 2/3 of the rooftop is actually blocked off from general access, plus I can't even enter the restaurant which I suppose to be able to access from the skypark!

Avoid is place people, keep your money for the Singapore Flyer."
,,Spectacular Skypark,5.0,,"I suspect the Singapore Flyer is suffering with the opening of this novel attraction.
Set atop the new casino at Marina Sands, it offers spectacular views and on a clear day you can see across much of the city state, shipping at anchor and across to Indonesia and Malaysia.
You can get a beer on tap but nowhere to sit and enjoy it.
Don't forget to go up a level to see the gobsmacking pool for hotel guests only. It is pretty useless as a swimming pool (I have visited twice and not seen a person actually swim). Plenty of photographs of the surreal outlook over the city."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"wow what can I say what an awesome experience, fabulous 360 degree views. Definitely worth going up to the Skypark"
,,Ironically the views of the Hotel are better than the view from it...,3.0,,"I visited the SkyPark twice once in the day and once at sunset. The views in the day are not much better than those from the Singapore flyer but with the advantage that you are higher up and can take your time walking around and taking in the view, the SkyPark is also cheaper.

Unfortunately the high sun during the day and the tendency for haze makes the view a bit dull which is why we went back at sunset, if you are going to visit the SkyPark this is the best time of day but it is also the busiest so give yourself time to get tickets. The $S20 price is very reasonable and now includes access to the northern garden and Sky Pool.

if you are lucky with the weather the views are stunning but are not that much better than any of the other hotel viewing balconies although these are only available to guests.

Ironically the architecture of the Sands hotel is now the main focal point for the city viewpoints which means that every other location has a better view because the sky park is the only place in Singapore where you can’t view the Sands Hotel."
,,Breathtaking Views,5.0,,"Words really can't describe just how breathtakingly spectacular the panoramic views are from Skypark at Marina Bay Sands. The Singapore Flyer pales in comparison. From the moment you ascend the lift to the 57th floor, you are held in awe not only of the sweeping birds eye views, but the amazing architecture of this ""floating liner"".

At S$20 an adult, this is excellent value. For an additional S$2 you can take advantage of the audio tour headsets; each scenic viewpoint audio station activates a commentary of the buildings, architecture & points of interest you are looking at.

For those into photography, this is a paradise location, not to be missed. The infinity pool is innovative & inviting but definitely not for the feint hearted!

But ask us what we will always remember about Skypark - it would have to be devouring delicious hotdogs with mustard as we sat cross legged on the floor, looking over the panorama of Marina Bay & Singapore's skyline."
,,fantastic structure - amazing views,5.0,,"we loved it, higher & better than the Singapore Flyer. Swimming in the infinity pool must be amazing"
,,well worth the entry fee,5.0,,"It costs 20 SD for entry to the sky park. The queue for the tickets was quite big - maybe a 30 minute wait.....

The view at the top was great. You can see the Marina and towards the city.

There is a BBQ selling hot dogs and drinks and a small shop stand. There was a rehearsal for Singapore day whilst we were up there and fighter jets were flying around the hotel!!!

You can see the horizon pool but only hotel guests are allowed in that area.

Although i dont fancy staying there as the hotel is so busy and there are so many tourists looking over into the pool area."
