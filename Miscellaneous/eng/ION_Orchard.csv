,,Top class brands!,4.0,,"ION Orchard is located in a very prominent corner location near the top end of Orchard Road.
Whilst visiting Singapore again recently, we paid yet another visit to this “high end” shopping mall.
This mall certainly caters for the “well-healed” shoppers, being home to outlets for a variety of expensive fashion and jewellery brands. This probably explains why most of the people present during our visit were simply window-shopping rather than actually buying!
A visit to ION is certainly recommended for those who either enjoy shopping for top quality merchandise or for those who simply like to browse and dream!"
,,Try the free ION ORCHARD FOOD AND HERITAGE TRAIL,5.0,,"Book and email them in advance for reservation,.

Take advantage of this free tour. It’s about 60-90 minutes with a glimpse of the history of Orchard Road and the architecture of ION Orchard. Kudos to Nicholas, our tour guide, who provided great insights to us and was very willing to answer our questions

- After about a 30-minute overview of the history, architecture, and art exhibits in the mall, we went to the Food Hall where we were given FREE SAMPLES of Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Prawn Noodles, Hainanese Chicken Rice, Ginseng, sweet treats, and Ice Kachang for dessert.

- There’s also a free SGD5 voucher for each tourist—so we got SGD20 for us. We used it to buy our which consists of 1 set of Kaya Toast + Ala carte order (8 toasts in total), Large Hainanese Chicken Rice + extra rice, and drinks. FREE LUNCH for us!"
,,Ion review,4.0,,Huge mall and nicely renovated! Connected to many other shopping malls nearby. Huge variety of shops as well
,,ION = ICON mall,5.0,,"The facade is attractive and impressive. It connects to the Orchard MRT directly and is located in the prime road ""Orchid Road"" Very convenient and popular. Thus, very crowded as expected.

The brands sold here are high end.

There's food court ""Food Opera"" in the basement.

The best thing I like about this mall is that many brands I like can be found here eg Lim Chee Guan sliced pork, Bengawan Solo pandan cake etc. Definitely it's the iconic mall of Singapore in my heart."
,,Wow Mall,5.0,,One of the best malls I've been to. Most of the shops are luxurious and there are many pretty girls around.
,,Great location mall but very crowded,4.0,,"I think this was one of the malls that we most often visited during this trip, The mall is located at the junction between Orchard Road and Paterson Road and this is where Orchard MTR station is located,

This mall is very well positioned and underground it can directly access Wheelock Place where there is a large Marks & Spencer, Shaw House where Isetan is located, Tangs where there is a Marriott Hotel and Lucky Plaza beside it, and Wisma Atria.

Within ION Orchard there is an H&M, Uniqlo, a Post Office, a large food court, and so many great stores for shopping as well as so many mid end and luxury brands.

However, we found ION to be almost always incredibly crowded which somewhat detracted from a great shopping experience. But if you are happy with a crowded mall then ION Orchard is one of the best in Singapore."
,,Orchard road monument,4.0,,"ION stands out among many Orchard road malls by its sheer size. The MRT station connects internally and you can access several nearby malls too using the MRT subway. Although most brands here can be found in every decent Singapore mall, ION has a large JD Sports which I loved and shopped at. The food court is a long corridor with eateries on both sides."
,,Free ION Orchard Food & Heritage Trail,5.0,,"Very extensive introduction to Singaporean food and culture in the safe and air-conditioned comfort of the shopping mall. Highly recommended if you just have a few hours to spare (eg if you are on transit, or on a work trip) in Singapore and you don't have time to explore beyond the shopping district. If you hold a non-Singaporean passport, you'll get a $5 voucher too. Excellent option if you are on a tight budget."
,,Vast!,3.0,,Ok so it’s a shopping mall. It’s very large and there is a lot there if you want to shop. However in my opinion I find the layout very confusing and not that logical. There is a large food court so you can grab food or a coffee easily. I find getting a taxi afterwards quite challenging as there is often quite a bit of congestion and a queue at the taxi rank. MRT is probably quicker and better.
,,Iconic Building On Orchard Road,5.0,,If your visiting Orchard Road it's incomplete without visiting this Iconic Building. Connected to Orchard MRT and 3 or 4 other Malls if I'm not mistaken. This is the Mall that Houses All the Big Brands the latest in Fashion and Luxury. Amazing place very busy almost all day long we didn't do any shopping but it was fun to look at all the Beautiful Displays.
,,Great place for shopping,4.0,,"One of the most iconic building in Orchard in Singapore that is well known for the branded good boutique and other shops in the lower levels of this mall. Plenty of choices and it is well connected to Wheelock place, Shaw Towers and Wisma Atria. There are plenty of eateries too and you will be spoil for choices."
,,Easy to wander around,4.0,,"You can just walk from one end to the other (or am I confusing it with another mall...Singapore is a country of shopping malls)
Luckily I came by when Clarins was having an event so I got some skincare freebies and free gelato too! Yayy.
I think there's also a LoHi tea here. Man is this store popular! I had to wait almost half an hour for my drink! First time I've ever had to wait that long for a drink. There was a bit of confusion while lining up though..."
,,Huge shopping mall with a good food court,5.0,,"A huge shopping mall with a high number of shops, a large food court with large selection of different cusines.Clearly worth a visit, and as well connected to the Orchard street subway station."
,,VERY BIG MALL WITH MANY HIGH BRAND SHOPS,4.0,,"Did not spend one SGD here because prices too expensive. Yes it had the latest fashion, electrical gadgets, trendy items, but prices seem all to be list price. Even food hall prices were expensive compared to outside food shops. Spent 3 hours here but bought nothing."
,,Huge Variety of Shops,4.0,,"ION is a very nice mall with lots of shops to suit most people. It has a convenient MRT station connected to it which was good.
Personally, Singapore prices are no longer cheap but shopping or browsing at ION was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."
,,Upscale mall along orchard road,4.0,,"This should be one of the latest addition of shopping mall along the famous Singapore shopping belt. You can find upmarket international fashion brand like Louis Vuitton, Valentino, etc in the particular mall. The food court which is located at basement 4 has some really nice local food. Though prices are slightly higher compared to the other food courts in Singapore."
,,I love this complex.,5.0,,"The offer plenty of things in the same mall, including shopping, cinema and food court. At first, I thought the food court must be a bit pricey, but hell no. $3 for a meal, can you believe that? That was so yummy as well. Better go for Hainan chicken rice."
,,A Mall,4.0,,"A mall as every other mall, except that the shoppes are quite expensive. It is huge and you can get lost quickly."
,,Still one of the best malls to go to,5.0,,"Well.. its quite crowded half the time. Specially the foodcourt. But really affordable and yummy food can be found in its food court. Specially the famous white or Hainanese chicken.

Tons of shops inside. Almost always on sale... and you tend to find the models and sizes you're looking for. It would seem messy because of too much crowd. But it a really nice place and very complete. So i would highly recommend it to people who are looking for things to buy.

Warning.. shopping is never cheap in Singapore. It's almost always a little bit more expensive even with the tax rebates. But at least it's complete."
,,Ion experience,3.0,,It’s an attempt to high end shopping. But don’t match its description on google. It was just ok not as good as spoken about.
,,GlitzyShopping On Orchard Road If You Like Shopping,4.0,,"This new large shopping tower had all the major brands plus, and was a glitzy place and a classy shopping area. We were there for a restaurant and not the shopping. Well worth a look if you lkie high end shopping and a large bank account. It is also one of those shopping areas that make you walk through the floors to find the elevators as there is not a continuous logical flow up and down."
,,Crowded,4.0,,Its one of the most popular place in Singapore. You should avoid going there on sunday if you dont like crowd.
,,Asian clothes sizes ...,4.0,,"My hotel was quite close to the mall. The MRT Somerset station was practically inside the mall, so I went through it every time I had to go somewhere.

If you want to shop this place has everything from luxury brands to down to earth stuff. There's also quite some choice in terms of food.

The prices are quite expensive as all things in Singapore. There are food stalls outside the mall selling amazing food at dramatically cheaper prices.

However, when shopping for clothes - it is rather hard to find clothes for people that are larger than average in Asia."
,,Glamorous shopping in a well organized center,4.0,,"We did the whole shopping center from the top where you can find the luxurious brands of the whole world to the bottom and below, where you can find in the basement 4 an enormous variety of food shops and can eat cheap. On each floor you have free sanitary installations, who are kept impeccable by a lady in the women’s and by a man in the men’s corners!"
,,Great mall,4.0,,"One great mall among so many more in Singapore ! If you arrive by MTR , and get off at Orchard Station , you can hardly avoid this mall , as the station is under ION Orchard !"
,,Too fancy place for a regular shopping,3.0,,"Very clean and fancy, but too ezpensive for regular shopping. Me and my friend visited food court and some drug store shops. We ended not buying anything."
,,luxury brands,5.0,,Great 👍 The best mall in Singapore 🇸🇬 many levels with food court and dining Restrunt.there is small Japanese shop were great
,,upmarket,3.0,,"nice mall, but mostly very expensive shops in there. A nice place to look see look see... Al thought one might enjoy it if you are to look for expensive items"
,,Has to be one of the shopping malls you visit.,5.0,,Always make a point of visiting the ION shopping mall when in Singapore. So big you can get lost. Lots of eating places.
,,A central place to shop and eat,5.0,,"ION is located in the heart of the Singapore shopping belt along Orchard Road.

It is one of the largest malls in Singapore. You will be able to find the high end stores like Luis Vuitton and Cartier, and at the same time you will also be able to find heart of the market brands such as Uniqlo, Muji, and G2000.

This is also a food wonderland in that you will find good restaurants offering different types of cuisines at mid range prices. At the same time, you will also be able to find more affordable food options in Basement 4. This is a must visit place if you are looking to shop and eat and shop and eat and shop..."
,,Ok to browse buy not to buy,3.0,,"The mall has a wide range of shops, with the high end ones mainly on the ground level and higher levels. Shops in the basement are more mid range. In any case, it is overall an expensive place including the food court food options. Posh place to hang out at but not to do serious shopping."
,,"Upmarket and Stylish mall, with a catch",4.0,,"ion orchard is a great mall if you want to purchase brands like Panerai, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Dior etc. For the rest of us, more casual and inexpensive brands like CK Jeans, Armani Exchange, Zara also has large stores here. For food, there's alot of options from high class restaurants like Taste Paradise and Putien to casual dining like Ya Kun, 4 Fingers or even a large food court.
However, the catch is, most places here are pricier compared to the rest of SG, due to its location. Most locals don't really buy the pricey brands and are mostly bought by tourists."
,,"Not really a place I would visit again,",2.0,,"If you are into designer clothing then this is the place for you! I will not be visiting again, over priced and not enjoyable at all."
,,High end mall on Orchard road !!!!,4.0,,"ION Orchard is one the several very high end malls on the Orchard road. We went there around new year and the place was very nicely decorated with a huge Christmas tree !!! Most of the shops are boutiques selling some of the world's best and most expensive brands. The only challenge in Singapore is that they dont have a concept of MRP or Maximum Retail Price, due to which a shop can sell any branded product for any price they feel. So even if they offer discount one can never be sure if the price is still the best. We found that most of the products were very expensive here as compared to some other places in Singapore itself like IMM or Changi city mall. Please check the prices at multiple places before you actually buy. I can clearly see that the shops here recover the high cost of real estate in this mall from the Shoppers !!!"
,,A mall is a mall,4.0,,"Even though things in Singapore are generally on the expensive side, there's not much you can do about that. ION Orchard does a pretty good job of providing a wide variety of this stuff in a pretty nice mall. However, I personally prefer the Shoppes at Marina Bay. It offers a similar selection in a more relaxing and expansive space."
,,Expensive but good,4.0,,"Excellent architect. Best planning for restaurants, Orchard metro station, departmental stores, shops, entertainment and all. We found here each and every needful item, of all major world class brands. Very neat and clean place to go shopping or just to go strolling. There is an observation floor on top of the building from where Singapore sky line can be enjoyed."
,,"Brilliant Architect , expensive Mall ,",4.0,,"Well here is my review

Cons

1) Beautifully build , one of the top Mall at orchid Road ,

2) food court is big and great ,

3) lots of brands ,

4) there is Japnese store ""daiso"" at Basement 4 , which sell everything at 2 dollars

Cons ,

1) not really , but expensive shopping"
,,Good mall.,5.0,,"Good mall that has everything. Tasty food, luxury brands and top brands. Connected to orchard MRT. you need not drive to reach ION mall."
,,Best Foodcourt,5.0,,The ION has the best foodcourt of the Singapore shopping. Ultra clean with very exciting food selection. All asian delicacies and is a good starting point for tourists not too sure of Asian cuisine. Ultra clean bathrooms too.
,,The fanciest mall,5.0,,"Ion Orchard is the best up class mall in the city. Conveniently located at the junction of Orchard Road and Scotts Road, Ion Orchard houses the top international brand outlets."
,,Poorest carpark management on Orchard Road,1.0,,"2nd time got trapped in carpark for more than an hour. No one in sight to ask for help , no one in sight to explain what is going on. Be careful when you drive there, you may have had a great time shopping or had a nice dinner with your family or business clients. Then you get stuck in their carpark. Just warning anyone who is thinking of driving there for an important event. Risk is high."
,,Huge shopping mall,5.0,,Really large shopping mall on Orchard road that has a lot of shops. It will probably take a full day to see everything. We just stopped by here for a quick walk through the area.
,,Comprehensive shopping centre,4.0,,"Ion Orchard is a shopping centre to suit all tastes and budget.. whilst there are the obligatory designer boutiques at street level, on the basement floors there are more affordable stores e.g. Kiehl's, Sephora, H&M, Brandy Melville, Cotton On and even Daiso (the Japanese $2 shop selling knick-knacks). The food court and cake stores are good and it is possible to eat all cuisines.

Ion Orchard is conveniently located next to the MRT and connected underground to Wisma Atria and Takashimaya.

Go early to avoid crowds and avoid Sundays when all helpers descend on Orchard Road."
,,Top 3,5.0,,"Top 3 mall for me. It has everything - luxury and mass fashion, restaurants and cafes, art gallery, crate & barrel. And everything in between"
,,Huge selection,3.0,,Very big selection of stores inside. It's very easy to get lost. I had to ask many people for just the way out
,,Perfect for anybody!,5.0,,"ION is a really versatile mall with high-end shops like Gucci on the 1st floor and the floors above while the basements are full of H&Ms, Uniqlos, Daisos and more!

The bottom floor of ION is full of delectable food from milk tea (Koi) to fried chicken (4Fingers). Its the perfect shopping place for people of all ages.

On another part of the basement of ION there are restaurants more suited for families such as Imperial Treasure Noodles and sushi.

Overall, ION is the perfect place for everyone and I highly recommend it!"
,,Best shopping mall,5.0,,"I can say it is the best shopping mall since I been travel so long, many options and choices, good food dining and chilling."
,,Great malls,4.0,,"They have high ends goods and food court located on the bottom level. I had great experience with this place. Crowded but not overly crowded, you still can find place to sit. Some The food may be more expensive but taste is great, worth it. Last they have DAISO, japanese market all for $2 got few snacks and items for souvenir."
,,Red Army Watches at ION Orchard - EXCELLENT!!,5.0,,"Was watch hunting and came upon Red Army Watches at ION Orchard in B3, across from Starbucks. What a fantastic staff at the watch shop, very knowledgeable and also enthusiastic and excited about their products! Treated me like a friend from the start, complimentary coffee, 2 days later I bought a fantastic timepiece to remember my visit. Red Army Watches is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you everybody!!!"
,,Complements Takashimaya Shopping Centre,4.0,,"This upscale shopping mall has an ‘upstairs/downstairs’ feel to it: the 4 levels above ground have high ceilings, sell luxury goods and services, and are relatively quiet. The 4 basement levels have low ceilings, carry mid-range merchandise or restaurants, and have a maze-like lay-out where big crowds get lost. In a sense, it is almost like a continuation of Takashimaya shopping centre (to which it is physically linked underground, via Wisma Atria); they even have the same brands (eg. Tiffany, Louis Vuitton)! The food court is better than Taka’s, there is an observation deck where on a nice day you can have a birds eye view of Singapore. But Taka has the best bookstore in town - Kinokuniya. ION had a small bookstore that folded! People tend to go to Taka for shopping, and to ION for browsing or specific buying."
,,Everything in one place,4.0,,Live his place because pretty much everything is here. What’s more you can stay inside and shop even when the rain is pouring outside and still have access to the MRT and other areas through underground links.
,,It seems everything to shop is here,5.0,,I strayed in this shopping mall for a while every time I visited. Make sure you get ready for a big shopping day. Haha
,,Ion food heritage trail,5.0,,"What a fantastic initiative of ION! It is a free tour, that starts with the history of the area and also a quick tour of the art spaces. We were then taken to the food mall area and Food Opera for generous samples of local food. At the end of the tour we were given $5 vouchers to spend. The tour can be booked via the ION website, we booked 2 weeks prior to our visit and were the only four people on the tour."
,,Its not a paradise,1.0,,"This is a place to avoid during the weekend. It is not a shopping paradise , it's totally packed with human zombies. Hardly any space for walking and enjoy the shopping."
,,Ion Sky Central,4.0,,"Expansive, multi layered across many sections. It's better to use the escalators than the terribly slow lifts. Ion Central has all the high end stores expected of Orchard Rd. On L4 is the entrance to Ion Sky observation deck L55. Spend $20 shopping, keep the receipt and go to the concierge desk to book a time slot to go up. First time available is 2pm but you need to be there 15min earlier and there are is a limit to how many are allowed up each time. So shop, have lunch or coffee, book a time and enjoy the spectacular panoramic views. You only have 30min before the next group gets processed."
,,Regular visits,4.0,,"ION Orchard is a place I visit often because of easy access from Orchard MRT station - for money exchange, good food, coffee and Singapore Airlines office."
,,Singapore ion orchard mall,5.0,,"Hey guys, visited the ion orchard mall today. Huge mall and the most expensive mall so far that i have come across in singapore, its so huge that i got tired of walking , so came to food opera for eating. Well the entrance of the mall is simply amazing starting with brands like D&G. Absolutely no space for sitting anywhere !! Except the food eating areas . Huge variety of brands distributed amongst various floors."
,,Busy place!,4.0,,"If you have got a couple of hours to kill, this is one of the places to go to in Singapore downtown.
Shops on several levels, nice boutiques, coffee places, restaurants and small food outlets will for sure find your satisfaction.
It seems to be always acted there as you are on (or underneath I should say) Orchard road, with several underpasses connecting you to malls and to the MRT too.
Very busy with youngsters, families and tourists too, easy to spot with their plan in hands.
Definitely a place worth the detour."
,,An Icon Shopping Centre For East Meet West Place For Everyone.,5.0,,A must place to be and enjoy your shopping and relax with good upmarket food and beverage outlets with abundance.It is cross road for every corner of Central Orchard with trendy happenings on weekends.. Just go 👌
,,Must Visit!,5.0,,"This place trickles my five senses! Upon entering, the smell is very unique and fragrant! A smell that I can remember even when I travel anywhere in the world, The smell of ION Orchard really sticks to my mind. I miss the smell, I am longing for the smell. It makes me wanna come back again and again! The sights: very good to see all the variety of stores, boutiques, restaurants, cafes.. and all the people just doing their shopping (or window shopping, or even just passing by). The sound: find a place to sit, close your eyes, then just listen to the sound around you.. then you will find yourself (or lose yourself in the midst of all that’s happening around you). The touch: almost everything you will find here, not only high brand goods such as Louis Vuitton, Dolce Gabbana, Prada, but you have all the day to day essentials such as Top Man, Top Shop, Zara, H&M. Not only that, just have a feel (and taste) of the delicious food that’s available! Local and international cuisine so yummy and tempting. Feel the softness of the breads, the fried fritters, and then taste the awesomeness.

Well that just covers all the five senses: smell, sight, sound, touch and taste..

ION Orchard, simply one of the best shopping experiences in the world!"
,,Ultra modern mall,4.0,,"This is the latest mall added to Orchard shopping belt that has created an impact to all shoppers and commuters because it sits on top of the Orchard MRT Station. The design of the mall is ultra modern, both outside and inside. Being at the prime location, do not expect to find any cheap eat or item to shop. Most visitors could be commuters using the link to other part of Orchard Road or nearby shopping malls.
The mall is an eye catcher from outside so it is popular among tourists. If you like to have a glimpse of Singapore from the top, try the cafe on top of the building using the super fast lift by the side of Singapore Airline office.."
,,Huge mall,4.0,,Huge mall in Singapore with plenty of shops on offer. Very expensive but it is lovely. Food court on the bottom floor was more reasonable and good food too
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Very big and beautiful mall. Lots of designer shops. Orchard street is beautiful. I personally didn’t buy anything here but if you’re into the LV and Burberry etc, this is the place to go."
,,Great mall,4.0,,"Great mall with a vast kind choice of store, just make sure you spare about 1-2 hours to visit this place."
,,Ion Orchard Singapore,4.0,,A good place to shop around with underground links to MRT... Lots of nice food outlets but price is a little on the high end.
,,Great place for decent food,5.0,,"It serves a food court of which had a variety of different cuisines from all over the world. If you want to come for local food, they also serve a few delights that can satisfy your palettes!"
,,delightful shopping,4.0,,"when in singapore, it is a must to do mall hopping and just be content to window shop. but alas, you’ll find items that meet your fancy and you’ll end up spending a few dollars more.

ion orchard is such a mall in SG that offers a wide selection of what-have-yous. it also has a foodcourt that caters an array of fusion food. do not miss ion orchard in your shopping itinerary."
,,Most Popular Shopping Mall in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are a shopaholic, this place is for you. You'll find many branded stores and things here. Kikki k, the famous stationery shop in the UK, is even here!

It also has food court, but unfortunately I didn't have time to eat here. I only managed to buy Old Chang Kee.

If you like Japanese housewares, Daiso is on B4. All things sold here are SGD 2 only.

I would like to explore this shopping mall more next time."
,,Great foodcourt,4.0,,The Ion is one of many such buildings on Orchard Road full of high end shops. However its hidden delight is its food court located 4 stories underground. It is heavily patronised by the locals which is always a good indication of value for money. There are 20 - 30 food stalls in the court serving every type of Asian food you could think of. The quality is excellent and the price reasonable. Worth knowing about if one is shopping on Orchard Road as most street level eateries are a bit pricey.
,,Big and good shopping area.,4.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.18 )
My family visited this shopping center for eye shopping and lunch. This shopping center was very big size and excellent for its name. Many and various shop was operating, and well-managed. We ate lunch at food court in basement, that's good with various international food."
,,beautiful,5.0,,"constructed beatifully location wise also and entry is very hassle free at the location, the place has options to view and families are welcome here"
,,My favorite shopping mall,5.0,,I love shopping at ION Orchard it’s my favorite shopping mall. It has a lot of high end shopping but it also has a lot of affordable shops. ION Orchard also has a massive food court.
,,0 star- very wheelchair unfriendly and 0 conciege service. do not bother to visit,1.0,,"touted as a premier shopping centre, ION is not a good place to go. I called their 24hr hotline to plan a trip for someone on wheelchair. To find out if it's easy to move around and if conciege can help with moving from getting to lift for eg. the answer is no conceige ""doesn't do ferrying"" (which I don't mean to have conciege follow around for shopping). only to ask if conciege gives a service to help (or what is the use of conciege?). Answer given- we cannot guarantee, only if conceige is not shorthanded and unfortunately you are to move on your own."
,,East Coast Lagoon Prawn Noodles,1.0,,"Went early and chose prawn noodles for breakfast. There was only a man manning the store. He took money from me, gave me my change and went on to grab the noodles and vegetables without wearing any glove. Very poor hygiene given that this is a food court in a well know Shopping Centre (ion) in orchard. Customers are paying a premium for the food since this is at a food court in ion and not a hawker Centre. There should be better hygiene. Such slipshod attitude towards food. Terrible!"
,,ION Food & Heritage Trail,4.0,,"I was looking forward to joining this trail as no shopping malls in SG offer such a trail. I was lucky to have the guide all to myself being the only participant. Hafiz did a great job by first introducing the building, the Urban People sculpture and the ION art space; including a digital flip-dot waterfall which I never would have noticed! We proceeded to the food level where I sampled local food; though I told Hafiz that I know their tastes (YaKun/ Bengawan Solo/ Lim Chee Guan) but Hafiz assured me that it was totally acceptable for locals to sample the food as well. We then proceeded to Food Opera where I was given sampling portions of you tiao/ Hainanese chicken rice - the rice was fragrantly coated with oil + superb soup + well blended chilly sauce/ fried Hokkien mee/ chendol. I then realised why I was asked a couple of times if I had special dietary requirements; such thoughtful gesture. I highly commend & laud ION Orchard for their great initiative to conduct a trail to introduce a little of the Orchard Road history & the on-goings in the mall - not only for tourists but also locals. I also appreciate Hafiz for being a wonderful & attentive guide who knew the building & the floors so well. Thank you ION Orchard & Hafiz."
,,Great place for shopping,4.0,,"This is a great place for shopping in Singapore. Have many brand name shops and many restaurants. This shopping mall is connected to MRT station Orchard. In this moment, June 2018, many shops are on sale. After purchase, don't forget to go to the global tax free counter for the filling of your tax refund at the airport."
,,Big mall,4.0,,Big mall and many branded shop in there. Location at orchard road very busy and crowded road so many tourist go this mall.
,,Expensive Window Shopping,4.0,,"As my title said window shopping as with the high end brands that fill this mall are out of most people’s price range, hey but one can look and dream!
Now the mall it self is very nice and exudes expense and opulence this means it is well worth the visit to just see the beautiful items. We traveled from our hotel at Clarke Quay to the ion and it only cost $7sd."
,,Super Mall,5.0,,"There's lot of big brand such as Cartier,Louis Vitton, and etc in Ion Orchard, the mall is very bright in the night so i really like to sit down near that mall because when in Christmas holiday, there's lot of people there"
,,A transit mall - don't get stuck there and miss out on everything else,1.0,,"Ion Orchard presents itself as a glitzy Mall that carries big designer brands and is only 1 Mall out of the multitudes of many along Orchard Road. The basement shops cater to the locals with some regular stores with more palatable prices. But if you're in Singapore to shop, buying designer brands may not offer you the best prices since imported luxury goods are often more expensive here. Hence the locals fly to Europe to buy them there instead of here.

Ion Orchard has many restaurants which are also on the pricier side since the mall’s brand position is premium. There are nice and expensive cafes like Marmalade Pantry frequented by the “hip” locals and a “posh” food court downstairs at the basement. I would not visit the food court because I know I can get better and cheaper food just a short walk away.

Ion Orchard is often overcrowded with locals perhaps because of its proximity to the MRT station. It also houses the same shops as everyone else and lacks originality. The Orchard Mrt station offers you a direct link into Ion Orchard but to reach the original Orchard road shopping strip, you will need to exit at the other side where it doesn't show all the shops but takes you to Wisma Atria and a popular tunnel to Tangs.

I would recommend spending only a short time here at Ion Orchard and moving on to the rest of Orchard Road so you can get the full Singapore shopping experience. For a more interesting experience with a dash of local flavour, there is Tangs (on the opposite side) - Singapore's original department store and further down to Robinsons. These stores carry their own local labels and offer a more unique experience. I recommend to explore the local designers and get their unique designs to take home with you so there's something you have that nobody else has (at your country).

Ion Orchard is really more of a meeting point for people at the MRT station and then move off to other places in Orchard road. It misleads you into spending what little time you have in Singapore and gets you walking in circles, never leaving its vicinity. The shops are repetitive and filled with people rushing from point to point.

Hence Ion Orchard is more of a transit kind of mall while you enter Orchard Road. There is so much to explore outside and above the tunnels. Touch on it briefly then move off to see other parts."
,,Not bad,4.0,,"This place is easily accessible by MRT ( alight at Orchard MRT ). There are a lot of shops located at this shopping mall. At this mall, you can find a lot of luxury items ranging from clothes to handbags. In this shopping mall, there are also a lot of premium eateries such as TWG. There is also an underground pass connecting from one shopping mall to the other shopping mall which is located nearby ION Orchard."
,,Best mall for branded store,4.0,,You can see and buy many branded apparels inside. One of biggest mall in Singapore. Reasonable price.
,,Good Food Court!,4.0,,The food court at ION is good. We had lunch at ION after visiting National Orchid Garden. We took the bus #7 from the Garden. The food price is moderate. The mall is beautiful. The Orchard MRT Station is in ION. The signs are clear.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,The ION Orchard is famous for being one of the iconic places to shop along Orchard Road. The building is quite unique and iconic and has most of the major luxury brands here. Its well connected by the mrt.
,,"Massive mall, takes a while to find a way out!",3.0,,"Massive high end mall. Links to Wheelock Place & another mall. Also MRT station. Took me my entire 4 days to work out the best way in & out. It’s also an underpass across Orchard Rd. Huge amount of shops, also food court & cafes/restaurants. Don’t go in if you’re in a hurry as you may never get out."
,,Tasty food and great service!,5.0,,Convenient location. Great service from the staff (Chen Xiu in particular). Food tasted great. 辣子鸡 and 小龙包 were good. Will definitely return for the food :)
,,Massive mall,4.0,,"ION Orchard is kind of the mall on Orchard Road, lots of high end brands, but also good selection of main street retailers plus food and beverage outlets. The mall is quite large, many floors in basement. It is one of those malls that has quantity and quality, however in Singapore and HK these days many many malls are like this. For anyone shopping on Orchard I guess ION is part of the must see malls."
,,All manner of shops,4.0,,Its a shopping mall as well as a transport hub. You can shop and cross under all the different roads. Everything you might need for shopping and plenty of stuff you don't need. M and S is here!
,,Mega Mall,4.0,,The ION Orchard is one of the iconic Mega Malls to be found on Orchard street in the heart of Singapore tourist shopping street. Quite a spectacular building from the outside and it certainly must have almost every luxury brand on offer within the mall. It is interlinked from all angles with subways from the other surrounding malls - if you take care of the signage you are able to find your way round with relative ease. Note it’s not for the budget conscious. Must visit even just to take in what Singapore offers
,,high end mall on Orchard Road,4.0,,"ION Orchard is one of the newer additions to Singapore's ultimate shopping street, Orchard Road. This mall carries a lot of high-end brands in its upper floors and more budget-friendly brands at its lower levels. The layout and design are stunning, and the place oozes luxury (especially the higher floors). At the basement is a huge food court serving all varieties of local and international cuisines. It is a great place to spend an afternoon shopping and eating."
,,It's busy department store.,3.0,,I went to ION Orchard on the afternoon. It a busy department store. It is full of people. But good thing is there is extremely close to MRT Orchard.
,,Another high-end shopping center,3.0,,"If you’re looking for high-end brands, this can be an alternative. Food court is available in the vicinity."
,,Street food on steroids,5.0,,"Very confusing to the first timer but is just street vendors in a very plush basement. A large variety of Asian food is available at reasonable prices. You can select dishes from different vendors and then find a table or at least places at a table. This can be challenging at peak times. But don't worry the locals are very helpful and Accommodating. It is also a great way to meet people when you share their table. We met students, other visitors, an Indian businessman and a gospel singer from Malaysia. There is no such thing as ""bad"" food in Singapore."
,,Paradise for Shopaholics!!,4.0,,If you are on shopping frenzy and love all premium brands then you are in for a treat as it is a heaven for you!!
,,Enormous mall,5.0,,"This shopping mall is located on Orcard road and it's enormous!!! There are all kinds of shops, restaurants and cafés inside; you won't get bored here!"
,,Best Mall,5.0,,"ION Mall is huge. I think you can find anything there. There are lots of eateries & all sorts of stores from high end to more economical choices. The parking is good. There is a subway station (MRT) next to it so it is very convenient. There are
concierge services to help you with your inquiries. ION connects up with other buildings such as Wheelock Place, Wisma Atria, etc through underground tunnels. It is a great place to shop!"
,,The best mall!!!,5.0,,"ION Orchard is the best mall in Orchard road. It contains a lot of shops, restaurants & cafes! Worth to visit. I think one day is not enough to shop there!"
,,best mall ever,5.0,,"i visit ion orchard almost everyday since i stay in newton, and i can say that i have never been bored."
,,Fantastic shopping mall but expensive.,4.0,,This Mall is cutting edge in design and shops but at the end of the day it's just another way to empty your wallet in Singapore (it is great for escaping afternoon heat though).
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Connected to orchard road MRT, offer great accessibility, good and big foodcourt located at basement 4."
,,Can't visit ion skyline,3.0,,"We were there quite early, while the shops are open at 10 am. I read another review advising to visit ion skyline early to avoid crowd. Beside, i want to buy some camera stuff, one of my aim was to visit the skyline.
Concierge desk open earlier than shops, so we thought we should go up first while the shops were not open yet.
However the disappointing facts are :
* They do not allow somebody to go up if they do not shop in there.
* One can only go up after 14 pm and it is every 45 minutes.

I left the place disappointed. There is no way i can wait till 2 pm after buying my camera stuff.

There are a lot other place to shops which might accepts you in better manner, not arrogant."
,,Shopping Orchard Road,3.0,,"We were staying at the Shangri La Hotel and took a taxi to ION Mall as it was raining!
Because of the one way system in Orchard Road, the taxi had to go way past the Mall, before turning and leaving us at the back entrance. If taking the lift in the Mall, beware that there is no G for ground floor ... the ground floor is Number One. There were so many shops and we did not find it easy to find our way around .... more difficult than last time we were in Singapore."
,,Great Shopping Centre among many,5.0,,"One of the great shopping centres along the famous orchard road. This shopping centre has all the big brands lile Prada, LV and the like. Interconnected underground to Isetan and Wheelock Place as well. Can easily spend the day there if you are an avid shopper."
,,Another Orchard Road high end shopping centre,3.0,,"Another high end shopping centre with top flagship boutiques. YSL, Tiffany...The basement offers the more average consumer brands, from Japanese Daiso ""everything @$2"" to Uniqlo and Muji - considered value for money and trendy brands. Likewise food- 4th floor has Paradise and steam boat at high end prices. Singapore is more expensive for fine dining than Hong Kong. Basement food court has above average prices and huge variety, most are at premium prices. You can buy Chinese herbal products at Eu Yan Sang to bak kwa(bbq Chinese pork slices), ice cream, candy and cakes here. The signages have improved since they first opened but you have to be very aware of your surroundings. I mostly walk through here to cross Paterson Road underground to get to Shaw Centre. This way you can avoid stairs between Tangs and Shaw Centre....."
,,Best exclusive shopping complex - not to crowded and compact,5.0,,"If you are in for the big brands they are here some of the fancy fashion, designers and luxury goods. What I like about ION is that its not too big, so you can easily spend a few hours and get into the different shops. The toilets are very good, always clean and large. Easy access from and to MRT makes it also a convenient place. A large selection of small food and stalls in the basement. You have it all in one."
,,Maze runner,1.0,,"This plaze is a maze...I'm sure there are still visitors in this place that haven't found yet the way out. It is horrible organized and so confusing that you will get lost. The stores itself are good (same as in other malls though) and the building is really nice from outside. I can recommend to not come with the MRT, but with the taxi and just vist the overground part...other you may stay longer than planned ;-)"
,,One of the better shopping centres,4.0,,"This place has better shops and food markets, particularly at the top! take a wander around as their are lots of unique shops and stalls. Great to check out the waffles and ice coffee!!!"
,,branded store along the road,5.0,,best yet classy mall. i could bring my girl here n she loved shopping so much.This shopping mall has most branded stores.
,,Has Everything,5.0,,"Great mall. Has the MRT station within, tourist office, a supermarket and plenty of shops and restaurants. Well worth a visit and it is connected to several other malls underground, which keeps you out of the heat or rain."
,,one of the best,4.0,,one of the best food courts i’ve ever been too. this shopping mall has just about everything you can need
,,"Confusing, but beautiful",4.0,,"Firstly, it's top class. Great shops, presented beautifully. It's many levels tall, can't quite recall, but when you think you are at street level, there appears to be a few levels below still to explore.

The aisles are sweeping curves, fabulous architecture, but stupid for shopping. I have a good sense of direction and found it confusing at best to navigate.

I no doubt missed many shops simply because of the poorly designed layout. Trying to be too clever with design, at the expense of practicality.

Anyway, it really is a must see in Singapore if you are a shopoholic, and I would rate it 5 stars if not for the poor layout."
,,Cool Mall,5.0,,"So I had planned my day to go to the Art Gallery and to venture to the 56th floor however...both were a Fail. Very disappointing. One, the gallery ended the day before I went. Should've stated that online and/or a sign before waiting in line. Secondly, you have to register online and spend a certain amount (I believe 20 dollars) then once you have then you can go to the 56th. Can't I just pay the amount cash? I dont get it.
SO, I spent the remainder of my day at the mall and is very much worth a visit !!!"
,,Shoppers Heaven,5.0,,Six or so levels of amazing shopping. Luckily they have interactive search and map displays as I got lost several times!
,,Te Biggest Shopping Complex in Singapore,5.0,,"The ION is touted as the largest shopping complex in Singapore. Situated at the Orchard Road MRT station and opposite the Marriott Hotel and Tang Plaza. There are 4-5 levels underground and 15 levels above ground. The obversation deck
offers a great view of Singapore. The costis S$2 or if you spend that amount in the shopping complex show your receipt and it it free."
,,A super shopping mall,4.0,,This shopping mall has most branded stores. Another one of Singapore's many available. All linked by underground air-conditioned walkways. You can get anywhere from here via the MRT and Bus system.
,,a shopper's paradise!!!,5.0,,"get off the MRT station at orchard road to find yourself inside ion shopping mall, enjoy free wifi and endless shops! its truly a shopper's paradise and the best in my opinion in singapore. all the top brands all find them there.
also don't forget to take a couple of photos from outside as the mall designs is extremely nice."
,,A great shopping centre,5.0,,"This shopping centre has now matured into a feature of shopping on Singapore's Orchard Road. The mall has a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT Station) so very convenient for visitors. The station is at level Basement 2. Singapore tends to follow the American protocol of calling the ground level floor 1. The top level has some excellent restaurants and a large office of Singapore Airlines if you wish to make or amend any flight bookings with them. In the Basement 4 there is a large food court, you will lots of these in Singapore. The concept is that each person can choose the type of food they want to eat and then you can all share a table and enjoy eating together. It often helps avoid any debate on which type of restaurant to attend. ION can get very busy at weekend and evenings. In particular the underpass from Wheelock Place into ION can get very crowded at times. There are some escalators that are 2 and 3 storeys long and they can help you avoid constantly changing staircases. Some locals will tell you that as you travel up the floors in ION the prices increase. I leave you to form your own judgment. Most people I know enjoy a visit to ION. Just wish they had building wide wi-fi!!!!!"
,,One of the best,5.0,,Its one of of the best shopping malls in Singapore with so many great shops and lots of varieties . The food court is huge with good food
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"The best place to shops in Singapore,everything you needs from clothes to perfume jewelries shoes and watches ..this is the perfect place to visit."
,,A mall with everything,5.0,,"Modern, well renovated and they have almost every popular brands you can think of in Singapore. Great place to spend your weekends if shopping is in your list."
,,My Favorite Mall,5.0,,This is my all time favorite mall .. and it is located bang on the orchard road .. The MRT is also connected to the mall .. Well maintained and a huge number of branded shops .. Lovely place to be for a stroll too .. Lots of food outlets too ..
,,Great Shopping location,4.0,,I like it. The ION is a great location for shopping on the Orchard Road. Shops on different floors depending on the price the more daylight the higher the price ;-)
,,Shopping Haven for all,5.0,,"ION Orchard has almost everything you want to shop for on all occasions. It ranges from luxury products to food and beverage. Direct access to the MRT station (Orchard MRT) through its basement floor. Its ION Food Hall is on the B4 floor where it comprises of many food stalls. If you are hungry and want to grab a quick bite, this is the place to be.

Highly recommended to take the public transport there as it is usually very congested at Orchard Road and the road leading to the pick-up/drop-off point and the carpark."
,,Excellent services!,5.0,,Pelayanan terbaik dalam melayani konsumen. Konsumen diberi reward berupa free trip. Definitely will visit again!
,,Excellent Food Court,4.0,,"Back home in the UK, shopping centre food courts are places to grab a coffee or some fast food/junk food - not so in Singapore. The food court at ION Orchard is a feast for the senses. It's huge, there are dozens of individual food stalls, in fact it's more like an air conditioned hawker centre. I'd go as far to say it's worth a visit JUST to get some amazing street food. You do pay a little bit more than you would at a hawker centre, but it's well worth it for the central location and the massive selection of food on offer."
,,Great concierge,5.0,,"Great place to find everything under the sun. Excellent concierge service, get extra points on ur birthday month!"
,,Heaven for shoppers,4.0,,A place that is buzzing with people and extremely busy. It is so easy to get lost here as it is so big.The shops are incredible with all famous brands located here.The food court is always busy and it is difficult to find a place to eat.
,,Beautiful and Expensive,4.0,,"Gigantic and incredibly expensive mall in the heart of Orchard Road. This mall may not be for everyone, it certainly was not for me, it is beautiful but very very expensive. While it is very large there are not that many shop and the shops they do have are very exclusive. There is even a starred Michelin restaurant in side. Not my cup of tea but I am glad I went."
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"This mall is quite a tourist attraction and full of visitors. I guess this mall is divided into two sections. The basements are for the mid range shops and restaurants, this section also connected with the MRT station and the luxury shops are located in upper ground levels."
,,Just window shopping is something else.,4.0,,"Ion is where you go for the top end of shopping experiences. This is where you will find the famous fashion labels and those retailers who have a name in something. Just window shopping or trying things on is an experience in itself. Going at night, you get to see the lights."
,,My Favourite Mall in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are looking for high end names or trendy - this is your place.

It was until recently the only place to buy netspresso capsules for coffee. Designer opticians have the most remarkable frames - mind blowing. Oh so interesting.

Several good restaurants to eat also."
,,Good shopping and food,3.0,,We spent a few hours successfully shopping and enjoying the ION food hall we had really good food. I recommend the food hall if you are in the area
,,Makes shopping a pleasure.......,5.0,,Everything one could look for - in serene conditions with pure luxury in close attendance as and when required. Food available is mind-blowing. Highly recommended in a city that boasts some of the finest shopping malls in the world.
,,Top 3,4.0,,"In my opinion, 1 of the top 5 megamalls in singapore. It's literally got everything between mass market to luxury

For fashion, they have most of the luxury brands and most of the mass market brands. Most of the luxury watch brands have standalone stores here too

Because there's no department store per se, they have most of the cosmetic brands in standalone stores on 1 floor

A wide range of restaurants too, from mass market food court to australian celebrity chef's Salt Grill on 1 of the top floors of the building

Crate & barrel is here too

There are also 2 art galleries if you have $1 million to spare . That differentiates Ion from the rest for me, and i buy artwork there

There's even a supermarket in the basement, but small"
,,Fabulous place to pray..........,5.0,,Most of the popular brands in one place! Love ION. It is one of the best places to shop in Singapore. Food court in the basement is excellent for Singaporean street food and for a quick bite. Most often there are sales going on so if you are lucky you can get some branded stuff at very reasonable prices. It is always buzzing even on week day mornings.
,,Still the most popular mall in Orchard,4.0,,"We were in Singapore during the Malaysian Independence Day weekend (August 31) for a holiday and also to check out the Force Friday II event at ION Orchard, organized by LucasFilm in conjunction with the upcoming release of Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

The mall itself remains a very popular spot for people visiting Orchard Road, thanks to being built on top of the MRT station of the same name. And one unique thing of ION Orchard is this - the four basement levels are where pretty much everyone hangs out, whether at the huge food court at B4, going for H&M-type shopping, or buying groceries at Jason's Mart, whereas the above-ground floors are where the high-end boutiques are. What an interesting contrast! :)

And as for the Star Wars event itself, while there were many interesting activities taking place on that day, including a ""Padawan Training"" at the ION entrance, I was pretty disappointed with some of the models on display - notably this rather pitiful-looking Millennium Falcon also at the entrance!"
,,Great place to shop for brands,5.0,,"Great place to shop when it has many brands within a mall esp if u need to do comparison of products.

Went with my 3 kids (under 11) and most shops comes with sofa where I could settle them there while enjoying the shopping experience. Salespersons are often friendly and helpful when u need advice.

Definitely not cheapest place to shop for brands but as a local, I don’t need to spend on air tickets to make the purchase so it’s a trade off."
,,Explore,5.0,,Everything you can find it here. Thats why you have to explore it. Basement till B4 & connecting with Wheelock.
,,Excellent Shopping Mall,5.0,,This is one of the best shopping malls on Orchard Road and has the branded as well as mid tier shops. There is also a food market where the food are more mass market if you do wish to go for the more expensive restaurants in the mall. There is also the Ion Sky on 55th floor but it is under reno now but understand that it should be opened in a week or 2's time.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"One of the newer malls in Singapore , and with an array of latest designer shops and brilliant food court in the basement , it ranks as one of the best malls i have been too recently."
,,shopper's haven,5.0,,"Unlike Marina Bay Sands, this mall has a mix of low end and high end. Everything from Cos to YSL, Keith & Charles to Issey Miyake.

The food court has mainly local offerings, is clean, and is very affordable. I had a pork cutlet meal with a drink for $6 SGD. It was tasty. Lots of bakery and cake options too.

This is accessible by the MRT and is in walking distance from most hotels on Orchard road.

It also has a TWH tea store on one of the upper levels. There is one at Changi airport, but that one is a mad house. If you really want this tea, buy it at Ion Orchard.

I wish I had spent more time here than at Marina Bay Sands.

There is an area I think on the same level as Rolex or Birks? that has ubers and taxis. You line up in an orderly manner for a taxi, so it is not a free for all."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Ion is definitely a shoppers delight , all major designers here plus mid range a beautifully designed store easy to get around could spend hours here it's in a great location on Orchard rd my favourite centre to shop"
,,Up market,4.0,,"Couldn't afford to buy much, very high end shops, great place to have a look around, must check out Gentle Monster shop. Food hall was okay, not to expensive."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"My favorite shopping centre in Singapore, it has so so many great stores and a high variety. I could spend hours there (actually I do). Recommend for all types of shopping low and high end. Great food options also."
,,Great place to stop by on Orchard Street,5.0,,This big shopping mall would satisfy all your needs. Try the food court on the basement. They have variety of food at inexpensive price in a clean welcoming environment.
,,Shopping in style,5.0,,"This centre has it all- beautifully presented stores , great location , top brands, easy access, it's own taxi rank,all in air conditioned comfort. Also plenty of places to eat , drink & relax without having to go outside."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"This one of the most popular and well connected shopping centre in Singapore. The Orchard MRT station is located within this shopping centre. An underpass connects it to Wisma Atria, Ngee Ann City, Wheelock PlaceShaw House and Tangs. The architecture is unique and in the evening the colour of the facade changes. You can get all the high end goods that you want here. You can spend hours here and shop till you drop."
,,"Lots of shops, however expect to pay retail price",4.0,,"My wife and I visited this and was amazed at the amount of shops. There was a lot of designer brands and plenty of options for eating and drinking. Only downside is there's not a lot of inexpensive shops. Good shopping if you have a big wallet and looking or latest brands and trends, otherwise don't bother shopping here for bargains."
,,Great Experience!,4.0,,"I really enjoyed this mall for two things; the giant food court, and the free food tour/sky tower tour for foreigners! If you go to the guest service desk, you can sign up for this tour with a tour guide. All you need is your passport.

We got lucky, and were the only ones that signed up for that day. So it's like my group got our own personal tour guide/tour. It was awesome! I wish I could remember our tour guides name. He was awesome! He took us to famous shops and cafes in the mall. We got to try samples of the famous Singaporean Kaya Toast (so delish!) with some brewed coffee, sweets from a bakery, and teas from a specialty herb tea store. We took a tour outside where he explained to us the history of the art sculptures outside. He helped us take pictures with these sculptures. It was fun!

Onto the sky tower! The place was empty, and we were free to roam everywhere. We filmed, we photographed, we looked down onto the rainy city - where we towered over sky scrapers. It was so much fun. And all for free? I'm all in. Perfect way to kill time, for free, indoors. Highly recommend this mall!"
,,awesome and big mall,5.0,,i love the ambiance and stores in this mall. i stay near to orchard road and find this place superb. specially kikki.k store
,,Great Mall - Ion Orchard,5.0,,"Is it possible to spend an entire day 10.00. - 5.00. in a mall, shopping and browsing? I didn't think so, but blow me, it was 3.00.pm before we even checked the time. Food, on the lower levels. Shops galore. Want a coffee and cake, no problem. Want a nail fixed or a pedicure, easy. Need to get a gift ... hey! Want to splurge ... well you have a wide choice. We did not expect this to absorb almost a whole day of our stay. Recommended, but have a credit card unless you can resist the temptations offered!"
,,Shoppers Delight,5.0,,Stumbled into this mall by mistake as we were looking to cross Patterson Road. We were very impressed and have been back again. A huge range of stores from high end to $2 shops. An amazing food court in the basement is worth a visit. All in all a great place to browse or buy!
,,Singapore loves shopping!,4.0,,"This ""mall"" will be heaven for those people who love to shop. From mid-range to high- end multi-floor shopping at its best. Everything you can think of from apparel to electronics to whatever, you should be able to find it there. Plan at least a day to spend in this area with massive food court included. Enjoy!"
,,One of the most expensive,4.0,,"Well the decor will tell you that you are in branded place. Exclusive shopping center all big names are there not my piece of PIE unfortunately, but worth a visit."
,,Singapore loves shopping!,4.0,,"If you are passing by Orchard Road then you'll most likely visit the ION Orchard. It is an extensive shopping center and full of your shopping needs. There are a number of high end, luxury and everyday shops so you won't feel like you are missing out. The big names like Louis Vuitton, Prada and Valentino have shops there. You can also find H&M, UNIQLO, Zara and Mango. There are food courts located at the lower level providing various options for shoppers needing a break.

It does get busy as people flock through at all hours of the day. It is open daily from 10am to 10pm.

The nearest MRT is Orchard and there are numerous bus stops, taxi stops and parking and valet services available. Wifi is free and available to use during your visit."
,,cool mall,4.0,,This mall is one of the most interesting malls I've ever seen. There are tons of shops and restaurants inside as well.
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"ION Orchard is one of the most impressive of the many shopping malls located along Orchard Road. During our most recent stay in Singapore, we had an enjoyable time exploring the various floors full of mid and high-end retail outlets offering something for almost everyone.
Whether it be fashion, fashion accessories, footwear, men's clothing, jewellery or make-up - it is all there.
If you get tired from your shopping activities, you can take a break with a drink, snack or a meal in the extensive food court located in the lower level.
If you intend going on a shopping expedition along Orchard Road, put ION Orchard mall on your ""must visit"" list!"
,,Bling Bling City,4.0,,"Amazing building and shopping center shopaholic nirvana and bling bling shopping,all the labels and names or the fashion world are there.My favorite shops watches are there and if you have cool $ 50k to drop for any limited number watches it is a starting price.But interesting walk and you need a pair od sunglasses joking"
,,Incredibly expensive,3.0,,If you want to shop here best have the credit card handy. All upmarket stores with high prices. Haed down the road to Plaza Singapura.
,,Too buzy - not outstanding,2.0,,"Maybe we hit Ion on the wrong day (Saturday and national holiday sales). The lines for paying for items were excruciatingly long. The food court was interesting and a fun experience despite being sold a duck dish although I had ordered vegetarian! Staff at Sephora wanting more to get me a membership than giving product advice. Ok, I found stuff on my own, only to see a 20 min payment line in front of me. I exited without purchase. The same for the Muji store - line way to long. Taxi service to exit; there is a waiting area for getting a taxi but many taxis are hauled just in front of the official waiting area, where people get out. Why bother then with an official waiting line?"
,,Shoppers Paradise!,5.0,,"Very upmarket mall with numerous designer labels on multi floors - Burberry, Calvin Klein, Dior, Gucci, Louis Vuitton etc This is my favourite Mall out of all the numerous malls on Orchard road. It is a beautiful and eye catching building with an unusual shape. There are a number of mannequins striking various poses of everyday life right in front of the main entrance. Apart from the clothing, jewellery and shoe shops, they also have a number of restaurants and some beautiful sculptures strategically placed around the mall. There was an art exhibition going on when I visited therefore was able to visit the exhibition and view the beautiful oil paintings on display. Highly recommended!"
,,Go to basement B1 and B2,4.0,,"Top floors are top end brands, if u go to basement lot of midrange brand shops are there. Charles and Kieth , H&M , Zara .... it is very vast."
,,High end area of Singapore!,5.0,,"The place of all the luxurious brands of clothing, bags and almost everything.
You will enjoy the city underground where there is a mall inside the underground going to the MRT. I think it is 3 levels down from the department store to food court to convenience store. Be sure you know where to go because it is really big!"
,,Love this Shopping Center,5.0,,"Went there at a rainy day. First we thought there are luxury stores only, but if you go down you'll find less expensive stores as well. The staff was very polite and friendly. Especially in the Burberry Shop they offered really good service."
,,Probably the best shopping center on Orchard road,5.0,,"Ion orchard is a high-end shopping center with lots of eateries. All designer clothes, jewelry, watches, everything you need and you you don't need they sell there. The place is so big and has many stories but the good thing is MRT subway is right in the basement."
,,"ION ""Food Opera"" food court",4.0,,"Similar to Tang's, down on level B4 this is a very clean and friendly food court for those not inclined to the traditional hawker venues. (Each vendor accepts PayPass...)

A little more authentic in design, it also has trawling drinks and dumpling sellers. Remember to find a seat before ordering, when it's busy. Bring your own serviettes/napkins.

There's a bigger range of stalls and foods than Tangs. Similarly, if you're a ""germaphobe"" but like to try lots of items this could be the venue for you. The toilets are spotless. Free Wifi."
,,Another high end mall,3.0,,"Im not a fan of malls in general as it does not display any cultural, traditional or other aspects of the county. Just your same big brands like Gucci, Prada etc. For me it was a waste of time as I have these shops in UK near my home and I can go there when I want. I don't need to go half way around the world to waste a day here."
,,For Daiso,4.0,,Daiso was the main purpose of us visiting this mall. Connects easily through the underpass from Takashimaya. The Daiso here is large and also busy.
,,Great Variety of Shops,5.0,,"One of my favorite shopping areas in Singapore because of the diverse offering in terms of shops. Lost of well known brands, as well as more local ones, ranging across all budgets. Can find almost anything you are looking for, from clotting to shoes, beauty products, and even school supplies!"
,,Awesome mall,5.0,,This mall is really awesome. It is right smacknin the middle of Orchard Road..the premier shopping belt in all Asia. All manner of shops are available. My family and i love this place. Very classy. Basement has wonderful food options.
,,Food and shopping haven,4.0,,"I like to visit ION Orchard every time I go to Singapore. It is such a convenient place to do heaps of good shopping. All the classic brands are found here, as well as an awesome food arena in the basement. The shopping centre has great connectivity to the Orchard MRT station as well as adjacent shopping centres such as Wheelock place, Isetan, Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann city. Due to this, it is always very crowded and bustling. Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Salvador Dali sculpture and Chendol dessert,5.0,,See Salvador Dali's magnificent Bronze Clock sculpture for free and enjoy an exquisite Chendol dessert in the Ion foodcourt.
,,Possibly fave shopping spot,5.0,,Simply put it is the fave spot for shopping if that's in your agenda in SG; however be prepared to empty your pockets. Everything top notch! Conveniently located on top of the metro train station.
,,Great View,5.0,,There is a viewing platform at the top of the tower. It's not well known even to locals but is free and gives a great view of the city state. The entrance takes a bit if finding. The lifts are hidden in a small art gallery on the 5th floor. Look it up for exact details on how to locate the lifts as the ION Centre is a bit if a maze. But worth the visit.
,,Best amalgamation for keen shoppers,4.0,,"I think ION is the ideal location to shop for anything on Orchard Road. The expansive space and wide range of stores makes it a perfect spot for locals, shoppers, and even tourists. It offers various eateries, affordable clothing stores like H&M, Zara, and more high end stores including Harry Winston, Patek Philippe, Dior, Valentino and others. It's the one-stop shop due to the location- above an MRT station and at the heart of Orchard Road. My personal favourite place to shop."
,,Free pram / strollers,5.0,,"This very conveniently located shopping centre, directly above the orchard MRT and on the intersection of Orchard and Scotts Rd.

A big tip for parents of toddlers however is that they provide free loan pram / strollers that are excellent quality, not the cheap flimsy ones you normally find. You simply go to the concierge desk on level 1, near the entrance, and hand over your drivers licence or other photo ID. They will then give you a loan pram that you can keep for the day, you simply need to return it before 9:30PM.

We went back on 5 separate days, picked up a pram when the opened at 10AM and then kept it all day to use around the sites of Singapore. Saves you bringing a pram all the way from home and carrying it on plane etc."
,,Amazing Mall,5.0,,"I love Ion very much, it has the cleanest toilet around Singapore that I know. Aside from that their toilet is very nice and clean.

They also have wide array of boutiques where I shop my clothes. Some more, I love the Tom Yum in Bangkok Gems located at their food Avenue. Ion i think is the best mall I see around SG."
,,The place to go for branded shopping,4.0,,"Conveniently located on top of the train station, this mall offers many levels of mid market to high end shopping. It has many restaurant options, upmarket cafes and an extensive food hall in the basement for cheaper eats. It also has a level with views of the city skyline. We enjoyed hopping from one luxury brand boutique to another, looking at the latest fashion designs and editions delivered to Singapore."
,,great shops and food court,5.0,,"this is where you find most of the locals as it is far more reasonably priced shopping than the rest of orchard road, but has some well known designer stores at one end and marks and spencer at the other end"
,,Mouthwatering Food Hall,4.0,,"Ion's food hall is located at the lowest floor of its basement. It provides lots of varieties and ample sittings. The quality of the food is high and inexpensive, and is certainly money for value. If you are looking for a quick quality meal, this is not a place to be missed. Best time to visit is before 12:15 pm, just before the office workers head out for their lunch."
,,Get everything you need,5.0,,"Full of high end stores, High Street stores, supermarket, restaurants, art galleries, Jewelry stores ; everything you need and want can be found in Ion Orchard.
The train stops at the bottom of the mall (Orchard MRT Station) - which is great for when it's torrential raining/scorching hot as the temperamental singaporean weather gets. The train station level even links Ion to Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann City, Tangs, Lucky Plaza, Shaw Lido which is 3/4 of Orchard road."
,,Best food court in Singapore,5.0,,Super high retails stores with the most amazing food court. Every international brand has a flagship store in this centre.
,,nice location all available including food,5.0,,very nice place to do shooping eating local and Chinese food.... several floor available bank etc for expensive and cheap wallet will be back for sure as soon as back to singapore
,,Where the rich people get all that cool stuff,5.0,,"Somehow this mall has assembled a collection of the most expensive stores on the planet. There are also restaurants. We stopped and had a lovely Thai lunch. Go, see where the people will all the money shop."
,,Huge Shopping Mall,5.0,,Huge mall and crowded during weekend. Mostly all branded shop fine dining or international chain restaurant are under one roof. Easy access because the ION mall are connecting with the Orchard MRT station.
,,Convenient place for food and shopping,4.0,,"Very big shopping mall located just above Orchard MRT station. You can find shops ranging from fast fashion to luxury brands here.
But I only came here for food most of the time. There is a big food court on the bottom of the shopping mall. Nice selection of local food with reasonable prices. Slightly highly price that other food centre but this one is air-conditioned, so it's worth to pay a little extra if you can't stand the heat!"
,,"Two malls in one, actually",5.0,,"One could argue that ION Orchard is actually two mall experiences in one location: one above ground level, dedicated to luxury and flagship stores, and another below ground, dedicated to services, food stalls, fast fashion, and more."
,,Decent shopping center with full of people,3.0,,"I went there to see what's inside while business trip and thought it is an average shopping center. You can certainly feel that you are in the center of one of the busiest city in Asia.
But I haven't seen anything unique to Singapore, so if you are looking for big shopping mall, this is the right place to go, but cannot recommend for sightseeing."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Very big mall with loads of stores and eating places.... like Dubai and Emirates mall Similar stores with high end fashion Prices were quite keen Zara pull & bear sephora top shop so many more I enjoyed shopping here
,,Benefits always disappoints,1.0,,"Ion Sky has a wonderful way of spoiling their visitor's day. They will always announce seemingly attractive give-aways if you shop with them but without fail, when you try to redeem them, they will claim that they are OUT of the offers....Come on ION!! Really sick of your gimmicks!! Don't waste your time going there. Don't bother."
,,Nice Shopping Centre,4.0,,"Orchid Road is quit noisy and very busy but once we walked inside this shopping centre we felt more relaxed.
Very clean and well air coned.
It can be a busy place but it didn't seem to be a crowded place with the great layout and large walk ways
My favourite part about this shopping centre over all the rest i have been to is the ION SKY.
The ION SKY is a look out area with 360deg view of Singapore over 2 levels located on the 55th and 56th floor.
Open between 3PM and 6PM.
Last entry is at 5 30PM and is free."
,,"Re-Inventing its Appeal, Spring At Its Frontage",4.0,,"With Its multifaceted allure of high end brands, A-Lister fashion houses, up market stores and appealing presentations amidst airconditioning comfort, ION Orchard is the premier shopping attraction in Singapore's Orchard Road belt.

While displays and stocks evolve with whatever season discernible in Singapore's tropics, the eye-candy factor in the stores make for changes that keep it upbeat for retailers.

The 'Wow' factor is the landscaped garden and floral displays at the the shopping complex's frontage. Perfect for picture stops, graced with bubbling mini-fountains, the Spring effect is, at once, welcomed and interesting.

A fine touch of Kudos over Profits"
,,Awesome,5.0,,Nice place to shop. All brand shops are available here. Daiso the Japan shop is available in the Basement 4. A person go around this complex for one full day. Very entertaining for all ages. The food court here is very huge and has lots of options. Coinecerge is available in the ground floor where tourist can find all information.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This place has everything!!!! Awesome food court, plus Bengawan Solo dessert shop, Sephora and many other shops. It is just brilliant and it it connects with Tangs Department Store underground. Just a brilliant experience."
,,Still my favourite shopping place,4.0,,"We always seem to come here for shopping, the combination of sherlock place and ION and Takishimaya make it a simple destination. Managed to get everything we were looking for too. Always coming to ION"
,,Impressive exterior,4.0,,"Massive shopping mall on Orchard road, near the Hilton. It is easy to get lost but the electronic maps are very helpful in finding stores or restaurants you may want to visit. Very clean and a nice respite from the Singapore sun."
,,Everything,5.0,,"This is shopping at its finest . You can easily spend a day and get lost here! There are food courts and upscale shopping are delightful and originals, not knock off items!"
,,Convenient Place To Chill Out,5.0,,"After walking from one end of Orchard Road to this end, Ion is a good place to chill out with free wifi and attached MRT station to it.

If you want to take a cab, get out of the building and take the first right turn and up the small stairs on the left as there's less queue for cabs unlike Takashimaya!"
,,good for high end shoppinng,4.0,,"we were staying at orchard road and naturally happened to visit this mall. it is huge and houses most of the high end stores. although, being from india, i find singapore to be slightly costly when it comes to shopping. so while i dint end up buying anything, it was good for some window-shopping"
,,Amazing Shopping,5.0,,"This place is up there with Fifth Avenue, Sloane Street etc. All high end stores and amazing store layouts. Great if you've got the cash."
,,"High end shopping, terrible customer service",3.0,,"Went here from the free shuttle from my hotel, love all the high end options, but the people working here could be better. They follow you around the store, don't speak when you enter and when you do ask for help, some seem as though they are being bothered. When I am speaking this kind of money I like to feel welcomed, this doesn't happen at all the shops."
,,Exciting and a must see,5.0,,"This is a fairly large mall at the cross roads of Orchard Road. Prices of good are on the higher side. Needless to say there are many options and the quality of good is great. Some good deals offered during Christmas and New Year.It has good modern architecture and from the subway one can go to the other malls as everything is connected ,so if one chooses one can walk on the roads and soak in the lights and atmosphere or take the connecting path in the subway."
,,SHOP TILL YOU DROP,4.0,,"Ion orchard mall is one of the many malls that line Orchard Road. At the top of high end shopping or near to it. Many high end brands located on street and first level with many other floors of less indulgent brands. A must for shoppers. Recommend, Hope this helps."
,,Very nice mall,5.0,,Very nice mall located in the centre! Has everything you want to buy! You can find bargains also in some shops
,,Nice modern shopping mall,4.0,,One of the so many shopping malls in Orcard road but certainly not the most expensive one. Beautiful modern architecture at the outside. Not the biggest one but everything is well organised. Foodmarket is there as in most malls. Its connected to other malls and can be readched easily even by public transport.
,,"Good walk, nice shopping, great tea!",4.0,,"Good place for a walk if it is too warm outside.
Many shops are quite fancy but there is one japanese shop where everything is for just 2 Singapore dollars per piece :)
And I can recomment The 1978 Clipper Tea Shop: great service and lovely teas!
(the way they prepare it will amaze you)"
,,So much high brands to normal,4.0,,"It's great shopping. You no need to transport so much. They have enough brands from high to normal for your wallet and choosing. And this shopping center is in the Orchard Road, shopping place!"
,,I do't really like ION too much...,3.0,,"...it is a vast mall on 8 levels and the layout is totally confusing. It has a good range of stores from super expensive, to reasonable, but I am afraid I can't be bothered with it. The vast majority of stores can be found elsewhere in the city with a less pretentious atmosphere and being much easier to find. The mall is good if you want to see some very expensive decoration (e.g. How many other malls boast Dali sculptures decorating the public areas?), and there is an excellent art gallery. Other than this I would not go to ION."
,,From Luxury to high street brands,4.0,,"Conveniently located just above Orchard MRT station. The mall is kinda divided into 2 - luxury brands like LV, Harry Winston, Prada, Gucci to high street brands like Zara, Warehouse, Ted Baker, H&M, etc. You can find luxury brands from Level 1 to 3 and High Street brands from Basement 1 - 4. There's also Sephora, Singapore Airlines Lounge, Opera Gallery, Daiso ($2 store from Japan tucked in a corner in basement 4) and Jason's Supermarket in the mall. As in all Singapore malls, the place is peppered with lots of eateries from Marmalade, Paradise Inn, food court (Basement 4), Japanese casual dining to suit every palate and budget. Basement 4 also has some takeaway counters like tori-q, o-Chang-ki, etc. You can take a lift to a viewing gallery (think the entrance is on the 4th level) and there's also a Salt Grill & Bar restaurant which has great food and great view (according to a friend). The mall is also linked to Tangs, Wisma Atria, Wheelock Place via underpass so you can shop in comfort even when it's raining."
,,Excellent all-round,5.0,,A great place for everything retail or food. We ate in an excellent Malaysian restaurant in the Ion. I will review that separately. A friend found a dress that she just couldn't find anywhere else. It's got everything.
,,Top 3,4.0,,"In my opinion, 1 of the top 3 megamalls in singapore. It's literally got everything between mass market to luxury

For fashion, they have most of the luxury brands and most of the mass market brands

Most of the luxury watch brands have standalone stores here too

Because there's no department store per se, they have most of the cosmetic brands in standalone stores on 1 floor

A wide range of restaurants too, from mass market food court to australian celebrity chef's Salt Grill on 1 of the top floors of the building

There are also 2 art galleries if you have $5 million to spare . That differentiates Ion from the rest for me, and i buy artwork there

There's even a supermarket in the basement"
,,$$$,3.0,,"iON Orchard is supposedly one of the biggest shopping malls in Asia, and I believe it. It is so easy to get lost, and it's very difficult to get a paper map. If you have lots of money, this is the place to go, D&G, Prada, Chanél, LV, Dior etc, all in the one place. Good to have a look around too, lots of eating options!"
,,Fun to Look...,4.0,,"If you like to shop... a fun way to get out of the heat or rain for a few hours. Definitely high end... more window shopping than actually buying, though. Lots of quite good Chinese restaurants dot the floors including several that specialize in Dim Sum for lunch."
,,Shopping lovers!,4.0,,This is a good place to drop by when you're in Singapore especially the X'mas season as you can see the lights in and out the mall. The mall is unique with international branded goods. There are variety of food and I found Avocado here too.
,,Very high end but difficult to find the way out,4.0,,"The layout design and atmosphere of this shopping mall is wonderful. Very high end, opulent and spacious. There is a good selection of designer shops and the interactive maps showing you how to get from one shop to another are excellent. However we struggled to find the way out of this mall. It's like they don't want you to leave!"
,,Best of all,5.0,,Loved the huge christmas tree in front of the mall. Enjoyed our time inside as well. Such a great mall with an amazing christmas spirit
,,Branded goods,5.0,,If you love quality international brand . This place is for you . Expensive tho . Its clean and easy access by mrt .
,,High class shopping mall,3.0,,I would not recommend this because there is nothing remotely interesting about this mall. Same shop like everywhere else. I would not enter here. Outside is interesting with some shows.
,,love the food hall,5.0,,"if you like to buy branded stuff then this is the place to go. I usually go to Ion for the food. The local food that they served in the food hall were great. This is the first place that I usually go once I touch down singapore. For those who fancy local delights then you should check it out. But keep on thing in mind, dont come here during weekends, it's too packed."
,,Always crowded but you can find what you need,4.0,,"One of the main ""attractions"" on the Orchard Road Strip and it is always packed with people, especially on the weekends.

There are a range of shops to suit any shopping fanatic and the great thing is that the walkways make most of the buildings connected underground. $2 Daiso, Uniqlo, H&M, Zara, etc. All the typical brands and also a huge food centre downstairs. There's also a posh (read: expensive) supermarket with a nice wine collection. Toys, books, stationery, toiletries, etc etc.

Easy to spend an afternoon or a day here (and Orchard Road surrounds)."
,,Big...,4.0,,"ION Orchard is connected to MTR (metro) station and its really pretty well located.
Inside you will find all of the luxury brands you can imagine and much more.
It worths the visit... Keep in mind its not cheap but remember, nothing is cheap in Singapore..."
,,Luxury Brands out there!,5.0,,"ION Orchard is modernizely built shopping center where you will see a lot of branded clothing, bags, cosmetics and shoes there. The most expensive and the latest design are usually available in ION orchard than the other outlets. But do not shop at Michael Kors, Coach or Kate Spade because they were more expensive than in the U.S or U.K.

But all the products are authentic and have uniform prices in all overall the stores everywhere in Singapore."
,,Luxury Shopping!,4.0,,"All big brands in one mall! you can shop till you drop. Its an iconic building and has lot of shops like forever 21, aeropostale, etc eateries are good too. we couldnt see the entire mall due to shortage of time but this is a must visit place for all shopaholics"
,,Huge Mall,5.0,,"ION Orchard is the first mall you will be at when you alight at Orchard MRT Station. It has many many shops, ranging from the more affordable ones like H&M/sports brands to the high end, which are located on the top floors. The mall is neatly organised. Definitely your starting point when you come to Orchard Road. Have fun!"
,,"Visually impressive, generic luxury shops",3.0,,"The entrance and the main tower have the visual wow factor, inside there are all the usual luxury shops you would expect. There's actually more interesting shops on the upper floors, maybe because the rental is lower. Singapore Airlines has an office here too. Interesting to wander around but not really a destination in itself."
,,Lots to shop,4.0,,This is a huge mall. Although slightly confusing escalator this is a modernistic design with ambitious layouts. There are a lot of shops located here from the high end to the mid end of fashion to accessories as well as some good dining.
,,taxi wait and traffic conditions,2.0,,"We went to Ion orchard for dinner - never again - when you have to wait 30 mn in the taxi queue after dinner with 4 taxis out of 5 being already booked or refusing customers, and then terrible traffic jams in and out - this is definitely not a good experience and we will skip next time anything near ion orchard at night."
,,"Shopping, Dining, relaxing all in one place!",4.0,,"This mall has hosted all sorts of brands, ranging from luxury goods to down-to-earth stuff. Most importantly, the food hall in the basement provides a great variety of cuisine for foodies to choose! You can not only have the authentic Singaporean food, but also Indian, Chinese and even Shanghaiese food."
,,Shops everywhere,5.0,,"While I didn't check out every shopping centre in Singapore I did find Ion Orchard to be my favourite. Probably the biggest I visited in Singapore, it has shops to suit all budgets. And like all good shopping centres it has great food choices. Add the great location under the popular Orchard Road, and you have everything except maybe enough time and money. If I go back to Singapore, I will visit Ion again for sure."
,,High end shopping,4.0,,Well it's fun to look at every possible designer store ever conceived but I don't want to spend all my hard earned $ there
,,Great place to shop and eat,4.0,,Great place to shop and eat. Many restaurants and cafes to cater to the large number of people patronising this mall and Orchard road
,,All Variety Under one Roof,4.0,,It's very obvious once you are in Orchard road ION with many shopping centers and cafe and restaurants Many variety under one roof and mostly you will find what you are looking for
,,Overwhelming shopoing,4.0,,"I've never seen two shopping malls connected. I've never seen so many shopping choices all right next to each other!! That includes NYC. A lot of the stores are ones we have in the States, but the food court is pretty unique."
,,Good variety,4.0,,"This shopping center has both mid range (e.g. H&M, Forever 21) and upper range (e.g. LV, Ferragamo) stores, the thumb rule seeming to be the higher floors have the more expensive stores. Also has a lot of food options, from cheap eats (such as Food Opera) on the basement levels to fine dining restaurants on level 4. We particularly loved the Haagen Daz cafe on level 4 where you can sit down and order ice creams, sundaes or dessert cocktails.

Very well connected by MRT (Orchard stop) and by walkways to surrounding shopping centers. Good place for shopping and eating, no matter what your budget."
,,Nice Shopping Centre,5.0,,"One of the cleanest, nicest shopping Centres I have ever been to. The aromatheray smell throughout was a beautiful touch. Air con was so good! All your high end brands are here: Dior, Chane, Longchamp, LV etc. The TWG teahouse was a little oasis. Great to visit if you want to do some highend shopping."
,,Still my fav,4.0,,"Large mall but not as massive as MBS, so easier to navigate. Has almost all the major global brands. Plus unique shops like art galleries. Large food hall in the basement Still my fav mall all things considered"
,,Awesome food court,4.0,,Loved the foodcourt here. Had very good grilled chicken. American portions for only $S6. They also had Thai papaya salad that was hard to find from other mall food courts
,,"Just a big, big shopping mall",5.0,,"As per titled, ION Orchard is a huge shopping mall with all the restaurants and shops you can think of. Air-con is always a plus in Singapore, and this place will keep you occupied for at least half a day."
,,Great views,4.0,,The Sky Lounge at the top of the ION Orchard is a pleasant spot for a drink and provides superb 360 degree views over Singapore.
,,Huge shopping!!,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore and you're passionate about shopping don't miss ION Orchard. From average brand till famous brand you can found there. Easy to reach, by MRT stop at Orchard station, you reach!! I found Japanese shop there all for $2 sell cute"" Japanese stuff."
,,Just massive,4.0,,"Another huge mall on Orchard Road. All the normal shops you expect to see, some very high end names. Walked through, but I was just over shopping at this point."
,,A Big Modern Mall in the Area but Nothing Special,3.0,,"I am not a shopping person. So for me it's another shopping centre compare to the other shopping centres in the area. You have your usual shops for food, clothes and jewelries, etc. Good place to hide from the hot temperature in the afternoon."
,,Amazing view from level 54,5.0,,A must see visit for a 360 degree view over Singapore and all for free. Telescopes also available and a couple of seats to relax and admire the skyline.
,,My favourite new shopping mall in Singapore,5.0,,"ION Orchard is always my favourite during my visit to Singapore. Love the fish ball and fish cake at the Food Opera, plenty of renowned food shops & fashion, the branch of Charles & Keith, etc. Location is also excellent, just one step away from MRT Orchard, direct subway connection to the shopping centres in Orchard, such as Ngee Ann City and the Japanese Department Store, etc. It is also in walking distance to so many hotels around, to name a few, the Regent, the Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, Sheraton...."
,,"Modern, fresh, interesting",4.0,,"As mentioned by others the Ion is a v large, v modern mall catering for mid to more pricey items, however, we found a number of very good unique shops and enjoyed coming here.

Easy to get to as it sits above MRT Orchard. But do not miss food hall in B2. Wonderful array of choices of freshly cooked food"
,,"""Still at the Focal Point of My Shopping Destinations""",4.0,,Still a decent shopping center in Orchard. Been here various times as of now and still would consider this as one of the great shopping centers in Singapore. Just lots and lots of stores to browse. May if be from the normal till the top of the line brands ION has it. Food choices are a plenty as well. Simply don't go here amid the rush hour as this spot can be packed. Still at the focal point of my shopping destinations.
,,5 stars shopping mall,5.0,,"This shoppin mall is very luxurious. It offers so many brands, from middle to high-end. There are so manu eateries too. Just name the brand, and you can find it here."
,,Fascinating Shopping Centre,5.0,,"Indeed surprised that instead of going upstairs, you go down. Lots of shops and it like a rabbit warren. First time I go there I was lost."
,,Another average mall,3.0,,Ion orchard is another average mall in Singapore. Nothing much to miss here if you do not visit. In my opinion there are better attractions than shopping malls in Singapore
,,Luxury!!,4.0,,"A very luxury and huge mall for shopping. Starting from the basement which you can find a variety of food, sweets and coffee shops. Local shops with clothes, shoes, etc. Noticed that all malls in orchard road are connected underground."
,,Good shop and services but...,3.0,,"If you like brand name shopping then this place is for you. I liked the place and people worked are nice. They have all the luxury brands, unfortunately that for me turned out to be a detractor at the end. Felt like I could be anywhere in the world, so why shop there."
,,Great shopping if you can find everything!,5.0,,"This mall is just huge! Great range of shops and eateries, I enjoyed a good hour or in the watch shops, a pleasant want to spend a few hours in Singapore if the weather is not so great."
,,This is a HUGE shopping mall.,4.0,,"This mall has everything - high end shops, fine restaurants and bargain meals in the basement food hall - what impressed me was that concierge services on five levels - if you get lost they can point you in the right directions.

It is a maze of escalators throughout the first five levels - I was a bit lost at times - still I did manage to have a coffee and ice cream at Haagen Dasz on the 4th level.

The mall is easily accessed from Orchard Rd or from Orchard SMRT.

The ION Sky viewing area is on the 56th floor - it has no entry fee - a good deal!

You can spend time wandering around checking things out - no need to spend - window shopping can be fun."
,,"Pretty,not for shopping though",3.0,,"Its good to look at,but VERY expensive! Even during the Great Singapore Sale,it was expensive.Try the other malls on Orchard Road or go to Vivo City mall for way more reasonable shopping."
,,Excellent shopping!,5.0,,A very accessible mall. Most luxury Brand’s are in this mall. Many wonderful restaurants. A place for families for sure!
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,"Probably the best shoppingmall in Singapore. We are a family with 3 teenagers and i think we went to ION 5-6 times during 3 days. They loved it!

My patience after the 5' th time in forever 21 was on a record low but they loved it.....!"
,,My visit,4.0,,"A perfectshopung mall for those who want to buy signature items unfortunately no nike outlet but there are few establishment selling nike shoes. The mall is inter connected with the MRT system so its very accessible. Coffee shop, snack bar, dinner you can all find it there plenty of choices. It is also picture perfect during night time with bright lights surrondings and big designer logos"
,,Shopping,4.0,,"I went to this mall on the first day I had to wander around Singapore on a quick trip there. It's huge! And had every store you can think of! There's Prada, Tiffany, and so much more. But there's also H&M and Top Shop. Great coffee shop down on one of the lower floors. Ion was always my fav place to shop in SG!"
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,One of the biggest and busiest shopping arcade. Connected to Orchard MRT station. Almost any shops are available there. Spent few hours to go around for anything to shop. Closed at 10pm.
,,A hidden bargain!!,5.0,,"If you go slightly outside ION Orchard to Wheelock Place (literally outside the shopping mall if you follow the signs from the metro) and then go to L2, there is a shop called AI Eye Fashion. I went there today based on a tip from a Singaporean friend and got a pair of Ray-Bans for $180 SGD! The entire Ray-Ban range is sold permanently at Ebay prices (eg the Clubmasters I bought had their original price tag at $285 but with the permanent 40% discount on the entire range, they were around $180), they have the full RayBan range and the old Japanese couple who run the shop are so lovely! Dont be fooled by the very basic looking exterior of the shop, the husband is a legitimate optometrist and will even put in prescription lenses into your sunnies if you desire (again, at much cheaper rates).

After I picked my sunnies, the husband is the optometrist and he will shape the sunglasses to fit your face exactly (eg bend the nose rim or lenses and curve the ear pieces using heat) until you are happy and they are a perfect fit. I wanted them to sit slightly lower on my face than they naturally do so he widened the nose piece and then curved the ears extra tight so it still fit tightly and balanced the two ear stems so they were even. Took him about 20 extra minutes and I couldnt believe he didnt charge extra for that but they now fit my face perfectly!
I do not normally bother going online and writing recommendations but this was one with bargain prices but earnest, old-school service! Go get yourself some bargain Raybans!!"
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"We recently spent a few hours walking through ION Plaza. After about 6 hours of walking we were only able to partially walk 4 levels with another 4 levels undiscovered as yet.

Each level is massive with hundreds of shops per level (below ground levels also). Variety of shops is too numerous to mention although if you can think of a store type it's most likely found here too. Besides for the plaza being great for retail therapy, there is some great sit down restaurants also with warm and friendly atmospheres.

One could quite easily spend the entire day in ION Orchard Plaza and not get bored or get to see all there is to see. This is a must visit when visiting Singapore."
,,"Wow...Just, Wow",5.0,,"I went to this mall on the 1 day I had to wander around Singapore on a quick trip there. It's huge! And has every store you can think of! There's Prada, Tiffany, and so much more. But there's also H&M and Top Shop. It's also expensive so be prepared to drop the dollaz if you're going to shop. There's a concierge on every floor to help you if you can't find a store or if you get turned around. And it's right on top of an MRT station."
,,"Classy, Expensive, cool architecture",4.0,,"Another massive modern mall in Singapore? Yes, they seem to grow like weeds here. This is one of the latest and most fashionable. It helps that it's located at the best intersection in town - Orchard and Scotts. Great coffee shop down on one of the lower floors. Expensive shops everywhere else."
,,Enjoyed visit,5.0,,"Beautiful building with any different stores! One of the best shopping destinations in all of Singapore, as there is something for everyone and stores range from high street and classy to low budget."
,,Lots of shop to you drop places,4.0,,"We where in here MANY times. The other half was drawn to the Factorie store. Prices where good. Lots of high end shop, places to eat, coffee.

BUT ..

You need to leave string to find your way back. A maze. More then once we got lost. But worth going to"
,,Best food court in Orchard road,4.0,,"Don't get me wrong, Ion is a very good place for shopping. But for me, Ion has the best food court when in Orchard Road.. There are so many stalls to choose a variety of food depending on your mood. I usually have the Hokkien mee or roast duck/roast pork on rice and a bowl of steaming soup...yum."
,,Get lost in brands,5.0,,"Best shopping destination in Singapore for sure , all ranges of shoppers would enjoy is , you can find from channel ... To H&M , orchad MRT station is located under it , connected to 3 other malls surrounding it , it contains a gold street underground , really you will get lost"
,,Just Ok,3.0,,Ok. lots of fashion shop. Just typicall mall except for sightseeing nothin' too special to see in this mall.
,,High End Shopping Galore,4.0,,"If you want the super high end brands this is the place to head to. All the big luxury brands have stores here. Its easy to access as the bus, metro and taxis all are connected directly with this mall."
,,Expensive shopping. View from top 56 floor,4.0,,"Its a huge shopping mall easy to get lost wothin it. Especially trying to get across the road.
Expensive designer brands including dior, Chanel, tiffanys, prada, gucci etc.
It links to the orchard mrt station, wheelock place and the takashimaya mall.
If you can find it from about 3pm you can visit the 56 floor of the tower go through the gallery on floor 4, to get view of orchard road and beyond."
,,Wide Range of Designer Products,4.0,,"We spent several hours at the ION Orchard Mall, where, from our view, all the top end European Designer Boutiques are well represented.
My wife commented that the boutiques are generally large, have a very wide range of company products, some products not even seen in our so recent visits to same brand boutiques in Milan and Madrid.
She also commented that ""new arrivals"" were slightly more expensive than in USA and Europe, even with the tax refunds of 5.5% for tourist typically in Singapore. However, most sales items were similar in prices to cities we have visited elsewhere. (Tourist info brochures also recommended checking prices in Singapore before buying.)

Restaurants had long queues after midday and even at 3pm, so we didn't stay around. We were told the day was a holiday so very busy."
,,An Unique super mall worth many visits......,5.0,,"This is a super huge mall & the biggest in Orchard Road. Also the nicest, with huge choices from very high end to mid end shops & dining . It has 8 shopping floors- 4 levels up & 4 levels basement.

It's also unique in that :

1.It has Ion Sky - amazing viewing gallery of the city at 55 storeys up! And it's FREE! Go to the customer service/concierge counter at level 4 for access to this place.

2. Unique, luxurious toilets - toilets are luxuriously done & very clean at all times. It has an attendant stationed at all times in EVERY toilet . All toilets has piped in music too & provides paper servettes tea for drying hand. Can't find another mall with such amazing toilets.

3. Concierge counters - such counters are strategically found in various different parts of the huge mall for enquiries. Talk about great service.

And it's linked directly to Orchard MRT station. An excellent mall definitely worth many visits."

,,Spectacular,5.0,,Nice vibe with the restaurant and being freely open to the public!! Great views from an air conditioned building. Nice information snippets too. Great!!
,,"Visually impressive, generic luxury shops",3.0,,"The entrance and the main tower have the visual wow factor, inside there are all the usual luxury shops you would expect. There's actually more interesting shops on the upper floors, maybe because the rental is lower. Singapore Airlines has an office here too. Interesting to wander around but not really a destination in itself."
,,STUNNING PLACE TO VISIT,5.0,,It's a fantastic Mall located exactly in the heart of Orchard road. You can visit it by MRT as it is located on the top of MRT. Must visit shopping destination if you are visiting Orchard Road.
,,Amazing road,4.0,,Nice road for shopping and waking around stop for a cup of coffee or fresh juice this round full with shops famous brands little expensive but few staff only available with good deal
,,Singapore's luxury shopping paradise,4.0,,"All branded luxury goods that you want! Singapore Airlines office. All in one building! MRT in basement, food markets and other shopping needs. Clean toilets. One can get lost with so many levels of basement."
,,Huge mall but overcrowded on the lower levels,3.0,,"This place is insane on weekends on the lower levels, but is manageable on weekdays. There's a selection of lower to mid range restaurants on the lower floors which can get really busy at peak times. The upper floors have mainly designer stores and are less busy. Convenient to get to as it's right on top of Orchard mrt."
,,One huge shopping mall,4.0,,This is one huge shopping mall that we were today. The products are more upper end of the scale but it's tiring just walking around.

,,Little or a lot U can spend,4.0,,This is a prim location with both high end as well as items you can buy with less cash or credit. Great Food Courts it's now under renovation so look out when it reopens I'm sure it will be really really nice.
,,"What a shopping centre, fantastic",5.0,,"This shopping centre is off the Orchard MRT station and was below the Marriott where we were staying. It's fantastic with too many shops and food courts, there's lots of Uk brands, M & S, Topshop, Warehouse and many other international brands, from cheap to designer and everything in between. There are 4 or 5 levels all underground in air conditioned comfort, and a couple of food courts. Well worth a visit, shopping heaven, especially in you live in Australia!!"
,,Shopping Mall,4.0,,"Ion Orchard is a great place to shop some well know brands. However, the lesser known fact is it has a viewing gallery which give you a bird's eye view of the orchard road and places around, the entry for which is free.

Sadly, it was closed the day we visited, due to a private event. Do visit there"
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,One of singapore top shopping mall... The mall consist of all kind of dining experience and a cool place for shoppers. Complimentary 2 hours of free wifi for anyone. Impressive place to be !!!
,,A great world class shopping,5.0,,"Located in Orchard, ION Orchard can be a good place for window shoppping and also for fashion lovers.

Never miss a chance to go these place when you go to Singapore"

Gucci,Parada, Mango,Doir, and various Jewellary Outlets in Jewellary Lane gives you
umpteen options. You have TAKA outlet for value for money Diamond Jewellary.
Eating options are plenty to choose Italian,Japnese, Koreian and typical Singapoean sit down restaurants to choose from Fine Dinning to Mid Range.

,,Escape the heat!,4.0,,"It's great for shopping and dining with a lot of European brands and plenty others from nearby. The mall is pretty big and houses many designers and other well known stores. The infrastructure and design is modern and clean.
Easy access to the MRT and plenty of buses outside. It's also connected to other malls and you can easily reach other department stores outside."
,,Mall,4.0,,This is a quite a big mall here.You have a variety of shops.A good selection of food outlets also here.This is kept clean and well maintained.
,,Worth a visit whilst in Singapore,5.0,,"I am surprised by comments that this is a mid-range shopping mall: I found it fascinating and quite beautiful in design. Yes, it has high floors linked by high escalators in the centre of the Mall. However, there are some great shops, good and varied places to eat and good facilities. As with most of Singapore, it is clean and well kept. Just loved it."
,,Nice place,4.0,,Walked through ION Orchard during our couple of days in Singapore. Lovely shops and a good place to learn about the public transport in the area
,,Midrange shopping mall,4.0,,"ION Orchard is mid-range shopping mall, where you can find international brands like Armani Exchange, Ted Baker and Victoria's Secret. Loved it!"
,,High end mall,3.0,,This is a high end shopping mall plenty of great shops with plenty of places to eat great if you like brand names well worth a look.
,,Badly designed upscale mall,4.0,,I don't know who designed this mall but they seemed more interested in indulging themselves rather thsn the customers. Its a huge mall whith just about every designer label represented. They have informstion counters around which you MUST ask because its just so badly designed you get lost easily. Some escalators by pass some floors. Signage are not good. Even the food court in the basement is pricey. They have an MRT station at the basement so that attracts people as it is covenient. They have a Daiso store that sells evey item for $2. They get the crowd for the sheer variety but oh so confusing to find your way
,,ION,5.0,,"Visited with my wife & found ION to be a excellent shopping centre, new & vibrant with all the big brands you'd expect being on Orchard Road. visit of an evening as the ION facade makes for a lovely memorable photo too."
,,Too Advanced,4.0,,"I went to ION Orchard to buy some clothes with my friend. It is the largest mall in Singapore among many others. Basically as you walk in the mall you can say that it is like High-end mall in USA. It offers many brands that you can usually find in other malls, but then again ION C. offers more variants. It is haven for shopaholic. It is quite pricey but then you already knew from the very frist step. The Funny thing was eventhough ION Orchard has many signs and directions I still got lost. I think the reason was because the vibe of largeness was overwhelmed me. I would say one thing that it doesnt offer is the easyness for blind directions people."
,,For the best views of Singapore and FREE !,5.0,,"The ION Orchard Centre is not only a beautiful sky rise , it has also a shopping mall with a collection of high-end stores nicely decorated , a série of great restaurants and it provides probably what are the greatest views over the city of Singapore and it is FREE ! On the 4th floor , right beside the info. center , there is an elevator that gives access to the 51 th floor where there is a 360 degrees view of the city . It is free to the public between 3 pm and 6 pm ! Outside this time period , you can access the bar and the restaurant on that floor and still enjoy the views !"
,,Just another shopping mall,3.0,,This is a large shopping mall among the many in Singapore. There are lots of high end stores but the prices are higher than in Taiwan or Hong Kong malls. It is very convenient though as it is located next to the MRT which is the best aspect of this mall. It is not as packed as Takashimaya but it is still quite packed on a weekday afternoon. I would not normally recommend eating in a mall as their food courts tend to be the same in all the malls but you could always give it a try. There's nothing special about this mall however.
,,A Central Orchard Location with MRT below it,3.0,,"The ION is beautiful and anything on level 1 and up is pretty much overpriced designer goods, very convenient in the underground network to all the other malls I that area. The layout however is confusing! The food on the 4th floor eateries is great and overpriced at the same time. The three basement level is the place to go and enjoy the varied shops and food stalls and catch the subway from to another place to visit"
,,You'll Swear You're in a High-End American Mall.,4.0,,"I'm from Southern California and work near South Coast Plaza, a major regional mall with many high-end stores. If you visit Ion, you will swear you are in South Coast Plaza. You will be surrounded by all the same stores you will find at home, but with higher prices. If your hungry, you will find many high-end restaurants in this mall, but I recommend you make your way down to the lowest level where you will find dozens (perhaps hundreds) if low-priced ethnic food options."
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"Plenty of shopping mall on Orchard road. This one is directly connected to MRT which make it very convenient. On the basement you'll find a great food court.
These places are good on raining day as well as hot day since it is fully air conditioned (take a thin pull over)"
,,Its ok..,3.0,,Integrated with smrt.. just another mall of singapore.. nice thing in orchard is that most of the malls are linked..
,,Fancy Shops,5.0,,ION Orchard is one of the fancy malls around this street. We didn't really go through each boutique inside but we can tell not a lot of people go here since it's pricey due to brand.
,,"Just a maze of shops and places to eat, plus connection to the MRT",4.0,,This place is just a maze of shops connection to the MRT or just a pass through if you want to get across the road. The food hall also contacts a lot of diufferent places to eats and drink. A must place to visits for shoppers while on orchard road.
,,Even more spectacular at night,4.0,,"It's like a huge maze of primarily high end shops, - it can get quite overwhelming due to its size and if you do not have a great sense of direction it can become quite a task to find the right exit... It does follow the concept of any other shopping mall, high end shops are found on the higher levels, but the 'average bear' will have to venture underground where you will find the likes of ZARA, H&M, Forever 21 and Sephora... it also offers great food options. It is also very handy that it has its 'own' MRT stop. I found the shopping centre equally amazing from the outside at night, especially if you are into photography. It's a must see when you head down to Orchard Road, - would probably recommend to go there at night as it looks spectacular with all the lights."
,,If you love travelling on escalators.....,5.0,,"This place is crazy and a shoppers paradise. We went on Christmas Eve and it took an hour and a half to find our exit when we wanted to leave. Up and down the escalators go-some go just one floor, some go 2 floors, some go 3 floors-very amusing and never seen anything like it. The Information desk had a massive queue so asking for assistance would have required a very long wait so we grabbed a map. Every type of store imaginable is in this place plus there is a subway underneath and I think some sort of bus station. The higher the floor, the more expensive the shops become. I have given an excellent rating just out of sheer amazement that such a crazy place exists and with no easy way out in any direction-not for the faint hearted but fun and interesting anyway-grabbed a few bargains as many stores were having Christmas sales."
,,Yummy yumcha here,5.0,,"Love the Imperial Treasure (located at the foodcourt) which we dined regularly during our 4 day stay in Singapore. Service is pretty good. Savoury radish cake is the best I've ever had. Their mains are generous in portions and I love their roast duck. There is another Imperial Treasure in ION mall, I think it's on the top level. We only went to the one in the food court."
,,They've got everything,5.0,,"This is my centre. Top names, not so top names, everyone is covered. Cleanest toilets ive ever seen. Best cafe in Singapore Paris Baguette and the best yoghurt shop. Busy but not chaotic."
,,Free views of the city,5.0,,Between 3 and 6pm anyone can travel up to the viewing deck free of charge to the closed in viewing floor of Singapore. Quite a spot for tourist photos of the city with information written on the windows to give you an idea of where and what position you are taking the photos. Great find for tourists
,,Huge variety of affordable international and luxury brands!,5.0,,"Being from Australia I was drawn to brands that don't have stores in the city I live in. There were many luxury brands like Louis Vuitton in this mall but there were a lot of more affordable ones here too. Some are H&M, Forever 21 and Muji."
,,Good fourth court,4.0,,"The food court at ION Orchard is at Level B4. Though it was a week day, the place was packed. That's
always a good sign.
I decided to have a try at SCOTTS BEEF NOODLE. And that is exactly what I ordered.....the Beef Keuh Tiao. It was dry flat noodles cooked with light, subtle spices. The beef was soft and delicious. At Sing $ 8, it was a full meal.
Service was fast and I was back to my shopping at this iconic ION shopping mall."
,,Average,2.0,,"eh, erm, its just a fanciful mall. what's good about it is basically the wide range of retail outlets, food court (great variety of food) and the train station (orchard mrt), else, its just a centre piece along orchard road.

oh yes, things ain't cheap too."
,,Not that great.,3.0,,I wasn't too happy with this mall..It had the basic brands zara/bershka/H$M. I would prefer to shop at Vivo City. It has a larger range to shop from.
,,Great Views,4.0,,Super views of the city. Remember that it opens 3-6pm with the last entry at 5:30pm.. Well worth the trip up to the 55th floor and it's free.
,,Shopping,5.0,,"This place has everything what the shopper needs. From general household goods to $16,000 dollar watches"
,,Large mall with lots of shops!,4.0,,"This mall is very big with multiple levels, it's easy to spend several hours here if you are a shopping enthusiast! Lots of good brands available here and a plethora of dining options!"
,,What a view! And it's FREE!,5.0,,"The Ion Orchard is right next door to the Orchard Road MRT Station. It is open from 3pm until 6pm everyday with last admittance at 5:30pm. Admission is FREE. Take the lift or escalator to Level 4 and from there, take a lift to level 55/56. The escalator on Level 4 is hidden. You need to go through the gallery which is situated behind the ION service counter. But once you are at Level 55/56, just take your time. There is no time limit to be here, it is quiet and serene and cool (view wise and temperature wise)."
,,Shops shops shops,3.0,,Quite a few shops here. The air conditioning is a nice break from the heat outside and there are a lot of stores and food available.
,,"Awesome shopping center, everything's good!!",5.0,,"You will need a couple of hours to explore this shopping center and whatever you need, you can find it there. There are a lot of restaurants in this mall so no need to get out for a bite.
If you want to experience shopping in Singapore, that's the place you should go :)
Take an Uber instead of Taxi, it will cut your taxi charges in half."
,,Just another Boutique Mall in Singapore really,3.0,,"For me, ION Orchard is just another Boutique Mall in Singapore. Full of luxury and boutique brands, if you're cashed up and looking for glamour brands, you will enjoy this place. Situated on Orchard Road, it's accessible by taxi or public transport."
,,More for shopping really!,5.0,,"You need to shop some stuffs real quick with your gf and you aint got much time left , so what do you do?
This mall may not be as fantastic as marina bay sands but over here you can find quite a number of stores that caters for both men and ladies alike. They have hnm, levis, kate saturday, zara, uniqlo, sephora, victoria secret, burberry and longchamp boutique for the very least. On the top floor, there are quite a number of restaurants for fine dining. Do check them out. One of my fav shopping hangout in orchard."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"All main brands available. Upper you go, more expensive and luxury it gets. If timing is right, there will be grand sale e.g. after Xmas time, up to 50-70% off from the regular prizes... I bet that sama goes with all Singapore shopping malls :)"
,,Soaking in the festive mood,5.0,,"Admiring the festive lights and nice aroma of the shopping malls. From luxury brands to affordable brands, there is something for everyone. Good variety of food choices too! Easily accessible by MRT"
,,Branded shoppers Haven,4.0,,"The corner location is very accomodating to shopping enthusiasts. Branded items, designers, watches and bags they have it. This Christmas season, an eye catching attraction you will see in front a tall Christmas tree with tag, Swarovski, inside this tree you will experience optical illlusion of chandelier and mirror wall of blue and white lights."
,,Christmas at Ion Orchard,4.0,,"Went for the Christmas Decorations, events and to meet Santa and see the Ion Sky on the 55th floor. Between 4-7 all these can still be attended till 27th Dec"
,,Shopping crazy,5.0,,Awesome place to visit especially @ this time of Christmas. Every shop was decorated with Christmas light and it looked so beautiful and festive.
,,My staying for 3 days 2 nite check in 14-August-15 till 16-August-15,5.0,,Awesome building. Selling branded goods. Beautiful lighting. I went to Louis Vuitton boutique. Easy access to MRT. Not so crowded as many malls & shops around ION Orchard.
,,Upscale Mall,4.0,,"The icon of Orchard Road, ION houses giants from the fashion industry luxury brands like LV, Prada, Dior, Dolce and Gabbana and many more. Head up to ION Sky @ the 56th level for an awesome view of the city from 3 to 6pm daily."
,,Very big shopping mall,4.0,,"Huge shopping mall, with a wide range of shops. High end designer shops at the main levels, but also a food market at the basement. Good variety."
,,Huge with everything,4.0,,"This is a huge mall with all shops along the price spectrum. There is Uniqlo to Dolce

Some restaurants are also good here, like Taste Paradise Chinese to Salt on the roof with an incredible view

2 of the best art galleries in town are also here - Opera and Bartoux

,,My fave mall of all countries,5.0,,"Love ION. It has all the stores, MRT and fabulous food hall Had chilli crab today Clothing stores range from top luxury right down to H&M so suit all budgets Worth a visit, actually it's a must visit"
,,Shopping centre,4.0,,"Yep just another shopping centre (mall) on orchard road , and I've never seen more of them , than in Singapore , but this ones , alright , better than most , great air conditioning , great for people watching , and probably shopping too"
,,Nice and big shopping mall,5.0,,"Nice and big shopping mall on Orchard street connected to the Orchard SMRT. Is really big one lots of high end brands like Prada, Gucci, LV, D&G and more, grate food court with Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Malaesiana food choices. Outside at night is a spectacular show of light. Good choice for a shopping session. The mall has a tower with a free skypark open from 15.00 to 18.00"
,,Thomas Sabo Store,4.0,,There are about four stores in Singapore but if you are a fan of Thomas Sabo please go to the one in ION Orchard. Don't waste your time with the others. The sales assistant whose name I forget is a lovely lady. She is extremely helpful and personable and she spent a lot of time with me. I was trying to find a ring but as I have chubby fingers she didn't have my size. She then went through all her rings to find all the ones in my size and when I found two I like she searched the other stores to see if they had the next size up for me. In the end I have decided to follow my head and order them when I get back to the UK in the correct size.
,,Fantastic Panoramic views for FREE at ION Orchard,4.0,,"Anyone looking for a great vantage point for Singapore should consider going here as part of their itinerary.
Orchard Road is a very lively and bustling part of the city with row upon row of shopping malls and food courts and street acts throughout the year leading up to the Ion Orchard Mall and tower block complex.
the mall itself is relatively small but with numerous high end shops to keep shoppers happy, but for those with a lust for heights you need to head firstly to the 4th floor art gallery and enter for free all day. However, the tower entrance is only open from 3-6pm with last admissions around 5.30, this is a little restrictive as I feel there is some fantastic night views to be missed, but it is free so its not a bad trade off.
Once in the art gallery which is one large open plan room with 25 or so paintings, there is a dedicated lift with security staff to control the mild flow of people that will take you to the 55th floor.
once up on the top of the tower there is a restaurant and almost 360 views of Singapore to be had and these come complete with video monitors kind of like 21st century binoculars which will show side by side images and zoom on whatever you like in real time as well as night time and day time prerecorded video images of what it is like to see what you are seeing in different times of day, overall by comparison to some of the other towers which can charge up to S$30/£15/$22 per person for a view, this is by far the better option for those on a budget or just looking to kill some time whilst the other half shops."
,,High End Retail,4.0,,"Huge shopping precint with lots of high end retail labels (LV, Chanel, Tiffany and Co, D&G etc) not for the shy or money conscious!!"
,,Extremely Poor Service,1.0,,"The counter staff at JTB are just interested in serving their customers. Despite being 5th in the line, I had to wait for over an hour to talk to a service rep. This is thanks to the 3rd and 4th persons walking out. The staff seem to be more keen to talk to each other and taking their time doing unnecessary things rather than serving their customers. I have also tried calling the hotline, but no one has ever picked up the phone. What is wrong with the people there? This is not how a Japanese organisation should operate. I am deeply disappointed."
,,The Mall of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the place to go to if you want to visit the top most luxury brands of the world under one roof. Well even if you cant buy them, this is a great place to visit and spend an afternoon."
,,Poor service experience,2.0,,"I was enjoying my shopping spree at the many outlets in Ion and my last stop was to purchase some accessories. Decided to enter this Chomel store at the basement. While I was looking around in the store for a suitable item, the team of sales girls were happily chit chatting at the top of their voices and I wasn't offered help until minutes later. I picked a few items to make a closer comparison. While I was trying to put a brooch that I decided not to buy back onto the rack, it fell onto the floor shortly after I hung it up on the rack. I picked it up and to my horror, it broke. Instead of leaving it on the display table, I felt compelled to bring it back to the sales girls to inform them about this. I approached this lady called Connie Lee and to my surprise, she blatantly told me that I have to pay for the broken item! All this time, she was busy with her stocktaking, with her back facing me and did not even turn her face to look at me when speaking to me! Utterly turned off with her service attitude, at the same time feeling bullied when I was told they could not even help to glue the broken item back. I do not mind paying since it was partly my fault. All in all, I conclude that the product is of inferior quality and I definitely will not go back to this outlet again to subject myself to such low service standards from the sales stuff."
,,Big mall and nice interior,4.0,,"We went here to buy some clothes. The interior is good, and the price of the things here quite reasonable."
,,Place to shop,5.0,,It is a fantastic shopping mall from md range to very high end fashion.The food court caters to many taste buds.

,,Mega Mall at Orchard & Scott's Road,4.0,,"From a great food hall to a free 54th floor observatory (ION Sky) this is an amazing mall. It is directly connected to the MRT Orchard station, so getting here is a breeze. You can eat, shop, wander and more. Take a while to see how quality and quantity can mix with good design and helpful staff."
,,Huge place,4.0,,One can actually get lost in a mall the size of this ! where virtually Eveything under the sun is avaliable !
,,Best shopping in town,5.0,,I love to shopping at ION Orchard because have a lot of thing to buy for many brand products and I recommend to all people especially lady you will love. I found so products discount start from 10% to 50% off.
,,Large mall,5.0,,As I guy I don't really like shopping But for a woman this place would be like heaven. So many shops on so many floors. Nice and clean and connected to so many other malls
,,Large shopping mall,4.0,,Ion on orchard is on 12 floors 4 below ground and 8 above. The food hall is located on B4 . Food reasonably priced. There is an observation deck which offers great views (on days without haze) Loads of shops in here from high street to high end so something for everyone. I did find the layout confusing but did eventually find an exit! Easy to get to by public transport or sightseeing tour bus.
,,Good parking rates,5.0,,"Weekday after 5pm its just a low 3.50 per entry! Wow, I save enough money to enjoy a macdonald burger meal. Imagine all the money you can save while parking there"
,,Very Ritzy,5.0,,This place has all the ritzy shops in so bring your money. We were staying just off Orchard Road and had to go underground to get to this shopping centre. You have no idea you are in the centre except the sign states this. It has so many shops. But quiet expensive to Australia. On B4 they have the food hall. This is very cheap for a meal but you only really have a choice between local and asian dining. Very fresh and very nice at a cheap price. The pizza place just near guardians is nice also. There are so many shops . It will take a while if wanting to look at all the shops. If arriving fom the MRT hop off at Orchard station and just there as you tap you travel card to get out of the top of the station
,,Place to shop,5.0,,It is a fantastic shopping mall from md range to very high end fashion.The food court caters to many taste buds.

,,Large mall,5.0,,As I guy I don't really like shopping But for a woman this place would be like heaven. So many shops on so many floors. Nice and clean and connected to so many other malls
,,Large shopping mall,4.0,,Ion on orchard is on 12 floors 4 below ground and 8 above. The food hall is located on B4 . Food reasonably priced. There is an observation deck which offers great views (on days without haze) Loads of shops in here from high street to high end so something for everyone. I did find the layout confusing but did eventually find an exit! Easy to get to by public transport or sightseeing tour bus.
,,Good parking rates,5.0,,"Weekday after 5pm its just a low 3.50 per entry! Wow, I save enough money to enjoy a macdonald burger meal. Imagine all the money you can save while parking there"
,,Very Ritzy,5.0,,This place has all the ritzy shops in so bring your money. We were staying just off Orchard Road and had to go underground to get to this shopping centre. You have no idea you are in the centre except the sign states this. It has so many shops. But quiet expensive to Australia. On B4 they have the food hall. This is very cheap for a meal but you only really have a choice between local and asian dining. Very fresh and very nice at a cheap price. The pizza place just near guardians is nice also. There are so many shops . It will take a while if wanting to look at all the shops. If arriving fom the MRT hop off at Orchard station and just there as you tap you travel card to get out of the top of the station
,,Has what you need an more,5.0,,You come to expect this from Orchard Rd. Great shopping centre with many options from high class to mid and low range options as well. Good food is also here. Orchard Rd is great but this place has the edge on the rest.
,,Nice view for free,5.0,,Use this tower to have a view over SIngapore. It is somehow difficult to find the way but it is for free. The vie is nice but not comparable with the one from Marina Bay Sands Skypark.
,,Amazingly big,4.0,,"There are so many shops but all of them are seen in other locations. As it is located on top of Orchard station, it is convenient if you are a visitor with limited time for shopping. Food court is good as they offer good choices."
,,Good food selection,4.0,,There are a lot of good food and especially dessert selection at this mall (lower ground). Kinda crowded on Sunday evening .
,,Center to everything.,4.0,,"One can get here with any of the Singapore transport system. A giant maze of shopping space and everything else, above the ground and under. My trips here always end at the fabulous food court at the lower floor."
,,Excellent shopping mall,5.0,,"Located on Orchard Road, this is one of the biggest shopping mall in Singapore. Very advanced, you will find here all the thing under one roof, even SMRT station. Well connected place. Nice for evening walk and hang out!"
,,The latest and biggest shopping centre in Orchard Road,5.0,,"Basically all the big brands are here from watches to bags. The shops in front of the building are huge. U can almost find anything here and the food court has a huge variety of local foods. There is a high end aparment above the shopping centre. It's the latest and most beautiful shopping centre in Orchard Road, be sure to check it out"
,,good location,4.0,,"MRT station and shopping centre, good central location on Orchard Rd, if you have accommodation around this area you are well located."
,,Shop in style,4.0,,"The MRT station is right under this building so its absolutely convenient to get here. The architecture is interesting and classy. This arcade holds a number of high end stores like Prada, LV etc. There are many mid and low end brands to sustain the interest of any shopper. Several dining options available."
,,Nice Place to Window Shopping,3.0,,If you looking cheap... then just cross the road to the LUCKY PLAZA but skip Sundays 1000 of Filipinas coming there. you can buy Brandad perfumes half of their original prices.
,,"Ion Sky experience - a Must See unique feature of this beautiful mall, Ion Orchard....",5.0,,"Ion Orchard is a beautiful huge mall, probably the biggest in Orchard Road. It is also one of the nicest mall in Orchard, with a luxurious ambience. It is directly linked to Orchard MRT.

Due to its mega size, it offers very wide ranges & choices of shops & dining. One can find almost anything here - from High end Luxury brands to mid range (eg H&M), to low end ( eg Daiso Japan $2 store).

An Unique Must-See feature of this mall is the Ion Sky . It is situated right at the top 56th floor of Ion Orchard. Not many tourists are aware of this place. It is a pity to miss it.

Here, one can see the stunning landscape of the city in 360 degrees view.

And admission is FREE. Yes, FREE! It is open from 3-6pm daily. Last entry is 5.30pm. You need to go to the Information counter (can't remember exactly but think it is on Level 4) to register & take the lift from there to Ion Sky."
,,Just another mall,4.0,,"Well it's like junle of malls in singapore, but you can definitely get good food and nice stuff in this one. Actually that's it. Good place for shopping and dining."
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,"The place is very clean, not so many people, just where the ion mrt is located, many shops to choose from H&M, Marks and Spencer, Mango, I'm not sure if they have esprit. Timberland , Crocodile, crocs, many other shops and coffeshops. great place to unwind."
,,Visit ground floor first,4.0,,"Shops, shops and more shops. Many floors below ground and above ground. On the bottom floor there was a $2.00 Shop a wonderful find in this mall of expensive shops"
,,Great shopping mall,4.0,,A big shopping mall with street and high brand.it is easy to access and have some nice dining options from cafe/bar to tea house and restaurants.
,,Huge Mall,4.0,,"It's a huge mall, with a variety of shops inside. Getting here is simple, by either a bus or the easiest, MRT which stops inside the mall itself. A variety of restaurants, but lack of fast food, such as McDonalds which you need to walk across the street to get. You'll be able to find most of the brand name shops in this mall."
,,Good Range of Shops,5.0,,"Enjoyed this mall a lot. There's a good range of shops for most people, whether you shop high end designer stuff or if you like more inexpensive stuff like Forever 21. Be aware of the aforementioned Forever 21 though - it is the most annoying one to find your way around in that I have ever been to (and it seemed like it had 20 exits, though I think it was actually only 3 or 4). It took me longer to figure out where the exit was that I left my boyfriend at than to look around the store.

FYI - if you are coming from North America, be aware that many of the North American brands in this mall were a good 20% more expensive than they are at home. This is true for any mall in Singapore and in Malaysia too. So I guess keep that in mind if you're North American and don't want to waste money. Not sure about other brands, but stuff like Mango and Zara were about the same as they were in Spain, or anywhere else I've been (but I believe both of those are based out of Spain, that's why I mentioned them for comparison).

The mall also has free wifi, which was really handy when I was trying to double check on some of the prices. As I said, there's a good spread of stores here and I got some great deals while we were there around Chinese New Year (though the mall was pretty packed). It's a good place to go if you got to Singapore and want to shop but you don't know where to start - especially if you are staying near Orchard. Vivo City is pretty comparable in terms of the stores on offer, at least for the kind of shops I like, so that might be better if you're staying closer to there, not really worth the time to do both unless you REALLY want to. There's also a nice food court on the bottom floor with lots of choices."
,,Shopping Delight,5.0,,"Want to have a a full fletch shopping experience. ION Shopping mall is the place to go. International Brands all rounded (e.g. H&M Charles&Keith Topshop/Man Zara Forever 21) and on the upper floors they have more high end brands such as Chanel Prada Etc etc...

Basically the higher you go, the more expensive the retailers branding position are.

However, at the basement, you have a wide selection of food choices to your liking ranging from Japanese to fast food to desserts to local delights.

Their also famous for their toilets though. haha weird but it's really to be commented.

ION have their distinct ION Scent that is only exclusive to them

In terms of convenience, their location basically hit the jack pot of directly connected to Orchard MRT Station and may different passage links to all the other malls in the area such as Tangs, Wheelock, Wisma etc etc....

Unless you are not looking for big brands, then ION is not for you."
,,Real Shopping,5.0,,ION shopping mall you can find very thing you want . all luxuries & Famous brands ..etc price of products are reasonable .
,,Nice Mall To Visit!,4.0,,"Located directly above Orchard MRT, this is shopping central.

There are many high-end shops that sells fashion and watches on the upper floors and mid-segment fashion on the basement levels.

There are also restaurants and eateries where you can pop in for a quick meal or sit-down meal.

There is a nice restaurant and viewing gallery at the top of the building that allows you to have a panaromic 360 view of the surroundings.

From this mall, you can connect easily to any parts of Singapore.

Worth a visit!"
,,upmarket expensive and intimidating,3.0,,If you want to grab a bargain this is not the place for you. This is an upmarket shopping experience that can be intimidating at times. The shopping centre also has a museum feel to it . It does have a wow factor associated with it too.
,,WOW ! ! Philip Stein Earth Frequency Timepieces !,5.0,,"We specially fly to Singapore to go to the Philip Stein Store. : within the ION Mall,
to buy several Philip Stein Dual face, Earth Frequency watches..Expensive. Unique .. jet lag prevention Earth Frequency chipped , beautiful timepieces.

Great for long haul air travel , destressing, grounding and chilling out.

The Sleep bracelets are expensive , yet work well, plus like the unique earth frequency watches , great for ADHD , and relaxation and better refreshed sleep. All these only available within the ION mall , in Singapore.. Forget about Rolex , Cartier, Breitling , etc. do yourself and your loved one a favour..go to the Philip Stein Asia Watch shop within ION Mall.. get a watch, to change your life forever."
,,Big sale in June,4.0,,We are very lucky because it is big sale in Singapore in June! Most of the brands are on discount sale!! For example the slippers are only SGD 5!! We bought a lot!
,,Just Above the MRT Station,3.0,,"This mall is actually the one that is not in my plan to visit. Luckily, the Orchard MRT station is just below the mall, so when we exited the station, we found out that we already in this mall. The mall itself is like typical Orchard mall with many stuff they offer. For me, there is nothing remarkable here."
,,Best mall in Orchard,4.0,,"Connected to the MRT Station, a very big shopping Mall with plenty of restaurant, food court, and shops. Connected to the iSetan mall and Takasimaya."
,,Ion- conveniently linked if you are in Orchard Road,4.0,,"It's very convenient to go to Ion when you are in the Orchard Road area. There is a series of underground connecting walkways which leads you to Ion. The fact that there is an MRT station is a big plus as well. Lots of shopping to be expected what with the fantastic line-up of shops/boutiques, local and foreign. They also have a good food court on B4 as well as some restaurants in another level. Lots of people though so be patient when you're walking around ION."
,,I ON mall is the Perfect link to all other malls,4.0,,"Shopping is our national time. We will shop at least 2 times a week.

First, it is located within the orchard MRT.
Second, It has many shops within the mall and it links to other malls within the vicinity. So you can shop here and there walk internally to 5 other malls directly and more indirectly. Wow!
In fact we should have a shopping tour just here.

Third, the basement housed food court with variety of in expensive food, fast food, restaurants, food counters (eat and go). Food and shopping goes hand in hand.

Fourth, there are supermarket, pharmacy, convenient stores. Telephone provider, sport shops. On the lower flours and basements are more mass products like H&M, Victoria Secret ( it is secret so you have to find it yourself) , Berska, etc. But on mid floors are branded stores hut mid range like guess, top shop, etc. and higher floors, you see more expensive brands, Katespade, Agnes b, etc..
There is definitely something for everyone. I still think that the prices here are cheaper than elsewhere when you compare brand to brand. Of course some American brands can be cheaper during sale in the US like Katespade, DYNY

Fifth, there are also coffee shop or cafes in different floors starting from basement. So you can shop, take a break and shop till you drop.

You need to visit to see what you like.

From here you are linked to Wisma atria, Takashimaya on right and on left you go to Wheelock place, Isetan and Tangs.

This is by far the best area where shopping is concerned.

Again, the orchard MRT can link you further o Somerset area like 313, orchard central, etc. Or further to plaza Singapura.

A must visit for an awesome mall!

For what sort of visit, i have to say all but it does not allow all??"
,,"Outstanding luxury ""brand"" shopping",5.0,,"This centre is just awesome if one is shopping for luxury brands. The shops are just beautiful and the window displays are fabulous. It is large and one could get lost very easily. Singapore is expensive, but so easy to spend money here! This is a must-visit shopping centre!"
,,Ion has everything but the best is Food Opera,5.0,,"A friend from work recommended for me to check this place out because of the food court they have here, and she was so right, the best food I had in Singapore was here at Food Opera its on b1 or b2 of the Ion shopping mall. The mall itself is great all the labels you could expect to find here. The food though, amazing and incredibly cheap we loved it so much we came here three times during our five day stay each time we stuffed ourselves and the bill max was around $30-$35. Fabulous! If you are in Orchard Road I guarantee this place won't disappoint."
,,Big mall but i never enjoyed it,3.0,,"Big mall, lots of brands, but their basement floors corridors are tight and old style. I dont think they have good variety when it comes to the foodcourt/ fastfood restaurants in the basement."
,,Shop till you drop....,4.0,,"You want great shopping here, give your missus your credit card and say goodbye...haha. Level after level of shops with clothes, shoes, perfumes, etc. I just carried the bags."
,,A maze of sorts,4.0,,"A warning, you may get lost in this mall during your first visit. I still do sometimes. Great thing about this mall not only that it's huge, but well divided by the levels and section to each shoppers needs from luxury brands, mainstream brands, to a Jewelry street in the basement. Plenty of restaurant selections available upstairs and great convenience with the MRT right under the building."
,,Wow,4.0,,"Ion has been given the status of ASIAONE PEOPLE'S CHOICE BEST CITY SHOPPING CENTRE. They hold many events here. Rewards Card is available to enjoy shopping vouchers and complimentary entries to the Butterfly House.

There is a Visitor Center at Level 1 to help tourists. Cell Phone chargers for free charging are available. You can book a cab at their concierge counters. Art Gallery, Exhibitions, and many more attractions are here.

ION SKY at 56 level is worth mentioning. See 360 view of Singapore from here. Viewing Time: 3 to 6 pm daily. Admission is free. Must try once."
,,Something for Everybody,5.0,,"ION is one of the very best shopping malls in the heart of Orchard Road directly across from Tangs. In a relaxed atmosphere, it caters to shoppers of all types and has far more than designer label clothing stores. It's absolutely massive with walkways in every direction. There are two subway entrances, a walkway from Orchard Boulevard to the Orchard MRT station, and a walkway leading to Wheelock Place on the other side of Scotts Road. Even though ION uses excellent signage, I frequently get turned around. There are plenty of information desks around, though, for asking directions.

In addition to shops of all sorts, ION has numerous cafes, restaurants and offices. Singapore Airlines has a very efficient service office on the 4th floor of ION (#04-05). Take the multi-story escalator! There is also a post office (SingPost) at Basement Level 2 along Jewelry Street which is a convenient place for tourists to mail things home. Camera bugs will love the ION Sky view of the city on levels 55 and 56, too.

There's lots to see and do at ION!"
,,Back again,4.0,,Back again After one year and half I visit ION Mall Again It is still nice one I relaxed there at one of the cafes I enjoy roaming in that MAll at Orchard
,,Go to level 55 & 56 Ion Sky for free 360 degree view of the city.,4.0,,"To get here, go to level 4 of Ion Shopping Centre. Look out for concierge and there is a lift that will bring you to the roof top directly (lift is at the back of concierge and need to walk past an open area that normally used as gallery).

Glass wall area with clean toilets, some seats and free binoculars."
,,High end mall but lots to do and see,4.0,,"A mixture or high end and ""normal"" brands, this place has something for everybody. It's a massive place so wear comfortable shoes!"
,,GOOD MALL WITH HEAPS OF SHOPS!!!!!,4.0,,Good variety of stores to keep you busy for a couple hours! Just part of our shopping day to Orchard Road.
,,Shopping center,5.0,,"Best way for you whos like a fashion, make up. Go to orchard road and you can find anything and will make you falling in love with any stuffs you'll see :3"
,,An Architectural Flop,1.0,,"I am so sorry but I do think that this is The Ugliest Building that I have ever seen. Of course, I have only been to 18 countries, so my opinion may not count. What were the builders, owners, town council thinking? Reminds me of ""the emperor with no clothes"" syndrome. Otherwise, it is a great place to spend real cash shopping."
,,Plenty of high end shops,3.0,,This is the place to go but only if you are a shopoholic. It has plenty of high end shops on multiple floors. It even has a few floors below ground level and a MRT station. There is also an underground walkway from the other side of the street.
,,Shopper's paradise!,5.0,,"What's not to like about ION? If you're looking to shop high street brands from the world, this is the place to go to. I did not find their online site too helpful, and could not plan my shopping in advance. But once there, I ended up spending a lot more time than I had thought I would."
,,i love this mall,5.0,,"i can find just anything, shoes, clothing, food, even essential oils, various brands from all over the world. a very busy mall but i'd love to visit Ion more and more 😊"
,,Best mall at Orchard Road,5.0,,I love this mall so much in Singapore. It's very accessible because of the MRT station connected with the mall. A lot of high end brand here. The foodcourt is really nice too
,,"Lots of Stores, Huge Crowds",3.0,,"Multi level, mostly high-end stores on Orchard. ION Mall is known for it’s size and prices. The majority of stores were well-known American, British and Italian brands. The food court was a mix of fast food and there were many restaurants throughout."
,,shopping galore,4.0,,"shopping mall with luxury brands,you will be amazed how you can find all you want in one store.but you will also be amazed in there prizes..."
,,incredible,5.0,,"ION plaza is in the middle of orchard rd, with some of the best shopping in Singapore! Not bargains, but still incredible. you can always find something that you are looking for there! It is huge above and below ground with an MRT station underneath, making it easy access from anywhere in Singapore. I loved shopping here as the sheer multitude of shops were incredible. It is child friendly with a whole lot of shops for them, as well as a huge food court! Worth checking out as Singapore is known for its incredible shopping! It is by far one of the cleanest shopping centres that I have been to, something that also adds to the incredulity of it! The architecture of the mall itself is also amazing, so take a chance to look at the building from the outside, as it really is awesome! =)"
,,Cool,5.0,,"Massive shopping centre with a wide range of shops to look at and right next to the orchard MRT, has an amazing food opera in the basement with a wide range of Asian food"
,,One of the best,5.0,,This is one of the best shopping malls in orchard road. It's very clean and have various types of clothings stores and restaraunts in it. Toilet is also very clean in this mall. And it's also linked with orchard MRT station.
,,nice mall,4.0,,"This mall was beautifully decorated for the Chinese New Year. As nice as mall for Christmas. Singapore not a bargin spot, but good shopping."
,,Good variety of shops!,4.0,,"ION Orchard is directly connected to the Orchard MRT station which makes it super convenient to access. There is a wide variety of high end and street fashion shops. There is also a good variety of shops that we don't yet have/have many of in Australia e.g. Bershka, Chomel, H&M, Forever 21, UNIQLO, Coach etc.

Be sure to visit the ION SKY on the 55th (56th?) floor of the building. Access if free for everyone. access from the 4th floor concierge. We had a fairly clear (almost 360 degree) 11am view of much of Singapore. Last trip up the elevator is at 7:30pm."
,,Great to visit,5.0,,"On holidays we passed through ION on our way to the Orchard MTR every day. Loved the boppy little music playing every time we neared! We tried the Ice Kachang in the Food Opera in the basement. Delicious!! There are other food options too not in the seated area. Heaps of shops, some very upmarket. ION Sky on 55/56 floors. Would have liked to try the free food tour in the middle of the day, but needed extra days in our holiday to do it and other things. There is a Tourist Information area too . (Floor 2??) The singapore orchids were beautiful."
,,Great,5.0,,Great mall right on orchard rd. You can get in the mall right tru de mrt station which makes things easier when its raining.
,,Shoppers heaven,4.0,,"Went here with the GF and just got lost for hours. You could walk around all day and still not see every shop.

Shops vary between high end brands to more cheaper ones throughout.

Food courts are everywhere which can cater to anyone's needs, with more or less every countries food available.

Your GF will love this place. BF may want to kill himself after."
,,"ION is great, but there are some amazing hidden gems inside...",5.0,,"The shopping mall overall is really great, not only because the moment you get out of the MRT you are already inside ION, but also because of the huge variety of shops and food places.

About food: The Food Opera (Food Court) is amazing. We went there a couple of times because food was really good and value for money. Especially enjoyed the He fen. But the best place of all is this little shop called Subway, with the most amazing sweets. I had their Kuih Dadar (basically a green crepe filled with coconut) and it was out of this world. I also tried some other desserts, again really good, but I still dream about that Kuih Dadar...

Drinks: I love bubble tea, and there was my favourite chain shop CoCo right next to the food court. But on the other side, as you go out of the MRT there is another drinks place, which I feel so bad I don't remember the name. They had crazy good winter melon bubble tea. I cannot explain how good it was. I went back for a second cup!

Shopping: Every brand is there. There is lots of people at the Charles & Kieth there, and you might probably be able to go to another not so crowded one. I liked this shoe shop called Pedro. And as I sad all the brands are there."
,,Sparkling mall,4.0,,"Shop my all means, level 1 and 2 for Gucci, Longines, Tiffany etc. and high teas for the well off (all very well and proper), while b1 to b4 for middle and lower. At a high level floor shop, we actually saw a Singaporean lady paid for couple of clothing items, each priced at a few hundred bobs. She simply picked and paid, always with a smile on her face, umh...
We enjoyed ourselves too, admired the luxury and headed for the food court at the basement for some good tummy warmings. They were a bit cheaper and very satisfying.
Ion department is very convenient by mrt (right in the basement) and plenty of buses on Orchard Rd (going South) and the road at the back of the store (going North).
Visit Ion Orchard was such an experience as a tourist attraction, and we did went back several times due to use of the mrt thoroughfare."
,,Fabulous food and shopping- best in Orchard,5.0,,"Ion is iconic and very well managed. It has a great reception manned by friendly and well-mannered staff. Famous for its boutiques, jewellers, food and entertainment - it houses the world best names. Some of my favorite destinations at Ion Mall are;
The Imperial steamboat, Honeymoon desserts, Jasons, Taiwan fishball, popiah( at the Food court), Jeric hair salon, Toss & Turn, and also also its many little kiosks.
Ion is international and also has an underground transport access. A great stop for the family."
,,Walk outside,3.0,,"We ended up at ION Orchard by mistake. When we exited the MTR, we were pleased to see so many nice shops and wonder food options. The free wifi was a nice bonus. However, don't limit yourself to the inside of this location and be sure to walk outside and see how beautiful Orchard street is and all the interesting sites and people outside the ION."
,,This place is too big,4.0,,"This place is big, and confusing. Whenever you go it is packed and because it mainly below ground it lacks any real light or atmosphere"
,,Oh dear,5.0,,"Do you want to get lost in shops, food courts and great decoration? Then, that's the place to go. You might find, what you're looking for and you don't need to leave the air conditioned zone ;)"
,,My favourite,5.0,,I enjoyed my shopping experience the best at ION Orchard. I loved the combination of varied shops and lovely food court with many great restaurants to try. The interior is interesting and well marked. Great shopping!
,,Excellent Decoration,4.0,,"Most of shopping mall on Orchard road were high class with famous brand name with no exception of ION mall. However, the mall was very unique and modern decoration. It was fascinating to walk around and see beautiful shop decoration eventhough all shops were pricey but to spend some hours walking around this mall was truly worthwhile and recommend to visit with very convenient from MRT access."
,,All favorites brands in one roof,4.0,,"All my favorites brands in one roof, what a wonderful place to shop. there are 4 basement floor make sure you won't get lose."
,,Very crowded,3.0,,The shopping centre is situated above the MRT station so it is very accessible for everyone. The choices for the restaurants and shops are also varied. The downside was only it was very crowded during busy hours and weekend. It's better to visit early in the morning or during weekdays. The toilets were hidden but they have a lot of cubicles in one toilet.
,,Convenient but may be confusing,4.0,,"Lots of shops and places to eat. The building is located along Orchard Road, and is easily accessible by bus, MRT and taxis. It is always busy and crowded whenever I visit (mainly on weekends), but still enjoyable enough to stroll around window shopping."
,,Great Place To Shop!,5.0,,"Many different types of shops ranging from branded goods to pharmaceutical products. If you ever are lost or want to find the location of a particular shop, just ask a concierge or use the electronic touch screen map."
,,Expensive shops. Bad layout.,2.0,,It's quite easy to get lost in the mall as it is weirdly constructed. Lots of designer brands so everything is generally expensive. There is nothing really to buy here. Singapore airlines head office is located in the 6th floor. There are some shops which are affordable but they are little n all compared to the majority of the shops. DO NOT DRIVE HERE. PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE.
,,Really good,5.0,,Really good mall with LOTS of shops. If you ever need good products go here! Food court is really good quality with some really good food
,,fav place to shop!,5.0,,"the location is in the centre, so strategic. almost all brand i love were there. the food court is yum too and not very expensive. luvvv ion"
,,Can find neither the proper exit nor the store I am looking for,2.0,,"I have been many times passing through this shopping mall, simply because I needed to go to the MRT station or go to the other side of one of the roads. Their signs, that are supposedly giving direction, are complicated, illogical, can at several place not be seen, so that you do not know which way to go to. When the mall was new, I had several times to ask for direction on how to get out of the mall again. This is the ideal mall to keep people inside and entertained by shopping, but it is also the most unpractical mall. I do not go there for shopping anymore. I wonder how people would exit in an emergency."
,,Lock up that credit card!,4.0,,"I haven't a clue how many shops there are here but there must be something for everyone. Has its own MRT station and numerous places to eat. Top brands are available here which if you have left that credit card in the room safe, at...More"

,,Must visit for shopholics,5.0,,"Omg this place is supe awesome for all the shopholic out. From high end brands like lv,gucci,prada etc to medium ones like aldo,victoria secret, uniqlo,zara,forever 21 etc it has it all. Huge place to explore & needs time. It a paradise & bliss to shop...More"
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Great range of shops though I'm not crazy about the layout. And you can always have a break in the food court level B4.
,,Top 3,4.0,,"1 of my favorite malls, with all the high-end brands, and some medium end ones too. There is the only Dsquared store in town, plus 2 great art galleries. The Paradise dynasty and Salt grill restaurants are also very good"
,,Another big mall,3.0,,"Very busy on weekends, especially in the lower levels where because of the low ceilings there may be a tendency to feel slightly claustrophobic. Plenty of good places to eat, but better to try them on a weekday to avoid the crowds."
,,Never bored shopping theree,3.0,,"I fell fall in love with this shopping central in orcard road,espesially ion orchard,spend my time to go shopping till night,splendor of light as long the road of orchard...love it"
,,Endless shopping,5.0,,"So much shopping!! We had to visit this centre twice to see everything! Plenty of shopping for gifts, clothes, shoes, and beauty products! Etude house, Victoria's Secret, DC shop and Samantha Thavasa were some of my favorites. Wish I had bought more, the sheer size...More"
,,Great Shopping Location,4.0,,"Great Shopping Location, right next to the MRT Station Orchard. There is everything if your looking for some valuable fashion shops."
,,Great variety,4.0,,Huge variety of different shops. But everything is pretty expensive. Free Wi-Fi is available in the whole centre.
,,Nice upscale mall,4.0,,"A very nice, modern upscale mall. The lower level especially gets very crowded near the MRT entrance. The upper floors with higher end stores is fairly deserted and calm and makes for relaxing shopping. The rooftop observation deck is no longer free make a dinner reservstion."
,,A shopping paradise,5.0,,"People come to Sing for marathons and races, I shamefully come to shop at the Ion. The triad of shopping for me in Sing is the Ion, the Paragon, and Takashimaya. The Ion haseverything; major fashion houses, pen shops. jewellery fashion powerhouses like Uniqlo in a workable, not-too-big beautiful environment. And best of all when you get tired of it, all the malls are connected. You never have to leave air conditioning when you go to Takashimaya. ion sits in the heart of Orchard."
,,Nice and Convenient,4.0,,"ION is one of the better shopping malls. It has good variety of shops, cool and clean and connected to Orchard MRT station so easy to get to. Mostly high end brand shops but again worth the visit if you like to browse or looking for designer items."
,,Central.underground station and mall,4.0,,"Ion mall is right over orchard mrt station and is the crossroad/junction of many other malls in the area.

Ion houses most (if not all) of the high end brands and most of the normal brands
Ion is also home to a number of good restaurants

You wouldnt be in orchard road if you dint go to orchard road."
,,Great place connected to MRT,4.0,,I was here couple of times when i was in singapore. The place was connected to Orchard MRT. Its a huge shopping center and one can find all the brands. Good place for window shoppers also.
,,"wow, cool area, connected to mrt",4.0,,great shopping nice location in the center of shopping lots of huge malls in the area lots of food choices go early
,,My go-to for shopping,4.0,,"With the opening of H&M along with other affordable brands mixed in with high end brands, I often find I hardly need to leave this shopping centre and go elsewhere. It is often very busy, but it has a huge variety of stores with everything you could need and more."
,,Bring your wallet,3.0,,Great for window shopping...lousy unless you're loaded and much like others on Orchard Rd it seemed to repeat the shops as in every other shopping mall.
,,Can't rate it any better with so many other malls to choose from,3.0,,There's a convenient concierge on every floor. The mall feels new. It's clean and spacious. Shops are no different from all the other ones you can find in the never ending shopping strip of orchard road
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Quite an amazing and extravagant mall. Beautiful architecture. Way to expensive for my liking and for most people I assume because it was emptyish, unlike the food court on basement level 4 which was full of people."
,,5-Star Shopping Experience,5.0,,"From the moment you got off the cab at the drop-off area you know you're in for an experience. They have valet service and they assisted us getting off our cab and getting the prams out of the boot. For a moment, we thought we were checking into a hotel!

Then there are the choices of brands, you get all the luxury flagship brands from ground up, and you get your mass market brands like Zara, H&M, Uniqlo right down to the cheap $2 Daiso shop, and they are located from basement down.

Then you get the Food Opera (food court) at the bottom floor, plenty to choose from and decently priced. The MRT is conveniently located in the basement too.

It's highly recommended if you were up for some shopping in Singapore, but I think a lot people get put off by the expensive brands as you enter the mall and never really get to visit the more affordable brands at the basement because you wouldn't know until you find your way down there."
,,Not the best but good mall,4.0,,"We didn't intend to go shopping but the way ION arranging their mall was just so great that we stepped out of the mall with loads of good stuffs (or the mall made us believe that what we bought were good lol) Plus point for easy access to MRT. However, it's kinda crowded so I feel a lil bit annoying when shopping"
,,Always give it a go when in city state,4.0,,"Ion Orchard is probably one of the biggest shopping centers and one of the coolest in my opinion as it has everything and always make a stop here whenever I make a visit to the city state. If you're looking for brand names like H&M, Fossil, Armani Exchange, Calvin Klein, Zara or Pull & Bear, or an endless selection of eateries then this is the place to go. One of the floors also has the super high end brand names like Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Giorgio Armani, than this may be your place too.

Once you emerge from turnstiles from the Orchard MRT, there is a large touch screen directory against a wall that can viewed to see what it is you would like to visit and there are always attendants (in business suits) to which you can ask if still unsure of where to go. There is also a really cool grocery store called The Gourmet Grocer on an underground level and the far end of the shopping center and has a great selection of wines and foods not to mention a huge list of choices to go to for places to eat and there's actually a really good bakery at the far end of the underground food court called Bread Society and features some really good pastries, and breads.

Always a cool time when going to this shopping center and it definitely has some nice stores to check out (even if you don't necessarily buy anything)"
,,Shop till drop,4.0,,"This Shopping Mall is one of the latest addition on Orchard Road ,kinda new.

,,best shopping mall in sg,5.0,,"Whenever I come to sg I always go to ion, you can get anything u need here, from banking experience to the stores. Even the washroom are super clean and the staff attendant was very nice ... :D"
,,Shoppers Heaven,4.0,,"Ion is probably one of the more expensive properties when it comes to shopping. You name the brand, and it is in this property, and if it is not, it will be in one of the many shopping malls located within a stone throw of this mall. This shop has shops on levels B-2 all the way up to level 3 or 4, B-2 is more for the medium line fashions, and then as you go up, it gets more expensive, Prada, Armani etc etc. Worth the visit."
,,Window shopping at ion,5.0,,Ion is truly a shoppers paradise . U Hv the uber trendy stuff at the basement and the super brands on the higher floors . Especially like the small trendy stuff shops in the basements like the huge muji shop and the headphone shop ... Search for whatever u need u will find it sumwhere in ion
,,The High Classy Mall,3.0,,Classy and a great place to shop and stroll around. The ambience is also great and better considering its the greatest mall in Singapore. Recommended for those who like shopping spree
,,Best place to shop in Singapore,4.0,,Went there during the Great Singapore Sale (which is on-going) - oh boy there are a lot of good items for sale. Great deals too! Downside - there are a lot of people. You might queue a while in the fitting rooms. Best time to go is during the great singapore sale!
,,Need more than a day!,4.0,,"A day is not enough for shopping here!

Shop, rest, shop, eat, shop, rest, eat, shop and come back the next day!

Lots of shops and eateries.

The concept of the mall is that the higher the floor, the more high end, which is the more expensive.

So, shop from ground up or otherwise, is your choice.

ION MTR is in the mall itself."
,,The mall to end all malls?,4.0,,"With it's iconic architectural features and space age exterior this mall is as much a tourist ""must-see"" as a retail therapy destination .... It surely has everything and something to appeal to all age groups and wallets! My fave floor is B4 with Daiso (""Everything $2"") and Jason's .... As you progress to the higher floors you pass through teen shops then aspirational designer wear for window-shopping. This is a good place to start your Orchard Rd shopping extravaganza as ION lies directly above the Orchard MRT then branches out subterraneally (is that even a word? I mean ""underground"") along to Wisma Atria and Takashimaya or across to Wheelock Place, Tangs and Shaw House. Good news if it is blisteringly hot or torrential rain.... And in Singapore it is likely to be one or the other. Enjoy!"
,,In your spare time,3.0,,So many stores its a bit overwhelming as you can get lost easily. After a while the stores feel a bit repeated. The bright lights and colours as well as the architecture make it interesting.
,,My Fave Shopping Haven in Orchard Rd.,5.0,,"Malls are aplenty in Singapore but Ion is my favorite because it has everything I like in one place! This includes Kate Spade SATURDAY, Longchamp, Kikki, Jason's Grocery Food and Wine, Muji, H&M, Forever 21 and it just goes on and on and on. Shopping can be quite daunting in SG and it gets tiring to hop from one mall to another. Almost everything is in Ion, it's the most carefully curated shopping center and basically that's why I love it!"
,,Unique shopping experience,4.0,,Brilliant architecture and there's a scent throughout the building ! Concierge services throughout to guide shoppers - right up to hailing a taxi for you. Very upmarket --its like shopping in a hotel ! Indulge and enjoy!
,,Very good looking but . .,4.0,,"Its a beautiful mall I must say, but it only contains high-end brands and therefore if you are after normal people shopping, its just a waste of time since you won't buy anything !"
,,My fav shopping centre,5.0,,This place is fabulous! The basements comprises mass market shops and gets more upmarket from level one upwards. Very interesting. Make sure you visit Daiso at the basement where the foodcourt is. This shop has everything selling for just S$2! Amazing!!
,,Another up-market mall in Singapore,4.0,,"This is just yet another up-market mall in Singapore housing renowned international brands. Very clean and very convenient as it's within walking distance from orchard mrt station. Underpass connect ion to wisma and wheelock.

There are many eateries located within the mall as well for all kinds of budgets.

Great local food located at the food court at the basement."
,,The Best!!!!!,5.0,,"Free Internet at ION Orchard, and connection is pretty good too.
Free Internet – Starbucks at B3
MRT - Orchard MRT Station
Timings - Open Daily: 10am - 10pm.
Store Directory: http://www.ionorchard.com/en/ion-store-guide
Nice modern shopping centre with a range of high end designer shops on the higher levels and reasonable priced local boutiques on ground and basement levels."
,,Not just for shopping or food,4.0,,"We had a little time before going to the airport, so we took the MRT from our hotel at Bugis straight to Orchard station at the base of ION Orchard. Found our way to the counter on the 4th floor where one gets tickets to the ION Sky observation deck on the 55th floor of the tower. SGD16 for adults and SGD8 for kids, with definite time-slots. We didn't go up but visited the adjacent art gallery which had an exhibition of lovely contemporary Chinese paintings. Walked around and took some photos."
,,Top 3 shopping mall,4.0,,"Ion from the outside and design beats them all, all top brand are present (except Hermes) 4 basement levels and 5 floors make it one of the biggest. With Mariana Bay and Ny Ann City mall in the top 3, I let you deside who is the winner as you got to visit them all as a true shoppeholic!"
,,Huge!,4.0,,Mindblowing big Many store and also quite a big number of good restautants Not for shopping just staring cause the prices are astronomical high 😄 But cool to see
,,Accident with curved glass partition,1.0,,"Today at 5:42 PM

We shopped there on on our way to Australia and my wife collided with one of their curved glass partitions. There were no safety markings and ION Orchard said they could not locate this on CCTV.

My wife sustained shock and injury to her face and damage to her spectacles. I had to guide her across roads as her spectacles were useless.

ION Orchard would not entertain even a request to contribute towards a new pair of spectacles. It would appear they do not care for shoppers safety"
,,High end mall,4.0,,"If you do not like buying, gawking or window shopping at hi-end signature stuff skip it. Just go to Paragon or Takashimaya. If you do this is the place to go. It has most of the name brands and fine watch stores. It has one of the few Car Shoe stores in Asia. Its a 10 minute walk from Orchard so if you are in the are its worth the visit. In any case it sits on top of or just near the Orchard MTR station, so waste the hop and see whats inside."
,,Good place to shop,4.0,,This is a good place for shop lovers. Convenient location and almost all brands are available. Has a huge food court at the basement level. You must enjoy this place.
,,Take Dining to the Skies,4.0,,"ION Orchard brings together the world’s best-loved brands in flagship, concept and lifestyle stores. Spread over eight levels of shopping space, you can indulge in over 330 retail, F&B and lifestyle stores. In addition to a coveted stable of brands, an extensive food hall offers visitors myriad food choices ranging from local favourites to international cuisines. Attraction at ION Orchard is Salt grill & Sky bar, the elegant 6,000 square feet contemporary restaurant located at an impressive height of 218 metres above ground level, ION Sky is the new focal point of the city. Offering Australian cuisine with a touch of Asian flare, Salt Grill on the 55th floor is the casual version of award-winning Salt Grill in Sydney. Besides mouthwatering cuisine, one can enjoy an unrivalled 360-degree view from the observatory, the highest point on Orchard Road. For an extra touch of romance and glamour, head to the Sky Bar on the 56th floor for pre- or post-dinner drinks."
,,Best mall in Singapore? I hope Singapore has better mall than this,3.0,,"I'm from Hong Kong and I live in Shanghai. I seen so many malls in my life.

I read other reviews, to SE asians, probably it's the best ever in SE asia. However, it's like iAPM in Huaihai road in Shanghai only. High end shops like LV, Gucci, Prada etc are from ground floor to above, and medium end shops all at basement.

But, AX, Camper, Converse, Clarks, Ecco, they are like other malls in Singapore. There is no young brands like stayreal, stussy, bape, Y3 etc. Nothing much ignite my shopping appetitie and I only stayed for half an hour and move on to the others.

I give it a 3 stars, unless you want to explore if SIngapore is selling LV much cheaper than Hong Kong or Paris. By the way, I love LV's poster of Fan bingbing outside LV store of the Ion Orchard mall (mainland chinese know who I'm talking about)."
,,Excellent Shopping,5.0,,Shop till you drop ladies leave the hubby at home. All you ever wanted in a shopping centre great bargains to be had just give it a try Im sure you wont be disappointed.
,,Forget your budget,5.0,,"Orchard Road is full of malls, but this is one of the best. Clean, modern and full of brand shops and boutiques. Good selection of restaurants too"
,,"Great shopping, bring lots of money!",4.0,,"We started off in Ion, expecting to go to a few shops and then head down orchard rd, however they had every shop imaginable and so we spent the whole day here! The basement levels are at a normal budget, with the higher levels featuring the high end brands. The food court left a lot to be desired, however the cafe on level 4 was amazing. Would highly recommend a visit if you like shopping!"
,,Food Opera,3.0,,"Food served here, is coated with a rather slim layer of gold!
The malay food stall dishes looked rather tempting, there was a long line and hey it has to be good right? Well for starters, I should have checked the prices before I even began to point to the array of dishes.
So I chose a scoop of veg stir fry, a tablespoonful of anchovies and peanuts (a condiment in my view) and chicken curry with a small piece of chicken. That was $9.50
My husband picked a bagedil (potato patty), chicken wing with a tiny drizzle of sambal and a stir fried veg. His very expensive selection was deemed $15.80!
Well I tried so hard to justify this costing, but in the end the only reasonable answer I could come up with is that they must be using some form of gold layering in their food.
Expensive rent is not an excuse to be selling a maximum of $4 meal at such outrageous prices!
Well maybe that's the reason why I only saw a few locals eating there. Well def an area for tourists! Mall's great and you could spend hours browsing through! Just stay away from Food Opera if you are looking for valuable meal."
,,As good as it gets,5.0,,"Fantastic centre for the mega wealthy and for those who want to be of just want to watch.
Seriously one of the best malls I've been to a great mix of fashion.
It's difficult to navigate around as it's multi level below ground and runs through a couple of buildings."
,,Charlie & co has gluten free burgers in ION orchard,3.0,,Just in response to ion orchard we found gluten free burgers at Charlie & co. They couldn't do cheese in the burger but dud have gluten free buns to make a burger
,,One of the better malls,4.0,,"We recently stayed in SG and spent some time in the Orchard Rd area. ION Orchard was one of the better super malls with plenty of shops, both boutique and name brand. The Food Opera food court (an up market westernised hawker centre) was also a good place for quick lunch spot, although not comparable to some of the famous Hawker Centres around SG. Worth a look if you are browsing around Orchard Rd."
,,Luxury mall,4.0,,"Been here twice during our holiday trip to Singapore last December. first day, nothing attracted us, not so much bargain. items sold are about the same we had here in KL. 2nd day, we visited more shops. grabbed office attire outfit and also trying some clothes from luxury brand which sold some of their items in a very reasonable price. the location is accessible via public transports especially the MRT which connected with the building. very convenience. the main reason why i love visiting singapore is all city are well connected via anything. superb."
,,"Huge, Beautiful Shops, Confusing",5.0,,"Ion is a beautiful shopping center along the famous Orchard Road in Singapore. It is chock full of the best shops (you name them, they have them) and is interconnected with other impressive shopping centers along the road. In addition to the shops, there are good eating places, adequate facilities, and clinics.
The only thing wrong is that Ion has to be one of the most complicated places to navigate that I have seen. Signs, especially in the below-ground levels, are missing or confusing and one can literally go around in circles. It really seems quite unlike Singapore in this respect! If the direction sign situation can be sorted out, this will be the standard for Singapore!
But it is not cheap!"
,,This place is huge!,4.0,,"What a massive shopping centre! If you want to look at the whole place then you need to allocate at least 3 hours. We were really impressed with the variety of stores ranging from designer to cheaper brands, from skin care, to shoes, bags, toys, clothing..... The food court has an amazing variety of options and is very reasonably priced- we paid $20 for 3 meals and 3 drinks. Great shopping destination."
,,Wide Range of Shops and Eateries. But Complicated Layout,5.0,,"A wide range of shops here. It has a well mix of high end luxury brands to mid-range brands. Its a good place to shop for gifts. It has a very good mix of food outlets as well. But, the choice of cafes and restaurants."
,,A one stop shoping paradise inSingapore,5.0,,"This is a very grand and vibrant shopping mall. The underground train stops directly beneath this mall nad escalators take you right into the mall. There is an extraordinary food bazaar in the basement where a whole host of local and international cuisine is cooked right before you and served in minutes for less than ten dollars a main course dish. You can choose from various food counters and eat to your heart's content. There are all types of boutiques and larger departmental stores throughout the various levels of this mall and you could spend an entire day in this place. It is at the heart of Orchard Road - a premier street in Singapore. A very clean and safe place - though at certain times in the day, you get hordes of people thronging in both directions."
,,Extravagance Lavish-city,5.0,,"it is a high end shopping mall, where you can find all brands in one roof, go there and remember to take a big stake of cash!!"
,,Everything is there,3.0,,So big shopping place we wouldn't find way out to orchard rd somehow we just looked around at all shopping on different levels finally got out of Ion. U can find all brands inside the Ion. For the shopping spree people
,,Massive shopping center on corner of Orchard Road & Scotts Road- incorporates Orchard MRT station & underground ped xing,4.0,,"This is a massive shopping center- it's worth visiting just to experience the sheer size, including several underground levels.

Also, ION is the location for the Orchard MRT station.

Visitors unfamiliar with Singapore should bear in mind that pedestrian traffic at the Orchard Road - Scott's Road intersection is via tunnels below the road, and you need to work out where you want to go. For first timers, it can be a bit obscure!"
,,Great shopping mall,4.0,,"This shopping mall houses lots of international luxury brands like prada, LV, miu miu, etc. not forgetting the watch brands like omega, panerai, etc.

The food court within the mall itself serves lotsa tasty food. Some of the more upmarket restaurants can be found here as well at the higher levels.

The mall is located just beside the orchard mrt."
,,by this stage the shopping centres are starting to look the same...,4.0,,"The shopping centres on orchard road are hard to distinguish from one another as they have most of the stores that you are looking for anyway.

Out of curiousity's sake you might as well go to this one as well. We did buy a few thing here but not as much as other centres as all the stores ended up being the same.

It is conveniently located near to the MRT station."
,,"Huge mall, Good Food",4.0,,"Take MRT to Orchard station and you'll arrive. Just follow the sign ION. The range of shops are plenteous so it's good for shoppers with varying budgets or window shopping. The building architecture was beautiful and luxurious and for some reason, exceptionally long escalators that stretches two storey long are getting trendy amongst shopping malls along Orchard road as I see one here along with Wisma Atria. My family and I had lunch at the basement food court, the least you can get per meal here is $5 but the food and atmosphere here was just a wonderful experience."
,,All the shopping and more,4.0,,Amazing (or crazy) amount of shops in the area. Coming from Perth for a trip back home to the UK its refreshing and shows even one of these shopping centres is what Perth needs!!!
,,No good buys here,3.0,,"Good to say we've been here but left empty handed. Nothing at a good price here that you couldn't get at home cheaper.
Singapore is actually very expensive compared to Australia. Best bet is to shop in smaller malls like vivo city, bugis st, Chinatown etc. I did find the Charles & Keith brand to be quite affordable and stylish they had heaps of nice bags, shoes , sunglasses and wallets most under S$50 great buy. I purchased a lot of my stuff here and then I ran into one of their shops at the airport bought even more stuff while waiting for my flight home."
,,I'm here for Food Opera : D,4.0,,The food in Food Opera was really good I ordered from Sergeant Hainanese Chicken Rice twice. Another shop selling chicken skewers was really yummy too. The place is quite packed during lunch hours around 12-1pm so try to come here earlier.
,,best in Orchard,4.0,,"ION Orchard is one of the best malls there
they have TWG Tea salon and many shops and some cafes
i always got lost in the underpass from the mall to other directions
it is connected with Orchard metro
the prices is little high
walking through is a fun"
,,Huge Mall,5.0,,"Huge mall .. if i lived in singapore i would take couple of days just to browse this mall.. Lots of shops and shopping to do, with a limited time we had to finish shopping in just a couple of hours.."
,,One of the best malls in Singapore,5.0,,A great mall. Something for everyone. Some high end but still a lot of you normal shops. You could spend most of the day here if you like shopping. Catch the SMRT on the North Line to Orchard NS22. There are many other malls along Orchard Rd too!
,,Nice mall...,3.0,,Good restaurants design... And great to shop .... But Sunday is too crowded esp on the streets. Good choices of shops. And great to have a coffee during afternoon.
,,"Giant mall, not for the faint hearted",3.0,,"We've visited this mall twice, and on our second visit we actually found a lot more affordable shops. This mall houses some very pricey brands and as a young person I didn't really find many affordable shops. On our second visit we found a lot more shops that were quite affordable. It might be easier if we were looking for something specific, and just for general browsing we found the mall quite difficult to maneuver. But for someone who can handle malls quite well, this is a great place and there are lots and lots of shops. There is also quite a large food court, where there are several options. A good thing about this mall is that it is directly connected to the MRT station, and thus very convenient! Would go there again, but will be a lot more prepared!"
,,"Been there, done that....yeah, right.......",4.0,,"If I remember correctly, Ion is a place, actually a very big place that in order to cross to the other side of Orchard Road, you need to go inside a building from one side of the street, find your way down, walk parallel to Orchard Road, find your way up and you go out from the other building on the other side of the street. Basically, you’ve avoided to cross the traffic on the surface street. We found this out when we got out of the subway prematurely and had to walk to our hotel on Orchard Road. Shopping wise, if you’re thinking “been there, done that”.....think again. Not when you’ve only seen the shopping possibilities on the surface street, make your way down and you’re in for a surprise.....If your shopping money has been burning a hole in your wallet, this is a good place to spend it. This place has an infinite number of merchandise shops, service shops, food shops, drinks shops and all kinds of shops that are willing and glad to take your money. We made our contributions to the food shops down in the basement. This is consumer’s paradise or hell if you don’t have your burning wallet."
,,Big Shopping Mall - With big brands name,4.0,,"To get there to ION Orchard mall is simple, take the MRT (red line) and stop to Orchard station, then the metro stop is just on the basement of the Mall.

The mall is totalling 66,000 square metres of retail space, with over eight levels of shopping space. Over 300 retail, food & beverages and entertainment stores, with many luxury brands.

It is opened daily from 10am to 10pm.

I found the prices very expensive compared to other places in the town or shops around the world, but the place is niced even you don't buy anything"
,,Food court!!!!,5.0,,"Loved this place. Great food court area and huge love the snacks cream puff, milk teas,grilled meats.

And not sure if true but after walking the area though that all Singaporeans shop all the time haahaa

can't say much about the stores cause wasn't there to shop but tons of them, lots of high end stores with some seemingly mom-pop ones"
,,very good shopping destination,5.0,,ION orchards is huge. It has 8 floors and 330 shops. It's got all the big luxury brands as well as a lot of popular clothing brands you just don't see in the rest of asia. The mall is also not very busy which makes the shopping experience very pleasant. Just this shopping mall alone makes me want to move to singapore.
,,Nice place to shop,4.0,,"nice place to shop there for shopaholics, the mall itself is connected to the Orchard MRT Station. ION Orchard is a good place for shopping. many stores are giving discount at the sale season (june-july)"
,,Shopping??,4.0,,"I actually got to shop without children telling me they were bored. Why? Firstly because we refueled with Dunkin Donuts in the basement food court to start and then visited the superhero shop followed closey by buying our little one "" shoes with lights"" that kept his little legs walking.
Easy to reach on the MRT as station underneath mall, great eating options in the Opera food precinct ( basement) and fabulous clean toilets throughout including mini sized toilets, hand basins etc for little people.
A lovely destination with lots of shopping choice including Zara and H&M."
,,It's a shopping mall,3.0,,"Get over it guys. There are shops and food outlets and toilets and ........everything that's at the Trafford Centre back in Manchester. But hotter. Just not our sort of place. Do it one, get out, get onto something more interesting."
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"Good but at times pricey shopping. Very close to MRT Orchard station. Cold air con with good toilet options. Food and coffee options also very good. Good people watching as well. Overall, Singapore in general is a great place but it gets pipped at the post by Hong Kong. Still highly recommended though."
,,A place that entices all your senses,5.0,,"ION Orchard is the must go for all. A great variety and blend of shops and eateries. Everything you need and want is under this one roof. Extremely accessible and recommend to travel via the MRT, as parking is mostly full all the time."
,,Great Variety of Shopping,4.0,,"The ION is easy to reach using either the MRT or taxi. For Australians taxis are cheap especially out of rush hour times.
The shopping centre has a wide variety of shops for all tastes but be prepared to spend big. There's a great dumpling restaurant on the top level, worth while standing in the wait queue. it is always busy.
The centre is connected to the other centres around so it's a good starting point on Orchard."
,,Carpark Driving Way Out Experience,1.0,,"Not sure if already happened to viewers. But here is the story. My wife drove a car and parked in ION Orchard carpark level 6. For reason, I need to go to Lucky Plaza and come back to drove out the car. On my way out driving, I follow the 'Way Out' sign and ended up entering the incoming lane. Somehow I realized the car behind me was in right lane. So shocked after I realized that I was wrong in the wrong lane and luckily saw a way to turn back into outgoing lane. Again saw a car coming up from the incoming lane and barely only few seconds after my turning to outgoing lane. I just escaped from face-to-face car accident with other incoming cars. Totally unexpected situation with the carpark driving in ION which could take very serious accident. I still cannot imagine if that happened to me and my family in the car which was a really terrible experience. If you ever drive to Suntec, Vivocity and other carparks, you will experience driving always in the left side for incoming or outgoing lane. How come ION is totally different and never consider that we are right-hand driver. Hope management will put more effort for carpark driving safety and precaution if they just want to be different."
,,"on the ""must go to"" list in singapore",5.0,,"caught the MRT to directly underneath this huge shopping complex. So may shops, and yes they are middle to high end shops, but feel there is a lot of variety to suit most people. If you want super cheap, don't go there. So many shops like Mango, Zara that we don't have in Perth, Western Australia so I enjoyed this shopping complex. Ate at a Chinese Tea house there which was truly really really nice food. So clean too and heaps of floors so you may need a day there to see all the shops. Is on the upper end of Orchard Road and is so worth the visit."
,,"Affordable, quality shopping in beautiful surrounds",4.0,,"I was new to the Ion centre on Orchard Rd, so approached it with some excitement as a travelling shopaholic.

My sister-in-law and I almost gave it away on entering via the arcade featuring the top level designers (Prada etc) but fortunately, while searching for the pedestrian underpass to take us across the road to our favourite money-changer (underneath the PNB sign next to Giodano in Lucky Plaza) we stumbled upon the Bebe boutique, where we both found some great smart casual gear for around the $100-$150 Aust mark. Remember that the GST is refundable upon departure if you have over $100Sing in receipts from a store!

From then we were away, exploring every level which can be confusing. Marks and Spencer is down the Wheelock Place end and is a safe option for those requiring medium-large western sizes. We discovered 2 wonderful bread/patisseries in this section, around level B2 which made for scrumptious tasty snacks while on the go (eg super tasty panino half with sausage/pizza topping @$3.50Sing.

Prepare to spend half a day exploring this centre, at least. And expect to return... We did!"
,,A Shopaholic's haven!,5.0,,"Orchard is marked as the shopping center of Singapore ..full of branded stores like Prada, Dior and Channel..with modern interiors and eye-catching designs inside...you can see locals and alot of tourists shopping or just taking pictures.the ION mall has an underpass that connects to the MRT...foodcourt is located at the basement."
,,Classy,4.0,,"The range of shops are plenteous so it's good for shoppers with varying budgets or window shopping. The building architecture was beautiful and luxurious and for some reason, exceptionally long escalators that stretches two storey long are getting trendy amongst shopping malls along Orchard road as I see one here along with Wisma Atria. My family and I had lunch at the basement food court, the least you can get per meal here is $5 but the food and atmosphere here was just a wonderful experience. ION Orchard adverts often advertise on my countries local television network a few years back was the reason why I visited this mall."
,,Place to satisfy your shopping craving,4.0,,"Orchard is named the shopping centre of Singapore. Here you can find mostly everything from clothes to home appliances to cosmetics. ION is a newly built shopping mall which is, of course, more modern, full of branded store and flooded with local people as well as tourists. Branded goods in Singapore, in my opinion, are cheaper compared to neighbouring countries (although they are way more expensive than those in Europe with the same quality) so tourists from the nearby countries like to come to Singapore to get these branded stuff. ION is a 8-storey building, 4 of which lie underground. It is also linked by the underpass to other shopping centres so your shopping experience will go on and never end. Stores are nicely decorated as well just to add on."
,,Beautiful shops,5.0,,We had a lovely time here wandering and shopping. Get a map otherwise you will get lost as we did but we soon found our way out. This is all underground which is a bit disconcerting as I expected it to be high rise with fabulous view. Large food hall in basement which is great but competition for tables is fierce. Great variety of food and a drinks trolley circulated as well as dim sum.
,,If you love expensive stuff,3.0,,"Like a lot of big malls around Singapore, this one sells mostly expensive brand stuffs. I guess that might be good for some, I just don't get the point in paying so much for stuff I can get a 10% the price elsewhere (no, I am not a particular fan of Louis Vuitton and the like of it). So, if you're looking for a new deal on t-shirts or a new pair of shoes at less than 40$ this might not be the place to head for. Otherwise, if you are looking for a 8000$ watch of a 3899$ box of drawing pens (in leather, of course) you will be served!"
,,Incident with Regards to the accident at ION Orchard’s Roller Shutter,5.0,,"I personally love to shop and hang around in Ion Orchard. I have got to walk through Ion to my office everyday and to be honest, I really enjoyed the walk until the incident happened to me on Apr 2013, between 0830hrs to 0845hrs.

The roller shutter in between Wheelock Place and ION Orchard that dropped abruptly and knocked my head (Near Bread Society). No one approached me to offer a helping hand, I personally felt disappointed with the management security and safety issues.

I hope to bring to the management's attention of the safety measures that needs to be investigated and take responsibility to discuss further and negotiate with regards to my medical expenses and compensation in relation to this incident. I have been written to the management and yet no response."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"Great brand shopping, both expensive and inexpensive plus great food court food in the basement. My daughter and I went back three times during our stay in Singapore, and each time we had to get fresh lime and mango juices in the food court. Saw a makeup lesson in Sephora, visited the high end boutiques and had a free photo session at Chanel, as well as picking up some bargains in the cheaper stores - a great time."
,,Huge and Fantastic,4.0,,Everytime I travel to Singapore I always go to ION. It is the one stop shopping centre in Singapore. The MRT is there so its easy to get to and it has almost one of evry shop that you could imagine plus more. On the down side it is a bit of a maze so its easy to get lost but thats when you find some fantastic store that is hiding.
,,High Escalator,5.0,,"ION Orchard has an escalator that is 2 floors long. Unfortunately, it's 2nd highest in Southeast Asia to me. Ciputra World Surabaya, Indonesia has an escalator that is 3 floors long. If I was thinking, It's the 1st highest in Southeast Asia. But still, ION Orchard still the best in Singapore!"
,,ION Mall,3.0,,"Found it empty/very impersonal. I went in to DAISO - stationery items were cheap, good range and more than adequate for my needs.This shop a contrast as its a 2$ shop as against all high name brands! The proximity of the MRT (just take the escalator down!) was a huge plus point as it connected me right back to Changi Airport. Food court was adequate."
,,Cool place,4.0,,This mall is a cool place to walk around. They have a variety of brands so I will just visit the brands that I like. The mall smells nice too :) The loos are clean and well maintained. It has different nice places to eat too.
,,too big,3.0,,"We got lost in this shopping centre, too big, the same shops as in the other 50 plus shopping malls, wouldn't go back, and I'm a shopaholic!"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"It is spacious and certainly gives the feel of a luxury centre. While brand shops are strewn around the area, there are also nice ones in the basement, making it feel like a bustling shopping area. Compared to the basement, the brand floors are practically empty. But if you check them out, there is a nice bookstore in the top floor."
,,Best shopping in Singapore!,5.0,,"Ion is a pretty impressive shopping centre. The architecture itself is pretty special, and the shopping is great. It was good to see more affordable shopping for labels such as H&M and Victoria Secrets which appeals to most shoppers rather than the saturation of designer labels throughout Orchard Road and other shopping centres. I only had a couple of hours to spare and spent most of that in the one store so definitely give yourself a few hours if you enjoy shopping!! For those that like to catch trains, there is a station within the Ion building. If you are catching a taxi, it can be difficult to catch taxis around 4 - 6pm."
,,Shopping heaven <3,5.0,,"Open till late. All the designer brands. Very clean - spotless :)

All the global brands worth noting are in this mall. It's strategically located and convenient to get to - just get off at Orchard MRT station and you're there.

Spending a half-day in this mall is a good idea!"
,,Perfect for a few hours transit in Singapore,4.0,,"I always have 8-11 hours transit in Singapore, and so far I always spent my day in Vivo City, except this last trip. I chose ION Orchard as it is closer to Changi airport, and it is very easy to go there by SMRT as well. The mall has Daiso, where you can easily spent 2 hours inside, buying all small unique things. Also the food court on the basement offers a lot of choices. There is also Sephora where you can buy cosmetics and perfumes. There is also TWG Tea Boutique, for tea addicts like me. Spending a half-day in this mall without getting bored is a good idea rather than freezing inside the airport during your transit in Singapore."
,,Always visit when in Singapore,5.0,,"We always visit ION when in Singapore as it's easily accessible right on top of MRT Orchadr, red line. We often dined at the B4 foodhall and had some great dishes like curry,fried carrot cake, popiah, lovely juices like the dragonfruit one. I always enjoy buying a takeway drink at Each a Cup.
Some shops are really expensive but on B2 and B3 you find the usual shops in a nice setting. I also like the water features in front and beautiful Christmas decorations during Christmas time :)"
,,Spell premium with I-O-N,5.0,,"All the global brands worth noting are in this mall. It's strategically located and convenient to get to - just get off at Orchard MRT station and you're there. If you're a tourist and bent on spending a lot of time shopping, do drop by their concierge since they often have incentives and details on GST refunds.The shops on #B2 and the Beauty Hall on #B3 in particular offer a veritable who's who of the skincare and beauty industry."
,,Great Shops,4.0,,"One of the newer centres with some terrific food stalls . Scored a magnificent Gelati downstairs in the food court, and eyed off some great local offerings also - its location off the Orchard MRT is a big plus!!"
,,One of the biggest malls of Singapore,5.0,,"It is one of the huge malls of Singapore, located at the most famous Orchard Road. This place is full of tourists and locals..name any brand and you will find it here.. Prada, chanel, topshop etc all the shops are just on a walking distance..the MRT of orchard road connects within ION Orchard mall.."
,,One of the best,4.0,,"I think this is one of the best mall in singapore, and the location is also perfect. Consist very much branded shop and also lots of great store. Fancy and complete food courts. Must go mall"
,,Just another upscale shopping mall!,4.0,,It is just like any other upscale shopping mall. but really clean though and more over it is located just above the Orchard MRT station so you can easily get here. Lots of places to eat at the foodcourt. Very hard to get a taxi from here...
,,Varied Food Court but no Coeliac options,3.0,,"We met up with friends in the mall for a wander around the shops followed by lunch. The mall is like any other mall the world over although it is one of the cleanest i have been too.

The food court has a wide range of dining choices from across the region but we really struggled trying to find gluten free information or food. Recognition of this intolerance/illness hasn't reached Singapore as it has in the UK and Northern Europe, however, we did manage to convince a restaurant owner to sell us a bowl of plain rice but he was puzzled by such a request. :-)"
,,Modern shopping complex,5.0,,"The shopping complex is built around the MRT. An assortment of boutique shops, for men or women, are available if you have enough time and energy to shop around."
,,A mall to visit ... Beautiful !!!!,5.0,,"An extraordinary shopping center and a sort of attraction to visit, In addition, you can buy everything and anything! The food court is great, with dozens of local restaurants but very noisy, like all food courts. Do not miss this tour, it's amazing!"
,,beautiful mall,5.0,,"very beautiful mall, a perfect combination of luxury, high end and some local brands .... eatery joints are also very good there, loved the food court on B4 very very creative and beautiful eating joints , caters to all taste buds :)"
,,Visit Ion and not Lucky Plaza,5.0,,"Been here a few times in last 6months. And walking back from shaw centre movies last week at night I realised how awesome this mall looks. Huge huge digital screen which is curved and below that you will see Armani, dolce gabana, Louis Vutton and more. This tells you the class of this mall. BUT BE WARNED. CONNECT THROUGH AN UNDERPASS IN SOMEWAY IS LUCKY PLAZA. THERE ARE MANY ELECTRONIC GOODS SCAMS. Review trip advisor before shopping for electronics at Lucky plaza. I like the mall for its food places and other small shops. But I fear the bullying thugs of the electronic shops. On the other hand. Ion is such a pleasure. The food hall offers me veg steamed dimsum. Hard to find this other than Bao Tao outside back of 313Somerset. If you want non high priced designer clothes go inside ion and downstairs. Enjoy and be warmed about lucky plaza. Check out their trip advisor reviews and you will understand."
,,ION has everything,5.0,,"All the brands in the world under one roof at ION Orchard. It's one of the newest mall on Orchard Rd. What sets this mall apart from all the other malls on Orchard Rd (Paragon, Wisma Atria, Ngee Ann City & Mandarin Gallery) it has just about everything for everyone. The basement has a food court with great food. The affordable brands are below ground level. The ground level and the floors above ground are high end brands. They is a great bookstore on the top level if you loved books."
,,A mixture of everything,3.0,,"The higher the floor the more expensive and branded stuff are sold. Toilet at the highest floor was the cleanest. If you are looking for affordable brands like G2000, Levis its at lower floors nearer to basement where the food court is located."
,,Best selection of mid-range brands on Orchard,4.0,,"From what I have seen, ION seems to offer the broadest selection of mid-range brands on Orchard. The place to shop if Dior, Channel and LV are above your price point."
,,Under one roof,4.0,,From designers' shops to highstreet you name it. It links Orchard Road and Patterson Road. Worth of visit.
,,Excellent shopping centre and great food options,5.0,,"A great new shopping complex on Orchard Rd (nearest MRT is Orchard), ION is a wonderful shopping experience with everything from high end designer brands through to everyday brands available under the one roof.

The food court in the basement is incredibly good. An array of cuisine options - my personal favourite if the char siew pork with wanton, kopi-c and fruit salad bar. Very fresh and very tasty.

Have also visited some of the cafes and restaurants on the upper floors such as Paradise Dynasty, which are also great places to eat and catch up with friends."
,,Complete experience under the air-con!,5.0,,"You find mostly everything under one roof: high shopping, standard more affordable shopping, high restaurants, standard restaurants, coffee shops, apple shop, food court, link to the subway (called MRT at Singapore), you game it and most probably can find it at Ion.
One tremendous feature is that you can also access the neighboring shopping complexes at Orchard road (Takashiyama department store and Isetan store) through the Ion underground air con alleys. Furthermore you can even cross Orchard road underground and connect direct with Tang department store,... And if this is not enough, if you drive at Singapore, parking fee at Ion is the cheapest around this central area of Singapore and since the place may be quite full sometimes, they also have valet parking service at Level 5 for free!
No excuse not to park at Ion and go explore Orchard,... Happy Ion experience!"
,,Yummy food at the Food Court,4.0,,"Ion orchard is the first mall you'll meet when you alight at Orchard MRT station, as the station is connected to Ion Mall & Wisma Atria. We love tge Food Court of Ion. It' s probably the most clean & nice food court you can find in orchard area. It is cheap enough but treat you with a Restaurant-like food.
Once you get into ground level of Ion, go downstairs to find the food court. NASI PADANG booth is our favorite!! it's not similar to nasi padang that we find in Indonesia, it is more light and less gravy. Otherwise, this Nasi Padang have many fresh vegetables mix to choose. Seafood is also provided. Yummy!"
,,"Singapore extreme shopping, great food court",4.0,,"Singapore shopping mall at it's finest, with everything you could want, especially high end.
Since I love all the local food flavors, I found the food court downstairs to be perfect to sample Indonesian, Malay, Thai, Chinese and Singaporean food at a tremendous bargain. Everyone in the group can choose their own preference."
,,Clean Contemporary Shopping,4.0,,"Full of international designer shops. Beautiful shopping mall. Very well located. Unfortunately if you live in UK or Europe you will probably find that all the prices are inflated. Nice place to walk around - not ideal place if you want to shop for bargains or gifts for home.
Great atmosphere. Very safe. Well located for the metro and other shops."
,,Perfect Place for Lunch!,5.0,,"When in Singapore, it's all about hawker centers. And if you can't get to one, a good food court can make a decent substitute. We wandered around the different stalls in B4 of Ion, gaping with delight at all of the choices. We settled on a Hainanese chicken stand, and it was perfect. Baked chicken, chicken broth, and a salt-baked potato. Once you find a seat, the little aunties come around with drink carts to quench any thirst. Great food at good prices...what are you waiting for?"
,,An extensive mall in the heart of Orchard Road,5.0,,"This is one very huge mall located on Orchard Road. You can practically find almost anything you need under one roof. From high end expensive world renowned brands to some very good bargain goods, you can get it all in Ion.

Their F & B outlets are also extensive where you can find almost all the world's cuisine here.

Its spacious, clean and very well decorated mall.

My favorite mall in Singapore at this moment."
,,Shooping and eating in ION Orchard Singapore,4.0,,"ION Orchard is one of the shopping and eating area for visitors. The basement food sheet have many different kind of food! Beef noodle and Fish ball noodle are my favour food. The quality should consider the top 5 in Singapore. Of couse, there are many other stalls and resturants in ION orchard. Shopping area include Daiso (Cheap and price at S$2), clothing , sport and etc. It is also very convienence near to Orchard MRT (Train station). Near By ION orchard also have many other shopping centre."
,,A-Shopping,4.0,,"The mall is huge & boasts of high-end luxury brands - name it they carry it..Since a friend of mine works for one of the stores in it - G Star Raw, we managed to get it & explore the mall's entirety as well. The mall carries mostly designer brands so expect the range of prices that goes along with it- the gadgets & other electronic items are on the basement of this mall."
,,expensive high end shopping area,4.0,,"This place is heaven for the rich as all this shopping center carries are the high end branded goods. nothing is cheap, eating is expensive as well. be warned if u would wish to plan shopping trips here and on tight budget. definitely not a place to go with financial fundings are limited."
,,Extensive Mall Heart Orchard Road,4.0,,"Easy access direct from Orchard MRT.
One of several large malls in close proximity to each other.
Many brand name shops across many levels and eateries in basement below MRT.
When heading up Orchard Rd head for Paterson Rd underpass there is no pedestrian crossing on Orchid in front ION."
,,A really neat exterior to this complex with upscale stores inside,4.0,,"As I somewhat frequent Singapore every now and then, Orchard Road area is yet another place I usually frequent when visiting.
This area is infamously known for having some of the most shopping centers in such a short proximity of each other. Ion Orchard is no exception. It's right across the street from Wheelock Place, and is more of an upscale kind of shopping center. It's here that many of the high end brand names are found here like Gio Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, Diane Von Furstenberg, and many others.
However, there are still a number of cool stores that I always like to check out when visiting."
,,Crowded and confusing,3.0,,"Ion is very crowded during my visit, the lay out is very confusing with many alleys. though there are many stores from middle to upper brands, the most crowded ones is in the basements floor where the high street brand such as uniqlo, cotton on, zara, etc are located. just a typical shopping malls in asia."
,,"Easy to get to, really posh mall on Orchard",4.0,,"Easy to get to as this is the mall you get out at when you leave the Orchard MRT station. It's a high end mall reminiscent of KLCC mall (with a free art gallery you can go in to). Most of the mid-range shops and eateries are below street level where the MRT station is at, which is where it gets crowded. Not so much once you get to street level as it's where the luxury designer stores are at."
,,Rude and arrogant salespeople,2.0,,"Interesting design & layout, somewhat confusing though. Great variety of shops & eateries. The disappointing thing was that I found MOST of the salespeople really rude and arrogant.
We stayed overnight in Singapore after our fantastic trip to Vietnam so we were getting around in fairly casual clothes.
A lot of salespeople looked down at us, which we found funny considering my husband probably earns 3x their annual salary! We walked into Hugo Boss, my husband loves the style of the label & has a HB suit but from 2 or 3 staff working, not one greeted us, instead they followed us around the store re arranging the clothes hangers after we looking a the items on them!
Singapore is overpriced and over rated for a city in the middle of nowhere!"
,,Starting point for Orchard malls,4.0,,"Its v accessible via the MRT, when you exit the station, its the mall. The food court have wide variety of choices. Its gets v crowded during lunch and dinner periods plus on the weekends. Good way to try the local foods and highlights such as Singapore Chicken Rice. Since it is a food court within the mall, food prices are higher than local shops, about 10%. Get there early by 10.30 or 11am to eat your brunch and then use this mall as a starting point to connect to Atria and Ngee Ann City/Takashimaya. Navigating other floors can be tricky becos of the levels and too many corridors. As in major Singapore malls, all the brands and shops are available, so if you are a shopholic, this is haven."
,,Elegant shopping centre,4.0,,"A subtle fragrance of green tea welcomes you to the Ion Orchard shopping centre. There arena be many designer shops, a great tea house TWG tea and the Opera Art Gallery make this shopping centre worth a visit. It can be quite difficult to navigate though as it is a massive centre with connecting routes to the train, other shopping centers etc."
,,Great shopping centre,4.0,,"A great architectural structure but most of the shops are below ground on many levels. The vast number of corridors and levels can be confusing and disorientating but the quality and variety of shops are great and make up for it.

Ground floor has the high end shops but venture further in and down and you will get to the more ""affordable"" high street brands.

Right on Orchard Road MRT so can't miss it."
,,Always Crowded,4.0,,"The mall is always crowded and why not, it is exactly beside an MRT station. The food court can get disappointingly crowded as well so if you find yourself hungry, consider going to other adjacent malls to eat.

The mall has a nice selection of stores, especially clothing. The interiors look new and nicely-designed. Navigating may seem difficult in the initial visit but after a while you will get accustomed to the mall's design."
,,Excellent Shopping,5.0,,"This is perhaps singapore's best shopping mall. Do give it a try, you wont be disappointed. The type of clothing available for purchase in this mall is spectacular. The stores are beautifully laid out and customer service throughout is amazing. In general, ION orchard provides a shopping experience like no other mall here at Singapore's orchard road."
,,ION Orchard offers all rounded shopping experience,4.0,,"With so many malls on orchard road where does one start. Well try Ion Orchard. Attached to MRT and Wisma Atria mall and eventually to Ngee Ann City. Not forgetting wheellock centre. So on one stretch you got these four malls. Also connected by underground passages is Shaw Center, Tangs and Lucky plaza. Only one on the strip not connected is Paragon. Starting with ion you get all types of high brands, middle brands and local designers and chains. Food courts and restaurants. Average to elegant. The newness feel is great as you move away from lower level crowds to higher level spaces. I'd rate all the malls as 4's. Lucky plaza suits a different clientele and Seems out of place on the strip but I like to visit for some local cuisine. If you have short stay, try out the underground linked malls above."
,,Wonderful Shopping Mall,4.0,,This shopping mall in Singapore is a must visit for shoppers. But it was very crowded when we visited during the weekend. Lots of high end stores to choose from.There is also a food court.Singapore is truly a shoppers paradise.
,,Every shop you want,4.0,,Only spot you really need to visit on orchard for all your holiday shopping needs. Can be a busy place on the weekend but great for access with mrt system entering straight into shops. Can get a little hard to navigate with a few odd twists and turns but a great overall shopping experience
,,Very good a nice shopping mall,4.0,,I think the best place to shop at orchard road easy to enter from mrt station orchard.The food court is poor but de rest ++++++++
,,"Great Shopping, Better than Marina Bay Sands",5.0,,"It's a bit of a mix between the everyday shopping, and tourist-based higher price shopping (unlike Marina Bay Sands which tends to target the tourists). The food is also great, both the restaurants on the top level, and the food court at the bottom. Don't underestimate the food court like we did at first. Like most things in Singapore, even the food court food has attention to detail. There is a huge variety, and all very tasty and well prepared."
,,Affordable but crowded,4.0,,Its got a nice cross-section of brand outlets and a good food-court as well. The prices here are reasonable too.
,,Modern Peking Duck at ION Food Mall,5.0,,"I dropped off the Food mall at B4 floor and purchased Peking Duck 5p/c at S$6 at ""Modern Peking Duck"" and 2 cheese ball sticks at ""Old Chang Kee"". I usually take food at ION FOOD OPERA but at that time (Sunday noon) I could not find any seat there. Peking Duck and Cheese sticks are both delicious and good value. I would try them again when I come back to Singapore next week. Those match with Tiger beer perfectly."
,,Cleaning Lady super Awesome !,5.0,,"i went to ION Orchard on June 25th, 2012, when i go to the toilet at level 3 i left my mobile phone inside the toilet. i just realized it 30 minutes later, when i went back to the toilet, there's a cleaning lady ( Ms. Ho Chew Yong) standing at the entrance and i was panicked, telling her that i lost my mobile phone. she then calmed me down and said that she has kept the phone and store it at the concierge. what a relief ! than she asked me to come with her to the concierge to pick up the phone. She then asked me to talk with the customer staff to pick up the phone & told me next time not to be careless :)

What a great service ! as an indonesian i believe if it happened in a shopping mall in indonesia, usually ur phone long gone :)

Kudos to super awesome Ms. Ho !!!! and thanks again to Ms Ho & ION Orchard !!!!"
,,Fantastic shopping experience,4.0,,"The ION is one of those Over the Top shopping centres, where the Chanel and other boutiques have high ceiling shopfronts and the bathrooms have floor to ceiling mirrors so you can be sure that you are appropriately groomed before you make an appearance in the mall. The thing we loved about it was the most extensive eateries in the basement B4 or something like that - where there was a main food court, and another 20-30 eateries outside selling a mix of desserts (Japanese, Taiwanese, Singaporean) and other snacks. Not everything in ION costs a fortune, we found most of the affordable shops are in the sub-terranean levels. A great place for dinner and a shopping stroll to pick up things you may not have otherwise bought."
,,Best Food Court in town,4.0,,The shops in this mall are great. But the food court is oustanding. It was great in the evening to purchase a meal and a ice cold draught beer and then sit amongst all the locals who were also having dinner there. And it is good value too.
,,Couldn't ask for more from a shopping centre!,5.0,,This is a great place to do your shopping. there is something for everyone here! the only bad thing was trying to choose what to eat for lunch in amongst all the delicious looking foods from all over the world in the food court.
,,"IMHO, Best Shopping Mall in Singapore",5.0,,"If there is only one mall that you can do in Singapore, then make sure this is the one. Has pretty much something for everyone, and location-wise its on Orchard Road right on top of Orchard MRT.... what more can one ask for........

Bershka, Mango, New Look, Promod, TopShop, Zara, Chomel

Timings - Open Daily: 10am - 10pm.

Nice modern shopping centre with a range of high end designer shops on the higher levels and reasonable priced local boutiques on ground and basement levels.

Uniqlo has an outlet at Ion split on basement levels 2 and 3.

While the Ion Centre has an impressive exterior with a large wave-like structure lit up with lights, the majority of the mall is underground. With passages running under Orchard Road, the Orchard Road MRT and links to other centres nearby, it is difficult to know where the Ion Centre starts and ends.

Lots of places to eat, from first class restaurants to the food court named Food Opera available on Basement 4, which is very reasonable.
The best part is the beautiful LED lit exterior of the building! truly Cosmopolitan!

The floors below ground are mainstream shops for average your Joe and the floors above are high end shops (Dolce and Gabbana, Cartier etc).
Do go to Ion Sky observatory or the Ion art gallery. There are supposed to be some top views up there. Another attraction here is the ION Sky: An observation terrace on the 55th floor, from which you can enjoy beautiful cityscape views.

Indeed, levels 1 - 4 are home to premium international brands like Cartier, Gucci and Prada. But venture further to levels B1 - 4, and you'll see that it also offer shoppers a more affordable selection of high-fashion labels and lifestyle shops.

The only downer about these near perfect restrooms are the fact that they are conspicuously absent from Levels 1 and 2 of the mall. Shoppers entering ION Orchard from street level, as well as those on Level 2 have to make their way to other levels, which can quite take a few minutes given the size of the mall."
,,Easy Access,4.0,,"I used the ION mall frequently as my hotel was located nearby. The mall is predominantly underground with access to the MRT. Many of the shops are middle to high end, more tailored to ladies fashion brands. The architecture of the building is also very impressive"
,,Another Mall,3.0,,Very similar to all Singapore malls. Food court is very Asian centric but in all the varieties. Decent mix of shops of md range shops and great MRT access.
,,Great Mall,5.0,,Beautifully made mall housing a great collection of shops & restaurants. Directly connected to the MRT so very easily accessible.
,,ION Orchard is a gud place to shop!,4.0,,"If u are a shoe fetish, u really gotta go to RUBI ! the shoes are comfort and there are many many choices. They even have promotions like ""but 2 for SGD 20"".
and for casual clothes, go to Cotton On store. The price is affordable and the style is casual chic for both boys and girls :)"
,,All In Stylish Mall,5.0,,"As the hottest mall@ orchard,ion is a kind of that luxury shopping centre that also sells mid brand stuffs. The food court is also a plus point for this mall,completed with many delicious food. Two thumbs up for ion!!"
,,"Ho hum, another Singapore Mall.......",4.0,,"This is a great mall, with every type of brand name from all the famous names to local ones, but as this is my 5th or 6th mall since I've been in Singapore I'm starting to find them all a little samey."
,,Fascinating,4.0,,"The Ion is one of my favourite malls in Singapore.

Easily accessible from the Orchard MRT station you can smell the mall the moment you step off the train. They must add something to the air conditioning system, because the air literally perfumed.

The mall is organised so that the cheaper shops are on the lower levels and the more expensive ones higher up. Highlights for me include Uniqluo, Muji and Fred Perry. The Food Opera food court on the lower levels is very good and there are a ton of other eateries down there.

One of the things that so impressed us originally about this mall is how clean and modern it is. The toilets and baby change facilities are excellent.

The only criticism I can offer is of a personal nature and that is that I have no interest in ""up market"" brands so a lot of the shops on the upper floors are of no interest to me. However, if you are the type who loves ""exclusive"" brands then this would not apply."
,,shopping...,4.0,,"if you are in a mood to shop signatured products, this is one of the great place to visit along the orchard road.."
,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping",3.0,,"Although Ion has lots of lovely shops, the layout made it difficult to get to the stores we wanted"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Wonderful shopping centre with a massive selection of shops. The App you can download is a lot of fun to use.
,,Almost as good as Ngee Ann City,4.0,,Great range of mid priced stores and a good food hall.
,,"The most ""in"" mall",5.0,,"ION Orchard has changed the entire shopping experience in the Orchard Road precinct, with its unique mix of upmarket brands and young-and-trendy shops. This includes the popular Louis Vuitton store and a Forever 21 in the basement, and even Singapore's first Nespresso shop!

With its location directly above the Orchard MRT station, it's certainly the most convenient place to be in Singapore!"
,,Calling all shoppers,5.0,,"Forget the rest, this one is the best! To me shopping is about being inspired, finding new things, being tempted by a special item but also finding that bargain. ION has everything from top of the range to everyday affordable. Don't forget the food court, if you like asian food then plan a long lunch of tastings, delicious!"
,,Forget the mall,5.0,,This place looks beautiful. I hate malls. But this place is special. It seems to have everything. I have never seen so many seemingly happy people in one place. Fantastic range of shops and products. Luxury headquarters. And is the customer service experience here better than the Singapore average. I really think so. You have got to pay a visit. Where else can you buy a 2 carat diamond while you wait in the Post Office queue? Bring (all) your cards. Your wife will love you forever.
,,Better view than from Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Ion is an awesome place to visit, for the spectacular building itself, wonderful luxury mall and for the amazing view from Ion Sky. I would say the view was better from here than from Marina Bay Sands - and we got in for free in the afternoon. I also recommend you check out the Opera Gallery in the mall - it houses some wonderful modern art and is a real hidden gem!"
,,Huge mall with a nice foodcourt,4.0,,"ION is a huge mall with most of the regular chain stores one would find in a North American mall (think Zara, Goex, etc.) The shopping is just OK, but the food court was great, with a huge selection of goodies, from meals to snacks to desserts, from all corners of Asia. I would have to say the food court was the highlight, not so much the shopping. The TWG Tea Company store/cafe has nice (but overpriced tea) and is worth a look. I was so tempted to splurge and would have done so if I didn't already have a large collection of tea."
,,A shopping paradise,4.0,,"ION Orchard Singapore is such a vast shopping mall that it is easy to become completely disoriented, in the way that you have forgotten if you are two levels above ground floor or two levels below ground floor. On every floor interesting shops can be found. Our anchor points are to buy tea at the TWG teas shop on the second floor (to be recommended) and then to descend for an ice blended drink at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. ION Orchard is of course part of the immense Orchard Road shopping experience and contains also the ""Orchard"" MRT station."
,,Graet view and ambience,5.0,,Loved the calm and quiet of the top floor cafe that served incredible fusion japanese food/drinks. Well worth it!
,,"Enormous, labyrinthine, and full of shops...",3.0,,"It's attractive - for a while - but it is just a very large building full of shops. I found it a bit intimidating after a while, wandering back and forth through its many hallways, looking for something that wasn't just an artificial environment built to sell things within.

Ah well. It's probably unfair to attack something for being artificial and commercialised when it is, after all, a shopping mall. There are some very nice escalators here that go up several floors, so that's something nice to see - if you like high end shops, you'll probably like this. If you don't, then I expect you probably won't."
,,HUGE!!,5.0,,"This is simply a massive mall! If you like shopping then you will love this place. My tip is that if you have loads of money to spend, stick to the upper levels (Armani, Channel, Gucci etc etc), if you don't have loads of money, go to the lower levels (where I shopped). There is a MRT station attached to this mall so great for getting anywhere and everywhere in Singapore"
,,Great shopping therapy,5.0,,"Nice modern shopping centre with a range of high end designer shops on the higher levels and reasonable priced local boutiques on ground and basement levels. Good variety of restaurants - The Asian Kitchen, a Taiwanese eatery is definitely worth a stop. Best dish we had was their oyster rice vermicelli noodle soup. Uniqlo has an outlet at Ion split on basement levels 2 and 3."
,,Prepare to get lost underground!,4.0,,"While the Ion Centre has an impressive exterior with a large wave-like structure lit up with lights, the majority of the mall is underground. With passages running under Orchard Road, the Orchard Road MRT and links to other centres nearby, it is difficult to know where the Ion Centre starts and ends. Jam packed with shopping options, tending towards the higher end of the market and fashion oriented. An interesting area to wander around – there is a nice food court and several nice cafes and restaurants throughout the centre as well. Just be prepared to take a few wrong turns and get lost a couple of times."
,,My favourite shopping mall,5.0,,"Out of all the shopping malls I visited - and it was quite a few!. This was definitely my favourite. It looks spectacular from the outside and inside it is still all gleaming and new. Great selection of shops, from high street to top end. Lots of places to eat, from first class restaurants to the food court in the basement, which is very reasonable.
If you are short for time and want a shopping mall with a wow factor, then choose Ion"
,,Big and luxury,5.0,,"They have luxury brand offer in here, and connected with mrt which is very good in location and access"
,,What a Mall,5.0,,"I Went bonkers when i saw this huge magical place in front of my eyes.. its the best rated Mall in the whole of Singapore.. trust me i enetered the place noon time and was out at 9:00 pm in the night only coz the shops were shutting that time.. what a place to shop.. you gets the best brands of bags, superb shoues and all that you need in jewellery under one roof.. it has a huge food court in the basement which serves awesome dishes and various mouth watering cusisnes.. i must say that the entire structure and the way it is designed is fantastic.. for cabies its the best organised place for hitching taxis.. for train traveelers its connected to the MRT's and for the bussies, just come out and walk few steps and there you go, you can travel in your SbS transits.. its right in the centre of orchard street and my best place to shop and it would be my one stop to shop for lifetime in Singapore... so shopaholics go for it and don't miss the heavenly place..."
,,Cosmopolitan!,4.0,,"Singapore is ranked as # 1 in shopping brand index (ref: wiki and 2009 Country Brand Index) and Ion Orchard Mall is a true example of the fact.

All the mainstream brands are lined up under one roof. The best part is the beautiful LED lit exterior of the building! truly Cosmopolitan!"
,,The best mall on Orchard Road.,4.0,,"This mall for us scored highly, great central location on Orchard Road, reasonable food courts and its own MRT station.
It took a bit of getting used to as there are quite a few levels but it is a very large mall (300 shops and lots of eateries).
The floors below ground are mainstream shops for average your Joe and the floors above are high end shops (Dolce and Gabbana, Cartier etc).
As with anywhere in Singapore it was spotless and there were no hassles of any kind. Any staff we asked directions from was polite and knowledgeable.
Did not do the Ion Sky observatory or the Ion art gallery so can't comment. There are supposed to be some top views up there.
All in all we think this is the best mall in central Singapore. If you're staying on Orchard Road you may well be spending quite some time here.
Take a look at our travel map, we joined TA late in life and only review the places we have been to since joining. You may wish to trust our judgment on this mall."
,,Hairstylist Next - Finally a saloon who knows what they are doing,5.0,,"After three bad haircuts lately and many more over the past years in Singapore, I can finally recommend a hair saloon who can cut and treat western hair! The saloon itself is very modern, nice and clean, the support staff (receptionist, wash staff) friendly and most of all, very knowledgeable Art Directors and Technician. ""Next"" has Gabriel as Art Director on board who actually listens and can translate what you like to have. The absolute star at ""Next"" is Jason, the leading Technician. He is extremely knowledgeable and the BEST colourist professional I have come across. I have noted that during my visit a number of western customers came in. Seems to be popular and not only my experience. The only thing I like to suggest to the owner is to change the light. It is too yellow and one looks like coming down with the flu. It helps to have a charming light.
Singapore is full of hair saloons but unfortunately not really catering with expertise for western type of hair. The so called Star Salon at Ngg City fails to be able to hold an intelligent conversation when you call with an inquiry, the other at Palais Rennaisance is hilarious priced and noone in there has a clue about western hair.
Another one at Delfi Orchard puts no conditioner after treatment and tries to pull the stunt that your hair is soooo dry and you need a treatment - nice try."
,,Just another glitzy mall with mediocre food hall.,3.0,,Another relatively new glitzy mall with branded goods at branded price obviously. Nothing spectacular with confusing maze of shops. The food hall is mediocre.
,,"Massive multi-level shopping center in the center of the Orchard Road shopping precinct, and including the Orchard MRT",4.0,,"This is a massive modern shopping complex, incorporating several levels both above and below ground.

The Orchard MRT station is comprised within the center.

It's situated in the center of the Orchard Road shopping precinct, so it's a logical place to visit if you're shopping.

There's hundreds of shops, as well as an underground food hall offeering an incredible array of food.

It's well worth a visit to marvel at the construction achievement, as well as the wide range of shops!!"
,,A Mecca for the Brand Lovers!,5.0,,"Conveniently located right above the Orchard MRT station, this place is a must visit for all luxury goods' lovers.

Spacious lobby makes this mall a refreshing contrast to some of the other claustrophobic malls along Orchard Road.

Not too sure about the restaurants but Food Hall offers great value for money meals."
