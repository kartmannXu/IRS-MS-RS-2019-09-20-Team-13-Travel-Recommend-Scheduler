,,Still worth a visit despite the renovation.,5.0,,"Raffles was still under renovation, but bits are opening up. The Long Bar is open but the queues were very long. The shops was much reduced but should be back to its full size now. The arcade of shops including Leica is well worth a visit and the whole place as it offers glimpses of its glory is worth going to as it slowly awakes."
,,Raffles a must,4.0,,A Singapore sling and a yard of ale. Plenty of monkey nuts to chew . Very quaint and a must for your visit
,,Very expensive... not terribly welcoming!,2.0,,"Sadly, we arrived at the main entrance, took some photos and were escorted to the main hotel by a staff member. We were then told we had to leave as we couldn’t just walk in! No signage or information anywhere. I felt like a second class citizen. Shame on Raffles for not treating people with greater respect or sensitivity. We then went to the Long Bar where the staff were lovely... not surprisingly with the prices they charge. Pressured in a pleasant way to continue drinking but we declined. Crunchy underfoot with the thousands of monkey nut shells strewn over the floor by patrons. Clearly an old (odd) tradition and a great way to keep punters thirsty! Wandered around the outer hallways of the building to the gift shop though it has a more highbrow name. Way too expensive to buy but interesting to read the history. Sadly, the place is overrun with interior design and furniture shops. I guess it has to make money somehow. Perhaps making it more accessible to ordinary folk might encourage them to stay for longer and spend more. I suddenly felt like a pauper! Would I return... probably not. Definitely worth a look at a beautiful colonial building. Sir Stamford Raffles was clearly an entrepreneur! Didn’t realise he considered the hoi polloi unworthy."
,,"Go for it, you know you have to!",5.0,,"You cannot go to Singapore without stopping off at Raffles for that iconic Singapore sling! Not to mention the peanuts, just didn't feel right throwing the shells on the floor...... September2017"
,,A bygone age when service was paramount,5.0,,"Raffles has been under refurbishment for some time, but the Long Bar had just opened again. How pleased was i? You may have to queue to get in, and if you do not want to sit at the bar, or share a table, that is fine. They will get you seated how you want. And then the magic starts. Order a Singapore Sling of course and work your way through the hessian bag of peanuts on your table, remembering to throw your shells onto the floor. Some guests found this unnatural and made a pile of shells on the table. As the waiter or waitress came past, they just brushed them onto the floor anyway. There is no rushing you out. You stay as long as you like. You can imagine that once you have finished, your elephant will be outside waiting to take you home. Do not miss out. Go and see this for yourself !"
,,iconic,5.0,,of course you have to come here!! Order the famous Singapore Sling and enjoy the sack of peanuts. its a mu.st for first time visitors to beautiful Singapore. Keep in mind the cocktail packs a punch. Service is excellent
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"This hotel is still having renovations done to it but the 'Long Bar, which is upstair to the right hand side has reopened having been refurbished. A short que to enter as so many people visiting, took about 25 minutes but well worth it. There is no standing room available so all that enter have to be seated. You can not go to Singapore and not of said you had been to Raffles or indeed sampled the original Singapore Sling. The drink comes with a hessian bag full of monkey nuts which when eaten the shells are thrown on the floor. Not the sort of think you would expect in such an expensive place. different to Sampled a few of these drink whilst in Singapore but none of them tasted like this one!. Another tick of the bucket list."
,,A must stop in Singapore!,4.0,,While the building is under construction the Long Bar is still open and the Singapore Slings are great along with the bags of peanuts still in the shell!
,,A GREAT WALK THROUGH THE SHOPPING ARCADE.,4.0,,"After alighting from the train at Raffles Station, we went for a walk through this arcade.
There are a lot of shops to see and the arcade is well set out.
We had a coffee and shopped for about an hour here.
Well worth looking at but to Australians the items being sold were mostly dearer than we pay back home.
Well worth walking around. Wonderful for photo shots for the photo minded.
Would go back again."
,,Under Construction,3.0,,"The entire exterior of the hotel is currently undergoing reconstruction so entrance is limited and the only place to get the famous Singapore Sling is in the ""Upstairs Bar"" which is beautiful but not the garden view bar where I would traditionally get one. Was disappointed because of the construction and it appears it will be continuing for the next few months."
,,"Hotel still under refurbishment, long bar still open.",4.0,,"A trip to Singapore wouldn’t be complete without a visit to Raffles for a Singapore Sling. However, the hotel itself is still under refurbishment so anyone hoping to get photos other than of the long bar will be disappointed."
,,Quick Drink in the Long Bar,4.0,,"Well....what cam I say, a trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete without a visit to Raffles Hotel. We headed for the Long Bar and Singapore Slings :) Nice relaxing atmosphere and great service. Recommended"
,,Closed until February 2019?,1.0,,Disappointed that the refurbishments are running behind. If it's on your list to visit check with the web site. Some companies were still running trips in December 2018
,,"Very expensive, but it's an experience",3.0,,"Most of the hotel was closed for renovation, but the bar was open so we decided to go for a Singapore Sling. There was a short queue to wait for a table and then we were escorted to our seats by a waiter. The decor was interesting and just how you imagine this old colonial bar to be. Whilst walking to our table we were laughing at the sound of cracking monkey nut shells as the floor was absolutely covered in them. Each table has a small hessian sack of monkey nuts for patrons to eat whilst waiting for your drink. The service it has to be said wasn't great and we waited about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive. The drinks were incredibly expensive (approx £25 each for a Singapore sling). At least we can say we've had a Singapore sling at the Raffles hotel, but we wouldn't rush back."
,,At present it is under renovation,5.0,,"Raffles hotel is an icon, luxury at its best, but be prepared for a huge bill if staying there. Afternoon tea is wonderful so much to choose from. Worth a look around."
,,So much closed,3.0,,Apart from the Raffles gift store everywhere else was closed and boarding was in place due to hotel renovations. We were luck to of picked up a small map to show exactly where the gift shop was as many people on our cruise missed it assuming it was closed as well. There was lots on offer in the gift shop and prices seemed reasonable.
,,"A must on your ""bucket list""",4.0,,Historic and yet modern Raffles Hotel is a beautiful building seemingly untouched by time. It brings back a nostalgic look into the time when Britain ruled most of the civilized world and men and women got dressed up just to have dinner or a drink. The hotel is lovely and offers a bit of shade in the courtyard for those tired of sightseeing. Don't miss a Singapore Sling at the bar and think back on a time when this hotel was the center of Singapore social life.
,,Raffles Hotel Arcade Throwback to a By-Gone Era,5.0,,The old Singapore lives in the feel and ambiance of the Raffles. Have a drink in the Raffles Bar or even better stay and dine there.
,,Interesting,4.0,,A must do when in Singapore. Drinks very expensive but that is what you expect and it is mostly a once only visit.
,,No sign of it opening,3.0,,"We stayed next door and could look down on this. When I first looked i had no idea it was the iconic Raflles, Form above it looks dreadful and I cant’ see it opening anytime soon"
,,Raffles,5.0,,"Unfortunately we did not have a chance to see it, since it was under construction, but the Singapore Sling was good at the pop up bar. Maybe next time."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Went here a couple of years ago extremely expensive but it was a one off Singapore as a whole is very amazing definitely put it on your bucket list
,,CLOSED for renovation,2.0,,The hotel is closed for complete reconstruction. It will open again at the end of 2018. Currently around the hotel there is a wall and is not visible anymore.
,,Get what you pay for,5.0,,"Obviously the most famous and oldest hotel in Singapore is a must visit for the famous and delicious Singapore Sling, gift shop also very good."
,,Another bucket list must !,4.0,,"Just every thing you expect it to be, fabulous environment, great outside bar and staff, didn't stay at the hotel but certainly sampled what was left. The shop is great for souvenirs too."
,,Raffles Hotel Arcade,4.0,,"Visited this iconic hotel and walked around the outside of this marvelous building.
The Long Room was closed for renovation - due to reopen in 2018.
Another bar was open so that you could try the Singapore Sling.
The gift shop was open for small 'nick nacks' to larger more expensive gifts.
Tranquil place to sit near the fountain.
A reminder of true colonial luxury."
,,Closed!!,2.0,,"We travelled to Singapore late December. Raffles is closed until August 2018. Interestingly, no one seems to know this despite conversation with a few local people, Very disappointing to walk there on a hot day to find the place shut up and barricaded with partitions and scaffolding making it impossible to even see the building. More disappointing was that we travelled with a couple who visited Singapore 28 years ago when Raffles was undergoing another renovation closing the entire building. Bizarre coincidence!!"
,,Raffles Hotel Arcade,4.0,,"As the iconic Raffles Hotel is closed for yet more renovation until August 2018, the Arcade is closed off too, but the one redeeming feature is that the Raffles Shop has been kept open at 3, Seah Street, so most souvenirs can still be obtained, but not of course from within the normal setting in the Hotel itself."
,,Classic,4.0,,Visiting the Raffles for a drink is very classic and touristy. But it is worth doing. Also very good gift shop in the House.
,,Great old building,5.0,,"Raffles is under a renovation, so when we were there in December there was only one bar open to the public. It is going to completely close down later in December and re-open in approx. 6 months. We had a Singapore Sling drink (delicious) but at $31.00 each it is not a cheap place to have a drink. The atmosphere was amazing and once the reno. is completed it will be back to original and well worth a visit."
,,Save your money.,3.0,,"Beautiful old building. Look and explore the grounds but don’t fall for buying the iconic Singapore Sling, $40 later and tasteless peanuts."
,,"If in Singapore, you have to say you've been...",4.0,,"Worth coming to (once) but disappointing that the Sling seems to be made and bottled before. Appreciate the efficiency but at over S$30 a drink the personal touch is something to be encouraged. We did have 2 each mind.

The place is under repair/renovation until June 2018 so only the bar/billiards room was open (and the git shop of course). Sadly I didn't get to see the piano, but did have a go on the billiards table which was good fun."
,,A place to visit,4.0,,"Recommend to visit the beautiful and fancy Raffles Hotel (still under repair) to enjoy an original Singapore Sling. You are allowed to throw the nut shells on the floor as in the old days. A Singapore Sling costs 31 dollars, which is a bit expensive, but still recommend to visit."
,,The Historic Raffles Hotel,4.0,,"The historic Raffles Hotel was under renovation during our visit & the famous Long Bar was closed however you could still soak up the atmosphere, get a famous Singapore Sling & throw peanut shells on the floor in the bar area."
,,"Hotel closed, bar is open",5.0,,"While hotel is under repair works, the Raffles shop and the bar are still open. Get a Singapore sling, their favorite drink, in this historical hotel who's name come from the founder of Singapore, Sir Raflles."
,,Lack luster,3.0,,The building was under repair works so we didn't really get to check it out properly. Also the shopping arcade no longer available means it's only the gift shop and bar that's remaining. We went to the gift shop which is reasonably priced and the little of corridors and building we saw is pretty.
,,Beautiful old building,5.0,,"Loved it.Nice old well preserved building.Hotel is closed,will re open in August 2018.Bar is great with bags of peanuts on the table and shells are all over the floor.Singapore sling is great,$ 31 plus 17% tax. Not the cheapest drink but is it a must"
,,Over rated - full of tourists,3.0,,"A visit to Raffels is one of those things that you need to tick off your to do list - but with hind sight, we wish we hadn't bothered. Apart from most of the hotel being under renovation, the main bar is still open and serving. The problem being, is that it is full of tourists all doing the same thing - trying and paying for an over priced Singapore slings - that to be honest, are not all that great. The service is slow and at best indifferent - not only did we have to ask for our drinks several times but when they eventually came even that was a bit of a shambles. My suggestion is to give this place a miss - they are much better bars with a lot more character and much better value."
,,icon of Singapore,4.0,,Raffles Hotel Arcade is a icon of singapore. great architecture and must visit in the evening to see the building under lights
,,Under Renovation,3.0,,"Parts of this Hotel are under renovation and the shopping is high end,but well worth the visit. Drinks are also not on the cheap end."
,,Very Touristy,3.0,,"Worth a walk through. The facade is under construction right now. The history is the most interesting about this place and the fact that it is on Beach street. There use to be a beach...not anymore. They have created more land and built many more buildings. However, It is neat to walk through. The Singapore slings in the Bar are Very pricey and not really worth it. IMO But you have to do what you have to do!"
,,Worth a walk around,3.0,,Definitely worth a walk around if you have the time just for the experience but keep your wallet well hidden. Shops all very much high end
,,A Must Do,5.0,,"A must goto place. Although under renovation, you can still get into the billiard room bar and gift shops and the India Restrooms. But you have to have a Singapore Sling, not cheap at $36 including taxes and tip, but you only live once! Don't forget to help yourself to the free monkey nuts and to discard the shells onto the floor!"
,,Raffles hotel is a must to see,5.0,,Very interesting hotel where many books has been written and you can shop to a good price as well. They have a lot of silk to nice prices.
,,Tourist fun,4.0,,"We went to Raffles for a Singapore Sling even though it's touristy but it was fun. We knew it would be pricey but we only went for one and it was good to know we'd been.

As a lot of other reviews mention, there is a lot of renovation going on but you still have the sense of the history of the hotel and how beautiful it is.

We had the obligatory Singapore Sling in the Billiard Room. It was around S$75 for 2, including taxes. It comes up the biggest bag of peanuts and the floor is covered with shells. Who knows why but our young children found it great fun.

There was one hiccup while we were there. Our children were sitting on the perfectly child-sized chairs when one chair suddenly gave way. Our daughter ended up on the floor. A manager came over (one of a very limited number of staff) to check she was ok. A few minutes later, some juice and cake arrived for them. A nice touch after we were told ""the small chairs are for handbags, not children""!"
,,"Worth a Quick visit now, under massive Renovation Now (Oct 2017)",3.0,,"I stayed at a hotel across the street (JW Marriott) and had always wanted to see this property. I walked over and explored some, most of the main floor is under massive renovation now, the famous bar is not open, lots of other key places are not accessible either. I could get a sense of the history of the place and iconic stature it possesses in the Singapore landscape and culture though. I got this by poking around myself in the courtyards and main level spaces which I could see. I did not go to the bar where they were serving the Sling, even though there were plenty of tourists availing themselves of this option.

I would wait until the renovation is done, then the place will again be beyond smashing. Now, not so much."
,,Currently under renovation,3.0,,"Our guide said that the hotel will be completely refurbished by mid 2018, but some public spaces are still accessible. You could see part of the architectural components of the site but the whole picture is currently unavailable."
,,"Liked the peanuts, liked the history, expensive sling.",2.0,,"Same as other reviewers. Had to do the token moment but don't feel the need to go back. Enjoyed the architecture, history and peanut shells all over the floor however we felt taken advantage of the price of the Singapore Sling."
,,Fun for all of us,5.0,,"We kind of felt pressured into going to Raffles and often when you do something stereo-typically touristy it doesn't live up to your expectations but in this case it did. It's expensive, yes and you feel a bit stupid as you sit and watch every other tourist like yourself wander in, order a Singapore sling and leave. So for that reason it doesn't have much of a legitimate bar vibe. However, despite all that as a young family we actually really enjoyed it. Partly because we had low expectations and partly due to the HUGE helping of delicious monkey nuts you get given and the fact that you are allowed to put the shells on the floor - endless fun for our 6yr old boy!"
,,Sort of a Must,4.0,,"Since it if an iconic and historic and iconic landmark, it is sort of a must. Major construction when we were there took something away from the ambience but it was still fun and memorable to visit. Would like to go when it is less noisy but I am sure improvements needed to be made."
,,Gotta have a Singapore Sling!,5.0,,"As many reviewers have noted the long has closed for renos since my last visit but the billiard bar is the temporary home of the Singapore Sling.

It's a must to go and eat peanuts and have a few drinks in a glorious colonial ambience.

It's expensive as hell, but what the hell! You only live once!

Ok to go with teens to escape the heat and there is a small offering of bar food.

Just do it."
,,Come on now! You have to have your Singapore Sling!,5.0,,"We got in quickly, had a table and ordered our Singapore Slings that we completely enjoyed! Nice conversation with others at other tables. Staff very friendly!"
,,A pointless waste of your time and money,1.0,,"So like many others we turned up here to have a Singapore Sling and tick that one off the list. However, the question should be why on earth would you as the experience feels thoroughly lowbrow and you would be better spending your money on nicer drinks elsewhere.
The hotel itself is a stunning piece of colonial history (and there's not a lot of history in SP) but you can go in and have a nose around anyway. The drinks are not being served in the original room as that is being renovated. You are therefore directed round to the Bar and Billiard room and there is a bit of laminated plastic telling you that this is a great room. To our surprise we encountered a queue outside although not much seemed to be happening inside. The place was supposed to have opened 90 mins earlier; there was no information available and nothing seemed to be happening. To be honest the whole thing felt like being in a theme park which is hardly the ambience we were hoping to recreate. After 20 mins we along with many others decided to avoid paying stupid money for Sling and went off for a drink elsewhere. Most isappointing"
,,Home of Singapore Sling,4.0,,this place is under renovation but you can walk around the limited shops and go the Bar and Billiards bar and restaurant. The price for the drink is ludicrous but worth for a once a lifetime try. It is really historic as it carries the Raffles name. Colonial architecture.
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Singapore Slings are served in alternative bar at the moment but atmosphere is elegant but relaxed, Singapore Sling is delicious and peanuts are included. One Sling costs 31 SGD but is worth it."
,,$31 singapore sling and ok ambiance,3.0,,Ticked that off the bucket list but will never return again. Sad thing is that the hotel could make it a place where people go back again and again but with prices like that and everyone being treated as cattle it's definitely not someplace I'll go back to. Then again they don't have to fight for business as they have built it and people will go once but never go again. I also don't think they have enough servers for the amount of people that visit so that's why there's no interaction or engagement by the staff with the exception of taking the order. Peanut concept is fun and the drink is ok.
,,Singapore Sling in the Billiard Room,4.0,,"I thought we were going to be disappointed as the long bar is closed for renovation but the billiard room was stunning. The singapore slings although expensive were delicious and the peanuts a nice touch.
HOWEVER, if I had know that a glass of still water would cost me $7 I would never have ordered it. Even for a luxury hotel this price is ludicrous.
Our waiter was very friendly and attentive however we had a different person give us the bill. Once we asked for the bill, we felt very rushed to leave. Other than that It was a nice experience."
,,Lots of construction at the moment and high prices,2.0,,Raffles is an institution. I've been there a few times but this time was travelling with someone and not able to experience the real 'Raffles' I have in the past. Temporary Long Bar and really expensive premixed Singapore Slings served with very little of that hospitality you expect from Raffles.
,,snob value,2.0,,We couldn't wait to visit this hotel as its reputation was on our bucket list . We weren't allowed to even have a coffee as we were wearing dress shorts altho I did mange to use the rest rooms. Very disappointed as we had caught a taxi specifically to dine here.
,,Must go,5.0,,"Raffles is one of those thing on the bucket list, or the place you go because it's Raffles, I mean you wouldn't go to Paris with out seeing the Eiffel tower, or Buck palace in London."
,,Unique bar,4.0,,"As this was the home of the Singapore sling, we had to visit to sample the famous cocktail. The atmosphere in the bar area was great, monkey nuts are provided on each table and once you had cracked the shell of the nut it was customary to throw the shell on the floor - this was covered and quite unique. The Singapore sling however, was a little disappointing as it didn't really take of anything other than juice."
,,Raffles....A Must but bring your wallet!,5.0,,"Raffles and the Singapore Sling go hand-in-hand. High tea is for the traveller who comes prepared with fine clothing and the touches of colonial attire but the ordinary person goes to the bar and feasts on bags of peanuts (provided free) and throws according to custom, the kernels on the ground!!! Ordering a Sling is a must but again prepare to pay way way over the odds as you are experiencing a tradition not just a cocktail. A fabulous experience ..Raffles has it all even when restoration works are in full swing."
,,Good to vist but disapointing,4.0,,"Was so looking forward to see Raffles, but the only thing to see is the gift shop, everything else is closed for renovations. The gift shop is goo but I thought a little over priced."
,,Fantastic experience,4.0,,"I Pre-booked for High tea at Raffles with the family and found the whole experience was worth it.
The food was very good sandwiches excellent and there was so much to eat that you do not leave hungry.
The family really enjoyed this kids also.
I would recommend this as its a one off experience if visiting Singapore but book in advance so there is no waiting or disappointment.
The only down side was the hotel was under going restoration and some parts not open."
,,Beautiful hotel,3.0,,"I found a funny sign in the hotel that sent me straight out onto the street. The walk is ok, but its worth walking into the hotel."
,,No need to be a Hotel Guest to enjoy this magnificent premises,5.0,,"Raffles Hotel is a MUST in Singapore. Intimately embeded in the country history since XIX century, you can feel and breath the atmosphere of ""grandeur"" and colonia spirit that inspired Rudyard Kippling to wite ""The Jungle Book"" or Emilio Salgari the epics of the Malayan pirate Sandokan.
Luxurious tropical vegetation manicured to perfection in teh Patios where fresh and cool air circulate will provide natural shadow-aka sun protection- while strolling the arcade and shopping its glamourous souvenirs.
The experience will be perfect sipping a Singapore Sling (invented by the Raffles Hotel barman in 1915 to help ladies enjoy alcoholic drings in public overcoming customary restrictions) in the Long bar , or the grill -also open for Non Hotel Guests.
a Must...Been there, done that."
,,"One can't imagine going to Singapore and not having a Singapore Sling at Raffel's Hotel, not inexpensive but the experie",4.0,,"Unfortunately during our visit renovations were ongoing and a number of areas were closed including the long bar as well as some shops. Additionally there was a wedding reception so that portion of the building was closed as well.

We enjoyed drinks in the Bar & Billard room after viewing The portions of the building that were accessible. The courtyards and fountains are beautiful and remind one of the courtyards of New Orleans or other southern cities with lush greenery. Expensive drinks but definitely worth the effort, especially when one considers the history."
,,wandering around the shops,4.0,,"I wasn't staying long in Singapore and I didn't really have any space in my luggage to pack items, so window shopping only. The exchange rates weren't favourable either. This mall has all the top shops and brands, it's light and airy and cool."
,,Raffles.......is Singapore,5.0,,I get blown away when I visit the Raffles......the history is amazing. Singapore was taken over by the Japanese while the British General was drinking in The Long Bar!
,,Disappointing - renovations and barricades!,2.0,,"During our most recent visit to Singapore, we paid another visit to the Raffles Hotel Arcade. On arrival, we were most disappointed to discover that most of the Raffles Hotel was under renovation and therefore closed off to the public.
The Raffles Hotel Arcade however, was open to the public although it appeared that some of the shops had closed down during the renovation period. We were able to visit the Raffles Hotel gift shop and make a couple of purchases.
The Raffles Hotel courtyard was barricaded off from the arcade and you were unable to see anything.
Therefore, it is our recommendation that it would be a waste of time to visit the Raffles Hotel Arcade until the renovations are completed. We were advised that it is planned for the renovations to be completed by September this year, just in time for the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix."
,,Must do,5.0,,"Historic building, unmissable if you are in Singapore. The famous Long Bar is currently closed for renovation but we could treat our-self with the iconic Singapore Sling served in the Bar & Billiard room. Great atmosphere, colonial decor and nuts available at every table to keep the tradition of throwing away the nutshell on the floor."
,,A must whist in Singapore...just to tick it off the bucket list.......,4.0,,"As the saying goes ""When in Rome"", our first visit to Singapore....so Raffles and a Singapore Sling were on the bucket list.........not cheap...$32 but had to be done.......
Firstly the building is beautiful...full of character and history of a bygone age, along with pleasant courtyards and fountains........the Long Bar is closed at the moment so drinks were taken in the Bar & Billiard Room...like I said not cheap....but probably on everyone's bucket list when in Singapore.....as well as the Singapore Slings you get a very large bag of peanuts to accompany them.....would recommend going just to see the building even if not taking in drinks........."
,,Very nice hotel with legendary bar,4.0,,"Very nice hotel with legendary bar. Everything was as I expected it to be. A bit unfortunate that the hotel is so expensive, otherwise would be worth staying there for one or two nights to enjoy it. The bar is quite expensive as well."
,,What's a Singapore visit with Raffles,5.0,,Much of Raffles is under major renovation but the Billiard Room Bar is still open. The history just seeps out. Singapore Slings are expensive but our group all ordered one each. The free peanuts were a treat and the floor was covered (as is the tradition) with empty shells when we left. There is a souvenir shop next door to the bar. Raffles has great atmosphere and it was a good night out with friends.
,,Raffles,3.0,,"Where to start. Raffles is a destination hotel in Singapore. I always love going there. Very expensive but worth it. When we were there last, they had the long bar shut down, the steak house shut down and the garden bar shut down. Only the grill and Billiard room bar were open. I understand they are closing them this month as well for renovations and none of these amenities will be open until 2018. I don't know who thought this plan was a good one but they are an idiot. You don't shut down the main draws at a hotel like this all at once. If they need to do that much renovation, they should have just shut down the entire hotel and gotten it done. Very disappointed that on this trip I couldn't enjoy what I love about Raffles.
$32 Singapore Slings and I can't remember how much the beer is. $25/glass? Who cares? I don't, but just so you know. If you are on a budget, don't go here. But if you go to Singapore and don't go to Raffles then you are missing out. I just wish they would fire the idiot that decided to basically shut down the entire hotel for two years. Bad plan. Very disappointed that I couldn't spend my 64th birthday at the Long Bar and the Steak House."
,,"Iconic, beautiful historic place!",5.0,,"Another unmissable, characterful and historic place to visit. There is something to catch everyone's interest!"
,,Tick it off your bucket list!,5.0,,An iconic and historic building that we have always wanted to visit. The famous Long Bar is currently closed for renovation so the only place to get the eponymous Singapore Sling is in the Bar & Billiard Room. The bag of nuts are still available whilst you drink and it's still a beautiful building full of history.
,,Afternoon tea,4.0,,"Went for afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room. Very enjoyable experience. Great surroundings.
Service from the waitress was excellent - very friendly and attentive.
Sandwiches and cakes excellent and topped up when required. Buffet also very good with Asian and western options. All 3 of us satisfyingly full at the end.
Price around £40 each once they add on service and tax which is comparible with similar London / UK hotels.
Had a drink in the Billiard Room which was OK but expensive.
Would recommend but closes shortly for an extended period so be quick"
,,Try a Singapore Sling,4.0,,"Absolutely beautiful buildings. Very peaceful to walk around. Great photo opportunities. Seemed to be a lot of empty shops around, with windows all covered in paper - maybe undergoing a refurb? Plenty of places to grab a coffee or a drink but I would recommend having a look around then finishing at the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling. Not cheap, I think $78 for 2 but one of those things you have to do. Enjoy it because you wouldn't have a second at that price. For a really quiet arcade it was quite amazing to see such a crowd in this bar. Service is slow but sit at the bar and watch the barman making the drinks - quite a spectacle. Things have changed a little over the years - 20 years ago you threw your peanut shells on the floor - nowadays they provide a little basket for the shells."
,,Only one Raffles,5.0,,We visited the hotel to enjoy the ambience and architecture. One wing of the hotel is currently being renovated and off limits. We still enjoyed a drink in the Billiards Bar. Its a unique and special place.
,,Must do,3.0,,"We went to Raffles to try a Singapore sling. When we got there we changed our minds and preferred a coffee instead. You couldn't get one as the bakery is closed for renovations so we were disappointed, we can't be the only ones wanting a coffee rather than alcohol. Beautiful courtyards with fountains and colonial styled buildings ."
,,Nostalgia,4.0,,A lot of history with a moden finish . Great Long Bar and you feel the history of the place . Go back to colonialisim .
,,A Touch of History,5.0,,"A must see if you are into past history of Singapore , a spectacular heritage building famous for it's refreshing drink , ""the Singapore Sling"" one can enjoy the drink whilst admiring the old fixtures , fittings and architrave whilst munching on complimentary peanuts and dropping the shells on the floor , a tradition for over a hundred years.
One call also experience high afternoon tea , but must be suitably dressed , no shorts , thongs etc"
,,It has to be on you list when you visit Singapore,5.0,,"Raffles hotel is a must, with the visit to the hotel and a sample of the world renowned Singapore Sling, a tradition. I loved the peanuts available to eat out of the sacks. Raffles area has developed so much. There is lots to see and do and buy. Easy to access by public transport. Great to look into the history of the hotel and the area which Stanford Raffles established."
,,Worth a Visit,3.0,,"Raffles Hotel being a Singapore Icon, it is worth a visit. The Long Bar was being renovated during my visit so I had a Guinness in the Billiard Bar. A snip at only £14 Sterling. It was cold though. Souvenir shop full of tat with Raffles written on it and way overpriced."
,,OLD GRANDEUR HOTEL,5.0,,"A must to see of old imperialism hotel from 1800 hundreds. Lavish court yards and gardens. Old lunch and dinning settings. This is ware the Singapore Sling drink originated from, if you want to have one it will cost you 36 Singapore Dollars .At present some restoration being done. Great place to spend time looking around."
,,A good city to visit,4.0,,"Good for families, couples,or singles plenty for everyone to enjoy a big plus is it's low crime rate very safe to walk around even in the early hours,Public transport is very efficient and cost effective"
,,Colonial Hotel,4.0,,"We did not stay at this hotel, but went to visit it and try the famous Singapore Slim. It is worth to visit the hotel and be transported to the colonial era. The Slim singapore came in wonderfully refreshing and delicious"
,,A| must do for Singapore,5.0,,Lovely piece of history to go to the Rafles and have a singapore sling. Quite costly at $31.00 per glass and you don't get to take home the glass that would cost you extra. The long bar was being renovated.
,,Bucket list,4.0,,"Raffles just has to be done. My only recommendation is forget the price for an hour and just enjoy your Singapore Sling whilst munching on some nuts.

The decor is exact,y as you expect it to be, in a classical 1900s style. It is just beautiful. The staff are extremely attentive and we're almost subservient.

We ordered two Singapore Slings and took our sweet time drinking them. The bill came to $73, the menu gives on every price, but you must add tax and service charges.

You must do this just to knock it off the bucket list.

Do yourself a favour and don't visit the gift shop, you will be disappointed."
,,It's got to be done,4.0,,"A majestic colonial hotel in the midst of bustling Singapore where the Singapore Sling cocktail was invented. A beautiful old building outside and in. We dressed up a little but you don't need to. We just felt it was the right thing to do. The Long Bar was being renovated on our visit so Billiard Room was being used. The staff are charming and helpful. The room is decadent and the cocktails expensive - so be prepared. I think it was $31 dollars per drink. It was delicious though. Oh, and when you go to pay, there is GDT and a service charge, making each cocktail about $37 (I think). But we loved the experience"
,,Love Old Raffles,4.0,,Even though it was being renovated during our stay we loved walking around the old Raffles Hotel. There are so many shops and restaurants and galleries there. On the higher price end of things as you would expect. If you are interested in savouring the colonial world of pre-WWII Singapore this is a must place to visit.
,,"If you can't buy it here, it probably does not exist",5.0,,"This arcade is massive. We have visited it before but did not realize just how big it is and under how many blocks it goes. Great for getting out of the heat several blocks away from our hotel, just enter the arcade and find your way to your hotel. Mind you, we did get lost a few times on the first few days, but it was a great adventure trying to find our way back and window shopping on the way. The range of outlets was fantastic, from the obscenely expensive, to very low priced items. My wife finally found the perfect hairdresser which she was very happy with. Only problem is that he is a 5 hour flight from home. We spent many hours shopping and dining in the arcade, and there is still much more to discover, but we are leaving that for our next trip."
,,Not worth the trouble.,2.0,,"With some time to kill and several friends suggesting the importance of a store at the historic hotel, we took the time to stop by. No overpriced cocktail nor ghosts of British authors makes this an important stop. Singapore has much better uses for your time.

By the way, the hotel is being refurbished, adding to the reasons to go else where."
,,Currently undergoing extensive renovations,2.0,,A good portion of the hotel is currently undergoing extensive renovations. This means that many of the shops and restaurants that used to be there have had to relocate to other premises whilst the renovations occur. As such at present the arcade really isn't worth visiting.
,,Just have a glance !!,4.0,,"Its an old building and they are proud to show it off like that..very beautiful architecture, very different from the usual Singapore style !! This is the place to have the Famous Singapore Sling drink, which costs $31 SGD, at the long bar!!!"
,,Not as Good as it Used to Be,3.0,,"Only a few shops selling mostly to very upscale crowds. Shop helpers were very ""stand-offish"" although not umfriendly."
,,Only good for a look,3.0,,"The only reason (apart from its opulence) that visitors flock here is because of the history associated with the hotel, only hotels guests are allowed into the main hotel building (very understandable) casual visitors can go into the snooker room & bar; but if you want my advice just have a look and take your photos of the bar, courtyard etc and leave because it is so expensive and believe me Singapore Slings aren't very nice."
,,Grabbing a Singapore Sling,4.0,,Just grabbed a couple photos and had a Singapore Sling. Wanted to experience a spot of history. It was unfortunate that they were renovating so we couldnt sit in the Long Bar but we made do. Drink was $31 SGD and you dont get to keep the glass :(
,,Raffles Hotel Arcade is Good for Gift Shop and Singapore Sling at the Long Bar,4.0,,"If you go to Singapore you have to at least visit the Raffles Hotel. You can only see a portion of the hotel though unless you are a guest. With some renovation work being done you are even more limited. But just go to get you souvenir from Raffles gift shop which has many nice items and then the Long Bar to have the Singapore Sling and throw peanuts hulls on the floor. Then check it off your bucket list. That is about it. There is a good sandwich menu and those look rather good. A good choice of some desserts as well. So, for a bit of rest, nostalgia, and saying you have been to Raffles Hotel, this will do it."
,,"A must do thing in Singapoe, but average",3.0,,"Everyone has to go to Raffles Hotel and have a cocktail when in Singapore and of course the owners know it. The Long Bar was closed for a refurb, so they were using the Billiard Room, which was very pleasant. It was early evening and we didn't have to queue at all. You still get lots of Monkey Nuts to eat and throw the shells on the floor. We paid S$73 for 2 Singapore Slings. Rediculous really, and they are not very pleasant (sweet and sickly), but like everyone else, it has to be done, so we did. Would we rush back - er no. Once was enough."
,,History and home of the Singapore Sling,5.0,,"We picked the right day to go, the Long Bar was open, it was raining and very few people around. Although the drinks were somewhat expensive, it was well worth it.
Just sitting there with the rain it was an amazing experience and gave you time to think about all the famous people who have visited and the historical events that shaped Singapore.
We would definitely recommend a visit as there is quite a bit to see and do after you have had that famous beverage."
,,Pay for the privilege,4.0,,"The buildings here are magnificent, and the service was impeccable, but you will definitely feel it in the pocketbook if you wish to enjoy their famous Singapore Sling. Enjoy one and relax, take photos, then find a more affordable spot to continue the evening. Glad we saw it, the cocktail was excellent, but a bit rich for my blood."
,,SOOO DISAPPOINTING!,2.0,,Must do the Raffles for a Gin Sling eh???? Queue in the rain for half and hour to go to a side-building... Gin Sling $28 .. and my 2 grandchildren had mocktails at $14 each... add the taxes and the experience cost about $65....very disappointing- nothing special.
,,A disappointment,2.0,,"Went into book a table for High Tea and was basically ushered into the shop and tourist area at the side of the hotel. The magic is gone, in my opinion its just an old hotel in the middle of a roundabout which has lost its magic. Felt unwanted and wont go back. Got the impression it was just a one hit wonder for the tourists who go on the history but there are far better hotels in the area now which are more welcoming."
,,Sure may be a tourist trap...but a pretty sweet one :),4.0,,Yes one of the 'must see' attractions in Singapore and for the traveler who is here for a lay-over a short stay this is at the top of the list. Photos are free but if you want the full experience of Raffles and the iconic Singapore Sling bring your wallet...but hey you only live once :)
,,"Gorgeous, gorgeous Raffles",5.0,,"Be reminded of a bygone Singapore era by visiting Raffles. Unfortunately at least half of Raffles was being renovated when we visited (due to be completed in 2018), however we were still able to wander around part of the grounds and visit the gift shop. The architecture and gardens are stunning - would love to stay there one day."
,,Home of the Singapore sling,4.0,,"Went here for the legendary Singapore sling. A cool experience with good drinks and great atmosphere. The hotel is very beautiful and picturesque. The drinks are kind of expensive, but worth it for the experience :)"
,,Wonderful Colonial Hotel,3.0,,"While Raffles is beautiful and in itself represent incredible history of Singapore, from colonization to modern day Society, it is also a bit over hyped. One cool thing is that you can have a Singapore Sling at the heart of its origins. The setting is very antique and it gives the whole drink experience quite the ambience. While I very much enjoyed my drink and time spent there, it may be overhyped and certainly overpriced.

This one I think is quite up to each individual traveler and what their particular interests (and time frame in Singapore)."
,,Under renovations,4.0,,"Went there with few of my small groups but the place was covered and said under renovation so we only could see the front lobby. We ended up looked around the area which was nice as well like civil war memorial, raffles city mall"
,,Need to go there,4.0,,"If visiting Singapore, a visit to Raffles is a must. There is a selection of cocktails. I loved the Singapore sling, , but the others were also delicious. They are expensive,but good to say you gave been there!"
,,One of the leading hotels in the world in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must for every visitor in Singapore_this hotel was one of the first major buildings in Singapore_The name Raffles was the family name of the founder of Singapore Sir Raffles_Excellent idea is to drink High tea in the lobby area and drink the famous Singapore Sling, a created by one of the barmens"
,,very good to take photo,5.0,,"clean arcade, good fotr photo, and near to MRT station, i like to walking around here with family and using babyt stroller"
,,renovations,3.0,,the arcade may have been more impressive without all the construction and if some of the stores hadn't closed permanently.
,,Shopping,4.0,,Nice shopping arcade in the famous Raffles Hotel . Some renovations kept the building wrapped up but could stroll along the wide verandas. Boutique shops with interesting merchandise.
,,Good place to stay,5.0,,You can book the hotel rooms online as they provide with discount of online bookings. The stay in this hotel was good and was in proximity with the down.
,,Luxurious Heritage Hotel,5.0,,"It's a very luxurious heritage hotel. We can compare it to Hotel Majapahit in Surabaya or Eastern & Oriental Hotel in Georgetown, Penang."
,,Singapore slung!!!,4.0,,"Everything I expected from this expirience,we popped into the bar for a drink,the Long bar was under refurbishment,drinks were being served in the Billiard room,I was not dissapointed as the atmosphere was perfect"
,,Cafe Under Construction,4.0,,"My wife and I went to the little cafe attached to the Raffles, unfortunately it no longer exists. the area is boarded up. We hope for a NEW cafe"
,,Old Colonial hotel at its best,5.0,,When visiting Singapore you have to visit Raffles for a Singapore sling. Not how I imagined it but all the same the ambiance of the hotel is lovely. The afternoon tea is ever popular. A must do when visiting Singapore.
,,Raffles Bar & Billiard Room,5.0,,This is a classic must stop at place for any visitor to Singapore. Chance to skull a Singapore Sling and throw your peanut shells on the floor!! Classic
,,A must when visiting Singapore,4.0,,We attended the bar to get the almost obligatory Singapore Sling for first timers to Singapore. The cocktail seemed expensive but when you add up the contents the £24 + per drink was worthwhile just to say that you had done it
,,One of the top 10 attractions in Singapore,5.0,,Raffles Hotel is a must-do attraction in Singapore. Unfortunately the Long Bar was closed for renovation during our visit as part of a major refurbishment but you can still sample the famous Singapore Sling cocktail in the billiard room.
,,A few high end boutiques here but they are also everywhere else,3.0,,"I frequent this place because I am a loyal customer of a tenant and this tenant is not present anywhere else. Apart from such specialty tenants, there are branded boutiques which are also present in many other locations. I don't think it is worth a special trip unless you have a specific reason to."
,,A must visit place full of history,5.0,,"The Raffles Hotel is synonymous with the old colonial past of Singapore. It is accessible to non hotel guests to have drinks in the Billiard Room Bar, the restauarants and the shop. The hotel is well maintained"
,,Singapore Sling at Raffles is a must,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore then you must go to Raffles to have one of the legendary Singapore Slings. At $30 per drink they are not cheap but you are really paying for the history of this outstanding hotel. They also have a High Tea, but if you don't have time or want to pay the extra for this then I recommend the Singapore Sling as a way of soaking up the atmosphere of this historic hotel"
,,Singapore Sling and Nuts,4.0,,"Have been to Singapore several times and never made it to Raffles. My husband and I went there before dinner. The hotel itself was very nostalgic, however disappointed with the lack of dress code. We were in the pool room at eight p.m and there were people in beachwear. It felt like I could have been in any bar in Singapore that puts bags of nuts on the table. If you have been out shopping or exploring attractions don't feel like you have to go back to your hotel to change before heading to the bar. You will be fine as you are. Expect a short wait to get in."
,,Iconic Hotel,3.0,,"A century old hotel. But after the renovation, it does not look old at all. Many different restaurants there,"
,,Fun!,5.0,,"Went here to experience the Singapore Sling where it was invented. Was gorgeous, although a bit pricey! Wonderful atmosphere, very colonial. Dark wood, ceiling fans, cane furniture. At the Long bar peanuts are served for free and shells are just dropped on the floor. Lovely experience"
,,When in Singapore...,4.0,,"have a Singapore Sling! It will set you back $31.00 but what the hell, you're in Singapore. They are currently under renovation so we had our drinks at the downstairs bar, which was just fine. After we decide to have lunch but were turned down because of the dress code which we did not meet. Oh well, we got our Singapore Slings and we were happy."
,,a jewel not to be missed,5.0,,the world reputation for Raffles is well deserved. you do need to be careful at the moment as its undergoing a major refurb so lots of sections are currently closed or will be in May. the Asian restaurant which is where you can enjoy the Raffles signature food is excellent. we were able to have a guided tour which is only held on the first Saturday in the month and only three tours of 15 to max 20 people. we were also lucky enough to see the presidential suit where the rich and famous have stayed (including our Royalty) not open very often as usually booked. You must sample the famous Singapore Sling even though very expensive ($S36 each) but completes the experience.
,,Historic but currently under renovation,3.0,,"Building with historical significance, unfortunately it is currently under renovation. Some of the shops are still open but many are closed. Worth a walk by to say you've seen it but better when no renovation work going on."
,,Carrying on the Singapore Sling tradition!,4.0,,"My mum came to the Raffles Long Bar in 1983 and had a Singapore Sling so I thought it only fitting that I carry on a tradition and do the same. The Long Bar is closed for renovations so we were seated in the Billiard Room. It's a lovely old place with all of the original finishing.
The first thing I noticed was how the floor was COVERED in peanut shells. I was just delighted- it doesn't get much more authentic than sitting at a bar shelling peanuts.
The Singapore Sling itself was tasty but prepare yourself for the bill as they are $37 each!!
Well worth the visit for the heck of doing it- definitely a novelty."
,,asian trip,5.0,,We went to the Raffles Hotel for the experience of having the traditional Sing a Pore Sling The hotel is a must see & the drinks were also great
,,Historic but not worth it.,2.0,,"Luckily, we stayed across the street and didnt have to travel far to get there. I would have been upset if I made a journey just to see the place. The lobby was closed to everyone except guests and restaurant patrons. Everything there is overpriced and not worth a visit unless you're already there."
,,You have to visit at least once in your life!!!,5.0,,"I had to see this place after seeing the movies. We had the Singapore Sling sat in the bar area with monkey nut shells on the floor and wild birds picking up the pieces. Great atmosphere, a must for anyone wanting to see a bit of modern history."
,,Singapore Sling!,4.0,,"Knowing that a Singapore Sling costs $37 each, we decided to do it anyway..The long bar was shut for renovation, so had our drinks in the Billiard Bar. Were our drinks worth the money? Of course not, but the atmosphere and the experience certainly was. As long as you are prepared for the cost, it's well worth a visit."
,,Hotel gift shop shopping,3.0,,Yet more shopping in Singapore but this time at the historic Raffles Hotel (owned by the French Accor Group). It was here that the famous Singapore Sling cocktail was invented.
,,Iconic,4.0,,"This hotel is iconic and it exudes a throw back to colonial times. Even if you don't do the high tea, at least make the most of a photo opportunity."
,,Guess you have to go there?,3.0,,"When is Shanghai you have to go to Raffles, right? Its a tradition!
It hasn't changed since we were there in 1995 and we still have the 2 Printed Singapore Sling Glasses they gave us then. If you want the glasses now you have to pay $25 each for them. On the tour, the difference in the cost was $30 if you wanted the Sling! My wife and I had 1 pint of Tiger Beer & a Moscow Mule Cocktail and with Surcharge & Vat added it cost us $55 Singapore Dollars. Yes we only had 1 drink each! But you could eat as many peanuts as you wanted and make a mess of the floor & table!"
,,Relaxing in time honoured tradition!,5.0,,"Lovely afternoon tea in the Tiffin Room accompanied by a harpist. What more could you want? A mixture of traditional and Singapore dishes, a choice of teas and a Singapore Sling. The smile never left my face! Yes, it's expensive and a tourist attraction but Raffles is an iconic setting and I doubt I'll ever return."
,,Ticked off the bucket list,4.0,,"Four of us celebrated my sister's silver wedding anniversary with High Tea at Raffles. We were not disappointed. The elegance, the history, the ombience all added to a very delightful afternoon, not to mention the delicious sandwiches, little cakes & the warm scones oh & did I mention the dim sum station & the harpist, a delightful touch.
All this added up to a very pleasant afternoon where we felt we had been transported back to the days of yore, when there was time to sit, relax & enjoy each others company, the food, the wine & the surroundings. A wonderful experience & I am glad I have been able to tick it off the bucket list."
,,A Must do,5.0,,Have to go for a Singapore Sling 🍸 But more is Raffles High Tea was exceptional was there for my Husbands Birthday 🎂
,,Afternoon tea,4.0,,"We spent the afternoon here, had afternoon tea as a special treat for my birthday. The food and service was amazing we really enjoyed it. Had to have a Singapore sling but both drink and tea very expensive but ok for special occasion. They have gift shop here which again is expensive. Just something one has to do when in Singapore."
,,Have a Singapore Sling and enjoy the Bar !,4.0,,"Have a Singapore Sling and enjoy the Bar ! It is an amazing feeling to have a (very expansive) Singapore Sling at its original place of invention. Sit, drink and enjoy the scenerie inside the Bar and Billiards Room."
,,Simply have to visit Raffles,5.0,,Top of my Singapore stopover wish list was to enjoy a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar at Raffles and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't overly busy when I was there and the Singapore Slings were made in front of me not pre-made. Enjoyed the obligatory peanuts and duly dropped the shells on the ground. Went back again in the evening and enjoyed live music upstairs. If I'd had more time would have definitely experience either a lunch or afternoon tea.
,,"It was on my ""must see list""",4.0,,"Raffles is currently undergoing renovations so the Long Bar was closed and drinks were available in the Billiard room . We decided no visit was complete without a Singapore sling, so we joined the queue at about 10 pm to be admitted (I usually avoid queuing but made an exception for this historic location)
The drinks were expensive ( $62 for 2) but the atmosphere was worth the cost. Besides, we needed to contribute to the cost of cleaning up all the peanut shells!
Definitely worth a visit."
,,Singapore sling!,4.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a stroll through Raffles Hotel. Even though large parts of it were under construction when we visited, we still managed to get a Sling in the Billiard Room Bar. Enjoy the peanuts and make sure you continue the tradition of chucking the shells on the floor."
,,Fantastic experience,4.0,,We had dinner in raffles restaurants for our 25th wedding anniversary- wonderful experience but very expensive.
,,Visit for a Singapore Sling!!,5.0,,"A must-visit when in Singapore to have their world famous Singapore Sling! The usual bar (Long Bar) that serves this was under renovation when we went, so they were serving them in the Billiard Room. The room was delightful! I felt like I had been dropped in the middle of a movie set from the 50s! We didn’t book, but the place was quite busy and we got sat at the bar which was so nice to watch people. You’ll notice there’s monkey nut shells everywhere on the floor which is apparently a tradition, and we really enjoyed eating the complimentary nuts and just throwing the shells! The bar tenders are very friendly and chatty, and one told us they serve over 1,000 Slings a day! We paid just under S$60 for 1 alcoholic and 1 non-alcoholic Sling which I thought was very expensive, but definitely worth it!"
,,A visit back in time,4.0,,"The long bar is closed until 2018 but the billiard room bar is open and is very atmospheric. Peanuts in bags on each table and still the tradition of throwing the empty shells on the floor.
Drinks are on the pricy side a Singapore sling is around £17 and a pint of Tiger lager not much cheaper. April 17,
The grounds of the hotel have a very colonial feel and your transported back in time to the days when Kipling, Coward and other notables were around."
,,The past and the present mixed together,3.0,,The Raffles Hotel still exudes its charm even though it is now surrounded by modern shops. The shops are quite expensive.
,,Raffles Hotel - A must,5.0,,"Singapore must do - a Singapore Sling at Raffles Disappointed that we couldn't do this as the Long Bar as its been refurbished and not due to reopen until next year. Still the best hotel in the world. Gardens are well kept and great to sit in.

Got to have peanuts at the bar and a Singapore Sling. Yes its 31 Singapore dollars each but its a great drink and a great way to memory Raffles Hotel"
,,A must see - it is Raffles...,5.0,,This is where the Singapore Sling was invented. The cost is a staggering $30 per drink and the food isn't cheap either. Just keep that in mind if you are on a budget
,,Long Bar Being Refurbished,4.0,,Singapore must do - a Singapore Sling at Raffles Long Bar. So disappointed that we couldn't do this as the Long Bar is being refurbished and not due to reopen until next year. Still a lovely building to see though.
,,"The building is amazing, brings you back in time",5.0,,"A must do is to have the Singapore Sling at the famous Long bar. Deco is still as it was in 1920, and experience that will bring you back in time."
,,Get your wallet out.,3.0,,"No, I mean it, get your wallet out! There are some extremely nice, well thought out gifts in one of the souvenir shops in this hotel arcade. And countless beautiful shops to spend your money. So make sure you have your credit card at the ready ;-)"
,,"Great location,near to Raffles City,passing through en route to Australia",5.0,,"A lovely Colonial looking property, when sitting inside you feel that you have been transported back to the early days of Raffles. Is expensive, however when in in Singapore you have to try the Singapore Sling."
,,Disapointing,1.0,,I suppose it can't be helped but most of the arcade is shut down for renovation at the moment. There were lots of people there for afternoon tea. From what I remember from a visit a few years ago you will need very deep pockets for the type of shops that will be there.
,,A good walk around,4.0,,Not in our price range but we enjoyed walking around and doing a little shopping in the arcade. Worth including it in your tour of the city. And there is a Jim Thompson store.
,,A Beautiful piece of the past.,5.0,,"We were able to move around Raffles Hotel to take in the beauty of the building. The concierge allowed us (group of 6) the opportunity to just go inside to really feel the ambience of the place, then we walked around the outside of the building and thru the gardens. Lovely"
,,Must see,4.0,,"We were in Singapore in March we when to raffles for a Singapore slinging although most of the building its self fron the out side appeared closed for an upgrade inside was as every bit as amazing as expected
Although cocktail is expensive the pictures you get and the grounds are beautiful
A must do"
,,AFTERNOON TIFFIN - AN ABSOLUTE DELIGHT,5.0,,"We had pre-booked Afternoon Tiffin at Raffles - 3pm until 5pm - and are so glad that we did. It was a super experience. The ambience of the Hotel; professionalism and friendliness of the staff, and the quality of food, both hot and cold, enhanced the experience. There was such a huge selection of thoroughly delicious hot and cold dishes that, without over-indulging, we were sated for the rest of the day. If you don't do this while in Singapore, you are truly missing a treat."
,,have a coffee,4.0,,"Have a coffee, and feel yourself back in the colonial ages. very clean and exclusive place, and silent in the city."
,,Pricey but iconic,4.0,,"We went for sundowners and the wife supped a couple of cosmos, my daughter a non-alco job and I supped a large Tiger beer whilst we cracked open peanuts and played cards

Yes its still under reconstruction but it was still a lovely if expensive thing to do for while playing like the colonials..."
,,Overrated,3.0,,Went there for drinks and paid $25.00 for a singapore sling.. NOT worth it. Hotel under renovation. The real Long Bar closed.... Good for photos and wait for renovations to be finished
,,holiday,5.0,,great to come here and to have a singapore sling the world famous drink and the free bag of peanuts they give you . the building is old but it looks well for its age and try the shop .
,,A must visit!,5.0,,To go with the history of Singapore this is a mus. Although the long bar is currently under renovation you go into the billiards room. Still a great experience having a Singapore sling while eating monkey nuts and throwing the the shells onto the floor.
,,Iconic Singapore Hotel,4.0,,"This hotel is a historic one and is definitely picture-worthy. If you get the chance to go inside, make sure to try either the high tea or the Singapore Sling!"
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,Raffles was a lovely old Hotel and the Singapore Sling was delicious any one who goes there must try one.
,,You'll have to wait now.,3.0,,As part of the hotel restoration the Arcades is currently closed although one or two shops including the gift shop remains open during the restoration period.
,,Try the High Tea.,4.0,,"An iconic building, full of history and enchanting stories The high tea with champagne was stunning, a must see."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,Good access from our hotel to the arcade with lots of designer shops. Food hall was great with lots of variety. Arcades gave access to MRT and all was air conditioned.
,,The usual top end culprits,4.0,,"The Raffles Hotel Arcade was nearing closure for its massive upgrade but I still managed to stick my nose in.

From Rolex to Philippe Patek, you have a small smattering of luxury brands, that fill this small arcade, including its own Raffles branded outlet to cash in on the upmarket traffic. I get the feeling that this arcade is tagging onto the infamous Raffles and may once have been ""the"" place to find the designer labels. Nowadays, you can find more on offer in the basement of the Marina Bay Sands, but it is still nice to find a quiet hideaway like here.

If shopping is now your bent, then go to the infamous ""Long Bar"" for a Singapore Sling, but this too is closed for renovations now."
,,Must do!,5.0,,"As most every traveller to Singapore does, we just HAD to go to Raffles for a Singapore Sling ! Gorgeous old colonial building oozing with the charm and elegance of yesteryear and the days of the British Raj. It was like a step back in time.
Worth queuing up for- and the S$31 each!! An experience not to be missed when in Singapore ! Another tick on the 'bucket list'."
,,Slightly disappointing access to some areas due to refurbishments,3.0,,"This was one of the things that you should do when you got the chanvpce to go to this gfand old hotel. I remember spending time here a number of years ago.

This time I took my wife to enjoy the sights - whilst some of the shiops remain, a number were closed and the long bar and courtyard are both closed due to the ongoing refurbishment t of the hotel - so nit as. Uch fun as it used to be"
,,Must See,4.0,,"We're disappointed that the long bar was shut for renovation and we had to have the famous Singapore sling in the billiard room. The Singapore sling was really good but expensive but at least you got a bag of free monkey nuts. Historical place that you must visit when in Singapore.
The arcade was an interesting place to look around but again with expensive prices."
,,Must visit here,5.0,,Beautiful gardens . Must get some photo shots here Currently undergoing some refurbishment so the original Long Bar is closed Good shopping
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Raffles is having a refurbishment currently (early 2017) and so some of the more famous areas are not able to be visited. In any case, as a non resident you are quite limited in the areas you can visit anyhow. The frontage is still impressive with the costumed footman at the door but otherwise I thought it was a bit of a waste of time and certainly didn't feel like forking out for a Singapore Sling in the less than inviting surroundings."
,,Another iconic stop,4.0,,We visited the Raffles Hotel Arcade after having a Singapore Sling in the famous Long Bar at Raffles Hotel. Lots of Raffles branded goodies to buy and some high end brand names.
,,Iconic visit for a Singapore sling. When in Rome (or rather Singapore!),4.0,,"The long bar wasn't as decorative as I imagined. But a great atmosphere and enjoyed the traditional Singapore Sling and peanuts from a sack. A fun activity in a vibrant city. The hotel itself is impressive, the bar more authentic if a bit tired. Enjoyed and can say we have done it."
,,Holday,4.0,,Was nice to see. After having heard about it. Was very busy. Enjoyed Singapore sling. Good place to visit.
,,Disappointing after all the hype.,2.0,,We had heard so much about this place and yet while it is a great old building trying to get a drink or afternoon tea without booking or waiting in line for 30 minutes is impossible. If you haven't booked your afternoon tea don't even bother going.
,,Raffles hotel,5.0,,"Excellent setting, a must for afternoon tea. Great shopping in gift shop. Visit the long bar for a Singapore sling"
,,Not as good as it was,3.0,,I visited raffles in the sixties and again in 2012 and really enjoyed both visits so we returned last week and unfortunately it is not the same and as good value as it was
,,Raffles Is Now Closed,5.0,,We went to Raffles Hotel for a trip down memory lane only to find it all boarded up. It is having a two to three year refurbishment. I hope they don't spoil it in the process.
,,Holiday cruise,5.0,,"No-one should miss a visit to this iconic Hotel, not least to have a Singapore Sling! Beautiful surroundings, and if you don't fancy a drink, you can book afternoon tea."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"The hotel is amazing to have a look around, if you can't afford to stay!

I spent about an hour wandering around the hotel and the bar, and the lovely courtyard garden. I think, other than that, there isn't much to do.

Drinking a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar is lovely though it is extremely overpriced; you can get much cheaper but just as nice cocktails from nearby bars or on Marina Bay."
,,A must see,5.0,,M plus whatever taxy friend treated me to Singapore sling as I had just celebrated my 80th birthday. It cost 27 SD plus whatever tax. I first went to Raffles before it was refurbished and it was expensive then.
,,A Must!,5.0,,Definitely a must visit. Beautiful old hotel. A moment in history! Be sure to have a Singapore Sling in the Raffles bar.
,,Iconic attraction,4.0,,"You don't have to stay at Raffles Hotel to visit.

Whilst we did visit the Tiffin Room for afternoon tea (see separate review), we also visited the complex a few times as we were staying nearby.

The two obvious attractions are the Long Bar and Tiffin Room. Interestingly our Singapore Sling was $5 cheaper with the afternoon tea, than if purchased in the bar. The other go to area is the gift shop.

The gift shop sells high end merchandise, quality at a cost. No tacky 'I've been to Raffles T-Shirts here!' Nice to browse, even if not buying.

A small café/bakery is situated at the foot of the steps to the Long bar (which is on the first floor).

Not a great lot to keep you here other than a browse of the shops and a few photos, but you can't go to Singapore and not step inside Raffles

."
,,Historic venue,5.0,,We were passing through not staying here and we stopped for a quick gin sling and to immerse ourselves in the history of the place
,,Must have a look on Singapore history and tradition,4.0,,Coming from the seafront and Merlion Raffles is on the way. From the street you have a great view on the building and you can get some information about history. And maybe spot some VIPs just entering the hotel. Elton John was there in february.
,,Now thats pricey!!!,5.0,,"This ranks as one of the most famous hotels in the world-and they know it, staff are attentive, but it is expensive, virgin sling is $14,00. But it is worth it just to experience even for a little bit. There is an overpriced gift shop for your friends who really need an ashtray"
,,raffles,4.0,,just visited the outside looked very aunthenic to what I have seen in photos the gardens were well kept
,,Raffles Hotel Arcade,5.0,,"As many of you may be aware Raffles Hotel has just begun its careful Restoration work over the next 12 months and the Shopping Arcade, which I may add is excellent has sadly closed until the Spring of 2018 with the exception of the Raffles Hotel shop which is excellent , with a wonderful selection of small gifts for the family and friends."
,,Fab!,5.0,,We had afternoon tea here in the Tiffin Room and was an incredible experience. I loved every minute! Also had a seat at the Long Bar and enjoyed the famous Singapore sling. Ridiculously expensive but you just have to sample it. Throwing your peanut shells on the floor too is fun and traditional. Really beautiful hotel and gardens. Souvenirs expensive as you would expect.
,,Iconic,4.0,,When in Singapore you must visit Raffles. Other than the bars and afternoon in the Tiffin room there are shops and gardens to browse around.
,,Raffles Arcade,5.0,,"Very interesting place to visit and walk around, although it can be very expensive for souvenir shopping."
,,Nice,3.0,,"This is a nice Hotel, but I would not bother visiting if I was short on time. There are a lot of other places which are much nicer."
,,Wow,5.0,,"A real must see and do. The history, the atmosphere and the best cup of tea I have ever had (I'm a coffee drinker). On local advice ask for your Singapore Sling to be made fresh in front of you ... It is expensive but a must do"
,,A must do (even at those prices)!!,4.0,,Every one just has to go in and sit in the Long Bar and pay those crazy prices for a Singapore Sling. (even if it's just so you can throw your nut cases on the floor)
,,Refurbishment,4.0,,"Our wives spent the day at the spa. We met them for singapore slings after. Lots of the palce is under refurbishment, so the arcade was not fully open. Just the gift shop nothing else.
Its a beautiful building, once refurbished i would love to re visit and explore it fully"
,,A must when you go to Singapore,4.0,,Nice to go and have a Ginn Tonic. Gives the old feeling. Relaxing. The Raffles bar is famous for its Singapore Sling
,,Disappointing,1.0,,"If you are going to Singapore in the near future, a warning: The Raffles hotel is not fully open. We did not know. The only thing you can do is go to the overpriced gift shop and have a drink at in the club room. Forget the famous bar, etc. They do serve tea. If that is your thing, make a reservation before you go. It is very popular. We asked for the same day and were told the earliest they had was a week away."
,,Icon and must see if only for pictures,5.0,,"The origin of the famous Singapore Sling cocktail and a lovely old Colonial building. We visited the shop to buy some souvenirs, the shop is not cheap for many things but you can buy the Singapore cocktails in to consume once home or share with others.

We also dined here and it was lovely, although the service was a bit slow, the staff were pleasant and friendly and the food was great."
,,No trip to Singapore complete without visit to Raffles,5.0,,Great Old Colonial Hotel steeped in tradition. It is customary to make a visit to the famous old Long Bar for a Singapore Sling. One can get either alcholic or non. This will give you a feel for the old Singapore.
,,timeless shopping in singapore,5.0,,the raffles arcade shopping centre in Singapore is a haven for some of the finest shopping in Singapore. from custom made and bespoke shirts and suits to pastries and designer watches. this is a mecca for fine shopping
,,IT'S RAFFLES COME ON,5.0,,Thou we missed the Long Bar due to renovations it is a beautiful place to visit. Expensive but who can say no to a Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel. Even the time honoured tradditional doormen have no problem getting in a photo
,,time for Singapore Sling,5.0,,for sure if you are in Singapore this place must be visited! this is where famous cocktail Singapore Sling was invented and this is the place where it tastes the best!
,,Must see,5.0,,Lots of people were in the Long Bar but not so many walking around the arcade and in the hotel grounds.
,,GREAT ARCADE !,5.0,,"Great arcade to wonder around. Enjoyed wondering the shops, different ones with different things in them. A nice leisurely walk around suited us just fine."
,,Lovely shops,5.0,,The shops here are beautiful and very stylish but quite expensive. They are laid out around the courtyard of the hotel. I particularly liked the Jim Thompson shop. There's a fair bit of walking involved.
,,Must do,5.0,,Being in Singapore you feel this is a must. Loved the colonial building and was nice to sit in the court yard. The long bar is currently shut for renovation so the Singapore sling is served in another bar. Bag of nuts supplied with a...More
,,Great history,3.0,,"Visited for a second time, the first being a few years ago. One visit is possibly enough. Singapore sling is overpriced. Appeared to be made in bulk at bar. Bit disappointing. Really expected at $31 a drink to have each made and mixed fresh for...More"
,,Beautiful building - don't miss out on a Singapore Sling,4.0,,The Raffles hotel/arcade building is really worth a visit - it is very beautiful and you can just sense the history the place still holds. Walk up the impressive drive way and turn left down the outdoor hallways along to the long bar for a...More
,,Much more than the sling,5.0,,The history and architecture make this place a must see. Yes the Singapore sling too but just being in the hotel and wandering brings you back to a small snippet of what the colonial Era was like. Definitely get a sling as well but be...More
,,No Tiger,5.0,,I missed the tiger under the billiards table but got the Sinapore sling. A memorable visit to this icon. Lovely and little changed in years to the outsider in terms of service quality and presentation. Enjoyed it very much.
,,Raffles is Raffles I suppose!,3.0,,The building looks so colonial and is eye catching. As you wander through the cloisters you get a feeling of old empire days gone by. Got seated at a table in main bar after about 10 mins. Ordered the Gin Slings x4 .cost about £80...More
,,A taste of Old Singapore,4.0,,In stark contrast to the flashy Marina Bay area Raffles harks back to a different time. Lovely and fun to wander through as a counterpoint to the pace of today.
,,Very Expensive,3.0,,Had a drink in the upstairs bar where the Singapore Sling was invented and it cost us over $72.00 Singapore Dollars for 2 drinks and the Singapore Dollars is about 8cents less than the Canadian Dollar. That included the tip thank goodness. Asked if it included the glass that it came in and was told no that I could buy it in the gift shop downstairs. Went to check it out and sure enough there were 2 to choose from one at $22.99 and the other at $24.99. I have to say the drink was incredibly good but for that price would not expect anything else.
,,One of the Must See places in Singapore,4.0,,"It is over 50 years since I first went to Singapore, in those days Raffles was the haunt of the very rich and the very well connected! It was then primarily the hotel that was famous. The changes over the years have been both good and not so good. Moving the Long Bar upstairs was a bad idea, it lost the character of the original Long Bar. The expansion of the Arcade has been in thr main good. There is more to see and do."
,,It an expensive must do,3.0,,"We went to the Long Bar as its iconic and also to video the grounds where our friends married 22 years ago (no vids then).
Staff were quite friendly. Service quick and clientele all tourists. Singapore Slings were heavenly but at equivalent of £22 each were possibly the most expensive average cocktails anywhere including Dubai, London and New York. Even the cocktails at Sky Bar at the Burj Al Arab are not that expensive. Tables have bags of monkey nuts on them. You are supposed to toss the shells on the floor. I couldn't bring myself to do that but hubby enjoyed hurling them in all directions including over me.
We had a fun half hour then were allowed to wander around outside and film where our friends were married. Its a fun tourist trap. Once done never to be repeated."
,,Afternoon tea delight,5.0,,"A must for all visitors to Singapore, a haven in the midst of a busy city. Everything I expected and more, recommend a drink in the gardens."
,,A piece of histroy,5.0,,The arcade at the Raffles is free to wander with plenty of Raffles shops for Raffles tourist gifts. You are still able to see the beautiful courtyards and buildings although we did not try to go into the main lobby or try a Singapore sling it was still nice to to visit.
,,You have to go!,4.0,,"A trip to Singapore requires a visit to this historic hotel. Everybody has to go to the Long Bar for the famous Singapore Sling. (I had a fine single malt whiskey while the women had slings. Not bad bar food either, free nuts on the table. They have a steak house which we did not have time for."
,,"Fabulous place, a must-see.",5.0,,"By far one of the main highlights of our stay in Singapore, Afternoon Tea in the Fiffin Room, wow, what an awesome experience, have fabulous memories of it."
,,EXPENSIVE DRINKS,5.0,,"Expensive drinks,,,but still worth a visit,,,the building is amazing, so much history and culture,,we had the famous Singapore sling here,,2 each so 4 in total...150 dollars.....But you get free nuts with it lol...."
,,Colonial charm in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"Lovely architecture and charming experience walking the grounds. A little touristy but go to the long bar for a drink (i personally hate the sickly tasting singapore sling, have something else). notice the details with the fans in the ceiling and have fun with the peanuts! The arcade shop is worth checking out. A little pricey but still a nice place to get a momento."
,,Expensive but a must do.,4.0,,"When we arrived at the front of Raffles it seemed to us a little intimidating as it appeared the place was for residents only. A board outside said that the bars were not open yet when we arrived. We walked past the conciege and the just strolled around the place, like many other tourists. The bars and tea rooms were all open to non residents. Our order was a gin sling, a bottle of beer and a plate of nachos - $81. But It was worth it"
,,Before or after the Long Bar,5.0,,"Must go to the arcade and feel like you are part of this fabulous hotel. The Raffles gift shop has everything to remind you of your visit - Singapore Sling glasses, recipes and pre mix are a must."
,,The myth still alive !,4.0,,Beautiful and peaceful place for a drink in the heart of the city (in the courtyard). The myth is still alive. Relaxing and peaceful atmosphere. The only drawback is the high price of the drinks and the food is far from being fabulous
,,Playing on its name,3.0,,"Expensive high end shopping, loved by a certain type of person, a place to be seen shopping rather than achieving good value."
,,Afternoon tea and a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar after,3.0,,"We booked Raffles for afternoon tea as a thing you have to do when visiting Singapore for the first time. Delightful décor but help yourself buffet part of the process, not quite what I expected. Only one choice of tea offered, service disappointing, expensive for what it is, wouldn't repeat or recommend. Brightened the spirits however with a visit to the Long Bar for a traditional Singapore Sling or two. We both enjoyed this and would recommend."
,,Afternoon tea & Singapore sling,5.0,,"Although expensive afternoon tea followed by a Singapore sling have to be sampled. The afternoon tea is everything you want it to be with fantastic food of all different types with limit on the amount you can sample, fantastic service from very smartly dressed staff who are also very attentive to your needs.
After tea is finished its off to the long bar for a Singapore sling to round things off.
I know it's not a cheap afternoon out but in my opinion it was worth it. If we were to visit Singapore again we would once again visit Raffles if just for the afternoon tea"
,,My Singapore Sling,5.0,,My one wish in visiting Singapore was to have a Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel. Well worth the visit!
,,"Heritage past, Asia present",4.0,,"The original Raffles retains its colonial splendour and, for some, shame. However, the restoration is a piece of perfection and today it is local families who can enjoy the sumptuous setting for their own occasions and making their own history"
,,Disappointing,2.0,,Raffles Hotel appears to have become a bit of a white elephant. Their gift shop was open and the cafe but most of the shops are closed and there is absolutely no atmosphere at Raffles anymore which is such a shame.
,,beautiful historical hotel,4.0,,"This is one of the oldest hotels in Singapore and survived WWII intact. The 'Singapore Sling"" was created her..and while a bit sweet for me, the bartenders have created about a dozen spinoffs. The best spot for a drink is the central courtyard as the dress code is not as strict as the Long Bar. Lovely garden surrondings and a great place to enjoy a taste of Singapore"
,,A must do but be prepared to pay a hefty bill at the end.,5.0,,"This is a must visit place if you are visiting Singapore. Most people will try the Singapore Sling which is what Raffles is most famous for. We had 3 singapore slings a pint of Guiness, a glass of white wine and a bottle of water. The bill came to 200 Singapore Dollars. We knew it would we had budgeted for it and were happy to pay this much. Not every one would feel the same way I agree but it was worth it for us."
,,Singapore sling visit,3.0,,Overpriced and overrated but everyone does it! No q the day we visited $76 for two gins Courtyard very pleasant Shops up market
,,A taste of colonial charm,5.0,,"I had always wanted to visit Raffles hotel since seeing my father's wartime photos. It was just as I'd imagined.
We visited the Long Bar and indulged in a Singapore Sling. This was, after all, where it was invented. The barman said that there are about 800 of these cocktails served each day! At $31 a shot, and with added tax and service charge, they are on to a winner!
It was a once in a lifetime experience and had to be done!
The traditional Seikh doorman was very friendly and didn't mind posing for a photo with me!"
,,don't bother,3.0,,this arcade is overdone with raffles souvenirs and is in desperate need of a makeover. very disappointing place to visit. souvenirs are overpriced and limited
,,Fantastic piece of history,5.0,,This was amazing but very very busy. The staff were lovely and very friendly. We went to the bar and had the traditional Singapore Sling and nuts and it was amazing so much fun and definately one to tick off the bucket list.
,,Beautiful old building.,4.0,,The building is beautiful and historically significant-- but you can't go in the lobby if you aren't staying there. However the courtyard and the shops to the left of the entrance are open to the public.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Love this place hence visiting every time I'm in Singapore. The band is fantastic and make you feel very welcome. They never forget a face. Besides you have come here just to have a Singapore sling and throw peanut shells on the floor! A must see/do on the tourist list. If you can stay for an excellent meal with real service.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"Although expensive, it's a must see fun to place to see. The Raffles shop has all sorts of things to browse or buy. Some great signage to keep you amused"
,,Raffles Hotel and Courtyard,4.0,,"Great place to visit, full of history, great photos from the past and quality food and drinks. Easy to get to by MRT. Good bars, inside and out."
,,Singapore sling,3.0,,"Had to pay a visit to this place to try the famous Singapore sling.
We left a little disappointed the cocktail was mass produced and pre made and it was pored out of a jug.
A pricy place to visit but one of the venues on the tick list to visit"
,,Expensive but worth it,5.0,,Popped into the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling - overpriced but it was a good atmosphere and very nice buildings
,,It's just an old hotel.,3.0,,"If you're into history you might like to see the Raffles Hotel. My husband wanted to go there, but it didn't do anything for my kids or myself."
,,Loved the ambience of the Raffles Hotel complex,5.0,,We visited this on several occasions. One of the highlights of our visit was afternoon tea in Raffles Hotel. Also had lunch in the pizzeria which was reasonably priced.
,,Over-rated and expensive,3.0,,"I have to say I am pleased we went but its done now and I wouldn't bother again. People actually queue to have a drink in Raffles Bar, but one look at the prices and most people walk straight back out. We did stop for one drink (a cocktail $30) so at least we can say we've been."
,,A beatiful building from a by gone area.,5.0,,A must see place where you can see how the British cololnialism helped shape Singapore's history and what it has become today.
,,Lovely,4.0,,Heard a lot about the Arcade and decided to visit. Wasn't disappointed. Good for a relaxing evening out.
,,A great historial place,5.0,,"As with everything in Singapore, Raffles is expensive. Only the very wealthy stay here. Tourists, well they just go for a look and walk around and sometimes have a drink at the Long Bar. But be prepared. Drinks here are expensive. $84 SGB for 4 drinks and 2 were just beers. But ie is worth the experience"
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,"Although expensive, the Singapore Sling was developed at Long Bar in Raffles Hotel. You can consider trying it here, it was $31 SGD + Tax and Service charge. The area itself is very nice as well!"
,,overrated,1.0,,"My wife and I went here because of the historic significance of the hotel and especially its' bar. Please note that we did NOT stay here, we chose instead the Mandarin hotel. The bar itself is located far back in the hotel grounds and has apparently been relocated several times though the years. So much for historical significance. The bar itself was interesting and did have a historic, colonial feel about it.We avoided ordering the FAMOUS SINGAPORE SLING based on TripAdvisor reviews and chose instead a couple of Martinis. Service was slow and unfriendly but the drinks were fine. Peanuts are complimentary, but the price for two drinks was 85 Singapore dollars or about US$60. All in all a ho-hum experience."
,,Raffles,3.0,,This is my second trip to Singapore and my husbands first so yes you have a wonder round Raffles they seemed to be having a major sort out i think they are having a make over so for me this time didn't have the wow factor
,,Living History,5.0,,A beautiful hotel that should not be missed. It oozes history and a visit to the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling should not be missed
,,Came to have the mandatory Singapore Sling...,4.0,,With Raffles and the history of Singapore being indelibly linked it seemed a shame not to head to raffles and try to get a feel for the past....we were not disappointed the bar is old world wood and the floor is covered with peanut shells with free flowing nuts in the shell on all tables....the Slings are not cheap nut are the really McCoy and now we can say been there done that...going to Raffles is like going to the top of the hill in Hong Kong...something you have to do once...
,,Shopping centre in Raffles hotel,4.0,,"Nice range of shops and restaurants. Pleasant even for window shopping . Situated in the iconic Raffles hotel with interesting architecture, sheltered verandas."
,,had to be done,5.0,,"Sitting in the sun , enjoying a Singapore Sling or 2 Imagining I am in days gone past and part of Historical Singapore. Would love to stay here but budget will not allow"
,,High tea and then Long bar,5.0,,"Can highly recommend the High Tea in the Tiffin Room. The tea was Devine while listening to the beautiful Harp being played. The three tiered stand of sandwiches and cakes lovely. Was not overly impressed with the scones, though the hot pastries were fabulous.
Retired after the relaxing High Tea to the Long bar to enjoy the infamous Singapore Sling. The bags of peanuts were interesting."
,,the Singapore Sling original - delicious,5.0,,"you have to have one this drink is a long drink over a long time and the peanuts - can't believe it is ok to throw the shells on the floor but it is encouraged. had to wait to get in to the long bar but not too long a wait we ordered 2 singapore slings and it took us over 1/2hr to drink them - very strong, sweet and very delicious - you couldn't drink too but well worth the price"
,,A must do,5.0,,"You must visit Raffles and have afternoon tea. Also visit the Long Bar and drink a Singapore Sling. Don't forget to trow you peanut shells on the floor, its tradition."
,,When in Rome !!- A singapore Sling is a must,5.0,,Any trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to the Raffles - we like the peanut bar where you shell peanuts and drop the shells all over the floor while sipping an overpriced Singapore sling. ( just one- for fun)
,,High Tea with the family was highlight of our trip,5.0,,"High Tea at Raffles Hotel was a wonderful experience, its pricy but this could be a once in a lifetime experience for most people, so worth a ' big spender' moment. I couldn't fault this experience. 3 of our guests had specific dietary requirements, gluten allergy, vegan and vegetarian, all had a great experience too, we were lucky enough to have private dining, which made us all feel even more special. It felt like a step back in time. As it was Christmas we were treated to a choir singing, which was the cherry on top. A truly magical experience."
,,Classic hotel,4.0,,"So we went to the Raffles Hotel, had a Singapore sling and ate peanuts. Fun to have done this must-do while visiting Singapore, but expensive. There was a queue when we arrived, but we very quickly seated and served."
,,Photo opportunity!!,5.0,,"What visit to Singapore would be complete without a photo at the front of Raffles - steeped in history and frequented by literary giants from the past. Built by the Saki Brothers after the success of their E&O in Penanang. I remember it fondly prior to its glamorous renovations and even stayed their on occaisions as airline crew many years ago. There is no doubt it has been greatly improved by the work done but it also, quite strangely, looses some its charm in that process. Nonetheless a must visit!"
,,A Fitting Finale to a Grand Tour,5.0,,"High Tea at Raffles was on my Bucket List and with great excitement we went there as the finale to a wonderful trip to India and Singapore. Raffles was all I had imagined and then some - such a pleasure to be there, and particularly as it was close to Xmas and the decorations gave added colour and beauty to this grand hotel."
,,Nice to wonder round the hotel,4.0,,"Almost a rite of path when in Singapore. Yes, it's full of tourists, yes it's really really expensive, but it was fun. Prices are ++ ( plus tax and service) on what is advertised, so in total it was almost equivalent of 20 GBP for one cocktail. You do get a bag of money nuts and it is encouraged to throw the shells on the floor, once you get used to doing it ( years of being taught not to throw things on the floor), it was quite fun. And the monkey nuts were tasty along with the Singapore sling and summer sling cocktails!"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,The arcade and hotel are due to be closed soon for refurbishment. The hotel itself was lovely but because of the closure of the arcade lots of the shops were empty. Raffles own shop was good if expensive with lots of choice of things to purchase. No doubt when all the shops are again open it will have a better atmosphere.
,,Beautiful and Historic Building,4.0,,This is a colonial building architecture. It is very beautiful and histotic place. A bit crowded in the afternoon and the drink price was above average.
,,Beautiful Rip Off,2.0,,"The building to be sure is really lovely, but to charge $31 in the Long Bar for 1 Singapore Sling is what I call consumer abuse, just because you can Raffles doesnt mean you should.
A fair price might have had us staying and spending more.
Also the gift shop did make complete strangers burst out laughing together at the prices."
,,Visit,4.0,,Can't come to Singapore with out a visit to Raffles even if it's just for a walk around drinks in the Long bar were 30 min wait to get in and then a small mortgage to buy one but has to be done .
,,Very historic place and cocktailbars,5.0,,"Okay, have to admit that the original Singapore Sling was most expensive cocktail I've ever bought. NYC was now competed. Of course this ""Sling"" experience included walking around the hotel block sized hotel arcade and the bar itself was something you see only in the movies nowadays. Very crowded already afternoon but fast service. Worth to stop By if not with a tight budget."
,,Attractive Alternative to Nearby Malls,5.0,,"Set on the grounds of the historic Raffles Hotel, the arcade offers a pleasant open air covered walkway featuring a number of first class Restaurants and cafes. There's a Jim Thompson shop, a Tiffany's shops featuring the finest watches ( E.g. Rolex, Breuget, Patek Philippe, etc), Leica cameras, and Raffles Hotels own gift shop filled with Raffles hotels memorabilia). Ah Teng bakery is also here along with a few antique shops. Even if you aren't shopping, it's a very pretty stroll -- with beautiful garden spots to one side of the arcade and places to sit and drink in a very special ambiance."
,,A Singapore Sling at Raffles is a must,5.0,,"While it is probably up there with one of the most expensive cocktails we have had, you can't miss having a Singapore sling at Raffles Hotel."
,,old meets new,4.0,,"They have done well to keep the shop fronts in keeping with the rest of the hotel.
The shops are high end and very expensive, good for a spot of window shopping but the same products are available else where,
Raffles do have a gift shop here and have some nice items for gifts.
Do take a look around even if you go for the experience."
,,Interesting from a historical perspective,5.0,,"We only visited the famed ""Long Bar"" where the Singapore Sling was invented. We had to wait about 10 minutes to enter (we were there about 6pm), but we got to sit at the Long Bar (instead of a table) and drank a Singapore Sling. Worth a visit just to see this beautiful colonial building."
,,Very posh!,4.0,,Posh shops (charging posh prices) in the tranquil setting of the inner wards of the Raffles Hotel. You could spend an hour in the gift shop buying souvenirs if the designer label shops and restaurants are too much for you. Don't forget to visit the Long Bar too
,,Very good,4.0,,"look, the building is a stunning piece of history, but if you feel that you want to have a Singapore Sling in the long room. Be prepared to be ruthlessly ripped off"
,,Exceeded expectations,5.0,,"We were expecting a tired looking colonial building but the hotel has been beautifully renovated and the whole building looks in great condition.
We had the mandatory visit to the Long Bar and had our Singapore Slings which were expensive but worth it! All the staff that we met were friendly and helpful. There is also an excellent selection of shops within the building."
,,Pretty but not worth it...,2.0,,"The hotel grounds are very pretty, but overall just not worth your time. The Singapore Sling was very sugary and overrated. Other cocktails were also just okay.. especially considering we spent $200 on 4 cocktails. I had a glass of champagne that tasted like it had been opened the day before and sitting outside.. for $40/glass. I asked for a fresh glass but was denied. Say whaaaaat? Raffles, you're pretty but not thaaaaat pretty.."
,,Snooker and a Singapore sling,5.0,,"We felt really welcomed at the hotel even though we showed up in trainers shorts and jeans. It was perfect as we played a game of snooker, and had a Singapore sling. The hotel wasn't crowed at all and the staff were very friendly.

If you are Singapore just go to get a photo or walk around as its completely free!! (If you don't buy a drink)"
,,Its just a must do,5.0,,An iconic hotel with oodles od history and character. The staff are just awesome and the location unbeatable.
,,Singapore sling,5.0,,This building is a reflection of a bygone era beautiful hotel and everyone said you have to go to the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling which we did lovely bar not to sure about the drink and very costly 72 singapore dollars for 2 drinks sorry not worth it
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,Well its one of the must do in Singapore I guess so visited this place for went to the Long bar for afternoon tea and Sling
,,Great Place to Visit,5.0,,"I went to Singapore on business in June 2016. The Raffles Hotel is world famous. You can reach it via the Raffles City MRT stop and then walking through Raffles City to the correct exit. The Raffles Hotel Arcade of shops is very nice, especially the shop which sells Raffles Hotel merchandise. On my first visit to Singapore in November 2008, I went to the Long Bar and had a Singapore Sling. I think that experience is overrated and overpriced so I would consider skipping that."
,,A Must See in Singapore,4.0,,"Only did outside so I could see the hotel. Actually, it is the only place ever knew of in
Singapore.Very classic Brit construction. Do this review for information. Hotel begins refurbishing in February 2017, so reservation availability will be less. Not sure end date, but Singapore is planning some ""To - Do"" for 50th Anniversary being it's own Nation. Another is that if you would want to eat dinner there, a reservation in advance is needed. Could not get in on two nights. One caution is expensive. Costs are greater than in neighboring Malaysia."
,,First timers must,5.0,,A gorgeous setting with fast service. Beautiful hotel with awesome drinks-a little expensive and sometimes very crowded but a must see for your first trip to beautiful Singapore!
,,a nice place to have a drink.,5.0,,"The historical Long Bar in the Raffles hotel is a relaxing place to have a drink, but, as expected drinks are expensive. A Singapore sling starts at $31 a glass and a local beer at $16"
,,A Must Visit!,5.0,,Lovely architecture! A must see is the Long Bar and try a Singapore Sling if you can afford it - £30!!!
,,You Just Have to do It,4.0,,It is a must do experience. The Singapore Slings are expensive at 72 dollars including service charge but hey you just have to do it. The band playing on the night was brilliant.
,,very nice,4.0,,WE called in here for a Singapore Sling as i thought... ended up with a beer as the price of drinks were so expensive. The hotel is very nice and has lovely gardens. The beer gardens were very relaxing. Would definately recommend a visit
,,You have to say you have been here....,4.0,,"We went to Raffles to take the required photo and wander around the gift shop and area. We did not do the Singapore Sling bar because the cost is an issue. Been there, seen it, job done."
,,Probably the most recognised by western tourists,3.0,,Worth a visit for the history and to have a look but if your dropping in for the famous Singapore sling its not all its cracked up to be and so overpriced its not funny must be a 5000% markup
,,Nostalgia not to be missed.,4.0,,"Whenever I visit Singapore, I pay the Long Bar a visit. Its changed/moved since my first visit, but its still lovely to visit the building. We had a rude and irritable waitress but after a couple of Singapore Slings, we couldn't care less! She just wasn't going to get a tip from us! Lovely atmosphere there. Happy patrons. A must visit, every time, in spite of the staff."
,,Superb building. A must see,4.0,,Also a little lost in a middle of modern buildings surrounding it . It has not lost all its charm and is an impressive building . Walk the archway to reach the courtyard and up to the long bar
,,Raffles,4.0,,Not the pre war Raffles as most including the Long Bar have been moved over time. Tiffin Rest.t still in same place. Singapore Sling OK but ask for one to be made up in front of you.
,,A taste of the Old,4.0,,This arcade offers the visitor a glimpse of what the old Singapore hotels are like. A pleasure to walk around in with all the little shops inside. Prices in these shops aren't the cheap - but you can always get a Raffle Hotel umbrella for $30.00 .
,,A lovely building,5.0,,We enjoyed our time visiting the arcade. and the hotel amazing to think it has been there so long when you see all the new hotels around
,,We stayed at the Carlton Hotel next door but always go to Raffles to experience the Long Bar.,4.0,,"I recommend that when visiting Singapore, you take time to visit the Long Bar at Raffles, it is a unique experience, stepping back in time to the Colonial days. Enjoy a point of the best or the house Singapore Sling as only they can make it. The basin of peanuts on the tables with shells underfoot is novel as is the topping up from a sack!!"
,,part of a tour visit,4.0,,"We visited Raffles, The Long Bar in particular, as part of a Singapore by Night tour. It was quite an experience. The music from the live band was excellent. We spent an hour or so there before leaving. We didn't have a Singapore Sling as it cost $72, just too much."
,,A glimpse of the past!,4.0,,"The beautiful old Colonial building is well maintained and allows you to imagine what life was like in Singapore a century ago. If you get a chance, stop for a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar."
,,Great Arcade has everything,5.0,,We stayed at Swissotel the Stamford in Singapore and it is attached to the Raffles Hotel Arcade so you dont need to go far for shopping you just walk through and you are there it has everything from Brand name shopping to a local food hall on one of its levels we ate at the local food hall a couple of time it was great and so cheap and interesting place to visit.
,,"Great shopping ,",5.0,,Raffles Arcade has great shopping and Great restaurants . Such a big place . Staff are very helpful and they see you get into a taxi ok.
,,No visit Singapore is complete without a visit to Raffles,5.0,,"surrounded by busy roads and tall buildings Raffles hotel is an oasis of calm. Staffing within the walls of this hotel is like stepping into a different world it's a good examples of poor and no visit to Raffles would be complete without a Singapore sling in the long bar, and the chance to throw your peni and the chance to throw your peanut shells on the bar floor. The shop is worth a visit but it's not pocket money prices. I was happy to sit and watch people go by and just take a step out from the busy world."
,,Gotta sling it,5.0,,"This hotel is everything you have read or heard...a grand old beauty and yes you really must have a Singapore Sling in the bar....just keep in mind that while the bar is casual, you are not allowed into the hotel or its upscale restaurants in anything less than business casual. This hotel provides a real glimpse into the world of British colonialism!"
,,Raffles,4.0,,"Beautiful historic building and grounds.
I followed my Dad's advise to go there for a Singapore Sling, which is a drink that originated at Raffles. This was a 31 Singapore dollar Drink, but probably worth the expenditure to try it and be able to say you did it. Raffles rooms were going for over 2k a night when I was there so I opted for other lodging, but was happy to explore this historic hotel."
,,Singapore Sling,3.0,,Went for a visit during our stay in Singapore. $163 for a round of Singapore Slings which is even well over the top but has to be done....Cheers
,,Definite historical visit you should see,4.0,,Home of the famous Singapore sling and icon bar. If you stop to have a drink be aware it will come at a very hefty price to say you had a sling at Raffles. I got on a night tour that included a video sot to the bar and a drink. Less expensive this way
,,"Historic, Raffles Hotel",3.0,,The Raffles Hotel shopping arcade is full of interesting designer stores and gift shops. Stop in at the Hotel for a traditional Singapore Sling and sit amongst the tropical garden surrounds.
,,Raffles in its Glory Days,4.0,,A walk around the quadrangle at Raffles brings out many surprises as to how many shops there are hidden away. it is worth exploring but not in the evening as many are closed
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Wow - what an amazing place to visit. Of course you have to have one of their famous ""Singapore Slings"" but make sure that you are ready for a surprise when you get the bill. $72.95 for 2 drinks."
,,"Fascinating, brings you back to past",4.0,,"IT is really fascinating to see how was the architecture in the past, brought from one side of the world to the other. You can recall British spirit and mood but in an environment and among a nature of a kind so far away from England that looks quite impossible. It is allowed to walk in the gardens, in the patios and take pictures freely, and it's quite strange to see so few people there. It can happen you are the only person around and can start to dream to have been send back to past .. Very delightful"
,,A must visit,5.0,,Cannot go past the historical Raffles Hotel. It still has the grand feeling of yesteryear. Sit in the Long Bar and have a Singapore Sling. Very overpriced but a must do!
,,Singapore sling,3.0,,Beautiful hotel. Drinks mega expensive. Great one time visit for the Singapore sling. The bar was beautiful seating is limited so before 5 you have a chance of getting a seat.
,,Pricey Experience,3.0,,"The home of the Singapore Sling! Had to have one drink at the bar that invented it in 1915. Thought it might be a little pricey, but did not expect $36 Singapore Dollars each, without the souvenir glass."
,,Singapore Sling is a must,5.0,,"You simply cannot go to Singapore without visiting the world famous Raffles and tasting a Singapore Sling, even if it does cost €31 - outrageous price but how many times do you get the chance to do it!! If you think that the hotel is what you see in the photo then think again, the place is huge, but the area you are looking for is the Long Bar. Dont be surprised by the husks from monkey nuts on the floor either"
,,Lovely old hotel,4.0,,Large old hotel with the long bar on the first floor where there is a live group singing popular songs and where of course you can partake in the traditional Singapore Sling.
,,Adsorb the atmosphere of Singapore both modern and historic,5.0,,"This is a great place to capture the atmosphere of modern Singapore and understand how it has developed over the years, you can also understand how the city stare has developed around the river and see many key old and new buildings."
,,Tourist trap,2.0,,"Raffles Hotels own shop is overpriced and just trades off the 'marque'. Other shops are just upmarket boutiques - Rolex, Jewelers etc. Give it a miss"
,,SIngapore sling,5.0,,One of the must do's and the long bar did not disappoint. Lovely bar and fantastic service by very gracious staff. Decided against the high tea in the afternoon simply down to cost ($72 per person)...grab a singapore sling instead
,,Sling yourself into here,5.0,,"If you want to see a bit of historical elegance just visit this arcade - not just the Long Bar. It is a beautifully constructed and elegant (as well as cool) arcade with some unique shops (too expensive for us), gardens.

The Long Bar? A chance to experience that times-gone-by ambience (lots of wood, the fans gently swaying on the ceiling - now mechanically driven) - and of course, the famous Singapore Sling (and other cocktails). Yes - it's pricey but you may only be here once."
,,Raffles,3.0,,"We arrived at Raffles by taxi as it was raining. The lovely concierge dressed in his Indian outfit from the Raj era opened the taxi door and escorted me in under his umbrella even tho I was just going to have a look and not staying there. Then he went and escorted my husband in. I asked him if it was possible to have my photo taken with him and he happily obliged.
It was lovely seeing how the colonial Britains lived in oppulance.Nowadays it lives on its colonial past and has expensive shops in the arcade."
,,Home of the Singapore Sling,5.0,,Besides being a beautiful building in a great area it is home to the famous Singapore sling. You need to just try one to realize how good it is. Great atmosphere a little pricey but I've seem worse.
,,Trip of a life time,5.0,,"Immersed in history you can imagine what is was like in bygone years opulent and indulgent ! Pricy but worth every penny treat yourself to afternoon tea dress to impress and sit back in another era .service second to non food out of this world do not eat anything else before had to ensure you get your money's worth .There are savouries to start sandwiches hot courses .fresh fruit .cakes all shapes and sizes ,deserts and continual tea or coffee served on silver plates ,as you finish one plate it is removed and you help yourself to the next .Must do book well in advance as it gets very busy and you could be disappointed and turned away at door .Something you will remember for the rest of your life"
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,We had the traditional Singapore Sling at the Raffles Bar which suprisingly wasn't too overpriced. This is iconic after all and you're there for the atmosphere. Food wasn't bad either ;)
,,A wonderful relict of the colonial era,5.0,,"A symbol of the colonial luxury, a huge hotel complex, Fine dining, a drink in The bar - it completes the atmosphere. The accommodation does not correspond with my budget, but it is the place in Singapore which we should visit."
,,The history of Raffles,5.0,,"You can't be in Singapore without a visit to Raffles opened by the founder of Singapore and used in a number of films.
Visit the bar for the famous Singapore Sling, you may have to que but it's worth the wait. Take time to explore the building on the top floor are lovely painted murals on the outside walls, there are shops set within the hotel however these are very expensive but lovely to see."
,,Bean,5.0,,Awesome place Well worth the trip even the cost of the famous Singapore sling was worth it A must visit !!!!!
,,When in Singapore you MUST visit Raffles Hotel!,5.0,,"We visited Raffles Hotel on our last day in Singapore. We looked around a little bit and visited the Gift shop. There are some great items in the shop, but it is a little $$$. We also visited the Long Bar - but chose not to purchase a drink prices are super expensive. So having a look around was enough for us!"
,,Not worth the cost,3.0,,"If you have not been there before it is probably worth having a drink,but if you have already done the above ,I think $30 for a beer is too much"
,,Things to buy at Raffles Gift Shop,4.0,,"** (Readers and reviewers, please note that this space is for reviews of Raffles Hotel Arcade only - you will find hotel reviews in a separate entry.)**

Unless you are planning to shop for a new Rolex or Tiffany jewellery at Raffles Arcade, I suggest you check out the Raffles Hotel Gift Shop for souvenirs of your visit. There is something for everyone: among the usual (rather overpriced) key rings, coasters and fridge magnets, you will also find a lot of quality gifts. I can recommend the reproductions of vintage travel posters - there is a good selection for sale. You can also get the famous Kaya jam, a Singaporean speciality.
I bought a fascinating book ""Memoirs of a Raffles Original"" by Mr. Leslie Danker, the Resident Historian at Raffles, and was lucky enough to meet the author and have the book autographed! I recommend Mr Danker's book if you are curious about the history of the hotel, and if you are wondering what the phrase ""a Raffles original"" means...."
,,"Great experience, walking around Raffles",5.0,,Great experience walking around raffles Impressive architecture with the old english traditions A must do if you're in Singapore
,,Long weekend,5.0,,Raffles is a must visit to enjoy a cool drink - Singapore Sling or Tiger Beer - teh old world style is well worth the visit
,,A real treat.,5.0,,"We spent an afternoon at raffles, obviously we visited the long bar for a Singapore sling, which was lovely, we had previously booked online for afternoon tea in the tiffin room, and we were asked why we were booking ? We added that it was to celebrate a special birthday. Much to our surprise I was given a beautiful birthday cake and all the staff stood around and sang happy birthday to me . It was a lovely end to a day I will never forget."
,,Singapore sling,3.0,,Everyone should visit Raffles and have the famous Singapore Sling and don't forget to visit the museum at the hotel and find out who had stayed there in its payday
,,Nothing to recommend it except the history,5.0,,"You do this because of the history. The Long Bar is part of the Arcade and full of tourists. The S Sling is at a tourist rip off price and they don't even make it for you, comes ready made and they just pour it. Have a quick drink and throw the peanut shells on the floor and get out fast. The rest of the arcade is deathly quiet. How do those shops exist ? It's a mystery to me how these places survive on their history, I felt I was in a time warp horror movie."
,,Sadly not quite as special as it was.,3.0,,Over the years the shops here seem to have been a bit downgraded and now there isnt really much here that you cant find elsewhere sadly.
,,A Must Do!!,5.0,,"We went here just specially to experience the Long Bar where you have a small hessian sack full of peanuts and you crack them open and throw the shells on the floor as is the tradition!
We also had a ""Singapore Sling"" just for the sake of it as this is where it was born,..only the one mind as they were Singapore $31 each!
Anyway now I can say been there ,done that and totally enjoyed it.
Mind your feet on the way out , can be slippery with all those shells!"
,,You Just 'Have' to try a Singapore Sling!!!,4.0,,"This is the iconic place to visit in Singapore, worlkd famous as the birthplace of the Singapore Sling!!! So we went to the long bar and ordered one! Great experience, which you pay over the odds for, but worth it for the ambiance!"
,,lovely hotel,5.0,,Enjoyed afternoon tea followed by a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. If you are in Singapore this is a must do.
,,Quintessential Old World deluxe hotel,4.0,,"After sipping a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar upstairs, a friend & I walked around the Raffles Hotel arcade to check out the grounds, the courtyard and shops. It's a lovely grand Old World hotel with lush landscaping that appears to be maintained quite well. Due to it's historical significance, visiting the Raffles Hotel is usually on the top of a visitor's list of Things To See in Singapore."
,,A step back in time,5.0,,"The arcade allows access all around the historic Raffles Hotel as well as to all 3 floors. You can imagine what life was like in the days of empire. As might be expected, the shops are the expensive types. You can also stop off at the famous long bar or drop in to the courtyard."
,,What a disappointment !,3.0,,The old bar has been moved upstairs and definitely lacks atmosphere. Prices were steep 32 SD for an old fashioned Singapore Sling and 42 dollars for a glass of champagne. Nice to say we had visited but certainly not value for money.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Raffles was across the street from the Carlton hotel and therefore easy to get to. Cocktails are pricey but you need to try one and price foes not include the glass! Food looked good and reasonably priced.
,,Magnificent Charming Hotel,5.0,,"We had to visit this hotel during our 3 days visit to Singapore and sample the original home of the famous Singapore Sling. This did not disappoint and although it was nearly $100 for 2 cocktails, was worth it just to experience a little piece of history where so many famous Film Stars and Royalty have stayed in the past decades. It is very Art Deco and all of the walls have quotes and photographs of those that have stayed there! The courtyard rooms are still as they were when the hotel was constructed but obviously have been refurbished to standard and the fabulous Shopping Arcade at Raffles is like a walk back in time so quaint yet fabulous! Another great experience not to be missed when you visit this great City!"
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Well had to do it, even though it is expensive S$36 the thing to do is throw the peanut shells on the floor allegedly! Anyway had to be done"
,,Popped into the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling,4.0,,Like most tourists when visiting Singapore a visit to Raffles for a Singapore Sling is a must. When we visited there were queues lined up waiting to get into the Long Bar. Wait was approx. 15 minutes as most ventured inside to have a sling and then leave. Cost of two Singapore Slings set us back $Sg 73 inclusive of taxes. The Long bar is the only place in Singapore where littering is permitted when the throwing of peanut shell on the floor is a long handled tradition
,,Colonial hotel at its best.,5.0,,"Called for afternoon tea. Beautiful variety of sandwiches and cakes served by uniformed waiters and waitresses. Very colonial. Expensive even by Singaporean standards
(£140 for two people) including a glass of champagne each but a must do if you travel to Singapore. The hotel is fabulous but with an addition of a gift shop can appear a bit touristy. Nevertheless an amazing hotel which I would love to return to."
,,A must do in Singapore....Singapore Sling perhaps?,5.0,,This is an iconic hotel with so much history and so much to see and learn about its history. You must have a Singapore Sling and spend time looking around and buying some souveniers from the gift shop
,,Long bar - Singapore Slings!,5.0,,Very quirky and has a high class feel to the location. Quite pricey however most places are in Singapore. Great Singapore Slings which is what the bar is famous for($31 each bar snacks between $25-$40 + 17% service charged added). Look out for the peanuts on the floor! :)
,,Beauty,5.0,,Today all we can make are tall buildings with weird shapes but this hotel is a true beauty to the eye. made in that age and time the such delicate detailing love every bit of it
,,Have to visit,5.0,,"This is lovely to wander around. You must have a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. It's not cheap but it's all about the experience and you've done it! Also, the high tea is terrific. Once again not cheap, but the food is great and it's a great exeperience"
,,Raffles hotel arcade,5.0,,rAffles hotel is one of the best hotels in Singapore . ...it is very popular with the Britishers and famous personalities . They have made a nice shopping arcade with all the famous Brand’s and expensive items .
,,"Brunch at Raffles, singapore sling and peanut shells",5.0,,"Everybody seems to know about Raffles, an icon for British people for sure so we had to go. Residents valued the brunch which is exceptional - I doubt there is anything anybody would miss on that spread. Expensive for sure, if you include the champagne, cheaper with the wine and without both but still expensive as there's a limit to how much you can eat although just about everything is available. I loved the oysters, all 6 types of it, plus all the sea food, right down to lobster. Couldn't manage much of the rest! The building is iconic and lovely, the long bar, which apparently has changed it's original place twice if my memory serves me right, is really cute with all the peanut shells on the floor. Weird for Singapore, the fine city, with fines for everything! I wasn't impressed with the Singapore sling. Tried it once and never again - watery, sweet, not to my taste but we have gone back to the brunch and have another one booked for December. If you can manage to eat all they offer, then it's worth the money you pay for it - we never came close! Prices are high at the shop as well but Singapore isn't cheap although that brunch is the best I have ever come across - for a price. It is not a cold day activity as there are no cold days in Singapore, apart from the air con"
,,A touch of style,5.0,,"Innitially, when I felt the crunching of peanut shells under my shoes, I was shocked, then I observed other discarding them so casually. I was promptly advised that ""this is was you do here"". We were quickly seated and provided with a small hessian bag of peanuts, order our Singapore Slings and a variety of satay dishes... a couple of hours later, having enjoyed several cocktails and satays, we were on our way. I did take a little stroll around the main bar to enjoy the artworks hanging around the room and despite being roped off, I was invited by one of the staff to take a look up the gorgeous timber spiral staircase in the centre of the room to the bar above where the band was warming up for later that evening. This truly must be on your list of things to do for couples or adult friends when visiting Singapore - a stylish step back in time."
,,Vintage Singapore,4.0,,great atmosphere to see the Singapore of days past. Must try the Singapore Sling. The hotel's signature drink.
,,Raffles shop - rip off prices for rubbish gear,2.0,,"I bought some souvenir trinkets from the Raffles shop and noticed the following: they are massively overpriced, many of the items are exactly the same as when I last bought from there in 1992, the apron I bought for myself had a button that fell off 1st time I tried to use it - so appealing quality control. Well done Raffles management, you must be very proud of the way you charge top dollar for branded tat. What a reflection on your ideas of customer service. Avoid."
,,"Raffles, the brand",2.0,,"Raffles, from nearly closing at the end of the last century has become a brand. And boy do you pay for that brand. The Long Bar is wonderful; enjoy a Singapore Sling and throw peanut shells on the ground. But you pay 31 Singapore Dollars per Sling for the privilege, Go to the Raffles shop. The prices there are quite extraordinary. OK - you've got to have a Singapore Sling at Raffles - it's on your bucket list - but the shop? You've got to be joking."
,,great old building,4.0,,love walking around historic buildings such as this one.lots of shops and places for a drink or something to eat. ken
,,Slowly losing it's olde world charm with extensions.,4.0,,"Firstly let me say that I am lucky to have seen Raffles in the 1980's when the ""Long Bar"" was in its' original and famous location. Nowadays it is just a very upmarket bar with outrageous prices for a Singapore Sling, which I reluctantly paid AUD$75 for just one for myself and my partner; yes it was good, but ... Last time I was there I paid around $25 but got to keep the souvenir glass, now all I got to take away was an empty wallet :-) ... Still a great place to experience, the peanuts were copious and free and of course the Sarkie's Brothers experience of dining/drinking in an exclusive location, lives on; but oh those Sling prices???"
,,Memories of the past,5.0,,"A must place to visit when in Singapore and sample the delights of this historic building. High Tea is recommended but very expensive. Drinking Singapore Slings in the Long Bar as the rich and famous did in the past. Essential!
Monkey nuts to nibble and throw the shells on the floor."
,,Interesting Visit,4.0,,We stayed just a couple of blocks away so just had a stroll around here by ourselves. Beautifully restored. Lots of little expensive shops to see. The gift shop had some great gifts in and I did not think they were badly priced.
,,The home of the singapore sling.,4.0,,Nice place to walk around with a lot of history. Very high end shops and of cause the best Singapore sling in town.
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,"Went to Raffles as part of an evening tour. This is such an iconic place, with all it's past history. It's definitely for this rich and famous. Even the Singapore sling come complete with 10% and VAT !!!"
,,back to the past of yourSingapore!,4.0,,"as an nostalgic building lover, this place like an old friend met. charming atmosphere and many memoirs from the past may give you an exotic moment like a walking pass personal time machine!"
,,Epitomizes colonialism and elegance ...at a price !!!!,3.0,,"A must see while in Singapore , just for the facade alone. Great to explore too ,but very disappointing to find the bar where the Singapore sling was invented only to find it was extortionately expensive. Couldn't even afford a fridge magnet !!!!"
,,So much history but very expensive,4.0,,"we were told that we had to visit the Raffles Hotel and have a Singapore Sling. When we got there, it was quite lovely. The hotel itself was so historical and where you walked inside it, you saw the history on some billboards it had. Everything was quite expensive and I didn't buy any souvenirs, as they were expensive to other places, but we did have a Singapore Sling at the outdoor restaurant and it was very nice to have a historic drink. Tasted nice, but be weary it costed $28."
,,You have to pop in and experience it.,5.0,,"It was just as imagined, you can have a Singapore Sling alcoholic or non alcoholic or just eat the peanuts and throw the shells on the floor as was the custom. Pop in the shop depending on your budget you may just want a key-ring they call them Key-Chains."
,,A great place to experience a bygone age,5.0,,I really enjoyed walking around raffles arcade. You really do get a feeling of a bygone age definitely worth a visit.
,,Soaked in History,4.0,,This place is soaked in history the little shops are lovely as you walk through the lovely architecture. The shops are varied and makes for a nice stroll.
,,raffles hotel....my fav,5.0,,We dressed up and went to enjoy the ambiance of times gone by....we were not disappointed. Our high tea was more than we expected...it was devine. So much food. so many choices. Do not eat before you go.
,,Must Visit Site,5.0,,"The bar is the attraction. The Singapore Sling is the named drink, but a beer and some peanuts fill the bill to enjoy the historic setting."
,,Basically Raffles shops.,4.0,,"We went into Raffles for a Singapore Sling and popped int the shopping arcade afterwards. There is a few shops, the main one selling Raffles souvenirs."
,,Raffles is awesome,5.0,,"Definately worth a view, day or night. Beautiful chandeliers light up the walkways at evenings. They, e lloked after this icon well. You can feel the history as you walk around."
,,A Taste of Old Singapore in Grand Style,5.0,,"This lovely and historic Hotel is famous around the world for its quiet elegance and British colonial architecture.

There are many elegant shops and the restaurants and bars are top notch. If you are so inclined the famous Singapore Sling drink will be your souvenir for about $36! Of And"
,,Luxury!,5.0,,Super shopping experience! Really with going for a look around the shops and restaurants. A must see on any trip!
,,Gin Slings,5.0,,A must see. Have slings in the long bar and then you must have tiffin. So much food and delicious in a great setting
,,Lovely!,5.0,,"This is my dream hotel to stay in SG. I stayed in Fairmont so this place was walking distance. Shops are luxurious but one must try their al fresco dining area. It would be good at night as it is cooler, it is humid in the afternoon. It wouldn't hurt to try out their lounges... I love the Writer's Bar in Manila but it was closed the time we went there."
,,I recommend to go there at night.,5.0,,"As you know it's very dark and humid at night in Singapore, but Raffles Hotel is shining very gorgeous and brilliant as if it's other world. Security and safety is perfect in Singapore."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Should be on everyone's Bucket List. Expensive but it is THE HOTEL in Singapore. If you cant afford to stay there at least have a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar.
,,Raffles is an iconic place to visit.,4.0,,I had always wanted a Gin Sling at Raffles. I finally did it. Ridiculous price but I have now been there and done it. The shops are expensive too but lovely to look at. Something to tick off my list of things to do.
,,Wow,5.0,,"High end shops and prices to match. But super location and views. Great architecture and atmosphere, got to see longs bar of course !"
,,A must visit when in Singapore,4.0,,"A taste of British colonial time, it is great just to walk around and take in the architecture. Visit Long Bar for an original Singapore Sling, or eat lunch out in the hotel courtyard."
,,An elegant old dame but in need of rehab,3.0,,"Raffles was once legendary and it is trying to live on this history. Unfortunately the facilities have not been kept up with the prices, particularly the center square. If you want to pay for tradition, then go for it. Otherwise, spend your money in other spots nearby."
,,Plush,5.0,,"I loved it. You get the feel of being back in time, we had the famous Singapore sling cocktail to round off the visit.......free monkey nuts for all. Lol"
,,Iconic Singapore,4.0,,"Raffles itself is your typical colonial building. We enjoyed the Long Bar and indulging in the classic Singapore Sling, probably more times than was good for us. The situation of the Long Bar is not the original site but the customs are still the same. A Singa Sling and a bag of peanuts and you are back in the 1930s."
,,Experience the finest.,5.0,,Certainly an iconic place to visit when in Singapore. The building is full of history and is so clean and maintained to ultimate perfection. An experience not to miss as you will certainly regret not experiencing this wonderful place.
,,Had to go!,4.0,,We just had to go to Raffles because we were in Singapore! We enjoyed the Singapore Slingers and relaxing in the Long Bar. Probably wouldn't go again but really glad we experienced it :)
,,must see,5.0,,Once you are in Singapore you must see this hotel or better stay if you can afford. Atmosphere in this hotel is like nothing else. Don't forget to get famous Singapore Sling at the bar.
,,Most over rated experience since The Moulin Rouge in Paris,1.0,,Decided this was a must do item on a visit to Singapore. S$74 for two drinks is ridiculous. Had one drink and left. Wouldn't bother. From our brief observation they turned their tables pretty quickly. My guess is a lot of people like me who thought they had to tick this box on a visit to Singapore. Once the box has been ticked there is absolutely no reason to stay for a second drink!
,,A must do experience.,5.0,,"My friends and I spent an hour of so in the courtyard here drinking Singapore Slings and beer. It is quite expensive to do this, but excused by the fact that you are ""on holidays."" It is a pleasant and friendly environment, assisted by good waiters/waitresses and something you have to experience if you are travelling to Singapore."
,,"Lovely cocktails, but super expensive!",5.0,,"It was rainy and we had nothing planned so took the kids to the long bar so they could eat and throw peanuts on the ground and we could have a Singapore Sling! They were delicious but very expensive. A treat, but so much fun"
,,Early afternoon visit,3.0,,"My wife and I have heard so much about this Hotel and in particular the bar with the history of eating peanuts throwing the shells on the floor and drinking a Singapore sling.
Really disappointing, not what its built up to be,very expensive with 2 drinks costing $64.
We used the rest rooms on the way out and found them somewhat lacking in cleanliness. Will not be returning"
,,Nice colonial surroundings for luxury shopping,4.0,,"As you would expect the surroundings are very colonial and well looked after. Great atmosphere and the bar in the courtyard was worth a stop over on its own.

Shops are all very 'high-end' (Tiffany etc) so we didn't actually do much shopping, just walked through and enjoyed the environment."
,,Surreal experience,5.0,,"While on a business trip, I just stopped by for a singapore sling. Red carpet standards right across the board here. Amazing surroundings. The Long Bar was a nice treat!"
,,Interesting Arcade in a Historic Hotel,3.0,,"Some interesting shops specially the Raffles Gift Shop , other shops are not great. The Restaurants a re good for a quick bite or tea. The Bar in the Garden is nice.and relaxing in the middle of a bust city."
,,History,5.0,,Wonderful place to visit. See the Long Bar and enjoy a Singapore Sling. The gardens around the raffles are wonderful.
,,A singapore sling at Raffles,4.0,,We went to Raffles on a pre-booked trip. Through hindsight we were have just made our own way to stay longer. We were only there for about 40 mins. As soon as we'd drunk our Singapore sling it was time to leave.. The place itself is really historical and its like going back in time. Well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful area,4.0,,"Waiting for afternoon tea in the tiffin room we did a little shopping. Was quite surprised at the decent prices, yes some items are expensive but there's plenty reasonably priced. The atmosphere around the whole outside of the hotel is very relaxed and it's a lovely place."
,,Piece of History,5.0,,"I have had the experience of staying a Raffles, So taking my friends to see Raffles was a trip down memory lane we strolled the grounds and had lunch at the Long Bar and of course had a Singapore Sling. was expensive ,but woth the experience."
,,A touch of the British class,5.0,,Went in with a view of sampling the class but could not since it was a bit pricey.The hotel is real good with luxurious settings that belies its age.All the same the experience was good.
,,Classic of all times,5.0,,"I like the architecture of this place and the ambience of their garden, long bar, classic building. I have been here many times still never get bored. Shopping items from its souvenir shop is a must visit. However they are pricey than usual souvenirs. But if you like Raffles brand you will."
,,SINGAPORE SLING.,4.0,,"This is where every tourist heads to, either for a Singapore sling or a mocktail, eat handfuls of peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, it's just the thing to do in the Long Bar at Raffles."
,,Rip Off Raffles,2.0,,"We visited the Long Bar for a drink. This is a tourist trap. Staff not pleasant S78.85 SD (£47,21) for one Singapore sling, a pint of beer and a non-alcoholic Singapore sling.Staff clean up your table and take empty glasses away while you are still sitting there in a bid to get you out, it is so busy. Better to pop your head in and have a look. Singapore sling tasted rotten!"
,,Swanky But Expensive,4.0,,Lovely colonial hotel and arcade - very exclusive and very upscale - but so too are the prices! Good but not special.
,,Wonderful atmosphere,5.0,,My partner & I went here with friends for 1 drink and ended up staying longer just because of the awesome atmosphere. The drinks are on the expensive side but it is well worth it!
,,Lovely and historic hotel. Must see while in Singapore,4.0,,"I first visited Raffles 10 years ago and was keen to go and take another look. I really love this place it's an oasis of colonial charm in the center of amazing Singapore. Of course having a drink in the long bay is a must. Be warned its EXPENSIVE and the food (bar snacks) are very ordinary. Avoid the nachos which is basically a small bowl of corn chips delivered with even smaller bowls of salsa, quest and avocado. Not tasty and a rip off. The fries were quite good and we were pleased with our mojitos. Enjoy!"
,,History all written !!,4.0,,Amazing place with history all written around it.. Must do during Singapore's visit.. Breath taking and lovely..
,,Luxury and atmosphere,5.0,,"Journey into the past, imagine you are someone famous, all easy to do in such a setting. I love this place."
,,Best breakfast in Singapore,5.0,,"Yes, we all go to Raffles for a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar but I was advised to go for breakfast. What great advice and what an amazing breakfast. Open to non-residents, even if you are staying somewhere economical you can splurge out and enjoy one of the largest buffet breakfasts I have ever seen. There is something rather decadent about mixing what could be classed as a ""full English"" with an array of noodles!!"
,,Singapore Sling at the bar area - a must,4.0,,"the old colonian style well kept - and the drink was served chilled and fine. The prize was +, but that was expected."
,,We got to see Raffles,5.0,,"This was the highlight of my tour in Singapore. I have wanted to visit Raffles for ages. I was not disappointed. The grounds were fabulous, just like I was expecting. The building was perfect, all very clean. We chose to have lunch in the Longbar, home of the Singapore Sling. Of course I had one, delicious, albeit expensive, but we knew that before we entered. Our thoughts were, it is only going to be the once. We had a great meal and drink in lovely surroundings."
,,Birthplace of the Singapore Sling,4.0,,"Any visit to Singapore is not complete without visiting the Raffles Hotel. Enjoy the splendour of old Singapore and when you head to the 2nd level and enter the Long Bar, you would forget that this is 2016. Every decor and even the manual mechanical looking fan that brings you back to colonial Singapore. This is the only place in Singapore where you are allowed to enjoy your roasted peanuts and throw them on the floor. They do have a nice wooden container for those not used to littering but why take the fun out it!

The Long Bar is the birthplace of the world famous Singapore Sling. There is also variation of the sling on the menu but you definitely have to tickle your taste buds with the original for starters. There is a live band that plays on the upper floor of the bar. There is a spiral stairs that leads to the upper level. You only have to follow the sound of the music and it will lead you up, just like following the pipe piper but only this time, It is to music that will keep you wanting to get out of your seat and dance!"
,,Overpriced and Run Down,2.0,,Went there to have a Singapore sling but at $31. Plays Tax & get works out to $36 for one drink I did'nt want a bottle of gin I just wanted a drink needless to say I passed ridiculous the pricing of everything there especially when the place is starting to look very old & shabby
,,@ 62nd floor,4.0,,We went in there one night for clubbing. The view from the room top is so amazing that we can see the entire stretch of Singapore in one go. The night lights and panaromic view is just so fantastic that we forgot to enjoy at the club dancing.
,,Worth the visit,4.0,,"The high tea in the tiffin room is really expensive but worth it just for the experience and surroundings alone. Do go into the Long Room and have a Singapore Sling don't be put off by people saying it is a tourist trap, where else can you throw peanut shells on the floor and receive impeccable service?"
,,Iconic in Singapore,4.0,,The hotel is beautiful. A historic piece of architecture. Unfortunately very touristy now. Went to the Long Bar. It's quaint but overpriced. The shops are very expensive.
,,Colonial Splendor,4.0,,"If you are looking to get a taste of colonial Singapore, then a visit to the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel is the place to go. The whitewashed architecture, draped in lush greenery is beautiful and welcoming, and as you first enter the bar you feel transported to another day. The one caveat--it is swamped with tourists who are seeking the same experience as you are. I suppose it is just one of those things you have to do as a tourist who's flown 24 hours to get here.

And when at the Long Bar you of course have to imbibe the famous 'Singapore Sling' and watch your dollars fly quickly from your wallet. My suggestion--skip the drink-there's more sugar than alcohol in it. A beer would be much more refreshing in the hot, steamy climate of Singapore.

Feeling like I couldn't just go in and have the drink and leave (that would be much too like the other tourists!) I order a plate of fried calamari. Wrong idea, it wasn't fresh, the bread coating tasted as if they had been previously frozen and the texture was clumpy and chewy-and again the wallet feels the pain at over 20USD for this appetizer.

I my advice, save the money and just take a stroll around the grounds and a peek inside the bar."
,,Great but expensive Singapore sling,4.0,,"Great atmosphere and excellent service. Food was OK and it is worth visiting, Singapore Slings are delicious and you have to try one."
,,Expensive shops,3.0,,We didn't find it very impressive. The prices are generally quite high. I wouldn't come back here unless I really had to for some reason.
,,Wander round the verandas of a Singapore icon,4.0,,Lovely to see such a beautify old colonial masterpiece. Worth a stroll around the arcades and verandas.
,,"Iconic, so expensive",4.0,,"Having a drink at such an iconic place is a bit of a must. It still has a great atmosphere of long gone times. And of course, there is a price tag to it, but that could be expected."
,,Overpriced,3.0,,"Very overpriced, had I known I would pay that much for two Singapore slings I would have eaten my weight in free nuts!"
,,Still retains its old-world atmosphere,5.0,,Every tourist should have a S'pore Sling & Tiffin at Raffles. They have managed to maintain the feel of a by-gone age & the shops are well-worth a browse for value souvenirs
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Apart from its beautiful facade, it is not really possible to get a true picture of this famous hotel. We had a drink at the Long Bar - what a rip off... S$42 for two of the cheapest beers! Now, we're not girls who baulk at spending money but this was a bit rich. There is a shop where one can purchase from an extensive range of products but we didn't buy from there."
,,Surroundings visit,4.0,,"We were staying in the hotel and just wanted to see what was surrounding us, to decide on local activities we might want to do, some interesting shops and some not interesting, depending on what you want"
,,Iconic,4.0,,A must visit when in Singapore as it is an icon of Singapore. Expensive by comparison but being the birthplace of the Singapore Sling the long bar is one to cross off the bucket list!
,,Brilliant experience,5.0,,Lovely for afternoon tea and of course trying the Singapore sling cocktail... It would be rude not to. It in not expensive as one may think due to its history however it is like setting back in time. Staff friendly and lovely little shops to buy that little souvenir. Staff friendly. Book in advance so you are not disappointed.
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,"There are two main reasons to go here: high tea is a big deal here, and if you hav e never done it you may want to try it. This is also the birthplace of the Singapore Sling"
,,Great !!!,5.0,,Some really lovely shops here in a beautiful historic building. Has a relaxed colonial charm to it and you can always add the singapore sling experience in the Raffles Bar.
,,Home of the Singapore Sling,5.0,,A visit to the Long Bar in Raffles has to be done when visiting Singapore. Not a cheap experience but well worth it! I had heard so much about it and I wasn't disappointed. The Singapore Slings were excellent.
,,Bucket list,4.0,,It is a tourists must in Singapore. A symbol of colonial past of the town. Everyone should try Singapore sling and hear its story.
,,"Raffles is so elegant and refined, a true delight",5.0,,"Raffles has wow factor, it has class and it made my trip to Singapore very memorable. We had a pizza in the courtyard and a Singapore Sling. Just divine. It's a must do for every visitor to Singapore."
,,Superb morning walk,5.0,,"We took the walkthrough the Raffles arcade thanks to the Tripadvisor community advices and was a great reccomandation!
Although we have been in Singapore7 years ago, we did not knew that we could have visit the hotel. Now we took a morning visit and hapily a Singapore sling in the Long Bar, assorted with the air of ""long time ago"". Wonderfull breakfast!
We did shop a little bit a few tee souvenirs and started the day wonderfully.
Definitely worth a visit!"
,,Disappointing Sling,2.0,,"Second time to Raffles. The first was a Christmas eve a few years ago when the courtyard was decked out for the holiday and lots of people celebrating so the atmosphere was festive. This time we stopped in to the courtyard bar on a weekday afternoon. The courtyard bar was nearly empty yet it took quite a while to be served and service was lackluster at best. Place mats on the table were tacky plastic and a turn off. We knew drinks would be expensive but wanted to have a bit of a treat. Very disappointed with the quality of my Sling, lucky if there was any alcohol in it at all and it wasn't very pleasant. If spending thirty dollars on a drink I'd expect it to WOW me rather then feeling like I just wasted my money. Watched other tourist wash their hands in the courtyard fountain. Lots of shops in the arcade were closed. All in all pretty disappointing and no sense of charming colonial times we hoped would be invoked."
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,Beautiful place. Its like your in the palace. Excellent architecture. Im just hoping that someday I could check in here. =)
,,Head to the long bar.,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a trip to the long bar to relax sipping on a ""Singapore sling"" But don't stop there as there is a lot more to see wandering around this majestic old building.
Take a peek at the murals adorning the walls in the ballroom."
,,long bar,5.0,,very famous fabulous long bar had to queue for aboout ten mins but finally got a table for 7 amazing nostalga and great friendly service very expensive but free monkey nuts! to throw shells ont he floor the only place you can litter
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"An interesting place to visit , great food hall and variety of small shops to explore. Enjoy a drink in the Raffles courtyard under the umbrellas in the shade during the afternoon where it's quiet and relaxing."
,,"Outside bar, nice location, terrible service",2.0,,"There is an outdoor bar in the Raffles Hotel complex. I believe it is actually teh raffles bar (not to be confused with the indoor ""Long Bar""). It is a nice colonial style gaden setting and it is easy to imagine traders and business people from a bygone era cooling off there after a hard day. There is plenty of time to muse like this because the servce when we went was absolutely abysmal. Two bar staff were standing up at the other end of the bar doing something with their phones or the till and completely ignoring the customers. We left after about 10 futile minutes and had Happy Hour at another Bar near the Talia restaurant in the same complex and it was much better."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Historical place and the birth of the Singapore Sling. Go to the Long Bar, get a Sling and throw your peanut shells on the floor."
,,Colonial Hotel,4.0,,Visited the hotel and walked around it to savour the ambience. It has retained its charm over the years. Do stop by the wine bar and enjoy one of several types of Singapore gin sling cocktails.
,,Nice historical building,4.0,,"Well maintained building with historical value. Make sure you take a map, we forgot ours and there wasn't much signage to let you know which way to go."
,,It's the hotel,4.0,,"It's the hotel. Yes it's nice...you are just going for the singapore sling. You think...wow, it's nice but not worth the price to stay."
,,Singapur Sling,5.0,,Lovely old colonial building with beautiful garden and bars. Of course we had to see where the original Singapur Sling comes from! Nice Shops in a beautiful area. Charmy
,,A night tour of Singapore included Raffles Hotel,4.0,,Our guide had many stories relating to the history of this Hotel as well as the many famous guests who stayed there. Also there was the traditional Singapore Sling. Well worth the experience.
,,Good stop while walking downtown,5.0,,We were downtown (to visit the National Gallery) and saw the Raffles so we stopped in. No charge to walk around and see British colonialism in all its splendor. Very pretty. Also stopped in the Long Bar where my wife just had to have a Singapore Sling (for $36!).
,,Exquisite Hotel,4.0,,We walked through the hotel and ended up having some cakes at the bakery. Wished we had done the high tea as it would have been an amazing feeling sitting in this iconic hotel with its old world charm.
,,Sling in Singapore,5.0,,"What can you do but have a Singapore sling at the raffles hotel. This is the most amazing place full of marble, palms, history ands tranquility. It is expensive but worth the memory."
,,A class act,4.0,,"A glimpse into the past, a fascinating peek into part of the interior of Raffles, the shops are very classy with prices to match."
,,Singapore Sling in the Long Bar,5.0,,"One thing not to miss isdrinking a SingaporeSling in this nice historical place, I preffer the outside bar rather than inside the LongBar ( but more famous).... The Singpore Sling is one of the best cocktails!!"
,,Not too many great shops,3.0,,"When we stayed at the Raffles, we also visited the hotels shopping arcade. Mostly average shops there, with several shops empty on the upper floors."
,,Shopping colonial style,5.0,,"For a moment, find yourself back in colonial Singapore - and then get back to the 21st century and find a great choice of upmarket shops. Saturated your urge for shopping, then move to the bar at Raffles and have the unavoidable Singapore Sling in the place where it originated!"
,,A beautiful part of history and grandure,4.0,,"A splendid and grand hotel. We went here to Raffles Lounge or ""the Long Bar"" for a Singapore Sling. Being that this is where the drink was invented so many years ago, we figured it would be a fun experience filled with culture. We weren't the only ones that thought this as the place was crowded and hard to find seating. Best time to go is early afternoon when you need to wet your whistle and have a refreshing and recharging ""Singapore Sling"". The drinks are made fresh and in assembly line fashion since every wants to try them. I must say, they are very refreshing, tasty and enjoyable on the warm, humid Singapore days. They are very tasty and made with creative and unique care. Very much worth the time and experience. The bar reminds me of something Hemmingway would fashion himself too - dark wood floors, beams and bar. A long ""L"" shaped bar with dark bar tables crammed about the place. Ceiling fans spin away providing some circulation and the rafters echo with voices and glasses clinking. Not the original location of the ""Long Bar"" as it has been moved about this old hotel a few times. But it does offer a historical feeling and passage way back in time. Whether casually dressed and or dressed up, the doors are open and your welcomed. Couples, Business, Friends or solo - a great place to relax. A fun place and the ""Singapore Sling"" didn't disappoint - Worth the experience.
A few notes: Don't just walk into the lobby and think you can roam about this hotel. If your not staying here you will not be able to tour the full hotel. Non-guests are limited to the Long Bar for the Singapore Slings, Gardens, Restaurants and gift shop. You can walk about the lobby which is filled with a restaurant and shops. I suggest taking a spin around the gift shop - a variety of gift ideas and hotel folklore / history. The staff and hotel pays attention to detail and is very friendly. I true beautiful and well preserved hotel that is very accommodating and worth the time.
And yes, the Singapore Slings are enjoyable. CHEERS!!"
,,Raffles,3.0,,"Raffles id nice to have a little wonder around especially if you are visiting the long bar or the tiffin room.
Expemsive shops and bistro are in the complex as well as s raffles gift shop.
I can't help but feel sorry for the guests of raffles gaving their hotel full of tourists."
,,Interesting shopping,4.0,,We were on our way to one of the Raffles hotel bars and were pleasantly surprised with the level of shops that are within the arcade comples.
,,Interesting history,4.0,,Strolling through the the gardens of this historical building is a must see. Try the long bar and the gift shop
,,Not worth a visit,2.0,,"As part of the greater ""Raffles Hotel complex"" the arcades have small retail outlets and a couple of bistro,s however they are never busy due to the cost and type of goods they sell, as its directly on the opposite side of the road to Raffles City shopping Mall, better options are just over the road."
,,Enter life of by--gone days! You are part of the cast.,5.0,,"""High Tea"" at the Raffles Hotel is an outstanding experience! from when you arrive at the hotel and are greeted by the Indian Doorman,dressed in his full traditional dress, you feel like you are entering a play that is back in days gone by and you are one of the players.The "" High Tea"" is full silver service, the staff make you feel""Special"" We felt that we should of dressed in clothing of that by-gone era.There was more than enough food,Tea & Coffee for all, There was nice piano music,played by a musican & later fine harp music,played by a young lady, ths created a nice atmosphere. It was a definite high point of our trip, If you want to experience days gone by in Singapore this is the one to experience."
,,architectural masterpiece,5.0,,"This is such a beautiful building, we went and had a look inside the foyer briefly but didn't have time to stay. The staff on the door were not that friendly/helpful, maybe to guests they are. Love the ambience of the place."
,,Cuban style,4.0,,"Beautiful venue regardless if you visit it day time or night time. Must try the specialty cocktail, Singapore Sling. The Longbar is like a fancy Cuban style cigar bar. Fantastic!"
,,Expensive,3.0,,Good coffee and danishes downstairs in the food court. But overall I found that this shopping centre was expensive and predictable!
,,A bit fo history,4.0,,"Raffles is an exclusive resort, we went only to the long bar and the shopping arcade. The long bar with it's free peanuts where you throw your shells on the floor is worth seeing but the Singapore slings are super expensive after tax two drinks cost $72 Australian. Is it worth it I will leave that to you."
,,Thinking of the good old days,4.0,,"We stayed at the Raffles frequently when we lived in Indonesia in the 1970s, and always enjoyed it. We we pleasantly surprised to find that at least the bar has remained the same, and it seemed that the customers were the same as well..... But the arcade is new and interesting enough, but not much different from other arcades elsewhere in Singapore. But we certainly enjoyed sitting at the bar and remembering the good old days. And the hotel seems to have retained its character, though it is out of our price range now."
,,Got to visit!,5.0,,Every tourist has to visit Raffles! It certainly lives up to its reputation! Wonderful that this building has been restored to its former glory! Loved it!
,,Memories of Yesteryear,4.0,,"Whilst in Singapore It's one of the touristy things to do, and that's visit Raffles Hotel. A small group of us went to the Upstairs bar ( can't recall the name) for the must have Singapore Sling. Although the drink was refreshing, the price was a bit over the top, but if you're willing to part with $62 for two drinks then go and enjoy the old world ambiance, and by the way the peanuts are complimentary."
,,"Oh Raffles, you are beautiful!",5.0,,More beautiful than I imagined. I have wanted to visit Raffles for many years but never had long enough in Singapore to do so. The wait was worth it. This old Hotel is absolutely beautiful. The famous Singapore Sling was nice and something you just have to do whilst there (spend the money and do it). Take a good walk around the hotel and gardens.
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,Lovely hotel and gardens. Shops a little expensive but expected. Little bit precious of their afternoon tea in terms of dress code and booking for travels like myself and my husband who want to relax and not be stuck to a timeframe whilst on holiday. Long bar and Singapore sling a must :)
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,Sip a Singapore Sling in one of the bars or have a meal. For High Tea you will need to book ahead. Not cheap by any means but soak up the old atmosphere.
,,"Very good area to hang out and for bar, shops",4.0,,"This is a wonderful place near Marina bay. This is a luxurious hotel. There are shops, bars souvenirs.. the Raffles Gift Shop had lots to offer, but everything is too expensive!"
,,Great historical place,4.0,,"Think visiting Raffles hotel is a must when you visit Singapore, it has a great historical value. You can walk around this hotel and theres a beautiful garden inside. You find some nice but not so cheap shops at the arcade, some restaurants and the famous long bar. Nothing is cheap here but worth a try."
,,Must do,4.0,,"Have to go Raffles and have a Singapore Sling in the long bar or at the terrace bar. Sit and chat with the bar man, always friendly. Have a stroll around the shopping arcade and see a bit of history on the way. Front of the hotel and be treated in the old way by the concierge at the front with umbrella if needed, old ways are the best! Be a part of history at Raffles"
,,When you visit Raffles take in the shops.,3.0,,"Whilst the Raffles Gift Shop had lots to offer, we found the prices high. Limited purchases to souvenirs."
,,History and good mood,5.0,,"I have a fantastic stay at this wonderfull place where the service , history, food and... and... Everything is perfect. Best Hotel experience."
,,The Long Bar,5.0,,Fun place to hang out and have peanuts and the original singapore sling - which is a bit sweet but there are variations that are more sour...
,,Fine hotel !!!! Worth your every money,5.0,,Glamour and expensive spending is here...I just tell myself that if I could spend money for others.... why not spend for my well being !
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Just had to pop into Raffles for a Singapore Sling, delicious and well worth the rather high price just to say we did it!"
,,"Don't look at the price, just have a Singapore Sling!",4.0,,"Only way to go into the hotel by the front door is to stay there or eat in the restaurant so we booked lunch in the Tiffin Room months in advance from home. It was very nice but closed at 2pm so a little rushed. Then had a walk along the arcade which is nicely done using the old buildings and you can pick up Raffles souvenirs as well as expensive boutique items. Got to have a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar even if it is 28 dollars, get your own back by eating lots of free peanuts and throwing the shuck on the floor, its a tradition there!"
,,beautiful hotel,5.0,,"after walking for ages we finally came upon this hotel, you can enjoy the walk round of the hotel at your leisure of course certain areas you cannot visit"
,,worth the visit for the dress I purchased....,5.0,,"overrated, somewhat tired hotel now but the shopping was good. Bough a beautiful dress here! Too busy for my liking but that's Singapore"
,,Worth a wonder,5.0,,"Beautiful hotel to wonder around, easy access via City Hall MRT. If you visit the long bar it's around $30 for a Singapore sling, not cheap but a fun experience, worth a visit, friendly and helpful staff"
,,Another Tick off the list,5.0,,"Opulent, Glitzy and if I'm being honest a little corny but its great. I personally hate Singapore sling but its all about the experience. In al honesty the staff aren't great but just do it it is a must in Singapore atleast once."
,,City Oasis.,5.0,,"Raffles was built in the 1830s, and started out as a privately owned beach house. It was turned into a colonial style luxury hotel in 1887. The hotel was named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore. There has been many additional wings added over the years.
However we were not fortunate to be staying in this beautiful hotel, but we did enjoy a visit to the Long Bar, and a look round the shops."
,,Raffles Arcade,3.0,,Probably the only reason for a visit is see what the Raffles hype is all about or to by from the Raffles shop. The shop is very popular. After all who can visit Singapore and not take home a bit of Raffles.
,,It was on our 'tick list',3.0,,"I suppose our first trip to Singapore just had to include a trip to Raffles and their famous bar. We queued to get in, not too long, but irritating. Hubby had the original Singapore Sling and chucked peanut shells on the floor - I had to fight the urge to get a dustpan and brush to clear them all up, as the floor was covered!! It was pleasant, but would not go again - bit of a touristy experience really, and you are kept well away from accessing the actual hotel itself, which does look beautiful."
,,Great sling poor service,3.0,,This has been a dream of mine as Aussie girl raffles and a Singapore sling Rude staff even guy at front desk so rude and staff at long bar unfriendly and very unhelpful What a disappointment even though the drink was lovely that's not enough
,,Amazing culture,5.0,,"You don't need to buy, just walk around and immerse yourself in the history and culture of the famous raffles. The arcade shops are great, but the walk through the arcade, the gardens and the atmosphere are great to soak up and enjoy."
,,Expensive drinks.,3.0,,"I think this was one of thr must things to do, have Singapore sling in Raffles Long Bar. It is not cheap, but worth of wisiting."
,,There is only ONE Raffles,4.0,,"We had drinks at the Long Bar, Singapore Sling, at its best after all they have been making these for 100 years. Also the beer was cold. We had dinner in the Courtyard, yes a bit pricey, but worthit!"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,This is an iconic place to visit the high tea is lovely and plentiful the surroundings are beautiful and very photogenic a must to visit
,,"Beautiful old building full of history, but oh, the prices!!!",4.0,,"My mum had visited this place almost 60 years ago and so I was determined to see what she had talked about. It was much bigger than I expected, and such a beautiful place. However, the prices were ridiculously expensive at almost £20 per Singapore Sling. The peanuts were free however! Altogether I felt very ripped off by the prices but still glad I had seen what all the fuss was about."
,,Beautiful place ..,5.0,,"Even not thinking shopping purpose to go there, but still worth visiting. Even clouded busy city in Singapore, this place make me feel oasis in center of downtown. Another favorite place in Singapore."
,,Singapore Trip 2016,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore you have to have a Singapore Gin Sling or a beer at Raffles, its just a must. Was a bit disappointed this time as the Billiard Bar now doesn't open until 5pm. Also you have to get your photo taken with the doorman out the front of the hotel."
,,A must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,Fabulous ambience and with very interesting independent shops. The Raffles gift shop has some very interesting items to buy and I did buy the T-Shirt as they were well designed and of a high quality. I also bought some of the special blend of Raffles English Breakfast tea so that I could enjoy it back home as a reminder of the afternoon tea I had there. A truly fabulous place to visit.
,,Nice buildindg but the shops are overpriced and nothing special,3.0,,"The building is historic and lovely but it has not been treated with the respect one might want. Advertising slogans are pasted everywhere and the shops have a limited selection of high quality, but rather unimaginative items."
,,Only time for a short visit,4.0,,Our visit was short as we had other visits to complete so only visit to see the hotel and get a momento of our visit from the gift shop which was achieved. There were plenty of other shops that were all high end and not our type of shopping although I am sure many of the hotel guest make purchases.
,,High Tea - wonderful,4.0,,"Lovely to get dressed up and sit in cool comfort with a lot of food for afternoon tea. Very structured with tea from 3-5pm, line up. Expensive cost me about $200 for 2p with 1 Singapore Sling PP. Get the taxi straight to the door"
,,A quick Glimpse,5.0,,Didn't have time to shop here used it as an underpass to get to the MRT station. From a previous visit there are the usual shopping outlets and of course its proximity to the famous Raffles Hotel
,,Long Bar and a Sling,4.0,,"Nice to experience this iconic piece of Singaporean architectural history. A beautiful building and managed to squeeze in a dark and stormy at the long bar, nuts a plenty.."
,,"Slice of history, charming but not spectacular",4.0,,"Even if you are not a hotel guest, you can visit the arcade. Avoid the high fashion boutique shops, just stroll around the walkways and afterwards relax with a tea in the charming courtyard in the middle."
,,Enjoyable walk,3.0,,"I came here for the gift shop, and the Singapore Sling is the thing I'm looking for. It is quite a big gift shop with a range of goods, from food to clothing to accessories.
The other shops I didn't even went into, because it was not of my interest and I wouldn't think I would buy much from them.
It's a historical building, but I find the way it is 'refurbished' feels a bit too new. This was the route I took when I wanted to go into city centre, so I passed by it quite often. It is always peace and quiet."
,,Enjoyable,5.0,,Had great time at raffles ...enjoyed the long bar ..had to have a cocktail ..next time will get Singapore sling .
,,Very nice,4.0,,Top spot but could only window shop. Money money money is the name of the game and I was just a poor to risk.
,,A sample of history,5.0,,"Was advised if had the chance to visit this historical hotel. Beautiful and elegant. Visited the the long bar - had the traditional monkey nuts (through the shell on floor) and a signature drink, Singspore Sling"
,,Iconic,5.0,,"An interesting visit to Raffles hotel, gift shop had a wide range of goods. The afternoon tea at the bakery was good. To take high tea you need to book."
,,an enjoyable experience,5.0,,we were staying at the Carlton Hotel just across the way.did enjoy a trip across to Raffles Arcade we treated ourselves to afternoon tea which was very enjoyable but expensive lovely staff and service however It was something we might have regretted so glad we did it The LONG BAR was very disappointing We visited it later around 8 oc couldnt ordre any food because it was Tuesday .!so back we went to our own hotel and had lovely food there The gift shop in the arcade is lovely a little expensive but some nice souveniers to take home Also some lovely kiddies clothes and books If you are a grand parent you will love the selection.
,,Beautiful Hotel,4.0,,Beautiful Hotel to admire from the front door as you are not allowed to go inside unless you are a paying guest. It is worthwhile to walk around the back of the hotel up the stairs to the Long bar where you can buy a Singapore Sling. This is where the drink was introduced to Singapore in the 1800s. The Long bar is casual place with a good band on a Friday and Saturday Night.
,,Interesting £,5.0,,A Singapore landmark and can be added onto other tours. lots of boutique shops leave credit card at hotel.
,,To much Hype for this Place,3.0,,"We visited Raffles after hearing it's a must do in Singapore but I didn't really see what all the hype was about. It was a great building with some good history but there are a lot of great buildings in Singapore. The drink and food prices were outrageous, they are increasing the prices just because it's raffles ? This place could interest some people but it wasn't for a couple of 25 year old guys."
,,ocation a Surprise.,3.0,,Great food and place to be seen. A little disappointing as to location. There are giant buildings each side as its right in the main city.
,,Holiday 2016,4.0,,"Raffles Hotel is well worth a visit its full of history and your free to walk around , firstly visit the souvenir shop There's plenty of gifts to choose from small to large all reasonably priced . Only down side to or visit was they don't serve drinks or tea , coffee until 12 o' clock"
,,Stunningly beautiful,5.0,,"What a trip back through time. !! This hotel is amazing, taking up an entire block it encounters 4 roads. I could almost feel like i was back in the British,Indian Colonial times & that someone would soon be along to serve me afternoon tea, Tiffing as it was then called.The Tea rooms are still called the Tiffing Rooms. The Long Bar has an old tradition where you must shell nuts & throw the shells on the floor. The more you crunch when you walk the better. Immaculate gardens & beautiful ornate fret work on all the buildings. There is the Raffles Museum enclosed within the hotel too which is very interesting & informative of the old days. Beautiful boutique style shops. Just over flowing with charm. This place is stunning, a must see for everyone who goes to Singapore."
,,Beautiful but stuffy,2.0,,"Though this building is beautiful with a lot of history, the staff are unhelpful, pretentious and the restaurant is too expensive for it's own good."
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,"Obligatory Singapore Sling....check....soaked up the ambience, probably the most over priced Singapore Sling on the planet...but when in Rome.."
,,Worth every cent,5.0,,"We did go to a buffet dinner here for our anniversary. World class service. The waiters were amazing, they took such great care of us. We had Indian buffet and there was plenty of food to choose from and it was delicious. Expensive but worth every cent!"
,,A Landmark of Singapore,5.0,,"You cannot visit Singapore without a walk-thru or have a beer/gin n tonic in the long bar. Really enjoyed our time there, being surrounded in history."
,,Must do in Singapore,5.0,,"This is a must stop place in Singapore. Three things to do at Raffles, have tea in the Tiffin room, have a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar and walk the grounds. There is so much history and you feel like you have escaped Singapore but it's beauty is breathtaking."
,,Went to the Long Bar for a drink.,5.0,,Beautiful hotel. We only went to the Long Bar for a drink but I;ve heard the food at the hotel is excellent.
,,Raffles,4.0,,"We had a nice visit, we had to queue for sometime to get in but a visit to Singapore has to include Raffles!"
,,Wandering the Grounds,4.0,,A beautifully landscaped areas with birds. It is really a throwback in time from the early History of Singapore.
,,Lives up to expectations,5.0,,Having visited several times I am never disappointed. The bar area is lovely with the old fashioned palm fans on the ceiling and the peanuts on the tables. The drinks are a little on the expensive side but everyone expects that at Raffles.
,,Sexy and Historic,5.0,,"Raffles Hotel Arcade is enrichment , I love every steps when I walked in the walking hall. I feel as I am a celebrity and feel about history 100 yeas ago. I love to discover the history from wood, architecture , Singapore Sling and garden there."
,,A must do!,5.0,,Going to Singapore and not visiting the Raffles Hotel would be like going to Paris and not visiting the Eifel Tower! Say no more!
,,singapore slings !!,4.0,,"Quite an experience, very very expensive but had to do it and have the singapore slings after going all that way ! Very handy to access in the city, beautiful city plenty to do........................."
,,Interesting for window shopping,4.0,,"We always like to wander round this Arcade, there is some great high end merchandise to view and some that is more affordable so you can get a souvenir if wanted. We also like to have a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar!"
,,Long bar and Singapore Sling,4.0,,When in Singapore they say the one thing you must do is have a Singapore sling in the Raffles hotel. We walked from our hotel it took about 20 minutes so really needed a cold drink by the time we got here. Well I came I saw I tried the Singapore sling in the place where it was created and it's not a drink I will be having again. I prefered the beer.Had the Singapore sling in the long bar which is situated upstairs in the Raffles hotel. I loved the quirky ceiling fans and the building itself. Go try the Singapore sling in the Raffles hotel you might enjoy it. Great place to have a drink and cool off. WARNING Dont get a peddling taxi we did and paid the price of S$75 each total rip off.
,,the colonial experience,5.0,,"this was a fabulous experience, pure opulence in the 40 degree heat of Singapore, fantastic to see and drink wine. one of the few remnants of a bygone era"
,,"Wow, this place is Amazing",5.0,,"This food hall under the Raffles Hotel is just incredible. The number of eating areas is enormous. About 5 years ago it was totally different and last year changed remarkably. Incredibly busy especially at lunchtime. You cannot book so make sure you arrive at your favourite eatery by at least 11.45 or you could miss out. It is so close to many hotels and the Underground. The Raffles Food Hall come supermarket is the place to buy the very best of any food product, and the freshest you could ask for, but it is expensive. Couldn't recommend it more highly. We always make sure we book a hotel close by and that's where we eat....."
,,Recommend a visit,4.0,,"Lovely building, many shops on the floors of the hotel, some quite expensive, however very good quality. Wandered around the building which is deceptively large, beautiful architecture and lovely garden pockets. Went to Long Bar but long queues, had the obligatory Singapore Sling in downstairs bar, very nice drink but expensive."
,,Raffles Hotel,5.0,,"This place really has the WOW factor, it is a beautiful old building, and is lovely just to stroll through and wish you had the money to shop and stay here. Went to the Long Bar where people were queued up to get in, we couldn't afford to drink here, but it was lovely to look at anyway, and dream! A beautiful old Dame!"
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,Worth a try! Probably the only place in Singapore where 'littering' is allowed and expected :) Serves great food as well.
,,"Odd layout, odd assortment of shops and restaurants",2.0,,"I have to say, while I enjoyed wandering around, the structure is oddly laid out, not well marked (even following the signs led me off the correct path as I searched the Long Bar, for instance) and strange storefronts (shops that are not clearly marked, or locked during the day)...just left me with a ""way past its prime"" feel of the arcade portion of this property."
,,High tea is wonderfull,5.0,,"Very good place for high tea, amazing selection, catering for all tastes and then some. Very good service."
,,Sense of Nostalgia,4.0,,Beautiful row of shops with some fantastic quality souvenirs from Raffles Hotel as well as some very English apparel.
,,Lovely shops at Raffles Arcade,5.0,,"We went to Raffles for a Singapore Sling (as you do whilst in Singapore) and found the shops on the ground floor wonderful for browsing and shopping. Shops include an antiques/art gallery, jewelry and watch shops, Jim Thompson Silks and more."

,,Ok Raffles,5.0,,"I went to Louis Vuitton , bought a LV Bag for my wife and mother. The service there is good. Clean and tidy place... Taxi wise sad..."
,,The only place without a lot of people,5.0,,Don't be scared of loud or smelly people. You will not see them here. Go to high end places such as this and you will enjoy your small walks.
,,Royalty,5.0,,Beautiful shops in a beautiful setting. The hotel is a gem and the outside bar looks like a scene from a movie. The Long Bar and a Singapore Sling...a must!!!
,,Historic singapore,3.0,,"This was my 2nd visit to Raffles Hotel after a 25 year hiatus. I love the architecture and preservation of Raffles Hotel. We had the famous Singapore Sling at the hotel , a little pricey but great experience.Appetizers were small and expensive. I guess one is paying for the atmosphere. It is a must visit to get a sense of the colonial history."
,,What lovely old colonial architecture,4.0,,"Apparently at one time you could see the sea from Raffles, but sadly no longer. If you shut your eyes as you walk the covered verandas, you can imagine the ladies with their parasols and long dresses along with the gentlemen tea planters in their straw hats and canes. The places conjures the imagination. The Long Bar does sustain the imagery somewhat, but is a little lost with the ""blessing"" of mass tourism. Save up for the Slings, really overpriced, but you are only here once!"
,,Interesting range of expensive shops,4.0,,"There was no way we could afford any of the shops but we were still welcomed into the antique shop to have a look and a chat with the lady owner. It was fascinating to talk with her, we were probably lucky as she had just arrived to open up whilst we were looking in the window."
,,Addition to Raffles Hotel,3.0,,"We stayed at the hotel and passed the arcade on our way to a couple of meals. The arcade has a big Jim Thompson silk store and a few other shops, and it's a nice addition to the hotel. But it didn't draw us to make a point to shop. If you need to use one of the shops, it's a pleasant place, architecturally, and can be used while having a drink at a hotel bar that may be open to the public."
,,Expensive drink,3.0,,"Well you have to go here because its there. The Singapore Slings are expensive, but box now ticked, sorted."
,,what a let down.,2.0,,"there is nothing to this place ,hyped out of preposition,4 rums.coke 1 beer 1 sling £70 yes that's right ,a lost cause, a big complex of empty expectations ."
,,A Beautiful Building,4.0,,"We couldn't visit Singapore without going to the Raffles Hotel for a Singapore sling, We didn't have too long to wait on a table. It was a little busy but service was quick."
,,A must do,4.0,,"Raffles is a must do in my opinion the Singapore sling is the must do drink as well we have been here many times over the years old navy trips by my self and mates and with my wife later on in years the long bar is the place to go but can be very happy crowded in the evenings with the expats and trendy people but go to the out door court yard down stairs in the evening and it is cool and very inviting. Do make sure to ask the bar tender to make the drink from scratch, they have a tourist mix in sauce bottles that that use in a rush but in my opinion not as good as one made from scratch you can taste the difference. Meals are reasonable priced but not a place to get settled into for a long night, your wallet will have a fit. Go sit and enjoy a couple of drinks with friends just yo say you have been there."
,,Raffles,4.0,,Raffles Hotel is a 'must stop' in Singapore. Some shops and the Long Bar is compulsary to enjoy a Singapore Sling.
,,Everyone should visit at least once,5.0,,Great to walk around the arcade. Take your camera and read all the historic information plaques and signage. Sample a Sling Observe the front of hotel
,,"The home of the ""Singapore Sling""",5.0,,We spent a very pleasant afternoon in the courtyard (unfortunately the long bar was closed) and enjoy our drinks and the ambiance of this world famous hotel
,,Lunch in a world renowned venue,4.0,,"Had cocktails a light lunch in the Long Bar at Raffles. The Singapore Slings were
delicious and very moreish (even though they were S$31 each). Lunch consisted of a range of light tapas type dishes which were tasty and well prepared. Service was friendly and punctilious.
A great experience."
,,Sir Stamford would probably approve.,5.0,,"Having been told stories in my youth of the Raffles Hotel by both my merchant navy serving Father and by fellow shipmates when I was in the Royal Navy, I was not going to miss the opportunity of visiting this world famous venue and I was not disappointed.
Recent attendees had filled us with tales of cheap and cheerful glitz but I didn't find it so. Yes there are the gift shops and the ATM that sells 5 oz gold bars, but they are minor distractions compared with the history of the location, the splendour of views and the opulence of the wings and courtyards.
We didn't try the Singapore Sling here, having it instead at the sister hotel E&O. Have to say, it was rancid. Cough mixture with added sweetness, yuck.
I think if anybody visits Singapore and does not pop in to the Raffles Hotel then I think you are missing an important part of this regions history. It would be like visiting London and not taking a walk past Buckingham Palace. Your trip would be devalued because of it."
,,Beautiful historic hotel,5.0,,"Well, you have to try their famous Singore sling. It was introduced more than 100 or 150 years ago. I forgot. But it was introduced for females to drink alcohol. But I have to warn you. Since Singpore has a mind of its own, they discourage drinking, smoking, gambling and driving private car. All the above mention will be taxed heavily. So the Singpore sling is the most expensive cocktail I ever have @$37 Singpore dollars! Well, treated that as admission for a museum!"
,,The birth of Singapore Sling,5.0,,"One of the highlights just to visit where the Singapore Sling was created.Shopping for souvenir was too expensive, but the building is beautiful."
,,Changed over the years,4.0,,A great haunt for my navy mates over the years but has certainly changed. High end and lovely place to visit. The building is steeped in tradition and would recommend a beer or cocktail in the bar.
,,A touch of history,3.0,,"The Raffles hotel is world famous however the hotel and the shopping arcade look a bit tired and in need of a renovation. You find the usual shops in the arcade as well as some cafes and restaurants. I would not say that it is a destination in itself, but chances are you will come across/pass by the hotel and then you might as well slender through the arcade."
,,Great selection of Colonial Era items,5.0,,"Located along one wing of the Raffles Hotel there are many shops selling expensive clothing and jewelry but the large gift shop is worth a visit. There you can buy a wide variety of items, enough to create your own Colonial corner at home. From pillows, tableware, linens, teas, chocolates to puzzles, fridge magnets, handbags and silks, there is something for everyone. Expensive but high quality items that represent Raffles."
,,Must do.,5.0,,I don't think you have been to Singapore unless you have visited Raffles. Such a beautiful building with a lot of history.
,,Worth a stroll through,4.0,,Having learned that the Raffles long bar isn't actually the original or even in the original building we couldn't bring ourselves to pay the extortionate prices. Instead we walked in and had a look at the reproduction version and strolled around what is effect an extension to the original hotel which is not accessible to general tourists. However the arcade gives a feel for what it is / was like and costs nothing to see. We celebrated saving a fortune on the alleged gin slings with an Italian ice cream at the pizzeria in the courtyard. The ice cream was better value at a mere $10 and actually rather good.
,,Classy,4.0,,"If your looking for fancy upscale pricey fun visit Raffles. The boutiques and products are amazing. The bars don;t open till 5 PM..so don,t go early. You can even buy gold wafers out of a vending machine"
,,Old,4.0,,This is one of the old surviving building in Singapore.A very good architectural site.A very good selection of shopping.The bar has all the slings including Singapore sling.
,,Good for browsing,5.0,,Good selection of top class shops in a cool and pleasant environment. The Raffles collection shop has some really good souvenirs which you can't get elsewhere. Worth spending an hour or two wandering
,,Home of the Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Yes, we did the tourist thing and went to Raffles Long Bar, and yes, we had one Singapore Sling and an even better Paraduse Sling (there's a menu full of ""Slings."" The ambiance and trip were with the dilly price tag. And their fish and chips - excellent!"
,,Singapore Sling in the Long Bar,5.0,,"Recently visited Singapore and took my wife and mother-in-law to theLong Bar in Raffles to tick of a must see and do on there list of important things to see in Singapore. The atmosphere is very nostalgic and the building is early colonial Singapore with some magnificent historical architecture.

The real reason for the visit was to have a Singapore sling and some peanuts in the Long Bar, after a long day of walking it was the perfect stop to relax for a while and embrace the culture.

If you haven't had a Singapore sling in the Long Bar then you should definitely give it a go, the drinks aren't cheap but then that's not the reason you are going to an exclusive high end hotel to buy a drink, it's all about the experience and I guarantee you will enjoy the moment."
,,Disappointingly changed,3.0,,One of our first stops in Singapore - having visited before and enjoyed it. The Arcade has changed and perhaps not for the better. The shops are lovely and have good things to see but prices have become over the top. The Raffles main gift shop used to sell some good reasonably priced items for souvenirs of the place but that has all changed. Disappointing
,,Historical,5.0,,"Felt very nostalgic visiting the much talked about Raffles Hotel. The buildings and architecture have been lovingly preserved. You have to visit and have one (we had a few) of the famous Singapore Slings - you won't be disappointed,"
,,good morning Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore sling at 10 am bit early but part of our tour, they did however water it down. Is that good or bad ????"
,,Long Bar,5.0,,Queued to get in but its a must you have to visit this iconic landmark. Have a Singapore Sling and Peanuts but take your wallet its not cheap.
,,Expensive but a classic which has to be done.,3.0,,Did this in the evening but probably better during the day. The classic Singapore Sling had to be had and this was not cheap but made up for it with free peanuts on the table. Take your camera and get some shots of the classic hotel and bar. The Long bar is the one that is famous.
,,You cannot go to Singapore without seeing Raffles Hotel Arcade,4.0,,"We loved just walking around, looking in the shops, having a drink, sitting under the beautiful trees on the benches. Everything just felt lovely in this area. Do not miss it."
,,Raffles Hotel,5.0,,"What can I say. A must for a Singapore stopover. Beautiful architecture, full of small exclusive shops. Raffles Hotel gorgeous BUT prices over the top. Singapore Sling U$32; Heineken beer U$24. Thank you as did not have to pay for the peanuts!!"
,,Raffles a must visit.,4.0,,"A must for any visitor to Singapore. My wife had always had a longing to visit Raffles Hotel and try an original Singapore Sling(the main reason for our trip). The Long Bar is the ONLY place to try one. The drink itself costs aprox £18 (expensive for what I thought tasted like a glass of Pineapple juice!) but that did not deter any of the patrons there. The bar was full of mainly British tourists, obviously trying to recreate the colonial days without success! There is NO dress code (much to my wife's disappointment as she had brought a dress just for the occasion) and almost everyone were wearing shorts. Still, a must for any British visitor hankering for the ""old days of Colonialism""."
,,way way over priced,4.0,,"back to the by gone ages with futuristic prices , nearly had a fit paid $31 each for a singapore sling for the 4 of us and the walk 10 strides from the bar to our table cost us another $14 to put the drinks on the table ......rip off ..the place is gorgeous just look dont spend"
,,"its ok, but don't make a special journey",3.0,,"a rather twee arcade with some unusual products, but hardly exciting or varied enough for our tastes. Raffles hotel is a little jaded these days"
,,The Long Bar is a must,5.0,,"The Raffles is a great representation of the colonial periods opulence. A tremendously well preserved hotel that gives you the impression of going back in time. It is Singapore so don't think your visit will be inexpensive, but a stroll through the grounds and a cool ""Singapore Sling"" and peanuts at the Long Bar is an experience long remembered with fondness. If in the area fro Christmas, you will absolutely enjoy the decorations. Take the time to visit and enjoy your memories."
,,Colonial spirit,5.0,,"This is a famous tourist attraction, but it is a must to visit it at least once. Probably wouldn't want to stay here as it is busy all the time. But the architecture is really enjoyable!"
,,Pricey!,3.0,,"We arrived, told we could not sit at the tables as they were for guests. However, we asked another waiter and were kindly seated at a table. Unfortunately we were not given a menu, however we knew we were after the Singapore Sling. Very tastey drink, but for $30 you would expect that. Regular drinks are also groslly overpriced. Beautiful building, stunning at night. Loved the cracked peanut shells on the floor, gave the bar a great personality."
,,Tea at Raffles Hotel Singapore,2.0,,"We had afternoon tea at Raffles Hotel. It was a disappointment - service was fair, food was unremarkable and the tea itself was just OK; certainly not worth the price paid."
,,"You have to go, but only because everyone else has",3.0,,"Raffles Hotel is a colonial gem. But, rather like Venice most of the time, it is so inundated with tourists like me wanting a Singapore Sling [$US34] in the Long Bar that the romantic has escaped. Still the prices in gift shop, tearoom, Long Bar, hotel card will assure you that this still demands money to be a patron or even looker-on."
,,$100.00 us for two cocktails and a small snack,3.0,,"Never has a place survived on reputation like Raffles, went to the Long bar - just to say we had been there! Cocktails were way over priced.. Service was average. Food was amazingly bad.. Been once, can say we have been there.. WONT BE BACK!"
,,Nostalgic but anti-climatic,3.0,,"There didn't seem to be anyone around when we visited around lunchtime, most of the shops closed, and staff out sweeping. Our favourite part was really the water fountain at the end of a green lawn in a quaint slightly sad structure, now dwarfed by the skyscrapers around it. I imagined it might have been more, but maybe we just weren't in the right place at the right time."
,,It is a must.,5.0,,Just for a trip down life past and a Gin Sling. The different shops from Food to Clothing and Souvenirs are all here.
,,Good for a look,3.0,,Over priced goods. Toilet was nice and maintained and air conditioned. Well maintained gardens and nice for photos
,,Raffles such an icon world wide.,5.0,,"Every time I go to Singapore I go to Raffles as I love the grace and elegance of time gone by.This hotel offers so much go the tourist who doesnt stay here.
The beauty of the hotel and the many courtyards as you wander through....the a rcade shops that sell goods that symbolise the legendary Raffles hotel.
Elegance of a bygone era when you book in for high tea complete with a gin sling or two.
If this is not your style a gin sling or another drink in the long bar.
Fantastic place to while away the time let your imagination take over and imagination yourself in the beauty and elegance of a time gone by.
Who would you be and what time would you exist in ?
Personally I would opt for the excitement and elegance of the 1920s."
,,Got money?,3.0,,"Nothing amazing unless you are rich! But still a nice place to dream! We didn't purchase anything, but there were lots of nice things to see."
,,Singapore sling...,4.0,,"We had appetizers and snacks at the Raffles bar where the Singapore sling was invented. next time, the plan is to do afternoon tea there. Such a beautiful, charming old hotel...a classic."
,,Afternoon tea!,5.0,,Iconic afternoon tea. Absolutely loved it! Delightful dining room. The sandwiches are really the most delicious eats! How they make an ordinary sandwich taste so good?! Huge selection of cakes which I didn't manage because I discovered the lavender scones! There was a serious issue with the toilets though!
,,Singapore sling,5.0,,"""We found that raffles long bar is where you would find the Singapore sling, so we both thought as we were in singapore we should try one, we had to que for 20 minutes but it was worth the wait, the atmosphere was really good, didn't like the drink though, the rest of raffles is lovely,can imagine years ago when the hotel was on the sea front, great place fantastic."
,,Icon but now a tourist trap,3.0,,"Sadly over the years has become a Mecca for tourists with the result it is over priced and like a conveyor belt
Child friendly which tells a story
You have to visit once but not a repeat experience
There are much better experiences in Singapore at the same pricing levels
Living on past glories evidently"
,,A dream fulfilled,5.0,,As the title says the Raffles Long Bar was somewhere we wanted to go for many years - and it didn't disappoint. We had the famous Singapore Sling and another cocktail and plenty of peanuts. It seemed strang to throw the peanut shells on the floor but that is the tradition in Raffles. All in all a lovely way to spend a few hours.
,,commercial arcade of souvenir and luxury items,4.0,,Pleasant to wander around the arcade and pick up a few souveniers of the Raffles brand Quite pricey Nice bakery on the ground floor and of course the Long Bar on the second floof home of the Singapore sling Sin$ 31 a throw
,,Has to be done!,5.0,,Had to go to the long bar for the famous cocktail. Lovely building and the long bar takes you back in time. Ok the drinks are expensive but think most people tend to go for one to experience the place.
,,Fun and charming!,5.0,,Charming venue - elegant shops selling jewels to antiques. The public has access to this area so it is a bit congested at times. But set amid the gardens of the Raffles Hotel it is a must see.
,,We simply had to go there !,4.0,,"The Raffles Hotel is an icon of Singapore and this is where the famous Singapore Sling was created so we simply had to go there ! We were not disappointed by the atmosphere , the surroundings and the drink but somehow we expected a bit more glamour in the service ! Oh well , it was only US$25 per drink , so what should you expect from a cheap drink ?"
,,A drink in the Long Bar,3.0,,"The famous Long Bar and Singapore sling cocktail , we all thought the experience was a bit of a let down, no atmosphere and the staff we felt just wanted to get you in and out as quick as they could."
,,just ok,3.0,,something different but worthed to walk around... to enjoy something diffefent in singapore some boutique are closed.. the best walk is in the morning or late afternoon time.. so you can feel the breeze surrounding with colonial feel
,,Simply the best,5.0,,I believe one of the best hotels in the World. My third visit to Raffles nothing has changed and nothing should.
,,Luxury mall,5.0,,"No budget shopping here! Mall is a part of the hotel, has an art gallery and designer clothing store and restaurant. Worth visit and can click a few good shots too."
,,Raffles hotel no longer open to visitors but for hotel guests only,3.0,,"Raffles hotel is one of the most prestigious hotels in Singapore having been around for over 100 years.
The long Bar is its most popular place for those who want to enjoy the best Singapore Sling in town. But the hotel itself is no longer accessible to visitors or tourists unless you are a hotel guest.
If you are not, all you can view is the gardens and surrounding galleries and shops. A pity, I recall a pleasant atmosphere and luxury inside the hotel walking inside long time ago but feel frustrated to be limited to its gardens and surrounding expensive luxury galleries (Arcade) nowadays."
,,"Another ""have to visit"". !!",5.0,,"You have to have a Singapore Sling in ""The Long Bar"" even though it will cost you most of your holiday budget !!!! You haven't lived until you have done this, so ""B"" the expense !!"
,,The famous Raffles Hotel,5.0,,"We weren't fortunate enough to stay but the Long Bar was well worth the visit. What history that hotel offers, just to wander around the grounds, to imagine what it would have been like in it's heyday. Still beautiful and the Singapore Sling in the bar, although not particularly cheap (about S$32 per drink), well you are on holidays so what the heck. The peanuts in the hessian bags on the tables, the old fashioned ceiling fans, all so much fun. And make sure you visit the gift shop. so much to offer for all sorts of budgets."
,,interesting,4.0,,we were not hotel guests but we decided to have a look at the hotel because we had heard so much about it. we sat for a little while at the bar. a singapore sling costs 31.00 but they are potent. They have a nice gift shop and Arcade.Worth looking at
,,Relaxing,5.0,,"I loved this park, we spent may hours here just chilling & watching the passing parade of people bustling about their daily activities..."
,,Cocktail with style.,5.0,,The Singapore Sling in this stylish Hotel didnot disappoint. The custom of throwing your nut shells on the floor was a highlight. The live band was excellent an experience not to be missed.
,,Overrated,2.0,,I felt I had to see Raffles hotel but I'm very glad I wasn't staying there. Touristy and not so impressive. Nice tourist shop but too expensive.
,,Fabulous,5.0,,One thing I have always wanted to do was go to Raffles for the Singapore Sling and I did. Was not disappointed . We went to the Long Bar and sat at the bar along with bags of peanuts. Bliss .. Busy bar with lots of atmosphere and a great cocktail. Another must do.
,,Changes to Raffles Hotel,3.0,,"Raffles has changed over the past three years, and not for the better in my opinion. The courtyard restaurant used to serve examples of local cuisine, but now only serves run of the mill Italian food. The Sunday curry lunches are a thing of the past! How sad."
,,Nice to ennoy this landmark.,5.0,,"If one is not staying at this landmark hotel, it's the closest you can get to it. Beautiful design of the arcades and variety to watch."
,,Good cheap shopping,5.0,,"We stopped here to look for larger sizes, were happy to find good prices and range. Were also found the staff ready to help."
,,Not much to see,3.0,,"In regards to the arcade in side the hotel, I found it a bit uninspiring, a few very expensive shops , the gift shop was interesting and has lots of souvenirs"
,,Taste of the Raj,5.0,,"A beautifully kept immaculately presented Hotel in the heart of Singapore. Lucky enough to have tea here in the Tiffin room ( booked from the Uk,by email with ease) We were greeted by name on arrival at tea by staff who were immaculately dressed, extremely polite and attentive and produces an array of sandwiches, scones, cakes, delightful mango mousse and a dim sum buffet. Also enough tea, cold or hot to float a ship"
,,Old tradition....not worth it,4.0,,"It may have a great long history, but there are many newer and nicer hotels in the Marina Bay area. Go visit their bar."
,,Interesting,4.0,,Everybody who visits Singapore must go to Raffles and I was surprised how quiet it was and how easy it was to wander around the hotel and the arcade. The shops were expensive but it was nice to window shop and of course buying a couple of Raffle souvenirs.
,,Lovely hotel and great Long Bar.,5.0,,"Been before but missed the ""Long Bar"" the last time we visited but it was well signposted now. Loved the traditional layout, Singapore Slings and Peanuts."
,,Amazing high end shopping!,5.0,,What a great place to walk around. Not that I can afford to buy anything but just an amazing place. Did not stay at the hotel but very welcome to walk around the shops and had dinner there. Great antique shop that actually had relics directly from China that were over 1000 years old.
,,must do,5.0,,"We book well in advance, and asked for certain dietary changes is no mayo. We were welcomed and taken to our table. The food was of a very high standard and well presented. We also had Champagne, to add to the occasion.On balance the whole was great but overpriced, but when in Singapore its something you have to do.We also had a Singapore Sling in the Long bar, again the cost 38 pounds for 2 drinks was overpriced."
,,Had to go and see.,4.0,,We had been put off going by lots of comments about it being overpriced and just catering to tourists. But I am glad we went. Of course we had a Singapore Sling and also a couple of beers. Upstairs in the Long Room they had a live band on that were very good and we took some time to walk around the grounds afterwards. We were late so the shops in the Arcade were closed but it is a historic building and we enjoyed our visit.
,,Wonderful architecture,5.0,,"You just must go see the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. It's an Institution. At least go and have a picture in front of it, even if you're not staying ;)"
,,Spent some time walking around th building and taking in some of the splendour and history of it,5.0,,"Awesome building well worth a visit, there is a dress code for diners but visitors are allowed in the building"
,,Raffles Tour,5.0,,Raffles afternoon full buffet was excellent at $103 per person was magnificent with so much to chose from and unlimited. Take the afternoon all inclusive tour including Raffles; part city tour and bum boat cruise
,,This is the best of what is left from the Colonial period,4.0,,There are several shops and a nice out door cafe with excellent pizza. But beware the drink prices are very high. The original Raffles bar has been restored and has the original billiard tables. It is located between the Arcade and the hotel.
,,Just more shops,3.0,,"Of course the iconic Raffles Hotel deserves to be on any itinerary when visiting Singapore. But the arcade itself is really not that special - just a selection of fairly standard shops. It's interesting to walk around and admire the architecture or to have a drink at the Long Bar, but otherwise nothing really special here."
,,Another must visit in Singapore,4.0,,"What to say, the most famous hotel in Singapore and probably all of SEA so you need to at least have a Singapore Sling in the Raffles Long Bar and walk through the grounds of the hotel and Shopping arcade."
,,Shopping with a platinum card.,3.0,,Worth the walk around this historic shopping centre. Everyone rushes for a drink at the long bar. Famous for the peanut shells on the floor but not for anything else. The boutiques in the shopping area are very upmarket and not for those on a budget. It can get very hot and humid as the whole area is open air.
,,You cannot go to Singapore and not at least see The Raffles,5.0,,"You cannot go to Singapore and not at least see The Raffles. More a city landmark than a hotel, the arcade is good to walk through and the hotel good for afternoon tea, although I have never stayed there despite pleading with my wife!"
,,evening visit,5.0,,"Our party of 40 went to Raffles one evening after a city night tour and had our Singapore Sling in the Raffles Bar, and the monkey nut shells were thrown on to the floor. Great Live Music as well."
,,Sling in the Long Bar,5.0,,We had a Virgin Sling & some Wine in the Long Bar with some Chicken wings & had a interesting walk around the hotel . Well worth a visit
,,Nice shopping arcade close to the hotel,4.0,,"Walked through here on my way to a business meeting, have shopped and eaten here before, nice and convenient if you have a meeting in Raffles Tower with IE or if you have a business meeting in the Raffles Hotel"
,,"Lovely architecture, lush gardens, nice for a walk",3.0,,"Super-modern architecture getting you down? The Raffles Arcade is a nice place to go for a stroll, soak up a bit of ""how it must have been back then"" atmosphere. Bakery a bit sterile and disappointing, though."
,,"Singapore sling, just for the hack of it",3.0,,"Stopped in the long bar for an original Singapore sling, which was OK. Not really being a long-drink person it was more because of traditions than anything else. Service and atmosphere was good."
,,Went for a drink,3.0,,When in Singapore you have to have the authentic Singapore sling. We sat and had peanuts and a sling and finished off with a cocktail. The bill for 4 drinks came to AU$106.
,,Great Atmosphere and service,5.0,,A must see and do if in Singapore . Great slings live music and service. The long bar is the place to go to .
,,Old days of Singapore,4.0,,"This is an iconic hotel built in colonial style, probably the first one in Singapore. If it was in Europe, you'd probably pass it without stopping, but here it has character and history. You feel it from the moment the doorman opens a door for you.
Very pricey, but free to go in and look around for yourself."
,,A must!,4.0,,"I said a must because of the history of Raffles, mainly tourists trying the Singapore sling 31$ plus service and tax, and of course all the monkey nuts you can eat, drop the shells on the floor , the reason for this is because the oil in the shells polished the floor?
I went for a pint the most expensive pint I have had $20 + service and tax. Recommend for the experience!
Credit cards accepted!"
,,a wonderful place,5.0,,my partner and I been to Singapore twice and all ways go to raffles just to sit in the long bar just as it was when sir raffles was there you must have a gin sling bit costly we shared one as we do not like gin . but the grounds are great easy to find right next to the war memorial for cilvilians killed during w w 2
,,Must go to Long Bar,4.0,,Yes you will pay $32 for your Singapore sling but the bar and hotel is definitely worth it! The food menu leaves much to be desired but the cocktails are great!
,,A bit boring really,2.0,,"O.K you go because it is ""Raffles"" but there really isn't that much to keep you there. The buildings are pleasant but the atmosphere is dull and a bit life less."
,,Dreaming doesn't cost you anything,4.0,,"Raffles is open to the public and is always neat and clean. Lots of shops and just like Orchard Road, there are no price tags, and in the evenings, the shop windows are emptied; this stuff must be absolute REAL. If you are staying at Raffles, you probably could afford some of these goods; but not on my budget, which starts with a B; that is Bugis Street.

Aside from the shops, there is outdoor dining and I seen some delicious pizza being made; we did end up though having dinner in the Long Bar (see separate review)."
,,Singapor slings at Raffles Hotel,5.0,,Had Singapore slings at the historic Raffles Hotel -Lovely but pricy at £18 each! went back to Pan Pacific Hotel and had them free! Well kept Hotel have to visit the Long Bar and throw nut shells on the floor.
,,pleasant evening,5.0,,we spend amazing evening in the court yard. Food was excellent.Singapore sling was delicious but i really enjoyed chilled red Italian wine.
,,Colonial History epitomized,4.0,,"Raffles is the definition of English Colonialism in the far east and as such no trip to Singpore is complete without a vist to Raffles.
the forecourt is about as close as most people get to the place these days other than the long bar which is now out the back in the extension. Dissapointly we were unable to view the foyer on this vist as it was closed off to the public and for guests only. However I was fortunate enough on a previous vist to be able to walk the grand staircase. hey, if you can get in do so. the smoking rooms, old bars and comfortable leather lounge chairs are straight out of an old english gentlemens club aka Sherlock Holmes, deepest darkest jungle explorer types.
i love it for the history but I could never afford to stay there."
,,A must visit,5.0,,Anyone and everyone visiting Singapore is required to visit Raffles to sample the very enjoyable 'Sling' not necessarily cheap but worth a try!!
,,A visit and reminder of the Colonial Past.,4.0,,Raffles itself has been rebuilt and enjoys a return to the past of ladies and gentlemen Enjoying afternoon tea and no jeans allowed. The shops are opulent and the jewellery is fabulous and service is superb . Singapore Sling was not to my taste but the Raffles fruit punch in the garden bar was fab.
,,Raffles is Singapore,4.0,,It may be a tad pricey to stay at but Raffles has to be visited when you visit Singapore. It's the ultimate Singapore experience having a drink in the bar and seeing the colonial mementos on display in museum
,,Conventional shopping and a world famous bar,3.0,,"The highlight in the Arcade is the bar where visitors by the seeming hundreds venture in order to enjoy a Singapore Sling. The room can get very crowded as people try to drink up the atmosphere and imagine what things were like in the Colonial days before the War. Maybe nostalgia for some, but a curiosity to the new comers. Don't be shocked at the prices."
,,very special,5.0,,highly reccomennd this location as it brings back the opulence and quality of Britains old colonial days a must see hotel and afternoon tea at raffles a big must
,,Must go here when in Singapore,5.0,,Had a lovely evening here with other travellers. Enjoyed the music.and of course THE SINGAPORE SLING. Great evening.
,,Back in the Centuries,5.0,,Perfect choice if you are looking for some shopping in a precious atmosphere. It is a great place to walk around and immagine how Singapore has been in the past.
,,Have your Singapore Sling here!,4.0,,Went here for a Singapore Sling and some high tea. Very nice hotel just passing through. The waiters were great and the location is perfect!
,,"Must do, of course",4.0,,"Visit more for the history, the experience and if it's on the bucket list. Shops here are as you would expect very high end."
,,pretty much oversold,3.0,,"The Raffles is a wonderful old building. The Arcade is a bunch of totally overpriced, snobbish stores. We didn't stay for a Singapore Sling because it was crowded. We though we could do better elsewhere, so we went into the Chijmes complex across the street, where there are many restaurants. It was much less crowded and also a very nice atmosphere."
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,"This is a must do place in Singapore. History seeps from this place. A large hotel with lots of places for tourists to wander. Lovely courtyard for drinks. Sadly the long bar was closed when we visited, but coffee shop served excellent coffee and croissant."
,,Walking into history !,5.0,,"This was one of my must do things for many years, and I was not disappointed ! To see and touch the history of this building was incredible !"
,,Doesnt live up to the hype,2.0,,We were really let down by this hotel in general. Had so many expectations and it didn't live up to any. We had drinks which were so expensive and a rip off. Would not go back nor recommend.
,,Go there for a drink in the courtyard.,4.0,,We always take visitors there for a drink in the courtyard. You can also walk around certain parts of the hotel and the gift shop is also very nice and very big. They have many interesting cocktails on offer in the bar. A classic must go.
,,afternoon tea,5.0,,"afternoon tea was great value for money, the staff were very friendly and attentive. good choice of food and the Singapore slings are amazing"
,,Guess you have to visit if you're in Singapore....,3.0,,I guess you have to visit if you're in Singapore and you're curious about the history. I just stuck around for a quick look and a few photos and left
,,lovely absolutely brilliant,5.0,,This was brilliant and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal experience there. the staff were so attentive and the food was excellent. If you get the chance go. Worth the money.
,,A Singapore legendary location,5.0,,Shopping was special but the big attraction was the Long Bar and it's world famous Singapore Slings. Delicious but ridiculously expensive. $36 CD or $25.00 us but we had to do it!
,,Singapore ICON,5.0,,"When in Singapore one must at least dine and shop at Raffles an icon in itself . This is the hotel in the city, rich in history, bathed in luxury and an experience not to be missed. Stopped by for a quick bite at Ah Teng's Bakery---tasty sandwiches with small salads fit the bill. Shops are expensive but worth a walkthrough before spending your $ elsewhere. There are no bargains here."
,,Worth a Wander,4.0,,"If you love old buildings and what they represent, this place is worth the walk through but the shopping is expensive. Go anyway just to see what all the fuss is about."
,,Must do'ish,5.0,,"Raffles is a piece of history that must be visited and the obligatory Singapore Sling must be consumed. I have no idea what I had tasted before but this drink here, in Raffles, was easily drinkable. They do, however, provide the customer with the smallest peanuts I have ever seen."
,,A Singapore sling or two,5.0,,"We took the bus to Raffles and enjoyed an afternoon sipping on Singapore slings, bags of complimentary nuts, and some lunch. Very beautiful place to see, old world, nostalgic."
,,losing its ambience,3.0,,"been back again to raffles, and it feels more touristy with shops, i suppose i am thinking nostalgically about when it was a real hotel first rather than tourist trap."
,,Raffles Hotel is a must-see site,5.0,,"I always visit Raffles Hotel when I stay in Singapore. It's a hotel with a history with colonial architecture of a by-gone era. Visit Raffles shop with a variety of goods, or Jim Thompson's shop for bags, stylish 't' shirts, and a range of other goodies. Just absorb the atmosphere of Rafflesover a main meal or afternoon tea. All at a very reasonable price in a conducive environment."
,,A Must Go Place,5.0,,Wonderful to be met by the Concierge in all his finery. This is something everyone to Singapore must do. I found the corridors and waterfall and the beautiful foilage and seating areas outside Raffles Hotel outstanding. The shop was full of wonderful items and would have liked longer to look at all the rest of the shops. However a Singapore Sling at the outside bar is a must to Singpore. What decadence!
,,Gorgeous original features,4.0,,"We had to visit for a Singapore Sling ... Staff were great and very friendly, the prices are very high but for a once in a life time run by its a definite visiting place"
,,A Classic Stay,5.0,,"My wife and I spent a romantic weekend here. Its a classic 'must do' experience. Anyone entering the hotel feels like Royalty.
We found ourselves dressing up just to go down to breakfast (after an early morning rooftop swim). Walking through the white stone corridors passed the tall french windows where walls are lined with celebrity guests from another era, Charlie Chaplin, JFK, Churchill, Gatsby, Marylyn Monroe and hundreds more.
The Long Bar and the Singapore Sling could be given a miss but everything else lives up to the hype. Which is rare these days.
Stunning architecture and beautiful internal gardens."
,,What a place!,5.0,,"Spent half of the day in this paradise inside the heaven - from breakfast in Teng Bakery to lunch with Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. Shopping was also interesting, my favorite - Jim Thomson shop."
,,Not worth the money,3.0,,The gift shop is very nice brought some nice gifts.Had tea in the courtyard very dissappointed large thick heavy canteen style cups in red and white.Raffels trades on the name we almost stayed here glad we choice the Pan Pacific much more upmarket also serves tea in bone china cups.
,,As you'd expect,5.0,,"Went for world famous cocktails and wasn't disappointed. Beautiful building, very unique and classic English gent. Extremely classy"
,,"A must, once.",5.0,,"This is a must when in Singapore. The hotel looks beautiful and is a super reflection of the colonial past. You will not be allowed in the hotel itself (unless you are staying there of course) but will be allowed in the gift shop! And you also have access to the Long Bar where you can enjoy a Singapore Sling, surely the main reason most people visit. We both really enjoyed our visit and the Singapore Sling was much better than others we had tried. Would we visit Raffles for another Singapore Sling if we visit Singapore again? Probably yes."
,,Where they invented the Singapore Sling,5.0,,The place is full of history and character. The courtyard is beautiful. i can only imagine what this was like when it first opened.
,,Lunch in the Courtyard,4.0,,This is a very pleasant setting with good Italian food. You will not get access to the other parts of the hotel if you eat here but you can certainly get a feel of the colonial past. The Gin Sling is of course overpriced but worth it for the experience. We were slightly disappointed with the service here- we waited in vain for someone to take our order for dessert and in the end didn't bother. It was about to rain and maybe the staff had other priorities e.g. moving tables.
,,One to Cross Off the Bucket List,4.0,,"How can you go to Singapore and not go to Raffles? The Singapore Sling was 100 years old last year and still costs a fortune. The hotel itself looks amazing and has some great shops within the complex, but 'the sling's the thing'. Not cheap at $29, about £14.50, but an absolute must. Do NOT miss it if you are there!"
,,Full moon at Christmas viewed from the inner courtyard!,4.0,,"Such was my experience, and it was charming because of the elegant surroundings that honor the history of the hotel and the style it is trying so hard to keep - and succeeding at it, fortunately! I had dinner there in the open upon my arrival in Singapore, an Italian dish of pasta and pesto: I could not expect it to be inexpensive, and I was right. The location and the full moon made it memorable, but even without the full moon this is a place to visit when you are in Singapore."
,,Afternoon Tea at Raffles,5.0,,We enjoyed afternoon tea as part of a sightseeing tour. A visit to Raffles is a must and the afternoon tea is lavish and served in a very ornate dining room. A perfect reminder of the colonial past of the city. Smart casual dress is required and most people present had made the effort to pay respect to the elegant surroundings. The gift shop is useful for those 'special' souvenirs not found in the everyday shops but prices are high.
,,Inspiring,4.0,,Inspiring Nice with open court yard in the fresh air Has restaurant in the yard Great shops and many yards Lovely fantastic plsce
,,Beautiful historic buildings,4.0,,lovely place to wander in the gardens and along the wide cool verandas. Lots of small shops with all kinds of interesting wares.
,,Essential to visit,4.0,,Iconic to visit with beautiful surroundings. Went to the Long Bar and drank a Singapore Sling but I think $32 is a bit expensive
,,Had cocktail dinner at The Raffles Hotel,5.0,,"Witnessed the preparation of The Singapore Sling, an exotic cocktail by the Master bartender at The Raffles..I didn't drink it though.... Ha ha !"
,,Take your wallet - full!,3.0,,We visited here as part of a Singapore by night tour. Interesting history and famous for the Singapore Sling drink. I don't like gin so I opted for the beer instead. I bought two Tiger beers and it was $47.00 Singa. You do the math!
,,You just have to go see!!!,5.0,,"What a wonderful experience we had, a Singapore sling in the Long Bar, could make out what all the mess was on the floor,but the give you a bag of monkey nuts with your drinks, in the end you join in and put you're shells on the floor!!"
,,"Got to have a sling or two,",5.0,,"Not a cheap thing to do but when in Singapore we went to raffles for a singapore sling. They now come in a variety of flavours but all are around $30+ which hurts a bit! Enjoyed a sling and then went down to the courtyard to have lunch. There some good deals here for sharing a meal and keeping the costs down. Make sure that you are Hungary as this is a plentiful deal and we were stuffed when we left. The food is Italian and there is something for everyone. Try it, you might like it."
,,long bar,4.0,,we had to go for the famous singapore sling expensive but well worth it you have to wait to be seated and then shown to your table we asked to sit at the bar and had to wait a bit longer gets busy worth a visit
,,So wanted to get to Raffles and totally loved it!,5.0,,"Have wanted to get to Raffles for a long time so now been there and done that and delighted we did!
Highly recommend going to the Long Bar and drinking on a Singapore Sling - the only place to drink it where it was invented. The hotel is glorious with fabulous patios and palm trees.
If you want to purchase souvenirs there is a wonderful gift shop with amazing items to purchase - from relatively inexpensive all the way through to dearer items.
Staff and service was excellent. We visited just before Christmas so it was fabulous to see all their Christmas decorations even though the weather was 34 degrees outside!"
,,LOVELY OUTSIDE ARCADE - WORTH THE EXPERIENCE,4.0,,"Stopped for a Singapore Sling and a cuppa tea just to experience Raffles though you are not able to go into the hotel unless you are a guest. The garden and arcade are delightful. Expensive drinks (we expected it!) and a pricey souvenir shop with everything Raffles but if you are looking for that little different gift, this is the place to shop. So glad we went."
,,Grand Architectural aspect,5.0,,A must visit if you are in marina Bay area. The architectural aspect of the building is well-preserved and you can imagine it's grandeur as Old Post office during Colonial time.This is the one of the few remaining heritage buildings amongst Marina Bay
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,Lovely building and especially at night when it is all lit up. The shopping arcade is very quiet with top brand shops. Worth popping in if you are around the area.
,,Interesting but overrated,3.0,,Quiet colonial retreat. No longer a hotel but a shopping arcade full of expensive outlets. Singapore Sling was twice as expensive as in our hotel. You pay for the location.
,,lovely at night all lit up,5.0,,"raffles hotel is lovely at night, was all lit up, long bar was surprisingly quiet, i was a bit disappointed that some slings were unavailable, the one i had was nothing special and very pricey at 34sd, but the ambiance was good. Lots of shops in the grounds."
,,I loved the old Raffles,4.0,,"We went in the old Raffles in1978 and we loved it,,the new Raffles is nice you must have a look round visit the Long bar,still its to modern for me, give me the old long bar. out in the court yard you can order food and have a drink under the stars its in a beautiful setting"
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Definitely pop in for a Singapore sling !! or partake of an excellent evening meal. You get a real atmosphere of its colonial past and steeped in Singapore's history
,,Raffles hotel,4.0,,"A must see, although tourists are directed towards the souvenir shop first. Lots of empty spaces, lovely decor. We saw a wedding taking place in the grounds. No shade outside once you have finished the tour so make sure you have transport it is extremely hot to walk."
,,Stylish Singapore Slings and shopping,5.0,,"We enjoyed appropriate refreshment in the Long Bar, obtained souvenirs in the shopping arcade and enjoyed our visit. Unfortunately, non-residents cannot just walk in to the actual hotel but that did not detract from our visit."
,,Step back in time,5.0,,Beautiful building and Singapore Sling is a must in the bar. Not cheap but worth the experience. Recommend the gift shop- good quality and lots of choices- make sure you visit all the rooms as the souvenir glasses are hidden down the back.
,,More designer shops,3.0,,After a drink in the long bar we mooched around the arcade. Shops are upmarket designer units that were lacking customers. The best bit was the arcitecture and wonderful staircase.
,,Nice arcade,3.0,,Good variety to the all day activities in Singapore during daytime. Expensive for European standards.
,,Tourist trap,3.0,,"Raffles has the name, but unfortunately that was a long time ago. Bad service and the bar is one big tourist trap for mostly old people."
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,I visited Raffles Hotel on our last day of our trip. My wife & I had drinks & lunch in the Long Bar. Lunch & the Singapore slings at the Long Bar were excellent. It is well worth visit!
,,Raffles hotel arcade,5.0,,These are small designer shops inside the famous raffles hotel. You get all good high quality items here .
,,"Old Structure, Not Worth a Visit Unless You Have Spare Time",3.0,,"Just an old, historic structure, currently being used as a hotel. Visitors are allowed to visit the shopping arcade (and maybe buy some expensive things). Some areas of the hotel are out of bound for tourists."
,,For the top 1% only ... except to look,4.0,,"This arcade is beautiful and caters to the ""beautiful"" people. Expect to see gorgeous shops with outrageous prices. High quality, higher prices. Orchard Road is just as good and far more reasonable (well maybe not ""far"")."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"It's ships , but set within the colonial age building of raffles so slightly more interesting than some , we did find a good Taylor which we used jacks , it's just more ships though , there is no end of them here"
,,Many Great Shops,5.0,,Great place to shop on rainy day. Many wonderful shops and the hotel shop is the best of all. Lots of souvenirs. Super bakery and open court for pizza and lunch. Of course the bar is perfect for a Singapore Sling (about $26) Wanted to learn more about Raffles so bought a book on the history. Even bought some Christmas presents you would not find elsewhere.
,,A must visit place,5.0,,Raffles does not disappoint.Great to see that the place is alive with cultural activities. beautiful gardens are being well maintained and fully utilised. well done Raffles!
,,Great fun and classy,4.0,,"Really interesting area to wonder, historic and well looked after. Shops are ok, in fact, the souvenir shop for the hotel is possibly one of the best I've had to wonder around!"
,,touristy,3.0,,went here like all the other tourists to have a Singapore sling at it's birthplace and got exactly what we expected. An overpriced drink in a faux Hemmingway bar - perfect
,,Must do in Singore,5.0,,You just have to go to Raffles Long Bar and have a Singapore Sling. Great experience...but a bit touristy now.
,,a must see bit of history,4.0,,"Sure this is touristy and it is expensive, but this gem holds a lot of history and it is a beautiful building that is well-preserved. The Long Bar (home of the Singapore Sling) is a lovely space to spend a couple of hours sipping a Sling. The true highlight of Raffles, though, is the High Tea. The food is spectacular and the atmosphere is wonderful. This was a highlight of our visit to Singapore."
,,Original,5.0,,If you want to see the old contrasted with the new...this is it. Also get a real Singapore Sling. Don't try to get into the lobby as it is not for tourists! Whoops! We got in somehow and it is a very small lobby...don't try. We are sorry....honest! See the gin bathtub!
,,Really?,3.0,,"Everyone says you must do this. Not sure why, as it's a bar with no atmosphere and expensive drinks that can be bought anywhere. This was the most expensive drink I've bought and although was lovely, not worth the cost really.
Raffles is a colonial hotel but nothing special to look at. The long bar is what it says, a long bar counter with monkey nut shells all over the floor."
,,Singapore sling at raffles,4.0,,"Well we had to do it, a trip to raffles long bar and the hotel arcade.
We went late after 6pm and the shop was about to close when we got there. the long bar was a bit disappointing I expected something more spectacular but maybe thats my fault. It was hard to find up several flights of stairs and very dark and dingy inside. the atmosphere was good wit a band playing and the Singapore sling was OK but cost an arm and a leg( not worth it in my opinion. We left after a hour, took 20 minute to get served."
,,Here is a place where you can empty your pockets post haste,4.0,,Well what a fine collection of boutiques and bespoke tailors. Not the place to go bargain hunting. But if you want a tailored jacket or some shirts you'll be accommodated at reasonable rate - not cheap but then its personal and quick - 48 hours for a jacket from Jack's Custom Tailoring. Happy to recommend not so sure I want a camera or watch for which I could buy a reasonably priced car if you get my drift.
,,beautiful building,5.0,,"So much history and service here. 100 years of the Singapore Sling, 50 years as independent nation, so much to celebrate. Outdoor bars, plus omelette and pizza stations in the courtyard, what's not to like. A unique gift shop not unlike the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego."
,,Looks like it is having difficult time,2.0,,"My second visit here and I was surprised at the lack of tourists, shops, and lunchtime restaurant closed. What has happened?"
,,Iconic Singapore Hotel,5.0,,"When you're in Singapore you have to spend an hour or so visiting the Raffles. The accommodation section is rightly closed to visitors but the Arcade and restaurants or worth the stroll. The Halia had great food at an affordable price, but unfortunately the atmosphere of the restaurant was a let-down."
,,Disappointed...,3.0,,Not able to enter the hotel lobby. Only the outside bar... The hotel is now outdated and needs attention to detail. I did not order the typical Singapore Sling as I felt it was a tourist trap set up...sorry
,,When in Rome,3.0,,"Ok, the Singapore sling is famous and this is the home of it. We enjoyed our sling and eating peanuts, but to be honest it is a premixed drink that is very expensive $76 for 2. But it is an experience to say you have done it."
,,Over-hyped a bit,3.0,,"Nice walk around hotel arcade and courtyard. Enjoyed a Singapore sling in the long bar, custom of throwing empty nut shells all over the floor was new to us! Bit overpriced like regular tourist traps. Main hotel lobby exclusively for guests which was disappointing."
,,Gorgeous but packed with tourists,5.0,,"The creamy white architecture is divine and the shops are high end. Unfortunately, this is a major tourist attraction and consequently it is filled with clueless tourists wearing tour group badges, shorts and black knee socks, jostling their way to the Long Bar. It is a shame to see the Raffles Hotel atmosphere cheapened like this."
,,How can you not go there?,5.0,,"Raffles Hotel is not only a Singaporean icon, it is an icon of the former British Empire and as such it has to be visited just for that. A must -see when in Singapore."
,,Part of a guided tour,4.0,,"This taster, including a complimentary Singapore Sling, left us very impressed. We had plenty of time to wander around this extensive complex, including shopping and tiffin. We will be returning for a proper stay in a couple of months time"
,,Lovely little arcade,5.0,,Beautiful place to stroll around some beautiful little shops also nice to stop for a drink and some food here at the same time...really nice worth a visit.
,,Great Historic Hotel,4.0,,It was great to visit such an iconic Hotel where the atmosphere lived up to expectations. A must when visiting Singapore.
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,Has good music at night at the Long Bar and The Singapore Sling is very nice. Can use MRT to get off at City Hall or Bugis rather than get rip off by taxi.5 minute walk from either train stations
,,Singapore $$$ Sling = Ripoff,3.0,,Had to drop into the long bar and try the famous Singapore Sling. Look it was really nice but at like $38 each its a bit of a ripoff. Try it to only say you've done it and tick it off the bucket list
,,Most beautiful Hotel,5.0,,"Memories of this Hotel. It's just beautiful, take photos, spoil yourself. Have High Tea. Absolutely adoring. The staff are very friendly the rooms are most beautiful."
,,Iconic experience,5.0,,The bar has now been moved from the Long Room. The drinks are expensive but it's a 'must do' experience. Pleasant surroundings in the hotel. You can also book afternoon tea which looked amazing.
,,Afternoon Tea,5.0,,A wonderful old building from the colonial period to have afternoon tea which was excellent. The singapore sling was very memorable in a great setting.
,,"Shops, restaurants and the Long Bar",5.0,,Good place for shopping whilst you are wandering around waiting for your time at the Long Bar. Great places to eat and while away your time in the Courtyard.
,,Great Singapore slings!,5.0,,Visited for a Singapore sling during our sightsee day. Beautiful old hotel with plenty of charm. Long bar was gorgeous. Cocktails even better!
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"Came here whilst in Singapore to try the Singapore Sling, the building is just beautiful. We were in the long bar and the Singapore sling was just amazing (so I had a few) it is expensive, but worth a visit."
,,"Touristy but a ""Must do""!!!",5.0,,You have to have a walk around the grounds of Raffles whilst in Singapore. It will pass a couple of hours and is full of information and photo opportunities.
,,A bit disappointing,3.0,,"Perhaps I went on a quiet day, but the shops seemed empty and so I wasn't inclined to go into any of them, the narrow corridors were lined with greenery in some places which was nice, but the overall feel was deserted."
,,quick visit,4.0,,"just called in for a quick look around, very colonial ,expensive but only to be expected. Central location, near to all public transport."
,,A historical Place,5.0,,"wanted to visit the hotel which has been part of the history of Singapore, but then thought of taking the photos only when our hop-on hop-off bus stopped here...so just saw the building from outside, looked grand and magnificient...can visit if some more days are there..but we skipped because our trip was only 5 days..."
,,A snap at raffles hotel...,5.0,,Good place to go and have lunch.visited on office party and it's an very ambitious place to spend time. They provided very good lunch.
,,Worth stopping in for a drink!!,4.0,,"we used the ""hop on hop off"" bus to get to Raffles, great spot, we went upstairs to the bar and had a few drinks! you get to eat peanuts just like the old days, and throw the shells on the floor! a great trip back in time, as i don't think much has changed from the British colonial days inside the hotel. the bathrooms are magnificent!!"
,,Afternoon Tea at Raffles,5.0,,The afternoon tea was a delightful experience but you must book in advance as it is so popular. Not only do you get the traditional afternoon tea but there is also a buffet with hot and cold food.
,,a must,5.0,,the famous raffles is a must we went on a tour to raffles organised by the hotel we were staying it took in other places of interest. We went to the upstairs bar which had a good band playing we were given our world famous SINGAPORE SLING we were also fed on monkey nuts and allowed to throw the shells on the floor quite a rarity for such a clean county as it was Christmas time the hotel was decked out with Christmas decorations
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,"A must see, very enjoyable. Family friendly. Had a Singapore sling in the gardens. Quite expensive, however a great visit. The building and gardens take about a half day to enjoy."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,You cant leave Singapore without visiting this historic hotel and the arcade where you can find a lot of unnecessary but classy stuff. Dont forget to take a nice picture.
,,Best way to see the hotel,3.0,,"Raffles hotel is open only to residents, so the only way to see it - apart from the lobby - is to visit the shopping arcades that have been built around the arches that surround the main building. All quite high-end boutiques with prices to match, it's still the best way to experience colonial Singapore."
,,Must Do,4.0,,"Raffles Hotel is a MUST , spectacular building, and worth the high cost of a Singapore Gin Sling - wonderful building."
,,What a beautiful place,4.0,,"This is one of the best place that we have been to but in the same breath I think it is also very expensive and very retail oriented. Singapore with its limited space anyways offers tighter squeeze at lots of places.

But even in Singapore's major places to visit this will be one of things to do"
,,Magic place the best in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the second times for me to sleep here and Massimo Moreschini the Italian Manager take care this Hotel like he was the owner.
The service is the best and the rooms are big clean and lovely.
The hotel is not too big with almost 100 rooms but in the heart of the city."
,,"Go there once,see the colonial building",3.0,,have a gin sling at the bar gallery is nothing to write home about expensive shops for the upmarket mobile person.
,,One of the Old fashion Bar,5.0,,"We visited Bar of this hotel with our tour, and saw hundreds of people waiting to seated, due to the advance reservations we were able to get in ASAP Live music was going on, all visitors were enjoying peanuts and historical authentic Singapore Sling.
we did tried non alcoholic Singapore sling which good. This historical hotel won't let you in if you are not staying there. Its nice and beautiful historical hotel of Singapore."
,,A cooler walk,4.0,,Interesting place to see the old architecture and out of the sun.Shame it is surrounded by roads and high rise flats
,,best singapore sling,5.0,,Its a 'must do' whilst in Singapore. Not well signposted from the MRT and a bit of confusion on our part getting in. The Long Bar was very welcoming we where seated and served quickly.. A great experience
,,Worth seeing the facade,4.0,,"Although we did not enter the hotel, walking or driving by the hotel is worth your time because it is a historical landmark in Singapore. It is interesting to note the hotel was once ""beach front"" property. However, now there is reclaimed land in front of the hotel."
,,Rip off,1.0,,"This used to be a special place or visit but it's been Disney'd but not in a good way. Any historic authenticity is just about eroded and the gardens looked tired. The whole place is now a ""retail opportunity"". There is nothing except the gardens to recommend a stop here and they aren't so wonderful."
,,"A cliche, but you have to do it anyway",4.0,,"Sip a lovely Singapore Sling in the Long Bar, whilst munching on the complimentary peanuts. The drinks are expensive, but who cares? You may never get to do this again."
,,This place is amazing in general!,4.0,,The Raffles Hotel is a very charming place to visit and sitting at the bar drinking my Singapore Sling was a lovely experience!
,,Must visit,4.0,,It is a place to visit for a Singapore sling. We went at around 17:00 hours and couldn't get into the long ballroom so we had our drinks in the court yard.
,,Imagine you're back in the 30s,5.0,,"Don't let anyone tell you Raffles is not worth a visit, or that you can get a Singapore Sling cheaper elsewhere. If you're in Singapore and want a Singapore Sling, go to the Long Bar at Raffles, order a SSling, enjoy the charming, polite service, and step back in time and imagine yourself back in the 1930s. Also enjoy wandering freely around the cool balconies and courtyards to get a feel of times gone by."
,,Long Bar,4.0,,"Well worth the visit even though the Singapore Slings cost £16.00 a glass. The decor is beautiful, the atmosphere is great and you cannot visit Singapore and miss this."
,,Heritage Arcade,5.0,,Beautiful old world charm with great value and variety. Shops have high quality products which are not available elsewhere .
,,Colonian Singapore at its best,4.0,,have a look at the various upmarket botique shops and brands as you window shop your way across the arcade
,,History,5.0,,"What a beautiful place, just a wander through shows the history this hotel and its surroundings holds. A Singapore sling was the other thing that's a must."
,,Step Back in Time,5.0,,"Loved this old world place and immediately felt like riff raff that had snuck in! It's gorgeous with beautiful gardens (sit in some of the intimate areas with little fountains). You can reserve for tea time at $60 pp (Singapore dollars) for a three tier tray of pastries, sandwiches and tea...or go upstairs to the Long Bar and have a Singapore Sling, $36 (Singapore dollars) invented here by a bartender to allow ladies of the times to have alchoholic drinks while looking like they were discreetly sipping their fruity drinks. The whole shabby atmosphere made me feel like I had stepped back in time and I took my time in the bar, and was glad I did considering the price of my cocktail. Loved the place and the ambience! I went thru the gift shop but any gift shop that has a cooling room for magnums of champagne is way too rich for my blood!...but what a thing!"
,,Lovely to see but expensive to drink,4.0,,"We stopped to have a look and the hotel was extremely classy and demure but there were many areas we could not sit at as we were not guests there. The infamous Raffles bar was lovely but the cocktails were ridiculously expensive, like $25, beer $15 and wine $19 per glass. I know its a classy place but I didnt think these prices were justified."
,,Nice place to walk around at night time,4.0,,The ambiance around the hotel area was very nice. Colonialism stylish of this place is spectacular. If you are in the area should pay little visit
,,must see.,5.0,,"Come visit, bring your camera.

You don't get to say that you visited Singapore unless you've been here! The building area itself is surprisingly accessible, as Raffles has separated off a large museum/shop/arcade area from the hotel proper, so you can still walk around the grounds and a fair bit of the building without actually having to be a member. Excellent for those who just want to snap pictures and take photos.

There is a nice, reasonably priced cafe on the ground floor, although my personal favourite is the verandah - their iconic Singapore Sling is not to be missed, I have not had a better one yet! You can even walk up to the famous writer's bar and there is a positively gorgeous gift shop (as well as a drool-worthy antiques and Leica shop) that are well worth a rummage through.

Pro tip: Check out some of the stories and the famous events first, so that when you visit you can 'put a face to the name' and imagine those stories taking place in the beautifully traditionally styled rooms as you visit - my personal favourite? The tiger under the Billiard table :D If you are finding it hard to research, the drinks menu has a timeline of cocktails that were invented and the reason why, and the gift store has some wonderfuly books on the history of Raffles."
,,i wish i could afford to stay here,5.0,,this hotel doesnt have rooms. only suites. just drinking a coffee here cost you an arm and a leg. still if you like old world class this is a must see.
,,Get down at this MRT stop!,4.0,,"A must visit place for anyone in Singapore. Get down at the Raffles MRT and walk your way through the Raffles place. One would never make out that it is a post office turned into a hotel. They have preserved it very well, adding only to the beauty to it. The place is a beauty to watch. I have heard that the prices are a bit too high. But still would suggest visiting this place. Worth the visit!"
,,Good for Celebrity Spotting...,3.0,,We were there for the F1 grand prix last year and went in for a drink. The boys had beer and I resisted the tourist cliche of a Singapore Sling and had water instead. It is a charming place and it was exciting to be sitting within spitting distance of Bob Geldof. Some of us are easily impressed :-)
,,Visit if you want specific brands as shopping is truly unrushed here,5.0,,"Very exquisite brands and tailors here; CYC Tailor, LV Boutique, german camera shop, antiques, art gallery, restaurants. even a stroll just here is great as the hotel arcade though small has large walking corridors and looking into the courtyards, the view and feel is great. Occasionally you may meet wedding couples and/or models having their photography in this hotel and nothing is rushed here. i would when time permits, take a stroll in this historic building and pick up a few things when I spot interesting pieces."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,A lovely place to visit have a good look around and take the armed guard for the wallet if buying Singapore Slings share one with a bus load of rich friends
,,Touristy,3.0,,We didn't really plan to go here but ended up here by accident. Lots of tourist go there to have the classic singapore sling drink which is not actually in the Raffles Hotel but in a new section built to accommodate this popular pastime. The arcade had shops to attract the tourists and weren't tempted to buy.
,,A Singapore Sling !,5.0,,"Well, this was a really strange experience. My husband and I could not wait to have our Singapore Slings at this iconic hotel. Like others we bypassed the expensive arcade of meaningless shops and headed straight for the Long Bar. Upon entering, it felt like we were taking part in a Hollywood movie. Nothing seemed quite real. They have tried hard to recreated the atmosphere of old, but maybe they are trying too hard. Still well worth the visit. The Hotel is a beautiful old building, sitting majestically in the middle of modern Singapore. Singapore Slings cost $31 plus tax and service charge."
,,Compulsory if you visit Singapore,4.0,,"A huge place, all very pricey. I knew I couldn't afford anything so bypassed the shops and went straight for the bar. Had a glass of red wine as I don't like the Singapore Sling. Expensive and they decant it into a terracotta jug before pouring into your glass, which I couldn't see the point of really! Just more washing up! Lovely setting though and the bar staff are very attentive and polite."
,,Should be on your itinerary,3.0,,"The arcade of shops are expensive, but nothing to write home about. If you are not pushed for time, then include this in your trip and pop into the Long Bar and enjoy the world famous Singapore Sling (pricey but fun)."
,,Cocktails at Raffles,3.0,,"The Singapore Slings aren't cheap in the recreation of the Long Bar, which strives to feel authentic but somehow doesn't. It feels like something you should do rather than something that's a highlight of your visit."
,,Lunch at raffles,4.0,,"Together with my Husband ,Daughter ,her friend and our Son we booked for Lunch at Raffles,Elegant and Boisterous ,We nibbled on Peanuts regularly throwing shells onto the floor a sis the norm at Raffles,over head fans sway, the atmosphere is Grandiose and Relaxing as are all places in Beautiful Singapore, Scrumptious mini Burgers accompanied with ..yes. .Singapore Slings ..mmm Just Wonderful."
,,"A must do, but not much to it",3.0,,"Visiting Raffles gave me a brief respite from the heat of the day. The lobby is friendly and welcoming. I liked the architecture of the hotel property.

I took the time to have a cold beer at the bar. You can order the Singapore Sling, but it is not cheap.

It is only a few blocks from a subway station."
,,Everybody does it,3.0,,"Every tourist does it, but be prepared to be disappointed. The shops are very expensive. Have your pic taken with the doorman - they are always ready to oblige. The Singapore sling in the Long Bar is the other attraction, again not cheap"
,,singapore sling,5.0,,"you go to singapore, you need to have a sling from raffles. the bar with all the peanut shells and antique set up in excellent"
,,A must visit for every tourist and most locals,5.0,,Raffles is Iconic and the arcade and courtyard are totally free. Always have a great photo done with the doorman and were do all those Rolls Royces come from. The shops in the arcade are very pleasent always seem to buy something and always either afternoon tea of the Long Bar most time's both. The courtyard terrace bar is always very popular as well
,,Piece of History.,5.0,,"1st stop in Singapore on a week trip.
Head for the long bar which is located at the rear of he hotel on the 1st floor but be prepared to queue in the busier periods.
We managed to get in on a late afternoon visit and perched ourselfs up the
famous bar and drink a Singapore sling cocktail....drinks are pricey but I don't think it really mattered £14 for the slings but worth every penny.
Hotel itself is a very large house with designer shops on ground floor.
Nice garden with outside bar area.
Get your camera ready for the grand entrance of the hotel and spectacular doorman in traditional dress."
,,Famous landmark for Singapore,3.0,,"Once the swanky place for all the rich and famous, including Japanese senior officers during the Japanese army occupation of Singapore in WW2, This Hotel has very high standards and prices to match. Five star, and the services and facilities are what you would expect. Even the gents toilets are 'dripping' with gold plumbing (I kid you not!) and the atmosphere in the famous Long Bar is a mixture of the Journalist, Poet, Artist, the 'In' people of Singapore Society, and definitely the place take anyone you wish to impress! Wonderful old world atmosphere but up to date in everything else. A must visit, especially for their famous afternoon high teas."
,,No cads seen!,5.0,,Stopping over in Singapore for a few days en route to a conference in Australia I walked down to Raffles Hotel just for one small cold dear beer in the famous long bar where the Singapore Sling was invented for the local cads!. One of those places one feels obliged to visit and it was a pleasant wee break. Suggest you also take in the adjacent photo displays and high class small shops.
,,Home of the Singapore Sling,5.0,,"The Raffles hotel, a historic landmark, is worth a look just for the architecture, but is best known for inventing the Singapore Sling. The drink is extremely expensive, as is all alcohol in Singapore, but worth being able to brag that you had a Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore!"
,,Very expensive,3.0,,Looked around shops. To buy a momento will cost dearly. A small dish for tea bags was nearly £12. Much as I would like something it wasn't worth the money. Having said that we did enjoy looking around
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,Had to visit just to say we had been to Raffles and had a Singapore sling in the long bar. Good experience but drinks expensive but as we said we may only pass this way once so had to be done.
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,A visit to Singapore isn't complete without a visit to the Long Bar at Raffles Hotel for a Singapore Sling and the opportunity to toss your peanut shells onto the floor
,,Must do,5.0,,You cannot visit Singapore without going to Raffles! Best Buy in the gift shop is the set of Raffles tea spoons. Visit the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling.
,,Afternoon tea at Raffles,4.0,,"How amazing ! First your excited to be going (you must book in advance, but can get slots on the day) - we pulled up to the front of the building - and a wonderfully dressed guy helped us out of the cab and into the building. YOu do get caught up in the pom of it all straight away. We had a wonderful afternoon tea with a beautiful woman playing the harp - the service was impeccable and the food amazing. I will always remember afternoon tea at Raffles!"
,,Arcade larger than hotel,4.0,,We walked around the Raffles buildings and the arcade is full of expensive stores. We walked around quite a bit only to find out the hotel itself is small. Non guests were not allowed into the hotel so we did not have a chance to see inside. The long bar which is famous for the invention of the Singapore Sling was on the second level of the Arcade. It was definitely expensive as it was $31 SGD a drink! Had to do it as it was the 100th anniversary of the beverage.
,,Historical colonial inheritage with hotel and luxurious shops. A must visit !,5.0,,Raffles Hotel Arcad is a place I never miss when staying in the lions city. My second home after the south of France.Its a beautiful oasis of calm and serenity in this busy city. The Arcades are part of the world famous historic RAFFLES SINGAPORE. A legend hotel with famous guests. A must visit for every guest coming to this place iis the Raffles gift shop. I buy regularly there souvenirs for friends. Other luxurious shopsare at your disposal. I recommend you to visit thisn place and take afternoon tea in the Hotel. Enjoyr your stay !!!!
,,Must see.,5.0,,"Wonderful old hotel with lots of history. High tea was impressive but spoilt by a couple of patrons complaining. Must have Singapore sling ! Food delicious, service the best."
,,Raffles,3.0,,Everything about Raffles is expensive. But a walk through the small arcade is quite an experience. Some lovely places and things to look at.
,,A must visit,4.0,,Nice to visit and say you've been but everything is very pricey including the Singapore Sling. Just walk around and enjoy the ambiance
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,Disappointed afternoon tea was served with a tea bag and cup. Also didn't have time to queue to get into the long bar.which is worth a visit. We had a Singapore Sling in the court yard.
,,The Rolls Royce that is Raffles.,5.0,,"Raffles Hotel will introduce you to the best Singapore sling. As you make your way to the bar, feel the crunch of the peanut shells under your shoes. It still today houses that intoxicating blend that is colonial design at its best with sheer luxury and a wealth of history since the opening of its doors in 1887. You will reminisce over the dignatories, great writers, politicians and members of royalty that have graced this Heritage Hotel. Raffles Hotel has still held its title of ""Romance of the Far East"". Its signature suites, Butlers and fine cuisine is simply elegance at its best."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,This is worth going to just to have s poke around Raffles. It is just shops and a bar neither of which are ultra special but when in Singapore you have to go to raffles...
,,We love this place,5.0,,"A great place to wander around and check out unique shops and get a sense of this iconic hotel at the same time. The is an excellent Italian/pizza restaurant in the center, another place besides The Long Bar to enjoy a Singapore Sling."
,,Great done on a tour,5.0,,Did this one on a tour seen the hotel with is a great old hotel lots shopping. I also had the Singapore sling even for the price worth it to have in the long bar
,,The Raffles is an icon of a long gone by era,4.0,,"The Raffles Hotel rests on a yesteryear reputation. It is an impressive whitewashed building with many courtyards. They say one has not been in Singapore when the Raffles Hotel was not visited.
Noticeable is the very long bar but the place itself is dingy and darkish. They serve peanuts with a drink. I have noticed that the waitress throw the peanut shells to the floor; one has to use napkins but most of the guests just leave the nutshells on the table. The entire place does not look very clean,et alone tidy. The Raffles hotel is famous for its Singapore Sling and its ingredients are still a secret to this day. Raffles hotel rests on its very famous reputation of an ear long gone by."
,,Good private shopping arcade,4.0,,"I loved this Arcade cuz it gives you a private shopping spree away from the Ion or Takashimaya crowd.

From Tiffany to Louis Vutton you could browse through slowly taking in the beauty of its products.

After a tiring shopping spree you could enjoy yourself in the cafe or restaurants of Raffles Hotel of course not forgetting the Long Bar to sip the infamous Singapore Sling that has been concocted by their renowned bartender."
,,A big-spender's paradise offering lots of luxury brands under one roof.,4.0,,"No harm in window shopping when visisting Raffles Hotel. But if you happen to be wanting to buy top of the range branded goods, this Arcade is possibly one of the best. And then pop along to the famous Long Bar for a bit of liquid refreshment."
,,Wonderfully decadent.,5.0,,Wonderfully decadent experience in a well maintained & marketed hotel. The Long Bar just had to be visited but the Singapore Sling was far superior when sampled in the courtyard amongst such splendour.
,,great place to wander,4.0,,"Fantastic reminder of the British Colonial days. The building is exquisite and I seem to remember it had a big overhaul a few years ago. The shops seem to be quite select and exclusive which is fitting to the venue, If you want to do the tourist thing and have a 'sling' in the Long Bar then do what you must, but you would get a better Singapore Sling in a good cocktail bar and probably cheaper too. The ones in the Long Bar seem a little too mass produced."
,,Great old building,5.0,,This is a great old building it has been kept up well and is a real attraction we didn't buy anything as the prices are a bit to high for our budget
,,The Raffles - a must place to visit,4.0,,"The Raffles hotel, a place one has to visit in Singapore, was build in a colonial style. Inside the hotel there are some shops, restaurants and bars. The bar inside the yard is worth a visit, even just to give the famous Singapore Sling a try. I visit the Raffles every time when I am in Singapore ..."
,,Singapore Sling (drink) stop,4.0,,"Stopped at the Long Bar to have a Singapore Sling, to do the tourist thing. Drink was fine, the atmosphere of the hotel and shopping arcade was great - really takes you back in time. I liked that part the best."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Seriously, it has lost it's shine from the hey days when it was reopened. The shops looks tired and paints peeling off."
,,Not my idea of a shopping experience,4.0,,"Sad to see that Raffles Hotel has gone so touristy. I did not think it offered much in the way of shopping, finding the Chinese area more interesting. Even Raffles bar has become a bit of a let down."
,,"Cool, Elegance and Class",5.0,,"If you are after a “high-end” shopping experience or you would just like to “sticky beak” to see how the “other half” live then the Raffles Hotel Arcade provides both opportunities.
The arcade is located at street level on two sides of the inner courtyard of the hotel. There, you will find a variety of small shops selling quality fashion, jewellery, watches and gifts. Amongst the assortment of shops you will also find a large Raffles Hotel souvenir and gift shop. Here you can purchase Raffles Hotel souvenirs of all sorts. They are not cheap but if you do as we did during our most recent visit and spend some time looking around the store, you may well “bag a bargain”.
If shopping is not your thing, then you could enjoy a casual meal and drink in the Raffles Hotel courtyard café. The other alternative is to pop upstairs to the Long Bar, the home of the Singapore Sling, for a drink and also to indulge in the long held tradition of throwing peanut shells on the floor.
The Raffles Hotel Shopping Arcade is therefore recommended as a place to go either to do some serious shopping or just to add to your list of experiences as a tourist in Singapore."
,,Just because!,4.0,,"Unless the idea of a Rolex is your idea of a Saturday afternoon shop then most people are not going to be staying here, but in spite of this the hotel is open to all for a look round and visit to their shop.

Of course it would be rude not to try the Singapore Sling ($31) or a soft drink ($9) in the lovely terrace. The waiters were attentive and polite, the 'atmosphere divine', and for a moment it is possible to pretend that a trip to Tiffany's to buy a little trinket is next on the addenda!!"
,,A on iconic place to visit,5.0,,"An iconic building with a tasteful, high end shopping arcade. Lovely with palm trees and large fans as in colonial times."
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,Famous for the Raffles Bar where the Singapore Sling Cocktail was invented. A very stylish old hotel.
,,Amazing hotel,5.0,,"stayed here during singapore grand prix last year, hotel and staff were amazing, also the pool on the roof is nice touch and hearing the formula 1 cars go around the city of Singapore"
,,Singapore Sling,5.0,,"Be sure to try the Singapore Sling, it's the authenthic one according to the person in the hotel I stayed in and don't ever leave without getting your hands on the Slings in small bottles!"
,,RAFFLES HOTEL - PLACE WHERE JOURNEY OF SINGAPORE BEGAN,5.0,,Raffles the British Officer who made and invented Singapore as trading post started his journey from this place. This colonial bungalow now has been converted into hotel. This hotel is famous for it's Shopping Arcade and must buy item is Singapore Sling - its a cocktail but very old recipe to buy and drink. A must visit place while you are in Singapore.
,,a beautiful and graceful building,5.0,,"if visiting Singapore you must go to the entrance of Raffles Hotel, it is stunning, so old and graceful and restored to a beautiful period of our history, the inside is lovely and a credit to all that work there.

There are souvenirs available, you can buy the famous Singapore sling cocktail from the long room bar, expensive but a piece of history."
,,Like an old movie set.,3.0,,"My favorite experience here was when the uniformed guard jumped up, shouted and stomped his feet to let me know I could not enter the lobby without a dinner jacket after a certain hour of the day. Quite dramatic, and a throwback to an earlier era. I appreciated the theatrical message."
,,You must get a Singapore Sling..,4.0,,Had dinner and then went to the bar for a Singapore Sling. It was a great experience that we will always remember the bar was fun and the food in the restaurant was good. the hotel itself is also interesting and has some cute shops.
,,Elite shopping,5.0,,After you have shopped for the bargains at Little India and Chinatown enjoy the luxury of shopping here. There are many things to catch your eye and to include in your suite case for going home.
,,The High Street in Singapire,5.0,,The iconic hotel and the arcade around it is most enthalling for all those who love the glitzy shops of high end . No bargains here . Very lively eateries line up offering any number of various foods . Go for it if you have a rainy day and no outdoor activity . Easy access by public transport makes it possible .
,,Singapore Sling time,5.0,,"Had to wait 26 years as renovating when we were last in Singapore! Made our way to the Long Bar and finally ordered a Singapore Sling - original. Lovely. A really relaxing night and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. Staff, as everywhere in Singapore, were cheerful and couldn't do enough for you."
,,Just because... colonial setting and a slice of history - enjoy.,4.0,,"Shopping and dining... step back in time and enjoy these lovely surrounds of colonial buildings. Great jewellery stores with beautiful service, then reward yourself with a drink at the bar of course."
,,"Beautiful Raffles Hotel Arcade, but can be expensive!",3.0,,"A must see! If you go to Singapore, it is a lovely place to have a drink, however be prepared it can be quite pricey, especially if you have a family!"
,,Worth a wander round,4.0,,"Nice to wander round if you're staying at Raffles or are going there for a visit. Quite a large variety of shops from fashion shops, furniture and home accessory shops, beauty spas set over three floors so more to look at than you first think.

While they're not cheap, Raffles Gift Shop is very nice and has a range of goods with varying prices so you can probably get something there as a souvenir of your visit. There are posters, clothing like t-shirts and scarves etc, shopping bags and casual bags, sweet, chocolates and tins of biscuits, different varieties of teas and coffees, premix for the famous Singapore Slings, beautiful cushions and covers, and loads more.

Anything you buy comes wrapped in a lovely bag with the Raffles logo on it so you get the extra bonus of carrying that around too!"
,,A Classic,4.0,,"This is a great hotel. I have stayed here several times and it is always great. What can you say about staff? Amazing they are. As far as hotel complexes, this is the best."
,,A visit to the Commonwealth past,5.0,,If you are a certain age and heard of Tenko or know your history this is the place to visit. You need to have the Singapore sling whilst there. They are expensive but you need to realise exactly where you are and then they d not seem to be that expensive.
,,Great place for luxury goods shopping,4.0,,everything is located nearby however orchard area is more convenient and great for people watching specially around ION
,,Classy and redolent of colonial times,5.0,,"Very atmospheric - lovely to wander round, quick visit to to the souvenir shop and then off to the Long Bar, Always worth spending an hour or two here,"
,,Good experience,3.0,,"We dined in the China Resturant at the Raffles Hotel, it was average, moderate size and neat. No windows to look out of.
We had chicken & corn soup with duck pancakes which were rolled for us. Soup was a bit bland however duck was tasty. Had nice green tea. Service was good, waitress helpful."
,,Shopping Arcade At Iconic Raffles Hotel with High End Stores,4.0,,"This shopping arcade is part of the iconic Raffles Hotel.

It's located at the City Hall area, a central part of Singapore.

The arcade has many high end boutiques such as Louis Vuitton, Leica camera store and even local tailor store - CYC who makes shirts for many important VIPs.

There are also restaurants here where you can sit down to fine meals. At the upper floors are the ballroom and the 'Jubilee Hall' where performances are staged.

Do pop over to Raffles Hotel for their signature and world-famous Singapore Sling!
Give it a visit!"
,,Amazing architecture! Have a Singapore long here!,5.0,,"Really gorgeous. As this is the place where to infamous cocktail the Singapore Sling was invented, we decided to have a cocktail each! Enjoy."
,,Pricey but has to be done,4.0,,"Singapore sling at the place it was invented, S$ 35, but you do get free nuts! Shame that they don't have a dress code though, visitors in sports wear rather spoil the atmosphere...."
,,Had to visit,5.0,,"The mall was amazing so many shops and places to eat. The main attraction was the short walk to Raffles Hotel, just to soak up what opulence used to entail."
,,Raffles hotel Singapore,5.0,,"Full of old traditional charm and splendor. Customer service excellent. A must to go to, even if you are not staying there is the HIGH TEA in the afternoon. Just fabulous. But you must book for a reservation. Do not miss this."
,,Good Shopping,5.0,,Found some beautiful gifts to bring home and spent an enjoyable couple of hours looking at everything
,,high tea just a must,5.0,,"went to high tea for a birthday oh the food and i received a cake too. This is a must do we had such a wonderful time . A seat by the window for two ,tea cakes bought back time as a child with mother."
,,Singapore is incomplete without this,5.0,,"We did the Raffles Tour from City Tours in Singapore. It includes sight seeing the Raffles Square area and then high tea buffet at Tiffin Room at the Raffles Singapore. The spread is something worth every penny spent. Do not miss this tour, its worth it compared to the flyer, sentosa or anything else."
,,great high tea,5.0,,"We booked from our hotel to have high tea at Raffles in Singapore and it was on our bucket list. It did not disappoint, staff are so attentive and the food was delicious."
,,The home of the Singapore Sling...and some expensive shopping?,3.0,,You can't possibly visit Singapore without visiting Raffles. The arcade is home to a collection of shops contains items we normal mortals will probably not be buying...but good to look ant!
,,Dont leave Singapore without a visit,4.0,,"We visited Raffles as part of a last day package that include afternoon tea. Although we didn't go for the full works the cheaper option in the Empire Room(if I remember correctly) was still a very pleasant way of spending the afternoon. We wandered around the arcade, visited the famed bar - complete with peanut shells on the floor - for a while before being whisked off back to our hotel for the journey home.

Some may be disappointed others wont be so just go with an open mind and then you can say - ""I've been there"". After all it is one of the world's iconic hotels"
,,Raffles singapore,4.0,,What can I say about the original Raffles. Beautiful hotel spotless and very very expensive . We just had to try the Singapore sling and at $34.00 each one was enough. But the building itself was amazing and worth a visit
,,Best way to see Raffles Hotel if you are not staying!,4.0,,"The arcade is the outside corridor of the legendary Raffles Hotel and gives you free access from the front and great photo opportunity, access to the shops, dining (in particular the Raffles Courtyard), Long Bar and Ah Tengs Bakery (cafe)
The Raffles Hotel souvenir shop is in the Arcade, good to browse but items are expensive to buy...lots of other shops and luxury brands to see along with a upper floor.
Great atmosphere and a nice place to walk as it is cool and some nice places to sit by the fountains and greenery of the gardens. The inner areas of the hotel grounds are inaccessible and gated and locked."
,,A must when in Singapore,5.0,,We went to the long bar for a Singapore sling a must do when in Singapore. It is not cheap but one of those things to tick of the bucket list
,,A Singapore icon,4.0,,Great service and a brilliantly maintained building. This is a very classy place and does give the experience of the British Raj. in Singapore. The bar is a must and the Singapore Sling is highly recommended but it may be the dearest cocktail you have lurched!
,,Colonial Classic,4.0,,This hotel is a big piece of Singapore's history and it is worth seeing it.There are shops on the first floor that are mostly expensive. Raffles' souvenir shop is a fun place and a frugal traveler can get something too. Raffles hotel is right by City Hall MTR station.
,,Wonderful,4.0,,I enjoyed a lot this hotel while being in Singapore for business. Very luxurious and a very beautiful building.
,,Disapointed,2.0,,The hotel is simply beautiful. But unless you live there you are not permitted into the gorgeous lobby. So I went to the legendary Long Bar to have my Singapore sling where it was invented. What a tourist trap! The place was filled with pigeons flying back and fourth and the floor was covered with peanut shells. No luxury feeling what so ever.
,,|England in Singapore,5.0,,Step back in history to see how the rich and famous spent their time (and money0 in the splendid Raffles Hotel. Probably much as it was those many years ago. A Singapore Sling in the Long Bar is a must and you can enjoy a tasty lunch in the courtyard at a most reasonable cost.Spend time browsing the shops in the courtyard they are fascinating.An absolute must
,,A GOOD BUT EXPANSIVE HERITAGE HOTEL,4.0,,"This hotel is one of the oldest hotels in Singapore, nice big rooms but quite expansive if you compare to many other modern hotels."
,,Raffles Disappointment,2.0,,"Everyone who goes to Singapore has to go to ""The Long Bar"" at the iconic Raffles Hotel and sip a Singapore Sling. So that is exactly what we did on our recent trip to Singapore.
Unfortunately we were so disappointed. Who ever now owns this beautiful iconic hotel has decided to overcharge and under supply, to hit the tourists as they don't have to try to hard to get them in the door. However, once upon a time we would have gone there every visit to Singapore, we wont be bothering again.
AU$80 for 2 Singapore Slings (made in bulk) and the worst little nachos (1 shared) we have ever had, a small pile of corn chips and a 3 tiny dishes with some salsa, avocado and cheese from a jar.
Singapore is a fantastic place to visit, and Raffles once was an iconic landmark and fun experience, but has lost its charm and is just a money grabbing tourist trap now. Cheap plastic shakers on the table for tourists to buy now also, all class!!!"
,,The Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel,4.0,,"Anyone who is a history buff HAS to go to the Long Bar if only to sit in the beautiful colonial style lounge while sipping a Singapore Sling (which was invented here).
If you are North American you will be surprised to discover that the signature drink has more to do with a Margarita than a Pina Colada...lol"
,,a beautiful hotel,4.0,,"It is expensive to stay there, but the gardens, the restaurants and the shops are beautiful and luxurious."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,We thought a must visit whilst in Singapore Packed!! The service was terrible I actually went to look for a member of staff 4 of us tried Singapore sling . Ridiculous price Avoid this attraction - over rated Toilets not good
,,Magnificent architecture.,4.0,,"Amidst of the modernisation of Singapore, this hotel adds a little bit of character to the city-state dominated by modern buildings and skyscrapers."
,,The Grandest of Hotels,5.0,,"Step out of your taxi at Raffles Hotel, and step back in time to an age where style and dignity ruled. Where ladies wore beautiful gowns, dressed like real ladies. Where gentlemen were gentlemen. Sit on the verandah sipping your G&T, sit in the Garden Bar indulging in a Singapore Sling. Breakfast at Ah Tengs. What a wonderful, wonderful place. You can feel the history. It would have to be my very favourite destination in the world. Price is not important, you are paying to experience a little slice of history, and it is well worth every cent."
,,Went for a Singapore Sling!,4.0,,"I came to the Raffles Hotel with some hostel mates I met to have a Singapore Sling in the hotel bar (where the drink was invented). Although the drink was around $32, we did it just to say that we did! We had a fun time, and were glad that we did it!"
,,Lovely buildng extremely overpriced food etc,4.0,,"A visit to Raffles is a must must because it was and is an institution in Singapore . The owners rely ( prey ) on tourists knowledge of this past an the hotels image .
Thousands flock there daily willing to pay too much for a Singapore Sling (or every thing else ) due to "" the Romance of the place ""
$39 for a very small Hamburger with a dozen fries one example .. they keep on paying ... so it goes on another to take ones place .
The Long Bar may be the original but has moved from where it actually was i days of old .
Worth a look but don't stay long unless you are loaded ."
,,"If you have time, you just at least walk through",3.0,,"Raffles has such a history that it would be a shame not to at least walk though the famous landmark. We did not actually go inside the hotel, but just walked the walkways around the outside and went to the gift shop which we found to be interesting. There were a lot of tourists inside buying gifts which were all pretty high quality. We bought a jigsaw puzzle of the outside of the hotel. Glad we went as everyone should go once."
,,Just to say we did it.,4.0,,"A lovely Hotel with so much history, I couldn't believe the cost of the Singapore Sling... but at least I can say I've had one at Raffles."
,,Has to be done!,5.0,,"Was horrified at the price of a Singapore Sling but relented and was so glad I did so. The Long Bar is so atmospheric and the fans gently wafting back and forth on the ceiling added to the experience. I could not, however, throw monkey nut shells on the floor as tradition demands although there were plenty who did! This is something that just has to be done in Singapore!"
,,Pros and Cons,5.0,,"+ Located very close to the Gardens by the Bay, which is interesting to visit.
+ Hotel restaurant is expensive, but very good.
+ The lap pool is open and the water was warm even in the rain. The pool looks cool with the transparent walls all the way around.
+ Take a power converter for your electrical devices.

- There was a step in our room. It is quite dangerous even at the day time, because you don't remember about it and it is not very visible.
- Before washing your clothes in a washer-dryer combo, be certain that the drying cycle is selected correctly. There is no manual for operating it."
,,High End - High Prices!,3.0,,On a recent visit to Singapore did a walk through the Raffles Hotel Arcade. This famous arcade has been walked through by many people over 100 years that the hotel has existed. Typically it is full of high-end shops selling name brand items at high end prices. None-the-less wanted to walk through it and check it out and tick it off my bucket list!
,,Not how i had seen it on the Television,3.0,,"I alway thought that Raffles Hotel was a seaside hotel, but sadley now it is on a main road in Singapore. We enjoyed our Singapore Sling and the peanuts, but it is very busy all the time"
,,Colonial Grandeur,5.0,,"Lovely experience walking through the long, open sided corridors and white rooms of the hotel to finally experience the Long Bar. It was wonderful to reflect on the famous faces who have frequented Raffles in the past. The gift shop is expensive, but a bookmark with the signature Singapore Sling recipe is worth the couple of UK pounds it will costs. Being there takes you back to another time."
,,Elegant,5.0,,I love this place and always shop here. I love the old building with all the character from a time gone by
,,Brunch to die for,5.0,,"And we probably will! You can eat to your heart's (and stomach's) content here, but your pocket will suffer serious indigestion. Every luxury food you can imagine, served by charming staff in a magnificent setting - the billiard tables are turned into serving tables for the duration."
,,Go to enjoy the ambience and gradeur of Singapore's Old Lady.,3.0,,"Now this is one of those situations on Trip Advisor where many people post a review in the wrong place so I'm not going to do that but hopefully my review may prevent it happening in the future...

So here on Trip Advisor you will find listings for both the ""Raffles Hotel Arcade"", that is this listing, and then there is the ""Long Bar"" which is a separate listing so it bugs me as to why people post about the Long Bar and their drinking experience here on a listing for a Shopping Arcade!?! I will review the 'Arcade' here and the 'Long Bar' where it should ne reviewed... Anyway off my soap box and on with my reviews!!

This being my Third visit to Singapore I thought it about time to pay the famous 'Raffles Hotel' a visit. I entered by the front of the Hotel as I wanted to see the famous exotically dressed Sikh doormen (See photo), the doorman I met had been at Raffles for 25 years! I then walked the labyrinth of tropical courtyards and verandas taking in some of the Arcade Shops which were all high class and high cost affairs and many were closed but it was a Sunday. As I am not a shopper to me just being in this iconic 'Old Lady' of Singapore was floating my boat... Walking along the same passageways as some of its old day celebrity guests such as Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham, Charlie Chaplin, Noel Coward and Elizabeth Taylor. The only shop I did spend some time in was the Hotel Gift Shop... No purchases made though as it was all over priced as you'd expect. Visit and enjoy the hotel ambience, the gardens and the grandeur."
,,Afternoon tea !!,5.0,,"We decided to visit Raffles as it's an iconic institution and although expensive for tea, it's much more than tea, it's an experience not to be missed if you have time when in Singapore"
,,A long time dream,5.0,,Visited the famous Long Bar and enjoyed a Singapore Sling. Although it wasn't cheap it was something I've wanted to do for a long time & I wasn't disappointed. We threw are peanut shells on the floor & laughed with other customers and listened to a live band playing. Would have liked to stay longer. Loved it!
,,Raffles Hotel,5.0,,A taste of old Colonial Singapore with a Singapore sling in the long bar Walking on peanut shells and adding to them as we sipped our drinks
,,Old Lady of Singapore,4.0,,"The Raffles Hotel is probably the oldest Hotel in town and you can feel the old times inside the arcade. It is really beautiful and you should at least try a singapore sling inside the arcade. We didn't because it was very very expensive, but also if you ain't got Money, a look inside the arcade costs nothing."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"What a lovely experience,we visited the famous Long Bar and had a lovely evening although a little costly,well worth an evening visit.The staff are excellent and the atmosphere relaxed."
,,Colonial old world charm for a price amidst high rise bustle,4.0,,"The hotel is preserved in its glorious past, once right near the sea, now further inland due to land reclamation. A stroll through the corridors gleaming with golden light, passing by diners in the softly lit dining room will have you heading back in time, ready for a Singapore Sling in the garden courtyard. The drink itself is pretty sickly and sweet but a chilled gin and tonic and daquari for my friend accompanied by cocktail nibbles over Chinese New Year allowed us to pretend we were living in a more gracious slow paced time in this city of high rises and bustling traffic. Service is discreet and though pricey, it delivers on old world charm"
,,Bucket list,4.0,,"When visiting Singapore, how could you not call into the world renowned Raffles for a Singapore Sling?!! Always difficult to stop at one - so why bother - after another all your cares begin to fade away! - Bit pricey, but hey, once in a lifetime you have to follow the crowd!!"
,,High Tea,4.0,,"WE very much enjoyed our High Tea, not the cheapest but did also have a Dim Sum buffet included. The hotel itself is an experience & the concierge very helpful even though we weren't actually staying there, we wish !!"
,,Leche vitrine,5.0,,"Gorgeous shops, adjacencies and brand mix. If it's good enough for Madonna and the Queen it's good enough me. Great for buying in privacy. If you are looking for a place to be seen, it won't work here."
,,A MUST,5.0,,No visit to Singapore would be complete without a visit to the Long Bar and a Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel. It is a tradition to shell the peanuts and drop the husks on the floor. It is advisable to book a table although it is possible to get one if you arrive on spec. The hotel is a through back to the past glories. See for yourself.
,,When in Singapore,4.0,,Raffles i suppose is a name most assossiated with Singapore no visit is complete without a visit to the long bar for a singapore sling it is touristy but a must visit
,,Historic Icon,5.0,,"Like many, we weren't staying at Raffles, but instead came to look at an Asian icon and historic building. We we'rent disappointed.
From the outside the clean white exterior and orange, clay tiles, surrounded by tropical trees is an oasis in the high-rise Singaporean CBD. Walking around (outside) the building and exploring the many courtyards and balconies is a delight. From the Indian-dressed concierge, queues for 'high-tea' and small numbers of elite label shops... Raffles oozes affluence for a different time in history, particularly since the Singaporean skyline is now dominated by modern glass and concrete towers.
There seemed to be no general access into Raffles, but daresay you could access some of the many different bars and restaurants inside. Meanwhile the $14 price tag for a beer in the Courtyard bar would ensure a fitting experience opportunity to people watch while relaxing in this unique setting.
Very accessible by the MRT system, and not far from shopping malls or Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. The Hop On, Hop Off bus stops here too."
,,Not as expensive as you would think.,4.0,,"Our second visit here and it is still value for money. OK, you pay for the name but that is expected. The hotel is now a major tourist attraction and you can see it is geared towards this but still a beautiful place to visit. The world famous Singapore Sling is delicious!"
,,It had to be done,4.0,,"We felt we had to visit the origin of the Singapore Sling. The Long bar was still kept in Colonial style with wicker fans from the ceiling moving the air conditioned air around. The monkey nuts are free and plentyful. Shells should be cast to the ground in traditional style. The Singapore sling was $28! but was nice. I asked if I could have the glass as a souvenier, but was told that they used to give the glass, but it is now available in their shop to buy (of course) - which was not open at night!! think they have missed a trick here, also, I think the high price included the glass originally, but has not been reduced - . Mass produced by one guy behind the bar in view. The beer was surprising, it was $20 !!! way overpriced. There was food to be had but was very expensive I feel.We enjoyed the visit to be able to say we had done it, but would not go back."
,,Good Shopping but not cheap!,4.0,,"Lots of shops to explore! Always find the food courts! These are so much cheaper and generally as good if not better than some restaurants!

We tried the Raffles Bar, where they serve you monkey nuts with your cocktails and you can just throw the shells on the floor! The music played was pretty good too! We had some bar food and enjoyed these too! They were fairly pricey but tasted good!"
,,A bit of a disappointment,3.0,,Only hotel guests are allowed in the lobby so we could only visit the Long Bar. The bar was decorated in the old colonial style. Wooden bowls of peanuts in their shells were put out on the tables and it was the tradition to throw the shells on the floor. We were served with the traditional Singapore Sling which I found unimpressive compared with the cost. There was an entertaining group of musicians with a good female singer in the bar.
,,When in Singapore.......,4.0,,"No trip to Singapore can be complete without doing the typically tourist stop-off at Raffles. Well, being typical tourists we duly stopped-off and enjoyed the obligatory Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. Quite expensive, not surprisingly, but was actually very nice...... A wander round the whole Raffles complex was a very pleasant experience, well worth a visit."
,,Very expensive and touristy but fun,4.0,,"Singapore slings might be better and definately are cheaper elsewhere but the atmosphere is wonderful. The hotel gardens are lovely with old colonial style. Since the drinks are outrageously expensive, the hotel could keep the bottles in a fridge to make them cool at least."
,,One off the bucket list...,5.0,,"I always wanted to have a Singapore sling at raffles and got my wish in November!

Yes it's expensive and yes its a tourist spot but its iconic and I'm glad we did it.

The hotel itself is a lovely ""old world"" building and I really enjoyed the experience!"
,,Doing the obvious,4.0,,Really impressive place expensive shops but interesting. Did the obvious tourist activity in the long bar.
,,Sling-Ho,4.0,,"Old worldly feel with the brown solid wood stairways, whitewashed walls & palm leaf shaped cane ceiling fans. A little more expensive than anticipated but the food was lovely & the slings were delicious."
,,Tourist Trap.,4.0,,"I will start by saying the Raffles Hotel complex is a wonderful, iconic building in Singapore. You can wander around the wide verandas and reminisce about days gone by. Many high end shops in and around the hotel, catering for the clientèle that would stay here. But, all the tourist want to go to the Long Bar at the hotel, and that is where the trap is. Apart from it always being crowded, the prices of drinks are a little steep, even for Singapore. The ""iconic"" Singapore Sling is what everyone wants to sample, but at $35 a glass, it really isn't worth it. Especially seeing that they are made in a mass produced way, 12 - 15 at a time, sort of takes away the mystery of it all. If you do go, expect to part with at least $100, but if it is one of the places that are a ""must do"" then you will enjoy the experience. Easy to get to via the fantastic MRT train system that they have in Singapore."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Visiting Raffles Hotel Arcade is just for the rich. Good for browsing. And if you decide to have a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar, be prepared to pay $68.25 for 2!! I find that extremely expensive and should have checked before ordering. Service was good though, as was the Sling!"
,,"superb afternoon tea, with harp accompaniment",5.0,,"Superb afternoon tea in gorgeous surroundings. A very elegant room, very professional staff, tasty food choices, lashings of tea and coffee."
,,Dissapointing,3.0,,"I was really looking forward to seeing the renowned Raffles Hotel but was bit disappointed when i seen it. Its a lovely hotel and obviously done in colonial style but compared to the Fullerton and Marina Bay Sands hotel it looked average.

You cant get into the hotel unless your a guest. We had a wander around the arcade which is full of pretentious shops. We had pics taken at the front of the hotel and its an icon of Singapore so worth a visit and doesn't cost anything."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,Raffles is a beautiful Hotel but the arcade shops are only average and not selling much you would want or need. The only thing I liked was the Raffles souvenir shop selling very expensive merchandise that must be in the Hotel itself. I bought some Breakfast tea bags but the rest is very expensive.
,,Fairly average,3.0,,"You really have to visit the Raffles Hotel whilst in Singapore, but the arcade is really nothing special. Be warned that you'll be in for some fairly serious gouging if you decide to have a drink in the Long Bar, but it's one of those things you really have to do whilst in Singapore."
,,Tired and worn venue,3.0,,A must see but be prepared for a hefty bill at the end. Nothing spectacular and peanut shells all over the floor and about 28$ for a glass of wine
,,If you want a sling you better be patient,1.0,,"Stopped in the bar for a Singapore Sling (you have to don't you). Were shown to a table by a waiter, given a menu and waited. Despite all our efforts to get somebody to take our order ... no takers. After 20 mins worked out why they are called Waiters and left. Can see why the Raffles hotel USEd to be the place to stay ... No longer!!"
,,"Well, you have to, don't you?",4.0,,"Stopped off at the long bar at Raffles after a business meeting (only one stop on the East-West MTR from Raffles Place).

After walking around the block (guests only at the Beach Road front door) I found my way in to the courtyard. Service was a might slow, but I wasn't in a particular rush. Most people there seemed to be curious visitors like myself, with a few seemingly more local.

A minor detail, but I hope the toilets were in a better state when Raffles was around.

I don't think I would dash back, but it was good to say I had been and seen."
,,Sadly greatly over rated,3.0,,"There is some wonderful romantic ambiance to be sucked in here, however the iconic Singapore Sling is horribly expensive, often poured from a vat and not really as special as you'd hope. This is an utter tourist trap, some people might claim that you haven't been to Singapore until you've had a sling in Raffles. I'd disagree, there are much better places to go and spend your money in this wonderful country but that's just my opinion!"
,,What at evening....,5.0,,"Raffles Hotel lovely and elegant place...pick up a couple of souvenirs in the gift shop...if you close your eyes, imagine a time gone by...at a slow elegant pace....
The Long bar is atmospheric, whilst sitting at the bar watching the bar attendants whiz around, tip go early, as around dinner time, it's full and you have to wait, we went before the fashionable cocktail hour. Alfred is one the bar attendants, we felt very special sitting chatting with him whilst he was whiz zing around making the "" famous singapore slings"" and anything else on the cocktail list.
Highly recommend a must see.
But, do not take trishaw from Raffles Hotel....we paid $78sng for a 15 min ride to Bugis street markets...even when I ask the price first... Don't feel sorry for little old men...sucker born every minute.. I just had mine..."
,,Expensive but Iconic 'must-do',4.0,,"Yes the Singapore Slings are expensive, but as long as you go in expecting this, you are more likely to enjoy yourself. We still had a lovely time moseying around, taking in the colonial romance of Raffles, then enjoying our iconic Singapore Sling and throwing peanut shells on the ground. Glad we stopped in, despite the crazy bar bill."
,,Don't be fooled,3.0,,"Although the outside displays the colonial times well, inside it has become a building filled with shops and art galleries that don't resemble the glorious past of the building. Only a small part of the immense monument is still used as a hotel.
At the Long Bar one can drink an overpriced Singapore Sling. Moreover there is a massive queue outside the bar."
,,Pricey but has to be on to-do list.,4.0,,"Raffles hotel and arcade is a lovely old building. For most (like me) I suspect it's a must see (rather than pay to stay) and tick off the list. They definitely trade off the name. Having said that it was great to pop in, have a look around and have a Singapore sling. Actually a refreshing break from the heat."
,,Colonial memory,5.0,,"If you are a little into the colonial past, than you will rnjoy that building. You can walk a little around and have the feeling you are back in time....Once hungry from walking, around the corner is the longest bar & steakhouse..."
,,Come here if you enjoy throwing your money away,1.0,,"I have reviewed the appalling tourist trap that is the Long Bar separately. Is it really worth $28 for a single drink and disgraceful service to throw a couple of peanuts on the floor. Personally, I didn't think so. This semi-indoor/outdoor arcade is attached to the side of the hotel. Do not try to enter the hotel lobby if you are not a guest. There is security and they do not want you in there to have a look unless you've paid your $600-800 a night. The surrounding arcade is pleasant enough to walk through. It contains tailors, art galleries, antiques and luxury labels like Tiffany's and Louis Vuitton. There is a Raffles Boutique Store if you want to throw your money at overpriced souvenirs. This place completely trades on its name and history. There are so many choices in Singapore that do things better than this place for food, drink and shopping now. We went here because we were drawn in by the historic association but will now always associate this place as one of the worst things we did in Singapore."
,,Visit to the Raffles Hotel complex,5.0,,"We did the touristy Singapore Sling drink in the Long Bar in Raffles a Hotel at £16 a go. This will be just once in a lifetime at this price ,however you have as many peanuts as you like and you must throw the shells on the floor. We also visited the Raffles shopping arcade, which was a bit pricey but we bought a few fridge magnets and posted cards ."
,,Visitors are welcome too,4.0,,"Raffles is synonymous with Singapore, and rightly so. It's an institution that has maintained impeccably high standards for years. This is just to note that even if you're not a guest in the hotel it's still possible to visit the original building on Beach Road and walk around some of the well-manicured grounds. From the front of the building go around the left hand side and you'll discover a selection of shops selling what could well be the highest quality souvenirs of Singapore you'll ever find. Lots of lovely things to look at and purchase, including some branded 'Raffles' which will be conversation-starters when you get home. When we were there one morning there was a high tea going on in the dining room so we couldn't call in for a cuppa, but it looked like those inside were being catered for royally. Maybe next time."
,,You want how much for a Singapore Sling!!,2.0,,"$50SG for a real Singapore Sling and a kids one. A bit too pricey for the chance to have one.

And there isn't much in one either, a gulp and a bit and it's all gone.

Recommend make one yourself and have as many as you want at your own leisure. We did when we got home to Australia and still do."
,,Afternoon the time,5.0,,"Exceptionel afternoon The arrangement, service in absolutly in top. The whole atmosphere in this historical place should be experienced. Do not forget to visit Raffles when in Singapore."
,,You have to do it!,4.0,,"Yes, it cliché, but of course we went to Raffles and drank a Singapore Sling! We probably wouldn’t have made the special effort but we’d used the “Hop on Hop off” tourist bus and there was a stop right outside Raffles. We nipped in to cool down and nibble on the peanuts, and we were surprised by the lovely decor- still in a colonial style- and lovely gardens. It was a very pleasant way to spend an hour or two (nursing a £13.50 cocktail!) and people watching."
,,Required destination,4.0,,"Obviously you have to visit the Long Bar for the obligatory Singapore Sling. Interesting hotel with colonial atmosphere. Quite commercial now, but, worth the visit."
,,Best high tea ever,4.0,,"We booked high tea from our hotel and we were not disappointed. It was great to get dressed up for a change and be waited on.

We were in a group of six and the staff replenished the sandwiches plate several times without asking for it. A nice surprise.

A little expensive at $68, however well worth it."
,,wonderful,5.0,,shops here are exquisite the hotel amazing wonderful piece of architecture great history a real wonder experience must have a Singapore sling in the famous raffles bar
,,Shops and rides,5.0,,"Outside Raffles there is a parade of shops ..... All high end goods. It fun to window shop. If you are lucky you will see Oliver and his rickshaw ...... Let him take you for a spin around the city, it,s worth it just for the banter and terrible jokes. He is lovely and makes the ride really enjoyable."
,,Historical Building/Hotel,5.0,,"Again, this is a must do experience for walking around and have a drink in the courtyard bar - before going upstairs to the 'Long Bar' for another drink and peanuts! Great photo's can be taken."
,,Only if you're in the vicinity or going to Shinji,4.0,,"It's not a mall per se, but a smattering of shops in the raffles hotel. There are some interesting ones, like some art galleries and a Molton brown store, but apart from those, nothing better than what you can find on orchard road

The only outstanding part of the arcade is the best Japanese/sushi restaurant in the country, Shinji. You have to eat it to to believe it"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Beautiful hotel, certainly showed how it was years ago. However, if you want high tea or a drink, you need deep pockets. Close to S$30 for any alcholic drink!"
,,Old World Beauty,4.0,,"While in Singapore for a few days my sister and I decided to check out this beautiful old hotel where so many famous movie stars had stayed so long ago.
Raffles has kept it's style and beauty and I think still looks as grand today as it was so many years ago.
I must say tho that I gasped when told the price of a Gin Sling, and when I opted for a Coke instead, still went cross eyed when told around $20. All in all a lovely place to visit and felt sad when having to leave to catch the last M R T of the night to return to our more down market hotel to sleep.

went crossed at the price"
,,unacceptable site and service,1.0,,"Difficult to navigate the less-than-glitzy arcade and property. Did not find any of the glory of yesteryear that we expected. We booked a tea with a tour group, but after getting separated from our group (taking a picture) an officious doorman barred us from the lobby, and wouldn't listen to our request to rejoin the group. Looked in at the long bar - nothing special. Expected a superb shopping arcade - not. Dark, many spaces closed, no great windows - and understandably few window-shopping patrons. Definitely not fun. The Stamford next door is joined to a fun arcade with excellent food court. Give Raffles a miss."
,,faded glory - disappointing site and service,1.0,,"Not the experience we expected, actually a bit ratty in appearance. Snobby doorman would not allow us to enter when we'd gotten separated from our tour - which meant we did not get seated for the much touted tea event we'd paid for. Explanations had no effect on officious personnel. Indoor and outdoor bar areas, again much touted, were unexciting, hard to access. The so-called shopping arcade is a joke. Many stores vacant or closed; again hard to access. Nothing like the glitz of the Peninsula in Hong Kong. Big time, money and experience loss; we have yet to get a refund for the tea."
,,"Raffles hotel - do it once and move on, unless you have $$$",4.0,,"I was on my way back from a business trip and had 48hrs in Singapore, so made it to Raffles for High Tea. I was not made to feel odd for being their solo, and was kindly provided with a copy of Tatler to read.

As it was a once off champers was in order, and very nice it was if a little expensive by the glass for UK standards, but not too bad by Singapore pricing.

The staff were lovely, the food delicious and I left very full, in a happy frame of mind"
,,"""Pricey'..But a must see",5.0,,"Take your time to stroll around and soak up some history & a visit to a wonderful venue. After a while you just have to experience the original ""Singapore Sling"" & peanuts, or if not into the ""Sling"" enjoy one of their many Beers or refreshing juice........our group of 17 certainly had a wonderful couple of hours just soaking up the atmosphere..."
,,A bit of history - worth the visit,4.0,,Used the Hop On Hop Off bus to get there which was really easy. Had the obligatory Singapore Sling and peanuts which were pretty expensive. It is worth looking around the building and getting a feel of times gone past.
,,Raffles Hotel,5.0,,"Great place to visit, loved it had the peanuts on the floor and drinks, would love to go back very soon."
,,expensive,2.0,,"Although having visited Singapore before never bothered with the Raffles thing, I decided to take it in as I belive you should just to experience where the Sling originated but after my wife and I had a Sling each followed by a sml beer and a gin was presented with a A$100 bill so I understand why I had not previously bothered, building is gorgeous but that's where it stops."
,,Historic,4.0,,We have been there on other occasions and have brought some items. Be aware that shopping here can be very expensive but costs nothing to look. It is a very marvelous building and when in Singapore it's worth the visit. Very handy location to most of the attractions in Singapore
,,Great if you are staying there,4.0,,Shops are quaint but expensive. Nice gift shop which means more if you are actually staying at the hotel.
,,Expensive & Lucrative,4.0,,"I neither have the ability nor the interest to stay at a hotel like this. We were on a guided tour and our guide used this hotel route as a shortcut to go to the Merlion Park. On our way to the Merlion Park, we entered the Raffles Hotel and went by the basement. We had a look at the architecture of the hotel and gave us the idea that this hotel was built under the Colonial influence. I asked for the price per night and the guy from the reception smiled and replied 'It is only S$ 500 Sir'. Like it is nothing! Anyway I guess there are a lot of people to him it is actually nothing to spend that much for a night. I would only recommend this hotel to people who want to have a grand feeling while staying in Singapore."
,,The Hotel that moved inland.,4.0,,"Well, Raffles Hotel, All very nice, Colonial Architecture, Games room where legend has it a Tiger took refuge from the heat in the shade under one of the Billiard tables. This was in the days of Kipling, who enjoyed a stay here from time to time. Of course when in this famous establishment, it's the done thing to retreat to the bar and treat yourself to the famous cocktail, allegedly invented here. ""The Singapore Sling"". What a disappointment to watch the barman take a ready made glass of the desired libation, complete with lid from a tray full of look alike drinks, that was obviously delivered there that morning. Come on Raffles! We ask that the object of our romantic vision be made to order, after all it's a special moment for us visitors .Originally on the coast and enjoying the view.back in the days of Empire and the Raj the Hotel finds itself landlocked nowadays thanks to land reclamation it has become just another part of the city, This visit was back in 2004, but i dont have a tick box with that option, so will pick one at random."
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,"The history of Raffles was amazing, and you must have a Singapore sling in the bar, and feed the parotts."
,,Raffles Hotel,3.0,,"Visit there by all means but dont expect much. High tea is S$70 each, you must wear long pants and consists of cake, scones and tea. Overpriced...absolutely. wearing long pants in 34 deg Temps at 99% humidity doesn't do it for me but if that's your thing by all means do it. The long bar where the Singapore sling was made is only open at certain times so find out before hand if you plan to visit. The Museum is sadly shut down!! Singapore is systematically loosing its history. This is very sad and Singapore will be the poorer for it!"
,,Get your wallet stacked,4.0,,Upmarket shopping mainly with the famous Raffles embossing on everything but worth then experience for sure
,,raffles hotel,4.0,,"The hotel was of a very high old 30's 40's feel just right the long bar was a thrill to sit at the outside plaza was cool and inviting ,do not leave there without tasting the original Singapore sling"
,,"Old charm, but that's it.",4.0,,"The Raffles Arcade is an amazing shopping destination. It looks like the way it was 80-90 years ago. The shops however aren't really interesting, none really connecting with Singapore's history, with the exception of the stores owned by Raffles. The Hotel shop is somewhat overpriced, with some things being super expensive because of one logo. Other things are really nice, so if you buy something, make sure it's unique to the Raffles and make sure it's well worth the price you pay for!"
,,Singapore sling,4.0,,"Fabulous piece of history which is well preserved with many authentic features. Long bar good, as was Singapore sling, it's just a shame they need to maximise on revenue to such an extent,surely $60+ is a little high in the scheme of things. Still, another one off the bucket list!"
,,Classy and historical,5.0,,Had to visit the raffles for a Singapore sling . The hotel is very prestigious looking .lovely little shops within the building . We didn't stay here but went to the famous long bar and had a great experience there. Expect to pay around $29 for a Singapore sling. There are a few choices . There are ground nut shells all over the floor. They have them in little sacks on all the tables. Once you start to nibble on them you can't stop :) overall experience was great. Good service .
,,"Historical maybe, but that's about it...",3.0,,"This property definitely has its historical aspects, and is probably worth a brief visit for some photo opportunities in the gardens, however that's about as far as I would go. Has some nice bars located on the courtyard, but weather dependable as the summer months are humid.

Cost wise, majority of the higher end locations have a cost that come with them. Suppose it depends on what your used to when it comes to paying a bill.

Was ok, but would not go out of my way to visit it if on a time limit."
,,"Beautiful, felt like you were in an old movie",5.0,,"Friendly staff, felt magical walking around is a beautiful part of history - expensive but worth it could have relaxed there for hours will definitely be back to stay a couple of nights"
,,Classic colonial style,5.0,,"Visited Raffles for High Tea and then a few Slings in the Long Bar. High Tea is a must, but you have to make sure you contact Raffles prior to your trip to reserve a spot ! There is no way you will get a table without a reservation.
I have heard the lunch is very good and substantial as well, but the High Tea is outstanding and serves all manner of sweet and savoury treats, along with great Raffles Tea and champagne of course !
The Long Bar has a huge amount of character and no trip to Singapore would be complete without at least one variation of the Singapore Sling being consumed here. It's not cheap, but it is an experience."
,,Keeps you out of the Heat,4.0,,Clean mall with every shop you can imagine. Keeps you out of the heat and a way to get you from places.
,,Going back in time,4.0,,We had breakfast in the raffles breakfast restaurant . You get a choice of croissants and a lot of bakery goods coffee tea but no cooked foods like bacon eggs omelettes etc . I was a bit disappointed but what I had was nice
,,Singapore Sling please waiter!!!,5.0,,"Had to visit the Raffles hotel, but more importantly the 'Longbar' for a traditional 'Singapore Sling' & very tasty it as too! Loved the peanuts & the whole atmosphere...the waiters were very friendly, helping with photos etc...I walked around the various floors of the arcade area...& all still very British Colonial which was very pleasing....long may it last i say!!!...even the toilets have aircon!! lol - well worth a visit folks...."
,,Singapore Sling,4.0,,"Great place to have a few Slings, variety on menu and not badly priced, great atmosphere very british feel to this place"
,,Classy High Tea,5.0,,Last day in Singapore was spent at Raffles Hotel for High-tea. I was a lovely high tea so many different options for food. The service was excellent and the staff was lovely and prompt. Make sure to book ahead as it does get busy.
,,Classy old world experience,4.0,,Enjoyed our stroll through Raffles and our coffee break very much. Really gave you a sense of being thrown back in time. The memorabilia was first class!
,,High tea in classy surroundings,5.0,,"We had high tea as part of a tour which included a river boat ride. There was a selection of sandwiches and cakes on the table, as well as an excellent buffet of hot food, scones and cakes. Tea and coffee included, champagne was extra. The food was delicious and the service and surrounds first class. Highly recommended."
,,Old Colonial Splendour,4.0,,"A beautiful old colonial building, well maintained and had withstood the ravages of time. The gardens have benches where lne can sit and take in the 'old world'. The old stairway is magnificent and makes beautiful pictures. Quite pricey...even tea/coffee is much more expensive here than other places in Singapore. But it is a must-see for any visitor interested in history."
,,Loks very polished now,4.0,,"The last time I was in Singapore was over 30 years ago.At that time the Raffles looked down at heal,having seen better days.All that seems to have changed now.So it would appear have the prices.Anyway nice to see it so spick and span."
,,A must do expensive experience,3.0,,"$27 for a Singapore Sling?? You think I'm joking?? I'm not. Bags of peanuts on the bar, dry and stale. Not eating?? Sit at the bar. No comfort. No jolly bar person. No good vibes."
,,superb,5.0,,dont miss a visit here trully an experience very classy & although pricy would not want to visit singapore & not go for a drink here
,,Expensive but i suppose a must when in singapore,3.0,,"We went to the Raffles hotel for a famous Singapore sling.

I have tasted better cocktails and to be honest it was very expensive for what it was.

The hotel was massive and it was quite difficult to find the toilets.

Good if you want to say you have been, if you aren't that fussed, don't go."
,,Night out with the kids,4.0,,Great experience to say you have drunk Singapore slings in Raffles and threw peanuts. Very expensive but had to be fine
,,A must for a visit,5.0,,"Absolutely fabulous. Arrived via hop on hop off tourist bus which stops outside. Everything I was expecting. Loved it. Tourist shop selling all kinds of tourist ""gifts"", depending on your budget- some reasonable. More shops in arcade.
Decided to go into inner court yard sitting area - so picturesque-humid day, sat under umbrella during short sharp shower.
Singapore slings worth it- about £27 for two- had lovely homemade fresh pizza and water- total about £55 for two for meal and slings.Staff very attentive and polite."
,,A must for one visit but be aware its expensive,4.0,,A Singapore Sling in the Raffles Long Bar is an experience worth having. You can easily imagine the early colonials sitting around the place imbibing the atmosphere and the alcohol. We enjoyed the 'Slings' and the complimentary peanuts the shells of which were thrown as traditional on the floor. The sting in the tail was the tiger beer I also had at £10 per pint. Add on the three Singapore Slings and you have a bill of £60. Expected but worth the experience.
,,A must visit in Singapore!,4.0,,"I thought a visit to Singapore wouldnt be complete without a visit to the Raffles Hotel which first opened its doors in 1887. This historical hotel is well maintained and has kept its colonial style and is located in the heart of Singapore.It was in fact walkable from our hotel the Ibis Belconnen.

We walked past the Long Bar home to the famous Singapore Sling.

My wife and I enjoyed wandering the arcade attached to the hotel looking at some of the various antique items on display as well as browsing the many shops.

A must visit in Singapore!"
,,for short visit,3.0,,This colonial-style hotel is worth a short visit. I thought I will spent longer time here than I did finally. For 5 minutes ok.
,,Time machine back to the colonial times,4.0,,"Very nice, classy, colonial hotel in Singapore. A pity I did not drink the Singapore Sling from the Long Bar. But really worth going to the Raffles to take photos at the Arcade. I bought a post card from the Arcade Gift Shop which makes a good souvenir from Singapore."
,,Step back in time,4.0,,"Wonderfully renovated original hotel. Had a drink in the 'Long Bar' with the famed Singapore Sling. Be careful - 1 x pint, 1 x 500ml beer and 1 x singapore sling cost over $NZ70!
Walk around though and soak up the atmosphere, quite delightful and yes, you can imagine you have gone back in time."
,,Style and sophistication,4.0,,"Everyone who visits Singapore has to spend some time walking the palatial halls of Raffles. Even if you are on a budget make an allowance for a little splurge here. The atmosphere hits you as soon as you enter. The leaflet ""Shopping and Dining at Raffles"" lists all the exclusive shops & restaurant's spread over three levels. Shops such as Swarovski, Louis Vuitton & Tiffany. In the evening there is live music in the central lawn and you can watch master chefs at work under a little pavilion. The Long Bar is on the second floor and Singapore Slings cost about $20. Trishaw drivers are annoying outside the hotel - they think everyone is dripping with money."
,,good quality merchandise,4.0,,"Visited after the traditional afternoon tea, some good souvenirs available to purchase at a reasonable price."
,,raffles,4.0,,A trip to Singapore is not complete without a visit to Raffles Hotel for the famous Singapore Sling. We enjoyed a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon relaxing with our drinks while we were entertained with some lovely music to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
,,"""Traditional experience - a must""",5.0,,"Overpriced but worth the experience. After alI it is Raffles. Was here in 1976 and great to see nothing much changed, except for me. Enjoyed The Long Bar, great tasting Singapore Sling, eating monkey nuts and disposing of shells on ground fantastic experience. The whole hotel worth exploring and some souvenirs to be purchased. You only live once, to hell with the price, just do it."
,,As many have said - you have to do it once,4.0,,"Things you pretty much have to at least once in Singapore regarding Raffles;

Actually go and have High Tea there. Yes you may feel lame with your little tour group sticker on your shirt but really what do you care? I mean are you expecting to run into people you know?

Go to the Long Bar and have a Singapore Sling. Make sure you take a photo of it for social media purposes. It didn't happen if you don't have photos!

Walk through the Raffles Arcade which is a nice enough experience. There is shade from the sun, some plant life, some lovely stores full of lovely and expensive things. In keeping with the theme of this review you just have to buy something. For your mother or wife or something. It doesn't matter what - anything bought from Raffles (and you might as well hand it over to them in the Raffles shopping bag) has an instant aura and you will remain in the will/be in the good books for.... well... several minutes at least!

All levity aside however Raffles Hotel Arcade has no real views, it is as expensive and swish as the hotel and really you are going to put a tick in a box and for a bit of fun. Everyone else there is doing the same thing. So turn off your inner cynic and enjoy yourself."
,,Singapore's iconic hotel is history,3.0,,"People knowing Singapore, they know Raffles hotel, once an icon of colonial style, luxury and service. If we put the emotional part aside, its not longer the icon as described before. The whole complex is screaming for a make over and it deserves it dye to its historical and architectural value. The shopping arcade can not longer compete with the numerous malls in the direct surroundings and the hotel is besides the name not longer able to compete with the surrounding hotels either. The only uniqueness is the long bar to drink a here invented Singapore sling cocktail and dream away back in time."
,,Do it at least once,4.0,,"What do you say......it was Raffles. Ridiculously priced drinks, but you have to do it once. A Beer and a Sling with the taxes $55 SGD. The Long Bar is a step back in time, The gift shop is expensive, but it's all worth a look around and the building is beautiful."
,,raffles hotel,5.0,,the building is fantastic and a trip to the long bar is so worth the time hear sit relax and enjoy a Singapore sling a little pricey but its not ever day your be in Singapore. sit eat monkey nut and as tradition drop you nut shall on the floor and you fill right at home
,,Money no object,4.0,,After tea at the hotel and Singapore slings in the long bar this is the place to spend your money. But bring your credit card the stores are as upmarket as the hotel
,,A touch old in the new,4.0,,"The buildings have been very well maintained and if alterations have been made they have been done well. The place has masses of atmosphere and you can imagine the events of its past. A short visit here is about being part of Raffles and we had difficulty choosing between tiffin or a drink, we went for the $ingapore $ling in the courtyard, and very nice it was too. Recommended."
,,a must do,3.0,,"On the must do list but not the best in Singapore. Singapore Slings in the garden were good. Have a wander through the corridors and imagine the olden days, the gift shop has lovely items."
,,Old world Carm.,4.0,,"Stay only one street away it was a must to visit the Historic Raffles hotel and Arcade which still has the early Singapore architecture and charm with a number of lovely palm court yards with many up market shops had look at the famous long bar but as it was crowded I chose to have a beer in the open foyer court yard a lot more pleasant and cheaper than the long bar at only $8.50.
its amazing contrast with all the modern sky scraper building surrounding Raffles that it still has the old world charm in a bust city."
,,Nuts at the Long Bar,4.0,,"The long bar has moved about the site a little over the years and it's hard to tell how it's current location relates to the synergy of the whole ""Raffles"" thing of history that is being played upon. That being said although renovated it retains what must be a lot of the original charm in it's style and fitout.

Drinks are priced well above average so don't be shy cough up, enjoy a sling or maybe two, and toss your shells on the floor and enjoy."
,,Gentile Shopping in Historic Arcade,4.0,,"Far from the hustle and bustle of the mainstream shopping malls and uber expensive retail plaza at Marina Bay Sands lies The Raffles Hotel Arcade where shopping is a pleasure due to the architecture and sheer history of the environment and the shops offering wide assortments of offerings not to be found in the larger stores. And if shopping becomes too strenuous in the Singaporean heat, a refreshing drink can be had in the famous Long Bar or in the courtyard. The arcade is the pick of shopping in Singapore if only to offer something different from the homogenous malls where one could be shopping in Dubai, Shanghai, Hong Kong or any other country with a penchant for designer shopping malls"
,,$ingapore $ling at Raffles Long Bar,4.0,,"A must to go to Raffles Long Bar & have a $ingapore $ling but be prepared for the bill. Nice experience, traditional colonial decor with antiquated oscillating paddle ventilation system.
We had 1 $$ at $27 & 1 pint at $20. As is that wasn't enough on top of that is a 10% service charge & 7% VAT. Altogether a pint & a cocktail cost £28.
Having said that it was a nice experience & glad we did it - but only once."
,,Raffles Hotel tour,5.0,,"Did this tour with history of Raffles, afternoon tea which was brilliant, Singapore Slings in the Long Bar [expensive but worth the experience] finished off by a bum boat ride and visit to Pewter Factory"
,,Mixing with the Upper Crust,4.0,,Raffles Hotel has managed to maintain the feeling of a little oasis in the middle of the busy CBD. The shopping mall is nice to wander in though shopping there is a little out of my reach. The Long Bar is a must and is not too intimidating for a lone female.
,,Expensive but classy!,4.0,,"No first visit to Singers is complete without a trip to Raffles Hotel. Yes it is expensive, but what an amazing place! It was an experience to wander around the public areas of the hotel and to wander through the shops. The Raffles Gift Shop had some very good quality and classy souvenirs.... and we had a Singapore Sling at the Long Bar too. The whole experience gave an insight into Singapore of a previous era."
,,"Expensive shops and posh attitude, but nice nonetheless.",3.0,,"The arcade of the famous Raffles hotel includes numerous shops, which sell mainly high-end products (electronics, clothes, food, etc.).
While visiting the shops is fun, as the place is beautiful, I cannot recommend actually buying anything here, since prices are much higher than in other places in Singapore (yeah, I guess the rent rate for the shops is huge).
Still, it's a nice 15-minute stroll."
,,Singapore Slings at Raffles,4.0,,"We called at Raffles Hotel on a recent trip to Singapore to visit the famous Long Bar and have a Singapore Sling.

The bar has a tremendous atmosphere with dim lighting, cane chairs and swinging punkhas on the ceiling and we felt guilty about flicking our peanut shells on the floor as appears to be the custom. The staff were very attentive and helped us enjoy our visit.

The Singapore slings were excellent and even though they were very expensive at 63$ for two, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

When in Singapore a visit to the Long Bar at Raffles is a must, even if you decide not to have a drink."
,,Must stop here,5.0,,We Jumped off the Hop on Hop off bus at Raffles and walked through the shopping arcade. The Raffles gift shop had several things that we purchased and after walking the rest of the arcade we had Lunch and drinks at the Long Bar. This has to be a mandatory tourist stop in Singapore. The Long Bar began service at 11:30am just in time for our lunch and a Singapore Sling. We both enjoyed this stop.
,,high tea,5.0,,"we had a high tea here it was $260 for 2 adults and 2 kids so not cheap it was good though the sandwiches were lovley and the setting was gorgeous however for that sort of money i would expect to get a free glass of champagne but we had to pay and extra 22,00 for 1 glass i was not happy about that and some of the cakes were a bit to be desired really"
,,Step back in time,4.0,,"Just called here to have a quick look due to time constraints,glad we did,you can picture how things were in colonial days,bought some items from the gift shop,quite good value which we were surprised about.beware if you buy a postcard and stamps to send abroad,the 50c stamp does not cover the postage how we laughed"
,,Historic place,4.0,,"One of the most famous hotel in Asia. This really is part of colonial history. Full of shops, restaurants and bars, most famous of course is Long Bar(birthplace of Singapore Sling)"
,,An opulent back-in-time experience,4.0,,"Of course any trip to Singapore would not be complete without a trip to Raffles. We went here to spend a few hours having Afternoon Tea (S$108) and a few drinks in their Long Bar flicking our peanuts on the floor (2 Singapore Slings S$56) and we had a lovely relaxing afternoon. This was one of the highlights of our trip.
The sandwiches and cakes were amazing, and the tea fantastic (as good as at home in the UK ha! ha!), the decor and service was beautiful. We had booked our table from the UK, but still had to queue to get in. Some people had turned up without booking but there was no chance of getting in when we went, also make sure you don't wear shorts they refused access to one couple.
An expensive afternoon but well worth it.
But.... You cannot get into the main hotel unless you are staying there, however if you're staying for Afternoon Tea there is a door by the toilets that gives you access to the hotel, we used it and had a good look around.
There is also a shopping arcade with some nice goods for momento's and a place where you can eat without booking, so if you are around and haven't booked you can just pop in."
,,Highly recommended afternoon tea at Raffles!,4.0,,"I booked a tour package through a tour company as part of a honeymoon package to Singapore with my wife, before I left the UK, which was called ""footsteps of Raffles, with afternoon tea"". Although it was raining during the start of our tour, we soon arrived at Raffles hotel for our afternoon tea. We were the first to arrive and were seated near the lobby area of the hotel. We were offered tea and told to help ourselves to the buffet food. we both viewed the food on offer and picked different foods to try, and headed back to our table, where a 3-tier cake stand had been placed, with different sandwiches and cakes to try! After trying nearly everything that was available to eat, my wife thought she recognised someone working at the Raffles hotel, and calling her over, it turned out to be someone she went to school with, back in the Philippines!! We were both delighted with the afternoon tea at Raffles hotel, and next time we travel to Singapore, we will visit Raffles for afternoon tea, or try one of its restaurants for lunch or dinner. YES the afternoon tea was highly priced, but well worth it, and we would recommend afternoon tea at Raffles if you are in Singapore!"
,,Afternoon Tea,1.0,,"The Raffles Hotel is worth a visit but not for afternoon tea.

We felt afternoon tea at Raffles was a must whilst in Singapore.

After booking several days in advance we were asked to stand in a line at the side entrance of the Hotel with the other tea partakers for 30 mins. We were shown to a small corner table in a room separated from the rest of the hotel.

There was no choice of tea and it was not made in a pot with tea leaves and a strainer. The sugar was in packets similar to a fast food restaurant. There was ample food but no ambiance or character. The service was average.

We were disappointed and did not consider the tea to be value for money"
,,Great fun for everyone,4.0,,"Singapore Sling, it has to be done, if you go to Singapore go for the cocktail, eat monkey nuts throw the shells on the floor. Sounds like hell its very touristy but what the hell, don't go home without visiting Raffles."
,,Sanctuary in the busy crossroads,5.0,,"It is a little expensive but it is worth to sit down in a garden with greenery, secluded from the busy traffic, enjoy the colonial period architecture while having your drink and can still smoke."
,,"A Legend, not to be missed",5.0,,"This iconic landmark stands amongst the many towers of Singapore's skyline.
We visited Raffles Hotel via the Hop on/off bus, the bus stop is right outside Raffles Hotel and you can exit it from many entrances.
We toured the Hotel ourselves, opting not to have an afternoon tea or evening trip.
The Hotel was quite easy to navigate, although we did have trouble locating the famous ""Long Bar"", but once on the right track, we found it and having settled ourselves down, decided not to partake in a Singapore Sling, as it was before midday, but instead ordered 2 café lattes, these with tax came to $21.20, which is expensive for 2 coffees, but just had to be done, after all we were in the Raffles Hotel. The famous monkey nuts were in bowls on every table, however we did not throw the shells on the floor, like legend goes. The room itself is quite dark, but very airy due to the ceiling fans swishing backwards and forwards, no air conditioning here. The room had quite a few items from days gone by, which was lovely to see in keeping with the atmosphere of the room.
The grounds of the hotel were magnificent, all the plants, ornate fountains, alcoves etc, it is wonderful to wander around and imagine yourself back in time, in either the late 1800s or early 1900s and yes, its FREE.
Unless you are a guest you cannot visit the Writer's Bar which is in the lobby, this features photographs of writers that have stayed at Raffles.
We also wanted to visit the Raffles Hotel Museum, this is now closed, we are not sure if this is permanent or not.
There are several shops around the hotel and a gift shop."
,,Must do when in Singapore,5.0,,"Nice experience in the long bar, Singapore slings had to be done but be prepared for a hefty bill. Lots of character and staff pleasant and efficient. The Hotel is beautiful and worth looking around if you can still stand after the slings!"
,,Great Evening,5.0,,"Raffles hotel was the last stop in our evening tour package. Great structure, location and history. We started the tour from the main entrance and then walked through the corridor. From there we walked our way to the bar upstairs for the singapore sling drink . Kids are not allowed upstairs and they had to be in the lower level of the bar. We were there for 2hours and had a great evening. A place not to be missed!!!!!!

Highly recommended to take a package with a guide to enjoy this place ."
,,Overrated overpriced,2.0,,"Had to go to this legendary place
However 2 slings £34 e pensive t say the least the bar looks over cramped tables are crushed up and staff seem under staffed experienced it but rather thought I should have took the glass with me to get my monies worth !!!"
,,Singapore sling...,4.0,,"I went to the Long Bar at the hotel simply to have the iconic Sling. While it was extortianately priced ($22USD icluding tax), for me it was worth it. I don't normally drink alcohol so this was a one-off special occasion and I took my time, soaking in the atmosphere. The hotel itself is worth a look as well, amazing looking building. I got a little lost trying to find the entrance to the bar from the front of the hotel and a staff member took me the whole way - very friendly and helpful!! All in all, a fun night."
,,Not impressed,2.0,,"Went here just for the sling and I definitely got nothing more. The decor was pretty cool as a plus but the place was a third full at best at 11 pm on a Saturday. The people that were there sat at tables vs the bar so not easy to make friends.

Did I mention 1 sling is like. 19 usd? Please drink another place"
,,A colonial icon,4.0,,"Sit in the courtyard surrounded by white walls and balconies amongst tropical greenery and for a moment imagine yourself a visitor to the British Colonial establishment. Thankfully we no longer live in those class-bound, race-discriminatory times, so one can enjoy a Singapore Sling in ethical comfort.
The Slings are extortionately priced, but they go down easily and the gin does pack a punch - so watch your tab! There's a non-alcoholic version available. Nuts are complimentary.
Unless you're a better class of traveller than me, avoid the luxury brand outlets and instead read about how this hotel was once on the seafront before land reclamation and how it survived the Japanese occupation on the info plaques. Finally, take your photo with the bust of Sir Stamford, and then head off for a more affordable dinner elsewhere."
,,Raffles Overated,3.0,,"Our visit to this icon of British occupation of Singapore was a let down. Don't go here unless you are prepared to pay through the nose for the experience and frankly I think my hard earned dollars would of been better spent elsewhere. I don't know why the drinks are so expensive, you expect a bit of a mark up but this was over the top. Go if you must, eat and drink elsewhere."
,,More expensive shops...,2.0,,....which you can find anywhere in Singapore. Around Raffles you would expect to find classy shops and they do not let you down and the Leica dedicated store does have some good images to view. You may have to save the money by not staying at Raffles to afford things in the shops !
,,Something out of a movie,4.0,,A relaxing ice coffee from the bakery and my mum had a pint of beer whilst we sat back an enjoyed a relaxing afternoon with the beautiful surrounding of this building. To me it reminded me of a scene out an old James Bond film. Loved it. It is expensive though s$20 for the beer
,,long bar raffles,5.0,,"this is the only place in Singapore your allowed to through things on the floor the things being nut shells,yes its a bit pricey but you are at raffles,the wife and I always come here on our visits to the island,its great, nice atmosphere good live music,taxis outside to whisk you off to the next sight,,,"
,,Singapore Sling - Slugged by the price,2.0,,"We were told that when in Singapore you have to visit the Long Bar at the famous Raffles Hotel. When we ventured in, it was dark and crowded and peanut shells all over the floor. We found a table and wiped all the peanut shells off the table and chairs and sat down. We looked around and saw that everyone was shelling and eating peanuts.

The cost of the two Singapore Slings was S$64.00 - the price on the menu was less, but the common Plus Plus had to be added (Tax and Charges). I could not justify ever paying that amount of money again. But I had to have a Singapore Sling whilst in Singapore. There was a large amount of ice left in the glass after finishing the drink too. The barman was making the Slings constantly. I guess with everyone eating the complimentary peanuts, made them thirsty.

Once off experience."
,,Just wandered through,4.0,,"Visited it while walking from the marina area to the national museum. Quite a fair bit was opened to passers-by, so we got a feel of the place with its lush gardens. The shop selling hotel souvenirs was surprisingly rather big and commercialized. Being the time of the Chinese mid-autumn festival, they were also selling mooncakes outside and there was a display of lanterns made by children."
,,Magnificent,4.0,,"This is one landmark of Singapore one should definitely visit. On the suggestion of the staff of the hotel where we were staying, we made it a point to visit this place at night and it simply stole our breath away. This place had been on our visiting list because of its historical significance and we were not disappointed. Rather its grandeur filled us with awe. The restaurants around it serve really good local food. We couldn’t have enough of this place and look forward to visiting it again."
,,Good to see - a must for Singapore.,4.0,,The home of the Singapore sling - it's a must to visit and taste. Expect overpriced drinks including 10 quid waters but good old fashion colonial service. Visit the log bar and be careful not to trip on the nut shells all over the floor.
,,A must see place while in Singapore,4.0,,"The Hotel is very grand and a wonderful place to relax and have a drink as we did. Prices really really high but we knew that when we went there,hence the reason we only had the one.A Singapore sling is what they are well known for. Grounds are very palatial and well kept.
One of Singapores most exclusive hotels with a lot of History,.very british."
,,"Beautiful hotel, pricey shopping",4.0,,"The hotel grounds are gorgeous and worth visiting just to sit down, have a Singapore Sling cocktail where it was invented (right at the hotel!) as well as to peruse the shops in a less than modern (but still pristine and well kept) environment. We bought a few things from Pashma and British India, neither of which are cheap, but the service was excellent and the items were very unique. Even if you're not shopping, its worth visiting just to chill at the outdoor bar and patio."
,,Nice good old historical Hotel,3.0,,"This Raffles Hotel was built dated back to the British Colonial era ,and its still one of the most exclusive hotel in Singapore.You can feel the breath of the colonial era as soon as you walk in the main gate, or stroll the surroundings, and the hotel garden.Here you can find designer arcades, and the Long Bar.The famous Singapore Sling can be bought in small bottles for SGD 26.This area also packed with nice but expensive restaurants and cafes.Can try one of these cafes and feel the colonial breeze.Worth a visit ,and i assure you , the pictures you will taken within this area will be amazing !"
,,Steeped in History,4.0,,"Raffles Hotel has a rich colonial history which is evident as soon as you walk through the door. The surrounding arcade contains the infamous ""long bar"" although sadly not the original. Singapore Slings and peanuts are a must! Arcade shops sell either Raffles branded merchandise or high end designer goods. Well worth a visit."
,,Expensive shops surrounding an elegant hotel.,3.0,,"Worth a visit if you like looking at designer outlets. The best places for a wander are the antique shops which have beautiful objects for sale at eye watering prices. There is even a shop devoted to selling Raffles hotel merchandise so even if you do not stay at the hotel you have the opportunity to buy a Raffles pen, shirt or golf tee, the choice appears endless."
,,A tinge of disappointment,3.0,,"I have wanted to go to Raffles for a long time, and when I got to Singapore it was my first point of call. As much as I enjoyed my visit, I wouldn't rush back. I was going for its history..... the small museum was now closed, I was going to drink Singapore Slings in the Long bar.... but now it appears they are not made fresh to order, but come ready made! Lastly when buying small mementos, the assistant automatically puts stamps on my postcards and charged me, then put them in a gift envelope, I didn't see what he had done until I was back in my hotel. when i was putting them with others for my collection back home, I felt taken advantaged of as I couldn't see what he was doing from the high counter I was in a wheelchair.

Overall the service was friendly, but if you want history explained, a superb Singapore Sling then I would head for the Fullerton instead after you admire the front....."
,,Worth a stroll through,4.0,,"While the hotel grounds has become a lot more touristy with the shops catering mainly to those with fat wallets, there is the odd shop with unique and hip finds. Visit Front Row, Surrender for fashion, Leica for an expensive camera. The Long Bar is worth a visit but try the Singapore sling only if you must."
,,Great for taking pictures!,5.0,,"Good: -Nice facades for taking photos. -Ample eateries. -Many branded goods have their outlets here. -The last time I visited the Raffles-Hotel-Museum, which is a gem! Bad: -Expensive parking. -Expensive hotel restaurants."
,,"Cool history & Building, Outrageous Prices",4.0,,"The building itself is very neat and if you're into history (especially literary history) you'll love sitting in the same bar as famous authors and imagining that you, too, are destroying your liver and wallowing in the social morays.

Getting an authentic Singapore Sling was an experience that my friend did, whereas I elected to just grab a beer since I was sure I wouldn't be able to afford the Sling at Singapore's crazy prices. I was mistaken. The Sling was 26 dollars and my beer was 20. Jeez.

Like everything with Singapore, if you have the money to burn it's second to none, but if you're a poor backpacker this would be definite splurging (you can just show up and walk around the open parts of the hotel, too, and that's why I gave it an extra star)."
,,Expensive/Exclusive,5.0,,Singapore sling at the Long Bar is good but over priced. The self service bakery/pastry shop is good and reasonably priced.
,,Check out the Raffles Shop,4.0,,"I was lookig for a decent souvenir of Singapore but only found the usual tourist trinkets which is essentially junk. That is until I arrived here plenty of stuff to choose from, a little expensive but an excellent range.
I wandered into the antiques store that had ancient Chinese articfacts for sale. One of a 6th dynasty lion for S$6.8 million. I took home two. Yeah sure..."
,,A glimpse of colonial Singapore,4.0,,"Nice place to go see, and get away from the usual frenzy that can be found in downtown Singapore. Great gardens, beautiful building, worth a visit."
,,Enjoy the ambience,3.0,,"Even if you not want to shop, this is one place at the heart of downtown Singapore where you can enjoy a peaceful morning or afternoon tea, amidst lush greenery. Enjoy local food fare or snacks at Ah Teng's bakery or dim sum at a restaurant on the second floor. It is seldom very crowded."
,,Landmark of Singapore history,4.0,,"While not an absolute must, a visit of the venerable Raffles Hotel and its grounds is an enjoyable undertaking The shopping arcade is interesting to browse through, whereas the hotel gift shop has a great selection of Raffles and Singapore souvenirs. The restaurant in the atrium garden is an outdoor delight. Located in the center of the city, the Raffles Hotel makes for an interesting short interlude, possibly enriched by one's first Singapore Sling enjoyed in the Raffles bar."
,,Very colonial,5.0,,"Loved it, did a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar, a must do! An amazing hotel to look around with a great gift shop."
,,Sling over to Raffles,4.0,,Another one on the list is to have a Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel Long Bar. Great choice of cocktails but frankly you have to have a Singapore Sling because this is where it came from. Raffles is steeped in history and the Long Bar is full of atmosphere. Don't forget to check it out.
,,Worth it if wandering past ...,3.0,,This isn't worth a special trip .... but sooner or later you'll walk past. It's worthwhile having a wander even if you don't have a Singapore Sling.
,,Another Age,4.0,,"This building is really amazing, it bring you to another age. When you visit it you can believe travelling to the past. Head to the bar and have a Singapore Sling. Avoid afternoon tea"
,,everyone has to have a sling in the long bar,3.0,,"OK it is highly overpriced $26 + tax and service fee for a Singapore Sling but at least I can say I have been there and done it. At least you get the peanuts for free and as it is the only place exempt from their litter law can throw the shells on the floor. Very overpriced but so what,"
,,You only live once,4.0,,"Go to Singapore and not go to the Long Bar ........never! Its pricey, but hey you only live once and the memory will always be there. A step back in time and pace - fantastic! You won't regret it."
,,Once in a lifetime,5.0,,"Go,you only live once,we had 2 Singapore slings and a beer cost£50..but at least you can eat as many monkey nuts as you want in the Long Room.Did`nt eat there as time wouldn't allow it took us 20 minutes to order our slings ,spent over 90 minutes at the bar,the slings tasted as thought they had been watered down,bit disappointed on that score but overall the hotel an experience to try,yes the whole thing is a money making exercise,would I stay at the hotel if I could afford it?probablynot as the hordes of tourists would put me off."
,,lovely atmosphere,4.0,,"OK so everyone has to visit Raffles, and do, the shops were expensive but nice to look in, the gardens were lovely and it was lovely to just soak up the atmosphere"
,,Nice Shopping Arcade,4.0,,The new shopping arcade at Raffles Hotel is extensive and on two levels. There are some high end jewelry stores but also some more reasonable places. The Jim Thompson store is quite large and was actually nicer than the main store at the Jim Thompson House in Bangkok. The arcade offers a nice contrast to the modern malls on Orchard Road. Definitely worth a look.
,,Raffles Hotel,5.0,,"It's Raffles. You just have to go, for the history of it all. The Long ?Bar and have a Singapore Sling. It's just a 'thing'. One of these things you have to do. :)"
,,"Welcome ""Tourists"" :-)",3.0,,"The bar at Raffles is famous for their Singapore Sling Cocktail. OK, been there, done that, $58 US for 2 drinks....."
,,The biggest rip off in Singapore,1.0,,"We went to the long bar at raffles for a look and a beer that was just 2 large glasses of beer. When it can time to pay it was a massive $48 I have say I was blown away and will never ever go back the service was no better than anywhere else, the place has had it's day but most of all unjustifiable prices. We went up top to the restaurant at marina sands ku da at which was awesome food fantastic, service excellent and $18 for a beer which you don't mind paying when you get the whole package. Then we went up to the 70th floor of the Swiss hotel had a pizza and a couple of beers $10 a beer and the best view in Singapore"
,,A Singapore Sling in the Raffles....how nice!,4.0,,"It is just a lovely experience to visit this hotel and have either a high tea there or a Singapore Sling in the bar. You might find it expensive, but the experience is worth it.
You go back into the time and you are starting to think about the history of Singapore. So interesting."
,,Old World,4.0,,"Raffles takes you back in time when manners reigned supreme and luxury was found here with service being paramount! The old world feel still stays, updated into the latest designer shops for clothes and jewellery. People line up for souvenirs marked with the famous ""Raffles"" brand to take home their little piece of memory of a time gone by."
,,EXPERIENCE MAGNIFICO,5.0,,"What can i say drinking with the hoy polloy at Raffles,went there to celebrate Kris and Jo Leverton' wedding and drank singapore slings...little bit pricey but just so worth it to say you have been there,especially as my father was there in 1953/54/55 and drank at the same place as i did in the Long Bar loved it......hope you like peanuts and pigeons."
,,Very expensive,3.0,,"We went to the long bar to have a must-have Singapore sling. Drink was nice however not very big. Cost $26 per drink PLUS 10% service charge Plus 7% GST. So 2 drinks cost us $61+ !
Would say it wasnt worth it and would not do again but if your into history then give it a try."
,,Long Bar - Singapore Sling,3.0,,"You really only come here for the experience and as others have put it - to tick a box, as it is a ""must do"" when you travel to Singapore. The atmosphere was great! The famous Singapore Sling - great! But boy was that an expensive drink! I ordered the Summer Sling (there are 6 types you can order) which came to the grand total of $30.60SD. Fair enough this is where the drink was created but I would not say that it was worth that much for it! Then you're part of the peanut shell throwing on the floor - a tradition at the bar. Honestly, if you go around to the other bars in Singapore they'll make the standard Singapore Sling for $16 (go to Bikini Bar @ Sentosa!)"
,,A piece of the Empire lives on.,5.0,,"This beautiful and tasteful hotel and restaurant complex retains the architecture and landscaping of the famous Raffles Hotel with a feel for the high life that Europeans got to experience at the time of the great empires. The shops are filled with good quality clothes, crafts and even cameras. Exploring the floors reveals colourful pastel murals, ornate rooms, and even a fully functional live theatre. There are multiple open air and enclosed cafes, restaurants, and ""long bars"". The landscaping is manicured and tropical. A great place to spend a tropical afternoon in another world."
,,Only if you need to tick boxes,2.0,,We were told it was a 'must do' tthing to have a Singapore Sling in Raffles. It is a rip off - almost £35 for two drinks and a few peanuts. When we visited in February the museum .had a notice saying closed from mid January. The building is well preserved and the bar does not open until 11am.
,,english heritage,4.0,,you have to have a singapore sling and eat monkey nuts where the english put their stamp on things. very busy place but a must to do. museum was shut but still nice to walk around.
,,"The Long Bar, Raffles Hotel, Singapore",3.0,,"This bar is a must if you visit Singapore, we have done the Singapore Slings many times and they are expensive, but worth it, but lately we have taken to drinking the jugs of beer, with limitless (or so it seems) groundnuts. You are given permission to chuck the shells anywhere you like on the floor, or in my handbag as my husband took great delight in doing!
It is not in the original place just into the left hand side of the main hotel entrance as it once was but now accessible from the street.
Everything it seems in the decor is geared to the old days and they even have cute little electric ceiling fans which look like the old hand fans!
AND they let me charge my iPhone behind the bar and take away a couple of Raffles beer mats for my mate!
The only downside really is the expense, which is why I did not give it a top rating.
Smoking is still allowed outside on a netted up beer verandah. There is also a VIP lounge upstairs inside the bar, I have no idea what it is like as I was not invited there, reckon maybe it is for hotel guests only!
If you are a first time visitor to Singapore, I think it is a must!"
,,Slinging it!,4.0,,"Well you do go here for the touristy Singapore Sling. Which we did. The original is ok, but we did enjoy the Autumn and Tropical slings A LOT! (And they come in bigger glasses ;) ) Everyone knows it is expensive, but once in a while in order to complete your bucketlist you have to cough up. Spent a good few hours."
,,Lovely spot for a shop.,4.0,,Some really lovely shops here in a beautiful historic building. Has a relaxed colonial charm to it and you can always add the singapore sling experience in the Raffles Bar.
,,The Long Bar,5.0,,"It's got to be done, there really are peanut shells on the floor, their Singapore Sling is the best I've ever tasted and the charming table service is a definite asset. It's not cheap, but it's worth it!"
,,Raffles Hotel - Worth a visit but not as good as we had hoped,3.0,,"Raffles was a place that had always been on my husband's 'bucket list' to visit. He had always wanted to visit the Long Bar for a drink and to soak up the 'atmosphere' we were sure we were sure would prevail from the old movies featuring the place. Guess if your expectations are high you always run the risk of disappointment, and to be honest we were! We had read other reviews on Trip Advisor before our visit so fully expected to be 'ripped off' when it came to price of drinks, and in that respect we unfortunately were not disappointed. We declined the offer of a Singapore Sling for $26 singapore dollars each, not being gin drinkers and having been put off to by others' words on this site, so spent a few minutes perusing the menu at a table in the Long Bar, having crunched our way across the floors laden with monkey nut shells, decided it felt a bit like being in any pub (apart from the prices ) and decided to have a drink in the courtyard bar instead. Two beers and $42 Singapore dollars lighter we left ! Apart from the lack of atmosphere, biggest disappointment was not be able to see the writers room as it was in an area solely for residents of the hotel. Guess at least we now know what others were asking about though."
,,Very impressive colonial style hotel,1.0,,"Had to go to Raffles especially if you are visiting Singapore. It is a must see!! We visited the Long Bar for their speciallty drink, Singapore Sling. Nothing really to brag about. It was like drinking a rum punch!! Too bad it was too pricey. We also had fried calamari which were superb. The lush gardens of the hotel were breathtaking. Our overall experience was excellent. Very pricey but worth it!! It is a must see."
,,bring home a classic oriental memory,4.0,,"The Raffles hotel boutique was filled with interesting keepsakes for those interested in this classic oriental hotel/destination. We bought folding umbrellas with the hotel logo, and will enjoy our holiday memory reminder during rainy days back home. ."
,,The Long Bar.,5.0,,"My Grandad was in Singapore during WWII, so I had grown up hearing stories of the Officers parties at the Raffles hotel. Having a few Singapore slings in the Long Bar was for me, a must do!
Very expensive but well worth it, a beautiful bar, amazing drinks, with an abundance of monkey nuts!
A Singapore Sling at the Raffles Hotel Long Bar, is a must do, for anyone."
,,It's a must to make a mess where else but Raffles Bar!!!!!????,4.0,,"whilst visiting singapore you cannot leaving without visiting "" Raffles"" We booked an organised trip off the internet costing around £35 this included the pick up and drop off from our hotel, a very informative driver who pointed out places of interest on the way to "" Raffles "" His english was excellent and very comprehensible. Also included in the price was afternoon tea set in the true English tradition of White Linen table cloths, lovely little sandwiches cut into little triangles cut into little triangles !!! and a delicious assortment of cakes to follow. After an afternoon of total refinement it was off to the Bar to down some Singapore Slings and of course the tradition being you shell the monkey nuts (peanuts) throw the shells on the floor (no worries there are plenty already there!!!) and enjoy the nuts. the Drinks cost about 30 dollars for 2 which is well worth the experience."
,,The museum is interesting,3.0,,"The Arcade itself is not very interesting, but we spent 50 mins wandering around Raffles Hotel, the arcade, their shop, and their free museum on the third floor. The museum was very interesting. Hotel still has a very colonial feel. There are some concessions to modernity, like an escalator in one part, but the lift we used to go up to the museum was very dodgy! I went to the Ladies’ Room, and it was just like an old-fashioned railway station in the UK, with dark wood everywhere and heavy toilet fittings."
,,"Beautiful Place, Exclusive Shops, Yummy Food and Drink",4.0,,"If you have never been it has to be on your to do list, just to say you have been to Raffles. The shops are exclusive brand names here. The Garden is very pretty to walk around and just take it all in.
We grabbed a snack from pastery and a coffee and it was amazing."
,,Raffles wow,4.0,,Fab place to visit the long bar with peanut shells every where was fun and food was excellent. Singapore sling a must and was very enjoyable. Not the cheapest place in Singapore but its raffles. Went into reception of hotel an took pic WOW! When I win the lottery I want to come back and stay. Worth a visit 100%
,,Raffles Hotel,5.0,,Beautiful Bedrooms & attention to detail excellent.Location excellent & you can drink the famous Singapore sling and see it eing made before yr very eyes.
,,Posh shops,3.0,,"Small overpriced establishments offering items you probably do not want at prices you would probably prefer not to pay. However it is a very pleasant walk and the garden is exceptionally beautiful, take a few minutes to just sit, wonderful! If you fancy a drink, use the garden bar. If you want a Singapore sling, don't buy it here, in my view it will not be original, go to the long bar. (separate review)"
,,Expensive SG souvenirs,3.0,,"There are plenty of touristy shops here, all at sky high prices; they are easily 3 times more expensive. I wonder why do people go there to buy when they can easily buy from much cheaper option such at those shophouses at Chinatown or at nearby shopping complexes such as People Park Complex or Pearl Centre? Lucky Plaza at Orchard Road is another value-for-money place. I went to this arcade without buying a single thing but my Japanese friend did, because it was ""highly recommended"" in her guide book.

The toilet is also located far away, depending on where you were, so if your legs were tired from a day of walking, be prepared to walk some distance to the loo."
,,Got The T-shirt,4.0,,Went to Long bar for Singapore sling. It is tourist trap and over priced but worth the experience to see the Raffles hotel. Tourists cannot go inside the actual hotel. Have the photo to show everyone. Like planet Hollywood - you visit once:)
,,Tourists.,4.0,,"As a tourist you are obligated to go to Raffles for a Singapore sling. We did so at the long bar in the courtyard and were even silly enough to buy the glasses boxed to take home along with the recipe.

The hotel itself is an excellent example of a collonial building."
,,Great views,5.0,,"Great shopping area, great views, night life great. A great tourist attraction and well worth the visit. Have a drink there."
,,"Magnificent building, magical at night, beware the bar prices!",4.0,,"We had the obligatory Singapore Slings in Raffles long bar. Lovely experience. The courtyard is beautiful at night. We sneaked into the main hotel for a peek too, jaw-dropping interior. Beware the cocktail prices, each one is the equivalent of €26 so you won't be drinking here all night!"
,,Colonial Heritage,4.0,,"The Colonial Heritage of Raffles and the significance of it is well worth a visit, to see the hotel, have a singapore sling and see the shops. Late afternoon is a good time to visit and stroll through."
,,great colonial hotel,4.0,,"beautiful place, definitely worth going there but very touristic and commercially so colonial flair is hard to catch. The bar is an interesting place but not the best recommendation if you would like to drink coffee. I would have expect a bar in a hotel of this class to know the differences between coffe, latte and cappuccino. They serve the same whatever you order in poor qualtiy and charge a fortune ...."
,,Beautiful architecture,4.0,,This hotel is a breath of fresh air in a city where many of the buildings are made of steel and glass. True colonial heritage that they preserved so well!
,,"Expensive shops, but it is the Raffles Hotel",4.0,,"This time it was simple. We stayed in the Fairmont Hotel across the street. But also on other visits to Singapore we always included the Raffles Hotel in our strolls through the city. You can sit on a bench in the courtyard and enjoy the Raffles Hotel complex, visit the museum shop or do a photo shoot with the famous Sikh doorman, but this review is about the Raffles Hotel Arcade. It is a nice stroll along expensive shops; I must confess we never made a purchase, except a Raffles Polo shirt, but that was in the museum shop actually. The same shirts are on sale in the souvenir shop in the Arcade. The shirts are expensive and the quality is disappointing after a couple of laundry cycles. However, the overall atmosphere in the Raffles Hotel is compelling enough to return there every Singapore visit."
,,good experience,5.0,,"lovely hotel, made for great photographs, good bar, enjoyed my singapore sling and monkey nuts on the floor"
,,Shopping,4.0,,Some very interesting and attractive shops. A nice cafe for cakes and snacks. It is also possible to have meals in these shops.
,,Wonderful piece of history but expensive!,4.0,,Just sitting back with an original Singapore Sling is exquisite. You can lap up the history and decadence of bygone eras. To stay is another thing. There are plenty of hotels far cheaper. Lunch or just afternoon tea is a must in Singapore.
,,MUST HAVE HIGH TEA,5.0,,You must have high tea at the famous Raffles Hotel. Staff were very friendly
,,Disappointing visit for Tea at Raffles.,3.0,,"I was excited when I booked my 'Afternoon Tea at Raffles' trip on our cruise and couldn't wait to go. Unfortunately I was very disillusioned after the event.

First of all I believed that this Hotel was connected to Sir Raffles but discovered that it is only a hotel which was named that because it is located nearby his landing place in Singapore. Obviously i didn't do my homework before booking.

There were probably 50 of us from the Queen Elizabeth ship and when we arrived we were met by Mr Singh, a very snooty Indian Raj doorkeeper who got carried away with his own authority and delusions of grandeur. Following this entrance we had to queue outside the restaurant until we were herded in and plonked anywhere there was a space at a table. The tables seated 10 or 12 people and there were a couple of cake stands on the table which held a few finger sandwiches and fancy cakes.

The only thing which was served to us was tea or coffee and we had to go to a self-service bar to collect our food. The only thing here was that there was a comprehensive selection to choose from but it was like visiting any self-service restaurant. Needless to say I was totally underwhelmed.

The shops in the arcade are very expensive boutique-type establishments and I didn't see any of our crowd buying anything. The Long Bar was upstairs and when I went up there was not a soul in there except for the bar-keeper but there were peanut shells all over the tables and floor. I discovered that a 'Singapore Sling' cocktail could be had for the princely sum of $27!

If, like me, you expect an 'afternoon at the Ritz' type experience then this is not for you."
,,Beautiful colonial building,4.0,,"Beautiful colonial building. You can walk through most of the premises, and visit the long bar on the first floor. Don't forget to have a Singapore Sling."
,,Clean & Posh,4.0,,"A great place to shop if you have money to splash out. It is situated outdoors within the raffles hotel complex. Nice to have a look, but cannot afford shopping there"
,,Afternoon tea Tiffin room excellent service and experience,5.0,,"I read all the reviews before we went and was apprehensive as it appeared from trip adviser reviewers very touristy and poor service.
We booked for afternoon tea in Tiffin Room and wonderful experience and top class service.
We were not hurried out as per previous reviewers and waiting staff very courteous and helpful.
Food was good and tea was topped up as were sandwiches
Went to Long Bar after and not to be missed but Singapore sling very sweet and not sure if any alcohol or not. We spent about 3 hours in total in the grounds and bars and definately not to be missed experience."
,,singapore sling perfection,5.0,,"we were visiting family and were taken around the tourist spots and experiences, this being the first of many. it was like stepping back in time , colonial but very pleasant. it was busy in the bar and a strange experience crunching/walking over the peanut shells , which are apparently obligatory too be thrown on the florr after opening. the singapore sling was 'perfection' in a glass a definite MUST DO . 4 drinks of 2 cocktails n 2 beers approx £60 so judge for yourself if value for money, i personally say yes it was."
,,Shopping Expense,3.0,,"fairly boring mall of outrageously expensive shops .. however, a must see in Singapore. Its Raffles!"
,,Slinging the sling in Singapore,4.0,,Walking up the stairs to the Raffles long bar was a thrill. I was imagining all the people who had done this before and also imagining telling my kids in the future I've had a Singapore Sling in the home of the sling. The service was fast and friendly and professional. The fans in the ceiling were quite cool too. There was a range of tourists there including families with younger children. Most people had made an effort to dress for the occasion however there was no sense that if you turned up in thongs and shorts you would be turned away. The choice of Slings was the only issue of the night. Probably all six would be a bit over the top so I settled for one instead. Delicious!
,,You can't come to Singapore and not have a Sling!,4.0,,"A visit to the long bar at Raffles for a singapore sling should be on every first time visitor to singapore's list!

yes its expensive, but its a must do and we thought it was definitely worth it (in fact we had two!).

The surroundings of the hotel and long bar take you back to a different era and the monkey nut thing is a fun gimmick. Speak to anyone who's been to Singapore before and ask them what you should do and they'll say 'have a sling at Raffles'... its a good experience and a great photo opportunity! Highly recommend!"
,,Colonial Elegance,5.0,,"A 'must visit' when in Singapore - the Raffles Hotel Arcade - simply for window shopping or sipping a ""Singapore Sling"" from the infamous Long Bar 2nd floor. The shopping arcade is in pleasant surroundings - off the busy streets facing inward to a lovely courtyard. Have high tea at Tiffin Room - or a coffee and danish from Ah Beng's Bakery and stroll the arcade."
,,Overated and Overpriced,3.0,,"Sorry, but this was nothing special, in fact disappointing. Yes the building is attractive and steeped in history but that's where it ends. And with a Singapore Sling at £15 a head they really are having your pants down, even though you get the free nuts. Save your money and go elsewhere and stick to soft drinks. Alcohol is outrageously priced."
,,"A Singapore ""must see""",4.0,,"You really shouldn't miss Raffles when you come to Singapore. It's a fascinating place; very evocative of a bygone era. The architecture and gardens are beautiful and there are a lovely range of shops to visit, including the Raffles gift shop which has some lovely items, albeit at slightly expensive prices. We had a lovely lunch at Ah Teng's Bakery - freshly cut sandwiches and a soft drink/tea/coffee all for $13.00 each, which we thought was excellent value. Then up for the obligitory drink in the Long Bar. The non-alcoholic Singapore Sling is really very tasty but very, very sweet! I would certainly include Raffles on your Singapore itinerary. I'm very glad I did!"
,,the mini 5th avenue of new york,5.0,,"the arcade has most of the top tier branded shops that you can find in Singapore and the shop is small but adequately stock. It is also like the condense version of Orchard road , in which most branded items are house here."
,,See the old world,3.0,,"This is one way of seeing inside Raffles Hotel, or at least some of it/ Experience how the colonials saw Singapore. Sit in the cool, and have a drink, of course it needs to be a Singapore Sling. The shops are expensive, even the Raffles shop is expensive, but there are reasonably priced souveniers. This reduces the overall rating for me. Make sure you get a cake and a coffee and Ah Tings Coffee shop."
,,Evocative of a bygone age,5.0,,Raffles Hotel has so much atmosphere you can easily imagine yourself back in its heyday as you walk around. The little museum is very interesting and sets the scene for you. The shops are very tasteful and its well worth a visit even if the budget doesn't stretch to a Singapore Sling.It was lovely just to wander round and sit in the courtyard by the fountain. Look out for the doorman.
,,Singapore sling is a must!,5.0,,the drinks are extremely pricey! The bar is amazing though..they through the shells of the nuts on the floor and its very clean considering. The fans on the ceiling are amazing they are actually shaped like old fashioned hand fans. Singapore sling was delicious! Although one round of drinks and your out of cash lol
,,High Tea at Raffles,4.0,,"It is just as a high tea needs to be. Tea, scones and other delicious English delights. Also some local delights available, what is a treat. Bubbles to get it all posh in this beautiful, astonishing environment. We had a lovely time and enjoyed every minute of it.
(be aware of the dress-code)"
,,Can't beat this place for a taste of the past.,4.0,,"Even if you don't have a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar or buy an overpriced tea-towel in the hotel shop, Raffles is still worth a visit.

Find yourself a little spot in one of the verandahs and wonder at the colonial beauty of this building. If you go on a quiet day, you can really appreciate the sound of the fountains and the coolness of the palm trees.
You don't need to spend any money to use your imagination and pretend that it is the 1920's and you are enjoying the hotel at its most glamorous.

I love it here, the Singapore Sling is just an added bonus (honest)!"
,,The most fashioable place in Singapore,5.0,,You can find a lot of shops with contemporary fashion in Singapore. Visit the second floor!
,,if you don't visit will your trip be complete,4.0,,"The Long Bar is well worth a visit, food good and reasonably priced, drinks expensive, but a must do thing"
,,Pricy eats. Expensive boutiques. Just what you expect.,3.0,,"Its ok. this is a historical building so much of it is well-preserved but apart from that, its just like any hotel shopping arcade."
,,Everything we thought it would be!,4.0,,Visited as part of a tour (although our son questioned were we old enough!) Thoroughly enjoyable
,,Check out the Long Bar,5.0,,"We had a drink at the Long Bar, a relic of colonial times. There are rattan fans on the ceiling, manipulated by pulleys, to create a breeze, that was airconditioning in those days. It was not easy to get a table so we sat at the bar counter where wooden boxes of peanuts are placed in front of you. You drop the shells on the floor which was ankle deep in them. The Long Bar has wonderful atmosphere, it is really worth a visit. Most people seemed to be drinking Singapore Slings, but we had the local beer which was good."
,,Light luncheon with lots of history,5.0,,"Finally made it to Raffles and was not disappointed. From the tall, regal doorman, who was gracious to have his photo taken with our daughter, to the magnificent florist, shops and more. Of course, the highlight would ahve been to have a high tea, but we didn't book (silly is) and to sip on a Singapore Sling."
,,The legendary Raffle Hotel Resort Complex (the OTHER side of the Hotel) is worth a visit for its interesting and educational lit,5.0,,"Actually, the entire district around the City Hall area is an attractive, popular place for the tourists and locals alike.  It's an easy access by MRT, at the City Hall Station. In this area, the legendary Raffle Hotel Resort Complex (the other side of the hotel) is a must visit for its interesting and educational little museum/gift shop, free admission), the charming courtyard with a bar, and ESPECIALLY for its famous Long Bar Steak House and Long Bar (separate, next door to each other) on the 2nd floor, as well as its variety of nice boutique shops on different floors. They are accessible by escalators and elevators. We used the stairs once and were surprised to see that the stairs were made of marble!

THE INTERESTING LITTLE MUSEUM AND GIFT SHOP & THE LONG BAR

- Initially, my wife and I were really only looking for the famous (OK, notorious) Long Bar in the Raffle Complex, but were pleasantly surprised to stumble into this great little museum/gift shop on the 3rd floor. We went in and learned a few interesting stories about the hotel's past and its distinguished guests, not to mention its collection of historical artifacts!

Yes, after walking around the beautiful complex, it is recommended to have a drink in the legendary, old style, Long Bar, or just go in and have a look see - it'd be an interesting experience.  This bar is famed for its invention of THE ""Singapore Sling"" and for leaving peanut shells on the floor everywhere!

By the way, from here, the popular Esplanade district by the Marina Bay, where the Merlions are, is only 15min pleasant walk away.

,,Peanuts,5.0,,The Long Bar - everyone should visit at least once
,,Fun to see,3.0,,"Prices of the boutiques are not in my price zone, and you can find compareable things way cheaper in Singapore, and even more cheaper in Malaysia and Indonesia"
,,Old coloniel feel,4.0,,"Nice place to stroll after dinner, not rowdy and quiet. Nice shops around, might be able to find something to bring home to remember Singapore of."
,,2 different worlds,2.0,,"Decorated very well in its own context. Posing as a shopping and dining ground, choices are too limited. Entertainment value zero. If not for its historical value, it is really not a place to be."
,,So British Colonial,4.0,,Would go back again and again. Very expensive shops but just nice to walk through and check them out.
,,Interesting Shops,4.0,,"I was happy to find a Jim Thompson store (Thai) and there are some beautiful albeit expensive shops to wander in. Make sure you go to Raffles shop - there are some fun (posters, tea towels, postcards) gift items there too."
,,Agree with the other reviewers....,2.0,,"All you really have access to are the shops and the bar - one can not even see the lobby unless one is a guest.

I was disappointed. We thought about having some tea, but it appeared that reservations were required (though it was Chinese New Year, so a special occasion.)

So, overall, a disappointment. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the lovely old hotel, and I understand why they don't want non-guests wandering through their establishment, but maybe the guidebooks shouldn't promote it so much."
,,Raffles shopping experience,4.0,,"So you want to experience the Raffles but you are not a guest. The hotel are happy to have visitors in part of their grounds such as the gardens and the hotel arcade shops.

So meet the famous doorman and you can visit the rather overpriced shops in the arcade, the gift shop is the most interesting and although overpriced they do have decent quality stuff and it is hard to resist a memento of the hotel and always keep an eye out for sale items.

A lot of people head to the bar for a Singapore sling, we tend to go to the cafe, for a coffee and cake, it is much more reasonable on the wallet.

If its a nice day take a stroll in the gardens and take a few photos enjoying the charms of the colonial grounds of the Raffles hotel."
,,Everyone said go here.... why???,3.0,,Yes its an old elegant hotel - but you can't get in the lobby to take a peek. Shops were ok and overpriced. With all the nice malls in the area why even bother with this place.
,,A charming classic,5.0,,A classic and charming hotel. Full of style. Don't miss bar and billiards room
,,Singapore Sling time,4.0,,"The hotel and grounds look nice but we only visited to try a Singapore Sling in the famous Long Bar. Drinks seemed expensive in Singapore but here was very expensive! However, they were delicious and eating monkey nuts and throwing the shells to the floor is good fun! It was interesting to see somewhere with history and tradition- glad we did it (though we only had one each due to cost!)."
,,nut shells on the floor,5.0,,The place in town to have an expensive round of drinks and throw nut shells on the bar floor - the only place in Singapore that looks messy and is traditional and expected!
,,Free and beautiful to walk and enjoy,4.0,,"This hotel is so pretty. It is very symmetrical and calm. The gardens are mature and well maintained. You feel important just walking around here. The shops and bar are expected and typical, over priced, gotcha places. We had lunch at the outdoor garden bar one day. Service was non existent and we paid $92 for 1 club sandwich, 1 glass of wine, and 2 lime waters. Still, very good ambiance."
,,Pricey but worth every penny!!,5.0,,Don't forget to sippin the national famous drink Singapore Sling at the Long Bar. Kinda pricy but worth every penny guarantee
,,CLASSIC,4.0,,Entrance permitted only to hotel guest. This is not nice. Is a classic style hotel nothing more.
,,Majestic property. Iconic brands. Cant better interns of old world decadence,4.0,,"The Raffles Hotel Arcade is the home to most of the Iconic fashion, watch and jewelry brands in the world. The entire ambience of the Raffles hotel and its arcade is zoo soothing apart from buying a hole, and a big one at that in your wallet :-)"
,,Charming old hotel,4.0,,Nice collonial building but the areas that the public access is the public shops rather than the hotel proper.
,,Even the hotel gift shop is great- seriously!,4.0,,"Most times, hotel gift shops are a little cheesy and you would only buy something out of desperation (think toothbrush, Tums and the like). This gift shop has a varied selection of gift that although pricey could be precious keepsakes of your time in Singapore. The Jim Thompson shop is also fun. Wonderful textiles await you from scarves, pillow cases, wraps, shirts and a collection of women's toiletry items (jewelry rolls, cosmetics bags, glass holders, extra. The store also has a special collection of Jim Thompson stuffed elephants. The woman that told me about the shop had purchased stuff elephants for her now two young adult children. Both kids still had their elephants. There is a Tiffany's on premises which is always delightful."
,,A must!!,5.0,,"Being so far away from home I've really missed a good old fashioned cup of tea. Hotel freebies just don't do it soma trip to Raffles Hotel for ""high tea"" is essential. As sir Stamford raffles is a big part of Singapore history and future You'll hear much about how he transformed the city from a small fishing village to an international power house but maybe not so much about traditions, foods, drinks and cultures he brought too.
Most would see this as possibly a little old school but its really great and the unlimited tea and pastrys, cakes and sandwiches scores a big thumbs up. Quality food and attentive staff complete a fine afternoon!!"
,,A drink at the Raffles Hotel Long Bar brings back the days of empire and glory.,4.0,,"If louvered shutters, whirring fans and rattan do it for you (they do it for me because I am an old Brit at heart), then have a Singapore Sling here. But be prepared for a hefty price (around $27) and for being detoured around the hotel areas for Guests Only. The bar is on the second floor, in a back corner."
,,Worth a stroll through if you're in the area; have a Singapore Sling in the historic Long Bar,4.0,,"Raffles Hotel is situated in the center of Singapore, adjacent to shops and business offices.

It is some distance from the main shopping area on Orchard Road.

There's a nearby underground railwat station and many cabs, so it's easy to get there.

The Hotel is an interesting place to visit, to enter another world of relaxed ""colonial"" style refinement and comfort.

There's several shops within the Hotel Arcade, including one where you can buy Raffles souvenirs and memorabilia- such as Singapore Sling mix!

While you're here, you could enjoy a meal, or go upstairs to the Long Bar, for a refreshing Singapore Sling in the unique atmosphere of the bar. Really, this is a ""tourist trap""; most of the patrons appear to be tourists having the obligatory Singapore Sling and peanuts (you shell the complimentary peanuts and drop the shells on the floor).

Nonetheless, it's a fun thing to do, and not super expensive!"
,,A visit to the Long Bar; home of the (very expensive) Singapore Sling!,4.0,,"If you are like me and you wanted to experience the Singapore Sling in it’s “home” then you will be happy to pay the exorbitant price and soak up the atmosphere for a while. Definitely not a place that you’d want to settle in for an afternoon of drinks though – it would cost a fortune. The novelty of bowls of peanuts on the tables which you can crack, eat and then discard the shells on the ground below was also part of the experience. An interesting but not essential tourist outing in Singapore."
,,'Afternoon Tea at The Bakery ' What a Disappointment,2.0,,"We visited, like many tourists and travellers The Raffles Hotel. Iconic yes, Beautiful yes.
Afternoon tea, the read up in the paper prior to leaving indicated that this tradition had been re-introduced so we were looking forward to an expensive but luxurious afternoon tea!
We got, Atea bag in a tea cup ,plastic milk, and a cake on a plate served in a very basic cafe with marble top tables, no fine afternoon tea here. Just bog standard cafe. And not cheap."
,,Good except for...,3.0,,"We had 2 days in Singapore on the way home from Australia so did what lots of other people do and went to Raffles Hotel. The Hotel itself is quite pretty and we enjoyed a stroll round, before stopping in the Courtyard Bar for a lime juice and a Singapore Sling. It was pricey but that was expected, but we were very surprised to have to wait 30 minutes to be served (even though my husband went to the bar to check it was table service) and then only got served because my husband asked the waiter as he cleared another table nearby. When we told our friend who collected us from the Airport he said he had exactly the same experience 5 years ago. Clearly they will keep getting tourists visiting to say 'I had a Singapore sling at Raffles' but it would be nice if the service improved."
