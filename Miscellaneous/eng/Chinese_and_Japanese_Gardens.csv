,,Closed,2.0,,Japanese & Chinese gardens are closed until 2021 . Not really information for the tourist . We went to the garden and very des appointed to see the gardens ( both.....) closed till 2021 .
,,Closed until the end of 2021,3.0,,"We arrived there in the beginning of June and there was a warning about the Chinese and Japanese gardens being closed for the next two years. If you're planning to visiting the rest of the park, please use the Lakeside MRT station. The Chinese Gardens station leads to a dead end."
,,Good morning visit,5.0,,The Chinese and Japanese Gardens were lovely to walk round. Climb to the top of the pagoda for stunning views over the gardens. We were lucky to see a large lizard swimming in one of the lakes.
,,Very different from the SG botanical gardens,5.0,,"Really pretty, lots of exercise for walking the large and spread out gardens. It opens at 6 am and it’s free. I noticed a small sign that said much of it will close for renovations from end of May 2019 to 2021. Check to see which parts are still open before the trek out there."
,,New Jurong Lake Garden,4.0,,"A newly redevelop garden for all to enjoy their morning or evening walks. There is a children’s playground too if one is coming as a family. It’s a place for all occasions. Bird watching, exercise, barbecue, site seeing, etc. Definitely worth a trip with friends and family."
,,Away from the hustle and bustle,5.0,,"Well worth the 25 minutes or so MRT journey away from the centre of Singapore. The tranquility is a welcome change in this dynamic city. Very easy to get to, just exit the East-West line at the appropriately named Chinese Garden stop. It is very easy to spend several hours wandering around. The Bonsai area is both interesting and beautiful. Make sure you take plenty of water, the heat and humidity can be sapping."
,,Idyll in Singapore’s western heartland,4.0,,"These two themed gardens are located on two separate islands in Jurong Lake. They provide a leisure and recreational location in the west of Singapore.
In the latter half of 2019 these gardens upon completion of Jurong Lake Gardens these two gardens will become smaller themed gardens within the greater Jurong Lake Gardens that encompasses the Chinese Garden and Japanese Garden."
,,One of a kind in Singapore!,5.0,,"Very nice place to have a walk and take photos, maybe the only place in Singapore with such beautiful buildings and structures inside like the stone boat, twin pagoda, bonsai garden and the Japanese bridge. Have easy access to toilets in the garden. Highly recommended for anyone who would like a half-day out!"
,,Calm and healing,5.0,,the place is huge with super calming ambience where we can breath a fresh -clean air.. The pagoda were great.. everything were just lovely and gorgeous.. oh! and we found a super big Lizards! awesome! super quiet and maybe even good for meditation ❤
,,Tranquil,4.0,,"Don’t go here when they have a happening going on. Instead go here on a normal day when it is free.

The spot is a perfect getaway from the chaos in Singapore. It is mostly deserted so you can basically have it for yourself. Take in the atmosphere for a few hours and then move on.

Don’t bother trying to eat here you will only be disappointed."
,,Enjoy this tranquil place,5.0,,"This was our second visit here. This time we were here on a Saturday morning and there was some sort of event with lots of children around, so it was not as peaceful as our first visit! But we still enjoy this place. Very picturesque with lots of photo opportunities. The Chinese Garden is more extensive and interesting than the Japanese Garden."
,,Love this park - certainly worth spending time there,5.0,,This place is awesome. We loved just walking around the park. It is such an amazingly peaceful place. The fact that there is no entry fee is a plus. The structures there were quite enjoyable to explore. Especially the pagoda which offers great views of the entire park from the top. I would highly recommend going there and spending a couple of hours.
,,Superb relaxation,5.0,,After Jurong birds park this was excellent place to walk and rest and this will definitely like to kids as there are lot of things to see - for us it was different horoscope signs in form of sculptures or benches (great for photos) and bonsai trees (some of them more than 100 years old). Also views from pagoda was very good.
,,Different designs,3.0,,"Not as good as the Gardens by the bay, but still worth a visit to appreciate Chinese and Japanese garden designs"
,,"Worth a Visit, Given Time",5.0,,Takes a while to get there via MTR but it really is a beautiful and serene park and a welcome respite from the city.
,,A small alternative to the Botanic Gardens,5.0,,Large open park space easily accessed through MRT station. Beautifully maintained and incorporating extensive bonsai collection and sculptures relating to Chinese Zodiac characters.
,,"Lovely gardens, interesting train ride",4.0,,"We enjoyed the very well kept Chinese Garden, especially the bonsai trees. You can see turtles sunning themselves and some interesting birds. There are plenty of shady spots although it was quite hot. A little stall at the gate sells cold bottled water, drinks and snacks. The MRT train takes you to the start of the entrance path and by travelling on the red north south line we had a very interesting view of the suburbs. No sign of an open tea house. There are toilets."
,,A bit off the beaten track but worth it,4.0,,"What a find ! We travelled on the metro , which is elevated much of the way, so a treat to a visitor.There was hardly any one about mid afternoon, so we just meandered around which was super.The pagoda is just open so we climbed to the top, whilst before we had loved the bonsai collection, we even saw otters on the lawns ."
,,Must Be Seen,5.0,,"It is absolutely magnificent. 7 Stories Pagoda, Twins Pagodas, Bonsai Garden, Chinese New Year Characters Park are on Chinese Park Island and Stone Lantern Exhibition on Japanese Island are worth to be seen as well as small and large bridges. Highly recommended to be seen."
,,A Must Visit,5.0,,The gardens are absolutely beautiful. This must be on your list of things to do in Singapore. Just a short metro ride out of the city. It's free and so worth your time.
,,Out of the city but worth the trip,5.0,,This part is not in the main part of the city so could easily be missed but shouldn’t be. There is so much to see and on a nice day it’s a great place to walk around and explore. The colours are so vibrant and the greenery just beautiful. I loved the bonsai exhibition as well. Really pretty. Take some tome to soak it all in and enjoy the peacefulness of the gardens.
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,Much bigger than expected and so peaceful. A large bondi garden and the MRT goes there. Take a picnic and chill out with the locals
,,a nice walk,4.0,,the gardens are very nice to walk through and see the monitor lizards! it is a nice clean garden to have a picnic in - i would recommend for a nice afternoon or morning walk
,,An absolute hidden jewel in Singapore,5.0,,"We had previously been to the Botanical Gardens, the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in Singapore. Hand on heart, we both rated the Chinese & Japanese Gardens for more highly, and enjoyed them a great deal more.

The Gardens are easy to get to: just hop on the MRT East West line (green) and get out at Chinese Garden. You'll see the pagoda peeking out over the trees, and a long, straight path takes you right there. The gardens are free entry.

There is a wonderful view over the gardens and surroundings from the top of the pagoda. The gardens are beautifully kept and as clean and tidy as you would expect of Singapore. The Chinese bonsai garden is utterly beautiful, and having been to the gardens in Suzhou, China, on which they are modelled, we can confirm that they are astonishingly accurate and well done. The trees are so beautiful, too.

Despite being at the gardens on a Saturday, we were astonished how few people were there. It was an absolute oasis of peace and tranquility, accompanied by the sound of birdsong.

There is nowhere to buy food, so you will need to take your own if you need to eat. There is a vendor selling reasonably-priced cold drinks and water at the entrance.

The highlight for us was a completely accidental one: we discovered three families of wild, smooth-coated otters in the Jurong River (on which the gardens were built). We stood for a very long time, watching them catching and eating fish, and playing with their pups. It was an absolutely magical once-in-a-lifetime event.

Don't count on seeing the otters, but even without them, be sure to visit these beautiful gardens. It will be time well spent."
,,Chinese and Japanese Gardens in Jurong,5.0,,"Chinese and Japanese Gardens in Jurong.
Had a chance to visit these 2 gardens and was charmed by their beauty. Do allocate more time when visiting the 2 gardens their unique architecture and buidings, eg. the teahouse, the pagoda and the bridges.
Great for locals and visitors to visit."
,,Charming park ❤️,5.0,,"Charming park ♥️ to relax and to skip to the beautiful nature ❤️ very big garden alot of landscape, I love it and wish to visit it again"
,,Tranquil,5.0,,"One of the easiest parks to get to. Just get off of the chineese garden mrt and take a short walk to the park and you are there! The park is beautifully laid out and if you are looking for some quiet time this is the place to be. Traveling with a tiny baby under the age of two can be hectic. From fish to birds to lizards they have them all here and it sure keeps the little one entertained. Only drawback though is that the park has no eateries within the vicinity so you have to take your own food. It's best to travel in the morning as some of the trails are quite sunny. The park is free to all. Sadly the bonsai garden was closed during my visit. Most pagodas except for a very few are stroller accessible. Beautiful architecture and stunning craftmanship on the statues! Compaired to the botanical gardens this is quite smaller in size. However, this is one of the most quietest gardens I have been to. Will visit often. I'm a true fan!"
,,Great trip out of the city - all super easy on the MRT,5.0,,We wanted to see more than the centre and this trip did it for us on our short visit to Singapore. That is not to downplay the gardens themselves - very pleasant. Awe-inspiring bonsai - the oldest one we saw was 1837!! Enjoyed the views from the pagoda too - nice cooling breeze up there.
,,Best underrated park in Singapore,4.0,,"Not a very famous place, totally underrated for me. Big and nice park with a lot of decorations, you need about 2 hours to see it all. For me, the best park in Singapore, after Gardens by the Bay and the Botanical Garden."
,,Peaceful Garden,3.0,,"We went on a saturday afternoon, it is a bit far from the centre but the long journey is worth it to visit this one of a kind garden, it is very unique, and very photo worthy too and the best part is that this garden is free, no entrance fee, anyone can just enter this garden"
,,Jogging around Chinese and Japanese Gardens,4.0,,"Had not been here in many years and attempted a nice 10km run around the lakes here. Parked at Jurong East Sport Complex and first ran out northwards on the park connector, then coming back to Boon Lay Way, turned West into Jurong Lake Gardens West, following the path around the water. Unfortunately part of the waterfront is being redeveloped, so had to follow a detour off the water. Then did 2 loops each on the two islands that host the Chinese and Japanese, before turning back into Jurong Lake Gardens East. Beautiful, especially on the 2 islands. On public holidays, there are often too many people here for running."
,,Most area sealed off,3.0,,Used to be another good place for running and walking for couples. However now most areas are blocked off. There are also lots of trucks around the area now.
,,"Wonderful gardens, wildlife and water",5.0,,"Since we last here 5 years ago, the Chinese and Japanese Gardens have been much improved. Everything looks a lot neater, better maintained. Easy to get to on the MRT. We chose a Sunday when all the maids and their friends come here to picnic and party on their one day off. Nevertheless the gardens were fairly tranquil and peaceful. We saw our first monitor lizard on this visit. The bonsai garden is looking particularly good. A lovely stroll for about and hour or two."
,,So much wildlife.,4.0,,"A relaxed tourist exploration of this park will take a 0.5 day upwards. Chinese Gardens (EW25) is the stop on the MRT. From the station a walk down to the pond along a straight scantily tree lined path through playing fields is the way. Drinks are available at the entrance and public toilets are available at a few locations. The paths are mostly flat and tarmac'd.
The buildings in the park are very modern and hence a bit fake. Don't expect ancient authentic buildings. More of a toned down Las Vegas regarding the architecture. The tower did give good views of the surrounding parkland.
There is an abundance of wildlife, both airborne and aquatic. The highlight for me were the Malaysian water monitor lizards cruising around the large pond and occasionally stomping around the edges. At first sight I thought it was a crocodile but nope! Just a 2 meter long water monitor. You are probably guaranteed to see these animals here.
The Bonsai garden is stunning. Great setting and a superb amount of atmospheric Bonsai. Many artistic pieces. I'm no Bonsai enthusiast but in my opinion it is an exceptional collection of Bonsai.
In the park you can also find statues of notable characters and Chinese calendar astrology.
A great place to lounge for best part of a day."
,,Modern Version of Sung Dynasty Gardens,4.0,,"The Chinese Garden is quite nice. A traditional Chinese garden will combine four elements: rock, water, plants and buildings, and will provide the visitor with interesting and pleasant vistas around every bend, often surprising the eye. This one does meet those standards. It’s less than 50 years old, but it was well-designed based on Sung Dynasty principles. The garden is in Jurong, an unimpressive blue-collar residential part of town, far from the city center, and unfortunately the drab mid-rise residential buildings mar some of the nicest vistas. Still, you do get a seven-story pagoda, quite nice lakeside pavilions, an ornate sign in calligraphy, and a statue of a fat and jolly Confucius. (Personally I’ve never pictured Confucius as either fat or jolly, but the Confucian Academy in Beijing itself has a modern statue of Master Kung with an ample pot-belly, so I’m officially out-voted).

If you’ve never seen a proper Chinese garden, I would be inclined to recommend this as an option once you’ve seen all your high-priority attractions (Zoo, Gardens, the top museums, Southern Ridges, and so on). If on the other hand you’ve been to Yu Yuan in Shanghai, or the UNESCO-rated gardens in Sozhou, you might want to take a pass on this one.

One other qualifier: I hiked here after spending the day on Bukit Timah, arrived late, and saw only the Chinese garden, not the adjacent Japanese one, having seen quite a few of them in Japan. Since they’re cheek by jowl on two adjacent islands, if you’ve never seen either a Chinese or a Japanese garden, coming her to see both of these might well be worthwhile. I’ll attach photos of the seven-story pagoda, the lakeside pavilions, the inscription in calligraphy, and that ho-ho-ho Confucius."
,,Wonderful Pagoda and Bonsai Garden,5.0,,"Wonderful garden that looks like an expansive palace. The biking trail, bonsai garden, lake and canopies gives it a remote look contrast to crowded town of Singapore. Its lakeside is a peaceful place to relax and read books."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"My husband saw these gardens as he went by with a train and on our last day we visited them. It takes a bit from the center to get there but they are well worth it. They are kept super well and like everything else in the city, clean. You can walk a lot and just relax there. Good place for a picnic or to hang out."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"We visited this location on a Friday, around midday. It was easy to reach by public transportation. The area is huge! If you want to see it all, you'll have to spend more than 2 hours I think. We walked for almost 2 hours, and we didn't see all areas. Great place to visit, free of charge."
,,Pleasing visit to Chinese Garden,4.0,,"I stayed in Jurong East near Jurong Polyclinic. So, I walked 1.5 km to Chinese garden thru Jurong Swimming complex, Yuhua Hawker centre, cross Boon lay way, took Walking trail near Jurong lake and reached there. There is an area between Chinese Garden MRT and the Garden itself. Its huge enough to play some sports like cricket, football and others. I visited with my Brother who was working there. We were roaming all over the Garden. Please visit at slow pace to enjoy the place. During weekend, too much crowd. Pagoda building was awesome to visit. The Garden was clean and well maintained."
,,Top gardens!,5.0,,"It was a long ride on SMRT from City Hall to Chinese Gardens 裕华园.

A minimum of two hours stroll, to take in the different areas and history, would be about right.

I would also recommend, if possible, viewing the close and far sceneries from the top (7th level) of the tall pagoda.

One of the top gardens in Singapore."
,,Traditional,5.0,,"Definitely a place worth visiting whenever you are free! The pagoda is very beautiful and because of it's size, it definitely draws the attention."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"The giant Pagoda is beautiful, as well as the Bonsai garden. Great place to see if you are staying in Jurong."
,,Huge garden at the city,4.0,,Took off from Chinese Garden MRT station. You can see a tall pagoda. It was very hot so you should bring a hat or umbrella. It's a good visit to relax (even though the weather was super hot)
,,Next to Chinese Garden MRT,4.0,,"Get down at Chinese Garden MRT and you practically walk into the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Chinese garden has a bonsai garden and a tortoise museum which has world's largest collection of turtle-tortoises(around 2500 species - including 1,000 live specimens). Bonsai garden will close at 5 pm and tortoise museum will close at 6:00 pm. Japanese garden has a beautiful pond and you can look out for Malaysian water monitor lizard."
,,Super Nice Public Park BONSAI MUSEUM AMAZING,5.0,,"very nice outing time in a public park. Again Singapore have fantastic opportunities to destress,Walking in a super cute place with a unique Bonsai museum and facilities to sit and rest. Enjoy SIngapore"
,,Beautiful walking area,5.0,,"Well worth the visit and easily accessed via the MRT which has a station that opens directly into the area with a short stroll across and park. Enjoyable at any time but we visited early in the morning to avoid the heat. (Opens at 5am! ). Some improved signage internally could help,visitors to identify the various areas and the distances between them."
,,Very Pleasant,4.0,,"I chose to use the Singapore train system to make my was to the gardens [an inexpensive mode of transport].

The Gardens are a short walk and review of the offering can be completed in 2 hours.

The gardens are lovely and set in an easy walking pattern, the gardens have a number of monuments scattered along the way - It was worth the time BUT I think the Botanical Gardens are superior."
,,Interesting. My son love the turtle museum in the garden itself,3.0,,We went to the Chinese Garden as there is a turtle museum. The turtle museum is very interesting and there is a wide specious of turtles. Many of them I have never seen before.
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"The garden, buildings, statues and monuments were in an excellent condition and you can climb up the various pagodas to get a bird's-eye view. One of the most beautiful gardens we've visited.

Reach it by MRT, alight at the Chinese Garden station. It's a bit outside the city centre."
,,No Moon Cake Festival / Mid-Autumn Festival 2018 for chinese garden,4.0,,"Nearest MRT station is Chinese garden Mrt station (EW25).
Need to walk about 6 to 8 mins to Chinese garden east entrance from Mrt station. There are no shelter along the way and beware of steep sloop along it.
There are people cycle that path and do take of it .

Admission is free and Do aware there are opening hour for Chinese garden.
Visited on 23 Sept 2018 eve of Moon Cake festival around 1900hrs.

Abit disappointed that no Moon cake festival / Mid-Autumn Festival event for 2018 in Chinese garden. It used to have event during moon cake festival.

7 Storey Pagoda :
Last time visited Chinese garden about 7 yrs ago and I walked up this pagoda. That time no lift access it . Do note that pagoda has closing hour.

Toilet:
It is available but need to look for it

Smoking:
NO smoking is allowed inside the Chinese garden
Vending Machines:
Didn’t see any vending machine around.
Locker service:
No locker services

The live turtle & tortoise museum:
It was located at Garden courtyard but cease operation around 2018.

Around 1980 to 1990. Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC ) used this place to film their local drama . They used garden chinese scene background for their ancient drama . Area such as Garden courtyard and white rainbow bridge and stone boat.

Conclusion:
No recommended go around sunny day ."
,,A park with some interesting sights,4.0,,"This park is split into two, with a Chinese side and a Japanese side. the Japanese side closes earlier than the Chinese side (7pm), and MRT access is via the Chinese side. Overall, the Chinese side has more culturally-themed elements than the Japanese side but it's a nice park to spend some time at. Many Singaporeans walk and cycle here. They also have some resident otters that are a pleasure to watch as they swim in the little lake and channels within the park."
,,"Nature Park, Live Turtle and Tortoise Muzium, Pagoda",4.0,,"A great place you can’t miss if you come to the west of Singapore. The garden have many type of trees such as Bamboo and Pine Trees. Those who love Bonsai can visit their bonsai garden opening from 9am to 5am daily. Some even more that hundreds years. For those who love to visit live turtle and tortoise, there is a muzium which you can explore. Overall is a very tranquil park which you can find many things to do there like Cycling, picnic, jogging, walking. You never get bored to visit the park."
,,Pleasant off-the-beaten-track trip to the gardens,4.0,,"Being Malaysians, we have visited our neighbour multiple times. After checking all the ""top tourist"" spots, we chance upon this free-entrance gardens. Mind you, there's heavy construction going on in the vicinity as they're building another tourist attraction. As we tried not to visit the touristy Gardens by the Bay, this was a pleasant find."
,,Lovely morning stroll,5.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese Gardens made for a perfect combo for a morning stroll. Do watch out for the heat and the rain as you can easily spend a few hours in the park.

It's all completely free and it's easy to get to with the MRT station taking you to the entrance of the park. It's admirable that it's not overly commercialised either, with just a few stalls at the front should you need food or drink.

The bonsai garden was a highlight with the biggest collection I've seen to date - all the plants being older than me and artfully cared for over the decades.

The pagoda is worth ascending for a view over the park, and make sure to make it out to the Japanese garden as well."
,,Great for a freebie!,4.0,,"We taxied here from Changi Cove, I’m sure the taxi driver took us the longest route that he could manage, then dropped us off by the entrance where construction is taking place. However, there is a path to get through to the gardens, so no worries there. Bring yourself some food & drink as there’s nothing inside apart from a water fountain, which was much appreciated. There only appeared to be one toilet too, but then it’s better than no toilet. We spent a good few hours here wondering along the beautiful gardens at our leisure, & met quite a few locals on the way, exercising, biking, & birdwatching. I didn’t see any 3 meter water monitors though, 3 feet maybe. If you go out the other entrance there’s a small shop selling drinks & snacks, & a few shops when you get to the Chinese Gardens MTR. If you walk straight through the station you can hop on a bus, or flag a taxi down."
,,undiscovered treasures,5.0,,"these 2 gardens are located side by side. it has now been overshadowed by the new garden by the bay. if you have time, it is worth the visit. entry is free. just a MRT away. easy walking in both gardens. beautiful and very well kept."
,,Best time,5.0,,"MRT drops you right there.
The gardens are so beautiful and peaceful.
I spent the best time there and I could walk for two more hours there if I didn't have a flight to catch.
If there's a good weather, I highly recommend bring some snacks and drinks and have a picnic there."
,,Nice place to chill,5.0,,Love coming here to chill and take pretty photos (on days where it's not super hot). It is just across Chinese Garden MRT station so it is very convenient if you're taking the MRT.
,,Great park in the West!,5.0,,"If anyone comes to the Westside of Singapore, be sure to stop by Chinese and Japanese Gardens, simply elegant and beautiful."
,,Go during mornings,5.0,,"Since there are other attractions in Singapore, that are very suitable for night, it is better you go here during morning. Very nice place to visit. It involves a bit of walking though. Visit the lakeside also while you are at it."
,,Great,5.0,,lots of photo opportunities here great day out for all ages well marked easy to navigate bring water and wear sunblock
,,Chinese Japanese Garden,4.0,,"Interesting and peaceful place with some fantastic, and very old, bonsai trees. Surprised by the large monitors wandering around the place And it's free"
,,Peaceful and relaxing,5.0,,"5 minute flat walk from the MRT station, take your time and look out for the lizards and squirrels that wander across the pathways. Make sure you visit the turtle museum, really neat experience feeding long beans to turtles. Good view from the tower (lots of steps on a hot humid tho) worth the climb"
,,Chinese and Japanese Gardens Singapore,4.0,,"The gardens are beautifully maintained. During the August lantern festival, place is always display awesome lanterns and is great to go for a stroll."
,,WATCH OUT,5.0,,Enjoyed most of our time at the Chinese Gardens except when the HUGE monitor lizards ran towards me. One was 3 mtr long and huge. I was between them and the lake and they must have been spooked so were running towards me. Apparently they are common all over Singapore well maybe a sign around the gardens would be a great help. So KEEP your eyes open I got quite a fright.
,,Oasis,5.0,,"A big, beautiful park with awesome gardens all well maintained. The best is to go explore the park is to take a bike (slow speed) Nearest MRT station: (Green line) EW 25 Chinese Garden Entrance fee. FREE"
,,A lovely cultural place to visit,5.0,,I love the place that I am able to take some pictures for hours in a not crowded place. I choose this place because this is not the commercial place and it gives the history of Chinese and Japanese in visual and through building. The transportation will be very easy and you can take the MRT and get off in Chinese Garden station. 
,,Immaculate Gardens,4.0,,"The Gardens themselves are beautiful and immaculately looked after. It is a little way out of the CBD but worth the trip and easy to get to via MRT.

Our family of four went during the middle of the day and it got very very hot and made the experience a little enduring, considering there is such a large area to explore. I would make this activity an early morning or later afternoon activity."
,,A beautiful place filled with plants and wildlife,5.0,,"The garden is close to a military air base so you can see quite a lot of fighter jets and military helicopters flying overhead. There's also a tall tower and if you climb up to the top of the tower you can see a magnificent view. Overall, the area is well kept and there is also a live turtle and tortoise museum boasting the largest collection of turtles and tortoise."
,,Worth the MRT ride to beautiful natural setting,5.0,,"Our AWA expat walking group enjoyed the approximate 3-4 mile walk through both gardens today. It is an easy MRT ride on the green line. The scenery was spectacular with several restrooms and water stations throughout the gardens. Do be aware the monitor lizards inhabit the gardens and have no intention to harm you. But if you aren't familiar with them, they could frighten you on first glance. We saw one approximately five feel so quite a presence as you walk along. Both gardens are a beautiful departure from the high rise buildings of Orchard where you experience the beautiful bridges, pagodas and Bonsai gardens. Perfect for nature lovers! We will return for another walk soon."
,,Very popular,5.0,,"Whenever I visit Singapore, I always visit these lovely gardens, so well maintained and very popular, even if it’s free. A credit to the designers and grounds people."
,,Worth the trip,4.0,,"The gardens are quite far out of the central hub, but easy to reach by MRT. Get off at the Chinese Gardens MRT station and take a short walk to see some of the most beautiful ancient architecture and gardens. The bonsai garden is a must see as it showcases bonsai trees up to 150 years and older. Entrance is free."
,,"Good location, nice scenery and F.O.C.!",5.0,,A tranquil place best visiting during early morning and late evening. Good spot to jog and stroll around the parks. There are fishes and turtles in the ponds. Best is its F.O.C.!
,,Don't visit on Sunday,5.0,,"Chinese garden and Japanese garden both are in the same place. It is very hot place, drinking water and toilet available in many places. Can take some good photos. If you plan to go with family avoid Sunday, because many Romeo will be there it will make embarrass you. If you plan to visit all place then you need at least 3 to 4 hours. There is no entrance fee."
,,Awesome Garden !,5.0,,"Easy to find. Choose MRT to Jurong and stop in Chinese Garden Station. Walk 10 minutes from station. Free entry! (You can walk or rent bicycle) I recomend you to bring/buy some water. They had 2 long ways (to Japan & to China)
Need 3-5hours tour round & takes photos. Very beautiful garden (onsen inside hehe.. bridge, temple etc)

Love to comeback soon.."
,,Lovely Japanese/Chinese style gardens,4.0,,"This was a lovely place to walk or cycle around. Saw some Monitor Lizards, Otters, Turtles and birdlife. Was very relaxing and gorgeous scenery. Just a shame there is so much construction going on before you actually reach the gardens, had to park at a temporary carpark some distance away. But once in the gardens it was well worth the visit."
,,Nice Gardens,4.0,,"A train journey from central stations will take you directly to Chinese Gardens Station, very convenient. It is a walking activity so can be tiring if weather hot and humid. The gardens are extremely well maintained and very nice with the highlight being the bonsai display. Large number of plants and the age of some of them is amazing with one tree still going that was started in 1767. Mind blowing.
Worth a visit at least for the exercise."
,,Gorgeous Gardens,5.0,,"It was quite a long drive away to see these beautiful Chinese and Japanese Gardens, but once you are here you will love it. The Pagodas look amazing and the garden offers a lot of exciting photo opportunities. Do check it out if you have a few hours to spare."
,,"The best of Fujianese traditional architecture, relaxing setting.",5.0,,"This is such an easy place to visit. Just hop off the MRT at Chinese Garden & read the exit signs. Walk straight out the correct exit and you're in Chinese Garden. The 7 storey pagoda is a copy of the one in Fujian and you can walk up to the top & enjoy the view. Other notable buildings include: the double pagoda, the stone boat, several moon gates & bridges, & the floating pavilion... There are also lots of statues such as Confucius and Mulan, several different themed gardens like the zodiac animal garden with a bench and a statue dedicated to each animal in the Chinese zodiac.
Japanese Garden, built by Japanese landscape architects at the invitation of the Singaporean government to promote harmony, is very subdued and understated. It is accessed over a beautiful slightly arched bridge from Chinese Garden. The emphasis is on stone lanterns and manicured shrubs in Japanese Garden. You can budget 25% of your time for Japanese Garden. Both gardens are great for photographers and plein air painters!
There is no queue or charge to visit the gardens.
There is no 'dress code', but Singaporeans don't visit gardens dressed in rags or skimpy outfits.
There's no ID check to enter the gardens.
There's nothing to buy and no guided tour; just bring your water bottle, hat, sun block cream. I didn't experience any annoying insects. There are plenty of informative signs.
There're a couple of impeccably clean toilets."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I was blown away when we visited this place. Although it drizzled after 30 minutes we were there, good thing we brought umbrellas. Entrance is free. It is close to MRT. You can enjoy the view and also the chinese pagodas, the landscape, and also the stone statues of historical figures. The lake was beautiful. We enjoyed watching the Koi fishes and the turtles swimming around. One of the best times in Singapore."
,,Beautiful peaceful spot,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit!!
It’s a lovely spot to get away from the hustle & bustle of the city and it’s very easy to reach by MRT (Chinese Gardens stop). I spent around 2 1/2 hours there.

The gardens are beautifully maintained. Definitely visit the pagoda & climb the stairs to the top to get a great view over the gardens.

Walking by the edge of the lake I came across a Lace Monitor who casually climbed out of the lake just a meter or two in front of me. A few minutes later he was joined by his friend who strolled across the walkway from the other direction. Very cool!!

The zodiac garden is a bit of fun for families with kids, get them to find the statue of the zodiac sign for the year they are born & the corresponding attributes.

I found the Chinese Gardens much prettier than the Japanese Gardens."
,,Well worth a visit and its FREE!,4.0,,"This lovely park is a great place for a walk or just wander about. It can be entered direct from the Chinese Garden MRT station (EW25).
The paths are all paved so it is easy to walk around. There is a lot of open space with little shade - remember to wear sunscreen and a hat and take some drinking water.
Early morning is a good time to visit. You will see locals walking, riding bicycles or doing tai chi.
The best part - there is no entry fee."
,,Beautiful free gardens,4.0,,"Feel away from Singapore in this place ,beautiful gardens not too big,free entrance ,very close to Chinese gardens mrt"
,,a quiet & relaxing garden,5.0,,"probably the hidden gem of SINGAPORE as this attraction is not one of top destinations in the republic. but this visit is still worth it, the convenient spot along the East West Line (disembark at Chinese Garden MRT station), stroll along the garden as the 7 storeys pagoda will greet you as you step in & there’s even a statue of Confucius right here. there are also lots of bonsai tree varieties here & the statue of 12 animals which make up the Chinese calendar."

,,Lose yourself for hours in these wide open green spaces,4.0,,"Peaceful beautiful open parkland with interesting statues, plants and features to enjoy. It is well worth the climb up the 7-storey pagoda for the stunning views.dont miss the bonsai garden, some incredible specimens representing decades of tender care, some are well over 150 years old! Japanese Garden has a lovely lily pond. Only 10 minutes stroll from the MRT station and no charge to enjoy these lovely, well tended gardens."
,,Lovely place to walk,5.0,,"This is a bit off the normal tourist destination list, but it's worth a visit. I went towards the end of the afternoon and it was very peaceful. It's easily accessed by MRT - the station is right next door."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"These are beautiful parks where you can stroll for hours. The last time I was there, I was able to watch several monitor lizards on the grounds and in the water. I love it."
,,Serene,4.0,,The place is very peaceful and quiet. Good for walking and people who wants to spent some time alone. Japanese garden is not that maintained compared to Chinese garden. But all in all it is still a good experience
,,Beautiful well maintained theme Park depicting Chinese and Japanese garden.,4.0,,"For architecture and nature lovers this is an amazing view. Firstly it's free, you don't need to pay anything to enter and move around in this park only exception is the turtle sanctuary where you can mix along and feed the turtles. You'll need to walk a long duration inside so have the patience and the time. About its location it's located far away from CBD Singapore, you'll find residential buildings around, but you can easily get there by Metro or Grab /Taxi, should visit this place."
,,Good for Walking,4.0,,"Good for walking with friends. Make sure you bring enough water and snack so you don't starve and dehydrated. There is a pagoda, pool, and you could find some mangalizard as well."
,,Very quiet and pretty gardens,4.0,,"Took a 45 minute metro journey, very pleasant, to reach the Chinese Gardens metro stop. You can see the gardens immediately you get off the train. Free entry.

Bridges over water connect the various areas of the gardens. Pretty views as you walk around. I headed straight to the bonsai garden which had a huge selection. I loved it. I think you could typically spend 2 hours here in the park.

There is hardly any shading or tree cover so beware and use sunscreen or use an umbrella. I got a Mobike at the entrance and rode around. Free entry and lots of picturesque views."
,,Tranquil gardens,4.0,,This a free well maintained park. As the names states gardens created from the said areas We saw a monitor water lizard. Worth a trip to get away from the marina Bay Area
,,Superb free entry gardens easily reached from the MRT,5.0,,"Reached by MRT from the Chinese Garden station strait into the park. These are beautiful gardens with artefacts, statues and lakes and it's all free! There's little shade and only one place to by a drink which is at the entrance so wear sunscreen, a hat and take water."
,,I enjoyed my day in this garden,5.0,,"Hi...travelers...this is a place in Singapore where you can get a peaceful and beautiful scene of nature. I love going to this garden to enjoy a walk, a beautiful sight, and a quiet place. Indeed, the place is attractive for photography."
,,Excellent venues,5.0,,Nice place to visit and stroll looking at the peace and tranquility of the gardens. It is a place to renew. Almost like a spiritual place to gather ones thoughts. Very worth experiencing.
,,"Loved the Chinese Gardens ,,, avoid turtle attraction",4.0,,"The Chinese gardens are amazing, pagoda , Japanese gardens , Chinese zodiacs section. Impressive Bridges,
Easy to get to on MRT. Just exit on left side , then walk across the park.
Please avoid turtle museum, see separate listing on trip advisor, reviewers are appalled at the cruelty."
,,Well manicured gardens,4.0,,"The gardens are reached most easily by MRT at Chinese Garden station, followed by a short walk. As well as the plants, there is a bonsai garden with a large number of trees of different ages.

There is also a 7 storey pagoda to climb and various other buildings to investigate. There are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains.

The Japanes Garden is reached by crossing a bridge over the lake, but has shorter opening hours than the Chinese Garden."
,,Calming but a bit boring,3.0,,It’s a nice place to visit if you like nature and quiet. You can ride a bike around the area or just walk. The pagodas make for some nice pictures. But it can get boring fast. We saw the sign for the “Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum” and was excited. But we didn’t see any actual museums. The turtles are all in the pond. I guess that’s the “live” part?
,,Best things in life are free,5.0,,"Singapore has many green open spaces and this park is one of the best. Its about half an hour from the city and well worth the journey. There are so many different aspects to enjoy. It was lovely to see the locals gathering together to play full size cricket matches, families and lots of groups of young lads having picnics. The pagodas are the focal points, but some of the individual gardens are both beautiful and peaceful. Its a great place to people watch and just relax away from the busy city centre."
,,Unplanned visit,5.0,,"Our taxi driver dropped us off here instead of the botanic gardens but this turned out to be a little gem. Very calm atmosphere with beautiful pagodas, lakes, and a lovely bonsai garden with some very ancient trees."
,,A discovery. Don't miss!,5.0,,"These gardens are a wonderful tourist attraction, and still you can see that they are enjoyed by the ordinary people from the neighborhood. They are cozy and fascinating in their architecture."
,,Love these gardens.,5.0,,"I live near the gardens and I love coming back here, taking a walk or cycling every week. Views are fantastic, it gets crowded but never noisy. People take a walk, run or cycle everywhere in the park. You can spot birds, butterflies and monkeys. Last time we spotted a reptile as big as a young crocodile and it was exciting too! If you live in Singapore, you can come and spend an afternoon here. If you are a tourist and want to get a quiet break from the city life, this is also what you're looking for. Get off the mrt at Chinese garden station and you're there."
,,Tranquil gardens,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens just a short hop on the MRT to another world. We saw otters in the river, turtles, and a number of water monitors roaming about. A must see garden."
,,Lovely and tranquil,5.0,,"Lovely find, so tranquil. Really enjoyed it here. It’s a little MRT ride out but easy enough to get to and a short walk from the tram stop. The gardens are so well maintained"
,,Best place for some landscape photography,4.0,,Take the MRT to Jurong and you reach a place hidden in Singapore. Chinese and Japanese garden is often visited by photographers for some nice photoshoots. As a landscape photographer your best best could be the tween pagodas. Definitely good place. The entry is free.
,,"Beautiful park, and it's free",5.0,,"I went to this park at May last year. I went there with my mom and my sister. As a backpacker, of course we looked for cheap or free tourism place, so this garden become one of our list.
We went there by mrt, then walk slowly around 15 minutes to reach the garden. The garden is in front of mrt station, so really easy to find. The gardens is very large, so please prepare your own mineral water, wear hat/umbrella if needed, wear comfortable shoes, bring snack if you want and of course please wear sun block.
There are 2 gardens, chinese and japanese. But Japanese garden was at renovation so i just take picture in front of it. Both of them are sooo beautiful.
It was not popular among traveler that time, so usually only resident near here who visit. When we visit it, it kinda private garden coz only few who came here. My mom was so happy and very enjoy this garden."
,,A Fantastic Garden not to be missed.,5.0,,"Chinese Garden – Singapore.
The easiest way to the Chinese Garden in Singapore is by MRT that has a station just outside the garden. The station is rightly named Chinese Garden Station. The MRT (mass rapid transit) station entrance or the East Gate where the Red Bridge leads to the garden. The main gate or West Gate at Yuan Ching Road with the Main Arch Building is at the opposite end. The White Rainbow Bridge will take you across to two courtyards, namely the “Early Spring Courtyard” and “Garden Courtyard” and a fishpond in the center which is named the “Fishes Paradise”. The White Rainbow Bridge, a unique 13-arch bridge that was modelled after the famous 17-arch bridge at the Summer Palace in Beijing, China,

Chinese Garden is a large park with an area of 135,000 square meters in Jurong East, built in 1975 and designed by Professor Yuen-chen Yu from Taiwan and modeled on Chinese gardening art of imperial architecture and landscaping. It is opened daily from 6am to 11pm and entrance is free.
From the Garden there is a connecting bridge that leads to the adjacent Japanese Garden. A visit the both the gardens would be a good ideal for the attraction of two contrasting garden concepts. It would however take a strenuous effort of up to two hours of footwork. Many kiosks or huts dotted the both gardens to entertain the weary feet of visitors and to shelter from the hot sun and the unsuspecting rain.
Upon entrance via the MRT entrance a Red Bridge will lead the visitor to a seven floor pagoda that provides a useful lookout point. Four stone lions are stationed at the head of the Red Bridge to welcome the visitors. We found the climb up the pagoda quite fascinating as we navigate and stop at each floor to enjoy the views. The pagoda is actually two stories high per floor which makes the actual height fourteen stories. You can see the entire garden plus a good portion of the Japanese Garden from the top. At the base of the pagoda are statues of eight of the famous heroes of ancient China, seven male and one female, that was the famous lady general Hua Mulan.
You should engage a map or consult the directory posted at both entrance to navigate to all the rich features that the garden has to offer. Apart from the impressive East Entrance and the Main Arch Building, the Pagoda with the features of Heroes of folklore China at the base, the Stone Lion, the lovely White Rainbow Bridge, the Stone Boat and Tea House, the Garden of Abundance, the Bonsai Garden, and Pavilion, Plateau and Tower are the features not to be missed. There is also Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum which a small entrance fee is charged."
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,"So beautiful and tranquil. It's like an oasis of peace in the hustle and bustle of Singapore. We were quite impressed by how well-kept the gardens were, and that is is free entry for everyone."
,,Tranquility,5.0,,A hidden gem in West Coast. Peace and tranquility. It takes around 1 hr to walk both gardens. So beautiful. No cafes as such so be prepared and bring some snacks and water with you
,,Great Park,4.0,,"Very peaceful and beautiful, a bit of an MRT ride out of Singapore, but well worth it, while here visit the Tortoise and Turtle living museum, and give them a feed, a great half day out and full of fum for the whole family."
,,Scenic place,4.0,,This is one place where you can appreciate nature and see all the beautiful trees and greenery all around
,,Turtles,5.0,,Went here because of Turtles museum which my son just loves . Entrance is only 5 S$ . The park itself is nice with small Bonsai trees . Best part is that its not crowded as located bit far from centre
,,Free and interesting place,5.0,,"It was one of the places of attractions in Singapore that draw huge crowds during CNY and Mooncake Festivals. Now it's more of a place for walks and viewing of turtles, monitor lizards and spaces for kids to run.

Good place to spend the evening with self prepared food and drinks."
,,No crowds on a rainy day,4.0,,A great place to visit on a damp day. Pleasant walking and few other people around meant I really enjoyed the peaceful area. Lovely view from the top of the pagoda. Enjoyed the bonsai collection and the lovely buildings in the Chinese Garden. Japanese Garden not as impressive but quite nice. I spent longer than anticipated there as I enjoyed just wandering.
,,Peaceful and Serene,5.0,,"Gorgeous, peaceful, serene. Very picturesque, ideal for a lazy picnic, reading a book under a tree by the river, painting and sketching."
,,Lovely place,5.0,,There is such beautifull pagoda with awesome scenery.. walk about 10 minutes from mrt to get the beautifull pagoda and have many statue's to look around.
,,Amazing place out of Singapore in Singapore,5.0,,"Walking in the gardens give you the feeling you are not in Singapore. The Chinese and the Japanese monuments, flowers and gardens are authentic and while walking around you don't feel like walking in a regular Singaporean gardens. Very nice"
,,Just quiet and relaxing in beautiful gardens,5.0,,"The gardens are easy to get to on the MRT just get off at the Chinese garden stop. It is a short walk into the gardens which are free to get in We also go on a clear sunny day in the afternoon, when the light is fantastic for photographs. The whole area is beautiful and well maintained. Lots to look at and well set out. You can go up the pagoda but just stairs. The bonsai garden is interesting and we actually saw a gardener maintaining one bush, It was a delicate performance.There are lots of seats around to absorb the calming atmosphere. It would be a good place to take a picnic. There are no refreshment kiosksin the gardens only a small one at the entrance, so take plenty of water with you,"
,,A walk in the Park.,5.0,,"Really enjoy wandering around this big space. Great buildings ,statues,waterways and wildlife abound. The view from the central Pagoda is stunning. It can be hot so come prepared for this. Excellent for picnics. Recommend."
,,Very Nice Garden,5.0,,"My wife is from Singapore, so she was familiar with the gardens, but it had been many years since she had gone. We had done most of the other parks and open spaces, so we were looking for a new place (at least for me, to walk. I suggested this place and she readily agreed.

We were staying in Central Singapore, near Clarke Quay. Travel to the gardens was quite easy. We took a bus to an MRT station and then the East/West (Green) line to Chinese Garden Station. The Garden is a short walk from the station.

The gardens themselves are beautiful and my wife was amazed at how the area had changed since she was last here. We went to the top of the pagoda (7 stories, only stairs) and got a birds eye view of the gardens. Then we looked around the bonsai garden and went over the bridge into the Japanese Garden. Both were immaculately maintained and very relaxing.

A word to the wise, however. This is probably best experienced in the morning and with adequate hydration. It gets quite warm and the facility is much larger than one would imagine.

But it was a definite go for us."
,,Great outdoor beyond the shopping spree,4.0,,Nice garden though accessibility is a little challenging for those who’s not driving. Nevertheless great outdoor space for visitors wanting to have a different experience beyond shopping.
,,Relaxing park,5.0,,"This park is not as crowded as the gardens by the bay for example. It's still a nice park to relax and have a walk after a working day.
The japanese garden close at 7pm, and the bonsai garden close at 5pm. If you're not in a hurry, you should go there."
,,If you want peace and tranquillity this is fab! Or family gathering perfect,5.0,,"This place only fund via research. We had spend the day at the bird park and it was late afternoon before we made it here. We walked around part of the Japanese Gardens and I automatically fell in love. Our experiences in Singapore were all rushed and jammed packed to cram it all in, but when I was here, I automatically felt Zen. I really wished I had more time here and it had s much to offer. Word of advise for those wishing to use the toilets, take toilet paper and be warned, the ones I used, the door was so close to you, that my knees hit the door.. Please note I am a short person. If I am in Singapore ever again. I will make this a must and be spending a lot more time here. Walking distance from train station too. BTW, its FREE!!"
,,A lot of walking,4.0,,"Started the day with a trip on the MRT (train) and cab to Chinese Gardens. The gardens are interesting but very large. The Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum was a disgrace.
$5:00 entry to see animals in tanks with no water, huddled at rear of fibreglass boxes trying to get out of the sun and heat. Recommend you do not take children to see this, focus on rest of gardens.
Japanese Gardens, wow those Bonsai are so old and grand. Only complaint, need signs pointing to exit of grounds."
,,A lovely place to visit,5.0,,"Catch the East West (green) line to Jurong East. On one side of the station is the garden, on the other side are two(!) shopping malls. These gardens were lovely, though we spent most of our time in the beautiful Japanese garden so didn't get to explore much of the Chinese garden. We saw little lizards, monitor lizards, turtles, and hermit crabs. I climbed the tower – it was hot but worth it for the view from the top, and the photo looking down the spiral staircase. There's a nice breeze at every level's balcony. (Once you have finished in the gardens, or before you go there, head to the first mall and up to the food court on Level 5. There is a tiny Thai place that do the yummiest Pad Thai I have ever eaten.)"
,,Very Peaceful,3.0,,"Just opposite the MRT station, the first thing you notice is the beautiful padoga. A lovely place to sit and relax, walk around the lake and admire the warrior statues. Ther are no refeshments available apart from a vending machine, so take plenty of water or buy nearby. Best of all it's free"
,,Scenic,4.0,,You can get off the Chinese Garden MRT station and its right there. its big and peaceful and pretty. Well worth a visit
,,Very nice,4.0,,"We have been to Singapore many times but not been to these gardens before.
Today we caught the MRT on our line to the gardens
Get off at the train stop "" Chinese Gardens""
I love the culture , the buildings history etc and this was a bit of a fix for me
There were some nice pergoda's lakes statues gardens and Lakes
We wondered around for about 2 hours but you could spend much more there.
There is a cafe and a couple of places to get a cool drink
We really liked it enjoyed the gardens and the buildings"
,,Peaceful,4.0,,We read about these gardens in a travel article before coming to Singapore and decided to take the MRT for a visit. They are right by the Chinese Garden MRT station and are well worth a visit. They are situated on a lake and if you are lucky you can see turtles and tortoises. The pagoda is beautiful and the warrior statues interesting. The stand out for us was the Bonsai Garden. Be aware there are no refreshments in the gardens so take water. The gardens are free.
,,Beautiful Escape,4.0,,"I love this garden. I first spotted it as a bit of a surprise travelling on the green line to Raffles Marina. The beautiful traditional tower rising up behind the green rolling hills and trees. When I got to visit I found a beautiful, sprawling ornamental garden which was so peaceful and beautiful. The gate by the tower has some vending refreshments on a hot day and there are plenty of city bikes if you prefer to ride. It is such a lovely place to relax and quite the mind. Each area is a bit different and the statues are enchanting. I went on a mixed day where there weather started out nice and then there was a monsoon. In the flooded river I even saw a croc!!!!!"
,,A wonderful experience.,5.0,,"Well another day in Singapore and we have just arrived back to our hotel after another day walking around and seeing such a wonderful sight in the Chinese and Japanese gardens, such a beautiful area to sit and relax and let all your worries pass you by. This is another must do while you are staying in Singapore. Just get the green line MRT to the Chinese Gardens, it’s right at the station with a short walk to the front gate. No payments to enter, and do it at your own speed. DON’T get a tour, you don’t need to. Wonderful day. 10/10."
,,Free Entrance and So Peaceful,5.0,,"I came here just because i was looking something new in singapore (this is my 5th time in sg). Went by mrt, chinese garden mrt station. When we got out of the station it was all greenyard so peaceful except theres cricket game but overall it was nice, when we arrived at the front of the gate, we could see the pagoda, and i was like “this is no singapore at all” i felt like i was in some other east country. Strolling around and took some pictures and it was relaxing."
,,This is not in Singapore ...,1.0,,This place over run by too many foreigners at the expense of local tax payers ... Use to be peaceful but not anymore ...
,,Nice place to visit,5.0,,"Very Nice place to visit in jurong! If you are in jurong, go to the Chinese and Japanese Gardens!! A must see"
,,Public gardens by train stations,4.0,,"My experience to both gardens was an enjoyable one. There are many spots to see such as ponds, bridges, pagodas, and everything garden-related. Its location by the train station makes it easily reached from anywhere in Singapore. My suggestion is to better go there with your loved ones to enjoy the calmness. However, going there on your own is a good option too for serenity."
,,Attractive park in the far west,4.0,,"We came out here again today with the primary intent of visiting the turtles and tortoises, but the park is hard to avoid when here. Unfortunately there seems to be some pretty major construction kicked off in the immediate vicinity of the gardens which detracts a little from the overall experience. But the gardens remain very attractive and not too crowded, even on a Sunday."
,,Nice Slow Experience,4.0,,"Visited on a nice Saturday afternoon for a picnic and walk. Had a really great time overall just walking around and admiring the quietness. There's a lot of wild monitor lizards, turtles, and birds, but sadly no feeding of animals is allowed. There's plenty of places to just sit down and have heart-to-heart talks. Also, the turtle museum is a must-see!
Unfortunately, the Japanese garden side is rather empty and boring compared to the Chinese counterpart."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours wandering around. Very impressed with the Bonsai Garden. A little oasis of tranquillity away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore.
,,Enjoy,4.0,,"With some friends during day off we decide to go visit Japanese garden,he was a really good day,we walk,we see something interesting and during the week was quite empty,if have half day to spend can enjoy for sure"
,,Very plain and average looking gardens,3.0,,"Went to the Chinese Gardens on a Friday afternoon and the place was flooded and overcrowded with people (probably a few hundred), and don't expect to see any beautiful scenery/gardens. It's certainly not a place where you can relax, take nice photos or have a pleasant stroll, worse still the gardens were fairly ordinary, unimpressive and not well maintained, with nothing much to write home about. Quite a disappointment really."
,,Relaxed stroll in Chinese & Japanese Garden,5.0,,"One of the most characterful parks in Singapore during the earlier days. It's now a dim compare to the glamour of gardens by the bay & our Unesco Botanical Garden. The most noteworthy landmarks in the garden are its pagodas. There are three, a pair of twin pagodas which is three storeys high and the cloud pagoda, 7 storeys high up a spiraling climb, one will be rewarded with beautiful view of the garden n lake below.

Japanese Garden, with their Tori gates, crane & beautiful surrounding."
,,Peace and quite Gardens,5.0,,I really like this place and been there many many times. not a lot of people and enjoy walking around both Chinese garden and Japanese garden. You can cycle a bicycle around outside of the garden it's really nice but be aware there are also lot of people jogging around. take care each other.
,,An oasis of calm,5.0,,"This is a bit of a way out, but if you have an MRT pass, is very simple to get to from the Chinese Garden stop. It was a beautiful place but a real sun trap and extremely hot. Very tranquil and calm though and you need good shoes!. It surprised me that not more people were there as it takes a few hours to see everything. You do need to take drinks and snacks though."
,,One memorable visit,5.0,,"I love going to such places -- gardens! Who wouldn't? But in this particular garden, they show not only pagodas and beautiful plants, but also statues of famous Chinese generals, including Mulan! And also saw a statue of Confucious. But Mulan's statue was striking, as most war heroes are men so, it was very unique for this garden to have a woman included. That is good! Then the rains came that day, which made the earthworms come out of the ground and into the paved path. I was shrieking and so terrified of the earthworms that I cannot forget this day, ever!"
,,Sooo beautiful and peacefull,5.0,,"I wouldnt visit this but thank god i visited it. It is at the mrt station ""chinese gardens"". It takes half an hour to arrive there from city centre .after you going out the train station you will see it. It is Sooo beautiful and peacefull place. There is a beautifull pagoda and chinese and japanese traditional buildings.there is a lake full of turtles that kids will love. There is alive turtle museum here that cost 5 s$.there is also a free entrance bonzai museum(little japanese trees). If you have the time visit it. We was there about 1,5-2 hours."
,,a must see if you are in Singapore !,5.0,,This was fantastic really enjoy it . The hop on hop of bus take y ou out there the yellow bus instated of wasteing a day on public transport like we did. lol 😂
,,Amazing place,5.0,,I came here at 11 o'clock....so...it's very hot I recommend if you want to visit...early in the morning or at 4 or 5 o'clock The place is really good...my family really enjoy this place Very beautiful And free of charge
,,Always good to have a visit here,4.0,,"This place is free within MRT stop.
So we always have a visit whenever we're in Singapore. It has nice Pagoda to take picture with, nice Chinese structure like bridge and house. Turtle museum is also nice to see.

One thing for our group is the long pathway to walk from MRT stop (Chinese Garden - EW line/green line). We travel with my in-laws (2 elder) and have to slowly walk to the entrance."
,,Relaxing n taking a stroll....Chinese Garden,4.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese Gardens, which are being developed into Jurong Lake Gardens, are islands that sit in Jurong Lake. The gardens are connected to each other by the Bridge of Double Beauty. Both the gardens are popular with photographers and lately, cosplayers, who want to feature the unique architecture found within the gardens as part of their photoshoots.

The Chinese Garden has a good bonsai collection, and various pavilions and pagodas in the northern Chinese imperial style. Some of the Icons of the Chinese Garden include the seven storey Cloud Piercing Pagoda and the statues of famous heroes in Chinese history. Don’t miss the unusual Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum ($5/entry), containing about 180 turtles and more than 3,000 turtle-related items collected by the museum’s owner and his daughter.

The adjoining Japanese Garden is modelled on Japanese gardening aesthetics of the Muromachi and Momoyama period and features arched bridges, stone paths, rock waterfalls, stone lanterns and Japanese-styled pagodas.

The best times to visit the gardens are during Chinese New Year (usually January or February) and the Mid-Autumn Festival (September or October), when cultural performances are held and the gardens are lit up at night like a fairyland by hundreds of beautiful and ornate paper lanterns. Otherwise, pop by for a quiet stroll or jog, a spot of photography or just to enjoy the scenery."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,Nice place to visit especially with children and aged parents too Send time with snacks and other any eatables here Nice to play with children
,,Great Pagoda,4.0,,"It is so easy to access this garden. You just need to take MRT and stop in Chinese Garden (green line). then walk around 7mins from the MRT to the garden. Free enterance.
I arrived at around 5 p.m. It was so quiet there. Some people did jogging and exercise. First I decided to visit Japanese garden but it was far to the left side of the garden. Then my mom and I decided to explore the Pagoda instead. We were tired.
Inside the Pagoda there was 7 lvl to be reached. When u reached the top, u could see the view of the garden. Beautiful & quiet for the great evening."
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Of all the places we visited in the week we spent in Singapore, this was our favourite. A little out of the way, but easy on the MRT, free to visit with one guy at the gate selling drinks. Beautiful gardens, Chinese, Japanese and a Zodiac garden with stone statues of all the animals, beautifully done with a sense of humour. Pagodas you can wander up, amazing waterways, monitor lizards and turtles to be seen. A bonsai garden bursting with trees, some 200 years old and hardly a soul about. The perfect antidote to the hustle and bustle of the city."
,,A nice green space to relax in,4.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese Gardens are easily reached from central Singapore using the MRT train, then a short signposted walk. There are ponds with varied wildlife as well as exotic garden areas and colourful pavilions with covered seating areas to shelter from the sun or from passing showers. It seems safe to visit during daytime hours.."
,,Great Place; Not Advised to Travel Alone,4.0,,"Did not have a comfortable experience while visiting the Chinese Gardens. I reached the Gardens travelling alone via metro from downtown, at a relatively quiet afternoon hour. I was minding my own business taking in the sights, but met with a staff member in an orange jumpsuit who proceeded to communicate with me in a language I didn't understand. I explained to him I couldn't understand him. He then pointed to my camera and asked ""Picture?"", and I politely declined. He then continued to speak in his language, and by this time I was getting very uncomfortable. I started to walk away and he continued to follow me for 4 to 5 minutes, speaking to me in his language. I repeated to him in English, ""I want to be left alone"" and ""Okay, Goodbye now"", but was ignored. I spotted a passing group of girls and asked them to accompany me, this was the only way this person left me alone. I went to the next staff member I saw and asked them where their office was so I could lodge a complaint, and he said there is no office here. I walked the grounds and met with a kind elderly gentlemen who I explained the situation to, who graciously escorted me on the rest of my visit. I obviously did not expect this type of harassment from the staff."
,,Nice place to relax,4.0,,"The Chinese Garden is a 13.5-hectare garden that is divided into two sections, the Chinese Garden and the Japanese Garden. There are pathways meandering throughout the park with plenty of shade and places to sit.

There is something to see at every turn, be it foliage, statuary, bridge, or some other structure. It is quite easy to spend a couple of hours in the gardens and the best thing of all is that it is free! There is one place in the garden that has a $5.00 admission and that would be the Live Turtle And Tortoise Museum. It's worth a look, there is a pond inside filled with turtles, they actually follow you around looking for food, luckily there is a food box located at the center of the bridge, each packet costs just $1.00.

Even if you don't want to see the turtles go over there anyway, at the entrance there is a nice koi pond to take a look at and it's good for a photo opp.

The gardens are easy to find, just take the East West MRT to the Chinese Garden Station (EW25), exit and walk 300 meters to the entrance."
,,Brave the heat and take the train,4.0,,"We did this on a particularly hot day, however it was well worth the effort the gardens are free to enter a beautiful environment to walk around there are plenty of public toilets and water fountains but nowhere really to buy refreshments so make sure you take them with you if needed. Grab a train on the East West line, or if you like simplicity like me the green line it will take you to the Chinese garden railway station about a 20 minute ride from Dhoby Ghaut interchange then a short walk of five minutes and you are there. View from the top of the Chinese pagoda if you are game to attempt it is really worth the effort."
,,Interesting and relaxing walk,4.0,,I caught the MRT and walked from the station. Its a bit of a walk down a long path sloping away so if your unsteady on your feet it could be testing. Once you cross the bridge and enter into the garden area its so peaceful and full of lovely statues and trees. There were light showers the day I went but this didn't spoil the time I spent there taking photos.The rain made for nice photos with it hitting the still waters in the lake area. The mix of Chinese and Japanese works well. Definitely worth a look but try to pick a dry day when I'm sure it would look even better. I will certainly return for a longer look next time I'm in Singapore and will pick a dry day.
,,A very spacious & clean park,4.0,,"A fantastic place to walk, run, relax or meditate. Trees and plants are well maintained.. The entrance is free.. Easy access, just get on the MRT Green line towards Jurong East and set down a Chinese Garden. There are various paths where to run, a full loop is around 4.5 Km."
,,A Hidden Gem,4.0,,"I had seen pictures of this, but did not know where it was, until now. Although the gardens are a fair way west out of town, use the MRT takes about 30-40mins but well worth it.Entry is free"
,,Peaceful nature,4.0,,Escaping from the 'city' we had a lovely time strolling through the gardens. Very peaceful and a good place to disconnect.
,,Beautiful gardens and Temple,4.0,,I loved the views and scenery. Feels like you're in an old Chinese country not Singapore which is modern. Be ready for a lot of walking and bring some water. A good place for a picnic if you dont get overwhelmed by a lot of Indians. It was Chinese New Year when we visited thats why they are all there.
,,Hidden in plain view. A must see place.,5.0,,"For an afternoon's walk, you can't do better than these gardens. Ponds and pagodas. Bonzai displays and lounging lizards. This place has it all. Bring your camera and give yourself a couple of hours (or more) and be transported out the vibe and chaotic energy of the city, into an oasis of tranquility that lies hidden in plain view."
,,"Most underrated, free attraction in the city",5.0,,The tower is visible from the Chinese garden stop off the MRT. Very relaxing; has a combination of the old China with the more modern times. A must see!
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Bigger than anticipated, beautiful, peaceful , really easy to get to via mrt. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Very nice Bonsai garden within,5.0,,"This one is a must. A little outside of town, about 20 minutes from City Hall on the EW Line (Green) direction Joo Koon. Jurong Gardens (Chinese and Japanese Garden) features Pagodas, Pavilions and Sculptures alongside all the trees and plants.
This place is very nice as it is not overrun by tourists, being ""so far"" out of town.
It also has a turtle museum.
I personally enjoyed the Bonsai Garden the most."
,,Free to Public and nice sunset,5.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese gardens are just next to each other or across the bridge to be precise. It is free to public and i did see someone with a dog so i guessed dogs are allowed. Anyway, didn't seem to see any no pets allowed sign.

The gardens are just a few mins away from the Chinese Garden MRT station (along the green line). Once you exit the station, u will see a path right outside the station with trees lining both sides of the path. The gardens are opened daily from 5.30am to 11pm.

I arrived at around 5pm and visited the Japanese garden 1st as Chinese garden (at the Twin Pagoda) is the place to catch sunset. There is a huge lotus pond at the Japanese garden. The tortoise museum is located in the Chinese garden further down from the Twin Pagoda.

These garden are good for jogging, dating or having a picnic. If the day is not too hot, perhaps should visit from 3pm or 4pm to allow more time to visit both gardens before catching the sunset at the Twin Pagoda."
,,Beautifull Garden,5.0,,There are 2 gardens in this place. The Chinese and the Japanese one. Both garden are intersted. On Chinese Garden you can see twin pagoda and statue of Chinese Hero. On Japanese you can see a red beautifull bridge.
,,Very Nice,5.0,,Aside that the Chinese and Japanese garden is open for public (Its free). Its awesome you can see old tress in different shape. The park is very clean and serene. A must visit. Good for picnic. Very breath taking.
,,Calm to escape the city,5.0,,"Found this place by total chance and was so glad that I did! My boyfriend and I wanted to explore the local area where we were staying and spotted this on the map. Unfortunately the whole park area isn't open as it's under construction but you can still enjoy the Chinese and Japanese gardens!

The care and up keep of the gardens is really lovely and there is some amazing wildlife in there to see too. We saw a 2 monitor lizards; a baby and a huge one, plenty of tortoises in the water and storks! Can spend hours in here walking around as there is plenty to see & best of all is free! Highly recommended."
,,Unexpected gem ...,5.0,,"After seeing all of the 'normal' highlights in Singapore, I handed the responsibility of picking the days adventure to mum .. she scoured the map and picked this amazing place. Well done mum!!

The gardens are beautiful, the walks easy and OMG .. the bonsai (or should I say Ponsai - did you know that Bonsai's started in China and were actually called Ponsai!!) garden was amazing as were the giant Koi and turtles.

A lovely few hours spent strolling through the gardens ... truly a hidden gem."
,,Peaceful gardens,4.0,,The gardens are a delight to walk through. Not busy although a café or something would have been welcome.
,,Serene gardens with beautiful views,5.0,,Chinese and Japanese gardens are located near the Jurong lake are the best calming spot in Singapore. The pagodas offer beautiful views of the lake area. They have turtle museum also. A must visit in Singapore.
,,Off the beaten track,4.0,,Go here for some peace and to see what locals do. The Japanese gardens are especially excellent in this aspect
,,Soothing,5.0,,We visited early morning when the weather was nice and cool. The garden is very pretty and I learnt a lot about Japanese gardens.
,,"Come for a morning stroll, its beautiful",4.0,,"Located just steps from the Chinese garden MRT station, the gardens are the site for numerous events across the calendar year. However, even on a daily basis it is wonderful to visit.

Comprising of the Chinese and Japanese gardens, one will see varied landscaping. Have a look at the Bonsai garden, it opens from 9am. And climb up the 7-storey pagoda to have a panoramic view of the surroundings. No costs whatsoever in the gardens.

You might also note that a lot of storks (literature refer them as Milky stork) make their home in the gardens and you may spot them fishing by the waters too. So bring optical zoom cameras if you want to take good photos of them.

Best to come early in the morning when it is cool. But any other time is fine really."
,,Vaste and green with some interesting structures,4.0,,"These gardens are one (or two?) of Singapore's many great parks. There's not a whole lotta shade, so don't go there on the hottest time of the day. Also not during rain, since there is not much shelter. But other than that: enormous and tranquil green area."
,,Well worth a trip,5.0,,"We visited on a Monday, There were very few visitors no screaming kids etc. So unlike the Botanical gardens which are crowded this place was a pleasant respite from the hustle and bustle that is Singapore. The MRT stops so easily found. It is beautifully maintained and we preferred the Chinese gardens to the Japanese. You can climb the pagodas for far reaching views and there are loads of places to shelter should the heavens open.
The only downside was the lack of anywhere to get a snack and a drink so take your own as you can spend hours here."
,,A local hang out,4.0,,"I wish I could review the Chinese and Japanese gardens separately because I found I liked the Japanese garden better. It was so well manicured, and less people compared to the Chinese garden. It had the biggest water lilys I've ever seen.
The Chinese garden is nice as well, and my favorite part was the bonsai trees section.
There are less tourists in these gardens, it was more a local hang out where they would go for a Sunday picnic.
There are monitor lizards hanging around in the ponds that you can spot every now and then.
I made my way to the turtle museum and was quite disappointed. The majority of them are in plain aquariums or weird cement baths. I didn't think they were in a good environment."
,,More like a nice suburban park,3.0,,"Easy to visit due to the train station but the wide open spaces, typical Singapore trees, screaming schoolkids and lawn mowers make it more like an attractive park for suburbanites. Climb the 7-storey pagoda and you can see how it's a green island amid residential sprawl. However, the bonsai and rock garden is beautiful and quieter. The Japanese garden is hard to tell apart except for the torii."
,,Pleasant Surprise,5.0,,"After visiting some of Singapore's more popular locations, the Singapore Zoo and Universal Studios, my girlfriend and I wanted a break from it all, so we visited the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The two gardens did not disappoint. The area was absolutely gorgeous. The architecture was stunning and did a great job balancing with nature. It truly felt tranquil, specifically with the Malay Water Monitors moving throughout the area. If you're in Singapore and want to visit a less touristy area for a moment of peace and quiet, I highly suggest visiting the Chinese and Japanese Gardens."
,,Hidden gem,5.0,,"It's a hidden gem located at Jurong East. There are nice architectures and structures. It's really quiet and if you love walking, you can enter Chinese Garden and walk all the way to Japanese garden and back. It's just located outside the Chinese Garden MRT station and it's free!"
,,Nice tranquil garden,4.0,,"The garden was located just outside the Chinese Garden MRT station. At first, I was unsure about the place since it was not crowded at all (there were only some locals exercising there, maybe because it was weekday). To my surprise, the Chinese Garden is actually a very nice place. The seven-storey pagoda, Chinese heroes statues, twin pagodas by the water, tea house, bonsai garden, bridge were all very photogenic. The fact that this place had only few visitors made it even better. Unfortunately, I didn't get the time to explore the Japanese Garden because I had to go to another place. If you're planning to visit, don't forget to bring umbrella (as the weather may get very hot and humid during the day) and water bottle (there were lot of drinking water fountains) to keep you hydrated."
,,A touch of China,4.0,,"We were looking for a break from the excellent, but very crowded, better known attractions of Singapore so headed for Chinese Garden on the MRT (EW line) where there is an exit leading through a park right to the eastern entrance to the Jurong Lake Gardens, incorporating Chinese and Japanese Gardens.
The 13.5 hectare park was built in 1975 and the Chinese Garden features bridges, pagodas, statues of Chinese heroes, lakes and ponds, a stone boat and tea house, the live Turtle and Tortoise Museum (admission charge) and a stunningly beautiful Bonsai Garden with over 2 000 examples of the art from all over Asia. Follow the winding paths around and over the lake and stop to enjoy the serenity at one of the many shaded resting areas.
We visited on a Tuesday when it was very quiet but, unfortunately, didn't get as far as the Japanese Garden as it started to rain. This is something to look forward to on our next visit.
Let us hope that the inevitable march of progress and urban redevelopment doesn't gobble up this treasure.
Go early, and avoid weekends. Free entry"
,,Refreshing and antic Gardens,5.0,,"I have been staying around this place for more then 10 years,, as walking distance from my place.

Morning jogging to the park, very refreshing and you saw many people exercise there, some working out with tai chi, some groups exercise.

You can also climb up the tower about 7 story high to have a good view of the HDB and lake around the gardens.

The surrounding jurong lake having renovation and would be ready in 2 years time to look more beautiful and fun for the resident and Singaporean to come here, of course by then will also attract tourist around the world.

We looking forward for the day to come."
,,amazingly beautiful and quiet,5.0,,We took our small kids there and had a lovely afternoon. The garden is incredibly beautiful and much nicer than a lot of other more advertised places in Singapore. The outdoor Turtle Museum was heaps of fun for the kids. They could feed the turtles and even saw a monitor lizzard. A must see in Singapore as it also reflects on Singapore's Chinese heritage that you can lose sight of with all the modern attractions.
,,Cute park,3.0,,"Not a must see, but if you have the time, it is worth the visit. Nice park with a great bonsai exhibit. Stop by the turtle museum - so many turtles!"
,,Really calm!,4.0,,"Enjoy a visit to a place like no other, This big place is very beautiful to walk and see. The gardens, the small buildings like temples and statues, lakes and birds flying around make it a very nice place to stay and walk for a while."
,,stunning,5.0,,"This a beautiful place the Chinese gardens are quite stunning with lots of lovely red bridges and a large lake in the denture with beautiful traditional teahouses around the edge. Fabulous pagodas to visit and climb.
Our very favourite place was the Japanese gardens, a much more compact area but really stunning. With lits of unique white buildings and intricate roof details. Takes your breathe away, just one building after another round every corner. Particularly liked the bonsai trees and and the fish pond with hundreds of koi fish.
We travelled to the gardens from the city centre by MRT which took about 40 mins. There is a stop right outside the gardens.
A must see attraction with lots of locals"
,,"Little ""China"" in Singapore",4.0,,"This is 1 heritage Chinese pavillon tower in the gardens that Singaporeans want to keep when plans are announced to develop the whole garden.
Construction is now ongoing, so enter by the main gate of the Chinese gardens. Fortunately, parking is now free, so enjoy while it's in the midst of development.
A nice quiet park, a good view over the west area if you climb the pavillon, bonsai garden, and of course beautiful at night as well."
,,Super Garden areas!,5.0,,"We took the NS from Novena NS20 on the MRT to station NS1, then the EW line one stop to the Chinese Garden entrance. Grand open spaces with traditional Chinese buildings, lakes, bridges and Pagodas fill your view. We very much enjoyed the statues of extraordinary Chinese of long past. One young people will relate to (think Disney) was Mulan, disguised as a man, and serving her country admirably as a soldier. Everyone knows Confucius but the rest were new to us and we learned more about them. One of our favorite portions of the Chinese Garden was the Bonsai gardens. This took most of our time before the rains came. We did not get to the Japanese Garden portion this day, but another day we will see it all. Peaceful and serene in its entirety."
,,So Peaceful,4.0,,"We took the MRT to the gardens, and found such a tranquil place. A walk around these gardens and you cannot fail to unwind. Make sure you take you time to fully take it all in."
,,Stroll through a Chinese and Japanese Garden,4.0,,"A very large garden with various focal points, Zodiac, Trees, Bonsai, Pagodas, Bridges. If you look carefully near water you may be lucky enough to see crocadile size water monitors."
,,Beautiful uncrowded gardens,5.0,,These gardens are west of the downtown area on the East-West MRT line. I visited on a weekday and there were only a few visitors. They are free and have wide paved paths. A quiet and peaceful place worth a visit. They were not mentioned in my Feb. 2015 Lonely Planet guide. Some portions of the gardens close at 5:00PM while the main areas are open till 7:00PM.
,,Something different,5.0,,If you are interested in Chinese & Japanese culture this is a place you must definitively visit. No entrance fee. Took us at least 2hrs to roam around & take pictures
,,Amazing view and beautiful place,4.0,,You'll have an amazing view when you enter the different towers in chinese garden. but you'll need atleast 4-5 hrs to see all the places in chinese and japanese garden. But it would be worth your time.
,,Stunning gardens- don't miss them,5.0,,"These are stunning gardens. To get there take the MRT to the Chinese Gardens station and it's a short walk from there. Entry is free. Try to arrive early in the day as it can be hot walking around the vast grounds.
There are many photo opportunities with beautiful arches, bridges and plants to enjoy.
At the Chinese gardens is a live turtle and tortoise museum and entry costs a few dollars.
The bonsai gardens has beautiful specimens, some 150 years old.
Best time to visit the gardens is mid week when many Singaporeans are back at work."
,,Bonsai trees and a peace of mind,5.0,,"If you're in Singapore, you must visit this place! It's the most beautiful garden I've ever seen. Beautiful architecture, cool Bonsai trees and peaceful atmosphere."
,,Amazing afternoon chilling out,5.0,,"So some of the entrances are shut so I walked for over half an hour in the heat trying to find it. Get off at the garden/lake stop and go in through the Chinese gardens not the Japanese as they are working on that entrance! No cafe so eat in advance - I didn't and was starving the whole time. Anyway the views are amazing, the gardens are so beautiful! Random spots to sit and chill or read a book or whatever etc etc. The pagodas are good - climbed up to the 7 storey one - breathtaking views. The bonsai garden was incredible and there is honestly so much to see there! I spent about 6 hours there! Also went to the turtle museum - brilliant! Take a picnic and some sun cream and loads of water and you will enjoy relaxing there. Get the mrt it's the easiest way to arrive from the city!"
,,Wonderful Green oasis,5.0,,Worth it for the bonsai collection alone with some trees being over 300 years old. Made it through about halfway around the park and have to say it was wonderfully kept and maintained.
,,Green environment,4.0,,"Easy to access from mrt,in there you will seen some chinese and japanese culture and its free to enter the garden.visit bonsai garden will make your visit worthy and try to see the sea turtle museum in the chinese garden"
,,relaxing place,4.0,,"We have visited the bonsai garden and it was great. Lovely decorated trees in a great surrounding. Worth a visit for sure and it's free of charge. The MRT station ""Chinese gardens"" brings you right there."
,,Incredibly tranquil,5.0,,"What a beautiful place. An almost hidden tranquil gem in a bustling city - beautiful gardens just outside the main city area, easy to get to via the MRT (stops right at the gardens) and very quiet with mainly locals wandering through it. We were here during peak holiday season for Singapore and these gardens had hardly anyone in them. Stunning pagodas.

Did not visit the turtle enclosure."
,,Tranquil and serene,4.0,,"These two gardens have been here for a very long time. The gardens are well maintained over the years. During the evening and early morning, I can see many old folks and residents staying nearby exercising in the park. Very good sceneries around the garden. Certain parts of the gardens really feels like one which we find in china."
,,Good for long walks,4.0,,"Great place for long walks or runs. Easy to get to, however you need to be prepared for a lot of walking. There are no easy ways to get around inside without walking. I saw a buggy, however that's not used for visitors.

Very peaceful and quiet. Good for a couples or friends outing and picnic spots."
,,"Nice Walk and Park with Chinese and Japanese Temples, Pagodas, Bridges, Gates",4.0,,"My wife, two children and I visited the Chinese and Japanese Gardens after our visit to the Jurong Bird Park. The park was a very nice place to walk and had Chinese and Japanese temples, gardens, pagodas, bridges and gates. If you plan to go to Singapore and want another nice place to go, I would go here. The taxi driver told us that there were plans to close the park in 2017 but I am not sure about that."
,,Tranquil,5.0,,Next to the MRT station these gardens are very pleasant avoid the weekends very busy.Go in a morning and you can enjoy a pleasant shaded stroll around the gardens for an hour or two.
,,Nice area but a bit crowded on sundays,3.0,,Just arrived in S'pore I wanted to relax and acclimatise a bit in the Japanse garden. It is a very nice garden with beautifuly designed spots but on a Sunday it can get crowded. Of course this will be very quiet compared to Orchard Road but if you are looking for peace and some meditation you might get sidetracked by the chitchat of the visitors. The adjacent Chinese garden is connected with a very symbolic bridge.
,,Serene and peaceful,4.0,,I spent 4 hours there leisurely walking and checking everything out! I really enjoyed it! Such a rare spot for nature in Singapore. So many big lizards around and a very very interesting turtle museum! And all the bonsai trees in the Japanese Garden. It's one of a very few places that are not crowded on the weekends in Singapore:)
,,Beautiful Place,4.0,,"The gardens is a perfect place for an evening stroll. The bridges, rocks and flowers are very beautiful to see. there is a big pagoda as well and the view from top is very good. The place gets crowded on holidays and Sundays. It is peaceful, quiet, calm place and is a must visit if you are in West Singapore."
,,Special green place,4.0,,Easy getting there with bus or mrt its a big beautiful and free entrence. Spent there 2 hours with the kids. The buildings are so nice and its well taken care of. A little bit far from other places but if you need green and quite its a dreamy place to visit. I have never been in a chinese garden before so its look just like in the picture. Very nice.
,,Chinese and Japenese Gardens,4.0,,"It's nice to see this big and green garden amidst the densely populated Jurong Town. We can view both gardens conveniently as they are linked via a nice oriental bridge. It's a great place for exercise, phototaking,family bonding, picniking etc. The landscape and architecture befits the culture and history of the two gardens. People can also enjoy the panoramic view of the town of Jurong from the tallest level of the pagoda by climbing the many flights of stairs. If the time is right, you can also spot migratory birds there, which is quite a rare sight. Another plus point is that admission is free."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,We went early afternoon on a bright sunny day. The buildings are just stunning against a blue sky. Free to enter and see the well kept gardens. Easy to get to on the MRT. You can climb the large pagoda quite a few steep steps but the views are great.There is so much to see around every corner. Take a picnic and enjoy the peacefulness. There is a turtle museum but we gave this a miss.All parts of the gardens are well planned out.
,,"A serene, peaceful and huge gardens with many cheap eateries opposite across the road",5.0,,"This huge park is outside the chinese garden mrt station. Entry is free and will take you an hour or two to walk the whole place. Many monitor lizards are present there and there is also a turtle museum (entry fee require) inside the park. Do fit up yourself with jogging shoes for a walk here. Directly across the park which is opposite the chinese garden mrt station, there are many eateries, cafes and food market available for some great meal. Price for the food is cheap and many great local foods are available there. Do check out if you are there."
,,Superb gardens,5.0,,"This was our favourite place during 3 days in Singapore. We visited in the morning when there seemed to be not many people about. A must place to visit. Well maintained gardens, the Bonsai trees are stunning. Lots of birds and quite a few Malaysian Water Monitors in the ponds and lakes."
,,Really enjoyed it here,4.0,,"We caught the train early morning to visit. It is a lovely peaceful garden full of topiary and Chinese/ Japanese landscaping. Lovely trees pergodas bridges and houses, but there is not much shade from the sun"
,,Evening walk in the gardens,3.0,,"An older style open park with oriental gardens and buildings. It was one of the first gardens built in Singapore , hence a little dated. Nevertheless it is interesting and a good place for an evening walk ."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese Gardens are the gardens to go to relax in the evening, sitting by the lake or under the pavilion or go for a jog. The two gardens are situated next to each other on two little islands connected via a bridge with both islands connected to the main island. The Chinese Garden is modeled along the northern Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscape. The Japanese Garden is a strolling garden showcasing a landscape style originating from the Muromachi and Momoyama periods of Japanese history. It is accessible from Chinese Garden or Lakeside MRT stations."
,,Just to Roam Around,3.0,,"The gardens, both the Chinese and Japanese is quite a large place. Good for family or just a place to relax."

,,Nice relax garden,4.0,,"Nice relax garden, well maintained, good for jogging, famous around localities, Not must see place. Your here for long time , then you can try visiting it."
,,Well maintained... but not exciting,3.0,,"No regrets with the gargens - both are really well maintained. However, its not a must see; you can skip these if you are short on time in Singapore."
,,Picturesque gardens to wander,5.0,,"These gardens are easy to get to on the MRT and you get off at the Chinese Garden stop and just walk straight along marked path to the gardens. Two garden areas Chinese and Japanese garden areas and absolutely stunning if you enjoy picturesque walks. When you enter straight away there's the garden of the eight heroes which has eight statues of characters from Chinese folklore such as Mulan (yes the character in the Disney cartoon film), and Confucius each with tablets telling their stories. In the gardens there is a very high pagoda as you enter, then another pair down by the rivers edge, all of which you can climb up for stunning views, but the tall one requires good stamina for the climb. There is a Tortoise and Turtle museum in the grounds which cost $3 SGD to get in, and supposedly the tortoises and turtles are all pet rescue cases. We found it a bit sad with some of the conditions the animals were living in, but according to a statement displayed they are vetted by government controls!!! Hopefully the $3 will help their plight!!! Anyway apart from that the gardens are a very pleasant place to chill out for a day. Be warned as vast as the area is, there were no refreshments supplied, apart from a chap selling bottles and cans of drinks at the gate where you enter, so take plenty of water."
,,A good date place with your camera,4.0,,"If you are looking for a serene place that you can admire asian architecture and culture, relax, walk and take pictures, this is the place. I would recommend wearing comfortable shoes and bringing water and some quick snacks. Both gardens to cover requires some walking.

Very accessible, it just a few steps from the
I visited on a weekday and it was a perfect time because there were not so many people.

Very safe for solo women photographer like myself."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"There are Japanese and Chinese gardens and turtle museum. the gardens are beautiful, plenty of trees and a good way to relax away from the crowded city. you will be able to do running/walking and cycling on the wide paths."
,,Beautiful!!!,5.0,,"We visited ages ago and remember it being beautiful, the pagoda, garden, flowers, everything!! Will definitely visit again if we're in Singapore!"
,,A little gem just outside the city,4.0,,"Easy to get to by MRT, these lovely gardens are great for a stroll and chilling out, although we went on a bank holiday so it was fairly busy. Worth a visit to escape the hustle and bustle of city life."
,,A pleasant stroll,5.0,,"I love going to these Gardens. It's a great outing, with some head phones in checking out the scenery. My favourite thing to do in Singapore. Keep an eye out for the turtles, squirrels, and monitor lizards. The tortoise museum is definitely worth the $5 entry fee, to see all the different types of tortoise. Although a little sad to see them stuck in small tanks."
,,Great for a Relaxing Walk Away from the Crowd,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore and find it's just too crowded everywhere you go, and if like me, you hate crowded place, do visit Singapore Chinese / Japanese Garden. It's not as crowded as anywhere else in Singapore. There are a lot of nice views here which you can take photos or just enjoy the scenery and fresher air. Booking is not required. Entrance is free. It's located at the west part of Singapore close to IMM which is Singapore's Largest Outlet Mall. I would recommend that you visit the Chinese Garden in the morning say 7am when it's not too hot. Do bring water and some light snacks as there are not many shops at this place. After 9am or 10am, the few snack shops will start to open and you can grab drinks, light snacks and ice cream. Toilets are available. On weekends, you can see a few people doing Tai Chi exercise if you reach here about 7am - 8am. Once you are done, you can grab taxi at the main road and head down to IMM where you can have breakfast or brunch and continue shopping at this outlet mall. This place is great to catch Pokemons too."
,,calm and quiet,3.0,,"One of the most beautiful gardens in Singapore is this park.
It has nice and unique gardening and interesting statues. Some of the statues are the Chinese year`s symbols.
You can find your own Chinese birth year and find out which characters you have!
Most of the time, the park is not crowded except at public holidays and also when the ""Pokemon go"" players attend there!!!
In neighbor of the Chinese garden, you can access to the Japanese garden. Actually, they are in the same area; just a bridge separates these two gardens.
Japanese garden, as it clear by its name, has Japanese gardening and architecture. There is a Bonsai garden in middle of it. Some of the Bonsais has more than one century of life span.
I really loved these wonderfull, tiny and old planets.
Here is a good place for relaxation, meditation, yoga and daily work out.
The washrooms are clean and reachable. You can find drink water spots easily but it is better to bring your own water bottle.
For long walk bring your hat, wear sunglasses and use sun-protection cream!"
,,Great but parts are closed at the moment,4.0,,"We loved these gardens, especially the bonsai garden in the Chinese garden. The gardens were virtually empty on a weekday and close to Chinese Gardens or Lakeside MRT stops. Free entry. Note that the part of gardens near the lake itself on the way to the Chinese and Japanese Gardens is closed. You have to walk a fair bit to get to the actual gardens from teh Chinese Garden metro stop. Don't let this put you off but take water!"
,,Underrated tourist spot.,4.0,,"Not many tourists may know these gardens (probably most of them go to Gardens by the Bay), but surprisingly, we enjoyed our visit here. We went on a weekday as advised by one of the T.A. members, and it was really quiet and peaceful. We had many photos with good scenic backgrounds. There was also a group of photographers who were waiting for something in the lake, probably a rare tortoise or something :D

Easy access since it has its own train station."
,,Pokemon HEAVAN,4.0,,"Enjoying nature in Singapore, has the added benefit of Pokemon hunters added to the mixture now. On my recent trip there seemed to be approx 10 people enjoying the great spaces and relaxing and many many many hunting the elusive Pokemon.

The great thing is that there is so much space that we can all enjoy a day out and feed whatever desires we are needing to feed."
,,Beautiful wildlife in Singapore,5.0,,"Handy to reach by train, these gardens offer excellent opportunities for taking photos of Singapore's colourful birds, as well as flowers. There are turtles in the pond, and the Chinese zodiac statues, pagoda and other buildings are beautiful and great for photo opportunities. A free activity to do, the gardens have water fountains and toilet facilities too - you can walk for quite a bit too, so great for spending time. And the birdlife really is great here!!"
,,Enjoyable and peaceful,4.0,,"The locals don't rate it, but I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful tribute to Chinese and Japanese heritage. Also, for those on a budget, it's perfect because entrance is free. Another bonus is that it's right next to an MRT stop. I spent an entire morning just walking around and enjoying the sights and sounds."
,,Peaceful,5.0,,This attraction is worth you going out away from the main busy area to enjoy a true Japanese Garden experience. Here you will see natural wildlife living as it was meant to live. The sound of the wind moving through the open area allows you take in the peace that nature provides. You have some great photo opportunities with some structures that only this area has. You are allowed to walk as much or as little as you like. There is an area that provides a paying turtle park. You will see some turtles that only this part of the world has. The way it was set up allows the water surrounding the area to serve as a reflection of objects.
,,Enjoyable Gardens,5.0,,The Chinese and Japanese gardens were clean and well maintained. There is no entrance fee. Thorough enjoyed the bonsai gardens.
,,Not impressed,3.0,,"Just bypass these and go straight to the Orchid Gardens. These gardens are quite a long way out. We went by train, a pleasant enough trip and a short walk. But the gardens didn't deliver. Nothing much in flower and the upkeep left a bit to be desired."
,,Historical gardens of singapore,5.0,,"It is very close to my home..The Chinese & Japanese Gardens are joined together by a bridge and offer a picturesque location with lush green lawns and stunning views of the Chinese Pagodas and lake. Bring your camera for this postcard perfect view. Kids can ride around the tracks, play ball games, fly kites or feed fish in the ponds while you stroll through the gorgeous mini gardens such as the Bonsai Garden or pop into the live Turtle and Tortoise Museum.
For just SG$5 (SG$3 for children under 6), get up close with more than 800 turtles and tortoises of more than 50 different species! Many of these reptiles are kept in enclosures, but others roam freely around the grounds. For a dollar, you can also pet and hand feed some of them!
The Chinese and Japanese Gardens, which are being developed into Jurong Lake Gardens, are islands that sit in Jurong Lake. The gardens are connected to each other by the Bridge of Double Beauty. Both the gardens are popular with photographers and lately, cosplayers, who want to feature the unique architecture found within the gardens as part of their photoshoots.
The adjoining Japanese Garden is modelled on Japanese gardening aesthetics of the Muromachi and Momoyama period and features arched bridges, stone paths, rock waterfalls, stone lanterns and Japanese-styled pagodas."
,,Very large area here...,4.0,,My parents and I like to walk in this garden because of the very large area. And i think there's no many people know about this garden. They are prefer to go to garden by the bay. Fee entrance is FREE.
,,Quiet area in the western part of Singapore,3.0,,"A nice place to jog or stroll in the morning or evening. But during weekend this place will be filled with Philippines maid and bangala boyfriends having their lover moment there. Otherwise, it was a good place for a moment of quietness."
,,"Jogging, Nature and man made building",4.0,,Two parts of the garden and Japanese garden is smaller than Chinese. Early morning to bird photography and busy with Jogging and runner all day round.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"Good way to spend a morning,right in front of the Chinese Garden train station.Has two gardens,Chinese and Japanese.Huge!Remember to take a picnic basket with a mat to lay and sit down.Relax and enjoy the view of the Pagoda."
,,Magnificent Bonsai display,5.0,,"Not well promoted but possibly because it is free.
Easy access from the MTR train service with station right at the gardens.
Very restful visit in our otherwise hectic itinerary. Just stroll around at your own pace. Climb to the top of the pagoda is a must do.
Highlight for me was the magnificent display of Bonsai trees.
Despite all the attractions Singapore has to offer this is the one that will remain with me for a long time to come."
,,Nice and cleaned garden,4.0,,When we enter you will feel as we are entering our own garden. Because it is so clean. We can a cess every corner of the garden. We can relax at water poundage.
,,"Peaceful, pictureistic Garden",4.0,,"I lived around the area for almost 20yrs, but nvr really been into the place until i brought my BF from UK for a visit. He loves it and so do i. Feeling relax just by walking in the garden, seeing all the greens, small lake and kind of bringing you back into the Chinese Dynasty period. Have been visiting since and is FOC. See you there."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Beautiful gardens well laid out worth a visit, fantastic bonsai trees and a turtle sanctuary onsite, we went in the morning before it got very hot!"
,,Nice place to have a sack lunch,5.0,,This is a great place to go waste an hour or two and have a long lunch. Nice statues and Pagodas. Good place to shoot some pictures.
,,Tranquil sanctuary 👍,4.0,,"The last time I visited was during the mid-Auterm festival many years ago. The place was understandably packed to the brim and I never went back till today. This time I went at 8am on a Friday morning for a walk and found the tranquility and quiet I was looking for.

Parking at the Japanese Gardens was very limited, so I parked at the Chinese Gardens instead which was free. Admissions was FOC as well and they open at 5.30am. I guess you are allowed to feed the fishes and ride your bicycle here since I saw people doing that. Note to self: maybe next time I'll pack my bike and bring some bread.

I enjoyed admiring the beautifully maintained landscape. I was a little lost as there didn't seem to be any park map sign boards at different parts of the park to show the overall layout and where you are. There were signs to point you towards different areas though. Eventually I ended up at the bridge leading to Japanese Gardens. The landscape changed a bit to reflect the Japanese style which was very nice. There were less people here maybe because it's a further walk away.

It's a really nice park where you can get good quiet ""me"" time in the cool mornings. I definitely give it the thumbs up and will return."
,,A Quiet Place When You Avoid Sundays,4.0,,"If you reside in a hotel somewhere in the city centre you need to take the East West Line (MRT, green) towards Joo Koon. You will need approx.20min to the stop called CHINESE GARDEN.
The walk afterwards is roughly 5-7min.
The gardens are really nice and you can enjoy a bit of piece and quietness within this busy city. The gardens are open to public until dawn (7pm) and you can explore the Japanese and Chinese Garden. Both garden landscapes are nice. Whereas you find a collection of bonsais on an extra island, the typical Japanese Garden can be reached via a white bridge. Chinese Gardens are easier to explore. There you will also find the turtle/turtoise world (I have not visited it, so I dont know if it is worth it). Beautiful photo stops are near/on Twin Pagoda, the Big Pagoda and near the Chinese Gate. Please avoid to go there on a Sunday. It is packed with people who sit almost EVERYWHERE. Go there during weekdays and you will have the gardens almost for yourself (and some other tourists maybe :) )"
,,Worth a visit but not high priority,4.0,,Its a nice place to go with open park land and some interesting statues and gardens but its best for people on long stays in Singapore - a tier 2 attraction.
,,Nice to relax,4.0,,Its good to spend some hour with picknick bag. Have turtle pound and some bigger in separate pools. Also in the surrounding you can se lizard in various size
,,Bonsai or Penjing,5.0,,"I really like going to the Chinese and Japanese gardens for bonsai (Japanese name) and penjing (Chinese name). There is large collection of these miniature plants. Some of them are really old one. The second thing that brings me to this place is collection of Japanese garden lanterns. I guess, all known types are there. There are of course many other things that one can enjoy in this garden."
,,Nice,4.0,,Big gardens with chinese leaders and philosopher s statues. You need half day to explore it. Chinese garden MRT is nearest one. Avoid sundaybecause of crowd. Enterence is free of cost.
,,"Chinese side - must see, Japanese side - skip",4.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese gardens are accessible via their dedicated stop on the MRT, entrance is free. Upon entering, the path on the right leads to the Chinese gardens, and the one on the left leads to the Japanese gardens (there is a park map displayed at this junction). The Chinese gardens are worth visiting, as they have beautiful sculptures, architecture, a koi pond choc-a-clock with vibrant fish, and a turtle museum(paid entrance). Ambling through this portion can take you upwards of an hour.The Japanese gardens have one particular area that's worth seeing - a japanese garden re-created, with bonsais, a tiny bridge, even monitor lizards! that spot is as pretty as a post card. There is even a lotus pond nearby.
Recommended - climb up the pagoda to get amazing views of the grounds. Entrance to this closes at 7pm.
Tip : There are no water/food stalls inside therefore the stall at the entance is where you need to stock up on water and ice cream."
,,Bring your walking shoes. ..,3.0,,"This place is located in an expansive field which includes statues of famous Chinese leaders/philosophers leading to a Chinese tower. Beyond the small Chinese garden adjacent to a large, freshwater lake are Japanese structures detailing their distinctive architectural charm. There are several Pagodas overlooking the water. Kids will love seeing the large fish (Tilapia?) swimming along the piers. There is also a repile area with large turtles but I did not visit that part of the expansive site.

There is no problem getting to this site which is located beyond the center of Singapore; there is an MTR station at the entrance to the park.

I was a bit disappointed that the park did not have more to see, but it was a nice visit."
,,A nice walk in the gardens,4.0,,You need to catch the train here but worth the trip. A garden dedicated to Chinese and Japanese history and was quite a nice walk enjoyed by the whole family. The trip to the gardens also gives you a good view of the areas outside of the busy metro. Worth the trip and highly recommend visiting the turtle museum which will set you back a couple of dollars.
,,Quiet outskirts,3.0,,"It is in quiet outskirts of town. Not very crowded. Nice place for photography. Beware of creepy men, My visit was cut short by a creepy man following me , it is scary as the place is quiet deserted. I yelled at him and ran back to the mrt."
,,An underrated natural gem in a bustling metropolis! :),5.0,,"I visited these charming gardens on a Saturday and found the place to be wonderfully quiet and serene. This place is a definite must see for nature lovers! I reckon 3 hours is sufficient for a relaxing and leisurely stroll around both the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. Start with a climb up the 7-storey pagoda for a stunning panoramic view of Singapore, then make your way to the lovely twin pagodas.

There is a gorgeous bonsai garden located within the Chinese Gardens, where you can sit on a stone seat and admire the beautiful scenery. The Chinese Gardens also has a live tortoise and turtle museum (that deserves more love), which houses rare species from across the world. There is plenty of squirrel and bird watching to be done as well around the gardens. In fact, I managed to spot a Kingfisher, which was awesome!

Once you have completed a full circuit of the Chinese Gardens, cross over the long white bridge into the Japanese Gardens to see picturesque red bridges over water lily filled ponds. I would love to visit here again in the future with a good book and a picnic basket. The Chinese and Japanese Gardens are truly an underrated natural gem in a bustling metropolis! :)"
,,Gardens are Nice,5.0,,I like going during the weekdays when no one is there. The pagodas are nice to see and I've been to the top of them. The large one is probably more worthwhile and a decent view of the area. My favorite area to see in these gardens is the Bonsai Garden. I also like seeing the Lotus flowers in the ponds. There's some pretty stuff. It's probably a 1.5 hour visit and some good time outside in the full sun so bring your umbrella or sunscreen.
,,Nice & Quite Garden,4.0,,"I like the surrounding area of this garden very nice and very quite.

Tips: Preferred visit this garden in the morning coz you are still can enjoying the fresh air and no too crowded.

Opening Hours
Chinese Garden: 6 AM - 11 PM
Japanese Garden: 6 AM - 7 PM

Free of Charge

It is very close from MRT station you just walk down from the station then you will enter the area"
,,Beautiful and Relaxing Garden,4.0,,"If you go there in the morning you will see some people do their work out, whether it's running, walking, taichi, or just fishing. So this place has Japanese side and Chinese side and I only went to the Chinese part because I was in a rush. It's clean and very well maintained for a public spot - just like all public facilities in Singapore I think. I think I'll bring along my books and just dive myself there to read."
,,Chinese / Japanese Gardens,5.0,,There is section of Singapore amidst the busy life that is so relaxing that you forget you are in a hectic city. There are some 200 year old Bonzi's and the buildings are exquisite. If you dont mind a bit of walking - it is so great you will be talking about it for years to come. A must see for Singapore
,,Fabby,5.0,,"A Singapore great, lovely walking around the two gardens slowly. we relay enjoyed our re visit. ----"
,,Open spaces,5.0,,"Discovered this on out 2nd last day in Singapore, caught the train and found a large open spaced parkland, very uncrowded. Like the rest of Singapore spotless, a great time spent wandering the gardens watching the fish and birds."
,,"Great place for nature-lovers, to relax, and to get peace",5.0,,"Chinese Garden, in my opinion, is one of the underrated sites in Singapore. The whole area - which is unlike less developed places such as MacRitchie Reservoir or Pulau Ubin Island - is beautifully built and maintained, while at the same time it doesn't feel commercial like Sentosa.

It is easily accessible via Chinese Garden MRT, or you can bike to and around the whole place. Walking throughout the park could take you anywhere between one to three hours depending on how much you want to cover the gardens, and how much time you want to spend on photography.

The park is extremely scenic, with countless photographic opportunities especially around the eveneing. The vastness of the park also allows it to be isolated from the hassle of the city as well as not to feel crowded. Must-see sights include the Twin Pagodas (near the Jurong Lake), the 7-story Pagoda, Bonsai Garden (do not miss!), and the Japanese Garden. The Japanese Garden specifically had that feeling of being away from all the city hustle, like I felt I was in a rather heavenly, peaceful, serene place.

This is a place to go, exercise, and/or relax especially if you live in the West area. Highly recommended.

Tips:
* Bonsai Garden is open until 5pm, while the 7-story Pagoda and the Japanese Garden are open until 7pm. The rest of the park operates until 11pm (officially, I'm not sure if people can still visit afterwards).
* Try climbing up the 7-story Pagoda before 7pm - sunset (e.g. ~6:50pm) to have a nice view of the sunsest behind the Jurong Lake.
* Bring water or drinks if you're exercising or staying longer. There are a few water fountains near toilets, but they were hardly usable the day I was there. Same goes with the snacks if you don't want to go to the MRT for convenience stores.
* If you don't mind some extra walking, you can either start at Jurong Lake MRT and finish at Chinese Garden MRT, or vice versa. The lake is a nice place to walk around especially in the evening and around sunset.
* You may get lucky and catch the sight of some tropical birds or even pelicans. They're easier to spot near the lakes or ponds.
* Apply sunscreen if you go during a sunny day. There are paths which are not covered and can get you eassily sun-burned. Same goes for raincoats and umbrellas on rainy days."
,,Probably the most interesting park in Singapore with some kitsch and peace,4.0,,"For tourists this is going to be out of the way - in Singapore term. For those looking for a bit of tackiness but peace at the same time, this is a bit different from the usual Singapore you will get. No hippies here and is out in Jurong, but this is a relatively well designed and peaceful park."
,,Chinese and Japanese garden,5.0,,A quiet reservoir which is turned into a park. Take the mrt to Chinese garden mrt and you can see the park. Very clear signage. A good place to take photo and relax and have a panic .
,,Peaceful and lush,5.0,,Very peaceful with lush greenery.. Ensure to carry some snacks and a waterbottle and of course a camera..
,,total relaxation guaranteed,5.0,,"From a first visit to Singapore away back in 1978 to this year, 2016, I've always tried to fit in a visit to these gardens.

For some reason they are always quiet, so no queues anywhere. As mentioned previously, the MRT is almost adjacent to the Gardens which are immaculately kept. Ideal for a quiet wander amid the bustle of Singapore.

Highly recommended"
,,Best View and Quiet,5.0,,"I am happy when visiting this park, in addition to these gardens are beautifully clean and quiet. The place is also within easy reach, I stay in Geylang and near the MRT station, simply take the MRT station to the Chinese Garden. The garden is suitable for walkers and fresh air."
,,Beautiful gardens,5.0,,"A little off the beaten path, a detour to the Chinese and Japanese Gardens is well worthwhile. Less crowded than Botanic Gardens or East Coast Park, the gardens are a great place for a relaxed stroll, or to jog. There's limited shade in the Chinese Garden, so on a hot day it can be very very hot - make sure to bring sunscreen and water. Parking lots are available outside of the gardens."
,,Calm Place in the middle of Hustle and Bustle,4.0,,This place provides a calm and tranquil place in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Its a relatively big area with a tortoise park inside it. The place also has a big enough lake where you can enjoy kayaking/boating. Overall a very nice place to spend the weekend.
,,"""Tranquil park""",4.0,,It is beautiful garden with lush greenery. There is Guinness world record holder for live turtles with over 3000 variety of turtle species. There is the oldest turtle which 95 years old. I saw people jogging around and exercising. Recommend to visit for those who enjoy nature and watch turtles.
,,VERY lovely place,5.0,,"Lovely place for many reasons:
stroll, jog, brisk walk

learn about heritage, as there many educational explanations of mythical Chinese and
Japanese folklore.

Awesome place to take plenty of photos, with nice vantage points on the respective pagodas.

Do not hesitate. Easily accessible by MRT on the EW Line."
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Chinese and Japanese Garden is a beautiful garden and best place to visit either early morning or evening. Its well maintained, although a very few tourists visit hear. Easily accessible from MRT do visit this beautiful garden. Entry is free."
,,Good place for wedding photo,4.0,,It a great place for wedding photo if you are looking for green scenery in your wedding photo it a nice place that you should visit.
,,Trip to Chinese and Japanese garden,4.0,,"Beatiful place for those who loves nature and gardens . Chinese and japanese gardens can be reached via MRT . Nearest startion is Chinese garden station or lake side station . From bouna vista MRT east west line connects chinese gardens . 7 storied pagoda, twin pagoda , turtle museum ,bonsai gardens , japanese gardens are few main attractions here . Entry to turtle museum and bonsai gardens closes by 5:00 pm .Its worth spending half day of your trip here ."
,,A Day with Jacqi my UK visitor,4.0,,"Jacqi & I love visiting natural reserve n garden to stroll n rest & relax daydreaming,read a book, tate -a tate, walking among greenery apart from city roaming. This situated north of Singapore beside visiting the Jurong Town presinct this is refreshing side trip enroute. So sounds good to you? have a jog there too if you like and picture taking dont miss it ..enjoy"
,,Calm and Peacefull,4.0,,"Though it's quite far from the city center but worth a visit, a getaway from malls and usual tourist attractions. It has ponds,lake, and bonsai's garden. Great place to reading,unwind, relax and enjoy fresh air with green scenery surround you."
,,Relaxing place,5.0,,"A nice place to just walk around or to do exercise, its a large park with many buildings, bridges and statues to see, its open until very late and its free to enter. Its just next to MRT station with same name."
,,Free and worth a visit,5.0,,"€2.40 each way on the train from the city centre and then you can have a great half day or more strolling around these gardens without spending another cent. These gardens cover a large area and it's up to you how long you want to walk for: we spent about 2.5 hours but didn't see the whole area. Monitor lizards, koi carp, turtles, white breasted moorhens and squirrels can be photographed easily. On Thursday afternoon there were very few other people there. Climb up the High Pagoda for a great view. Bring a picnic -at least a drink - as we had to go to the Turtle Museum to buy a drink : maybe more outlets are open at busier times. Lovely to escape the city for a while: recommended."
,,Don't forget the Japanese garden.,5.0,,We have been to the Chinese Garden many times and indeed the MRT is also called Chinese Garden. There is however a Japanese Garden too. This time we turned left after entering the Park and had a nice peaceful walk around the Japanese Garden. The Garden is well set out and beautifully maintained. It is smaller than the Chinese garden but well worth a visit.
,,Beautiful Pagoda,5.0,,"Visited on 9thApr16' in the morning by MRT,alight at Chinese Garden station,tap out ezlink card see left is the walk path link to the entrance. Just walked straight,actually on the mrt u can see the 7th Storey Pagoda. Entering from mrt station is the East Entrance. If u want to cover Chinese n Japanese Garden,u can started from right hand side so that after completing Chinese garden can continued Japanese Garden. But for me,just covered Chinese Garden so i started on the left.

First of all, is the Garden of Abundance,there r twelve zodiac statues n the Sundial. And there r small benches w some of the 12 zodiac at both ends. Spotted a Mickey Mouse,dragon,roaster.Next is the Bonsai Garden but is open at 9am so I process to Tea House Pavilion,many big black colour fishes n there r ppl throwing bread (own bring)to feed them. Next to it is the Confucius Statue. Further up there r many stones craft w red bold words of describing of love. Beside it is the Live Turtle & Tortoise Museum,need admission fee.

Then I process to Stone Boat,is opposite the Tea House Pavilion. Walked further down is the West Entrance,where the Garden Courtyard n White Rainbow bridge are. Then process to Twin Pagoda,is just (3 storeys only) but staircase is narrow.

Then I went back to the Bonsai Garden,there r 2 Terracotta Army statues兵马俑 at the both side of door. There r many bonsai displays.

8 Heroes statue,Yue Fei,Hua Mu Lan,Admiral Cheng Ho,Confucius,etc...Then I climbed up the 7 Storey Pagoda-云塔(cloud pagoda)nice name,the staircase is board so is easy to climb but is high too if u non stop climbing up. Very good scenery for taking photos.

It took me 2hrs to explore the whole garden n finished up my 1.5litre of water as is a sunny day. Took 140+ of photos. There r kiosk(East Entrance,mrt station)selling drink, bottle mineral water, $1 n drinks never check. Like the whole experience,plus it is free admission. There r many ppl jogging,exercising n walking around. There r many signs showing which way back to mrt station too."
,,Very big garden,3.0,,"It is a very big (free) garden. Prefer the Chinese Garden as it is nice and maintained better. You can feel like in China. It could be exhausted for elderly and little children but no worry because they provide bench. Lack of facility, not much toilet and the toilet is a bit dirty.
Japanese garden is quite small and not much to see."
,,Park,4.0,,This is very nice park.A good place to walk about.This Chinese garden layout is very good.A good place for a family outing and to know Chinese style garden.
,,Best gardens at the western Singapore,4.0,,"this is my best gardens for my morning exercise, just located infront of Chinese Gardens MRT station, this 2 gardens have a very nice chinese and a japanese architecture with nice scenaries, lakes, greenaries. These 2 gardens are also a favorite picnic sites especially on Sundays with lots of foreign workers occupying the area. This open field is an ideal spot for flying kites, drones, mini planes etc."
,,Large but Nice Gardens with over 40 Bird Species if you Look for Them,4.0,,"Get off the MTR at Chinese Gardens (a good clue in the name). Walk out of the station down the avenue across the green field area and over the bridge to the gate. I'd seen ten or so species before I even got into the gardens. These have ponds and humps and trees and pagodas, lakes and ponds. There's Bonsai and rock gardens and shrubs and reeds. It's large. The station end of the big lake is the most shaded. There are toilets in places but no drink or food. Bring water without doubt.
For birders there are golden opportunities. I saw mother and almost fledged Large-tailed Nightjar in their nest under a bush, Yellow Bittern, four species of Kingfisher, Oriental Dollar Bird, White-headed Sea-eagle, and many more. I met a regular who was only too ready to help."
,,Gem In The West,4.0,,"There are two gardens: Chinese + Japanese. The Chinese garden has statues of Chinese zodiac animals and little Buddhas, really cute! Japanese garden has nice bonsai trees. It can get really crowded over the weekend but still calm to take a stroll around."
,,nice place,4.0,,we visited this place with kids.Its a nice and quiet place. kids can run around.It has parking too.some nice pagodas.can take good pics
,,Lovely atmosphere,4.0,,"Stopped by this very nice place.

Locals go there for picnics and quality time together. We were there on Sunday and that is the time when it's at its busiest. People everywhere enjoying the time and weather.

Very beautiful and interesting Chinese and Japanese gardens, bonsai trees and the architecture. You will like it here - it's very relaxing."
,,Nice and Peaceful place to visit,5.0,,My girlfriend and I had a nice time touring this garden taking pictures as we walked along the pathway. Nice to see some Asian history. It is free to the public so there is no need to worry about the cost.
,,A little disappointed,3.0,,"Apart from some attractive structures (pagodas and bridges in the main) we found the rest of it to be a bit characterless. It was also much bigger than we expected, so in the heat and humidity pretty hard going. Note that the entrance next to the MRT station is closing in April for some refurbishment work. I don't know how long that will be going on for. Best to check the website before visiting."
,,Peaceful,4.0,,"We visited the Chinese and Japanese Gardens on A Friday morning. There was hardly anybody there and it was very quiet and tranquil. The Chinese Garden is quite extensive and we spent a couple of hours wandering around.
The Japanese Garden is not as extensive and not as interesting.
Very easy to get to on the train - the Chinese Garden station is close by.
Worth a visit - one of the lesser known attractions in Singapore, I think.
Free to get in to the gardens, though there is S$5 charge if you want to go in the turtle museum which is in the Chinese Garden. We didn't go in, so can't comment on whether that part is worthwhile."
,,More tranquil than other parks in the city,4.0,,Great place to relax and escape the high-rises. Easy to get to via the green line. Nice way to spend a weekend morning (before it gets too hot - not much shelter)
,,The bonsai garden is a must,4.0,,"Huge green park with a 7 story pagoda, a twin pagodas and a bonsai garden. You can have a nice stroll and immerse yourself in beautiful structures and fabulous little trees! The Japanese garden on the other island is less interesting. It has a little Japanese style garden with different stone lanterns. Looks nice but def the Chinese garden takes the glory here. It's free to visit, very quiet and we barely saw any people on a weekday morning around 10 AM."
,,The Chinese Garden is wonderful.,5.0,,The Chinese And Japanese Gardens may be less well know than the Botanic Garden Singapore but is every bit as worthy of a visit. Very easy to get to on MRT with its own stop on the line. Its then about a 10 minute walk to the entrance. The Chinese gardens are very well maintained and exquisite with great views from the top of the Pagodas. Whilst the Japanese gardens are interesting they are by no means the best example of Japanese gardens i have seen elsewhere and frankly i found them a bit dull and uninspired. But worth the visit for the Chinese Gardens alone.
,,Very nice garden,5.0,,"Very beautiful place to visit. Nice to walk around and take some photos. Peacefull and clean. Easy to access by MRT. If you go up in the Pagoda, you can have a great view from the garden. I can recommend it for a walk and relax."
,,Free Admission,5.0,,"This place is so nice for morning walk, quiet, clean, and beautiful. There are so many spots to explore here and it's free for public. This place located right in front of MRT station, to get there just take East-West Line MRT to Chinese Garden."
,,Quaint Gardens!,4.0,,Lovely for walks and family outings! Great scope for photography. The pagodas are in good shape but the only downside is that the garden is not very lush and not so well maintained as the Botanic Gardens. Great place to visit the turtles and monitor lizards and to orient oneself with Chinese and Japanese Bonsai gardens. Easily accessible by MRT. Plan a picnic and have a great family time.
,,Fun visit,3.0,,"This place is fun to visit. Although I don't remember it as being one of the highlights, it is a great place to learn more about the culture."
,,Peace and tranquillity,5.0,,Didn't take long to go round this park but it's very nice and peaceful and you have a metro station right at it some nice buildings and statues you will get some nice photos and there's a section if you are into knowing what Chinese animal you were born under as there's a stone statue of each animal of the zodiac with the relative years on them
,,Good for strolling,4.0,,"Good for jogging, strolling and enjoy the tranquility scenery. Just opposite the chinese garden mrt. Remember to visit the turtle garden."
,,Quiet and peaceful,5.0,,Very good place for walks Has many beautiful views for sessions Japanese house with bonsai is good for meditation
,,Well woth the half day,4.0,,"Enjoyed the visit .Well worth it . Gardens of tranquil loveliness . easy to get to by getting off at Chinese Garden station , and ambling down the 500 metre long path to the main entrance . Fascinating statues in the Chinese Garden . Stunning bonsai in the Japanese Garden ."
,,Peaceful visit. Worth a stop.,4.0,,"If you want to explore a park in Singapore a little off the beaten path, I would suggest the Japanese Garden and Chinese Garden in Jurong East. Both Gardens are built on artificial islands in Jurong Lake (previously Jurong River) and are connected by a 13 arch bridge. The Chinese Garden features a Pagoda, a stone boat, a Garden of Chinese Zodiacs, a stunning Bonsai Garden of over 2,000 trees, and a tea house. The Japanese Garden has fewer obvious attractions as its neighbor but is meant to be a place of tranquility and contemplation. Here visitors can enjoy lily ponds, stone walkways, a traditional resting house, and arching red bridges. We didn't see very many people visiting here (although we did see several anime photoshoots). I would suggest combining a visit to these gardens with the Jurong Bird Park (8 minute car ride away)."
,,Sumblime,5.0,,"This is one attraction that caught my discerning eye. Chinese and Japanese gardens side by side. An impressive entrance behind which are the types of gardens that fits your minds eye very snugly.

Wonderful bonsai garden, Stone Boat, tower, bamboo gardens, koi, statues, water features all merge to give a very restful, graceful and enjoyable experience."
,,Morning outing,4.0,,"A good outing for a couple of hours. The stand out features for me were the Pagoda (nice views), the turtle sightings in the ponds and surprisingly what appeared to be Komodo dragons. The last was a surprise but really nice to see. Entry was free, it is easy to get to, and apart from the heat of the midday sun a good outing."
,,Really An Oasis in Concrete Jungle,5.0,,"Nestled on the eastern side of Singapore, just a step away from the concrete jungle of downtown Singapore are these Chinese and Japanese Gardens, popularly called just the Chinese Garden.

Its a very nice place, lush green with very well designed gardens, replete with water bodies, lots of places to rest, public utilities and even a high rise pagoda. The way the Japanese garden is designed, I actually got an impression that i was waling in one of the gardens I have seen in Tokyo.

On the Chinese side, you have stone statues of Chinese legends which give it a very Chinese flavour, and one large statue of Confucius.

But i think the best part of the Garden is a live tortoise museum displaying live tortoise and turtles from various parts of the world.

The place is very conveniently located close to the MRT line and is certainly worth spending a few hours when you are in SG."
,,"Beautiful, tranquil place",4.0,,"Not good for a hot day, try evenings. Beautiful tranquil place to be, interesting settings. Probably nicer when there are events like the lantern festival going on."
,,A good place for relaxation,3.0,,"This is a very relaxing, tranquility place to go away from the busy singapore schedule, sometime its good to relax. And best of all its free!!"
,,Walk around,3.0,,Came here with my cousin for a random sight seeing at night. At the mrt station alot of foreigner will chill and picnic there. Can see alot of couples and some people jogging there as well. Some part are still close for developing. Overall is a good place to jog and walk around. Some side escape from the city buzz ☺
,,Drab.,3.0,,"Despite the lively, cosmopolitan impression Singapore likes to give its visitors, there are still some bits of it that is quite dull. This is, if unhelpfully, one of them.

OK,it's a park in a residential area, modeled with the archetypal medieval Chinese / Japanese town garden in mind. And a major overhaul is under way: in a few years' time there will be hotels, a more beautiful lake, and dining. Until that is done, however, this area is determinedly delivering little to any tourist. There's hardly anything to see or do on the large expanse of land but walk around aimlessly in the hear - unless you like turtles, or climbing up a long, vertigo-inducing flight of stone steps up the main pagoda to be welcomed by a view of apartment blocks across the lake. The Japanese gardens consist of a small collection of stone sculptures, bonsai plants and a little footbridge.

And it can even get a bit noisy if some groups of off-work foreign labourers (there are workers' dormitories in Jurong) decide to have an impromptu party of some sort.

If you want to experience a Chinese or Japanese garden, visit China. Or Japan.Just saying.

If it is considered a better option, there are shopping malls, an MRT station away, at Jurong East."
,,Very peaceful and picturesque,4.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese gardens that are right next to each other are well worth a visit. Easy to get to on Green MRT line there is a stop Chinese Gardens. I would leave a few hours to explore the gardens fully, it is very nice landscaping, many interesting sculptures and it is a fairly large territory. Some parts were still under reconstructions when we were there but all renovation should be finished in January 2016, so even more great photo opportunities."
,,The postcard image of the Mystic Orient Pagoda,4.0,,"Try to make time to spend an hour or two in this serene and beautiful garden settings, after you have taken your photographs, sit and take in the lovely sights, smells, and pleasant surroundings. It will make your heart soar!"
,,Chinese and Japanese gardens,5.0,,These are beautiful gardens . Most of the married couples come here to take their wedding photos .chinese garden has a pagoda . It is colour ful and picture post card perfect .japanese gardens give a feel of japan . A must
,,A test of time,3.0,,"I have been here 3 times spaced out over the course of several years. This was definitely one of my favourite places to visit in Singapore.
Unfortunately, over the course of the years, I have also seen the degradation of this once thriving and beautiful gardens and Turtle museum.
The last time I visited was in 2014. I didn't have to time to fully explore both gardens then. I always visit the gardens in the morning when air is fresh and cool, and there isn't many people. There are a few drink vendors that also sell snacks at the entrance/exit.
I recommend this for young families and older people. It's really nice to stroll around and chill under a tree or by the smaller internal lakes. It's also a great place to go for a jog.
The highlight used to be the Turtle museum. I was lucky enough to see the crown jewel - the mutant and albino turtles which sadly passed away several years ago. There were significantly less turtles/tortoises when I last visited. I recommend to bringing insect repellent if you do visit.
On the way out, I recommend buying fish food and feeding the koi fish. It is a spectacular sight to see the way the all the fishes swirl around in such a confined area."
,,Garden plus turtle museum,4.0,,"When we came, it was a rainy day. We had to buy umbrella at the shop in MRT station. We looked around, but unfortunately there was a lot of renovation. One thing that we loved is turtle museum. Our children enjoyed to see all those turtle and turtoise. The entrance fee for the garden was free. The entrance fee for the museum was $5 for adults and $3 for kids. We can feed the turtle too."
,,"Nice park, bit too busy",3.0,,"Nice statues and garden. We mainly went for the Live Turtle and Tourist Museum (which is OK as a rescue centre but done of the tanks/pens require work to enrich them for the animals).
Gardens are a few minutes walk through a public park with cricket pitches and picnics from MRT station.
Would go again but I would try and go at a time when it is less busy"
,,Tortoise garden is main attraction,5.0,,"Very nice for weekend out. Time required is min3-4hrs. We went with kids they enjoyed most with crocodoil and other species in garden. In japanese garden you can see tortoise park with entry tocket $5 for adult and $3 for kids. Lots of tortoise, you csn touch, feed food.
It is one stop next to jurong east and 5min walk from mrt stop.
Bonsai garden is aldo there. 2 pagodas there. No food stall inside. On the way to park you can get some."
,,serene.,4.0,,"If you want a peaceful place, this is the place. Fresh air, chirping birds is what I've liked. Just sit there and relax."
,,Beautiful Gardens,4.0,,"The Chinese Garden is a park at Jurong East. It is located next to the Chinese Garden MRT station and connected to the Japanese Garden by a bridge. It’s one of those few places where people are scarce and nature is at its full glory. You can spend quality time with your friends and family if you come here for a visit. However not too much of food or restaurants around.

At the main gates of the Chinese Gardens, there are two marble lions, welcoming the visitors and guarding the entrance of the garden. There is also a beautiful pagoda on a small hill in the garden, a Bonsai Garden which has a collection of over two thousand bonsais imported from China and other parts of the world. The entry is free if the park is not witnessing any exhibitions or event. Both parks are connected via bridges and located in the central of a large lake.

We took lot of photographs and spent quality time out there. Once thirsty or wished to grab a bite we immediately ran to the MRTS and quenched our thirst or had a quick bite there itself."
,,nice place but very far,4.0,,"unless you live on the outskirts, this place is not worth visiting all the way, there are vast tracks of green fields and these charming minaretes"
,,Interesting bu too much Work in Progress,3.0,,Interesting park but several parts were closed due to refurbishing work. Maybe next time. Still a place you can for relaxing. Close to the SMRT so it's easy accessible.
,,Worth a visit..,5.0,,If you have some time to spare while you in Singapore and not afraid using the public tansport I would definetly recommend spending a couple of hours walking around in this beutiful garden.
,,Do stop by....,5.0,,"Very nice and quite long walk.....lots of birds, turtles (turtle museum extra cost) and be aware of the Asian water monitor (lizard) we have encountered few and not small ;)"
,,Amazing. Hidden Gem!!!!,5.0,,"I am really surprised that this park is not more prominently shown in tour books; it was a true find! Amazing park, easy to get by metro, FREE, not crowded nor swamped by tourist. What a hidden gem!"
,,traditional chinese garden,5.0,,Love this place been there 3 times will be going again on my next trip to singapore pogodas with big spiral staircases stone statues of chinese wise people like confushes really big dragon lizards in the lake there is a turtle museum with dozens of different types all alive turtles entry isnt much for a few xtra bucks you can feed dozens of little ones in a little mini lake because this is a residential area there arnt many food outlets there a 7/11 at one end of the train station which is right beside the garden allow a bit of time it takes quite a while to see everthing the train station is called you got chinese gardens
,,Artificial Garden,3.0,,"These gardens were constructed decades ago before China opened up and there was a curiosity to see what was inside China. Once China opened up and everyone could go there to see the real stuff, these parks became neighbourhood parks instead for relaxation. It was a attempt to replicate the gardens in Beijing. You can have.a nice jog or walk there. Sometimes bird watchers get lucky."
,,Tranquil thought envoking,4.0,,"The gardens are beautiful. Unfortunately we visited when they were doing huge renovations to both gardens. This meant all the buildings were shrouded in scaffolding. There were no facilities to buy a drink. Walking round was very hot, thankfully we had water with us. The gardens are all maintained and worth visiting even during the renovations."
,,Singapore gardens,4.0,,loved it couldnt be more beautiful - accessible to for my husbands wheelchair. Good information around the gardens to.
,,Great place for couple,4.0,,I was there with my girl friend walking over the garden. It's quiet and beautiful place where you can take a breath and feel comfortable.
,,Beautiful!,5.0,,"We went here on our first day in Singapore. It is so peaceful and a beautiful departure from the hustle of the city center. Even with the renovations going on there is still a lot to see. It is easy to get there, it has it's own mrt stop. The statutes give you a little history if you read them and the little lizards running around are do cute! Be sure to go early in the day because it does get hot!"
,,No lanterns at the Chinese and Japanese gardens?!,3.0,,"We enjoyed visiting the Chinese and Japanese gardens over the autumn/lantern festival however, we were extremely disappointed as most of the buildings were under renovation. In addition there was no lanterns to be seen, no decoration for the festival. Before going we had looked for a website with more info but we couldn't find anything... A bit disappointing! Also the kids wanted to take their scooters around but again when we got there, we saw a sign saying no scooters allowed...
So overall it's probably a very pleasant garden, if only it had a website with more info about it!! Oh, we enjoyed going up the pagoda (they only building not under renovation!). Really nice!"
,,Lots to see for free,5.0,,We were looking for something to do in the morning before the F1 Grand Prix and found the Chinese Gardens. We were only expecting to spend a short amount of time there before doing some shopping but spent about 3 hours wandering around and taking it all in. Easy to get to. There was some construction work going on but this didn't detract from the overall experience. Would recommend this
,,Worth the trip to escape from the city,4.0,,"Singapore can be hot, sticky, busy and frantic at times with lots of glass and concrete

A few stops on the MRT however and you are away from it all in the gardens.

The Japanese and Chinese gardens are both very different (as you would expect) but there is plenty of room to slow down and relax. I saw plenty of families armed with picnics and there is plenty of space to just do your own thing."
,,Large garden with ZEN view,4.0,,"The nearest MRT station is Chinese Garden. They are free of charge if there is not exhibitions or event in either park. Both parks are connected via bridges and located in the central of a large lake.
I like Japanese garden more. This garden located far away from the MRT. It was quiet with multiple small little arch bridges to cross. There are lots of fishes in their ponds. I love to buy some breads and go there to feed them.

If u go there early in the morning, you will be surprised how serene and special the place look. There were times when I went there early in the morning (about 7-8am). I saw some birds hunting for fishes in the ponds.

It might be uncomfortable for some visitors but I find it very interesting and very real. Well, if u like this kinda experience, u need to go there very early in the morning."
,,Best things in life are free!,5.0,,There's so much to see here! We love the park since it's so clean and with very interesting structures. The lake was wonderful because we saw turtles and fishes swimming. My toddler enjoyed watching the Koi fishes and running around the soft grass. A great place to have a picnic and take great photos.
,,Worth the journey,4.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese gardens in Singapore are not in Singapore city, but towards the western side of Singapore island near Jurong. The chinese garden with its pagodas is better, the japanese garden was a bit shabby when I was there. But you can do both easily on foot."
,,Closed for renovation,2.0,,"It's free. It's easily accessible from MRT. The landscaping is nicely done. BUT - either the buildings are closed for renovation and scaffolded, or they are locked for 'maintenance' (bonsai garden). According to signposts, it might be worth going there again from January 2016 onwards."
,,Very green and relaxing,3.0,,"This is a huge garden with many small gardens within. It is very green, has lots of small bridges which are pretty and photogenic, and has a lake as well. It has a very relaxing atmosphere with lots of trees, lotus pond, and small Japanese stone lanterns. It gets pretty crowded in parts during weekends. It is not a must visit place in Singapore but can definitely go once."
,,Huge and a great picnic spot,4.0,,"it is well connected with SMRT, with the station right at the entry of the gardens. i was lucky to visit on a day with great weather. Turn On - Clean, Signboards all around, disable friendly, rest rooms Turn Off - No eatery options."
,,Good place to go during the weekend,3.0,,It's a good enough place to spend a couple of hours and learn more about Chinese history and culture.
,,"See teracotta soldiers, bonsais and a pagoda etc.",4.0,,A picturesque and well-maintained park to visit for interest and exercise. Hop off the MRT at Chinese Garden station and be prepared to walk a mile or more around the gardens. Plenty of photo opportunities. Food and toilet facilities are available.
,,So huge! But didn't allowed using bycicle!,3.0,,"It was super duper huper wuper huge garden! From the upfront, I can see the map, it divided into two sections: Japanese and Chinese garden. But to arrived in Japanese area, we have to go through the Chinese area first.

It was so huge! And after an hour, we decided to stop and go back. We had seen the Chinese area for pagoda, gazebo, and 12 shio characters.

Kinda fun, but if they allow the bycicle to get in probably will be better."
,,Unique oriental garden,4.0,,Situated in the west side of Singapore. This is a popular place to visit during mid autumn festival as there will be brightly lilted lanterns and fireworks. The pagoda shape tower adds uniqueness to the garden. There are no theme park rides here.
,,"Nice, quiet and no crowds...",4.0,,Right off the MRT Chinese Garden station. Very nice gardens very well kept up. Nice change of pace from the city. Worth a visit to see where the locals live and hangout.
,,"Beautiful place to relax, away from regular noisy places! :-)",5.0,,"Easily reachable by MRT are these soothing gardens. You can easily spend a couple of hours taking a walk around these lush gardens, pack a small picnic, sit by the calm lake, read your book in peace, watch the sun set, etc. Happy place! :-)
You can also find people walking/jogging/riding along the tracks around these gardens.

P.S.
There is no entry fee. And Japanese gardens close by 7 pm."
,,Great place,5.0,,"We visited this garden on a rainy day,so we actually couldnt visit the whole garden.But still we could visit 7 storey pagoda and Twin Pagoda.Actually I really attracted to the architecture of these pagoda which feature Chinese culture and architecture.Bonsai Garden looks beautiful,but it was closed for renovation.So we had a look into it from outside."
,,Suburban oasis!,5.0,,"We took a 30 minute MRT ride outside the bustling city center and spent a peaceful day surrounded by these beautiful gardens. The Chinese Garden was absolutely beautiful with a lake, pagoda, tea houses, and a China Gate. We loved it! We crossed a beautiful bridge into the Japanese Garden and entered a different world. It was a peaceful garden that invited relaxation and a sense of serenity! I recommend that anyone wanting a respite from the hustle and bustle of city life, take the time to visit these beautiful gardens!"
,,About as 'Meh' as you would expect,3.0,,"Is there anything fundamentally wrong with the Chinese and Japanese Gardens? No, not really. Is it worth schlepping all the way out to Jurong for? No, not really. It's fine if you like gardens, but the temples of Kyoto it ain't."
,,Peace and tranquility,4.0,,"A lovely peaceful find ... Not too far out from the main central are. The best way of getting here, like so many other places in Singapore, is on the MRT. A brief walk fro. The station and you have the choice of going one direction to the Japanese Gardens, of to the other side and wandering the Chinese Gardens.

We went during the week, and there were not many people around. Reviews I read highlighted the gardens for photographers, and commented that they were often used for wedding photos ... So I'm not sure how busy they would get on the weekend.

Well worth a visit Iv only to escape the hustle and bustle of life"
,,Peaceful and beautiful gardens,5.0,,"Not sure what to expect from these gardens but got on the MRT and arrived at the station refreshed and ready. A short walk brought us to the start of the gardens. Beautiful and peaceful they were a pleasure to walk around, and no charge for either of them. Some renovation work was going on so not all buildings open but the pagoda made up for it. Lovely views from the top. Well worth the easy journey from the centre."
,,Serene and tranquil,4.0,,"It is very easy to visit this attraction. You just need to take the MRT and alight at the Chinese Gardens station and walk to the rear of the station and you will arrive at the entrance. Facing the entrance, on your right is the Chinese Garden and on the left is the Japanese Garden. Admission is free. The opening hours of the Chinese Garden end at 11 pm while the Japanese Garden end at 7 pm.

I like the tranquil and serene environment in these two gardens. It is so quiet and calm even under the scorching heat of the sun. The shades of the trees here provide the cooling effect and I saw couples relaxing at the pavilions, under the tree shades and by the riverside. Singapore is a bustling city with heavy traffic and these two gardens are the best places for solitary meditation and a retreat `far from the madding crowd'.

My company had previously organized a company retreat at one of the pavilions at the Japanese Garden and the discussion was focussed with little environmental disturbance. This time I saw a couple attired in kimono suit taking wedding photographs at the red bridge amidst the well manicured shrubs and ponds. There are also few youths wearing samurai attire with white and golden hair props engaged in film shooting pursuing their favorite pastime hobbies.

I walked to the Chinese Garden and took some photographs with the 13 arch bridge. In Beijing, I came across the 8 or 9 arch bridges but it was the first time I noticed there was this 13 arch bridge. The number 13 don't look very auspicious from the Chinese astrological perspective as compared with 8 or 9. Just don't understand why the bridge need to construct with 13 arches.

The admission to the Live turtle and tortoise museum is charged. For adult is $5/- and for child is $3/-. It is the largest museum of its kind in the world and I was amazed by the extensive and exotic collections of turtle and tortoise in the museum.

The twin pagodas look magnificent beside the pond river and I saw few Filipino tourists climbed up the pagodas to take photographs while few others sat by the pond under the tree shade having their picnic.

I walked past the main pagoda building and saw a few sculptures of the ancient Chinese heroes erected around the pagoda. Each sculpture statue represents a character whose heroic acts or philosophy continue to inspire the future generation such that the values could continue to transmit down to the future and the younger generation and emulate their examples.

We are inspired by the patriotism of Yue Fei whose mother tattooed the word `Be loyal to your nation' on his back. The statue of Commissioner Lin Zhe Shue reminded me of his courageous act in burning and destroying the tons of contraband opium seized during operation and in declaring war against opium addiction that were destroying many innocent healthy lives when they hooked onto such drugs. His valiant act against opium inspired us in our war against the profileration of the illicit drug trafficking and production in this part of the world. The statue of Confucius inspired us with his great philosophy of filial piety, loyalty and the duty to serve the nation.

The bonsai garden was closed for repairs and refurbishment. Opposite the Bonsai Garden, I saw the marble boat that resembled that of the Summer Palace in Beijing. The Summer Palace was constructed during the Ching Dynasty as a summer resort for the royal families but this marble boat in the Chinese Garden was meant for the common people to relax by the pondside.

I noticed on a tile at the main entrance that the Chinese and Japanese Gardens were opened in 1975 by the then Minister of Finance Hon Sui Sen. It is 40 years old this year but both gardens remain well maintained and is a gem, a tranquil and peaceful place for the relaxation of the mind."
,,Red Bridge Over The Lake,4.0,,"after descending from the MRT, directly visible inscription ""chinesse garden"".

There is a very wide yard along the park area. at the end of the road there is a red bridge over the lake. Favorite bridge for visitors. Almost all visitors will never miss to capture images at the top of the bridge."
,,Very nice park,4.0,,Nice statues of the chinese zodiac. Very well kept. A bit far from the city but just outside the MRT.
,,Peaceful retreat,4.0,,"While scrolling around on the maps app on my phone looking for something else I noticed two islands near Jurong East. Zooming in I found the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. A quick bit of research told me that it would be an interest and off-the-beaten-track excursion.

While it would not be a place to visit if this is your first trip to Singapore or if you are only having a brief stay the gardens are attractive, well laid out and beautifully kept.

The Chinese architecture in the gardens is beautiful and you can walk to the top of the pagodas from which the view is excellent. We spent a couple of hours exploring while my oldest son ran around our toddler was happy being wheeled around in his pusher. Access from the MRT (Chinese Garden station) is very easy for strollers and wheel chairs.

There is a little stall near entrance to the park where you can purchase some drinks which I would recommend since there doesn't seem to be anywhere to purchase refreshments in the park.

Also located in the park is the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum.

Definitely worth a visit."
,,a good place to relax,4.0,,"This place is so quite and away from the noise of the city. You can chill, cycling and do outing with family or friends. It is really nice place to escape and relax during weekend if you dont have much time to go outside the country."
,,An experience of a day outing,5.0,,This is away from the city - the best and the fastest way is SMRT train but once you are there the sight will astound you . The vast collection of the Bonsai and the landscape of this garden will keep you looking for more until you leave . Need to plan for a whole day if you have time - not for the tourist in hurry . Good place to relax and feel the Beaty of the landscape .
,,Stunning,4.0,,"A Beautiful haven in a stunning location. We were lucky enough to visit here on honeymoon, and it's definitely worht a visit :-)"

,,Gardens In The West of Singapore,3.0,,"These two gardens are located near each other in Jurong, the west of Singapore.

As the name suggests, one is the Chinese Garden, which is Chinese themed and the Japanese Garden is Japanese themed.

In the Chinese Garden, you have a nice bridge with arches across the lake. Walking around the garden, you also see a pagoda and bonsai plants.

In the Japanese Garden, you have nicely manicured lawns and Zen gardens.

There are plans to upgrade the gardens in the near future, so visit while you can."
,,Pretty Garden,4.0,,A nice garden with statues and other iconic buildings. It houses a tiny museum of living tortoises and turtles. A nice place to just spend a day relaxing and walking with family or pet.
,,Quiet Garden for Refreshing,4.0,,"If you need a time refresh your self, and get some away from the city, these garden are perfect, just take an MRT (green line) and stop at Chinese Garden MRT toward Joo Koon, the exit exactly towards to the Garden. A lot of building and replica of Chinese statue and pagoda. The garden very clean and quiet. We like it here"
,,good healthy walking,5.0,,hilly walk on hot day. carry water a must have a rest at the top . good photos interesting explanation of statues.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"If you have few hours to spare in Singapore, visit Chinese and Japanese Gardens and enjoy that green and calm environment - lot to see and definitely have your camera with you. It's very easy to get there, use Green East-West MRT towards Jurong, about 30 min ride from the City Hall station, stops just were Gardens are (EW25, East entrance), than you have nice short stroll to the entry - go left to Japanese gardens and right to Chinese. Both equally beautiful and free of charge. Bring your picnic basket if you like and relax."

,,Attractive large parkland in the west of Singapore,4.0,,"These gardens are located close to the Chinese Garden mrt station, which is 1 stop west from Jurong East. Covering quite a large area with a few interesting statues and lakes. The main pagoda is currently under renovation. Better to come in the morning to avoid the heat. Free entry."
,,Beautiful gardens - nice pictures!!!,5.0,,"Very nice place to walk, take pictures and relax after hustling city.... Both Chinese and Japanese gardens are very picturesque and green!!! Near metro you can buy some food take-away and enjoy your lunch in the peaceful gardens!!"
,,Peace and tranquility in Singapore,4.0,,"We visited Chinese gardens on a weekday and it was empty, which meant it was lovely and peaceful. There isn't much to do, but that's the point. If it's floral diversity you want then you're better off going to the Botanic gardens, but there are plenty of statutes and structures to look at.
There is also a turtle and tortoise sanctuary which houses all sorts of weird looking reptiles of this kind and worth a visit if you have kids. There is also a small shop here selling drinks and ice cream.
We would definitely recommend visiting if you are looking for a little bit of calm in Singapore, but I can't comment on how busy (or peaceful) it is on a weekend, particularly a Sunday. Easy to get to on green line mrt, 5 mins from Chinese garden station."
,,"Free and open, wide attraction",5.0,,"We had the chance to visit this place via MRT and bring some drinks and snacks with ourselfs from the Cheers Store which is located next to the MRT station. Because they say they have free Wifi and a Teahouse available we expected something more than just a coin operated snack machine. Besides that the place was really nice and we´ve seen a lot of people from different nationalities, some groups occupied the roofed facilities for the whole day, at the japanese garden we found a relaxing area with a roof to sit down. Fun was also to feed the fish between 1 and 1:30 pm nearby the Turtle museum, then also feeding the turtles in the turtle museum itself with salad. Need to return soon ;)"
,,Good photo opportunity,4.0,,Chinese and Japanese Gardens are linked. it is free entry to all and there are very nice demo houses and sculptures and water features for pictures. go in the early morning or evening when it is cooler
,,Pagoda in Chinese Garden under construction,4.0,,"So you won't be able to take a photo of that, unfortunately.
Still, it's worth a visit to the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. Free to enter and open early in the morning, there's no reason not to.
The Chinese Garden features some pretty cool statues of key historical figures (my favourite), the twelve zodiac animals, and houses the Turtle Museum. The various bridges and lakes all make for a spot of wonderful photography.
The Japanese Garden in my opinion, has less features, but is more tranquil. I think the odds of finding more wildlife is higher in this garden."
,,Excellent and peaceful place!,5.0,,"We enjoy our time there indeed! The architecture of the garden is well designed and make you fell comfortable and with will to keep walking around there. Despite of was raining cats and dogs during we had been there, was a great experience!"
,,Green lagoon..lovely garden,5.0,,"Chinese and japanese garden is one place i have spent most of my time in singapore, its very close to my stay, so go as offen as possible..

Peaceful outdoor space for all age..built in jurong lake supporting many activities like tracks for jogging,cycling etc., Play area for kids, fishing decks,Birdwatching, karyaking or group boat ride etc., Vast space of greenery well maintained. Many species of animals and fishes can be found..Malayan lizard and some snakes are occasional sights in interior of the park in morning hours.

There are three parts one the outside parks with activities around the lake, next chinese garden, then japanese garden.
Chinese garden has a lovely entrance and has well maintained gardens around, koi ponds, turtle park, eco garden by local community, exclusive bonsai garden,fish pond feeding are some details to mention. No entrance fee for both the gardens, and remain open till late night. But turtle park has a special fee of $5 and bonsai garden closes by 5 or 5.30 pm.

Japanese garden is full of landscape and remote lonely peaceful place to enjoy solitude. Must visit place on a sunny day, if u love nature and peace.. :) Note: avoid sunday, as the place is getting overcrowded nowadays on sundays.."
,,PEACEFUL REFUGE,4.0,,"Chinese Garden also commonly known as Jurong Gardens, is a park in Jurong East, Singapore. Built in 1975, the 13.5-ha Garden was inspired by and built based on classical northern-Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscaping, specifically reminiscent of the Sung Dynasty period.
Today, the Chinese Garden continues to provide a peaceful refuge to nearby residents who go there for walks a midst landscaped grounds. It is a perfect venue for celebrations during festive periods such as Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. The bridges and pagodas also attract couples there for wedding photography shoots. Maybe it's nothing special for the locals, but it’s underrated for tourists which I find it rather rare. There are pagodas, statues, a pond and beautifully Chinese imperial style of architecture and landscaping. It's ideal for joggers and walkers or people who just want some peace and quiet. I re visited the park, because I wanted to absorb the nature and quietness. How great it was to be in a garden like this in a busy place like Singapore.
Well, you really have to be here in order understand what the scenery does to you.
There's also a Tortoise Museum. (Small entry fee), which you able to feed the wonderful creatures. Kids would like this kind of thing so take the little ones here if you can!
It's quite easy to get to .It is located next to Chinese Garden MRT Station and connected to the adjacent Japanese Garden by a bridge. Sometimes it is just nice to be in a tranquil place for just a day so if you find yourself in the West Coast area, just give this place a visit."
,,My favourite place,5.0,,"My favourite place, since I live nearby. Likes to go to the parks, all the way from Chinese Garden, Japanese Garden through Jurong park. Love it in the morning when the flowers are blooming. At times you got to see the squirrel, monkey and monitor lizards. Good for picnics. Beware of snakes are the green area toward Chinese garden from the Chinese garden mrt station. Bring mosquito patch if you are going into the live turtle/tortise museum. very unique place as the turtle and tortise are walking around you.

Hope there are lanterns next year as this year doesn't have. Quite disappointed."
,,Beautiful garden,4.0,,"I went here in the morning. It was quiet. Not many people. The Chinese Garden is beautiful. There's a pagoda - didn't go up though. There are many statues. Many elderly people go here to take a stroll. Only went for a quick stroll at the Chinese Garden, didn't go to the Japanese Garden since only going with my mom and there were suspicious-looking men."
,,Nice experience,5.0,,Beautiful architectural design. Clean and peaceful. Can even spend a day. One of the best places in Singapore to take pics.
,,"More than just a ""Garden""",5.0,,"A wide green color greet me when I step out from MRT station. I spend almost 7 hours walking around in this big garden. Not that big, but because it's beautiful and unique, so I spend almost all my time to taking picture around. The replica of the pagodas are beautiful, so does the bonzai gardens, and the multicolor trees and flowers. The architectures are great also, classic Chinese and Japanese garden, including the bamboo and waterfall. I also found a turtle museum and conservation. It's cute, when you walking around and some turtles passed near you or watching you. Becareful with their eggs!"
,,Nice and Clean,5.0,,"My son was so happy to see a few monitor lizards there in Chinese Garden. The place he like most is Live turtles museum, I suggest that the price of ticket should be offer for student, my son (11 yr old )had pay for an adult price for entry."
,,Some days...you just need to escape the rat race & get some air,4.0,,"Many locals remain unimpressed with these Chinese & Japanese Gardens but I enjoyed the simplistic leisure of sitting under the shade of a tree just to have a conversation. It felt great to see fields of grass where I could take off my shoes & loosen my tie while enjoying the cool afternoon wind with a sexy woman. Urban Singaporeans living in shoebox apartments understandably don’t see this appeal which shows you how distant people have now become from nature. The Gardens by the Bay & Supertree Grove are not similar types of places, you can’t relax with the same carefree leisure or lie on your back & sleep a lazy afternoon away in peace there, security will probably kick you out…how bizarre.

The Chinese Garden features the Main Arch Building, twin pagodas, a Suzhou-style pagoda-tower, a stone boat building overlooking a fish pond full of koi & Turtle Museum ($5 entry) but in many ways the Chinese half resembles more of a Chinese amusement park than a tranquil garden. The oriental style buildings with their curved roofs & Song Dynasty designs are 1970’s buildings, how about those cheap concrete statutes of the Chinese zodiac? The Chinese-half of the twin gardens seem kind of cheesy when compared to its Japanese neighbour. Crossing the stone bridge from the Chinese side to the quieter Japanese island reinforces the fact that the Japanese knew what they were doing here. There is a simple red wooden Shinto gate, some iconic Japanese stone lanterns & a bonsai/pebble garden amongst a quiet little pond. The red bridges are constructed out of wood, faithful of typical Japanese garden bridges & have a distinct pronounced curve making them very photogenic. If you take the time to notice, the garden is designed in a very subtle way that is calming & peaceful, it seems copping a few nuclear explosions taught the Japanese a humbling lesson.

Another good place to sit & watch the world go by is between the MRT station & just outside the gate where groups of migrant Indian workers gather to play cricket on the grass fields. It’s a good place to kick a ball around, throw a Frisbee or ask to have a bat. Like any other Sunday afternoon anywhere in Australia, I saw one guy bowl a bad ball & get hammered for 6. The next ball the batsman tried to do it again but got clean bowled, stumps & all, everyone cheered but the batsman protested he wasn’t ready he was scratching his nose…..we may all look different but we all use the same excuses anywhere in the world.

Originally known as the Jurong Gardens, the Chinese & Japanese Garden twin islands are located on Jurong Lake with a connecting pedestrian bridge linking one to the other. The gardens are free to enter including international guests. Visitors should refrain from climbing up on statues, stealing plants & urinating or defecating on the grass, notice how these signs are in Chinese?! The Japanese Gardens are closed at 7pm while the Chinese Gardens are open late until 11pm which has something to do with the Chinese inferiority complex, interestingly visible everywhere here. The Chinese Garden MRT (singular) is between Lakeside & Jurong East stations & is located on the Green line, designated E25 on the map about 40 mins from the city centre. Travelling via the MRT it cost less than $4 SGD & was within sight of the station. Much of the gardens is wheelchair friendly for the handicapped."
,,Wonderfully tranquil place,4.0,,"Had tried to visit here on previous visits but hadn't quite made it and we should have tried harder!

The people behind this place should be congratulated. The Chinese Gardens are wonderful, peaceful and very tranquil. The Japanese Gardens while still impressive gave the feel of still being developed.

If you have a few hours to spare in Sinapore and enjoy gardens, I would higly recommend a visit here."
,,Picturesque,4.0,,"Chinese Garden: lovely place to stroll around, taking in the beautiful architecture and statues. Walking to the top of the pagoda was a challenge...but great views! 180 steps.... So be warned! Loved the Garden of Abundance, and the Koi pond was pretty cool....never seen so many in one pond! As a previous reviewer said, the plants in the Bonsai Garden seemed quite neglected. However, I did live the Rock Bonsai... Not sure if you call them that....the waterfall ( which you can walk behind) , the lake and bridge made a stunning picture.

Japanese Garden: very peaceful. Stone Lantern Valley was beautiful. Photogenic lanterns, lakes, bridges.

Well worth a visit, but go early as it gets seriously hot! Also, take plenty of drinks and snacks/picnic.there are drinks machines....that only take coins. No food outlets. Sunscreen, a hat and bug repellent also a must."
,,Favorite Place in Singapore,5.0,,"In my opinion, this is the best garden site in Singapore, preferable to the Botanic Gardens and the nature reserves. It's a bit out of the way on the western side of the island, but it only takes about 15 minutes to get there via MRT from central Singapore. If you get off at the Chinese Gardens stations, it is about a 5 minute walk down a clear path to the gardens - you can see the gardens from the station. It has all sorts of neat Chinese and Japanese statues and sites, and the park surrounds a lake. There is a very tall Chinese pagoda that you can walk to the top off (180 steps, so be ready) - there is a great view of the city from the top. This is a very popular picnic spot; many people gather on the grass, but there are also a number of benches and sites where you can eat. It was very crowded around the entrance and in the Chinese garden on a Sunday, but I was able to escape from the crowds in the Japanese section, which is a slightly further walk. There are a couple of basic vendors at the gates to the site where you can purchase drinks and snacks - I don't recall seeing any food vendors selling meal food."
,,Peace of mind,5.0,,"The gardens are really a nice place to visit. Been there twice. Arrived from the MRT, the gardens are just less than 5mins walking. Visited the koi as well. Nothing much to say but I really enjoyed the time spent there. If you want to go for a picnic, the gardens should be on your list!"
,,City Shame,2.0,,"The Chinese Gardens are In poor condition,and the bonsai plants in need of a lot of care.

The gardens and buildings have clearly had little time for care and attention by experts in there fields,the plants have been let go and many plants are in dire need of a lot of attention.

This was to be a high point for my trip,i felt a deep disappointment for Singapore,for such a collection to be abused by the City.

Please Singapore save the gardens by getting a few Bonsai Masters in to rebuild the plants and builders to repair the buildings and other hard stand buildings."

,,Nice departure from the city,3.0,,"The gardens are easy to get to - you just walk off the MRT and you're there. It was a peaceful visit; the gardens are so large that it never felt ""busy"" when we were there. Lots of beautiful things to photograph. I especially enjoyed...More"

,,A nice peaceful amble,4.0,,"Very convenient to the MRT of the same name this is another nice place to touch base with greenery, wildlife and culture. The pagoda is definitely worth climbing for a great 360 view. We also popped into the turtle museum as we had 3 kids...More"
,,Far and meh...,2.0,,"Don't bother with the turtle ""sanctuary."" You may get depressed for 5$SGD Very sad place. People who dont want their turtle pets dump them at this place."

,,Serene,5.0,,Beautiful gardens that are well worth visiting. Very relaxing saunter around. We went on a very hot dry day so beware there is not a lot of shelter from the sun.
,,Lovely place away from the city,3.0,,Its a lovely place to spend the day away from the busy city. Lots of photo opportunity. We spent half a day over here. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes. Bring umbrella or wear a hat to shade you from the extreme heat from the sun.
,,One is better than the other,4.0,,The Chinese garden is a delight it is so peaceful and if you are a photographer then there is plenty of lovely things to take pictures of. The Tortoise and Turtle museum for a small fee is worth a visit. If you want to buy any drinks would suggest you do that here as the tea rooms which we expected to be open was all closed so that was very disappointing as was the drinks machine we came across that was not working. The Japanese garden was okay but certainly not as picturesque and still no vending machines or places to get drinks from. Take your own food if you are going to be there for a while.
,,best surprise of Singapore!,5.0,,"I was lucky to have been recommended to check this garden by a local friend. it wasn't initially in my list of to-see attractions in Singapore!
I would recommend to go there in the morning before the heat. It's a very calm place, with both chinese-inspired and japanese-inspired gardens. A lot of people were jogging on that day, I was just walking, taking my time, checking the pagodas, the different varieties of Tiare flowers...
A must see in Singapore!"
,,Beautiful garden,5.0,,"Beautiful garden with many types of flowering plants.

It also combines with chinese architecture resembling that of a garden in ancient china.

Great for a picnic. Best spot for picnic is around the lake in the center of the chinese garden.

Chinese gardens open till 11pm everyday but Japanese garden closes at 7pm.. Both gardens are connected by a bridge which closes at 7pm as well."
,,Beautiful Garden,5.0,,"This is certainly a beautiful place and a worthy place to waste your time away. Either you visit it with your friends, family or even your lover. It's quite with beautiful scenery and quite unique landmark but actually the original in Chine might be better (although I never see it myself).

The nice thing is you don't need to pay to enter the garden in which I believe is very rare in Singapore.

No need more introduction, set your bag, fill it with food and drink, enjoy the garden for couple of hours"
,,Peace and tranquility,5.0,,"These Gardens, easily reached on the east-west green line of the MRT (Chinese Garden stop) are free to visit. There is a Turtle Refuge in the Chinese section, which is a few dollars to visit and worth the money. It is possible to feed the turtles, many of which roam around the grounds.

The gardens themselves are beautiful, with my favourite being the Japanese section. The Bonsai garden is amazing, with some extremely old, well-grown specimens."
,,Well Worth The Trip,5.0,,"The Chinese Gardens were well worth it, but the Bonsai Gardens strole - stole the show, even tho' some of it was fenced off to the public - a cracking place to visit. As was the 'herb garden' allotments
The Chinese Gardens were well kept, but the Japanese Gardens were trimmed, but less well kept, with some of the water features void of water. But still worth the walk and the calming effect.
We found the gardens better than the Botanical Gardens, they were good too."
,,Beautiful park,5.0,,Beautiful park west of Singapore city. The Chinese garden has a pagoda from where you have a nice view. Furthermore there is a bonsai garden. You can easily go to the Chinese and Japanese Gardens by MRT and spend a couple of hours at this great place.
,,big park,4.0,,good view. can see pagoda like we was in china. suitable to do sport activity here and photography. far from the city center. it has the turtle museum also
,,Photographer's Haven!,5.0,,Awesome place to take a picture and run/jog/walk around. The nearest MRT is Lakeside/Chinese Garden MRT Stations. I suggest to visit this place in the morning as it gets very hot in the afternoon. There is vending machine for drinks at the entrance of the Chinese Garden - near to Lakeside MRT. Just beware of the big monitor lizards that may walk around the path specially when there is a change on the weather as they may tend to look for food. You can also see squirrels around. Well maintained. Highly recommended!
,,Little-known treasure,4.0,,"Few people in Singapore, let alone tourists, know what they are missing in this complex of open-air treasures: an oasis of peace in a busy city. Take the MRT (metro) and alight at the Chinese Garden station. Stroll along the pathways amidst its rolling greens dotted with ponds and traditional architectural unsullied by wrappers, plastic and other garbage (no food outlets here). Admire its Chinese and Japanese gardens. The bonsai garden is a must see: among its many 'exhibits' is a tree that is 350 years old. The high point of your visit will be the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, which has the largest such collection in the world. Don't miss it!"
,,Sylvan path at Lakeside,5.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese Gardens in Singapore are not only beautiful and rejuvenating, this picturesque lakeside locale by the MRT staion is a memorable destination not frequented by tourists. The rip-off rides at Sentosa, for instance, dull in comparison to the joy one experiences walking through landscaped gardens with resplendent pagodas. The Tortoise and Turtle Museum in these gardens is a delight, though it comes for a small fee. A must-visit"
,,"Beautiful, tranquil, extremely well designed and manicured",5.0,,"Having been fortunate enough to visit more than a few ""real"" Chinese and Japanese gardens, I had a fairly high bar to be impressed, but these gardens did it. Right smack in the middle of Singapore's Jurong area, the twin gardens are a wonderful walk in the park which is beautifully maintained and extremely authentic. I went with my four-year-old who loved the stroll, the bridges, the waters. I'm dreaming of bringing her back when she's 14. Absolutely amazing is the fact that it has a metro stop just meters away, so you really can't ask for more. The park was also amazingly fairly uncrowded on a Sunday, so I imagine you could have the place to yourself during the weekdays. Singapore usually does these types of things quite well, but this is exceptional - and, free. Highly recommended."
,,gardens soooo beautiful,4.0,,Has its own MRT station and its so beautiful. i love the section where all the recycled items are but its just all so pretty.
,,"Tranquility, serenely in a beautifully landscape garden",5.0,,"What a pleasant experience and treat to walk through these gardens. Very nicely landscaped with architecture of both China and Japan. The Bonsai garden is a must see. The Chinese Garden portion has a turtle museum with live turtles you can feed (be careful the turtles do not know fingers from food). They will come to you and follow you for food, available at 1 SGD for a small packet. Great activity for kids. There is a Pagoda with spectacular view of Singapore guarded by replicas of clay warriors. An unforgettable experience"
,,Amazing! Beautiful!!,5.0,,"If one is planning to visit Singapore, I highly recommend they come here, it was just beautiful. The best thing about it for me was the fact like the Botanical gardens, hardly anyone was there at the time I went, and it was so peaceful, so calm and relaxing as you stroll around being away from the congested urban areas. You get a great view of parts of the city if you climb to the top level of the 7 storey pagoda in the Chinese gardens. It is a must see attraction. One can take the metro to the attraction along the East west line, and it's nice little walk to the entrance of the gardens from the station. If you're willing to pay 5 dollars, you can go and feed turtles and see them walking around everywhere."
,,Great walk in beautiful park. Bonsai garder partially on renovation now.,5.0,,"We visited this parks on our way from Singapore Zoo. It is a beautiful and peacefull place. It is not modern and hi tech as Gardens by the Bay. Gardens feature chinese and japanise elements, there were not many people there when we visited. It was a beautiful place to relax. The bonsai garden is partly on renovation now, so it is not as beautiful as usually."
,,Beautiful and Peaceful,5.0,,"My husband and I took the MRT to go see the Gardens. We got the MRT from Somerset and its about 13 stops and one change over. It is sign posted on the MRT Chinese and Japanese Gardens.
Once you arrive you are dropped off right at the gardens. When you cross the bridge there is stands selling juice and snacks. We are glad we bought some juice as the tea house was closed. The gardens are beautiful and very quiet. My husband and I have been to see the Botanic Gardens and this is much nicer. I think because its so far out it attracts less visitors. I would go again."
,,prepare you leg!,4.0,,me and my best friend have been here and spend about 3-4 hours to walking around! ^^ love this garden.. have so many kind of trees and flower.. theme of japan and chinese is so cool! and creative garden is so interesting! ^^ but this park is so big! and japanese garden is so far from mrt station so if you want to go to there.. just prepare your leg haha
,,Peaceful sanctuary right in the middle of the city,5.0,,"Best of all, it's free entry except when there are special exhibition going on.

It's a mini chinese garden, not so grand, but at least it's very peaceful and you can just empty your mind and enjoy the greenert and peace. Located just beside the chinese garden Mrt, it's easily available. Give yourself 2 hours to tour both gardens."
,,Pop by if you're in the area,4.0,,"As I was in the west, I decided to have a look at the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Well worth it. Good place to escape if you want a change from busy Singapore streets. Very serene environment and beautiful looking gardens. Could easily spend a few hours exploring."
,,outdated gardens.,3.0,,"pls give this place a miss. the name sounds attractive but this place is mediocre compared to the grandness of the ""Gardens by the bay"" attraction. You have nothing to lose by giving this place a miss..."
,,peaceful place,4.0,,"if you want to runaway from a busy and crowded place you have come to the right place. The place is near the MRT station just go straight and ""Tadaaa"" you've found it. On the way to the garden you can find a huge field for you to play kite, soccer, baseball, etc. In the garden it self you can find turtle museum, lake (with turtle and fish swim or you can find a lizard swim in it) and if you have more energy, try to climb to the top of pagoda to see the beautiful scenery. Or you can have picnic with your family, friends or your beloved."
,,"If you've done all the tourist stuff, step into a local delight",5.0,,"In many previous visits to Singapore, I had ignored the Chinese Gardens. Faced with a blank Saturday afternoon in my diary and uncertain weather, I made a spur-of-the-moment decision to visit the Chinese Gardens. The name understates its attractiveness in several ways.

It's worth the thirty minutes on the MRT to come here - once at the station, it's an easy, signposted two-minute walk to the gardens. The name 'Gardens' fails to do it justice, since it is really a big and well-tended park on two islands in a complex of smaller and larger lakes. There is a tall pagoda with commanding views from the top and two smaller twin pagodas plus several other Chinese-style buildings which give the park its name.

There were three surprises for me.

First, was the abundance of wildlife in the park. No monkeys - which is a good thing as they are becoming a nuisance in other parts of Singapore. I have never seen so many large monitor lizards in one place before, together with a variety of big and small fish in the lakes. I saw some lovely birds, from long-legged cranes walking stiff-legged through the shallows to a dazzling electric-blue kingfisher winging over the water. A number of helpful signs offer information on all that can be seen in the area.

Second surprise was the turtle museum which contains a wide variety of tortoises and turtles. Despite the 'museum' name, they are all very much alive. Interesting for adults and amusing for children.

Finally, the best surprise for me was the Japanese Gardens next to the Chinese Gardens. They are less publicised, but provide a lovely, harmonious contrast to the Chinese version.

Larger than the Botanic Gardens but similar in character, this visit is for those who enjoy peaceful walks in lovely parks. Not too much for children to do except the turtles and renting a boat on the main lake."
,,Beautiful: a must-visit place,5.0,,The Chinese and Japanese gardens in Singapore are a must-visit places if you are a nature lover. The gardens are easily accessible with a MRT stop just in front of one of the garden entrances. And the good note is that entrance is FREE! The chinese garden is beautiful with my favorite view being the pagodas - so colorful amidst the greenery. The Japanese garden is as expected - very neat and well trimmed - walk around the bonsai garden and you will wonder how all the trees are so well trimmed!
,,A relaxing day,4.0,,"On a recent business trip to Singapore had a chance to spend a free afternoon at this wonderful spot in Singapore. I'm not usually one for gardens etc, but this was well worth the trip. There is no entrance fee to this large and beautifully maintained parkland (really too big to be called a garden). The water themed grounds are well laid out and are made up of the Chinese and the Japanese gardens. Both are full of interesting plants and trees (I guess you would expect that), and a wide variety of culturally themed pagodas, buildings, bridges, and places to just sit and relax. i recommend climbing the stairs to the top of the multi-storey pagoda (it has a proper name but it escapes right now) and I hope you do it easier than I did! I was there on a weekend and it was great to see not only tourists but family groups of Singaporeans picnicking under the trees and wandering through the various parts of the gardens. The gardens are easily accessible via the MRT. The journey is interesting also, with most of the trip being on the elevated line, giving you an aspect of 'suburban' Singapore you might not necessarily see as a tourist. Give yourself plenty of time to explore this great attraction."
,,Two gardens in one,4.0,,"Just a two minutes walk from the Chinese Gardens MRT station can be found a haven of peace and tranquillity. In fact it's two gardens in one as it also incorporates the Japanese Garden. The large well laid out gardens are surrounded by water, and within the grounds can be found ponds, streams, pagodas, statuary, ornamental bridges, and numerous bonsai trees. There were a number of older buildings near the large pagoda but these were surrounded by hoardings suggesting some form of renovation. The six story pagoda can be climbed via a sweeping internal staircase. During our visit there appeared to be more gardeners than visitors, but certainly worth a visit if visiting Singapore. The only refreshments seen were a drinks machine. Free admission if no events taking place."
,,Most beautiful place in Singapore,5.0,,"Normally this place has no entrance fee unless there is a festival or an exhibition there.
I found the place so stunning and peaceful.
It is a great get away but it also boasts the Chinese culture which you don't see so many places in Singapore.
I took a hundred photos, one nicer than the other.
In the lake you will see lots of small turtles and huge lizards (almost 1 meter long!)
Next time I will bring a picnic box with my family and just chill out the whole day.

There are clean toilets and kiosks where you can buy drinks etc."
,,"Nice scenery, quiet environment",4.0,,"I went during the Saturday afternoon nearing the lantern festival, and it is all quiet, until about 6 pm, the crowd is building up. Nice scenery, and clean also. For the Chinese Garden, usually free, but I paid S$12 to get in to see the dinosaur displays in the park. Not that expensive, but you get to see the lanterns lighted up at night, which is spectacular. For the Japanese Garden, admission is still free, but the park is much dirtier, there are many bird droppings on the benches, yet to be cleaned. I happen to see a wedding photo shooting session in the Japanese Garden. Japanese Garden is the quieter park."
,,Simply stunning,5.0,,"Wonderful park, with stunning views, which is beautifully lit after dark. Well worth the entrance fee. The highlight is the turtle museum - take cucumber to be extremely popular!"
,,Poetic taste of the past out of the beaten tracks,4.0,,"A must see garden out of the bitten tracks. Far from tourist main attractions and a bit expensive but worth the visit for old china, tranquillity and poetry lovers. The Gardens follow the style of several famous Chinese landmarks like Beijing and Suzhou. Interesting view on West Singapore from the top of the pagoda tower. Don’t miss the Tea pavilion and the Bonsai garden. A unique attraction is the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum, run by a passionate with an amazing display of everything related to turtles. Next to vibrant Chinese Garden you have the Japanese one, more dedicated to zen and minimalist architecture. Check before visiting as there can be renovation or events going on."
,,Chinese Garden,2.0,,"Was at the garden for the so called Mid Autumn Festival celebration.
Such a disappointment especially after paying for entrance fee.
Place looking dated. Just a small crowd was in the garden when i visited.
Not worth it if you'll paying to get into the garden."
,,beautiful but expensive,3.0,,"The gardens are beautifully maintained and the pagodas are magnificent but there is currently a set of large dinosaurs visiting and so the entry fee to get in was $12. Therefore despite the beauty and tranquility the gardens are not really worth paying $12 for despite the visiting dinosaurs, oh and they only open at 10.30am!"
,,Alternative spot beside botanical garden,5.0,,"The pictures aren't lying, the garden is a masterpiece! Really love the pagoda in the front of the garden, and if you take right way to the chinese garden, you'll see statues of great persons such as Guan Yu, Mulan, and Confusius. There is also another pagoda, The Twin Pagoda, a good spot for some photos. If you take to the left in front of the garden, you'll be on Japanese Garden with a beautiful white bridge. To go to the garden, simply take the MRT on the green line to Joo Koon until you reach the Chinese Garden station."
,,Lantern festival,1.0,,"As a Singaporean , I saw the advertisement for the lantern festival theme was Jurassic park and I thought maybe can pay a visit n have a look. But was disappointed.

Paid 12 bucks to go in. First sight ok a row of lanterns lining up the bridge . After that just some rubber dinosaur which looks dark at night . They do make sounds and move very very marginally. Other than nothing much. Most of the roads are dark n just lined with small red lantern. Nothing fanciful.

There supposed to be a performance at 8 pm but it started late n only few performers on stage.

Not worth the 12 bucks. Maybe max 2 bucks worth."
,,Chinese Garden temporary closed in preparation for Lantern Festival,4.0,,Singapore's Chinese Garden is closed from 26 August 2013 to 26 Sept 2013 in preparation for Lantern Festival.
,,the most beautiful garden in singapore,5.0,,"This splendid garden is very easy to approach by MRT (metro). It is a huge manicured gardens, with pagodas, statues, trees, squirels, fishes, tourtous, bridges, a small bonsai garden - opened until 17:00 - and a Live Turtle and Tortoise museum - open until 18:00. The garden is very tranquil and peaceful, with very few visitors. It is a very pleasant place for a long stroll in the afternoon. We enjoyed a lot the Live Turtle and Tortoise museum , which has very special cretures and you can also feed some of them - a total new experience. The turtles have pink little mouth and they are very keen to eat the green beans.
All in total - a delightful time and visit, far from the malls and crowd you have in all the other Singaporean attractions."
,,Lovely Gardens,4.0,,"Caught the MTR from Singapore City, to Chinese Gardens Station. Garden entrance, free, is within view of the station. There is a shop selling drinks and it is advisable to ensure you are hydrated. It was very hot and humid. It really was a pleasure to walk around these gardens, with great opportunities for photographs. There are iconic Chinese images, from pagodas, buildings, statues to Bonsai Trees. Very enjoyable excursion from the city."
,,A great park,4.0,,"Firstly, it is important to note that we only visited the Chinese Garden. The heat was so intense that we decided to head for home rather than bear the Japanese Garden aswell

The Chinese garden is very scenic. Many pagodas and statues to look at, aswell as a koi pond. The Turtle museum is also based here which I have reviewed separately. Aside that, there is not really much to say, this is just a park. A very nice, very scenic park, but ultimately, just a park"
,,Garden lovers will be impressed,5.0,,"Take the approximately half hour ride on the MRT out of the CBD and into the distance to visit these lovely co located sympathetically and authentically planned gardens. Enjoy a people free few hours wandering amongst immaculately tended meadows, paths, trees and garden beds, together with pagodas, summer houses, ornate bridges, bonsai, squirrels, statuary, ponds and manicured lawns. If you plan to climb the 226 steps (yes, I counted) to the top of the seven level pagoda at the entrance, do so first, because you will cover several kilometres to thoroughly check out both gardens. The view from the top is lovely, and in the distance you will see the skyscrapers of Singapore, popping up over a green border. No maps are available so look carefully at the information board at the gate to work out which garden you wish to see first. Go left if you choose the Japanese garden.

Entry is free, however there is a world class tortoise and turtle collection in the Chinese garden which charges a small fee. I've never been particularly interested in them but this excellent private display changed my mind and there is a lot of variety in the amphibian world - some of these guys can bite a finger off without even trying. They are curious creatures and nearly all sidled over to me and we met eye to eye as I passed their tanks. It was lunch time for them and they were checking me out as much as I was looking at them. It was also deserted so I received a personal tour of the highlights by the friendly attendant. You can buy some food to toss in the water to witness a feeding frenzy.

Take your time to linger around the elegant summer house built over the water and don't be startled by a sudden splash. It will be one of the truly giant water dragons living around and under the boardwalk and you will see them sunning themselves in the shallows and on rocks nearby. There is beauty at every turn - something flowering, massive rocks with orange lichen, rough barked magnificent groves of trees, shrubs of different colours, grasses, water features and too much to mention. Of course the garden is also a delight for bird watchers.

Cross a long bridge to enter the Japanese garden and you will notice the garden design change immediately. I found it pleasant and it is perhaps not as old or expansive as the Chinese garden.
My only criticism is that it seemed as if there were too many things crammed together - e.g. way too much park furniture, bridges too close together, dreadful bollard lighting placed insensitively right beside attractive stone lanterns, and too many ugly rubbish bins placed in spots to ruin the view and ""line"" of the otherwise elegant scenery.

Rest rooms were clean and unexpectedly well appointed. Upon exiting I enjoyed a nice conversation with the pleasant Indonesian attendant who kindly held my umbrella to shade me while I wrote some feedback. If you are not in a hurry on your return journey, consider exiting the MRT at Chinatown and make it a thoroughly oriental day. Tip: take some food with you because none is available in the gardens."
,,perfect for a little walk,4.0,,"I visited this garden by morning (i think this is the best time to take a walk in the garden). the sky was so clear, the sun shine and warm. we take a lot of good photo in there. it so easy to reach this place. you can go by a MRT and also there is no fee when entrance the garden."
,,I loved it!,5.0,,"The best thing about this place is that it can't hardly be packed with tourists because it's really huge. After Co timeout bumping I to strangers on the street of Singapore, you can come here to have as much space of your own as you want.
No admission fee.
I saw many locals come here to do exercises.
The Chinese garden is very beautiful and the whole place is very photogenic, you just can't stop taking photos.
Ask for a ride after finishing sightseeing the whole place. They have electric rides from MET Chinese Garden gate to the other side and vice versa. Just hail any ride passing by you and ask very nicely for a ride. If there's anything I learned about people here in Singapore, it's that they are not friendly or helpful and they're just as cold as ice. Even if sometimes I ask them to do something that is supposedly their job, I always do it in a way that looks like I am asking for a favor. Otherwise, they'll immediately show attitude.
However, all and all, if you have re, come here, if you don't have time, don't worry, you won't seriously miss anything. The place is quite far. From city center (say ... Orchard) you ride North South line and drop off at Jurong East to transfer to East West line, then get off at Chinese garden which is only one station away from Jurong East, walk your way to the gardens."
,,for lovers,5.0,,"perfect hangout for lovers . the place is clean but when we went there, it was raining hard so we didn't get to enjoy the scenes. try to visit the turtle museum."
,,"A recent visit to the Chinese Garden, Singapore",4.0,,"This beautiful garden is about 40 years old. It is a good place to take a morning walk or an evening walk. It is too hot to walk in the garden at noon. You will come across monitor lizards and tree lizards (Calotes versicolor). There are statues of Confucius, Yue Fei and Hua Mulan and some of the heroes of Chinese mythology. There are some beautiful pagodas in this nature park. Dr Goh Keng Swee, the late Deputy Prime Minister was instrumental in setting up this garden.

You can view my video on You Tube with the title ""The Pagodas of Chinese Garden"" by the author hengcc."
,,"Beautiful Garden, easy to reach!",5.0,,"Last week, i went to Singapore and i visited this garden. Very easy to go here, just take MRT to Chinese Garden (green line, EW25). I love the aroma of this garden, smell like tea or something, i don't know. Both chinese garden and japanese garden are very beautiful. Chinese garden opening hours: 6am - 11pm, Japanese garden opening hours: 6am-7pm. There is no entry fee here. I highly recommended this place to visit if you want something peacefull, green and nature."
,,Spend your weekend at chinese garden,4.0,,"Singapore have many comfort place for spending your weekend. one of them is chinese japaneses garden. This is the miniatur garden in china and japan.

I visited this place from chinese garden, in the left side. You can find many statue in this area. you can find your statue zodiac and chinese gate.

But in the japanese garden, you can see japanese temple with japanese gate. This is great view in here.

Many people run and spend time in the weekend to visit this place. And you must bring mineral water since the garden is big and you must prepate good stamina to look around this place."
,,"peaceful, serene, beautiful",4.0,,"Little outside of the city, but what a gem. Both the Chinese and the Japanese gardens are very pretty, well done and give you a great sense of peace and harmony."
,,Got to do it!,5.0,,"Fantastic place.easy to get to on mrt. Also the mrt trip gives you a great sense of the real singapore. It's a two minute walk to entrance. My children loved it and we saw two huge lizards just walking across footpath which made their day.

It is so tranquil and no one seems to go there - well not tourist buses anyway!"
,,Garden,3.0,,"Nice, relaxing place to be on a sunny sunday morning! Stroll through the park and enjoy the clean and bright surrounding."
,,Picturesque and relaxing.,4.0,,"Went for a quick visit, unfortunately, we didn't give ourselves enough time to explore and enjoy. Our first impression was of well laid out gardens in the Chinese and Japanese style. We thought they were superb and were sorry we couldn't have spent longer. They were very tranquil and relaxing, yet in the formal style the Chinese and Japenese are renowned for. We wil go back again with sufficient time to do them justice. If you like tranquil yet fascinating gardens then they are well worth a visit. A totally different experience to the Botanical Gardens which were more in keeping with Singapore."
,,Nice to visit but fair distance from the central city,3.0,,If you feel like escaping the city and wandering around some nice gardens then this is a good place however the you can get better at the Botanical gardens which are much closer to the CBD
,,Interesting with lots of History,4.0,,"These Gardens are full of History and are kept beautifully, a credit to all those involved. Singapore you should be proud."
,,super,5.0,,The Chinese and Japanese gardens are one of my favorite places in Singapore. It is an amazing place to just walk around and see the beauty of Mother Nature.
,,A little peace away from the maddening crowd,5.0,,"These are well planned gardens with wide, sealed walking paths. The gardens cover a large area and although they are popular it is possible to find a quite spot for a picnic, relaxing or admiring your surrounds. The lakes are full of carp and there are many water birds to be seen.

Entry to the garden is free. Within the Chinese Garden is a small turtle and tortoise sanctuary. Entry fee is $5.00. Some of the tortoises roam freely around the garden. You can buy a bag of tortoise food for $1.00 and feed the animals in the ponds. A great activity for young children.

Although there are many vending machines around the park selling cans of soft drink and bottled water I did not see and cafes or vendors selling food other than ice-cream.

The parks are very easy to get to as the entrance is directly outside the Chinese Gardens MRT station."
,,Do not waste time for oversea tourists,3.0,,"It is more suitable for local people to hanging around. Nothing special in the garden only with a pond with fresh air. Suitable for family with kids like me to spend a weekend with them, picnic or jogging.

For oversea tourists i would suggest to visit Botanic Garden instead."
,,Wasted potential,3.0,,"There are no so many parks of such size in Singapore and this one could very well be the ""botanic gardens of the west"". However, nothing really seems to make it attractive, particularly the Japanese gardens section which is old-fashioned (tyres used as flower pots, large unappealing paths) and offer virtually no attractions to children, In land scarce Singapore, it is really a pity that the potential of these gardens be left unattended."
,,Peace & tranquility - well mostly,4.0,,"If you take the MRT,get off at Lakeside. It is a fairly short walk along Jurong lake (and if you look carefully, you see a number of small animals such as squirrels. The bonsai garden is definitely worth a visit - pity that a large part of it is not accessible. Climb to the top of the high-rise pagoda for a nice view of the gardens and surrounding area. The more wooded areas are really nice & quiet. I found a number of people who insisted on playing music at high volume on their cell-phones, something I find extremely rude. Would I go back? Yes, it is a nice place to visit. Take water though - it is HOT (there is at least a shop at the tortoise museum if you forget)"
,,not bad for free :),3.0,,"I went to the gardens on the MRT. I live quite a way away on the east coast. If I lived in the city I would use this facility again as it was lovely and peaceful there. Not too many people. Everything freshly painted and well kept gardens and lake. Only downside was nowhere to sit and buy a cold drink. If you go definitely take plenty of water, there are plenty of toilets there. Try and go at the cooler part of the day.I visited the turtle sanctuary but it upset me that there were so many crammed into a small place in concrete boxes."
,,A Hidden Gem,4.0,,"Easy to get to. A short walk from Chinese Garden MRT on EW line.
Peaceful, tranquil and much to see, including main pagoda and the lake. Japanese Bansai garden inside is ok, but be aware it closes at 5pm.
I found the Chinese historical figure statues and engraved stories very interesting.
Easy access and was $5 to enter when I went.
When you want a break - this is a pleasant 2-3 hour interlude. I was surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this."
,,Good for walk,3.0,,"A peaceful garden in Jurong. Very quite and calm, not many visitor there. Clean. May bring your own food or drinks as there isn't food stall or restaurant in the garden. May spend a weekend with family or friends."
,,Take a break,4.0,,"Once you have been to Little India, China Town and numerous other places where there are hordes of people you can take a break in this garden. It is easily accessible on the rail - just a 5 minute walk. This garden is not overcrowded and the plants are lovely. There is also a tortoise sanctuary where you can see many varied kinds of tortoises, some very interesting and some quite scary. Well worth a visit."
,,Avoid going on the weekend,2.0,,"Firstly, nothing impressive when compared to many other places around. Avoid going there on weekends or public holidays, you will see huge number of construction workers, definitely irritates when they keep staring at us. I will never think of going there again!"
,,An ordinary garden,2.0,,There is nothing to impress me .The only strong point about the place is that it has a lake and located quite near the MRT.
,,Clean and Green,4.0,,"Singapore's signature - clean and green. Lots of nice sceneries and greenery. Calm and relaxing place. Benches available to rest too. Nothing much to buy though, so it suits a lot for travellers who prefer to enjoy quiet time and photography. Walking around lots of greenery in itself is probably relaxing enough. Enjoy the serenity and tranquility!!!!!!!!!!! Don't forget to drink lots of water in Singapore's usual hot weather too."
,,Well worth visit,5.0,,A must visit in Singapore. Acres of beautiful gardens well kept as everything in Singapore...and free entry. Just a short walk from transport Make sure you take bottle water as it gets very warm. But plenty of places to have a rest lovely bonsai garden and plenty water with fish and turtles.
,,Potential but underwhelming,3.0,,"Singapore has so many beautifully kept parks and gardens. The Botanic Gardens is the crown jewel, but there are numerous others dotted throughout the city including Fort Canning Park, Bishan Park, East Coast Park and so on. As a center for surrounding residents to exercise in green surroundings, the Chinese and Japanese are fine but as a destination they just don't excite the visitor. The so called attractions, such as the tortoise house and the pagodas are OK, but I got the impression that the so called 'attractions' are almost afterthoughts. The potential for a fascinating cultural experience such as is implied in the titles of the gardens is immense. It is not attained."
,,Chinese garden,4.0,,"I've been to this garden, feeling wonderful and relaxing weekend. This place really attractive for picnics because the fresh air and beautiful scenery."
,,Garden and Nature Walks,4.0,,Both of these gardens have unique styles and provide a nice dose of nature. Monkeys and monitor lizards included free of charge.
,,Photo Shooting,3.0,,"If you want to find a place to practise on photo shooting, Chinese / Japanese Garden will be a good location. It is free enterance for everyone and we will be able to go there exercising, walking or dating. It is also good for a family outing like picnic. Just if during raining day, it will be more troublesome."
,,Quiet and beautiful place,4.0,,"There are many beautiful scene that I could captured with my camera! :D
It was a great experience for me and my sister

If you really like a quiet place, I really recommend this place
I went there in July 2011, and It was quiet not so many people :)

Just take the green line and get out at Chinese Garden MRT,
the garden is right in front of the MRT :D"
,,Peaceful time,5.0,,"We went to early arrived at about 10am the gardens were open but nothing going on. The sculptures excellent craftsmanship the gardens are very clean however the big lake could do with a clean. Make sure you have a look at the Turtle & Tortoise Museum small donation to get in, make sure that you buy some of the food to feed the Turtle & Tortoise great for the kids (watch your fingers)"
,,Peaceful like heaven,5.0,,I really love the atmosphere and the design there! Very peaceful! The variety of turtles and the stones are great to watch too!
,,Visited once and that's it..,1.0,,I would rather go to the real countries. Went there and its a ghost town. Go spend time at other touristy spot coz this place is a total waste of time.
,,Not free very often,1.0,,"This recommended attaction was my worst experience in Singapore, which I loved overall. There was some kind of Lantern Festival and they charged 12 singapore dollars per person admmission. It was not worth anywhere near that amount. Nobody was there it was empty! I wonder why? The bridge to the Japanese Garrdens was closed. The Food court was a joke. It was dirty as was most of the gardens. I couldn't wait to get out.

What a contrast to the Botanic Gardens and The Gardens in the Bay (New) both of which were superb."
,,nothing much there,3.0,,There is nothing much there except for some antique buildings and a turtle pond for you to feed the turtles. More for those who love to take pictures of architectures
,,Expensive and not much to see,3.0,,"While I have no complaints with the gardens themselves, it is just not enough value for money. If you go on a holiday, you'll realize that even amidst such tranquil surroundings, tranquility is missing!"
,,Peace and quiet,4.0,,"The gardens are easy to reach from MRT Chinese Garden, they are quiet and peaceful and easy on the eyes. You can't buy anything to eat there (yet), but you are able to buy drinks and you can go for a bite to eat more or less oposite Chinese Garden MRT. There will be new developments around Jurong Lake in the near future, so it might be a good idea to come soon, as the Jurong Park itself is nice for a walk."
,,It's FREE,4.0,,"It just a free entru park ( if there were no festival there) You can walk around this park with a great view of chinese and japanese view,such as pagoda, bonsai, the lake, zodiac garden, koi pond,etc"
,,"A Very Relaxing Place, Peaceful and Beautiful",4.0,,The Chinese Gardens and Japanese Gardens is handily right next to the Chinese Gardens MRT (those clever Singaporeans). The grounds are very well kept and if you are lucky you will see monitor lizards and turtles around the water. The Bonzai garden is really interesting although there is a lot of refurbishment being done to some of the buildings in that area. The turtle and tortoise museum is disappointing just because of the very plain and small enclosures. It could be done so much better - I guess that would take rather a lot of money though. We also saw a big sea eagle floating around above. It's a very nice place to visit if you want a quieter day away from the shops etc and take a camera it's worth it.
,,Serene,5.0,,"If you need some peace and quiet, if you need a check into reality, if you need to hear nothing but your breathing and the nature. GO to the Chinese and Japanese gardens. Carry water, a sketching book and stationary and/or a book and unwind. For free. You can sit in the Garden of abundance by the water body or sit by the Lilly pond in the Japanese Gardens.You can just sit there and think.I found it beautiful. Relief from the humdrum.HIGHLY recommended. Clean, beautifully manicured area."
,,"Quiet, Tranquil And Well-Landscaped Gardens",4.0,,"The Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden is one large Singapore Attraction that also includes other smaller attractions, such as The Live Turtle And Tortoise Museum. Due to its location in the west of Singapore, away from the main tourist areas, the Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden tend to be quieter and less crowded. Which is a shame, because it's really beautiful.

There are actually 2 great time slots to visit the Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden. The first time slot ranges from 6am - 10am, when the cool morning mist still hangs in the air. It almost feels like you're on a mountain top, with the morning dew still wet on the grass. Plus the sun isn't too hot yet. If you visit during this timing, walk around the gardens first, as some of the attractions might not be open yet.

The second time slot ranges from 3pm - 7pm. Just before sunset, when it's cooler, and all the attractions at the Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden are still open. The reason it's best to visit during this 2 time slots is because the majority of the Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden is open air, and the afternoon sun can be harsh. Furthermore, there isn't any proper food for sale here, only tidbits and drinks, so you'll have to lunch elsewhere.

What I liked best about the Chinese Garden is the view from the 7 Storey Pagoda, and the Twin Pagodas. Well worth the effort to climb to the top! Also worth a look is the Bonsai Garden, the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia. Do try exploring the different pebbled paths around the Chinese Garden, as I find that they were constructed to give visitors different views of an attraction. For example, walking the many paths of the Garden Of Abundance will give you different views of the 7 Storey Pagoda and Bridge Of Double Beauty from various angles.

The Japanese Garden is more zen like in nature. Don't miss viewing the Japanese Guest House & Mini Garden, with its landscaped lawns and ponds. Or the unique Stone Lantern Valley, with its own little stream.

While The Live Turtle And Tortoise Museum is advertised as a star attraction of the Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden, it didn't really appeal to me. While their collection is really large and varied, it was quite sad seeing how some of their animals were kept.

If you're planning to visit, do note that while general admission is free, tickets for The Live Turtle And Tortoise Museum cost $5. Also, do note the different opening hours for the more specialized attractions. Wear a good pair of walking shoes, and bring drinking water, as drinks here are slightly pricey ($1.70 per can)!"
,,love it so much!,4.0,,"i always love to go to this garden. everytime i have trip to Singapore, i always go to here. :D"
,,Beautiful!,4.0,,"The Chinese/Japanese gardens are open from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m. according to the website I found, although I think the Japanese Garden's signboard said only until 9 p.m. Best to go during the early morning or late afternoon as it gets very hot if it's sunny. There are several seats and a few shaded gazebos to sit and rest (or even have a picnic). Bring plenty of water or money to buy drinks/snacks at the entrance or certain rest spots. Also bring sunblock, sunglasses etc.

It's easy to get to the Chinese Gardens, just alight at the Chinese Gardens MRT on the East-West line, and follow the path there. You can have a look at the park's layout at the entrance and decide which way to go first (although you'll eventually come full circle!). A bridge links the Chinese and Japanese gardens. It's beautifully designed and laid out, with different attractions such as pagodas, statues, koi, bonsai and turtles/tortoises. You have to pay $5 to see the turtle museum (open 9 a.m. to 6 a.m.), though. Some tourists were feeding the fish in the Japanese garden with bread, although I'm not sure whether they brought the bread or it was provided (possibly for a fee).

It's definitely worthwhile to visit this place!"
,,a perfect hideaway,4.0,,"If you were bored with the hectic orchard road and wanna find a hideway, I absolutely recomend this place. it's so accessible, just alight in chinese garden station with MRT and you'll find a path which is surrounded by meadows leading to the park. So peace and quite.
I sugest you to come early morning, because when the sun gets high, there will be so hot.
You can do jogging and take a photo shoot here. The scenery is so beautiful, with the pagoda, lampions, bridge, lake, and chinese statues. Don't forget to bring camera, sun block, sunglasses and umbrella."
,,Worth visiting,5.0,,I enjoyed my visit here very much. The gardens are easily accessible by MRT and free. The grounds are very well maintained and both gardens are nicely designed. There were very few tourists when I visited. I also recommend visiting the turtle museum within the Chinese garden ($5 admission fee for museum). I think this would be enjoyable for kids as well.
,,Peace.,4.0,,Beatiful and peaceful to walk around. if a hot day take a sun brolly for shade.
,,Its nothing like you expect to find in Singapore,5.0,,"Worth a visit, its a short train ride from the city, alight at Chinese Garden station (East West line, going towards Joo Koon). Beautiful place to spend a few hours wandering around, away from the high rises of the city."
,,Not a bad place for photoshoot,3.0,,"When come to Chinese and Japanese garden, remember to bring along coins and also your camera. Singapore is a humid country, sometimes when it get hot and you need to quench your thirst. There are vending machines around the park. There are some ice cream vendors at the entrances of the park.

The park have a lot of beautiful flowers and also jogging track. So, look out for the runners during evening. Other than that, this park is nearby Chinese garden MRT and Lakeside MRT. Now, there's a lakeside park which is just around the West entrance of Chinese Garden, so do drop by there if you got the time. There's no entrance fees during normal days however, you will have to pay during festive seasons such as Chinese New Year and Mid-autumn festival."
,,windy and relaxing,5.0,,Went there to walk and jog. Its a place that you can really relax and enjoy the greengage. The best of is this is a quite place and really can enjoy with your family time.
,,Easily obtainable peace and quiet,4.0,,"Some reviews will tell you that the Chinese and Japanese Gardens aren't so wonderful compared to the Botanic Gardens. I think that's a fair criticism, but on the other hand it takes a lot longer to get to the Botanic Gardens. Yes, there is an MRT, but you're right up the end of the line and it's a huge slog back. The Chinese Garden stop is not so far from the middle of town on the East-West line.

I've also read a review saying you'll get the same thing in Chinatown. Since Chinatown is a crowded, noisy urban environment and the Chinese and Japanese Gardens are a quiet, spacious park, I'm not sure what aspect they have in common. They both have 'China' in their names, perhaps?

There certainly isn't as much to see as at the Botanic Gardens; it's a smaller area, and there isn't as much variety of flora. Still, there are some pretty bridges and ponds, as well as the towering pagoda. Supposedly there's some hornbills, although we only saw mynah birds as we walked around. The Chinese gardens have some cute zodiac animals (a bit *too* cute for me, I have to say - I prefer the more classical ones in the park in the Kowloon Walled City site in Hong Kong, although that's not a realistic alternative if you're in Singapore unless you fancy 4 hours travel on a plane) and the paths around the park are well laid out. Plus, it doesn't seem to have as many people in it as the Botanic Gardens.

Hence, you have a couple of choices: want to see some beautiful plants, and don't mind a long journey? Go to the Botanic Gardens. Just want some peace and quiet, and don't want to spend an interminable time on public transport? The Chinese (and Japanese) Gardens it is."
,,Serene and charming,4.0,,The gardens makes a great place for a good stroll and the view is fantastic. Those who loves landscape photography would love this place. The facts that it is just a step away from the MRT and free are definitely a bonus. It is best to go early in the morning or wait for late afternoon/sunset as noon sun can be merciless. Take time to chat with the friendly guard at the entrance and he will tell you a bit about the garden. Enjoy your day.
,,Beautiful,3.0,,Just beautiful to take a nice walk or run... very good spot for panoramic photografy. Best Regards
,,Nice place to refreshing with family,4.0,,"this garden was very easy to go to. just use MRT (EW line /green line) and alight directly in front of the garden. when the sky is clear, it is very hot but the view is great especially if you like to visit culture site. At the chinese garden it has few statues of famous and inspirational character like hua mulan, konfusius, etc. it has pagoda and twin temple near by the Jurong lake. you can visit the turtle museum and bonsai garden too. it has a pond of 'koi' fish and others pond that's quite relaxing. if you're interested with gardens, then this is a must visit place. but it is quite difficult to find snacks or meals inside the garden. but there are a lot of place that sold snacks at the chinese garden mrt station inside the garden it self there are lots of drinks vending machine. my journey there with mrt from city hall takes about 20minutes. too bad i didn't have a time to visit the japanese garden. so i can put any pictures of japanese garden. when i went there in last march, there were a competition at the lake. dragon boat competition i think, so my friend and i take a rest under the trees and watch the competition."
,,Can see this type of gardens any where!,3.0,,"Too far from town, nothing special. Can get the same experience from going to China Town or yet go to Botanics Garden or Orchids Garden to see exotic orchids."
,,Beautiful and peaceful - a feast for birds lovers and nature photographers,4.0,,"if asked about a good park in Singapore, most people will direct you to the Botanic gardens. Yes, this is a nice park but the chinese and Japanese gardens, far less popular, are a real hidden gem. Beautiful gardens well maintained and offering classic Chinese and Japanese architecture and garden designs. There are lovely spots to picnic, a fish pond to occupy the kids, a (sad ) turtle museum where kids can feed turtoises, and a multitude of beautiful spots where one just wants to see and observe the wild life: beautiful dragon flies, fish, turtles, amazing birds which local nature lovers and photographers will show you in you come on a week day. Very easy access from ""chinese garden"" MRT station (green line), direct 2 minutes walk through a field from the station. free access and the chinese gardens are open from 7am to 11pm."
,,Hidden Gem,5.0,,"interestingly the Chinese Garden & Japanese Garden is peaceful and quite unlike the other attractions in Singapore. Not many people know about this hidden gem. It takes about 1/2 a day including the travel time by MRT.
I like the greens, ponds, bonsai garden and pagoda."
,,Bonsai Garden is Not to Miss,4.0,,"The setting of the Chinese garden around Jurong Lake is nice for a stroll. There is also a Japanese garden on another island in the lake. The best attraction is the Suzhou style Bonsai Garden. Though the general garden is open until 11PM, don't wait too late as the Bonsai garden closes much earlier. The bonsai trees are of course great, but the setting is great and the key-hole doorways and the lattice work in the windows create great ""Frames"" for viewing them."
,,Pleasant,3.0,,"I was there with a friend for street photography and we had quite a number of interesting snaps! The park/garden is quite a nice place to jog! The field in front of the garden allows cricket playing and kite flying :) The pagoda view is nice too! The garden has all the 12 cute zodiac sign statues as well as a collection of bonsai! I like that the park has the chinesey elements but in the midst of a city! Easy to get there as well, just walk out of Chinese Garden MRT (green line) and you will see the garden! :) try the ice cream at the vendor as well! Durian or Mango flavor is rather nice!"
,,A little bit of Peace and Quite.,5.0,,"Both these gardens are next to each other so you can see them in a few hours. The MRT has a Station right at the entrance to the Chinese part. The gardens are Beautifully kept, with Bonsai's , Koi ponds etc. Its very Peaceful if you have a couple of hours to spare, and the Best part is....Its FREE. Its will only cost you a Train ride for the CBD approx $3."
,,Relax,3.0,,Its just a simple garden Chinese pagoda and a single bridge foreigners who want a little taste of china may visit but it's more for reading relaxing and photos session so not to expect anything interesting
,,Interesting,4.0,,The Japanese & Chinese Gardens are located next to each other and landscape is nice. I like the bonsai trees and the 7 story pagoda. The lake replicates Nakamura temple gardens.
,,Greenish...green,5.0,,Ever Green Scenary .... & pagoda view for the skyline
,,A beautiful and peaceful place!,5.0,,"The Chinese and Japanese Gardens in Singapore are beautiful and very tranquil places, with few tourists, located farther afield. The gardens are separated by a nice and scenic bridge, and both are fantastic. If you begin by the Japanese Garden entrance, you will see carefully conserved and ornamental plants, many different kinds of bridges, a beautiful lake with birds and some kiosks, where you can rest and think about the life. When you cross the bridge to the Chinese side, the change is obvious. A lovely pagoda appears in front of you (and there are two more) and you can see a chinese zodiac garden with the 12 animals stone carved. Many statues of ancient famous warriors, navigators and other important chinese figures stand nearby, with a nice statue of Confucius. Be prepared to walk a lot, but it's a fantastic site to relax and it really worth the visit."
,,"worth going, specially during lantern shows",4.0,,"A nicely maintained place very near to the mrt but still quite serene. Very good for walking around and different themes are there, i liked specially the bon sai at Japanese garden and the chinese Zodiac in the chinese garden."
,,A journey worth taking...,5.0,,I travelled out of the city to the Chinese Gardens and it was one of my favourite weekends here in SG. The MRT (tube) travelled above ground most of the way so it was a great way to see more of the city. Apart from the Pagoda's there is not much else to see at the Chinese gardens apart from wander around the beautiful gardens and take in some nature. The pagoda's are breathtaking and so is climbing them - but there are some great views when you reach the top. It is well worth a visit to just see the amazing turtles in the turtle sanctuary.
,,What a great contrast of two different backgrounds & architecture,5.0,,"This place I saved for the final day before departing Singapore although I kind of wish I had done it perhaps a different day. Why? It was sooo humid and I was sweating very heavily throughout my time here. However, I enjoyed the gardens very very much and although the heat was strong, I braved it and kind of took my time viewing all the different pagodas, bridges, walkways, and everything else in between. Ended up taking some great pictures though and the architecture for both the Chinese and Japanese Gardens was spectacular.
I really loved all the Chinese pagodas and the lily ponds from the Japanese sanctuary. Also, there are a huge variety of Bonsai trees carefully manicured in this particular pavilion.

To get here simply jump on the green line and by a ticket for ""way out west"" and the MRT stop is simply called Chinese Garden so it's very easy to get to and I think took about thirty minutes to get to roughly from the city center. Once you get off the station, just go down to the ground floor and then follow the walkway out as you will see the big Chinese pagoda from the MRT station
All in all, a great place to go and visit..(minus the high humidity when I was there:)"
,,nothing much to do and see,2.0,,"as the title said, it has nothing much to do and see here. a very huge park, but disappointed as is is just and ordinary with some chinese setting and a huge pagoda. probably best for jogging but not tourism spot."
,,Something affordable in an expensive city!,5.0,,"What I loved most about the Chinese Gardens is the way they maintain the area. Everything is just so lush and the place is extremely cared for! When we visited the place, it was drizzling quite a bit so I was really surprised that there was an absence of mosquitoes (Park staff were spraying pesticides on bushes to keep mosquitoes at bay). I was also amazed by the sculptures and Chinese buildings around the place. Another good area to check out within the Chinese Gardens would be the Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum. For $5 SG you get to see different types of turtles and tortoises. An additional $2 SG will get you some veggies for turtles and tortoises you are allowed to feed. It may cost quite a bit for some but do keep in mind that the fee goes to helping these turtles and tortoises :)"
,,"Good, free rest in a busy city",4.0,,"If you have a spare hour or two and want to get away from the hustle and bustle, I recommend these gardens. Easy to access from the MRT, they provide a great look into Asian gardens, from bonsai to fragrance to standard chinese. The pagodas and statues of Confucius and other Chinese heroes provide plenty of photo ops, especially some nice juxtapositions of ancient Asia with modern skyscrapers. Don't expect the botanical gardens or major orchids - just a nice solid park. Plenty of fish in the ponds, so bring some leftovers with you to toss in.

It's free to get in, so I don't know why some other reviewers talk about paying. Wasn't interested in the live turtle Exhibit so didn't pay to enter."
,,7 story pagoda had closed.,4.0,,"Before you will get off Chinese Town MRT you will see Pagoda from window.
Just down the walkway and you are there. Sadly 7 Story Pagoda and one of Twin Pagoda were closed. Maintenance? Note on the door but didn't say when will open again.
Still nice place to relax and walk around garden.
Bonsai garden is under renovation so front gate had locked. Go around back to enter.
Beautiful collections.
I had spend all day and enjoyed."
,,"Tranquil gardens, but avoid the disturbing turtle place.",3.0,,"A breeze to get to on the excellent MRT.
A short walk straight down the path away from Chinese Gardens Station and you're there.
A few stalls for light drinks on the outskirts of the gardens and a few (mainly closed) cafes inside the grounds. The Japanese gardens were open on our visit and very tranquil, as were the Chinese gardens and its Pagoda.
A few good views to see across the lakes and some good photo chances so camera at the ready if you go.
If you need an afternoon off the shopping and need a quiet place to unwind you may want to visit.
But, the Turtle place in the middle of the gardens was disturbing for us.
Not a very pleasant place if you go by western values on animal welfare. Maybe this is how animals are treat in Singapore? I won't go into detail but just be aware if you go in (we went in to shelter from a shower).
On the whole we liked the gardens and enjoyed the visit but would probably not go back for a second look around."
,,Be very careful!,2.0,,"Chinese gardens sounds tranquil and serene right?
Now imagine a building site with the leftovers of a huge wedding party from the night before and very loud crap medleys of Western dance music in a Chinese style.
Imagine all cafes and sources of refreshment are closed and it is 1pm
Imagine paying 12 bucks (6 quid) for the privilege.

Oh and the Japanese gardens are closed To the public.

None of this was advised on the web site or before entry.

Come on Singapore. You can do better than this.

In short if you are going either call or ask at the gate what us available inside before handing over cash. Better still go to the Botanic Gardens which are lovely"
,,Great Place but not for female solo traveler,4.0,,"My friend and I visited these two gardens last June. It is so easy to get there by MRT. I fell in love with these gardens as they are the real concept of Chinese and Japanese gardening art. They have traditional features of Chinese and Japanese architecture with unique design and splendid architectural beauty!
We took 4 hours to walk around and enjoy the different atmosphere of Singapore here.

Be ready to bring drink or food in case as all the restaurants there were closed when we were there.
I don't recommend these gardens for a female or single traveler.
We had an annoying experience there. My female friend and I were pestered by some horrible men who pretended to walk around behind us but actually observed and watched us suspiciously. There are some policemen in Japanese garden but not in Chinese garden. Report or alert the authoritative staff there as soon as you feel annoyed.

But there are good and bad people everywhere. Don't let them stop you enjoying time in Singapore...It's a great place to visit!"
,,"Dont visit the live turtle/tortoise museum, it is a discrace",4.0,,"The park itsself is lovely but the turtle/turtle museum is discracefull. Those poor creatures are in filfy conditons, in horrible enclosers with nothing to do and so many are just crammed in on top of one another."
,,See it while you can,5.0,,"My wife and I visited the Garden on a rainy afternoon last December, when it was practically deserted. Extremely easy to get to via MRT. Bring your camera, you can't take a bad shot here. Visually stunning, amazing variety of plants, beautiful pen-jing display. Sadly, all the wood pillars which support the roofs of the pavilions and walkways have been eaten away by termites and will all need to be replaced very soon. The largest and most beautiful classical garden outside China."
