,,"Well worth a visit, great for kids!",5.0,,"Beautiful building housing a great gallery. Admission price differs, depending on the exhibitions that are on at the time, so check the website. Great for kids, there is a kids section on level one (free entry), and there are often additional exhibitions that are suitable for kids. Allow enough time to explore all of the levels and both wings, and make sure you head up to the rooftop garden for a great view.

Have had bad experiences with the retail shop on level 1, but that's nothing to do with the gallery itself."
,,Beautiful works of Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art,5.0,,"It is important to know that the National Gallery Singapore doesn't sell itself as a mediocre art gallery, but shows the finest works of Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art. I honestly spent more time in the UOB Southeast Asian Galleries as it presents a holistic development of the rich history of Southeast Asian art throughout the ages. This is much better than seeing Disneyland! I ended visiting the museum three times before I had to leave back for Manila. Will definitely return soon!"
,,Colonial building,5.0,,It was a merger of 2 colonial buildings namely the supreme court and the city hall. The building is now home to beautiful art pieces. Nice place to spend an afternoon
,,Beautiful place,5.0,,The national gallery in Singapore is anexample how to wisely use old buildings and transform them into modern architectural master pieces. There are free tours available . Beautiful art pieces.
,,Excellent collection,5.0,,"The collection of paintings here is particularly good in illuminating the history of Singapore, its colonial past, and republican present as well as its connections to other parts of the globe"
,,Supporting local artists,4.0,,"Turning the old Supreme Court and the city hall into this national gallery, the building itself is already an art piece witnessing the history of the country.
Came here because of the awakening of Asia arts between 1960-1990.
There’s also a roof garden on 6/F.
Entrance was for free since it was an open day (lucky!)"
,,Museum,4.0,,More than 8000 artistic works of South Asian art is present here. Beautiful architectural building. Gallery includes city hall & former supreme Court of Singapore
,,Beautiful,5.0,,The national gallery in Singapore is a fine example how to wisely use old buildings and transform and merge them into modern architectural master pieces. Free tours. Cinema inside. Cafe. Kind staff. Art at its best
,,For of the gallery,5.0,,Beautifully restored parliament house and supreme Court buildings from the British colonial days of Singapore. Fine local paintings from south East Asia adorn the spacious halls. Its best to have a free guide to show you around.
,,Supreme Court,5.0,,"This is where the Singaporean hosts it Supreme Court. It was interesting to have such a building so open to the public and tourists. I found the galleries well kept and the exhibits modeled well for review. If you are a lover of art and like to take awhile to review a piece, I recommend at least 3 hours to view it all. I did it in two because I was rushed and got to see 3 out of the 6 floors.

It is worth the price as the architecture in the buildings is almost as enjoyable as the art in the exhibits."
,,Singapore History With Dessert,4.0,,"Museum has a very impressive display outlining Singapore's history, focusing largely upon political movements prior to the Japanese invasion, and the invasion itself, which cannot help but raise questions about how the British failed to protect one of its own colonies. Much of what Lee Kuan Yew, who became Singapore's Prime Minister following the Japanese surrender, said did echoes very much Singapore's post incursion and determination to create a nation of independence. What is displayed in this museum provides very clear evidence of this history.
An absolutely delightful added attraction in the museum is a gallery (open only at certain times), which features an emphasis on forest conservation. The display also includes an unquestionably beautiful sensory experience within the ""Glass Rotunda""."
,,Must visited destination,5.0,,"At the first place, I thought I could not make it but then 12 hours before my flight I still came here and spent nearly 2 hours here to know more about singaporean art"
,,Loved the watercolours,4.0,,Good mix of traditional and modern material to please all tastes. We were fortunate to see an excellent collection of watercolour paintings.
,,Wonderful adaptive reuse of two stately colonial buildings,5.0,,A beautiful space and impressive array of exhibitions. You will need at least half a day here to see everything.
,,Sarah the star !,5.0,,We decided upon a new guided tour around the Awakenings exhibition. Our guide was Sarah and she was fabulous !! So much info at her fingertips and delivered in a really engaging way. The best hour plus we’ve spent at the gallery. We went on a Wednesday at 1pm and only 5 in our group. Great.
,,Cool in more ways than one,4.0,,"Called in for some respite from the heat, only to go to the Ng Teng Fong Roof Garden Commission. Hot and humid, but peaceful area. Worth a visit. Features plants from reclamation areas etc."
,,National Gallery,5.0,,"Beautiful conserved building. Vibrant and dynamic featured collections, valuable permanent collections, edgy events, and probably the most progressively inclusive art space in Singapore for persons with disability and specific needs. Counter staff and security are very friendly and helpful. An all round amazing experience highly recommended!"
,,Children's Bienniale,4.0,,"Very easy to get to from the MRT at City Hall. A few minutes walk past the beautiful St Andrews cathedral.
Housed in the massive marble environs of dual wings spanning an entire block.
Well staffed by paid staff and helpful volunteers.
Interesting exhibitions for primary school children. ""Every World""by Donna Ong was my accompanying 6 year olds favourite. Plenty of hands on exhibits and creative activities to take part in.
Recommended for children 4-7."
,,Reflective and thoughtful exhibitions,5.0,,"The exhibitions are housed in two beautiful adjoining buildings, the more impressive of which is the former Supreme Court. While some other reviewers have asserted the exhibitions may be political, I find it ironic that they ignore that the artists were simply expressing their own artistic perspectives on an era of immense change across Asia. The gallery assistants are knowledgeable and courteous and there is an excellent use of space and atmosphere to display a varied amount of media and styles. This is well worth a visit - preferably with an open mind and it is excellent value for S$30 (including the special exhibitions). Singaporean residents are free and other travellers (eg Singapore Airlines passengers) receive a discount."
,,Amazing architecture and displays!,4.0,,"We had some extra time on our hands so made an unscheduled visit to the National Gallery. So glad we did. The way they have preserved the buildings is incredible, with some added modern touches. The art on display is so varied and has such important culture heritage for SE Asia."
,,A fast visit,5.0,,We wished we'd visited earlier as the buildings are so impressive being the former Supreme Court and City Halls. Amazing exhibits and the old Court dock and cells were enjoyable
,,Lim Cheng Hoe Watercolour Paintings of Singapore,4.0,,"Though oil pastel impressionist paintings r my personal preference, I appreciate how the artist was constrained by costs to use watercolour instead. Even in the lower cost watercolour medium, first, I was able to emotionally associated with the familiar places the artist painted; places iconic to me as I have grown up in my home Singapore! Second, I appreciated the artist's abilities to extract different details for focus in each painting. He painted the same scene varying its time period or weather or colour or light-shadow or vertical-horizontal orientation. For instance, in his painting of Fullerton Building, he depicted a hot and busy morning crowded w officer workers seeking breakfast before work, with bright red, orange and yellow colours. In a contrasting painting of the same scene, the tree faded into the painting as he wanted us to focus on the groomy sky depicting rain was imminent. I am amazed how observant he was down to minute details as he so skilfully differed his perspectives by choosing which details to bring forth for his audience's attention!"
,,Disappointing art collection,2.0,,"The building and art spaces at the gallery are quite lovely but the collection of art was disappointing for a National Gallery. There is a lot of historical memorabilia more suited to a museum or library that did not interest us at all. There was quite a lot of political poor quality painting with slogans and political agenda material on them. It all seemed quite anti-American. We finally found some actual art which was quite nice but nothing that would blow your socks off. There were a couple of galleries of weird abstract 3D ""art"" pieces that most people would hesitate to call art. I am an artist myself so I don't mind the unusual, abstract or different but there was little to inspire here. Much room for improvement."
,,A Must See,5.0,,"This is a must see. The old city hall building and The old Supreme Court.

Price we took the general admission and the awakenings,cost $30.00 per adult and concession $25.00 per adult.

Well worth it.

The old city hall building is galleries and exhibitions and the old Supreme Court is galleries and the old Supreme Court.

Some very interesting documents and furniture. This is a must see.

Guides every where and they will explain every thing.

Well done."
,,Architectural Traet with beautiful Art,5.0,,"The Old Supreme Court & Town Hall have been preserved, conjoined keeping its architecture & historical importance intact. The external façade is same, interiors done carefully giving a glimpse of yester year as well as creating space for art exhibition by Singapore artists. The free conducted tour guide explained all the features and important aspects of the building - History & architecture. Subsequently, we saw the art galleries where the attendants explained nuances, should you be so inclined. A must for all travellers to Singapore. It offers concessions in admission charges if you are a Sr. Citizen and for some other categories too."
,,Educational,4.0,,I really enjoyed my visit here. I found it very educational. The staff were accommodating and helpful
,,Children Biennale,5.0,,"The place gave me an inexplicable sense of exhilaration, i don't know why all the years the NDP National Day Parade is always held at the Marina Bay Float and not at the Padang in front of NGS"
,,"nice architecture, lousy art",1.0,,"Went here looking forward to seeing some cool modern art. There was no international collection and the local stuff was not very inspiring. I guess more of local interest than interesting as art. Lovely building though, and very helpful staff. I think there were some great kid oriented displays"
,,Great!,5.0,,"very big, so take your time. Be sure to make a reservation in the cocktail bar on the roof for a well-deserved cocktail after your visit!"
,,the best museum in Singapore,5.0,,"I came here with my wife.She love the museum very much.
The $380 million project involved the creation of a soaring roof canopy to link the two buildings, held up by tree-like columns. Its perforated aluminum panels play off the city-state’s relentless sunshine, casting dappled shade inside while allowing the exterior to shimmer.
Will come again!"
,,A good collection of art,3.0,,I spent about four hours. My 9 year old daughter enjoyed in the kid's section by doing her own block painting. Be prepared to walk a bit to cover everything. Many sections were closed. Everything is very well maintained as everything in Singapore. I loved the social table. Some sections were bit abstract and kids will not enjoy. Please follow the map to avoid confusion.
,,One of the best museums in Singapore,5.0,,"I love this museum - it's somewhere I could go during the day and just explore without a lot of people around. The Singapore history exhibit is fabulous, really giving you a sense of how Singapore evolved over the past few hundred years. Don't miss the Story of the Forest - it's gorgeous!!"
,,Complaint,1.0,,"I came to ask for the gallery explorer (no matter Chinese or English, which is fine for us)with my husband after buying the entrance tickets at around 330pm. But the service auntie refused me, said the Chinese guide has finished today!!!But what we saw the two Singaporean visitors came after us just asked her for register easily to have the English guide. And then we asked for another service people for the guide, she just let us to register to follow the English guide which was going to start at 330!
I hate the short hair auntie!!!!why? And even I am pregnant now."
,,Excellent Art,5.0,,"The National Gallery is amazing. The building was the former Supreme Court of Singapore, so you can see the beautiful building with its original tiled floors. Also, the air conditioning is the best (especially on a hot day)! It just happened that there was an exhibition of a Chinese artist, Wu Guanzhong. It was well curated, with a good range of his art throughout his career. I would highly recommend visiting this art gallery."
,,Worth the visit,5.0,,"As everything in Singapore, very organized and clean. They do have beautiful works of art, very ample, and on the day we visited it was free, even the tablet they let you have while visiting. Nice, don't miss ii"
,,Lovely building. Some great paintings.,5.0,,Found the work of Georgette Chen. Unknown artist to me but she had such skill and talent displayed here through a number of her paintings including a couple of self portraits.
,,Great way to spend half a day here,5.0,,"If you are into history and arts of Singapore and Asia, this is a not a place to miss. Walking leisurely and read through the narratives of each art piece in a cooling, cosy place is the main draw."
,,Impressive,5.0,,Some of the most important works of art that defined Singapore and the rest of Southeast Asia are housed here. A must-visit place whenever you are in the Lion City.
,,Allow a lot of time,5.0,,"The buildings themselves are historic (one was the Supreme court) and you can learn a lot about Singapore's history. I saw the Minimalist exhibit, I'm not a fan of minimalism, but it was a well done exibition that covered many floors and had me going back and forth across the bridges that connect the buildings."
,,Fascinating range of exhibits,5.0,,"We were very lucky to attend on one of the days where all of the exhibitions were open for free (part of some festival) otherwise as tourists we would've had to pay and I don't think we would've spent the money to go in.

First of all, the gallery is situated in the most incredible building. A mix of colonial and modern Singapore, it's very open and grand. The layout is a little confusing at first but with a map it's easy enough to navigate.

The best bit for us was the, sadly temporary, 'Minimalism - Space, Light, Object' series of exhibitions. It's only open until the 14th April 2019 so if you have the opportunity get in fast and go and visit! There's really weird and wonderful exhibitions that make use of very modern lights and objects to really interesting effects.

The rest of the gallery houses a range of artwork dating back to really early Singapore, this is much more classical art in a variety of styles. Interesting to have an explore of what is around."
,,Impressive architecture,4.0,,"The building is a great combination of old and modern architecture. Different exhibitions, although more modern art selections. Very interesting to catch a glimpse of old Singapore (architectural history, paintings showing pre-war Singapore etc.). Museum shop as an interesting selection of art books. Great place to escape the heat."
,,Free English Language Tour - 1 Hour - Don't miss the exhibitions,5.0,,"There's a lot to see on each floor - especially Singapore's early history, art and modern paintings. Free 1 hour English language tour - take the time to do it."
,,Excellent Art Gallery,5.0,,There is so much to see here that we need to return to complete! The Singapore's National Gallery is definitely worth visiting - recommend half a day then returning as you want to take your time and enjoy the many different beautifully curated exhibitions. The building is stunning too and with great views out towards the cricket grounds opposite.
,,Not that impressed,3.0,,Massive building combination but nothing really inspired us. Taxi rank man was useless so we walked out onto the main drag.
,,Stop by to see the building if nothing else,5.0,,"Built from the old parliament and supreme court buildings, which were joined and expanded with glass roof and walls. The effect is beautiful. No charge to enter the building and walk around. Charge if you want to see the exhibits. Several very nice restaurants. TIP: The restaurants are far nicer than I typically expect in a museum, we felt rather under dressed in walking around touring attire. Smoke & Mirrors (the bar on the roof) had a great view and service."
,,"Good collection of Asian artists, neat and no queue",4.0,,"If you are more than 60 years old, you get ‘concession entrance fee’ wuth discount. There is toilet on every floor.
Total of 5 floors with very clearly delineated floor plans (brochures). Do take your time as there are a lot of work from local artists as well as collectibles from during colonial era and eyc.
If you wanna take your time then you could spend the whole day starting from 1st floor. When tired or hungry, take the lift to the 5th floor where they you can have a good enjoyable lunch and proceed. If you think the 5th floor is a bit too ‘posh’ looking, head up to the top floor (roof area) where they serve ‘set lunch’ consisting of mainly salad selection and sadwiches."
,,"Fabulous building, too!",5.0,,"I had a very enjoyable few hours wandering around these beautiful buildings, with very helpful staff, looking at the treasures. Worth a visit."
,,Nice repurposed building,5.0,,I personally find the galleries a little boring but the building and architecture is very interesting. Pair this visit up with a reservation at Odette.
,,Art,4.0,,Good place to see local culture and their art. Visited on Singapore bus trip and where impressed. Nice cool place
,,Tiem well spent,4.0,,Great facility. Outstanding artwork. If not a Singaporean its expensive. I took in both the standard gallery as well as paid extra to see the Minimalists exhibition. Really well done.
,,Enjoyable Museum,5.0,,"National gallery singapore is aesthetically pleasant, There’s a lot of exhibition It’s easy to buy or redeem the ticket If you bring lots of shopping bags, you can simply put it at the locker that cost just S$1.00 The staff and assistant also very helpful"
,,Fantastic Building and Exhibits,5.0,,Housed in the old Supreme Court Building (and retaining some holding cells as crowd pleasers) the gallery also contains many restaurants - at least one Michelin-starred. But the real star is the fantastic Asian art on display (and the Modernist Exhibition if it's still on)
,,A quiet place in Singapore!,5.0,,The former Supreme Court wing and the City Hall wing are big old buildings converted to be a modern multipurpose gallery and museum complex. Old and new art! Take your time here!!
,,An Exceptional Gallery,5.0,,"We spent half a day here and din't really scratch the surface.Architecturally , the buildings and their connecting atrium by Norman Foster are striking. The regular collections are excellent with interesting early local art. We were also fortunate to see the current special exhibition - Minimalist - which was fantastic. There are also some sensational restaurants housed in the Gallery - try the National .Definitely worth a visit."
,,A really interesting place to visit,5.0,,"Spent several hours in the Gallery as there was so much to see and do. Lots of air conditioning rooms show collections from Asia and on the whole are rather informative about life and history.

The Minimalist sections were less interesting to us and most folk but this is only part of a large collection"
,,Really enjoyed this museum,5.0,,"We visited the National Gallery recently and even though we’re not big museum goers, we greatly enjoyed this visit.

The architecture of the museum is really interesting, preserving the restored city hall and Supreme Court buildings and connecting them in very unique and interesting manner. The exhibit rooms in the Supreme Court building, incorporating some of the Court furnishings are very unique. The artwork on regular display showing art from the region is a very good collection and nicely presented. The special exhibit on through Sep 2019 - Wu Guanzhong: Expressions of Pen & Palette - was a favourite of ours.

Museum staff were very helpful."
,,The only downside of my visit to Singapore,2.0,,I might have been wrongly informed. And my expectation was different from what the gallery actually holds as art reliques. All is nevertheless very well conserved.
,,Worth the effort of queuing for entry.,5.0,,"Initial impression wasn't great, with a huge queue of people waiting for 2 reception staff to sell them tickets. One woman took about 10 minutes to buy her tickets and then returned for a second bout of negotiations. When we reached the front of the queue, I found out why it took so long - there were a bewildering variety of ticketing options and we took a few minutes of negotiation before being guided to the best option. Once inside, the vast building - or, really, 2 buildings - isn't the easiest place to navigate, but the staff were fairly helpful. Once we actually got to see some art, we were impresses. Less so by the Minimalism exhibition (Minimalism isn't my kind of thing, especially if it consists of a few planks of wood), but some of the other galleries were excellent, notably the work of Lim Cheng Hoe. The gallery focuses on South-East Asian art, which keeps its relevance to the region and some of the dramatic history of the area. Nicely air conditioned too so a good option on a hot day."
,,Lots of Cool Places to Discover (some are free),5.0,,"Found this amazing space during a free walking tour. Normally not an art person, so was going to give this place a miss. was amazed by the historical significance of the building. we even got some beautiful panoramic shots from the ""hidden"" rooftop. shoutout to indie singapore for letting us discover the cool spots. There is a free gallery about the architecture of the building and a 3d walkthrough that is a must visit for history/architecture buffs"
,,Great gallery space,5.0,,Saw the minimalist exhibition which was fabulous but didn't have time for the rest of this beautiful and impressive building so cannot comment further.
,,Good Museum,4.0,,"Probably the largest museum in Singapore, you need about 4 hours if you want to visit it all, with all the diffferent exhibits and the main collection."
,,Beautiful facility synchronizing classic and modern architecture,5.0,,"This magnificent building is a must see in Singapore. The art works are amazing, the touring exhibits are interesting and the facility is world class."
,,Amazing building,4.0,,Very spectacular conversion of law courts and town hall into an art gallery. Exhibition by Wu was well worth it. Check out the bar on 6th floor for spectacular views of Marina Bay Sands and the cricket club.
,,Our Favorite Art Venue!!,5.0,,"Besides its permanent collections of local, Chinese, and Southeast Asia art, it always has great monumental special exhibitions, sourced across the globe. Easily spending 3 or more hours here. Great facility, converted old supreme court. Nice restaurants and cafes. Open house, free on Sunday. Do not miss!"
,,Fabulous & mostly free,5.0,,Saw some of the best art installations. Wonderful to wander the gallery with engaging and helpful assistance at each exhibition
,,"A very ""COOL"", Exquisite Gallery!!",5.0,,"This Art Gallery, the largest public collection of ""Singaporean and South East Asian Art"" is relatively new. It is located in 2 ""Historic Buildings""-- the former City Hall and Supreme Court and occupies almost 16 areas of space. In addition to its ""permanent collection"", there are also travelling exhibits which will also excite one's appreciation of works of ""ART""... The Gallery also has a ""Centre for Art Education"" ( which like the 2 main exhibits, is sponsored by local companies)-- which is meant to assist schools and families increase their appreciation of Art. In addition to the extensive collection, the Gallery also has a wonderful restaurant as well as an enjoyable ""Gift Shoppe"". It has been awarded TripAdvisor's ""Travellers' Choice"" designation. For most of January and early February, 2019 entrance is free!

I hope that this Review has been helpful."
,,Exceeded expectations,5.0,,"We are not well familiar with Asian artists and massive collection and the building itself were the eye opener. Few real marvels, bronzes we fell in love with and we only wish we had more time and energy to explore."
,,WONDERFUL BUILDINGS GREAT EXHIBITION,5.0,,"If you like art and old buildings this is a place to must visit. If you just want to escape the heat for a while and have a quiet coffee then this a worth the visit.
The gallery is in fact two old buildings, one being the former Supreme Court, joined together by a modern atrium.
Various art and exhibitions are there for viewing plus the fact they have retained some of the old aspects as museums, ie the domed library, a court room etc
If you are over (I think 65)you get a discount on admission and if flying Singapore Airlines you also get a discount
I enjoyed my time there very much!"
,,"Tried to do it quickly in an hour, but it was so cool I had to spend 2",5.0,,"Loved this museum. They had the Minimalism special exhibit which totally made it for me. From the eerie acapella performance art that resonated throughout the building while you’re looking at art, to political modern art from SE Asia, to traditional watercolor style depicting the modern world...this place had lots of stuff I had not seen in person before. Always glad to be exposed to new art...very cool place to visit!"
,,An interesting Art Museum showing rare masterpieces of Claude Monet and other Impressionists,4.0,,"I expected less from this museum, but was impressed to see loaned masterpieces from European galleries, like d'Orsay. At time of our visit (March 2018) there was a special exhibition, showing masterpieces from Monet, Renoir, Juan Luna and others. The building itself is a spectacular, Neoclassical in style, but too large for the pieces of art i offers. An hour is enough to take at look at the most prominent pictures."
,,Not worth the entrance fees for foreigners.,2.0,,"The exhibitions are in my opinion sparse, while it is a large space it took me 30-45mins to finish everything. I feel the fees for foreigners do not justify this. It is a relaxing place though to get away from the afternoon heat."
,,Great museum,5.0,,I loved my visit to this museum. It’s an amazing building with very good exhibitions. All the staff were super helpful and friendly!
,,Singapore has excellent museums - this new museum is wonderful,5.0,,"We always stop in Singapore for a few days at the beginning and at the end of our Asian trips. For the museums, the architecture, the food....
The National Gallery is an architectural beauty. The free guided introductory tours are excellent. The exhibitions are beautiful, well conceived, beautifully lit, spacious and comfortable. It is always a joy to visit Singapore museums."
,,"Get lost for an afternoon in art, architecture and history",5.0,,Singapore's National Art Gallery does not disappoint. A pass will get you into most general exhibits and it is a great place to explore on a blazing hot day.
,,Not just art. Big on architecture and history too!,5.0,,"What used to be the high court and the city hall have become a beautiful art gallery, and more.

I love how the two buildings have been merged with a modern touch while preserving so many historical features. One should not miss a demo of an old court room as well as a holding bay for those pending trials. Artefacts discovered during structural works to combine the buildings are also on display, which give a good glimpse of Singapore's past.

Children can enjoy the air-conditioned space and there is a room for them to colour or do art if they get tired of walking.

Many good choices of restaurants but some require advance booking. A drink on the top floor facing the Padang (open field, the idea of which again dates back to the colonial era) early evening is a superb way to unwind and enjoy open views of modern Singapore."
,,Worth to visit,4.0,,"We may have travelled back and forth to Singapore for meetings or other occasions but missed out visiting museums. Finally we did find time to visit NGS and spent a couple hours exploring all the exhibitions. Worth to visit indeed!! There is this Minimalism exhibition which really makes us think of human creativity and amazed at the artwork created.

Singapore does have a lot of places worth to visit aside from shopping. Spend a couple hours from each of your visit!"
,,Stunning overview of South East Asian Art,5.0,,"After the visit in this historic building which is linked with the constitutional court building you will definitely have a much broader view and knowledge about South-East Asian Art and Artists. Was there several times. The rooftop coffee is overpriced, but the view is stunning."
,,An amazing piece of architecture and history,5.0,,"Two architects, one working on a project 'stitching' two older buildings together couldn't miss a trip to the National Gallery. It was a wonderful facility, beautifully done, and we couldn't help but smile when a guide easily picked us for a couple of architects and offered some comments we wouldn't have thought of."
,,Must visit!,5.0,,"The buildings - former City Hall and Supreme Court — ar already worth visiting, not th mention the collection of Singapore and Asian art within them. There is a solid collection of Singapre artists’ works. Look out for those by Liu Kang, Georgette Chen and Ong Kim Seng. After your visit you can eat at the fine restaurants and eateries in the buildings - Jaan (2 Michelin stars), National Kitchen by Violet Oon (Singaporean food) Aura (you can have drinks on the rooftop) and Yan (Chinese cuisine)."
,,World Class Art museum,5.0,,Very nice museum which shows off fantastic art from the region. I can highly recommend a trip here if you have any intrest in art.
,,Great Exhibitions but Treatment of Foreigners Appalling,1.0,,"This gallery has always put on fantastic exhibitions, no argument, but it's treatment of foreigners is steadily getting worse. If we have to pay slightly more, that's understandable. If we have to pay more but receive less (no general admission), then that is simply appalling. When Singapore is generally so friendly to foreigners what makes this gallery so exceptionally different?"
,,"Good architecture, ok art",4.0,,"The National gallery used to be the supreme court and city hall, and now both buildings are combined into the NG. The internal architecture is stunning. The 2 restaurants odette and national kitchen are very good. The art not to my taste"
,,Fabulous building with some interesting exhibits,5.0,,"Loved this place.
The building is fabulous and full of history, especially the old Supreme Court. We paid to see the minimalist exhibition which was different and some of it was very good but you probably need a better appreciation of modern art than I have to enjoy all of it.
Loved the exhibitions of South East Asian Art though, so precise and delicate.
We had lunch here in the cafe by the shop and it was tasty and well presented.
We spent a very pleasant few hours here and I would recommend a visit."
,,My favourite place,5.0,,"This is a MUST for anyone visiting Singapore. (1) the buildings are full of character and steeped in history beautifully restored. Not to miss - the Supreme Court Terrace, a lovely area great for photos; the Chief Justice's Chamber and adjoining Gallery which still resembles a courtroom with judge's bench and witness stand and of course the holding cells on the ground floor. Two separate buildings (the Supreme Court and City Hall) now integrated via the basement and on the ground level the 'veil'. (2) Through the artworks acquire an understanding of life in South East Asia. Two paintings in the gallery are featured on the back of the Singapore $50 note. Ask the staff which. (3) The restaurants are fantastic. From The National Kitchen, to Yan, or Aura. Even the little cafe at Gallery & Co serves up excellent food. Oh and the Courtyard Cafe is cheap and good too.

To make the best of your visit download the Gallery Explorer app from Apple Store or Google Play store. It helps you plan your visit before, serves as your guide during and is your memory keeper after, of your visit."
,,Simply fabulous,5.0,,"My husband and I spent the whole day at the Gallery. Not only does it have great art but you can join in on incredible free presentations. In the morning, we took a tour which explained the architecture of the Gallery, how it came about, what the buildings were originally intended for and how they were now used. Afterward we visited the special exhibition on Minimalism before getting a tour on South-East Asian art. We learned so much! The guides were enthusiastic, knew their subject and engaged easily with the visitors. We cannot recommend it enough."
,,Remembering past times,4.0,,We came here to relive my fathers role of standing on guard duty on the stairs during part of the official surrender of Singapore by the Japanese. We had be here 5 years ago but at that time the stairs were fenced off for renovation work. Singapore is really good at undertaking renovations and keeping everywhere in top shape. There is so much inside now it is the National Gallery. There are interactive displays as well as so much art on display we did not make the most of our visit but we achieved our purpose.
,,Former court,5.0,,"National gallery was also a former court of justice. 1800 colonial building which there are so many in Singapore. Once the union Jack would fly over these buildings. Not now of course Singapore is a proud young country but still part of the commonwealth. A favourite place of the Queen.
Beautiful building with pictures about the royalty, particularly Victoria. Also pictures of battles and Singapore hero's. Worth walking round.
I always marvel at these white airy building being so cool long before air conditioning."
,,Friendly staff and beautiful architecture,5.0,,"Worth visiting with centralized location and easily accessible via public transport or taxi. Staff are super friendly and engaging, and talks to u about the exhibitions going on. Do feel free to ask anything from them."
,,I love this place,5.0,,"I do not know. Probably it is the building. Probably it is the collection. Or maybe how they manage to arrange the collection in the spaces available. Visiting this place always gives me a content feeling afterwards. I come here a couple of times a year. Normally when they have new exhibits displayed. This time I was there for the Minimalism exhibition. I love the pieces they have in level 3. They basically force us to use all of our senses to participate in the experiences. In normal days, I would sit in front of Raden Saleh’s Forest Fire until the attendant looking at me awkwardly. If you are with kids, they would also like it here as there are several area especially designated for kids."
,,great for a rainy day,4.0,,"During a short visit with my wife to singapore we visited this museum, we spent about 2 hours here while it was raining outside. apart from the art collection the museum also offers a great introduction to the history of singapore and the past colonial era."
,,"Beautiful, clean place for art lovers",5.0,,"Came here one afternoon, the staff are friendly and professional. The place is clean, beautiful and the art pieces a delight to view. Would come again!"
,,Wu Guanzhong and,4.0,,"We visited the exhibitions of Wu Guanzhong: Expressions of Pen & Palette as well as Minimalism: Space Light Object, all housed within the National Gallery Singapore which is within the converted Supreme Court and Old City Hall buildings. The buildings are beautiful and wonderfully converted to house the galleries and flexible exhibition spaces.

Whilst the Wu exhibition was excellent, the Minimalism was interesting if slightly limited as compared to London /US.

Afterwards we had drinks at the Aura Skylounge and watched the sunset and Singapore skyline. A great way to end the day."
,,National Gallery,4.0,,"Interesting exhibitions but well spaced out over two ajoining buildings so not the easiest place to Navigate. Staff very helpful. Cafe busy but useful system of small pagers to let you know when your food is ready.
Best part is to go to the rooftop bar by the stairs from 'Smoke and Mirrors' the fifth floor as the sun goes down. Have a cocktail and enjoy the view as the light fades and the building lights come on. There is a laser show from the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel at 7, 8 and at intervals after this. Not spectacular but a lovely evening in a special place."
,,Best collection of arts,5.0,,"This is a great place to see Singapore and South Asian culture. you can observe the world’s largest collection of Singapore and Southeast Asian art. the gallery Consisting of modern and contemporary art. informative and educational. this is a good place for a research and education. every day they organize learning opportunity and events even you are a family or a solo traveler, you have something to attend."
,,Really cool place,4.0,,Really cool place with a lot of history regarding Singapore. Can take you a couple of days to see the entire place especially with the special exhibitions. To get most of the building highlights I suggest that you do a tour which is free with admission.
,,Take a tour and learn about the building,5.0,,"The gallery contains some magnificent works by local artists. They are displayed well in enormous spaces. Take a tour with one of the volunteers to really discover the collection. Some guides will also point out features of the new building, which is a re-vamp of the old Supreme Court and City Hall. Aspects of the old courts and judge's chambers and original furniture have been retained, so the viewer has a sense of the history of the building even though there is art on the walls. Guides will point out features you are certain to overlook. Old holding cells are there to see, and make sure you take the elevator to the rooftop for stunning views of the city."
,,Like art? Like architecture? Like exploring Southeast Asian culture?!,5.0,,"If the answer to any of the above is, ""Yes"", then you should definitely consider visiting the National Gallery of Singapore. It's easy to get to. Several MRT stations are nearby but City Hall is closest - and that is probably because half of the Gallery is housed within the old City Hall. The other half of the Gallery is in the adjacent Supreme Court Building. From the outside both buildings demonstrate their colonial majesty admirably (and are designated national monuments) but were converted into a terrific, flexible art and culture space in 2015. The interiors itself is worth the admission fee alone!

But, of course, art is the real draw. The Gallery hosts the world's largest public collection of Singaporean and Southeast Asian art. Spanning many different eras, styles, media and ethnic origin, the collection is rich and, to be honest, my wife and I failed to get round everything in our first trip. We will be back though!

If you are in Singapore for only a short time and only have a couple of hours to visit I would recommend one of the free guided tours. These are mostly delivered by highly knowledgeable docents and appear to run on the hour (late morning into the afternoon), covering different exhibits. We attended one tour and it was a great way to dive into some the Gallery's highlight works.

Nice cafe facilities and restaurants are on site if you need to recharge and rest your feet. The Gallery shop is also worth a browse!"
,,Art from the major Singaporean Ethnic Groups,4.0,,"Our visit to the National Gallery was interesting with different areas set aside for art from different South East Asian regions. It was not as spectacular as some other galleries, but particularly interesting because its inclusion with the court."
,,Could be good,3.0,,"It is a beautiful space. It clearly has fantastic art. My “could” is because I found the pricing structure confusing and I did read and I did ask. I clearly needed a general entry ticket but I’m afraid I didn’t find that clear until I was politely asked to leave a gallery. The member of staff was lovely about it. I had admittance to a special exhibition which was fine and I think I should have not paid because of another exhibition I’d visited.

Do go but check carefully you have the right entrance ticket, the staff on the counter will help but I clearly asked the wrong questions."
,,So Worth It!,5.0,,We have been to Singapore at least once a year for the last 30 years and this is the first time to visit the National Gallery. We really enjoyed it and there were a number of exhibits that our grandkids enjoyed as well! Plan ahead to know what restaurants are open and which ones require reservations. One that we looked at appeared to be too formal for us to enter with the grandkids.
,,An Architectural Heritage,5.0,,"What a splendid idea to transform the majestic and monumental Old Supreme Court Building and the Old City Hall into the National Gallery. Traipsing through the hallowed halls of these buildings was like walking through a historical timeline. The new ultramodern basement level adjoining the two buildings with link bridges was somewhat incongruent architecturally, but functional nevertheless.

We were privileged to have met Benjamin Ramalingam, who was a guide in one of the halls of the Old Supreme Court Building. He was a fount of knowledge about the history of Singapore, its constitution and its legal system. He exuded with enthusiasm and highlighted the legacy left by British to Singapore and the roles played by the founding fathers William Farquhar and Stamford Raffles.

Our visit to the National Gallery on Thursday 15th November 2018 was well worth our time. Other than the artworks on display, the preserved prime minister’s room, rotunda library, courtrooms, and other aspects of these historical buildings were a delight to behold."
,,"Came here for the architecture, fantastic !",5.0,,"National Gallery Singapore was the highlight of my visit back in January 2017. I went there solely to enjoy the building and architectural design, not to enjoy the artworks. Luckily, we could enjoy this building for free, as the admission ticket is only for those visiting the gallery area inside the building.

NGS is such a beautifully preserved old building, with several modern touch that makes this building enjoyable and instagrammable for the visitors.

There is a lounge/restaurant at the rooftop of the building, overlooking Padang filed, Singapore skyscrappers, as well as MBS area. There is also a small beautiful garden in this rooftop.

Moreover, we joined a free guided tour which started at 11am. It was great as we got to learn the background of this building and how it played a huge role in this country's history. The guide itself was a very nice person."
,,Great collection and child friendly,5.0,,"We really enjoyed our visit to the national gallery and had so much fun while we were there. As a family with little children in tow, sometimes a visit to places like museum can get boring for the child. It was not the case this time.
The gallery with its exquisite collections of artworks, also has a dedicated space for children. Our children had so much fun at the Keppel Centre for Art Education.
Staffs were all so friendly and accomodating. That also made our visit much more enjoyable. Would love to come back, 3 hours was just not enough."
,,A treasure,5.0,,"Well, I wasn't sure about visiting here but I'm so glad we did. We were entranced by so many of the beautiful works, most modern, all very well explained in English both on the walls and by the very friendly staff. Loved our visit from start to finish. The roof gardens were peaceful and with great views, the history of the buildings themselves and the court room, holding cells etc in the court building adjoining were fascinating too, don't miss walking over the atrium from one to the other as there's much to learn and enjoy in both buildings."
,,Excellent world class gallery in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"A world class gallery in Singapore. We visited at a quiet time as it’s main exhibition gallery was closed awaiting a new major exhibition that begins next week. It was still well worth visiting, there was more than enough to see in the other galleries full of inspiring art from SE Asia. it is worth a visit just to see the building. The way that the old Supreme Court and Hall buildings have been reused is remarkable."
,,Ecletic Wonderful Gallery,5.0,,Definitely deserves five stars. It is an amazing collection of art housed in a recommissioned building attached to the supreme court and city hall. Staff were delightfully helpful. Historical and beautiful collection of SE Asian art. Very special.
,,Great place with knowledgeable and friendly staff,4.0,,"I was greeted by friendly staff at the ticketing counter who advices we on the best discount option I can get for my foreign friends admission fee. Furthermore, the offer audio guide rental for free!

The place was a former supreme court and it is really ideal to be converted into a gallery! It's spacious and the architecture is simply beautiful!

Though I am not an art enthusiast, but I was greeted by friendly staff in every gallery I entered who would offer great help in making me appreciate the art work better."
,,Great place!,5.0,,"To be in this building with amazing architecture and exhibitions that are kept at a nice and low price, it is a great place to be if you want to see more about local and international arts and stay away from the blazing heat outside! Was great that there was a child area that my children could entertain themselves at too!"
,,Holiday,5.0,,Wonderful gallery saw the Vietnam war exhibition very sobering No time to see it all a lovely easy walk along the river to access
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,"Very nice place to spend a few hours out of the intense heat of the day. The architecture here is amazing so many places to take great shots.

It’s $20 entrance for non locals.

The painting are mostly SE Asian and they have some really nice ones. Rooftop garden & bar with city views top it off :)"
,,Juan Luna. Impressionists.,5.0,,"It was a real privilege to have had the chance to see artworks by the Filipino painter Juan Luna at the National Gallery of Singapore. It was a double treat to also have seen the exhibition on French Impressionist painters on the same visit.

Gift shop staff were very kind. My kids enjoyed a couple of activities for kids in one of the ateliers.

Visit was very pleasant and just the right size to enjoy for a couple of hours."
,,Views from Padang Deck,5.0,,I attended a private party here on tge Padang Deck. There is a bar there with delicious cocktails and amazing views!
,,Incredible!,5.0,,I was there with my friend and we were though like ''Oh maybe we spent time here just 2 hours'' but the truth is there are many many many thinggggssss to explore! About art and history in Southeast Asia! The staff was so very helpful as well. We got the discount from student id card and also the number booking airline.
,,Excellent Gallery Visit,5.0,,"I'm not a huge fan of art galleries but this one had me hooked on it for 3 hours.
It's also a beautiful colonial building in the center of Singapore.
One thing I should point out is the ""social table"". Here, with the excellent help of the member of staff (Saturday 27th October), you can select art items from the rolling digital display table and email them to yourself. It really is fantastic so you can keep a record of your favour pieces of art. Once emailed you could print it, make a t-shirt or put it on a mug.
Many thanks to the member of staff that day who was very helpful."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Amazing architecture as well as a variety of exhibits. You could easily spend a day here. Well worth a visit.
,,Great and eclectic art collection in a beautiful building,4.0,,Wonderful visit of this art museum which offers such a wide variety of genres and periods from classic to modern and conceptual. The building is in itself a beauty with a mix of classic and very modern wood/glass feel. Don’t miss the panoramic view from the roof terrasse. Free WiFi all across the museum. Worth a visit when in Singapore.
,,Impressive building,4.0,,"The National Gallery of Singapore is housed in an impressive large building. It has the City Hall and the former Supreme Court Building within it. As such, it has a very large combined area in excess of sixty thousand square metres. The design was carried out by a French firm of architects.

It is an art gallery with art works from South East Asia - and is reputed to have the largest collection of South East Asian art. There are two permanent galleries - DBS Singapore Gallery and UOB South East Asian Gallery. The art works are both modern and contemporary - and they have art which shows how the different cultures in Singapore have changed over the years in all aspects of their lives.

There are daily free guided tours which is very informative and educational.

All the art works are clearly labelled and easy to read.

Snacks and refreshments are available."
,,Building tour,5.0,,"Went on the tour for the history of the building, was supposed to be for an hour, went over time, which none of us minded, as there was so much to show and hear about. Our guide, Ling, was just lovely and very informative. If you are into history then it's well worth doing."
,,An excellent visit,5.0,,"From the traditional art works to those showing Western influences this is a very interesting collection. Labelling is clear and informative and there are plenty of staff available, and willing, to answer questions.
The buildings housing the exhibition - the former Supreme Court and City Hall - have been cleverly and imaginatively adapted to provide a very attractive venue.
There are several places for refreshments in the gallery from fine dining to snacks."
,,Large museum,4.0,,This space is quite big and it is necessary some time to visit well. There are some parts more interesting than others so you can choose what to see according to your taste.
,,One of the culture sights in Singapore- an all rounder,5.0,,"It is worth a visit for several reasons. 1. National Gallery and former Supreme Court are now one modern architectural piece. Definitely worth seeing. 2. The exhibition itself, of course. A number of exhibits including short history of the gallery, Singapore itself, artists, including a number of works from Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore - good way to learn something about the culture and history of the region and the country. 3. Last but not least, there is a roof top bar Smoke and Mirrors with great views and cocktails, including Singapore Sling. Well, a cultural all-rounder, I would say:)."
,,Excellent ART place,5.0,,"Level one, there is an children art activity gallery. Children can draw and play, is fit for children age group 3-8. Level 4, there is a special art exhibition from China, Wu Guan Zhong. Quiet place and you just need to sit there and enjoy. Set a free afternoon to go there"
,,"Avoid: Empty, nothing to see",1.0,,"Can’t understand the good reviews:

Nothing, I mean absolutely nothing there to see, long huge empty rooms/walls ; poorly indicated,

We did it in less than 50mns.

Think about art as jam... the less you have, the more you spread it on your toast.

See my pictures: long boring empty corridors, not even a picture on the walls!!!

Absolute waist of time and money, just go to the national museum nearby."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The Gallery is situated more or less a stones throw from the statue of Raffel. The building has been joined in the centre by an unusual but exciting construction which joins the former Supreme Court & the Parliament building's together. The artworks are worth spending time taking in the offerings - a great way to spend a day or two in air conditioned comfort. There is a bar but take the cash reserves with you.
,,Fun trip for the whole family,5.0,,"With many games and activities for children, it will never be boring for the whole family. Kids can draw and color, make their own digital ceramic vase, climb ropes, running through obstacle course, building flexible shapes on the wall, clanking pots and pans to explore sounds. Fully equipped with the necessary tools, it was an all rounded free admission trip which makes it worth the day. Better than going for expensive paid theme parks."
,,Always learn something new,5.0,,"I have been to the national gallery twice now on my various visits to Singapore and I have to say that the people who work at this museum are super educated about the history of their country. I find this museum to be a beautiful place to learn about the rich past of Singapore and all the political turmoil it has been through to become the nation it has become today. Learn about the constitution and how Singapore because independent of Malaysia and the Great Britain all together. Ask the people in each room to give you a mini tour and they will walk you through the story of how every exhibits represents Singapore so beautifully.

You must visit."
,,Great to spend a few hours,4.0,,"Very interesting Museum, very clean and tidy and explains the history of Singapore. We spent a few interesting hours there, well worth a visit"
,,"For photography and art lover, best to start your tour at 9:30am for exterior photo-shooting",5.0,,"Gallery open at 10AM, if you reach early, you will have plenty of time to take photos outside the building before the crowd. If you wish to have a guided tour, purchase/exchange the ticket first and check with the info counter.

Please avoid using selfie stick and tripod inside the gallery.

This is an interesting place where you can learn about the history of SG, and get to know more about the artist from SEA."
,,A Peaceful Corner,5.0,,We had our lunch at Violet Onn's restaurant and the food was delicious. Love the simple and clean decor of the gallery with a lot of natural sunlight.
,,World Class Gallery,4.0,,Great gallery to explore situated in a wonderful building. The building was the Supreme Court and City Hall before its transformation to a world class art gallery. The architecture compliments the art perfectly. You have to pay a fee to visit all of the exhibitions though some parts are free. We spent three hours and could have spent longer as there is plenty of art to see. There are a couple of cafes inside for refreshments. Easily accessible by MRT.
,,Very interesting to see,4.0,,"I went here today, I thought that it was really interesting and definitely worth a visit. But personally I did find it a bit boring but that’s just because I’m hyperactive and enjoy doing more active things but that’s just my opinion and it was very interesting."
,,Plan before you go,3.0,,"We had an hour or so to spare, so dropped in here to see what there was. Unfortunately the exhibitions are $20 a head and don’t have a lot of info on what’s in them, so we didn’t pursue any further.

We did walk around the building and see some of the architecture and free spaces, but I would suggest do your homework and go only if you want to pay and see one or more specific exhibition."
,,A proud nation on show!,5.0,,"This gallery is a composite of the old City Hall and the Supreme Court, so structurally it is very impressive. I visited the fascinating exhibition on the Law of the Land and thoroughly recommend the evening Insight Tour available on the last Friday of the month. You will learn the history of Singapore from 1819 to 1965 through its constitutional documents. The gallery has much more besides, so I hope to return to explore further. It has a great little cafe too!"
,,Come ..See.. Latest Archive ..Donald Trump & Kim Jong-Un,5.0,,"It’s not Art Gallery neither National History Museum but it’s National Gallery , a Mega National Gallery a pride of the nation ..I would say .’ pride of the ASEAN nations too ‘ as it’s a world ‘s largest public collection of Singapore and SE Asian art.

It was a result of a 5 years of a transformation of old Supreme Court and City Hall buildings with a huge budget of over s$500 mil.

I went on my own to Art Gallery at Hall 1,2&3 on Level 2 , after the exit of Hall 3 a young lady at the exit hall helped me to accumulate the Paintings I liked into a digital poster and sent it to my email as a souvenir .. cool !

Our daily tour guide, a trained lawyer lady, provided by the Gallery was smiling all the time and knowledgeable enough .She showed 18-20 of us in the tour group many things ,like thousands of new glass sheets and weaved rattan-design perforated panels roofing across the 2 buildings for cooling effect and a ‘cheap ‘unique invention of terrazzo flooring deployed instead of expensive marble tiles and a chocolate look-a-like coffered ceiling .The highlight was the Holding Cells ,Court Room and Chief Justice Room and she singled out one long elaborate designed table used for signing of joint statement in recent meeting in June here, between Donal Trump and Kim Jong-Un ( not at the Gallery but it was transported to the venue on Sentosa island ) .

She elaborated how the country upholds the judicial system and highly regards the position of Chief justice as the highest V.I.P above all others and that impressed me !

I sum it all..it’s your loss if you give this place a miss when you visit Singapore !"
,,History in a colonial building,4.0,,It’s a sprawling exhibition of art and Singaporean national history. The bit about how Singapore became independent was interesting. Do take advantage of student discounts if you can.
,,Art and History,5.0,,"The building itself is a significant & historical masterpiece. Also the art piece in the museum not only includes contemporary arts but also arts that make you have a closer understand about the south east Asia history. The staffs inside each exhibition room are also knowledgeable and helpful, you can learn from some unique perspective from them."
,,Excellent museum,5.0,,"We went on an 11am tour and we learned a lot about Singapore. There is an entry fee ($10 Seniors) but well worth it. Cafe is good to have coffee or lunch. Planetarium was excellent, the falling flowers on the walls are just amazing and the moving wall of the forest from day into night is a joy to see. Great day there."
,,Outstanding Two Hours In An Incredible Museum!,5.0,,"I had just visited the Air Force Museum a little earlier in the day and actually had it in me to visit another museum only because it was my last day in Singapore and still had some time before the NGS closed (which is at 7pm).

Boy was it totally worth it! Such an amazing and incredible place, even if by the time I got there, I only had about 2 hours to explore (which is still a great deal of time to see many of the different venues in this sprawling place).

There's really a bit of everything to see here from colorful paintings created by artists around the southeast Asian area, to real life 3D art installations, and of course, lots of history about Singapore

* Special note: If you're a student or teacher from a visiting country anywhere outside Singapore, BRING YOUR ID! Why? That being, they have a special price scheme where if you're an overseas student or teacher (with an ID), you can get a $5 discount off your original ticket price!"
,,Lovely gallery,4.0,,Set in buildings that are now in a building which is amazing the gallery has a lot of lovely art pieces in all styles from local artists. It also includes history of Singapore with some notable historical pieces. Definitely worth a visit.
,,Excellent gallery of local art,5.0,,"I went to an exhibition of Lim Chen Hoe's work, from the 1930's to the 1970's. These watercolour paintings depicted the changes which occurred in Singapore during those decades, from little houses and huts early on, to high rise buildings in the 1970's. There are also quite a few excellent portraits, including a self-portrait. Lim worked full-time in an administrative job, supporting a wife and five children. He was only able to practise his art on Sundays, when he used to join other artists beside the river and paint en plein air."
,,There's something for everyone in the family,5.0,,"I've always loved and admire the Supreme Court Building each time I pass by and always wonder what the inside looked like. We happened to had free tickets for the family to visit the place, that has now turned into an art gallery.

I love walking down some of the rooms and having a feel of what it must have been like in a courtroom. There were all the old treaties that were on display, which me and my husband took our time reading through them and understanding the history of Singapore better.

While the adults enjoyed the time, our kids also had their fair share of fun. There are a lot of activity rooms, such as drawing, digital designing, play rooms for the kids to explore and have fun with.

We went at least half the day at the gallery, which was a surprise to me because I didnt realise time had passed so fast! We all truly enjoyed the experience here."
,,A little pricey,3.0,,"Building itself it is quite impressive, shared with town hall this museum hold some of best collections of local artists. Unfortunately, too much modern art and it is not for all. I think is a average visit but quite expensive."
,,Must visit. Best Gallery in Singapore,5.0,,This was by far the most outstanding gallery in Singapore. The design of the building to the layout was impressive. I have been visiting Singapore for some 43 years and by visiting the National Gallery of Singapore I felt that Singapore has finally come of age. Well done!
,,Must-see,4.0,,The museum is very impressive and definitely a must-see! You'll certainly enjoy this impressive gallery. For Europeans it's especially interesting to see a lot of Asian art.
,,Highly underrated!,5.0,,"Think it's fantastic. The architecture, design, exhibits and service. The curation is remarkable and the permanent and temporary exhibits are equally good. Worth a visit!"
,,Nothing much upgraded,3.0,,"We went there almost 2 years ago, basically almost same theme. You played with sounds from cooking utensils, Color tubes sound transmission, Color & drawing with screen ( only changed from animal to human) and hand colouring and played with stamps.

They added 3D bridge to walk through which is pretty nice & flowers animation room.
Recommend for people that never been there and children under 7 years old.
Otherwise pretty boring."
,,Fave Museum in Singapore,5.0,,"The moment you walk in, the magnificence of the old Supreme Court just hits you. Depending on where you walk in from, if you walk in from the main door facing the Padang, it's beautiful seeing the way light and shadows play with each other. Kudos to the architecture and design of the place. I'm just saying your experience at the museum begins right at the start.

The various exhibitions and permanent displays are thoughtfully curated. I actually really enjoy their permanent paintings showcasing SEA artists and the various exhibits like Between Worlds are memorable. Thank you to the curators for making me proud and aware of the artists in SEA. Their annual Children Biennale is always a whole lot of fun and inspiring for the kids (+young at heart like me). Always excited for what is to come :)"
,,Huge gallery with something to whole family,5.0,,"In August there was a big setup for kids - different kind of activities and installations on 3 levels. And then there are permanent exhibitions about Singaporean art & culture for the parents. Plan at least half a day there! And don't forget to check out tea garden at the rooftop! :)
It's wise to return the gallery at evening to check out the terrace cafe's."
,,A hidden gem,5.0,,"The staff in each of the collections are so helpful - really know about the work and very kind in sharing. The building itself is fascinating in terms of history, and has a calming effect. The views from the top are stunning. The Ng Teng Fong roof garden installation is just lovely..."
,,Heaven for Art Lovers,3.0,,"Place is a very interesting site. Although, not an art enthusiast, it does wonders to explore and get lost in the world of paintings from local artists and visualize on art forms."
,,Incredible,5.0,,It’s an incredible building with so much history! I would 10/10 recommend doing one of the free tours as it gives you so much history and knowledge of the building itself! So many cool exhibitions!
,,Plan your visit carefully,2.0,,We enjoy art galleries and have been to quite a few in various parts of the world but this one proved very frustrating. The art is spread across two buildings in many different rooms and we had a great deal of trouble figuring out a sensible itinerary that wasn't going to take us all day. The Gallery is housed in the old City Hall & Supreme Court Buildings which is why the whole thing has a rabbit warren feel to it and why our frustration at finding our way outweighed our enjoyment of the art. YMMV.
,,Wonderful gallery,5.0,,"We had only planned to spend 2.5h here to enjoy the children's festival (buy the kids pack for $5 and they get entrance included, vs $15 for the normal children's ticket price). Ended up staying for 4h to see all the exhibits. We went to the 5th floor to enjoy the views of the bay in the late afternoon and again around 8pm when all the buildings were lit up at night. Beautiful views. Should be able to go up to view without bakery tickets.
The galleries were well laid out and easy to progress through. Kids activities were fun. Lovely art.
Highly recommend."
,,Incredible collection and building,5.0,,"The National Gallery was a complete surprise to me in Singapore. It is this tranquil, beautiful internal rebuild of two beautiful heritage colonial buildings. Reminded me of the British Museum or the Louve with regards to the reuse of an older space - just beautiful. In the heat of Singapore a few hours (or more - there is so much to see) here is a wonderful opportunity to quietly discover the artistic history and future of this region. As a teacher I was also hugely impressed with everything they had on offer for children. There were babies as young as 10 months getting into the experiences they had on offer. The other lovely thing is that there are so many attendants opening and shutting doors for you and welcoming you into new spaces. Its a very special experience regardless if you are an art lover or not. Like all things in Singapore, it is a world class experience."
,,Not to miss,5.0,,"The National Gallery has a extraordinary collection of art, both modern as older. The building itself is very special as well, also a combination of old and new. When visiting the museum please check with the visitor center the route to follow. The rooftop area should not be missed, which is a design but also for the view very good."
,,Lovely visit for photography,5.0,,The gallery has wonderful architecture. We didn’t buy a ticket but we were able to wander around the building to take some cool photos. It was also very empty - I guess it’s not a tourist destination. I highly recommend you pay a visit. It’s only a 5 min walk from the MRT.
,,"The building, art and views from Level 6 were stunning!",5.0,,"The art, building and views of Singapore from level 6 are simply stunning. I highly recommend a visit if you are after a culturally diverse experience."
,,lovely view from the rooftop bar,4.0,,not a cheap bar but a great place to get a relaxed view of the city we didn't visit the gallery itself but the building looked great
,,Interesting indeed.,4.0,,"We were there for the children's festival in summer. Each year during this time, the national gallery set an exhibition for children. And it's very interesting, different and fun for kids."
,,Understanding Singapore's Rich History through Art,5.0,,"As an American living in Singapore, I can highly recommend exploring the National Gallery. The buildings of their former Supreme Court and City Hall were integrated to create this one of a kind experience. The artwork helped me better under the national sense of pride of Singapore and the area nations. It is worth getting a guided tour so you are able to ask questions and gain a deeper understanding."
,,Architecture and art meet in a wonderful building,5.0,,"This gallery exceeded our expectations. Both the art and the architecture are wonderful. Both the Court part and the City Hall part are interesting, and very different, so don't skip ."
,,Special exhibition dependent,3.0,,"I'm more of a modern art fan, so i don't get most of the south east art that's being displayed here. I enjoyed it when they had the yayoi exhibition but such things are far and few in between The architecture is stunning though"
,,Huge gallery with lots of surprises,4.0,,"I was there on a casual visit and it turns out to be surprisingly good. Although most of the arts is far beyond me, I still enjoy the quiet environment and a slow nice pace to take your time with the pieces in the museum. In addition, there are plenty of places to sit and rest, and you can always take the lift if you need too. There are water coolers available near most of the washroom making this place really enjoyable."
,,a place to calm your mind,4.0,,"After much activities all over Singapore, this place is perfect to just kind of calm down the soul and mind. Interesting place to expose young children to art too. If your time allows it, definitely drop by."
,,Perfect Day With The Kids,5.0,,"If you have a free morning with the kids, visit the National Gallery to see the ""Small Big Dreamers"" activities room. Room are free of charge and some involve cost. Definitely worth the visit. The building is stunning, it's quiet in the mornings so it feels like you've got the space to yourself. Really enjoyed it and perfect for the kids, just wished i had more time to explore some of the artists featured. Inside the gallery there are some wonderful restaurants."
,,Massive gallery of art pieces,4.0,,I suggest you book online tickets because they are cheaper than the declared price in the ticket outlet (20 sgd/adult). Allot at least three (3) hours if you want to explore this gallery.
,,Great experience at National Gallery Singapore,5.0,,"I visited the gallery on 16 June 2018. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all personnel of the gallery for their warm reception. Special thanks would be given to a kind staff at the ticketing office who exhausted his way to assist me in ticket purchase with discount. This kind offer made me felt truly respected and very much welcomed as a tourist.

In my humble opinion, it has been such a remarkable and eye-widening journey to be strolling around the gallery and appreciating the diversified contemporary artworks which would deepen one's way of look towards history and culture of Singapore or East Asia as a whole.

The recent Children's Festival: Small Big Dreamers exhibition is a happy bomb to a not-too-old yet not-too-young adult like me. You can try on those wish cards and hand-made musical instruments.

The interior design and layout of the gallery are, generally speaking, clear and well structured. I am sure I would be revisiting the place soon in near future for more wonderful experiences."
,,Great Exhibition of Southeastern Asian Arts,5.0,,Impressive collection of Southeastern Asian Arts. Staff were extremely helpful. Admission was not cheap but worth a visit.
,,"Good variety of exhibits, large building to roam",5.0,,I went here a few times. The free exhibits are generall quite good and you dont need to necessarily spend to go and admire the art exhibitions. However once in a while the Gallery does offer some attractive material such as the Yayoi Kusuma and the French art collection from the Museee d'Orsay. Worthwhile for weekends
,,Interesting place,4.0,,"This is the second time we visited the place but we dont remember it til we reached there. Each time, we went for the children festival. This time is for the Small Big Dream. I find it interesting that they try to make it interesting and introduce gallery for suitable for children. There are lots of exhibits so you need to move around the gallery to experience the exhibits. Depending on the theme for the season, the exhibit hall might have different types of exhibits.

There is also Keppel Art Centre which have interesting things for the children to play.

My girls' favourites are the fire walk and the interaction play to create the costumes etc. v interesting!

Overall, it is also recommended for children to go. I did not visit those exhibits meant for adults, hence unable to comment.

Good job to National Gallery who always come up with different themes."
,,Love the kids friendly arts exhibition,5.0,,This has been our most favorite place to enjoy the peaceful moment and also artistic work over the weekend in stead of squeezing inside the crowds in the shopping mall. Specially love the kids exhibition especially the annual children festival. Our daughter can spend one whole day here.
,,What a treat!!,5.0,,"We chanced on visiting the National Gallery Singapore at the right time of year (January 2018) and were treated to the exhibition ""Century of Light"". This exhibition featured the ""Colours of Impressionism"" and ""Between Two Worlds"". It was a priceless opportunity to see some of the best impressionist paintings including those of Monet and Renoir. The ""Between Two Worlds"" exhibition featured Juan Luna and Raden Saleh and was most interesting also. The gallery offers other permanent exhibitions and the building itself is unique and full of character."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"After being advised that it was free entry, pretty disappointing to find out that only the shops plus some old prison cells were available to view for free. You would think that Singapore, being such a diverse city where there are many thousands of tourists spending money consistently, would give people free entry to the gallery...especially the Asian section of it at least. Had only 2 hours to spare so not really worth it to buy a ticket."
,,Intersting exhibits over two floors,4.0,,Enjoyed the photos of old Singapore and the information about how Singapore developed over the years. Some cluttering of exhibits and printing too small
,,So much to see,4.0,,"I really enjoy galleries when travelling and this one was a delight. The staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly - initially approaching and giving advice and answering questions when they spotted me looking lost! The works on display were also inspiring and fresh, while the building in which they are housed is gorgeous. It was surprisingly uncrowded - verging on empty - which led me to think that most tourists must bypass this spot. Their loss. In addition to the many (and varied) displays there are also a number of spots within the building to dine. Well worth checking out!"
,,A Gallery Worth Visiting,4.0,,"I just love how Singapore has worked so hard to showcase their culture and art. Having the National Gallery is just so awesome. The place is very nice and modern. There are so many things on display and exhibit.

It is located near the metro thus it is easy to locate. The rooftop also has nice view of the Marina Bay Sands.

The art Gallery is amazing! I would love to visit this again!"
,,Should have allowed twice the time,5.0,,"For the past several trips to Singapore I'd wanted to go to the National Gallery. We made it this time, but thoughtlessly only allowed a couple of hours.

The buildings are grand, but the artwork is outstanding, the latter telling a very powerful story of southern Asia. Once you get the hang of the p[lace it's easy to navigate. And there's some real history buried in there - such as the signed letter agreeing to the separation of Malaysia and Singapore signed by Prime Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Tunku Abdul Rahman. A wonderful piece of history."
,,Art and Architecture- best views,5.0,,"The gallery is a special place to spend a few hours, I reccomend the docent tours to allow you to get the most out of the art works on display- they are all incredibly knowledgable about SE asian art , and the history and archtiecture of the building is fascinating as well. The roof top bar Smoke and Mirrors is my favorite place for a sunset cocktail, with a view of the entire downtown, marina bay area to gaze upon."
,,Awesome art gallery,5.0,,Visited the Monet collection and my favorite is actually local artists' galleries. Absolutely fantastic and remarkable. I would recommend frequent visitors to Singapore to get a membership card for limitless visit per year.
,,Loved it.,5.0,,"What a great place to visit, so much to see and not enough time to do it. We were a bit rushed for time when we visited so did not get the most out of it. Will definitely come again an this time allow ourselves a lot more time to fully appreciate what the gallery has to offer."
,,Beautiful restored space with fantastic children’s activities,5.0,,The restored National Gallery is the pride and joy of Singaporeans. There is a dedicated space for children to explore and interact with art. It is refreshed with new installations often and my kids love to spend time there.
,,You can spend days here and still won’t be enough,5.0,,"I visited so many times the national gallery; is one of the most beautifully constructed buildings; you can find so much knowledge about the history of Singapore; about art; it’s one of the most relaxing places and has so many coffee places. I think I went few times and looking forward to go again. Very knowledgeable staff lovely people !! Great place for children to learn about the majestic history of this wonderful country.
If you are a tourist this is a must"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,This gallery is absolutely fantastic. It’s definitely worth the entrance fee as you can easily spend several hours here. The current ‘walk walk walk’ installation is beautiful and amazing fun - kids would live it. Otherwise great selection of both modern and more traditional work. The building itself is exceptional and there’s a good selection of restaurants.
,,a morning at the Gallery.,5.0,,Wow .. The National Gallery was fantastic. We spent the morning here and loved it all.The surrounding gardens wer lovely.
,,"Excellent, very expansive and good vakue",5.0,,Arrived around 1130am on a Saturday. Very quiet. No queue. Singapore airline passengers gets 25% off making the already fair value even cheaper. Stayed for more than a few hours. Loved it.
,,A bit pricey,2.0,,"We wandered away from the Central Business District to take a look at Singapore’s National Gallery. Found close to Anderson Bridge and by the Court House and Theatre Hall, the Gallery is a huge imposition building, striking from the outside.

Having heard about its prestige and excellent artwork, we were really interested to visit, however sadly, were put off by the prices which stood at 20 SGD for foreigners (0 SGD for Singapore nationals). Some of the reviews on here detail the price and we are in agreement that it is slightly steep for what it is. There are plenty of other attractions worth paying 20 SGD over this. Shame."
,,A good collection of Asian art...,3.0,,...but it isn't worth the entry price of S$20. Luckily we visited during International Museum Day (18 May) so it was free for us! Some really interesting exhibitions.
,,Enjoy Both the Buildings and the Art,4.0,,"The Gallery is housed in the buildings which previously comprised the City Hall and Supreme Court. The art displays are combined with historical aspects of the buildings' history - very well combined and displayed

The entry fee is S$20 ($15 if you show a Singapore Airlines boarding pass)"
,,Good Rooftop Views!,4.0,,The building is beautiful and modern. The rooftop offers the good views of Singapore. The decoration is nice. The staff are friendly and helpful. It costs $20 to see the paintings. It is free to enter.
,,Both the building and the art pieces are worth a visit,5.0,,"I was very impressed by the modern architectural work to connect the two buildings. There are interesting modern art work and old paintings as well, showing Singapore history. The area is also worth walking around as it's close to the gardens and the merlion."
,,Tiny country punches above its weight at the NGS,5.0,,"Give it a few hours, even if you are just in town for a few days. In which case try and tee up a few tour, too.

And if you live here, become a member - or friend of the gallery. The benefits are seen after your 2nd trip. It really is a great gallery, and disappointing that the majority of Singaporeans just use it as a backdrop to their selfies."
,,A museum trip,5.0,,By far the most extensive and architecturally elaborate museum in Singapore with relevant and well-curated art exhibitions that seek to amaze viewers.
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,"This heritage building is really a work of art. At any given time it has some exciting exhibition going on. Its also well connected via mrt or taxi and once you are done you can spend a few hours walking around the Padang area, its gorgeous. Avoid the afternoon, as it gets too sunny, but you can roam around inside. It also has a few upscale restaurants, so dress appropriately."
,,Glorious building,5.0,,Fascinating exhibits showing Singapore on ground floor were the highlight for us. Then the roof terrace overlooking two cricket grounds were so relaxing to look out from and enjoy a Singapore sling.
,,Enjoy this building,4.0,,"This place is one of the good place to showcase many art exhibitions and workshops. The building is also very clean, many art spot to take pictures Although the ticket is a bit pricey. So, 4 stars are enough :)"
,,Don't miss the impressionists and the rooftop bar,4.0,,"The building itself is quite grand and has its own history. There are a number of permanent and rotating exhibits, but for us the must-see was the impressionist collection. Monets, Cezannes and other great masters; a nice collection. The temporary exhibits were more hit or miss, but you can always just stroll a little faster. Probably 2 to 3 hours to drink it all in. We really enjoyed the rooftop bar, because a) we were tired and needed to sit and b) the views were terrific."
,,Didn’t see any art but the view at the top!,5.0,,Our intention was to see art but nothing really excited us and it was a hot day so we just wanted a drink and we stumbled upon a bar called mirror and smoked at the top ! The view is amazing. You are overlooking the cricket club and you can see marina bay with unobstructive view
,,A great attraction to visit to learn all you want to know about Singapore.,5.0,,"There is a complete scale model of Singapore, which is a great help learning all about the Country. You can also learn all about how the Country continues to build, and how everything is used: there are no landfills in Singapore for rubbish. I was lucky to visit on the last day it was open on 30 April 2018, it is my understanding it is now closed for 3 months."
,,Understanding Singapore’s Past,4.0,,"A place that can easily take up three hours of one’s time. It provides the art and architectural history of the Singapore and her asian neighbors. There are guided, as well as self-guided tours available. There is also free WiFi in the gallery."
,,Gorgeous Portraits and Helpful Staff,5.0,,"This museum is an architectural delight as it combines old government buildings with modern glass. I adored the portrait gallery, the art work is stunning and calming. The staff is full of eager smiles to help explain the importance of each Asian artist. The view from the terrace is a must."
,,Architecture,4.0,,"We booked the guided architecture tour to learn about the amazing roof structure and how the two buildings were combined into one. The tour takes about 1h and it's definitely worth it, a good alternative to the shopping malls if you need to wait out one of Singapore's many many rainshowers."
,,Well worth a visit.,4.0,,"This is a very interesting building sympathetically converted out of the old colonial court house. The art collection is interesting and the interior of the building retains features of its former purpose. We enjoyed a guided tour which showed us highlights of the collection and gave us a more in depth description of examples from the collection and the building. When we were there there was an excellent interactive light show, but obviously exhibits change over time. You can easily lose yourself in here for a few hours and there is a nice cafe/bar to refresh yourself when you are finished."
,,Great experience,5.0,,"We decided to visit because it would be cooler inside than out, but so glad we did! The buildings which house the gallery are worth a visit, let alone the art work itself. Originally the Supreme Court and City Hall, they have been stunningly redeveloped but maintain their history and key features. The visit to the interactive gallery was amazing - a must do!"
,,Terrific day in cool gallery,5.0,,"We had a terrific day at the National Gallery. We did a free tour of the architecture , which gave us a good understanding of the significance of the building, Loved the art which we viewed before and after a memorable lunch at Odette. It was great to see such an eclectic gallery."
,,Go not only for the museum but the great views of Singapore on the rooftop...There is a bar there too,5.0,,Beautiful building One of the stops on the Big Bus tours Go to the rooftop bar not cheap but where else would you get such a view Singapore.
,,The jewel of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are interesting in Arts of Singapore - must visit! We have beautiful story about singapore from 19th Century to present - Nama Kamu Siapa? - permanent exhibition. It carries respectful artists such as Cheong Soo Pieng, Liu Kang, Georgette Chen, Chen Wen Hsi, Ang Ah Tee... the Nanyang Artists."
,,"Great views, great art!",5.0,,Joined a buildings tour which was very educational and interesting. Managed to see the exhibitions which were fabulous...all on Chinese/ Singapore paintings.Views from Padang deck were superb. Staff were most kind n helpful! Highly recommended!
,,It was good in the begining,3.0,,"At the beginning of the of Museum it seemed very nice, but as you went further you could see how Singapore politics plays a part in the museum. Some of the exhibits pandered to China, I assume they don't want to upset Chinese visitors. I for sure will not recommend this place. How can one omit Taiwan out of WWII history and just call it China and the same goes for Hong Kong. During WWII Hong Kong was British but also omitting this out is just wrong."
,,Excellent art gallery to visit,5.0,,"We spent 2-3 hours here. There were few other people there, and I have to admit, it was slightly un-nerving to have a guard keeping an eye on our every move during our visit. But in one gallery we had our own personal guide she was so enthusiastic about her country's art. And It is lovely. A bonus was hearing a concert by a double bass quartet. Do go and know that you will be having a lovely quiet visit."
,,Enjoy the view on the deck if you are there!,4.0,,"Other than the special features and main showrooms, it is beautiful to be on the roof deck during sunset to watch the lights illuminate as the sunset.

The pictures I took for after 8, but I believe it is beautiful around sunset. There is a bar on top if you want to splurge on a cocktail/beer to enjoy the view. Reservation recommended if you want a nice view.

Went during Light to night festival, so it was very crowded, but anyway it is free for Singapore citizens throughout the year. My favourite was the fear factor art bridge where it looks like you are walking high up, but it's actually mirror effects!"
,,informative,5.0,,"spent nearly five hours in this beautifully restored building. joined three guided tours on a saturday, namely building highlights/singapore artists/and sea artists, all interesting and narrated by enthusiasts. had lunch at the national kitchen by violet oon, a lovely designed restaurant serving peranakan cuisine. do make reservation in advance because it’s popular."
,,Very good Gallery,5.0,,"I love Art Galleries, this one was very good.
The works were almost exclusively from Singapore or about Singapore.
The quality of the pieces and the displays were excellent.
Free WiFi.
Get of at the City Hall MRT Station, NS25, and walk about 400 metres.
Worth a visit."
,,Impressing and beautiful,5.0,,"The place for some of singapores finest art and most exiting art exhibitions. If you are interested in art, this museum is a must see."
,,A museum unlike any other.,5.0,,"So I will start off by stating that I'm not a big museum guy but the museum really blew me away. I arrived with a donor of the museum who gave me an expectantly unique tour. He took me there to see the famous Chinese ink brush artists as well as a few contemporary Chinese painters. I was blown away with the level of skill required to complete some of the work. I also got to see other Asian artists from the Philippines and Indonesia which is something I don't get to see at home or even in Europe. It was a rare opportunity for me to see artists from other regions who were making beautiful work for centuries unbeknownst to me.
They also have these cool sky bridges that connect one side of the museum to the other that make for excellent photo ops. There is a roof top bar with a nice view of the skyline as well. This was a good stop and a really cool experience.

Not so humbly submitted,
Michael C."
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,The building itself it is worth of a visit. I am not a fan of the art they have displayed but it is very well organized and the building is absolutely gorgeous.
,,Must visit,4.0,,A good place to visit be it for leisure walk or real art viewing. The special exhibitions made it possible to visit the museum frequently and it's always a wonderful experience. There are promotions and free entrance for students so be aware and ask the staff if you're entitled to it.
,,Well laid out and visitor friendly.,4.0,,The gallery is huge so worth several visits. The DBS Singapore galleries are excellent. Staff throughout are helpful and friendly.
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Spent a couple of hours here, some beautiful ancient Chinese Art was being exhibited among other things. The new cafe was good and not expensive. If you like galleries this is one for you."
,,"If you like museum, painting etc, you must visit this",4.0,,"I visited this museum with group school early March 2018 Nice and big museum, have big collection. Very informative detail, good if you like arts, history etc Museum have 2 cafe if you need it"
,,Went to see the Juan Luna exhibit,5.0,,"This exhibit: Century of Light cost 15 Singaporean/person. The Juan Luna (Filipino) exhibit was well done and had good explanations alongside many of the paintings. Also, Raden Saleh (Indonesian) we were not familiar with, was a fantastic artist also. It was also interesting to see the contrasting styles."
,,Really worth the visit!,5.0,,"We had a chance to do a quick visit to the National Gallery to view the Special Exhibit of works of Juan Luna and Raden Saleh and of impressionist Monet, Manet and Renoir. I really liked the efficiency, convenience and atmosphere at the NGS. We will surely visit this place again to see the other collections."
,,Take a free tour,5.0,,Take a free tour and see the amazing place. Far exceeded expectations. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone should cone here. Great contemporary art. Note still need a ticket.
,,be there for the architecture,3.0,,"The country of Singapore has had so much success preserving and rejuvenating its historical buildings , and the National Gallery is no exception .

The chief architect hired from France did a great job in combining the old Supreme Court building and the Municipality building .

On the 4th floor, there is a neat corner giving useful information on the histories
of the 2 buildings and on all the work that was done on them, to create the present National Gallery .

The art collection itself would take some time to build up to a meaningful body therefore do not go there with too high an expectation . I was happy to see the featuring of the artist Wu GuanZhong."
,,Wonderful Historical Site,3.0,,"The architecture of the museum is brilliant and amazing, however, the museum is rather confusing and I had a difficult time finding my way around the galleries. Staff was enthusiastic and helpful enough to help me find my way. Overall, it was an Ok experience. Recommended for those who can appreciate art pieces."
,,An interesting place to visit,4.0,,We enjoyed our visit here - particularly visiting the galleries that show the transition from traditional Chinese art influenced by western art. There are some good eating places. There are many bare walls which could be filled with interesting art. The building layout is complex and takes a while to understand!
,,"Great building, but terrible visitor experience",2.0,,"Interesting collection in strikingly repurposed architecture! What’s not to like? Actually a lot. A terrible visitor experience overall. No decent wayfinding. No map provided once I finally found the ticket desk. Phone app useless - no functioning Bluetooth or reliable wifi. Hopelessly confusing navigation of the building to follow chronological path through exhibitions. Inadequate signage. Map provided finally by helpful guard poorly laid out and hard to follow. Finally, mediocre food and weak tea provided in noisy and messy ground floor cafe (also almost impossible to find). Hard to focus on the art in these circumstances. $30 for tourist entry. No special exhibitions. Of doubtful value."
,,A wonderful space to immerse yourself in,4.0,,"I have been to the National Gallery many times and it never fails to spark my excitement. Exhibits are well displayed with detailed explanation. Both the exterior and interior are grand, blending an old world charm with modern architecture."
,,"Beautiful location, too confused and little to see",2.0,,The renovation must have costed a fortune and has been done impeccably. Maybe more exhibitions and with more appeal would help... definitely directions are missing and you get lost. Museum visit layout badly needed.
,,Great collection of eastern and western art,4.0,,"The building itself is worth seeing - and it's free to get in, except for special exhibits. It can be confusing to find your way, but the staff are very helpful."
,,Great art collection and brilliant architecture,5.0,,"The Gallery houses a vast collection of paintings that trace the history of Singapore. Best to join the guided tour offered by the Gallery to better appreciate the artworks as well as the architecture. Interesting to see are the paintings from the Philippine masters - Fernando Amorsolo, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Fabian dela Rosa and others more."
,,Well worth a visit !,4.0,,Take the MRT to City Hall and walk round the corner all under cover - in case it rains ! Pass St Andrews Cathedral and into the Gallery - one was the old Court House - you can spend a day easy walking around and even have a nice lunch in the restaurant- the cost in is Sin Dolllars 20 about Euro 12 and it is worth every cent.
,,An enchanting experience,5.0,,It was an enchanting experience at the National Gallery. A truly magnificent building and an absolutely fascinating range of experiences are provided. The Japanese tea house and the bamboo maze are wonderful. There is a stunning and spectacular view of the City on the terrace. A must visit
,,An Art Lovers Delight!,5.0,,"Family friendly, wheel chair accessible, great photo ops for picture taking, educational, and inspiring! Great dining too!"
,,Informative and interesting use of technology,5.0,,"My colleague and I had limited time to visit around Singapore, but we both decided it was very worth the time we spent at National Gallery. There is a great view from the 6th floor roof. The people who worked there were helpful to make our experience the fullest possible and helped point out details we may have missed otherwise (like how to view a couple art installations). It’s pretty impressive realizing the building itself is an artifact that they built around to preserve it. The structure connecting both buildings is a nod to the traditional and modern with a modern looking tree as a support structure rather than just a pillar. I learned a lot about Singapore’s history and culture. They integrated media to show the progression and decision process for restoration and maintaining, as well as interactive “tour” with XBox with Kinect. Even though we just missed the traveling exhibit, it was still very much worth the time."
,,My favourite museum,5.0,,"This museum houses really great works from artist around the globe! My favourite exhibition has to be the recent display of works from Monet & Manet. They always have new and exciting upcoming exhibits and prices are very reasonable!

Apart from housing works of art, the building itself is beautiful. From the marble staircases to the lovely arches. If you are looking to practice your architectural photography, look no further!

I will definitely be back sooner rather than later !"
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"A well organised gallery with friendly and helpful staff. We were there for a couple of hours before flying out of Singapore and was certainly worth going. Many interesting exhibits. Not expensive, if your over 60 take some ID. Get a discounted entrance"
,,superb architectural conversion,5.0,,"spent hours wandering and admiring, the range of art is dynamic but excellent. It's just across from the Padang, so right in the heart of Singapore. It's made from 2 existing colonial-era buildings, which have been joined together with real flair and innovation in both architecture and engineering. Not too expensive, about $30 each ($25 for concessions) for all exhibitions. I would also recommend going to the Asian Civilisations Museum, just a short walk away, especially the Tang Shipwreck Exhibition"
,,Magnificent building,5.0,,We were lucky enough to see the Impressionist exhibition in relative peace and quiet. You could spend days there. Ask for con session tickets if you are a senior .
,,Starting ground for first trip to sinapore,5.0,,Great place to get an understanding of the development of the city. Gives one an overview of how this city and island came to be. Easy to get to and a beautiful building. Download the app to get most out of the tour.
,,A light space filled with many delights,5.0,,Wonderful architecture encompasses thousands of pieces from across the ages. Truly breathtaking. We loved our visit from start to finish.
,,Great history tour,4.0,,Wonderful usage of the old Supreme Court and Court House Buildings. Very helpful staff able to give an insight into some of the paintings and artefacts Bit of a walk from the rail stop Good blend of old and new art.
,,Fabulous Gallery with amazing architecture,5.0,,We were amazed at the services available at the National Gallery. The guided tours were excellent & readily available and the automated iPad tours were handy & easy to follow. The buildings were beautifully joined to become a gallery with amazing light and open spaces for events. Thoroughly enjoyed the Local Artists exhibit as well as the guest exhibition of Impressionists from the Musee D’Orsay in Paris.
,,Architecture/Art/History,5.0,,"If you love all of the above this is a must see! We also took the free one hour building tour, great explanation of the two buildings both former and joint new design and also the historic events that took place there, learnt far more than just wandering around. Interesting mix of art too. Great views of Marina Bay and the dome from the rooftop, shame the bar was closed when we were there, could have sat there for hours!"
,,Visit the rooftop restaurant for a great view,5.0,,"We visited the national gallery to see the impressionist paintings. I love galleries that involve the visitors in some activity that creates beautiful memories. When we entered, there was a room to the left where a large silk cloth was hung with shiny thread spools that you could use to embroider a small wish! Excellent. The impressionist exhibition was not large but still impressive. Again there were activities where kids could try their own impressionist art with crayons. We then reached the top restaurant on 6th floor and enjoyed a great evening with brilliant view of Singapore."
,,Learn about Singapore,5.0,,We had a delightful Singaporean Lady guide who gave us not only the official version but personal insights that were informative and entertaining. Well worth the time and to help understand how and why Singapore works as it does.
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Visited this museum mainly for the ongoing Juan Luna exhibit, but discovered much more, including the small but information-packed gallery on Singapore's evolution from a British colony to an independent state and the galleries devoted to Southeast Asian art. Would've spent much more time if not for my aching feet! Their complimentary audio guide is comprehensive and easy to use. Very helpful staff also."
,,First class attraction,5.0,,"When I visited this stimulating gallery, a temporary exhibit featuring Monet, Renoir and Manet was being featured. The explanatory signs were simply outstanding -- to the point that I returned the next day to visit again. The Gallery offered free admission for two days of Chinese New Year!

What I found particularly helpful about this gallery was the engaging style of the security personnel. If a guard saw you were genuinely interested in a piece (I was in the classical Chinese section), I was approached more than once and offered a helpful English translation of the Chinese words on the art piece -- which I really appreciated."
,,Great Art Museum,5.0,,"Large, spacious museum with many fine art galleries and several restaurants. Besides Asian art, during our visit there was an extremely interesting exhibition of the most famous Impressionists. Definitely worth the visit."
,,Beautiful building with art exhibits,5.0,,There’s different exhibits occasionally. The newly renovated building is much brighter and more beautiful. They have a small nursing room. One can go up to the roof top to have a great view of Padang and it’s surrounding area for free.
,,Interesting art and great views from the top,5.0,,We really enjoyed seeing some different art and the views over Singapore from the top of the building were excellent.
,,Fantastic -- in and out,5.0,,"On our way to the Asian Civilizations Museum by foot we stopped only to see the Raden Saleh paintings in the Impressionist exhibit and left 3 hours later vowing to return on our next visit. We only had time to see the extensive, well-organized (by colors) special """"Century of Light"" exhibit (closing in March 2018) and part of one floor in this gallery that combines 2 government buildings. Staff at various entry and crossover points readily help you navigate the two buildings. When we were speculating on the ownership of one piece that appeared to be on loan, the guard gave us the history of that painting. There is a nearby metro stop, discounts for seniors, and a lunch counter. The only disappointment was the small museum shop that had limited selection, especially of books."
,,Impressive!,4.0,,"The building itself is already impressive enough, information counter and and guides were easily found in it if help is needed."
,,Not impressive permanent collections,3.0,,Not impressive permanent collections. In my opinion very few items was great. IT is rather historical overview od local Art. Not worth 20$ to see IMHO.
,,Monet and the Impressionsists,5.0,,"I saw an advertisement for the Impressionist exhibition while in Singapore so decided to visit. There is a good discount for seniors, even non residents. The gallery is an amazing building though not designed as a gallery so it can be a bit hard to find your way round. Having been sent to level 5, I eventually found the exhibition on level 3.
There were 65 Impressionist and pre & post Impressionist paintings from the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and as the gallery wasn't busy, it was ideal for spending quiet time with each work and read the very interesting and detailed notes from the curator without hoards of people pushing and taking selfies.
The number of works by Monet was impressive and there were also works by Manet, Renoir, Seurat, Corot, Gauguin, Berthe Morrisot and so on. And these were not all minor works but well known with a Monet of Rouen Cathedral and several of the water lilies at Giverny.
Just before the exit there was also some old film footage showing Renoir, his hands severely crippled with arthritis still painting in old age, and Monet in his garden at Giverny, painting one of his water lilies works.
I decided to have lunch at the café and had a very good and reasonably priced salad. A pity the coffee was awful!
The exhibition is on until March 11 and well worth a visit if you enjoy the art of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."
,,Splendid!,5.0,,"First off, we only had two hours to spend at the museum before making our way back to our hotel to retrieve our luggage and go to the airport. And in two hours, you barely skim the surface. This is the type of attraction that could be an all day affair. The pricing was fairly complicated the day we went (there were two special shows), plus there are various discounts that might apply. We opted for the two special exhibitions only ... which was a wise decision, because there really was no time for anything else. The French Impressionist exhibition was absolutely perfect. The write-ups on the walls condensed a great deal of knowledge and observations into a readable and compelling paragraph or two for each room. I learned more about Impressionism from this curator's thoughts than I did from the entire rest of my life. The show traces the pre-Impressionist style through the various artistic styles over the years. Plus, the paintings they had on display were diverse, numerous and so powerful to look at. The guards are a bit overly predatory as far as catching free-loaders, I thought. So, have your sticker out and displayed prominently.

I wish this museum was in my home town! I would go regularly."
,,You can spend hours in this museum!,5.0,,"This museum seems endless, with different wings and several floors. I have seen many fabulous exhibitions here. For me, they could have exciting temporary exhibits more often than they do now.

What I don't like is the way successful exhibits are organised, like the one from the polka-dot artist. I understand that the big number of visitors has to be regulated, but they way it was done, making people wait for an hour and then chase them through an installation in 5 seconds was really crazy.

You're a professional museum; please study the managing of visitor streams more and deeper and find other, creative ways to make the visits more agreeable."
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,"This is a really impressive space, with a fair number of exhibitions on. Maybe it’s because I haven’t been to a museum in Singapore in years and therefore did not know what to expect. From the moment I stepped in and was greeted by the very helpful information services crew to the layout of the museum and the quality of the exhibitions; I wished I had visited earlier
and had more time to see more than one exhibition. Definitely worth a visit"
,,Finest of Art in Asia,5.0,,"We had only one day for the National Gallery, but one could spend weeks in this remarkable building and museum. You can enjoy ancient and classical and modern and experimental art there. It is easy to feel at home with the exhibits. The staff in the gallery is very attentive and goes out of their way to assist you to find your preferred pieces. This is a must to see in Singapore!"
,,Quite a Decent Collection,5.0,,"Literally stumbled across the place, and it was nothing short of awesome. Even had a Impressionist exhibition, as well as an exhibition by two Asian artists heavily influenced by the Europeans."
,,"Great experience,visit also terraces on floor 5 and 6",5.0,,"Unique building! unusual presentation of art,you can select your favourite pieces,mail them and print out as poster back home. The fifth floor exhibits an outdoor bamboo garden and is a wonderful place to relax.On the sixth,the top floor the terrace provides a wonderful view of the skyline and the Marina."
,,Brilliant combination of two very different buildings,5.0,,"Admire the French architectural genius who has merged together two very different buildings, the old Supreme Court and the old Town Hall.
He has, provided ( inter alia) a marvellous art gallery that offers a permanent collections which highlights artists of the last 200 years drawn from the entire region . But also has very generous spaces for special exhibitions of great quality. This spring for instance there is a brilliantly curated exhibition of French impressionists operating in the final quarter of the nineteenth century. Whilst almost all these paintings are owned by the Musee d’ Orsay in Paris, only a minority are on regular display there, affording a unique opportunity to admire some very fine works that seldom see the light of day.
Great gift shop and cafe, plus up on the top floor a maze for adults to lose themselves in. Completed only in 2015, this is a single building now demanding a visit."
,,A Wonderful Surprise,5.0,,"Visited The National Gallery to see Colours of Impressionism masterpieces. While the exhibition is an amazing display, we were pleasantly surprised by The Building Highlights Tour. Arriving at 10:30am, we were offered the free highlights tour beginning at 11:00am. Patrick, our guide for this extraordinary tour, was a wealth of information. Do not skip, if you have time."
,,A wondertul place to visit but take your time!,5.0,,"We loved this place but you had to walk a lot to see everything! It was well set out and good explanations with the pictures. There is a wide variety of art, and some of the newer multi sensory pieces were really interesting.
It was one of the few places that gave free access for a disabled person and a carer, and this gave access even to the special exhibitions.
Food seemed expensive there!"
,,Extraordinary - but take your time!!,5.0,,"The sheer conversion of the former Supreme Court and City Hall into the entity of the National Gallery is mind-blowing. The area is VAST and the ingenuity and style and taste are impressive. There is a stunning yellow-ish metallic cover that stretches over what was the 'gap' and tumbles down to fall a canopy at the entrances on either side. There is a roof garden gallery with a huge pool and a transparent base, so from the floor below you can see up through it. There are smart walkways connecting the two wings. Elsewhere, though, they have simply let alone some beautiful original architectural details - pristine, honeycomb wooden ceilings, a rotunda like a mini British Library Reading Room - and you can look down on its white domed roof. Etc etc.

I THINK we did a pretty good job in terms of viewing. We covered quite a lot of Far Eastern contemporary art, but spent substantial time over two excellently curated special exhibitions: 'Century of Light' - a tribute to Impressionists both major and minor with a heap of works borrowed from the Musée d'Orsay and deftly arranged by theme; and 'Between Worlds' - a joint retrospective of 2 formidable, yet lesser known artists - Raden Saleh and Juan Luna (from Indonesia and the Philippines respectively) - again curated with panache - Saleh presented on lapis walls with gold lined archways between the various chambers and Luna on scrumptuous pink walls also with the gold embellishments. Stunning!

What else? Incredibly helpful and polite staff/custodians - impeccably clad in neat grey and black uniforms.

But give yourself PLENTY of time. In retrospect I would have spent a day and taken lunch at one of the many restaurants that also pepper this wonderful wonderful labyrinth.

A highlight of my month's tour of Malaysia and Singapore."
,,A must for anybody interested in art,5.0,,"The old City Hall and Supreme Court have been joined to form the National Gallery. The Supreme Court building has been left as it is for historical reasons. The refurbishment has been done with taste and it is a first class venue for an art gallery. There are some very nice pictures of Singapore as well as contemporary pictures, which are edgy. Not many world class pictures exhibited though."
,,"Excellent Art, Special exhibit and building",5.0,,"We visited to see the Impressionist Exhibit, but greatly enjoyed the free one-hour tour to see some of the highlights in the permanent collection. The tour helped a lot, as we certainly would never have understood the back-story and significance to the art otherwise. In addition, the tour talked about the history of the building and some of the features, which was very interesting. The temporary Impressionist exhibit was excellent."
,,The architecture itself is attractive enough for a visit,4.0,,"The National Gallery is composed of two heritage buildings connected with modern glassy architecture. There are different exhibition halls located on different floors. a small gift shop, a few small eateries and a bar.
I went to the Century of Light exhibition, which told the story of Impressionism through the colours.
There is Light to Night activities at night time, which a street fair in front of the Gallery. Yet, the light on the Gallery exterior is not fascinating."
,,Lovely museum through and through,5.0,,"The National Gallery at the Old Supreme Court displayed a huge myriad of Asian art pieces and the amazing colonial interior and exterior.

I absolutely loved the choir in the old court room and the extensive collection of Javanese and Southeast Asian pieces throughout the museum. Would visit again, definitely."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beauty night with the free light show and free gallery entrance for the event of monet. Weather is warm because is just after rain. Sitting at the padang.
,,The place to hide away from rain,5.0,,We went during the rainy season and it seems like a good place to escape the rain. Thoroughly enjoyed the wide range of art and also the building itself is an artpiece. Definitely worthwhile!
,,Make this a destination,5.0,,"Even if you are not interested in the art collection, this ""Gallery"" is worth visiting for tow reasons. The first is to see how two national monuments, the Supreme Court and the old City Hall, were put together to form a stunning new home for the artwork. The upper level that encases the dome from the Court house is an absolute must see. You will not be able to take a bad photo.
The second reason are the fabulous selection of restaurants within the Gallery including the one in the gift shop."
,,Lovely Museum,5.0,,Walked to the museum to see Century of Light and some of permanent collection. Museum is not to be missed if in Singapore. Lovely space for the art. There is a quiet peacefulness as you wonder the permanent collection.
,,A real piece of architecture art!,5.0,,"The museum itself is a piece of architecture art, combining two old buildings with a complete new and modern architectural concept. The art collections are also very interesting, as we saw there classic Chinese, Malay and Singapore art, modern Asian art, together with an extended collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist from Orsay Museum. Plus, inside the museum, there is a very good Asian restaurant called National Kitchen, which I fully recommend. The museum is quite large, so it is wise to plan minimum 3-4 hours for it."
,,"Century of Light - showing master pieces from Monet, Renoir among others",4.0,,"We pop in the museum just because we saw that some masterpieces of Monet and Renoir were there. Nice gallery, with coloured wall galleries."
,,World Class Gallery,5.0,,The architects have seamlessly combined the old with the new to create a beautiful and functional building. Of the many different rooms and exhibitions the Asian art section is one of the best. Staff and very friendly and are happy to chat to ensure your visit is enjoyable. Highly recommended.
,,Lovely Building - Super Calm,4.0,,This is a very special renovated and repurposed old building with large open spaces and an excellent rooftop bar & restaurant. The gallery spaces are well laid out with not too much squeezed into the spaces. It is a very tranquil and relaxing place. I had a great afternoon here.
,,Too expensive,1.0,,"I was so excited to visit this. But as a backpacker on a budget I was so disappointed to see that a tourist price was double that of places such as the national museum. It meant I couldn't actually go in. They didn't even have a decent student rate!
So disappointing that activities like this seemed exclusive."
,,Visiting Art shows,4.0,,"The national gallery is an amazing building (old court house) and the visiting exhibitions well laid out. The rooms were not too cold and the staff directed you where you needed to go and explained what you could and couldn't do. Such as photos without flash.
An enjoyable break from shopping or sightseeing.
There is good history information about the building and grounds. Along with several floors of exhibitions we did not see."
,,"Enjoy the collection, enjoy the architecture.",5.0,,"Went to see their special exhibition ""Century of Light"". A great collection of Southeast Asian Art. Enjoyed the Raden Saleh & Juan Luna exhibition."
,,See the Impressionist Exhibit,5.0,,"If you're an art fan, you will love the Impressionist galleries. Unlike other museums elsewhere, you can get walk right up to these paintings to admire the use of colours, brush strokes, and textures. You can even take photos of the works. Most paintings also had information about the work, the artist, and sometimes the style used. Even my wife, who has no art education, was ""impressed"". Suggest visiting on Friday night so you can venture to the top level to get a fantastic view of Marina Bay, the Central Business District, and Marina Bay Sands hotel. Be sure to ask where each wing of the exhibit is located because the signage is poor. And, if you are a Singaporean or permanent resident,venture to the office across the hall from Ticketing to get an annual unlimited entry pass. It's one of the best deals in town."
,,Incredible diversity of art exhibits and activities for all ages,5.0,,"A must see in Singapore - beautiful collection of South East Asian art as well as temporary exhibits. Interactive family art workshops, conferences.
The City Hall and Supreme Court buildings have been transformed into a marvelous visual arts center. If I lived in Singapore I would become a member and go often. Great dining and café areas too."
,,The place to learn Singapore's history,5.0,,This is the first place you should visit if you are interested in Singapore's history or art. This museum also display great exhibitions from from the world well-known artists.
,,Came to See Luna,5.0,,They had a special exhibit featuring the works of Filipino artist Juan Luna. It was beautifully curated.
,,Superb!,5.0,,"I definitely recommend to visit this place, totally worth the money. I could spend all day in this gallery. The staffs are so friendly and helpful."
,,Definitely Worth a Visit,5.0,,"Whether visiting or living in Singapore, this is a highly recommended place to visit. We just went for, probably, the 4th time. This time to see an Impressionism art exhibition on loan from Musee D'Orsay in France. Paintings from Monet, Manet, Cezanne, Renoir and many others were exhibited. What a treat!"
,,So much to see!,5.0,,"We visited on Christmas Day - free entry for a public holiday - but it would have been worth the entry fee.
Wonderful building that has had alterations to ensure that visitors can view the old as well as the new.
Some old masterpieces from Monet, Renoir, and exhibition of the
Gallery’s Histories and Transformations.
Well worth a visit."
,,Very good,5.0,,This gallery contains some beautiful art in the permanent exhibition. We were also lucky enough to see a special exhibition of European and Asian art that highlighted some brilliant Indonesian and Filipino artists. After visiting this gallery I am a convert to Asian art. There is a great view from the top floor that you should not miss. However I suggest that you miss the cafe on the bottom floor that is below average for Singapore.
,,New Gallery,4.0,,"This Gallery has only been open a couple of years. Easy to access from Raffles Place MRT (5 min walk past St Andrews Church). The conversion of the former Supreme Court has been magnificently done and the Gallery (when we were there) had an Impressionist Exhibition, an Indonesian display and 15 galleries of Singaporean & Asian art. Do as much as you can, the guides seem to be senior citizens and well worth chatting to re information about their City and their Gallery. Take your concession cards and they are recognised in Sinapore. An enjoyable to spend some time in an excellent art space and cool off!!"
,,Culture and a great rooftop view,5.0,,"Housed in two classical 19th century buildings united under a super modern glass roof .
Current special exhibition on Impressionists with works by Monet and Manet among others, slightly surreal feeling of looking at scenes of French rivers and winter countryside while in a tropical city.
The gallery with works by Indonesian artist Raden Saleh and Philippine artist Juan Luna of the same period is well worth a visit. Their portraiture is stunning as well as their inclusion in the exhibition giving an educational aspect of art and cultural historical development that I for one was totally ignorant of.
A visit to the Sky bar is also highly recommended for the brilliant view of the city and its ultra modern architecture sprinkled with 18th and 19th century classical buildings together with sight of ships sailing off between the islands. The cocktails are very nice too!"
,,Excellent gallery.,5.0,,"The National Gallery is a wonderful building. Light airy and with some excellent art on display. We visited during the Impressionist exhibition and were greeted by an excellent collection of art displayed in a very informative way. The gallery is a fine way to spend an afternoon, even if there is no special collection on offer. To finish your visit, there is a good restaurant and the shop has some very interesting gift."
,,Nice gallery in great setting,4.0,,The gallery building is nice since we enter the building whether from the main entrance or the side entrance. Experiencing the flowing space is great as the new modern gallery is built between two heritage buildings. I suggest visitors to spend at least half a day to enjoy the gallery and all the collections. Highly recommended to visit.
,,Great arvhitecture,4.0,,"I really enjoyed the buildings, especially the Rotunda in the Supreme Court building. Go up to the top deck for great views of Marina Bay Sands. The art was interesting and is nicely curated."
,,Very Modern Building with an Exellent Art Colletion,5.0,,"The Impressionist exhibition we were priviledged to view was a truly memorable exoerience. The works of great artists (Renoir. Monet, Manet, Matisse etc,) along with the great collection of Asian artworks, made our trip to Singapore most worthwhile."
,,First Class,5.0,,We weren’t expecting to find Monet in Singapore but get in quick because there’s an excellent Expressionists exhibition at the National Gallery of Singapore until early next year. This relatively new gallery is truely world class. It’s a great place to visit to escape the Singapore heat.
,,"Interesting Art, Interesting Buildings",5.0,,The security guards help make this a special experience. A number of them know the story of the art they watch and tell you about it. Also the remains of the Supreme Court Chambers are worth a look
,,PERFECT FOR A WET IR SUNNY AFTERNOON,4.0,,Singapore can be a tough place to visit when it's hot or rainy! Use the National Gallery as a good pit stop away from the blistering sun or the torrential downfall. Decent exhibitions both free and paid.
,,Great gallery,5.0,,We spent 1/2 a day and it’s a fantastic gallery! We’ll be back; went in a tour which is free and v helpful
,,Nice place to enjoy art and history,4.0,,"Very nice building architecture, I'm impressed at how the 2 old buildings were restored and joined together. However the navigation around the place is a little complicated but still fine and I didn't get lost.

A great place to escape the heat and enjoy some art and Singapore history.

This place is not suitable for young children - you do not want to risk breaking anything inside."
,,French Impressionists,4.0,,"Came here last weekend to see the French Impressionists collection from the Musee D'Orsay. On previous visits to Paris the queues to this gallery have always been insane and so I've never had the opportunity to see the art inside, so it was good to have the chance to see some of it in Singapore. A relatively small exhibition but interesting nevertheless. Surprisingly not too busy when I visited on a Sunday afternoon - possibly because people were out shopping."
,,Great museum for art lovers!,5.0,,"We saw the Colors of Impressionism expozition with great paintings of Monet, Renoire and Cezane, but also some contemporary asian art. Not crowded in a weekday , nice arhitecture!"
,,best indoor tourist destination in Singapore,5.0,,"Amazing buildings with interesting history (ex-city hall, Supreme Court), some of which has been preserved inside, and the buildings bonded by a cool huge modern atrium. Fantastic collection of Asian art, plus when I was there they had essentially raided the Musee d'Orsay of dozens of its impressionist paintings for a special exhibit. Could spend many hours here if you like history or architecture or art."
,,Awsome,5.0,,My friend and I went there and we couldn't get over it it was terrific so much too see this is a must see for anyone who wants to learn about Singapore
,,Majestic building both inside and out,5.0,,This building is the recycled former City Hall and Supreme Court restored very tastefully. It is the home to the largest collection of modern asian art in SE Asia. You could spend days wandering the many halls and galleries and probably still not see it all.
,,"Don’t miss, especially on a hot day!",4.0,,"Wonderful air conditioned gallery perfect to chill out for a few hours, wide range of art to keep most people happy, good coffee shop on the ground floor as well, recommended."
,,History of Singapore,5.0,,"A recent visit to the Singapore National Gallery was an eyeopener! This Gallery is about 2 years old and there are two wings to it connected by walkways. One Wing was adapted from the Old Parliament House and the other wing was adapted from the Old Court House. The three main takeaways(and there are many):
1. It gives a very interesting history of Singapore: how a Nation was built.
2. It gives an excellent history of the Japanese occupation of Singapore: what, why and how it happened.
3. Special exhibits."
,,World class,5.0,,"Was here while they were doing an exhibition on impressionism. Excellent collection of Monet, Renoir, Cezanne, etc. Was very impressed by how it was laid out and the summary explanation by each art work The summaries were informative and jargon free. They were clearly written by art lovers who wanted to share, as opposed to wanting to show off their brilliance. Which is unfortunately too common in the museum world. There was also a wonderful exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and art. If you have interest in the arts this is a can't miss."
,,Art lover must-go place,5.0,,"If you love arts, this place is highly recommended place. A lot of beautiful painting from various famous artist and from many countries. A lot of unique statue also. They also have skygarden with some restaurants. I recommend this place for all travellers."
,,LOVE THIS PLACE!,5.0,,"I love the National Gallery of Singapore! The place is huge and nice! They even have this interactive digital screen which you they can email your favorite art (photos, paintings,etc). Once we finished going around, we went to their rooftop bar to have a few drinks."
,,Rooftop bar on top of the gallery,5.0,,"Recommend by my Singaporean gf , it was an impressive gallery , we came here for the rooftop bar which was in this gallery , nice view from the bar here and can see marina bay sands from here . Had some drinks and lovely place to hang out with friends"
,,must-see for art fans,5.0,,"Wow, if I'd know how good - and huge! - this place is, I'd have allocated it a whole day!
It really wasn't what I expected - it's mostly a modern art museum (everything is from the last 200 years, and about 2/3rds is from the last 100). This means that it's fairly easy to relate to for people whose art history education is purely western (eastern and western art starts to converge around 1920 and converges almost completely by 1970).
I love that this place is game to show contemporary art that would be regarded as too controversial in many parts of Asia (albeit with an amusing 'covers racial/religious themes and may offend' warning placard) - its collection of Asian contemporary art is by far the best I've ever seen.
There are lots of free (after you pay the entry free) tours (more than are advertised on the website), I did the South East Asia highlights tour and really enjoyed it, it added so much to my understanding - ask for directions to the sign-up desk when you buy your ticket.
Tickets for foreigners are rather pricy, but cheaper if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass. But if you only want to see the architecture, you can walk around all areas except the galleries without a ticket."
,,Amazed at the quality of works by Singapore artists,4.0,,"My friends and I found out that Singaporeans and Permanent Residents enjoy free entry to the Singapore National Gallery's permanent exhibits recently when we brought an overseas friend to visit it. It was a first visit for all of us and we were pleasantly surprised at what we found. The friendly staff recommended a tour starting from Level 2 so we took the lift and made a beeline for it. We spent about 2 hours admiring the beautiful oil paintings that reflected a wide range of styles from realist to abstract. Some of the sculptures were also quite interesting. There were water fountains and baby care rooms which were very visitor friendly. Some paintings had commentaries that gave deeper insight into the political context or historical background on the work. Best of all, photography without flash was allowed and thus we could bring back memories of our favourite paintings and sculptures. The map provided a quick guide to where Not To Be Missed paintings were located so it made navigation a breeze."
,,An interesting visit,5.0,,"i came alone last wednesday and i spent a very long time in the gallery itself. presenting itself with many different exhibitions about singapore’s past and present, i took many interesting photos of the exhibits and would definitely bring my friends here next time."
,,Chose Not To Go In,3.0,,Upon reviewing the Galleries fees we noticed if you were a Singaporean it was free. As a tourist we would have to pay $20. We weren't impressed. Didn't mind the $20 but didn't think there should be segregation between tourists and general Singaporeans. Shouldn't Singapore be proud to show the locals and tourists alike what Singapore is all about? Walked away.
,,Mysteriously empty...,3.0,,"This is a follow-up review, having visited previously during the opening month where entry was free and a large number of galleries were in development. On this occasion we were required to pay an entry fee. A guided tour in English, predominantly about the history and architecture of the constituent buildings, delivered by an expatriate Brazilian architect, was very informative. The complex, however, is quite empty of visitors, even school children, and mysteriously there seemed to be less exhibition space or works on display then in the opening month. Nonetheless the buildings themselves are magnificent and worth the revisit."
,,Amazzing,5.0,,Hit up the rooftop bar on level 5 for a buffet lunch and phenomenal cocktails - the havana club is my pick
,,Wonderful building and displays...merit more than one visit!,5.0,,"Wow! This newly renovated building complex is stunning in itself...even apart from the exhibits.
We took the one hour guided tour with Jenny, our very knowledgeable guide, who took us through the old Courthouse and then the Municipal building which have been woven so cleverly and beautifully into one National Art Gallery. The central atrium, joining the two, with its amazing glass draped ceiling is a free open space, worth seeing on its own. But pay the entrance fee and learn from the tour some of the history of the founding of Singapore, how the court sessions were conducted, see the holding jails, and then some of the important events in the political development of the country...all fascinating.
In fact we spent so long on looking at the actual buildings and history that we had little energy left for visiting many of the actual art exhibits! I personally thought the new Impressionists exhibition, our original reason for the visit, a little disappointing. But we will certainly be coming back to see some of the SE Asia art, glimpses of which were amazing.
We didn't have time to venture up to top floor either for the food and the views!
But what we saw on our first visit was quite amazing.....don't miss it!"
,,Art appreciation in sumptuous simplicity.,4.0,,"Finally had a chance to visit this former courthouse when we went to a wedding lunch at the in house restaurant on the top floor - which serves great meals with equally great views of the civic district.
It would be hard put to imagine that this gallery, part of a complex was a court house and a city hall, a testimony to the refurbishment work done.
Besides the rich history of events that have taken place here, now there are the local themed art on display. The garden on the second floor is simple yet grand. Vestiges of its original use have been tastefully integrated, like the rotunda with its cupola and the various chambers, some with Corinthian and Ionian columns.
There are exhibits for the young, and did I mention that the external is imposing as well? Walk around an take in the atmosphere.
Great way to spend a half day.
Enjoy!"
,,Wow - this needs at least a day,5.0,,"What an impressive place, the building itself is an exhibit to be savoured.
There is an awful lot here and preparation is needed beforehand.
I took advantage of a free guided tour which was very useful. Unfortunately I did not have enough battery on my phone for the e-guided tour.
The exhibits are outstanding, although planning and research is needed to really appreciate them. I guess I will just have to go back.
Take a warm top with you as the air con is very efficient.
The coffee shops offer a good range of hot and cold food but are probably a little small if it gets busy.
The gallery shop has missed a trick, as unlike most other galleries and museums it did not sell souvenirs relevant to the displays or exhibitions.
It is now on my list for my next few visits, butI will need to do it piecemeal"
,,Morning well spent,4.0,,"If you have an interest in art or asian history I think you will enjoy a couple of hours in this gallery. I know a fair bit about European art but next to nothing of Asian traditions so this was eye opening for me. A highlight was the gallery of Wu Guanzhong's work and the chat / lesson I got from the woman who was tending the gallery. Really enjoyable talking with someone who is passionate about their work!
I had another interesting conversation with the attendant in the Supreme Court chief justice's old room which holds the original articles of Singapore's independence as well as Queen Victoria's initiating charter.
Outside of the collections, the buildings are fascinating and the roof top bar has a stunning view of Marina Bay (and nice beer)."
,,Very nice museum,4.0,,"Located in the former Supreme Court and City Hall there is already the advantage of a nice surrounding. Part is free, another part requires an entrance fee. The collection of Asian art is interesting and nicely displayed. It was very quiet and the staff is very helpful.
For the Dutch tourist the large painting with the tigers by Raden Saleh is especially interesting. It was presented by the artist to king William III in the 19th century, then disappeared into an attic and recently carelessly and heartlessly sold by the present royals to this museum. As national heritage it should of course have stayed in Holland."
,,Lots to learn,3.0,,"Lots to learn and lots to see. Was interesting, glad I have been there and done that. Unsure if I would return if I had the chance to."
,,Wonderful gallery,5.0,,"Do the tour of the building, it's most interesting. So pleased these two buildings have been saved and repurposed as this wonderful art gallery. Look up at the glass ceiling with water running over it, go up to the roof garden ! Amazing engineering !!!"
,,A good place to spend few hours,4.0,,"The building of the national gallery is beautiful. We wandered around, listened to a small concert, I understand that there are small concerts happening all the time. Had some drinks of the roof terrace, which was fabulous."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beautiful culture to absorb. Another amazing tourist attraction - Singapore keeps showing off with their awesome attractions.
,,A well curated arrangement for education,5.0,,"The development of Singapore's art reflects the character of the history. The works include historical documents and art arranged in old courts within the complex which has been very well modernised.
I thoroughly enjoyed my visit, learning a good deal about this communities diversity and traditions, and thought that the school groups visiting were well engaged and responding well to the questions posed by the works.
One charming aspect is that the way the custodians welcome you to their allotted galleries."
,,Excellent gallery and exhibitions,4.0,,"Bought my ticket online in advance of my visit. It wasn't the simplest process but don't be deterred, a visit to this gallery is well worth the $20 fee. From the architecture of the two buildings, the myriad of art on display to the very helpful staff, this should definitely be on your visit list. I went on a Sunday and although there were people around the gallery never felt crowded, there was always room to stand back and absorb the art. Whether it's Chinese art dating back many years or modern Asian art from the 1980s, there is something for everyone. There are some exquisite water colours from the 1960s to oil on canvas paintings where every brush stroke can be seen. Don't forget the buildings too. The City Hall with it's large hall to the Supreme Court with it's cells and courtroom. There are ample lifts so going from the basement to the 5th floor is no problem. Escalators and stairs also link the various floors. There are restaurent and cafés if you fancy a bite to eat. I ate in the Courtyard Café where the service, food and price were all good. Enjoy"
,,Great Building,5.0,,Decided to visit this place. The restoration of the building was excellent. Enjoyed seeing the different artists work.
,,Loved visiting this gallery!,4.0,,"First time we tried, however, it was on a Saturday and the crowds were mind-blowing! There was live music in the entrance, and people could sit on the stairs and listen. What a wonderful idea! Since museums are free for Singaporeans and school children are strongly encouraged (required?) to visit at least once before they finish school, holidays and weekends are pretty busy. During the week, however, its much quieter. The restaurants at the top are very impressive as well, and offer an amazing view of the Marina bay waterfront."
,,Must go to in Singapore,5.0,,Many exhibitions ongoing. Lovely place to go to with kids as well. Loved the ink art from the Xiu Hai Lou collection.
,,"A lovely place, good displays, pity signage is so poor",4.0,,"We visited and were perplexed to find the ticketing was not well signed...visitors pay for entry in the basement! Not well signed at all. Apart from that confusion, the views from the roof are wonderful and the food and drink facilities are of high quality. I love how the joining of the two buildings is so symbolic."
,,Interesting place with lots to see,5.0,,"Finally visited this gallery and it is beautiful. There are plenty of art pieces for you to admire up close (not too close as there are personnel at every exhibition hall to monitor you) just behind the metal barrier or a black line asking you not to cross it.

You will need an entire day to complete 70-80% of the museum and if you start early you may just cover them.

Aircon is cold so will be good to bring a sweater/jacket along especially if you are spending a long time here."
,,"Brilliant new meets colonial building, first rate SE Asian art collection",5.0,,"Enter via the main door (facing the cricket ground): it is a breathtaking renovation, old meets new, soaring walkways, meticulous detailing. In fact you can walk through a great deal of the renovated Court House for free, and that in itself is worth the journey. There is a charge to enter the galleries: which have a wonderful collection of ""modern"" SE Asian painting. Going here after walking around the colonial area reveals the story of Singapore, and the incredible pace of change from a sleepy village in the late 1800s, to what it is today. Absolutely recommended (and if you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass, take it for a discount!).
And PS, for older Asian art, held down the road (10 minutes walk) to the Asian Civilisations Museum."
,,"A few pieces worth seeing, but not quiet enough to enjoy it",2.0,,"I love visiting art galleries and museums during the weekend. As much as I absolutely loved the National Museum, I thought I should try the National Gallery: very bad experience. If like me, you like looking at the art in a quiet place to really feel every piece, avoid weekends! Hundreds of kids running around screaming, with only a few parents that know how to supervise their own. Staff talking and laughing in the ""adult"" galleries. Regarding galleries, 90% are affiliated to local banks... still unsure how I feel about that."
,,"Lovely building, not much art",1.0,,"Where is the art in the gallery? We saw a few rooms with a few pieces but most of the main rooms were closed for ""installation"". The building is impressive but the art is not. Not worth $20 entry fee."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"It's not easy to find art in Asia in the way we find in the West, therefore this place is a true heaven to approach and understand mainly Southeast Asian artists. Truly worth a visit while visiting the city."
,,better than the British Museum...,5.0,,"THE GOOD: newly opened, majestic architecture, centrally located, easily can spend 4 hours there exploring, bonus: have one of the most elaborate kids' play area that will keep ur kids occupied for hours...

THE BAD: long queues @the ticketing booth,
many floors so navigating maybe a problem...

TIPS: go early to the Counter & sign up for a free guided tour by the Docent...U won't regret it!!!"
,,Beautiful renovation of two old government buildings,5.0,,Worth a visit to admire the history of the old City Hall and The Supreme Court. The architectural joining of the two is quite beautiful. On top of the fascinating history and stunning architecture there is an Asian art collection spanning centuries. Great day.
,,Excellent free building to wander round,5.0,,"Not much in Singapore is free but this is a free activity if you like architecture and not so much art!

The gallery itself you have to pay for, but the building and the architecture is free to look at and explore! There is a fantastic free kids play area also.. highly recommend for a fun free day out with the kiddies!

The art is also good if you care to pay to visit the galleries, but the art is for sure not the main attraction to this fantastically renovated, beautiful building full of history! (Great restaurants and bars inside too!)"
,,Children Biennele with 2 kids,5.0,,"Definitely a place to bring your little ones to explore arts although it can be a bit intimidating for them, but with the children's festival, kids love exploring the surrounding living in the COURTHOUSE feeling and playing around with colours.

It is free for all locals although a ticket is still required and the whole place is a maze for you to explore."
,,Beautiful Art and Architecture!,5.0,,"Great collections and special exhibits! GO! Visit the web site to make plans, worth the ticket price"
,,"Great buildings and layout, art was hit or miss to me, great bars on the roof",4.0,,"The is a joinder of two buildings key in the past of Singapore. It merged the historic City Hall with the old Supreme Court buildings into one Gallery. There is so much art to see, it was kind of overwhelming. I could not find a great directory of the art itself. The staff was not overly responsive when asked questions. I read though that there are free tours, but I did not check them out.

I really liked the building though, a hugely expensive project done right, by merging these two older buildings. There is a cool picturesque courtyard and water feature on the open roof on the 5th floor and there are two cool rooftop bars looking East over and towards the view of the Marina Bay Sands area and Bay. One bar, Smoke and Mirrors is very popular right now.

You can go see the court holding cells and also how the architects masterfully joined the two buildings. One of the galleries now (Gallery One) was an old courtroom.

Worth a quick visit if you are a tourist, longer if you are an art fan. Also, great views and vibes from the rooftop bar and restaurant.

There is a famous restaurant there called National Kitchen by a very well known chef, that I did not get to check out. It is part of the National Gallery property though.

Oh, as you leave, it was hard to find a taxi. Even though there is a taxi stand at the Gallery, not taxis were there. So I walked a block to the two hotels there and there is a taxi stand there."
,,Awesome,5.0,,Lovely public spaces! Pricey for foreigners to visit galleries but lovely free public space indoors to admire the architecture.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,What a lovely way to spend a calming afternoon. Modern and Romantic with a lot of history as well to explore.
,,Great Gallery. Take a free tour!,5.0,,"Loved this place. We meandered around for a while and then went on one of the free guided tours, which was excellent. I'd recommend checking the website for the details of the times and the different tours and languages. The tours are included in the entrance price and can focus on the art or the history of the buildings or both. Well worth a visit, even if you're only in Singapore for a day or two!"
,,Very good,4.0,,"I was thrilled to hear about the Yayoi Kasuama exhibition. The whole architecture of the building was absolutely amazing. I loved all the different types of art and structures. I did not like the layout of the exhibitions because it was very confusing and it was hard to go around due to lack of directions. If you went for the whole day I would advise to bring a camera, food, although there is a restaurant, and some extra money to go into the new exhibitions. I think you need half a day to enjoy the museum. There are lots of things to see and lots of really fun exhibitions for young children. If you have a disability there are lots of lifts for access."
,,disapointing,3.0,,We were not impressed by the collection. Besides that it is a bit of a confussioning building(s) which makes it hard to find your way through it. Would not go there again
,,Kusama exposition,5.0,,As soon as we arrived in Singapore we found out about the presence of an exhibition on kusama. so lucky! great show and many works. perfect then to refresh yourself from the humidity of Singapore (but remember a sweater to wear inside)
,,Beautiful and Interesting,5.0,,"waouh! it s was the best place of the day
and what a good surprised
it s a superb museum with really interesting collection located in an beautiful building but it s a place full of life with live music, special arty experiences and lab
so Nice
i recommend !!
an Hot Spot"
,,Wonderful,4.0,,Really enjoyed my first time visit to this manageable size museum. Wonderful building and the exhibitions were good too
,,Lovely exhibition,5.0,,"I visited National Gallery with my husband mainly for the children's biennale: what kids dream, art creates. It's really nice and we enjoyed ourselves. Be prepared for queues if you're there on a weekend. Highly recommended if you have an afternoon to spend.

Sincerely,
DX and Ruby"
,,Management need to step up - this could be better,2.0,,"The national gallery is ambitions, it has the bones for a great centre and even may change the broader society.

But at this stage, it's a monument to inadequacy. I know that's a harsh statement, but there is something fundamentally wrong here.

It's not that the galleries are sparse, some have great examples of Asian art - others are a collection of ""things"" which are seemingly unconnected.

The building is beautiful, but really difficult to navigate.

The staff are unfortunately clueless and more interested in having a sneeky peek at their phone than helping visitors.

This could really be great, and I'd love it to be so. I've even joined the friends of the gallery. So meet us halfway and get the staff thinking about art and customer service."
,,Must Visit by Tourists - Beautiful Interior,5.0,,Review by Dr Sim. Recommend visit by tourists. Converted buildings. Used to be the Supreme Court. Beautiful interior. Many local paintings. Nice walk through. Regards DrSim001.
,,Explore investing in the Insider pass,5.0,,"If you plan to visit a very popular exhibition like Yayoi Kusama, and it had reviews of long queues, consider buying the Insider Pass. It costs a little more than the normal tickets, but is valid for 12 months and allows you to skip many queues thus saving plenty of time!"
,,Gigantic Historical Building,5.0,,"If you have a few hours to spare and would like to discover more about Singapore's pre-independence years, you can walk around this new, air-conditioned building filled with interesting, historical exhibits. The museum guides are very helpful and will show you around the many galleries available. Some even shared with me their personal stories while I was browsing the gallery. Some of the highlights for me would be the bridge connecting two segments of the building, former holding cells and structure of the court. Many paintings depicted lives of Asian civilisation as early as 14th century, and how much they have moulded and influenced Singapore to become what she is now. Do check for the entry fees and concessions eligibility!"
,,How Singapore became Singapore,5.0,,Make sure you visit the National Gallery to check what it took to make Singapore a world class city country.
,,full of history beautifully displayed,5.0,,a wonderful building in the old court house- wonderful engineering on show- spacious so it feels like you can go at your own pace- a very good collection from the region. well worth a visit- and its cool.
,,Interesting exhibition!,4.0,,It was our first visit to the National Gallery and wanted to visit the Special Exhibition the Yayoi Kusama: Life is the Heart of the Rainbow. So so Awesome! my 6 year old also enjoyed some of the display from the exhibition :) This gallery is conveniently located walking distance from the City hall mrt. Entrance is free to some of the gallery but for special exhibition like the above - a fee is applicable. Clean and spacious!
,,Freedom Expressed,4.0,,There are many art pieces on display that reflected the turbulence period when Singapore was under the colonial rule and towards independence in 1965.
,,Great visit!,4.0,,"I first came to know of this when I was googling for places to go with my girls aged 6 and 8 during their centre closure days. Keppel art centre was in 1 of my list and when my elder girl saw my phone. She pointed to the Yayoi Kusama's work and told me that her teacher has recommended them to visit the place. Hence I brought them there on the first day of sept hols. However, to their disappointment. Most of Kusama's exhibits had been closed. However, luckily there was still the keppel art centre and the children's biennal.

Overall, my girls had fun at the national gallery singapore as there were activities for them to play and learnt.

Recommend this place even with children along."
,,Amazing Kusama-Exhibition,5.0,,"Went there for a solo exhibition of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama. Very impressed! Also enjoyed the the architecture of the Gallery, the historical documents (Singapore's Declaration of Independance) and pictures and the outside pond. Nice coffeeshop as well."
,,Really well done,5.0,,"This new Singapore National Gallery is really well done.

It is housed in two old colonial civic buildings which have been spectacularly restored and modernised into a state-of-the-art gallery.

We only had time to see the part of the gallery that covers Singapore Art, both modern and showing earlier origins. It was beautifully presented and the guides were both helpful and friendly.

It would take several visits to the place justice. If you are only have time for one visit make sure you go to the rooftop to see the spectacular views over the city and Marina Bay.

There are plenty of eateries in the Museum, including more formal restaurants on the rooftop."
,,National Museum of Singapore,4.0,,"a must visit place in Singapore if you wish to learn more about history of Singapore, Student will get discount also."
,,Loved the Colonial Architecture,4.0,,Splendid colonial architecture with a modern twist. The Gallery is oklah.... architecture was my interest. The old courtrooms were interesting too. Foreigners pay $15 (seniors) or $20 entry. Easy to find. Short walk from City Hall MRT.
,,Yayoi Kusama,5.0,,"We went on a Sunday afternoon and tickets were soldout! Best to buy tickets online. I just didnt know how to go about it.
Anyway, we went Monday at 10am and the crowd started growing. We were able to use the coupon 15% discount from the gift shop.
Was so happy to see Yayoi's works. I only knew of her because of my sister's recommendation. Then was happy to see Filipino masters artworks in the Gallery- nice!"
,,One visit is not enough,5.0,,"To fully enjoy National Gallery Singapore, you will need to visit a few times. The exhibits are well thought out, housed in an old courthouse, and display the history of Singapore and its neighbors. The special installations are fun but require queuing and getting tickets. Yayoi Kusama's exhibit was bold with dots and lots of colors, although a bit dizzying at times."
,,❤️dren's Biennale 2017 | National Gallery Singapore❤️,5.0,,❤️🎉👏Explore and Gain insights into the creative vision behind Gallery Children's Biennale and the dreams and stories that inspired the artworks on this exciting docent-led tour.❤️
,,Loooove it,4.0,,"I traveled with my friend, when yayoi kusama held an exhibition. Loove the interior, and they have spacious room"
,,Lovely architecture,4.0,,"Love the gallery - beautiful architecture and layout.
Went for the Yayoi Kusama exhibit ($25 for non-Singaporeans) - luckily we bought our tickets online first because even at 10AM the lines were massive.
The exhibit itself was great, but it wasn't nice to be rushed along or given 15 seconds (supposedly 15, but felt more like 5) to view certain installations.

The gallery should instead cut down the number of visitors instead of rushing along paying customers who want to enjoy the art. I understand it's a popular exhibition and queuing for each gallery (7 in total) is expected, but it's not fair to give so little time."
,,Children's Biennale,4.0,,"Historical and beautiful building, can easily spend 4-5 hours going thru the 4 levels of art work. Held Children's Biennale, worth the time."
,,The best! My favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,"The building is just so beautiful and so many sections which we can wonder around with children.
I have visited when it opened and later as well.
Some of venue changed and some shop closed since opened but still it is a nice place to spend time if you are wondering around the city.

They have open day sometimes and anyone can go in free.
They also have some musicians and concert in the premises.
Children's education area is fun and nice as well.

The view from the top floor is wonderful and there are many place we can sit down and relax."
,,Visual wonders!,5.0,,"I was fortunate enough to visit the Singapore while the Yayoi Kasuma - Life is the Heart of the Rainbow was in exhibition. There are numerous works that cover the special exhibition galleries. Some of the exhibitions included the iconic dots, infinity rooms, pumpkins and artwork. The Infinity Mirrored Room - Gleaming Lights of Soul was truly remarkable. Since this attraction was very popular there were long queues and everyone is allowed in groups of 3s for 30s to allow everyone to have an opportunity to visit. Some galleries feature a number of intricate designs and artwork that you can enjoy. The dot room is also limited to a number of people each time and you can take as many photos as your heart desires. You can also view the pumpkin through a small window and see the remarkable creations Yayoi Kasuma has created. This exhibit runs until September 3rd so don't miss out!

I also visited the Children's Biennale which also features some amazing exhibits. It features the work of nine artists. Yayoi Kasuma has an amazing room which started out as white but as everyone adds stickers the room has taken a magical turn. Another room worth visiting is the Homogenizing and Transforming World by Teamlab which features a number of balls that change color as you touch them.

Other than the special exhibits take a walk around and explore the portraits and the magnificent building. If you are visiting Singapore, you should definitely add the National Gallery to your list.

The nearest MRT is City Hall which is just a short walk away. The lawn outside is sometimes host to outdoor festivals and provides a lovely view of Marina Bay Sands. It is free entry to the main galleries to Singaporeans and permanent residents. It is S$20 for foreigners to visit. The special exhibits have a cost of S$15 for Singaporeans and permanent residents and S$25 for foreigners to access the special exhibit only and S$30 for an all access pass."
,,Great gallery! see Yayoi Kusama now!,4.0,,"There is a current exhibit by Yayoi lusaka, which is brilliant, go see! the other galleries are beautiful, especially the classical ones."
,,Visiting the building and artworks,5.0,,"Very well refurbished buildings comprising the Old Supreme Court and Old City Hall were used to recreate this wonderful art museum where displays of South East Asian artists are featured.
You can see the old chambers of the Chief Justice and in the city hall, the venue where singapore ''s independence signing ceremony took place ."
,,"Surprise, surprise",5.0,,We were fortunate to visit when there were two exhibitions open in addition to the normal displays. A great to place to wander around in the heart of Singapore.
,,Yayoi Kusama exhibition - the first major exhition in Southeast Asia,4.0,,"An outstanding exhibition of Kusama's work well displayed at the National Gallery. A small gift shop offered a selection of artist related items, cards, umbrellas, etc."
,,World Class. Congratulations NGS Team,5.0,,"We avoided the weekend and visited the Yayoi Kusama exhibit on a Monday 10am. However it is still clouded for art museum traffic. There's limited tickets allocated per day, therefore it is best to book it one day in advance online to avoid disappointment. There is a free App that you could download for audio guide on your mobile phone. The admission fees for this special exhibit is S$15, truly value for money for 8 galleries and a few hundreds signature installations and art piece. The Kusama exhibition is well curated, and service staff are polite and well informed. General displays are FOC. For parents there's an added bonus of Children's Biennale till 8 Oct, whereas the Kusama will end soon on 3 Sept. Hurry, don't miss it! There's a handful of eateries in the Gallery from high end to affordable quick meal, you could easily spent half a day here for meaningful activities."
,,A Visual Worldclass Celebration of Yayoi Kusama,5.0,,"This is an absolute must see if you are in Singapore up to 3 September, but you should buy tickets in advance to avoid the queues, best on weekdays. The large exhibition is split into four different sections and the curation is the best we have seen in Singapore, actually it is one of the most enjoyable exhibitions we have seen for a long, long time. Kusamas unique talents with dots, infinity rooms and exploding colours makes her in a class of her own, and one of Asia's most influential artists. Download the free app. covering the National Gallery and enjoy the commentary about Kusama. Highly recommended for all the family. I should add that the National Gallery Singapore occupies two national monuments: former Supreme Court and City Hall, where the renovation has been done superbly."
,,Disappointing,2.0,,"Our second visit to the museum, this time for the ""blockbuster"" Kusuma exhibition. We thought it lacked quality compared to the Kusuma exhibition we saw in Madrid in 2013. This was made worse by the lack of flow to the space as a whole already observed by other visitors and the fact that you were made to queue for each of the 4 separate spaces over which the exhibition was divided. We left after 10 minutes.

The patrician facade of the original Supreme Court is still magnificent. The permanent galleries have some interesting paintings and things relating to the history of Singapore but are poorly organised. Noting the amount spent on renovating the building and the fit out, the results are disappointing. You would be forgiven for thinking the priority was given to sticking a few expensive (and not very good) restaurants into the space and the exhibits were an afterthought.

No pictures for this review as none deserve uploading."
,,Nice,3.0,,"We visited an exhibition here which was great-- yayoi Kusuma. The building itself is huge, spacious ,nicely lighted up."
,,"Kusama's dots, infinity rooms, narcissistic balls & riot of colours!",5.0,,Cool exhibition. Must visit if in Singapore. Spaced out over 4 separate galleries. My 10 year old Daughter was mesmerised by the dots and bright colours. Queues for the infinity rooms but well worth the wait. Try visiting on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowds.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Love this museum. Not to big and not too small. Collaborations and shows are a mix of popular culture, historical and contemporary art. Facilities are great and popular restaurants of various cuisines are located within the museum."
,,Wonderful Art Collections,5.0,,"A free morning on a quiet Monday found me wondering what to do before a lunch appointment.
As I was at Singapore's National Gallery, I decided to look into the visiting exhibition of the amazing works by a Japanese artist, Yayoi Kusama.
The Gallery was beautifully structured, light and airy with plenty of room.
The exhibition was amazing, highlighting the turbulent life of the artist, her successes outside Japan, her fears at social rejection inside her homeland and the wonderfully hypnotic use of colours and line drawings.
An exhibition not to miss!"
,,Beautiful building,5.0,,"Came here for the Yayoi Kusama Exhibition.

I find the building is very rustic and beautiful. It was huge and clean, they maintain it so well. They day we came for the exhibition, they also have the outdoor light celebration where they use projections on the buildings to tell a story. I didn't stay for the whole show though, too hungry after exploring the exhibition.

All in all, a great place for art exhibition. Staffs were friendly and accommodating too"
,,Visual feast,5.0,,"The gallery is housed in two renovated buildings - City Hall and the former Supreme Court, in the Civic district, near St. Andrews church. As we were short on time, and my husband visits art galleries under sufferance, we opted to visit the special exhibition Yayoi Kusama's ' Life is the heart of a rainbow'. What a visual treat we were both in for. The exhibition featured over 120 works across differing media including the infinity rooms. I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone attending by describing the exhibition other than to say that in the US, people queued for hours to see and experience this. I'm glad to say that I am one of the fortunate ones to have experienced this."
,,Magnificent building & art,5.0,,I really enjoyed my visit to the National Gallery. The building is amazing and we really enjoyed the visiting exhibition by Yayoi Kusama. I would highly recommend a visit on your next trip to Singapore.
,,Contemporary art at its best!,5.0,,"The museum offers a large selection of modern art which also provides a historical perspective on Singaporean and South East Asian art.

The exhibitions were well organised and the interactive exhibits (at the Children’s Biennale) were enjoyable even for those only young at heart xD.

It’s worth taking part in the docent-guided free tours. We took part in the building tour and the UOB/SEA gallery tour and both were very educational and fun!

At the time of our visit, the exhibition by Yayoi Kusama was on and it was a remarkable experience.

The interior of the building is very well done with an interesting modern connection of the two historical buildings. In addition, the rooftop view is superb. We definitely recommend a visit here."
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,"This placed can be visited via MRT, bus or taxi. If you take MRT, you need to alight at City Hall MRT Station ( red line ) and walk there ( about 500 metres )

I visited this place with my friends. At that time of the visit, there was an exhibition going on.

In the Gallery, there were many beautiful art pictures. If you are a person who is passion about artworks, well this place is really suitable for you. If you are hungry half way, don't worry as there is also a fine dining restaurant in the gallery as well. There were many tons of artworks displayed at this gallery.

The staff at the gallery was helpful and friendly as they guided my friends and I through out the gallery visit."
,,Very disappointing renovation,2.0,,"We were very excited to see what Singapore had made of the old City Hall and the Supreme Court renovation.

The Supreme Court is much more successful interms of renovation with much of the original interior intact. Nice job. Very good exhibition space as well.

The City Hall is a disaster unfortunately. Poor signage, horrible waiting time for the lifts, horrible low ceilings, a ""rabbit warren"" of corridors and totally unsuitable as an exhibition space. It's obvious a huge amount of money has been spent but honestly if this is the result then god help us. Quality of the materials is good but this supposed to be about an exhibition space!

Staff were helpful. Nice exhibit on the history of the building."
,,Long queues for Yayoi Kusama,4.0,,Here for the Yayoi Kusama exhibition. There was a long queue to buy tickets and only 2 people attending people. One of these left for a while. Could have done better there. After seeing the artist my wife wanted to view the rest of the gallery but they wouldn't allow us to pay the difference for the full ticket we would have had to buy a complete new ticket. So we left. Yayoi was good though. Watch out there are queues to get into the exhibition and them more queues for some of the exhibits.
,,Fabulous building renovation,4.0,,"Two large old buildings which has been morphed into one modern building and simultaneously manages to retain the old features while blending with the new. A stunning job overall.
Good exhibitions but these cover a vast area and one can't rush around in an hour or two. Interactive areas for all from young children to adults.
Certainly will visit again"
,,Love this museum!,5.0,,"I totally love this museum! Used to think the museums in Singapore were not very 'fun' to visit but with the opening of National Gallery, I totally changed my mind. This is just my third time there and am always blown by the exhibitions. The service is also great. There is basically no 'wrong door' and every service staff at the museum seems to be able to give prompt and accurate information and service to those who are asking.

Went to the Yayoi Kusama exhibitions. Lines were properly managed and mood was light despite some wait time at some installations. Loved the inject of fun by the various museum staff at the entrances to each halls. My kids loved the exhibition though it was admittedly a little hard trying to describe the phallic symbols in her pieces.

First time trying the food at the Courtyard Cafe and was surprised by the standard of the dishes. Ordered the curry chicken and seafood noodles. Curry was spiced to the right amount of spiciness and the taste of coconut was to the right level without being too 'rich' in flavor. Only criticism was that the long beans that were placed in the curry seemed to be an afterthought. Noodles or rather kway teow were cooked through and kids loved the soft texture. Broth was tasty and ingredients were plentiful.

Will love to try Natural Kitchen by Violet Oon the next time there.

Spent a total of 5 hours here and didn't even noticed the time flying past. Will definitely be back again."
,,Interesting art showcases,5.0,,Staff were helpful in guiding through the ticket purchase process and the directions around the galleries. We borrowed a tablet from the Visitor Services room at Level B1 and went on our self guided tour which was helpful. Do remember to return the tablet at the end of the day before leaving. There are sufficient walking space among the artworks around the galleries.
,,Awesome Place!,5.0,,"I could spend a whole day here and it will still not be enough! Unfortunately for me, my visit here only last for 4 hours as my schedule was tight. Visit Yayoi Kusama exhibition which was thought provoking and also passed through some of the Children's Biennale which was fun. The structure of the building itself is a historial art and the view on the top was amazing at night. There's also a mock up of the old court room and prison cell."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Very interesting exhibits and lots of fun too. Good value for money and worth a trip. Tasty food in cafeteria but a bit pricey.
,,Gallery disappointing.,2.0,,One special display was worth seeing but the standard ones are very spread out and lacking in focus.
,,nice,5.0,,Very nice exhibition of dot design by renowned artist Yokoi. Good space for children and family to play with dot colour and room.
,,Great experience with great guide!,5.0,,"We were really lucky by the time we visited the gallery. Our guide was PJ. He guided us through ""The Incredible 5 Series: Sensorial Experiences"". The whole experience was really fun and engaging! I highly recommend any visitors to aim for the tour! If you have time and enjoy arts, please spend more than 3 hours. There are a huge number of art pieces in the gallery."
,,Good art,4.0,,WE happened to be in Singapore during the Children's Biennale and were lucky to visit this stunning building. Their in house paintings are lovely. Many diverse Asian artists exhibit here. The Children's Biennale was a bonus.
,,Magnificent.,5.0,,"Beautiful building, with helpful staff. Lots to love about this Gallery. Take your time as you learn ."
,,Good place to visit,4.0,,"5Aug 2017, 1st time to visit, the top of the building at 5th floor can see the nice view.
Due to 4-5 & 11-12Aug is special open until 12am, and free entry, except the special event then need to pay some, but still worth.
All over is good, And it have many seats for you to sit down when visit few hours, Let you feel relax...I will visit again !"
,,Great introduction to Art for kids at the Children's Biennale!,5.0,,Attended the children's biennale and the Yayoi Kusama Exhibition with 2 kids. There were lots of interactive displays and activities for children to participate. Lots of interesting themes for the children to explore and simply have fun with art. You can easily spend 3-4 hrs in the gallery and they have nice cafes where you can have a nice snack or lunch. Fantastic! Will visit again.
,,Outstanding exhibits in an amazing setting,5.0,,"This was a repeat visit and the building still dazzles me. It's on my itinerary for every trip to Singapore.
Unfortunately, the air con is extreme and uncomfortable and even the staff are shiveriing in their sweaters. It's also wasteful of energy to chill the building to such an extent -- more than is probably necessary to preserve the exhibits.
The extensive Yayoi Kusama exhibit was a delightful surprise for those of us not already familiar with the artist. I spent half a day there, and might have lingered longer were it not for the air conditioning."
,,Good gallery,4.0,,"I've been there in the afternoon on a week day and had to wait 30 min for the ticket. I recommend to buy it online. It is a bit pricey when compared to other museums/galleries in Europe.

Well structured and organized building and it covers mainly Asian artwork and paintings. There are some sculptures and other modern arts.

It has a bar with a nice view, which is worth visiting."
,,Great time at Childrens Biennalle,5.0,,"Went for the children's art festival. Kids loved the exhibitions as did the adults - especially the room with all the big light-up balls. So interesting and peaceful.

We bought the kids packs for $5 each and I was really impressed with them - loads of activities to do and included stickers to use in the obliteration room. I liked how the installations were spread around the gallery so we got a chance to see the amazing architecture and get the kids moving.

We went up to the terrace at the top of the building and had a picnic lunch (probably not allowed but the bar was closed and no staff around to tell us off). Fab views over the City and of that famous hotel with infinity pool.

Some people have mentioned unfriendly staff. All the staff we encountered among the children's installations were really friendly and welcoming. We did get lost a couple of times and walked through the quieter/more traditional areas of the gallery and definitely felt like we should be silent and did get glared at by a couple of members of staff. I actually think this is okay. You can't and shouldn't make everywhere 'kid friendly'. If I had been on my own I would have relished walking around those quiet, well-policed spaces just like libraries and art galleries used to be. I think they got the balance right here between welcoming families/the noisy and traditional presentation of art but I hope the welcome extends after the special children's exhibition."
,,"Great Exhibition, worth time and money spent.",4.0,,"If you like to take picture and upgrade you sense of art. This is your place. The exhibition is fun, and it keep me for 3 hours without getting boring, and I took a lot of great picture here.

The problem will be, theres not much option for food."
,,Great building; great exhibition,5.0,,I was lucky enough to see the Yayoi Kusama when I visited the National Gallery but honestly this gallery is worth visiting regardless of the current exhibitions. It is fantastic to see how they have joined the City Hall and the Supreme Court buildings together. I went on a week day and had no problem with crowds.
,,Yayoi!,4.0,,"Came here specifically for the Yayoi Kusuma exhibition that runs till september. It's a weekday so not too crowded, though there are still lines for the special interactive rooms

Well curated and arranged chronologically, the exhibits started from her early works with dots, to infinity nets, to pumpkins, to soft sculpture, to mirrors, to body, to love, to eternal/soul

Quirky genius

Best special exhibit by NG so far in the 2 years since opening"
,,Worth visit,5.0,,It kept us there more than 3 hours without boring. The place and the arts are magnificent. They have a special Yayoi Kusama collections now till 3 September 2017
,,Yayoi Kusama (Extremely rushed and way too many people),3.0,,"I really love the artworks. However, I think they have oversold the entry tickets. It was a Saturday evening which I understand would be a very busy period. However, when viewing the main exhibits, they tried to squeeze in as many people as they can into confined spaces and only allowed as little as 10-15 seconds to view it before being told to quickly leave even though it took us 15-20 mins to queue to view each main artwork. They should definitely limit the number of tickets sold in each timeslot so people can actually enjoy the artworks. I barely had time to take a look at some of them, let alone enjoy them."
,,"Be Dazzled by Yayoi Kusama's iconic dots, nets, pumpkins and infinity rooms!",5.0,,"There's so much to see at the National Gallery Singapore! I was there for Yayoi Kusama's art exhibition: Life Is The Heart of A Rainbow today, and I am captivated by her creative work. If you are in town, you should drop by. Exhibition till 3 Sep 2017."
,,Lovely Gallery,4.0,,"This art gallery consists of two buildings: the former City Hall and Supreme Court of Singapore. This fact alone would make it worthwhile to visit the National Gallery. With the numerous high quality art exhibitions inside, I must say this is a must visit attraction. But please note the opening hours. Mon-Thu, Sun and Public Holidays: 10am-7pm. Fri, Sat and Eve of Public Holidays: 10am-10pm. You need to pay entrance fee for each separate art exhibitions but there are free public exhibits too. There are also restaurants located inside too."
,,Spectacular Yayoi Kusama exhibit (until Sep only),5.0,,"The Yayoi Kusama exhibit is spectacular. It’s beautiful not just ‘cause of the whimsical dots, pumpkins, and colors. Mostly, it’s because the exhibit takes you on an emotional journey with the artist and shows you how vulnerability can create magic. Sadly, there is a long line for the third portion (20 minutes) and you can only stay in it for 20 seconds; I didn't get to view it 'cause we were rushing.
TIP: Bring a student ID for a S$5 discount.
TIP: Pass by the art connector going to the gallery, and witness how SG prioritizes art and diversity."
,,"Great Gallery, Nice Exhibition, but Poor Staff",4.0,,"National Gallery really a good place to enrich your imagination and inspire your thinking. There got lot of amazing galleries, not to mention the latest temporary international level exhibition - Yayoi Kusama exhibition.

However, some of the staff are not friendly enough to greet the visitors and really ruin our mood in particular way. Take for an example, some of the exhibition visitors are not allow to sit on the floor to take photo, but we just kneeling or put camera on the floor using low angle to shoot also be scolded. And when we walk around, we saw some of other visitors are allowed to do so, I bet that's the bad luck for us when that staff is in her bad mood. The in another gallery, we were asking for a direction to visit certain galleries, a staff is in her impatient attitude and walked away, we were left there without any respond, perhaps she was busy."
,,This is a gem of gallery,5.0,,"Whether you are focused on the art collection, special exhibitions or the unique architecture space (repurposed Supreme Court and City Hall buildings) this is an absolute must see when in Singapore. There is something here for all ages and tastes. Try some of the restaurants - reserve ahead of time for some - and definitely head to the rooftop terrace for a spectacular view of the Padang and Marina Bay."
,,Well spent Sunday,5.0,,"It was a well spent sunday at the gallery.
I enjoyed Yayoi Kusama's bold and captivating world of dots, nets, pumpkin, bold play of colors and lights and mirrors. Yayoi is a Japanese artist from New York who exhibits her work to different parts of the world and today we are lucky to enter her unique world of art.
I did enjoy other exhibits on illusions as well, specially the pieces of wood on the floor which appears connected and forms a chair at a certain spot when viewed from a distance.
My favorite Painting is titled "" Picking"" by Wee. The artists work showcased the play of light and shadows so well. I just love it.
One abstract painting that intrigued me though is the Black Afternoon. It was a product of imagination of a student studying abstract art. His painting was inspired the afternoon President Kennedy was shot.
How to get here? Take the City Hall MRT and exit B to St Andrew's Church.
Expect a long queue and bring along your student ID for a 5 SGD discount.
Tickets are as follows: Standard, Yayoi Pass Only or All Pass. We got All Pass since they are giving a good deal. For 30 Sgd, you will get an access to all the Galleries.
Note that Kusama's Exhibition will be displayed from 9 June to 3 September 2017 only.
See pictures below."
,,Rooftop gallery a great way to soak up Singapore,4.0,,Admittedly this was a quick visit for me after a friends recommendation to see the rooftop gallery. I had asked that if I only had a couple of hours to see Singapore what could I do and he had answered: Siak up the city skyline from the gallery. It didn't disappoint. I've since seen the view from Marina Bay Sands but enjoyed this 180deg view better because you could do many different elements of the Singapore city skyline from one vantage point and being on the 5 floor you feel closer and more connected to what's going on around you like sports on the fields adjacent to the gallery.
,,Outstanding New Museum and Historical Building,5.0,,Get here early when they open since there are long lines for tickets. This is museum is brand new and excellent in every respect. The galleries showcase outstanding Asian art and this historical building is fascinating.
,,Very colourful,5.0,,"This Gallery is very popular with locals and tourists alike. Consequently the line for tickets is very long and takes a long time to get through - we noticed that it stayed that way all day - which was a shame as we were exhausted before we began and quite disoriented on how to get to the exhibition we most wanted to see. As one of the guides said ""this place is a huge maze"". We were excited to see the works of Yayoi Kusama and were not disappointed. The exhibits were beautifully curated, though it became stressful figuring out which works could be photographed or not and, with huge numbers of people determined to get as many selfies as they could, made for very stressed museum workers. Next time I would try and go when it is quieter. Very unique and beautiful colonial building."
,,Children Biennale till 8 Oct - very stimulating for the kids,4.0,,"Excellent exhibits which even adults will find them enjoyable. Best to visit at 10am when the gallery opens as it will be less crowded and they allowed you to spend more time at the popular exhibits. If no time, just focus on the basement exhibits, which has all the 3 most popular ones. Then proceed to the Enchanted tree house at L1 for the kids to play. We spent more than 3 hours including lunch and Yayoi Kusama."
,,An impressive remake of old buildings!,5.0,,"The National Gallery is yet another addition to the long line-up of museums already existing in Singapore. What makes this one unique is the fact that it is a remake of two historical buildings recently renovated and turned into a single massive museum.

The structure used to house Singapore's Municipal Hall (opened in 1929 and later renamed the City Hall Building) and Supreme Court (inaugurated in 1939). As such, it had witnessed many significant events in the history of Singapore (like being sworn into office of its heads of state and members of the City Hall Chamber, the surrender of the Japanese at the end of WWII, and so forth).

The new Gallery was opened to the public only last November 2015. The architecture itself is worth a visit! There are areas of the museum open to the public for free (like levels 4 and 5, where you can have access to the former Supreme Court terrace and the Roof Garden with its posh restaurants), while a general admission is needed to visit some of its art galleries.

Aside from permanent exhibits, the gallery also holds temporary ones. I was very lucky to have visited the exhibit of the renowned Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama during my visit there last July 2017. If you're not into modern and contemporary arts, you may still enjoy the display of some old documents associated with Singapore's history as well as marvel at the technicalities involved in the architecture of the building itself, or simply relax in one of its cafes, bars and restaurants on the rooftop while relishing a wonderful view of the city (particularly of the Marina Bay area).

The general admission to the gallery (for non-Singaporeans) is only SG$20. Additional charges must be paid for temporary or special exhibits. To get there, you can take bus numbers 195 and 961, or take the MRT and get off at the City Hall station (which is a five-minute walk from the entrance to the gallery). Enjoy your visit!"
,,TAKE THE KIDS,5.0,,Thoroughly recommend taking the Family to this Museum. Plenty to see and interactive pieces as well.
,,Amazing Gallery,5.0,,"We went there on a Sunday for Yayoi Kusama's exhibition. Only another SGD 5 top up that allowed us access to all other galleries.

The Yayoi Kusama's exhibition was fantastic. Other galleries are amazing too. Walk over to the Supreme Court and admire the grand court.

The trip to the National Gallery is definitely worth your time. You could easily spend the whole day there.

However, be sure to be early to avoid the long queue for tickets to enter."
,,Not worth the price,2.0,,"I visited with a large group of friends, most of whom were Singaporeans. Admission was free for locals and permanent residents. Foreigners had to pay $20 SG. Some things were interesting, but overall not worth the $20."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"they had exhibition for children.
it is running now.

my kids spent 3hr+ and still didnt wanna go back to hotel.
it is worth it to buy SGD5 art package.
inside there is a sticker for sticker room(individual sale SGD2). and souvenir card for kids. Colour pencil, and post card that u can right and send to ur future(u can keep it in the green post box located next to ticket counter), and artwork sheet for kids.

it was gr8 experience for my kids."
,,A good weekend visit in air conditioned space!,5.0,,We were there with my 8 and 12 years old. They enjoyed the exhibition especially at the children bienniale. It's interesting to see how kids appreciate arts more than adults and in their own way. The place is spacious and airconditioned which is a good thing in sunny Singapore. We parked at Raffles City which is a short 5 min walk away. History of the building which is made up of ex Supreme Court and City Hall adds to the charm
,,Amazing work of Artist Yayoi Kusama,4.0,,"Yayoi Kusama's expansive creative vision is in display at the National Gallery from 9 Jun-3 Sep 17. An artist known for her iconic dots, nets, pumpkins and infinity rooms and her art, Kusama has captivated millions all over the world. Kusama used her creativity to walk through her depression. Don't miss dropping by at the National Gallery to view her artwork!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Went to Yaiyo Kusumo show which was wonderful. It was a truly remarkable experience. The gallery has a beautiful architecture and is quite impressive. Loved the layout , greenery views and the upkeep."
,,Marvelous Museum,5.0,,Take some time to enjoy the architecture of these buildings and enjoy the art shows at the Museum. Well worth the stop.
,,Must visit,4.0,,"Lovely place to visit, beautiful exhibits. We managed to get cheaper tickets as international students, so if you are too, make sure to bring some form of proof. Some of the older exhibits can be a little bit less exciting, but are quieter and can be enjoyed better."
,,National Gallery Singapore,5.0,,"What an amazing building with so much history and culture. Allow a few hours to absorb everything. Very educational for everyone. Easy transport to the gallery, a reasonable entry fee and provides close access to other major attractions and restaurants in the Clarke Quay area and in Singapore. Well worth a visit for history and culture enthusiasts."
,,Imaginative venue housing displays of Asian Art.,5.0,,"Combining the historic High Court and Town Hall buildings into a National Gallery was a great way to create a National Gallery. Large rooms allow for ease of movement between the rooms displaying a varied mix of historic and modern Asian art. We enjoyed the diversity of the media presented. It is a venue for all ages. Great informative volunteers were anxious to ensure we enjoyed ourselves with an enhanced understanding of displays. Beautiful venue, great restaurants on the roof all in the historic part of town."
,,An expensive failure...at present,1.0,,"After a lifetime visiting Museums and Galleries this has to be one of the most complicated buidlings and difficult to navigate I have ever encountered. At massive expense the High Court was recycled, but sadly the design leaves floundering visitors trying to work out where they are and where they want to go. It occasionally has an interesting show ( I have been 3 times) but my experiences have always been marred by the difficulty of navigation. I think they tried to keep too much of the Old Court at the expense of a modern gallery. Compared to the superb job of recycling at the Singapore Art Museum and the National Museum this does not work."
,,interesting collections of Asian art,4.0,,"I visit on a Saturday and went before noon. Even then it was a 30 minute wait to get tickets - a very slow process due to slow computer system, I was told. Still well worth the wait. I really enjoyed the Yayo Kusama exhibit. Everything was extremely well displayed. I also spent time wandering through the permanent exhibits which were interesting ranging from traditional to modern genres. Nice rooftop with cafe and great views.The building is historic and the staff were very helpful and informative. When I left mid afternoon, the crowds were 5 times larger with long waits for some exhibits, so go early."
,,Big gallery lack in content,3.0,,"Well structured and good effort in children's workshops but considering the lack of historical masters or the rather new art scene, the exhibits are rather limited. (Exception to paid/time limited exhibits).
The galleries are well illuminated, even better than some in Europe.
The building and surrounding area is good for photo taking."
,,"Nice River front location, excellent exhibaton spaces. Joyful visit.",4.0,,"Old building plus newer wings. Mainly, collection of local and Asia, interesting Gallery. Love their roof top green garden, a very nice view of HARBOR front view of Singapore. Enjoy visit this place after nearby MeriLion Park.
A good tour spot, can spend a cultured afternoon in this place, enjoy!"
,,Too crowded and crowd control lacking..,3.0,,"Visited National Gallery as part of Children's Season 2017.

Rightfully, it's free admission for citizens/PRs but we were directed to the queue for ticketing when what we later found out that there was another staff giving the admission stickers to whoever could flash their identity cards.

On a crowded and rainy day, that wasted like 40 mins of out time when this time could be saved if there were better signages put up. Definitely not Singaporean standard efficiency.

Other than that, the exhibits were quite standard, though stroller access / wheelchair access still needs to be improved."
,,Long queue for Yayoi Kusama exhibit,5.0,,Worth the wait. Not a fan of pop art but it is nice to experience the works of Ms Kusama. Students in Singapore can enter for free!
,,Wonderful art collection in a beautiful building,5.0,,I had an hour to kill before dinner and spent it enjoyably in the National Gallery. Enjoyed an installation consisting of numerous globes in an enclosed space and the orbs changed colour each time they were pressed. Also viewed the ink and water colour paintings of Chen Chong Swee. Many of the paintings were of scenes set in Singapore and neighbouring countries a few decades ago evoking a sense of melancholic nostalgia. There is a beautiful garden on the top floor whence one can enjoy beautiful views of the Singapore CBD skyline. A must-visit attraction.
,,Terrible!,1.0,,"Had a totally different experience at the Yayoi Kusama exhibit. Our visit was completely ruined by heavy-handed, officious staff!"
,,Yayoi Kusama Exhibit,4.0,,"I love how this gallery displayed Kusama's works. The lighting, music, ambience were fantastic. They also had good crowd control so that the exhibit will not be too full."
,,Padang deck,5.0,,"The gallery is beautiful- but after making your way around head to the top for the best view. Drinks are reasonably priced (for Singapore), and the food is ok."
,,Excellent Service and Exhibits,5.0,,"We visited the Yayoi Kusama exhibit. The arrangement, layout and service points were well planned. Reasonably priced for visitors. It was a pleasant visit for my family."
,,"Great for a few hours, escape the heat of the city.",5.0,,"Permanent exhibits themselves are excellent, and display art from around the region. The building itself used to be the Supreme Court of Singapore, and although some parts have clearly been restored, it's still a joy to walk around in. I hear the restaurants are good, albeit a tad overpriced- but nonetheless, for what I consider to be the best and most accessible gallery of Singapore, it's worth popping in, especially if you're in the area. The Fullerton/Asian Civilizations Museum is a short walk away."
,,Iconic historical gallery,5.0,,"Not just a place displaying exhibits, but a place that is itself an exhibit. Houses the former supreme/ high court, and many years before that a trading site for merchants, dating from 14/15th century.

Houses the largest collection of South East Asia art in the world.

Useful to have a docent, who explained that history of the place and the prominent pieces of exhibits."
,,an enjoyable morning,5.0,,"this was my second visit to the gallery.
purpose of this visit was for the special exhibition on yayoi kusama.

the exhibition carried some very representative and special collections, definitely worth visiting. one might expect to spending 1-2 hrs on this.
good to visit also rest of the gallery if time allows.

the ticket price for this special exhibition includes loan of a samsung tab for audio guide, which in fact offers just 8 sound clips, together for 15 mins. Not really something helpful to be honest.

special thanks to one of the ticketing office staff, Iris. She was always sincere and kind. She talked to me on the exhibition while the credit card payment was processing. For the last visit I made few months back, she encouraged me to join the tour guide too.

Lastly as a reminder, the special exhibition costs $25 for non-SG, while $30 for combo with gallery general admission. So if one gonna stay in SG for sometime, can consider getting the annual pass for $75.

last note, try visit in the morning as it tended to have more visitors after lunch."
,,National Gallery Cafe - overpriced and terrible service,1.0,,"$25 for the 'main dish' of the day that was a TINY portion, complete in 3 bites. Terrible service and they forgot to bring us half the order. Also, no tap water so all visitors are forced to buy plastic bottles. Overall terrible experience."
,,Art and Architecture,5.0,,"From City Hall MRT Station, take a 5 to 10 minutes walk to National Gallery Singapore. General admission (excluding special exhibition) is free for Singaporeans and $20 for non-Singaporeans. All-access pass (including special exhibition) is $15 for Singaporeans and $30 for non-Singaporeans.

The current special exhibition is YAYOI KUSAMA: Life is the Heart of a Rainbow. In order to enter this special exhibition, you have to book online in advance, queue for your admission ticket at Level B1, then queue for the respective galleries. Yayoi Kusama is hugely raved about, especially by the Instagram generation. However, I decided not to attend this special exhibition, since I felt the waiting time would be quite distressing.

Even if you do not go for the special exhibition, there are still many things you can see for free or with general admission. National Gallery Singapore mainly focuses on Southeast Asian art. National Gallery Singapore is also currently having a 4-months-long Gallery Children's Biennale, which consists of interactive installations all around the museum. There are usually queues and time restrictions (3 minutes per group) for Yayoi Kusama’s Obliteration Room as well as teamLab’s Homogenising and Transforming World.

Apart from appreciating art, you can enjoy beautiful architecture and history here. This was actually my favourite aspect of the museum. National Gallery Singapore is housed within the former Supreme Court and old City Hall buildings. The noteworthy features include Holding Cells, Chief Justice Court Room, Rotunda Library, Rotunda Library Dome, Former Supreme Court Library, Former Supreme Court Main Foyer, Main Dome, Tree Columns, City Hall Chambers, and Old City Hall Lobby and Steps.

With general admission, I spent 3 hours at National Gallery Singapore. I highly recommend visiting National Gallery Singapore for the art and architecture. You can even go on a museum tour, as there are many other prominent museums in the City Hall or Raffles Place area, including National Museum of Singapore, Peranakan Museum, Singapore Philatelic Museum, and Asian Civilisations Museum."
,,Beautiful collection,5.0,,Beautiful building and also beautiful collection the have. If you like paintings you should go there. We spent 4 hours here and still not enough time to explore whole gallery.
,,Highly recommended,5.0,,Spent 3 hours here. It was great. Even my husband who is not a huge gallery man enjoyed this. An escape from the humidity as well.
,,"Beautiful building, great Yayoi Kusama exhibition",4.0,,"Visited the Yayoi Kusama exhibition which was very interesting to say the least. Well worth a look. Make sure to book your entry tickets in advance.
The building itself is just beautiful and the rooftop gives you amazing views of the Singapore skyline. Nice way to spend a couple of hours"
,,Nice Place for Families,4.0,,I'm impressed with the amount of details and programs for kids as well. The whole ticketing area was extremely crowded in view of Yayoi Kusma's exhibition. Spend 5 hrs on the free galleries and still not able to complete them. Planning to go back again to catch Kusma's exhibits this weekend. Plenty if place to sit and rest. Don't miss the roof top where u can catch a nice view of the city.
,,Chic place to check out,5.0,,"Singapore converted this icon court house of history to a national gallery. So it is a very new place. It was converted in style. Perfect for couples, tourist and families with young children. There were so many exhibitions for kids. My kids favorite is the glowing light, walking on glass and sticky polka dots room. So much fun for adults and kids. So creative indeed. A must to stop by if visiting singapore. Singaporean are free, visitors are charge Sgd 20 per adult and Sgd 15 for children 7 to 12 years old. Accessible by bus or to city hall mrt station."
,,Over priced for foreigners,5.0,,"Wonderful, however, a shame they charge such a high fee for tourists. Museums in London are free - Singapore should follow suit."
,,Yayoi Kusama Exhibition,3.0,,"Came here today with the kids for the Yayoi Kusama exhibition. Ticketing process was very inefficient with quite long queues. Exhibition itself was interesting, although not really so suitable for younger children."
,,Massive queue for everything.,2.0,,Much larger national galleries know how go manage queues and ticketing much more efficiently than this place. You queue for everything like a glorified hawker center. There is no flow just pure frustration. Exhibits are good but the added frustration spoils it.
,,DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS!,1.0,,"I had a very traumatising time at National Gallery on Sat 17/6 afternoon with my 2 kids aged 2 & 5. Seeing the crowd at the Yayoi Kusama exhibition, I decided to explore elsewhere & headed to level 5; true enough, it was almost empty. My son was drawn to an exhibit with peculiar chopsticks & asked the Visitor Experience (VE) officer what it was. All he answered with a tensed expression was ""Please don't touch, move back"" despite being asking a few times. So my son went on to look at other things, before heading back to the other side of the same exhibit. The same VE officer, Sam, I noted, was wary & spread his arms to tell him off again. My 2yo was walking towards another exhibit & I managed to scoop her up. He then told me to ""control my kids"". I replied that he is not touching the exhibit & that he is merely curious. If kids are not welcomed at the gallery, please display a sign instead of treating them this way. I questioned if his attitude towards us was because we were locals?

This moment, another VE Officer dashed over, pointed to my 2yo and almost shouted, ""Please put it in the stroller and not let it move around and touch the exhibit!"" Well, excuse me. IT? Did he just refer to my 2yo baby, obviously a girl, as IT? I told him that kids will be kids, obviously he didn't raise one. He proudly claimed he did & his son is well-behaved & went on to criticise my parenting style. I noted he didn't wear a nametag & asked for his name & he said he didn't have to tell me. My kids were really scared by now & my son backed off to sit at the bay window, which has a parapet that you can obviously sit on. Sam went towards him to ask him not to sit there, I asked him why? I have seen so many people sit on such spaces & there is no sign. My son was scared by him and ran off. The older VE Officer, whom I later learned to be Lawrence, then menacingly shouted at me that ""If your son touch or damage anything, I will make him pay!"" before spreading his arms to go after my son. It was really dramatic. The security arrived & there were radio calls made.

After my son returned to my side, Sam told me that I have to stay and wait for the manager. Mind you, in a condescending tone, not in an apologetic attempt to try to salvage the situation. Lawrence even said that I was a disgrace & told his colleague proudly that he was going to the rescue of Sam. How heroic. I asked didn't his son move around? Was he handicapped? And he snapped & said that I insulted him - after all the rubbish he spouted about me! Well done, 2 grown men versus 1 woman with 2 young kids, what a shame on them! They behaved more like bouncers! Chatrine arrived & tried to understand the situation while escorting me down. She was very professional & reassuring but I broke down in the lift. It was too humiliating & traumatising for us. Zara later on met us to resolve the issue & was the epitome of professionalism as well.

When I recalled the incident to my husband in the evening, I was still very shaken & cried. My 2 kids woke up & cried in the middle of the night as well. So thank you National Gallery for this terribly upsetting experience. Please kindly:
1. Train your Visitor Experience Officers to speak properly & well. Obviously they don't have any exhibit knowledge nor manners to handle visitors & will only serve to marr experiences at the gallery. Their uncouth reaction was uncalled for & unfair to us. There are more professional ways to handle it. There wasn't even a crowd & they were so flustered! No matter how majestic the building or well-curated the art pieces, having such hooligans as your ambassadors is a shame on one of our Singapore icons. Please learn from National Museum; their security, staff & activities facilitators were all so well-organised & pleasant during our recent visit!
2. If children are not welcomed, please put a sign; families will thank you for it rather than to be treated like dirt! To think that you are holding the Children Biennale, it is truly contradictory.
3. Black tape looks swanky but is not a good enough deterrent; I have seen adults & tourists crossed the black tape to get closer to exhibits, yet they were not given the same golden treatment as us.

So parents beware, don't bring your young kids to National Gallery or you will get risked being treated likewise!"
,,A wonderful way to spend 2-3 hours.,5.0,,We went here on our last day; there is a fee to go in but this was not excessive. The history of Singapore was fascinating - I learnt a lot. It was well labelled and descriptive. Great way to spend some time in the air-conditioning!!!
,,Awesome Architecture,4.0,,"We went there for SMUN socials. The location was good and the tour was alright, but then again that is dependent on the tour guide you get."
,,An enriching experience!,5.0,,"We visited the Children's Biennale on a weekday and thoroughly had a ball of time at the National Gallery. Given that it's the School Holidays now, the crowd was very huge and we were glad to reach there early because the ticketing queue was very long.

Actually, if you just want the General admission tickets , you just need to go to the staff standing beside the ticketing counter to get a sticker after showing proof of citizenship (for singapore citizens). There is no need to join in the ticketing queue. It will save you a lot of time!

The hands-on activities were very creative , interesting and fun! it is a must-visit place of interest in Singapore!"
,,No mercy to elders. Nowhere to sit. Endless queues.,2.0,,"Went to see the Yayoi Kusama exhibit - which is amazing, unique and worth a trip to Singapore all by itself. But this was the worst organized museum exhibit I have been to in 60 years. Endless cues to get into each room. Nowhere for older people to sit down while waiting. Rude and imperious staff who don't seem to care . If you are going to charge A hefty entry fee, and require people to buy tickets in advance, then why don't you sell just enough tickets to fill the gallery. Why require people to wait in line for every room? And you will spend as much time waiting for Japanese tourists to finish taking pictures of themselves in front of the artwork, as you will spend standing in line."
,,"Don't miss the rooftop veranda, great city views for keen photographers",5.0,,Only scratched the surface of this gallery but what I saw was very interesting. The exhibitions had knowledgeable and friendly room guides and there is a series of guided tours also. .The restaurant was nice for hot or cool drinks or lunch. Opposite the gallery is St Andrews cathedral built 1861 but it was being renovated inside the day I was there so I couldn't go in. Another visit on another trip!
,,A must see!,5.0,,I have visited Singapore for the past six years and walked past these buildings many times. This visit I was finally able to get inside and take a look. It is open10am - 7pm. For visitors it is $20 to enter and well worth it. What an amazing place. The renovations are outstanding. The historical integrity of the buildings has remained in tack. The modernizations of the buildings is nothing more than impressive! I certainly will be heading back here again. It is so easy to navigate yourself around and the staff are beyond helpful. Thank you for such a memorable visit. I thoroughly recommend that you take the time to visit here. Head up to the top floor and take some selfie pics with the casino in the background overlooking the Singapore Cricket Club.
,,YAYOI KUSAMA,4.0,,I visited the National Gallery Singapore on 9th of June 2017 which was the first day for the exhibition of the art of Kusama. I was lucky to attend that exhibition before I left Singapore.
,,"A beautiful building, but lacking enough good art to call it a Gallery",1.0,,A stunning old building that has been preserved and developed with potential for something but so many long and empty corridors and doors and so little art work in the rooms they call galleries that it's not worth more than a walk inside the entry and then walk out to the Padang ...unless you are going to one of the restaurants upstairs. This building is a missed or messed up opportunity for Singapore.
,,Great views inside and out.,4.0,,"The gallery had some fixed and some transitory displays which admission was charged for. I wasn't particularly interested in any specific display so just wandering around suited me and this was great. I did manage to accidentally come across a hidden gem however. That is, there was a balcony area from which there were amazing and uninterupted views over Marina Bay. The rooftop display of copper artwork was well worth seeing and thinking about."
,,The old courthouse,5.0,,"Love how history lives within the walls of this place, where we can stroll into the holding cells of the past courthouse, while enjoying the history of the place, as well as being inspired by new art exhibited within the space! Every trip brings about breaths of both reminiscence and fresh ideas. Best to go on weekdays where there's less crowd!"
,,Beautiful art! Beautiful architecture!,5.0,,"Yesterday I spent my morning in the national gallery. Firstly, the buildings are incredible. Two years ago they finished a 10 year long full restoration and it's immaculate. It also offers a beautiful roof top garden with a full view of the Singapore skyline. A perfect spot for tourists snaps. Finally the art. So much art! All Asian artists and spanning from very old and traditional art to unique, contemporary art. I absolutely loved it. Every gallery had an incredibly helpful and knowledgeable employee to share and enjoy my experience with me. I learnt so much about the history of the building as well as the art in it. I've never had so much guidance walking around a gallery. I loved it. I highly recommend it."
,,Terribly lazy receptionist!,2.0,,"After we purchased our tickets, realized we have Kris Flier card in a different wallet, with which 25% discount is applied. We went back to the reception and asked for refund by whining the KF card. The receptionist refused doing so and said it is not acceptable as the cars must be presented before the purchasing. We did not feel any sense of collaboration or friendship at all from this receptionist woman. Are you sure Does it your statement represents formal policy of the Gallery? We know how easy it is to refund credit card payment. Didn't you say that since you simple do not know how to operate the credit card machine????? With her rude attitude our impression of Singapore dropped so much. National level of institute must hire much higher level personnel in my opinion."
,,Loved the architecture of the building,5.0,,"I loved the building, the architecture of it and the size is amazing. Really not sure about a lot of the art on display. I try to have an open mind but a lot of it makes no sense. They do have some excellent art work that is beath taking. Take a half day and explore."
,,Children's Biennale,4.0,,"The current exhibition runs from 20 May to 8 October 2017, if you have kids younger than 10 years old, it's a great place to spend a quiet morning with your kids during the non busy weekdays at the National Gallery. Lots of work on display from a wonderous colour forest with slides and story books to engage the kids to interactive display for colouring your own animals in the woods. It's def a school holiday event not to be missed. Entry is free for everyone of all nationalities."
,,Guided tours are the best way to enjoy a day at this museum.,5.0,,"Check out the website so you can take advantage of at least two guided tours when you come. The rooftop has the best view for photos. Better to avoi Sundays when the crowds are very large. Many children's actives until October, 2017. Great location to other activities and transport."
,,"Art, views, food, kids",5.0,,"Amazing place - you can spend as little as 1 hour or as long as few days, there are so many things to see and explore. If there is one place to see in Singapore, this is it!. This is where Singapore's most important historic moments took place and, being in the heart of the city, the Gallery also offers from its rooftop an impressive view of the new Singapore (skyline is breathtaking).The art collections of SEA and Singapore artists and the Chinese Ink exhibition are beautiful, the buildings themselves (it is hosted in the previous City Hall and Supreme Court) are just beautifully preserved and renovated and the architecture addition (the linkage between the 2 buildings, the attention to detail) are just impressive. Most probably also the best view of Singapore from the rooftop gardens whether this is during the day or as the night sets in the city lits up. Everytime I spend time there with my friends or family, we always leave recharged and inspired and with something new to talk about. At the moment, the Gallery is also hosting a Children Biennale with amazing interactive displays for children (I had to drag my 5 ys old out of the place!!) but even when the Children Biennale is not on, the Gallery has this Keppel Center for Art Education open to children to draw, craft and just be kids! I also tried few of the many dinning options there: Owl Cafe for local food or try the National Kitchen for Peranakan delights. You can also just enjoy a nice drink and some finger food on the top terrace at Aura. But just go your own pace, roam around, explore, go to the art galleries, take a rest, take photos, get lost in the building and just take it all in..I bet you will want to go again and again and again...."
,,Enjoy the building and artwork,5.0,,Make sure you attend the free building tour daily at 11am. The connection of the 2 buildings by French architect is most interesting. There are also tours of the art work in the galleries which was well guided.
,,Must do for art and architecture,5.0,,"I spent nearly 5 hours in the new National Gallery of Singapore. It is worth going for the building alone. It is a modern joining of the old Supreme Court and City Hall. Wonderful architecture and the old spaces including old court rooms have been beautifully restored and are now full of fantastic art. Less than 18 months since opening, it is immaculate.

The gallery people in the rooms, so silent in most galleries, are enthusiastically involved, pointing out special pieces and telling you about them, showing you the trap door in the dock coming from the holding cells, checking you have seen their favourite pieces in other rooms, sending you back if you haven't. Delightful, every one of them.

I took a tour to begin with which is well worth doing. A good blend of architecture, history and of course, art.

The collection is terrific. All Singaporean in the City Hall and South East Asian in the Supreme Court."
,,Lots of artworks for art lovers to appreciate,4.0,,Going to National Gallery without a fully charged powerbank is a mistake as there are many lovely artworks on display. Do note that there are always large groups of people who will not remember to turn off the flash on their camera and keep quiet while viewing the art pieces.
,,#childrenbiennale,4.0,,"We have been here for several times and it is because they have a lot to show but the best part are for children and right now #childrenbiennale is on going form 20 May to 08 October 2017 and there are a lot to do, see and be amazed. Children (my daughter and her cousin whom came visiting) will definitely enjoy themselve. Half day trip is not enought for us =D"
,,Great addition to Singapore heritage,5.0,,"This place is well run and worth a visit. It's awesome to be able to walk around the old Supreme Court rooms and read about the history of the court and also Singapore.

Seemed fairly new when I went - plan to spend a few hours there if you are going.

Staff were very friendly and helpful."
,,New exhibtions,4.0,,"The ticket counter was at basement one. For Singaporeans & PRs it would be free admission except for special exhibitions. Otherwise it would be S$20 per person or S$15 per person for old or young.

From 20 May 2017 to 8 October 2017 the museum would be having its first Children's Biennale.

Exhibition : LET YOUR IMAGINATION TAKE FLIGHT at City Hall Wing, Level 1, had a lot of hand on activities for children.

My personal favourite exhibition would be HOMOGENIZING AND TRANSFORMING WORLD
By TeamLab at Supreme Court Wing, Level B1, Concourse Gallery 2. The room was everchanging with different colored lighting around."
,,"Enjoyed the Children's Biennale, WILL GO AGAIN",5.0,,"Enjoyed a great day out (actually ""in""), at the National Gallery, when the Children's Biennale was on. The kids had a blast and so did we! Art, architecture, history, some activities, and food. I plan at least another visit, very very soon."
,,"Good exhibitions, very helpful staff",5.0,,"We saw some very interesting Singapore art here - the Gallery is in two parts and there's a lot to see. The entrance is big and airy - the tickets are sold downstairs, concessions for the over 60s (no ID needed) and free audio guides (photo ID needed). All the staff were incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the works on show. We were in there hours! Also a good café."
,,Wonderful introduction to Singapore,5.0,,"Great impressive collection in a wonderful building...Old federal building converted to museum with grand spaces, excellent regional art and great staff $20 entry seems a litlte steep"
,,Gallery for parents and children,5.0,,"304/5000
Visiting this gallery with the children is an unforgettable moment
Learning activities between parents and children become very fun

The gallery is very easy to reach. Get off the MRT City hall turn left and left again
The way to get there is very pleasant while looking at the cathedral church"
,,Excellent,4.0,,Staff is very knowledgeable about the place. Multiple galleries. Very good place to spend the day in Singapore. View from the top floor is excellent
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"What an amazing job has been done on the old City Hall and Supreme Court buildings to turn them into such a beautiful building to showcase art. The vast expanse of the buildings is perhaps a little too large.The art sometimes feels a bit overwhelmed by the buildings themselves but that may also be the point that visitors can marvel at the architecture and its beauty.
The only issue I have is that there were a lot of children visiting at the same time Andries to the almost open plan design their loud voices tended to echo around the place which was quite distracting when you are studying art and contemplating.
The guides who work in the gallery are very knowledgable and keen to share information,nothing is too much trouble.
Well worth a visit!"
,,Great way to expose our kids to art @ Art Playscape,5.0,,"We're thankful that the National Art Gallery has a free exhibition for the little ones, and of pretty high quality too. We loved that they were able to create a whimsical, ""Alice-in-wonderland""-esque fantasy land where our toddler can immerse herself and imagine she was in the stories that she had read about. She can read on and slide down the tree, read on and hop on the logs over the ponds, discover what the bunnies or tigers are doing at different corners/themes of this forest room. Would hate to see this exhibit removed. Once this exhibition is over, it should definitely be re-purposed to be a great playground at a library or a pre-school!

Overall, I feel this exhibit is different from the interactive and/or digital exhibits that most other museums have nowadays... it encourages more... imaginative play... something kids these days don't have enough of.

Though we didn't get to check out the other works at the gallery, the gallery's shop was a delight to bring home some unique, artistic and meaningful memorabilia that we don't see selling anywhere else."
,,A Huge Underutilised Area,3.0,,"Tip: Get tickets before roaming around the expansive area. You don't want to be turned away at the gallery without a sticker issued by the Ticketing Counter. SG citizens can bring along IC/Driving License for registration.

Personally, the huge space is best enjoyed in the night, and you can walk through the buildings with just your thoughts for company.

I do feel though that there is a lot of unused space on this piece of prime land. It is pretty much an empty gallery."
,,Lots of things to see,4.0,,"Spacious, lots of things to see, good selections of artworks, beautiful building, very good guided tours :-)"
,,Interesting and diverse.,5.0,,"The building itself is imposing and beautiful, and that's before you even get to the artwork! The art is displayed very well in the galleries and is diverse with both the permanent and temporary collections. The curators are friendly and very keen to share their knowledge. I highly recommend losing yourself for a few hours in this lovely gallery."
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"I love art and have always prioritised visiting the Singapore Art Museum (SAM) on my three previous trips to Singapore. This time SAM was closed for changing exhibitions, so I was pleased that the National Gallery had opened since my last visit. I liked that they were open until 10pm on Saturday, and the staff were very helpful, e.g. suggesting a route and noting that I could get a $5 discount for being a foreign teacher (I hadn't even noticed the sign). It was very quiet though and in some galleries I felt awkward that staff outnumbered me four to one!

I had high expectations, and the buildings themselves didn't disappoint. The map was confusing at first, but I followed the numbered galleries of the southeast Asian art section, then the Singapore galleries, then the smaller ones in the City Hall building. I liked that you could get onto the roof and that they had preserved some of the rooms and included information about their original purpose.

So why only three stars? I have been to many, many art galleries in my travels - big, small, artists I knew well, artists I knew nothing about. This collection was comparatively boring for me. For the southeast Asian collection they do tell a story of how historical events affected art, but it wasn't really detailed enough to explain art from so many different countries. Some paintings had extra information next to them, but many didn't, and the art itself wasn't that attractive to me. I would have preferred having some kind of route to follow that told a story or showed a specific development in some way.

It's possible I'm being too harsh - after all, everyone has different tastes in art. I liked the Wu Guanzhong gallery that I visited at the end, for example, while others may not like that style of Chinese art. However, I couldn't help but feel rather 'meh' as I left. I will stick to the SAM's contemporary exhibitions in the future, unless the National Gallery has something on that particularly appeals."
,,Its grand and large place,5.0,,"The gallery is big and grand and convenient as there is lifts and escalators. It was my first time there so not so familiar with the place and took abit of time to find the gallery room. The gallery itself, exclude the arts, is already nice to visit if you have time."
,,impressive like the Tate,5.0,,Impressive set up with an impressive asian collection. The signages to the various exhibitoins can be improved. My wish is that they should have a good variety of restaurants in this building. highly-raved restaurants do not mean that they are good.
,,Ink Flows Through,5.0,,"Make time to go the the National Gallery Singapore. We found it very inspiring especially the guided tour we had with P-J of the Ink Flows Through exhibition including ""Chen Chong Swee: Strokes of Life"", ""Xiu Hai Lou: Rediscovering Treasures"" and ""Wu Guanzhong: A Walk Through Nature"".
The building is lovely with great views from the roof. The staff are all very helpful and knowledgeable. There are several different cafes and restaurants so you can spend all day.
And if you are disabled, as I was, then a very comfortable wheelchair will be made available to you with no fuss!"
,,Huge museum-great building,4.0,,"I visited this museum on a Tuesday. There were a lot of keen museum workers ready to engage visitors on the art -in each room-so of which were asleep arrival. I was one of very few visitors that day.
The art and information was an interesting perspective on colonialism and post colonialism. It is worth taking the time to look. The contemporary art galleries in the Supreme Court were the best."
,,Superb,5.0,,"if you like going to galleries, the experience of the new National Gallery Singapore is one of the best. This beautiful renovation - two old buildings combined - leads you into the most wonderful day possible. Like other reviewers we spent a day there and we didn't really want to leave. Fascinating art work, well displayed and described, beautiful rooms, friendly and helpful staff, wonderful restaurants (different prices and foods), superb roof garden and views - it is special in every sense."
,,Remarkable Gallery Space,5.0,,"It is an amazing place to behold and idle away your daylight.
Lots of interactive fun activities for children. For grown-ups who are into South-east Asian Art pieces, you will be amazed by the extensive curation in here.
If you are tired after roaming the expansion historical and architecture marvel, rest your feet at the cafe (managed by Gallery&Co., which also retail interesting local designer merchandise)."
,,One of the latest Gallery in Singapore,5.0,,"A must visit in Singapore. Spend at least 1 whole day to explore all levels, all sections. There is a roof top with a good view of the Padang."
,,Waste of Time,1.0,,"It's like going to the Colosseum, only to find the contents of the Louvre being dumped into it, in a badly patched up interior. You have trivialized what the two buildings meant to Singapore's history"
,,Well Curated Collection,5.0,,"Loved the South-East Asian and Singapore collection. The descriptions next to the artworks were good.
When I went, the Gallery also had the Colonial Legacies collection from Tate Britain. It is worth catching if it ever comes again to the National Gallery. The collection essentially demonstrated how colonialism was interpreted by artists through the ages."
,,"Go for the art, stay for the architecture.",5.0,,Many cities in the former British Empire have old courts and town halls have that have been refurbished for other uses. But I have never seen a renovation of a colonial building that so convincingly preserves the old buildings while audaciously giving them a new purpose. The art is wonderful and much of it also explores the relationship between the old colonial government and the new modern Singapore. I recommend a drink at the rooftop bar while you gaze across the old cricket clubs and the padang to the new vibrant Marina Bay and modern Singapore.
,,Amazing building and history,4.0,,"The art work is fabulous, and changes with various exhibitions on from time to time. But the real star of the show is the amazing architecture to link the old Court House and City Hall buildings. Definetly take one of the guided tours to orientate yourself and learn a bit of the history. You need to give yourself at least half a day here for a look around. And there's some excellent choices of restaurants for lunch."
,,Art and History,5.0,,Well worth a visit old city hall and old Supreme Court are now the National Gallery of Singapore. They have done an out standing renovation to blend the new with the old.
,,Not just a collection of art,5.0,,"I found the art collections to be secondary to the architecture. Singapore integrated the stately old British colonial era City Hall and Supreme Court buildings to create a new national gallery by combining old and new architecture. The result is one beautiful, vast and airy building with many rooms that display modern and contemporary Singaporan and Southeast Asian art. Court rooms and offices point to the courthouse history. The architects even saved the two jail cells where they used to keep people during trials.

I found the interactive children's rooms--the Art Playscape and Into the Woods--far more interesting than the art collections in the other rooms, and I did not even bring a child along. If you have children, make a bee line to these two delightful rooms."
,,Will visit again,4.0,,First time visiting to attend a lunch upstair. Was drawn by the music placed by a team of violinist. The building has such high ceiling that you can hear the beautiful music echoing from every corner. What a way to relax yourself. Hope they have more of such talented musician playing there. Will visit again.
,,new and old meet,5.0,,the museum is an excellent example of how old buildings can be conserved and given relevance to the current needs of a city.
,,Interesting architecture,5.0,,When I was younger I was wondered what this place looks like on the inside because it used to be a courthouse. Glad that it's opened up now as a museum.
,,"Great Gallery, cafe and lunch options",5.0,,"I went to visit here in May 2016 with a friend and we both loved it. We went through all the galleries and exhibitions starting with a coffee, enjoying lunch and then finishing with a cocktail on the roof bar. It was a lovely experience and I would visit again."
,,Wide collection with option for guided tour and a mobile app for self-guided tour,4.0,,"If you like art, this is a great place to visit. There is a wide variety of collections including digital art. There is also a mobile app for a self-guided tour or you can also opt to have an actual tour guide. There are also fancy restaurants around for a romantic dinner or drinks."
,,Outstanding exhibit at the National Gallery,5.0,,"I was excited to visit the National Gallery for the first time this past February. Located in the former City Hall and Supreme Court buildings, the architecture is worth the trip just to explore the buildings. An exhibit which looked at Art and the Empire was showing, and it was excellent. It gave a wide ranging view of colonialism, not only from the British point of view but also from the perspective of other nations and the native, colonized people. The art was beautiful and the presentation thought-provoking. I'm sure that the permanent collection will become even stronger with the passage of time, but it is already well worth repeat visits."
,,Amazing Place to Display Art,5.0,,These restored buildings could rival any of the museums around the world. I had a very informative free tour with Ms Liling about the history of the two buildings and its restoration. Highly recommended!
,,Very nice place to visit,5.0,,A very well maintained place to visit! The staffs are very helpful and informative and the place is huge with many exhibition halls. There are special exhibitions that will change throughout the year. There are also free tours provided and the tour is really good! Go for it if you have the time. You can sign up for free at the counter and the guide will explain to you about the history of the art pieces and you will definitely get to know more from it!
,,A great national resource,4.0,,"It is tremendous that the City Hall and the Supreme Court have been conserved in this fashion. The buildings look fabulous, outside and in. Indeed, you can wander for hours admiring the buildings and the conversion without seeing much art at all! There is so much to do here for the Singaporean, with events and activities, school programmes, and educators programmes, with free General Admission. However, for ""Non-Singaporeans"", admission is $20, and admission including Artist And Empire was $30. To see this exhibition alone cost $25 for Non-Singaporeans ($15 for locals). Hence my ""very good"" designation, rather than ""excellent"". That said, if you are aware of the cost, and have the time to spend, a day here would be time and money well spent. The Artist And Empire exhibition was indeed excellent. And if you spend the day at the Gallery, there are plenty of food options, with the Owl Cafe being an excellent option."
,,An average Asian art museum,3.0,,"Many of t h exhibits were changing in when we visited, so perhaps an unfair review. There was not a huge amount to see. The roof garden was very interesting for photographs and is free to visit."
,,A Great Architectural Freebie in the City (Good for Kids too),5.0,,"This is not a free activity if you want to see art. HOWEVER< this is a free activity if you want to see architecture, and the sheer beauty of this building. Also excellent if you want to see some of Singapore's old law courts and prison cells (also free!)

So if you want to ramble around in the air conditioning, eat at lovely cafes, look at spectacular architecture, visit the courthouse and the central dome, poke around the gift shop, look at beautiful skyline views form the rooftop restaurants and bars... then go - all of this is free....

If you want to see wonderful art in the galleries, then pay ( i think about $25) to pop in to see some of the art on offer!

ALSO- a GREAT kids area again, FREE of charge- Highly recommend if the kiddies are frustrated with the heat and want to do something fun... fully supervised rooms also give parents a bit of a break!"
,,Lovely gallery,5.0,,Took the tour of the building which was interesting - learnt lots of fun facts about how the building was renovated from a Supreme Court and city hall to a gallery! The terrace is worth a visit - amazing views. Galleries are small but lots of lovely Asian art.
,,new beer in old buildings,3.0,,"It's great that the old City Hall and the Supreme Court have been preserved, although personally I don't find the blend with modern architecture either attractive or very functional - the end result is a mixture of large empty spaces and a rabbit warren. That said, it's worth a visit and one or two of the rooms are interesting and evocative, and if you're over 60 and a Kris Flyer member you get a discount on a discount making the entry price very reasonable. The buildings aside, their contents are a rather confusing mish-mash of art displays - with some excellent work on display as well as less noteworthy pieces - some intriguing bits of Singapore's history and the above mentioned spaces with one or two fascinating architectural features. You could wander around without a clear sense of purpose for quite a while so a guided tour is probably a good idea. As a plus there are occasionally some nice views over what remains of the padang and some plaques on the walls harking back to times long past. We didn't try either of the restaurants (Yan and Aura) but they could provide a nice break."
,,An exceptional gallery,5.0,,"We were recommended a visit by our daughter, an art historian, and we quickly discovered why. We visited in the final days of the Empire exhibition and joined a most enjoyable tour guide as she whisked her group around the gallery with some useful information and enough enthusiasm to encourage us to return and wander more slowly at the end of her guidance.

But the Empire exhibition alone was not the reason for the 5 star review. Other galleries displayed a range of Asian art that was breathtaking, inspired and, in some instance, hilarious.

We spent many hours inside the museum and, to add to the pleasure, we missed the torrential rain outdoors. Definitely worth a visit whether to see the permanent art, the temporary exhibitions or to just enjoy the building itself."
,,Well worth a visit,5.0,,"Housed in the former Supreme Court and City Hall, this state-of-the-art museum houses the world’s largest public collection of Singapore and Southeast Asian art. We were lucky to be there on one of the final days of the excellent ""Artist and Empire"" exhibition (Victorian as well as modern art) and enjoyed a free guided tour."
,,Hit and miss,3.0,,"Hits:
* The building itself is amazing. The old Supreme Court and City Halls have been flawlessly merged into an attractive, modern building.
* Nice paintings from the early colonial period in the Singapore Galleries
* Nice paintings from the history of the British Empire in the first section of the current special exhibition ""Artist and Empire"" including portraits of the Queen, Lawrence of Arabia, Sir Stamford Raffles and local people; battle scenes and landscapes
*Very good display of historic constitutional documents
* Open till late on Friday and Saturday, giving you more flexibility to put it in your itinerary

Misses:
*the entry fee is expensive even with the discount from presenting a Singapore Airlines boarding pass
*In the permanent Singapore galleries and the special Empire exhibition the nice older paintings quickly peter out to rather ugly modern works.
*The staff were annoying. I had turned off my flash as required but was followed (at a distance) by one difficult staff member after a tiny red light went off on my camera while taking photos. I know she was following me as there were no other visitors at that late time in that particular section (approx. 8pm).
*Copyright: I was stopped from taking a photo of a very famous painting of the British surrender to the Japanese in 1942 on this flimsy pretext. As I told the staff, I have seen that painting reproduced thousands of times so it was a bit late for the copyright holder to get touchy about copies.
*The gift shop had a non-existent selection of postcards and gifts actually relevant to the collections. There were oodles of trendy items that could be bought anywhere else."
,,The latest addition to Singapore art galleries,4.0,,"The recently opened National Gallery is enormous! I would recommend to join one of the free guided tours to see the highlights. I was lucky to be there on one of the final days the excellent "" Artist and Empire"" exhibition (Victorian as well as modern art) with a free guided tour .
Bring your Singapore Airlines boarding pass for a discounted admission fee."
,,First throughly visit,5.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore occupy two grand buildings is Singapore - the former Supreme Court and City Hall. It is not a modern building but a colonial building built before Singapore independence. Currently it is free for all exhibits for Singaporean and permanent residents. Total there are 6 levels of galleries with basement for ticketing.
It takes a few hours to go through the exhibits. There are cafe for drinks or foods in between the visit. If intend to have longer hours, visit on Friday or Saturday as it open till 10pm."
,,V good gallery,5.0,,"We were very lucky, as upon arriving a guided tour of exhibitions was just commencing and the Guide was very informative. Not a visit for people who don't enjoy viewing artistic works. Very helpful staff. The top floor restaurant and bar is worth visiting esp for the views"
,,Great museum,5.0,,If you like museums you will enjoy this art museum. What impressed me the most was the contemporary Asian art but there was plenty here to spend half a day without being bored. It is a great museum and the view from the top is fabulous.
,,Fullness Destination,5.0,,"Nice place to visit when you are going to Singapore and interest to see the local art pieces. The entrance fee is 20 S$. You can spent 2 hours and more here if you like.
If you want to visit, you can find the information about the event or exhibition that time."
,,Enjoyed the National Gallery,5.0,,"Every member of staff, from ticket office to security, is proud of the museum and very helpful. Thought provoking exhibitions ""Siapa Nama Kamu? Art in Singapore since the 19th Century"" and ""Artist and Empire: (En)countering Colonial Legacies"". Innovative renovation of two buildings, Supreme Court and City Hall. Roof on level 6, City Hall wing, has great views. Try the Owl Cafe level 1, City Hall wing for delicious and reasonably price local food and kopi. Disappointed with Gallery Explorer Android app, which wouldn't load despite help from staff."
,,Artists in Empire,2.0,,"This exhibition was very disappointing. Tickets are quite expensive - and the gallery follows the nasty practice of charging more for anybody who doesn't live in Singapore. The selection of art is sometimes interesting: the way the colonists viewed the alien peoples they found themselves ruling over is a good subject. But it misinterprets: Australian landscape artists, for example, are depicted as an instance of growing awareness of independent nationality. At the end of the 19th century, Australians would have thought of themselves as south British; national consciousness came much later. And the pictures of native peoples at the height of Empire are an incomplete depiction of how the colonists viewed the ""subject peoples"". For instance, the notorious Hottentot Venus is missing - and there is no mention of how aboriginal people's remains were taken to the mother country as curiosities. Sometimes the colonists showed a fair contempt for the natives. The West Indian colonies and Africa get little coverage and there is nothing about the opium trade and the Chinese expeditions of the 19th century. Worst of all, some of the exhibits are quite small and are behind glass; you cannot see them properly because the gallery people have painted lines on the floor a fair way from the art works - and you are forbidden to cross the line. In true Singapore control freak mode, when you go into a section of the gallery an attendant will emerge and silently shadow you. There may be some point in keeping people away from an unprotected large oil painting, but doing this to a 30cm by 30cm print in a glass frame simply means that nobody can see the thing properly. This was an inadequate exhibition spoiled by the way the items were over-protected, and I didn't think it was worth the excessive entrance fee."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"The new National Gallary Singapore is housed in the former City Hall and Supreme Court right buildimgs in the city. The two historical buildings were beautifully renovated which brought out the unique architectural style of the British colonial days and is a very apt building to house the National Gallery.

The gallery is huge and is divided into two main sections. Unfortunately I only had time to see the DBS gallery when I visited. Brief though my visit was, I was impressed with the progress the cultural scene and the various art forms developed in the last 100 years. Although western art forms played a major influence, there is a distinct display of local talents.

I hope to see the other sections of the gallery in my next visit."
,,Loved it.,5.0,,"The art works are housed in two beautifully renovated buildings - Supreme Court and City Hall. Staff were helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Loved the Artist and Empire, Wu Guanzhong-Walk through Nature and Law of the Land exhibitions.
So much to see and enjoy - we ran out of time. We did have difficulty in finding the Artist and Empire exhibition. It gave us an opportunity to expore the building.
Visited the 5th Floor rooftop to look at the great views of the city. Had drinks in the evening at Aura Restaurant and Bar. Loved the views at night too.
Take a wrap/lightweight jacket, it can be chilly in the museum."
,,Nice museum with sweeping views from restaurant,4.0,,"If you visit the National Gallery in Singapore, be sure to check out the views from the Aura Sky Lounge. The galleries have a lot of interesting and unique art from Southeast Asia that you would not see in other parts of the world."
,,did not meet the expectations,3.0,,"On our first visit to Singapore, we run out of time to see the gallery. We went back and this time, we saved most of the day to see the gallery - the outside is great. Beautiful building. But we were disappointed with the inside, not as much art as we have expected from such a big space (lots of empty spaces int eh building)."
,,One of best attractions in Singapore,4.0,,"Truly impressive re-arrangement and use of the space occupied by two beautiful buildings; fantastic views; superior restaurants. Ironically, relatively speaking the weaker link here is the content: While of very high quality, (a) the National Gallery could easily show several times its current exhibitions without feeling a bit crowded, and (b) it is subjective, but I find the content at the Asian Civilisation Museum much more of a 'wow'."
,,A superb National Gallery,5.0,,The National Gallery is just next door to St Andrew's Cathedral and across the road from my favourite Singpoare Cricket Club! The Gallery houses the largest collection of Singaporean and SE Asian Art and is superbly arranged and displayed. After a major refurbishment it reopened last year so again on a rainy day spend time here for a superb time viewing the Artworks and history of Singapore and SE Asia
,,Fast becoming my favourite place to visit in Singapore,5.0,,"The Gallery is relatively new and is set in two old buildings which are also quite beautiful, old courts etc. I usually devote 2-3 hours to each visit and have not yet finished seeing all the art. It's not the Ufitzi or the D'Orsay, but has a lot of really fine and a lot of really interesting art, particularly Asian art. It has a nice cafes on the ground floor at reasonable prices and families have places for small children. Singapore has been working on making the city more art-friendly and have certainly succeeded here. A great combination with the Asian Civilization Museum if you are in Town for a few days."
,,Stunning architecture,5.0,,Visited to see the art but joined a volunteer tour of the buildings and it is a must. Finding out how the old Supreme Court building and the gallery have been so innovatively combined was fascinating. The ceramic exhibition was great too. Didn't get time for the art!
,,Well worth visiting,5.0,,This is a very interesting complex to see how well two older buildings can be utilised. The new configuration works well but I was really interested in seeing the art works which depicted Singapore's history. The incorporation of a restaurant cafe and bar has been well thought out. Don't rush this visit
,,Interesting - Worth a visit,4.0,,"Creating a single building by connecting the former Supreme Court and City Hall by an atrium and walkway bridges was a great idea. I love the fact that they also kept original features like the Judges seat(s), dock, etc.

The roof bar/restaurant is also nice with a great view - but service can be a little hit and miss."
,,huge facility with little content,2.0,,"We were surprised by how little there was to see in this huge building. Very few people inside.
When we left we were mobbed by schoolgirls carrying out a survey to find out how the Gallery could attract more guests."
,,A real gem !,4.0,,"If you are an art lover, this is a gem you must not miss .

This was a national project that took a decade and almost half a billion dollars .

Key artworks from early and modern Singapore artists in the DBS gallery ; a good collection of regional artwork in the UOB gallery .

I had to make separate visits for each gallery to enjoy and appreciate the works fully . ( not easy for Visitors I know )

And I am planning another two trips for Wu guanzhong and Chua Ek Kay works .

If you are not an art lover yet , this is a place to learn about seminal artists and their work in this region

If you are still not convinced, check out the cafes, restaurants n shopping . There is a good range of SG artisan products on sale"
,,Great history place,4.0,,We went to the National Gallery to visit the museums and do fieldwork (for our project). The galleries are interesting and they teach us about Singapore/Southeast Asia's history. There are also many interesting art paintings. There is a also a section of the gallery for art and craft specially for children.
,,Be an Architecture Lover,5.0,,"Be an Architecture Lover. Go for Free Guided Outdoor Building Highlights Tour.

A spontaneous decision to be an architecture lover. I went for free 1-hour guided tour at National Art Gallery to discover the rich history and architecture of the former Supreme Court and City Hall Building.

I’m learning to see beauty in everything and everyone. Feeling alive and living life."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Awsome art work from different nationalities all under one roof. Make sure you visit the rooftop garden on top of the gallery.
,,Good to visit on a Hot Day,3.0,,Visited the National Gallery and enjoyed it. Although a lot of the areas were unable to be accessed when we visited we still enjoyed it. The free exhibits were great and the architecture of the see the previous City Hall and Supreme Court buildings are worth the visit alone.
,,Only go if you are running out of things to do,3.0,,"The gallery is in a really interesting building half of which used to be the old law courts and they still have a couple of the old cells they used to keep people in on show.

The gallery itself is okay nothing specially. Not very well sign posted so your never sure if you are going the right way. Or if you have seen every or if there is still stuff to see."
,,Singapore sights,5.0,,Beautiful renovation creating superb spaces with a wide range of art on display. Super restaurant and rooftop bar with great views.
,,At last Singapore has a proper Arts Museum,4.0,,"Set in the old building of the supreme courts and at one time the prime minister's office and looking remarkably like the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, this is a great addition to the city. Opened in 2015 it has a very interesting permanent collection of asian artists and very good temporary exhibitions.
Not to be missed are the excellent restaurants available. They are expensive but they deserve a visit"
,,Lots to see + bonus of interesting building,4.0,,This is an excellent art gallery for those into art but also would be a good place to escape the busy city or the heat or rain. It's a very large building and the different galleries are some distance apart at times but it's a very calming and interesting building to be in. The staff are exceptionally welcoming and will advise best way round. I spent two hours there without seeing the special exhibition. There is free WiFi too. Cafe on 1st floor had amazing looking cakes and the prices were about normal for museum cafes and Singapore prices. There were other places to eat in the museum which looked classy. There is so much space that you don't feel at all crowded which is unusual to feel in galleries in a city this size.
,,Another must see,5.0,,"I only discovered this place late in my trip, but I'm glad I didn't miss it.
The architecture alone justifies a visit, with a great mix of old and modern design.
The staff are really helpful, and even advised me where to go to get the best photos (being a photographer myself)."
,,Surprising and Wonderful,5.0,,"The National Gallery is one of Singapore's jewels housing great Singapore and Asian art. For a city which doesn't seem to value its artists, there is more wonderful local art than I would have imagined. The museum is huge, divided into two large renovated buildings, and it takes some effort to make it though the entire museum. I've been three times now and there are places I just haven't gotten to. It's worth a trip to the rooftop and there are several pretty good restaurants inside. The prices is hefty for foreigners but do spring for the special exhibits while you are there."
,,Artistic and Historical trip,4.0,,Good way to capture the sights and some history of Singapore if you have only one day to spare. There are usually some free daily tours available
,,Top of the list for Arts!,5.0,,"One of my favourite spots in SG. A brilliant combination of past and present architecture housing great spaces for exhibits.

If you're in time, it's worth checkingout the 'Artist And Empire' exhibit. A very interesting and relevant reflection on Colonizer&Colonized relationships.

The rooftop garden and cafes are a great option to pause through your visit and relax before your next browse."
,,Great museum experience,5.0,,"On my last day visiting Singapore, I decided to go check out the National Gallery, placed in the former buildings of the Supreme Court and the City Hall. I was extremely pleased to discover this museum who has a very very progressive feel and inspiring atmosphere. It was my first time in Asia, so I can't compare it to other Asian museums, but I am an avid museum visitor in Europe and I find it a worthy competitor. I liked the exhibition currently on show, Artist and Empire, a large and compelling artistic documentation of the colonial legacy of the British Empire going as far as the 16th century. No time to visit their collection of modern art which is supposed to be the biggest in South-East Asia, but seems like a good reason to go back.
Also, great coffee (probably the best I've had in 7 days of Singapore) and amazing cakes at their Gallery And Co ground floor cafe. And a wow(!) museum shop!"
,,Art and Empire....thought provoking,4.0,,"I am am art gallery fan and went to this new gallery. I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Art and Empire"" exhibition which aims to show how colonization used art for its purposes...ie we had to look upwards to statues of colonial founders. It compared this to a modern work of people being mechanically elevated to the same level as the statue And taking a selfie. Many older works were juxtaposed with recent works challenging the colonial attitudes embedded in the older works. Also there were interesting works from Singapore and a fabulous retrospective exhibition of ceramics by Iskander Kalil. Only difficulty was that the building spaces were so vast that I had trouble finding where exhibitions were.....but the staff were very friendly and helpful and the architectural renovation is stunning."
,,Visit to know History of Singapore,5.0,,"This museum is nicely built & each detailing is done related to history of Singapore where one can explore preserved statues, paintings etc. Other side of the building you can see How judicial system of Singapore works replicated through infrastructural design."
,,Not too Bad but worth a Visit,4.0,,"I might have been expecting too much but I was probably hoping to see some European Masters and famous works b y the likes of Picasso, Warhol etc. Instead the main focus was on Asian Art. The walk through was a bit here and there and disjointed going from one room to another and one wing to another. We were often pointed in the right direction by the lovely Gallery Staff who I think are used to ushering Visitors through the Gallery so they do not miss out what might be around the corner...."
,,Wonderful colonial architecture,4.0,,"Two (City Hall & Supreme Court) buildings lovingly restored to house the national art collection. Even if you are not interested in art, the architecture will blow you away."
,,Beautiful museum and wonderful architecture,4.0,,"This museum has only been opened a year, however the staff are very helpful, and the exhibitions and artwork is of a very high standard."
,,Great place to spend the morning,4.0,,"My daughter and I popped into the Ar Gallery on the last morning of our stay in Singapore. The exhibits were fantastic, especailly the 4 galleries devoted to Singapore's history. We were lucky enough to be able to take short guided tour, which enhanced our experience."
,,"Great, New, Singapore Art Venue and Dining Destination",5.0,,"I have been driving by the National Gallery for over a year now. I decided to venture inside and I am definitely glad I did. It is wonderful!

First the basics:

Yes, they have covered parking which most of the museums in Singapore do not offer.

Yes, they have discounts available if you're a Singtel Subscriber. Just show them your phone and the Singtel logo to get a discount for the entrance fees.

Note, that if you want to see everything you will need to pay extra for the various exhibitions that rotate through the National Gallery from quarter to quarter.

There are restaurants in the Gallery, many of them, are of the sit down, fine dining variety which are only open a few hours at lunch, and again at dinner, so if you're there mid to late afternoon you may go hungry. To check their hours and down load a map to your phone, go to Nationalgallery.sg web site.

We arrived around 1:30 and meandered through some of the Singapore historical galleries. These galleries contain a wonderfully diverse collection of paintings, etchings, drawings, photographs, sculptures and artifacts from colonial days up through the 60's.

As we were unaware of the limited dining hours, we managed to get a table at Violet Oons for a late lunch (see separate review).

After lunch, we continued to the paid exhibition, entitled ""Arist and Empire, (En)Countering Colonial Legacies."" This exhibition included a varied collection of works reflecting numerous artists interpretations, from both sides (colonists and colonized) of life during colonial times throughout Asia and India. It was well worth the money paid.

We also spent some time just checking out the place, admiring the modern additions and updates to these beautiful, old buildings. I especially liked the roof top water garden which creates dancing shadows throughout the interior spaces and beautiful reflecting ponds on the top floor. The top floor offers great views and photo ops of the Padang, where the 7's rugby matches are held, the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, and of course, the ever changing Singapore skyline. There is also a restaurant and bar on the top floor, but the weather was too hot to make it a viable option at the end of our day touring the many Galleries below."
,,Maze of a gallery,3.0,,"We planned a visit to this gallery to escape the heat of the day. Gaining entrance was an experience as you couldn't enter through the main door, but a side door.
We paid what we thought was a general entry ticket and also for the special exhibition.
The special exhibition was very good but then we tried to find other exhibits in other areas of the building. Maybe we are poor map readers, but like another review, we spent ages wandering around the building, coming across empty rooms with nothing to see.
The buildings are beautiful and maybe we didn't wander far enough, but when we did come across something to see, we were denied entry!
It would have been nice to know there was free tours available with our ticket - we were not told about that.
For a gallery that gets rave reviews, we just didn't see what all the talk was about."
,,Take advantage of the free guided tours by volunteers and a discount if you are flying Singapore Airlines,5.0,,"Had a great tour of the buildings before hitting the actual galleries. The building histories are amazing and the free guide very informative and knowledgeable. Tour is supposed to take an hour, but as there were only a few of us the guide kept on showing us stuff. You can see the room where the Japanese signed the surrender of Singapore after WW2 - the same room where the republic of Singapore was declared - twice. Old court rooms and holding cells as well as the modern architecture drawing two colonial buildings together. Tip from a local is to go back there after 4pm as there is a bar on the roof top where you get a panoramic view of Singapore (I'm trying that next time).

Saw the art and empire exhibition - excellent. The gallery has the best and most comprehensive collection of South East Asian art.

If you arrive or depart on Singapore Airlines or can show your Krisflyer membership there is a 10% discount.

Will definitely visit again next time I am in Singapore."
,,Must visit place in Singapore,5.0,,"When I went there late in the night to this place, the place was teeming people doing the Salsa dance. Didn't go through any other thing there, just spent the time watching people dance. It was really good."
,,Excellent! Enjoyed the Chinese water color paintings.,4.0,,If you want to see a little bit of everything this is a wonderful gallery. Lots of different styles and mediums. There was an extremely modern art display when we went thru. Not my thing but I was impressed by the fact that it was so modern.
,,The architectural tour of this gallery was fantastic,4.0,,"The story of the conversion of the two civic buildings into the present structure was a fascinating one. The tour was included in the price of admission -( check the time for your visit). it took over an hour but gave such a sense of history and the desire of the government to preserve the visual aspect of the buildings while utilizing them for their current purpose. The standing collection did not have quite as much appeal, but the Special Exhibit of ""Artist and Empire"" had been curated to include Asian influenced artists and the history of Singapore which I found interesting as I had seen the original exhibit at Tate Britain a year earlier.
I recommend the gallery itself and suggest you select those galleries of interest as the floor space is vast."
,,The building alone is worth a visit - not to mention their well-curated exhibitions.,5.0,,"First, the building. It's so beautiful inside and out that it's virtually impossible to find an ugly angle from which to take your photo. It looks so stately, grand and elegant almost magnificent even - thanks to its high ceilings.

Second, the staff were all very helpful. (Ok, one was being overly solicitous but how can you take that against her when you know that she just wanted to be as helpful as possible?)

Third the exhibition itself (Artist And Empire: Encountering Colonial Legacies) was so well curated, properly spaced out and very informative (as long as you take the audio guide tour which is a downloadable app). I'll be honest though: I took in this exhibit twice. The first time was with a tour guide who was not as well-informed as I would like him to be although he was pleasant enough and could get passionate about the bits he knew about. The second time I took in the exhibit, I relied on the audio guide and that was when I enjoyed it so much more.

The exhibit will make you aware of how the colonisers control the narrative of their empire and how they manipulate their public image by way of art - and it shows how those who were colonised eventually reacted to this artistic imperialism also through art."
,,Impressive exhibition full of surprises,5.0,,We went there at the last free of charge day with the whole family. The building is great and the exhibitions surprisingly innovative. They even have in promptu guides around explaining you about the paintings.
,,Open House at The National Gallery,5.0,,"These colonial Grand Dames of the Supreme Court & City Hall have truly been restored well & at some parts even surpassed its former glory.

My friend & I brought our dad's out on an excursion on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year. We thought it would be good for them to reminisce of old Singapore. But to our surprise, our dads didn't know that much about the 2 original buildings -- seeing how one of them is the Supreme Court, I suppose that's a good thing!

Singaporean Citizens & PR's do not have to pay for the general admission, but being Chinese New Year even the paid exhibits were free admission.

As we intended to just have a walk around, we decided to opt for hour-long the guided tour of the buildings. We learned so much about the old & new architectural feats, constraints & ingenuity. Our tour guide, May, was very knowledgeable & peppered her script with personal experiences -- like how she personally voted for the restoration design & the result of which is what now stands.

The tour was fascinating for both locals & tourists in the group. We also got to see selected regional & local artworks along this tour, which whet our appetite to return for the art at a later date.

All the F&B within the National Gallery are interesting, though they look rather expensive.

It's nice to be a tourist in my own city. I'm proud of how well the National Gallery has been revistalised & curated. Will definitely return!"
,,A wonderful renovation,5.0,,"This building (actually two buildings) has recently been restored and reconstructed. It needs a day to see the buildings and the contents properly. The two buildings have been beautifully joined and the junction is excellent for orchestral recitals. The exhibits are extremely well presented and going round the buidings was a revelation.
Having already visited the National Museum on the previous day I unfortunately gave the wrong review of that building but both the Gallery and the Museum are magnificent and well worth visiting."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"What a truly outstanding collection of art housed in a stunning restored building. It must have been a quiet day (Thursday) as each room attendant spoke to me and discussed each of the pieces of relevance/interest. They love their gallery and so do I. It’s up there with the Rijksmuseum and Louvre. I planned on 1 hour but stayed for 4 hours.
Pay the S$28 to see the special exhibit and the entire gallery, it is so worth it."
,,Beautiful buildings but limited collection,3.0,,"The museum stretches over two buildings. The buildings themselves are beautiful and all the facilities are in top condition. However, we really had a hard time to find the actual work of art. Large parts of the museum seemed to (still) be unoccupied/sections closed and at times it was hard to find the different galleries. For a national gallery, what is to see is quite limited here, which was a little disappointing. Hopefully over time the collection at display will increase.
The kids arts center on level 1 is excellent."
,,Singapore highlight,5.0,,"It's wonderful, including Asian Painting from Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia & etc. also British empire exhibition is attending these days. In Level 2 you can see two most popular masterpiece painting that printed on back of 50 SD note."
,,"Small selection of permenant exhibit, service could be improved.",3.0,,"Beautiful building and the designers had managed to combine both old and new into this historical building. The building itself was enough to attract me to visit the place.

Maybe because of the magnificence of the building, we had expected more exhibits but were surprised that only a small portion of the whole building was open for exhibition. Unfortunately, due to the limits in budget set aside for the arts in Singapore, quality and quantity of art pieces are generally limited. I feel that the staff really tried their best in making the best out of the situation and appreciate the hard work put into making the exhibit engaging and interesting. Kudos to them.

Service by the counter and exhibit staff was not consistent. I find that the older (in terms of age) staff members were more passionate and friendly in their service, with one of them even approaching us to give us an impromptu brief explanation and walkthrough of the exhibit room which was very helpful. The younger staff members were generally stony faced and show a serious lack of enthusiasm and a whole lot of boredom in their work. When approached with valid questions (e.g. what time does the Gallery close, where the washrooms are, etc.), their answers were not forthcoming and there was a feeling that we have annoyed them with our questions somehow.

The café was really just a hipster hangout spot for people to show how hip they are. Service staff were more interested in talking with their friends who came to visit rather than serving the paying customers and the coffee was below average. Did not try the food so cannot comment on it.

Overall, the exhibits and the way they were displayed deserve a Very Good rating but it was pulled down by the subpar service of the frontline staff."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"Visited this impressive space today and exceeded expectations.

It was however difficult to enter the building with many of the doors locked. Given the number of people wandering around asking us how to get in must be a common problem.

The SGD 20 is worth for the General Admission for non locals. The building itself is massive and just wandering around is interesting."
,,interesting set up for an Italian restaurant,4.0,,Italian restaurant at the fifth floor of the art gallery. Relatively expensive but modern design and European standards. Nice Japanese beef carpaccio or grilled octopus as starter and fresh linguine with clams (vongole) as main course.
,,It's a maze!,4.0,,Nice gallery. Recommend to take the one hour tour. It is a bit of a maze however so definitely as for guidance on getting around.
,,one of the best galleries in SE asia,5.0,,what a great place to escape the heat and humidity. you could spend all day at these great gallery. a must see
,,Impressive Buildings recycled as a gallery,4.0,,The National Gallery of Singapore is interesting not just for the artwork (which is pretty ordinary compared with other galleries) but mostly for the building itself - formerly the High Court and City Hall. The renovation of these buildings into the new complex is really impressive and indeed is the highlight of the gallery.
,,Friendliest staff at any gallery I have ever visited,5.0,,"From the gentleman who sold us our tickets, to the staff working in each gallery, to the ladies at the cafe, everyone had a smile and friendly greeting. If you decide to purchase an access all areas pass it may seem expensive, it is worth the money as a lovely range of art is on display, lots providing history of the country."
,,"Fabulous building, interesting art.",4.0,,"Based in an amazing old building a former Supreme court and City Hall, this is a nice place to look into.You can see the old holding cells and courtrooms.The building is worth a visit,but then you can also see the artworks which are extensive and varied. The staff are keen to interact and discuss the art and the building."
,,Yet to open all galleries and cafes,4.0,,"Went for free on New Years .
Exhibitions were ok, but the building and the Supreme Court was the main attraction.
There was a feel of true historical significance to the rooms, hallways and dome.n

The New Years eve exercise event was fun and sight of fireworks good from the step."
,,Must Visit - Comfy Shoes A Must!,5.0,,"My favorite past time is walking inside a wonderful, clean, safe, not stuffy nor smelly, easy to move around the famous master pieces which are on display. Like some of the museums in Amsterdam! It so happens this National Gallery is just as worthy visiting. I saw a great number of collections of works of art!

I really enjoyed my exploring, walking about in this Gallery, a perfect place for my 'me time', be alone, to learn more about well known or newbies artists from around the world.

I don't have any bad things to say at all, as I was so impressed on the flow, layout, lighting, air flow/temperature - all comfortable, cosy and convenient. For a museum/gallery I thing they have made it so friendly for the visitors.

I love the collections of world class painters. Will come back soon."
,,Christmas free treat (as a foreigner),5.0,,"I highly recommend everyone to visit the extensive Southeast Asian art pieces in the National Gallery Singapore. Standard ticket for Non-Singaporeans is 20 SGD, which is not expensive given the exhibits offered at each of the ~7 galleries. The museum is FREE FOR ALL during public holidays, so I was finally able to visit during the Christmas holidays, and it was an enriching experience and unique treat for myself. I was able to see paintings by Fernando Amorsolo, Felix Hidalgo and a Juan Luna! I would like to go back after I get to know more about other pioneering artists in S.E. Asia like Raden Saleh, Liu Kang... and acclaimed modern and contemporary artists like Norberto Roldan... The architecture of the former Supreme Court and City Hall is also something to behold, and I was also able to see Singapore's historical documents at the former Chief Justice's Chamber."
,,Join the tours!,4.0,,"My husband and I are ""highlights and famous things only"" kind of people when it comes to our interest in art. The gallery doesn't have anything famous (at least nothing that our very layman selves have ever heard of) but we were impressed! Beautiful space and massive collection of local and Asian art. Highly recommend to join one of the free guided tours - we thought the quality was superb. The guide was very knowledgeable and added a bit of history and colour to each one of the pieces. Made the visit a lot more interesting despite us looking at art we've never heard of. We have spoken to friends who had the same experience. If you have a bit of spare time - definitely worth spending a couple hours here. Like others have mentioned, do go up to the top floor and enjoy the view."
,,"Beautiful building, great collections",4.0,,Starts with a stunning entrance way. Lots of galleries to choose from. Was especially interested in the Asian artist collection I don't get to see much of at home. Helpful assistants. Lunch good in the less expensive area. Fun exhibit of balloon art.
,,World Class,5.0,,"This gallery stands comparison with the very best around the world: Washington, DC; London, UK; Paris; Rome; Berlin; Ottawa. The holdings are extensive, and of a very high quality. It is a bit of a maze, so be sure to use the map that is provided."
,,Worth A Visit,4.0,,Visited this place which has nice interior and art pieces on display. Worth a visit when one has the time. There are also nice restaurants on site and an observation deck at the TOP where one can look across the Padang to MBS.
,,Love it when they preserve the colonial buildings,4.0,,"Visited with a friend, free for Singaporeans and they also provide free guided visits. Violet Oon has a restaurant there and I love the tour of the toilets in the holding cells. Nice paintings and architecture, good mix of old and new."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Very interesting visit to this beautiful gallery. Lots of history and lovely paintings. We enjoyed it very much.
,,Fantastic staff and brilliant views,5.0,,"Unbelievably helpful, welcoming and friendly staff, especially those who helped us when we lost our bags. The views from the top floor are also incredible. Well worth a visit."
,,Good place to kill a few hours,4.0,,"E had to wait for a few hours before heading to the airport for our flight. We were recommended to go here. It is a lovely open and airy complex with a lot to see and do. Aside from the art works (modern, contemporary and traditional) there is a social centre where you can create your own poster from art works on display and email the poster to yourself. Lots of fun. Go to the 5th floor and walk up to the roof. The views over the Bay are stunning. Take your camera."
,,Take the time to enjoy - beautiful complex,5.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore is worth the time to visit. The complex itself is amazing, accessible and cool for comfort. You can pay for the additional exhibits or do what we did which was take in the complex from the rooftop down. The history of the gallery and the way in which they have incorporated the historical supreme court building artefacts into the experience should be applauded. We did not get to the bars and restaurants time did not permit, The view from the rooftop overlooking the bay is lovely."
,,Beautiful light and angles,5.0,,"I visited the National Gallery today with my 3 young children.

We loved the beautiful exhibitions, the historical City Hall and Supreme Court areas and the ambience of the gallery.

All staff were helpful and polite. Most of them took time to explain certain paintings to us as well as the history and importance of the special exhibitions open.

The gift store is really special with some great items and books for sale. The cafe was busy and food looked pretty great too. We got a taxi within a few minutes of exiting.

Highly recommend a visit here, you won't regret it."
,,Good,4.0,,"Great area for children, quite interactive, only spent an hour there though. Not a must do but still still interesting."
,,Stunning architectural complex,5.0,,"A total renovation has seen the National Gallery Singapore receive a truly beautiful facelift that is not all about what it has on exhibit, because the building itself is an architectural masterpiece.

The building provides a fascinating snapshot of Asian art and culture spanning two centuries and a lot of South East Asia. No question this is a must-see when in Singapore!"
,,A Comfortable Gallery,5.0,,National Gallery Singapore is worth the visit. The main entrance is free. The toilets are comfortable to use. There is free WiFi connection inside and many places to sit around completed with sockets.
,,Artist & Empire Encountering Colonial Legacies,5.0,,"Spent New Year's Day at this lovely exhibition at the National Gallery. Always lovely experience visiting this place filled with Beautiful architecture, peaceful ambience and a wonderful respite from the busy bustling streets outside ."
,,An architectural triumph,4.0,,The museum is converted from the old Supreme Court built by the British in early 20th century. The renovation is masterfully done and the admissions is free for the locals. It adds another must stop for both the tourists and residents on their to-do list in Singapore.
,,Fantastic views from the roof,5.0,,"Went to the Artists and Empire exhibition. It was well layed out, not very busy and interesting. We liked it so much we bought the book of the exhibition. It took us a couple of hours to go around and I think we came away wiser. And certainly with more knowledge. The building is super and the staff very friendly. The views from the top of the Supreme Court Building are really spectacular. Worth going up there."
,,Asian Treasure Chest,5.0,,"The National Gallery is a treasure chest of Asian art from across the region and which covers 2 centuries. It is well worth a couple of visits to appreciate the artists from the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries. This was my 3rd visit in 12 months. The architecture of the converted courthouse is another asset and worth taking a few minutes on each floor to appreciate."
,,So glad I decided to visit!,5.0,,"A Singaporean friend suggested that I visit this museum and I am so glad I did. It's so great to see the 20th Century art of Southeast Asia. In most museums, Asian art is limited to stone statues and batik prints, but this museum showcased a broader diversity of art. It was so lovely to see this range. The recently renovated building was beautiful. I also thought the gift shop was modern and fun, with a bright and airy cafe. Definitely recommended!"
,,Bad experience with the staff,1.0,,"I went with my family (my husband, and 2 kids age 9 and 4) on our holiday to Singapore accompanied by my Singaporean friend's family ( a couple with 3 primary school kids, and 1 year old baby). Webrought 2 prams with us , my son's and my friend's bub's.
Since the place was very huge, bringing the pram to respected levels was deemed necessary to us to minimise the trouble.(a whole day event to explore the gallery) However, we were asked to park the pram at level 1 (if I'm not wrong) and walked to the different parts of the gallery which was rather far from one to another with baby on hand and holding the kids' hands. When staff was approached to negotiate if we could bring the prams, the answer was a straight forward "" no

There was children museum that the kids were excited to visit within the gallery. Kids beng kids they just made a bit of noise in the museum ( it was kid's museum, and a story telling PLAYGROUND -with circular slide that supposed to serve the purpose as being a playground for the kids) however the staffs were so busy ""ssh"" ing around our kids trying to silent our kids. ..our kids behaved like when they were in Australian libraries(keep themselves as quite as possible) but they were a number of staff that followed our kids around to make sure that they were not making noises.
I felt so uncomfortable and did make a complain to the staff but they said ""we just do our job and follow the rule""

I hope the gallery would do something about this, as i believe there are many tourists come to Singapore whose kids are educated in western culture to express freely in their learning journey.

Thank you."
,,Hallways filled with reminiscence,5.0,,"Experience :-

""Hallways filled with reminiscence""

There are many things to like about this place but the above phrase really describe my feelings as I explore the Gallery; the long hallways with marbled black and white floors with different galleries lining up on either side.

I will not claim to be a artistic person that can truly value the artworks here but I think that is precisely the part about this place that truly captivate me - you do not need to understand arts to appreciate the goodness in here.

Apart from the Galleries, one can choose to dine here with quite a number of eateries located in one of the wings including the rooftop bar at the terrace which yields you a really good view of the surrounding buildings. Ones with Children also need not worry as there are secured playgrounds and activities to keep them busy.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Preferred Time of Visiting? Early the better (they open at 10am) if you are hoping to catch some shots without the crowds/fuss; you kind of literally own the place to yourself and also enjoy some interactions with the gallery people. From the view that you can gathered from the rooftop terrace which there is a bar located, you will also be in for quite a view if dining/hangout here in the evening

2) Admission Fee? For Locals, it is free for General Admission and cost between $10-$15 if to visit the Artist & Empire as well. Non-Singaporeans will be $15-20 for General Admission, $25-30 to include Artist & Empire as well. I believe Traveler who traveled on SIA (Airline)are able to present their boarding pass for a discount.

3) Location : It is located near City Hall MRT, within 7-10 minutes walk

Verdict :-

Given the accessibility and pricing of admission (particularly for the locals), I would list this as a ""Must-GO""

This is a good indoor place to spend a good number of Hours which makes good backup plan for raining days. It can also cater to a wide audience with its facilities - whether you are in for the Art or curious about some of the featured Historical events or just mindlessly admiring the sleek Architecture; there is bound to be something in here that will interest you.

Do refer to my Photos for visual and thank you for reading."
,,World class gallery in a nicely refurbished building,5.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore is another must-visit for any visitor to the city. The former supreme court of Singapore has been nicely refurbished to house cafes, restaurants and galleries with the latter featuring art works of national significance. The Ng Teng Fong roof garden is also worth seeing for a relaxing spot of green in the building. There's lots to do for young children so it's a great place to visit for a day out with the family."
,,Great building renovation for National Gallery,3.0,,"Great space to stroll and admire the renovation of the buildings, and pick a couple of drawings or prints or paintings to pause and ponder. Ponder, why such a great renovation for such a poor display, stern, archaic and boring of otherwise nice pieces of work. Fine dining at first floor."
,,"Nice museum , not enough time",4.0,,"Lodged in the old supreme court building, this is a sprawling art museum. Not the usual stuff, but local and regional pieces. Well appointed, staff is pleasant and helpful."
,,One of best museums in the world,5.0,,"Amazing renovation of an already spectacular landmark heritage building. External architecture and interior splendour in perfection. A really great selection of important Asian fine art, beautifully displayed and framed in exceptional condition given this is the tropics. Nice cafe and roof terrace. London prices plus, but you can take pictures without flash and it's a once-off experience."
,,Enough Activities to Occupy a Day,4.0,,"Came to NGS on Christmas Day. Thinking that I will only spend 3-4 hrs here but I was wrong. There are many historical arts pieces on exhibition and they are presented in a venue which is, by itself, rich with history.

There are also enough activities for kids. The arts education center has many sub activities for kids to enjoy. My kids are fully engaged throughout the day.

When you are tired, there are sufficient cafe and restaurant for us to take a break or have our meals. The place is also very accessible by MRT. Parking is expensive but at least entrance to the gallery is free for all Singaporeans."
,,I almost didn't go because of my bias towards how much art can Singapore support but ...,5.0,,"This museum is one of the best museums in the world. The reason is not because it is the biggest or even the most unique but it does have a tremendous collection of SE Asia artists and and an interesting historical perspective on Singapore. Many many artists that I've ever seen in Western galleries with varying styles that truly not only reflect their culture but show the variances of art techniques.

The entire collection is presented within the confines of what used to be the Supreme Court of Singapore (including court rooms and a trap door to the cells below).

Excellent restoration of the building.

They also have one item that I believe is unique and wonderful for tourists. At the end of the exhibits they have a table sized digital display that allows you to pick and choose up to 8 (I think) pictures from the gallery and then assemble them into a poster format which is then emailed to you. And it's free. Very unique. I have not seen that at any gallery or tourist attraction anywhere else."
,,Frequent updates of galleries,5.0,,"Im an avid gallery visitor and this gallery, although new, has drawn me back multiple times. Especially appreciate the idea that it's not restricted to just the history of what Singapore can offer -- which is def something this young city should be aware of, it often shows works from the geography around the city.

Visited ""Artist and Empire exhibition"", I loved that my history of Southeast Asia textbook came alive. So many pieces that were discussed in the book were on display.

It's much needed cultural education at a stop.

It helps that they have the gallery app that provides audio guidance too. :)

Fantastic! Looking forward to the next visit."
,,A Great Art Museum in a Historic Landmark,5.0,,"The art museum is housed inside the old supreme court and city hall. It consists of local arts and south east asia arts and a special exhibit. I am actually impressed by the layout, very european like and easy to navigate. The number of paintings and sculptures are just nice so one wont be overwhelm. Plus the architecture of the old buildings is nice with artworks spread thruout the halls, it is also my first time inside despite being a local. Take note that there are free guided tours each day and is worth going to learn about the paintings. Probably one of the best art museums in SEA or even Asia."
,,A charming way to spend several hours,5.0,,"I had a few hours to spend before our flight so I walked here from the City Hall MRT station about 5 - 10 minutes away depending on the traffic lights. It opens at ten. If you have a Singapore Air boarding pass they give you 10% discount on the entry fee which is very reasonable for the quality of the displays. Go early to avoid school groups and you have the place to yourself almost. the staff are friendly and passionate about their gallery. I only had time to see one part, but I was told that there were 15 other galleries near the Supreme Court. Next time. If you are interested in art and discovering new and wonderful displays, then try the National Gallery of Singapore."
,,A superb museum dedicated to SE Asian arts,5.0,,"I mistakenly wrote this review under 'Singapore National Museum'. What I meant is for National Gallery Singapore across the street from St.Andrew Cathedral.

Before my visit to this museum, I was wondering how much arts a small island state can present in its national museum. But once I reached this huge museum, I realized I have entered a treasure trove for many great art works done by artists from various Southeast Asian countries. The museum covered two colonial days buildings and was smartly and beautifully re-constructed inside. Any real art lovers would appreciate this huge museum. After all, one can't find so many wonderful SEAsian art works under one roof in such well organized fashion. I spent nearly an entire afternoon in it and still had to rush through some of the galleries as the clock ticking toward the closing time of 7pm."
,,a great place to appreciate arts and culture of singapore,5.0,,this place of interest is quite big and it might take u around 2 hrs ( just passing through) upto 3-4 hrs ( taking time of appreciating each gallery) to finish all exhibits here. a lot of awesome corners worth taking pictures of. and dont forget to try drawing your ownself in one of the galleries:)
,,An interesting tour through East Asian art.,4.0,,"We limited ourselves to the East Asia and Singapore exhibits which were quite enough for one visit. I was struck by how the paintings exhibited showed more similarities than differences to western styles despite the obvious differences in subject matter. The galleries labeled as local Singapore artists included quite a lot of paintings from the colonial era done by Europeans which are more interesting from a historical perspective than from an artistic point of view.

The building itself is quite interesting and imposingly large. We enjoyed visiting some of the galleries in the section which is the former supreme court building and seeing the old courtrooms - most of which are now dedicated to art displays. Some of these exposed art reacting to the violent history of the region such as the Vietnam War and conflict in the Philippines which are certainly not pieces often seen in galleries in the West."
,,Very good experience,4.0,,"Had a very good time at the museum together with friends, looking at different artworks and installations!"
,,Only if you have nothing else better to do,3.0,,"First, the National Gallery is housed inside the old Supreme Court but you cannot really see much of the old Supreme Court after all the renovations.

The exhibitions are also only so-so, nothing fantastic, compared to the collections I have seen in e.g. London.

That said, entry is free for citizens, and it's air-conditioned, meaning it's a good Plan B for wet weather. The size of the place also means you can find somewhere to hide from the crowds rather easily."
,,Lighting show,4.0,,"Went to Singapore gallery to see lightning show and saw many people walking into the gallery to view the displays. There are a few levels or different displays. It will take a few hours to enjoy the displays.
Went outside to watch the lighting displays which was projected via many projectors. Even though the lighting was only a few minutes, it was repeated a few times for people who was late or intended to see the repeat. Good lightning show."
,,Lucky entrance fee was free,4.0,,"Due to their anniversary, I was lucky to enter free. The architecture and atmosphere are wonderful however exhibitions were not so my preference."
,,Loved the architectural design of this new attraction and the art collection was inspiring too,5.0,,The new National Gallery has been open just over a year - it is an inspiring architectural combining of two older buildings (one the former Supreme Court). The roof top garden offers interesting views (a number of up market eating places on the roof terrace too). Liked that you still got a sense of the former Supreme Court interiors. The collection of Singaporean Art and South East Asian Art was excellent. Gallery hosts one off exhibitions too. Well worth a visit.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"The exhibitions are excellent, the gallery itself is amazing a blend of the old and the new much like Singapore itself. Definitely worth a visit, make sure you have plenty of time for browsing!"
,,Go now. The NGS is celebrating its 1st anniversary,5.0,,"The NGS is celebrating its first anniversary and they have a light show which is excellent. Food stalls are outside the gallery, so dinner is taken care of. After the light show, wander into the gallery. No admission fee as part of the celebration. Great artworks both local and visiting works from the UK, Australia etc. Worth a visit."
,,Have space; Needs more art,4.0,,"By all means don't miss the National Gallery of Singapore if you're interested in Southeast Asian art from Raffles' time up to the present, with collections of quite a number of famous modern artists. There are always a number of special exhibitions on, as well. The venue is huge (converted public buildings) but not quite as interesting as the Singapore planners may have thought. Lots of walking but some wonderful artworks, a pleasant gift shop, children' spaces, and several small coffeeshops and cafes serving a nice selection of food (looks like a popular lunch spot for the locals as well). Definitely worth visiting when in Singapore and within walking distance of several other museums."
,,Worthwhile,4.0,,"I enjoyed my visit to Singapore's new National Gallery. The complex is huge, and features some excellent architecture and well-designed galleries. The content of the galleries themselves was pretty good, though very ""safe"". A broader range of works, especially in the non-Singapore South-East Asian section would improve things, but I imagine will take time to develop. The special exhibition on the British Empire was worthwhile, but would have also benefited from a broader range of works. The museum shop was great. The attendants were also very helpful, and approached visitors to explain works.

A couple of areas for improvement are to revise the pricing ($30 for admission, and especially charging extra to see the permanent collection to people who've paid for the special exhibition, is too high for what's on offer) and to make better use of the building's huge numbers of corridors which are largely pretty barren. The escalators were also a bit confusing - they only start moving when you approach them, and there didn't seem to be consistency in the sides which go up and down!"
,,Beautiful architecture and interior design,5.0,,Excellent art and paintings exhibition. I spent 5 hours at the gallery and still not able to cover everything. My favorite exhibition so far is the Kembara Tanah Liat (Clay Travels) exhibition by Iskandar Jalil. Will be back again to cover all exhibits in detail.
,,Lovely museum,5.0,,The building is great. Convenient to access and historical. the exhibition is good. A nice walk in national gallery feels really good and tranquil. I could have visited the museum more often.
,,Another great asset to the community,4.0,,"Excellent use of old court and government offices. Interesting art collections, including soecial show about the old ""Empire"" and how it portrayed the ""natives"" vs. how they now depict themselves. Drawback: it's expensive for non-citizens, but we came on a Public Holiday so ir was free. Ought to trim the price!"
,,"Historical, Cultural and Artistic",4.0,,"The National Gallery is reconstructed by a well-known French Architect, Jean Milou, which comprises of the old City Hall and the former Supreme Court. Apart from enjoying the variety of arts at the art galleries, there are some fine dining restaurants too. You can even sip on a cocktail at the rooftop, while viewing the beautiful Singapore skyline. A place good to relax on the weekdays, if you want to avoid the crowd."
,,Chaotic,2.0,,Massive gallery combining 2 converted buildings but it all seems a bit chaotic with some gallery doors locked and a lot of the buildings used for non exhibition purposes. Thankfully the staff are v helpful in getting you around.
,,Love this place!,5.0,,This place is interesting for all ages. Attended events here too as Gallery Insider. Totally worth the money!!!
,,Beautiful collections,5.0,,This is one of the best museums we have visited.Spacious and many different galleries. They do not eschew the awkward themes either. Thoroughly enjoyed the current exhibition on 'Artists and empire'. Do not forget to go up for a drink at the Smoke & Mirrors bar to see the sunset (reservations advised)
,,Architectural Marvel,5.0,,"An extremely snap worthy place, both inside and outside! If the wide array of exhibits are too much of an overkill, the peek into the former Parliament would provide much buzz!"
,,Old Supreme Cour building transformed into a museum,3.0,,If you are interested in Asian artists then you will find some interesting paintings here. The building is well refurbished and there are several areas of interest. But I was disappointed with the way the exhibits are arranged and presented. The flow from one gallery to another sometimes gets confusing and you can miss out on a room if you are not careful to look at the room numbers.
,,The building has a history of its own,5.0,,"A beautiful building with heaps of history, great collections and artifacts from the history of Singapore and its neighbours."
,,Great collection of Singapore and Southeastern Asian art,4.0,,"This museum is housed in the former Supreme Court and City Hall buildings - the architecture and exhibition spaces are beautiful. I had read that the museum collection is comprised of 8,000 works of art - clearly, these are not all on display. However, the art, both Singaporean and Southeastern Asian, provides wonderful insight into the culture of this part of the world.

Make sure to visit the the rooftop deck - it is a lovely setting with beautiful views of the city.

I do recommend a visit to the National Gallery when visiting Singapore. For me, this would be a ""must see"" - even if I only had a short time to visit. I felt like I understood Singapore much more clearly after visiting. The museum was totally empty when we were there - I think it's unfortunate that our hotel didn't recommend this when we asked for suggestions about what to see and do."
,,Excellent! Worth a visit,5.0,,"Enjoyed the quartet in the gallery, fabulous acoustics, cafe, sky bar, gift shop and exhibitions. The building itself has been renovated beautifully."
,,Definitely worth a Visit,5.0,,"I spent only half a day at the National Gallery and wished I had more time to explore more if this wonderful place! The building itself is worth seeing - its grand and the work that had been done to it is nothing short of amazing. Location wise, it is next to the City Hall MRT station - so access to the museum is good. Entry fee is reasonable and as a great fan of art galleries, I spent many hours just wandering around, floor to floor, amazed by the artwork, and the sense of serenity that you get in all museum and art galleries. On the day of my visit (weekdays), the crowd was thin. A trek up to the highest floor will reward you with a wonderful view of Singapore waterfront where Marina Bay is. Would I come back to complete my visit? Absolutely."
,,A fascinating place for children,5.0,,"I visited the National Gallery with my son and grandchildren (aged 4 and 2). The Gallery uses the old Supreme Court Building and the adjacent old City Hall, combining the two with a glass and steel canopy, to make it one centre. That in itself and the old buildings are well worth a look. We visited the Children's Education Centre which was brilliant. Lots of things to see and do. There was also a large Peter Rabbit/Alice in Wonderland themed children's play area which was truly amazing. We couldn't get the kids out of there! There is a nice restaurant too, when you need a break!"
,,"Outstanding collection of South East Asian art, wonderful building",5.0,,"The gallery straddles the old Supreme court and City Hall buildings, and many of the courtrooms and chambers function as exhibition galleries, so the historic setting is really special.

The collection of asian and particularly South East Asian art is huge, and interestingly organized. No point comparing it with the great global art museums / galleries, but should appreciated for what it is - possibly the largest collection of south east asian art anywhere in the world in a beautiful and historic setting. The store was a bit disappointing, could have been better stocked with new artwork, replicas and posters.

On a personal note, was super excited to see a small collection of paintings from one of my favorite artists from my local area - Jamini Roy, and particularly his amazing portrait of Tagore.

Need a full day to even skim the collection, so come armed with time and comfortable shoes.

Easily accessible via MRT (City Hall interchange or Clarke Quay).

Highly recommended for both serious and casual lovers of art."
,,Wonderful Building,5.0,,Excellent use of the old Supreme Court & City Hall. The layout is a little confusing but stick with it as the exhibitions ( esp Art & The Empire) are great . Well worth heading to the roof for a drink or snack overlooking the old Padang
,,National gallery. Interesting place.,4.0,,Many exhibits to view. Worthwhile trip. Informative and interesting. About south east Asia . There's a nice cafeteria with free wifi. The staff were hospitable and friendly.
,,Spacious Art Gallery,4.0,,I found this by accident and was pleased that I went in and viewed the Asian art on show. Very spacious building and a really nice space. Also the ground floor cafe is excellent.
,,Excellent source of history mixed with art,5.0,,"I found the Gallery to be a very engaging experience. Personally, I highly recommend using a personal tour guide (docent) as the interpretive history provides much better context to the historical and rich cultural heritage of the Asian art scene. The building/grounds are impressive and meticulously improved & modernized while the art work and displays make it a worthwhile learning experience for those seeking to learn more of the Singaporean culture and the impact the arts have had."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,This is not a typical tourist spot but you would miss the essence of Singapore by not visiting this Gallery.
,,"Need better ""noise"" management",2.0,,"During a recent visit we saw a group of young school children touring the gallery led by the teachers. While it was an encouraging sign to see them learning and appreciating arts at an early age, the whole process was conducted in a rather disturbing manner. The children were seated on the floor while the adults were literally ""shouting"" in the teaching process, and their voices echoed around the gallery so much that even if you are in another part of the building you can hear the teacher talking!

In many other leading museum or galleries around the world, tour groups are required to use wireless transmitters/receivers so that the tour leader speaking into the microphone can be heard by each members of the group without having to raise their voice. In the absence of such tour guide systems, groups should be told to keep their voices down by whispering and not shouting in an otherwise quiet emvironment, and the gallery hosts should intervene if the group becomes too noisy.

Also it was disheartening to see that school teachers are not trained or aware that teaching in a public space like an art gallery is not the same as in classroom. They have to teach by example as otherwise kids growing up would think talking loudly in a museum or gallery is acceptable. Sadly such behaviour in fact reflected negatively on the society and the education system as a whole.

The poor rating of this review is in no way a reflection on the many exhibits which are of such high quality, but we need a more conducive environment for the visitors to enjoy them!"
,,Fantastic day in....nice and cool!,5.0,,Lovely Museum full of fantastic galleries and some interesting works and interactive models. The actual building itself is also very interesting and the history amazing. Make sure you have a good half day inside to enjoy it. Also take a ride to the roof for great views of the City surrounds.
,,When Getting Lost Turned To Be Great,5.0,,"I visited this solo and was just planning to see what collections do they have. So merely just passing by each gallery reading descriptions of paintings or works of art.

I bought my ticket directly at the counter which is located at the basement. The man asked me a lot of questions verifying where I came from or if I were a student or member of the academe. It was because he wanted to make sure I avail of their free pass if I were a Singaporean, holding permanent residency status, student, or teacher. Unfortunately, I didn't hold any of these. He was very kind and explained to me the perks. So I got my ticket and started from basement, up.

I was in awe when I saw collections of arts from the Philippines. Paintings by our national artists Juan Luna, Felix Resurrecion Hidaldo, Arturo Luz, Jose Joya, Fernando Amorsolo, and Hernando Ocampo. So the supposed to be 1 hour allocated time in the museum turned out to 3 hours. I loved staring at paintings.

I even went up on the topmost floor. The roof of the gallery which were all water and creating beautiful reflection and lighting in its lobby inside. It has restos on the topmost floor and overlooking some skyscrapers of Singapore. Well, I accidentally just went up and got curious what's outside. This gallery was well designed and has modernistic feel but still keeping the old charm of columns and high ceilings."
,,Outstanding Museum Building and Innovative Presentations,5.0,,The architecture is outstanding -- combining 2 historical buildings to create this museum was extremely well done! The collection of art from many Asian countries is superb. This is a must-see destination in Singapore.
,,Art and the Buildings,5.0,,"Great Buildings encompass the Art from a number of countries. The beautiful old Supreme Court and City Hall buildings have been encased in modern splendour. Views on the 6th floor of the Marina and the City are worth the entry fee,"
,,Must do!,5.0,,"We were drawn by the building, or its modernisation, as much as anything else but learned we were wrong to dismiss so easily a fine gallery and educational, enjoyable and repeatable experience."
,,A great experience,5.0,,"The newly renovated National Gallery is an architectural wonder inside and out. It has really nice cafes and a wonderful rooftop bar, the best located in Singapore, with wonderful views out to MBS and over the Padang where they were playing football as I had a glass of champagne."
,,Terrible and frustrating,2.0,,"Planned to spend the whole afternoon in the museum as it looked so large. However, I just spent most if my time being lost. The layout of the museum is very confusing, with 2 separate buildings. There are very few paintings in the collection, and almost no information on them. You can take a free guided tour (recommended), or ask the staff in each room for more information. Most of the work is ' modern', so don't bother if you like fine arts. There is free WiFi, which was useful as the museum assumes visitors have detailed knowledge of the history of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and the artists. A total rip-off at S$20."
,,Not worth your money,2.0,,"I don't know maybe is because I have been to The Louvre, Orsay, and Picasso museums in Paris. I find that this gallery has nothing much to see. It has all the space but not much to offer. Nice building though!"
,,The wonders of modern architecture interwoven with a the history of Singapore Justice System,4.0,,I came to visit this wonderful place 6 weeks before I was due for an exam to seek some peace of mind after studying for a few hours at home. See how the architect is able to build a whole structure to cover the old Supreme Court of Singapore is amazing and bringing it up a notch is the nearby modern Supreme Court which has a circular structure on top which everyone including our judges and lawyers call the UFO.
,,Wonderful collection and Curatorial excellence,5.0,,"Th gallery has a wonderful collection and excellently curated. There was road construction for the Grand Prix during my visit and accessibility was a problem. However, this attraction must not be missed"
,,Beautifully Restored Buildings,5.0,,Great place to visit. Guides very helpful and full of information. The buildings are beautifully restored and lovely and cool which is such a blessing. Tea room handy for a snack or drink.
,,great western building with some nice arts,4.0,,"from impressive classic architecture ofvthe museum to many arts pieces inside, you may spen half day to visit and taste many artful experiences, even not an artist- it's a must-see place too."
,,Must-see attraction in Singapore - perfect for a rainy day,5.0,,"The National Gallery is a must-see attraction in Singapore if you are interested in art and architecture.. The builidng combines the old court building with the new gallery - great architecture , very well done. It has many restaurants and a cafe ( great cappucino ) and a top-roof bar with a great view.
Exhibition Artist & Empire is a must-see . The influence of colonization.
Download the Gallery App ! It leads you through the gallery with commentary/. Very well done.
Try the Social table - you may put together a poster of your favorite exbibits and send it to your friends. Really cool."
,,Evening gallery tour and dinner,5.0,,"Beautifully restored Old Parliament House and Old Supreme Court buildings become a spacious new art gallery that will increasingly house Asian and international artworks. See singaporean artists besides others from South East Asia. Modern , avantgard and classical works are represented."
,,must go！,5.0,,its a really good place to enjoy！是由两座建筑改建（city hall和supreme court）花了十年时间，外观保持完好，里面大气时尚～现在开了伦敦博物馆分展，超赞
,,Loads of works of art to enjoy here,4.0,,There are numerous works of art to enjoy here and some of the pieces reflect bygone Singapore. You can get nice views of the Singapore skyline at the roof top terrace and there are restaurants where you can grab a bite if you feel peckish.
,,Nice!,5.0,,"Impressive gallery in two very well renovated historical buildings. (City Hall and Supreme Court). Nearest MRT station is City Hall. Entrance costs 20 SGD for foreigners, reduced for foreign students/seniors or free for all Singaporeans/PRs. Do bring your ID. There are very expensive restaurants and souvenir shops inside."
,,A brief visit,5.0,,"As we had only time for a brief visit, we were directed to the special display by Singapore ceramist, Iskandar Jalil. The variety of textures and details in his work was amazing. It was a privilege to see this collection."
,,Beautiful building - amazing exhibits,4.0,,I visited the Gallery yesterday and was as impressed by the exhibits as I was of the building itself. I will probably visit the Gallery every now and then especially as it has an awesome roof top bar with spectacular views.
,,Great piece of architecture - curating and tours need to step up,3.0,,"I am listing below the main points I take away from that visit. I would not put that Museum as a priority if you have a short time to visit Singapore. I think lowering the ticket price or letting the visitor pay as he wishes (e.g. Metropolitan Museum) would help generate more traffic as it was fairly low when I was there. We were only 4 persons attending the free guided tour in the morning and I knew why after the tour. I was a bit surprised the museum was not as interactive as what Singapore used to show in other museums in town. Great piece of architecture otherwise.

Pros:
- Museum is free for local people. I have noticed the same in countries like Mexico and I believe it's a great initiative (I am not local).
- The architecture of that building is great, from the classic parts of both buildings used by the museum to the most modern additions. It became quickly my main point of interest during the visi. Singapore needs to take Chicago as an example to propose more offers around architecture tourism.
- The museum has a pretty good and diverse collection of South East Asian art that should enable any visitor to find something they like.
- Great views on Singapore from the roof terrace (does not require a ticket if you try to access restaurants).

Cons:
- I usually use Louvre museum as my price reference (15 euros ticket). At 20 SGD, that museum seems overpriced to me and the absence of queuing during the week is a sign I might be right.
- The guided tour was the poorest I ever got. One more ""this is the Singapore river"" or ""this is Chinatown"" and I would have lost it. I really expect from the guide to have context about the artist and about the art piece. None of that was delivered.... very disappointing."
,,I love this building,5.0,,I'm a sucker for museums. I loved the building itself; it's light and airy plus there was a three piece live music performance happening at the lobby when we came. They also have a bar and a coffee shop at the top floors :)
,,IMPRESSIVE GALLERY,4.0,,Very impressive building Mercifully cool Very informative tour This was incredibly helpful as on a tight schedule
,,"Impressive collection, spacious colonial building, worth the afternoon!",5.0,,"First off, it's $20 entry (or free for Singaporeans and PRs). Still, it's worth the price as we'd explored for a good six hours -- and it wasn't enough. There are good write ups and explanations on the free museum app that you can download on the free wifi -- do bring a set of headphones to enjoy the audio. Or, if you're not much of an art enthusiast, catch one of the complimentary daily tours (for art or architecture) and follow along."
,,Amazing Building,4.0,,"This National Gallery was remodeled from City Hall and Supreme Court. It's amazing building that they keep the original outside but change inside into modern gallery. The exhibitions are temporary change from time to time, both asian artists and non asian ones. It will be more interesting if they can find master piece collections. There are restaurants on the deck of the building with panoramic view of Marina Bay. They are open in the evening. Good place for hanging around in the evening."
,,Impressive Southeast Asian art collection,5.0,,It was truly impressive to see quite a solid collection spanning countries and eras in Southeast Asia. I spent so much time in the Supeme court half of it that I ran out of time for the City Hall half.
,,Get on a guided tour,4.0,,"I didn't have a specific purpose for my visit and am not an art enthusiast, so was open-minded about what I'd find at the National Art Gallery.

It's only fairly recently (re-)opened after some extensive renovations to bring the previous City Hall and Supreme Court Building. We were asked if we would like to join a guided tour, which turned out to be a big highlight of the visit: the tour was very much about the history of the building(s), delightfully presented by an astonishingly well-informed but humourous tour guide. They have different tours with different themes and I would highly recommend joining one."
,,Good place to visit for a few hours,4.0,,We went on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of culture !! The some of the galleries were in the middle of being changed (about 6 of them !!) this we did not know until after we had paid our money (we still would have gone though) overall very good quality
,,History Of Singapore.,5.0,,"We spent several hours wandering around this wonderful museum, plenty of history on display from the beginnings right up to now. The exhibits give a great explanation of the founding of the island from the original inhabitants right through the changes brought about by Raffles and into the present day. There is a section dedicated to the Japanese occupation of course, but not overly focusing upon that time. Definitely worth seeing next time you are in Singapore."
,,"History, Art and Architecture all in One.",5.0,,"National Gallery Singapore is not just the gallery to house the largest collection of South East Asian Art but also a significant place to know the history of Singapore. Used to be the City Hall and the Supreme Court, the two buildings are beautifully amalgamated to become the National Gallery Singapore. If you are an art lover, check with the counter for any guided tour (usually at 2pm) for the Gallery Highlight tour or if you are interested in history and architecture, check for any guided tour (usually at 3pm) for the Building Highlight tour - all free of charge once you have paid for the entrance fee."
,,waste of time,1.0,,"i thought that it was not worth to visit.
there was really nothing interesting to see, moreover big part was closed."
,,Excellent place for photography,5.0,,I kind of fell into this place after visiting the Raffies place. A docent told me a bit about the place and suggested some places for shooting pictures - all excellent. I had a second chance to visit for the Singapore night festival and it was quite amazing. Really interesting contrast between classical and modern architecture. Rooftop skylights are flooded to allow the water to provide some interplay of light. Free restrooms on the first floor along with a coffee/food/and knick knack shop.
,,Beautiful place,4.0,,The art and craft displayed is mesmerizing. The broken chair should not be missed.. Be prepared to walk for a long time. Its huge and requires lot of walk between the floors
,,Huge interesting museum mixing the new and the old,5.0,,"- Huge building with a huge amount of art to see.
- Lots of space so it pays to grab a map and plan out what you want to see when you arrive. We did walk around for the first 20 mins and didn't see a single exhibit. Lots of elevators, the layout can be a bit confusing as the building is two old buildings joined together. (old court House).
- The museum focuses on exhibits related to the history of Singapore.
- Has both modern art and historical art
- Like most large museums there is just too much to see in one day so worth picking a few things that you think you might enjoy.
- Some interesting interactive instillation with touch screens.

Overall a brilliant art museum, the mix of modern and historic art makes things a bit more interesting, but there isn't much to do apart from look at things. So you have to enjoy doing this."
,,Amazing architecture,5.0,,"I was blown away by the architecture, two buildings joined together by a single shell. I'm not much of an art lover, yet! But I did enjoy walking through the gallery and looking at several pieces. The highlight for me was the cocktail bar on the roof, overlooking the Marina Bay Sands right in front, and the rest of Singapore to both sides."
,,Restoration well-executed! Good attempt at exhibits but needs improving!,4.0,,"Having been living away from Singapore for a while, my husband who had visited National Gallery ahead of me was very keen to bring me here. I wasn't too enthusiastic especially having been to many amazing museums in my life. And I had little expectations.

The journey to National Gallery started from the walk from City Hall MRT to National Gallery. It was the Art Connector. The design of the art connector was a little tacky but the sheltered walk was much appreciated. Be it sheltering you from the sun or rain, it is an awesome sheltered walk. A little hint of what is to come.

The entrance of the museum looked humble externally but once you stepped in, aahhh....the international feel of a world-class museum. There are docents everywhere trying to help you. We were enthusiastically introduced to the National Gallery App. I asked if there is WIFI and was proudly informed there is free WIFI. I downloaded the jazzy app powered by Accenture. Then the embarrassing moment : the connection went off, and the docent sheepishly admitted that the WIFI had not been stable & the museum is still rectifying it. LoL, sounded like the MRT too.

The combination of the Supreme Court and City Hall into one building is absolutely brilliant and absolutely well-executed. The experience French architect who designed it, is evident. The docent who conducted the building tour helped us to appreciate the efforts that went in to preserve these two historical buildings at a whopping cost of $530million. Having just returned from Europe, I know it takes lots of planning & tenacity to undertake such a major project. The juxtaposition of modern architecture and historical architecture is brilliant. Go to the roof top and you get a most awesome area view of the Padang and esplanade.

I begin to understand my hubby's enthusiasm for bringing me here. He has been dragged to all the modern museums, from NYC, California, Paris, Kanazawa, and Bilboa. He wanted me to witness a masterpiece sitting at my home country.

We now move from the hardware to the software. It is obvious that this museum is trying her very best. There are docents all over, trying to help. There are free tours by the hour. Even the admission is free for Singaporeans. As we walked through the exhibits, my heart could not help but feel that Singapore is finally maturing in the arts scene. The museum has cleverly crafted her niche in South-east Asian Modern Art, instead of trying to compete with her rivals on the world stage.

My heart warms to see Asian artists being featured : Iskandar Jalil, Chua EK Kay, and Wu Guanzhong. UOB deserves special mention, as a non-govt sponsored entity for sponsoring a series of art competitions to encourage struggling but talented artists to blossom in a country that has placed economic progress ahead of arts. There are children's activities to engaged children in arts. I like to see the works of SOTA and La Salle being featured & engaged. I like to see the products from Pathlight or Christian Outreach for the handicapped being featured and sold here.

The museum seemed to struggle in filling up the ample spaces. Understandably, Southeast Asian Modern Art is a niche. There should be more invites made to talented Asian artists in region to enhance the arts scene. The thought ""white elephant"" did fleetingly come to my mind.

Finally, even though I benefitted from the free entry, it bothers me greatly to preview some of the comments on TA. It seems to me that many are visiting the National Gallery because it is free. Tourists included. Being free cheapens the entire restoration project & the will to drive and make the National Gallery world-class. I would have much prefer that an entry fee is charged and the amount is redeemable at F&B outlets or the museum stores. Talk a walk to any starbucks coffee. If students can pay $7 for a cup of coffee on a regular basis, surely they can afford paying some entrance fees to a world-class National Gallery?"
,,Well worth a visit,4.0,,The building is fantastic. The exhibits are sparsely spread through out this fantastic blend of old and new. Get to Smoke and Mirrors on the roof for a cheeky cocktail.
,,History and Cutting Edge Advancement Joined Consistently,5.0,,Me and my family were invited by a business counterpart to have a tour of the National Gallery. This is the first museum in the world dedicated to Southeast Asian modern art. It took us about 90 minutes to cover the two major areas of the structure. More time be needed to really cover all the exhibits. The architect did a splendid job in connecting both the Supreme Court and City Hall buildings by a link bridge. Standing on this bridge one will see the tree column that supports the roofing / canopy. On would say that this indicates how history and cutting edge advancement are joined consistently. And there's a lot of these in Singapore.
,,A showcase of Singapore to be proud of,4.0,,"There are separate gallery exhibits on each of the 5 floors ranging from a Children's gallery (with no shoes play area) to exhibits of artists from the region, including quite many famous sons of Singapore. A perfect place to spend an afternoon for those who have an indulgence for the arts.

There are also restaurants here catering from finer dining to the casual café.

Remember to visit the rooftop garden and its lookout platform that overlooks the Padang (cricket field in front of city hall). In the background would be the modernistic structures of Marina bay and the sky scraping buildings of the business district. Imagine for yourselves being here when Singapore's national day parade was held!"
,,Amazing place,5.0,,"Its Gallery which is a place converted from Singapore Supreme court, its like Gallery with the theme. When you keep on Walking, you see Barracks where at early times Culprits were kept. and Gallery rooms are court rooms, Amazing architecture. Thanks for the Free guide"
,,A bit of history and modernity under 2 roofs,4.0,,Interesting that 2 buildings were connected together to house the national gallery of Singapore. Collection shows that of local artist as well as its Southeast Asian neighbors. Get to learn more about Singapore's history here too. Good way to spend a lazy afternoon. Foreigners need to pay while locals get in for free.
,,Pretty good,4.0,,"The gallery has a pretty interesting story to tell, being made up of two historical buildings. They have a free gallery tour, with the guide explaining about the history of the building, as well as explaining a couple of the art work made from local artists. There were also different tours, with one going around the different galleries to explain the connection between the different pieces of art. The highlight for me was possibly the collection of art from Pampidou.

All in all, a pretty enjoyable day."
,,Nice National Gallery,5.0,,"This is the newly opened gallery. Combining old/heritage and modern architecture, both inside and out. The gallery shows various exhibitions..."
,,Impressive but under utilised space,4.0,,"It must be said at the outset that this is an astronomical improvement on SAM, which to mind (and many others) was one of the worse art galleries in Asia. The building in which SAM is housed was significantly more inspiring than the art on display inside. Here in this museum, we see lots of galleries and corridors with nothing on display, but when one eventually finds the artwork, its good and inspirational. At the time of my visit there were exhibitions by Chua Ek Kay and Wu Guanzhong. I was visiting on National Day, and the admission charge was waivered for the day for foreigners. For Singaporeans, it is free to visit anytime - otherwise they wouldn't visit, given their interest in art being such. The possibility of annual pass for locals who are not entitled to free admission seems to have been overlooked. Despite living in Singapore, I hold a Hong Kong Museum Pass because I enjoy visiting their museums (Art Museum sadly closed presently) and would gladly buy an annual pass to the Singapore National Gallery if there were one.

Art must be inspirational - the first question I ask is ""Am I inspired?"" - after that - if my answer is no, ""Is it likely to be inspiration to others?"" - the answer is usually yes to this even if not to me. The National Gallery fulfils the inspirational draw as far as I am concerned, with most inspiring me personally.

Diverse forms of art are represented, including paintings, etchings, ceramics, puppetry, and mixed media. Inspirational generally. Housed in a very nice gallery which was formally City Hall and the Supreme Court Buildings. Artists are predominantly Asian. An excellent collection, which I hope the museum is building on - we need to fill those galleries, and have maybe a maximum of two closed at any one time for turnaround exhibitions. The recurrence of maritime and tropical themes recur in the artwork - so indicative of Singapore's links to the sea.

It has more restaurants than it needs, but that I guess generates revenue. Good coffee shop. The rooftop is nice for a walk, albeit not too long given the heat. There is a children's department, which is good and offers hands on participation. The building itself is airy on the inside and very pleasant aesthetically. Good air conditioning. Nicely laid put. Well worth a visit."
,,a decent gallery,3.0,,"This museum has many programs. We went with school in conjunction of the story month,it was a great event."
,,Great afternoon out,5.0,,"I first visited this gallery when I had a few hours to kill while waiting for my phone to be repaired nearby, and have since made 2 trips back in order to see the whole thing. It's HUGE! The building itself is amazing and immaculately restored, and the collection of art is extremely interesting and varied.

I would highly recommend this place to any visitors from places with rich modern art scenes like New York or Western Europe. It's unlike any collection you'd see in galleries there."
,,Lots of staff who help you understand the history and the art,5.0,,"Fabulously restored building that incorporates showing off its judicial history together with loads of fabulous art. It is massive but well organised. We appreciated all the staff, one in every room it seemed, who all appeared to love their jobs, telling us all about everything we could see. There are a few restaurants, we wish we'd realised and would have had a small breakfast and broken our day up with lunch."
,,Beautiful building,5.0,,"There are featured exhibitions and we saw two which were beautiful and stunning to see. However, the immaculate buildings showing the history of this area of Singapore are worth it in themselves."
,,Innovative Restoration,5.0,,"On the Padang, innovative architectural renovation joining two historic colonial buildings. We were lucky and attended a short musical interlude on the steps of the atrium that joins the two buildings. Worth going inside even if you don't want to see the art exhibits and a great place to cool off!"
,,Average quality exhibitions,2.0,,"When I read some comments stating that the National Gallery in Singapore displays ""world-class exhibitions"", I could only recommend the writers to go to the best museums in the world (British Museum, MoMA, Uffizi Firenze, etc.) and observe the difference.
Exhibitions are interesting and pleasant but of average quality.
The museum is not very well designed as the building mixes up art exhibition rooms with other rooms that have nothing to do with it. Not easy to find your way.
In Singapore, the Asian Civilizations Museum is much more interesting for art lovers."
,,Museum without art,2.0,,"I have never seen a museum with so few art pieces and so empty.
Of course you can enjoy the building , that nice and the kids entertainment in the basement is also great for kids between 5 to 10 years.
But dot expert a gallery...."
,,World class museum,5.0,,"With its marvelous permanent holdings and great temporary expositions, the National Gallery is a first rate art museum; often providing the Asian interpretation of the evolution of modern art. The bar on top of the hotel gives to a great view of Marina Bay. The only frustrating feature is the illogical way the galleries are connected over two separate buildings. Unless you are an educator or a student, be ready to bring your wallet as entry fees are steep; but worth it."
,,The most substantial gallery in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has invested heavily into arts and culture in recent times, and the National Gallery is one piece of proof that this strategy has been a success. It is the most substantial of all the galleries and museums on the island, and while it is modest compared to the true giants like the Dutch Rijksmuseum, it definitely offers all the art you could hope to look at.

It is also a welcome breath of fresh air with its wide selection of Southeast Asian art. Don't get me wrong, I like the European old masters as much as anyone, but the selection here offers genuine new vistas for the western traveler, and such is always welcome.

There is a selection of different galleries within the building with different exhibitions, so you get to enjoy a broad selection of different styles, approaches, methods and materials. You definitely won't get bored with this kind of variety.

As is often the case in Singapore, the building itself is quite interesting as well, especially in the way that it is in fact two buildings connected into one.

The only possible downside is that the west wing is composed of smaller rooms, and is not very intuitive to navigate. So, if you want to stay chronological, you'll probably have to consult your map every so often to stay on track. Also, Singaporean museum attendants are Very helpful, and perhaps a little too present for my preference."
,,"Not bad, kill some free time",3.0,,"Entry fees a bit too expensive, luckily I got free admission using ASA card by my company. not bad just to kill some time in aircond place especially during hot days and learn some of the country's history as well."
,,A fab intro to modern art in the region,4.0,,"Housed in two of Singapore's historical buildings, the National Gallery Singapore has a combined floor area of 60,000 square metres, equivalent to the size of the Orsay in Paris and home to the most comprehensive collection of modern art from Singapore and South East Asia.

You can spend a good 3 hours here. Lots of areas to take a break and sample the local cuisine.

Free English and Mandarin guided tours are offered daily for the DBS Singapore Gallery, UOB South East Asia Gallery and Building Highlights. Check their website for the times when they are available. Admission is free to Singaporeans and Permanent Residents though charges may apply for special exhibitions and foreign visitors."
,,"Outstanding collections, great exhibitions",5.0,,"The National Gallery is a wonderful addition to a growing list of attractions in Singapore, this for those with an interest in Asian art - and worth a visit in itself. We saw a fascinating exhibition showing how artists from India to the Philippines responded to contemporary artistic movements in Europe (there were some nice pieces from, amongst others, the Musée Pompidou) with their own expressions grounded in local idioms. Very well curated. There were also exhibitions of Chines and Singaporean ink + water artists, as well as historical genre pieces. The building itself is worth exploring, being the former courthouse and city hall, in the grand Edwardian style. Fabulous renovation. Great restaurants and bars. Full marks, Singapore!"
,,A broad overview of Southeast Asian Art,5.0,,"This museum is very new and I was surprised how few people were in it on a Sunday, but it was a very eye-opening experience. The museum charts the development of painting and other arts from the colonial period up to the present. I found the period of nationalization and revolution very enlightening. The exhibition highlighting two very famous Chinese artists was amazing. The roof top views were amazing as were the gardens at the top. Really well done redevelopment of the old City Hall."
,,A weekend activities for all,5.0,,"As children too young to enjoy the beautiful artworks they are kept occupied with the children activities like painting, structure building, and many more arts and crafts activities at level 1."
,,Moving Pieces,4.0,,"I've never been into Singaporean art, so this visit to the National Gallery (on recommendation from a friend who is an art teacher) is revelatory. The collections are relevant, descriptive and poignant of Singapore's history as a cultural melting pot. I particularly loved the moving pieces by Chua Ek Kay (My Haunt) & Richard Walker (Epiphany). And the museum is housed in a former Supreme Court building--beautiful architecture, well-done interiors--which lends a moody & contemplative tone to my visit there."
,,Great Place for Art Lovers,4.0,,"During my recent visit to Singapore, I was staying Peninsula Excelsior hotel just across the National Gallery. We visited the place and there was a ticket. At counter we asked for any discounts or free pass and luckily we got free pass due to our profession that is Academia. So if you are a teacher, instructor or professor, show them the evidence and get free access. The building itself is grand and used to be Supreme Court earlier. during our visit international section was displaying work of Picasso. Gallery is divided into sections, displaying art work form Far East, then Asia and International. Guided visit is also an option if desired, or you can have audio guide also.If you like Art and crafts,visit is a MUST. BTW don't forget to visit Supreme Court building portion. It give you oriental grandeur."
,,Free on a holiday,4.0,,"If you like history and art, you'll definitely need more than a day in this Gallery. It's free admission on public holidays and Friday nights.

They have so much to offer. Can't wait to go back and check other exhibits soon."
,,Beautifully Restored,4.0,,"The gallery is huge and beautifully restored from its former self. There are lots of interesting spots to grab photos in. The staff are friendly and helpful. However, it seems that the artworks are not all exhibited yet. Each wing seems to only be 50% filled with artworks when compared with its exhibition capacity. Still way to go to attain the title of Southeast Asia's premiere art gallery."
,,Historical building beautifully renovated,4.0,,Planned a long overdue visit to the National Gallery. Entry is free for Singaporeans and PR's. Its a large place and its advisable to take the tours that are available at regular intervals. We did the tour of the building with a very knowledgeable docent. It was really interesting to learn more about the history behind the two buildings- City Hall and former Supreme Court. The buildings are beautifully maintained and worth visiting. Wandered around the galleries too but will plan another trip to understand the rich display of art better as I felt I did not have enough knowledge to really appreciate all the art work that was on display.
,,Beautiful Building,4.0,,"Beautifully restored. Interesting, grand architecture. The British really know how to build. Check out the roof top garden and various exhibits. Worth checking out."
,,Excellent gallery,5.0,,"i really enjoyed my visit. The works are arranged chronologically, giving a really good sense of the changing styles and influences.It's also a beautiful building with a very good cafe on the ground floor."
,,container better than the content,4.0,,"beautifully and elegantly arranged museum combining two of the most impressive building of the colonial age linked by a contemporary addition (including an enormous atrium with tree shaped iron columns and bridges between the two historic buildings)
everything is perfectly designed and restored, the staff members are very warm and welcoming and visibly proud of their job
there are interesting collections on singaporean and south east asian art (looking at the production years one realizes that asian art in the XX century has not been purely made by imitators and followers)
interestingly, many pieces of the permanent exhibitions are on loan or deposit by private individuals and by institutions or corporations, if I understood correctly
having said that, the splendour of the container lead to desire to see an adequate permanent collection of international modern art. there is still a lot of available exhibition space in the huge building, and being Singapore an economic superpower, I think that some purchases on the the market should give to the city a world class art collection that it deserves"
,,"A disappointment: lacks variety, organization",3.0,,"The museum was free for us (one S'pore citizen and one int'l student), and that was the best part. If it was not free, it would perhaps have garnered a lower rating. While we happened to receive a discount, tourists or other visitors may have to pay a considerable fee to enter (I forgot how much exactly). No matter how much you pay, you will still need to get a ticket.

On the plus side, the museum was very quiet and peaceful, and the staff were quite polite and helpful. The building itself is also an attraction in its own right. But as the museum was called the ""National Gallery"", I was under the perception that it was the flagship art museum of Singapore. But I only learned after visiting that this museum was devoted to modern art. This is not clearly stated, and I had expected to see a variety of classical and modern art. This might have made me considerably more disappointed than I would have been otherwise, and my review may be a bit biased.

That being said, they advertise the museum as comparably sized to the Musée d'Orsay and other world-class art museums. You would think such a large museum would have a wide variety of items to see. But bigger doesn't mean better, and this place is an example.

The numerous galleries lack organization and it is very difficult to make a distinct ""path"" through the museum. It's almost as if they intentionally designed it like a maze. There are no signs to stay ""start here"" and the arrows to the next exhibit are not clear enough. A map was not given at the ticketing counter, and I only found one used map lying in an empty rack. And when you have permanent galleries dedicated to the work of just one artist (for example the Wu Guanzhong Gallery), and often a whole of row of paintings from just one artist, you can tell that they are struggling to fill up all the empty wall space.

The ""Reframing Modernism"" exhibit, although the highlight temporary exhibit, was very forgettable. Many of the artworks lacked descriptions, and for those who are not very well-versed in art (like me), the lack of an informative, easy-to-understand description/explanation of an artwork makes the huge number of pictures just seem overwhelming rather than interesting.

The building itself gets high marks for mix the of modern and classical design, and the wonderful view of the Singapore skyline from the roof. There are restaurants in the museum, but we did not go to any of them and decided to go out for lunch, then return. It was quite nice that we didn't even need a return stamp when we wanted to leave. It was all honor system (there are no fare gates), which is very unlike Singapore, I have to say.

I'm not an expert of art, so I won't say much about the quality of the art itself. I found some to be quite interesting. When we visited the museum, a Picasso, and a Matisse was on display in the ""Reframing Modernism"" exhibit. Though, in my opinion, this museum particularly excels in ""abstract expressionist"" art and modern sculpture, most of which are made by local artists from the region.

Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to visiting this museum again, with the knowledge that this museum is dedicated to modern art. The silence and emptiness of the galleries on a quiet weekday was refreshing in a place as hectic as Singapore, and the rooftop gives you a great view of the Singapore skyline. Some of the art is pretty good as well. But I found the arrangement of all the galleries to be very confusing, like a maze. And the museum seems far too big for the amount of variety of artwork in their collection. It was almost as if they forced the museum to be big in order to ""show-off""."
,,Amazing architecture,4.0,,"The museum itself is by far the high light of our visit. The amount of work and effort to restore and enhance these two cultural buildings is remarkable. The exhibitions are quite limited, however and not nearly as impressive. There is quite a bit of empty space that I suppose one day very far in the future will be full of art but for now it seems quite empty. Still worth a look."
,,Impressive Gallery,5.0,,"Housed in what was the old City Hall and Supreme Court, this is an impressive recently opened gallery with a good air con system! On a not very busy morning for the staff we joined a (free) tour of some of the artworks given by a very knowledgeable and likeable lady who was adept at getting your verbal contribution - the 2 hours passed in no time and we then viewed some of the other works afterwards in our own time. There is a cafe or two on site as well as a more expensive restaurant and a wonderful rooftop view over the Padang towards Marina Bay. This was a very pleasant and relaxing way to spend a few hours and the art was pretty good too !"
,,Stunningly beautiful building and the choir was an absolute treat,4.0,,A fantastic experience - the volunteers in the gallery couldn't have been more helpful and clearly loved their jobs. Great to see the building used to house restaurants and so many facets of history too. We were lucky enough to visit while a choir undertook their practice. An absolute treat.
,,Need at least half a day,4.0,,"The compound and inside of the National Gallery is huge.
Probably you will spend more than half a day there. Walk around, free and easy and relax. The building structures / design(interior and exterior) is amazing.
They are few restaurant in the building. If you intend to dine there, advise to make a reservation in advance especially in advance."
,,A Wonderful Surprise,5.0,,"We loved the gallery - 6 floors of fascinating art history, an incredibly designed building that integrates a giant Edwardian courthouse with a steel, glass, water and tropical garden building design that sort of sits on top of it. There is also a fantastic restaurant on the top floor. We spent the day and loved every minute."
,,Nice Building with great works inside!,4.0,,"the region is just lack of this kind of good place for people to admire great architecture and good artworks. the building was formerly the Supreme Court and City Hall which now housed a lot of great artworks, mostly from South East Asia. its relatively new, so cant compare with National Gallery in European countries.

Its big but benches can be found everywhere. there are a few cafes and restaurant inside the Gallery too.

It is easy access via MRT. get down from CityHall station and its about 5 minutes short walk."
,,Lots of paintings to look at,5.0,,"There are lots of paintings to look at from the most popular and famous painters such as Vassily Kandinsky etc

If you are a Permanent Resident then you will get the tickets to the National Gallery for FREE but if you are a visitor then probably not
But not too expensive its decently priced

**NOTE:
If you are planning to do other activities then it may require you to pay to do them"
,,"Fascinating building, interesting standing collection",5.0,,"I very much enjoyed wandering around the building, interesting architecture, wonderful view from the top of the building. I appreciated the insight in Singaporean and South East Asian art, taking one through the history of the territory and the region at the same time. As remarked by others, staff is very helpful, friendly and at times very keen to inform and explain. Highly recommended."
,,A good afternoon,4.0,,Come in to escape the heat of the afternoon sun. Wander to the roof top to catch some nice views of the surrounds at sunset. Book in advance for an eatery (MONTHS in advance for 2 Michelin-starred Odette) to continue into the evening.
,,Wonderful SEA art scene,5.0,,Beautiful building. Spacious but sonetimes bit like a maze. The staff is helpful and friendly everywhere. The temporary collection of SEA art is mesmerising. Great place.
,,World class,5.0,,"My visit here was one of my favourite parts of my trip to Singapore. I drove past the gallery in a taxi on my way to my hotel when I arrived, saw they had an exhibit including pieces from Centre Pompidou, and knew I had to make a point to visit. The featured exhibit, Reframing Modernism, was wonderful - an incredibly well curated showing of familiar 20th century artists such as Picasso, Kandinsky, and Braque, alongside many spectacular (and unfamiliar to me) South-East Asian artists of the same time period. The static galleries on the 2nd floor were just as enjoyable, showcasing a number of movements and artists from across SE Asia. Unfortunately I did not allot myself enough time to fully enjoy the entire museum, so I rushed through the 4th floor, and I'm sure there was more that I missed. Be sure to visit, and allow at least 3-4 hours to fully enjoy everything this museum has to show!"
,,A great place to spend your day viewing the galleries as well as what used to be the old supreme court of Singapore.,4.0,,"This place is no ordinary art gallery of Singapore because the site used to be the old Supreme Court of Singapore which was where many historical significant events took place back in the 1950s to 1970s.

The building is quite huge and here are free galleries as well as ticketed galleries for the public to enjoy. There are also two link bridges used by legal professionals in the past within the compound as well as the former supreme court holding cell exhibit that would make quite a cool photo opportunity if you know where to find it. ;D

There is one small cafe and knick knack souvenir shop on the ground floor and if you take the lift to the rooftop restaurants you would be duly rewarded with a view of the Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and Art Science Museum all in a single line. You could also view the new Supreme Court of Singapore (The UFO building) from the rooftop area."
,,Great way to recycle an old building,3.0,,"Once they were done with its original function they tried to find a new use for it. Nicely redesigned, if somewhat sterile now. Great way to spend some time if you have nothing else to do... but no real history left."
,,Educational,4.0,,Had a few hours to kill in Singapore so decided to visit the gallery. Very glad that I did a great number of artist from Europe and Asia are on show. The Asian art I enjoyed as you don't see these artist showcased much in the west. The building itself is a great work of art in itself and is just as impressive as some of the works on show. I would recommend a visit to anyone who is in Singapore.
,,Great new use of civic buildings,5.0,,"Singapore has converted its old Supreme Court and City Hall buildings into an art gallery featuring Singapore and Southeast Asian art. I can't comment on the collection, but the building itself is worth a visit (and free guided tour with an admission ticket), and the view from the top-level outdoor cafe is worth the trip by itself."
,,Magnificent Space,4.0,,"The gallery is a stunning building. Beautifully built/restored. Lovely,airy, large spaces. The staff are very helpful. We went to see the Reframing Modernism exhibition which was a great concept and wonderfully executed. We wandered around some of the other galleries and have to return to spend more time. The gallery houses some very nice restaurants. It also has a small cafe in the gift shop. A few things that could be improved: a catalogue or exhibition book would have been great. Other galleries around the world do it for their special exhibitions. The cafe should be expanded. The gift shop is ordinary and could showcase local artists and products more."
,,A lovely place to be among arts,5.0,,An open and inviting place to be introduced to the world of art. multiple galleries set in a historical building where the supreme the court was held. A must to visit.
,,Be prepared to spend some time to see the Gallery,5.0,,"My first visit to the National Gallery Singapore and what a great surprise. Housed in the combined structures of the old City Hall & Supreme Court, tge building itself is worth the visit but pay the entry fee and experience the numerous galleries with collections of varied interests.
Allow at least half a day, if not more, to experience the collections and visit one of the several options for a meal. From sandwiches in one cafe to local and other delights in one of the others. Lots of choice for all budgets."
,,Nice for a few hours out,4.0,,"Wonderful section for children in the keppel centre. Lots of interactive items , and the opportunity for children to become involve in art activities"
,,Huge gallery!,4.0,,"For a Singaporean student, it is free to all of the exhibitions but if you're a tourist and interested in the Arts, then it will cost less than $20 (I think). When I went, the 'Reframing Modernism' exhibit was on. They showed many famous art pieces and Picasso's art was one of them. It is the largest museum as far as I know, having two wings and 5-6 levels with different art exhibitions on each floor. It is definitely worth the visit if you like arts and museums!"
,,"Go for the architecture, not the art",3.0,,"The galleries are small, and the curation is spotty and uninspired. But walk around and admire the (real) Victorian architecture. This was British-colonial City Hall and Supreme Court - it's grand, suitably stately and beautiful. Make sure you go up to the rooftop bar and take in the panoramic city skyline."
,,nice gallery with beautiful rooftop view of sg!,4.0,,Nice gallery converted from the old supreme court with a wide range of exhibits and installations within the grand space as well as a breathtaking rooftop view of the padang overlooking Esplanade and Marina Bay Sands. A must visit if you have time to spare in Singapore.
,,Beautiful building,4.0,,"Spent half a day exploring the gallery and didn't get to see everything on offer.

The renovations have created a beautiful space, went through a couple of the exhibitions on offer and explored the roof space that has some great views.

Choice of paying to see specific exhibits or view the regular collection for free. Well worth a visit and we will go again on our next visit to Singapore."
,,Not a lot of gallery space...but lots of walking!,4.0,,"The recent remodel of the National Gallery is beautiful. Impressive walkways like trees and classical architecture sitting inside contemporary structures are all well and good. But there is very little exhibition or gallery space especially on the upper floors, possibly 70% of the upper space is useless. So you find yourself walking more than looking at artwork. The Chinese watercolour exhibition was stunning even though hard to find."
,,Amazing Exhibits and Galleries,5.0,,The building is so grandeur with impressive architecture. We went to the info counter before purchasing tickets and we were give a thorough explanation of the exhibits and galleries. Tickets were at SGD20 and 15 for students. It was worth every dollar. There were so many galleries we couldn't complete all so we chose those that were of our interest. Highly recommended to take the free tour as you will be able to learn and treasure the exhibits more.
,,National Gallery of Singapore Architectural Tour,5.0,,"Had a great 1 hour tour of the former City Hall and Supreme Court buildings of Singapore that have been converted to the National Gallery of Singapore. I highly recommend the architectural tour. The volunteer, Ling went over time to show us the roof areas of both buildings. The architects did a great job of connecting the two buildings."
,,Beautiful Rooftop Views,5.0,,"Attended a conference dinner there - beautiful. The ambience, views and staff were all helpful. The gallery looked lovely - did not get a huge chance to look around but everything seemed excellent there"
,,Amazing transformation,5.0,,We took an architectual tour of the museum and were fascinated with the way the architect joined and transformed two historical buildings while still keeping the histotical parts and important rooms intact. The art exhibits were very interesting and well displayed. There are also good restaurants in the gallery
,,A tranquil oasis of culture in the heart of the city,5.0,,"An unparalleled collection of South East Asian art, artfully restored historical buildings and an excellent range of restaurant options. Great for a respite in the middle of a busy day, or a spectacular view of the skyline at sunset."
,,Free for students and teachers,5.0,,"I went to the National Art Gallery on 2 July 2016 and to my delight, they were currently allowing free entry to all students and teachers (with valid verification of course), including the paid exhibition ""Reframing Modernism"".
The spacious exhibition halls and helpful guides made my visit a pleasant one. My only wish is that maybe direction can be given visitors on which directions to walk through an exhibit as I found myself retracing my steps to follow through a particular series of artwork etc."
,,"Fantastic location, good restaurants and great works of art",5.0,,Very centrally located. Taxis a bit hard to come by though cos of the way the road is structured. Authorities may need look into this to allow more transport options to and from the Gallery. Good restaurants and great works of art! Worth a visit.
,,Great place for Art lovers & families,5.0,,"I'm not an art or museum person but it's the second time that I went to National Gallery Singapore. It is situated in the old Supreme Court. The architecture is nice. There are cafes and restaurants in it. I went on a Saturday and it is open from 10am-10pm which is the only museum that I ever knew that has such long opening hours, so that you have sufficient time to complete everything in 1 day (I didn't). It's good for couples to go together and view the paintings and artwork and spend some quiet time enjoying them. It's a great place for the children to have fun in the children's museum and try the art & craft. It's definitely a place for people who love to take photos. We would definitely visit again. It's near to City Hall MRT station for people who don't drive. The whole place is air conditioning. So bring a jacket along, in case."
,,Mixed feelings about this one...,3.0,,"I was excited to finally be able to visit the newly opened National Art Gallery. The building itself is stunning, really well updated with lots of interesting features and corners to explore. However I found the art itself uninspiring, not especially well laid out, couldn't keep track of which bits we'd seen etc. and just not especially appealing (art is subjective of course, the lay-out annoyed us so possibly coloured our view of the content!). Facilities weren't great either, we weren't able to get a coffee (tiny cafe, huge queue) or cold drinks. Worth a visit if you've never been but I won't be hurrying back."
,,Nice building and art,4.0,,"The old City Hall and old Supreme Court building are transformed into this gallery. First time we can take our own time to see every corner and every art piece in a gallery (not much time for details visit if travel oversea).

Enjoy seeing the old Supreme Court layout such as Court, Judge office, Ball room, etc. The building itself is already a very good ""art piece"" to us. A detailed visit can easily spend about half a day.

Many restaurants inside the building. Besides, there are workshop for kids too."
,,"Some terrible (old) staff who are arrogant and rude, Horrible direction signs",1.0,,"It is a nice gallery with lots of quality paintings in a nicely renovated building. 5 Star for that.
It seems over staffed in the gallery where literally every 5 meter will be one standing old staff. Worst of all many of them are rude and arrogant. Especially an old (50,60's) guy at Wu Guanzhong gallery & an old lady at Singtel gallery, both of them have ruined my day with their arrogance and rudeness. Thanks to them, I ended my tour early. There needs to be better education or employing of the right quality.
Also commonly, visitors are confused with directions as there are little or none direction provided in the building or it's just too few/little.
What a shame for such a nicely built gallery that needs more improvements in quality. Two thumbs down."
,,Stay focus on the exhibits,4.0,,"One of the most beautiful and significant collection currently being exhibited is the artworks of Wu Guanzhong, possibly the largest collection of the artist's outside China. Some of the rare oil paintings by Wu in his early days prior to the cultural revolution gives an insight to his endeavours in fusing chinese and western arts; giving a new form of life using dots, lines and planes. This is an exhibition not to be missed if your visit to the gallery is for the arts and not the building!

If you are short of time, it is worth joining one of the free tours to get an overview of the gallery and the exhibits. The tour typically last for an hour and cover one of the galleries.

Being a gallery housed in an historic building it is easy to get distracted when visiting, as the layout and exhibits flow of the gallery are designed to suit the building which is less than ideal. Hence it is natural for many visitors to pause and take photograph of the interior space and architecture while passing through the court rooms and offices.instead of admiring at the art exhibits!

Getting from one gallery to another can be a challenging task due to the lack of clear signage, and the physical layout of the building, this is an area that can be improved to make the visit more enjoyable!"
,,Lovely colonial building with fab rooftop terrace,4.0,,This was the old courthouse and has been extensively renovated to create an interesting Art Gallery with a good mix of Western and more local paintings. It is a lovely space and the terrace bar and restaurant on the sixth floor give spectacular views of Marina Bay Sands across the Padang and the river. Great place for cocktails and fab views especially at night.
,,Pompidou Centre exhibition,4.0,,What a great exhibition - and what a rare opportunity to view the Modernist movement expressed from Europe through to South East Asia. Highly recommended. Congratulations National Gallery!
,,Know your Singapore,5.0,,They conduct excellent walking tours. A good starting place to know a little history of Singapore. The entire architecture is neo-classical blended with modern designs.
,,Free admission (limited time),4.0,,"Weekend chill in this nicely renovated air conditioned free entry, to this ex supreme court of singapore showcasing part of SEA history and fine art pieces."
,,Great selection of southeast Asian art,5.0,,"This museum has a rather unique and impressive collection of Southeast Asian art from early 20th century to the present. Very interesting to compare with parallel art movements in Europe and America and see how they merged western and eastern influences. Another gallery is focused on two very interesting Chinese artists, and a third gallery focuses on the contemporary Singaporean art scene. The building itself is also interesting to see. My only criticism is that it is very difficult to find your way around. Signposting is not very clear and the map is confusing. This is in part due to the nature of the building itself. As an added bonus, students and teachers from anywhere get in for free at the moment."
,,Great way to spend the day,5.0,,Definitely a must place to visit when in Singapore. Went with my little boy (5 years old) and totally enjoyed ourselves. Staff were friendly and engaging. Great place for children and adults alike. Will definitely return again.
,,Awesome visit,4.0,,"After seeing so many good reviews that I just had to come and see for myself. The National Gallery is within walking distance from City Hall MRT station and is open from 10 am till 7 pm. Closing hours is extended till 10 pm on Fri, Sat and eve of public holidays. There is a fee of $20 for non-singaporeans. It is made up of the former Supreme Court and City hall. Do cater for at least about 3 hrs to walk around. Strongly recommend to join the free tour on Building Highlights at either 11 am or 3 pm daily as the guide will show you on the history behind the 2 buildings. After which, you can proceed on your own pace to walk freely. There are a couple of restaurants in the building if you want to rest for some food and drinks. Do make a trip to visit the Aura Sky lounge as it gives you an awesome view on Marina Bay. You can take a seat outside the restaurant if you do not wish to dine in the restaurant or if you prefer, you may order a beer and just soak in the view."
,,Awesome Building Highlights Tour!!!,5.0,,"If you ever visit the National Gallery, register and join the Building Highlights Tour, which is complimentary! These engaging hour-long tours run at different times in English or Mandarin. Registration opens 20 minutes before each tour at the Tour Desk located at B1 Concourse. 20 slots are available per tour on a first come, first served basis. I learnt so much about the history of the buildings, the previous Supreme Court and how the judges used to preside over cases at the courts and how the new buildings were constructed! This is indeed an eye opener into interesting insights and history of Singapore too! Definitely time well spent! The tour guide that showed us around was indeed very knowledgeable and passionate!"
,,Pretty good collection!,5.0,,"The National Gallery is probably one of the new ""must-see"" sights in the city. While it is pretty new, the museum boasts a pretty good Southeast Asian art collection, where you can view paintings by artists that are as good as the masters of art in Europe and North America. The Singapore gallery is also worthy of praise, although much more can be done to include art by members of Singapore's minority ethnic groups. Gallery attendants are extremely friendly - I even got an insight into a painting by a Burmese artist by an extremely knowledgeable member of staff! What I found a bit annoying was the lack of information on the galleries in the guide map - it would be useful to introduce visitors what the galleries contain, and where's the best location to start a proper tour of the museum. Other than that, the art and the architecture (you don't need a ticket to wander around outside the galleries) ensures that this place will make a very worthwhile visit, especially on a hot or rainy afternoon."
,,Superb collection in converted historical buildings,5.0,,"I visited the National Gallery of Singapore shortly after it opened. I was hugely impressed. The buildings used to house City Hall and the Supreme Court and have been beautifully converted into a superb gallery.

The collection it houses is diverse and of the highest quality.

In addition to the collection the TOP floor has some wonderful restaurants and bars."
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,This gallery has arts mainly based on Singapore and Malaysian history. The guide tour was good worth to attend.
,,A wonderful addition to the Singapore art scene,4.0,,This gallery is a standout and definitely worth visiting. It was opened last November and hasn't yet attracted large crowds so it's a very comfortable place to visit and the design of the two old buildings which have been joined together works very well.. There is a good range of Asian art from the earlier times to the present and including traditional and contemporary offerings. Currently there is a special exhibition juxtaposing European and Asian contemporary artists. The gallery has an entry fee for non Singaporeans but seniors do receive a discount. The only irritant was the cost of $11.40 for a cappuccino on Level 6...Much cheaper on the lower level coffee shop.
,,Beautifully transformed place,5.0,,"It used to be the old supreme court. As you explore the building, you will see refurbished furniture from the past. There are also different exhibitions held there from time to time. A place definitely worth going."
,,Definitely worth visiting,5.0,,"What an amazing building! I can absolutely recommend the building tour which is guided by a 'docent'. Our docent, May told us she had to train for 10 months to be allowed to lead the 1-hour tour, but it really showed. Her expertise of the history of the building, the architectural transformation, and just random anecdotes made for a most informative and enjoyable visit. General admission into the gallery afterwards topped off a great visit as we could explore the SE Asian art collection at our own pace. All galleries are staffed - apart from the obvious security function, the staff are pleasant and very enthusiastic about the art collection and the building they're in and are more than happy to chat and provide pointers. So pleased we visited."
,,Beautiful architecture,3.0,,"I had gone to the gallery on Vesak Day and was delighted to learn that I was given free admission to the special exhibition (i.e. Reframing Modernism) if I download their app. The staff at the information counter was very enthusiastic about introducing the gallery and gave good advice on ways to explore the big gallery.

A peaceful place with lots of space to view beautiful Southeast Asian and other international art pieces. I am open to revisiting the gallery in future."
,,Disappointed!,3.0,,"The building is awesome and beautifully retrofitted. However, there is insufficient display of artwork!"
,,Art education at its best!,5.0,,"The new National Gallery Singapore links together two historic buildings - one of which was the former courts of justice. In this building you will find artworks from the colonial period up to the modern day. Here was a fascinating introduction to the history of Singapore and its early explorers who documented not only flora and fauna, but also you find early photography showing the important leaders of the different ethnic groups who comprise modern-day Singapore. There is also a fine exhibition and video of shadow puppets, which surely will entertain the young ones. An excellent exhibition on Reframing Modernism looked at modernism from a Singaporean viewpoint, featuring contemporary artists. We were fortunate enough to be there on a day when two of the artists (who teach at LASALLE College of the Arts) were on hand and spoke about their work. There is also an exceptional artwork made using the art of batik: involving drawing with hot wax and use of multiple dyes, details such as the beads of a necklace or embroideries were rendered in minute detail. a wonderful day - and cooling air-conditioning - located near the City Hall and 'flyer-saucer'-shaped Supreme Court."
,,"Superbe architecture, and large colelction",5.0,,"Recently opened in Singapore, the place desserves a couples of visit to be fully explored.
Super architecture and renovation, many galleries are available, from local artists to collection coming from Centre Pompidou.

A bit chilly inside, think about taking a jumper.

Drinks and food options, definitely needs to be checked: on the ground floor and on the rooftop, with one of the best view on the city. (a bit pricey, but the view and the architectural style...)

Museum and collection are for everyone, lots of interactive system."
,,"Depends on what exhibition you want to see, but the building itself is lovely",4.0,,"I wouldn't come here if I hadn't seen that they have an exhibition called Reframing Modernism. The Gallery surprised me! The building itself was an old supreme court/city hall and had the grandness of the old colonial building. It is always nice to see these kind of buildings in Asia. It makes me reflect on the history. There are two gallery cafes as well, which I didn't eat in. One sells cakes and drinks, the other sells 'proper food' like pastas and salads. It looks nice to sit at. There are big windows everywhere, which lets the light in and gives the building a bright and positive feel.
The exhibitions were also good. There were three. The Wu Guanzhong exhibition showed the works of the Chinese ink master, from his acrylic and oil painting stage to his more modern paintings of ink. It is curated so that you can see his development.
The Reframing Modernism exhibition compares 'western', more well known artist (such as Picasso, Kandinsky, Chagall...) with Asian artist of same style or era. It gives a boost to telling that Asian artists can have international standard works as well. It is also a great a way to see more artists of different origins in Asia. I liked it a lot.
I am most disappoint and disinterest by the Singapore art galleries. Singaporean art does not have a 'main theme' or style. I think it is because of the multi-racial heritage that the country has, therefore when you walk through the galleries, it feels like it is 'jumping' from styles to styles. I did not go through all the galleries of the Singaporean art.
The only thing that interest me about the art, was the Social Table placed outside the Singapore art gallery. It is basically a touch screen table, where you can look at the digital version of all the Singaporean art. You can click on an art piece and see its details or how the artist relates to other artists. Then you can 'save' it, and once you think you have saved all the ones you like, you send it to yourself or a friend. I think this is such a great idea for interaction and even as a 'souvenir'!
It is free to walk around the building. I would recommend people to at least come and see the building itself or have a cup of tea. If you are an art lover, then you could see what's on and decide whether you want to pay to see the exhibits."
,,One of the Best Natural Gallery I have seen,5.0,,National Gallery Singapore is located between City Hall MRT station and Clarke Quay MRT station. I spotted it when i was at Funan the IT Mall and was introduced to this place. A lot of things to see with regards to singapore history and also how the court of the olden days were managed and ran.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"Last week we spend an afternoon in the National Gallery of Singapore. At this moment there is an exposition Reframing Modernism.
We loved it all paintings from South East Asia and Europe. Most of the paintings come from Centre Pompidou. Besides its a beautiful building and if you like to make photos this is a good place for it."
,,So much to see!,5.0,,"I love art museums and the National Gallery is a HUGE one. On top of being a historical visit (The Supreme Court and City Hall make up the structure of the gallery) where you can visit court rooms and holding cells, there are a lot of galleries to peruse in both buildings, and about 5 floors worth in either building.

Both locals and tourists will find something to take away from the gallery at the end of the day. The collections are curated for easy perusal and deep thought all in one go. My favorites are the special Chinese art exhibition on the top floor, followed by ""Siapa Nama Kamu?"" which is a historical Singapore art collection. Free tours are provided in multiple languages.

Unfortunately this gallery closes early at 7pm on weekdays so if you want to ingest things slowly, go from Friday-Sunday when the gallery closes at 10pm instead.

Eating here is pricey: there are two cafes in the building and 5 (I think) posh restaurants in here. Cross the road past the cathedral for more eating options at Raffles City instead."
,,A very good museum,4.0,,"Spent a Sunday afternoon with my family at the National Gallery and we were very impressed by the layout of the building and the available exhibitions.

Truly a world-class building, there is something for everyone: from a children-friendly art-room, to rooms with itinerant exhibitions. There are a couple of cafes and a couple of restaurants within the Gallery, but the selection of food is limited and the prices are well above the average (for the size of the portion)

On the minus side: the layout of the escalators and hallways is very confusing -probably a legacy of creating gallery spaces out of a functional government building.

Well worth a visit for anyone coming to Singapore."
,,Start your visit to Singapore here,4.0,,"If you have any interest in how Singapore came to be the place it is today then you have to go to the National Museum. In a well set out series of exhibits you trace the island's history from ancient times, through the arrival of Raffles and up to the modern day. Invest the time and you will appreciate the country, its people and the extraordinary journey it has undertaken to be the amazing place it is today. As a frequent visitor and past resident I have a particular fondness for the place and that derives in some part from an appreciation of where it came from. The building alone is impressive and testimony to the fact that rabid commercialism was not the sole motive for colonising what was a pretty inhospitable, but strategically well located place back in 1819 when Raffle arrived and did the famous deal with the local Temenggon that ceded the island to Britain for 5000 Spanish dollars a year. Go there and be better informed"
,,Playing Tourist in My Homeland,5.0,,It used to be our Supreme Court now our National Gallery. I am proud & amazed that we have such a majestic structure & building restored to former glory. It has a great selection of South East Asian Arts - our heritage. The staff there are helpful & friendly too. It has a great view at the cafe looking toward the awesome waterfront.
,,Fantastic day out for a artsy date,4.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore houses a lot of different art collections, some more easily understandable than the others by the less art-inclined like me. However, the architecture is a marvel to admire, with a deep history of the Court House too. It is a really wonderful place to spend for a few hours looking at the art pieces and there is even a roof-top bar open till late as recommended by one of the staff!"
,,"Great for adults, great for kids",5.0,,"An amazing adventure awaits at the Keppel Centre for Art Education for those with young children. The Art Playscape with the tree house is truly worth visiting for children. So much space to run away, so many holes to climb in and out of and visually, the place appeals to both old and new. Spend a few hours at the centre -- try other art programmes or hands-on activities. We enjoy it very much with 2 young children."
,,"Fabulous Builing, Disappointing Collection",3.0,,"Being the National Gallery I had high expectations for Singapore, and the experience fell short of my anticipation. The building itself is impressive architecturally, but once inside it too disappoints because of all the twists and turns, going between two buildings and not knowing where the art is. Even the museum map doesn't help much trying to figure it out--good thing their security were helpful. It also doesn't help that multiple levels have VIP special events that they are trying to set up for through the building. The building lacks a vision statement--is it an art museum, conference center, entertainment restaurant/bar venue or VIP event center? It can be a bit exasperating and mind numbing. A few cool things going for it are: the architecture is cool inside, the bar on the top floor has an awesome view, Violet Choo restaurant is delicious, and the modern art gallery space is interesting."
,,Another day out,4.0,,"We visited the newly opened Gallery which is mainly devoted to Singaporean art and culture, The refurbishment of the Supreme Court and City Hall into one place is a wonderful renovation. Plenty of space and very helpful staff. We visited in February and as we were coming back in May we joined the Gallery as it was a cheaper option ( you could visit as many times as you liked) and stay as long as you wanted"
,,Inspiration through art,3.0,,"Visited the national gallery with a Friend recently. I was very impressed with our local artists who did the water color pieces. Many of the art pieces depict the early days of Singapore. For those interested in the history of Singapore, you can even join a tour conducted free of charge. It was a memorable day for us."
,,Absolutely fabulous,5.0,,"The building is just fabulous, inside and out. We checked out this fantastic exhibition called 'Reframing Modernism' which looked at Europeans and Asian artists side by side. One of the best exhibitions I have seen. The gallery space is also just lovely which live music playing in the grand central section of the gallery (fantastic acoustics). I could have spent the whole day there."
,,Stunning,5.0,,"The old City Hall and Municipal Court have been beautifully reworked into a series of galleries over 5 (I think) floors, with places for refreshment too. The art exhibitions are thoughtfully curated and informative, children are well catered for, and purely by luck we were visiting on a Friday afternoon so were able to sit on the main staircase to enjoy an incredibly good ( and I do not use the phrase lightly) music concert by children from a local school. It was the icing on an already excellent cake. Well worth visiting."
,,"Lovely structure, oddly vacant",3.0,,"I stopped by on the Free Electronic Music night, and enjoyed the crowds there to enjoy the music. The ""festival"" feel with lots of folks sitting on the steep stairways leading down into the main gallery was fun. Stepping off into the side galleries, I found a few of them empty. I was not really impressed overall with this place as a museum, but enjoyed the architecture and the music itself."
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,Managed to cover level 2 & 3 this afternoon. Opened my eyes to art by South East Asian artists. The special exhibition happened to be free today so it was a treat to be able to see works by prominent SEA artists alongside European ones.
,,Spectacular building,5.0,,The newly minted National Gallery is a fantastic addition to attractions in Singapore. The beautifully repurposed City Hall and Supreme Court are a first class transformation into a cultural space. The building is huge. We spent all day there much to our surprise with the permanent collection and a fantastic exhibition comparing European and Asian modernism a show that should be seen in Europe and America. The gallery also houses some of the city's best restaurants a fantastic combination of food and art. Don't miss it.
,,Nice place,4.0,,This building was recently done up nicely to house museums and exhibitions with the addition of air conditioning and walkway in between the 2 buildings. Lots of nice textures and lighted areas for a nice walk around with a photoshoot thrown in.
,,Lovely New Museum to Visit,5.0,,"Get out of the heat and spend a few hours in the lovely new national Gallery. A combination of two older, historic buildings, it now houses an interesting and varied collection of Asian and Western art. The galleries are easy to navigate, and have the most friendly staff I have ever encountered in a museum. There is a lovely roof-top bar and garden, and the museum houses a number of well-regarded, expensive restaurants for meals after hours."
,,Singapore Gem - National Gallery Singapore,4.0,,National Gallery Singapore used to be the old Supreme Court. This place is easily accessible by MRT. Is around 7mins walk from the MRT exit B. The museum has many galleries. They remained some of the old court rooms and transformed them into galleries. The collections were all from South East Asia. Art came in different forms and sizes. This is a great place to visit. It worth the trip here.
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Worth a visit if your an Art lover, if you go on a Friday evening it opens late and it's free admission also."
,,Justice at last,4.0,,"Singapore's old court buildings have been linked in an architectural makeover to form a new gallery precinct. Just seeing how they did it makes a visit worthwhile in itself. I am not convinced that the result is an ideal venue for showing art, but there are preserved courtrooms you can also visit and other aspects that appeal. There is an entry fee. A warning: the cafes inside are terribly expensive for what you get. I spent a couple of hours wandering about and found it a soothing escape from frenetic Orchard Road etc. But afterwards don't expect to get a cab back up town easily, especially if the weather is wet. Most people in the cab queue when I was there ending up calling for a taxi."
,,Amazing Building,4.0,,It is worth a visit to see this new building with a $525 million renovation of the old city hall and the Supreme Court. It is huge and will take a day just to see it. There are still spaces under renovation. There are multiple restaurants in this complex and from several deck you get great views of the city. The gallery attendants are the friendliest I have encountered and ready to talk to you about the collection and the building. It is definitely worth a visit.
,,Amazing SE Asian Art Gallery - biggest in Asia,5.0,,"Was lucky enough to go a few days after it opened in November 2015 and have kept going back ever since. Think about the family annual ticket as it is the type of attraction which gets better and better each time you visit and learn more about the ast and the building. The Gallery is so well set out with such a brilliant array of art and artists from all over SE Asia. Something like this is long overdue and Singapore has done Asia proud by hosting such an amazing collection for us all to enjoy.

I just re-visited in order to see the special exhibition ""Reframing Modernism"" which was excellent - in fact I have seen it twice now. So, check out online whether they have anything special on.

Don't miss Gallery 2 ""Drying Salt Fish"" and then see the painting on your $50 bill! Nice!

Look out for the restaurants and the roof top bars too - f=great to hang-out in the twi-light as the views are wonderful across the padang and over to the MBS. Lovely to watch as the sun sets all the lights of this amazing city come on. Such a lovely experience. Please like if this was helpful.
PS look out for the interactive table where you can select your favourites and make your own poster."
,,Excellent museum in Singapore,5.0,,"I visited the museum to see the traveling exhibition from the British Museum, which was excellent. The permanent collection about the history of Singapore is very well done. If you like museums, this is definitely worth the trip."
,,One of my favourite places in Singapore,5.0,,"The National Gallery has become the must visit places in Singapore. Great architecture coupled with amazing nooks to explore, it is as grand as they described it to be. Wouldn't surprise me one bit if this place tops every bride-to-be's list for a wedding shoot.

It's pretty interesting to me that this building is a former Supreme Court of Singapore. In fact, these steps are actually between two buildings, the City Hall.

I had the opportunity to see the National Gallery last year before it was opened to the public, and coming back to the former Supreme Court heritage building, seeing in its complete form was certainly mesmerising. This is still one of my favourite spots, then and now.

One place new that I haven’t yet seen is the rooftop of the National Gallery. There’s a terrace on the top floor which has 2 restaurants, a bar and an open space to hangout."
,,Just the Children's Section (Keppel Centre) - Amazing!,5.0,,"We've only been for grandchildren, so can't review the collections, but the Keppel Centre for Art Education was enormously impressive! Great spaces, with lots of art-related activity/materials to engage and stretch a young person's imagination and creativity. And the consumers? The 1-year old was delighted, the 3-year old was ecstatic.
If you need something to interest young children (up to maybe 5) in Singapore, don't miss it.
And the makeover of the two historic buildings (the Supreme Court Building and City Hall) is stunning, and worth a visit in itself.
There's a superior gallery shop and a good cafe on the ground floor and also, according to the parents of two, quite a number of very good restaurants throughout the building.
Free to Singaporeans and PRs, free for children, and for the rest, $20 per adult and $15 per concession holder."
,,Historical of Supreme Court and Arts Works of older days of SINGAPORE.,5.0,,Anyone who has never being to the olden days of SINGAPORE SUPREME COURTS and CITY HALL. This National Gallery is a good place for visiting and you can still see how Singapore Supreme court lòok like and the historical of OLDEN DAYS OF SINGAPORE being display at the gallery...
,,Great -Art Gallery,4.0,,"We stay for 1/2 day for an Art event and forum. This gallery is very beautiful, they also have a shop inside the gallery where selling some small art item, where you can buy as a gift. If you like a relax afternoon... you can visit this gallery."
,,Singapore's latest attraction,5.0,,2 historic buildings connected through modern architecture. One of the finest collection of South-East Asian art. Some of the best restaurants in the city. A cocktail bar with the best views in town. The new must go destination in Singapore.
,,Wonderful in all ways,5.0,,We enjoyed about 2 hours here and were very impressed by the refurbishment and architectural changes that have been made to the building. We were fortunate to see an exhibition of paintings by the acclaimed artist Wu Guanzhong. A whole day is needed to see and fully appreciate each gallery. There were staff in each gallery to answer any questions about the exhibits. There is a shop with postcards of some of the exhibits and also memorabilia such as scarves and coffee mug. The coffee shop serves excellent coffee. There is an entry fee of $30.
,,Great collection of local and Southeast Asian art,5.0,,"This place houses not just local art and artifacts, but also a great selection of Southeast Asian modern art. The collection is so vast that it's impossible to see each and every piece in under an hour - do allot at least a couple of hours to comfortably explore the entire museum. The two connected buildings formerly housed the Singapore Supreme Court and City Hall, and both have been very well retrofitted and kept in pristine condition - the buildings' architecture is itself worth the visit."
,,brilliant concept successful conversion,5.0,,"What better place for National Gallery for art lovers, converting a historical colonial iconic Supreme court merging seamlessly with the new and modern!
There are enough display of modern arts to whet the imagination of the most demanding, coupled with a rest stop at the roof top garden to contemplate.
You are immediately reminded of the past, looking into the ""padang"" where many cricket and rugby games were played; then up to the viewing gallery to see the NEW Singapore skyline with panoramic view of the Opera house (the durian), Marina Sands Hotel & Flyer across the river
Enjoy the view with a cocktail, coffee or tea
This is art for the most demanding historians and art lovers"
,,2nd visit!,4.0,,"The ushers welcoming us are friendly and cheerful. A little dampened when we reach the ticket counter with non-smiling officers. Hope you guys work on that as it's a great gallery, that needs great vibe all around :)

The gallery officers execute great service too. Overall, an amazing gallery with picturesque interior and nice exhibitions. Locals are free!"
,,Very good places for art lovers in Singapore,5.0,,"My first time in these place, with entrance 20 SGD for non-Singaporean, these place become the one of the good care places. The place is clean and very organized.

It consist of many galleries, which is some of it are temporary thematic. It also has a Gallery&Co. which you can find some art souvenirs or hanging out for brunch.

Nice place and I very recommend if you have taste of art."
,,"Beautiful architecture, a lot of exhibition",5.0,,The building is remodelled and it looks really amazing. I am very impressed by the collection they have in their exhibition. There's 6 floor and it is located just 5 mins walk away from City Hall MRT. Bring your kids along they will also have a great time. A lot of restaurants and cafes too. I spent 2 hours only covered 2 floors!
,,Cooling off in an amazing building,5.0,,"With 100 degree temps, this was a welcomed spot to just wander around the most beautiful of places in Singapore. Even if you don't care for art- the architecture involved will blow you away. And until July?- you can see a Picasso, some Matisse & Chagall- along with some great Asian artists. Beautiful restaurants as well. Call ahead and get the free guided tour( certain hours/day) otherwise you may get lost like we did. But there are heaps of people to ask & direct you. It's immense, lots of stairs and hallways. But not for KIDS!!!!!!"
,,World Class Gallery,5.0,,"The old supreme court and city hall buildings have been remodelled in a brilliant way to create the New National Gallery of Singapore. When we visited the main exhibition was presented in conjunction with the Pompidou Centre of Paris and later in 2016 there will be one in conjunction with the Tate Gallery, London. Leave more time than you think you will need here, there is a lot to see."
,,Clean & Comfortable Gallery,5.0,,National Gallery in Singapore is a comfortable place to stroll around. The toilets are easy to find. Things are well-organized and clean. The Internet connection is free and easy. There are many cafes inside. It is near the Merlion Park.
,,Beautiful look into Southeast Asian art history,5.0,,"Just the building itself was beautiful to look at and walk around.

Great works of art by Singaporean and Southeast Asian masters. Most impressive for me were the works of Chua Mia Tee on the second floor.

I don't particularly know much about art but still enjoyed looking around. Their art reflected the times of change in Singapore, giving a feeling into its recent history."
,,Outstanding Asian art in an outstanding Gallery,5.0,,"We visited the recently opened Singapore National Gallery while breaking our journey between Australia and Europe. On the way to the ticket counter we were approached by a volunteer guide and invited to join her for a free one hour tour of the Asian art exhibition located in the former City Hall. This turned out to be a most enjoyable and highly informative introduction to the Nanyang school of artists given by a most enthusiastic and knowledgeable gallery guide. Her choice of works, both paintings and sculptures, gave an excellent insight into a clearly highly talented and individualistic art movement which is reflective of the growth of a distinctive Singaporean identity. The concept of linking the old City Hall and the former High Court buildings has been beautifully realised. The art is wonderful and the volunteer guide's enthusiastic explanations meant that we spent well over an hour in her company before venturing off on our own. A wonderful, interesting, informative and most enjoyable experience. Very highly recommended."
,,Outstanding gallery filled with extraordinary art,5.0,,"First of all the buildings. Extraordinary interior spaces. Amazing meld of old and new architecture.Next the art. I've been to many European galleries. This was the first one in Asia. It took me a little while to adjust my expectations and relax into it. Fabulous insights into cultures that I know little of but am fascinated by. For instance, I never knew how sophisticated, varied and expressive is the art of ink painting. I could have spent a week in this gallery rather than an afternoon and will go back when I return to this amazing city."
,,Wonderful art museum,5.0,,"This is a wonderful art museum celebrating the talent of the artists of Southeast Asia. The featured exhibit was a side-by-side comparison with works by renowned artists such Chagall, Matisse, and Picasso. We had a delicious lunch at the museum's National Kitchen restaurant shown in the photo."
,,Much better than expected,4.0,,"Art history is a personal passion and given some of the reviews on TA and elsewhere, I had very low hopes for this museum. Fortunately, my experience was better than all those reviews. We ended up spending over 3 hours when we'd expected to be there only for one.

The current temporary exhibit juxtaposing works from the Pompidou Center with Asian art was quite good. Although quite familiar with all the Western artists shown, the Asian artists were new to me. This show was a very good introduction.

Perhaps this temporary exhibit helped my appreciation, but we enjoyed the remaining galleries of Asian art. Seeing the timeline and especially some of the art produced during the US involvement in the Vietnam War was illuminating.

We thought the architectural rehabs were stunning - even though we did get lost a few times. In fairness, I do not have a good track record of following maps, so it is not surprising I got confused.

Drinks on the top floor with gorgeous views were a special treat. There was also a free Sunday performance from young musicians from one of Singapore's music schools. Very nice space for a performance in the entrance area and performers were well prepared.

I hope to return."
,,Not quite up to mark,3.0,,"I was going to give a 2 out of 5 rating but had to increase the rating for the amazing refurbishment efforts and architectural value of this place.

I've only good things to say of the exhibit on level 3 which was the temporary exhibition with brilliant works by Matisse, Picasso and some obviously brilliant South East Asian Artists. Too bad it ends in July.

The rest of the Galleries were hard to follow and you end up walking in circles looking for the next gallery in sequence. Signage were not very good and some signs looked cheap. The permanent artwork are not well displayed nor lit up and not well curated. Many of the artwork labels could not be read as there was a cover over them that made the wordings blurred, made worst by the lack or proper lighting. There were a lot of good pieces and the gallery is still worth going to but you would want to just walk past half the displays.

Still, I would recommend going for the temporary exhibition and architecture."
,,Disappointed with the renovation,2.0,,"The building is one of the landmark in the country so that before I stepped inside, I expected the renovation would be maintained the heritage and included education purpose. In fact, there are venues displaying the objects from the original rooms. However, the direction instruction of the galleries and venues is not well indicated. In addition, the environment is too blank and cold. I'm not impressed with the overall use of the building."
,,"Marvelous refurbishment og buildings, room for improvement.",3.0,,"The newest museum in Singapore is situated at the Old City Hall and High Court buildings which have been beautifully refurbished and offers possibilities for a great museum. Strangely the building itself and the exhibits related to the building´s past is the most impressive part.
The art exhibitions vary quite a lot, and I definitely prefer the first floor exhibition of art from the region. This is beautifully presented and should be of interest for all tourists.
Visiting this floor and seeing the buildings is well worth the visit. There is a large area to keep visiting children active.
The next two floors were a disappointment to us, but knowing the Singaporean ability to create interesting museums I am sure it shall improve.
The restaurants are below par for the area, especially on days where the best restaurant is used for an external congress."
,,Sensational architecture,5.0,,I was very impressed with how they conserved and modernised the old City Hall and Supreme Court. They kept true to the original architecture while updating the building with new exhibition spaces and turning the previous open air space between the two buildings into a gorgeous light filled modernist walkway! Love it! Lots of good restaurants here too!
,,Nice architecture,3.0,,"Enjoyed the building itself more than the art pieces.

The gallery is easily accessible by train (City Hall MRT), but inside is less easy to navigate. Recommend stopping by Information Centre before starting.

Plus point: most exhibits are free for Singapore citizens! For families, there is also an exhibit/hands-on area for children."
,,Amazing Building and Some Great Artwork,4.0,,"Not normally one for artwork, I was impressed with the National Gallery. The building itself (a combination of two building linked with several walkways) is extremely impressive, but outdone by the artwork. Be sure to work your way through the permanent collection of statues and artwork that tell the story of Asian artwork progression over the years."
,,Our Gallery of Treasures,4.0,,"As Singaporeans, we are proud and privileged to have a gallery of paintings to admire. We visited National Gallery Singapore on a Friday morning. After collecting our tickets at the Concourse, we proceed to tour the gallery and explore the collection of artworks.
City Hall and Supreme Court are the perfect buildings to house the gallery. Their grandeur and historic significance provide the suitable ambience for us to experience and be inspired by artists and masters.
Through the works of Southeast Asian artists and Singaporean artists, we were shown aspects of life back then and what were important to them. The special exhibitions, in particular Wu Guanzhong Gallery, should not be missed. Master Wu Guanzhong's works are amazing and perfect combination of east and west arts.
It was a good break to spend a morning at the National Gallery Singapore, to immerse ourselves in arts and culture. The collections will surely grow and we look forward to our next visit."
,,"Hidden gem, this relatively new museum impresses",5.0,,"Houses an excellent collection of art work from south east Asia and Asia and general. The building comprises the former City Hall and the further Supreme Court buildings which have been painstakingly refurbished into a modern, lavish museum building. Lots of fine dining to choose from. The Keppel creativity center is great for kids who can try their hands on art expression. Don't miss the historical prison cells where prisoners used to be held below the court."
,,The buildings are the greatest pieces of art.,4.0,,"We came to this part of town to look at the colonial heritage buildings and found that two previous governor and justice buildings had now been merged into this lovely gallery.
The gallery only opened last year and is still building it's collection so some areas are quite barren, but it is a very large gallery and will take some filling. But to me the best art in the place are the two buildings that have been meticulously combined to interlink and become this excellent show-piece.
The scale and depth of detail in some of the huge expansive rooms bring to mind 18th century dinner/dances with débutantes gowned in the most glorious dresses and English and Dutch gentlemen holding court.
The circular room that was once the justice court holds your eyes as you sweep around huge ceilings.
Once the gallery obtains a larger collection of artefacts this could become a world class location."
,,Not one to be missed - excellent collection of Asian (with a focus on SE Asia),5.0,,"This gallery only opened its doors in November 2015. When we went at the beginning of March 2016, several exhibits were still not operational but this is just a small section. The vast majority of the gallery was already on the display. The remaining was slated to open in April.

The gallery is housed in two monuments, the old City Hall and former Supreme Court. The architects have tastefully combined these two monuments, enclosing the space between and building a few bridges between in modern minimalist design. I thought it was an excellent marriage of neo-classical and contemporary style. The designers have also done a commendable job of preserving the old court rooms within the Supreme Court and using them as the exhibit rooms.

The Supreme Court section houses an extensive collection of South East Asian art spanning 150 years. I have not seen a collection elsewhere as good. I don't think a gallery needs a Renoit or Van Gogh to be considered world class. it's quite refreshing to see an Asian centered gallery for a change. There are talents here that need to be recognized."
,,"Decent Museum, but fairly empty",3.0,,"I spent an afternoon wondering around, and incidentally stumbled upon this building. Awesome old Capital building (Still used today i believe), but all the art was heavy to only ""Asian"" influences, perhaps that naive to say, but didn't seem like a broad array of options. As well, LOTS of empty.
However, the Modern Art section was great! Though small"
,,On the way to world class,4.0,,"We like art galleries, we like visiting national collections they help us understand the cultural and iconographic history of a society. This one has top marks for the works it contains. We're very familiar with the impact of Asian and S E Asian art on Europeans like Gaugin, Rousseau, Picasso, the Ballet Russes etc but not with influences moving in the other direction: the development of SE Asian artists as they got to grips with European imagery. These works were all new to me and I enjoyed coming to grips with them. When will there be an exhibition of this work in a major European art gallery?

However while the collection is world class there needs to be some work still on how the collection is exhibited before the whole thing is world class.
The renovated buildings that house the collection are wonderful in themselves but a bit of a nightmare to navigate. We were very grateful for the advice given by a woman at the visitors desk about how to plan our route round the buildings. There is no comprehensive guide book. There is a floor plan which you get with your ticket but on its own it's hard to make sense of.
There was an audio,guide but you can only hire it if you have a photo ID. unfortunately we always lock our passports ( our only photo ID) in our hotel safe when we travel so we didn't have enough ID. In other places we have been able to leave a credit card or cash deposit. But not here. There will be an android app but that wasn't ready when we visited.

There are very friendly staff in each gallery who approach and welcome you when you enter. But most of them seem to know little about the art works in the rooms, and could not answer, or in some cases understand the questions we asked. It is true that I would not expect 'security' staff in galleries to be expert in the works they looked after, but they would never normally approach me apparently to tell me about the works: and the staff at the National Gallery did approach me, so I presumed they knew the works and wanted to talk to me about them.

The final disappointment was being sent to the roof terrace cafe ( 'smoke and mirrors') to relax and have coffee, to be told when we arrived that the coffee machine wasn't working and we couldn't have coffee.
Second time in 3 days I've been told this on this holiday. What's the problem with local coffee machines?
I can't imagine the National Gallery in London not being able to serve coffee ( and consequently cake and what goes with coffee) in its main cafe. Cafes in galleries in the world are significant income generators, this needs fixing.

But I'll be back to see the pictures, and to buy a guide book when there is one."
,,Modern art in Old walls,4.0,,"Yes, this majestic building from twenties was transformed by the architects into a beautiful Art Gallery. The patio covered with glass roof on wich the waer is sparkling, big entrance hall between the gallery and the Court of Justice is also very interesting. The new temporary exibitions are hels on the graound floor and some of them are really good. The upper floors mostely local production since the beginning of the country and some others temporary expos. The roof top is fabulous because it offers you a panoramic view of the Marina Bay and other parts of the city. Nice restaurant/bar to make a break. Worth going there only for the view. unfortunately the entrance fee is expensive (20SGD) per adult"
,,Just great,5.0,,Archi and designers wil lovel this place where a new modern structure has been inserted in between two historical buildings to create the ideal place for exhibitions in town. Nice view from the top terrace and lounge.
,,"No Monets nor Picassos here, but still mighty proud of this place",4.0,,"There isn't any impressive world renown paintings in its galleries. But this is just NGS's first year and I see much potential in this gallery finding its place in the likes of Louvre and MET!
Amazing architecture! You could still walk into the holding cells of the supreme courts and waltz in the grand city hall chamber.
For now, the permanent collection consist mainly of SEA artists and their works that are mostly inspired during the colonial periods.
Kudos to chirpy staffs at the information counters and the helpful staffs at the various galleries."
,,Gallery with A Great Collection of Southeast Asian Arts,5.0,,"The gallery is located in the former City Hall and Singapore Supreme Court buildings. Opened in November 2015, the gallery is another great example of conservation of old buildings. The gallery houses two permanent exhibitions, one dedicated for Southeast Asian arts and one for Singaporean arts. Definitely a must visit location for anyone interested in Southeast Asian arts."
,,Southeast Asian Art History at its best,5.0,,"I lived in Singapore for more than 7 years and was a docent at the Singapore Art Museum before the National Gallery was built. I recently returned after a 3 year absence and went directly to the new museum. It was like visiting an old friend who had a major makeover. I still love SAM and its beautiful colonial building and its great contemporary exhibits, but the much bigger National Gallery finally allows Singapore to display its incredible holding of Southeast Asian Art from colonial times to modernity. I had a Filipino friend in tow and we spent hours following the development of Filipino modernism from one gallery to the next. The galleries are organized by time period and it is possible to study any of the SE Asian countries in detail. They also have galleries dedicated to Wu Guangzhou and Chua Ek Kai (my favorite Singapore artist) as well as contemporary Singapore art. The museum also provides an incredible APP that can be downloaded from the App store.

The building is the old supreme court building very elegant--with brass banisters and wood moldings and trim. My only complaint is the layout is very confusing but many guides circulate in the building to help you find various galleries. The app has a map and there are maps in the lobby.

If you plan to visit several places in SE Asia start your visit here and at the Asian Civilization museum. But don't forget the vibrant contemporary art scene in Singapore and visit SAM and the many galleries around town. It is an art paradise!"
,,Stunning New Museum,5.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore opened in late 2015. It combines the former city hall and supreme court buildings in a stunning reconfiguration and preservation of both. The rehabilitation preserved many of the best features of both buildings while creating new gallery spaces. Some of the galleries were devoted to very modern art by artists from Singapore or SE Asian countries. Some galleries were devoted to more traditional Chinese artists, which we found more to our liking/ We enjoyed walking through both buildings and enjoying what was available in the galleries. There are several places to eat from simple coffee shops to upscale gourmet restaurants. There is an entry fee and discounts for seniors."
,,A world-class national treasure,5.0,,The exhibits are impressive but the architecture and historical significance of the building is even more impressive. Truly spectacularly restored and world/class in standard. Love the high tech aspects too of interactive guided tour apps etc. A must-go for locals and foreigners alike.
,,A new gallery with potential for growth,3.0,,It's a nice place to visit and quite relaxing if you want a day out. It costs $20 for foreigners (including those on work visas) but free for Singaporeans. Our only wish was that there could be more information given about the art pieces as we didn't know much about art. We have been to various galleries in other countries and the good ones are those which try to really educate the viewers about the meaning/historical context of the artwork.
,,"Wonderful building, beautiful art.",5.0,,"We arrived at opening time on a Saturday morning. Not too busy at all. Being in the older age group were able to get a concession . We spent over two hours there and didn't see it all. However we saw what we had sat out to see. The attendants in the galleries were most helpful and several gave us extra information about the works of art.
At the social table we were able to create posters of things we liked. These are emailed to you. Amazing. Don't miss the Social Table. Like all things Singaporean it has been done with great style and innovation. A must see for all art lovers."
,,Supremely Interesting...,3.0,,"Think it must be great for connoisseurs of the art, but unfortunately for the rest of us plebians -- it's hard to appreciate the place. Revitalized from old Supreme Court, the grandeur and decorum of the place still holds true till today. For example, the kids area, at the Keppel Centre for Art Education tells you specifically that the children are not allowed to run, jump and to keep as quiet as possible! Great place for muzzled kids in strait-jackets!

Nice to see the grand-dame fully restored, but certainly don't expect warm welcomes (especially from those greeting you at the door). The staff must have been told that all visitors must toe the line and they keep you in their cross-hairs -- all the time.

The architecture is certainly marvelous and distinctive. But unfortunately, there's a lot of dead-space all over the place. Pretty bewildering -- just ask for directions -- that's the best way.

Great for tourist -- but don't bring the kids until they turn 21. If you're wondering around the vicinity, drop by for a cool respite from the heat, and even cooler reception by their fellow staffers!

I would bring visitors to the place just to appreciate it's rich historical past, but if anyone were to ask me for my personal opinion of the National Gallery of Singapore, I would tell them it's much like a vacuum cleaner -- it sucks!"
,,From Court to Gallery,4.0,,"Walk along Civic district and feel the past of Singapore by seeing the architecture and design of the old buildings dating back to British colonial times.

It was the Old supreme Court and a City Hall of SG. The architecture shows British influence. It focuses on displaying Singapore and Southeast Asian art from the 19th century to present day.

Singaporeans/PRs: Free entry
Non-Singaporeans Standard: $20; Children (6 years and under): Free"
,,MAJESTIC BUILDING WITH THIRD WORLD OPERATIONS,2.0,,"My highly anticipated visit to the National Gallery in Singapore did not get to a good start with my encounter with Irene Tan at the Ticket counter, she's one of the most ignorant and patronising individual we have ever come across!

The gallery is only free to locals and not to foreigners. Combining both the former Supreme Court and City Hall is really impressive indeed however makes the experience very confusing to navigate, criss crossing between buildings and at times we come to dead ends.

The artwork on displayed are predominately S.E. Asia contemporary art and Chinese artists. Don't expect any Picasso or Monet. Is simply don't think the contents and the staff live up to the majestic building.

I have been keeping an watchful eye at Singapore's culture developments over the years. If I dare say, Singapore only just begun to come to terms with it's history and showing appreciation of its heritage. It still has a some way to go yet before I rate it up there with Tate in London, MoMA in New York...

Lastly, the logo of the NG in Singapore reminds me of the logo of the Serpentine Galleries in London. Am I the only person who noticed that?!"
,,Incredible building,5.0,,"Opened in November 2015, this architecturally innovative building encloses the old Supreme Court and city hall buildings in a new, glass structure. Some of the beautiful old rooms are preserved, creating gallery space in the context of historically important spaces. The collection is unusual and ambitious. Don't miss the Smoke and Mirrors bar on the roof at night for incredible views of the skyline (open after the museum closes)"
,,Singapore's Newest Masterpiece,5.0,,"The new National Gallery is a spectacular building (actually two historic buildings joined with an impressive glass canopy) making the structure worth a visit by itself. But what surprised was the excellent collection of Asian art from historic to modern. Wonderful Asian masterpieces from many different countries, either part of the permanent collection or on loan. Many of the staff in the exhibition halls perform more like docents than guards, welcoming visitors and providing brief info on the exhibits. Don't miss the modern art collection, which has some fun installations. Seniors note that Singapore national museums have a reduced entry fee for foreign visitors over 60 and the savings can add up."
,,Not to be Missed While in Singapore,5.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore opened last November and holds the largest public collection of modern art in the city-state and all of Southeast Asia. The gallery is housed in two national monuments- the City Hall and former Supreme Court- that have been re-imagined as a new visual arts institution. The superb restoration and recycling of these buildings is a sight to see in itself. One can enjoy losing oneself in its many galleries that feature permanent and temporary exhibitions. We found the the exhibition on the work of Wu Guanzhong: ""Beauty Beyond Form"" especially interesting.
Plan to stay several hours here as it is well worth it!!"
,,A wonderful building with excellent exhibits,5.0,,"This newly opened gallery offers an excellent opportunity to view South East Asian art in wonderful surroundings. A practical tip: there are excellent large lockers in the basement, where visitors can safely leave even bulky belongings while they visit the galleries or restaurants."
,,Worth the time spent,4.0,,"This is a converted museum that was formally the High Court and the City Hall buildings. The two buildings are linked by the walk way installed. The external facade remained as it was with a new addition of the coconut leaves look-alike roof.

The interior remained as it was but used for exhibition of artwork. Some photo explanation of the old high court where the holding rooms were. Two of the rooms were retained to remind the visitors of its grime past.

The roof top lounge offered a good view of the Padang and the CBD area.

Singaporean and permanent residence need not pay to enter."
,,Old meets the new,5.0,,"This building was the former Supreme Court and has been transformed into an awesome National Gallery. Just loved this place which houses a lot of great art works from the region. At times I felt like I was in some museum in Europe so this is something Singaporeans ought to feel proud of so well done to the those who completed this restoration.

To get here get on the MRT and get off at City Hall and go to exit B and it is about a 5 minute walk away."
,,"Magnificent achitecture, contemporary south-east Asian art",4.0,,"The roof garden on the 6th floor is free of access and is well worth it for the view of the Singapore skyscrapers including the famous one with a ship-shaped roof. Two old buildings have been joined by a new gallery. The museum is very difficult to navigate. Some glass doors open automatically, others do not. The signs are thoroughly confusing. Even the free maps do not give sufficient information on how to get from one building to the other and what to see in the galleries. Fortunately there are friendly employees everywhere ready to give information."
,,well worth a visit - and have a drink at sunset on the rooftop bar,5.0,,"I went late on a Sunday - with only 2 hours of visiting time available. It was well organised, and cool oasis for appreciation of some Asian art - and I think there is something for everyone. It also gives a sense of history of Singapore linking the origins as a British development to the modern thriving economy that it is today. I didn't have time to see everything but I will definitely go back next time. In addition I went to the roof top bar and had a drink and enjoyed the sunset - also well worth a visit."
,,New use for old buildings,5.0,,"The National Gallery is what used to be City Hall and the Court House now beautifully restored and joined with an amazing architectural construction that keeps the feel of the old buildings but preserves them for the future. Paintings, art, architecture and history are all displayed in amazing venues. For me the highlight of the tour was a visit to the 'surrender room' where Japan surrendered at the end of WWII. I was able to stand where my dad had been in 1945. Moving and thrilling at the same time. If you go take one of the tours and if you are lucky you might get Jo one of the docents - she was fantastic."
,,more than your expectation,5.0,,"Looking for Singaporean own history. But when we visited, there were some exhibits borrowed from British Meseum, which we totally didnt expect. Jaw-dropping show, each every item is precious and beautiful. Even bumped into a Michelangelo's draft and Rembrandt... well-designed, friendly, oh, free wifi too😉😉"
,,Impressive,5.0,,"The new national gallery in Singapore is a very impressive structure having been rebuilt from two old buildings - the old courthouse and old parliament house. It is really very well done and while primarily an art gallery, it is also part museum.

The national gallery is definitely worth a visit. The focus is very much in regional art which is what it should be.

Highly recommended"
,,World Class Museum,5.0,,"National Gallery Singapore opened just 4 months ago and it is a tour de force both architecturally and in terms of art. The renovation and connecting together of the old Supreme Court and City Hall buildings was brilliantly done and has the look and feel of a great museum. There is a brilliant childrens' wing that is open during the same hours as the rest of the museum so whenever you get there there is something engaging for the kids to do. Some of the galleries were not open as they were changing exhibits, but the ones that were gave more than enough to see. Especially wonderful (to me) was the exhibit of the Chinese artist Wu Guanzhong. The National Gallery is worth every minute you spend there. Free for locals. Reasonable for visitors. Senior discount."
,,Stunning conversion.....very short on .. good ART!,2.0,,"Much has rightly been written about the dazzling conversion/amalgamation of two colonial architectural masterpieces --- & rightly so have the architects been so universally congratulated.
So if architecture + Singapore's history is your thing, by all means visit here...but if art per se is what moves you --don't waste your time. The best is weak --with one notable exception that is an entire permanent gallery devoted to the work of the world famous Chinese artist Wu Guanzhong..& one suspects, given the Sing Govt's belated shift into the business of promoting art to it's people--the artist might not infact even be much represented there, given that most of the works on show he has in fact gifted to the Singaporean Govt.. Having said that it IS informative & delightful..I enjoyed it..but there's little else of artistic substance worth pursuing.

The galleries are topped with a super bar ( + there are expensive restaurants within various locations throughout) that has an amazing wide-screen , totally unencumbered view towards Marina Bay Sands. There however they have that curious Singaporean ""we know everything & we do everything better anyway"" attitude the Govt has wipped into 'em since birth & so when I ordered the not unusual Bloody Mary for my afternoon tipple, I was bluntly refused. Why So? I asked, incredulously,
It seems they don't stock Tomato Juice. Why? I asked again. Silence. Very Sing that lot! I did have a nice Campari & Orange though..but for the shockingly high $18 I was slugged, think I should at least have had freshly squeezed juice don't you ? Ripp-off!"
,,Excellent and very interesting.,5.0,,The National Gallery of Singapore was excellent and it is a very good activity to do when it is raining in Singapore. There are four levels to see and explore. It is hard to navigate within the museum because the signs are not very clear but I believe they are working on it! It is definitely a nice enjoyable morning or afternoon to spend.
,,A must go in Singapore,5.0,,"Buffer at least half-a-day for this visit if you want to view the collection, somewhat, in detail. The lifts are a little slow in this building which I don't know why.

Make your way to the rooftop, you will have another view of Singapore from there."
,,Take a drink on the rooftop bar for a different view of Singapore!,5.0,,"We didn't spend much time in the art galleries, but we enjoyed what we did see. The layout of the museum is very nice and the exhibits are not too crowded (in terms of content), which I personally like. To our surprise, there were hardly any people in the National Gallery, although it was a Sunday.

There is a rooftop bar and restaurant, which you can access without purchasing a ticket. We took a drink up there and sat for well over an hour, taking in the views and the atmosphere on the cricket / football pitch below.

I suggest not buying a ticket, seeing the free galleries (of which there are two) and then heading to the roof for a drink / snack."
,,Fantastic Collections,5.0,,"I earn more about Malaysia visual arts history in the National Gallery of Singapore than from the Malaysia National Visual Arts Gallery.

Artworks of Redza Piyadasa in the sensational art exhibition called ""Towards a Mystical Reality, 1974"" were displayed and explained in details. This is part of ""A Fact Has No Appearance: Art Beyond the Object,"" exhibition which runs until June 19, 2016.

Catch this rare curated show!"
,,Historial architecture with attractive exhibits,4.0,,"It is just in downtown and easy to go there. No entrance fee. It is originally the old Supreme court and now renovated as the National Gallery. So, the building itself already take time to appreciate. The exhibits are attractive and definitely takes time to appreciate one by one. Other than than, must visit its roof to look out the amazing scene around it."
,,Great addition to Singapore cultural offerings,5.0,,"Our Singaporean friend brought us here and we were greatly impressed. The historic buildings have been wonderfully restored and converted to an art museum. Unfortunately, our visit was too short to view all of the great exhibits.

In addition to the art, be sure to go to the roof and walk around outside. The roof has been converted into a very pleasant area and the views of Singapore from there are not to be missed.

Also not to be missed is the National Kitchen by Violet Oon. This restaurant created by a local celebrity chef provides a great opportunity to appreciate Singapore's culinary heritage. Be sure to make reservations in advance."
,,"Interesting history, artwork and restaurants",4.0,,"Interesting architecture of the1930s, helpful staff, very good modern Indian restauran where we enjoyed lunch. We only had time to see the South East Asian galleries on this visit, they were most interesting."
,,Wonderful gallery,5.0,,"A wonderful gallery; situated in the old Supreme Court the building itself is interesting and has been sympathetically converted into a new gallery space enabling visitors to enjoy the architecture of the building and the exhibits.

The $20 entrance fee is excellent value as it's easy to spend 3 hours plus enjoying everything the gallery has to offer.

The staff are wonderfully helpful at helping you to plan your visit and with any other questions.

Make sure to go to the top floor to take in the views."
,,For those who love art and architecture,4.0,,"Excellent architecture of the building and well renovated. It is free entrance for Singaporeans. You get to visit the old supreme court and facilities used by the chief justice. In the art gallery, you will see a reasonable collection of art. Best would be to go on a guided tour on artwork as otherwise you would miss the hidden messages in them. Don't miss the view at top floor. You will see the financial district, marina bay sands and the Singapore cricket club."
,,Spending a nice afternoon in NGS,4.0,,"1st time visit NGS, to my surprise it is Free admission to Singaporeans. This is a very good & encouraging move. It will entice more parents to bring their children to visit the gallery more often and get in touch of art and learn more when they are young.

Register with your ID/NRIC at basement and the customer service will give you a sticker to identify whether you are a foreigner or Singaporean.

Gallery map available at counter.
You may start from top floor (Garden terrace to enjoy panaromic view of MBS) to level 4,3 to appreciate art pieces, former Supreme Court till basement to view former prison cells.

We are allow to take photos in galleries as rememberance."
,,an international art gallery in Singapore,4.0,,"It is a master piece of architecture, marrying the old and the modern.Just for this , it is worth to go. The exhibit are still limited , but the few already opened are of international standards.
Location is easy to access and the view is awesome.
The Gallery is 1/3 bigger that the National Gallery in London."
,,Highlight for us was the rooftop view!,5.0,,"This is an architecturally stunning complex, as well it should be in Singapore, with all the architectural competition. They have blended the historical and the new very well, and it is worth admiring. The exhibit appeal depends on your taste, as with any museum display. But the roof top is fabulous. There are restaurants up there, but there is a walkway about 3/4 around the top of the building with stunning views of the city and no crowds. Beautifully designed, the rooftop is landscaped with water features and many places to linger. You can see the entire city from here from many different angles. This alone was worth the price of admission."
,,Don't miss this if you are visiting Singapore,5.0,,"This is a SG50 jubilee gift from the government to the citizens of Singapore, and what a gift it is. It is a visual arts institution which houses the most number of art from South-East Asia, and it is situated in the former Supreme Court and City Hall (which was given a full renovation while retaining the charm and historic structures of the old buildings). I set aside about 4 hours to look at the art as well as the architecture, as well as having a coffee at the end, and I was left impressed and wanting for more.

I would recommend you to visit this place at 10am when it opens so that you can view the art in relative peace and quiet. Start from the ""City Hall"" side where you can view the historic Singapore art and work your way up from the 1st floor. Cross the bridge at the top floor, and make your way down the ""Supreme Court"" side, viewing the rotunda as you go. The ""Supreme Court"" part has more gallery exhibitions which are mostly from South-east Asia. There are a few pieces there which are truly stunning.

The National Gallery also has an app which you can download prior to going so you can plan your visit. I think it's fun but it's not necessary. Sometimes the best thing about viewing art is coming round the corner and seeing a beautiful piece which captures your eye.

There is a expansive children's section on the Ground floor which is very impressive. Plenty of top-notch cafes and restaurants let you have breaks throughout your visit. Get a coffee from the cafes on the Ground floor (near the gift shops - I think they are called Vanilla Bakery Cafe - very good coffee). All in all, the NatGall is a very well-planned gallery, and truly an example of how Singapore can shine when she puts her mind to it.

Bravo, Singapore! Well done."
,,Spend a quiet morning taking in the art of south east asia,5.0,,This attraction has been recently opened. They have done a wonderful job of restoring the old Supreme Court and City Hall buildings. I got the same feelings as I got when I was walking into the Capitol building in Washington. That level of finishing and sophistication in design. Don't bother renting the modified I pods to listen to guides. Just bring along your smart phone and there is free WiFi which allows you to download the app and yes do bring along a pair of earphones and listen away to the rich guides that accompany most artwork or follow the virtual tour. The entry fee is a bit steep at SGD 20 for foreigners but it is free for citizens and permanent residents. They don't only have works by Singaporean artists but also of major artists from all over South East Asia. My first impression was they have raided the art collections of the region! but to see them conserved and curated so wonderfully justifies the means at least in my humble opinion. They many levels and wings so take the time. Put aside the whole morning. There is 7 restaurants in the building but it appears on the pricey side.
,,Not for foreigners,2.0,,"When you enter the walls seem bleak for an art gallery until you learn that foreigners are charged admission: can't have then seeing art for free after all.
If you are interested in historical Singapore or in modern South East Pacific art then it is a must see. Otherwise you're probably better off spending the money on something else.
Many pieces are done in the Manet style and appear historical were done in the 1960s or 1970s.
Some of the stuff by Georgette Chen was charming.
In fact most of the art is post-1950, which is alright except that it is not worth the $20 cover charge to see it."
,,Important part of Singapore history,5.0,,"Situated In the old Supreme Court Building and City Hall, many will find the actual buildings more interesting than the art.
There’s a guided tour daily, at 11am which concentrates on the history of the building. Places are limited to 20, and photo ID is required (I think this is to ensure visitors do not walk off with the headsets). The tour should last an hour, but it actually took 90 minutes. The volunteer guide had worked in the court as an usher which made the tour personal. Also another of our group had regularly visited the courtroom in his lunch hour to listen to the proceedings.
Judging by our group, about 50% were local, so this tour appeals to everybody.
We also loved the views of the city from Level 6.
Excellent toilets are available in several places on every floor. Disabled access is great, with lifts and ramps as necessary. There were plenty of places to sit, except when waiting for the guided tour to start, where seating was inadequate (5 seats for 20 people).
Our only disappointment was lunch, bought from Gallery & Co on Level 1. The sandwiches were tasty, but I really expect a café in that price range to serve them on a plate, perhaps with a side salad and not just wrapped in paper. We had to get the staff to cut them in half to make it practical to eat them. And it was the first place in Singapore which hasn’t offered ice with soft drinks. Better food options are available outside the museum.
We didn’t have time in the end to see the art galleries, that will have to wait for another visit. But we really enjoyed learning about the history of the buildings, and the way the courts worked in Singapore both under British rule, and after independence. Don’t miss this new attraction."
,,Stunning Sights!,5.0,,This newly revamped building is a must-visit in Singapore. It utilizes technology through large touch-screen displays as well as mobile applications to better enhance your experience.
,,Amazing architecture,4.0,,May not have the history of European galleries but it's a step in the right direction for Singapore. Well worth the $20 entry fee.
,,Top notch but what a lot of wasted space,5.0,,"This is a truly impressive gallery. We started off with 5 kids in the children's section and whiled away a couple of hours while they drew and cut and stuck. Venturing into the galleries via the enormous spaces you're struck by the amount of space and passage way and space and space.
The curation is good, the ambiance in the individual galleries good, the signage and explanation good.
Liked the communual spaces for making your own posters to email to yourself.
Thought it was somewhat pricey and didn't like the 2 tier pricing system - At the very least their could be a tier for tax-paying residents who are not PR or Singaporean, after all our money goes towards paying for this."
,,Gorgeous building full of historical significance,5.0,,"Almost 2 decades ago, I took my wedding photos with my husband on the steps of City Hall.

Today I took photos with my husband and daughter on the same steps- except it has been renamed National Gallery and is now open to public after a $500+ million renovation.

Beautifully integrated with the former Supreme Court via a glass canopy, shielded from harsh sunlight by an attap-like roof propped up by a mega steel-tree structure, the entire building is awe-inspiring, majestic and surprisingly serene.

One cannot help but marvel at the many different facets of the building- from the rooftop terrace offering an unobstructed view of the Padang and Marina Bay skyline, to the fascinating old holding cells where defendants were held while awaiting trial.

No detail has been overlooked and the whole place somehow still retains a sense of intimacy despite the massive scale of the project.

The historic art collections are but the icing on the cake. The beauty of the architecture and majesty of the building steal are enough to steal the spotlight for any visitor.

A must-see."
,,I'm coming back!!,5.0,,"First visit and it won't be my last!! I love the art work. I discovered so many lovely pieces that I would love to come back and admire.

Just a few wishes. More signage, perhaps a map to be given upon buying tickets, and just explain a bit to first time visitors about the layout. More benches in the galleries would be perfect, so we can sit and enjoy the beautiful artwork.

I am getting on in years so I can't keep walking for hours. The coffee shop was not too impressive, but I only tried the one near the gift shop."
,,Beautiful museum!,5.0,,Beautiful architecture..very skilly restored while respecting its history as a previous supreme court of Singapore ..nicely curated local asian artworks on one block and modern artworks on another block. Very nice but expensive restaurants in the museum..need more mid price cafe and food outlets.
,,Impressive Southeast Asian Gallery,5.0,,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for it's showcase of South east asian artwork-- First and finest of it's kind in South east asia.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,"Plenty of things to see and the building itself is so iconic. Highly recommend everyone to go there and take a look and if can, be a National Gallery Insider."
,,First visit to the newly opened National Gallery,4.0,,"It was a great day to meet friends and family to visit the new National Gallery.
My brother-in-law had stories to share with us to tell us what the different area were before the change and where he use to go for supreme court in the past.
Very nicely done..Our friends from the united states who have been in Singapore for 1 year were truly thankful for the 3D playground where their 2 year old twins truly enjoyed running around with my 6 year old and 10 year old niece who were so ready to look after the twins while their parents had time to catch up.
Excellent visit and definately need to return. The only sad part was the steep cost for foreigners like my husband of $20 entry, eventhough he is a resident married to a Singaporean. All residents in Singapore no matter what pass they are holding should be able to enjoy a discount for entry.
We will be back to checkout more of the National Gallery and especially Violet Oon's restaurant which was closed due to CNY today."
,,A Supreme Court turned Art Gallery,4.0,,"The former Supreme Court has been renovated and turned into the National Gallery. It is spacious and houses various artworks from Southeast Asia, tracing the developments in global and regional art. There are many galleries within the 2 buildings and one can not only appreciate the artworks, but also the architecture of the 2 buildings that make up the National Gallery. There is also a Children's Education Centre suitable for children under the age of 10 to explore and play in. Located in the heart of the city beside the famous St Andrew's Cathedral, you can enjoy a view of the city at the rooftop terrace of the gallery, or even sit down to enjoy a sumptuous meal in 1 of the restaurants there. It is also a short walk from City Hall station of the North-South Line."
,,Expensive Gallery,5.0,,"My friend and I went to visit this gallery. My friend who was visiting from Scotland was very shocked at how expensive it was to get in. She is used to gallery's being free in the UK.

It was $20 to get in.

My friend didn't want to pay that so we didn't go in."
,,Impressed by the New and Old,5.0,,From an architectonical point of view impressive place with an interesting art collection and some good combinations of old and new.
,,"If you go to galleries for the art, don't waste your money",1.0,,"£10 entry fee each (for foreigners!) isn't reflected by the quality and quantity of art you get to see. Sure, the building is impressive but it's a complicated /confusing layout, several floors don't seem to have much art at all (just a bit of courtroom furniture) and you do a lot more wandering along bare corridors than actually looking at art. Very disappointing."
,,Great place to see SE Asian Art,5.0,,I was amazed with the depth and breadth of collection. I visited this place during a 8 hour transit in Singapore and I only had 2 hours to explore this but it provided ample opportunity to enjoy it. Amazing architecture.
,,New & intersting buildings but Confusing layout,3.0,,"The art collection is fine but most of it is not impressive, the buildings are probably more interesting to most. However the 2 ""conjoined"" buildings are not well laid out. And also not well marked. Some galleries seem almost inaccessible.
Best part is the roof terrace of fine dining and drinking places as you can go there and enjoy the splendid and less common views. Access is free except to galleries for non-Singaporeans.
The Gallery Gift Shop is the worse I've ever seen. They should take cues from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Gift Shop at San Francisco International Airport, if it is still there."
,,Its restoration is truly a masterpiece,5.0,,"Singapore National Gallery, it is the state-of-the-art home to the world's largest public collection of modern art from South East Asia. Its area of 64,000-sq-m (689,000-sq-ft) Reflex Singapore’s unique heritage and geographical location, the attraction has taken a decade to come to fruition and cost about $500m. National Gallery Singapore is a new visual arts institution which oversees the largest public collection of modern art in Singapore and Southeast Asia. The Gallery is housed in two national monuments former Supreme Court and City Hall that have been beautifully restored and transformed into this exciting venue in the heart of the Civic District. Its restoration is truly a masterpiece, stunning makeover, has the makings of a contemporary architectural classic. Highly recommend a visit."
,,"Highly rate - if you love art, must visit",5.0,,"With the opening of the National Gallery, Singapore is truly a destination for all, and especially art lovers. We cannot praise more highly the magnificent job Singapore has done in presenting and preserving SEA art for all to see in a truly beautiful setting. From the way in which two iconic structures have been combined to create one, to the very detailed stories behind selected pieces of art -- there has been thoughtfulness and care given. Our only suggestion -- better signage please in order to truly enjoy the effort made. Highly rate this attraction."
,,Amazing architecture!,5.0,,"A step into the past with tasteful buildings, the gallery is of historical significance with a myriad of exhibits. It would take at least half a day for a visit."
,,Something for everyone!,5.0,,"City Hall MRT station. Exit towards Andrew Road.
Take the covered walkway, leads directly to the entrance of the Gallery

I've lived away from Singapore for over 5 years but make frequent trips home. This was definitely a highlight for me as the Gallery had just opened then.

Proud, in awe of the place and exhibits featured. Something for everyone as it caters to (a) the architecture buff with its beautiful restorations/interior (b) arts enthusiast with its extensive collection (c) photography/Instagram ""addicts"" as there are lots of great angles/areas to take pictures, and (d) families with kids - visit the Keppel Centre for Art Education, pop by the ""studios"" and workshops where kids can sit down and get creative with art.

Ask the Concierge about the guided tours, volunteers will take you on a walk around the two buildings and narrate its history. Did you know there's actually a prisoncell located in the basement of the Supreme Court Wing? Makes for a great history lesson and fab photo op!

My favourite exhibit was the Wu Guan Zhong gallery. I thought placing his works beside Chua Ek Kay was a smart choice as you could see the difference in their brush strokes (to me, literally a contrast to each other) even though there were so many similarities between them. Love!

Suffice to say, I absolutely adore this place. Whether you're a tourist, local Singaporean or semi-absentee Singaporean like me, this place has something for everyone!

Do plan to stay at least half a day as the place is pretty massive. We stayed the entire day btw :)

Drop by - it simply is gorgeous!!

Visitor with a guest
10 December 2015"
,,A couples of hours well spent,4.0,,The gallery has an interesting array of exhibits and the buildings themselves are great. The staff we encountered were friendly and helpful giving additional insights about the exhibits or directing you to the next attraction. I also enjoyed the views of the city from the terrace.
,,Beautifully restored historical building,4.0,,"The buildings are lovingly restored and look better than they did when it was in use! Great views can be found from the different vantage points of the building. Go to the roof garden and walk to the side facing the big green field (Padang). From there you can see colonial buildings as well as the iconic Marina Bay Sands in the background, and the skyscrapers in the business district.

The art is not all to my taste, but I did find some that appealed to me and spent an extra 1-2 hours viewing the art in addition to the architecture and internal rooms."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,Entry fee is waived for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents. Bring your identity card. Free guided tours are provided. Interesting visit!
,,Singapore's Louvre,5.0,,"Although it can't match the size and magnificent grandeur of the Louvre in Paris (France), this is where I must say it is something a Singaporean, like me, is very proud of. If I were to add up all the art & museum spaces around Singapore, we do have a size that could match the Louvre. As for the art, it is rightly asian centric. For European art, go to the Louvre. This place is where many pieces of important art and sculptures from asian artist are kept. The building that was renovated for this place is an art by itself. City Hall is a historical landmark. And if you venture up to the roof patio, many may not know it, the Singapore flag pole marks the survey datum point from which the whole of Singapore is measured against.

This is only free to citizens, there is a minimal charge for others. Check out the guided tours, the guides are knowledgeable and it would deepen your visit with their commentary."
,,Good not great,3.0,,"An interesting way to while away a few hours. Signage poor throughout building. Some exhibition rooms far better than others. Cafe at bottom of complex - great bakery and almost passable coffee very friendly - but then you have to carry your food through a corridor to a seating area - which was funky, but tables covered in used food trays and leftovers with an overworked janitor trying her best. Tip: move the cafe or the tables. It was just silly.

Art shop was ok, but curated to an inch of its life and nothing to buy.

The real highlight - top floor open air garden and water features. Great views of the city!

Taxi the easiest to get here."
,,Visit for the architecture even if you're not interested in art,5.0,,"The National Gallery occupies the former City Hall and former Supreme Court, which were previously out of bounds to most people and are now fully open to the public. The colonial architecture itself and the wonderful views of the city from the Padang Deck (on the top floor) are already worth the visit. The National Gallery is a nice place to go on a hot and humid day, or on a rainy day.

Beside the architecture and the views, the art works are also fascinating, as they reflect the diversity of cultures in Southeast Asia and the influences of European and Asian styles on Singaporean and Southeast Asian artists."
,,An art gallery with something for almost everyone,5.0,,"What a fantastic project. The architecture of the buildings and the link spans is wonderful. The gallery itself is spacious and the guards were knowledgable about the exhibits. You can't fail to be impressed by this place. We bought tickets on line, which surprised the people in the security desk.
Also of use to us was that they accepted foreign ID for the senior's discount."
,,A must see in Singapore,5.0,,"We managed to see the gallery the week it opened to visitors.
The gallery is housed in the old Supreme court building and the adjoining old City Hall. The buildings have been restored to a fantastic standard and this gallery will be on the itinerary for all visitors to Singapore.
The exhibits are interesting and cover historic images of Singapore and the region.
It is well worth spending a few hours there and do not forget to have a drink on the rooftop of the City Hall. The view across marina bay is fantastic.
Well done Singapore to preserve these historic buildings!"
,,Art for Art's sake,3.0,,"In Singapore Art Galleries are used to punish young people. Indeed, it is a western obsession, death-by-Museum-boring, but in Singapore it gathers new depths by punishing the tourists by overcharging the entry fee; and obviously letting the beleaguered local school kids in free, thus rubbing the gwai-lo's nose in it.
Thanks guys.I feel special.
Furthermore, the exhibits are somewhat inaccurately described (especially in the war related section) and under represented.for what was one of the epicenters (and most fascinating) geographical locations of the second war. It has been toned down, no doubt to soften the offence for the Japanese tourists, which is a shame. I use the word carefully.
The only decent part was the visiting exhibition from the British Museum. The rest of the place is deathly boring. Architecturally, it is cool-ish, and it could be dressed up a treat as the bones of the place are wondrous. The retail section is overpriced and has rather a dull selection and staff who glare. Technology is low-tech, and the overall curation within the Museum is either absent or performed by someone who is neither brave nor bold.
This could be so much more-so much. Random musical performances. Acrobats. Food break-out areas. Good coffee. Tea Tarik. Buns. Soldiers in period uniforms. Tech, tech, and more tech. WIFI. Monetise it! Sell me!
This could be the most exciting place to visit in Singapore, but it is mostly boring, and the staff seem to be strangely terrified...what's that about? I have been in museums and galleries all over the world-Berlin, Prague, Melbourne, San Francisco, NYC, even Barbados. This has been the least performing I have seen attraction save for maybe the fabulous people's Tractor Museum in Prague; but even this had more pull. More pull-get it ? Nyet?"
,,Interesting Cultural Experience in Singapore,4.0,,"We spent a relaxed few hours touring the recently re-opened National Gallery on a Sunday afternoon. The building itself is in a great central spot and is a true example of magnificent colonial architecture. It is a large place over a number of floors and they have used the plentiful space very well. There were a lot of other visitors, but it never felt crowded. There is a very nice interactive area for children to create some of their own art, which our 7 & 4 year old girls enjoyed. On the roof there are a couple of nice relaxed bars/restaurants with limited menus, but amazing views across to the Marina Bay area.... well worth a visit, even if you don't want to see the artwork."
,,Rare vast space in Singapore,5.0,,One of the newer attractions houses some of the best local and South East Asian art. I love the vastness of the place that allows us to really appreciate the art work and also appreciate the colonial architecture of a piece of singapore history. The space alone has many photo opportunities and is good for wondering. The exhibitions are beautiful and nicely curated.
,,Latest and Greatest,4.0,,"This is the latest and greatest art gallery in Singapore. Worth a visit even just to see the building itself. Art exhibitions cater to different types, from children to casual browsers to true blue artistic types. Nice visit!"
,,Shouldn't be missed,5.0,,Amazing collection of art. I've already gone twice and of course spent more time looking at pieces I liked from the first time I went.
,,Impressive facade.,4.0,,"- the newest addition to the Civic Disrrict, occupying both the imposing Supreme Court and City Hall buildings.
- a rich repository of local and Southeast Asian art
- guided tours available
- host to international art events
- family-friendly, accessible to the disabled
- food and drink here can be quite pricey"
,,Do not miss this when in Singapore.,4.0,,"This is a must see in Singapore, from the works of art, to the historical commentary to the building its a great visit. You do not need to into the arts to appreciate this visit to the National Gallery it has something for everyone, from the holding cells to the old courthouses to the roof top galleries and places to eat. And of course don't forget the art. Have a visit."
,,"A magnificent building, with lots of empty space",4.0,,"The exhibitions are very interesting, but the price is a bit excesive for the works presented. Don't get me wrong, I just think that the buildings and restaurants are top choices, but some galeries are empty or closed, and the kids activities are rather simple. The fine work by Wu Guanzhong and the DBS gallery were top material. We ate at the Aura restaurant, which has a very fine cuisine (and expensive). Be sure to get a map to assure you visit everything available."
,,Do not have the art sense...,2.0,,"I am not an artist and may lack of the sense to appreciate many of the art work in the national gallery. You are quite often to see artwork like a bag of flip flops, few light bulbs, a piece of unpolished wood, etc. I am sorry to say that I do not enjoy most of them. The architecture is decent, though."
,,a visit for locals and tourists,4.0,,"you can enter either via Coleman Street Entrance or St. Andrew's Road Padang entrance. we started with the Coleman Street side. there are 6 floors altogether on this side. the art works are very nicely displayed and the collection is great. we particularly enjoyed Chua Mia Tee's pieces.
there is a connecting link to the St. Andrew's Road Padang entrance. here, be wowed by the Supreme Court architecture. be sure to admire the Supreme Court foyer, Main Dome, Rotunda Dome. there are 5 floors over at this side.
there is somethings for the kids too, at the Keppel Centre."
,,Impressive exhibits in splendour environment,5.0,,"We spent more than an hour at level 2 exhibit hall, exhibits are nice and ambience was good. Staff were able to manage the weekend crowd too.. would be back again for the exhibits on other levels. Ideal for families as there is an area for kids interaction. A few restaurants in the same building which make the whole gallery an superb choice for gathering with family or friends."
,,Definitely a must visit,5.0,,A lot of people have been waiting SO long for its opening. They did an excellent job to design and repair the building and also for displaying artworks collection. Prepare at least 3-4 hours here if you are art lovers. Or just go to the top floor at Smoke and Mirror bar to enjoy marvelous view of Marina Bay. Good place to fill your camera memory card.
,,Nice experience,3.0,,"Upon new opening, the gallery staff still managed the crowd well. It was not overcrowded and there were staffs everywhere to assist in anything. A very wide range of art pieces are available. Although I do not know art, i enjoyed in the national gallery."
,,Great transformation of an old historical building,3.0,,"Have seen the building behind construction hoardings for years and am glad to finally have had a chance to see the inside. And oh what a great transformation. The building is gorgeous. I love all the glass and light flowing into the interiors. Beautiful!!

I'm not an art expert but I didn't find the collection very appealing. All that modern art and installation is just not very exciting to me. Personal taste of course. Having seen the collections at the Lourve, Picasso museum, Vatican Museum, etc, it's hard to feel excited with what's inside the National gallery. Again, just my personal taste. And maybe not a fair comparison. I'm sure others might enjoy the collection.

I think the architecture, transformation of old for new uses and the view (oh the view!!) is enough to warrant many repeated visits. If nothing else, just to sit in quiet contemplation. And the restaurants look enticing too. So beautifully decorated. I hear it is fully booked for months. One day..."
,,The kids gallery is amazing. A beautiful building!,5.0,,"We visited during the peak holiday season and were surprised at how well laid out the National Gallery is - we didn't feel crowded whatsoever. A treat for Singaporeans and PRs (admission is free), expats should know that kids 6 and under have free entry. The childrens' gallery will keep them busy for hours, and when it's time to take a rest, head to the rooftop garden so the kids can play and the adults can enjoy a drink overlooking the Padang."
,,"Enjoyed, though I do not know art",4.0,,"The building was beautifully restored. Enjoyed the visit checking out the various halls and exhibitions even when I do not understand much about arts. So much to see, will need another visit."
,,Nice place for arts lover,5.0,,"The gallery is very big and seems like got 2 buildings. If you want to see all, you might have to take more than 4 hrs. The view on top also nice!"
,,Soft opening,3.0,,"Not quite ready as there are many empty halls. We will visit again in future when there are more exhibits. Must say the whole place is beautifully restored, and many good eateries within the building."
,,Great Architectural Restoration,5.0,,"Went there with my family, very proud to see that Singapore took efforts in preserving the 2 heritage buildings with great historical value. It's very interesting to see how new additions have been included to complement the existing structures, and how the space within is converted into exhibition galleries, spacious lobbies and niche restaurants.

The only complain I have about the place is the incompetent staff at the ticketing counter: we brought our helper along with us, and the ticketing staff insisted that we pay $20 for her to enter, while the rest of us enter for free. She then went on to say, ""Maybe you want to reconsider visiting the galleries"". What was she trying to hint at? That I cannot afford $20? I was offended by that, but didn't pursue the matter, until she went on to serve another guest who wasn't at all in the queue. Still, I merely made sure she completed my transaction before serving someone else, and didn't give her what she deserved, as I have my children with me. Also, I didn't feel that her education was my responsibility."
,,Spectacular!,5.0,,"I had been looking forward to visiting this museum for months and it exceeded every expectation. The collection, which is not fully up yet, is simply amazing. The more modern southeast Asian collection did not do much for me but that's my own personal taste. All the rest, however, REALLY REALLY great. The buildings which house the museum are also a destination in their own right. If you only have time for one museum in Singapore, make sure it's this one!"
,,Stunning work of art!,5.0,,"The building itself is a work of art and its worth exploring for that and fantastic views from the garden roof. The art exhibits will disappoint if you compare it to European Art but on its own terms, its interesting to see how art in Southeast Asia has evolved."
,,Very good renovation to the old colonial building,4.0,,"The renovation was done perfectly; a blending between modern building feature as the interior, while preserving the its original look at the outside.

The gallery show of the old painting collection are a good start (not all are ready in December 2015), hopefully can be a better show."
,,Moderm Asiatic Art,5.0,,It was a sorprising collection of paintings of local artists. It is worthing to spend at least one hour visiting this museum if you are an art lover. The visit ends with a beautiful roof garden.
,,Must visit to learn more about SEA art,3.0,,"I had visited the Supreme Courts when I was a reporter, and wanted to check out the revamped building.

The National Gallery now occupies the former Courts, as well as City Hall, the previous seat of the civil service and government. You should set aside around 2-3 hours just to tske a look at the building, as well as a further two hours to see the paintings.

There are several galleries, featuring artists from Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, among others. I especially liked the paintings by R Saleh, an Indonesian painter from the 1800s.

Do also check out the various restaurants and eateries, including Yan on the Ng Teng Fong roof, as well as Violet Oon's restaurant on level 2. Do note that reservations there are a must - we wanted to dine at 1150 am and were told we had to wait till 145 pm as they were fully booked!

There are also a couple of small cafes on the ground level, where you can order a tandoori or teriyaki chicken sandwich for around $$10.

There are tours, but you can also download the app that will provide some background as well as three suggested tours. It is free for Singaporeans and PRs - just go online and book the tickets."
,,If you like arts,3.0,,"If you are an art person, I am sure you will like the place. I like the building itself but cannot really appreciate the arts display in the gallery. reason due to I cannot understand the arts at all without any description. There are only may be less than 20% of the arts with some description. There is title for most pieces but that doesn't explain much so some creation is meaningless for me.

The building itself is really grand, the place is clean and huge, great that it is free entry for all Singaporean & PR"
,,Beautiful building but limited collection (opened ecently),5.0,,"My wife and I visited this place in early December during promotion period for free. We went there in the evening and enjoyed the place a lot. The building itself is just amazing with huge atrium area at the main entrance, huge ceilings throughout and beautiful open space area at the top floor. There are 5-6 restaurants (French, Italian, Asian, etc.) so don't worry for food (although the service is slow as we were told by guides). At the top floor you can enjoy a nice views over the city. With regards to the collection of art nearly half of the rooms were still closed. Some of the rooms were dedicated to Chinese modern painters and worth visiting to familiarise. Overall we enjoyed a lot with our stay, architecture wise this is one of the most terrific galleries I have been to and hopefully their art collection won't disappoint you."
,,A place to know about the history and art,5.0,,"A historical building and iconic building that represent Singapore. From 1945 Japanese occupation surrender to today's world class art gallery, this buiding have seen a lot more than living people! A place for everyone to have a feel of waz inside the building as there are not many change to the chambers and rooms that were once a place for justice to take place. If u do not know anout art, fear not, just enjoy walking the building, a historical building of Singapore. Do take ur time to go to the rooftop for fresh air !"
,,Amazing collection of art in a fabulous setting,5.0,,"We only had an hour to visit this amazing museum which one could easily spend hours in, but what we saw was amazing, and I would recommend that everyone visit this gallery, regardless of how much time they have available. The building is a piece of art, itself. It was the old Supreme Court building, and the designers kept a lot of the architecture and furniture, which was incorporated into the gallery. The art was so amazing. It specializes in Asian art, and we saw gorgeous pieces from Chinese, Singapore, Malay, Vietnamese, Philippine artists, and more. We were accustomed to seeing Western artists like Gaugin, Van Gogh, Monet, etc., so it was really thrilling to see similar styles (impressionism, watercolors, modern, etc.) from different artists. Another special treat was the view from the top deck. A taxi driver told us that Singapore's culture was its buildings, and the view from the National Gallery showcased many of them, including the Marina Bay Sands hotel, British style churches, modern, traditional, tall and short buildings. You will not regret going to this gallery."
,,"Great building, not much to see",3.0,,"There are two positives; a wonderful restoration of the old Court building, retaining it's original features within a modern gallery format. The other is some good restaurants and bars, not surprising, this is Singapore.
The problem is there isn't much in the gallery and what's there isn't exactly awe inspiring. Furthermore any description is minimal and often hard to read. Go to admire the building and the views from the 6th floor but don't expect too much from the art."
,,5 Stars for the Building and only 2 stars for the exhibits... Poor flow and poor taste in quite a few of the collections,3.0,,"This is my first visit but it wouldn't be the last. The restored City Hall and Supreme Court buildings are themselves works of Art. They are absolutely beautiful.

The Buildings definitely overshadowed the works they displayed. I would have liked to see better quality exhibits and better flow of exhibits. As it is, the entrances to the exhibits are not intuitive and it is confusing to see the doors nearest to the escalators and lifts all locked. Please, if you want visitors to enjoy the works, the least you can do is to think through how your visitors will be walking through the exhibits... I felt like a mouse lost in a maze without proper directional signs (stickers on the floor could help) and bumping into locked doors at every turn.

There were more exhibits that I didn't like than those that I liked. The curators ought to be fired. The collections were choppy and quite a few of the exhibits were poor quality and poor taste. As a visitor walking around, it is confusing with no natural flow of theme. There were doors closed / locked everywhere.

In layman terms, beautiful buildings, very few good pieces, a lot of ugly ones and I'm not referring to controversial themes, I mean ugly pieces of art."
,,Beautifully Restored,5.0,,"The National Gallery is a beautifully restored building comprising the old Supreme Court and City Hall Buildings. Historic parts such as the Chief Justice desk, the court docks, holding cells for criminals awaiting trial and the room where the Japanese surredered to the British are open to the public for viewing - this is in addition to the wide collection of Asian art pieces. It has the potential to become a renown regional gallery. On the top floor which leads to an open like verandah, you get a panoramic view of the historic Padang, the Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer, the sea, the clutter of hotel buildings and the sky-rise buidlings along Shenton Way, a treat for photographers. While entrance fee is free for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, the $20 fee for foreigners is a little steep for a fledging gallery that has only a nice interior to interest foreigners for the time being. Considering that foreign visitors usually come in pairs or with families to Singapore for sighseeing, a family ticket with a much reduced price for foreigners would be a nice gesture of welcoming foreigners to this new attraction in Singapore."
,,Don't miss,5.0,,"Located in old City Hall and Supreme Court, showcase of SE Asian art for 19th century onwards, well laid out for a pleasant 2 hours. Various restaurants (some not yet open) the best is the Salad Bar on the top floor with a very good range buffet for $18, sweeping views of Padang and Marina Bay. For budget options try foodcourt in adjacent buildings. Enjoy the art, architecture, lending in of court layout and furniture into the exhibits."
,,Outstanding architecture and activities too!,4.0,,We visited with our 10 year old son with an expectation of leaving in couple of hours. But we found ourselves to be there from 1 to 5 pm. There are many things for not only children but also us adults who are still a child at heart and would like to try their hand at creating a small piece of art. The place also has some wonderful paintings with some great stories. It's worth going here to get a taste of Far East art. Also nice building where it is located. Happy we decided to go there.
,,Beautiful Gallery,5.0,,"You don't have to be an art connoisseur or a culture expert to appreciate Singapore's increasingly vibrant art scene. A visit to the museum is great for escaping Singapore's sweltering outdoor heat, and for you to learn more about art. If that is not enticing enough, what about free admission? As an initiative under the National Heritage Board, Singaporeans and PRs enjoy FOC perks when they visit NHB museums and heritage institutions.

National Gallery Singapore is a new addition to the scene. It has the largest public collection of modern art in Singapore and Southeast Asia. Architecture lovers would also rejoice at the stunning design of the buildings, for the Gallery is housed in two national monuments, the former Supreme Court and City Hall.

It's a short 5 minute walk away from City Hall MRT (take Exit B, walk along St Andrew's Cathedral and follow the Art Connector).

Friendly museum staff will direct you to the ticketing counter. Just present your NRIC or student pass for your free tickets. Tours are also available for visitors.

The first gallery that we visited was the UOB Southeast Asia Gallery, showcasing one of the museum's permanent exhibitions, Between Declarations and Dreams: Art of Southeast Asia since the 19th Century.With avant-garde art experiments taking place across Southeast Asia, art was redefined. Instead of sophisticated paintings and sculptures, ordinary materials were used to create artworks so that the public could understand them easily. Political opinions were also expressed through the various art forms.

There were two special exhibitions when we visited, by artists Wu Guan Zhong and Chua Ek Kay.

Wu Guan Zhong: Beauty Beyond Form
A born-and-bred Chinese artist who studied in Paris, Wu Guan Zhong lived through the Cultural Revolution and he was a forerunner in advocating for the fusion of Western and Eastern influences in his art.

""The demand to integrate the Chinese and the Western, originates from certain emotional affinities, in the same way it is natural that a male and a female have magnetising powers for each other... It is the mission of intellectuals to overthrow cliched opinions, and it is the lifetime endeavour of artists to establish new artistic perceptions and aesthetic conceptions."" - Wu Guan Zhong

Chua Ek Kay: After the Rain
Chua Ek Kay was one of Singapore's leading ink painters, and water is a recurring theme in his paintings.

As you exit the museum, you'll pass by Gallery & Co., the retail space for National Gallery Singapore, where you can take home museum collectibles and prints."
,,Architectural feat. Good children area.,5.0,,"So this use to be the Supreme Court but after years of renovation they have managed to combine like two buildings with a lot of glass. When we enter the building m, The theme is like a tree so there is a superstructure and then what seems like leaves flowing down. They have kept several of the old areas so it's still possible to see the old holding cells, the place where trials were held and the old Chief Justice office. On top the roof top is glass with a reflecting pond so there is a shimmering effect with the room below. So facets of the old building have been preserved but also made nicer eg the court room was definitely made more impressive with the deep red paint and the lighting effect. Well worth it just to tour the building
The children's area which was named after the corporate sponsor Keppel was great fun for the kids and we have been back twice already. The first few rooms are the usual play rooms where the kids have loads of material to do handicraft. Some of it is Drawing, collage and building models. But there is this also wonderful land of make-believe where they have the entire room is painted into a garden with various characters from children story books. Here the children are free to be left in their make belief world of fairy tales. Truly wonderful. There is also another room which has digital media so the children can choose various animals, Colour then and then they come alive in the digital screen in front. These pictures can also be emailed back. It was such great fun for the kids .
Lastly the staff and volunteers have been great. Everyone has been so friendly, giving directions Etc and being very approachable. Truly added to the experience as well."
,,Singapore History told in Fine Arts,4.0,,"Location: in the city. Take the MRT and alight at City Hall station. Exit and head towards the blue dome in front of the Padang.
Tickets: free for Singaporeans & PR. Foreigners have to pay SGD$20. Tickets can be bought at B1. Singaporeans need to show NRIC to exchange for a free ticket at the same location.
Things to do: start at level 2 where the main exhibits are. This level shows Singapore history through Art pieces. You can also see the history of Singapore's Supreme Court at the connecting building which holds the former Supreme Court of Singapore. Work was still in process at Level 3 when I went in early December 2015. There were 2 local artists work on display at level 4 at the special gallery. Level 5!at the Supreme Court side holds modern Art. Interesting Section. There are cafes n restaurants available for tea n meals.
No flash photography is allowed.

Wish there were more Art pieces relating to the local culture scene like Peranakan Art work."
,,Latest Art Icon,4.0,,"Singapore's latest addition to the art scene- two national monuments restored, integrated and adapted as a major space to house permanent and special exhibitions of modern art! A must see for the buildings' history and architecture as the former Supreme Court and City Hall and their use as an art gallery within. Some special features of the buildings like the court rooms, former Surrender Chamber and the Corinthian columns, domes, prisoner docks, prison holding cells and architectural elements are kept while new elements like link bridges introduced to ensure the functionality of the spaces. The art collections are impressive and the current special exhibition worth mention."
,,It was a fun visit and we didn't have to pay anything!,4.0,,"The Nighscape show was fantastic, and the show is free. There are other things to explore in the Gallery, and there are activities for kids, too. children's paintings adorn the walls. There is also an exhibit about the history of SG which is quite informative."
,,Impressive Setting to look out for!,4.0,,"National Gallery, Singapore
A gallery with world class infrastructure and enormous room for further growth, currently displaying the art of South East Asia and Singapore since the 19th century. It also has two major collections of the artists Wu Guanzhong and Chua Ek Kay. The beauty of Chinese ink paintings came through in these modern art works, even influencing the oil paintings and mixed media.
The gallery is housed in the old Supreme court building and city hall, and has sections where you can see the grandeur of the court. Retaining the heritage structure and adding modern touches like the glass doors and partitions, the escalators and elevators, and all the amenities of any large museum in the world, the National Gallery is definitely worth keeping a watch for the future.
We enjoyed a relaxed morning and were impressed."
,,No words are enough to describe this National Gallery Singapore,5.0,,"We went there on Dec 4, 2015. That was still within the opening celebration for the NG Singapore! And yes! We got free tickets!

The architectural marvel that was achieved to be the home of the best of the best in Southeast Asian art-- is truly fantastic! It went farther than the eye can reach, and higher than was imaginable. The art pieces are well curated. There was a natural flow with a good narrative provided.

Congratulations, National Gallery Singapore! I'd like to go back again when I have another chance."
,,"Old Supreme Court, a historical grandeur! And now a repository of Asian Art.",5.0,,"If you have lots of time, this place is the place to be, not only because of the myriad of art presented but also by the history of the building. One has to navigate through the building, using a map, and even then you will get lost. I did. But that is the exciting thing about being in this place. You can get lost in the art and in the historicity of the building. Just imagine yourself having lived in this place, and you will be transported in the birth and growth of beautiful, prosperous Singapore. And if you will peckish, there are a few coffee shops to cater for your hunger. Enjoy the art, the building, and the coffee. This place is a historical grandeur! And now a repository of Asian Art."
,,Where are the paintings ?,3.0,,"This is a great newly restored building and potentially a great gallery but when we visited there were mainly empty rooms . The restaurants were up and running, though!
I'd wait for an exhibition to visit and save your museum hopping for the more inertesting Peranakan or National Museums"
,,National Gallery,5.0,,"Impressive buildings which were the restored Supreme Court and City Hall. We went during the opening and there were outdoor carnival just across the streets with food, drinks and games station A must- see for tourists & local. Entrance is free for locals."
,,Everything old is new again!,5.0,,"For years since the City Hall and Supreme Court buildings were closed I have been waiting for the day they were reopened, and a visit in early December was my reward. What an amazing job the city fathers have done with those beautiful landmarks. They have taken those imposing buildings and transformed them into incredible urban spaces with such a wonderful purpose. The money has been well spent and I can see the gallery becoming the most popular tourist destination in Singapore. The restaurants need to get their acts together, though, as they were hardly functioning during my visit, although the couple I tried had friendly, attentive staff. The view from the top deck is wonderful because you see the grandeur of old Singapore in the Cricket Club with the backdrop of Marina Bay Sands. The view tells the story of Singapore in pictures.
That the government had the foresight to develop these imposing buildings and create a unified architectural marvel shows rare insight for Asia. Hong Kong destroyed every vestige of its history, Bangkok is an ugly urban sprawl and apart from The Bund and a few enclaves, Shanghai is a slum.
The way the two old buildings have been joined is also fascinating, because it looks completely natural and the atrium is an attraction in itself.
The signage needs a little refining so people know how to navigate the huge complex. I saw a couple of very lost tourists!"
,,Best attraction in Singapore so far,5.0,,"Did not have high expectations of gallery since most galleries in Singapore are small and some just boring. National gallery on the contrary has a good theme, showcasing modern SEA art and is huge with good collection. The food establishments are also good. Check out Smoke and Mirror for a good view. My suggestion is to sit indoors, Padang field actually spoilt the view.

In my opinion, this should be on top of the list to do for all tourists."
,,Really impressive,5.0,,"Finally Singapore has its own world-class gallery / museum right in the heart of the city. I was very impressed with the refurbishment of both the City Hall and Supreme Court components. There are extensive collections of regional art to view, and still more empty space which has not yet been filled. The old courtrooms and holding cells in the Supreme Court are also quite interesting to see. Quite a few entertaining activities for children also. Well worth taking the time to visit properly."
,,Beautiful buildings,4.0,,"We visited shortly after its opening when entry was still free for tourists. This was probably because most of the exhibits had yet to open. Nonetheless, the buildings of the old supreme court and city hall are beautiful and exhibited to quite well. I was surprised it wasn't more crowded. The works that were on display seemed accessible to the non-arty."
,,A New Attraction in Singapore,4.0,,"Used to be the buildings of High Court and City Hall, now combined as National Gallery Singapore, it is a good place for those who like to see architectures. It is a new place worthy to visit."
,,Modern Singapore Heritage,5.0,,"We had observed unveling of National Gallary on 24th November'15 which oversees modern art collection which is visual treat. Best part is to explore Self guided tour of four section using Gallary Explorer App.
Building looks awesome with its architecture with years of restoration work. It displays over 800 Art Work from colonial period to present......visual treat
Should not miss once in Singapore."
,,Wonderful show of South-East Asian art over the last 200 years,4.0,,"I took advantage of the free admission to the public that was going on when I was there. The gallery had just opened then. The building itself consists of the merging of the old Supreme Court and City Hall and seeing its architectural design probably rivals that of seeing the exhibits themselves.

As with a number of other museums, the trick is to not be befuddled with the layout of the museum as one goes from one exhibit room to another. Unfortunately, as a first-time visitor to this gallery, we were sometimes scratching our heads as to where to turn to go to next room. More glaring is that the escalators, although running alongside with the large stairs on the main floor, was somewhat hidden from view.

Overall, an enjoyable visie. Tip: make sure to go to the top of the building to catch the skyline at night."
,,Too much hype about it all.,3.0,,"It was an experience but a tiring one. Staff not as welcoming and service standards are well below par. Artworks are a personal affair. Did not enjoy the selection of contemporary and modern art. The Keppel Gallery for children was the best part of the whole place. Will I visit again? I don't think so, unless there is something really interesting to entice me back again. Not elderly friendly at all."
,,Newly opened National Gallery Singapore will be premier location for South East Asian Art,4.0,,"Kudos to the Singapore government for restoring the Old Supreme Court building and City Hall building, and combining the two historical buildings into the newly opened National Gallery Singapore.
Slated to be the premier gallery for South East Asian art, they opened their doors on 24 November 2015 and have seen a steady stream of visitors.
Singpaoreans and Premanent Residents have free entry to the gallery while other visitors have to pay a small entrance fees.
Firstly, I must say that the fully restorted old buildings are an art work itself. Their Victorian era architecture of huge columns, grand rooms, domes, teak wooden floors and marbled floors, are a delight from the usual carpet, steel and glass in modern buildings. Walking through the hallways, one can feel the essence of the powers that roamed these passageways in era long gone.
Secondly, the newly constructed connection between the old Supreme Court building and City Hall building is an achievement in itself. A modernised 'atap shingled roof, supported by a 'large tree trunk' provides and created a covered atirum. Also linking the two buildings are 2 bridges. Marvellous idea that was and it is a popular photographing spot at the edge of one of the domes.
My favorite spot was the roof top access. One can stand on the very top of the building and gaze upon the Padang field in front, the iconic Marina Bay Sands building, Singapore Flyer, and the business district skyline.
As this is a new gallery, allowance must be made. Already there are quite a lot of very lovely art works on display. I feel that over time, as more art work get acquired by the gallery, more people will get attracted to this gallery.
It is a great place to spend an entire afternoon wandering among the art work.
However, I must warn the next visitor, be prepared for large crowd of people on weekends as this gallery.
Access to the gallery is also easy as it is very near to City Hall MRT station and there are several bus stop nearby."
,,Feast on Architecture and Arts,5.0,,"I completed the tour of National Gallery over two visits and yes, it is huge!

Comprising of the City Hall Wing and Supreme Court Wing, its foremost an architectural treat just walking around the buildings. Delicately preserved and refurbished, visit the City Hall Chamber, Roof Garden, Supreme Court Foyer and the bridge linking the two buildings. Do look out for the prison cells and the time capsule spots when you are there.

City Hall Wing houses the special exhibitions namely Wu Guan Zhong and Chua Ek Kay currently and also Singapore collections at the DBS Singapore Gallery. The Singtel Special Gallery is not open for now. Look out for workshops and interactive digital social table and for families with kids, engaged them at the Keppel Centre for Art Education.

Supreme Court Wing houses the Southeast Asia collections and spend time looking at the Chief Justice's Chamber and Office, Rotunda and Foyer to enjoy the history and architecture of the building. The huge collection of arts can be very overwhelming though.

The roof top features a reflecting pool which directs natural sunlight into the podium which is a detail I really enjoyed. Nice view of the skyscrapers of the Singapore city can be captured here as well.

Artwork and Building tours are available, for more details do visit the website. Did not visit the F&B establishments though as I heard its almost always fully booked (on my weekday visit as well). I would presume it to be pricey as well.

Definitely worth a visit and to while a day away here. Will be anticipating for them to bring in more interesting exhibitions and how they may rotate the permanent collections to maintain novelty in time to come.

Easily accessible from City Hall Mrt by a covered walkway to the Coleman entrance. Do not miss the art connector while taking the walkway there as well."
,,An amazing transformation,5.0,,"The Former High Court and City Hall have converted into the National Gallery.

The buildings have been redone to their former glory and look absolutely fantastic.

The main hall linking both of them is so subtle yet so striking.

At the end, we didn't really look at the works of art within the museums but walked around the buildings.

The bar/ decking area (city hall side) is great in the evening as the vues of the city are beautiful.

'There are several bars and restaurants. Many of them open until 01:00

They need to improve signage within the building as it is a bit confusing walking around.

Highly recommended."
,,Stunning architecture overshadows the contents,4.0,,"Newly opened a couple of weeks ago, this is THE museum in Singapore, far overshadowing the National museum nearby . Years of restoration and millions of dollars spent on combining the old parliament and old Supreme Court buildings into one architectural marvel. The result is indeed stunning , with old and modern elements fused together . They even keep some of the old elements intact - Chief Justice office, Supreme Court Library, holding jail cells etc.

How about the art inside? Well, there is the Singapore gallery and the south east Asia gallery. They are then sub divided into smaller galleries. Directions are confusing and thus not easy to navigate. Because the art is so local and regional, there are no big global names. The art is kinda blah. The temporary galleries are empty for now

There are like 5-6 restaurants here, probably the most of any museum in the world

5 stars for the architecture, 3 stars for the art"
,,"Historic location, need better directions within",4.0,,"Newly opened, visitors get to explore the old Supreme Court as well as interesting exhibits, the structure of the building is gorgeous which itself is worth seeing. Directions within need to be clearer so there's a better flow when viewing, we had to ask for directions even though we had a map.

Tips: book tickets online before going, saves time as you won't need to queue. Definitely check out level 5 - open air gallery for a great view of the new Supreme Court and Singapore skyline"
,,"Perfect location, lovely architecture, specific South Asian art works, smart mobile app guide",5.0,,"The gallery is newly opened in Nov-2015. The location is just perfect and at the roof top you could have the best view of Marina Bay. The restored building is very lovely -- the designer added very modern elements (huge painting in the middle of marble columns, a ""tree"" grown in the hall supporting the roof, etc.) to the old Greek style building, and the modern and old elements just mixed perfectly that you could not see anywhere else.

The art works exhibited inside shown typical South Asian culture covering 1900's to date which is also very specific and impressive. I loved many pieces. And they have very good quality printed books with reasonable prices in their small shop, and the books introduce the major art works in the museum.

They have a perfect mobile App as well and the app can locate you while you are inside the museum, and show art works nearby automatically.. once you installed the app in your mobile phone, you'll have a self-service guide.

It is free until 6-Dec and after that the ticket price is 20S$ for foreigners (permanently free for Singaporean and PR)"
,,great art pieces in a architectural masterpiece,5.0,,"best museum in Singapore so far. Went there during the weekends, little crowded, but definitely worth it. Great place to go to for art lovers."
,,Confusing and difficult to navigate,3.0,,"The only thing I liked was the building itself, as many had already pointed in the reviews, it was not easy to navigate and it was difficult to read the description of the paintings."
,,Modern Visual Arts Museum Within Historic Buildings,4.0,,"The National Gallery Singapore opened in November 2015, and is home to the world’s largest public collection of Singapore art, and Southeast Asian art, with over 8,000 artworks spread over 7 galleries. The 64,000 square metre National Gallery Singapore is the largest modern visual arts museum in Singapore, and is housed within 2 restored national monuments, the former Supreme Court Building and former City Hall.

The beautifully restored architecture is as much an attraction of the National Gallery Singapore as the artwork it houses. Of particular note is the Padang Atrium, the awe inspiring main entrance that makes you feel like you're standing in the shade of a giant tree! Be sure to also check out the beautiful former City Hall Chamber with its marble columns, the elegant former Supreme Court Rotunda & Dome with its symmetry and lines, and the outdoor Ng Teng Fong Roof Garden Gallery with its Reflecting Pools, green walls, and spectacular views of the city and the bay. Also notable are the restored sections of the Holding Cells, Chief Justice's Office, Chief Justice's Chamber, and Courtroom One.

Of the 2 permanent exhibitions at the National Gallery Singapore, the DBS Singapore Gallery 1, 2, and 3, houses the Siapa Nama Kamu: Art In Singapore Since The 19th Century collection. Meaning ""What Is Your Name?"", the gallery weaves together a chronological history of Singapore art from the 19th century to the present day, and through its 400 artworks, invites visitors to consider how art may relate to both themselves and the community.

The other permanent exhibit at the National Gallery Singapore is the Between Declarations And Dreams: Art Of Southeast Asia Since The 19th Century, housed in the massive UOB Southeast Asia Gallery 1 - 15. Through the 4 main, interconnected themes of Authority And Anxiety, Imagining Country And Self, Manifesting The Nation, and Re:Defining Art, the exhibit traces the shared artistic impulse across the Southeast Asia region, and how artists sought to incorporate local expressions and aesthetic traditions, even as they grappled with modernity and change.

The National Gallery Singapore also has several rotating exhibits within the City Hall Foyer, Supreme Court Foyer, UOB City Hall Courtyard, Singapore Courtyard, the Concourse Gallery 1 & 2, the Level 4 Gallery, and Singtel Special Exhibition Gallery 1, 2, 3. During my visit, on display was Voyage Colour Challenge By Twardzik-Ching Chor Leng, the Wu Guanzhong Gallery: Beauty Beyond Form, and Chua Ek Kay: After The Rain. The Keppel Centre For Art Education here also specifically caters to children, with play areas and lessons on art.

However, the place also has its teething issues. The massive, sprawling floors are a confusing maze, and it's not easy to find your way around without a map (get it from the information counter). There doesn't seem to be a linear flow to the artwork, seemingly more random in nature when you wander around. The historical or cultural value of an artwork is not always immediately evident, and the descriptions of artworks are particularly small and tiny. Staff are quick to prevent people standing close to the pieces (you cannot cross the black line on the floor), this makes reading the tiny words quite difficult, leading to less appreciation of the pieces.

If you're planning a visit, do note that admission fees are Free for Singaporeans, but cost SGD $20 for Non-Singaporeans. Tickets should preferably be purchased online through SISTIC before arrival at the National Gallery Singapore, as admission timing is in blocks of 4 hours (10am, 12pm, 4pm). This is to prevent crowding within the museum, as well as to maximise their visitor's enjoyment. However, once you've entered the National Gallery Singapore, you've free to remain inside as long as you want, but do allocate between 2 - 5 hours of viewing time. There are cafes, and free water coolers within the museum, but do wear a good pair of walking shoes. Photography is allowed, but only without using the flash."
,,Terrific examples of SEAsian Art Scene,5.0,,"Still free until 6 December, this is a real treasure trove for art lovers. I had no idea there is such talent in this part of the world. Clearly, European influences come through the various artists portrayed, but their use of colour contrasts were bold and attractive. The conversion of the building is imaginative, my only complaint is that it is too big!"
,,Utter chaos,3.0,,"First impressions were good - 2 national monuments renovated and combined tastefully into the new gallery. Architecturally, a masterpiece. Thereafter it was downhill, with a distinct lack of signage for such a sprawling display. For a well-organised society like Singapore, the displays lacked structure and for someone uninitiated in South-east Asian art, I was left confused. To appreciate art covering the 1800s to 1990s, I needed contextualisation of the exhibits. Instead, I ended up with visual overload and eye-strain from trying to read text on the wall that was far too small. There were also some harsh 'Do not touch' signs and I witnessed a member of staff telling some young children off because they had crossed the line and were too close to the paintings! The Supreme Court wing is particularly confusing - I lost the will after going round in never-ending circles trying to find the upper link bridge and eventually found that the access is through a restricted area on level 4. Others were similarly confused and I dread to think of the chaos in the event of having to evacuate the building during an emergency. Having run out of steam, we retreated to the Smoke & Mirrors lounge to be greeted by a grumpy member of staff who reluctantly let us in. What a rip-off - 2 cups of coffee for 18 Singapore dollars! I also think it is discriminating to charge an entry fee for non-Singaporeans to visit the gallery."
,,Everyone will find their own favorite pieces!,4.0,,"There were lots of awesome mind-blowing art pieces, with distinctive Singaporean and Asian personality in them. Go with an ipad or iphone WITH EARPIECES, then u get free running commentary on its free app."
,,Deflated Expectations,3.0,,"Taking the opportunity for free admission after the official opening, we dutifully booked the free tickets online and queued at the opening time. After reading the many write-ups in the news, my expectations were hyped-up. As an art connoisseur, I eagerly looked forward to the opening of the National Gallery. I had expected it to be many times better than the quality of art exhibitions at the venerable Singapore Art Museum (SAM). I was sadly disappointed. My hyped-up expectations were duly deflated!! Yes, there were more extensive display of visual art pieces, given the vast wall spaces afforded by the august buildings. But somehow, the ""wow"" or surprise factor was missing. As a historical perspective and an overview of the local art scene over the decades, the exhibits have achieved its purpose. Where are the best works of the artists? There is no ""excitement"" element to enthrall and uplift my spirit and to satisfy my innate desire to savor the art exhibited! In common language, one word describes it all -""boring""! The better art pieces of some artists were not exhibited, pieces that reflect the immense talents of these artists. These had been exhibited at SAM before and I never tire revisiting the museum to view them multiple times to soak in every art stroke of the paintings! Overall, I enjoyed the exhibits at the DBS Gallery better than that exhibited at the other galleries. My best compliments are reserved for the beautiful restoration of the august buildings and the architecture and engineering prowess is an art in itself! For this alone, I will revisit the gallery to marvel at the architecture. My hope is that the exhibits be revived and re-curated to draw ""repeat customers""! I want to be able to say, ""yes! I must return to see my favorite artists and their display of talents on the canvas or in sculpture!"
,,"Good facility, easy going, masterpiece art design",4.0,,"It's easy going, outside city hall mrt station ,about 400m distance from mrt station to national gallery.
I pick my camera and online booking ticket. I spend about 3 hours in national gallery, and there's a lot of interesting place nearby.
If u have half day and weather is pretty nice(no raining please) maybe u can have a half day trip there."
,,"Huge, Impressive and a little confusing",4.0,,"Visited the Gallery over the opening weekend and it was packed. Thanks for the free entry for locals.
The galleries were beautiful and it would be a place that i would want to go back again when it is not so crowded.

Reasons why it is not a 5 Point rating is because directions in the gallery can be confusing and insufficient. Staff were not exactly helpful and many a times, just standing around. I have seen some patrons touching the art pieces and not much were said or done. I don't think they truly understand what was needed to be done.

Art pieces in the galleries were also confusing as i don't think they were well classified. With the huge variety, proper classification must be done or visitors will find it disjointed. There weren't enough information on the gallery maps and with such a huge place, it would be good if there was a recommended route that one can take to visit the whole place as well. Spent about 2 hours walking around and i felt lost and what i saw was kinda of random.

Choices of restaurants are available at the gallery, Hoping to visit again another day with more time to spare."
,,"Educational, requires time for better appreciation",4.0,,"The building facade and how two buildings were joined is amusing enough. It's interesting that even if all are paintings (well, it's a huge galler not a museum), it is well-curated and not boring. I think for vast collections like this, the best way to appreciate it is to cover a section at a time and revisit several times. The view from the roofdeck is amazing,, it's a must see!"
,,Newly open National Gallery Singapore,4.0,,"A good place to go. It used to be court building and now being transformed to a Gallery. Appreciate the revamp yet maintained the structure of old. Good landscaping on the 6th level. Good views of The Padang, Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer."
,,"Art overload, beautiful building",5.0,,"There is way too much to cover in a few hours. The place is big and there is so much to see. I walked for 2-1/2 hours and only covered about half the place.

The artworks are stunning. There is so much to see! Art Advocates are stationed at selected pieces to explain the background and the details of the pieces. The collection is extensive and a very good range of art from Singapore and the region.

The restored building is a sight to behold too. I have visited City Hall numerous times as a child, when my late grandmother worked in the building. I can't recognise the place anymore. The restoration work done is stunning, bringing out the beauty of the architecture and sprucing up the flooring. There has been so much attention paid to the smallest details. It is a sight to behold.

An absolute must-see!"
,,Aesthetic,4.0,,"We visited the newly opened National Gallery of Singapore yesterday, and we were greatly fascinated by all the master pieces incorporated. It was such a nice experience, as it was not a usual place for our family to visit."
,,A great place to explore,4.0,,The new kid on the block is a work of art itself. This is a stunning building inside and out and has a great collection of exhibits. Well worth an afternoon wander.
,,Why is this not called an Art Gallery?,3.0,,"Probably due to the nation's gallery is not fastidious in providing a clear strategic direction and its direction/ signage in the building.

Since it portrayed itself to be the : ""visual arts institution which oversees the largest public collection of modern art in Singapore and Southeast Asia"" then why it cannot reposition its name as National Art Gallery?

I observed that it aims to oversell its building as a former supreme court and it displays artefacts and information about the former supreme court too. It has a beautiful rooftop which made all the visitors going crazy with their cameras. I came to a question that am I doing an architecture tour or a building museum tour? Is this why Singapore choose to call it a National Gallery when it is clearly an Art Gallery?

While the art pieces are definitely impressive, it lacks a clear theme to it. It is purely an extravagant way of showing off that Singapore has finally open such a big gallery with so many collections, and now it is time to dump/plaster the walls with it rich collections! There is clearly No direction or theme in the displays at all. Examples of a large-array of themes which the gallery can choose for the beautiful spaces:

1) Prism (we have plenty of Asian artists who attempted using prism in their early artwork) , minimalism

2) Pop art, abstract art, or neo-pop just to quote a few more

3) Feminism

4) Flowers and plants (be it lilies or lotus , I believed that we should be able to enhance that theme) or Nature study(to put it even broadly)

The gallery tried using dates as the ""theme"", however it appeared as a weak theme to me, if dates are the focus , then all the signage should be properly labelled that which floor/level are display artwork of which times.

In short, messiness is the best conclusion I can give for this National Gallery!

I am sorry but I also noticed that Singapore Museums and galleries tend to focus on rotundas, yes we definitely know that we are previously under the British colony, however, that doesn't mean that we have to overly-emphasize on that

Secondly, when I first step into the building, I cannot find clear signage /directions as to how should I approach my visit.
I was told that this foyer is at the centre, that mezzanine is over there, the signage put up only told me where is the Altimate, Saha, Project Space, Supreme Court Terrace etc, but what are these (truly I totally cannot guess what are they for)? Are they crucial for visiting an Art gallery?
Knowing where or what is ""Coleman Deck"" or a ""Sri Mariammam"" Deck, is that so essential in elevating the standards of Arts in Singapore?
I would definitely appreciate that signage could be self-explanatory like :

Basement : Mini small-scale exhibitions

L5-3: UOB Gallery (bracket South East Asian)
L4: East Asian Gallery

L2: Local artists etc

The size of the lift is small and in certain exhibition hall/gallery, we have to get back to the entrance before we can go down to the next floor. The whole place is not well-planned. For example, the theatrette is spanned from 3rd to 5th floor, the security guard and officers ended up giving me wrong yet forceful directions/ They claimed that they worked here long enough to guide me, so to view the film for the opening ceremony, I have to enter by 5th floor(when it is clearly on the 3rd floor), ended up I missed a large part of the film as I was instructed to wait at the wrong entrance.

While it is new, get over the fuss of the hype and seriously there is nothing so tempting that u need to visit during its opening, let the National Gallery's management team go over its direction again before you step foot into this messy gallery."
,,"Excellent gallery, well worth a visit",5.0,,"The museums in Singapore are generally of excellent standards, and the National Gallery is no exception. The architecture is beautiful, art pieces excellent, and the guided tours very informative.

You will probably need an entire afternoon if you want to go through all the exhibits, so prepare good walking shoes."
,,Art masterpieces,4.0,,"I rushed out of my office during lunch break to have a glimpse of the Gallery on her very first day of opening to the public. It was amazing to see such a wide array of art masterpieces contributed by many of the renowned artists from our South East Asian neighboring countries.

The moment I walked into the first gallery at the 3rd level, the landscape paintings of 19th century pristine and natural Java captivated my heart. Impressive and beautiful!

Abstract modern art pieces at the other gallery turn on my wild imagination with the complicated designs and colorful strokes.

Architectural arts added another perspective of structural beauty. The symmetrically balanced stack up of bowls has beauty in proportionality like the Egyptian pyramid art.

I am not into art and many of the aesthetic ideas look foreign to me. Looking at all these great masterpieces, I realised I should allot some time in life to appreciate the inner beauty of things instead of rushing madly to pursue only materialistic goals.

This is a place to take our time to relax and enjoy the aesthetic pleasure of the beauty of arts. It is wrong to rush here for just a glimpse and an hour spent here is too short. I shall drop by again and the next time I come I shall take my leisure time to really appreciate these masterpieces.

The Gallery is located beside the new Supreme Court and 5 mins walk from City Hall MRT ststion. There are also the Asian Civilisation Museum, the Civil Defense Heritage Museum, the Philatelic Museum and the Peranakan Museum nearby and you can hit few birds at the same time. Most importantly, do not rush take your time to appreciate the beauty of arts."
,,So much to see and experience,5.0,,"There is just too much to see and experience at the two main galleries - DBS Singapore Gallery and UOB Southeast Asia Gallery. Be prepared to spend at least a day soaking up the creativity and beauty of the art and architecture here. Let the young ones explore, experience and engage themselves in the Arts at the Keppel Centre for Art Education. I'll be back to soak it all in again, today was just a short quick 2.5hrs visit on its first public opening day."
,,Beautiful Architecture with a wondering showcase of Singapore and Southeast Asian art,5.0,,"The Architecture is amazing, with a golden roof joining City Hall and the Former Supreme Court. If you have young children, they will enjoy the public spaces at Keppel Centre for Arts Education."
,,"Even in preview, the Singapore National Gallery is magnificent",5.0,,"One of the more exciting and anticipated openings in Singapore this year is the Singapore National Gallery. The gallery is housed in the former Supreme Court building and the City Hall next door. A mix of old Victorian architecture and new modern trimmings, it's a great place to spend the day. I love exploring buildings and I'm really pleased to have a sneak peek inside before it opens!

Taking a walk inside the Old Supreme Court Building where the National Gallery Singapore is set to open its doors. No art yet on display, but the building itself is a marvel. The conservation and renovation work is truly breathtaking. Many parts of the building will be preserved as close to its former state as possible, while modern additions will be added

The Old Supreme Court Building, site of the new National Gallery of Singapore is built in the late 1930s. Today, it’s considered a national monument and is undergoing a transformation into a jewel of Singapore. I love old buildings, I really do. Especially those being transformed into more than its former self. Here I am exploring it in the midst of its transformation which is making me really excited for its official opening later this year.

Enjoy the view from The Old Supreme Court Building balcony. I had a sneak peak. Soon, everyone’s going to be able to enjoy this when the National Gallery Singapore opens.

On a public courtyard inside the soon to be opened National Gallery, the modern trimmings start to show. With a modern enclave enveloping the Old Supreme Court building translate to plenty of spaces just to hang out and people watch. I love the play of lights this design creates and I’m sure this will be turning out as one of the favourite spots to take selfies.

Can’t wait to come back when all the art is up and it’s officially opened!"
