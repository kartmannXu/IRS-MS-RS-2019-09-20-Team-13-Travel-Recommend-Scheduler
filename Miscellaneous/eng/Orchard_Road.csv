,,So much variety and window shopping galore,5.0,,"Even if you're not a big shopper, Orchard Road is very entertaining. There's a fantastic mix of stores, places to eat and interesting things to look at. Venture off the main drag and explore some of the basement malls and back streets to find even more interesting things."
,,Worth spending the day on Orchard Road.,5.0,,"This was a great day exploring the shopping and food outlets, we found a lot of great food places and even better shopping places."

,,A busy street like it has always been,4.0,,Spending two dasy shopping and not leaving Orchard Road speaks for itself. Such a range of goods and services!
,,Shop Eat Shop coffee break Shop,5.0,,"This is a mega shopping district of shopping malls. A agglomate of high end labels eg Rolex and family friendly stores eg Uniclo.
all can be found in this stretch of road. The limiting factors as a shopper are time and stamina. Plan the trip well if you wish to shop at various malls. Some malls are conveniently connected underground eg. Tangs, Lido, Ion, Wheelock place , Wisma atria and Takashimaya. There are plenty cafes, coffee, restaurants and food court in each mall to feed your hunger and thrist."
,,Shopping street,4.0,,There are brandname shops all around. (MRT NS22 Orchard red Line)or else start from MRT somerset for start shopping though.
,,Have money will Shop,5.0,,its a shopper's paradise but for the rich and wealthy. A lot of options are there but all are on the costliest side.
,,Wander along as far as you can,5.0,,"It is of course rather hot in Singapore but it is really worth wandering along Orchard Rd as far as you can manage in the heat. There are of course many places to stop and cool off and so many of the ""big name"" stores to visit if you wish. It's a lovely atmosphere despite being busy but do expect lots of other tourists."
,,The most popular street in Singapore,5.0,,"Coming to this area your eyes will be happy to see the malls, the interiors and the brand outlets. You do not have to shop and just do a window shopping or just sit and watch people passing by young and old you will be happy.
With wide pedestrian and big trees along the street.
Almost all the malls here provide free wife for the visitors.
A must visit street in Singapore."
,,Great shopping road,4.0,,"This is one of Singapore's main road full of shops and malls. My Top-3 Orchard Road of shopping malls is: 1) ION Orchard Mall, 2) Plaza Singapura and 3) Orchard Central. Orchard Road is nice for strolling around, but for shopping my favourites are the malls Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and Suntec City."
,,Heart of Singapore,3.0,,This is the heart of Singapore..Surrounded by shopping malls and plenty of eateries places there. You may buy all traded items even though all are expensive ..
,,Shop city.,4.0,,"The original Orchard Rd shopping Mecca of the 70s and 80s, which was why you visited Singapore, is gone but you can still find all the name brands as you would in all the other great shopping towns of the world. Just don't expect a bargain like you did back in the day. Still there are way to many Galleries,Malls, arcades and strips to visit without coming away with something."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"A walk down Orchard road is a must. I think the only thing you can't do on this road is buy a car, but I didn't try, so don't know. All the brands are here, from $ to $$$$. If you need retail therapy, this is the spot. By exploring all the centres, you are guaranteed you will find what you're looking for! Hence, if you want to see variety and options, this is the one stop area. Prices are not hugely discounted, unless you get lucky with special season offerings. There are other places in Singapore where you'll get factory prices etc. This road is about variety and no shortage anything from clothing to electronics. Also, you wont get hungry either."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"A very well laid out shopping area with almost every possible designer store and high street fashion store worldwide. Trees shade the Main Street and there are 3 MRT stations one can alight at to reach the shops - Orchard, Somerset ( located in the middle of Orchard Road ) or Dhoby Ghaut. Many malls are connected underground to avoid the heat. Do try the local ice cream in various flavours, sandwiches between 2 wafer biscuits or sweet coloured bread for $1. Music and activities over the weekends gives it a festive vibe. Smokers are only allowed to use designated smoking ‘box zones’ so great for non smokers."
,,You can spend a day here,5.0,,"Apart from the big malls, there are plenty of small vendors selling lots of good products at good prices. You need to explore the malls - there are so many hidden gems of cafes and restaurants as well as sales on regularly. A must see for shopping!"
,,Recommend Ion Mall,5.0,,"Recommend visiting Ion Orchard Mall. Interesting architecture. Top brands in higher floors, more affordable lower floors. Our teen girls loved the shopping."
,,Overpriced & Chaotic,3.0,,"Did not enjoy the part of Orchard Road that we saw.
The shopping centres were huge, very overpriced & so freezing in the airconditioning.
Took us about half hour to work out how to get across the street, only way was to find the right underground tunnel to walk through!"
,,Shopping was great!,5.0,,"So many big malls along the same area, can't finish within a day and you need at least 3 days to complete..."
,,Shopping for all,5.0,,"Although the visual emphasis is on Armani and Tiffany, there's clearly enough variety here to keep shoppers of all pocketbooks engaged. Wonderful restaurants, too."
,,Well could not find much there,3.0,,Orchard Road is regarded as the top shopping destination in Singapore. We'll on the day we went it must have been shut. If you want to deposit you silver or gold bullion we'll this is the place as for shopping in general there is not much there for the average shopper. Much better shopping in Bangkok Iconsiam and cheaper. If you are into Singapore culture and heritage visit some of the old streets by Orchard Gateway.
,,Used to be better,3.0,,Orchard Road was the place to be like a decade or two ago... Now it is much less attractive because there are other places with bigger malls and attractions
,,It's Orchard Road,4.0,,"High end shopping with all marquee brands present. Wide walkways and can easily spend money and time in shopping. Must go, but prices tend to be steep."
,,An opportunity to shop until you drop!,4.0,,"We have visited Singapore on a number of occasions and at some stage during each visit, we have found ourselves in Orchard Road.
Our most recent visit to the island state was no different. We were on a Hop on, Hop off bus and when it reached one of the bus stops near the top end of Orchard Road, we hopped off to do a bit of shopping.
One immediate difference noted in contrast to previous visits to Orchard Road was the fact that smoking is now banned along the length of the road. There are large signs advising of this painted on the footpaths. Apparently the ban has been in place since earlier this year. This ban no doubt makes non-smokers happy and smokers unhappy!
As with our previous visits, we managed to visit a number of different shopping centres located along the road. We also popped into several department stores and numerous specialty shops.
Because Singapore is considered to have one of the most expensive cities in the world in which to live, we didn’t find too many bargains but as always, it was fun to search for them.
Orchard Road is certainly worth a visit by anyone holidaying in Singapore."
,,Fashion!,5.0,,"The place to go for shopping. Many malls and all major brand, from Gucci to Prada and others. At the end Orchard Towers is the place where go-go girls are. You can go or avoid."
,,WONDERFUL SHOPPING AREA,5.0,,"If you love shopping this is your heaven. Shops are clean, efficient and huge. Staff at the departmental stores were just so helpful and polite !"
,,nice place,5.0,,the orchard place is a nice place to do chopping while everythinf very sheap than usual . go there and see how cheaper it is
,,High Class Shopper's Paradise,3.0,,"I visited this road just to see what it has to offer but i was disappointed. Malls in row with high class brands is all i could spot on. If you have money and you are brandholic then this place is for you. But as a tourist i didn't find anything great on this so would not recommend visiting this place at all if you aren't staying near by. If you want some souvenir's and are on this road, you can go to Lucky Plaza which had budget china shops to offer you magnets, chocolates and vivid lights."
,,Central area.. Singapore,4.0,,"This is a major shopping destination & we loved this place. Office of President is here. Shopping centres includes centre point , design orchard , lucky plaza etc"
,,Not normally a city fan but,4.0,,"Found Singapore so interesting lots of places to visit you need a week at least to get around. All very clean and great places to eat. Good hotels all budgets. Great greenery everywhere, trees, flowers and lovely parks etc."
,,If you’re after high end clothes without limit,4.0,,Lots of high end stores for people who want known brands where a piece of clothes costs half of your monthly pay
,,Disappointing,3.0,,Was expecting much more having really enjoyed a visit made 10 years ago but disappointed to find mainly high end really expensive shops and those that were more affordable were not that special. We found the large Malls such as Suntec City have more varied and affordable shops than those of Orchard road.
,,Prepare your wallets for crazy shopping,5.0,,A seemingly endless row of shops and restaurants. You can spend a whole day here getting fat and wallet getting slimmer. Restrooms are clean. Streets are clean. Shops are well-stocked. But prices are high.
,,Oechard,5.0,,"In orchard , there are so many high buildings and appartements. And for the clothes it ia very cheap"
,,"High end at street level, cool stuff in the lower levels",4.0,,"Tiffany, Cartier, Hermes - advertisements for the high-end stores are at street level. go down 1-2 levels (ION, Tangs) and you can find all kinds of cool stuff at reasonable prices."
,,Branded shops,4.0,,It is good place to roam around and to shop. All branded shops are located here and very expensive as well.
,,Singapore’s main shopping street,5.0,,In this street you find an overload of shopping malls and luxury brand stores. I suggest to plan in advance as it is impossible to visit all stores in one day. Walking is comfortable and safe.
,,Always good for a stroll.,4.0,,"Orchard road still has everything for everyone. You have good bargains in Lucky Plaza next to the exquisite shopping like in Tang’s. Of course, plenty of dining available as well, but in general pricey and we found better deals - quality, quantity and price wise - off Orchard road. Besides that, we always love to come back to Orchard road, and out of convenience even get some food there.
For visitors a must, especially to experience the gathering of the bird in the trees there in the evening. But don’t necessarily sit under them for a rest."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Walked up and down Orchard Road at least once each day for 8 days. Plenty of shopping road side as well as in several large shopping malls. I thinh ION is the largest.
,,"Shop, shop and shop",4.0,,"2.5kms of shopping malls where you will find everything from Chanel to $1 shops. Can't find a shop then you haven't been to Orchard Road. Make sure you leave your credit card at home, lol."
,,Singapore's Champs Elysees,4.0,,"Something for everyone here - from the hideously expensive luxury brands to cheap noodle bars or five-star hotels. While this is probably the busiest street in Singapore pavements are wide and not uncomfortably crowded - and because its Singapore, very clean. Well worth chilling out here. This is the street connecting the Botanic Gardens areas with the modern downtown section of town."
,,Overpriced and Overrated,3.0,,The stores here are what you would see in any nice shopping area around the world. Everything is severely overpriced. Everything meaning even the coffee at Starbucks.
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Orchard road is very central and an ideal base in Singapore. Lots of great shopping malls, restaurants and other activities. Easy and cheap to travel to anywhere within the city, either by taxi, train or bus."
,,Crazy by night,5.0,,"I have experienced some Chinese fusion food here and it tasted much better than I expected, also with this season there might be some discount with these international brands"
,,Went mad with shopping,5.0,,"If you love shopping, that is a place you need to go to. Very good deals. Quality is good Value for money!"
,,What a great place for walk,5.0,,"One of the most favorite place for shopping, walking and sightseeing. With a hundreds of shops and restaurants, orchard road Aingapore has become the most iconic place since long time ago. On weekdays, it’s little bit quite though not as crowd as on the weekend."
,,Sherin Nafie,4.0,,"It is the heart of Singapore city center. A one way street stretching approx 2 km & lined with stores, hotels & mostly shopping malls with food courts in their basements. U can buy designer or street wise brands, stay at a hotel or enjoy a meal. I liked Takashimaya, ION, Paragon & Tanglin malls."
,,Lives up to its REPUTATION,5.0,,"This time we took two of our granddaughters (who were on their first overseas trip) and they were blown away - that it was the GSS [Great Singapore Sale week]] made it even better. The shopping was excellent though you had to dig deep to find the bargains. On this trip we discvered the Din Tain Fung dumpling restaurants which our grandkids just adored - the food was freshly made, served beautifully, in immaculately clean premises and was great value. We know where we will eat on our next visit to Singapore"
,,A shoppers paradise,2.0,,"A shoppers paradise, but don't bother venturing this way if you are not that way inclined. It's a full strip of shopping malls from designer brands in the ION mall to the more affordable as you walk back down the strip. The tree lined road was nice, but wouldn't return."
,,Shopping,3.0,,Good place to do your shopping have plenty shopping malls in a row have h and m and other shopping malls
,,Still a lot of great shopping - but pretty badly over-developed,3.0,,"It had been 17 years since I last visited Orchard Road, and it has most certainly changed. Some of the malls are still there (Paragon, Plaza Singapura, etc.), but it's really been overdeveloped, and feels more like an expensive tourist trap. It's still easily accessible via bus and MRT - and makes for a very nice stroll."
,,So much to look at as well as shop!,5.0,,"Broad walking footpaths, easy arcade crossing to the other side or walk across the road at the lights - the drivers are great as they actually watch out for you! Lots of variety in shops from international department stores, high end boutiques, name brands and little arcade stalls selling everything from new cameras to vintage luggage. And shoes! I can't buy shoes in Australia as I have a size 36 foot - and I had choices in Singapore"
,,Love the variety of food and shopping malls,5.0,,"Explored Opera Food Court at basement of Orchard ION shopping mall above Orchard Train Metro Station.
The local food choices are amazing. Walked to Ngee Ann City Shopping mall (Takashimaya or in local slang TAKA), basement to check out japanese stalls selling street food like Takoyaki.
Walked further to Lucky Plaza and checked out Philllippines' infamous fast food chain (that beat MacDonalds and KFC) - Jolliebee and tried Halo Halo (ice shave dessert).

Walk down, to explore Somerset Train station and vicinity - Somerset 313 offers interesting German Eatery Marche, Rosti (Potato slices swiss german style with sour cream).

If you like a late night eat out, try Mandarin Hotel (Orchard) or try CHINA Styled HotPot - Hai Di Lao (Somerset 313) opens till 2am i think."
,,Enormous variety of shops at all price levels.,5.0,,"This is a bustling area with shops, malls, and many restaurants. We went on a Friday night (5;00ish) and it was very crowded. May give some people anxiety! Some of the roads do not have cross walks and you must go underground to cross the intersections (which gets very disorienting with all the crowds and stores, so we kept finding ourselves exiting on the wrong corner). I think you would need months and months to visit all the stores, literally. If you aren't looking for premium brands, try checking out the shops in the lower 2 levels of the Ion mall. My 16 year old daughter loved the shops down there, and they were very affordable. We needed to buy another piece of luggage for the trip home, and found great deals at the Lucky Plaza."
,,Good shopping,5.0,,For affordable shopping try lucky plaza and orchard central. ION mall is only for high end brands...
,,Great shops,4.0,,"We had a great time shopping, there were plenty of specials, shops were have up-to 50% off the prices of cloths. We walked away with bags of cloths. You need a full day to see all the shops, they are open from 10am until 10pm. A must visit."
,,Seen 1 mall seen most of them,5.0,,"Orchard road shops are famous for the variety of top class shopping you can wish for.But many malls have the same high end brands as each other. Some like Tangs and Ion are different but the massive malls like Istanbul, Paragon,Scott’s centre , and Marina Bay Sandsare all similar but massive. Once you have seen a few then the next one won’t have much more. There is no need to see too many because Singapore has more than shopping.
Ty"
,,Best Area to Stay in Singapore,5.0,,"Its the best area to stay in Singapore if you are on holiday as Orchard Road has the best malls, hotels, cinemas, restaurants and some good pubs. There are always great street promotions or some entertainment act taking place along with a variety of street vendors. Hotels on Orchard Road tend to be a bit more pricey due to the location. There are a number of MRT stations along the Road which makes access to locations across central Singapore very easy."
,,The business Hub!,5.0,,"Who could not enjoy this throbbing city centre and its quieter back streets. Such busy area, one is challenged in crossing the street. We walked all the way up and all the way down."
,,Good for shopping,4.0,,"Good for shopping with a lot of street performers. Most of the stuff sold there are not cheap, but are luxury products."
,,Shopping is shopping,4.0,,Nothing special with regards to location of local products and designers. Lots of commercial high end brands. It’s a big shopping strip.
,,Always different,4.0,,"I visit Singapore every couple of years and Orchard Road always changes. You think that you know it well until you step out two years later and all is different. Great shopping and food. Better after dark, it can be hot in the daytime."
,,Shopping Mecca,4.0,,"Orchard road wold be the ultimate shopping Mecca if you are after designer brands, but having said that there are areas of Orchard road that cater for the not so designer brands"
,,"Highstreet shops, good night life options",4.0,,Orchard road has mainly high street shops which are good for window shopping. It also has good options for night life. There are many pubs and bars. A visit here is recommended to get the glimpse of modern Singapore.
,,Overrated,3.0,,This is lovely to visit but you don’t want to open your purse unless you are filthy rich. We had a drink each and it was $58. Mins was just juice and the other other 2 had ice cream in it. Often prices aren’t displayed which shows how expensive items are. Went there years ago much more reasonably priced. Wouldn’t go back.
,,Worth a look,4.0,,Loads of great shops and option here. We enjoyed strolling around. Nice air con shops and the staff are nice.
,,Get you shop and eat on in Orchard road,5.0,,"Plenty of places to shop and eat! Offers both local and international variety. Can be a bit of a walk between buildings in the Singaporean heat, so try it later in the day. Looking for a drink or a off-to-the-side relieve from all of the action in Orchard road? Check out Emerald Hill for cool bars, eateries and a quick escape from the vibe in Orchard road."
,,Loads of expensive malls,3.0,,This place is good for a wander but the malls are full of stores that are pretty expensive (we live in western Europe)
,,An evergreen oasis of action and positivity!,5.0,,"The spirit of Singapore is encapsulated in a walk on Orchard Road. You see young and old, you see all colors all nationalities. You can easily spot singaporean residents by their meaningful ""I-need-to-get-somewhere-soon"" walk! I am always positively amused and happy to see how much goes on here. So many shopping choices, food options or just a juice or coffee on the go in a very typically Singaporean plastic takeaway bag for juice or coffee etc. I have always felt safe on this street, whether early in the morning or late at night. All in all, this city reflects the soul of Singapore."
,,This shopping mecca is even more frenetic than before...,4.0,,Orchard Road alternately dazzled and baffled with its relentless and chaotic energy recently. it was frantically busy and new shops and malls appeared to have sprung up everywhere- even since my last visit!
,,SHOPPERS PARADISE,5.0,,"Every type of shops for the bargain and high fashion person. Shop till you drop, you will undoubtedly find what you want."
,,Great Shopping and eating,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a major shopping area in Singapore, where you can buy so many things, and eat well very economically. It is, as is most of Singapore, green with gardens, trees and tropical flowers. A slow walk along Orchard Road demonstrates the multi-cultural nature of Singapore and provides great people watching. Pavements are spotlessly clean as are the shopping centres and many restaurants. It is well worth a visit if you are in Singapore."
,,Shoppera Paradise Road,4.0,,"Its a must place to go for shopping especially for fashionistas! Branded stuff department store, try Takashimaya at Nge Ann, Robinson at The Heeren, Isetan at Shaw Tower or go to retails shops/boutiques. Locals souvenirs can be find at Lucky Plaza. Foods easily found at restaurant or Kopitiam(Foodcourts). Nearest MRT are Orchard, Somerset and Dhoby Gout. Some hotels are side by side the malls or walking distances. Very convinient."
,,Rodeo Drive experience,4.0,,"We had to go to Orchard Road to get to the Apple Store. It was a fabulous trip in the top of the open bus, and they made many stops, so you could get out anywhere, but just seeing all the designer store fronts was quite an experience. A great walk to window shop, don't know how many of us could afford to buy. We also took the bus back at night time - great to see."
,,Lots and lots of shopping with big crowds,5.0,,We walked up and down and under Orchard Road and the variety of shops is overwhelming. From big name brands to boutique brands there is something for everyone. If you don’t mind crowds and you like to shop and want variety then this is the place for you. Just bring you credit card
,,Shopping for all Budgets,5.0,,"The glamour of Orchard Road cannot be understated. It’s like Rodeo Dr. times twenty. What impressed me most however, was that there were plenty of stores where you could get deals across the entire spectrum. The malls were all impeccable and the AC is welcome in the summer.
Plus, if you bring your passport they will deduct the Tax before you pay.
There are plenty of restaurants across all price ranges as well."
,,Bring your credit card!!,3.0,,You have to visit orchard road to experience the crazy shops not for the faint hearted shops are expensive bt all the top brands if that's your thing.
,,Bling and more bling!,4.0,,It has to be seen! Stunning shops if you can afford the prices but the whole shopping area is spotless and shiny.
,,Retail therapy on steroids,4.0,,"Orchard Road is paradise, if retail is what you seek. Thousands of shops, all beautifully presented and brilliant bargains in each and every one, apparently. For me, it was a bit too much, too much choice, too many stores, too many high prices. Nice for a visit to see it, it is iconic, a bit of people watching was fun, but an hour was enough."
,,Ideal Place for the Shopaholics,4.0,,Shopping for all the major brands and reasonable prices is the hallmark of the Orchard Road shopping experience
,,Expensive and Brand Shopping,5.0,,"Orchard street is one of the best when it comes to expensive and high end brands.

You will find a lot of eateries and restaurants here too.
Definitely a shoppers paradise."
,,Shop Until You Drop,4.0,,"If you like to shop high end then this is the place for you.

,,Shoppers delight.,4.0,,"We had a few hours here and had a walk around the area. There are many designer shops here. All the designers that you can imagine . Not many people in the shops though. Singapore is one of the most expensive places to visit. Worth a visit though just to window shop.

."
,,One of the finest places to shop around,5.0,,"One who loves to shop top notch brands, this is the place. Both side of the road offers shopping malls like Paragon, Lucky Plaza etc. consisting all sort shops offering various types of luxury goods. The place is neat and clean and well maintained. In the afternoon when thousands of birds gather around the trees of the roads, it feels heavenly to simply sit around with a a cup of coffee."
,,Best place to visit,5.0,,"I have been working in Orchard Road since 1986 . This place is like my 2nd work home. There is a lot of shopping to go like wisma, Ion, wheellockplace, Heeren, Isetan Scott’s, etc. There is good fast food if you want a quick bite or pamper yourself with Chinese or western food in restaurant. You can spend one whole day shopping and eating. This is a place you must visit. If you don’t you are not touring in Singapore"

Try to starve yourself the day before, so u can consume the many types of food from the different type of restaurants along Orchard Road.

Best time to walk n shop along Orchard Road is during Tues/ Wed/ Thurs, when there are less people / customers ...

I will assure you that, you can keep coming back to Orchard Road again n again n you will never be bored. It is an exciting place.

There are also large Cinemas, like Shaw House, along Orchard Road and Cathay Cinema, near Plaza Singapura Mall/.,

,,Chirping birds while you walk on the Orchard street,5.0,,This street is extra ordinarily expensive with big brands. One can find some local pubs and lots of beer bars. We went to a bar who sells beer with pizza called ‘ Pizzatime’ and it was the most amazing pizza I had. Cool environment at the courtyard full of beer bustlers. Street walk is pretty nature friendly as you hear lots of birds chirping while you walk. You can find some Singapori food streets too which are very cheap but closes by 10:00pm. I am staying at Hotel Chancellor which is equally good.
,,International brands,5.0,,The road to all international brands from Gucci to salvatore. There are plenty of malls here with generous amount of shops and collections. We visited Ion mall and Takashimaya too. Loved the whole day out at this place. We so badly want a massage now enjoyed our day

,,Shopping street. Just that.,3.0,,"Well, it is a shopping street with luxury everywhere... but this is something you can find absolutely everywhere else in the world.

,,Singapore's iconic shopping street,5.0,,"The first time I visited Orchard Road was in 1979 on a holiday, and a year later I moved to Singapore to work. Many of the malls, hotels and office blocks that I saw back then are still here such as Lucky Plaza, Orchard Towers, Plaza Singapura, Shaw House, the Mandarin Hotel, Orchard Hotel, Tangs (it used to be C.K.Tang) etc.

Orchard Road is one of the most famous shopping streets in the world. The shopping malls are fantastic for buying clothing, luxury goods and eating out. You can walk from one end of the street, near the Orchard Hotel near Orange Grove Road all the way to Plaza Singapore and the Cathay at the other end and just shop until you drop.

Even though I have been here hundreds of times over the years, and prefer exploring more cultural and historical and natural places, I still really love to come here.

For me, Orchard Road is a must-visit place when in Singapore. It's also a good place to visit on a rainy day since you can sometimes go from mall to mall without even going outdoors."
,,Skip Orchard rd,2.0,,It had been a little drizzly so the paving on Orchard Rd was slippery. We visited the new takashimaya mall then walked on down the road. Every designer store in location but atmosphere dull and artificial. Better options available
,,Walk down orchard road,5.0,,Orchard road is the high end road of Singapore and a evening walk with ample opportunities to dine and shop.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,Shopping mecca of Singapore with a number of malls and high end stores. Very animated day and night.
,,Lively area!,5.0,,"Orchard road has a lot of shopping malls! If you are in a mood to shop all day long and then stop by for a coffee, drinks or food this is a great area!"
,,Weekday shopping strip,5.0,,"Take a stroll along orchard road on weekdays, from plaza sing to forum mall. Must get is the ice cream ahpek available on certain parts of the walkway. At 7pm, here the birds call their gang home non stop till about 7.30pm. If its too warm, pop into the malls for some shopping. Then walk down again on the other side of the road."
,,very good,4.0,,"They have a lot of shops out here. non branded malls like lucky plaza. branded items you will get in malls like OG, Take, paragon clean street and have lots of hotels."
,,JUST A WHOLE LOTTA SHOPS AND MALLS,3.0,,"If you've been to NYC, London, Paris or in fact any main centre in the world, there is (in my opinion), no need to visit Orchard Street....it is just another of all of the same....."
,,Multiple shopping options for every budget,5.0,,"There are actually a huge range of different types of shops, its fun to just wander around and get lost. Within a fairly small area from the Orchard and SUmmerset SMRT stations, there are a number of interesting shopping centres to check out. Some of the more prominent brands are naturally easy to spot, but we also found a lot of more interesting and reasonably priced stores throughout and within the different shopping complexes. We likes ION orchard, 313 summerset, and orchard gateway more so for different japanese store options we like but don't have at home."
,,A must in Singapore,5.0,,"A street of shopping adventure, made for all. The shops are fantastic of relieving you of your money. lucky Plaza is a shoppers dream spend as much or as little as you want."
,,Shoppin,5.0,,"Great road, very long and some great restaurants, Raffes hotel is closed for refurb but you can still have a look at what is not being worked on"
,,Nothing spectacular...,3.0,,Wouldn't waste my time there again. Unless you are there to spend lots of $$$$ and have lost of time (and comfy walking shoes) then don't go there.
,,Still is an original Singapore icon!,5.0,,"The entire stretch, lined with shops of any kind. Filled with Sunday revelers- from just simply strolling the entire stretch to shopping until they drop. This place has everything for everyone! Still is gorgeous!"
,,Orchard,5.0,,"This place is standard for Singaporean’s and tourists to come, whether you are looking for something to buy or for a place to just hang out and chill."
,,Shopping Mecca,4.0,,I only gave this 4 stars as I’m not a big shopper. I suspect if you like shopping you would give it 5 stars. Also some great little places to eat. We tried a few local dishes from various outlets which was better than ordering everything from the one place
,,Top Spot,5.0,,"Packed with shops, bars and restaurants it is really a great spot to visit in Singapore. It is very accessible by public transport and a ‘smoke free zone’. Goes without saying, the legendary Singapore cleanliness is evident everywhere. Very safe to walk all times, but be vigilant when crossing the road. Only cross at specified pedestrians crossings, and in busy intersections use the underground passageway."
,,Interesting shopping place,4.0,,"Walk into malls just to cool off. Orchard road is a No Smoking Zone, except few place which are ""Zoned off"" for smoking."
,,Worth a walk down oneside and up the other.,3.0,,It remindes me of 5th Avenue of New York or the Champs in Paris. Lots of high end shopping with plenty of food stops in between.
,,Beautiful place for malls & shopping,5.0,,"IF you are not the one to shop from Chinatown, then Orchard Road is for you. You have good malls for buying souvenirs for your trip"
,,Upscale,3.0,,Orchard Road is the 5th Ave of Singapore lined from one end to another with expensive international stores plus Starbucks and McDonalds every 100 Ft. Not my cup of tea but a must if you are there for longer than 3 days.
,,Vibrant city,5.0,,"Everybody knows Orchard is the most trendy, most busy, most vibrant and most visited place in singapore! A word of advice, if you guys strolling aroung the underground shops, be sure to use the interactive directory placed along the underground as you tend to easily get lost."
,,Mall metropolis,4.0,,"If shopping is on your agenda, you needn't venture further than Orchard Road. Malls line either side of the road with almost every brand under the sun. Make sure you visit one of the street side ice-cream carts for an ice-cream sandwich!"
,,Looks quiet,3.0,,Nothing interested unless you like to shopping and less decorations during this time I just went to orchad road today and the road looks so quiet less people though it was already 6pm.
,,Too big to see in a week,5.0,,"You literally could shop till you drop, it's one huge shopping plaza after another. We only had half a day here and barely scratched the surface - from high-end retail to $1 shops and everything in between. Don't forget your wallet!"
,,Not so happening place,2.0,,This place is only and only for shopping. There are malls on both sides of road and most of them offer similar products. If you have been to malls any where in the world then you can skip this totally and explore other great attraction in Singapore.
,,Heart of the City State,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the most famous place in Singapore this is the center of the city for almost all purposes. You can find the latest Fashion and Luxury here most of the Offices for big companies are also here. This is a long stretch of commercial road basically housing many Malls, financial institutes and Luxury hotels. It can be difficult to navigate with a baby stroller as not only the roads but the walkways are also crazy busy but a visit to Singapore is incomplete without going to the Iconic Orchard Road."
,,A real shopping experience,4.0,,Walking along Orchard Road from the MRT station doesn't look much different than any other street until you get to these colossal building which house everything a shopaholic would dream about. I am not really a shopping centre person but have to admit I enjoyed looking through all the different stores on offer. You will need a full day to look at everything and there are bargains to be found. Also plenty of places to eat with a variety of foods. Other plus is spending time in the air conditioning to get away from the humidity that is Singapore.
,,Good place to shop,4.0,,The place has many shopping malls with international brands. A shopping paradise of international brands.
,,Unreal shopping area,4.0,,This street is famous in Asia and represents the prosperity of Singapore as a trading center where east meets west. If you are a high end shopper it is mandatory and if you are an observer of such things it’s cool.

,,Shopper’s Dream,5.0,,"If you’re into shopping or window shopping, you’ve got to come here.

If you’ve been to either Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, China, Taiwan and thought the shopping centers there were amazing, wait til you come here. Enormous malls with huge varieties of stores can be found here. It’s not dirty and you can end up walking around for hours and still not get to the other side. I was only able to spend a couple hours here but you can totally spend days if you’re into window shopping. The food here is great too!"
,,What a shopping strip,4.0,,"Walked from Botanic Gardens to here, great food at Thai expo, anything you want is probably here, no car dealers."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"Shopping malls with discount outlets, everything you need you can find there.

There are also National Museum of Singapore and Singapore Art Museum for those who like art and history. Bunch of great restaurants."
,,Walk,5.0,,The best road to walk about and to be seen. This is the Best of the shopping belt in Singapore. Large department stores and designer boutiques are easily accessed.
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"By this time the new Raffles will have opened (I hope). High end shopping in this area but you have to visit the Long Bar in the Raffles hotel. Reservations are required, but they are famous for the Singapore sling. They have a gift shop as well that's well worth the visit. Bit pricey."
,,Quite far out the way of the city just for fancy shops.,3.0,,If you like high end shopping or just looking around designer brands and lots of well dressed rich people this is the place for you. After we got 2 metro's to get there we were slightly dissapointed that it was all so fashionable but it looks cool and we still found a place to have a beer :)
,,Best Shopping Malls Ever,5.0,,I had a great experience of shopping there. I feel like this the best place for shopping. They have great quality products.

,,The place to spend your money,3.0,,"This is a street lined with high end hotels and shops. You can find fashions and electronics, as well as chic cafes’ and restaurants."

,,Wow Shopping,5.0,,"There is just everything a shopper could want, plenty of variety and is was a great experience. Enjoyed the shopping, the food and the people watching is a must do."
,,Always something fresh at Orchard Road,4.0,,"First and what seems to be an endless road of retail establishments, from high end international brands to open market stalls that locals favor for local flavor, Orchard Road always has something new and fresh to offer to the first time or repeat visitors. This time, we checked in at Chacellor Hotel at Orchard which turned out to be at the edge of the city district. Young Singaporeans and foreign workers frequent this particularly at night where Karaoke bars, massage parlors and ladies of the night winking at passers-by with the promise of a really good time inside."
,,Shopping Heaven?,5.0,,"Orchard Road was about 5 minutes walk from our hotel. We were told about it by the hotel staff. Nothing could prepare us for the joy/horror of the shops. As an individual who hates shopping this was actually quite good. There are shopping centres, a cinema, food outlets and restaurants. For the more upmarket shopper there are designer stores aplenty. For the less than upmarket shopper there are cheaper and just as interesting shops around. It's a great area to kick about in for a few hours. Just note that if you're a smoker, the whole street is no smoking so you'll have to find a smoking area on a side road."
,,If you like shopping...,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise! We strolled around for a while just to see the area, people watch and to experience the atmosphere. It is worth visiting, just to see the hundreds of shops and shoppers.."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,If your into shopping then Orchard Road Singapore is a must go to location. My wife ensured we visited on more than one occasion. You can spend big or save as there are plenty of bargains.
,,Shopping malls if high end stores,4.0,,Just saw this from the big bus tour. We were not interested in Shopping here since we have to go to Thailand in a couple of days. It looks very nice.
,,Shopping heaven...but high end,3.0,,We found alot of high end stores here so well out of our price range but so many malls and so many shops and was actually a bit hard to navigate it all.
,,Easy to find,4.0,,"Great spot in Singapore, easy acess from the MRT. Lots of markets and shops to visit to get cheap food that tastes amazing."
,,Shopping street,3.0,,Lots of mall and mall and mall. Good food courts at some malls basement. Must try food there. It's cheap but good experience.
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"This is the area for high end shopping in Singapore, if you are not there for shopping, there is not much you can do here other than walk around and get bored with all the brands showcasing their incredibly expensive stuff.

There are a couple of malls worth going over - ION being one worthy of mentioning."
,,Iconic road but better shopping destinations elsewhere in the road,2.0,,Ok so it’s a shopping road. However let’s be clear it’s no Champs Elysee or Fifth Avenue! Full to brim of shopping malls with the usual suspects / big brands in the malls. I prefer more traditional streets where the brands are more accessible in stores at street level rather than faceless shopping malls. Not my retail destination of choice.
,,"Crowded, but good place to kill time...",4.0,,lots of shopping mall... eateries... a lot of underpass to link different malls together. A central place for Singapore. one can easily spend a lot time walking along the street to check out all the malls to kill time...
,,So many malls,5.0,,"We stayed on orchard road so we were in amongst the hustle and bustle. So many malls your spoilt for choice. We found a good food court in the basement of one mall close to where we wete staying. Food was very reasonable and beautiful chinese food. It had a mixture of western food but no maccas etc which made a nice change, didnt see 1 whenever we walked up and down orchard road. So many big malls with food courts, so you are spoilt for choice for both shopping and food and lots of sales on when we were there in April. Plenty of public transport subway or buses to get from one end to the other and plenty of cheap taxis. Getting around Singapore is so easy and I love that it is so clean."
,,all about Shopping,4.0,,"A street full of shopping malls , good for both discounted & upscale shopping .Newton food center not to be missed ."
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"Busy, bustling and surrounded with high end shopping outlets. Will recommend tourists to come down and enjoy the shopping experience and the duck tours. Entertainment centres and great food outlets for the locals to enjoy too during leisure."
,,Shopping high end,3.0,,"You would go here just to say you have been, but high end shopping. Would recommend Lucky chicken for lunch it is located in one of the malls."
,,Walking around,4.0,,Orchard Road offers numerous shopping experiences for food clothing and anything else you might want. Public transportation is readily and easily available.
,,Friday Evening,5.0,,Its reminds me the Bond street of London. Full with life & glowing attractions with musicians & magicians are show casing their talents. Enjoyed the Mango ice cream from local vendors reminds me of childhood memories.
,,Nothing special without shopping,4.0,,Nothing special. Just many department stores and shops. I just passed by the shopping malls for AC. I’ve just had a cup of draft beer there. If you dont have plan to go shopping then no need to go there I think. Oh I bought a bathboom at Lush for bath.
,,Need to visit,4.0,,Very nice place to visit. Lots of shop. Lots of food. Large Japanese shops to visit. Yhere is a modern mosque that worth visiting.
,,A place for everyone.,4.0,,"A place where everyone in the family will enjoy. Have gyms, playground, shops, foods, cinema and much more."
,,Busy shopping area,3.0,,"Orchard road is packed end to end with malls and is always busy. Many if the malls have the same shops so it's not quite as diverse as the size would suggest. Whilst there are a tremendous number of shops it's often too busy with masses of people window shopping. Many of the high end shops are snooty and many of the shop attendants are overly assertive and want to stay right next to you when you want to browse, they do not want to leave you alone. Whilst I understand some people may like this I find it frustrating and it often makes me leave"
,,Stunning,5.0,,We stayed for five nights and discovered more and more each day.Some very expensive areas and some very reasonable areas to have a lovely meal. So many shopping centres underground. A must see.
,,Concrete Sterile Gungle,3.0,,"Orchard Rd was a place I heard about some wanted to see. Close to my hotel i made a visit.
Its mainly a strip with many shopping malls.
The malls are fairly modern and give you a place to hang out in from the outside humidity.
Went to the food courts a few times and they were ok.
The strip to me felt a little sterile and lacked something. But there are many shopping malls and shops in Orchard Rd."
,,mostly high end stores,4.0,,walked the street was very good but too many high end stores very pleasant enjoed the walk took the mrt to get here was very easy
,,"Busy, but cool.",4.0,,"This is a vibrant and buzzing road. It is busy thought. Line with shops and food, gorgeous trees and lots of birds as well. Amazing bookstore on the 4th floor in one of the malls. Shopping and more shopping."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"If your pocket is deep enough, this is the place for you. All the real brands in one place. Super polite staff,even if you are not buying. Organised transport. What more could you ask. Personal best: ION Orchard Mall top floor."
,,Loads of shops,4.0,,A great street to walk up and down with plenty of shops and places for food and drink. Lots of roads off where you can get some great bargains and food too.
,,"For you, if you like shopping",4.0,,"One wonderful and expensive shop and gallery after another. If you enjoy that, is the place you should not miss. My wife enjoy it, my wallet no."
,,A compulsory stop off for our grand daughter!,3.0,,"Coming back from the Zoo on a rainy day, we came past Orchard road on the tour bus and saw a “ Victoria’s Secrets”. Our grand daughter had implored us to bring her back at least one item for her. We asked the driver if he would drop us off and that we would make our own way back.
We were blown away by the humongous prices! Most expensive undies ever! But we bought her some.
Onwards to other shops but unfortunately we found them all to be a bit high end for us. We caught a cab back to China Town."
,,Tourist target but interesting,4.0,,"Orchard rd has so many boutiques and exclusive stores. My favourite is lucky plaza. It's the perfect place for great value clothes, snacks, bags and other items. Level 6 near jollibean has an awesome flea market. Song and song is also a great store with well priced clothes. The food court in the basement is wonderful but do not go to lucky plaza on Sunday's. It's packed. Great food shops instead also on various levels."
,,Awesome shopping destination,5.0,,We stayed on orchard road and if you love shops this is perfect for you ! Amazingly huge shopping centres and they usually link to each other but they can feel a bit like a rabbit Warren if you don’t have your bearings !
,,All the shopping in the world,5.0,,"I stayed very close to Orchard Road while in Singapore so I headed there for a first walk. It is a road full of markets and malls, so you have all the shopping options in the world."
,,A shoppers paradise,4.0,,A shopping mecca of Singapore. Designer shops to any possible brand- A store for everything. The shops are very pricey but well worth the look!!!!!!
,,Shopping for all,4.0,,Just yards from our hotel was the famous busy Orchard Road with all its shops. It has no other feature except being a wide road heavily trafficked and hard to cross except by underpass. Superb for the shopper but otherwise a road.
,,A shopping mecca,5.0,,"If you’re looking for something with a label, this is the place to visit, designer shops in abundance from Michael Kors to Prada to Louis Vuitton, it’s very expensive but well worth a look, it’ll take you at least 3-4 hours just to wander around get your bearings & see one mall, but there are some interesting sculptures & pieces of art along the way."
,,Fifth Avenue,4.0,,The best street in Singapore. This is like the 5th Avenue of NYC. Best malls. Good buildings. Look at the residential buildings in the lane. Lovely place .
,,Busy shopping street,4.0,,"A meca for buyers, you'll need a full afternoon just to walk through one or two of its malls. Nice at night."
,,Expensive!,2.0,,"After coming from Bangkok, the shops here are very expensive. This includes the low end clothing too. Double what i paid. Nice to walk around and clean but save your money"
,,A must see,4.0,,Go there for the shopping and just to see the sights. Lots of shops from cheap to bankrupt small nations. We just liked walking around and looking at all the sights.
,,Champs Elysées of Singapore,4.0,,"I'm not a fan of shopping but if you are, this is the street. Mall after mall with all the big brands and they are in more than one mall (Louis Vuitton, same sidewalk twice in 5' walk; Prada, opposite sidewalk, twice in 10' walk). Some nice sculptures too."
,,Too many shops too see,4.0,,"We stayed at the Hilton and thought we could start at the beginning of Orchard Road and see as many shopping centers as possible.
Was Saturday on the Easter Long weekend and must have had the whole population of Singapore shopping.

Fantastic shops and amazing centers and Ion centre was fabulous. Takashimaya was amazing but only top end stores.
Only got to 8 centers as could not walk anymore as it was just to hot and humid.

Had two ice cream sandwiches walking as it was so hot and wish I could have bought more.
Worthwhile and not as many people as Hong Kong but definetly up market."
,,The excellent road !!,5.0,,"When we talk about infrastructure,there is no better way to describe how Singapore has achieved that perfect infrastructure and Orchard road takes this feeling to another level.

The malls surrounding the area whether it's ion mall,Wheelock place and all other surrounding shops n interesting places,it was a treat for the eyes.

That MRT has it's stations inside these malls, is an added advantage. If you pass orchard road in the night,you will have that Manhattan skyline feeling with all the glitzy billboards shining high.

In all,it's worth going there if you have some time in hand"
,,The best boulevard,5.0,,Orchard road is easily one of the best boulevards in the world. One of the most modern and the best places to shop in Singapore.
,,Non-stop shopping and eating that mirrors Singapore's prosperity - more top-end brand names than anyone could ever need,4.0,,"I've seen Orchard Road change over the last 40 years and can say it is a pretty good reflection of how Singapore has changed in that time as prosperity and wealth (extreme wealth in some cases) - and profound materialism - have grown on the island. On a superficial look it is non-stop brand names from end to end and only the best of them.

Actually, if you look more carefully there's more to it all - close to the intersection of Scotts Road (Grand Hyatt Hotel and others) and Orchard, at Ion Orchard you will find Cartier, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana clustered with Tiffany and Prada and so many others, you can also find Luck Plaza, several floors of cheap stores whose principal customers are maids and others whose annual salary would probably not be enough to buy one dress or one world-brand watch in Ion Orchard. I don't say this as some kind of social commentary and I have nothing but admiration for the phenomenal success of Singapore. But there's more to Orchard Road than just the obvious: keep your eyes open and your understanding and your experience will be richer."
,,A lot of locals and tourists.,5.0,,"One of the must visit/must go place when you are in Singapore. It is always crowded, it is always full of people, it is always a lively atmosphere, it is always happening. Street performances are there to inject happiness into the atmosphere."
,,Shopping Galore,5.0,,Ok girls this is the place to go. You can find just about anything you need in Orchard road. Plenty of places to shop and eat. You will probably need a massage after a hard days shopping
,,Oh the Shopping......,5.0,,"Plenty to see and buy. No bargains but plenty of variety and some options that we do not have at home. Was with teenage daughter so she couldn't be any happier. Numerous malls, so clean and easy to wander through it all."
,,Busy!,4.0,,"This place is full on! Loads of people everywhere not to mention the shops. Majority of shops are high end like Dior, Gucci, Prada etc which unless you have money you can’t afford to buy anything. Pity not more shops for other side of life"
,,The hub is back,5.0,,"Although we visit Singapore every few years to see family we had not been to Orchard Road for over 25 years, preferring newer areas. So when we visited this morning we were very favourably impressed. Older buildings in some of the side streets have been preserved and renovated and make a stunning contrast to the ultra modern new buildings such as the Singapore Apple Centre. Older department stores such as Takashimaya and Wilma seem to have been renovated or totally rebuilt. The main SMRT stations at Somerset, Orchard and Dhobi Ghaut emerge through large shopping complexes. Visitors keen on shopping should set aside a full day"
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,Visisted Orchard Road and ticked it off the list. Huge range of high end shops and plenty to see. If your not into shopping this is not the place to visit .
,,Always fun,5.0,,"We always enjoy our visits here. The shopping is no longer cheap, but there's is lots of variety. Don't forget to eat in the food court where you can have a 3 course meal for about $10-12"
,,Worth doing the Orchad Rd walk,5.0,,Worth the walk along Orchard Rd to cover it's many shopping centres. Easy access from three MRT stations with every retail outlet you can imagine.
,,Great place to shop at,5.0,,Endless variety of shops to shop at and also so many different types of food to have when you're hungry. There is also the largest kinokuniya bookstore at takashimaya. Orchard road has everything that you need.
,,Great shopping street!,4.0,,Orchard Road has a multitude of different shops and malls. Start at the MRT Orchard Station and work your way down the street. We were surprised that many of the prices of clothing and goods were much less than we had remembered. It's just fun to meander down the street and poke around the street displays and shops. Also don't miss Lucky Plaza for another great assortment of shops.
,,Main shopping area,5.0,,If you want to buy something this is the place to go but I will warn you it’s not cheap . Everything is expensive in Singapore so don’t go there thinking you will get anything cheap not going to happen.
,,Still stacks up.,4.0,,"Although there are so many shopping precincts in Singapore now, Orchard Rd still stacks up as a genuinely good shopping strip. Loads of shops, high end and low end. Heaps of restaurants from Michelin star to hawker style."
,,Every shopper’s paradise,5.0,,"From luxury retail to world-class international cuisines, Singapore’s most famous shopping precinct is home to a wealth of experiences.Ion Ochard is famously futuristic-looking mall houses over eight levels of stores, from luxury brands to high street fashion and entertainment stores."
,,Late night shopping,4.0,,"We came here for a couple of hours in the evening, which was enough. You’d need a second mortgage to do some serious shopping but this was a good place to walk down after dinner at Hard Rock. Good atmosphere, bright lights and shiny shops."
,,Shopping!,4.0,,"This street is shopping, you will fine many shopping malls and department stores at this street, and you could spend a long time visiting all. Also must of them have dining options at different prices ranges."
,,"Meh, too fancy pants",2.0,,If you like high end shopping for western brands like Prada then I guess you would enjoy Orchard Road... I enjoyed the air con inside the building but besides that I wouldn’t bother if you are on the hunt for a bargain!
,,"""Shopping Heaven""",5.0,,All holidays should have some shopping time and this is the famous road that has something for everyone. Having said that much of the shops are high end so looking is just the order of the day. having said that if you look hard enough you can stir pick up a bargain in the many smaller shops. I visited the Apple store on my last visit and after the purchase of an I pad Pro I was able to claim the tax back at the airport which was easy to do and gave a decent discount on the price I paid. Overall well with a visit....
,,Good high end shopping,4.0,,Some great high end shopping. If you're looking for cheaper items or souvenirs then this is not your spot and try Burgis instead
,,BUSY SHOPPING STREET,5.0,,"Lovely shopping street in the middle of Singapore. Tree lined, lots of malls. Only complaint is that in places it is hard to cross the road. Have to use under passes or lights. Cant just pop across the street."
,,can shop till you drop here,5.0,,"The Orchard Road is a great place to visit if you want to shop. It is designed for this activity. So many shops and places to eat, of course there are so many places to eat in Singapore."
,,Great area for shopping,4.0,,There are some spectacular modern shopping malls on this long stretch of road. Plenty of places to eat and drink along the way as well.
,,big shopping area and always crowded,5.0,,"hundreds of shops and malls with food, clothing etc for everone. Very poular are the malls with acres of shops, food courts etc. The metro stations are along the street and easy to take and probably the best and cheapest way around town. Also the malls, like Lucky mall, have lots of money changers, giving rates far better than the hotels or banks. Worth a visit but not for those who don't want to shop."
,,Every shop imaginable!,5.0,,"Busy, busy, busy. This street can be a bit daunting at first but it is well worth a visit. There's very expensive designer shops but also cheaper alternatives to suit every pocket. It's a great street to just wander up and down."
,,Singapore 2019 - Orchard,5.0,,"We stayed at Hotel Jen in Orchard which was exactly right for restaurants and shopping. If you have the time, oh and money too, Orchard is a place to find almost anything. There are many hotels on Orchard each with their own shopping mall attached. Orchard is worth a visit if only to experience the atmosphere. There is even a Hard Rock Cafe."
,,Nice,5.0,,I stayed on this road at the Hilton. Overall great place and many shops and restaurants to visit. Can get difficult at times to choose a restaurant but other than that very good.
,,Two different worlds across the road,3.0,,"don't know why everyone is so thrilled about this road. the only bright side was the icecream in rainbow bread. on one side of the road there are super expensive shops, with people sitting on stairs and street artists or magicians making a small show. on the other side of the road... well, we went into supermarket, and it felt like a different world. it was not completely clean it surprised me a lot that on the same road there could be such a different shops be located right across each other. There are tourist centers that you could visit, they might give you a clue about promotions on tourist attractions and etc..."
,,"Money, Money, Money!",4.0,,"This is the “high” end of town. So much to see. All the big names in fashion, retail, technology & food are here.
We loved just walking down the street enjoying the sights & sounds of the area. Like the whole of Singapore, it’s clean & beautifully maintained.
A must do for anyone coming to Singapore.."
,,Shopping & More Shopping,3.0,,"We visited just to see all the malls. Mall after mall after mall, I couldn't get over it. Most of the stores I couldn't even afford, but we stopped for some Ben & Jerry's ice cream on our walk around. It was cool to see in our spare time."
,,Shop til you drop !,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one long line of shopping malls. But you would not think it at first. You enter one shop and it just expands into a whole underground world of retail outlets and amazing places to eat. And the whole plus is that it is all air conditioned, so you ca leave the heat and humidity behind and just relax. Only your credit card is going to take the strain !"
,,Shoppers galore!,4.0,,"Singapore’s Fifth Avenue or Champs Elysses, numerous malls with high end shoppes and eateries. Clean with no loitering or beggars...safe at any hour!"
,,Shop and eat till you drop!,4.0,,"This is a straight flat road with shops and restaurents, banks, hotels food courts and cinemas. It is served by a few MRT station stops, and buses too. Plus the usual taxis. It is walkable on a cool day. You will hardly be bored as there are shops for everyone- from bridal shops to those selling books, children’s requirements, massage chairs, musical instruments, shoes, travelling items, etc. The large range of shops cater for different budget ranges - from Daiso selling $2.00 items to exclusive boutiques and watch shops. Many malls are linked by a pedestrian underpass walkway, but if it rains, you do need an umbrella to access the lower half of Orchard Road, and to cross traffic lights. There is much to delight your taste buds- from Japanese to Indonesian to CHINESE and local cuisine. There is a world class Mount Elizabeth hospital just off this road. Many tourists travel for medical consultations and treatment, and fit in retail and gastronomic therapy as well. Centrally located, you can get to other parts of Singapore easily from here."

As a local, this place is my haven. Usually on major holiday Seasons, sales discount will be everywhere and prices are sliced off and that’s when a lot of people go crazy about them. Whatever it is, for all those visitors, please do come at least once over here."

,,Early morning is best to avoid the crowds,4.0,,"We headed up to Orchard Road as we wanted to visit the Apple Shop. We arrived around 10:30am and found this a great time ...before the crowds arrived to shop the day away. The only gripe was that two of our group wanted to find the smoking zone but it proved elusive. I even tried to find it on google maps at the Apple store but was none the wiser.
Staff at the visitor centre are very helpful."
,,You can find anything designer!,4.0,,"I am not a big shopper, but i was looking for something specific that is a designer brand from Tokyo. Easily found it. Orchard Road is quite overwhelming as there are so many stores and malls. If you want to shop for nice things, this is the place."

,,great disappointment,2.0,,This is said to be a business hob of Singapore. There are many malls and shops of big labels in fashion world and glamour world. There is nothing to purchase for a middle class traveler
,,Incredible Shopping Venue,4.0,,The malls that line this boulevard are some of the best shoping designs that I've ever seen and I hate shopping. Incredibly attractive stores with lots of places to sit and eat or have a refreshing beer. Spent a Sunday here and really appreciated it.
,,to full and seen one mall have seen all,3.0,,very crowdy and watching one mall after each other with the same shops repeating. Go into one if you need to buy something and spend your time more usefull later by going somewhere else
,,"Tacky, outdated and sterile!",2.0,,Orchard Rd used to be the epicenter of discount goods...a must on any travelers radar. But post internet this place just sucks....why on earth would you go here unless you wanted a Parada handbag or a Gucci watch. Avoid.....
,,Shopping galore!,5.0,,"What a wonderful street, it feels like the luxurious and classy shops that line the sides are never ending! The busy hustle and bustle is also interrupted occasionally by street performers, who do things from magic to musical performances! Definitely a must visit."

,,Retail Therapy,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore would be complete without a visit to the Retail Therapy Mecca that is, Orchard Road. Just shown simply as Orchard on the SMRT maps. Excellent connections on the network. One of the few retail experiences not undertaken in air conditioned malls. You certainly knew that you where at the mercy of the Singapore heat and humidity! All of the big designer brands synonymous with capital cities that you would want or expect. As it’s Singapore, everywhere is so clean and tidy. Warning to smokers....Orchard Road has been made into a non smoking zone, from one end to the other. INSTANT fines apply if you are caught smoking!!!!
For personal comfort, the air conditioned underground shopping malls, to some, win hands down, but I do like the ‘traditional’ feel of a high street complete with its tiny bars and eateries."
,,"Busy Road, Fancy mall",5.0,,"if you are a foreigner and you are looking for a good spot for travel pict, just dont forget to visit Orchad Road. it's good both in the afternoon or night. but I prefer night because of the beautiful lights!"

,,Pretty cool,3.0,,"Lotsa shops but i only go there for food and orchard towers, you need like 3 days or more to see everything its a massive road, lots of walking which is fun, similar to the Grove of Los Angeles lotsa designer shops, defs worth a visit and spend all day walking up and down just havin a look and shop, come christmas time the streets are decorated and lit up at night"
,,Main shopping belg,4.0,,"This is the Main shopping belt of Singapore and no visits to Singapore is complete without walking down the famous street. All kinds of shopping malls, big and small can be found along this shopping belt. No wonder singapore is called a shopping paradise."
,,A maze of shops,4.0,,"All the brands you might possibly want can be found here. It is just a bit confusing to find your way around through the underground walkways.

It gets busy during peak hours on Orchard Road so if you want a quieter and smaller experience, the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a nicer alternative."

,,Shopper's paradise.,5.0,,"Skip the place if you have young children, unless you are local residents of Singapore, in which case you can choose to hang at Paragon mall and Tanglin mall.

For seniors, a quick zip through the road on the Hop off Hop on bus should do.

For the shoppers, be conscious that this road boasts of the biggest brands. Non negotiable. Lucky Plaza is the one mall where you will find anything remotely cheap. This is a place for the high flyers. Else just get on bus 7, and zip through the road. unlessssss it is Christmas time, where the decor on this road is an attraction in itself.

One point to note is ION Orchard. Uou spend $20 in the mall, you get a ticket to the top of the 54 storey building. Excellent view of Singapore."
,,"Lively, Trendy and lots of Brands",5.0,,"Orchard Street is a very happening street of Singapore and a superb place for shopaholics. One can get grt collections of known brands like Michael Kors, Armani, Chanel, Ralph Lauren.....the count is endless here. You can also find some Flea Shops inside Orchard Gateway where you can find some local stuff that are also very beautiful and unique. A must try for shopping"
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Our hotel was on Orchard Road so we spent quite a bit of time on Orchard Road.
If you like shopping then this is a shoppers paradise with wall to wall shopping malls and shops.
The shopping malls are huge and under the streets it’s like another city.
Most of the shops are high end designer shops but there are plenty of shops where you can pick up a bargain.
The streets, malls and shops are spotless clean, I’ve never seen a cleaner place on my travels.
There is a large section of Orchard Road that is a No Smoking Zone which is great if you’re a non smoker.
There is no shortage of cafes and restaurants on Orchard Road ranging from Michelin Star restaurants to street food.
There are a few MRT station too and most of the malls and hotels have car parks.
The edge of the road has fencing and bushes along the length of it separating the road from the pedestrian walkways which helps keeping the traffic noise down."
,,Shopping... shopping,4.0,,All high end brands what you could imagine ... beautiful place with lots of walking and good eating spots . Must see place
,,exciting,5.0,,"a lot of shopping malls in this street, very crowded in the everning, however it's peaceful in the morning (before 9 am)"
,,Orchard Road,3.0,,Of all the places in the world to shop this is not one of them. Over priced and poor service. Tangs was probably the worst. Iconic so really wanted to visit but I certainly wouldn’t recommend it.
,,If you are into high end shops....go!,3.0,,It is a place to go shopping and nothing else. only if you are into high end shops and do not know what to do with your money. Generally over priced items and no meaning at all.
,,Busy road,4.0,,A very busy road with lots of shopping centers and hotels. I walked from Paragon all the way to Scotts Square. The pedestrian walk was very clean and shady with lots of trees. You can see the busy traffic and also the modern shopping centers on both sides of the road.
,,Other name for Orchard is Luxury!,5.0,,"Beutiful shops and luxury malls, it is joy just to watch it. If you come from Europe or America, the same brands are much more expensive then back home!"
,,Still the place for shopping,5.0,,"Singapore basically revolves around this place... well.. for food and shops at the very least. Its is very alive, busy, and full of people most of the time. Most of the malls are interconnected thru their train lines underground. And starting january 2019.. the whole district or precint is mow smoke free."
,,Long road with shops! Lol,4.0,,Well that what it is. We started near the top one morning and walked the whole way down. Loads of huge shopping centres with a vast array of shops and nice eating areas. The Hilton and Yotel are situated on this road. Girls spent an hour in Zara for goodness sake. One of the shopping centres even had Marks and Spencers. Its a nice few hours walk to take in everything and we finished off stopping off in Raffles for a singapore sling
,,Everything,4.0,,"If you can't find it on Orchard Road, you won't find it anywhere. There are high end department stores. There are shops from France, Italy, USA, you name it, you'll find it on Orchard. One section has all of the upscale shops and department stores and as you go down the street the shops become less expensive"
,,Main area of Singapore,5.0,,"This is the showcase area of Singapore with luxury malls, food courts, products of every description and lots of air conditioning. Walk up one side of Ochard Road going in and out of malls and down the other. A good way to keep cool or dry on a rainy day as they are all interconnected."
,,"a lot of shopping, no culture",3.0,,If you feel the need to shop (a lot) in stores that you can mainly find at home (at least here in the US) than Orchard Road is where to go. Check out Emerald Hill Road for some great examples of Peranakan style houses/shops.
,,Amazing seeing the permanent progress!,4.0,,"It is a must visit street when in Singapore. When you do this for a long time you will notice the permanent change in new stores, restaurants, hotels and more.
The saying:IF WE ARE NOT FRESH -WE ARR OUT OF BUSINESS! Here it is reality.
The Orchard Road is in a permanent change of development. Luxury shopping centre more and more. All major world brands are present!
All ways a treat to walk, visit and last but not least to go shopping!"
,,Orchard Road is 2 miles long and visit ION tower,5.0,,"We were staying at the very good Orchard RendezvousHotel at the top end of Orchad road and not far away was the ION Tower. If you spent 20$$D in either shops or Food Court you were able to get the lift to the 4th floor were the Art gallery is and then another lift to the top to get some good views. You do not realise you are walking so far as there are lots of Malls attractions and eating places, go in these to cool off. Just near our hotel was the Black Angus Restaurant and at lunch time you can get 3 courses and drink for SSD20.90 plus service charge each. We had soup, fish and lots of chips plus coleslaw, then chocolate brownie or icecream, with refilable soft drinks. A very filling meal."
,,Great Place,5.0,,Had a great time there for shopping and eatery. Lovely place to roam around n good place to buy branded products and clothes.
,,One shop spot,5.0,,"Visited it on the Singapore tour bus are found it very picture friendly and the spot in Singapore where money can buy you what you wait, heaps of shopping centres and all the big name items can be found here. Orchard Road can be busy and the centres are nice and cool and you can wonder from one to another without having to go out in the Singapore humidity. Well worth a visit, don't forget your money"
,,Shopping Overload,5.0,,This road has the most shopping malls in one area I have ever seen in my life. I don't think there is anything you can't buy here. The area has a western shopping feel to it.

,,Great shopping,4.0,,"I'm sure this road gets longer every time I visit . Everything and anything can be found along this road . Hotels , fast food outlets ,fabulous restaurants ( didn't expect to find Jamie's ! ) and several shopping malls . We did get very confused by the underground crossings though and kept taking the wrong exit and ending up on the wrong side of the road . Take a map so you know the name of the road you need to exit on to as it gets very frustrating ."
,,a must visit,4.0,,Nothing extraordinary but its the heart of the SG retail so at least visit once. Almost all transport routes also pass there so accessibility is very easy.
,,The famous road in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard road is famous for shopping, window shopping, food or just walking on it.
A lot of hotels on it but usually more expensive due to location.
In the evening I could hear birds singing.
Sometimes birds make the sidewalks dirty by their waste.
As for me, I like the street ice cream on Orchard 's sidewalk and eating in basement of Paragon and Takashimaya."
,,People Watching,5.0,,"My husband and I went sight-seeing on Orchard Road this Sunday afternoon. The crowds were huge, due to it being a weekend.

If you like to shop you have fantastic choices from both ends of the markets here. It's a great place to meet up with friends even if you don't want to splash out you can certainly sit back to watch and enjoy it's very beautiful and lively atmosphere.
Orchard road is easy to get to using public transport. There are many good quality hotels close by. It's the perfect location if you only have a short stay in Singapore."
,,Neverending Shopping,5.0,,Mall after mall and department store after department store. If you like to shop then you will be able to spend hours/days here.
,,shopping mecca,4.0,,great just to walk around here and see the beautiful stores. but in the middle of the ones you can't afford you may find a massive market of affordable items. listen for the crazy birds in the trees sooo many of them. and don't be surprised with all the electric scooters zipping buy. but even with that all it's a worthwhile experience.
,,Always a favourite!,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore many times over the years, Orchard Road remains a favourite area to walk, exploring the shops. It has become much more upscale and with international brands and surprisingly fewer restaurants. We were there just after Valentine's Day and lots of decorations were up celebrating love!"
,,Business Western street,3.0,,"It's a busy road, full of upscale Western shops. I usually try to see things I can't find at home. However, I understand this is a shopping mecca for those who live in this part of Asia."
,,Where the action is,5.0,,"Be it fine dining, a leisurely brunch (Wild Honey is very popular with locals and tourists alike) or all manner of shopping, a visit to Singapore is never complete without taking in the Orchard district."
,,more for tourists destination,4.0,,"love the pedestrian along the buildings, access are friendly to everyone but i believe it should BAN any self motorised vehicles of any sort and BICYCLES. danger with kids and elderly around. applause for the no smoke policy along the road. access for underground at in front of tang mall helps alot to go across to ion mall."
,,Busy and bustling ...,5.0,,"Definitely a shoppers paradise . Worth going in the evening when you can also enjoy the busy traffic , lighting . We went during the Christmas and New year period and so the decorations and lighting was worth watching just like in London."
,,Solid shopping,4.0,,Anything you could want is available somewhere on Orchard road. Super high end or cheap travel souvenirs. Nice place to visit if you are in town but wouldn't recommend staying another day for.
,,Designer shopping,3.0,,This is the place to go if you have money to spend as it is full of designer shops. Otherwise don't bother - see if from a Hop On-Hop Off bus!
,,Nice 2.2 KM Street Dating Back To 1830's,3.0,,"Way back it had some charm and interest when it was THE place in Singapore but there is more to Singapore than Orchard Road with its many shopping malls and high rise. It was already a track or road back in the 1830's and surrounded by nutmeg, pepper and fruit plantations, hence its name."
,,Top end,3.0,,Mainly top end shopping and found you were trapped in a mall and was very hard to navigate to other places. My husband and son hated it and were constantly looking for an exit. Better shopping elsewhere.
,,Shop till you drop.,5.0,,"This is a long road full of malls over many levels, there is a restriction on smoking and only allowed in designated areas which means that the pavements are clean and you are not walking through smoke.
If you like shopping you could be there for days, all malls offer similar things to buy, and all offer food and drink.
Busy but great if you like shopping."
,,is that Paris or what?,3.0,,I wouldn't have expected that in Singapore the whole street will be covered with all high end shops. so expensive that you can buy those goods in Europe much cheaper
,,Like most shopping districts,3.0,,"I spent several hours walking around. The luxury stores are what you expect, however, don’t expect to find vending machines and some of the ATMs look shady. Crossing Scott Road ias an experience as the “underpass” does not directly connect the corners. So be careful or have extra time as you might find yourself back on the surface road a half a block from where where you already walked."
,,Central artery for posy shops,3.0,,"A bit like the Vegas strip, far to many 'top of the market' empty expensive 'fashion' retail etc. shops killing the life of the road. But much more besides including a few remaining great colonial period buildings. One drink can cost the same as a nice meal for two away from the strip."
,,Great Shopping Area!,5.0,,"It's a beautiful long street with a lot of malls and shops. We enjoyed strolling down the street. If you enjoy walking and shopping, this is the place to go."
,,Crowd street,5.0,,"First timelelee to visit here, i think is so crowd area. So many place for shopping and dining. One of the famous are lucky plaza, but dont ever buy electronic in here."
,,If you are a 'shopper' this is your heaven.,4.0,,"too much for a pathetic shopper like me, but i can see how this place excites the experts!

,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"This place is very busy, filled with so many people, there are so many malls, honestly so confusing to know where you are going and which mall to go to. There are big branded stores, Chanel, tag, LV, Pravda etc. Any big name store you will find it on orchard road. Takashimaya is the area you want to go close to for the branded stores. There are food courts everywhere. McDonald’s and KFC are halal certified. A lot of walking to do and very hot."
,,Highrise,4.0,,This is similar to any other large city in the world; filled with malls and expensive shopping experiences.
,,"Busy, bustling and frenetic",4.0,,Orchard Road in one of the prime arteries of the city and is home to just about every retailer/store/service from little one-man stalls to enormous malls. Care is required if you want to cross from one side of the road to the other and a strong recommendation is to make good use of either the traffic lights or the underpasses.
,,Shopper’s paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one of Singapore’s most dazzling shopping street with endless shopping and entertainment options. It is flanked by hotels, coffee chains, cafés and nightclubs. It spans almost 2.2 km and is considered every shopper’s paradise.

The Royal Thai Embassy Is also located on this street. On the western side of Orchard Road is the Botanic Gardens."

,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Singapores orchard road is one of the top shopping streets in asia and offers something for every kind of shopper - exclusive designer stores, quaint cafes and irresistible restaurants."
,,Take you wallet,3.0,,This is a must on one's stay to come and see this place. Orchard Road is an up market row of shops targeting the rich and well off - certainly no touristy shops here. large shopping centres on almost every corner supported by underground shops and food courts. A big issues that we found that it was hard to cross the street with pedestrian crossings hard to come by most are done via underground walk ways which can be confusing
,,Number one shopping street,5.0,,"This is a must on one's stay to come and see this place.Spanning almost 2.2 km, Orchard Road is a swanky, tree-lined one-way boulevard flanked by distinctive shopping malls and hotels.The shopping belt comprises nearly 800,000 sq m of shops and restaurants and promises to please any taste or budget with its iconic malls which boast the full works - from opulent brands to high street fashion, and from exclusive restaurants to fast food joints.It is a Great Street to shop, dine, stay, play, work, and live."
,,A lot of shopping,4.0,,"A lot of shopping, at prices that are not very special, not so cheap anymore for Europeans at least. Stroll along and whatch people, go inside a department store or galleria to cool of for a while."
,,A bit ho hum,3.0,,"Orchard road is now like one large airport shopping mall but possibly even more generic. Prices are the same or even higher than airport malls with maybe even less range or choice. Sadly distinctive local shops and brands have all buy disappeared. It’s a bit like going to a zoo where you only ever go to look, although at a zoo the animals that you cannot afford are at least diverse and interesting."
,,best shopping,5.0,,it is about 2 miles long but the best stores to browse in or to buy anything you want. I preferred the shops on Marina Bay Resort.
,,Great shopping ... not cheap,5.0,,"Good shopping .. but you have to go underground and see the maze of shops and restaurants under the city . Amazing. The metro is so easy to use and connects Orchard Road with the rest of the city. Foreigners can get a 1, 2 or 3 day metro pass at a good price ."
,,"As they say in the movies ""This place has everything!""",5.0,,"Whenever I travel to Singapore I always stay at the top end of Orchard Road. The Orchard Hotel is a favourite, so too, is the Royal Plaza on Scotts. There are so many restaurants, eating places, bars, clubs, pubs & coffee shops it would take all day to list. Everything for everyone - in some cases 24 hours a day. It is a safe, clean and easily accessible location for families with a staggering amount of shopping venues and choices. A lot of it is below ground, which is really cool and makes navigation a fun learning experience. It always looks stunning at night, with a virtual kaleidoscope of lights, colour and video screens. Even if you don't stay in the area it is worth a short taxi ride or MRT to Orchard station to see and experience."
,,Shoppers Avenue,5.0,,"I stayed on Orchard road and very glad I did, lots of shops from the low to the high, and lots of things to see. I walked the entire length of the road on a quiet night. So much fun"
,,Relies on it past to attract people,3.0,,This area used to be a fun place to visit to buy all your electrical goods at a reasonable price without having to go to either Holland Village or up to Transit Road in the north of the Island where prices might be less expensive. This has now changed with many malls either going down market or in the opposite direction to up market designer goods.
,,Amazing malls and hopping,5.0,,"Loved the beautiful ION mall with every designer across the board. Interestingly, depending on price and status was vital to stores location. Couture on street level, H&M two levels down."
,,Shopping mecca,4.0,,"The place to be for shopping - all kinds of stores from value to luxury. Many restaurants, good bus and subway service make it possible to easily move about without a car (it is actually better without a car - use taxis if necessary; they are clean and plentiful). Orchards Road has historically been a good area to live and there are good residential areas off it. Although very busy, this is a good place for window shopping up and down the street."
,,Singapore trip,4.0,,If you believe in brands then this is the place and you can find all the brands with nominal price tag
,,TOO Many Labels,3.0,,"How many LV, Gucci , Prada etc etc stores does one need ? They dominate in almost every mall along Orchard Road . It is as a result a very generic and average shopping experience. Avoid the malls unless there are sales on."
,,Lots of shops,4.0,,There are heaps of shopping centres in Orchard road. Be aware that one side of the road is cheaper than the other. One side has all the top label shops and the other the cheaper more affordable ones. Something for everyone here
,,Manhattan of Singapore,5.0,,"All the big names in fashion are here including Gucci, Prada etc. Apple also has a flagship store here and its one of the biggest shopping street in ASIA and expensive too."
,,Very Nice Area,4.0,,"Although the area was beautifully presented the shopping, food etc is very expensive. A place that you must go and have a look around but just resist spending the money."
,,Fun street with everything to have a great time,5.0,,"Amazing array of hotels,food options,shopping, entertainment....you name it.All kind of fun for all ages until late. Safe clean environment with transportation options and places to discover underground like for example Don Don Donki open 24 hours!"
,,Lots going on,4.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore’s main shopping street. It stretches from Tanglin Road at one end to past Plaza Singapora at the other, though most of the main shopping area is between Tanglin and Sommerset. With a couple of exceptions, stores and malls are generally high end but there are surprisingly affordable and good eating options in food courts and restaurants inside most malls. Orchard is usually busy, especially on Sundays when domestic workers have a day off, and there’s a lot to see and do along this single street."
,,Luxury shopping,5.0,,The best luxury shops on this road. Also coffe shops restaurants and shopping malls. I think this is the best place for staying in Singapore.
,,Very convenient and value add for shopping.,5.0,,It’s the place I almost can find everything I need for me also for my family. Wide range of brand and price in large of category. From top brand to mainstream items.
,,A good place for strolling and appreciating the architecture of Singapore,4.0,,"It's a very long street with a variety of shopping malls. I find it to be a great area to wander around and just take in the fascinating buildings and complex architectural designs of the city. There are lots of place to eat and shop, ranging from on-the-budget souvenirs to high-end brands.

If you're a tourist that is more into an action-packed adventure, this won't be much for you. However, if you just wanted to unwind, have a jog, and wanted to slow down and appreciate what Singapore has to offer, this might interest you."
,,Always a good shopping destination,4.0,,Always a good shopping destination. A visit to Orchard road is a must for anyone visiting Singapore.
,,"Grandiose, at its best!",5.0,,"A road. Just a road. But not just any other road. Orchard road is home to the best of the brands of the world. If you got deep pockets, Orchard Road provides opportunities to burn deeper holes in your pocket. Beautiful. Clean. No nonsense. Start walking along, you'll wish the road never ends."
,,shopping on steriods. not for the faint of heart,3.0,,"if you love window shopping, then go right ahead. walk and explore designer shoes, bags and other stuff. then end up at lucky plaza where you can find the cheapest souvenir. 36 keychains for 30SGD! warning, keep shopaholics away"
,,Spectacular shopping,4.0,,Every possible shopping opportunity here. Packed with tourists and locals Served by good bus and trains
,,Shopping heaven!,4.0,,"If you are a serious shopper then this is the street you must go. All the high fashion brands are here: LV, Prada, Fendi, Balenciaga, Off-White, Y3... you name it they have it. There is a lots of big shopping malls and great food courts around."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Great place to visit nice shopping malls air conditioning throughout the building coffee shops with in the place just a nice place to spend a few hours wandering through and window shopping
,,Shopping time,5.0,,If you planning to find souvenirs or to have shopping from the mall i recommended you to bring your bag with you and spend the day on the orchard street there is also small shops for foot massage and body massages
,,Streets of Boutiques and Shopping Centres,3.0,,"Orchard Road is the Street of boutiques and rich shopping centres, the main shopping street with food halls, restaurants etc."
,,Shopping at Orchard Road is fun!,4.0,,"There are many, many places to shop along Orchard Road which, arguably, is the most famous shopping strip in Singapore. However, I would highlight an area which I think serves the shopping needs for most especially for those who are time constrained. The area starts from the corner of Koek Road and Orchard. There are several shopping malls:
1. Orchard Plaza
2. Orchard Point/Centrepoint
3. Orchard Central
4. Orchard Gateway.
Between these four malls one can find:
a. Most famous brands including Zara, Desigual, Mango etc...
b. Cheaper goods can be found in Centrepoint.
c. All types of food as there are many food halls
d. Coffee can be has at several stations including Starbucks.
e. ATMs are located both along Orchard Road and with the Malls
For Chinese food, I would recommend Ding Tai Fung which is located on the first floor of Centrepoint. They prepare sumptuous Chinese Food."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Do not visit here with an empty wallet, nor can you expect it to be a quick visit. There are so many shops and outlets that you could be here for a week and not even scratch the surface. Something for everyone"
,,INTERESTING STREET TO WALK ALONG.,5.0,,"This z must see street when in Singapore. The street really gets going after 10am and stay open to 9pm. There are shops all the way along this street with plenty of restaurant's, eateries and coffee shops.
The prices we found were dearer than retail in Australia and we did not buy anything this visit. Even saying that it was a great time just walking around and pricing everything.
A Must See when in Singapore.
Better at nite than during daylight hours."
,,Shopping highway,5.0,,"Our hotel was practically atop Orchard Road, and it has every shop you could ask for. It’s where Eastern consumerism meets Western over-consumption. You’ll have the choice of everything from a giant M&S (UK) through to Japanese store Tokyu Hands. There’s also a near endless choice of restaurants, and a 7 Eleven store probably every 100 metres.

The area lacks an authentic traditional charm, but hey, you can get that elsewhere in this city. Even if shopping isn’t for you (and it isn’t for me), it’s worth passing though at night to see the dazzling lights and to try one of the bars or restaurants."
,,So many shops...,4.0,,"It's 'the' shopping Road in Singapore, to be honest it is a bit much ;-)
There are so many shoppingcenter, it's hard not to lose your orientation (what can be fun though). The main game is to find shops who are cheaper then all the designer-shops and they are there, you just have to find them. So if your wife likes shopping (like mine) you'll enjoy Orchard Road ;-)"
,,"Good shopping, and a very good food court!",4.0,,"Orchard Road was suggested by the front desk at my hotel as the place to take my lady shopping. It was easy to reach via the MRT, and it offered the ultimate shopping experience for my shop-loving woman. It offers everything from mid to high level stores with famous names known the world over. The food court is what impressed me, with many varieties of food for every taste at reasonable prices. The multi level malls on both sides of Orchard are very clean and comfortable, and provide a pleasant and satisfying shopping experience for everyone. Store locator maps are on every level near the escalators, making it fairly easy to find a particular store. Determining what level you are actually on can be more of a challenge, as I did not see any signage indicating this information."
,,"Shops, restaurants and more shops",4.0,,"Orchard Road is the ultimate shopping paradise where there is only room left for cafes and restaurants between the shops in the untold amount of shopping malls. Be prepared to discover that Singapore has a high standard of living, meaning that bargains will be elusive. Good news is that the whole Orchard Road area is designated as a non smoking area. Orchard Road is a must for the visitor to Singapore, even if you plan to buy nothing."
,,Wow. That's a lot of shops.,4.0,,"An enormous shopping district comprised of many shopping malls, many linked underground. It is very easy to get lost but don't let that put you off. The metro system is very easy to use and you are never too far from a station. Buy the oyster card equivalent for 12 dollars or something. It's super easy to top up although you probably won't need to to as the metro is very cheap to use, short journeys costing less than 2 dollars. A good map with all the malls marked is a big help and pick out beforehand if there are any particular shops you want to visit. It may seem a bit overwhelming, but many of the malls have the same shops so spend half a day then hop on a train and go to a market or similar!"
,,Excellent for shopping,4.0,,"Excellent for shopping, packed with hotels and malls on both sides. A very busy road. One can find almost anything here."
,,Shop and Drop,5.0,,"What a fun street to shop on. Walk down the wide sidewalks and beautiful foliage (unusual for a major street, but normal in Singapore). And then walk in and out of the major buildings, as all of them have malls with shopping and each has a food court.

All are nicely air-conditioned. My favorite is Takashimaya as it has an immense food hall with lots and lots of options. And you can see them make the food too. And its like being at a fair."
,,Shopping Galore,5.0,,"There is nothing you won't be able to find on Orchard Rd. Amazing shopping malls. From Gucci to souvenirs, you'll find everything you want on Orchard Rd."
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,"Every shop you can imagine and even some I never expected. There are US chain shops, restaurants and places for dessert as well as shopping. All the shopping seemed expensive."
,,Great shopping & eating,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a “must visit” whenever I go “home” to visit Mum.

It’s worth setting aside a day to wander all the shopping malls and anchor department stores - from the high end Takashimaya at Ngee Ann City to the low end Lucky Plaza and all those in between.

Tropical showers are no bother as almost every mall is connected via the basement tunnels radiating from the Orchard MRT station. No worries about food either as there are numerous eateries and food courts, again spanning low - middle - high for every budget and taste.

With the weak Aussie dollar, shopping is not as great as in yesteryear. However, the variety is good and there’s almost always a sale going on.

Something to note is that most shops open only from mid to late morning. However, they close late too - 9 pm usually. And yes, they are open every day of the week."
,,Great place to Shop,5.0,,There r some nice shopping malls. Can find everithing to buy in the surrounding. Great food courts as well.
,,What a great street!,5.0,,"We stayed at the Jen Orchard Gateway Hotel on Orchard Road. This street is a major shopping and restaurant area - very clean, safe with a variety of shops & high rise Shopping Malls. Wide tree-lined sidewalks."
,,Howard’s Visit,5.0,,"The best shopping in the Far East, all the high end shops you could muster but with higher end prices. Bond Street is cheaper for the same goods I. e. Todd shoes in the West End are £350 to £450, the same shoes in Singapore are £550 to £650. But fantastic window shopping and great when sales on."
,,SHOP TILL YOU DROP,4.0,,"I had heard so much about Orchard Road but I didn't get that it was the world's biggest gaggle of shopping centres. Wall to wall opulence to say the least, notwithstanding the fun and the must see Lucky Mall. I you just want to people watch and take photos of all the expensive stuff, that is cool. If you've won the lottery then you are set as there is no shortage of places to make the money disappear.
We drove through at night and Wow, what a difference. The place is just amazing and is well worth spending the time to see at night"
,,Retail Fix to last two days,4.0,,"(Disclaimer: i am resident in Singapore, hence the slightly different take on the area)

The Orchard shopping belt is to Singapore what Oxford Street is to London and Sydney. Once the haven of shoppers and tourists, the area has seen stiff competition emerge from e-commerce channels and online retailers. Nevertheless, the entire belt which stretches from the Wheelock place area till Plaza Singapura, still hosts a blend of Malls catering to various shoppers, eg for those looking for branded goods (iON, Paragon), Mixed tenanted Malls such as Wisma Atria, 313 Somerset, Centrepoint and Plaza Singapura.

A new retail concept featuring locally designed goods and merchandise has emerged in a place called Design Orchard, located midway in the Orchard Road belt, diagonally opposition the Mandarin Orchard hotel. It hosts local designers including autistic artists (if you are keen on seeing a fuller range, visit The Enabling Village located in Redhill, and a 10-15 walk from Redhill MRT station).

Orchard Road can’t be covered in one day, especially if you’re shopping with men or young teenage boys. Your best bet would be to first get a quick lay of the land to decide which Malls you want to spend more time in. Then drop the men or males at a location where they can play games in a cafe (just do a Google search for cafes that allow you to play board games and charge by the hour with coffee and drinks thrown in), or engage in indoor activities like The Escape Room (where they have to solve puzzles to escape from a series of trapped rooms) etc....that will allow to shop in peace and comfort for about 3 hours. Or just let them loose in a hardware or electrical goods store along Orchard Road

For those looking for more ethnic items, your best bet would be to explore Little India, Arab Street or the little alleys around Chinatown"
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"You’ll drop before you finish shopping here. Mall after mall shop after shop. Everything anyone could want all in one street and what a street it’s spotles no litter at all
A pleasure to walk down this street & window shop at the designer shops.
Plenty of bars & restaurants to choose from for when you need a little sustanence. Love Orchard Road."
,,Amazing area full of shops,5.0,,"If you are looking to waste some of your time and browsing around shops this is the right place where to go. Full of big brand’s shops, restaurants and hotels."
,,Shopping..and more shopping,4.0,,"Arguably one of the most famous shopping streets worldwide ! Great malls , a lot of coffee shops , beer bars and restaurants , all easily accessible by MTR (3 stations along Orchard Street )."
,,Expensive shopping street,3.0,,Designer and very expensive shopping street in Singapore. Very croweded. The street itself is very beautiful and it's nice to walk around.
,,Shopping steer,4.0,,This is shopping street in Singapore. Most of the shops are high end and very expensive. But again everything looks like high class.
,,Christmas visit,4.0,,"Visited this area just before Christmas. The Road was stunning, with all the decorations. A must visit if you enjoy shopping."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"Everthing from high end designer ware to cheap & cheerful souvenirs are available in the various Malls in Orchard Road. For an authentic cheap dining experience, try the many different concessions in the food courts located in the basement of the many Malls."
,,crowded,3.0,,"it is nice to stop by here when visiting Singapore to see where the high end shopping is, however i recommend not going on a weekend after 6pm because it can be so crowded that you can't even walk down the street!"
,,AMAZING non stop views and shopping,5.0,,Our hotel was on ORCHARD Road..so walking from it to most landmarks has been easy. You can eat anything on this long road in the heart of the city or buy anything your heart desires. Easy access to several MRT stations.
,,Shoppers paradise,3.0,,Broad range of shopping experiences available. Many 'up-market' shops. A great way to spend an afternoon and evening.
,,Champ Elysees of Singapore,3.0,,An avenue with big shopping centres filled with luxury brands to cater to every whim and fancy of the well to dos.
,,The best during Christmas,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the best during evenings with all the lights but it's even better during Christmas. Singaporeans put on the best Christmas show, the shops and shopping centres are beautifully decorated."
,,Hustle and Bustle,4.0,,"If you like crowds and big shops this is the place for you. You will find pretty much any upscale shop that you can think of, located on Orchard Road. It's fun to browse, shop or just people watch here."
,,Ideal situation for shoppers and sightseeing,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the place to be for shopping of every kind. No matter what your budget there's something for everyone. There are large Malls and smaller department stores, plenty of food outlets providing food from around the world. In one of the Malls there's even a Marks and Spencer's for those looking for something ""from home"". Orchard Road is also the road you'll walk along to reach the famous Raffles Hotel. This road is also on the main bus route, and the buses are clean, and I believe the best way to travel around and see the sights, but make sure you have plenty of change as the driver will only accept the EXACT money for your journey. Lots of Hotels on Orchard Road too, so you should be able to locate yourself here if you want to. Enjoy!"
,,Behold the Shoppers!,4.0,,"A must go place for shoppers. No need to debate the malls. Most of the malls offer brands in lots of shopping interests. However, if you are a solo traveler and not much into shopping, I do not recommend it. Although there is one place called Plaza Singapura which is more appealing to the traditional non-luxurious shopper. There are decent eating places in the mall too."
,,Not cheap,2.0,,"I thought, given that we were in Asia, the clothes would be cheap. Forget that, it’s a very expensive place to shop if you are a foreign tourist. Plus no character whatsoever."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Spend full 10hours shopping in the Orchard Rd area.....By far the best shopping in Singapore with every designer you can imagine and one after another...From street walk shops to big malls, it has it all...Definetley worth a visit if you like shopping...And sum great restaurants & eateries also"
,,"shops,shops,shops",4.0,,"If you like shopping this is the place. One shopping centre after another , often featuring the same top end brands. There are some mid range and local shops , but you need to like your shopping to see the lot"
,,2nd BEST PLACE TO BE WHEN IN SINGAPORE,5.0,,"ONE of the most happening, full of Tourists and locals, a number of Malls, elegant shops of everything. you think you see you enjoy.A number of Hotels on this road.
very decorated and lighted area at night.
Round up your visit with ICE CREAM from the famous stall near Mandrin Orchard..( For videos of the place see my channel @ Dr Ashok Gupta on YouTube)"
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Amazing & shops galore, but bring your money with you. We found Singapore very expensive. Cabs were reasonable though"
,,Shopping in Orchard Road,1.0,,Over priced as e-shopping makes it so convenient. Go Orchard Road for a gathering in any of their restaurants but forget shopping.
,,Varied Shopping For All,4.0,,"For those who are looking for something new, trendy, or traditional, shopping here should be a destination for a day or half day. It is located a bit far from the Sun Tec area near Raffles, but we had a HopOn HopOff pass, so we used that. Mywife found a nice purse at at an upscale store which had colors/styles that she had seen in the States."
,,Love Orchard Road,5.0,,"I truly love Orchard Road. Amazing large 30+ shopping centres, excellent restaurants. Ion shopping centre is amazing. Highly recommend"
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"Even if you can't afford a Gucci handbag, just to go and feast your eyes at all the beautiful things makes a trip down to Orchard Road worth it."
,,Has not been here for so many years and it is still a great place to shop!,5.0,,"This trip we spend 3 days only in orchard road, just like 30 years ago where there is only one tourist area in Singapore : ORCHARD RD. The previous trip - as usual - I travel to multiple areas like novena, bugis, sentosa, marina bay, sentosa. But this trip only at orchard road. Surprisingly this road has everything everything and everything... branded store, toy store, japanese snack stall, garrett popcorn, smiggle, irvin salted egg, food court with playground, cosmetic shop, book store, etc etc."
,,Amazing Shopping,5.0,,"Spent a day shopping on Orchard Road and most of that in the ION mall. Every designer shop you can think of must be on that road. It has its own MRT station at Orchard, not much more to say but great shopping."
,,Interesting road but not to relax.,4.0,,"Orchard Road is worth to visit but in my opinion too many tourists. Singapore is a very clean but expensive and over-organized City. Nevertheless, worth to visit but one ne visit is enough!"
,,The shopping heart of Singapore,5.0,,"This street is a shopaholics delight. Be aware that there is more underground than above it, so the street level is just scratching the surface of the offerings. All the iconic brands are represented and many brands are represented and repeated in the different buildings. There is easy access to the metro via the Somerset and Orchard stations, and the underground subways are the most convenient and safest way to cross the streets. Lots of great cafes, restaurants and bars along the length of the street. It is easy to beat the heat by walking between each building underground. The Christmas displays and lights are magical, if you are visiting in December."
,,Singapore Sizzles,5.0,,What an interesting city. Shoppers paradise for high end shopping but for me I just enjoyed the atmosphere and picking up the odd bargain
,,Crazy Shopping,3.0,,"If you wanna shop, this is the best place in Singapore. There are countless stores. -it wasn't for me though so I just walked the street.-"
,,overpriced overrated,3.0,,I don't know why people come to Singapore for the shopping - it's overpriced and overrated. Walking along Orchard Road you'll soon wish for an air conditioned mall.
,,Shopping on steroids,5.0,,"Wow, great shopping facilities, shop to you literally drop, while some prices are high when they are on sale they are a bargain."
,,Vacation,4.0,,"Loved this street, anything your looking for you could find it here. One thing though, if you want Luxury goods like Gucci, Louis Vuitton ect, it's cheaper in London & US. We did the convert and it was much more for the items. We still got nice gifts. Lots of restaurants also along the way and snacks"
,,Favourite Street,5.0,,This has to be my favourite street in Singapore. Always buzzing with people and the malls and the cafes. I love it.
,,Overrated and Overpriced,3.0,,"I'd only go to Orchard Road to be able to say 'I've been there' but unless you so much money that you don't care how much anything costs (a seemingly common characteristic of many shoppers there), I wouldn't recommend buying anything here."
,,Don’t Bother,1.0,,Crowded overpriced high end shopping yuk. There are lots of better cheaper places to go. My wife was keen to go but thankfully quickly changed her mind. It probably didn’t help as was during Chinese New Year so heaps tourists
,,Luxury goods,4.0,,Lovely shopping centers abound. I was not interested in bringing home goods that can be found in USA though.
,,Chinese New Year,3.0,,Quite a few restaurants were packed with travellers celebrating Chinese New Year - so the wait time was extremely long ! If you were after other cuisine and shopping then youhad no hope for 48 hours
,,Orchard Overdose,4.0,,"If you like luxury goods then Orchard Road is heaven. If your price range is somewhere south of LV and C then don't despair. Try Tangs, ION, Wheelock Place or wander over to Takashimaya. There are a host of other options as well. If you want retail therapy this is the place. Just don't expect too many bargains that's all. P.S. wear a pair of good walking shoes."
,,I wouldnt bother same old designer shops as in every city,1.0,,i really would not bother its just the same old overpriced designer shops selling the same old designer junk that are in every major city in world. If you want to shop in singapore Bugis junction or Bugis markets is the place to go.
,,The Heart of Singapore- & History,5.0,,"Why is it called Orchard Road? In the 19th c it was the location of many orchards-- including Fruits, Nutmeg and pepper! One of the major ""Orchard owners"" was also named ""Mr. Orchard"". The road was being created by 1830- 189 years ago! Now it is a 2 km, tree lined road, in the centre of Singapore, with many Hotels nearby as well as lots of malls and places for shopping.- over 9 million square feet! There are places which will satisfy shoppers with every type of ""budget""! It can also be readily reached by ""Public Transport"". TripAdvisor has bestowed on ""Orchard Road"" it coveted ""Certificate of Excellence""

I hope that this Review has been helpful.."
,,nice shopping experience,4.0,,good to spend your spare times and I visited the apple store. But it was closed due to Chinese Lunar New Year
,,Break in Singapore,4.0,,Very busy tryin* to cross the road manic. But for me too far to Walk . Should have got what I wanted at the gardens by the bay .
,,Amazing everything,4.0,,"Love this Main Street - has everything from designer cloths to no name brands to upmarket camera gear. Both sides are buzzing with life and shopping. Tricky to cross but there are many underground crossings that allows you hop across the street. The street to be if you require high end camera gear / electronics and food
A anchor street in Singapore"
,,Shop Shop Shop,3.0,,"There's not much to offer around here, unless you're the type who likes to shop till drop. They have a really wide range of stores around here. Mention the brand and you'll find it along this road. But other than that, nothing much to see."
,,Designers and big labels - but no deals,3.0,,"Coming from the UK, there are no deals to be had here - alot of malls and department stores mostly selling the same products."
,,Christmas lighting and shopping,5.0,,If you dont like crowds this isn't for you. Christmas lightings stretches for kilometres so you will have lots of chances to take photos. Very crowded as usual but the humidity is quite challenging. Depends which part of Orchard you are at but i feel the main highlights are mainly located around Takashimaya shopping centre. Those with strollers and toddlers are going to struggle as it is quite a squeeze. Nevertheless it is a good experience not to be missed. Great atmosphere regardless.
,,Orchard,4.0,,Very busy during the weekend and exhausting with all the crowd. Would recommend to visit during the weekdays while locals are working.
,,Shop,5.0,,Shop and eat. I'm wide eyed with a array and variety! The wide wide walkways of Orchard Road is fantastic!
,,Shop shop shop,4.0,,"We only spent around an hour on orchard road for shopping but you could easily spend all day,the malls are air conditioned so that’s the main reason we went in.Each mall seems to specialise in different items,but to be honest Singapore mall had everything we wanted and you can enter it straight from the mrt station."
,,You need a map to cross the street via under pass,4.0,,"Replete with every manner of shopping above and below ground as well as street level its frenetic. You can buy almost anything, but for a visitor, if you had to find a store in many of the under ground shopping levels, you might not be able to do it without a local person to serve as a guide. There is no safe street crossing at the heart of the shopping area. That being said, you can find everything from a Chanel or Hermes shop to a Starbucks or a twenty minute prescription eyeglass shop."
,,Tourist area,5.0,,"Tourist area for shopping and restaurants. We were struck by how clean and beautiful it is. Transformed from a fruit orchard and plantation, you will find Tangs, one of the oldest department stores.."
,,Week ends are v busy,3.0,,Great shopping from HM to Hermes and Apple. Very walkable and can be walked under ground as well. Dont forget to go to B1 and B2 for even better cheaper shops and passage to each sides of the road
,,Shopping,5.0,,Food and shopping. That's what orchard road is about. Start from one end and just shopped till the end of the road. One day is enough.
,,Great shopping area,5.0,,Lovely tree lined boulevard with tremendous shopping and lots of eateries and bars. Great atmosphere at night
,,WOW!!,4.0,,"We enjoyed the sights, sounds and smells of the delious food stalls. It was busy with lots of shops and stalls to buy some very beatuful souvenirs."
,,Shoppers and foodie paradise,4.0,,"With Tangs, Takashimaya, Lucky Plaza and many restaurants along Orchard Road you really don’t need to go anywhere else in Singapore."
,,Busy shopping precinct,4.0,,"You can't go to Singapore without walking along Orchard Road, it has everything, it has every shop you could wish for, prices are good, service is efficient and lots of places to eat."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"It is a must place for the shopaholics as it has all the high-end brands and pretty much anything that anybody would want to shop for... even if you’re not interested in shopping just strolling around and trying their local style ice cream is so much fun!

There is something or the other interesting going on... either magic shows or music shows which are quiet entertaining. Just sit back on the roadside stairs and enjoy :)

Overall it is not to be missed, be it shopping or just walking! It’s the Oxford street of Singapore."
,,All the exclusive brands are there. Worth visiting,4.0,,All exusove shops are there. Very nice road to walk both at day and at night. There also many shops which is under the street level. All many food markets that worth visiting.
,,One of the most famous places in Singapore for high end Shopping !,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the most famous areas in Singapore and worldwide for tourists to do some high end shopping. There are several luxury malls and other boutiques on this road which is about 2-3 kms long. The best part is that there are always people here enjoying the place and soaking in the local culture. The place was very nicely decked up when we visited during Christmas. If not actual shopping, one must go to atleast feel the place and do some window shopping."
,,Great if you like designer shopping,4.0,,"Some fantastic malls and shops.
Endless string of posh places selling great stuff at an astronomical price.
If you like to shop go for it.
Only word of warning is don’t try and get a cab off the rank you will be there for hours.
Either use the taxi booking app or
even better get the MRT it is cheap and really good"
,,Lots of high end stores,4.0,,"Orchard road has all the designer stores you can imagine. If you are in a budget some of the stores may not be suitable. There is an area that has low end souvenir, T-shirt on the opposite side of tang Center. I found the stuff to be very low quality. The mtr level has miles of shops below ground. You can find some good bargains there"
,,shop shop shop till you drop,5.0,,Everything that you need can be found here. wonderful place to shop and dine. i been to many countries theres nothing like it. Shopping malls after shopping malls after shopping malls.. lovely to spend 2 days here

,,A shoppers paradise with malls to get lost in.,4.0,,Orchard road is verry pretty unlike other mayor city roads. Lots of greenery to beutify the city. Most street a re crossed by entering a mall and then finding a exit to your preferred street. Must admit this was a nightmare as we got hopelesly lost and wasted a lot of precious time.
,,No Smoking Starting Jan 2019,4.0,,Orchard law is no smoking on the whole stretch effective Jan 2019. Good Luck Smokers! Lively and nice to walk in Good Weather.

,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"This is a shopping paradise,well it is for my wife,3 handbags and a pair off shoes in 15 mins,that gust one shop,this has got to be the best shopping street in the world."
,,Fun place even if you are not an avid shopper,4.0,,We were staying in the Mandarin which is at the 'top' end and wandered around here several nights after dinner - lots to see and do - plenty of shops of course and not all Brand names either - some bargain basement outlets in the numerous malls - plenty of fancy restaurants but again if you look some good value food courts - there was a Disney theme over Christmas and New Year with sidewalk 'displays' for a unique picture experience - off this road is the preserved Peranakan enclave of Emerald Hill - if you are coming from elsewhere take the MRT to Somerset.
,,Evening Place,3.0,,I visited here in the afternoon. Guess its more lively in the evenings. The malls are huge and you can find the best brands. Lots of deals. Not a place for people who cant walk. The underpass to go to the other side of the road from Takashimaya to Lucky Plaza is a good thought. But will be better with escalators.
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"This is the place for all avid shoppers, Orchard Road is well know for its shopping with plenty of malls and shops to enjoy and bargains galore. Orchard Road also has plenty of food offerings and is very clean and safe. Singapore's public Transport system makes it very easy to get around in a very safe environment.

Came here during Christmas because they have nice decoration there, lights in the street and Christmas decor everywhere mostly in front of shopping mall. But be aware that it will be very crowded during peak season, especially in afternoon till night"
,,It grows on you,4.0,,"Living in Singapore orchard street is always out there , the mecca of shopping and entertainment. However the place can feel a bit crowded and over commercialised at times . However multiple visits and different hours shows up new sides of the street. Great place for people watching and soaking in the unique energy of Singapore. Amazing vibe during the dec festive season !"
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"The main shopping street. Not a conventional high street as it is all shopping centers and very few stores you can see on the street. Many connect under ground. Due to this it’s not so easy getting around the malls themselves. The floors and entrances are not that easy to understand, a bit like a maze. There are directories within that can help some what.
Really enjoyed the ice cream
Vendors on the street that sell ice cream bricks in a piece of colorful bread."
,,So many shops,5.0,,So many shopping centres all together along this stretch of road. Great for window shopping or grab a light lunch at Providore. Great tea and sandwiches.
,,Shopping Hub,4.0,,"Shopping hub of Singapore! You'll find all big brands are located there. Easy commute via MRT or buses. Get down at Orchard or Someset MRT, depending on which mall/place you're going. Lots of eateries around with plenty of options available for everyone. This place gets completely transformed during Christmas/New Year with the decorations all over"

,,A well known and popular area,4.0,,We planned to walk here from Chinatown but it was complicated and no sidewalks the entire way. We liked orchard road a lot and it’s worth visiting.
,,"Shopping, shopping",4.0,,"Orchard is the shopping capital of Singapore. High end and branded clothing. Just walking along Orchard road you can lots of people, tourists, shoppers, dining, street art performances, souvenir shops and a lot more. Better watch out with your spending here."
,,I prefer strolling at night.,5.0,,"Orchard Road undoubtedly houses some of the best shopping in Asia and a fun to be place because of the wide sidewalks and giant shaded trees on both sides of the road. There seems to always have street entertainers every 200 feet to add a lot of color to ordinary 'walking one place to the next'. Due to the heat and humidity, visitors tend to go into the mega shopping complexes lined both sides of the street - and stay there rightfully to browse all the things they don't have back home. Once the sun sets around 6:30PM, the night lights draw people out like moths to a lamp. The streets come to a certain vibrancy unlike elsewhere in the world. This Dec (2018) I did missed the lights in the 80-100 tropical trees that lined the streets. Somehow Disney displays dictated a different mood and decorating style."
,,Shopping Hub,4.0,,Good place for expensive shopping at singapore. Most crowded place in singapore i think. Also the night life area for Singapore.
,,Place of luxurius brand,4.0,,"Orchard road known as luxurious shopping district in Singapore. Lots of high end brands have their flagship store around the street. If tou want to splurge yourself, this is the perfect location. Go shops till you drops.
But if you dont want to (like me), after window shoppings, i sit near takashimaya and enjoy 1 dollar ice cream sold by uncle. Dont forget to get your best pose in front of luxurius store and posted in your IG ahahaha."
,,Christmas lights,5.0,,Beautiful and dreamy lights! Not only light but also Disney princess monuments are great. There was a long line for each to take pictures.

,,Must visit place for shopping,5.0,,This is the place to be seen for shopping. The whole street are mainly hotels and shopping malls. Orchard road are very accessible and can be reach by MRT train.
,,Less exciting with each new Mall,3.0,,"Decades ago Orchard Road was an interesting place to visit especially when it had a good collection of shops that sold antiques and arts and crafts from around Asia.

Now if you were taken blindfold into any of its malls and asked to guess where you are when the blindfold was removed, I doubt you would even know you were in Asia, let alone Singapore.

But if your intention was to fly halfway around the world to experience McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Coffee Bean and shops selling YSL, Channel, Cartier, etc. then you will love it."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Easy street to walk along, popping in and out of the different malls as you go. Everything you expect to find is here. Do bear in mind that the whole road is non smoking (anywhere!)"
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,We visited here after the Botanic gardens. Huge shopping mall with every brand you could think of. I know it’s world famous but I thought the shopping experience was better in Marina bay mall
,,Amazing shopping experience,5.0,,"Entire stretch of road with all possible brands for clothing, electronic, food, children amusement centre and wat not. We went during Christmas & it was beautiful with streets filled with colourful lights, road shows on, jingle bells music etc. Takashimaya is Singapore's largest shopping centre and is situated there."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,This is definitely one place for the ladies. With every top shop around. Every block seems to have a massive shopping centre. Husbands who hate shopping should maybe sit around Clarke quay instead and enjoy the relaxed pace of the quay. Be warned though that Singapore is quite an expensive city for eating and drinking unless you use the hawker centres.
,,Just Walk and Walk,5.0,,Shopping shopping shopping.... you can see everything on this Road.... from High end shops to low budget shops.... I love the Street ice cream!!!
,,Shopping District,4.0,,This is a shopping area with all the main shops and designer brands. Very buzy and happening area.. Most malls are connected underground as well In fact the underground metro system connects with malls and exits. Very hard to resist shopping in this area.
,,shop till you drop,5.0,,we were there christmas time so the streets were lit up like Disneyland fairytale. Spectacular. sooo much shopping and eating places. lots of desinger high brand shops
,,Mostly high-end shops,4.0,,Lots of high end shops in this area. If you're looking for branded clothing and fragrances this is the right place for you. There are also nice Christmas decors at night during our visit. Disney themed displays.
,,A large and neat road in Singapore,4.0,,"A very wide road in Singapore. Along this road, you can find various shopping places and famous malls. The mall in this place is not only wide but also provides various products with international standards. We visited this place on New Year's Eve 2019"
,,Shoppers paradise!,5.0,,You can shop to your hearts delight. Every possible shop you could desire from high end designer to very cheap.
,,You like shopping - go there!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the ""High Street"" of Singapore with many attractive shopping malls that offer almost everything. The buildings are interesting, the street and the malls are very clean, most people are friendly and more or less easy going.
But all shops are opened on Sundays and holidays - good or not so good?"
,,Walking around,4.0,,"Looking around for shopping. You can find both branded /expensive and also affordable item. ""lucky plaza"" is one affordable. Many bars for lonely travellers/workers 😜"
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,"Orchid Road has such a variety of shopping centres for all tastes, some very expensive places and some cheaper. It is always a delight to wander down Orchid Road, especially at Christmas time with all the very colourful decorations."
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"Branded goods like coach, LV, Prada and all other international brands can be found in this road. Big shopping malls.
Lots of high end dining from Japanese food, Korean, western, chi sea and many more. For sure you can get all kind of food too but high end dining. Good news if you are on budget, then go for food courts (price around fast food) but need to queue up during peak hours like lunch time 11+am to 1pm and dinner time 6pm-8pm for weekdays. If weekends and public holidays, crowd is no joke likely need to queue for table and food.

If you not into branded goods, then hopefully you are visiting during festive seasons like Christmas period, nice decors everywhere around the road and shopping malls.

Good news for non-smokers, new rules on smoking zones, so hopefully you get even fresher air."
,,If you love shopping?,5.0,,Like I said if you love shopping then that’s the place to be also great restaurants and if you are visiting Singapore it’s a must to go just to see even if you don’t buy anything
,,Beautiful at christmas,4.0,,Stayed at the Hilton in Orchard Rd. Being Christmas the street was full of beautiful decorations. This is a great area if you want to spends hours and hours shopping but it's pretty difficult to find everyday clothes a reasonable prices.
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",4.0,,Wow I have never seem so many shops. I can't believe they can all make money. People must REALLY love shopping here. My daughter loved it. I did find it a bit hard to navigate the labyrinth of shoppiong centres. You want to come out at the right place as many raod intersections don't have pedestrian crossings. You are expected to find the right underpass or bridge through the various shopping centres.
,,Most crowded Road of Singapore,4.0,,Orchard Road is most crowded Road of Singapore where every big shopping malls and all 5 star hotels are available. It is central place in Singapore. Most expensive shopping outlets of all multinational brands are available. All types of transport are available round the clock.

4) one should try Ice cream sandwich ,(find anywhere at Orchard Road) ,

Cons :

1) Too much crowded ,

2) 95% luxury shopping, except few shops ,"
,,Awesome place,4.0,,Have been here before some years ago and still very inpressee with the quality of Shopping and Malls
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Lots of shops, restaurants and malls, all clean and safe. Orchard road is a smoke free zone, with limited designated no smoking areas. Lively atmosphere, even if you don't buy, it's nice to see"
,,High living and luxury,5.0,,"This is one of the luxurious location in Singapore with all-in-one facilities from anything to everything. The street offers many tall-towers and shopping mall with number on international brands shopping but also very expensive. The street has number of small to big restaurants, bar, coffee shops and food courts offering different local and international food and drinks. Walking along the street in the evening/night is truly mesmerizing with beautiful and colorful lighting around. A must recommended place to visit even if not planning to do any expensive shopping. Yet there are cheaper options for local shopping ($ shops) and enjoying street food and drink."
,,Shopping malls galore,5.0,,"I used to come here quite often when I was younger as I am from just across the causeway. But over the years this road has changed a lot. It used to be very affordable shopping here, but now the road is deck with plenty of upmarket designer brands that it has lost my attraction. For those who can afford it this road is a haven for you. Brands from Gucci to Miu Miu and the likes in a few malls. This road has a lot of malls having the same designer brands.....so if you decided later to buy something from a brand all you to do is go in the next mall. I am sure there will be another branch there. The last time I came here was just before Christmas. There were quite good discounts but the crowd was pure madness. I suggest if you want to come here, use the MRT during festive season or weekends. If you intend to use Grab.... forget it. Parking is also expensive around here. Unless you want to park quite a distance away and walk to this road. All in all, if you haven't come here before please do at least once. (great for people watching at least)"
,,Shopping and Hotels,3.0,,"Wide sidewalks for strolling between buildings. People watching is great, but they are mostly tourists and not a reflection of the local people. Many steps and curbs to manage."
,,Disney Magical Moments,4.0,,We love Disney! And we were so glad Orchard Road brings Disney vibes to Singapore. We went there at night so the photos are a bit dark.
,,A haven for luxury shopping & people watching,4.0,,"I often stay at hotels on Orchard Road, as it is my favourite street for shopping, getting updated on the latest fashions and trends, people watching from dusk, cafés, eateries and bars along Orhard Road and nearby side streets, and more."
,,Holiday Mania,3.0,,"Skip the area during the holiday shopping season, was a beast to get around and get things done. Getting a Grab out of the area was almost impossible."
,,Not what it was,3.0,,"I used to love Orchard Road for the variety of shops you couldn’t find in Europe or Australia and the great prices. However now it seems those days are gone.

Yes there are lots of malls and still some big Asian department stores you won’t find elsewhere, but the shops inside have become very homogeneous - and expensive!

How many Chanel / Ferragamo / Gucci shops do you need on one street? It’s very boring to see the same high end, international designers over and over again.

Maybe this is your dream if you’ve got millions of $$$ to spend, but for us more ‘normal’ people, there’s little pleasure to be had here when you can’t afford anything.

The best thing about Orchard Road now are the underground hawker centres for a good, cheap lunch. Enjoy and move on."
,,Mall extraveganza,3.0,,Pretty busy with regional tourists and shoppers all taking photos of displays and store fronts. Lots of high-end luxury shops and crowds to comb your way through.
,,Nice,4.0,,We had our hotel on Orchard. Safe area with lots of shops and restaurants open late/ around the clock. I enjoyed my stay. Easily accessed by underground. If I cane back to Singapore I would not mind staying there again.
,,very nice to walk up and down,4.0,,"Went at night and they had a disney theme happening, with all these mickey mouse lanterns, looked great,"
,,Shops galore!,5.0,,Great shopping all along Orchard. ION center is worth visiting if you have time to explore the underground shops. Walking shoes required!
,,"Malls, malls, malls and malls",5.0,,"If you want to be amaze for the amount of malls in this country you have to go to this street. It is Mall after Mall and not just regular brands you will find the most luxurious stores you could ever imagine.
If you love shopping.. man I feel bad you and your wallet."
,,A must visit road,4.0,,"Orchard road is the prime shopping street in Singapore, It starches from Istana, (The President's residence) to Tanglin Mall. All major shopping malls and departmental store are located here. What ever is your need, All major brands from world over are available. Tailors, money changers, food plazas, fashion goods, Electronics, Toys, watches, jewelry, shoes,... the list is endless. There are very expensive stores and also there are two dollar shops. Tourist information center is also there. A must visit place in Singapore."
,,So much shopping!,5.0,,"Orchard street was a 15 minute walk from our hotel at Bencoolen Street.
The shopping centres in Orchard street are amazing.
So many shops to look at for all age groups and price tags.
Looking for Cartier, Gucci, Rolex or Prada they are here.
If this is out of your price range like me, then there are other shops like H&M, Zara or gadget shops for the lower end shopper.
I must say, there is not a lot of places to just sit down and take a load off your feet for 5 minutes so take your walking shoes, and have lunch early if you can before 12, as it’s very hard to find a seat for lunch between 12 to 1pm.
Excellent experience.
Ps
If you want to change money, Lucky Plaza is a better option.
There is 6 or more outlets to exchange to Singapore Dollars.
Worth the walk as there was a 5 cent per dollar difference between outlets, shop about!"
,,Shopping,5.0,,Great place to shop many international brands top stores browse mall shops fully air conditioned staff are friendly an helpful
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Shopping belt of Singapore 🇸🇬 Tangs, Robinsons, Isetan, Cinema - Shaws @ Shaw House - entertainment & restaurant & shopping. Cinema - Golden Village In Plaza Singapura; shops & restaurants. Cinema - Cathay - Orchard Road & Dhoby Ghaut."
,,shopping street,4.0,,Loads of high end and high street stores a great area to spend the afternoon shopping. Lots of food centers in this area too
,,Not Rodeo Drive,3.0,,"Plenty of expensive brands , but the sadly the merchandise they bring in is nothing special if you are just a walk in customer, if you are a regular on their list of VIPs then perhaps you get to view and buy a different range , but then why not head over to Europe ? Store design is conventional - even the windows are boring. There are far more interesting nooks and crannies to shop at in Singapore . If you hve never been to a big city with malls , then Orchard road will impress you ."
,,Singapore's shopping street,4.0,,"You got all the shops that you will find in any big city. Innumerable malls with pretty good restaurants and food courts. Overall very clean, always something special going on. So nice atmosphere due to some unique architecture."
,,Crazy Rich Asians Shopping Belt,4.0,,"If you want to get the stuff crazy rich asians get, then this is the place for it. Apart from that, nothing much interesting. Better to head to the burbs for better food and shopping."
,,Very happening Street of Singapore,4.0,,"Good for shopping as Mall offer to all types of shoppers, from budget to luxury. Ion Orchard, Westaria, Lucky Plaza are few best malls, other than that you can just have a walk around sit and relax"
,,Abysmal Christmas lights,1.0,,"Obviously thrown up for the cheapest option , as seems normal these days on Orchard Road. Each section of road in a single colour, no twinkling no sparkling. A dull and boring display."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,An upmarket shopping area. All the brands and all the buzz. Restaurants and coffee spots. Takashimaya household section is a great browsing spot for cooking enthusiasts.
,,Street made for shopaholics,4.0,,Go with the crowd and find your shopping bliss. Paragon and Ngee Ann City were ok and relatively less crowded. Avoid MRT and underground areas if you have claustrophobic tendencies.
,,Bustling Singapore,5.0,,"So much seems to happen in Orchard Road. One of the main places to visit is the Paragon Centre. So many specialty shops, and wonderful eating venues."
,,If you like to shop...,4.0,,"We visited this place for the sake of knowing where it was. We didn't buy anything, but it was fun to walk around and see all the options they offer. If you are into shopping, then go there; if not, you can just skip it."
,,Awesome decor,5.0,,The christmas theme disney decoration was awesome. Shopping paradise in singapore. Must visit if you are in this country
,,Disappointing Christmas lights.,4.0,,"Visited early December in hope of enjoying Christmas lights but came away disappointed. Lights were very Disney orientated and not very Christmassy as all. Shops etc were all as good as always,with many having there own light displays. Orchard Road is always a great place to visit whenever visiting Singapore."
,,busy shopping street,3.0,,"Orchard road is great if you like shopping, but a bit of a nuisance if you don't. It feels too crowded, and it is hard to get a taxi."
,,shopping paradise,4.0,,"if u wanna go for a shop, head to orchard road. they have literally every shop. from shops like sephora to shops like gucci. this street has many separate shopping centres. no way you will get bored of looking, there is so much to look at. the street is also filled with many restaurants. and is easy to get there, as the orchard mrt station is inside of one of the shops on orchard"
,,Lit up like a christmas tree,4.0,,If you happen to be in Singapore at christmas time Orchard Road xmas lights are well worth a visit. Be warned it can be extremely crowed and chaotic.
,,Christmas vibes,4.0,,Busy street to do lots of shopping!! Happy place to be with!! We were there before Christmas and the lights and crowd .... that’s amazing life there... love
,,Shopping on steroids,4.0,,"Just about every step you take on Orchard Road is towards another retail outlet. For the most part the staff in stores are friendly and helpful. As a negative, children and babes in prams seem to enjoy an elevated status that often results in a discord with visitors with a western bent."
,,Shops shops and more shops,4.0,,"You can purchase anything hereon orchard road. It has all the high end shops and souvenir shops, plus some amazing eating places and restaurants. A must see while in singapore."
,,Why?,3.0,,"Presumably, shopping is not the reason you are on vacation in Singapore. Orchard Road has nothing that you can’t find in any other major city in the world. It’s just high end retail in a hot humid city. Why waste precious vacation time here when there are so many other great things to see and do in Singapore?"
,,Wow wow wow,5.0,,I was on the hop on the bus when I just snooze . I opened my eyes to find myself in a fairy tale of a street. Beautiful Christmas decorations.
,,Very Crowded the Week after Christmas,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a bit overwhelming for me. If you are a shopper, I cannot imagine not finding what you seek ... literally every store brand is available here."
,,Expensive stuff available here,4.0,,You should have your pockets full of money to shop in the malls in this street. Window shopping and experience is free though. But a must go place when in singapore to see the ambience on this street.
,,One stop shopping area,5.0,,It has resturant with food cuisines from different countries..big shopping malls.. Easily connected to metro and cabs..Must visit!!
,,Disney Christmas lights,4.0,,"So any visit to Singapore just ain’t complete without a stopover at Orchard Road and that’s what we did, purposely to check out the Disney-themed Christmas lights in conjunction with Mickey Mouse’s 90th Birthday this year (similar decorations were in place at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur too).

The lights were, sadly, pretty much similar to those of previous years, i.e. kinda ordinary and simple albeit with Disney decorations, but one thing is for sure - the crowd at Orchard Road is insanely huge like always!"
,,"Popular, but INSANELY thronged....",3.0,,"I did not like Orchard Road that much during the ""rush hour"". It was thronged with enough people to comprise a small army. If you are even remotely claustrophobic, only walk through early in the morning on your way to the Trail of Trees (if I recall the name correctly). Orchard Road is overhyped and gaudy. Avoid the main shopping area if at all possible."
,,A bonanza for shoppin,5.0,,"If you like shopping then this is the street to visit. Wide walkways, and a great mix of shopping for all tastes and pockets."
,,If you want to shop main brands go here,3.0,,"If you want to stock up on your branded shopping then come to Orchard Road, it's all here. However, it's nothing special, it's just a long road with all the shops on it and malls leading of it for even more choice.

Also, it's extremely busy at weekends, so go midweek just to save your sanity!"
,,SHOPPING,5.0,,Loved orchard road.. was very busy when we went.. shopping malls everywhere u go.. they also had indoor markets which were good and worth it to buy gifts and souvenirs to take back home.. lots of places to eat.. we downloaded a map of Singapore before we went out.. made out life 10x easier
,,Good for shopping and dinner,5.0,,"There are many shops and restaurants in this area, Orchard Road. You can get almost everything in this area. If you have heavy shower outside, you don't need to be worry, because you can enjoy inside of the building and the underground."
,,Busy Area,4.0,,Very busy area specially because of all the shops and restaurants you can find here. Nice for a walk and off course to shop.
,,Christmas vacations,5.0,,"The temple of shopping
All the malls together the one after the other
The most famous 313 Somerset, Takashimaya, Paragon, Tangs and of course ION
All the budget categories will be satisfied
From signature designers till normal firms

,,An Interesting Side of Singapore,5.0,,"Hustle and bustle without the rudeness you find in NYC and some other big cities. I found just walking along the street to be great people watching and to see the different shopping options. A city Visitor Center is there and worth stopping in.

,,A good place to eat and shop,5.0,,Just did a short walk as we are short of time. The street are all strung up with the Disney theme Christmas decoration. Went to PS cafe for our lunch next to the orchard tower. Afterward another short walk along the Thai embassy block before leaving Singapore.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"I am not a shopper, but even I think this area of Singapore is amazing. Takashimaya, a Japanese department store, has its own shopping center and the food court there has the best tempura I've ever eaten.

It was all decked out for the holidays and jam packed with people and Christmas events, like singing and dancing were taking place. But I would love it any time of year.

For part of our stay we were at the Marriott Tang Plaza on Orchard Road. I would recommend that as a great base for a couple of days. It's a great place to get a feel for that area."

Shops are well crowded this time of the year and some stays open till 10pm to midnite to accomodate last minute shoppers .
,,Great for Shopoholics,4.0,,"We spent a evening here enjoying the Christmas atmosphere and colour. However, it can be a little overpowering given the number of shops and malls.

Full of life anytime of day or night, with impressive parallel road underground, an aircon orchard road underneath, running from ion centre all the way to grange road corner, but underground,... in case the surface exhibits were not enough!... a source of energy and life and a place you can also spend lots of money shopping if you are not careful. All ages will find a best suited department store here.... chic architecture,... amazing place.
The most unique of it, the tremendous noise that birds make around 1845 to 2000 when they come to say the day goodbye into the abundant trees all along the road... the noise of birds commenting how the day went before they go to sleep is something I have never experienced anywhere else."

,,THOUGHT I WAS IN DISNEYLAND,5.0,,"Each year this classy city decorates its main street and others at Christmas with a theme. The time of our visit it was Disneyland, with colorful Disney characters located all along the route making for an enjoyable visit. The street itself is a wall of malls located side by side by side....mostly on the expensive side. Hungry. Lots of restaurants along the route. It`s worth the experience to spend some time in this area, one of the cleanist cities in the world."
,,Must have a wander,4.0,,"The size of the malls and shops on orchard road is absolutely amazing! While there are plenty of designer malls, there are also plenty of shops like cotton on, H&M etc and we found they had better specials then the outlet mall we went to. Don't go too early tho or you may find not everything is open."
,,The Legendary Orchard Road,5.0,,"This place a an absolute mecca for shopping. There are literally dozens and dozens of malls along its length including Ion orchard ,Somerset 314 , Paragon and countless others. It is always really busy and at Christmas has beautiful lights up."

,,"Shopping Paradise, cliche, I know.",5.0,,"For shopping experiences, Orchard Road has all the various types of brand and shops available to cater to your shopping spree.

Many eateries, cafes, restaurants to choose from if you need a break to rest your soles before rebooting your shopping lust."

Very many people crossing the street but very orderly, just keep to your left. Clean and highly trafficked so it feels safe and exciting all at once.

,,Go shopping crazy here!,5.0,,"No limits shopping on this street. All the big (and expensive) brands are here - and not only in one mall, but pretty much in every mall on this street. Also plenty of opportunities to enjoy all kinds of food you can imagine."
,,"Eat, play, drink, walk and window shop.",5.0,,"It is also a shopping paradise.
But you can also eat, play, drink and window shop if not just take a walk and feast your eyes. And if the heat gets you, just go down to the basement and walk from one mall to the other. That is what I like the most about this place. In Hong Kong CBD, the buildings are interconnected by bridges spanning above the roads, whereas in Singapore, it is the long shopping tunnels."
,,Christmas is my favourite season,4.0,,"Christmas is the best season to go shopping at Orchard road with your special partner. I loved the music, the night lights and the smoke free roads!"
,,Not worth anymore,2.0,,"Had visited 15 years back and was super impressed with the lights on Orchard Street. Went last week again witness great expectation. However, I and my wife concluded that the number of lights must be atleast 50% less compared to what we saw during our earlier visit."
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Must go place in Singapore, even if you are not a shopaholics. We can find Christmas decoration along Orchard Road starting fron Tanglin Rd. And if you are lucky, you can hear xmad carols at nights. This year theme is magical moments, we can find various of Disney character on decorations. Avoid to come during weekends as it would be too crowded."
,,Too crowded during the holiday season..,3.0,,"Great place to stroll along, it will definitely keep your senses alive.
Try to avoid the holiday season though as it gets very crowded.
If you are thinking of shopping, this area is more expensive in comparison if you go out of town a bit.
But for branded stuff Orchard Rd is the place to be!

Oh...this year Christmas decorations is a bit lacking in comparison with years before...just my opinion."
,,Shoppers heavens,5.0,,"Orchard road is always a must visit if you are in Singapore, beautiful Xmas lighting decor, December is also a sales month for a lot of outlets. Plenty of eateries.. You will need all day for Orchard road to shop and dine."

Basement of Takashimaya has super offerings. I love the Borders Bistro. Lots of great coffee shops, particularly inside ion Mall. Looking for deals, go to Lucky Plaza.

Singapore is of course expensive - I paid $15 AUD for an ice cream cup with 3 scoops......."
,,Great shopping in a very nice setting,5.0,,"Trees, wide streets, and every designer brand you ever heard of. If your a ""shopper"" this is a must see/do. A reminder tho', if you are a shopper, take along All your credit cards, as you will probably need them. All kidding aside, even if your not a shopper its well worth the visit. Just like NYs 5th Ave, only cleaner."

,,Must do this but wait until the last day of your trip,5.0,,"If you're uncomfortable around crowds, DO NOT run the Orchard Road gauntlet. What an amazing shopping experience. Everything, and I mean everything, is here. Not necessarily the same tourist bargains as you'll find in ChinaTown but the variety and mall-eating experiences are fantastic. I say wait until the final day of your trip, because if you tire easily of being super-close to people, you'll need a hearty break after Orchard Road."
,,Shop until you drop,3.0,,A one of a kind shopping area with many upscale malls. Great places to enjoy lunches and dinners but much more expensive then other parts of Singapore. Evening walks along orchard road is great way to spend couple of evening hours.

,,It’s like sixth ave in NYC !,5.0,,"Great shopping and you don’t have to walk very far as the malls are v near to each other. From affordable to expensive and branded goods from all over the world and of course all the malls have food courts when you are hungry. Food from Singapore like laksa ,Hainanese chicken rice ,Char Kway Teow(fried noodles Singapore style)etc If you are a visitor you can claim detox in the airport for goods bought.Marina bay Seafood centre is also just a few train stops away and you must try our famous Chilli crabs or black pepper crabs....yummy"

,,shop till you drop,5.0,,Taking the wife on a shopping trip to famous Orchard road was a nightmare for me in a positive sense. Shopping in these huge malls was an experience just seeing my soul mate buying and paying for the goodies.The merchandise was not cheap but of great quailty.Some good bargains . shopping in this orchard road district takes patience so be be prepared to have plenty of it. Plenty of restaurants to sit and chill in between shopping

,,Busy district,5.0,,Excellent but pricey! Lots’a place to shop. Brand items in line. The food court is great and most especially I got the chance to buy the famous Irvin’s potato chips.
,,Festive Mood,5.0,,Orchard Road in Singapore is the coolest place. This place itself has a festive mood. During my stay at Orchard Road it was covered in a Disney theme. Branded showrooms are all around here for shopping. The only negative portion is it's a huge expensive area. Happy roaming in Orchard Road.

,,A place to shop til you drop.. literally,4.0,,"Orchard Road is an experience; a long road in central Singapore with multiple shopping malls where you can buy and eat anything, from cheap to ultra designer, all within cool air-conditioned environments.

Currently for Christmas 2018 the street is decorated with the Christmas lights and there is endless piped Christmas music (which to a European is always slightly incongruent with the heat and sunshine!)

We find this shopping experience only possible in small doses.. the crowds and noise is only tolerable for a couple of hours, and certainly never go on a Sunday which is the day off for all the helpers who all congregate on Orchard Road."
,,Best Shopping Spot,5.0,,You got all your top stores here. Too many to mention. Best Hotels like the Tang marriott are also in the area.

The ENTIRE STREET is lit up and brightly decorated for the Holiday Season. So merry and bright.

Enjoy the Christmas market outside Takashimaya mall.

This year.. Disneyland comes to Singapore.

2 thumbs up."

,,A glimpse of luxurious Singapore,5.0,,"If you are looking to see the Crazy Rich part of Singapore, this is where you should go. You can start from ION orchard (Orchard MRT) and walk along to road until you reached Singapura Plaza (Dhoby Ghaut MRT). There are a dozen malls along the street, all of which will have those luxurious brands where you need to queue in line just to enter the shops.

If you are like me though, who does not really shops there, you can still enjoy the street itself. You can just walk along the street without entering any malls. Buy foods from 7-11. Or there is always a cheaper option in those malls if you go to the lowest basement. I love sitting on the street watching street performers there. During December, the Christmas theme is on display. You can see to see lights and decoration along the stretch."

,,Designer Road,4.0,,"We stayed at the Orchard Hotel and hence got an opportunity to walk down Orchard Road almost daily, throughout the trip. Since it was Christmas season, the road and the malls along it were decorated beautifully. There are great malls where you can shop to your heart's content, good eating joints and night life. Take a walk down this road atleast once."

,,Just malls!,3.0,,"I loved Singapore for its clean streets and parks but I didn’t appreciate the aspect of their culture related to shopping. They love malls and, as a consequence, they adore this long, busy street of malls. Yes, malls are the only things you can find in Orchard Road. Different kinds of mall, of course, but still malls.

,,A bit bland,3.0,,"Hmmmm I really wasn’t over excited by this place. It has mainly boutique shops and given the strength of the Singapore dollar, it is actually quite expensive. I would recommend little India or Chinatown as much more fun."
,,Mix of Malls,4.0,,"Orchard Road reminded me of the Champs Elysee, it has the same layout but not as wide. It has lots and lots of Malls all lined up next to each other, full of high end shops like Gucci, Prada etc and they are mixed with the high street brands such as Uniqlo, Marks & Spencers to name a few, guess which ones we went for? The road was decorated with a Christmas theme, namely Disney which looked amazing on a night all lit up.
A great, enormous road, 2.2km's which has so many great shops and is fab for people watching."

,,"Shop, Shop, Shop - Crazy Insane",5.0,,"No other place to be if you want to shop continuously. Orchard Road possesses mall after mall after mall. Shop after shop after shop. It’s Vegas on steroids times a million.

Take breadcrumbs and mark your path! Definitely an opportunity to go in, get lost and never be able to find your way out. The malls along Orchard are linked so you never have to go outside.

Not sure how else to describe Singapore shopping except crazy insane. Orchard is not the only shopping experience in Singapore! Marina Bay is also insanity."
,,Lovely and awesome!,5.0,,"Orchard Road may be rightfully considered the heart of Singapore. It's always bustling with people - locals and tourists alike, whether it be evening or late night or even afternoon, though it gets more crowded during weekends and late evenings.

It has been recently decorated with Pink-coloured lights in Disney theme, with different Disney Characters displayed at spaced intervals. It was a sight to behold.

Since I was staying at Orchard Hotel, located a little up the Orchard Road (at its interjection with Tanglin Road) Orchard Road was frequently visited by for a stroll as well as passed by in the bus while going to MBS, Gardens by the Bay, Changi Airport, Little India, etc.

As expected, it's expensive to shop here, but that's what one should not complain about, right?"
,,Touristy location and expensive,3.0,,"The area is touristy and food is expensive.
It lacks the Singapore Identity.
Lucky Plaza is a meeting place Filipino maids and employees on Sundays.
Ion is filled with Branded Good as well as Mandarin Hotel's shopping gallery.
The problem with the shops here are they are repeated at the malls here and in the neighbourhood centres.
Food at the Food courts are expensive.
The streets are well lighted during the Christmas Period but can be boring to watch after a while.
Only good if you are on a transit flight through Singapore and need to pass some time.
On weekdays some of the food courts are packed with office workers from the area at lunch time."
,,Very expensive,3.0,,A lot of shopping malls with the same shops.Mostly luxury shops.Try not to go on Sundays because it gets very crowded with maids and foreign workers.(Since Sunday is their off day)
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"To me, Orchard Road is the equivalent of 5th avenue in New York city. It is a row of high end shopping. The reason we went is that Singapore is crazy about Christmas, which we found surprising. Orchard road was decorated for Christmas similar to NYC. It was a really nice display, apparently Disney-based and/or sponsored. This is not the place to go for cheap eats, as you might expect from the above description. Accessible by SMRT (mass transit) at both ends of the street. I rate it a 4 for the Christmas decorations."
,,The Disney + Christmas lights were a treat,5.0,,The Christmas lights have been put up already and there are a few really lovely Mickey Mouse + Minnie Mouse and Donald Duck + Daisy Duck installations for photo opportunities
,,Christmas lights are fantastic!,5.0,,"There is nothing like the Christmas display I have ever seen. Each block was dedicated to a different Disney movie which the kids loved, spotting the characters. The food markets also had delicious food truck style meals! Well worth the walk."
,,Interested street.,4.0,,This is a touristic place. Lots of mall. there's a mosque here. Not easy to find cheap food. Nice place for walking and photoshoot.
,,Mall after Mall after Mall,4.0,,"Orchard Road has got to be a shopper's paradise. Mall after mall after mall. It is amazing that the city can support the volume of expensive designer shops one can find in the malls, but if you look hard enough, you can also find bargain and discount shops as well. Lots of eateries, too. Only problem is that the Road is highly trafficked and difficult to cross. Some of the traffic lights take a very long time to change and allow pedestrian flow. You want to shop, though? Visit Orchard Road."
,,Have to visit,5.0,,"If your trip is in weekends, so do not miss this place at nights. So vibrant and full of events and activities."
,,Too much,2.0,,"Anything the World does not need! Orchard Road has a great history and apparently was quaint too! No more! I wouldnt have been surprised if they charged for just being there! Everything is money and spending, everything is sponsored and nothing is just for the sake of it! See photos."
,,Central Shopping District,4.0,,"Working along this stretch of road, it's a busy landscape. Take your family there during festive season as there are lots of pretty lighting and festive mood around there. Lots of tourist tax refund options available."
,,Modern Shopping yet stil lots of bargains,5.0,,"Stroll along Orchard road and take in the modern buildings and shops, but if you want to escape the heat, go underground to find a miriad of cheap shops selling everything from clothing to electrical goods. Don't expect to get ripped off as Singapore is a place that stamped out a bad practice years ago. But make sure that you shop around first before you buy to get the best price.

How can you go past 5 T shirts to knock around in for $10."
,,Christmas vibes,5.0,,Its the time of the year again to start shopping for christmas presents! The christmas lights at orchard is lit! Always looking forward to the decorations at orchard as they make me feel so happy and boost the christmas vibes well. Head on down to take pretty pictures and spend a good time shopping and eating there :))
,,OK if you want standard shopping and lots of food,3.0,,"Orchard Road has the major standard brand names if that is what you are looking for. According to my American sister in law, shopping in Orchard Road is expensive compared to factory outlet shopping in the States. Personally, I don't find our sales to be interesting (including the so called Great Singapore sale) as most of the items are at most 10-20% discounted compared to sales in the States which can see many items at 40% discount or more. Many of the sales items also seem to be items which can't sell. If you would like to experience a more 'local' shopping experience (though you might not buy anything there), try places like Toa Payoh, Little India and Kampong Glam. While you might not buy anything, it might be a more interesting experience. I have bought batik in Kampong Glam for foreign friends- but beware, batik colours run so if you buy batik for anyone, do give them instructions on how to hand wash the batik."
,,Disney Christmas,5.0,,"Walking along orchard road all the Christmas decorations were out. I’m not sure if you can walk through the underground malls. We didn’t find many that met up. Very high end shopping here, but loved the Christmas display"

,,Orchard Road a.k.a Mall Nirvana,5.0,,"For those who love shopping in malls this road is heaven.
There are numerous malls all along the road offering everything you can dream of at all price points. The best part is they are interconnected at the basement level so you can just walk through from one to the other. The all have fantastic food courts too especially ION orchard. I have never seen such neat, clean and organized food courts anywhere else. ION Orchard has free WiFi.
For bargain shopping head to Lucky Plaza and for more expensive tastes, the Paragon next door."
,,A Must visit for shoppers,4.0,,"On our route from Auckland to Dubai we stopped in Sinagapore. No visit of Singapore without a visit of Orchard Road! Interesting to see, but for us it was similar to Dubai, lot same brands/shops. A plus was for sure, that you can walk outside along the road not only in shopping malls. I had to remind myself that I just no more space left in my suitcase, otherwise I would have been shopping. Good prices there. But what we really remember still is the cleanliness everywhere! No waste lying around on the road or in hidden corners, you feel perfectly safe, no beggars as we experienced in Auckland Queens Street a lot, friendly helpful people if you loose your orientation...Well done! Never have seen such clean safe place like this!"
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Great if you love shopping, can be overwhelming if you don't. Emerald Hill nearby and the roof garden at the top of Orchard Central are a great escape."
,,A Must-See in Singapore,5.0,,"You cannot go to Singapore and not go to Orchard Rd. It is, of course, at the heart of the city so you can't miss it, but more than that whether nightnor day, you will always find things to do and places to visit along Orchard Rd.

,,An Expensive Shopping Area,2.0,,"Orchard Road is the home of some of Singapore's most exclusive shops. In our opinion, if you're not looking to spend a great deal of money this is one place you can pass up."
,,shopping at orchard road,5.0,,"it was a good experience to shop for things we don't have here locally,it was a wonderland since we came on Dec last year,it was Christmas everywhere and it was a wonderland!!the locals speak english that was of great help, the taxi drivers were forever helpful and accomodating, it was worthwhile"
,,Fine if you are a millionaire,3.0,,"I have to admit we didnt go all the way down Orchard Road but what we did see of it was all high end swish shops the like of Gucci Prada Rolex etc etc as for ordinary shoppers there are plenty of shopping malls/centres and the local markets. Much better value for money, but if you can afford it Orchard Road may be just what you are looking for!"
,,So crowded but very much alive,4.0,,We went to Orchard Road because my Dad wants to have a durian ice cream sandwich. We look for the uncle and the road was crowded.

,,Indulgence,5.0,,Any thing and everything you would ever dream of buying. Even if it's a dream. Not only above ground below the shop's will amaze you. It's like a rabbit hole. This street is everything Singapore is. Total indulgence. The bus stop is accessible and easy to use. Can catch cabs and more.
,,Visiting from Brisbane,4.0,,"One of the most recognisable shopping streets in all of asia, no visit to Singapore is complete without a walk down this iconic street"
,,SSSSOOO many shops but don’t expect to find a bargain on designers,4.0,,"This street is insane it literally is a street of shopping malls, there are so many shops it can get a bit much, and I love shopping.
However all of the high end designers like Louis Vuitton & Gucci etc are cheaper at home. Even with them offering tax free it worked out about £350 more the bag I was looking at then it would have cost me at home. If you are going just for a general shop it’s great, and you feel so safe and the shops are open until about 10pm I think so definitely worth a visit.
We are gutted we missed the Christmas lights as I’m sure they will look amazing they were Disney themed so would have loved to have seen them."
,,Endless Shopping!,5.0,,"Singapore's most famous shopping district, this road is lined with dozens of malls carrying every major brand imaginable.

,,Shoppers’ heaven,4.0,,"Orchard Road can get very crowded, but it’s good for all kinds of shopping (maybe not groceries, apart from in Marks and Spencer) Big Brand’s and designer labels as well as some smaller outlets in various Malls. Scape is good for cheap one off clothes."

,,Shopping and more Shopping,5.0,,"Well if you want to get some quality shopping done then this is the place.
When the Great Singapore Sale (GSS) is on you have great discounts available to you. If you then have a MasterCard you save more with no conversion fees. The Qantas Money cars was really worked hard and was the best travel money card I’ve ever used.

On a night stalls appear from nowhere and you then find t shirts clothing watches for next to nothing.
Same goes for food.every type of Asian food, fruit and ice creams. Small barrows , or shops selling one food item. Eat then go to the next one. At the end of the night you might spend £10 this way or go into a large and sometimes glamorous eating place and spend £100."

Electronic in china town worth looking at, my advise take notes for the prices and shops address and location as all looks alike might miss the bargain, always bargain to the minim"
,,Tick it off the bucket list.,2.0,,I guess having Marina Bay Sands and The Shoppes has diverted some traffic. Orchard Rd really does not have anything MBS doesn't. So no real reason to go except for Kinokuniya; the book shop.
,,So much choice!,5.0,,"We shopped til we dropped. Our favourite dept store was ION as it had a good mix of high end and budget stores. Orchard Rd itself is clean, decorative with wide footpaths and easy to navigate."
,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping",4.0,,"A trip to Orchard Road is a must when visiting Singapore. Lots and lots of shops offering both high end and middle of the range to cater for all options. Difficult to find decent food options without visiting a food court. Also restaurants do not open early so don’t expect to grab an early breakfast.
Starting to gear up for Christmas so lots of beautiful decorations all around."
,,"Focal point for food, shopping and relaxing",5.0,,"This is a hot spot for nice day or few hours. Watch out for attractions inside and outside. Every big shopping area has some deli or cocktaibar outside. Under brand shops there are small shops in endless arcades.

,,Modern City Malls Galore,4.0,,Pretty much what you expect out of Singapore. Glamorous futuristic mall after mall. Singapore is typically expensive but the food is unexpectedly inexpensive. Of course the hawker centers are cheap and excellent but I even found the high end food courts to be relatively inexpensive- partly due to the strong dollar right now.

,,Not as vibrant as before,3.0,,"Orchard Road will always be an attraction on its own; a shopper's and tourist's mecca. This time around, it was not as exciting to us as it used to be; maybe we have been visiting it since I was knee high to a grasshopper and it is losing its attraction. But our grandson surely enjoyed himself with so much hustle and bustle. We are discovering that places like Tang's basement is no longer as cheap to shop as before and that goes for Orchard Road as well. But one cannot go to Singapore without walking down Orchard Road..."
,,Nice but probably not the first priority when visiting Singapore,3.0,,"You have Regent Street, 5th Avenue or any other shopping street in the world in large cities and they are all the same. Dont go shopping in orchard road as you dont really get anything special. You will see Prada, Todd, and all the premium brands as you would at home.

With malls lining both sides of the street and brands galore, the only difficulty is controlling yourself amongst all the variety and super offers! There’s a huge Apple store that you must must must visit! They have very helpful staff and the latest. My personal fav mall was Takashimaya, it’s impossible to go through the whole mall in a day. It has most of the brands that you could think of. If you’re looking for plus size clothing go to Metro at Paragon. There’s a lot of variety and very economical. Don’t forget to stop by at the Victoria Secret store, one of the biggest I’ve seen!"

,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"I reckon that every city has a famous street and, in Singapore it has to be Orchard Road. It's first Department Store, Tangs, opened in 1958, still stands proudly with it's jade-green pagoda-like roof and iconic red columns.
Its claimed that the 2.2km stretch of Orchard Road now has over 5,000 establishments, both above and underground, catering to inhabitants and tourists alike. Mostly high-end and luxury, you can still grab a bargain at Lucky Plaza or many of the smaller shops that do not enjoy high pedestrian traffic. Restaurants are a gourmet delight, a veritable paradise of cuisines, but you can still enjoy a snack or fast good fix if desired. If you like to imbibe your favourite whiskey, visit The Grande Whisky Collection in the ION Orchard and then the retail shop.
There are still bastions of greenery visible, the Royal Thai Embassy, the Presidential parks and gardens, maybe not accessible to the public but a welcome break in the concrete, steel and glass high-rises."

Both high end products and mediocre commodities are available though at Orchard and so it commands even more traffic from all walks of life. One can easily spend an afternoon shopping along the street and then find a place to recharge yourself with delicacies or just a bowl of Laksa at a mall food court. Most of the time I visited Singapore, I stay in a hotel on the strip and I never get tired roaming this street after dinner instead of watching TV in my hotel room."

There really is something for everyone from 'high end', say Paragon, to the flavour of old Singapore, say Lucky Plaza. If you are a visitor from out of town the best advice I can offer is wear comfortable walking shoes and there are some places that offer discounted meals from 3pm. Can also highly recommend the open cafe in Paragon situated at the top floor opposite the Peking Duck restaurant - their Carrot Cake is simply the best EVER!! (Our dining neighbour was also swooning over her Margarita Pizza whilst we were also ogling another diner's prawn pasta!) Surprising for such an average looking coffee place!!"

Some places open 24 hours. Nice street music as well. Shop till you drop. Put good shoes on as it is a lot of walking. Very busy with locals and tourists. Take a shawl or light cardigan, the air conditioning in some places is freezing!"

,,Lively place!,4.0,,Our hotel was at Orchard Road and this is a nice place to stay. I came back at around 3am and this place seemed lively at that hour also! Lots of good restaurants are around and if you want to do branded shopping then world famous brands are also there!
,,Good to walk not shop,3.0,,Feels like mini Oxford street and is a great place to walk around but unfortunately the shopping is so expensive that I didn't end up buying anything.
,,Shop till you drop...,4.0,,"Everyone in Singapore or so it seems passes through here. We liked a lucky Plaza for the cheaper range of goods, I spent my money at Art Friend in the Sony Gaut compels buying up on cheaper good quality art stuff. We liked the Food Republix also for cheap hawker foods."

,,shopping paradise,5.0,,"when you're visit singapore..incomplete if you don't visit orchard road,expecially woman.. If you visit Lucky Plaza you will be lucky to find cheap items.."
,,Great place to shop but....,4.0,,"We had heard about Orchard road and as there was a shuttle bus from our hotel to go there we did. There are a lot of high end shops but also some not so high. The reason for the but is that we are seniors and there are very few places to sit. The few we saw were often occupied by smokers. Singapore is a great place, no longer known for cheaper technology, we do better in Australia but a great place to go and we will go back."
,,Life,4.0,,"This road has everything whether its food, shopping, trains or expensive cars passing by coffee shops all available on this road even if u want to just walk with friends and look around its nice at night due to the lights."

,,the high street,4.0,,the high street of singapore...lined with brands after brands...it gets quite lively in the evenings...houses almost all the luxury brands of the world...a place to splurge...
,,Lively place,5.0,,Orchard road is one of the most lively and lovely places in singapore. It has not only retained its charm over so many years but has become more and more better ! Best part of the orchard road is huge walkways for the pedestrians on both the sides which are full of big shopping complexes and hotels. Its really fun walking on orchard road in the evenings due to its liveliness.
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"What a super classy & neat boulevard, malls coffee shops restaurants hotels felt so amazing being there it’s has its own life & very trendy place I would say"
,,"Shops after shops, malls after malls",3.0,,"It could be a great place if you have a lot of money. Malls and shops are everywhere. Most of them are branded shops and the stores are kinda similar in different malls. There were some cheaper clothing and souvenirs shops in Lucky Plaza. I just went window shopping, ate ice-cream and drank coke in 7-11."
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Our 4th Visit to Singapore, we are still discovering all the shops, there are many new ones, plenty of restaurants, cafe's and food courts, this time we discovered so many more shops underground, the are many underground street crossings, directions can be confusing as you have to know the street name to find the correct direction sign."
,,Let me try a-a-a-gain,3.0,,"Last review didn’t get published, no idea why. Ok so I happened upon Orchard Road quite by accident, as Village Hotel, Changi do a free shuttle here. We were hot & bothered upon just arriving in Singa, & decided to cool off in the AC shopping Centre. Firstly we went to Far East Plaza, this was like going back in time, then Lucky Plaza. LP was a fair bit busier than FEP. It was OK to while away an hour or two. As for the designer shops, If you have more money than sense then this will be the place for you. We bought ice creams from 7-11 & sat amongst the locals outside having their lunch as watched the world go by. Finally before heading home we posed for pics with the Marvel characters."
,,Average,3.0,,"I loved Singapore, but didn’t really enjoy Orchard road. It was nice to walk down the street full of stores if you’re there for shopping, but even that is little annoying because it’s all malls. Mall after mall after mall... and no variety. It’s actually same stores in every mall. Not really impressed..."
,,"Money, money, money. That’s what you need.",5.0,,We stayed just off Orchard Road near ION Orchard Shopping Centre. Orchard Road is great. You can spend all of your money on designer things but of course you don’t have to. You can wander around window shopping as the choices are endless. There are also some great places to eat and drink (happy hours). There are only certain areas that you can cross the road but there are the underpasses and most areas are under cover as it can rain quite a bit. Good links for the MRT and buses.
,,Sore Feet,5.0,,"After three days of walking up and down Orchard Road doing a shop till you drop we a re worn out but found so wonderful places from Lucky Plaza where so many pokey shops abound to the big department stores like Robinsons, all offering a different range of products."
,,Family,5.0,,I love Singapore so I am biased. Love staying on Orchard Road or just off it. Busy bustling hype just the way I like it . All types of food shopping n window shopping can be found on this vibrant street 😜💖

,,The Orchard Hotel is a favourite of mine to stay at,5.0,,"The last two times I visited Singapore we stayed at the Orchard hotel at the top end of Orchard Road.
We have walked up and down Orchard road many times and never get tired of visiting the different shops shopping centres.
If you visit at Christmas time it is always decorated with lights etc. with a beautiful atmosphere. You never want to go home."
,,interesting,4.0,,"crowded green belt for various malls, my preference is ION and Daiso for cheapest stuff though i dint buy but bought from Pull n bear clothes nice pick"
,,Disappointed 😔,3.0,,"We decided to walk along Orchard road to experience the area. Hot and humid, shops air conditioned which is great. I was disappointed in the shops, thought Australia was better. Kept my $$ in my purse."
,,Fantastic shopping,5.0,,"There was hundreds of shops from H&M, Abercrombie and Fitch to huge designers the choice was endless. Easy to get too either by bus or MRT. I could have spent a fortune if I had loads of money."
,,Everything and all of it is here,5.0,,high end and retail in the middle range as well. Orchard is a great place to browse. 2 km long with plenty to see and do.
,,Good,4.0,,This place is ideally the Manhattan of Singapore it is the shopping district and it is an absolute favourite with the tourist
,,full of big brand shops,4.0,,orchard road is the road for shopping in singapore.with every big brand store you can think of there and a few malls aswell.you can buy anything you need on this road.it also has many eateries and hotels on it.
,,If you like shopping......,4.0,,"One iconic road in Singapore you shouldn’t miss. Shopping centres galore!!!! Every brand you could think of, and seemingly multiple outlets.
Well served by the MRT also, Somerset and Orchard both exiting onto Orchard Road.
There are plenty of good hotels also; we stayed at the Marriott Tang."
,,high end shopping,5.0,,"great place to shop and eat but some shopping very expensive. we went to the movies great place Shaw theatre, but good tip book tickets on line don;t just turn up to purchase tickets as you well may miss out"
,,A Mecca of shopping and delight,5.0,,"If you love shopping visit Singapore. So easy to become lost in these shopping centres, but you only have to check with the desk and help is always at hand."
,,If you visit Singapore Don't Miss this Road,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the heart of Singapore, mainly this road is base on Shopping, high end restaurants and hotels, if you come to Singapore for shopping, look for a hotels in orchard road area. I still remember in the evening the small birds singing loudly, overall the whole area is base on shopping and eating,"
,,Didn't buy anything - but a great experience,4.0,,"Went here because it was too rainy to do much else- and it turned out to be great.
We started at the Takashimaya Building and after realising that we couldn't afford anything on that floor (particularly the $4.2million dollar diamond ring on display)- we walked straight back out again.
We realised that there must be more than just multi-million dollar jewels on display so we went back in and had another go.
Discovered a nice dim sum restaurant for lunch (turned out to be the Michelin Starred Crystal Jade). Was affordable and delicious but the Basement food market was even better!
Great pastries, chocolates and gifts."
,,Shopping days,4.0,,"If you like shopping go there. We got sort of lost in theIon centre, but managed to find our way. Always helpful concieges around"
,,lots of malls,4.0,,all the shopping malls are lined up on one main street. OD on branded goods. Nice to browse even just to get out of the sun.
,,Nice walk along Orchard road stretch with good buffet food in 5 star hotel,5.0,,"While Orchard is a nice place to take a leisure stroll and soak in the view , special mention is a very delectable buffet in Orchard Mandarin Hotel , which has the widest range of quality food and price is just above-average which is understandable due to its quality and range of items. Must try to check this out."
,,Famous shopping street in Singapore,5.0,,It's a shopping paradise and always going to this place whenever i visit singapore and don't forget to try the famous ice cream outside takashimaya
,,Leave your wallet at home...,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise ....super mix of designer brands with normal high street brands, loads of shopping arcades underground also...easily spend a week shopping....and burn a few credit cards..!!"
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"If you want to experience glamorous shopping, haute couture etc, then this is the place to go. All the top brands including Prada,
Hugo Boss, Yves St Laurent, are on this Road. Fabulous shops, but take your Bankcards with you. You really do get what you pay for here."
,,Maze,4.0,,I find that a lot of the large malls along this street have interconnecting walkways... and many different levels. Easy to get confused as to know where you are. Not much in the way of affordable shopping here. Mostly high end stuff.
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,We visited on a Sunday and it got very busy. So many shopping malls either side of the road to suit all tastes.
,,Shopper paradise in Singapore,4.0,,"The malls on two sides of this road sell all kinds of products or brands you can think of. From the luxurious ones like ION and Ngee Ann City to 313 Somerset which locals more often visit, everyone can find a mall to suit their own taste. Just make sure you bring your wallet though, many of the fun you can have here involves a relatively large amount of cash."
,,Nice shopping area,5.0,,"Orchard road Singapore is the icon of fashion and retail hub of Singapore. Mostly all international brands are located here. Fine dining restaurants are everywhere , connected by MRT and other transportation - one must visit this landmark place - best for people who like long distance walking. Did a lot of shopping - many malls around on both sides of the road and all of them are connected underground with very clever way.
Shopping paradise is what they call this place.
Love Singapore"
,,Past it’s best,3.0,,"I sparkle I think has gone. It is now just shopping shopping shopping, It is geared for the Japanese market. Even Lucky Plaza has lost its charm. Just progress I guess, I think it’s sad."
,,So many shops. Could spend months and not see them all,3.0,,Can get a bit hectic on Orchard Road but worth the crowds to see it. The skies opened up when we were there and it just poured. Suggest taking an umbrella if it looks like rain.
,,Shoppers heaven,4.0,,"Singapore is very famous for shopping and shopping malls in every corner. Yet the orchard road is the shopping gem of Singapore. As a person who hates shopping, I still couldn't miss this joy. But still remember Singapore is an expensive country, so don't just use your credit card without calculating the price in your local currency."
,,Amazing shopping,5.0,,"We were out at 10pm at night on a Sunday and the place was buzzing! Amazing shops like Gucci, Tiffany and Co, Victoria Secret."
,,Busy road with lots of shopping options,5.0,,Our hotel was situated on Orchard road. Lot's & lot's of shopping options & malls. Lots of eating options as well. Almost all major hotels situated on Orchard road.
,,Great place to shop or just people watching,5.0,,"Beautiful place to shop, people watching , or just for a stroll. Many place to eat, from inexpensive food court to gourmet dining. very clean city"
,,Stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Orchard Road,5.0,,"Stunning and busy one way road. Beautifully lit up at night. Safe to walk. Easy access to MRT and train stations, shopping malls galore and a number of coffee shops and eateries can be found"
,,Malls for all tastes and budgets,5.0,,"Many malls from budget to high end with chain stores, luxury boutiques and so many great food options. Easy to get around but it can be set to get lost when you're underground. The shops can be above and below the MRT stations and one mall blends into another. Trust the signs rather than your phone GPS."
,,Christmas in November,5.0,,I like being able to walk everywhere and shop if I want. What I really liked was the decorations that were being tested and were delighting the eye. The food malls were amazing and I have a new favorite of a mango gell drink/dessert. More please.
,,Orchard Road. Is it still Singapore?,4.0,,Still a great place to shop especially with so many of the shops and eating places underground. Sunday is a problem if you don't particularly like crowds. Everybody is out for the day and so be prepared to do a lot of dodging especially around people taking selfies and group photos.
,,August visit,4.0,,"The road to shop and eat on ranging from the ""you must be joking price"" to the bearable / cheap. The road has everything on it and if you get too hot just pop into any of the malls to cool down. Easy to get around and totally safe."
,,Very nice walk,5.0,,"You can't come to Singapore without going for a walk in this road.
So many shopping buildings and they are up and also many basements. Some of them have the best brands in one place and others have cheaper ones as well. In the basements you find the best prices, of course, but with great quality."
,,The best location for Restaurants and hotels,5.0,,Orchard Road is one of the best places to be for Restaurants and walking. Some of the best hotels are located here and it has two Metro stops for you to get around and see the city.
,,Expensive lol,5.0,,"Filled with big shops, lots of shops, the Louis v’s, Cartier, Patek Phillipe, etc. It’s a beautiful street. You can just walk around and window shop if you don’t really want to buy anything. It’s beautiful but almost everything on this street is expensive."
,,"Shops, shops and more shops at very expensive prices",3.0,,Too many overpriced shops which can be seen in UK cities. We saw little that reflected local arts and handicrafts. The main thing we bought was fresh fruit juice. We only went because we were staying nearby so had to go to find meals. These were not easy for us to find being vegetarian.
,,Heaven for shopping,5.0,,"Girls’ heaven ! Lots of shopping spot here ! Lucky plaza for cheap perfume and go during june - aug , huge sales and you can get really cheap bargain !"
,,Casual walk,5.0,,"What a surprised place. Was there on Sunday and was so many people . So many street performance with solo magical performer, music solo and group musical .
The atmosphere was amazing with so many shopping both side of walk way. All shopping mall with so many F&B everywhere
It’s worth the walk with stations MRT close by."
,,Oxford street in Singapore,3.0,,So if you’ve seen oxford street it’s pretty much the same thing but with humidity and lots of heat. No kids stores to be found
,,Why did the chicken cross Orchard road?,1.0,,It didn’t. It is not possible to cross Orchard road. Especially with a child in a stroller. This is a chaotic and overrated road in an otherwise fascinating city. We repeatedly tried to use underpasses but there were no signs so we were repeatedly lost and heading in the wrong direction.
,,Loved the Area to Walk,4.0,,"After eating all the great food around Singapore all day, I really enjoyed Orchard Road to walk off some calories and wind down. It was very clean and I felt very safe. The number of people out and about even on weeknights surprised me, but I assume everyone was out enjoying the cooler temperatures. The underground passages across the street were handy, were full of shopping opportunities and were significantly cooler than ground level if you need to get away from the heat. Lastly, the chirping birds in the trees were nice to hear and it was interesting how they all got excited and significantly louder every time there was a horn honk from traffic."
,,Not much of interest unless you are really into shopping!,3.0,,"I walked from one end of Orchard to the other and it wasn't much of interest to me. There are some high-end luxury brand stores and also many high-street malls in between. Coming from a country where shopping and malls etc is just as accessible, this wasn't of interest to me at all. So if you are planning to see something unusual, you may be disappointed, but if you are planning to shop then this is probably the best location to be."
,,Good collection of shopping from discount to high end,4.0,,As with most places in Singapore Orchard road is easy to get to on the MRT and it has great range of shopping from discount malls to high end shops - worth the visit.
,,Travel,4.0,,"One can find all sorts of shops on this street, mostly mid to high end. Many restaurants and food courts serving food from all over the world. Don't miss out the ice-cream sandwiches on the street"
,,Shopping,4.0,,Really good if you love to shop. Can be a bit expensive and hard to navigate all the underground connections to other shops etc. But worth a visit none the less
,,Orchard Road diversifying,3.0,,"At one time, Orchard Road was what Sungaporg was all about. Now it is one if the places one might visit and you'd not miss much if you did not have time to see it.

Shopping was once what Orchard Road was all about but now there are so many other places easily reached via the MRT.

Still a hood place for a night time stroll."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,A great shopping strip on both sides of the road. Almost all famous brands are available there. We didn't do any shopping but if you are into shopping its a heaven.
,,Singapore!,5.0,,Singapore is a great family destination with something to offer everyone. We will be back very soon!
,,More malls than you can shake a stick at...,4.0,,"Orchard Road is well known for shopping and there is little more to add. You can meet any shopping desire from the highest top end to the most local sellers, often on opposite sides of the road.
There is lots of choice but I never got the impression that there were real bargains to be had... but maybe I wasn't looking hard enough.
A great shopping experience but not the first place to visit in Singapore. There are several mrt stations along the whole length of the road which also gives a clue to its length!!"
,,Singapore,5.0,,i'm staying at the Concorde Hotel on Orchard and the shopping is absolutely fantastic. Its a bonus that there are fabulous restaurants in the malls as well. All is in walking distance.
,,Excellent for extravagant shopping,5.0,,Orchard Road is for splurging and hefty bills. It gives great options to shop and to eat but don't go expecting steal deals and bargaining. The street and shops tend to be much busier on the weekend.
,,Certainly no shortage of shopping malls,4.0,,Good to see however the malls & prices are not much different to Sydney only 10 times more of them. Same outlets & same prices on most things. I did get a great deal on perfume at Tangs though.
,,Busy but Worth a Visit,5.0,,So busy with lots of crowds but in the main area there are lots of department stores including Lucky Plaza for the cheaper options. Easy access via quite a few train stops. Lots of food options.
,,Shopping on steroids,1.0,,"We couldn't find any bargains and had a lot of difficulty finding and waiting for a taxi when we wanted to leave. It's best to wear your most comfortable walking shoes on because you have to walk long distances to find what you're looking for. The shops aren't cheap, I wouldn't go there again."
,,LOve the Road and the City Life,5.0,,"Stay on orchard road is very enjoyable for me and my family as its easy to access anywhere , you can easily get the taxi or train if you want to travel as well very nice restaurant or Cafe close by, hope i can come back again !!"
,,Worth a visit for all shoppers,4.0,,"I find it hard to figure out how to cross the roads while in Singapore. I am not a fan of having to find an underpass to cross the street. Also, housing the premium brands in the basement floors somehow doesn't suit my tastes. But in terms of sheer variety and range of premium and luxury brands, Orchard Road is second to none. It also has a good diversity of high-quality restaurants, cafes, and easy-to-access food courts. It is also carefully landscaped like most of Singapore so it's a good place to take pictures. Its prettier than Oxford Street in England or the Siam Area in Bangkok, but I find the latter more convenient. All said and done, Singapore in itself is a marvel and Orchard Road certainly contributes to making that happen."
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Nice locality with lots of shopping options, restaurants,movies,night life, convenient transportation"
,,Long and interesting walk,5.0,,For you shop lover this is a great place to walk. I suggest you to come near the evening when the weather is a bit cool and not too humid. Prepare your comfortable shoes and shirt to stroll around the road.
,,Standard high end shops selling standard high end goods,3.0,,"We went to Orchard Road hoping to see some high-end Singaporean independent fashion and craft. We saw the sort of goods sold in duty-free stores at airports all over the developed world. The prices seemed to be about 10-15% cheaper than in Sydney, so we made some purchases, but it was rather dull."
,,Still the premier shopping district in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard has stood the test of time over decades to cement itself as one of the premier shopping districts not just in Singapore but the world. It is a long stretch of malls and shops, with all kinds and budgets of retail therapy as well as F&B. It may get busy during peak periods but you do not get the claustrophobic feel as compared to some other shopping districts in the world. Be sure to take advantage of the Great Singapore Sale period too for heavily discounted prices. A tip is to dress light as Singapore can get very hot and humid. Also be prepared for rainy weather when walking from mall to mall in this tropical climate."
,,shopping,3.0,,"If shopping is your thing, there are lots of shops here in Orchard rd. It's busy and often shopping buildings are inter connected underground. Quite an adventure as to where you'll come out after an hour or so. Usually there is food halls under the buildings and access to MRT. None of it is well signed though."
,,"If you like shopping in the high end stores, this is your place.",4.0,,"Well, really nice looking street with A LOT of high end stores. If you want to spend a lot of money, then you are at the right place."
,,Great place for an evening hang out,4.0,,"Beautiful area to have a drink or dinner.
Lots of lights in the city along the streets, on the buildings, really cosmopolitan.
Lots of upmarket shops and if you are looking for reasonable prices for a meal, head to the Food courts in the shopping Malls.
Almost all big Malls have Food courts.

If you want more flash , go to hotels restaurants.
Most train stations( MRT) have shops that you can shop till you drop.
Lots of wonderful food in the train stations that link to the shopping Malls.

Just explore."
,,Busy & Interesting,5.0,,You have to see the main shopping areas in any city. Orchard road is not that different to most however you can still find some little specials here & there if you look hard.
,,Great Shopping area with many branded and departmental stores.,4.0,,"At Scott Road before turning to Orchard Road, u can see Far East Plaza and opposite is Duty Free Galleria for tourists. Next to Far East Plaza is Hyatt Hotel which has delicious and tasty high tea. Isetan is just across the road. Tangs,Ion situated on top of the Orchard MRT station, Wisma Atrium next to Takashimaya and opposite is Paragon which are all along Orchard Road. Then The Hereen has Robinson for shopping opposite is Mandarin Hotel for famous expensive chicken rice. 313,Orchard Gateway and Orchard Central are above Somerset MRT and opposite them is the Centrepoint has Metro Shopping Centre consits of 4 storeys to shop which is next along the road is OG then further down is Plaza Singapura (Dhoby Ghout MRT)."
,,"If you are a musician and are walking in Orchard road, what should you not miss.",5.0,,"You will be able to see lot of expensive shops around the place. Must take a walk along this place, it looks lovely and the orchard MRT is near by too. The shops here are pricy, so I havent actually shopped anything here. There is one place where they sell Steinway Pianos where it plays by itself without anyone playing the piano, probably check that out if you are into music."
,,Shopaholic?,5.0,,"Orchard Road Singapore is a shopping dream/nightmare. I will explain, if you are a rich man with good taste and a fashionable wife, then this is the place to visit. Prices are high, some are slightly overpriced, some prices may scare you. If you are on a budget it would be better to visit during the sales period or in January for the best deals in Singapore. If you are on a tight budget then Lucky Plaza is a great place to visit. Orchard Road has something for everyone. Rolex stores galore, Gucci, Prada, Cartier and Singapore's first Apple store. You will enjoy all the sights and shop till you drop."
,,"Yes, more Shopping",3.0,,"The area has every shop you could imagine, sometimes the same one two, three or even four times. If you are into shopping go for it, worth a quick look if you aren't into shopping. Better priced items out it the suburban areas."
,,Not Very Fun For Me,2.0,,"If you like shopping (and massive crowds), you might enjoy this area. It is nothing but malls and stores, many of which are high-end. There are some great restaurants here, but there are great restaurants everywhere in Singapore. It has been unpleasantly crowded most of the times that I have been there. (That shows I am likely in the minority here......) I don't appreciate the upside here (high-end shopping), so the downside (massive crowds) wins. Again, if you like shopping, you will probably like this area."
,,Good,4.0,,"There is so many shops & shopping centres , there is a wide variety of retailers . You would need more than one day to visit everything. After walking from one end of the road to the other i felt that i could be anywhere in the world as there was nothing special & felt that there was too many shopping centres with no character"
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,"If you are looking for retail therapy in Singapore this is where you need to hangout,but not discounting the great bars and restaurants in the area"
,,A good place for shopping and dinning,5.0,,"There are a lot of shopping malls from medium low to higher ends where you can shop according to your budget. All with very good air conditioning where you can cool down from the high temp.

For food, local food from food court , McDonald , high end dim sum , Indonesia food etc are all available"
,,Hub of the city,4.0,,"Easily accessible by bus or MRT, this is a shopper’s haven. Might be best avoided during weekends as the crowds spilling over the generous footpaths as locals relax & shop till they drop. You name it - you can buy it. Also contains hidden gems like the heritage houses on Emerald Hill Rd"
,,Never a dull moment,5.0,,Now Orchard Road is really superb. There's never a full moment here. Neither is a shopper ever unhappy. Because on Orchard Road there is something for everybody!
,,Nice Place to hangout,4.0,,"Orchard is the best place to hang out in Singapore. It is the up place. There are malls all around you. Lots of places to shop and eat. In the evening, there are stalls selling icecreams for SD 1.20. those ice creams are amazing. You will find a lot of people on orchard road in the evening doing amazing things. On weekends evenings, orchard road is a bit crowded with people (I mean in a positive sense), so you see lot of people around. Also, this place is charming and expensive."
,,Never seen so many designer shops altogether,4.0,,Very oricey compared to Europe so many high ends stores all with the same stock which you can buy in Europe cheaper. Open 24 hours but you need lots of $ to shop here
,,The Place to shop when in Singapore,5.0,,"In my early dot.com days, we’d always travel to Singapore either on the way from Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Sydney or Tokyo.....finding the shops on Orchard Road. I came cross a tailor who made suits. I enquired and had them make copy of my Gucci Suit. It was done within 24 hours delivered to my hotel and fit and looked better on me than the original....."
,,Shops shops & more shops underground,5.0,,"Plenty of shops to see, moving from one side to other side of road s easy once you’ve don’t it a couple times, you go down to go over road. All accommodations have many shopping levels underground. There are almost twice as many people underground as there is above. Amazing place very clean & organsed."
,,DONT GO TO PRADA,1.0,,"The staff at prada are extremely rude and I really hate bad service. Upon walking to the store, you don't even hear anyone greeting you but instead You are greeted with stares for the staff to judge if you have the financial capacity to buy their products solely based on how you dress and look. Very offended and upset with the service!"
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"This is a once in a lifetime experience, literally block after block of shops and major malls. Every major high end brand is represented sometimes in each mall. Go, and go back again. Oh, lots of great eateries too."
,,Great shopping area!,4.0,,"Be sure to visit this area during your stay in Singapore. There are all the big brand names and lots of glitz. On the day I visited, there was a line to get into the Chanel boutique with an attendant letting a few people at a time in. But, there is a mall off to the side where you can find some of the cheapest goods ever. Cash only!"
,,feedback on request from tripadvisor,3.0,,"Orchard Road is about 2km long and internationally branded products are sold in different department stores. The whole length has nice walking path for a good stroll.
Things are a bit expensive because it is a high end area. However good food is available at reasonable price including hawker style stalls at wisma atria. There are three mrt stations and many bus services serving the area. It is a famous shopping area since 1980's and area had transformed very much. At one end near dhoby gaut mrt station is the istana (official residence of singapore president) and at the other end near orchard mrt station you are near botanical gardens which is about 0.7 km away."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Use your time elsewhere if on a limited schedule. Very expensive and nothing too exciting. I did find a nail/massage place which was reasonably priced which made it worthwhile. Lots of places to get suits and alterations, but go to the older looking buildings for these."
,,Short Stay,4.0,,great shopping experience -many old and established malls and new high end malls -something for everyone-would recommend to avoid Sunday shopping as the housemaids have their day off and congregate in the streets greatly increasing human street congestion -we had kids and a pram so made it more challenging though alternatively does add to the atmosphere and vibe of the place- depending on your taste
,,Cheers to Singapore glow,5.0,,"Orchard is Singapore's offering for the international traveler. With shops offering internationally acclaimed brands, sumptuous food, and a generally lively nightlife, it is sometimes a bit nauseating. But hey, YOLO, right?"
,,Useless place to visit,2.0,,"The world has changed Orchard Rd has not !

The shopping malls are obsolete and expensive the building by now old and not interesting from a design point of view.

The road is busy with tourists looking for bargains - but you find those on Amazon !

Why bother ? An area that Singapore must rethink and change will take time - the visitor should not waste his here."
,,Expensive shopping,5.0,,Definitely worth a visit - very expensive high end stores. If you've got coin then no problem - definitely worth seeing 6 Gucci stores within a 5 kms radius.
,,Nice ambiance,5.0,,Be here for a nice shopping experience Tashikimaya mall had sale. Too crowded Paragon mall was good. Super dry store is good
,,Great shopping,5.0,,If you are a shopper then you will love this road. Its like time square NY was dipped in bleach and given a facelift .
,,Amazing shopping area in Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Road comprises a series of amazing shopping malls where you can find from the most expensive brands to the accessible shops.

,,NICE EVENING STROLL,4.0,,"Visited Orchard Road a number if times, on weekdays and on Sunday.

The place is very good for a evening stroll, window-shopping and is always crowded. The Sunday-crowd is mostly of the tourists and Indonesian / Filipino Maids enjoying one-day holiday from work.

All major brands have outlets in the Malls of Orchard Road,

The place is easily approachable by MRT, Bus and Cabs"
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,A fantastic place to visit but certainly not cheap. If you want designer wear etc buy in Europe. The malls are something like we’ve never experienced before and are beautifully designed.
,,Tourist paradise,5.0,,Loved walking on Orchard Row and seeing the branded high end stores. Lots of malls with food courts. Just and lively.
,,PLACE FOR CHRISTMAS,5.0,,"We were about 25 days prior to Christmas, but even then we could feel the vibration and preparations for the Christmas and New Year celebrations. The entire place was decked up ready for Christmas. Beautiful to look at and best visited in the night."
,,Beats 5th Avenue & Oxford street.,5.0,,"This street has so many restaurants, shops and malls. It caters for all budgets. We ate underground at a food court - 5 stories down. Amazing food and juices."

,,High end Shopping and also on a budget shops,5.0,,We loved walking on Orchard Road and seeing all Posh shops and lights at night made it magickal! Must see! Great places to eat and many places to stop and cool off from the warm weather for a nice drink.
,,The Place Where You Wanna Be,3.0,,"Fellow Filipinos out there: If you're going to visit Singapore anytime soon, don't forget to drop by in this area since the mall where most Filipinos hang-out is located here. (Also, we bought almost half of our souvenirs in that mall since it was the cheapest compared to others).

Honestly, we (together with my companions) never got a chance to explore Orchard Road since we only went there to visit the mall that I was saying a while ago. But as we were travelling, and base on the reviews or what I heard from other travellers, you can find/do lots of things here. A bookshop (which I really regretted since I didn't get a chance to visit it) which offers special edition books at a reasonable price can be found here; affordable hotels are also located here; and lots of food and other establishments are here.

So next time you'll visit Singapore, or if you will visit Singapore for the first time, include Orchard Road in your itinerary and explore it to find real gems."
,,Great shopping street,5.0,,We stayed on Orchard Rd and it really is the most magnificent shopping street I have seen. So many shopping centres with high end labels from around the world. A shopping paradise. Just dont expect to get anything cheap.

,,"Impressing, ok. But what else?",3.0,,"If you are into shopping, it is definitely the place to be in SG. But otherwise, it is just always very busy and loud. Not exactly my dream. There is so much more to experience in SG..."
,,Delightful surprise,5.0,,"Never did we expect to see so much in so little time. So what that it rained outside... we just went inside and spent most of the day browsing, shopping and the like. Worth it!!"
,,Not what it used to be,3.0,,"We first visited Singapore in 1988 & 1991. In that day Orchard Road was lined with high-rise shopping malls PACKED with vendors selling everything from tailor made clothing to leather goods and electronics. It was loud, it was personal, and it was an awesome experience unique from anything you’d find in Western nations.

Now (2018) most of that experience is gone. If you want 300 stores selling Chanel, Gucci or Rolex then sure, it’s all right here but frankly I leave the West to get away from superficial junk, not to see more of it. McDonalds, Starbucks, Universal Studios...it’s everywhere.

If you believe spending a lot of money makes you more important, you can waste money till your credit card melts on Orchard Road! If you’re looking for a far more cultural and immersive experience, go to Little India and/or Arab Street and/or Chinatown. Orchard Road is beautiful to look at but it’s nothing you can’t see in any other big city."

,,The local shopping place...,4.0,,"I had kept hearing about Orchard Road from people before we went so thought we would check it out. If you are happy to buy from Gucci, Fendi, Tiffany's etc then this is the place for you. We walked along Orchard Road mostly just to look at the outside of the shopping centre..Glass panels everywhere - really pretty.We could not afford to shop there and actually didn't miss doing that (I'm not a brand/label gal!) but at least I can say I've been to Orchard Road!"
,,Shopping,2.0,,"Probably great if you love shopping and malls, I don't. I heard people in China Town and Kampong Glam say how Orchard Road is an expensive place.

,,Nice place to walk around,5.0,,"I enjoyed walking along orchard rd. Make sure to eat the Selecta ice cream wrap with a choice of sliced bread or wafer for S$1.20.

You should buy your goodies in Lucky Plaza, way cheaper than Bugis and chinatown for key chains, ref magnets etc. There is a Chocolate Factory inside the mall."
,,Shop and shop,4.0,,There are many shopping arcades and you can spend hours there. There are nice restaurants inside most of the shopping malls.
,,One of the nicest Shopping areas in Singapore.,4.0,,"Nice Shopping malls, lucky plaza is a great place to browse and Shop.

Used to be the ""shopping Mecca"" of Sing. Now people have many options. Also quite famous among expats as the ""pick-up"" area.

Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise. It could easily take you all day to window shop. There are also a few malls - each having yet more shops and food courts.

Singapore is quite an expensive city - so you need to have quite a lot of money to enjoy your ""retail therapy"". There is a saying ""Shop till you drop"". This is very true when you shop in the shops lining Orchard Road."
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,So many different shops to choose from and they are not all really expensive. Really easy to walk around and is very safe.

,,Extensive range of 'sophisticated' shops,3.0,,"The Orchard Road Shopping Precinct is very extensive and mainly caters for ""High-end"" - ""Mid-range"" shopping. Access is from 3 MRT stations so shoppers need to be aware of the particular location of any store that they are looking to visit before arriving. Although there is access to an extensive number of shopping plazas and shops, i thought that it was too strung out along Orchard Road, and preferred ambiance and prices of village shopping precincts like Chinatown and Bugis."
,,shopping and dining orchard,4.0,,"when in singapore, don’t miss out on fabulous things this street offers. from bargain items to high-end brands, orchard road has it. just be prepared with your budget because even if some items are not on your shopping list, you’ll end up buying them anyway.

A lot of people , just bring water with you or you can always stop every where to buy yourself an ice cold drink or food.

,,Shopper's Stop,4.0,,You could spend hours on Orchard road and still won't get enough of it. Tons of shops and malls and stuff. The only place in Singapore which women love the most. Gets very much crowded on weekends. Solid bargains but quite boring if you're a man like me who hates to shop and walk around for hours. But the street has certainly all varieties of items and so many distinct things to offer. Happy Shopping!

,,Exclusive shopping is judged,4.0,,"No trip to Singapore is complete without some time on Orchard Road. We started our shopping excursion at Takashimaya Centre and were wowed by the shops and comfort of the location. It's so nice to be able to stroll through high end boutiques and browse ideas for vacation purchases. Yes, we were dressed down, to combat the heat and cultural sensitivities, but at one of our favourite 5th Avenue ""shops"" to be directed away from the ""fine jewellery floor, to the floor below where we sell costume jewellery"" is located, was a surprise to this repeat customer. Not to be outdone, this happened at another close by clothing store. Orchard Road is clean, easy to get around, and those Singaporean businesses have local culture embedded in their business model."

Aircon all the way, nice"

,,A plethora of Shopping centres,5.0,,Among the best of the shopping strips in the world. Bags are now full and we are heading home but we will be back.
,,High end shops,2.0,,I’m afraid we didn’t find Orchard Rd a ‘must do’ attraction. It’s full of high end shops and unless you have unlimited funds it’s of little interest. There are all the usual shops but it’s expensive. We won’t bother with it again.
,,So much shopping!,4.0,,"Orchard road is something to explore! There’s shopping mall after shopping mall! Lots of luxury mixed with high street stores. A lot of them are connected underneath, and if you go to the lower floors you’ll find cheap eats. Worth a look and great to shop at!"

,,Neat if you want to buy a terribly gaudy handbag designed by an Italian with a warped sense of humor!!,3.0,,Goodness - who buys this horrible stuff that these high end stores have for sale - surely they are just joking with their prices and must have a wicked sense of humor to think that anybody with any taste would want to buy the overpriced nonsense that they have in their stores.

,,Professional tourists!!!,5.0,,"The heading may sound amusing but I feel I am qualified to give myself this title!!
We have been visiting this city for the past 20 years & therefore know it in & out!!
In fact I always think of offering my services as The short cut queen of Orchard road to first time visitors!!
In fact to navigate the maze & plethora of stores , arcades, malls& boutiques - a guide would surely come handy. But for the first time visitor to Orchard - it can be pretty bewildering!! Choices aplenty, confusion could reign supreme! But the true shopper is spoilt for choice!!!
For the ladies- shoes, bags, accessories, makeup —- everything is there in multiples. For the man- sports goods, sneakers, expensive & inexpensive fashion, barbers, tailors & leather— nothing is missing. Household stores are expensive but plenty. Every international brand is there for the taking. It’s best to start way up at Tanglin Mall - just after the beautiful Botanical Gardens& slowly wind ones way down to Singapura Plaza at Dhobi Ghaut. Style mile to say the least!!The other end of Orchard!
These days the malls I would highly recommend— not to be missed- Tanglin Mall for Europeon stores- British India,baby stores, fashion , stationery& the House of Ann Li - for home decor & a quick bite, Forum- for Eyewear, children’s high end clothes boutiques, Watson’s, Toys r Us & Jamie Oliver’s.
Hilton’s shopping gallery- go ogle the high end stores like Italiandesigner jewels, Ezmes French swimwear!
Then Wheelock place for a huge Marks & Spencer’s outlet, an Apple store& service centre, Zara, Massimo Dutti & plenty of hair salons, nail spas & Browhaus! On the opposite side is Shaw Centre with Isetan , Ralph Lauren & one of the best multi plexes of this city. Continuing on the same pavement- via the underpass , the iconic CK Tangs& the glittering new Scott’s. Eat at the Wild honey outlet there for sure & check out Michael Kors latest offerings!! Continue down to Paragon- skipping the ‘downmarket ‘Lucky Plaza— totally avoidable unless u are looking for Western Union money transfer!!
Paragon is hip & happening with an amazing choice of cuisines in the basement! Ogle at Choo, Prada,Dior, Ferragamo & eat at PS Cafe on level 2. Marks & Spencer’s & Metro both tempt for practical everyday dressing.
Across the road , Ion, Wisma Atria & Ngee Ann city are not to be missed!!
And this brings us only to the middle of Orchard Road!! Beverly Hills Rodeo Drive pales in comparison!!
But that will occupy another review on Orchard Road. Don’t want to exhaust the reader into inertia!!!"
,,Lots to choose from,4.0,,Like shopping? Go to Orchard. You will have lots to choose from- from known high street international brands to high end luxury brands to local Singaporean brands.
,,Expensive,2.0,,"I find this area far too expsensive, even in the non-fashion-house shops (normal shops to you and me) and really quite souless. But this is the life young people chase. They will realise material possesions are pointless when they suddenly realise they can't afford to buy a house - joke is on them!"
,,Branded items,5.0,,You can find many branded shop and items here.. Not for budget traveller but still fun to visit.. Many shoping mall offered different discount.. You mighy get lucky
,,Vibrant,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a hype of activity with high end to high street shopping. You will find everything you need here, with so much choice and some great bargains if you look. Love it’s vibrancy in the evening and somerset@313 is well worth a visit near the MRT station. Some really nice restaurants here and great shopping all under one roof. In the evening this place comes alive, and it’s a fabulous atmosphere and an obviously popular meeting place. Worth a visit"
,,Well its ORCHARD,4.0,,"This is a long winding road full with malls. If you are looking for branded products, any products..... you can find it right here. The best thing about Orchars is you can always have a second option for one product. So as long as you want to spent sometime to browse arround there, i know you will find something you like."
,,Not for me,3.0,,Ok for the rich and famous. Like a mini New York or LA. I would think the malls with aircon and no traffic would be much more preferred by many. Ok if there is one specific store you want to see.
,,Vijay Kaul,5.0,,"Always a great place to walk around anytime of the day. Shops, shops and more shops. Lots of restaurants too. Enjoyed walking in Paragon Mall, Wisma Atria Mall, Abercrombie Shop, Apple Shop (you can get free wifi while you are in the store), Takashimaya Mall.....enjoy shopping, window shopping and a huge range of food every where. Saw a great Japanese Food Court in Wisma Atria as well, will eat there next time. Enjoy lovely Singapore."
,,Too expensive,3.0,,Last time I was in Singapore Orchard rd was exciting and fun. This time it was like a mini New York with top class stores for the person who has money. If you are going there for bargain shops think again. It was fun to see and felt like we were on an American trip.
,,Shop to you drop..but,3.0,,"An absolute abundance of shops and a shoppers paradise. For me a little ho hum and something I tired of pretty quickly. I prefer I think if I have to do the shopping trek one of the super sized indoor malls. The heavy traffic, the waiting ages for traffic lights and probably just the noise overall did not appeal to any great extent with me."
,,A visit to Singapore must include Orchard Road,5.0,,"I've been travelling to Singapore for more than 30 years and never get tired of Orchard Road, it's the heart of the city. Great restaurants, cafes and shopping the full length of the road. I'd also recommend trying the fabulous ice cream in rainbow bread you can get n the street corners for $1.20. Don't knock it until you've tried it. Sweet corn ice cream is my favourite!"
,,"Money, money, money",3.0,,"Beautiful road, loads of shops and malls, friendly people - perfect for window shopping. For shopping, it is better to seek advice from locals, we did, from Lidy who works for the Tourist Information Centre on Orchard Road. She guided us very well after asking our kids ages and our interests and told us which place to visit and when (we did not know that Monday and Tuesday are the days both the Domes at Gardens by the Bay close consecutively). Also invited us for a quick taste of Singaporean tidbits, at a food festival being celebrated at the centre the very next day.
All in all, an interesting road but not for a lousy shopper like me,"
,,Good area for walking around,4.0,,Excellent area for window shopping at all the malls and even cheap shopping at Lucky Plaza. The walkways underground link most shopping centres from orchard mrt to somerset mrt.
,,Champs Elysses of Singapore,5.0,,"You name it and multiple Showrooms of that Luxury brand, you will find on this road. In terms of Luxury Shopping, I will rate it notch above Champs Elysses"
,,A shopping Experience not to be missed,4.0,,Orchard Road is the place if you want shopping everything is here from all of your designer Stores to H& M plenty of top Hotels & Restaurants but make sure you have plenty of cash ! There is also good old Marks & Spencer's if you are really homesick.
,,Shopping Shopping & More Shopping,4.0,,"It's a good place to go if you love shopping but if you don't then stay away. The length of Orchard Road is now almost wall to wall malls. Many with the same shops being repeated and with all the international quality and luxury brands being available.
Well designed and very attractive malls/shops. But you need to enjoy shopping - I sit and play Sudoku whilst my wife browses !!"

,,The Orchard. Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road Singapore is where one could find famous branded goods and local brands by local designers. Lavin, Gucci, Cartier, Victoria Secrets, H&M, Zara & Forever 21 just to name a few. Not only clothing, a wide range and selections of food also could be found in almost all shopping area where one could be spoilt for choice.

After a couple of hours we headed for the ION Orchard complex on Orchard Road (near the center and then went exploring all the amazing food stalls on the lower floors. An amazing selection of cuisine and very affordable ($5 to $10 range). We can imagine a person could easily spend a week in Orchard Road just by itself, and probably still not see it all, but we only had a week and there is so much else to explore in Singapore. Well worth including on your list of things to do."
,,Retail therapy,4.0,,"Great variety of goods, can be a bit pricey on some things. Food choice is wonderful, lovely ambience. One way street system means a little walk to get a bus going in the opposite direction and underpass system can be frustrating."

We can do and find everything we want within a walking distance. We can have breakfast, lunch, dinner at anywhere, anytime and anything we want a long the Orchard road. We can buy anything we are looking for in Orchard road. Sometimes after we bought so many things during the Great Singapore Sale, we can just easily put the things at the hotel we stay, Mandarin Hotel, and continue exploring anything we want to go and find along Orchard road, until we were tired and went back to the hotel to take rest and continue our trip the next morning . This is one of the best best reason why we like to visit Singapore every year"

It's not the Asian cheap paradise it once was but it's comparable to Australia and not too silly. Unless of course you are after Luxury and Pada or Gucci is your thing. In that case good luck! A for the length of the street the food is cheap and oh my is it GOOD! can't go wrong but i recommend the food court/hawker centre in the Ion centre - a beautiful place and a wondrous choice. I reckon you need a year to see this properly. And you don't need to spend much, there are enough samples and things to see to keep everyone amused."

,,Love Singapore,5.0,,Beautiful clean neat and tidy main street for the shoppers. I defy you to find any litter anywhere. Great shopping and heaps of cafes and restaurants to choose from.
,,Buzzling area in SG,4.0,,A very busy area during the weekends and there's loads of brands for you to choose from. Even better during the night as you'll get to see random performances that is so exciting! Fun experience with my family! Thank you!
,,Lots of shops,4.0,,There were lots of shops there hence its reputation for the shopping district of Singapore. One of the biggest and great shopping centres was Takeshima where all of the brands are and there are usually great discounts. Nice place to go for shopping and that's about it.
,,The place to be,4.0,,"I suppose your trip to Singapore won't be complete without dropping by Orchard Road where you get to feel the hussle of the Singaporean life. So we did drop by to enjoy the Christmas decoration in December. It's nice to walk along the Orchard road. Am not really into shopping but I suppose if you are going to shop, this is the place for it too."
,,Malling Time,5.0,,"Malls are lined side by side along Orchard Road. Visited three malls: IMM Outlet Mall, Lucky Plaza,and ION Orchard. I didn't shop and spend much, because what they have there are what we have also here in the U.S. and I can say that it's a lot cheaper in our place here in Chicago. But we had lunch at Popeyes-Louisiana Chicken and another lunch on a different date in Jollibee in Lucky Plaza."
,,Immaculate,5.0,,An amazing road. One of the nicest looking and well set out streets I have ever seen. No potholes or rubbish visible. The trees and plants are well manicured and serene. And then there’s the high end and low end shopping. I have never seen anything like it. Countless brands from all over the world in usually free standing buildings or in the numerous shopping centers on either side of the road. If the weather is too hot for you then walk underground where it’s another world of shopping. Wow! You gotta see this. Kilometers of shops in air conditioned comfort. A must when visiting Singapore.
,,shop till you drop..,5.0,,"Paragon shopping center has a great food court.. high end stuff at the bottom level, cheaper as you head up the levels.."

,,Shop 'til you drop!,4.0,,"So many shops, so little time. Orchard Road is home to quite a number of shopping Malls all housing your classic designer wear. To be honest, what's in one large Mall is in all of them and at very silly prices. Having said that, it is a fantastic road to walk along and experience the buzz.
Drift off into the side streets and you savour some of the 'normal' shops where you can start bargaining."
,,Shopping freaks - visit this place,5.0,,if you are a shopping freak and want to spend lavishly then one must visit Orchard Road. Apple products can be best buy with a good margin in cost.
,,Window shop till you drop,3.0,,"Our hotel was right next to Orchard Road, so we decided to go for a nice air-conditioned escape from the heat of Singapore. However, there is really nothing special to shop here. Almost all of the stores are ones you can find in America, most of it is extremely expensive, and, like someone else mentioned, once you've seen one of the malls/department stores, you've seen them all. I think the only store we bought something at was Uniqlo, which is really affordable if the item is on sale. In general, if you're a fan of 5th Avenue, this is pretty much the same thing, although perhaps with better food (grab some Old Chang Kee curry puffs to make up for all those calories you burned walking or maybe the classic ice cream with bread to cool down)."
,,Leading Shopping Area In Singapore for Higher End Products,4.0,,"This is the place most tourist to Singapore will come. Many high end designer shops, luxury hotels and lots of food. If you come to Singapore worth a visit to Orchard Road, you can do some shopping site seeing and have a meal.

,,shopping central,4.0,,very crowded but found all we were after lots of places to eat as well . As well as markets and pubs
,,Multi Storey Shopping Mall Mecca,3.0,,"Orchard Road is truly a shop-a-holics paradise. Shopping centre after shopping centre lining both sides of this lengthy road all trying to entice the tourist to part with their hard-earned dollars.

,,The place to be,5.0,,"I love this busy road with its many shops, restaurants and hotels. You can feel the vibration of the city there. There are mostly the international luxury chains but also cute street cafes and nice restaurants. It is nice to walk up or down the street and just enjoy the feeling."

For budget shopping can go to Lucky plaza and Far east plaza. Luck plaza is mostly souvenier shopping and few shops for clothes.
Prive sells amazing non flour banana toast which is opposite yotel. Although almost all places are pram friendly it was easier and faster without a pram unless your child wouldnt walk.
Orchard has an organic restaurant called Real food best thai food for vegeterians. Really cosy atmosphere worth a try.
The handmade croissant bakery is also amazing but a bit expensive but Singapore itself is very expensive.."
,,Em's on Tour,4.0,,"Always the retail centre of Singapore. Much is now high end boutiques with only a few plazas to grab your bargain shopping. A very busy district - people, cars and public transport all add to the busy vibe this quarter has to offer.

,,Expensive shopping,4.0,,"Orchard road is full of big shopping malls filled with high end stores. The street is always very busy and is great fun to walk around and listen to the street performers and look at the arched tire of ion orchard mall and all of the fun activities and statues that are displayed along the street! There is always something going on here, so it’s fun to visit, but can get pretty overwhelming quickly as people are always in a hurry and there’s much going on.

Many companies advertise along he street especially when new big movies are about to release and we visited when the Grand Prix was going on and close to Christina’s so there was a lot going on at those times.

Many tours will drop bus loads of shopping tourists to department stores, locals work and shop here so it can be very congested.

This road contains all the big names in Fasion business like Prada, Gucci, Ralph Lauren, etc. It was very well organised and clean. But I found too much smoking here and felt a little nausea as I was a non smoker. Nonetheless, if you are rich and you are in Singapore, Orchard road is the place to go for shopping.

,,Too much of the same... But still worth the effort,3.0,,"I find Orchard Road alive with people rushing around and at times can be rather difficult to navigate if you are trying to get from one side of the road to the other. However having said that it is a great place to experience. Shopping can be very expensive and I find that there are a lot of the 'same' type of shops. Unfortunately if you are looking for larger size clothes Orchard Road is not the place to shop. There are a number of good places to eat, but again can be quite expensive. You have to visit at least once."

The Tourist Bureau has an office here. You might get some brochures or have a question answered... and they have a small Merlion. Takashimaya has a very good bookstore (Kinokuniya) up a couple of storeys. They have magazines, fiction and non-fiction in English, Chinese, Malay and Japanese. In the basement they have a comprehesive food court. 'Carrot cake' (made with radishes, not carrots) is a trendy food which you can find here. Personally I prefer the noodles in the Tsurukoshi stall. There's an Old Chang Kee outlet on Orchard Road; specialising in curry puffs at $1.50 a pop. They are absolutely delicious! Aside from being something that every tourist does... and being a good long walk, you'd be better off shopping in Holland Village where the expats go."

,,My favourite place in the world,5.0,,"Orchard Road is my favourite place in the world. We lived just off Orchard road near Paragon for over 2 years and I loved it. I loved walking up and down Orchard road. A lot of the shopping malls and MRT stations are all connected together so it is all air conditioned all the way through...... I love 313 Republic food court on the 5th floor as it has very good food like Monster Curry and Teppaniyaki.....all very good prices...lots of seats.....great open space....

Lots of restaurants to choose from very expensive like Lawry’s Or Wild Honey to very good value like Monster Curry......

There is something for everyone.... “paragon mall” has a nice playground on the 5th floor for children.... 313 has a nice playground on the roof on 5th floor outside the food court for children...... lots of children’s shops and for adults too.... so many coffee shops and bakeries..... Supermarkets like Cold Storage and Food Hall in Takashimaya and Paragon and CentrePoint......
All fast food places available: MacDonalds, Burger King, Mos Burger......

Toast box is one of my favourite places to eat and it’s everywhere like in CentrePoint, Paragon (outside opposite Mount Elizabeth Hospital), Wisma....

Department stores like Metro, Robinson’s, Isetan, Takashimaya, Tang.......all excellent....

Lots of pharmacies (like Guardian and Watson’s)...... very good one in Paragon and 313 and a huge Guardian and Watson’s in Ngee Ann City.....
Absolutely love the B2 floor of Takashimaya as it has all sorts of foods and bakeries and a market in the middle which changes every 2 weeks/monthly (not sure)..... last week it was a baby market and we were able to buy all sorts of things at great prices.....last time it was a “luggage” market and back in August it was a mooncake market.

There is a cinema and a big trampoline place just off Orchard road near 313.....
Another cinema next to Isetan.....

Lots of hotels in and around Orchard road.... our favourite hotel where we always stay is Mandarin Orchard because of its perfect location next toTakashimaya....l

Highly recommend Orchard Road..... my favourite place in the world..... no need to go anywhere else a as you can find everything in Orchard Road.....I could live in Orchard Road forever.....

1 week is never enough for us just for Orchard Road....."

,,Loads of big malls but difficult to navigate,4.0,,"There are some big and beautiful malls on this road. However, it is one of the most difficult roads to navigate for a newcomer.

A great day’s activity with every shop your heart could desire!"
,,For the shoppers,5.0,,"Of course Orchard Road is a must for anyone who loves shopping. All the major high street brand names are there as well as mid-range shops. If you are wanting to get away from the heat, then visit one of the many underground shopping malls. You need at least two days to do the whole of Orchard Road if you want to visit all the shops."
,,Great shopping experience,5.0,,Orchard road shopping was one of the fabulous memories that we carried from the tour. You get products for all pocket sizes. The ambience was electrifying with people playing instruments on the streets and wonderful lighting all around. Takashimaya and Ion Orchard malls were fantastic. The food court below Ion orchard was one of the best I have ever seen with lots of budget friendly options. But remember to finish your dinner by 9:30 after which you will hardly find any counters open.

In the end, we found what we were looking for and got to walk in the shade of trees when we came out of the stores. What surprised us was the birds singing in the evening, they were really loud and it was nice to see them getting ready for sleep. Otherwise, here you can find a place to eat and relax after you get tired of walking around. It is also nice to window-shop the luxury items that even if you buy some there is a small chance of using them. But they look damn nice. Offer in shops here is special, just like Singapore itself. To find out more about special places that we found in Singapore head to our blog page WNFdiary."

,,Still worth the visit.,3.0,,Many years ago when we first started visiting Singapore we would stay at Orchard Road end of town. More recently we have started to stay at the ‘newer’ end of the City.

,,Busy place,4.0,,"THE shopping street of Singapore. All the posh brands are here - interesting for its architecture, not so much the stores...same as everywhere else. Sundays are very crowded (all the helpers are off on Sundays) but also the most interesting day to watch people and enjoy the whole scenario."
,,Good but not excellent,4.0,,"I suppose that city authority should make a dozen or two spots on this road where people could have a rest - small sitting places with a trees/bushes around, with small installations, with small fountains, flowers etc.
It would make Singapore and it's main road more attractive for tourists and citizens, more remarkable and memorable.
If they hire me, I could make dozens of such small memorable places (I can work for free, without any payment, just because I love Singapore)."
,,Buzzing Orchard Road,4.0,,Orcahrd Road is great when you have teens who love shopping and people watching. So many shops to choose from! The traffic can be bad on peak hours though.

,,Great shopping,5.0,,Great place to walk around with your wife if she loves her shopping . Make sure you have your walking shoes on 2.2kms of shops
,,Singapore Shopping,3.0,,Unfortunately Orchard Road didn't do much for me. The shopping was quite expensive and there are just too many people for my liking
,,Orchard Road Singapore,4.0,,"I recently went on a business trip to Singapore and stayed at the Grand Orchard hotel located within meters away from the very famous Orchard Road. If you are a shoppaollic then your eyes will light up like a Christmas tree when you step into that road. It has all the great brands from LV, Guess, MK, Nike,etc., with shops the size of mini malls. Yes that too...lots and lots of different types of shopping malls, great eating spots to sample Singaporean cuisine as well as local supermarkets like Cold Storage where you can shop like the locals. Visiting the supermarkets is perhaps where you may find yourself realizing that Singapore can and most probably is a very expensive place. Fantastic ...however very expensive. And yes I am speaking for myself only coming from South Africa where the Singapore dollar is 10 times stronger than the South African rand. Basic things like bottled water and soft drinks can cost a pretty penny. Again I have to stress that it all depends on how deep your pockets are and what type of traveler you are. There are many other places where you can get good deals and some outlet malls but you just have to ask your hotel. Some of the malls are open till really late and even 24 hours for those insomniacs. The street is designed for tourists so you will never run out of things to do and see. And what's great about this street is that you can walk everywhere. It's like getting a double dose of goodness with retail therapy and exercise...LOL. May for Singapore is a bit of rainy season which is also perfect as it lowers the heat and humidity factors...please note it will still be but not as bad. So if you on your way to Singapore, enjoy your stay and I hope that you brought enough spending money....remember to pase yourself as orchard road is long and lots of shopping to be done."
,,"""Oxford Street"" Singapore",5.0,,"A Serious Shoppers paridise, My credit card went into meltdown here I've never seen such a large collection of designer shops, and some very good restaurants, Essex girls eat your heart out."

,,Great variety of shopping for all budgets,4.0,,"Great variety of shopping for all budgets. There's Lucky Plaza, regular shops and high end shops with cafes in between.
Best of all the staff at high end retail staff were equally friendly and attentive to myself and partner wearing daggy T-shirt jeans and runners as they were to customers wearing high end fashion, it was a refreshing change to the high end retail staff in Australia who sadly look down and frown at those who don't fit the mould."
,,Expensive shopping,5.0,,"Very expensive shopping in Singapore. The buildings were built downwards, nice architecture. A must visit in Singapore too."
,,A Shopper's Heaven,5.0,,This strip really does have it all! From luxury European brands to the best of the Far East. It's almost embarrassing how much choice you have on Orchard Road. My tip is to make sure your credit card doesn't have any limits - you'll need all the credit you can get in this shopper's heaven!!
,,Central road of the city,4.0,,"This road is a long road with all the best and biggest malls. You can do anything in and around this area. Centrally located and accessible by MRT. There are 3 MRT stations on this road itself. You can imagine how long it is. Each mall has its own attractions. Some have live shows; some are good for movies, some for spa. The possibilities are endless. The Singapore visitor centre is a white building on this road. Not sure why would people need to go there but people do. I spent 2-3 min there.
The road has some of the finest eating places. One must try place is “Din taifan “. It’s a Michelin star outlet and lives upto the name. A foodies paradise. Be aware; it’s pricy but worth every penny.
Another must visit breakfast place is Wild honey. Amazing food. I advice you to book in advance as it’s generally packed. Incase you did not book; don’t worry. It opens up in 15-20 min.
The nightlife around this area is great. Too many to choose from. No specific recommendations. Alcohol is expensive in Singapore. So be prepared to spend.
For economical eating options; every MRT station has food outlets at the basement level. Tons of options. All malls have similar options.
Go explore."

,,Lunch Walk,5.0,,"One of the most famous streets in Singapore and where most fashion houses are located. Its also the happening place in Singapore and it would be a shame to miss a stroll from one end to the other,although it could be rather warm on a sunny day.

,,Just shopping malls,3.0,,"We went to Orchard road with the impression it was more than just shopping malls, but it wasn’t really. Lots of shops though, and I expect great for locals, just not much for English tourists. I have scored this as a tourist attraction and not on the shops/ malls themselves, they were impressive."
,,High quality,5.0,,High end shops....High end malls must visit in Singapore..... Excellent coffee and munch shops which have Street seating too
,,High end shopping,3.0,,"Your perspective on this area will really depend on your taste in shopping. You will probably go anyway because of the hype.

,,Shopping destination with the occasional sidewalk performer,3.0,,"If you're into high-end shopping, then this is your place. Otherwise, there's not much to do other than walk, window shop, shop and watch the sidewalk performers do their thing. Although, the sidewalk performers do have interesting acts, etc. It was just another place to tick off on our list for Singapore."
,,SHOPPING !!!!!,5.0,,"Shop till u dead here at orchard road. that sums the place :) ther are few road side eateries in front of new malls, keep yourself hydrated and continue shopping !!"
,,An average shopping destination,3.0,,"Could have been a great place a few years back but now almost all parts of the world has great shoppers area, malls etc. Orchard road in that sense is average, but then again walk around for the nostalgia this iconic place brings."
,,Must Try - Ice Cream Sandwich,5.0,,"Nothing much to describe a shopping/walking/hanging out main street in SG downtown apart from trying the ice cream sandwich.

OK. I may be a bit bias due to easily get gastritis and traveller diarrhoea especially if I eat food or fruits sold at the road side.

So trying ice cream sandwich in SG becomes relatively more assuring as we know SG is still quite reputable in this aspect. (I did make declaration opinions are super duper subjective :P as well as the term ""relatively"" is adopted here during elaboration.

I had two while my friend and I sat on the stairs outside one of the mall.. i had DURIAN ice cream sandwich, just in case you will ask which flavour.

then we went on to Bar on 5, Mandarin Oriental for whiskey.. :)"

,,Nice,4.0,,Really nice shopping mile Mostly for high standard brands but in the lower levels also affordable. Still a nice flair to stroll
,,Makes no sense to walk!,1.0,,"Orchard road is peppered with all the big brand stores. Not a good place to take a stroll as it's just a long walk with nothing to do unless you intend to buy from one of those stores. Just a boring long walk.

Fantastic underpasses for crossing roads, and amazing malls. Ion mall was my personal favourite, but make sure to head outside to truly grasp how big this area is!"
,,Hot and noisy,2.0,,I suppose everyone should visit this iconic Singaporean street at least once. But once was probably enough. This was my third visit and I should have shown more sense. Fumes from traffic and cigarette smoke overwhelmed me. Nothing is much different from previous visits.
,,Great architecture,5.0,,Went walking around this area and it was fabulous to see how clean and well maintained this was. The architecture is well designed and fits well within the Bay Area. Plenty of shade and eateries along with information signs to help tourists. Plenty of boutiques for the avid shopper so lots to do and see.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,This place has every and anything you want or need. It has from high end shops to bargain shops. Lots of places to eat as well.
,,Busy Orchard,3.0,,"Busy roads, busy people.. Had fun walking and window-shopping. Shopping mall items are too expensive, I encourage to save your cash to some unique but affordable souvenirs😅."
,,The longest road,4.0,,"We walked up and down Orchard Road, so many shops a lot of top end shops which we didn’t venture into as the prices were so over the top. The streets are so wide it was immaculatey clean you need hours to see all the shops and browse we did find some economical shops where we bought some clothes it was good to see the different variety. The sales staff were great very friendly and helpful, enjoyed the shopping and wow the food was terrific. Would recommend the walk even though we were exhausted by the end of the day, so hot but enjoyable."
,,Last minute shopping,4.0,,"We spent our last day in Singapore shopping at Orchard Road. looking for last minute gift ideas.. It was raining pretty hard at times, so thank goodness we spent most of the day indoors."
,,"Shopping at malls, branded showrooms",4.0,,"This is the place to shop in malls, showrooms. And there are a lot of fine dine places to eat as well. Reaching here is easy, MRT station connects to ION mall here. At evening, the place is lit up and looks good."
,,The iconic ice cream,5.0,,"Orchard road is one one the place you need to visit when you are in Singapore. One one the busiest part of the whole country and i can say it is the ""new york"" of Singapore.

One thing i always have in orchard is the 1 dollar ice cream. It is just iconic and has been known since a long time ago. Must try!"
,,Super shopping,5.0,,"Great place to shop. Every high end store you can think of is here. I shopped at Under Armor and the prices were as expected, expensive. If you are looking to save cash you do not want to shop at Orchard Road but if you want to spend money and insist on high quality this is this place for you."
,,SHOPPING AND MORE SHOPPING,5.0,,great place to wander - brilliant variety of shops but amazing buildings including the presidents palace - lots to see and buy and do.
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"A great place to visit if you like shopping. High end stores mingle with local department stores. This may not be a place for bargain hunters though as there are mostly mainstream shops. Some of the buildings are beautiful to look at architecturally, and the area itself feels very safe to walk around. We were close enough at Clarke Quay to walk to Orchard Road but MRT, taxi or Uber are all available. Takashimaya was probably our pick out of all the centres we visited. We enjoyed all the food options available in the food court and enjoyed some Japanese treats. We find Lucky Plaza a little crowded for our taste and we did not linger long as we started to feel a bit uncomfortable just due to amount of people in there. Otherwise I would recommend Orchard Road for a visit if you like shopping."
,,shopping paradise,4.0,,Some fantastic shops here but getting a taxi out is a nightmare better off walking down the street to a taxi rank
,,Quinta sensual Singapore,5.0,,"Every big city has that one road or neighborhood which reflects the vibe of the city. Orchard road is that road for Singapore. Clean, busy, efficient, lots of dining options and shopping. Try and stay near this road for easy access to all of Singapore."
,,"Stay at home, go to your nearest shopping centre",2.0,,"Orchard Road is a money-devouring vacuum cleaner. Nothing more, nothing less. There are few shops here that you would not find on any major city street or shopping center anywhere in the world nowadays, the prices are pretty much the same too.
Restaurants by the hundred but again very little that stands out from elsewhere and prices that make you swallow hard for the most part.
Thousands of people trolling up and down a shopping street in Singapore’s hot and moist atmosphere, all looking to find something different in Prada here as opposed to Prada in London or Paris or Brits traipsing in and out of M&S for heavens sake.....completely beyond my comprehension.

My advice is keep your travel money in your pocket, go to your nearest major shopping center, sit and dream you are in Singapore. Then do your shopping and go home. Imagine what you could buy with the air-fare and hotel costs!"
,,Shopping on Steroids,3.0,,Must do strip but not so interesting - lots of shops - usual chain stores and luxury brands. Worth a stroll - not much more.
,,Designer brands;,4.0,,"Several high end brands available down this road, but at a price....there is a variety of stuff to choose from when it comes to apparel. The Apple store at Orchard Road in Singapore is quite large, and located close to the Departmental store Robinsons."

,,Feast of Lights,4.0,,"Great road for visitors....a shoppers delight......best viewed at night, all lit up like wonderland, especially at festival times as in Chinese New Year, Christmas etc. Singapore is truly a multi cultural haven in a world gone slightly mad! We all celebrate each others festivals and prejudice has no place in Singapore. Visitors to Singapore please do NOT miss a stroll down Orchard Rd, especially at night.........great shopping, atmosphere, lights and, of coarse, FOOD!!"
,,Fifth Ave. of Singapore 🛍💰,5.0,,"High end shopping street. Mostly high end stores, food halls in the malls. Not many places along Orchard Road to enjoy a cold drink or cocktail.

,,Lots of Shops and Restaurants,5.0,,"Our hotel was very close to Orchard road so we visited each day. Lots of shopping, restaurants and coffee shops along here. We spent most of our time at ION Shopping Centre which also had Orchard MRT. I love the way Singapore has lovely wide footpaths and beautiful gardens everywhere."
,,Redeo Drive of Singapore,5.0,,This is the main shopping area of Singapore. There are several malls along the street. Some of these malls are huge with lots of high end stores. They are multi level- most with food courts in the below ground levels. Easy to walk along outside to view the sights.
,,Outdated shopping district,3.0,,"Ok it used to b the to go places for shopping and meeting friends but orchard road has quiet down alot due to the many other shopping malls opening up in the heartlands. But this is good for tourists, more space n fresh air. No long q etc. shops are all repeated in every malls, nothing special in the malls. So just take a walk along orchard road to see n absorb the beauty of Singapore is good enough. Christmas is a good time to see the lightings thou."
,,Very congested.,3.0,,"Sales staff must be sure of their sales quotas because they don't get by on their customer service skills.

,,More shops than you can shake a stick at! Something for everyone!,4.0,,"My friend and I walked along a large part of Orchard Road taking in the many shops and shopping malls that line it. It's around 2.5km in length so you can take your time, especially when it is so humid and hot! There are shops that cater for all budgets; everything from the well known chains to more specialist boutiques. Definitely worth a visit for a couple of hours."
,,Hustle and bustle in the city,4.0,,"The main road in Singapore with too many malls to get them all done in one day so make sure you have more than a day see it all or make a good planning upfront. Walking the entire road can be exhausting especially with the hot humid temperature but there are plenty of spots where you can take the MRT to “jump” to the next part.
Also something interesting are all the birds that have their beds high in the trees. Each day at sunset they fly to their bed and make such a noise with it that you hardly hear the cars."

A must for visitors esp during festive season. You may not buy much due to the Singapore exchange rates but still go absorb the atmosphere and people watch!"
,,Have a Spare Million? Here's How to Unburden Yourself,5.0,,"Every luxury brand known has a swanky (and air-conditioned) store on Orchard Road. For those of us less well-off, it's a treat of window shopping and admiring how plutocrats live. We give a shout-out to the Orchard Road Apple Store. They were very, very helpful and actually recommended lower cost options to address our needs."

,,Charming green trees and pink flowers along Orchard Road,5.0,,"I didn’t do any shopping in Orchard Road. However, I was delighted to see the charming green trees and pink flowers there.

Being a learner on Chinese painting, I am particularly fascinated by the charming trees and flowers there. The trees have quite a number of tangled branches which characterized the style of South Asian trees. The twists look complicated as triangular love and as the complexity of human minds. The pink flowers are blooming beautifully as a smiling girl.

Here’s just a different way to appreciate the beauty in Orchard Road."
,,The shoppijng heart of Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Road is to Singapore what Nathan Road is to Hong Kong - the heart of the original shopping journey. Singapore being what it is, Orchard Road is strewn with shopping malls rather than individual shops so if you go in each of the malls it would take you very long time to do the entire road, which I guess is about a mile long."

,,Wow! How Things Change,2.0,,"When I lived here 30 years back, this was the place to be. Isetan was new and the MRT had been running for a few years so the 'underground' shopping experience had commenced but I have to say its now like the rats have invaded the sewer with the bulk of shopping in this place now moved from the likes of Luck Plaza Shopping Centre into the caverns below. Orchard Road seemed forlorn and empty. Thats progress!"

,,Busy,4.0,,We walked Orchard Rd at night with our young daughters. It was very busy and probably great for shopping but it didn't really appeal to us.
,,Overwhelming but some bargains available,4.0,,"Orchard Rd has shopping centre after shopping centre, and we had to come back twice even to get to most of it. High end shops are not cheap but some bargains are always to be found."

Wide street with busy vehicular traffic and glittering and towering buildings on both sides make the statement of an international metropolis. Thousands of pedestrians many of whom are tourists throng the sidewalks and malls. Illuminated billboards and electronic displays across the Orchard street carry names of almost all the international brands and products in fashion and cosmetics area. Occasionally, promotional activities like free ice cream distribution or performance by musical groups on the sidewalks add charm to the lively environment. Orchard Steer to Singapore is what Part Street is to Kolkata, Oxford Street to London, Fifth Avenue to New York City, Champs-Élysées to Paris or Ginza to Tokyo.
Two SMRT stations (Orchard and Somerset) facilitate tourist accessibility to the Orchard Street."
,,The luxury and crowded street of Singapore,4.0,,You want all the high end brands? This is the place.You want shopping from A to Z?

,,Lovely walk,4.0,,"amidst trees from the jungle! In fact you are probably walking in what used to be a jungle. When the heat gets to you, just pop into one of the air con shopping centres. If you are lucky, you may come across a couple of jungle fowls."
,,Shopper paradise for luxury brands,4.0,,"Orchard road has only malls around with all the luxury brands one can think up off. There are also some cheaper malls around the area, but they stuff all chinese products with no real value. You might as well go to Bugis street for some value for money shopping. We visit Ion Orchard and Paragon which we were here. While here try going to the Muji stores."
,,A wide and long shopping street,4.0,,"Orchard street is full of shopping places with all imaginable Western fashion brands. We walked the street like thousands of people not doing shopping but spending time ;-)

You find similar type of streets famous for containing all upscale brands in many many cities and will be a good place to spend time if you are tired of sight seeing.

The most interesting scene for us was many stands (almost each 50 m) serving ice cream in toast bread ;-) and people staying in ques to get one."
,,Gets better every visit.,5.0,,"As we stayed just off Orchard Road, it was an easy walk for us each day to the fantastic shopping and especially the restaurants and cafes along Orchard Road. It seems to be ever changing. Still the best for us."
,,Great for designer label,4.0,,This shopping area just goes on and on. If you are not into designer labels this is probably not for you. Plenty of shopping malls and places to eat.

,,Crowded Place,5.0,,The street is clean except the pigeon flying around and I'm so worry they drop unexpected liquid on my shirt.
,,The best shopping experience,5.0,,I had a full day spent on orchard road. The shops were endless along with many cafes and restaurants to eat in along the way.

,,So many exquisite shops,4.0,,"Wow! The shops and malls in this street is amazing. All the exquisite brands are there - Prads, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Coach, Tiffanys, etc. I think the best mall was Ion. Great variety of shops there and a food hall in the basement. Particularly enjoyed H&M."
,,Just another shopping mall,1.0,,"My wife and I visited Orchard Rd. Frankly I can’t see what the whole fuss is about. Yes, expensive shops, overpriced stuff, snobby store attendants. The experience of seeing materialistic people craving for branded stuff is amazing. Wouldn’t do this again. Can’t tell the difference of being in singapore, Dubai, London or Paris shopping mall."
,,Too many shops - not enough time,5.0,,"Navigating from ION Orchard, Tang, Wheelford and Patterson underground was easy once you worked out these are the 4 buildings on each corner. Every floor in each building looks different and you can clock up some miles heading in the wrong direction. If you like an item when you first see it, buy it - you probably won't find that shop again to return later."
,,This feels like New York City of Singapore,5.0,,One has to be there to feel it. The entire orchard road is lined with luxury shopping malls which are worth a visit. The hustle bustle of the streets and the roads and cars make you feel lively. There are a number of eateries out there from chain stores to sky high soaring luxury restaurants. MRT will drop you right there so give a visit when in Singapore.
,,Quite a buzzing place,4.0,,Singapore is basically one big mall. No matter where you go there are high quality shops and products for sale. The Orchard Road is full of shops and bars and really has quite a buzz about it. Glad I stayed at the Hilton as it is right in the middle of it all
,,"Shops, shops & More shops",4.0,,"Eat your heart out New York and London - Singapore’s main shopping centre street, sooo many shops and the restaurants were very good."
,,It's a bunch of malls,3.0,,"I think even shopaholics would get bored or overwhelmed here. The malls are fine, but nothing stunning like some of the super malls in Jakarta. They all have many of the same stores and places to eat, so you really could just hit one low-end, one medium, and one-high-end mall and be done."
,,orchard Road,4.0,,"Great shopping area, The shopping maul leads to another by walking underneath the road, there is nothing you can’t buy in Singapore,"

Some would say that Orchard Road is synonymous to Singapore."
,,For shopaholics,4.0,,"Even if you don't like shopping this area is worth a visit. I am not a person who enjoys shopping but this area is worth seeing. Many very luxury items, which are way out of my bracket can be found here."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"If you want get cheap or high end brand of clothes, accessories, shoes or any kind souvenir products, this is the best place come. Just tell the taxi driver where at Orchard road because this is not a small area. Just be specific where to go."
,,Singapore's mecca of shopping,4.0,,"Spanning just under 2km, this stretch of Singapore's most famous shopping district has everything and anything to offer to the shopper. Most of the stretches are pedestrian friendly, so access to buildings is not a problem. And lots of trees to provide shade during the day. There are ample MRTs and public bus services plus of course countless taxis.
But word of advise for the budget conscious; you will find better prices elsewhere in Singapore for the same stuff."
,,Hmm,3.0,,"Shopping is just grand here. Loads of shops under and over the road. It seriously would take at least a day to look at it all. Each plaza is different, so do your research if you want something specific. It does get a bbit samy, but at least you can say I went!"

,,VIBRANT & MODERN,5.0,,"Orchard Road -

,,Not worth the hype,2.0,,"Orchard road is a place best seen from the top of the bus. It's a shopping Mecca if you're into that, but so expensive. One over priced boutique after another, no atmosphere at all, and you could be in any major city into the world as it has no local flavour. I'd much rather visit little India or China town and enjoy some cultural heritage as well as realistic shopping."
,,One of best shopping places in Singapore,5.0,,"What is really interesting about this shopping belt in Singapore is the varied shopping experience for consumers .... from the ostentatious brands for the rich to something more affordable for the average shopper. The shopping malls along this belt are very much categorised and themed. Also, some of the malls are even connected via underground walkways. Christmas is always a great time to visit Orchard Road where the street is lit with Christmas lights and decorations."
,,Busy shopping street.,4.0,,"If you love shopping then you will love this Street. All the major designer stores are here Tiffany, Breitling, Gucci etc"
,,We love Orchard Road!,5.0,,We’ve been to Singapore a few times and always wander through Orchard Road and the malls. We love Ion Orchard and found 313 Somerset on this trip (Central I think it was called). Orchard Road is grand and just awesome to see!
,,Big malls everywhere,4.0,,Yes it’s a place full of shopping and eating surrounded by beautiful modern buildings. Our hotel was near by so we had no choice but walk by and go inside the malls to cool down.
,,Impressive at night,4.0,,"Took a stroll down from our hotel on Orchard Road in the evening. Plenty if people about and most shops etc still open at 8pm.

,,"Shop, shop, shop",4.0,,No end of places to shop from high end to bargain basement and everything in between. Plenty of choices for food. Beware of the chance of sudden downpours.
,,Wall to wall shopping,5.0,,"To venture into Orchard road maze of shopping you have to love shopping, no doubt about it, otherwise it will drive you crazy.
It’s shopping on steroids. However the majority of stores are high end, designer, not really anything cheap here. If you miss the first stop for your favourite store, don’t worry there will be at least another 2 or 3 branches of that exact same store with in metres of the previous one.
There are plenty of coffee stops & juice bars & food halls, you’re going to need them if you’re into a decent amount of retail therapy.
All in all it’s an ok day just trooping from centre to centre & you just may find something you can’t do without."

,,One might long stretch of shops,4.0,,"Well, definitely spoilt for choice, though a lot of the major shops are out of price range for the everyday tourist. Places like Lucky Plaza allow for the everyday poerson to shop. Definitely worth a vist just to window shop."
,,This place is almost is shopping hell or heaven I am not sure,4.0,,We went to Orchard road actually wanting to buy a pair of smart black shoes. We found it almost impossible. You walk along the road enter what you think looks like a shop and it turns out to be a massive shopping centre on about 6-8 levels many underground . It is completely overwhelming. You come out go into the next ‘shop’ again another massive number of shops on different levels many the same as the last centre. Every shop in the world seems to be represented but it is such a jumble. You get a shoe shop then a gift shop then a department store then the Apple shop shop etc etc. If you love shopping you need to devote at least a whole day to Orchard Road if you want a casual shopping stroll I would avoid you will get a headache. We eventually found a pair of shoes but only but using the electronic index of stores in each centre and then walking to the store through the maze of store. Good luck if you visit.
,,Amazing shopping,5.0,,Shops I have never seen before in some large cities throughout the world. Such a wide variety to choose from. Easy access.
,,A shopaholics dream,5.0,,You name it they’ve got it. Every store you’ve ever wanted all down one street with some beautiful architecture to match. Lots and lots of designer shops but it’s great to go window shopping and feel glamorous for an afternoon!

,,So many Malls!,5.0,,"If you like to shop then visit Orchard Road. Each mall is different to suit all wallets! Clean, tidy and safe. The food courts are busy but the food quality is good. T you go at dusk you will hear the birds nesting in the trees. What a noise!"
,,Glitter and Gold,4.0,,Orchard Road is one of the stalwart of modern Singapore. It has many high end shopping malls and houses some of the major attraction points. It gets decorated like a bride during the Christmas and New year period and is a sight to behold. This is one place where you can comfortably spend a full day with good value add into your life. Parking is expensive which needs to be taken into account. It is crowded at most times but it has overcrowding during weekends. Nice place to spend time with kids
,,Designer shopping outlets,5.0,,"This beats London’s oxford street for sure.

A variety of prestige malls full of designer outlets which are beautifully presented. And rows of high end fashion shops along the road.

Everything from diamond and jewellery to rare watches and latest designs of clothes bags and shoes!

If you want to treat yourself shopping, this is the place for you!

There are also lots of food malls and restaurants scattered throughout the malls and on the road."
,,Great shopping and plenty to see,4.0,,"If shopping is your thing then Orchard Road is for you.
Countless shops and malls to visit. If you had a month you still wouldn't be able to visit them all.
From bargain places like the 'Far East Plaza' and the 'Lucky Plaza' to all the high-end shops and designer outlets you can imagine."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Full of malls and high end shops. If you love shopping esp. high end, this place will satisfy you. Lots of restaurants and food halls too."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"Incredible street with lots of shopping malls, not like we are use to in the US, but huge multi-level buildings with different stores. It is really a shoppers’ paradise with shops raging from the most expensive jewelry brand stores, world-known fashion houses to cheap toys. Really not to missed, also the malls have a huge variety food place to eat."
,,If you are there go take a look,4.0,,Mall after Mall on this road. Some are more fun and interesting whilst others have all the usual designer brands. You need to explore and go in and out of doorways not just the obvious ones as some quirky shops are located in basement areas. You can find everything on ths road.
,,Top Brands In A Lane,4.0,,"Orchard Road is basically a shopping district or I should say lane where all the best brands of the world viz. Gucci, Cartier, Jimmy Choo, Chanel, Montblanc, Rado, Zegna, etc. can be found at one place either in malls or as outlets in a single lane named Orchard Road. It's a delightful feeling walking down this street but the prize tags on any stuff in any of the showrooms here can easily give heartache to anyone. One must carry a very heavy wallet if at all one wants to indulge in shopping here."
,,Shopping spree,4.0,,"Lots of shopping complex with lots restaurants. We are spoiled with choices. From branded goods to mid range, from 5* to 3* hotel, from fine dinning to food court, you can find all there.looking forward to Singapore sale in jun!"
,,If you like designer shops!,5.0,,"No need to cross the road for Prada, Gucci and the like they are on both sides. I have never seen so many high end malls and shops in one location. Very expensive but lovely."
,,Love Orchard Road,4.0,,"First visited Orchard Rd in 1982 and didn't return until 2018 .... unrecognisable! A very different place now but absolutely fabulous.. wide vistas allow for a leisurely stroll up and down the strip. Gorgeous tropical gardens and trees canopy over head. We didn't do much shopping due to price point but there is plenty to see and do besides shopping. Designer brand heaven for those who care to dabble... food options abound and the coffee is excellent ... I love it here, it feels safe and is very relaxing."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,"It is hard to imagine something that you cannot buy on Orchard Road. It varies from extremely upscale to the cheaply inexpensive basements and metro shopping areas below ground. We were here just prior to Chinese New Year, so the place was decked out accordingly. And the seasonal goodies offered for the celebration were unsurpassed for variety and delightfulness. It is easy to overload on the congestion of all the crowds, so plan for some visits to natural settings like the Botanical Gardens to provide balance. At night, there are wonderfully talented performance artists for you to enjoy in the balmy night air. And of course, there is great food of all kinds. This is a great place to stay, if your budget will allow for the expensive hotels."
,,Shopping,4.0,,shopping paradise of Singapore only visit few shopping malls there there are lots of malls at Orchard and it sute for any budget you have
,,Just B E A U tiful,5.0,,Amazing shopping district of Singapore with underground shopping too. Just Shop till u drop! The bargains and best buys retailers are located underground mostly.
,,Good place for shops,4.0,,"We spent half a day here, wandering the shops and malls. All the malls are connected basically so you can stay out of the heat. There’s a mix of luxury shops and classic mall shops. Everything was definitely more pricey in the orchard area, but it was still nice to look around."
,,Shopping,5.0,,For those who enjoy shopping in any form- this is the ideal place to be. You can wander from shop to shop through a maze of underground paths even without seeing a hint of blue skies. The humongous Malls are full of various stores- and most of them have a food court or restaurants. You can find high end stores to those more reasonably priced for the common man. Some places offer classes and activities for both adults and children. It would be better to avoid going there on weekends and holidays- very crowded. It is an icon of Singapore - your visit is not complete if you have not been on Orchard road.
,,Great to wander!,5.0,,"Orchard Road of course has all big names in the way of shopping - not everyone can afford to shop in these high end stores. But it does not stop you from doing the inevitable ‘window shopping’ excursion!

It’s well worth a wander down one side of Orchard Rd and back up the other.

Or, grab the MRT at one end and walk back on one side and the next day do the opposite. There are also underground walkways if it gets too warm to walk outside.

Stop and enjoy one of the delicious ice creams from any of the single person vendors. He is there to put his kids thru school

Go downstairs at any of the centers to experience more shopping but also some coolness.

But December is really the best time of the year where you also get to experience a fabulous Singapore Christmas! So many people if all religions out there enjoying the colours, the lights and the music.

Get out there and explore!"
,,Overpriced shops in an average area.,3.0,,"Thought we would visit to see what the fuss was about. Was not bothered about buying as Singapore is very expensive but thought the area would be somewhere we could whittle away a few hours. Unless you want to visit the shoooing malls don’t bother,"
,,Great vibe at night,4.0,,"Popular tourist attraction with many shops, restaurants and malls. A long walk down one side and up the other. Great vibe at night."
,,Overrated,4.0,,"The shopping here just to busy and too expensive, but a must see for the tourist, the foods good and beers are cold."
,,Brand names street,4.0,,"The time you step in Orchard road, you can see all the brand names from prada to cartier,mont blanc ,etc...The shops and malls in the street are right and left.you can also find restsurants and coffee shops."
,,More shopping than you can imagine!,4.0,,Orchard Road is a shopper's paradise. There are more high end shops and shopping centers than you can imagine. It's a great place to people watch. Be prepared for crowds of people. It is also a pretty place for a walk because of the many trees and public sculpture. There are the occasional street performers and lots of restaurants of all varieties.
,,An ordinary road,2.0,,"Shops, cars and malls. Nothing extraordinary. I dont understand whats original or extraordinary. Prices are the same in other malls."
,,Not what i expected,3.0,,I have heard so many things about Orchard Road including the shopping. It wasn't what I was expecting and to be honest didn't leave anything to the imagination. It is a must to go but if you won't then no need to worry.
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Orchard rd is the best area to shop in the World, better than Oxford rd in England. You can find from luxury clothes to very cheap."
,,High tech shoppers paradise,5.0,,"The visit to Orchard Road is always a great fun. With upscale malls such as Ngee Ann City, Takashimaya Shopping Centre, Wisma Atria connected to each other, the walking is easy inside air-conditioned environment. The underground ION Orchard and Patterson link are two great attractions for high end shopping. Leisurely walk on Orchard road itself is an activity everyone must do while visiting Singapore. There are lots of seating arrangements on the roadside on walk paths. The kebab food stalls on the roadside are delicious. Tourists can spend a whole day browsing things across different malls on Orchard Road. Fascinating book store Kinokuniya is located above Takashimaya Shopping Centre (Ngee Ann City), which is indeed a great attraction for book enthusiasts. Kinokuniya is probably one of the best and largest book stores that can be seen anywhere in the world. Orchard Road, truly a tourist paradise for leisurely shopping."
,,The shopping destination,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the shoppers dream come true. With high end malls housing luxury brands to the brands within your reach, you get it all here. Prada, Dior, Tiffany, Gucci all located here next to each other starting from Takashimaya Mall is for the very rich. However, the place is a treat even for an average shopper at Orchard gateway where you have Forever21, Aldo, H&M and all other reachable brands.If you are lucky, these shops have protons running where you can get very good deals.
A little away on Orchard Road itself is the Lucky Plaza where you have small shops stocking gift articles, tees, shoes some really cheap upto 10 $. It contains McDonalds where you could grab a bite too...
A shop called Metro on Orchard Road is a superstore housing clothes, accessories and even household items. You could get some nice porcelain stuff for your dining table here. Use Google maps to locate the stores you want to specifically visit. The whole place is a shopping haven and one could easily get lost! :)"
,,streets for shopaholic,5.0,,It is nice street with all the shops from cheap to most expensive brandsVery safe to walk and clean too.

,,Shoppers Delight,4.0,,"I first visited Orchard Road 40 years ago. Now it has grown up! Full of high end shops, lots of places to eat in all price ranges. I suggest starting at one end and working your way down. There are department stores such as Robinsons and boutiques such as Tori Birch and everything else from around the world. Weekends tend too be very busy, so if you don't like crowds pick another day. .There are some good hotels up and down Orchard Road. If you are staying away from Orchard Road the MRT has a couple of stations and the bus service is also available. I would suggest staying away from the heat of the day around 3.00pm, although remember Singapore is always hot!. There are many new shopping complexes or you can experience one of the older ones such as Lucky Plaza. If you are visiting Singapore it is a ""must"""
,,Sightseeing at afternoon,4.0,,"Me and my family arrive at Singapore at noon. We decided to have lunch at Orchard and walk around the street to sightseeing. Very clean road, crowded but the people very disipline. They follow the traffict light and walk through the right line. So does the vehicle.
We can see birds around the Orchard Road street and take a pict with them"
,,Great shopping area as long as you have a large wallet.,4.0,,"Certainly has a lot of up market shops within some spectacular shopping centres. Not sure how they all make money, as there is a lot of competition. But certainly one for the women."
,,"Good, if you like really expensive shopping",3.0,,It’s an expensive and ritzy shopping area. Great if you are into that sort of thing. Plenty of high-end jewelry and fashion.
,,Shopping Galore,4.0,,There are too many shops to list. You could spend days walking up and down Orchard Road discovering all the shops and eateries. High end fashion labels to regular stores all reside within the huge malls and outlets.

Every high end shop is present as well as some local/ budget shops. The malls all have A/C so pleasant way to escape the heat or can enjoy a wet day inside. There are lots of restaurants and bars as well from global brands to local. This is not the place to come to look for good value but the variety is huge. If you like shopping and have the time whilst in Singapore this is the place for you and you could spend as much time as you want as the options are limitless

It's busy, bustling and a shopper's paradise with every high-end store you could think of and a huge range of food stores, some of which are located in food courts in the bottom levels of the plazas.

,,Underwhelming,3.0,,It's basically a road with some high end shops on. There are quite a few of these in Singapore. Even the quaint houses are a bit of a let down.
,,Average big city commerce street!,3.0,,"I would recommend visiting here if you are looking for high end places to eat or shop. This area reminds me of 5th Avenue in NYC with an Asian flare. Its a fun thing to walk through, however, I wouldn't necessarily put this at the top of my list."
,,Many shopping places,5.0,,Great and many shopping places and shops. Really enjoyed walking to those places. Will come back for sure
,,Shoppers PARADISE !!!!,5.0,,"One of the most beautiful location of Singapore and a Shoppers paradise where you will find multiple MALLS, FOOD JOINTS and enormous attire outlets.

Good thing is that 2 malls are connected by underpass and every mall have a metro station which can take you anywhere in Singapore.

One of the best places to visit for a complete shopping experience."
,,Shopping til you drop,5.0,,This area is one of the best shopping centres in the city. Designer labels everywhere. Accessed from either street level or the MRT. Another must see place.
,,Fancy place,5.0,,A high class street where big brands & big shopping mall flourish. A treat for eyes in the evening. Do eat icecream sandwich in front of ion Orchard mall for 1.20$
,,You Probably Cannot Avoid It!,3.0,,"Orchard Road is the shopping hub of Singapore and as such it is full of places to shop but it is a pretty standard busy street with high rise and traffic and of course loads of high end shops that do offer a wide variety of goods and a wide variety of prices and mostly high. There are far more interesting places to visit in Singapore but if you have not seen Orchard Road and you like shopping then go for it as you probably will love the place.It is accessible via the subway, Red line and get out at Orchard."
,,Great place to shop inbetween business,5.0,,"If you are in the area for business, than this is a Great place to shop. Though a bit overwhelming. Look for the small shops in the basement areas for good deals."

,,The ultimte shopping experience,5.0,,"This is THE place to shop in Singapore. You will find several large shopping centres with everything you may want and with a full range of prices. I particularly enjoy Takashimaya, including their basement food court."
,,Struggling?,4.0,,"Orchard road is tidier and prettier than ever. There is more to buy than ever. I did not see a huge number of shoppers. A main strip to rival Oxford St, but probably will need a slight adjustment to it's business case to edge towards high end residential?"
,,Shops shops and more shops....,4.0,,Shopping district of Singapore. Shop till you drop / there is always some sort of sale going on. Walking along orchard road is great - just people watching. You get to botanical gardens at the end which is great.
,,"Shops , shops and more shops.",4.0,,Not a big shop person but suppose when you are in Singapore you have to visit Orchard Road. Super clean area with all the big name shops and heaps of restaurants. We did it with the hop on hop off bus which was worthwhile. Cool experience.
,,Interesting place to stroll and shop,4.0,,Interesting place to stroll and shop. Great shopping malls. Access could be done by subway. The night tour is more interesting because of the lights of the buildings and the streets.
,,Busy Busy Busy,4.0,,The traditional shop until you drop with all the high end shops as well as the budget shops on both sides. Love the traditional Portuguese façade of the side streets
,,Global brands on a seemingly endless road.,3.0,,Not for me I'm afraid. Each block has its own mall with brands from around the world. The only native thing about them seem to be the restaurants.
,,Shops of all kind,5.0,,"Orchard Road has always been and remains the biggest shopping extravaganza of Singapore. From smaller specialty shops to ""city malls"" with high-end retailers like Cartier, there is something for everyone on Orchard Road."
,,Orchard rd shopping,3.0,,"There are many places to shop on Orchard rd, from corner shops ,food/restaurants to high end malls and shops like Emporio amani/Prada, Swatch and jewellery. However due to Singapore's lack of consumer protection, please be aware that individual shops have their own policy when returning or swapping items. Worst case is you won't be able to do either.
I recently tried to purchase a battery for my camera from an electronics shop below Far East shopping centre, the battery did not charge and I was refused any refund so was ripped off paying £50 for a 64GB usb stick as compensation. In addition they did not give any sales receipts or guarantee so believe they were not only defrauding tax office they were also ripping tourists off.

For this reason I have only given an average score."
,,Malls galore!,4.0,,"we stayed in this area during our recent trip to Singapore. Orchard Road is lined by enormous malls on either side. There are all kinds of stores, from budget to luxury. There are also MRT stations in the area for easy access. There are a number of hawker centers/food courts with a large variety of cuisines available as well. Nice experience for a few hours!"
,,Excellent felling,5.0,,I'm very happy for come to Singapore city. It's very nice city. Especially clean city . I lived the city. Lots of people helpful . I bought something . And try to understand products price.
,,wow wow wow!!,5.0,,"Taxi driver dropped us at top of Orchard Rd, with instructions to go down to basement level and walk all the way along underground.
Amazing number of stores and the most beautiful food Hawker type stalls in the food courts along the way.....Amazing Japanese supermarket with cafes inside. Along with Western Style Starbucks, Pizza Hut, KFC etc. We stuck to local cuisine as so much cheaper and fresh..........air conditioned all the way with several MRT stops where you can exit to jump on the trains. Highly recommended for shopping from high end to everyday."
,,Shopping and sights for everyone,4.0,,"We chose to stay on Orchard Road so that we could explore. We especially love the Takashimaya food court in the basement of that very large shopping centre. Lots of delights to taste test and purchase. If you want upmarket, all the major brand names are represented e.g Prada, Tiffany's, Gucci etc etc. But there are lots of cheaper options too. The only thing we didnt like was trying to cross the one main intersection where you have to go underground. Because there are shopping centres under each corner and the walkways were not straightforward and on different levels, it was easy to lose our bearings and take several attempts to come up on the side of the road that we were after. This became a little frustrating after a while when all you wanted to do was cross over.
Lots of great food options. Very pretty at night"
,,Just a Bunch of High End Shops,3.0,,Shoppers will like this.It's about 2 miles of shops similar to what you would see on in Los Angeles or New York.
,,busy,4.0,,Very busy high end shopping so don't think you will get any bargains here. Shop after shop of luxury good quite frankly not my type of shopping but may be to others taste
,,Superb,5.0,,A must visit place when u r in singapore...it is 2.5 km long road ....there r many awesome malls on orchard road....it is retail and entertainment hub of Singapore...it is major tourist attraction of Singapore...u can shop a lot from there but cost is always high there....
,,A Good Place to Walk and Shop!,5.0,,"A good place to walk and/or shop. From Designer goods to Bargains, you'll find something to suffice your shopping wants!"
,,Shopping,5.0,,"It is mind blowing how many shops , malls and what we would call arcades. The diversity of shopping is amazing. You need to know your prices as shopping is no cheaper but the variety is amazing."
,,MARKETS ARE BETTER.,3.0,,"Every city Every Airport has all the labels. Walking down a street with all the Same is Boring. 27 years ago when we had a stay it was exciting and vibrant. Changed but not for the better. Found the Markets in Bencoolen street, far much more fun."
,,Amazing shopping experience,5.0,,"Heaven in a street! Amazing place to locate yourself if your keen to do some serious shopping and get among the hustle and bustle of Singapores exclusive brands hub. We stayed in a Hotel on Orchard Road and had everything we desired and needed right outside our door and with in walking distance. There is easy access to shopping centres, great eating spots, trains, buses and Taxies to get you around. The shopping is easy and plenty to choose from as you go through the underpasses or streets from one area to the next. Its clean and safe and we kept enjoying the area every chance we got. Would definitely stay in this area again. Central to it all."
,,"Re visited ""TANGS"" after 28 years!",4.0,,"Loved Orchard Road the 1st time we did Singapore in 1990. Went back to catch a cruise. Wanting to search out the famous ""TANGS SHOPPING CENTRE"" loved it 28 years ago, did not disappoint 2nd time.The original green Asian roof top peaking up competing with modern sky lines. TANGS is an icon loaded with history. Loved the time line history plaques top floor. TANGS was the 1st of all the shops last century later moved to opposite side to where it stands today. Small food court still there. Service 100% but noticed some parts of Orchid Rd was run down not as many shopping centres as before, mire corporate now, missed the Hard Rock Cafe where H&M is now. Transport great to get around. Clean and safe city always good."
,,Overpriced food & drink,3.0,,"Should have realized what the ++ means (17% tax) Happy hour not so happy & food was very average for what we paid. Spring rolls out of a packet, Singapore Slings $14.80 + 17% Next day we went to Chinatown, this is where you should go for good food and drink at reasonable prices. I have been told since that Little India is also good. Felt Orchard Road was very over rated."
,,"Thriving, energetic and exciting",4.0,,"Definitely a must for those who love shopping (or window shopping). Shops tend to be mid to high-end and prices reflect that accordingly. We didn't come across any market type areas but rather lots of large up-market shopping malls. Perfect activity for a rainy or super-hot day as you can access many shopping malls under cover. There are also a couple of MRT stations along the road so easy to get to from a number of parts of the city. Lots of fun, quirky food places too ranging from cheap eats to super-pricy flash places. Not too many traditional Singaporean food places at the cheap eats end though so if you are wanting authentic Singaporean food I would recommend going to a nearby hawker food centre. In saying that, the food places along Orchard Rd are amazing blends of fusion food."
,,F&N Magnolia Ice Cream,4.0,,"Walking down the Orchard road, you will find an ice cream kiosk. The F&N Magnolia Ice cream kiosk offer lots of variety. You can choose to eat your ice cream in a plastic cup or with a bread. It is only SGD 1.20. It taste very good, especially on a hot days!"
,,"If you like shopping, this might be the spot for you.",4.0,,"I guess it depends on what moves your boat. This sort of attraction (shopping) isn't really our thing. Now, everybody needs to eat and this place definitely has some great deals, choices and locations well worth visiting.

What would you find here?

Several department stores with famous brands on display are waiting for you. Looking at prices I can see there isn't much difference with Australia and it might be a tad expensive for an American. But the shopping malls are very interesting to watch. Inside some of these, you will find glorious food courts and restaurants. I do recommend these last ones, is a good representation of the food in Asia.

On this road, you will also find a few galleries and museums, out of which I think the Singapore Art Museum is well worth the visit if you are trying to escape the crowd and the busy noise of the street.

Is it a must-do thing in Singapore?

It depends, do you fancy buying stuff? in that case, this place might be for you. Do you like to chill and rest? go somewhere else."
,,Shopping district,5.0,,"Walking on Orchard Road you realize how rich is this city. On the entire road you find only posh mall, but is an enjoyable walking experience also very clean street, I never seen something like that in Europe. Enjoy"
,,Great for food,4.0,,So much wealth it was quite intimidating. We walked in to shops knowing full well there was no chance we were going to get our wallets out. Unbelievable how many brand name shops there are and why someone would pay $3000 plus for a flanelette shirt is beyond me. BUT if you dig deep most of the shopping centres have food courts and these include local and imported foods. All very exciting to look at and sample and the people are mostly friendly. Best places for cheap stuff is China town or Little India.
,,"Lots of shops, very busy",4.0,,"On the MRT route and hop on hop off bus, lots of shopping but very busy on side walks. very thriving area."
,,One of the best places for Shopping,4.0,,"I'm not a fan of branded apparel but I find Orchard road one of the best places to shop, nice food courts to help you wipe your hunger."
,,2018 Family Holiday,5.0,,Great place for shopping and food. We enjoyed Singapore very much our fourth trip hear and will be back again.
,,Generally too busy,3.0,,With parity exchange rates with Australia and increasingly more traffic and thus slower trips orchard road shopping is not the value nor the must do destination it once was. Simply a long line of expensive department stores that do however mostly have good food courts.
,,Just a stroll,3.0,,I am not into shopping but if you are it is a shoppers paradise.I lost count of how many brands and malls were there.I just ate a cake icecream from a local icecream stall and enjoyed my evening stroll walking past all the buildings.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise. If you can’t get it here, you can’t get it anywhere! Definitely plan a couple of days here if you’re the serious shopper as the malls are endless. For all the guys who are tagging along, there’s plenty of bars and cafes to choose from to wait until the girls are finished. But seriously, the shopping is spectacular and the facilities are world class."
,,Singapore,5.0,,fantastic shopping options and a great daily walk to all the shops from the Concorde Hotel. makes this choice a winner
,,The shopping heaven in Singapore for travelers who like signature brands,4.0,,Plenty of 5 star hotels and Dept store and Michelin rated restaurant. A kilometer+ of shopping area and good food. The stores usually close at 10 PM but many restaurant too eat after 10 pm near the Sommerset MRT station

,,Orchard Experience,5.0,,"It is my 3rd or may be 4th visit to Singapore during last 13 years. And I surely enjoy walking on Orchard Road. Big roads, people full of discipline very kind and helpful.
Previously, I had always visited during holiday season, this time it was different, but I still enjoyed Paragon, Far East Plaza, Lucky Plaza, Tangs, Orchard Central, Takashimaya, Wisma Atria, ION, Orchard Central, Centre point and the list goes on. I always like Singapore especially the civic sense of people residing here, quality of workmanship staring from civic agencies to private entrepreneurs. But Singapore is getting more and more expensive especially for people living here. It is more becoming a materialistic or a robotic city. No retirement age. May be the people over here are happy with this way of living."

,,Mall after Mall.,4.0,,"Easy to find as this is one of the stations on the MTR.

We walked from Mall to Mall in air conditioned luxury but after three multistorey shopping malls even my wife had seen enough.

How so many shops all apparently selling the same goods make a profit I do not know.

Worth a visit but if you have a low tolerance to shops, as I do, it's not an all day excursion."

Plenty of bars and restaurants again with a tremendous variation in price. Always try for the happy hour in bars and eat in the food courts as they are delicious with great choices.
In the evenings the working girls come out but unless you are easily offended they are no problem. Certainly not bringing a sleazy atmosphere to the area.
If you are on a budget check prices before ordering food and drink and check if the prices include tax and service charge as this can add a chunk on."
,,Very vibrant central location.,5.0,,My Design hotel of YOTEL was very central for the MRT on Orchard and there were so many shopping malls and foods that it was easy to travel and have all at my fingertips. They are vast malls and run into each other but air conditioned which was a blessing after long hot days.

The stuff is either expensive mall quality or cheap Chinese so make up your mind.

Traveling with wives and daughters could be a real test of patience."
,,the main road in Singapore,5.0,,"must see road in singapore, it has so many malls and the street it self is beautiful. if your here to shop that's the place to be. note that the malls are all connect underground and majority of shops are underground make sure you go down specially for food."

,,Nothing Special,2.0,,"HIgh priced up market shopping. Boring really.. The shops are sterile with plenty of glitter. Orchard road felt like one long airport duty free shop. Only for shoppers with plenty of money to spend although it does represent Singapore image in General. That is,¨Over priced¨."
,,Commercial and crowded,3.0,,"Mall upon mall of either overprice high end high fashion. Or cheap made in China stuff. The height of commercialism but great for people watching.
For a more pleasant shopping experience, the Shoppes at MBS was much better and less crowded. Or get off the beaten path and go to haji road for smaller boutiques."
,,amazing,3.0,,"you can find anything you need here, you named it, you got it! so many shopping mall in one place, it's a shopping paradise."
,,Now one of the most expensive places to shop,3.0,,"When I first came to Singapore in 1996 Orchard Road was a shopper's paradise. There was an amazing selection of merchandise at extremely reasonable prices. However, over the past 20-odd years, it's become progressively more expensive. Today you're much better off shopping in the UK or the USA. Even after factoring in the difference in sales taxes or value added taxes (20% VAT in the UK vs 7% GST in Singapore) most things are substantially less expensive in the UK than in Singapore. The reason is not entirely explained by the costs of shop floor space, because Hong Kong has even more expensive retail real-estate yet manages to keep prices at more reasonable levels.

Orchard Road is usually the worst place to buy almost anything in Singapore. The shops are mostly very flashy, but the prices are sky-high and the service delivered by the snotty-nosed shop assistants is very often terrible. If you really want to bag a deal in Singapore you're probably better off going to Chinatown or one of the suburban shopping areas. Many Singaporeans now shop online or wait until they travel overseas. If you're a westerner finding things to fit you here can be difficult or expensive. If you want to go on an Asian shopping trip you are probably better off going to Hong Kong. Singapore is where you're best sticking to window shopping."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Top brands, and world class shopping experience would advise to bring a lot of money, not the cheapest shopping experience but well worth a visit."
,,"If your like window shopping, you can't beat it",5.0,,"If you have the money to buy the stuff in the windows, you still can't beat it! Don't miss the different levels underground - tons of food."
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,Lots of malls to suit all budgets and tastes. Easy to access from many metro stations. Worth a visit.
,,Sale at Robinsons,4.0,,"I am a member of Robinsons and they were giving me a 25% discount. I shopped till the last minute and they were patient with me. there are many different brands of Clothes, fragrances & shoes so it’s really amazing. I love shoes from ‘Be Me’. Good leather shoes."
,,The PLACE to go in Singapore,5.0,,"This is THE place, from shopping to food to ... There are good byes. Don’t believe people who told you Singapore is expensive. It has good value byes, if you know where to search."
,,Rodeo Drive of Singapore,5.0,,"This road is lined with all sorts of hotels, malls. While I said the Rodeo Drive, there is Lucky Plaza which provides for more affordable prices. I would say this is a main road to walk through and visit. It'll take a week alone if you decide to experience everything this road has to offer."
,,Luxury!,4.0,,This is the place to go if you’re lucky enough to be able to afford luxury clothing and accessories... Although I have to say these shops weren’t particularly busy funnily enough... Very clean and cool
,,"Shop, shop, shop",3.0,,"If you want to shop, this is your place. Food options are available but not great, some sights for Chinese New Year, but shopping options are top-notch, high-end, and plentiful."

,,Lively place for shopping,5.0,,My first trip back to Singapore after 23 years and I was impressed by the changes that I saw on Orchard Road. Busy as always with lots of shopping choices.
,,shopping galore !,3.0,,I've been coming to Orchard Road for years to observe the high end and low end shoppers. What I like about this area is that it has something for everyone.. those on a budget and those otherwise. There is also some great high and low end restaurants in the area as well. There is a fabulous spot for frozen yogurt near the Grand Hyatt and there are some very high end lounges in the same area. I find that this is just a good place to take a long walk and experience the energy and observe the people. I always like to visit Orchard Road at least once during every visit to Singapore.
,,World Class Shopping,5.0,,Orchard is definitely worth a visit if you want to see or experience world class shopping. The stores are endless and buildings are beautiful. There is no shortage of places to eat in the area.
,,"Expensive and overrated, no sales of deals",2.0,,"If you have a lot of money they is is the place for you.

,,amazing,5.0,,"make Singapore trip one of your bucket list. This country is so clean, peaceful and cool. One of the best."
,,Just a bunch of malls,3.0,,It really is just a bunch of Westfield type shopping malls. Prices are no different to Australia in most places. If you are keen on shopping the day away this is the place for it. But found it unremarkable for any sort of cultural elements.
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Orchard road has shops that sell luxury goods to down to earth product. This place can be quite crowded, especially on weekends, so be sure to be prepared for large crowds!"
,,Great shopping with all and every designer label as well as more down to earth products,5.0,,"Exciting shopping area - malls and shops that have everything from Jimmy Shu shoes to Street food on sticks. Lots of places to eat, drink and browse..."
,,Busy Shopping Road,5.0,,If you like to shop or browse lots and lots to see here. Plenty of places to eat too. Generally a little pricey with many high end stores but if you hunt around a bit some places have sales and while you aren't going to find dirt cheap bargains some slightly lower prices can be found. On the other hand if you have lots and lots to spend and are looking for high end items this is a paradise.
,,Depends on your taste,3.0,,"A bustling road of up market brand shops with some more "" market type"" areas. This area is always very busy. All the brand name shops have other outlets EG Marina Bay so only go to orchard rd if you enjoy the crowds and traffic."
,,Great place to eat,5.0,,We stayed at the Shangri La hotel just a 10 minute walk from Orchard road shops and restaurants some of the best food to be had can be found here. Give the Black Angus steak house a try exceptionally good streaks at a reasonable price. We ate there 3 times during our stay and were never disappointed
,,High end Haven.,3.0,,"Although not really my scene, I did the obligatory Orchard Road visit. What I found was what I expected, plenty of top end brand name clothes and accessories. Had a window shop, a coffee and left to enjoy a Singapore Sling at Raffles."

,,"Lots of energy and big crowds, but it's not for everyone",4.0,,"I really enjoyed Orchard Road, personally, just for the sheer energy and amounts of people. I thought it was really fun and definitely added to my Singapore experience. However, if you don't like crowds or commercialism - or have a really short amount of time in Singapore - then it's definitely skippable."
,,Typical,4.0,,"Typical high end main Street. Really nice architecture. If your are looking for brand name shops, this is the place to go to"
,,Get A Real Sense of Singaporean Urban Lifestyle,5.0,,"Perfect spot in the heart of Singapore for a walk and mingle with people to catch the urban vibe and Singaporean energy.

Although it is technically just like other luxury shopping complexes in other cities, but you couldn't find the same atmosphere around entire Southeast Asia.

Definitely a worth to go!"
,,meh.... not for me!,3.0,,"Just a long hot road with little shade and a gazillion malls side by side. Over whelming, hard to know which mall was the best one, kinda waste of time. Enjoy Singapore for its other attractions and do your shopping elsewhere! (like Hong Kong/China)"
,,Posh Shopping Street,4.0,,The Road has shopping malls on both sides of the street and they are so well designed and connected that if you have time and stamina you may be travelling one mall to other and on one side of the road to the other side without really knowing that you have gone to another mall of on the other side of the street. I feel it is the best example of urban design. There is no mixing of traffic and senior citizen and pedestrian can walk freely with amenities located at suitable points.
,,Orchard Road stroll,4.0,,"Great Road full of restaurants, cafes, accommodation, shops and much more. An easy walk from our hotel to enjoy the area."
,,It is a road full stop,3.0,,"What would you expect it is a wide busy city world with lots of buses and taxis and a few expensive shops, if the sun shines who cares"

,,Great shops and shopping,5.0,,"I had to see 'Orchard Road' I used to sell my bronze sculpture to a very high-end Art Gallery here! Since I was in Singapore finally, I just had to go see where I had sold so many of my bronze sculptures over the years. I was in the Loe-Van Gallery at the time."
,,Lots and lots and more stores,5.0,,If shopping for designer names is your reason to come to Singapore Orchard Road is a must. But be aware that you probably pay more her than if you go to one of the not so glizzy malls ins the suburbs.
,,Any shopping street in the world,3.0,,"Omotesando, champs élysées, fifth ave - you’ll find pretty much the same shops there as on Orchard road. The main shopping street in Singapore infested with malls. You can give this area a miss if you’re not into High Street shopping."
,,The Business Meet,5.0,,"The shopping heaven in Singapore, lots of shopping mall, and also the existence of hotels along the road, make it easier for the business traveller to move around, the MRT at the underground of along the road."
,,Gone with time?,3.0,,"Being the oldest yet modern shopping area in Singapore, it seems now that competition from newer malls such as mbs (for high end brands) and mid range retail in heartland areas in this island has taken it's shoppers. Still i like this area as thus was where the 70's-90's born islanders hand out. Still attractive to me."
,,Busy,4.0,,Back to back shopping malls - if youre looking to empty your wallet and max out the credit card this is the place to go. Also great for getting out of the Singapore's afternoon heat.

,,So much shopping!,3.0,,"I might be the only human I'm earth who does not want to do any sort of shopping while traveling. Having said that, I had little use for Orchard Road.

,,Orchard road,5.0,,Lovely place too shop till u drop all top brand designer shops loads of restaurants to eat hotels to stay and lucky plaza is the best
,,Incredible number of high class shops on the same road!,4.0,,Orchard road offers a spectacular number of shopping malls with literally every conceivable luxury brand often represented several times as well as very local smaller shops.
,,Great hotels and shops,4.0,,"Considering that Orchard Road was indeed filled with orchards, it is hard to comprehend the change in use. Now, you have some of the best shopping in Singapore, without a doubt. While this is not my thing, I can understand the attraction to this kind of environment. If shopping is for you, then Orchard Road awaits you and your credit card. The best of luck."
,,A sort of extra long Oxford Street,4.0,,Some or indeed most of the worlds posh-ist shops. But many of them are linked under ground in air-conditioned malls which also connect to the trains. The shops are so posh I would feel intimidated to walk in!
,,"If you're into shopping, go here.",3.0,,"If you are not into shopping, like I am, then it's not the place for you. It may be good to walk around the area for an afternoon, grab something to eat, and wander through the numerous malls. The stores are a mix of everything to high-end luxury to low-cost retail stalls."
,,Over rated,3.0,,"I was so excited about going to orchard rd. My husband had told me so much about it. We both went disappointed reminds me of big version of David Jones.

You will even find many small stores like City plaza etc. too here and they all have a lot of average brands too. Don't forget to shop from Charles and Keith, as the brand boast a bomb price in other countries but being a Singaporean brand its pretty pocket friendly here. You can check it out and get surprised yourself."
,,Is a must,4.0,,"Orchard road is a must place to visit, lots of establishments to see. You could also visit this place before going home to buy different kinds of souvenirs."
,,Shop til you Drop,4.0,,"Literally, shop til you drop. The street is not so long as it is deceiving. Aligned with multi-storey malls that stem well underground forging a seamless link of air-conditioned shops.

Elevators and escalators in most. Street level has most with easy to access ramp and elevators.

Shops. Many luxury high end LV, Gucci etc with a few cheaper stores such as Sephora, Adidas, Factorie.

The train MRT is located under these malls with main stations for Orchard Rd shops being Orchard and Somerset.

Full levels of food outlets are located either basements or top levels.

Bars are not many so easiest to locate inside a big hotel or look up before you travel.

Well worth a look

,,Mile after mile of mall after mall,3.0,,Used to be an iconic shopping district but these days is simply a tourist trap on steroids. Gone are the days when you actually came to Orchard for actual shopping. Far better alternatives are available online and in neighbouring Malaysia. Pretty buildings and glass-clad facades hide the slow decline of the retail sector in Singapore.
,,Long walk down an expensive street,4.0,,"Worth taking the time to walk down this main street and call into as many shops and department stores as possible, there are many and start from small ""market style stalls"" to mega shopping malls which cater for every taste and wallet. Be wary of the opening times which seem to be from around 10.30 to 11.00 and suddenly morph into the lunch-hour rush if you get hungry, a place you have to stroll down tho'"
,,Orchard rd,4.0,,"Felt very safe, everyone speaks English, lots to see, heaps of shopping centres, very clean, chewing gum is illegal!"
,,Shopping shopping shopping,3.0,,"Orchard is a road full of high end malls and expensive eating. If one can afford it, it's the place to be. Don't expect bargains or savings. ION mall has an extraordinary design, both inside and outside and it's a beautiful site that help Orchard to be better for the eyes."
,,Good for shopping or an afternoon walk in the air conditioning,5.0,,Went here to find Lush Cosmetics. It was a quick and easy trip although not all stores are marked in the directory. Plenty of stores to check out and overall just a decent place to wander around in the heat of the afternoon.
,,Great shopping street,4.0,,"This is a street where you can find outlets for almost of the international upmarket retail names. But also some dirt cheap bargains from shops unknown outside Singapore. Easy to reach by metro, alighting at Orchard station lets you start at one end.
Not to be missed by serious shoppers."

,,"Walk, Walk, Walk",5.0,,"This is the road to do if you want o see the shops. All air conditioned they go down 4 floors and up.

Be warned its, very humid, but a good downpour of warm rain helps."
,,Fun!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the main shopping street of Singapore frequented by locals as well as tourists. Named after the fruit orchards that the road led to, Orchard Road is has malls, cafes, nice restaurants, nightclubs and hotels. Orchard Road is famous for its over the top Christmas decorations.

,,"Fusion of NY Fifth Ave, Avenue des Champs-Élysées Regent St. and Rodeo Drive!",5.0,,Name a top end designer and you will find their shop here. Slick and expensive. At least take a taxi ride down the length of Orchard road. Jaw dropping opulence.
,,Shopping and Everything here..,4.0,,"You have never visited Singapore if you did not go and drop to this place. Whether the purpose is to shop, eat, watch a movie, stay in a hotel or stroll, this long stretch should be a must visit. The gigantic malls such as ION Orchard, Wisma and Takashimaya is good place and shop till you drop. Hotels like Hilton, Marriott, Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Orchard and Orchard Hotel is located around this area so if you want to have convenience to shop anytime around the area, consider going to this place.
Avoid Sundays though as it is pretty much crowded especially at the Lucky Plaza area."
,,Expense no object,5.0,,"Changed beyond all recognition since my last visit, a vista of arcades and beautiful stores. All the world top brands adorn it with sadly not a lot of the old road shops. Thai embassy is still there thank goodness."
,,One of the world’s classic walks,5.0,,"My wife and I took a leisurely stroll down Orchard Road this past Saturday. Great separation of pedestrians and vehicles, beautiful landscaping, extremely clean and tidy - and some shops to spend serious amounts of money! A ‘must do’ in Singapore."

,,Very convenient place for pedestrians,5.0,,"This road provides a wide enough space for pedestrians. We are spoiled with luxurious and magnificent buildings around it. When the night comes, we are again spoiled with the colorful lights coming out of the buildings. So beautiful.
Every time to Singapore, we never miss this road. A must for us to come here."
,,Excellent place,5.0,,You name the brand and you find it in orchard road. Multiple branded shops independent and in malls in a row on both side of the road.
,,SO. MUCH. SHOPPING.,5.0,,"There are SO MANY shopping malls and stores along Orchard Road, many familiar designers and plenty that we do not have in the US. I spent a lot of time exploring up and down Orchard, it's definitely a must see."

,,Love the underground passages,4.0,,"Its great to avoid the humidity and heat outside by navigating your way around via the underground. Starting at Orchard station there are 4-5 major shopping centres all hooked up and this is the premier way to cross the road around Orchard. Like SIngapore, all very functional."
,,Too Crowded,3.0,,"We visited this street to look at the great Christmas decorations especially the lights,and the Christmas decorations was just awesome.

The down side was that,the street on Christmas eve was too crowded,there was no place to put a leg,we had little children with us,we just had to leave"
,,Getting around is easy but shopping is very expensive,4.0,,"Over the years, Singapore has developed an underground passage that makes shopping convenient -- given that Singapore is hot and humid weather all throughout the year. It was nice being able to walk around in air conditioned walkways or at least protected from the elements and the sun! But shopping in Singapore is very expensive. Very pricey! Am not sure if it is because of the importation tax."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"What you see on the surface, is not all that is available. You have to go underground to find what us really on offer to see. Really it is more suitable to those who are fully active. Many things in Singapore seem to have gone underground now. Completely different to what it was like in tge 70s"
,,SHOPPING +++,4.0,,"Wide Road ...use the subway to cross! Busy, hot, lots of designer shops. If a visitor, do your homework before you visit."

,,Good !,4.0,,"Stayed in the nearby Orchard Hotel, Greta shops , Restaurants, Coffee shops all close by. Near to MRT station ,"
,,Interesting for tourist & locals,5.0,,My family & I visited Orchard road last month. We parked at Orchard Central carpark for our dinner & told a stroll down Orchard Road after our dinner. The sidewalks were well designed for pedestrains & lined with interesting eateries & shops to entertain everyone.
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Singapore’s answer to Oxford Street - our hotel was situated at the start of Orchard Road which is a wide avenue at great length home to many shopping malls.

As my picture shows, modern buildings shroud the small traditional colonial buildings and you need to keep your eyes peeled to spot them.

It’s a shame that these buildings are not preserved more and that they have become a rarity to see with the imposing new buildings - it’s still very impressive."
,,Great for high end shopping,5.0,,"This is definitely one of the famous shopping areas in Singapore ... the most chic and expensive, I should say. Orchard Road is where shops of the world's biggest brands in fashion accessories (like Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior, Ralph Lauren, Boss, Fendi, etc.) rub elbows. Aside from shops and boutiques, there are also hotels, cafes, restaurants, and entertainment centers in the area. It is certainly one place to splash out on jewelries, clothing and other fashion items! But even if you don't buy things along Orchard Road, a stroll along the road is an experience in itself. Window shopping will do. :D"
,,Dissapointed at the change,3.0,,I was here 25 years ago and all that has been pulled down and replaced by huge mals - Marks and Sparks as well as other shops we get it UK ... we were looking for Singapore products but not so many of those - glad to make a quick getaway on the transit. This road is highly overated.
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"If you're not careful, any credit card may end up in an intensive care unit! Along Orchard Rd are a number of shopping malls all of which seek to relieve you of your money. Top names through to cheaper options abound all along this amazing road. Restaurants are plentiful if you need to refuel.
Probably the best time to visit is during the Christmas season when the festive lights present a brilliant spectacle. Check with the website for when the lights are switched on...usually around the end of November. Photo opportunities abound particularly at Christmas time.
There are a number of MRT stations and a regular bus service. Most of the shops offer tourists the chance to claim the sales tax back when leaving Singapore so if you are spending a significant amount of money, make sure you are provided with the necessary receipts."
,,Awesome for Shopaholic,5.0,,If you love shopping then dont miss this out. Lots of small vendors as well big brand stores on this road.
,,Shopaholic,4.0,,"FUll on with expensive shopping malls, also have some cheap street market type in between.

If you like shopping on Oxford Street in London you will definitely like this place."
,,Mall mile,5.0,,20 malls on both sides of the road no diff wry than a street in Munich or Amsterdam. Buzzing with activities and curb sides parties😊. The road was decked pup in orchids and lanterns for Chinese New Year.
,,WORLD CLASS HIGH END SHOPPING,4.0,,"Spin you around and you will not be able to tell which world class city you are in and the shopping supports it.

The malls and stores along Orchard Road cover all the expensive things in life and do it well in a beautiful setting. Clothes, jewelry, food, services, they are all here and the staff is generally trained to provide the appropriate level service.

In one mall I took advantage of the consierge service to get a taxi. She ordered it, refused a tip and when I did not see it came out side and led me to the taxi! - service"
,,"Different time, different themes, same crowd",4.0,,"This place is always fascinated me with its theme decorations. This time I visited it in the month of February and they made over the road and shop windows with theme of welcoming lunar new year (year of dog) so you could see many decorations with dog's theme, and also welcoming Valentine's day.

It was bright and cheerful and I enjoyed window shopping.

Sitting in front of Ion mall, on the stone stairs while listening to street musicians, seeing birds playing around and eating bread ice cream costed me only $1.20.

Enjoyed the evening until the lights on."

It's also a great relief from the weather as many of the malls are underground. If your travelling with kids and unsure or their turning their noses up at the traditional hawker markets, then most malls have a sanitised version of hawker stalls. Generally they are located on the ground or top floor of the malls and they are only slightly dearer than the street version but kids and/or yourself may prefer."

,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is full of large modern shopping mauls.it is a shoppers paradise so you

,,Shopping Variety,4.0,,"From bargain shops to Tiffany, you can find it all here on Orchard Rd.

Even as a walk around, 5 or 6 hours would hardly get you to see it all. Most of the buildings are connected, so on a rainy day, you can almost stay dry but better to have an umbrella in case."

You can find everything you need in this Street such as grocery store, pharmacy, big brand stores, department store "" Takashimaya"" , and so many malls along the street.

If you are younger I recommend far east plaza for younger and cheaper products, and lucky plaza for electronics.

I also recommend visiting level 12 of Orchard Central, a free public viewing area of orchard road and around. Closest mrt station is Somerset!"
,,Expensive. Not that interesting,2.0,,"This giant road is full of expensive shops.
The road is beautiful by night, with all these shops with all the lights.. but.. waste of electricity, just to blow your mind with it.
I'm not a fan of these kind of things, sorry.

There are so many stores and so many levels at most venues that it is often very difficult to know where to look for a specific store. In general, food offerings are on the lowest level or two, with a variety of stand alone shops, often high end, on the other floors. It is hard to imagine how all of the high end shops survive! Great road for strolling, window shopping, and eating, well served by the immaculate and efficient MRT."
,,The Beverly Hills of the West,5.0,,Whatever high end store you can imagine will be found on Orchard Road. This is a shopaholics dream!

,,"Orcahrd Road, Singapore.",4.0,,"This main road in Singapore, is one of the best areas to stay in. There are many shopping malls, restaurants, pubs, leafy wide streets to stroll along, but maybe the highlight in retail therapy, would be the Singapura Plaza - a large Mall on several floors, housing many well known retail outlets, designer or not, Marks and Spencer, Hamley Toys which first opened in London in 1780, and many others."

,,Lots of malls,4.0,,"This is a wonderful road for those people who like shopping. There are many different malls, ranging from high end to those not so high end. However there seem to be a lot of the same shops at different points along the road. It is a very clean street and can be busy at times. There are many eateries on this road, and I would be surprised if you couldn't find somewhere to beat the hunger pains. There are points where to get to the other side of the road, you do have to use the underground walkways. These are also full of shops and appear to be part of some of the malls. Worth it just to have a look."

,,Shopping heaven!,4.0,,"So many malls...so little time!
From H & M, top shop, forever 21 to Chanel, Tiffany and everything in between. You could stay a month in Singapore and not see all the stores. There were also food courts and cafes to recharge.
Great fun for me and my young adult daughter!"
,,Getting bigger but not necessarily better,4.0,,"Have been visiting Orchard Rd on and off for about 30 years. In that time it has grown and new stores opened. However, with the odd exception, you feel as if all the stores are the same just in a different setting.

It's still clean and tout free and the stores are very well presented. A few tired buildings such as Lucky Plaza, etc but on the whole still a must visit if you need to shop. Less electronics stores than in previous years.

Well served by 3 MRT stations which links Orchard Rd to other shopping precincts such as City Hall and buses service the area as well. Cinemas and eateries are plentiful."
,,From Rags to Riches,5.0,,The place has the best of the brands to collection from all the neighboring countries. Don't miss out on visiting here as the best foot crowd can be found here. The deals are reasonable and the products were authentic. Do exercise discretion as they might try to make a run for it but the deals offered are very cheap compartively.
,,Great if you are a shopping addict,2.0,,"Yes but I am not! I found this by far the worst area in Singapore. Just like malls in Hong Kong, or anywhere else. Made me feel ill!
If you need to escape while your friends/ partner shops here, I suggest heading west to The Botanical Gardens - calm, natural and it’s free!"
,,High end strip of malls,5.0,,"Shopping is the only language here, and all malls sell the luxury items you can think about. This short area of commercial real estate can easily tire you out because of the footwork you have to do go from one mall to another."
,,Shops and very clean,3.0,,A famous shopping street in Sinapore. Pretty area and buildings very safe to walk around alone day or night.
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,"Not a big shopper, we nonetheless had to go to Orchard Road and it lives up to its reputation as the Shopping Capital of the World. There are just wall to wall malls and really interesting artwork to add variety - there is nothing you can't buy. And on a hot Singapore evening the lighting is beautiful and the shops delicously cool"
,,crowded,2.0,,We went on a Sunday and everything which was not overpriced was over run by people. But there are several eateries for all budgets in the shopping center. My wife liked it but I would try not to go back.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Brands, Top Hotels, food courts, pubs, music very upfront market and shopping paradise for all. Stroll on the Orchard Road will fascinate you to spend full evening in the area. You can see this place as the most lively place in Singapore. Shop, fine or just walk around in and out of the shopping complexes.."
,,A decadent area,4.0,,"Loved the layout of the area, and some of the shopping malls were amazing. Unlike other cities there is a distinct absence of both graffiti & rubbish. I truly envy Singapore on this aspect. However, this particular area was just overly prententious for my liking with Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Rolex etc - and similar brand names dominating the area. Not for me but if you do love that materialism then definitely put this place on your list. You would find these global brand names in most cities. If you block the dominance of these shops from your view there are the cheaper market shops nestled in the area. But this area really is the top end for shopping.

If you have been to and/or staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel then Orchard Road will have no surprises as many of those same luxury stores are at that hotel also.

Last thing, this is an extremely high volume pedestrian area particularly at the shopping centre at the Orchard MRT. Incredible as it is around this area - the crowd congestion is high."
,,Holiday.,1.0,,So busy place . So beautifull place .can c alot forieners in this place . Nice shopping nice foods . Nice people in singapore.
,,Famously known in Singapore,4.0,,"Now whether you are a shopper or not, Orchard Rd is famously known and you might like to experience walking along the street just to experience the buzz. If you go on a weekend specifically Sunday it can get quite busy and congested with people. The whole street is lined with one shopping mall after another. Easy to get to by public transport on the MRT or by bus. Lots of food outlets. If you are keen you can walk the stretch from one end (starting at Tangs) right down to the other end."
,,Congested shopping street,1.0,,"Once the main drag of Singapore, no I consider not worth going to crowded, smokey hot, large endless shopping complex. Probably ok for people watching, easily accessible via MRT"
,,Experience,3.0,,Good as an experience but I would say there are just as many shopping malls on the fringes that are as good if not better. Good to walk through though
,,Shopping street,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopping street for both locals and tourists. It has many shops and malls when you walk down Orchard Road. Some malls include ION Orchard, Wisma Atria, Paragon, Apple Orchard Road and 313@Somerset.

There are many hotels situated along Orchard Road such as Grand Park Orchard, Mandarin Orchard, Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre, Hotel Jen Orchard Gateway and Hilton Singapore.

It is advisable to walk or take the public transport when you are planning to travel there during weekends and public holidays. The road will be congested during peak hours and the jam will be bad enough to add 30 minutes to your travel time."
,,Like Oxford street but longer,5.0,,"When we come to Singapore our first walk is Orchard street as a ritual ..We do not need nothing to buy, but richness of huge shopping malls , crowds of walkers (elbous sometimes needed to clean way forward..).

,,Best place for Shopping in Singapore,5.0,,"I loved this place , this place have lots of shopping mall next to each other , almost all good brands shops are available for shopping with discounted price ."
,,So many shops!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is an experience. During special occasions, especially Christmas, the street is decorated to the hilt so is a must-see at night. The almost continual mall-after-mall is also a thing to be seen. I must say that I was surprised after entering about 4 malls in one day that I was unable to find any with home-wares (I was hunting for a coffee plunger). But food and fashion go on and on"
,,great shopping!,5.0,,if you have the money and stamina .. go there! you can buy absolutely anything here from the most upscale to the cheapest tat. even if you don't intent to shop it is worth visiting while in Singapore.
,,Heaven for shopaholic!,4.0,,There are a lots of brandnames and local brands here. And most of them are cheaper than the other place. Shopaholic should miss this place.
,,High end street😊,3.0,,Went there on last dec. From where i stayed which is in Bugis Street..i took Bugis Mrt to Orchard Mrt. U need to changed from the green line to the red line at the city hall station. It cost u $1.50 = rm4.80 so i just went to this Ion Mall just to bought this Awfully Chocolate and also Pablo cheesetart at Atrium Mall.
,,Haute couture at its finest,5.0,,"You will be forgiven if you think you've stepped into Paris or Milan. All the renowned branded shops line the shoppers paradise.

Even if you can't afford to splurge, window gazing is highly recommended. A whistle stop tour over several days would be the way to go!

Lucky Plaza is the place to go, though, if you need to pick up some cheap souvenirs of your stay.

I always step into Tangs and Robinsons anyway, during every visit to Singapore, and am never disappointed. Perennial favourites. The road is well populated by buses and the MRT is within walking distance, but a taxi ride, especially after an exhausting day of shopping, is preferred. It may be difficult to find taxis during peak seasons and certain times of the day,

Well worth a visit especially during the Christmas season when the road is beautifully decorated with lights and throbs with the rhythms of pop and classical music."
,,Great place for shopping!,5.0,,This is the place for shopaholic! All different type of brands that you can think of... this is the place to be. Have great deals as well. Better wear your walking shoes to enjoy the walk!
,,方便shopping,5.0,,"很好呀，我出去有下雨！在地下地穿來穿去很方便，差不多每個shopping mall都有food court,真的不怕行到餓，無地方食野，但買野方面，1月是有discount 要很有心機揾，因為他們款色是hk的上一季，幾間department store 賣的牌子也差不多"
,,Over crowded,4.0,,Don’t go on festival season as it very crowded with tourists and I find it difficult to walk around with young children. Over crowded.
,,The centre of the city,5.0,,It's the place where all the tourist go to. The best place for shopping and franchise shops can be found here.
,,Short stopover,4.0,,Orchard rd had a fantastic array of shopping. Much of the focus is on boutique shops though. My wife and daughter loved it
,,Happening place!!,5.0,,A very vibrant place throughout the year but more charming during Christmas and New Year with beautiful decorations .. a must visit for Singapore visitors .. lot of high end shipping .. some mid range also .. many eating places and hotels also..
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Orchard road is filled with shopping centers for people that want to splash out. Many places to buy most things, including jewelry. I found Taka on Orchard street excellent for good quality diamonds"
,,So Much Shopping!,5.0,,"I applaud anyone who can visit all the shopping that Orchard Road has to offer. There are shopping complexes upon shopping complexes, all offering largely the same thing but each more elaborate than the last.

There are some great restaurants nestled in among all that shopping too, spanning from fine dining (usually on one the higher floors of the complex) to hawker halls (in the basement)."
,,Best shopping in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are a shopaholic, then this is the best place to be. World class malls, high street stores and many of the best high brands worldwide are at your disposal."
,,Underground shopping center,5.0,,"This shopping experience is underground, like 5 or 6 levels underground with shops everywhere extending for blocks. A great experience though I did not buy much."
,,Pace yourself,4.0,,This is certainly not a quick shopping trip as you will spend the better half of the day strolling up and visiting the shops. I suggest catching a cab back if you find yourself to have wondered far away from your hotel and don't feel like walking back. Shops open around 10-11am.
,,Like any busy shopping area,4.0,,Lots of designer names and decent restaurants available. Nicely lit up with Christmas decorations giving a good festive feel.
,,Singapore Shopping at Christmas!,4.0,,"My wife and I started a cruise in Singapore a few days before Christmas. Our hotel was just above Orchard Road, so we decided to take a stroll. Basically, everything you might want - from extremely high end goods to tourist garbage - is here. It was a bit crowded at times, but really very walkable overall. Well worth a couple of hours."
,,Everything possible,4.0,,"Everything you can imagine. The highest of high end to average of best. Nothing missing here, it's got the lot."
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,This place is great below and above the ground. Everything you need can be found here and it was beatifully decorated during christmas time!
,,Shopping heaven on a diamond stick,5.0,,Money buys almost anything and money buys you lots in Orchard Street. Orchard Street is a shopaholics fantasy if you have the money you can shop to your hearts content or at least until the plastic maxes out which might be after the first purchase if you shop at the 'right' shop. Even an old anti-shopper like me enjoyed window shopping in Orchard Road in the days leading up to Christmas. I might even have bought some pressies just don't tell the wife as they were for me.
,,Nice,5.0,,This place is just remind me as I'm in New York's Times Square! All the bands are nice and cheap as well! I enjoyed shop while i was in Singapore! Best place to shop!
,,Must visit place on your Singapore trip,5.0,,You simply cannot miss this place. Walk and spend an entire half a day either shopping or by just window shopping. I visited during Christmas and enjoyed Christmas lighting and decorations. It was awesome.
,,Close to the Center of downtown,4.0,,We stayed at the Holiday Inn Hotel Orchard Downtown and it was very close to everything. Across the street from the hotel are shops and restaurants and bus stations. And since it was December all the shops and the streets were decorated with Christmas lights and Christmas displays. We walked at night and enjoyed the Christmas exhibits.
,,Central of attraction,5.0,,"You must go to orchad if u were in singapore. There are a lot of attraction, restaurant, mall, etc Don't forget to visit donki in orchad central to buy japanese things. This supermarket just opened in dec 17"
,,Just the place for shopaholics,5.0,,Very busy bustling street with more shops than you could ever want. Most of them are the up market stores but also lots of centres. Shoppers dream.
,,Gucci Gang,5.0,,Found my sliders here. Lovely shops. Great vibe. Lovely people. Soo much to buy and also to eat. This street doesn’t sleep
,,"Crowded, amazing for Shopping-lovers",3.0,,"This place is full of malls and shops and Cafés. If you like to shop this is perfect for you! Even if you're a traveller you can enjoy a cup of coffee in one of the Coffee-shops.
Nice to see, but don't spend too much time if you're not ging to shop."
,,High end shopping,3.0,,"We stayed at the Mandarin Orchard hotel specifically to be on this road. I remembered from my last visit, 12 years ago how much fun it was to shop here. Things have changed a lot! Gone are the small stalls selling a myriad of fun souvenirs and reasonable clothing. All replaced by very high end or chain stores. No bargains to be found here and nothing that I couldn’t find in the North America. If I could rebook my hotel I would choose somewhere else rather than spending $600 per night to be on this road."
,,Orchard road at Christmas time a delight,4.0,,"Orchard road has to be one of THE places to be at Christmas time.
The whole road was beautifully decorated with businesses vying to have the best shop decorations etc.This has to be one of THE places in the world to be at this time of the year. Congratulations Singapore !"
,,Great shopping,3.0,,"Orchard road really is the heart of singapore especially if you’re looking for major brands like Gucci, Prada, LV, etc.

There are other centers like Lucky plaza which cater for people who aren’t too fussy about name brands. You can really find some great deals here especially on perfumes and electronic goods.

Lots of food kiosk along both sides of the road."
,,sea of people,4.0,,Went there a couple of days before NYE and my goodness it was crowded! A bustling commercial road full of mega brands and bargain hunters. Many malls have excellent food halls.
,,Oh...Orchard!,5.0,,"The once-in-while visit to Orchard Road definitely enlivens the spirits as the ‘feel good’ is in the air. The shoppers, enthusiastic tourists, the fashionistas, the ever-in-a-hurry bankers, students and the omnipresent housewives....you will find them all here, lending a distinct character in making Orchard what it is. For me Orchard is a state of mind which never fails to surprise me. The last time I was there (sometime during X’mas) I saw a superhero waiting at the pedestrian crossing...yes you read correct, an adult clad in a Spiderman suit! Singers, living statues, musicians....they all come to Orchard to showcase their talents and of course entertain the passersby.
All of Orchard and including the stretch, from Ion through Ngee Ann to Somerset 313, is bustling and thriving at any time of the day. The innumerable number of shopping options cover the entire gamut from the high-end to the other end of the spectrum. Food is not far away from shopping….lots of options to choose from the various restaurants and eateries in the malls.
Even if you don't have to or don't want to shop, head to Orchard every once in a while if you live in Singapore, or if you are a visitor, I would suggest you definitely put Orchard on your itinerary."
,,Shopping!,4.0,,"This is a shoppers paradise, mall after mall. All the brands you could ever think of, from high end to budget. Definitely a must visit when in Singapore if you have money to spend!"
,,Wonderful commercial place to shop and walk,5.0,,"Excellent malls are available on both sides of the road, selling all branded products. Great place to shop if there is plan for expensive purchases.
Few road-side shops are available selling ice-cream with bread or biscuit. This is a must-to-have.
Evening time is the best time to visit this place, to enjoy the cool breeze and the colorful lighting. Easily accessible through SMRT."
,,Interesting & Good Shopping,4.0,,"Lots of department stores, malls, restaurants, designer brands. Stores are open late every night. Fantastic Christmas Decorations at Christmas time. Can find just about anything at all you are looking for just in this one street and seems every brand, including designer brands is represented by a store. A must do if in Singapore and has several MRT stops at different locations along Orchard Road in addition to buses, and taxi's."
,,Does Orchard Road needs to re invent itself ?,3.0,,"On the surface it looks like a shopping paradise for only high end rich people looking with the posh and sparkling facades. However if you look deeper , you might find affordable goods in Lucky Plaza. Tang and Isetan caters for the middle class segment i feel .

However everybody year around late november, Orchard Road lights up the masses with christmas lights and trees (though the plasticity sort)

For tourists from the region, this is must visit sight for tourists but this year’s christmas street decor is underwhelming.

Happy holidays and Merry Christmas !"
,,Orchard road or Shopping mall avenue,5.0,,"Great street lined with shopping malls on each side of the street, and all type of stores. With Orchard Plaza at one end, and Ion Orchard at the other end, you are sure to find what you are looking for, although not exactly at cheap prices. Best recommendation is to wear a pair of comfortable shoes and take the subway at either end to return to the starting point."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,Be prepared to see Rodeo Dr. but supersized. Shops and stores art galleries and major designers. An interesting experience unlike anywhere else.
,,Suitable for shopaholic,5.0,,This road is a shopping paradise. It’s feel like all the Singapore shopping center are gather in here. And the mrt under Ion Mall is really convenient for everyone to go to anywhere.
,,The Elite Road of Shoppers!,5.0,,"The place in Singapore where you can find the ""branded"" shops like Chanel and other expensive things!"
,,Stunning lights huge crowds,4.0,,We walked through Orchards road on the 24th. The Christmas lights were magical but there was a huge number of people. We panicked due to crowds at some places and had to tighten our hold on the kids but the magical lights made up for it. A must visit with kids. Just go very early.......
,,Orchard Road For shopping and Food,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a busy area where the whole stretch of the road is buildings of shops after one another. From Orchard MRT to Dhoby Ghaut MRT, just get off the stations, there are shops for clothes, shoes , electrical. There are designer shops at Paragon and Ngee Ann City and Ion. There are department shops Tangs, Takashimaya and Metro . There is also no shortage of food in these area. There are many popular resturants such as Ding Tai Fung, and plenty of food court located either at the basement of the shops buildings and some are located on the top floor. Avoid weekends as the foreign domestic helpers like to hang out in Orchard on Sat and Sun. Go on weekday for an enjoyable shopping experience."
,,Disappointed,2.0,,After the high recommendations from several tour guides we decided to give it a go. The mall is so confusing to navigate and took us 45 minutes to find a shop even with the electronic maps they provide.
,,Vibrant and happening place,5.0,,"We reached around 10 PM and it was still packed, colorful, vibrant and buzzing with activity. Excellent sale was going on and could pick few things."
,,Shopping at its best,5.0,,The Orchad Road is definitely a famous place of Singapore. You can shop until you drop. You find everything over there.
,,Singapore's Shopping Street,3.0,,"All the major brands in the world seem to be represented here.
Pro: very safe and clean, not as crowded as Hong Kong.
Cons:same shops and brands that you'll see everywhere else in our globalised world. Price wise, Orchard Road is no shoppers' paradise. It's no cheaper than London's Oxford Street or New York's Fifth Ave. And with sales tax, you need to claim a refund when you leave the country, losing a few percent to admin charges handling the refund. Good stuff unique to Singapore are all edible and perishable."
,,Christmas lights and window shopping,5.0,,A great walk looking at Christmas lights and window shopping. A busy strip but didnt feel hassled or stressed at any time. Under / overpass navigation was an adventure at times - but we found our way in the end. Some decent priced shops nestled in with the high end designer good...if you look you can find them. A beautiful street in an amazing city
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"I used to enjoy strolling along Orchard but not anymore. Too crowded, too many people like cendol and it's very noisy."
,,Shop in the crowd,3.0,,"Firstly, your experience will really depends on when you are here. I love to go during the off peak timing in the afternoon of a weekday, enjoy a quiet lunch, maybe catch coffee at a cafe and shop a little. Mostly windows shopping though, as there are lots of branded shops here, in fact, most of them are gathered here.

During Christmas there is lighting and decoration done, but it is not impressive at all.

If you are here during the weekend or after 7pm, be prepared for a large crowd and you may have to end up queuing everywhere. The traffic is terrible too."
,,Just another shopping area,2.0,,"Well, this could be any where in the world, no reason to go to Singapore for this, same stores as in Stockholm, Lissabon, NY or Berlin"
,,Good place for high end shopping,4.0,,It’s one of the loveliest place I have been too with many malls with big brands. This place is fully lighted up and very lively it’s heaven for shopaholics.
,,Vibrant Shopping Street,4.0,,Providing the world's top end luxury brands alongside budget shopping avenues is Orchard Road for you.Beautifully lit up for Christmas and New years it is a shoppers delight !
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",5.0,,"If you like shops this is the place for you. Shops, shops, and more shops, as far as your eyeballs can see. You have got to love shopping to go the distance and experience them all, an insane number of shops, humanly impossible to do the whole lot in a day."
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"This is the place to be if shopping is your cup o feta, there are shops, shops and more shops. With most buildings connected to the MRT stations via underground walkways, doesn’t matter if it rains or shines, you can get from on RTO the other without getting wet or hot. Very busy during Christmas lead up, also great place to “people watch”."
,,Such a lovely road for excitement and buzz!,5.0,,This Road was UH-Mazing during Christmas! The decorations and people brought out the Spirit of Christmas! The Chocolate Shop in Luck Plaza has awesome chocolates and GOOD prices!
,,Shop untill you drop,4.0,,"This one place all sort of showrooms. You may buy HnM till AnF from here. Look out for local markets, which are more interesting."
,,Look at the Crowd!!,5.0,,Were visit here during christmas eve 2017 and look at those crowd! but were really amazed by all those christmas decoration and the road still clean and passable.
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"This is the place to go for shopping, especially for designer brands. We were here at the end of November when Orchard Road and the various shopping centres were decorated for Christmas and it was spectacular!"
,,A shopping paradise,4.0,,"There is no brand that you will not find here and every kind of pocket will find a shopper's paradise. A lot of places to eat and drink will make sure you never drop if you shop. Wouldn't that be the best!
You will see a lot of street performers and the walk around the road is entertaining and tempting. The place does get crowded at times, so be prepared for that. You can easily spend hours here, window shopping or tightening your pocket.
You can easily get here by bus or by by the MRT. A lot of eating joints around the area will ensure you stay fed. Water bottles can be slightly tricky to get, either it is not available or available at an extremely high price. If you could carry one along, that would be ideal."
,,Speechless,5.0,,"Gobsmacked! Milan Paris London and New York all covered on Orchard. No need to fly around the world to visit the designer stores. It’s all here Speechless , I tell you...."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,This is a very busy street with many shops and malls. I would certainly recommend it if you have the time to visit or if in your country you don't have these stores.
,,Superb Shopping District,5.0,,"The top brands of the world have congregated at one location...the area is connected with entire Singapore, hence accessibility is great... Look around and shop with ease....Don't forget to check out the Sale at various outlets..."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"The shopping hub for Singapore, there is not much tou can't find along the myriad of shopping centres along Orchard Road. The Christmas lights were fantastic. Plenty to see and do. So many choices for places to eat. Public transport to and from is a breeze."
,,Best time to hit up Orchard,4.0,,"If you want to avoid the masses of people shopping PLUS get first access to the abundance of shops starting huge sales is ""early"" in the morning. We went yesterday (1st of Jan) knowing the locals would still be deep asleep after their NYE celebrations (and their culture of sleeping through the morning). Even at 10-11am, you could stroll through empty malls, empty shops even empty Starbucks! The only ""crowd"" was at the food opera (court) but even then there was no issues finding tables."
,,Wayyyy too crowded,1.0,,"As it was a rainy day- options were quite limited so we headed to Orchard Road.

If you are from a country or town where you have high end shops everywhere Orchard Road is not worth the visit. The crowds of people are insane and you’ll spend the whole time navigating through people who seem to want to walk into you.

It’s quite claustrophobic and there were line ups to get into some of the bigger brand stores, so I️ would say not worth the trip."
,,Shopping district,5.0,,"This would probably be best described as the shopping capital of Singapore. This area is filled with malls of different sorts ranging from low end to really high end designer store kind of malls. Also , the road is filled with different restaurants, cafes, dessert places and all sorts of little boutiques, and souvenir stores and convenience stores as well. Itnis very easy to take the SMRT to go here or grab a cab to and from here. The atmosphere is great and the walk is very nice as well. A must when in Singapore ."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"If you somewhere to shop, this is the only road you need, shops after shops next to each other for miles. Any high end brand that you could think of, it’s there and plenty of foods the satisfy your tastebuds, from cheap and tasty to exquisite and burn your wallet"
,,Best shopping in the world,5.0,,In orchard road you can do the best shopping.. the best in the world. We love shopping and dinning and always a great and happy place to come back. High end shopping malls with all the tip brands. Christmas time the whole orchard road is decorated and its party atmosphere is brlliant love it
,,"Malls, malls, malls",4.0,,"This is a street of shopping malls! There are so many shops, mostly high end and worth a short walk and a look. Not heaps of food - it’s mostly inside the malls but still decent quality."
,,Busy but ordered.,4.0,,Orchard rd at Xmas time with its lighting looks sensational.It gets busy but not in a insecure way.It all seems to work in an orderly and respectful way.Oh those that want to shop knock yourself out!
,,Great Christmas lightnings,4.0,,"Came here with my friends to view the wonderful and well decorated Christmas lightnings. When I was young, I used to visit Orchard Road to catch the eye attracting Christmas lightnings in the year end holidays. It is really worth walking along Orchard Road as you get to see some street performances and visit shopping malls. The place is well keep cleaned and the directions to the shopping mall are quite clear."
,,Spectacular lights and decorations at Christmas time,5.0,,The Christmas decorations are the best we've seen anywhere in the world. We time our visits to Singapore to see the Christmas lights along Orchard Road and Tanglin Road. The shopping is also excellent (not cheap - but you can usually find everything you want).
,,The best shopping destination,5.0,,The Orchard road is the iconic shopping destination in Singapore. We visited the place a couple of weeks before Christmas and the place was decked up in lights and Christmas trees. There are a lot of hotels and brand outlets along the road. The best way to see around is to simply walk. The place can be easily reached using Singapore MRT.
,,"Nice to visit, bad for shopping",4.0,,"Most of the shops are closed at 21:30. Lack of restaurants, cafe and bars at night. Nice to visit but don’t buy anything."
,,Far out what a place,4.0,,"If shopping is your thing here is your heaven, if not it is worth a look anyway. It blows your mind that there are so many arcades full of tiny little shops as well as the large recognisable brands all crammed in this place, then you look across the road and there are the old buildings from a time Gone by just go-existing take s bud of the MTR and disk up the atmosphere"
,,"Can't miss this place, it has everything",5.0,,"Orchard Road is everything if not overwhelming. It's an iconic shopping strip that breathes life into Singapore and boasts local small businesses as well as international brands. Everything is connected by a series of underground tunnels so it's likely that you'll be able to avoid the ground level heat and humidity by taking the rat runs between shopping malls. In fact, you'll want for nothing because everything is available here; food, homewares, clothes, even a train home. And you won't get lost because Singapore is very easy to navigate regardless of language barrier. I'd recommend that you research whether your trip falls near a major holiday, as the shopping centres take any chance to celebrate the dollar. We went around Christmas and there was fanfare and tinsel and fake snow on every windowsill- an eye opening experience.
Spend a day wandering without any plans. You'll be able to amuse yourself for sure."
,,"You want shops, here it is!",5.0,,"There is everything you could want from shopping on this road. Top end centres like Ion, to Paragon and the lower end of the spectrum in the Lucky Plaza. There must be thousands of individual shops here.
There a lots of people as well, so can be rather crowded. Even if you are not into shopping, go and have a look. It is easy to get to as there is an MRT station at each end."
,,Very Christmassy,4.0,,"This street is so wonderful during Xmas time, with all the pretty light decorations and great cheers! Good for shopping too! From luxury designer brands to department stores, from high street brands to fast fashion brands, whatever you are looking for, it's there."
,,"A ""must go"" for families",5.0,,The place is OVERCROWDED and OverRated. I have went to Orchard Road in 2016 and I must say that the place is overcrowded with tourist-families.
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"very nice for shopping, eating, drinking. you can shop till you drop. reasonable prices too. good for walking window shopping"
,,The most happening road,5.0,,"This road can be called the heart of Singapore city
it has huge variety of malls, shopping places, hotels and commercial buildings
at any given time of the day you will find it bustling with localites and tourists alike
the nights are all light and show and make up for it to be most happening Road in the city
there is fancy shopping in the malls as welL as bargains on the roadside
no visit to the city is complete without atrip to the Orchard Roadl"
,,Wonderful Xmas lights!,5.0,,"It is worth a visit to Singapore at Xmas just to enjoy the magical Xmas lights, stretching from one end of Orchard Road to the other. Better than London’s Bond and Regent Street."
,,Massive,3.0,,"It’s a classic shopping street with all the traditional shops and malls. But Just couldn’t stop thinking about the massive overspending which takes place... but that’s just my problem these days. If you’re looking for shopping, it doesn’t come much better than this!"
,,The one and only road for shopping,5.0,,"Here on this long street, there are shopping centres and shops like pearls on a necklace, one better and more fun than the other. Clearly, you can't visit everyone, so choose where you want, using maps, Google and tips. Smart may be to start ""at the top"" at ION Shopping Centre and then work your way down depending on the stores and brands you are interested in. For us, who come from a very expensive country when it comes to taxi rides, it was cheap to take a taxi a few times on the road. Paragon, Orchard Shopping Center ... as mentioned, with a pair of good sneakers and bottled water in the fist you will come a long way.
PS. The thing with shoes is important if you're going to last! Do not forget your passport for any tax-free and proof of flying here with Singapore Airlines; sometimes it may be a discount!"
,,Too crowded,5.0,,I loved walking in this road..better at the night.. But so so so many people make you nervous.. If you have agoragobia it's not a good idea...
,,Singapore and All,5.0,,"Amazing! A very busy road, so many malls, stores abound, even in the subway. Great! Actually, not only Orchard Road, but the whole of Singapore. Will definitely go back to this country! Would have wanted to rate the country as a whole, excellent!"
,,I liked it,5.0,,"if you are looking for shopping and brands, this is a good place to be at. LV, Dior, etc. The walking area is really nice and you can see alot of tourists"
,,Busy shopping street you’ve seen it before,2.0,,"Came here only to pop into the Apple store to exchange an item. It’s a big shopping street with hundreds of people lusting over mediocre brands (Abercrombie and Fitch is still a thing?). It’s not cheaper than from home and it’s not local brands. If you want to see or do some cool unique luxe Singapore shopping go to the Shoppes next to / under the Marina Bay Sands. There’s an underground canal in the middle with boats you can ride in from one area of the shops to another, cool little enticement. Orchard St is just a tease."
,,Christmas crowded,4.0,,We came here on Christmas Eve night - while the lights were pretty the crowds were a nightmare. The crowd control was non existent with large parts of the pathways closed to pedestrians with no reason- causing further congestion. We wanted to just leave but took us over an hour to get on to the right side of the street.
,,Family trip to Singapore,5.0,,"Beautiful Christmas decorations throughout the entire area including shopping malls & street! During our visit there was the pre-Christmas sale going on, wow...good discount and really engaged you to shop....."

,,CROWDED and EXPENSIVE,2.0,,"when you need to shop with cheaper price, better you go to Mustafa and Chinatown or Bugis
Shopping in Orchard is very pricey

Orchard is suitable for sightseeing only
Last time I went there on 24 Dec, the street is very crowded and it is difficult to take a walk because so many people are here too :(

Not reccomended going to orchard in holiday season"

,,Shopping haven,5.0,,"This is the place to be for all the shopaholics. And with all the Christmas lights, this place just looks awesome."
,,Better Shopping Elsewhere.,3.0,,"Don’t get me wrong, you’ve got to go to Orchard Road, but really, there’s better and more interesting shopping elsewhere. There are plenty of shops you’ll find at home and some interesting department stores but if you’re after real Singapore, this is not the place. Try Little India, Bugis, Mustafa Centre and even Robinson’s Department store."

We hardly could walk as the road was packed with people. I might be wrong but I don’t recall orchard road being so pack during christmas 5 years ago. I guess it might have attracted more and more people during these 5 years time. Amazing!"
,,Best by foot,5.0,,walked along the street is like doing an exercise. Can easily burn fat and increase your stamina. There are push cart stalls selling food and stuff.
,,Shopping street. All the big brands. Nothing special,3.0,,"Singapore has lost of interesting corners to explore. Little India, Chinatown, etc. Orchard road while lively was a big of a disappointment. Just a string of department stores with all the usual brands. Fine for a walk if there but not worth a detour."
,,"Fun to visit a huge, world known shopping area",4.0,,"This easily accessible, giant shopping area has something for everyone. I had a wonderful dinner in a department store. I wanted to see this well known shopping area, and it was enjoyable - for a few hours. I'm not a shop-a-holic, but fthis wa fun to see, especially just before Christmas - many colorful decorations. It may not be fun for everyone, but a person could easily move on to other attractions in Singapore."
,,Shopping & shopping & shopping,5.0,,Tailor made for the shopaholic. The whole area is one inter-linked series of high class / quality shopping malls and your standard offerings. Everywhere there is food..every type of cuisine imaginable - and at some rather surprising prices - check the price in the menu before ordering - in some instances you may just mistake the placing of the decimal point. Very entertaining experience and in most cases - the ability to find what you were shopping for
,,Christmas is alive here!,5.0,,"White lights line the road as far as the eye can see. Lots of pop up shops with many different activities to keep you occupied for hours. Street buskers, people giving candy and merry making make this a must to visit for Christmas ."

,,"Shopping, Shopping and more shopping",5.0,,I love Orchard Road for shopping. It has everything you could possibly want and more. You have every major designer possible down to cheap buys in some of the plazas. There are many department stores located on Orchard Road and you can find many food halls that can satisfy any hunger. Shops don't open till 9.30/10am and close around 9/10pm. Shopping in the morning is a lot quieter and gets busier late afternoon/evening.

Easy to get too and from using the MRT

The downside it’s busy and crowded but I guess you can say that about a lot of Singapore, we use it for a stopover."

,,Shopping at its greatest!,5.0,,"Orchard Road, provides all the shopping opportunities you could ever imagine, including expensive up-market shopping from world wide brands, to the economy shopping, such as Lucky Markets. Though the traffic is busy in the street, the pedestrians are fenced off everywhere but the marked crossings, regulated mostly by traffic lights. There are trees and other greenery around, and plenty of places to stop for a meal or coffee."
,,Christmas on Orchard Road,5.0,,I don’t know of any other area that does Christmas Bling in the style that Orchard Road does. It really is wonderful to see. It brings in the tourist and the locals alike. Everyone is heading in all directions taking photographs. Of course the shopping is still there on a massive scale and there is something for everybody. Of course particularly well represented are the very high end brands that the road is famous for. It is a must visit area every trip to Singapore.
,,The best shopping strip (short of Milan) we have been to,5.0,,"It's a shopper's paradise. The thing that is the most appealing is the cleanliness of it.

One can visit most of the shops by being either underground or undercover, so the erratic Singapore rains don't really hamper the visit. Shopping centres are situated on both sides of the road, with trees providing the much needed visual relief from concrete and glass. Takashimaya has got to be my favourite (have been visiting it for over a decade), and that connects to Ngee Ann City, which connects to wisma atria and that connects to Ion which also has the Orchard Park MRT station. It's all superbly convenient!

The other side has Tangs (my wife's favourite shopping centre), which pretty much connects to Lucky Plaza (a sort of budget mall). From here one can get wet in the rain, but just barely, as Paragon is very close.

Ofcourse this is just the one section of Orchard road. It's longer than this, and has heaps more to provide, with plethora of shopping, eating options.

The fountain in front of Ngee Ann City is my favourite place to just sit and chill (okay chill is probably the wrong word given Singapore's heat and humidity) in the evenings.

To us, any visit to Singapore is not complete unless we have spent a day just enjoying what Orchard road has to offer.

If you are going to Singapore for the first time, would absolutely recommend staying at a hotel on Orchard."
,,Shop and take a walk,4.0,,"Dont forget to buy ice cream with a bread here, it is cheap and so yummy. For prayer you can go to Falah Mosque. For Shopping you can go to Ion Plaza or Lucky Plaza."
,,Favorite Place To Shop,5.0,,"If you like to shop in many mall or you need to know what Singapore's crowd really look like, Orchard Road is the right place. Here you can see many shops from many brands around the world. Along the road there are many shopping mall and people are busy crossing the road. You can hunt your favorite brand from low to high budget here, don't forget to prepare your energy to walk all day long to know this place."
,,Good to see,3.0,,Good to see Orchard Road but not really anywhere I'd spend any time at. Good Christmas lights but very busy and expensive!
,,A little goes a long way,2.0,,We normally walk 4-6 miles a day when visiting cities around the world. There are just far too many stores for most any human. The shops around Little India are by far more interesting and affordable. Walk a block or two on your way to another venue...night would be the best time.
,,Shops shops shops and money.! :D,5.0,,For those who got extra money and have no idea about spending them. :D visit the shopping complex here and you will get 100000 ways about spending money in both value and useless way. Haha kindding ! Visit here for your all needs. Only thing is it takes day to finishing shipping here !
,,Beautiful in every festive,5.0,,Walk and feel the color of Singapore... you can buy luxury brands from around the world here. X'mas and new year season is most beautiful time here. You won't get tired to see the things and people here.

,,Good stroll,4.0,,"Strolling along Orchard despite the heat is comfortably pleasant. We walked from end to end and were entertained by the December Christmas lights, the hodgepodge of people of different nationalities, food choices and shopping places. The only problem we encountered was crossing Scotts Road. To cross, you need to use the underpass. It’s difficult to navigate through the different paths underground with a stroller since these are not allowed in the escalators. You’d have to look for elevators and that adds to the confusion on where to go. It’s basically a 4-way cross Road with access to the MRT stations so it’s tricky to navigate."
,,Good for shopping.,5.0,,Must go to Orchard road if you visit Singapore. Very nice place for shopping you can find almost every brands here.
,,Shopping to suit everyone's tastes,5.0,,"Whilst we've been to Singapore before, it was really a quick stopover on our way back from India, so we really didn't see much. This trip we got a chance to really explore Orchard Road - and what a journey of exploration it was! Every food, every gadget, every brand, every taste - you can find it here. A truly amazing experience!"
,,No words to describe the Christmas celebration fee,5.0,,"As my headline goes, there is really no words to describe the Christmas feel. Its all lighted up with the shopping malls competing who has the best decoration. There is alot of mini shows to keep young children entertained. Its really a great time to visit Singapore"
,,Amazing !!,5.0,,We walked this road at night and we loved it. Its a very long walk but beautiful and we got great photos. There are alot of high end shops along the way. Worth a walk especially if you have kids. Great atmosphere
,,Not that big of a deal,3.0,,Orchard Road is that road that shows up everywhere when you search for things to do in Singapore. I just don't understand why. It's a road. Just like other roads. It has stores on both sides. Cars driving on the road. Not as fun as others roads in Singapore. Wouldn't go again.
,,Six Kilometres of Shopping,4.0,,All the big names are here if shopping for name brands is your thing. Well worth the walk as some bargains can be found.
,,Shopping with a Capital “S”,5.0,,"Best shopping in Asia. More shopping malls along Orchard Rd than anywhere else in Asia. All spotless, and air conditioned. Wonderful holiday displays."
,,interesting once,3.0,,if you are into high end fashion its probably great. I hate window shopping I like to shop so as I cant afford much here its not my cup of tea.
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,It's a shoppers delights. You get various malls along the road on either side. Which consist of branded good and other shops. There are few currencies exchange places which are good. It's bit crowded during the weekend and specially in December. You may have to walk from one end to the other. Taxi stands are also there with an MRT station located in two malls.
,,EAT AND DRINK ANYTHING YOU WANT AND SHOP TILL YOU DROP,5.0,,"Truly the ultimate shopping strip from all the high end shops to good value and market value shops which stretches for 2.2 kms.

Best time to visit is Nov to Dec as all the amazing the Christmas lights and decorations are up. Shop in the early evening when it is cooler and the street is lit up.

Be warned you will need approximately 7 days straight to meander all the mega malls and plazas most of which are interconnected and have access to the MRT (rail system) to Dhoby Ghaut, Orchard and Somerset.
Its Retail Therapy at its best, but you will never be cured of your shopping affliction as you cant possibly visit every destination on this strip.

All the malls have excellent food halls with a wide variety of cuisines as well as hundreds of cafes and restaurants."
,,Nice place for shopping,5.0,,"This is a must place to visit for shopping in Singapore. You could find all international and local brand as well. You may find from premium brand and local brand/shop. Restaurant and food are offered from different type of food from local taste such as chicken hainam rice , laksa and satay to steak pasta and pizza."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"Best shopping belt in SG. Must visit even if u r just window shopping. Enjoy the christmas lights post 7pm. Although the lights this year isn't as nice as the past few yrs. it's very white.

You can also always sit outside Takashimaya near the fountain and just people watch if your not interested in shopping. Lots of photo opportunities here as well. I think there is every brand shop on Orchard big and small. There are also lots of cheap souvenir shops at the smaller malls like lucky plaza, etc.

This time of the year most of the malls have their own Christmas tree as well :)"
,,Have to visit!,5.0,,"Whenever I am at Singapore, i will definitely go to Orchard Road. this is the place to go to for shopping and eating. You will be spoilt for choice!

if you go now, you will also get to see the Christmas decorations.

Most of the malls are connected too - so you don't have to worry about the rain or the heat."
,,Best at Dusk!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the commercial hub of Singapore and the equivalent to New York's 5th Avenue or Tokyo's Ginza.

Malls and malls of designer shops, regular shops and places to eat!

If you are not used to the tropical heat and sun, I recommend walking Orchard at dusk: 6pm to 10pm."
,,X'mas lighting at Orchard Road,4.0,,This year X'mas light-up along Orchard Road is one of the best gift for local and visitors. The whole street is light-up at night and that of the shopping buildings. A must see for the overseas visitors when visiting in the month of Dec 2017.

,,Great shopping area,5.0,,"Stayed along the Orchard Road area, so lots of time was spent window shopping. Plenty of shopping malls , some average and some very high end displaying all the things from all over the world. Most of the shopping malls have a brilliant Food Court with all kinds of Food.

,,Really nice road if you want to shopping,4.0,,"We went there just to visit and basically its nice specially during xmas time due to the decoration and a bunch of people everywhere. All the road is plenty of stores, bars, and you can do whatever you want. Nice to give a try."
,,Luxury goods,5.0,,"This time we wandered along this road to admire the Christmas decorations.

,,If you like shopping.,4.0,,So many shops and so many choices! Not the place to be in a hurry and no way you could visit all the shopping centres etc in a day! Give yourself lots of time - and money!
,,Too many stores,4.0,,Too many stores. There is such a thing as too many shops. Then it is on Orchard Road. There are so many places tucked away on various levels. There are some great specialty and unique shops for all categories. Never made it to the electronic area.
,,Mall after mall,4.0,,We were here at end of November & all the Christmas lights were up throughout the street. One night we walked the length of the road from ION mall to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. The lights were spectacular. You could walk through mall after mall. many are full of very expensive shops.
,,Not my world!,2.0,,"Nothing but overpriced shops. Place where people show off what they got. In my eyes only worth a quick walk-through. Hard to imagine that some time ago there were nutmeg, pepper and fruit orchards along this road."
,,Worth the walk,5.0,,"You need to take time and walk the length of the Road. Try Sunday when the workers are off and meeting up. The smell, noise, the atmosphere ... really good day"

,,Amazing at Christmas time,5.0,,"I was lucky enough to visit Orchard Road in November. Every shopping centre was done up for Christmas. The outside of each shopping centre was decorated with Christmas lights and many had interactive Christmas displays like you have never seen before.

Totally recommend Orchard Road in November for everyone. Regardless what age you are it is magical!!"

,,Very busy shopping area!,4.0,,"Orchard Road was what you would imagine of a large shopping area. Lots of people, lots of malls, and boutique type stores. Happy to have checked it off the list of sites to see but it was more a walk through visit as that's not my particular scene."

It is a lovely place to be for shopping and some late evening walk .. we tried a street side ice cream sandwich and it was amazing .. Dont miss .. if possible stay somewhere around
,,Designer shops,3.0,,I am not sure why so much is made of this. Basically it is a street with loads of expensive shops. There is artwork along the road and it is very clean.

,,Singapore's Premier Shopping Street,5.0,,"This is a weekend haunt for us, partly because it has all the international brands within a 1-km radius and is well connected with underpasses. Food choices are plentiful here and in fact, most will be spoilt for choice. This runs the gamut of local favourites in foodcourts to specialty restaurants featuring mid to high price range cuisines."
,,Shoppers' paradise,5.0,,"Upper Orchard Road must have more high-end shopping complexes than almost anywhere on the planet. Even if you're not in the market for anything in particular you'll probably love the glitzy buildings and the glitzy shop windows. There's lots of eating places as well. And at the moment just walking down the street is worth doing to check out all the Christmas decorations. A really exciting, modern area to spend time in."
,,2017 Light Up!,4.0,,The annual Christmas Light Up along Orchard Road is a must see! 2017 theme is “Christmas on a Great Street”. Beautiful decors lit by LED lights daily from 3pm till late night from November till 1 January 2018.

A must see and must walk through memorable experience!
,,Great for a shopping blow out,4.0,,"This road is great for shopping, although there are many high end shops that were above our budget. On the low level of the malls are many eateries and food courts that provide a wide variety of flavours and prices. The area was clean and felt safe. At one end of the street was a market type mall where you could buy your typical Asian souveniers and street food."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"This street is a main shopping street in Singapore. It is the Beverly Hills of Singapore. Lots of retail outlets and full of decorations with colourful lightings. It is a great place to be in especially during Christmas. However, things here can be quite expensive.....shop at your own peril:) Nevertheless, this is definitely one of the best place to be in during Christmas.....soak up the atmosphere and have fun."
,,Evening walk,3.0,,My wife and I walked along Orchard Rd at night to see the christmas lights. It is worth the effort to visit the shopping malls to see the christmas decorations but it can get crowded. I'm not a shopper but I did enjoy the atmosphere.
,,Amazing to see the shop displays,5.0,,Amazing Christmas displays but the shops and food were double the cost of the other areas with the same brands. Limited elevator access. But well worth a look for the displays at Christmas.
,,Best place for shopping,4.0,,"Orchard road is for sure a great place for shopping. During Christmas season, the decoration is always special. The underground connection of many malls makes it easy to get lost"
,,Christmas lights,5.0,,A must see. We were on the last ride on our on off bus that took us down orchard road. The 6km of Christmas lights spectacular. Great way to see them on the bus.
,,Shopping street,3.0,,"Another big busy shopping street, nice to walk around like all the others as good atmosphere but wouldn't go out of your way for it."
,,Orchard road,4.0,,"I visited Singapore in september 2017 and covered orchard road .This is an excellent shopping place consisting of around 15 shopping malls and no. of supermarkets and food courts in each mall plus restaurants.Even if You are not interested in shopping you should visit for window shopping because malls are very attractive and also food of different countries are available. All hi fi brands of Europe and usa are found here.Some of the prominent malls are Ion orchard ,Paragon ,Takshmania for high end stuff and very beautiful even only to move around.Lucky plaza for mid range items.Spare 2-3 hours to see around."

,,Christmas lights,5.0,,"Well we certainly weren't expecting this.
We were told that to get cheaper meals we should go to Orchard Road and the quality would also be better.
My God it was designer shops and local shops on a scale that puts the Trafford Centre to shame. The Christmas lights were also on a par with Oxford Street. The crowds even at 10pm were amazing but everyone was happy. There were literally hundreds of reasonably priced restaurants. You cannot go to Singapore and not go here."
,,A popular market,5.0,,"Orchard road is a very amazing market for shoppers , ion orchard mall is located here which was just amazing and an exciting place too"
,,Crowded and clean shopping walk,4.0,,As always orchard road is crowded with tourist. Its a must go place if you go to Singapore. I never skipped going here everytime i go there. Theres a lot of food and shopping center.

With malls like Takahimaya, Paragon, Ion Orchard, Wisma Atria as well as 313 Somerset, tourists will be spoilt for choice!!"
,,Shopping capital,4.0,,This is the shopping street in Singapore and as soon as you get off the MRT you will be catapulted in a road made of just shops. Shops every everywhere.

,,Perfect for shoppers but not for me,4.0,,Since I was in Singapore for the first time I wanted to make sure I at least visited the Golden shopping district one. It’s different in that you have elite stores like Chanel and Tiffany mixed in with local shops. Nothing interested for the person who doesn’t like to shop but I did enjoy the Takashimaya department store especially the food floor! Wherever you are it’s easy to take the metro or bus or can there. If you love shopping this is the place for you.
,,So busy!,3.0,,"Avoid going here on weekends, you can hardly move at all! There is a good mix of cheap and luxury brands to cater for all shopping needs."
,,Just another shopping street,2.0,,This is just another shopping street with a mix of malls and high end stores. Lucky Plaza has smaller stores where prices are negotiable at some stores.
,,Rolex Shopping,5.0,,"I visited a reputable second hand watch dealer in Far East Plaza. Some really nice Rolex watches on offer, but the GBP to SGD rate of exchange was a killer. I love the high end designer shops in ION Orchard, loads to look at and plenty of places to take a breather. Bring along a full wallet and some sturdy walking shoes!!"
,,Weekend shopping and dining,4.0,,"Orchard road is a shopping ctr for tourist and also Singaporean. Easily accessible by MRT or bus. The shopping belt stretches from junction of Kay Siang road All the way to Suntec City in Marina Square to Marina Bay Sands. You can enjoy shopping, sight seeing and arts. Go for it."
,,"Long road, no Orchards",5.0,,"But plenty of shops. Shopping is the national past time of the local Singaporean. Orchard Road is 2.3kms of malls from Chanel, Prada, Apple to much smaller shops. Heaven for some and potential hell for others"
,,Not up to its usual festive splendour I am afraid!,3.0,,"Of course,Orchard Road remains one of the top consumer shopping destinations in the world, it is 'up there' with Oxford Street in London and 5th Avenue in New York. In this regard, nothing has changed, it is still in the premiere league of consumerism, it remains clean, safe, well organised, safe, secure and often competitively priced if you know where to look.

However, this year I am a little disappointed with the festive street lighting which is in a stark white theme this year. For me, it lacks a little of the spectacular display observed in previous years. But we know that Singapore responds and adapts with great agility, so next year I am certain it will surpass itself again."
,,Long shopping road with all the fancy brands...,4.0,,"Just a long wide road where ceossing isn’t easy having all the fancy malls and brands you can find anywhere else.

If it rains you better be prepared and geared up with an umbrella.

In evenings and at night time it becomes the racing track for hiso kids in their German and Italian sport cars pulluting the sceenery with noise..."

,,Good for gifts,4.0,,Economical and everything for presents / gifts are there to purchase for friends and family. Delicious chocolates and sale scheming street.
,,Good shopping place,4.0,,If your purpose to visit Singapore is for shopping then you shouldn't miss orchard road. Orchard is a very long street high-end shopping place. There's a few cafe's and restaurants too. But it would be too crowded to walk esp at night but if you have no problem with that then it's a must go place to see in singapore.
,,Tourists area,4.0,,Orchard place is where all tourists need to visit if you are thinking branded items which is too costly at your own country.
,,A must visit to get a taste of Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard road is a must visit in Singapore - for both tourists and locals alike. This place glitters in all its glory, but at the same time, the contrasts here are fascinating - on one side you will see the biggest luxury brands such as LV, Hermes, Prada in huge malls, while in another corner you will find modest shop-houses, housing cute little bars.

Easily accessible by public transport from Somerset or Orchard MRT (red line).

If you are keen to shop (call this my 'orchard shopping trail'), I recommend getting off at Somerset and walking towards Orchard mrt - begin by checking out 313@somerset (brands like Forever 21, Cotton On, Zara, Mango, Victoria Secret are all here). This place has some really great eateries too - consider having lunch here first (the thai place is great, so is al marćhe) and then starting your (window or not) shopping.

Once done here, head over to the H&M building next to 313, which is their flagship store spread across 3-4 floors and has a good collection and sale items most of the time. Go to the 2nd floor and check out the sale section - I have found some great stuff there.

PS: notice the birds chirping around this area, it is so loud and lovely, you can't miss it.

Once done at H&M, join the large number of pedestrians right outside the store, waiting to cross Grange road to go over to Takishimaya. Here onwards, it is a really pleasant stroll, you will often see street artists and musicians performing here, and people sitting on parapets watching.

Most of the luxury brands are located in this part of orchard road, so may be worth paying a visit if you are interested.

There are some great photo ops too for first timers who want to take some pictures, or regulars looking to keep their instragram followers updated. =)

You will know the trail has ended once you reach the colourfully lit stairs and the glass dome which is the entry-way to Orchard mrt.

I used to typically head home after this, but there's a new bar area opposite somerset (near centrepoint mall) that I have started to like very much. So I now end my shopping trip after H&M, and head there instead - for some drinks followed by a massage at Natureland. I will review these places separately another day!

Remember, Orchard road is not a tourist attraction, but a way of life. Try and spend an afternoon here and be one of the locals. :)"
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,This area is a fashionista paradise! All the luxury brands in one long strip. Enjoy because I certainly did.
,,X'mas decoration 2017 is bland,3.0,,"monochrome white, unusually boring lacking imagination in the design. At the eastern end of Orchard Rd the atmosphere can be more vibrant if there is more colourful lighting. Of course, one would not use red/yellow/green to confuse drivers."
,,Shop till you Drop,4.0,,"Orchard Road was a stones throw from my hotel so of course I had to take a walk.
It was looking great as all the Christmas lights were up, which looked very pretty through the day and stunning at night when they were lit up.

,,Nice Area for Shopping or Sightseeing,4.0,,"Nice central part of the City. Would appeal to all, including businesses traveller, vacationers, sightseers or shoppers.

,,One of the world's Top 5 shopping strip!,5.0,,"This is Singapore's ""Ginza District"" or ""Oxford Street"". The concentration of shopping malls along this wide boulevard is truly astounding....... perhaps nowhere else in the world can match this! The pedestrian walkway and network of underground connection around the Orchard MRT station is a joy to walk and navigate. You can literally find anything you want somewhere along the Orchard strip. Come here during the Christmas season and you will be enthralled by the bedazzling Christmas lights and decorations."
,,Ice cream sandwiches,5.0,,"If you happen to be strolling along Orchard Road, don't forget to look for anyone selling ice cream on the footpath. The ice cream is fantastic. I chose mango ice cream sandwiched by rainbow bread! It was so so yummy."
,,Maybe I just got it a bit wrong,3.0,,"There's nothing wrong with the Orchard Rd shopping area. All of the big brands are there etc.

Just didn't seem to have much atmosphere or uniqueness. That said, I visited it in the middle of the day and possibly it has more vibrance at other times.

There's a lot more to see and experience in Singapore."
,,Nice walk,5.0,,"It’s a nice walk. But be sure to carry an umbrella, depending on when in the year one visits. Singapore has a tropical climate, after all."

The first time I did it in the morning and then I've returned next day in the evening to see the same sights with neon lights instead of daylight.
I enjoyed each and every moment of my time although I had no intention of buying anything."

,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"Orchard Rd offers shopping and eating in numerous ways - hugely expensive to affordable. Easy to commute, clean, easy to get disorientated as there are so many levels to most stores! Down into basement levels and many stories up. A great way to spend days!"
,,Shopping & Bonding with Family,3.0,,"1. Orchard Road use to be shopping paradise in 90’s & early 2000’s.. Use to do window shopping or spending time with my dad.
2. I make a point to do the same with my children from time to time.
3. Jun always the best time to do shopping at Orchard Road area, The Great Singapore Sale. It not as what it is in the 90’s, still you have bargains here & there.
4. A lot of shopping complex, but I can see a lot of empty stall at the mall, like Ngee ANN City, Paragon, Far East Plaza, Plaza Singapura & much more. I can see a lot of anchors tenant left the area.
5. If you just want to spend time bonding with family & Friend, having nice meals & window shopping, Orchards Road will be ideal."

You will actually get lost in these giant malls but trust me the kind of stuff they have is marvelous. Make sure you have your pocket filled with too many SGD before you hit the market.

,,$$$$$,3.0,,"If you want to spend lots of money, go to Orchard Road! Too many repeat stores but fun to just go and see."
,,Not for the average shopper ...,2.0,,"Unless you are in the market for top end high fashion, Orchard Road only bears a brief visit. As someone else said, how much Prada, Hermes, Gucci, Tiffany, TAG, etc. can you window shop? Even most of the Malls are populated by big expensive brands, although there are one or two that offer more reasonably prices items, for us more averagely financed people. Only one or two places I would bother visiting again in this area."

Shopping heaven ifthat your thing."

,,Cannot Miss this!,4.0,,"It’s all there, high end shopping , coffee ☕️ and snack shops and also cinema. The lighting in the evening makes it a treat to look at. Be it Giorgio Armani, Marks & Spencer’s, Zara you name it and it’s there.
You can easily spend a full day here.
High on recommendation list!!"
,,"Fashion, food and festivities",4.0,,"As many of the other reviews have emphasized, if you're looking to shop -- then this is the spot! There are many high end brands, but there's also plenty to browse for those of us But beyond that, we did enjoy a lovely cafe (Tiong Bahru Bakery @ TANGS Orchard) in this area and tried a happy hour at one of the bars (Tanuki Raw) in one of the malls. Plenty to see just walking around and they're already getting their Christmas lights ready all along the street, which I'm sure will be quite the sight."

,,east meets rodeo drive,3.0,,The shopping along this stretch is easy to walk from start to finish. With many high end stores and money exchanges(not good rates) in case you run low on funds. Restaurants abound both in the malls and free standing stores near either end of the road. Not a great place to shop unless money is no object and definitely not a souvenir spot. The Arab neighborhood was extremely friendly with great bargains and excellent money exchanges.
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,Lots of malls and shops on the street. Easy walk to find lots of variety for shoppers. Good restaurants and hotels in the area.
,,for shopping but easily lost,3.0,,"It is shopping area. A lot of shopping malls. However it is easily lost since the roads are complex, the MRT exit inside the shops and hard to find the exit of the malls. Since it is for shopping, there is nothing special for travelers, in my opinion."

,,Avoid - tourist trap,3.0,,"Over crowded, over priced and full of toursits - they are so many better places to go to get the 'real' feel of Singapore. Most of the shopping is International generic brands but with little charm. At night time is takes on a grubby feel and should be avoided."

The ION sky observatory is one of the must do things when here,it gives panoromic views of the surroundings.
Loads of pubs, cafes and foodcourts scattered everywhere to have a great time!"
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"Orchard Road is such a fun place to shop. When it comes to clothes, shoes, jewellery, and handbags, it has everything from high street to couture. It has a few established local department stores too; Tangs being my favourite. Many of the malls have the same brands. The last mall down the road is Plaza Singapura which has an interesting blend of high street and regional brands, fashion, food, movie theatre, music store, beauty services and a large grocery store in the basement."

,,Wander through Singapore,4.0,,"No trip to Singapore may be considered complete until a visit has been made to Orchard Road. This area is jam packed with Shopping Malls, many exclusive to designer outlets. You could be in any city anywhere in the world here, as the buildings could contain Macy’s, Tiffany’s, or Harrods. The distinction here is that the place is spotless. Would have awarded it five stars, but as they had all of their Christmas decorations (including a giant decorated Christmas tree, and huge baubles suspended across the streets - and more) already up, I knocked a mark off for being crass. Recommended"

It cost us a fiver in a cab back to our hotel on the bay but this made it easier to lug our bags back at the end of the day. Great food courts also with great tasty food. We ventured here for two days and I think we still didn't get through it all! Worth doing!"

All the stores are super high end. a few lesser stores like Abercrombie and Fitch but the rest are Chanel, Louis Vuitton and things like that.

,,Nice place to walk around and shop !,4.0,,"Most of the shops are here, seeing it is one of the business districts. But the get here faster and easier is by the MRT. There are lots of places that you can go here for; planner addicts, clothes, shoes and other stuffs ! There are some places that might be expensive but there are also those that are cheap. Be aware of the busiest times as there will be more crowds and it will be hard to walk around"
,,Disappointed,5.0,,I visited Orchard Road 20 - 25 years ago and i loved this street. Now the street is full of name brand exclusive shops which are way too pricey for me. Lucky Plaza is still there but it is not the shopping plaza i loved to shop years ago. We only walked along 1 side of Orchard Road and looked thtough the shops windows.I would not hurry back to Orchard Road on my next trip to Singapore
,,High end shopping,3.0,,Back in Singapore after 15 year absence and disappointed with the changes on Orchard Road. Gone is the hustle and bustle of locals and tourists alike and the street side cafes to be replaced by malls full og high end stores with very few customers
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,A street with many great shopping. A designers heaven. During Christmas this place comes alive and is decorated so beautiful. Definitely worth a visit.
,,The Sensational Shopping Road,4.0,,"Shops after shops, mall after mall, this is The Orchard Road in Singapore! It is a road filled with vast variety of shopping destinations. Looking for a bargain, go to OG; opt for luxury, there is Ngee Aun City for you. Shopping here is definitely qualified the phase - Shop Till You Drop!"
,,"Dazzling Lights,Malls & Lively Music",4.0,,"We took a bus from Anchorpoint bus stop to China Town first and after some shopping and visit to Mariamman temple we took a taxi to Orchard Road. We took underway to cross the road and reached at Tang Plaza. In front of us was Lucky Plaza. The whole road was shining with flashy lights, an artist was playing music on guitar to collect money for his Album Fund.Many malls were there with different brands. The decoartion for Christmas has started and the road was full of crowd being a saturday.Now were thinking to have our dinner there itself so we reached a kiosk where Falafal Wraps were available so we placed the order and sat on laid high canny chairs and table outside. Those wraps were tasty and filling. We booked a taxi on Grab to pick us up from Mandarin Hotel pick up point. After 10 minutes taxi reached and we returned back to our destination after a lively visit to Orchard Road."
,,Go and visit once.,3.0,,"It is worth a visit just to see the variety of shops whatcha are on a massive scale. But to buy? Well not really better off in the U.K. however walk up Emerald Street or Road next to the Information office and see the Old Singapore, but in excellent condition."
,,Excellent Shopping District and Centres,4.0,,"One of the many excellent shopping centres in Singapore. Orchard Road is a long road with lots of various shops catering to all manner of different tastes and budgets. Definitely worth a visit down the Orchard Road, although there are probably more impressive shopping centres in Singapore. The Shoppes in the Marina Bay was also excellent."
,,Best shopping destination in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is an upscale shopping street housing the best and biggest brands of Singapore. The shops/malls are little expensive but if you are willing to shell out a few extra dollars there's nothing like this place to shop. The roads are nicely decorated and in the afternnons a lot of people can be seen gently strolling across Orchard Rd and window shopping. Notable malls are ION Orchard, Orchard Central and Ngee Ann City. Ngee Ann City houses Asia's biggest bookstore - Kinokuniya."
,,Good shopping destination though expensive,4.0,,"Orchard road is a great street to shop on but if you are ready to fork out a few extra dollars for the expesive stuff here. Though if you look around in orchard point and adjoining malls or in the wheelock and ion irchard underground shopping area, you will definitely find a good deal.
Lack of food options for Indians (Indian food) is a big turnoff. No or low veg options."
,,One of the Best Shopping Street,5.0,,"Orchard Road remains one of the best shopping street in the world; better even than Oxford Street or Bond Street in London or 5th Avenue in New York to me. Why I say it’s better than the shopping streets in London and New York is because Orchard Road is one shopping street which caters for all your shopping needs from your luxury designer items to your moderately priced fashion items. You can also shop for electronic goods, jewelry etc. There are also numerous departmental stores from Isetan, Takashimaya, Robinson’s and Metro Jaya situated here. Then there are the restaurants; from fine dining to fast food. The other shopping streets in the world do not offer such variety. Orchard Road is the best!"
,,Nice street with many shops,3.0,,"Nice central street with many shops to spend money in but no big deal, and the prices are also pretty high."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Try the ice cram bun. It’s not that far from Orchard mrt. You can take a lot of pictures here. There’s apple store here
,,Just walking around,5.0,,I was just walking around and discovered the many shops along this road! It was a wonderful experience. Just be prepared to walk with or through a lot of people.
,,Totally Disappointing,1.0,,"If I wanted to see all the high end stores, I could have stayed at home. I was hoping it would be like Temple Street in Hong Kong. Totally disappointed. Nothing I could not have bought at home, not what I visited for."
,,A branded walk,5.0,,Orchard Road came as a surprisingly welcoming experience with its posh malls with world class brands left open for us to explore.
,,Extraordinarily over the top.,5.0,,"My husband and I decided to walk the full length of Orchard Road today, what an experience, if anybody ever tells you that it’s cheap, that rubbish. All the high class names are here, and just not one store of each some have two. The staff are in the stores on their phones waiting for the rich and famous or infamous to buy. Been there done that, now I can say I have been. 5/10. The walk was good. If u need to catch a bus from the Marina Bay Area the #36 is the one to catch, stop at the first stop when walk to the end. Enjoy"
,,Changes have made Orchard Rd less interesting,3.0,,"I guess I must have visited Singapore 20 or 30 times over the years, and seen it change from a bargain marketplace to an upmarket sophisticated contemporary shopping mecca. However, although Singapore is probably giving locals (who are very westernized) and tourists what they want, the changes, in my opinion, are making places like Orchard Road less interesting. There are so many up-market sterile type shops in Orchard Road, making it rather boring unless you have pots of money to spend. There are still are few complexes like the ""Lucky Plaza"" that add character, although you wouldn't want the whole street to be like this. And, you can still catch the metro (subway) to China Town to visit similar older style shopping malls.

Whilst I still love Singapore, it is losing some of its appeal. It is just a case of trying to provide a balance of the old with the new. The new is good, but lacks character and charm."
,,Best place to hang out at night,5.0,,"The most wonderful thing about this place for me was the sound of the birds at night , when you are walking they have a symphony. it's a good place for shopping lovers, specially those who are interested in luxury goods."
,,The happening place in Singapore for shopping,5.0,,"If you want anything under the sun, Orchard road is your destination. From high end to inexpensive stuff you can get electronics, fashion, and food galore. Walking underground will keep you cool and dry (sometimes it rains frequently in Singapore)"
,,An experience just to walk down the road!,5.0,,"Very clean area and near some very expensive shops. People are very friendly. You need to use the underpass to cross over, or walk to traffic lights to do so. A very long road! Great eateries in the area. Lovely people selling ice cream along the way. Good for a stroll to experience daily life. Enjoy!"
,,Shops galore,4.0,,"Prepare to get lost at some of the ''Malls', most prices are same as Australia if not more, but there are bargains to be had."
,,Woooooow empty da banks here,5.0,,Orchard is the city of Singapore and if you live here u know everything in Singapore is OVERPRICED but you do get a nice experience but careful put a limit on what you buy I warn u 😼
,,Shopping mania,4.0,,"best place for some shopping. was raining, but you can pass from one mall to the other...one day is not enough!"

,,Good place for the shopping,4.0,,"Good district to make some shopping...planty of malls whit any kind of shops, restaurant and public gardens."
,,The Shopping area which is hard to beat!,5.0,,"Orchard Road stretches for ever! Designer Malls line both sides of the road, with the most amazing displays in their windows. There are also lots of shopping centres with a variety ""small"" shops - selling everything - and food courts. Certainly worth a stroll down Orchard Road."
,,Explore,3.0,,We caught the train from china town to Orchard rd and explored the Ion building and the street - has mixture high end - Gucci to H&M and all in between - something for everyone but be prepared to walk - a lot!!!!!
,,Expensive Shops to Look At,3.0,,"It is supposed to be one of the ""must do"" things for Singapore. if you have a lot of disposable $$ and enjoy brands then this is the place for you. If you fall into the other 97% of the population, it is just window shopping. That can be fun, however for husbands boyfriends or partners who only look if they are going to buy, then maybe this is not for you."
,,For shopaholics,3.0,,"Primarily for those who love high end shopping, just about every brand you could possibly imagine, so much colour and vibrancy.
Almost too superficial and lacking the authenticity of many years ago.
Perhaps a must to visit just to say you have seen one of the major tourist attractions."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"This road has a different energy which is unparalleled. The store options vary from iconic brands to value brands. Good hunting ground for deal seekers. The feel of the place is lively, vibrant, happy, festive, contagious across the day/s as felt by us. On the street, must try ice cream in bread (it is different. Not great, but different). With almost all the Global brands vying for your attention and mind space, varieties are bind blowing. Have fun time"
,,singapore is near nature,5.0,,i love to hear the birds chirping over the green trees around orchard thats the best part of singapore despite the progress nature is maintained well
,,A must walk if you are in Singapore,4.0,,Orchard road is such a vibrant street with a lots of shops. A good place to do lots of shopping if you have a big wallet! Make sure you check Apple store!
,,Busy shopping street,4.0,,"This main thoroughfare is a busy shopping area. There are plazas and arcades with chain stores, cafes, restaurants, tailors, money changers and gift shops as well as department stores like Tangs. There's a lot of hustle and bustle all round."
,,Completely disappointed...,1.0,,"As we arrived in this street, we were completely disappointed. A lot of international expensive brand shops in a big long street; even the restaurants are not local. As a tourist I am not interested soo much in shopping, as I can shop in my city too. I would suggest you delete it from
your sights list,"
,,Not for the poor or faint-hearted,4.0,,"I walked up and down Orchard Road in the 1960`s - boy has it changed now! You need a deep pocket and a lot of strength in your legs (which was 74 year olds we did not really have). Crossing the road was difficult - there are underpasses and once down inside it is hard to know which is the right way up. Mind you, you will find a Starbucks and a MacDonalds even here. Take it easy when walking because it is hard work"
,,High end shopping malls on Orchard road,4.0,,"Lot of high end shopping malls on Orchard road. In the evening noticed interesting feature on the trees, lot of birds chirping. But very busy road, looked very clean and beautiful."
,,"Busy, busy, busy!",3.0,,"You would not believe that it was possible to have so many shopping precincts in one area!

Come out of one, there's another next door! There's another over the road as well.

All very beautiful and helpful but expensive and so many of the same shops that are in British High Streets.

Also, surprisingly empty as some local friends tell us that the shops are suffering as so many locals shop on line."
,,"A must , especially for shoppers",4.0,,"Orchard is a must for all to see and spend a few hours , especially those who like to shop will find this area very exciting You find ALL the Brand’s of the world , most likely one of the highest concentration you have ever seen"
,,Use a map!,5.0,,"The underground is so very counterintuitive - at the last minute (once lost) we realized there are some of the same places at both ends, so you cannot orient by a given store!! Exquisitely clean, tidy and the people well mannered. But underground is so easy to be lost in!!! You cannot go from one corner across the road, but must go underground, around and around to get to the other side. And stores are ""repeated"" underground as well.

Though after awhile you get the hang of it - people are helpful with redirection.

We loved the markets and shopes on Arab Street! (via t he metro)"
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,This road is full of shopping malls covering all tastes and budgets. It's quite overwhelming the share volume of places to shop but it's a one stop shop for those in need of retail therapy. Think mainstream shops not cheap market knockoffs
,,shops after shops after shops!,5.0,,shopping is all around you there with many dept stores as well as other smaller shops to spend money in
,,Love shopping,4.0,,Shopping freek...wide range for my shopping sense.. picked up cool stuff..excellent pace for shopping and eating
,,Perfect Place to unwind & shop,5.0,,"Orchard Road has always been 1 of my top list place to go in Singapore. You can perfectly find anything you want from designer labels to little souvenir for tourist as well as local to bring along with when travelling overseas.

Besides dining, shopping and walking, mosque is easily accessible in the heart of Orchard Road which locates besides Paragon Shopping Mall."
,,A definite go there,5.0,,This was our fourth trip to Singapore but the first time we really didn't much time on Orchard Rd. This really is a vibrant area with a lot more to do than it looks. Allow a good full day including night to experience it.
,,Love the shopping on Orchard Road,5.0,,I visited Orchard Road 30 years ago while in the US Navy...One of my favorite places to visit was Orchard Road...The shopping was and still is amazing...Anyone visiting Singapore must visit this area to experience it first hand.
,,Shopping! Shopping!,4.0,,"You'll enjoy this place if you have shopping on your mind. There are multiple malls and you'll get lost if you don't know where to go and what you want to buy. There are more than 6 Omega boutique outlets :)

I enjoyed my coffee at Starbucks and looking at people passby."
,,Shopping,3.0,,If you love high end shopping this is the place to go. Although for us seen one seen them all. Not our thing.
,,Interesting City,5.0,,"Had a leisure walk along the side walk through the street and everything is so clean and pretty. With high end shopping malls left right and center, it is definitely an eye candy for us all. The best gem was when we found a halal pizza booth right in front of Lucky Plaza! Great for Muslims to have a quick bite. Also, Lucky Plaza is a must visit as all items are at great bargain on cloths and souvenirs. We were definitely lucky then!"
,,Most popular street in Singapore.,5.0,,"I imported Orchids out of Singapore for many years and visited regularly and stayed on this road,so know it well. The Orchard Hotel is my favourite. So many good shops ."
,,Famous shopping district,5.0,,"A shopping district in singapore, you can find nearly everything here ranger from cheap prices and moving to upscale shopping There also a lot of reasonably priced food court within the area Good place for shopaholic and family."
,,Shops and more shops,5.0,,"There is shopping centre after shopping centre, you just need to choose which one to go into, most of them are very expensive. But worth a look, I think the Japanese have more fun shopping here, not the Australian."
,,Relaxing time and shopping in Singapore!,5.0,,"One of the best shopping area in Singapore! Everything in one area... good food, good coffee, great bars! Nice place to wallk around since the area has a big setback! Best hotel to stay when in Orchard Road is Mandarin Orchard"
,,Best Shopping place in Singapore maybe the world,5.0,,This is the best shopping place you could go to every high end and middle end and low end shop you could want a must for women and men also highly recommended
,,Totaly over rated,3.0,,Sorry to say this will waste half if not a full day Singapore has heaps and heaps of shopping malls Orchard road is very top end and you will have to have a bucket full of cash no.... make that two buckets full of cash. We saw one shop where a guy with white gloves on opening the door of the shop to one or two shoppers at a time. If time is short on your stay in Singapore give this place a miss or get on the MRT go to Orchard road station just to say you have been there
,,girls trip 2017,4.0,,Every designer imaginable is on this strip - shopping centre after store after shopping centre. although no real bargains be prepared to get your wallet out!
,,"It's become a 'must', but there isn't a whole lot to do",3.0,,"We went there in the dark and it's a nice brightly lit walk, but it literally is just a shopping street. It's either boutique expensive brand shops or massive multi-storey department stores. Most have food courts in the bottom floor and most affordable shops are also below ground whereas it gets more expensive the higher you get. You won't miss out on much if you don't make it to Orchard Road, but if you do have the time to stroll through it, go go for it because it's still kind of amazing how many shops there are! Compared to Oxford St and Dubai Mall - Dubai has tried to portray a sample of every store ever, so they're quite small, whereas London has a bit less, but most stores are massive flagships. Orchard Rd is a bit of a mix - bigger stores than Dubai, but unless expensive brands, most of them were unknown to me."
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"If you walk underground from orchard rd station, u won’t even realized that there are actually many malls connected to each other. You will totally spoiled here. Just bring your money 😂"
,,Excellent shopping area,5.0,,Orchard Rd is central and easily reached by MRT. Many high end stores along wide tree-lined boulevard. Some very good department stores. A very worthwhile location to saunter for half a day.
,,Standard shopping strip,3.0,,"Bit disappointed with Orchard road. I was expecting quaint little shops, but seemed to be mostly 5 storey plus shopping centres selling high end goods."
,,"SHOP till you drop, but nothin else",4.0,,"Really this road is just about spending tons of money (prices seemed to be way over what you'd spend at home - even as a NYer), but actually if you go to the food courts there are delicious ways to end your days. Otherwise be amazed by the number of levels one street can fit shops on. If you have little time: ION is where we'd go. 4B is less expensive, but getting more classy the further up you go."
,,Is it worth it for young kids?,3.0,,"I couldn't find a review on this topic so thought I would post it myself.

Most of the malls on orchard road are stroller friendly (and we had a double stroller) and have nursing rooms but the lifts seem to take forever. There's not much for young kids and the shopping is average if you come from Australia, the US or Europe.

We walked from Orchard Road to Marina Bay in the evening and that was a lovely walk. Would recommend that rather than visiting any of the malls."
,,Long walk with many distractions,4.0,,Our hotel was on Scott’s road so we walked all the way to Raffles to take in downtown Singapore on our first day Plenty to see and enjoy along the way

,,"Lots of shopping, but there are even better venues for that!",4.0,,"Naturally you do want to visit Orchard Road with its endless shopping facilities. However, we found there are much more convenient shopping malls, like the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall where the airconditioning helps to feel more comfortable and things are located closer at hand."
,,"Shopping, Shopping and Shopping",4.0,,"You cannot leave Singapore without spending half day (and a lot of money) shopping. It is quite an experience since you will find everything, not everything is high end as other reviews say, you will find easily options according to your budget."
,,so many shopping malls,4.0,,It was a nice area if you want to find everything at once for all the shopping you need to do for just 1 trip.
,,First option for shopping,4.0,,"The prices are not very cheap, but there is the best place for people the are looking for good brands stores."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Great place for shopping! Very safe clean environment. Lots of different worldwide brands as much as local brands too!
,,Delicious Way to Enjoying Orchard Road Singapor,5.0,,"Uncle Ice Cream is Ice Cream Cut, one of the many popular snack in Singapore. If you are walking at famous place, Orchard Roaf, don't missed it. The Location is in front of ION and Isetan mall. Uncle Ice Cream is served like a sandwich, eaten with plain bread or wafers with Ice Cream Cut as the stuffing.

Uncle Ice Cream sold any kind of flavor like Chocolate, Choco Chip, Vanilla, Mint, Strawberry, Read Bean, Durian, Blueberry, Mango, Sweet Corn, Taro and many other flavor variants. We try mint flavour and it was sooo yummy..

The price is also very cheap SGD 1.2. Very very worth to try.. Enjoy guys .."

,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"If you like shopping you will love Orchard Road, they say Dubai is the shopping capital of the world, think again. Orchard Road has every design store you would wish for and plenty of dining outlets to visit. Shopping Mall underground on three levels."
,,1 redeeming feature..,5.0,,"Unless you have lots of money,time and No children then go . Only if you have time and on a budget with no kids... then go to Lucky plaza next to Tangs.... Don't buy your gifts for friends and family from the stores at the entrance but wonder through the 6 levels of indoor stalls and pick up stuff 50/100 % cheaper than the stalls on the street from level ."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Good area but expensive. If you want buy souvenir something, you can found much more there. But prices are highest. Just walking there good idea I think. Actually Singapore is very expensive country. You have much more money, ok go there :)"
,,Overwhelming,5.0,,Orchard road is good to go for a wander around. All the shops are for high end shoppers. Can be overwhelming for kids but a good experience.
,,A long shopping strip of all kinds of shops,4.0,,"From luxury international stores to one dollar shops you can find all sorts along Orchard Road. There is almost as many shops underground as there above ground. I like to visit Isetan, Takashimaya (both are department stores) and Kinokinuya bookshop. Further down towards Somerset the apple store is worth a visit too. Plenty of food and drink places on all levels though not the cheapest in the city."
,,Shopping n people watching,4.0,,"China chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Indians, Europeans, Americans - great for people watching. Lots of shopping with international brands like Victoria's Secret, Chanel, Rolex .. etc. Like every other big city's shopping. Cafes and all type of restaurants plus lots of vegan options."
,,Ghost shopping belt ...,1.0,,"So may empty shops only ghost doing the shopping here ...

Those shops that are operating, the items/services on offer are so expensive ... in fact overly expensive ... i suppose they have the G to thank for that ...

I think with the internet, everyone can check the pricing of the items/services on offer and 99% of the time it would be unreasonably priced ..."
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,You can't miss it as it is the main street in Singapore. It has every luxury brand store that you can imagine and in fact has 2 of some of them. It also has a McDonalds---a taste from home!

,,An iconic place,5.0,,"There are a few famous streets in the world, Orchard is definitely one of them and second to none for night life, restaurants, shopping centers, luxury malls and more
A very nice walk of less than a hour will take you to Marina Bay... if you don't go bankrupt!"
,,Shopping Centres everywhere,5.0,,"Every high end shop imaginable there with lots of choice. As far as I could see the prices were the same as Australia or dearer. Lucky Plaza has been around for 30 years and has lots of souvenier shops & cheap casual clothing - I was told not to buy electronics here. The food court at the base is cheap & cheerful Kopi ( rich black coffee with condensed milk) is under $2- & worth having, milo drinks (Ice, milo, milk & condensed milk) $2- with lots of ice tea around the same price (much cheaper than Starbucks) - the little ice cream cart men on the street are a bargain at $1-20 slice of ice cream & two wafers. Food Republic is a fantastic food court worth visiting on the 5th floor in Wisma Atria 435 Orchard Road. All the places are interconnected for crossing the road with underground walkways more shops & air con."

But it’s also nice just to walk around and dream.
And there are som great art on the road, so please enjoy them as well."
,,Mind blowing,5.0,,"I have never seen an array of more exquisite malls like the ones on orchard road. And trust that my wife says ""I love that place""!
Regardless whether you are shopping or not, the ambience of the place will soothe you. Being surrounded with high quality makes you feel high quality too.
Make sure you hold a little money because you'll definitely want to buy some stuff.
There are smoking areas and where you can just sit and soak in the surroundings.
It is a must for everyone"
,,Impressive street,5.0,,"Most shopping is high end but there are so many shopping centres that sell all the same things as we have at home. Endless shops and eateries. The lights and statues are impressive at night. Always busy, lots of people. Open from 10.00 - 10.00."
,,Orchard road..,5.0,,"Orchard road is the face of the shopping destination of singapore and its the singapore retail heart with many shopping malls and top rated hotels.

,,Too many shops,3.0,,"There are soo many shops that you can spend a whole day just browsing.
It is a nice experience but the dissapointing factor is the subway. You can spend a good hour just trying to cross the street, I mean why can they just have traffic lights at the junction instead of using the underpass. It's ridiculous!!!!"
,,Luxury shopping area,5.0,,"We visited orchard road during the Christmas holidays , the road was amazing and fully decorated. There were music bands celebrating on the street . It is a place for luxury shopping. Any brand you are searching for sure you will find it there . Even in the underground you can find luxury brands. The street is always busy and crowded . Best way to go there coming from anywhere is the MRT as the traffic is high most of the day. A very nice experience really and a must see place in singapore."
,,Lovely drive,4.0,,Hop on hop off bus tour I find very helpful to get your bearings generally. This tour took us down Orchard road and it was lovely and green and a little more restful than the hustle and bustle of centre which I found overwhelming after a time.
,,A cozy business area in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the best area for shop, dine and business in town, in spite of a higher price here. We can find most fine brand here in many malls along the road. Our favorite malls are Ion, Paragon, Wisma Atria and Nge An City and few new malls."
,,Shopping shopping shopping,5.0,,When in Singapore you must visit Or hard Road with its big malls and big brands! Even if you do t shop the experience is pretty cool plus many of the malls have delicious food courts !
,,No trip is complete without Orchard Road,5.0,,Singapore is famous for its shopping destination - particularly Orchard Road which forms more than 2km long stretch of road that houses famous hotels and shopping malls. You'd probably need few days just to walk around this area - if you like shopping.
,,"It has it all, but not the cheapest",4.0,,"Definitely worth spending some time there, and there are some average bargains ... but generally VERY expensive and basically a tourist area.
One tour guide told us that the locals never spending money in Orchard Road.
Some food was expensive and Western focussed (which is understandable) but as we choose local culture and food when we travel, we had to look a little harder."

,,Awesome street!,4.0,,"It’s a wonderful shopping destination! You name the brand and you have it here. It’s a high end market place, well connected with the metro which leaves you at the basement of the ION shopping plaza, one of the biggest attraction of this place. It’s a must visit place when you are in Singapore."
,,A road to Shop on,4.0,,It appears as though the whole road decided to dedicate itself to meet the needs of the avid shopper. I think I spotted nearly every brand with some have multiple stores (within a mall as well as standalone store).
,,Many High End Shops,3.0,,Nice and clean shopping areas. Many designer stores with expensive price tags. The average shopper would not find many affordable purchases.
,,Good for budget-friendly food too,4.0,,"While Orchard Road is deservedly famous as a world class shopping district, inside many of the malls and centres you will find an array of food outlets too.

There is a huge variety of different types and styles to choose from, as well as food for all budgets too. So if you're looking for a well priced and tasty meal, Orchard Road is a good place to go (after you've shopped till you dropped, that is)."
,,The essence of Singapore,4.0,,Anyone who has been to Singapore will definitely go to Orchard Road. It is once of the longest shopping street... with Malls and plazas. One can just walk endlessly. Love the way they try to connect each building underground so that you can escape the heat. Genius!!
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,This is the best place to buy something. Big shopping malls and hotels stand on many side along Orchard rd. You can find luxury goods and fancy restaurant every where from kinds of cuisine. And some clinic and hospital too. Must try the traditional cutting ice cream with bread on the street.

,,Beautiful place with tons of shopping and hotels (even at night),4.0,,"This road is by far the best one to shop, eat and spend time. We did multiple trips and spent time at different places too. You have few MRT stations right through the road and many hotels (hilton, St.Regis etc). Starbucks, Coffee bean almost open till midnight and service there is good. Very safe and nice place to walk around, eat and shop"
,,Good for High-Street and Luxury Boutiques,5.0,,"No shopping jaunt in Singapore is complete without visit to Orchard Road. Lined with sparkly malls, the renowned shopping belt is decked with high-street and luxury boutiques such as Prada at ION Orchard, Y-3 at Mandarin Gallery, and the first global flagship UNIQLO store at Orchard Central."
,,Shopping galore,5.0,,This is the high street of Singapore for any luxurious brands: the place to shop at. I felt this place for a peaceful organized chaos.
,,Shopping heaven for luxury items,4.0,,"The walkway along the street is very nice. There are so many shopping malls along the street and sometimes it is hard to choose which one to go into it. The malls are well connected as well, and the latest is the Orchard Gateway which is very modern and well design(malls + drink and foods district).
Recommended if you like to shop for branded items and enjoy the nice restaurants."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Orchard road is famous for the countless shopping malls and the perfect place for anybody who is looking for bargains
,,Shopping shopping shopping,5.0,,This road is all about shopping and even more shopping. High end shops are typically found in paragon. There are also lots of restaurants all over the place
,,Anything and Everything on Orchard Road,5.0,,"Spectacular Christmas lights and decorations, shopping, dining and colour, even snow and you do not have to wear boots. Friendly happy and courteous people. All within easy walking and lots of public transport. Even oldies can enjoy it."
,,Free and Easy,4.0,,Its nice to walk along Orchard Road with the wide pedestrian walkway with ease. One of the must do things is to have the ice cream in bread. This always brings back memories since the 70s. The price has increased a little to $1.20 but the flavour still remains. The vendors have aged of course and still keeping the tradition going..thanks to the apek and ah soh (uncles and aunties) who have kept this attraction going...cheers.
,,High end,4.0,,"Famous place for shopping,most of the stores are high end.Best time to visit orchard road is end of the year while they are celebrate christmas and new year season"
,,"Nice, but with Marina Bay Sands around the corner....",3.0,,"It has all the big brands and the posh atmosphere. Roads are wide and safe to walk (of course, it is s'pore). And you'll be able to find every luxury thing you'd need. But it's busy and crowded at any given day of the week. My preference is definitely MBS. Somehow MBS is less touristic, and offers better food... Having said all that, it is still a nice area to stroll around and watch the hypercars blast by."
,,Orchard road,4.0,,Orchard Road is an 2 miles via for shopping. Many brand store that you never saw before. Underground shopping also connecting with metros system and food courts. Amazing . If in singapore came to see the impressive futuristic building. Do not forget the visit ion sky view for free 54 floor at ion building.
,,The Main HQ of Singapore Malls,5.0,,"Orchard Road needs no further introduction, it is the go-to place if you like to shop from one mall to another.

Malls are side-by-side, ranging from upscale to normal looking to old (those with 70's to 80's vibe) shopping malls.
This is a must-go place for tourists and shopaholics."
,,Shoppers paradise.,5.0,,"everything and anything you could need. Well designed shopping strip. You can shop most of Orchard road, without having to go out in the heat. Most centres are linked at ground or basement level. You end up at the other end of Orchard rd without realising. A great mix of high end Fashion, to low end nicks and knacks. Something for everyone. Plenty of food choices along the way."
,,Walk and Shop,5.0,,"Orchard Road is so famous that many events, not necessarily shopping, are done here, from school competitions, flash mobs, fairs, etc. It is fun to walk around here. Pedestrians are pampered with many shopping centres open along the road. One can also enter the buildings one by one to see what branded stores are found inside. MRT stations are also located there to ease the journey from all over Singapore."
,,Glitzy,4.0,,"In the 60's this was THE place. My parents used to go to CK TANGS and it was like a magical emporium of the wonderful East. I was so disappointed when I went back after 50 years and Tangs was just a high price Dept store stocked full of expensive western stuff. All the charm had completely gone. The street is impressive with lots of interesting buildings and glitzy allure but I was a little sad it had none of what I remembered, but that is change for you and presumably what people want. I enjoyed walking the length and ate at Odd One Out on the corner of the lovely Emerald Hill street, which created a bit of atmosphere. I also enjoyed talking to some shop keepers at the bottom of the street where there were a few cheaper shops, nearer to Bugis area who were very friendly. It is still a mecca for shopping, just not the sort of shopping I am really interested in. The Visitor centre were helpful and a good stop along the walk."
,,A Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Like Oxford street or Regent Street in London, Orchard Road is the lifeline in Singapore that houses most the shops, shopping malls, restaurants, hotels. I have been visiting this place regularly for five years consecutively and was very much at home as I used to spend one month in summer there and I am aware of most of the places and their locations.Once upon a time Singapore was a favourite destination for purchase of electronic goods but of late has become very costly. As a tourist one can enjoy going there and watching the identity of that place that is purely and truly Singapore

,,Best shopping in Asia!,5.0,,"Orchard street has almost every brand you could think of. They cater to the interest of every shopper! But before visiting the street, it's advisable to search about the brand stores so that you don't miss out on anything !"
,,Good if your cashed up!,3.0,,"Great to look at as these shopping centres are grand but an average person cannot afford to shop here. Majority of the stores are high end boutiques with price tags to match. There are plenty of eating places along the way, lots of many bey exchange booths which offer great rates, there are some souvenir type shops but I think it's more interesting to go to the Bagus markets to buy the touristy things. Glad I went to see the famous Orchard Rd but I wouldn't stay at that end of the city."
,,Fun to walk around,5.0,,This is one place where it doesn't cost any dime to watch the people flow but can cost an arm and a leg at the many branded merchandise for sale. It is a shopping mecca for the afficionados. One place to go for your fashion and food needs.

,,Excess!!!,4.0,,A busy manic street Bustling with shippers and street artists A cathedral to the excess of shopping and consumerism But all the malls are air conditioned. So good to escape the heat
,,"Busy, Shopping but surprisingly clean and safe",5.0,,"This place is a shoppers paradise. The actual road itself is not the thing - its all of the interconnected malls underneath.

Besides the main shopping malls you can do to one of the many electrical discount malls (Lucky Plaza) all the malls have W.C facilities are buggy and wheelchair friendly, have various eateries from coffee shops to restaurants. There are walkways with ground level or below to get between most of the malls to avoid the heat or rain. If tourists when purchasing anything ask where to claim your GST (tax) back as each shop may have a central location in the mall.."
,,Paradise for shopaholics,4.0,,I have not seen so many department stores concentrated in one area. Love the displays but I saw mostly international designer brands in the different malls. Loved walking around and just window shopping.
,,Leave your credit card at the hotel,4.0,,Every designer label on the planet is represented here. One store we looked at had a sign at the entrance which said 'SALE'. The dresses were 'from $1296' ?. If you are in the PARAGON mall you must have lunch at So Pho restaurant in the basement food court. The best vietnamese food ever. It cost us $37 for 2 meals and drinks. Fabulous!
,,Shopping heaven numero uno,4.0,,"This the place to shop till you drop with more than 30 shopping malls and complexes to choose from from middle end priced goods to the most exclusive and expensive. Thgere are three MRT Stations along this road namely the Orchard, Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut. There are numerous benches for you to sit when you are tired. Some of the shopping centres are linked to the MRT Stations and to each other via underpass. There are many nice resturants and hotels around. The popular ones are the lon, Takashimaya, {Paragon, Wisma Atria and Mandarin Gallery. Philipinos gather at their favourite Lucky Plaza on weekends."

,,Most hapenning place in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is elite road in Singapore. It has lots of posh malls with many world class retail outlets and stores. You can find most of the luxury brands goods shopping here. This road connects few MRT lines (Orchard MRT, Someret MRT & Dhoby Ghat) so it's quite easily accessible.

The malls like ION, Paragon & Takashimaya (Nee Ang City) are few of the famous places to visit. During Christmas and New Year eve this road turns in to celebration and all vehicles will be stopped and lots of street music and arts going round. It will be very vibrant during Christmas and New Year.

Most of the malls have eateries and you can always find food inside mall. It's good if you walk along the road to get the glimpse of it. Just to mention the newly opened Apple store is located in this street."
,,Cool Area for Shopping !,5.0,,"I visited twice, Usually its alive all day along but on Saturday & Sunday will have extra Crowd. I went to but some electronic stuff, found it on best price, would visit again. Nice place to click some Selfies !!"
,,Lost its charm,1.0,,"Many shops in malls along this road also represented all over the malls in singapore . Lacks charm, appeal and character after the shopping element is taken away. End up being a cold facade of buildings after buildings. the iconic ck tang building demolished to make way for a new hotel. Some buskers here and there but mostly foreigners performing and no relation to the charm of singapore. the garden city charm the tourism board tried to emulate along this iconic road fell flat with only remnants of some half surviving orchids. It has truly lost its charm and must visit location."
,,Lost its mojo,2.0,,"If you like relentless shopping with the same brands you see everywhere else in the world, at the same prices, in huge shopping malls and (at weekends) streets jammed with local domestic helpers on their day off (the lucky ones) then Orchard Road is fine. Like so much High Street retail around the globe, Orchard Rd has lost its sparkle. It's just another street now. Singapore has so many more interesting places to go. If it's upmarket shopping Orchard Rd has Ion, admittedly. But that is dull beside Marina Bay Sands that has so much more going on in and around. And why go to singapore for shopping anyway ? It has nothing special - at least not if you are coming from Europe or North America"
,,Heaps of choices within walking distance,4.0,,"They say if you have seen one Mall, you have seen them all ! However Orchard Road offers a much more unique experience.
You need minimum half a day or more to do justice. On offer
heaps of International and local variety of products. Malls are interconnected with easy access and air-conditioning."

,,Shopping Street,4.0,,This is the place to go to when you want to go shopping. Covered in malls you can find high end brands to smaller more mainstream brands here as well. This is 'the' place to shop. A wide selection of restaurants as well but mostly high end. You can find Hard Rock Cafe just off this road as well.
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"If you like a bit of retail therapy, this is the place for you! A very long road full of just about every designer you can think of, whether it be stand alone or within one of the many shopping malls.
Both upmarket or bargain hunters will find something along this road plus many restaurants and coffee shops to keep your energy levels up.
Dust off the credit cards and put some comfortable shoes on, your in for a long ride!!!"

,,High-Energy Shopping,4.0,,"Whatever you want to find as far as brand names, you can probably source it here. I bought a souvenir umbrella in the midst of a downpour five years ago at one of the shops along Orchard and still use it. At its best during the Christmas holidays, when the decorations go over the top! (From a past trip.)"
,,Too busy for me,3.0,,"If you like crowds then Orchard Road may be the perfect place for you, and especially so in the afternoon on a weekend. If you're more like me then you may prefer to avoid it altogether or to instead choose to visit in the morning. There are plenty of shops along the road but you can usually find the same brands in other locations with less people. Be prepared to pay a lot of money for a coffee in this part of Singapore."

,,Great if you are rich,2.0,,"I didn't expect all the shops to be so high end. Really very little was affordable with Prada at both sides of the street type thing. Visually beautiful with stunning planting and sidewalks, just don't expect to find much to purchase if you are on a budget."
,,Shopping at Orchard Road,3.0,,"Certainly a shopper's paradise, but the crowd is too intense and if you are out in the open the heat and humidity are too overwhelming"

,,"Err, a lot of shops",3.0,,"Thought I'd take a stroll along Orchard Rd as it was recommended by a friend. The best thing for me was the architecture, really enjoyed looking at that and admiring the curves in so many of the buildings. But really it's just shops and that is not really my thing.
If you enjoy a visit to Channel, D&G, Prada and the like then this is the place for you!"
,,Sat or Sunday outings for shopping,4.0,,One thing that continues to attract me in Singapore are Orchard delights. Major shopping hubs aka malls are in Orchard road. Major clothing labels like Uniqlo/H&M/ Zara/marks & spencer have their flagship store here. You want to buy a watch Rolex/Cartier/Bvlgari/Tiffany - have a major store here for jewelleries. Other than this apple and samsung have a real big store here. It is a wonderful experience to have a stroll. Avoid Sundays if you are not a lover of too much crowd

You can get very depressed, or uber-happy, or just don't give a damn like myself, to walk around in this maze of street-side boutiques, inside malls and underground passages filled with myriad of restaurants and shops, all clinically clean and super AC cooled...

If you are not interested, at least you get to escape the humidity outside. I just wanted to quickly see it before leaving Singapore, wasn't interested in shopping. Worth to see it once, just to check it off your list, not a big priority though. Not much local character, just super modern and sanitized..."

,,Shopping paradise,3.0,,"Lots of shops, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, hotels nearby, etc. The roads are endless and you'll be able to shop for hours on end. For tourists, I suppose it would be good to come at least once. As a Singaporean, there are so many shopping malls in neighbourhoods that I don't really visit Orchard as much as before. It's really accessible by MRT and I would recommend this mode of transport. The parking rates are really high if you're driving."

,,Orchard Road Shopping Mecca,4.0,,"It was some years since we were last strolling along Orchard Road. Not too much changed, some plazas have declined whilst others, Like Singapura Plaza are relatively new and very westernised. Usual good selection of shop types and heaps of food shops. One thing noted was that there are very few seating areas outside of the food shops, unlike Australian centres. If you are an avid shopper and you just want to take a break without entering a coffee shop , there are few places to rest up."
,,"What we ""didn't"" know!",4.0,,"We travelled to beautiful Singapore on our way back from Europe in July 2017, our hotel was right around the corner from Orchard road, I could wait to see 'cheap street' ( this was what I remember it being called 30 years ago, by all the sailors in my family who travelled there on deployment .Well firstly it most certainly isn't 'cheap' there are mostly very high end shops here, Prada, Gucci etc etc, but there are certainly plenty of them, apart from the shops , there's music , food, hordes of people and traffic, it's ALIVE, just walking down the street is an experience, but after walking from our hotel over a couple of days, we found it so hot & humid it's a little uncomfortable, so, one day we noticed ( don't know how we missed it before) there was a set of stairs leading underground, we assumed subway, but OMG, there is a whole city underground!!!!! It's AMAZING, we got totally and wonderfully lost amongst the hundreds of shops underground, it's blissfully cool down there , so many shops it's mind boggling , honestly, there are interlinking shopping centres that feel like they go for miles, as with everything in Singapore, it's pristine cleanliness, and so blissfully cool, you could spend your whole holiday underground ( buy please don't, because Singapore has SO MUCH to offer) . So by all means, go walk along beautiful, alive, ( a little expensive) Orchard road, but do yourself a favour and go UNDER Orchard road. Oh and on the (Western ?) corner of Orchard road every night there is live music for your entertainment. There's nothing not to like on Singapore!"

Orchard Road is to Singapore what Oxford Street is to London, Buchanan Street is to Glasgow, Royal Mile is to Edinburgh, and Champ Elysees is to Paris.

During our most recent visit to Singapore, we ensured that we allocated a lengthy amount of time on our agenda for another extended visit to Orchard Road.
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves wandering through the shopping malls, department stores and ""high-end"" specialty stores which line each side of the exciting boulevard. There is always something new and interesting to see.

Or the ION to Wheelock to Isetan, Tang's , etc. ( this is it's a huge underground that you can get loss).

You can also walk along Orchard to the president palace just to take a picture!
Enjoying all the window displays from the stores.
It is a wide, convenient walking path on the streets."
,,Orchard,5.0,,"Orchard Road is kind of ""Rodeo Drive meets Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon"". Hotels, Restaurants, Bars, small local mom and pop shops to High end Dept stores.

,,Plenty to see,5.0,,"Came here to visit a friend. Actually this is my second visit. 1st visit was more than 6years ago, amazing how fast it developed. Along the road are lines of shopping complexes with intriguing designs and alleys with so much to see... Every turn is a discovery.

,,A temple to consumerism,2.0,,"We live in New York and close to Manhattan, still we found Orchid Road a bit too much. It is indeed a shopping haven aimed at pleasing every pocket book. The. tire of premium stores and the prices shopping here warrants must be keeping the credit industry in full swing.

The road has quadrupled many times over in last 20 years with stores, mid level and premium designer alike, setting up multiple stores in each of the several malls in this road.

Prices are high even by Singapore standards. I'd advise to seek your hotel concierge's help in identifying a specific establishment to do your shopping so as to avoid buyers' remorse later when the bill comes due. There are better uses of money in this world of ours. Buys what's needed, not wanted.

Apologies if anyone is offended."

On Sundays especially you'll find the sidewalks mobbed with maids from other Asian countries who meet and visit with their friends along the sidewalks. Although traffic is restricted on this main road, more crossings for pedesterians force walkers to go undergroound and through a maze of shops to cross at some intersections."

,,Not on Sunday!,4.0,,"For those seeking shops bearing fashionable designer names, and many others not so well known, Orchard Road is the place to go. Best though to bring loads of cash or black or platinum credit cards.

But beware, don't go on Sunday when all the ex-pat maids, mostly filipinas, have the day off and congregate in Orchard Road, block the footpaths and raise the noise level to the point where it becomes unpleasant.

,,"A fine stretch of road, and one truth bomb.",4.0,,"A mostly straight uninterrupted 2.2km stretch of bitumen bordered by Tanglin and Fort Canning Park. Multi lane one way south heading, continues as Bras Basah Road. Few potholes. Unpleasant for cyclists. Serves the 111 SMRT route, while home to Orchard MRT itself. Traffic light controlled junctions allow pedestrians the ability to cross every second intersection. Crossings alternate between a series of considerably difficult to navigate underpasses and straightforward timed crossings. One of the few places in the country to consistently receive heavy traffic. Home to high end hotels, luxury brand flagship stores, mega malls, Orchard Towers and Lucky Plaza.

It is likely that outside of Orchard Towers and Lucky Plaza, you can probably buy all the same stuff available for a better price back home."
,,Lots and lots of great stores,5.0,,"Orchard Road is an excellent place to go shopping - no matter whether you are looking for clothes, jewelry or electronics.

,,Plastic Elestic,4.0,,You will need your plastic here....so many bargains (or not - but must haves) so leave plenty of room in your luagage
,,Its good to window shopping,4.0,,My friend and I did a backpacker to Singapore and orchard always be one of destination to sightsee and window shopping. If you lucky enough you'll get some discount at certain store there
,,Just a re-visit after a long while,3.0,,"Nothing special but if enjoying a long walk with shopping centres around, then is a must. Maybe I am not muchba shopping person, Orchard Road is not a must for my trip to Singapore :)"
,,Huge shopping centres,4.0,,There are so many shopping centres but I found everything to be very expensive. Not many mid range shops. Lots of designer shops. Enjoyed the food halls in the shopping centres. Got lost a fair bit as there is so much underground and difficult to get one's bearings. Take note of the name of the underpass when you enter the shopping centre!
,,"Malls, malls and more malls...",3.0,,"As I was staying in the Orchard Hotel, I took a walk along Orchard Road but Malls are not my thing. I did find a side street with some great street food which I enjoyed greatly."
,,Western style super Mall - not really a lot I couldn't get at home,4.0,,"The only reason I'd go back to this place is the food options. The shops are generally Western brand names that I know and don't offer me anything I can't get at home (and with Aus dollar at parity when I visited, some places were more expensive than at home). The food courts/shops are the reason to be there. From chains to authentic ramen or udon places there is plenty of choice. It's frantically busy and after a while became overwhelming. The benefit is it's out of the heat. Interesting to go once but I wouldn't go back. Not the experience I want"
,,Area to thin ur wallet,4.0,,Very nice to walk around here. Beautiful shopping zone with all the brands at their best poses. All the shops have sale offers and friendly. I will definitely visit this place again only for shopping and of course I will be there to take the revenge and this time I will have my ammo reloaded(wallet).
,,Worth a little stroll,4.0,,"I wouldn't call it an unmissable place but we've enjoyed going down the road. When you are stepping out at Orchad station and that you are heading South East direction of the center, after one kilometer, you'll see a historic road (Emerald road) which has kept it's genuine state. I appreciated seeing this street but even more the contrast of these little houses next to new big buildings. At the beginning of the street on the corner, you have a tourist office. You should go there. It's an experience. You have someone who is going to take care of you and go into details about things and places you want to visit."
,,Lots of big brands,4.0,,"If you come from a city with lots of big brands, this shops might not be that impressive. However, it does deserve a short 30 min to see what it's like on this street!"
,,Ice cream on the hot day,4.0,,Walking along Orchard Road you must be bump with a motor ice cream kiosk with auntie or uncle as sellers. On a hot day you would fine an ice cream cone or ice cream in bread were entertaining with only $1.2
,,A nice place to hang out,4.0,,"If you go to Singapore, Orchard road is definitely a place which you cannot miss. Lots of shopping and eateries to be found."

,,If you have tons of money than go,4.0,,Incredible how many exclusive shops and malls in one street. It is a nice place to visit if you need urban gateaway.
,,Shopping with variety,5.0,,"I love the ambience and energy in Orchard Road. With vast options for all types of shopping and food, Orchard road is good to walk around both in day and night. The pavements are wide enough and even if it rains you could cover the road between the shopping malls without getting wet."
,,It's a bunch of shopping malls...,3.0,,"I thought this was average... not because it's bad, but just because it's rather standard. It is after all just a bunch of shopping malls side by side, nothing more."
,,Above and below ground...,4.0,,"Orchard Rd has all the high end shops and goods you could want but it has a lot more than that to offer. If the heat of the day is too much, head underground, specifically Ion complex and continue shopping or explore the food halls; there are too numerous a restaurant to mention from traditional to fusion cuisine; fastfood (MacDonalds etc) to fast food (Street food which is superb). A lot of hotels are also situated along the road both modern and historical and it's a straight 6 km walk from the bay to the start of Orchard Rd but advise you do this before 10am as the heat started to pick up by then already. Walk and explore your way around as you really can't get lost and do stop for some Haagen Daas ice cream along the route. Finally, Sundays can be VERY busy so you may want to keep that in mind - pending if you like large crowds or not."
,,Opulence,4.0,,"Unless you have a platinum credit card, Orchard Rd is a place to window shop and people watch. There are a multitude of Mega-malls with all the high end boutiques : think Prada, Chanel, Coach, Jimmy Choo""s etc
And on the road you'll hear and see Porsche, Lamborghini,Rolls Royce, Maserati and Lexus, all less than 7yrs old.(Taxi driver told us cars are usually replaced after 7yrs and cannot be on the road after 10yrs).
Lucky Plaza is the place to go if you want to try the market type stalls with a good hawkers centre downstairs."
,,Orchard road,5.0,,"It is so nice strolling up and down the road going into different shopping malls. Seeing so many high end retailers on orchard road is amazing. Just the whole vibe in Singapore is wonderful, clean streets, wonderful walkways everything is easy to get around. Plenty of transport options. Shopping malls go on for ever one turns into another. Again good walking shoes and take water with you."

,,A FUN EVENING STROLL,4.0,,"We walked for a couple of hours down Orchard Road one evening and enjoyed the experience. We stopped at various bars en route for a drink and had a great time watching the locals going about their business. We also popped into several of the stores which are many and varied, so whether you are a casual or serious shopper or just a spectator a walk down Orchard Road is well worth the effort"
,,Shopping and shopping,4.0,,"It has malls after malls and most of the top end showrooms are present. One can get middle range ones too.
Some of the malls we visited were Ion mall, Takashimaya etc. From Ion mall go to basement which is huge and many levels are there with rows and rows of shops which are mid range."
,,A shoppers delight,4.0,,If you love to shop then you will love this area of Singapore. Some good venues to stop and refresh and people watch for those that are not buy buy buy orientated.
,,Ok,3.0,,"Not a great attraction, Dubai has much better malls and shopping attractions then this place. Also it is very expensive. Please do not spend much time"
,,Asias Finest Shopping District,5.0,,"A must see at christmas time.
The whole street lit up with lights and decorations .
The best shopping destination in Asia.
High end Fashion malls to luxury designer brand labels.
Great food choices mixed in with small bars pubs etc a very lively city.
Many hotels right in the street including JW Marriiott.
Plenty of taxi ranks to take you home.
Something for everyone in this shoppers paradise."
,,A shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Our hotel was on Orchard Road so we spent a lot of time up and down the street. There are so many places to shop there it is overwhelming.

In addition to shopping it is a great place to people watch. In the mornings we would grab a coffee and watch everyone coming and going.

,,Best location to stay in Singapore,5.0,,"We stayed smack bang in the middle of the Orchard Rd strip (not the road itself) . The location could not have been better.
Nine family members together it worked really well.
The ""girls"" could shop till they dropped then lunch and more shopping :-)
The Paragon Centre was a short stroll away and we breakfasted there every day.
Orchard Rd is a great hub to head off to all points of interest when in Singapore."
,,High end quality,5.0,,"High end shops- Louis Vuitton, Prada, Tiffany & Co, Gucci, Harry Winston etc NB normal tax refund is 7% but at LV only 5.5%. Worth considering if it's cheaper buying in Australia when travelling overseas and claiming 10% tax refund from Australia. Stunning shopping centre at Ion. To catch a taxi from Ion, go around the corner to the left- more frequent taxis and more helpful queue organiser. FYI- Grey cabs are more expensive."
,,Very busy shopping strip,4.0,,"So many shops and malls along Orchard Road, most likely the mot popular shopping strip in the whole of Singapore. Brand names are everywhere, but there are still bargains to find in places like Lucky Plaza."
,,Shopping shopping shopping!,5.0,,"High end shops on every square inch of this street. Very clean, lots to do and see and many nice places to eat!"

,,Interesting but too many smokers,4.0,,"My hotel was on Orchard Road so I was able to spend more time there than usual. This time I noticed that I was constantly dodging smoke from people smoking on the footpath. I found this really annoying and it somewhat spoiled my walk up the road.

I did, however, enjoy looking in the malls and found a good, reasonably priced, suitcase in OG Department Store to replace my broken one.

I ended up walking from Orchardgateway Mall at Somerset MRT to Ion Mall. As it was raining when I came out of Ion, I decided to catch the MRT just the one stop back to my hotel at Somerset MRT.

Quite a pleasant walk, if only they could do something about the second hand smoke."
,,Luxurious Shopping,3.0,,"Its a very posh place in Singapore. All the expensive clothing and jewellery can be purchased from here. Good place for luxurious spenders, nothing much to offer to a regular traveller."
,,An Icon But Now Like Other Shopping Centres,3.0,,"The old Orchard Road featured an array of small shops as well as a choice of big brand outlets. While it is still worth a stroll, the Big Brands have largely taken over offering much the same deals as in other big cities."
,,Orchard Road,2.0,,Expensive Shopping. Expensive Food. Expensive Hotels. Nothing fancy. Do not waste your time here. Best to move along. Taxis are generally easy to get. But can get long ques after 9pm. Estimated waiting time for taxi after 9pm is 45mins.
,,not just for shopping,5.0,,"A street full of malls, and malls full of all kinds of things you could ever imagine. Restaurants vary from fine dinning to food republic, from flavors all around the world to the most classic local gourmet. Friendly to parents with young children."
,,Just like any other experience in big cities globally,5.0,,"Orchard Road is my backyard so I may be prejudiced. As an attraction its something you can find in most big cities. So if shopping n enjoying cafes are your priorities then you have it all in Orchard Road and you will be spoiled for choice! However, if you are into seeing the real Singapore and are prepared to do some leg work , then I urge you to explore the side streets and discover unexpected delights.Stroll down Killiney Road and you will find some old Singapore homes which we call Peranankan homes in a lane off Killiney Road. Sample local coffee at a Kopi Tiam n try local breakfast or pastries.Oxley Road where the first Prime Minister's house is located is quite nearby. The back streets will also offer other surprises such as a Chinese Temple behind Center Point Shopping Mall. In short just let yourself go n wander around the area away from the main street. My favorite haunts are China town n Little India. Thats where you will see the authentic Singapore life. Have fun ! When you get hot slip into a shopping mall for a cool relief."
,,1000 shopping malls,5.0,,"How many malls are there? Anyone knows? You may need days just to get inside every mall! We found that the Orchard Gateway mall is great, with good stores are reasonable prizes and a restaurant at the 4th floor with good european kitchen!"
,,Orchard road on a weekend day = you gotta be suicidal!,5.0,,"Many maids of Singapore have a day off during weekends, so the Streets are crowded by them alone, besides locals and tourists who rush here to shop etc.

Many shops, also the flagship store of Uniqlo, which is a Japanese clothes store with good quality and affordable prices.

Worth visiting, but avoid weekends, its almost unbearable, so crowded that even in the MRT trainstations guards have to guide the crowds into different directions to avoid masses, unbelievable!"

,,Great for shopping,4.0,,So many stores of all kinds. I needed an Apple store and it was there! I wanted a book store and it was there! (Kinokuniya) Needed a camera memory chip and found it ! (Courts) Met for dim sum (Crystal Palace) there. We went on a Sunday and I don't know if that was typical or not but there were so many people there. There were a few street performers but not many. Would be good to have more of that for the ambience.
,,Shopping and strolling,5.0,,"Lot of buildings offices,commercial centre where you can find all items you want to buy. A place to stroll without in a hurry to reomearound"
,,Oasis in Asia,4.0,,"Spent many holidays in this beautiful country. Orchard Road is outrageously expensive but you learn how to get around that. You like to eat good? Hey, who doesn't? Get out to the hawker centres, every taxi driver is an expert on where to go for the best Laksa, the best chilli crab or the best indian.
Cheers"

Orchard road is nicely lined with all kinds of shopping possibilities and basically for almost any budget. Whether your looking for high end or your most affordable options or the inevitable bargain hunt, you'll find it here.

Make sure to take your time and grab a bite , there are plenty of choices and you will not be disappointed."
,,A Long Road of Shopping Malls,3.0,,"If you love to shop in malls, you will love this road. If you don't love shopping in malls, you'll be bored. It's the same stores as everywhere else in the world. One interesting thing is that much of it is underground. You don't need to cross streets. You go under them."
,,Shopping st !,5.0,,It was raining by the time we were there. Anyway there was no sale atm. Maybe there was no special events at that time
,,A must visit for all shopping lovers!,5.0,,"You can't visit Singapore without a stop at Orchard Road, to reall experience this shopping mecca. Sit down in a cafe and watch the locals pass by..."
,,A shopping Mecca.,4.0,,"This 2 kilometre stretch of road is famous world wide for good reason. The endless shops range from outrageously upmarket, to malls with many small shops with hustling owners.
Having said that, one needs to go with specifics in mind, otherwise after a while it starts to numb the brain,"
,,GOOD SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS,4.0,,"Orchard road has all the up market brands represented but also some inexpensive stores as well. Restaurants vary from local take away cuisine, food malls with food from different countries right up high class international dining."

,,Iconic,5.0,,"If you are an avid shopper this is the place to be for the high end market. I am not a shopper but it is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore for the first time. Although their are now a lot of shopping centres around Singapore these days, Orchard Road
has been there from virtually day one and is still an amazing place to visit whether you are a ""buyer"" or a ""window shopper"""
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"What's not to like about Orchard Road if you love shopping? You can purchase almost anything your materialistic heart desires, except maybe an elephant! Most of the shopping malls carry pretty much the same designer and high street brands (think Zara, H&M, Salvatore Ferragamo, Chanel) but it pays to do some research for less common brands. Personally, I prefer visiting the bookshops, music stores and restaurants as prices of apparel and electronics are no longer cheap in Singapore, even if they are duty-free. My favorite time of the year is Christmas and New Year when the whole street is decorated like a giant parade."
,,Must see,5.0,,Central shopping with a wide variety of shops. You are in the hustle and bustle of the city here. Worth a look

Orchard Road is just so clean and well maintained and at night this place hums.
Definitely a must do when in Singapore."
,,One of the Largest Shopping and Culinary Centers in the World,5.0,,"It's like no one likes to travel that does not know Orchard Road, Singapore. Worldwide tourist, shopping and culinary areas, with very wide sidewalks on both sides of the road. Various large malls are interconnected in this area, on the surface, or underground. This area is one of the largest shopping and culinary center in the world.

Do not forget, try the Singapore ice cream, which is sold on the sidewalk of Orchard Road, which has long been famous.

But you should be careful when shopping at Lucky Plaza, especially in the area of electronic goods, mobile phones, tablets and accessories, because quite a lot of reports of victims who deceived there."
,,Good to go,4.0,,Singapore can not be sensed unless you visit this super exciting shopping and touristic area. But you need patience to walk a bit.

,,When in Singapore,4.0,,- this is a should visit to join the maddening crowds both local and tourists especially in the evening- lots of high end shops but also some bargain basement haunts for the foragers - plenty of restaurants many high end but also some good value food courts - there are also a number of bars and clubs for the night owls - a system of underground walkways will keep you out of the humidity - these connect to the Orchard Road MTR so this venue is easily accessible from wherever you are staying in Singapore
,,Get lost in the huge shopping centres,4.0,,"Orchard Road is lined with massive shopping centres full of every high end brand you can imagine. They so huge that you can get lost in them for hours with your only guide to whether it's daylight outside is the app on your phone! Great fun for shopping, restaurants, mani-pedi's and most other shopping needs!"
,,The Place to Shop,5.0,,"If you like shopping, then Orchard Road is the place. From Plaza Singapura on the one end to the Tanglin Shopping Centre on the other end, the street is famous for all the different types of stores (although I prefer places like Lucky Plaza and Far East Plaza which both have a more ""down-to-earth"" and ""local"" feel). Deal and bargains can always be found at almost every step......"
,,Best place for evening walk and night out,5.0,,It's like a dream area for shoppers with all the top brands having their presence. One will feel like buying everything in the world but of course if one's pocket permits.I wil always go there whenever i go to singapore. Easily accessible by bus.
,,Shopping madness directly outside the metro stop!,5.0,,Orchard ia great. Just outside the metro stop still underground you are connected with shopping Malls that can offer you a big variety of shopping goodies!! The food court as well is impressive!
,,Orchard Rd has turned into Little Manila,1.0,,"Nothing against foreigners, but what once used to be a high end shopping street in Singapore has become a gathering place for foreign domestic workers from Philippines and foreign workers from India and Bangladesh. Lucky Plaza which is at the heart of Orchard Road is a favourite haunt of these workers. Not exactly sure if this helps to boost the image of Orchard Rd as a shopping street."
,,Very nice area for shopping and dining,5.0,,Best area in Singapore for shopping. They have all the good brands on this strech. Dining scene are also great. The have all different kinda of cuisines. Also good place for just stroll around with family. Very clean
,,Shoppers paradise and escape from the heat,4.0,,"A nice way to spend a steamy day in SG! Singapore is very hot, and that heat is overwhelming enough to encourage you to not want to do certain outdoor activities. Orchard road shopping is a great mid-day activity with reprieve from the heat. There are tons of high and middle end shops, department stores and places to eat, and the walk between buildings/malls is quick enough to avoid overheating, and some buildings are connected so you don't even have to go outside.

If you're looking for a specific store, your best bet is to figure out the building it is in then look in a directory. I was able to find some great sales, and at certain times of the year there are giant sales (i.e. the Great Singapore Sale in the summer), so if you're really into shopping, try to schedule your trip accordingly."
,,Awesome storefronts and fun night stroll,5.0,,"It is an amazing street with so many shops vying for customer attention. So, you get cool storefronts, lots of lights and ways to attract customers. There are so many stores!! You can find everything here. Walk down Orchard Road, if you have time, at night. There are many street performers and it is just fun to walk down this busy street."
,,High end shopping,5.0,,"Basically is another high end fashion shopping . Where all the big names are here . There are nightclub, cafe , and many shopping centres. Be prepared to face a large crowd of people !"
,,Love the madness,4.0,,"Need to plan well, which mall u wanna go. And yes, the underground pathways are a bit confusing it you are new to the city! But it just a great experience!"
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"One must visit this street while in Singapore else your visit is incomplete. Filled with outlets of various international and designer brands along with several food outlets, it is a perfect spot for meeting friends or a walk with your partner. During festival time it is beautifully lit up and looks very attractive."
,,Okay if you like modern cities . . . but . . .,3.0,,". . . but if you really want to see Singapore, Orchard Road can be missed. If you do happen to be staying in Orchard Road, hop on a bus or the MRT and get out and about. You'll save money for a start, and begin to see what really makes Singapore such a great place to visit . . . especially ""real"" Singapore food."
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,"Great long strip of shops catering to everyone's taste, from Designer to little boutique stalls to the big well known brands like H&M, Zara all in one strip. I stayed at the Shangri-La hotel which was a 5 minute walk from the start of Orchard road and on one of my days walked the entire strip making a day of it- stopping for lunch, drinks along the way. If you into shopping on holiday trips then i definitely think you will enjoy this strip.

There is also a few cool bars in the area where you can get decent cocktails deals depending on the day of the week so worth speaking to locals about."
,,You will go from one huge shopping mall to another huge shopping mall and they don't end,5.0,,"People say this is the shopping area and that is definitely true!
Huge shopping malls are pretty much built next to each other and you can leave one and enter a second one without even realizing. They have stores for anyone at any budget range. When you are hungry Food Republic and other large food courts are on the top floor or basement of different shopping malls.
If you are someone who wants to shop then defiantly check Orchard Road out and free up a whole day for this and Shop away!! :3"
,,Shoppers paradise - I'm not a shopper,3.0,,"I walked through many of various malls on Orchard Road. The malls consisted of many levels of small stores and each mall had its own character and price points. The malls are very clean, contain food courts and a offer a variety of goods. Merchants I interacted with were pleasant and helpful. Those who like to shop will definitely want to experience Orchard Road. My review only contains three stars because I am not a shopper. I liken Orchard Road to be Singapore's version of the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris."
,,Singapore's Premier Shopping Street,5.0,,"This is a weekend haunt for us, partly because it has all the international brands within a 1-km radius and is well connected with underpasses. Food choices are plentiful here and in fact, most will be spoilt for choice. This runs the gamut of local favourites in foodcourt sir specialty restaurants featuring mid to high price range cuisines."

,,Shopping Extravagana,5.0,,I do not think I have seen anything quite like Orchard Street outside of New York City. It looks like every major chain in the world has a flag ship location along the street.
,,BIG,5.0,,Had read reviews saying orchard rd was past it. Thats not what we found. Lots of variety at different price points.
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"Everything you need is here! Clothes, books, accessories, cosmetics, budget and luxury prices. And of course food!"
,,Bring your $$$$ or window shop,4.0,,"I enjoyed walking along Orchard Road and through all of the high-end malls.

A good place to hang out and people watch!"
,,Shopping precinct second to none,4.0,,"High end brands, large shopping malls, every food option imaginable. The orchard road precinct is a shopping paradise.

,,Window shopping.,5.0,,"Orchard road is one huge road full of designer shops...... malls..... make sure you take your credit cards with you. My husband and son bought me a designer handbag. The care and attention we were given was second to none, we were given. Refreshments, the bag came with dust cover, designer box and ribbon and then put into the designer carrier .... it was our only expensive purchase...... until my son came across all the shoe shops.... he came home with 7 pairs of trainers not yet out in the uk until last month...... oh, when shopping ask for a tax receipt and claim it back when leaving the country. Can be done at the airport"

,,And more brands,2.0,,Singapore and Asian culture seems to be brand orientated. This street was full of high end brands and personally for me it was a waste of time for me. I wont recommend going here unless you have nothing else to do or unless you would like to shop till you drop. There is a lot of other better things to do in the city that is worth your time.
,,so many malls,5.0,,"It had started to rain on our first day in Singapore, but we didnt realise it only lasts a short while, we were on the City Sightseening tour at the time and hopped off here. Visited the famous Tangs where my mum had shopped while we lived here in the 70's. The malls are amazing, a lot of designer brands, but worth a visit."
,,Good shopping,4.0,,"Pays to know what you are looking for before heading onto Orchard Road. Having not been to Singapore for 3 years, felt the quality in some of the large stores not up to the standard it was. Found other branches of same stores elsewhere in Singapore had much better quality. Pays to shop around"
,,shops shops shops,4.0,,"Every conceivable fancy shop, lots of more reasonably priced malls and what seems like about a million places to grab a bite to eat. It is certainly an experience when at it's busiest, and something that you have to see at least once whilst in Singapore."
,,Live street,5.0,,Wow it was wonderful. It was one of best street. It was full of malls and shops and restaurants. Totally it was live street i love it👍🏽

,,Great place,5.0,,"You can spend a whole day there just for shopping and tasting food. In general, the price for everything is pretty higher than other countries I have been visited to. There's a school called Sota School of the Art, where you can explore free, gain some creative ideas and this school will close at night."
,,Its a nice shopping street,4.0,,It is a nice long avenue with MTR and bus access featuring top stores as well as trinket and trash stores with shot glasses and t-shirts
,,Synonymous with Singapore,5.0,,"A trip to Singapore is not complete without a visit to orchard road. It has great energy and many malls selling almost everything that one wants.

Avoid trying to get a taxi during peak hours. That's a tough one and a dampener to a good day spent on orchard road."
,,Nice Shopping area,5.0,,Vety good shopping area. You can shop till you drop and you can find a lot of goods to buy.we strongly reccomend this place
,,Great place,5.0,,"Orchard road is kind a like of Robson Street in Vancouver. Big shopping place. All designer clothing all find here. I feel like i'm at a little las Vegas at night . Lots if lights and lots if people.
We ha a great ice cream sandwich here too. Too bad i did not bring my camera when we came here. You can find
Designer clothing like Gucci, Michael Korrs etc.
We did not clothing though. Just enjoyed the place."
,,High class area with all the rich hotels and buildings pubs around,5.0,,visit this place in the night to see all the rich around and to hangout in a late night pubs and bars
,,The shopping hub of Singapore!,5.0,,"Didn't join my colleagues for their dinner but went to Orchard Road to catch up with some old friends instead... And took a walk from the MRT station to Paragon (went to Toys R Us to buy Star Wars stuff - some are cheaper than back in Malaysia, even after currency conversion!) before going over to ION.

I was surprised that there were still so many people when it's a weeknight, whether they are headed for food or shopping therapy after work, or even families enjoying a night out. Of course this isn't as big as the weekend crowd but once again, let's not forget that it's a Tuesday night!

Which only goes to show one thing - despite the many spanking new suburban malls coming up all over Singapore, Orchard Road is still the place to go for Shopping fans!"
,,If you have not been here...it means you have not been to Singapore.,4.0,,"This is the icon of Singapore. Must visit.
But a few tips:
- for budget travellers, go to foodcourts to save cost
- if you want to dine at restaurants, pls check whether the resto has any branch outside of Orchard/Sommerset/Dhoby Ghaut as the ones there most likely are very crowded during meal time
- same thing with shopping, go to non-Orchard branches to avoid competing with too many people
- Lucky plaza usually gives good exchange rates
- to get around easily in Singapore, try gothere.sg"

,,Walk down the Road,3.0,,"Depending on what side of Orchard road you walk on - you have the high end side - Gucci, LV, Burberry etc and you have the side were the locals prefer and costs for everything are cheaper. We paid big time for a cup of coffee on high end and could buy a full lunch + drink in the other side where locals shop. Beware"
,,So many shops,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a long, long road full of a huge range of shops, from top of the range labels to more down market mid priced articles, If you can't find it on Orchard Road, it probably does not exist. If you are a shopper and love long walks window shopping before you buy, then this would be heaven, but wear comfortable shoes."
,,One of the world's great shopping districts,4.0,,Orchard Road is the location of many of the high end and designer stores located in Singapore. The diversity of stores is simply mind blowing and it would be very easy to spend a fortune here in a single afternoon. The easiest way to get to the heart of Orchard Road is via the MRT

,,Just a load of shops and traffic.,3.0,,"Ok if you like shopping, my wife particularly wanted to visit here as we were here 30 years ago, she was disappointed so much has changed, a lot of the shops are rather expensive and tend to have the same stuff , and the traffic is very busy."

Even when I was a little girls going back and forth to Singapore because of my father's work.

Orchard Road has always a special place in my heart.

It's a great place to shop and simply walk around.

My favorite places to shop are ION Mall because it has Sephora,H&M and more of my favorite brands.

Takashimaya Department store and Grocery is very memorable for me because I would live in Singapore for 1 week at a time because of my father's work and we would always got to Takashimaya."
,,Great place to blow all your money ...... will create havoc to your budgets !!!!,5.0,,"this time of the year June / july sees a lot of sale ..... so great time for some bargain . This is the rrea is the main shopping district in Singapore ... you would find most brands found across the world , so go look for a steal .... you might not get so disturbed after all if your budgets go hay wire !"
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,Great shopping and a wonderful variety of eating areas. Take your credit card. Easy access with the SMRT.
,,From Lucky Plaza to Chanel...,4.0,,"Orchard Road is of legendary status, and packed full of high end designer lable stores...but bargains can be found! If Prada and Chanel are your thing, you can certainly get your itch scratched...yet, also, if you are are after an economical pair of converse-esque runners (for less than $10.00) you can find them here too. It is also a fabulous place to wander along and people watch!"
,,Was better with more bars and eateries.,4.0,,Not what it was. Now just for shopaholics. And with the equity to the Aussie dollar no longer a bargain hunters paradise.
,,Shoo till you drop,4.0,,This is a long road with huge shopping malls. Each have food courts. They all are connected so can walk between malls and avoid the hot weather. MRT station at Orchard. If you are looking for specific shops suggest searching internet to see what malls they are in first as the malls are massive.
,,busy busy lots of choices,4.0,,"its the main strip in Singapore not the only strip for shopping but its the main one everyone visits and what Singapore is known for.

Make sure you have comfortable shoes on as you can be out from 0800 till the evening with all the options that are on offer.

You can pick up some good bargains if you are in Singapore in the right time of the year."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,So many shops to choose from. Brands from around the world. Not any cheaper than anywhere else unless it's sale time but definitely worth a visit to take in the city hustle and bustle Singapore style. Great place to people watch.
,,Orchard Road is Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,This street is filled with one shopping mall after another. They contain most of the famous and high end brand names in most of the places. It is a bit difficult to navigate through the traffic and the crosswalks are not always convenient to get from one side to the other. You have to go underground crosswalks in some places and they are a bit confusing to find your way. There are many hotels located along the way as well or nearby. Some nice restaurants as well with many different varieties of food to choose from. A good area to say when you are in Singapore as convenient to most sights and easy access.
,,"Amazing visit, out of my budget but worth a stroll",4.0,,"A must do when in Singapore! Wonderful clothing, not in my price range but totally enjoyed the experience"
,,Was not as clean as last time!,4.0,,"I was expecting to stroll the path of Orchard Road like before. But this time I had to reserve it as the road at around 10am was still full of leaves and some unused tents along side the path. The sitting concretes along the road were dirty and seemed to have been spilt with some syrups or something.
I may have had to explain myself that the constructions were rampant but I think other roadsides being repaired were not as filthy. Hope the cleanup team prioritized cleaning the so famous Orchard!"
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,We stayed near orchard road and it was a very good decision. For shopping there is no need to any place else. This road has got best of malls and they have got all types of shops. From premium brands to affordable brands. Lots of eating options are also there. Shops have everything from clothes to toys.
,,ORCHARD ROAD - Singapore's Most Famous Shopping Place,5.0,,"ORCHARD ROAD is Singapore's most visited shopping & entertainment street, especially for the haves, including those from neighbouring countries & worldwide.

In 19th century there were only several plantations, not too many houses & graveyards here & there...

Only in 20th century then ORCHARD ROAD had shops & its first supermarket C. K. TANG.

Now, it is the shopping paradise for the rich. A lot of landmark buildings & shopping malls -- TANG Plaza, ION Orchard, Ngee Ann City (TAKASHIMAYA), 313@somerset & PLAZA SINGAPURA, tens of hotels besides.

Very unique is that one end of The ORCHARD ROAD is the city state President's office, The ISTANA, the other end is the price winning BOTANIC GARDENS.

You can reach ORCHARD ROAD by subway train called MRT & alight at ORCHARD Station. The MRT (network) map is available for FREE at any Station Office.

,,great people watching,5.0,,A great place to see daily life. We sent on a Sunday and it was great for people watching and we ended up at a 3D movie! What a great day....
,,Not only a shoppers paradise!,5.0,,"Whether you are into shopping or not Orchard Road has to be seen to be believed! The range of shops, superstores and department stores on so many levels, above and below ground, defies belief!! It is very pleasant to walk along Orchard Road from either direction but don't ignore the side streets, in particular Emerald Hill Road which has some amazing original old buildings exhibiting some original architectural features! Keep a look out too for wild life! We saw some interesting lizards on Emerald Hill and as you gaze at the skyline you may glimpse a Sea Eagle soaring above!! Whilst walking Orchard Road it is also possible to climb to the top of buildings to explore roof gardens and enjoy an ariel view of Orchard Road and the surrounding area. Try the roof garden at Orchard Central accessed via a long escalator from street level. From here you can really appreciate the diversity of the old and new architecture! Don’t miss Istana Park either. There are number of off street opportunities to lose yourself in beautiful gardens and water features all along Orchard Road – there is so much more than just shopping!"
,,High end shopping area!!,1.0,,"Would recommend if you want to buy some too costly stuff. Else please don't go there..This is a posh area. Felt like we wasted our time there..There are some Indian restaurants, but they serve super expensive food."
,,You'll spend a lot there!,5.0,,"Everyone will find something for their taste and budget, there's also plenty of options for dining. If you plan to visit every shop, you need more than one day!"
,,Shopping ..On orchard Rd,4.0,,Luv orchard Rd once one navigated the under pass to ion shopping centre ..Lots to see and many eating places ..will visit again ..
,,Shoppers won't like me,3.0,,"I honestly think Orchard is a giant shopping mall (although it's just a series of relatively big shopping malls). Overcrowded, and mostly unaffordable. Singapore has much more to offer.
I would still advise a stroll mid-week (when there are less people) and there are many nice restaurants too."
,,Shopping streets!!!,3.0,,The amount of shops will help you find whatever you need to buy in the next corner!!! Impossible to pass through the crowds .
,,Shop till you drop !,5.0,,Singapore has many malls in the city center and in the suburbs. However Orchard Road is the famous long stretch of road which every visitor should at least visit once. Lots of nice malls and shops from one end of Orchard Road to another. My favorite part of this road is where Takashimaya / Ngee Ann City and Ion Malls are located. Pricey designer shops as well as some local shops and good food courts as well inside the malls.
,,It keeps getting better =),5.0,,Been visiting here as a child and it's marvellous to see how Singapore keeps outdoing itself each visit! Can't wait to be back!
,,Mainly a Mall Road with all the big malls on this road.,4.0,,visiting here will take you to most happening malls of the Singapore as this one is the posh locality of Singapore. But things are expensive here.
,,Great experience even if you're just window shopping,5.0,,"Orchard Road is an iconic Singapore location and well worth a visit, even if you're not a keen shopper. It's a lot of fun just exploring the multi-level department stores and the many underpasses and overpasses that connect them. There are some great eating areas scattered along Orchard Road too. We discovered that Japanese cuisine is the latest trend in Singapore but you can find dishes from every corner of the globe."
,,Overload of malls,3.0,,"Something you should experience, just to say you have, but its easy to become shopped out quickly. Great for the rich."
,,Shopping extravaganza,3.0,,"Plenty of shops and heaps of people to match. The Ion is probably the only one to stay in as the rest aren't as new. Hot out on the streets as well.
Not much to do with the kids after a while as they get bored. Good for a girls day out if travelling with friends."
,,"Malls, malls and malls",3.0,,This is the perfect place for shopaholics. But if you are just like me who are always on a budget while traveling my advice would be to do your research on what mall you could buy the things you need.
,,Mall after mall after mall,4.0,,The street really is unusual in as much as it is nothing but stores. Many of the high-end stores have several locations. How many Louis Vuitton stores do you need? Apparently there are not too many. There seems to be high-end watch store after high-end watch store with no end in sight. The crowds on a Saturday afternoon are something to behold. All these people must be buying something. Definitely worth the struggle even for a short while.
,,The magic,5.0,,Was in the area during Chinese New Year... it's a heaven for shoppers from fancy brands to easy souvenirs all under one roof...
,,Shop til you drop!,5.0,,"Loved it, would take days to get through all of the different malls and shops. A great day well spent. Has something for everyone."
,,Great shopping with International & local tastings.,4.0,,Enjoyed retail therapy with the SALEs on in almost all stores along Orchard rd. and the bonus was that there were food courts/food market places in most of the basement stores where I enjoyed the local delights so I did not have to leave the complex for respite.

,,Excellent if you love to shop,4.0,,"It's quite a long road with lots of shopping centres to walk through. Quite a few have the same or similar shops and you can move between some of them via underpasses.
If you are on the street though you will see some interesting sculptures and architecture- just make sure you stay hydrated in the heat.

There are some great restaurants and eateries along the street too so spend the day and evening here as well"
,,Shopping for branded products,4.0,,"If one wishes to spend the time and money shopping for world class top brands, this is one place which provides the answer! Don't miss it."
,,This is a must visit place,5.0,,I had thought of doing this on the last day of our visit which is what we did. But this was a wrong decision. We still regret not going there earlier. Once you go there then you will not go anywhere else for shopping.
,,"Vibrant, food,shop,people",5.0,,"It is the core activity of the city whereby plenty of happening around the stretch of the road, both side. Food, shop and people and more people making it a nice attraction for visitor to gather around. You can wonder around the area for the whole day."

,,Crowded !,5.0,,Beautiful place with lots of easy access to malls. My family is very happy as it is a shopping paradise but it is quite expensive.
,,ORCHARD Road in Singapore,4.0,,"ORCHARD Road is the  most popular shopping  street in Singapore  that all visitors MUST go to. Its length is from Dhoby Ghaut, Somerset to Orchard MRT (subway train) station and all the way to Tanglin Shopping Centre.

Most of the world's famous brands have shops in this road. Either you go for window shopping or to find branded items, you can go there.

We can find a lot of restaurants and a food court in every shopping mall.

Every Christmas & New Year, the road is beautifully decorated with lightings and every shopping mall also does the best they can to attract visitors by having programs and sale promotions here and there."
,,Shopping Crazy,4.0,,"One of the largest shopping streets in the world. Shop till you drop. The choice is amazing. Top brands from all over the world. Not cheap...if possible go there during ""Sales"". Don't get lost in this shopping paradise...You have to be well organised to be efficient :-)"
,,Everything you can imagine!,5.0,,"Easy access in and out. A nice place for shopping on different budgets. We've spend about 5 hours walking through the numerous shopping malls and didn't even cover them all. You can also find reasonable places to eat. However, in some restaurants prepare to wait due to the amount of clients."
,,Decent way to pass the time,3.0,,"We came here on our last day in Singapore to kill some time before our flight.

There are plenty of shopping centres to explore but be warned-we are quite early risers and thought we would come early to get a ""jump start"" on the day-everything was closed until at least mid-morning!

We were finally able to grab an overpriced breakfast at a coffee chain but it wasn't what we were expecting or hoping for on our last day.

Definitely look for the ice cream sandwiches they sell on the street for about a $1. I was told about them ahead of time by a coworker that used to live in Singapore and I wasn't disappointed."
,,Shoping paradise,5.0,,"My wife was disappointed with mustafa, so we went to orchid road and quarky quay U can shop n party here"
,,Over-commercialized but beautiful & well organized,3.0,,Busy shopping district with lots of people and lots of choices. Well organized walking sidewalks and crossings with lots of choices from beautifully designed shopping complexes. Lots of well known brand names but on the pricey side. Singapore is an expensive city.
,,Shopping,3.0,,"A huge amount of shops. They go down from street level as well as up. Most have underground walkways connecting. Every shop you can think of. From $2 to Tiffany, Prada, Gucci etc. prices are van in great Singapore sale not radically different from sydney. Feel like could have got most of it at home."
,,Bring your walking shoes,4.0,,If you enjoy high end swanky shopping this is the right place for you. You can weave your way down Orchard without going outside via the underground tunnels lined with shops. You'll feel like a shopping mole but at least it's air conditioned!
,,Lovely Place,5.0,,Mainly 2-3 shopping malls are the attraction in the place. I loved the mall Takashimaya SC and Kebab stall beside it.One of the posh area of Singapore.
,,Good if you want designer clothes and stuff,3.0,,"I was disappointed in Orchard road as I remembered it from many years ago, and there was more ordinary stores available. Also I was disappointed to see that tangs does not have a bargain basement anymore, that used to be great."
,,TOO long and not engaging,2.0,,Disappointed at the few and far between shopping and other attractions. We had a destination shop but gave up .. it was too far from one end to the other.. kids tired (10 and 13..)
,,Orchard! A places that you must come!,5.0,,"Orchard, if you come to Singapore, you never enter the Orchard, you are not considering come to Singapore! HaHa. Orchard is a signature venue that everyone should know. Shopping mall, eateries, cinema, bazaar, play store, all you can found here! You may spend a whole day weekend there. Takashimaya, Paragon, Lucky Plaza, Far East Plaza, Orchard Gateway, Ceneleisure, Somerset 313, .... 2 MRT Orchard and Somerset MRT bring you here. No place to cheer? Come to Orchard!"
,,A lot of people,4.0,,Most of the things you want you can find here but I think that there are better places to go for pure shopping! I liked the mall around the Fountain of Wealth!
,,"Disappointed, not what i thought",3.0,,Everyone said go to Orchard road and we actually booked a hotel just off the street. Found the bars average and expensive with no atmosphere and the national bed time seemed to get a lot of respect as everything closed before midnight! The shopping area was crowded and not mush really going on as a lot of shops have moved down to the bay area leaving behind some plain and local shops
,,Visit to Orchard Road,4.0,,"Orchard road is a must visit in Singapore as it is a popular place for shoppers to visit every different retail shop in the different malls along the road.
Super easy to reach by MRT and good to wear comfortable walking shoes for a diehard shopper to spend one own relaxed time to browse through every outlet! Plenty of lovely cafes and food outlets to fill your tummy so no worries.

Enjoy!"
,,Favourite shopping strip,4.0,,"This has become my favourite shopping strip, because it offers up so much variety in the type, style and price of the goods. It is also the most wonderful people watching place. On Sundays the helpers meet and have picnics and are dressed up to kill. At night time the shops are open until late and the buzz, excitement and amazing lights on the building make shopping an experience.
You need some time to walk the whole street as there are so many shopping malls to visit. The food halls are fascinating as well, with Ngee Ann being my favourite place to eat. There is such a wide variety of shops and nearly always a sale on. You really can get some amazing bargins!"

,,Shop till you drop!,4.0,,Shopping on Orchard Road during the half yearly sale was dissapointing. Even with discounts of 20 to 50% the prices were higher than other cities like Sydney and Rome. The range of items is wider than most cities and certain items like electrical can be found at bargain prices.
,,Delight for Tourists,5.0,,"It is a must visit road, with lots of malls and eating joints. Shops are full of variety of stuffs. Fashion is the blood of this area. Do try juices and shakes at any mall food area."
,,Great for shopaholics,4.0,,"There are plenty of shops and malls down this street to keep you occupied for hours. There are a range of things available, men, women, children. It's good to visit on a hot day as there are several air conditioned shopping centres."
,,Mainly high end shops,3.0,,I was hoping for more of a market experience but this street is filled with high end shops - although wander into the Lucky Plaza for more of a market experience.
,,Big Watson,4.0,,We came to Watson Orchard to buy rose hip oil and other skin vitamin. I think that Watson at Orchard is more complete than other Watson at Singapore. We also ate Singapore Ice Cream at Orchard Road.
,,"Shops, shops, shops",4.0,,If you love your high-end shopping and dining experiences this is a must stop. The road is a lovely mix of shops and restaurants with the hustle and bussel of the best cities. You can pretty walk the length of Orchard Road through the connected malls but the best experience is to start at the North end and head South towards the city.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Must do - love shopping down there - try Tangs their local department store. Dress up so you feel the part and finish up at Raffles Hotel for a Singapore Sling
,,The place to shop in singapore,3.0,,"If u like designer shopping then this is the place for u to spend your money.

,,Worth a look,3.0,,"An interesting walk and for people watching. Many high end stores and several department stores along the strip. If you are not into shopping, maybe spend your time doing other things."
,,Shopping street,4.0,,"Orchard Road contains variations of shops, food and bars set in large shopping centres some up to 10 storeys. Mostly inside or underground which can avoid the heat. Served by a number of train stations. Can be crowded at times but is such a large area that this is not usually an issue."
,,Excellent Christmas shopping destination and vibe,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised with the decor, vibe and feel that Orchard Street offered during the pre-Christmas season. It truly felt like Christmas was around the corner"
,,High End Shopping,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a collection of mega-malls, all with similar high-end stores catering to the well-heeled. If you're into that sort of shopping, Orchard will be heaven. You can get from mall to mall mostly in air conditioned comfort instead of sweltering in the sun.

But, in the end, it's Shopping of a kind I'm unfamiliar with."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,All of the shopping that anyone could ever ask for in one street. This place is heaven for those that need to break away from business and do a bit of shopping.
,,Shopping is the thing here,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise with wide footpaths, easily accessible by MRT, Bus, taxi or foot. Need to see Tangs and Iron Orchard and Takashimaya, Ngee Ann City are excellent places not to be missed."
,,"Shops, shops and more shopsA",3.0,,Great if you want to spend lots of money on branded products which are undoubtedly cheaper in your own country. Nothing special at all.

,,My fav place,5.0,,I always love to go shopping here. It's the area that has everything I want. And safe to shopping alone or with your baby.
,,"Shops, shops and more shops.",5.0,,"Amazing shops and they go on forever, often repeating themselves, especially the high end shops...how many Gucci, Prada, Sephora outlets can there be in one strip!! But the malls or plaza are the best. Great cheap meals to be found if you look in the right places. The Lucky Plaza was probably the cheapest on the strip. Beware the underpasses...you can lose your orientation easily and get lost amongst the different directions to go."
,,"Place to visit, impressive shop center",5.0,,"Even with only few hours free time in Singapore, nice place to go and walk through the multiple shopping center !

Probably every luxury brands have a shop here ... Impressive mall, always of course extremely cleans, with many possibilities to eat / drink various things

If you have enough money, many opportunities are open. If not, only for eyes pleasure, it's nice !"
,,Shopper Mecca,5.0,,"Every shop imaginable, in fact too many. Lovely wide footpaths, can walk the distance, stop in to every shopping mall if u wish. Can access by MRT, Bus, taxi or foot. Need to see Tangs and Iron Orchard and Takashimaya lower food hall, even has a Harrods shop! Just a place to go if you love shopping."
,,Almost Everyone Speaks English: and other info you might not hear elsewhere,4.0,,"Orchard is most fun when you have a destination in mind but your not too set on finding it. Look up a place or two in advance to explore and then see how the days goes. You might not get to your restaurant or shop, but you will likely find some amazing things.

Keys to wandering: The underground passageways are where it's all at. Take any escalator down and you will find yourself in a massive labyrinth of cool air, tiny delicious eateries and entire food courts, clean restrooms, and pathways to anywhere else you want to go on Orchard. If you are exploring it's best to just follow a tunnel and don't worry too much where you end up. You can always catch a taxi to get back to your final destination, or ask anyone you see who doesn't look in a hurry for directions. Better yet, surrender your itinerary to the adventure of it all and see where you end up. There is wifi everywhere (even underground) but signage can be confusing. Rest assured there will be food, drink, and a cab available no matter where you surface.

A few of my favorites: Isetan Japanese Grocery underneath the Shaw House for interesting food including bakery treats, take away snacks and fun Japanese candy. Tangs is a locally owned department store. Basement level has a tiny ""hawker center"" type of food court where you can sample hawker fare. Check out level 4 for unique gadgets and gifts & a lovely tea house lunch room that brings back olden days and has a fantastic view. If you're down at Paragon don't miss the food court basement level.

Final tips you might not hear elsewhere:
-Don't be put off by high-end shops if you do not consider yourself that type of shopper.
Everyone is welcome to browse and they have fun, unusual items.
-Hotels bars and restaurants are open to visitors and often offer excellent F&B choices.
-Cabs stop in designated spots so ask where to queue for one and trust the driver knows
what they are doing when they have to drive around to drop you off.
-If the heat is getting to you stop off for a cold drink and small bite. You will find amazing food everywhere so eat like a local; small amounts as often as possible.
-Eat EVERYTHING!! Try some things you've never had. Food in Singapore is Everything.

One more note: I find it hard to get info for teens. So this is one thing everyone can enjoy. Teens (mine) love the tunnels. This is where the more affordable shops are and teens are welcome. If they need to get out on their own you can split up and plan a meeting place somewhere central like the steps in front of ION. They will likely find the $2 Daiso store in the ION basement and will find endless quirky items to bring home from their Singapore adventure. Scape is also a great place for teens. It's located halfway down the street (toward Dhoby Ghot MRT from ION) just behind Cathay between Orchard & Grange."
,,Plenty to do,4.0,,"Great area for shopping, eating and drinking. Loved it. Loved the choice. I wish there were maps that showed the area to look at in the street, it's hard to decide which way to go."
,,Great Mall,5.0,,"Huge Mall , beautiful smell throughout , several floors with lots of designer shops. Worth a visit ."
,,Nice stroll,5.0,,"Whether you are bar hopping or shopping the wide variety of whats on offer, would definitely suggest starting at one end and making the somewhat long walk to the other end. Plenty of sites to see in route, and no shortage of places to stop for a bite, a coffee, or something stronger. Would say this provides a good overview of the commercial center of Singapore, but of course there is plenty else to see."
,,Shopping centre,3.0,,"Visited Orchard Road, which is full of designer shops, ok if that's what you are expecting or looking for. Was hoping for something different. If you love shopping and designer then this could be for you."
,,Shopaholic's Heaven,5.0,,"Very large and beautiful. It's a must to make it walking.
With all the stores you may want to visit if you are interested in brand shopping.
With some iconic brands as well some historic points of interest, this road is a must visit for the Shopaholics."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Great shopping with outstanding buildings so do walk outside at night to take photos and view the lightings.
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"The street is dominated by malls that have been built over a long time. Some are old, and reflect the 1970s and 1980s in design and layout. Others are ultra-modern, huge and busy. The underground part is centered around the Scotts road intersection and extends south along Orchard Road for a kilometer or so. It links several multi-story malls with the Orchard Rd MRT station. The street level is more interesting if you are not into high end shopping and extends from Tanglin in the north to Bras Basah Rd in the south. As long as it is not raining it is a nice walk with plenty of street trees and small vendors selling drinks and ice creams. The weekends tend to be incredibly busy, so unless you like massive crowds, best visit during the week. A huge variety of restaurants are scattered along its length so you are really spoilt for choice."
,,Happening Place,5.0,,Orchard Road is the happening place in Singapore. One must go there once during the visit. It is one of the most live road.
,,The place to shop,5.0,,"Orchard Road might not have the best value, but it's certainly the place to shop for all the luxury brands. Go towards nightfall if you can as the lighting is spectacular. Finish at the nearby Hawker stalls for dinner."
,,"Shops and more shops, repeating each other",3.0,,Spectacular looking road with lots of the same expensive shops being repeated Lots of underground access to the same shops
,,"For those who love shopping, and others",4.0,,"The first impression: Singaporeans take their shopping seriously! Having over 2km designated only for shopping and entertainment is indeed crazy, but equally enjoyable; particularly if you like malls, after malls, after malls... We only visited once and it was enough for us :).
The only advice: arm yourself with patience and a map (as much as possible). Many of these malls are connected underneath the streets, so you might end up entering one mall on one street, walk around, and end up exiting through a completely different mall 2 streets down the road.
Either way, it must be visited, at least once!"
,,Real Hustle Bustle,5.0,,"This road is always very busy, be it midnight or noon, the main shopping street of the city. The tree lined pavements are spacious enough for people to walk along, do window-shopping or just consider entering a restaurant or cafe. There are plenty of chick shops, jewellers, huge department stores and complexes to do your shopping, whatever you are looking for. ( Or even pick a hotel to avoid too much walking. ) There are numerous restaurants to choose from if you got hungry and in case you got tired you can use the public transport or one of the cabs readily available at stores or at hotels."
,,Family Place,5.0,,Nice place. visit with my family in 2015. clean and beautiful.as a south Asian it was a nice experience specially for my family.
,,This is shopping on steroids!,5.0,,"Orchard Road assaults all the senses in a very good way! There is so much take in - the sights, sounds and smells. It really is a shopping experience on steroids - there are SO MANY designer shops in one location. If you have a huge bank balance you will definitely be spoilt for choice, however for those of us that don't it is still a wonderful experience to 'window shop' and marvel at the outrageous prices. It is a little difficult to find more reasonably priced items, however they are out there so don't get disillusioned, you just need to get off the main road and travel into some of the smaller streets and malls."
,,Shopping in Singapore.,4.0,,Singapores orchard road is in my opinion one of the greatest places to shop in Asia.It stretches out for several kilomerers both on street level and below street level. The vast array of shops cover budgets to suit everyone.Below street level is a fascinating place to shop away from the heat and hustle and bustle of on the street.It would be impossible to cover the whole area in one day as you are never in the same place twice.The awesome aquariam below is something not to be missed.
,,must visit when in singapore,4.0,,"must visit when in Singapore, lots of high end shops, food courts and importantly is has air conditioning to escape the humidity."

,,The heaven shopping distric in Singapore,5.0,,"Don't say that you're already visited Singapore if you don't have the photo with the colourful iconic statue in Orchad area.

,,"Shop, dine and stay",5.0,,"Anyone who visit Singapore will sure come to this street. It's where you find hotels, cafes, restaurants and shopping malls.

,,"Shops, malls and people",5.0,,"Orchard Road is crammed so full of shopping malls, food courts and restaurants, there really is something for everyone. On a Sunday people seem to like gathering and having picnics near the medical centre"
,,A one off experience if you like history.....,5.0,,"Not many bargains in Singapore these days.....but a visit to the major shopping plazas is worthwhile. Be careful of touts and hold you handbag close when you use the elevators. Otherwise, worth a visit."
,,A pleasant walk through a great shopping district,5.0,,"Shops of every description line this road. Walk into the many shopping malls and shop till you drop and rejuvenate yourself with food in the many restaurants too. There are hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, fast food joints, food courts too."

,,Shoppers Heaven,5.0,,Not only is there shopping for kilometres above the ground there are 3+ levels underground! Shop till you drop. Open till 10pm every night.
,,Shop till Drop,4.0,,"All Malls is in here. If you want to buy a branded one, you must go here. L*, Guc*i, Pr*da, and many others. For you who can't afford branded things, you can just sightseeing for the crowded and don't forget to eat an ice cream here."
,,Vibrant and Fun,4.0,,"Orchard has always been vibrant and colorful. It seems the area does not sleep. I particularly liked that this is linked to the MRT, so going around is convenient, away from the warm streets. But is can also be fun and exciting to walk the whole length of ORchard Road especially at night. Lights, sounds and people having fun merge in one delightful experience."
,,"Great for window shopping, but not ""cheap"" at all",3.0,,"If you arrive with a fistful of dollars (actually better a fisful of credit cards) then Orchard road is the place for you, but if you are not into $3000 Armani suits, there are many many better shopping malls in Singapore"
,,Heart of the city,5.0,,Stayed very close to orchard. Its simply amazing being there. Would recommend visiting on your next trip.
,,Shopping and lots of birds.,3.0,,"Nice clean city centre area to stay in. Lots of shopping malls and designer shops, there's also lots of food around the area. In the evening the trees fill with hundreds of birds which sounds a little out of place, but quite nice."
,,Anything your heart desires!,4.0,,"They have mall after all here! You can shop for nearly anything and at nearly any price point! Hope you left space in your suitcase! If you are keen on brands from Japan, they have a ton of shops stemming from there! (Tokyu Hands, Muji, and a full mall Takashiyama)"
,,Stop over,5.0,,I was very disappointed with Orchard Rd. Most of the shops are high end such as Chanel and Gucci. There was no way you could browse and the staff seemed to be looking at you in a critical way. Some of the Malls were better but you go to Singapore to experience the Rd and it was disappointing.
,,High-end type of place ☺️,5.0,,"I think this is the central busines district of Singapore. You can see malls, hotels, offices, etc. here. The place is so sossy, having so many boutiques like Louis vuitton, Gucci, etc. ☺️☺️☺️ I will definitely come back. I recommend you ride a bus so you can enjoy your sight seeing"
,,Busy shopping street it's never ending malls,3.0,,"Visited here late last year, was just a very busy shopping street with the same brands you see everywhere
No real bargains to be found and not really worth wasting your time visiting unless the humidity gets too much and you're in need of some air con!"
,,Singapores heartland,5.0,,"to shop the lenght of Orchid raod would take almost a life tome, from top end shops like Prada to bargain ( and sometime rip offs) like Lucky plaza everything you couls possibly want are there , good food out lets, towers of shops to get lost in and always safe !"
,,Shopping on Orchard Road,3.0,,There are so many shops to see and walk through. All the designer shops plus so many devoted to jewellery and technology. You had better wear comfy shoes as it is a long way to walk and in the humidity can be wearing.
,,Strictly for Premium shoppers,3.0,,Orchard road is fast losing it charm and is slotting itself as the premium or luxury shopping street.
,,HiFi shopping ..!,4.0,,"This is a classic urban area to move around in the evening time, the Shopping malls over here all together gives a different experience..! Just look around and walk, as they follow strict traffic rules in Singapore.."
,,Branded Shopping,5.0,,"Most people came here for shopping or dining. Most items are branded which quite expensive. But I don't recommend you to come on Sunday, it will be crowded there because the domestic helpers get holiday every Sunday and they are gathered around Orchard area"
,,If you fancy a day shopping,4.0,,"Spent the day here, like every other shopping mall - same shops, brands, items... If you do go shopping, ask specifically for a VAT tax receipt for a refund at the airport - we thought we could do this with normal receipts, but you can't.

Found a HaagenDazs cafe which was a delight!"
,,All you need,5.0,,All the designer shops are here plus plenty of eating and drinking places. The Orchard hotel is ideally placed if you are needing to visit this road.

,,Shopping time,4.0,,"Get ready to fall in love with all its lights, cafés and mostly the boutiques with charm which make u buy the best brands."
,,Get ready for marching,4.0,,"Nice to see, be aware the shops and stores are underground and it is a bit tricky to get around and find your way. Also it is rather high priced, but perfect for a rainy or very hot day."
,,Shopping and more shopping,3.0,,I'm from NYC and the amount of malls on Orchard Road is unbelievable. You do start to get the same stores in all the malls. But the designs of each mall are so different it's interesting to walk through. Some cool artwork outside too.
,,The Rodeo Drive of Singapore,4.0,,"We lived in Singapore six plus years. Many tourists and expats love shopping and eating in Orchard Rd establishments. The ""great Singapore Sale"" in July is popular. I am not a ""shopper"" so my only interest in Orchard Rd are the gorgeous holiday decorations and Chinese New Year festivities and Buddhist events. Tang's is marvelous. The Fullerton Health group is located inside Ngee Ann City/ Takashimaya complex. O R is a
""must see"" location for any visitor."
,,Window Shopping Destination,5.0,,"Singapore never miss the latest fashion, I feel! take a half or whole day to peek to various luxury store there is a way to spend time in Singapore. Tired? Take a break at tiny cafe and you may find a fantastic vending machine somewhere here. It's a machine that squeeze you fresh orange juice within a reasonable price."
,,A street of Shopping,4.0,,"Love shopping? Don't think twice, just come. From high class to medium and affordable stuff. You can just go Orchard road and find it there."
,,Very Hapenning,5.0,,Full of different types of restaurants and malls. A lot of branded shops are also located on this road. The entire road is very lively until late night. Safe and no security concern
,,Hmmmm,3.0,,"Maybe I just want in the mood, but it's all just high street shops and designer stores, same the world over. Nothing particularly unique or interesting."

,,Family Holiday,5.0,,Road is full of Designer shops. MRT station is very near. Nice restaurants. Very clean and many malls.
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"If you are a shop-o-holic then this is heaven! However it pays to know where the bargains are. Otherwise, it is just another high class shopping district. I must admit that it was too hot to hop from one shopping building to the next. And once you've been to one, the other looks exactly the same. We had trouble finding somewhere to eat as they were either food court type offering or very high class type restaurants. We eventually found a decent Thai restaurant to have lunch."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"Orchard City Road is where all the nightlife and shopping happens you are spoiled for choice for restaurants outdoor dining areas pubs ect. It is amazing to see the different choices for food , as well as the entire range of the shopping experience or you could relax and have a drink and watch the world go by."

,,Shopping,4.0,,Classy and spotless stores. Close to rail transport and restaurants. We felt very safe walking around after dark. Easy access to cheap food ( watch where the locals are eating.)
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping, walking",5.0,,"I'm a local, born and bred in Singapore. This would be one of my go-to places to shop (albeit a little on the expensive side), but I'll always avoid weekends as it gets crazy crowded. You can spend the whole day walking the whole stretch, going in and out of countless shopping malls to take cover from the heat. The street stretches from around Dhoby Ghaut MRT all the way to Orchard Road MRT station with more streets running perpendicular the main street. You can also walk from Bugis MRT station to City hall MRT station as well, and if you feel up for the challenge, walk down to Singapore River. A local, or a train conductor, should be able to point you in the right direction.
On the days up to any significant event (Chinese New Year, Christmas etc) the whole street will be decorated with beautiful light-up ornaments, so I usually prefer to head there in the evening/night. (Plus, you don't have to deal with the insane Singapore heat and humidity)"
,,One of the best shopping experiences in the world,5.0,,"Great shopping choices for all tastes and needs - a lot of ""high end"" shopping but also possible to shop at less expensive venues and many offer tax refunds providing certain minimum spends are reached."
,,Nice place to shop,4.0,,Good area with many shopping malls. Few are interconnected.Good high end stuff.Food and water around the area is costly.
,,Vacation,5.0,,"It is a shoppers paradise for high end shopping . You have all the top brands here with their latest collection in various malls which are interconnected If you want to buy sports shoes then would recommend you to go to Paragon mall One must also see Ion orchard mall and Takashimaya which is one of the oldest malls My personal favourite was the Somerset mrt mall Where we found good deals at Cotton on and Uniqlo shops. There is also a Charles and Keith outlet , Zara and Forever21 shop here At the basement level are many food joints but would recommend Marche a Swiss joint for their Vegetarian Pizza , Pasta , Salads and the deserts The taste of Tiramisu still lingers on and brings a smile .Ben and Jerry is right next to it if you love ice creams"
,,Shop until you drop!,5.0,,"Central Singapore and worth a visit for shopping: large and small shops, national and international. Stop and have a coffee and continue at night when it lights up and really buzzes."

,,"Exciting, busy and expensive",5.0,,"If your visiting Singapore, you have to walk along Orchard Road shopping district. Great architecture, expensive shopping. If your on a budget, try Lucky Plaza, its where the locals get their souvenirs as a fraction of the price at the attractions."
,,Good place to hang out,4.0,,"Orchard Road contains tons of shopping malls. Its a good place to hang out. All the malls are interconnected. So when its raining or its hot, use these walkaways to get going.
Some malls like Ion Orchards caters to High end people and can be extremely heaven on the wallet. Its best to compare prices at different shops before buying.

The roadside eateries and alfresco coffee shops are also a great way to spend time here."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Shopping Paradise, lots of shopping centres. Easily accessible, easily get around By train, bus, walking."
,,Street full of designers,4.0,,If you like shopping then there is no other place to be but hitting Orchard Road. Full of designer shops and other stores. Throw in some shopping centres as well and you have Orchard Road. Nicely lit up at night.
,,All Budget Shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road has a great range of shopping centres at every different price.
Two of the shopping centres i visited was Ion Orchard and Orchard Gateway.
Ion was more designer brands and Gateway more cheaper shopping.
As a tourist I'm interested in shopping for something i can take home with me.
Not large household items.
My favourite spot on Orchard Road is the amazing free lookout from the 55th and 56th floors of the Ion Orchard Shopping Centre.
Ion Sky is free and open between 3pm and 6pm.
Ion Sky can be found on TripAdvisor to for more information."
,,Worth a visit,5.0,,"Wasn't planning on shopping in Singapore as it's something I can do back home. We ended up there because our tour guide was dropping someone off. I had heard of Orchad Road, but wasn't prepared by what I saw. So we ended up getting off as well and found a local food stall to eat. We then wandered off to walk back to our hotel. This place is huge, and offers international well known brands to, less well known Asian brands little known in the European market. Worth a visit just for the wow factor even if you don't intend to shop. If you do intend to shop... then you're in for a treat!"
,,Shopping YES,4.0,,If you love to shop and the Spores do you will enjoy this area. Lots of boutiques along the orchard road that will delight your senses. .
,,Busy,4.0,,"Expensive, but still one of the great shopping streets in the world! Plenty of good outlets as well."
,,Shopping and shopping,5.0,,"Love the varied collection of shops, from low end to high end, clothes to electronics, luxury to necessity. Convenience and customer service are great, and restaurants and drinks are reading available to replenish between shopping excursions. Love it."
,,Amazing infrastructure and great range of shops,4.0,,"Even though Singapore is expensive, the array of products available is unbeatable. Orchard Road has the best variety of shops ranging from good old and well-known H&M and Zara to less prominent stores like Harry Winston, Cartier, Prada and Valentino and the best of couture. I love shopping due to the variety and products available for different price groups. Prefer ION as compared to the rest. Paragon is also great. There are a couple of hotels and service apartments on and off Orchard Road. There are also numerous places to eat, snack, grab a coffee or even a beer. Love the bustling energy, enthusiastic shoppers and tourists. If nothing else, walk on the streets and do some people watching."
,,Perfect for shopping,5.0,,"This place is shoppers paradise, it was just shopping malls after shopping malls. I was in heaven! They even had street performers outside to keep my partner occupied whilst i did some shopping."
,,A shopping option for everyone,5.0,,"I love Orchard Rd and have ever since I first visited Singapore in the early 1980s. While the shopping district offers all the big names and the matching high prices, it also caters for those with a limited budget. The Japanese $2 shop is incredible value for one. And then there is the fabulous food offerings. I love the Ion Food Court and the variety and value it offers personally, but there are many similar places for a great value meal. The underground connections are lots of fun to walk and try out new options and a great place to stay out of the heat."
,,"Similar to Manhattan, NY.",5.0,,"Really very good area for shopping. Good cleanliness. Very good ambience. Good green environment. All leading brand items shops, show rooms are available."
,,Famous Orchard Rd,5.0,,Walking along this bustling road with the myriad shopping malls and so many people [day or night] is lovely...unless there is a torrential downpour!

Oh and some malls, high-end shoppes and even a grocery store (I liked that one the most)."
,,For all your Shopping needs…Orchard Road.,5.0,,"When visiting Orchard road be sure to go to ALL the Malls along its length…..Do not be shy of going into the shops and assessing their prices. Some will surprise you as being very reasonable….BUT there are plenty of ""LABEL DESIGNER SHOPS"" that are probably best to limit to ""window shopping"" ;)
When you are hungry head for the food hall or ""food Replublic"" in MOST malls….where you can get reasonably priced meals/snacks."
,,Used to be fun,2.0,,"I visited Orchard Road for the first time in over 5 years.
I was disappointed by how much of the charm it had lost. It's overrun with malls that all have the same chain stores in them. All the smokers line the sidewalk to puff so you walk down the street in a haze of fumes and cigarette pollution. The walk from Wheeler Place to Orchard Plaza is a fight through crowds and obnoxious skater packs. I was glad to reach Plaza Singapura and be done with it. I feel that Boat Quay is much more enjoyable to get a taste of Singapore than Orchard; which is a real shame because I used to enjoy that area."
,,Memories from my 95 trip.,5.0,,"I loved Orchard road, although it has changed a lot from 1995, with a lot more of the fashion stores in profile and even small malls. I also found the 'old orchard road' and discovered an excellent tailor who made a few suits for me. We walked both sides of the road and and it still is a major attraction for folk visiting Singapore. We did battle to find a taxi station back to the hotel so we used uber which worked perfectly."
,,Too high end for the average blow in tourist,3.0,,Orchard road is a 2km long boulevard that is brimming with wall to wall high end materialism. Our travel agent placed us in a hotel close to this area and so we passed through it a fair few times on our way to the contained orchard road MRT station.The road itself is fairly overwhelming in terms of shop numbers but one thing you will notice is that it is all high end brands - often with multiple stores only hundreds of metres apart. The prices in singapore are pretty much on par with Australia so unless you have more money than sense or are looking for a particular item the high costs will really make browsing pointless and uncomfortable. It can certainly be missed on the average tourist itinerary in my opinion.
,,Retail heaven,5.0,,"Robinsons store for an all round shopping feast.
Currently they have massive sale on.
Lots of boutiques for all budgets all the way along orchard road.
Lots of restaurants

From traditional eateries to 5-star eateries and fashion and jewellery brands - Hermes, Tiffany, Chanel, Harry Winston, Pomellato or the humble but popular Zara, etc, all within the Orchard Road belt.
If not for the shopping and eateries, enjoy the architecture of ION, the up and coming popular stretch of Orchard Gateway buildings, 313@ Somerset and Orchard Central offering you, riding on the highest escalator ride in Singapore - my legs quiver when I am on it and I don't suffer from acrophobia.

,,One and the same,3.0,,"Probably interesting for a short walk but after a while, everything is repetitive. The locals will also probably tell you that you can find the things that they are selling there elsewhere in more neighbourhood malls (which might be more convenient depending on where you are).

However, no harm heading down to take a look."
,,Amazing and must see,5.0,,I highly recommend visiting it. Has tons of stones and so many shopping experience Great for walking and eating. Don't miss the underground stores and restaurants.
,,average !,3.0,,"Nothing new that you couldnt get anywhere else in the world really. Seem to cater for the 'full wallet' and not really a lot of bargains on offer..
Found that Orchard Road and perhaps the whole of Singapore has become more and more expensive over the years.
It's so crowded... !
Lucky Plaza (where the bargains are supposed to be!) was so overcrowded and didn't have many tourists at all
The only thing I bought on Orchard Road was a coffee !"
,,Big wallet's needed!,4.0,,It's a shoppers paradise! There a few massive Plaza's which have all designer shops. It's buzzing with lots of big spenders. Defo research where you want to go as the road is over 2 miles long!
,,Don't get the hype,5.0,,"Granted it is a nice road. Granted there are some nice spots there (some nicer than others) but erading and hearing about it ahead of going let us believe that it was much much more than what we saw. The fact that you have to go up and down stairs, bridges or passways in order to cross the street and get from one spot to the other was very tiring and at times quite annoying. It is nice yes but misses that wow effect"
,,Boring same shops...,2.0,,"hard to x the road, boring shops... wasted a half day.. go Marina Bay Sands so at least you can get some good selfies avout there.."

,,Ridiculous amounts of luxury shopping - typically more expensive than EU,4.0,,"The Orchard Road probably has the highest concentration of luxury designer stores in the smallest area. The shopping centres are meticulously laid out, very clean and modern.

There are many great food courts on the basement levels and surrounding roads off Orchard Road.

However, prices for luxury goods are typically more expensive than in the EU or USA. So the savings after tax still typically equate to more than the RRP in an EU state."

,,A stroll down memory lane.,5.0,,"My how Orchard road has changed since the sixties when we lived here. Beautiful shops, many of them. Tang plaza etc, you won't be disappointed by the choice on offer.

It is a see of lights at night, and all the stores are opened till very late. All the high end brands are there, and you do not need to shop to enjoy the atmosphere. To me it looked like a museum under the opened sky. But if you are prepared to spend - it is paradise..."
,,Walk along the Orchard with ur half one!,3.0,,"Walking in Singapore is not strange. However, it will not be complete if you don't walk Orchard Road. Walking at evening or night would be recommend as the breezes comes and the weather becomes cool down. You can see many shopping malls at each side and many street vendors on the platform. I bought Ice cream sandwich and love to eat it! It only costs S$1.2. If you want to enjoy street performance, you can choose according to your taste like pop, rock and musical instruments.etc. When you feel hungry, there are food courts in Shopping malls (Wisma Atria/ Orchard and so on). Plus, you can enjoy the decoration of lighting along the road!"

,,Not what I expected,2.0,,"While walking Orchard Road can be fun if you like to shop, it was not the high end luxury experience I expected. It may be that I was in the wrong part but what I saw were trendy chains among T shirt and hush puppy shoe stores. I was prepared for real luxury shopping and while there were a few high end spots it was not 5th Avenue - nothing was the equivalent of Sacs and Bergdorfs."

,,"Great shopping area with enough coffee shops, restaurants etc. to help sustain the weary shopper.",4.0,,"From my hotel near Chinatown I took a taxi down to the Orchard Road area, mainly with the intention of going to one of the cinemas in one of the malls there. As I had some time to spare before the film I had booked to see, I used it to explore some of the shops on Orchard Road including the Abercrombie & Fitch. I inevitably have to buy something there for the ladies in my life.

Even on an early Sunday evening all the shops were open and the place was bustling with shoppers and those seeking somewhere to eat, drink or be entertained for the evening. And here there is certainly a lot of choice, notably at the high price end for shopping."
,,Lively...hustling and bustling street !,5.0,,"It's one of the very well known places in Singapore with many malls and hotels all around it. A lot of high end shops along Orchard rd something for all tastes. Plus t's a very lively, happening, hustling and bustling place with people!"

Nice to walk there and escape from a hot day into the air conditioning"
,,Shoppers Paridice,5.0,,"Lots of shops only Main Street that has shops above ground beware not many places to cross from the main mall

Most of the shops are on one side of the road and are in small malls but with 7 floors and much the same items for sale it would be safe to say that when you been in one you seen them all

Lots of places to eat cheaply
Look out for the Ines with the wyes as they seem to be the best"
,,Disappointing,3.0,,"As a Singaporean, I wish more could be done to revive this place. I used to live near Orchard, and teenagers hanging out there was a thing. But over the last 10 years, there was a massive commercialisation of expensive brands coming in, making it a haven for loaded tourists, hence locals no longer find it worth it to shop there. With China's growth slowing, the place feels like a deserted town now. I wouldn't recommend buying anything at Orchard."
,,Food & Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Best place to shop, chill & definitely eat. You can be alone, couple or even family with kids. There's even buskers performing. Uncle selling ice cream by the walkway. One word for Orchard Road, LIT!!"
,,Excellent place to be,5.0,,"it is a place to shop, dine and people watching. You get to meet people from all walks of life and from different nationalities dressed in their best clothing either fashionable or practical"
,,icon in Sin,5.0,,"Must visit if you went to Singapore. All along the street are good. Many shops, nice place to relax, eating place etc"
,,Window shopping,5.0,,"Lots of interesting cafes restaurants etc in the buildings along Orchard Road. It is a happening place as many people go there. The road is one way and full of traffic so pedestrians have to use traffic lights' crossings.

There are lovely displays by the stores advertising their wares so you can stroll along Orchard Road admiring the arrangements as well as fellow strollers (people from all ages and walks of life). Young people: hippy or trendy. Couples, families with young children or babies in prams, mature singles.

Sometimes there's magic in the air as Orchard Road get to doll up with sparkling lights and decos for Christmas. There is also a cineplex in the middle with another cineplex each at both ends. So just imagine the crowds going for shows and coming out to enjoy the cafes and restaurants after shows. Posh hotels like Mandarin, Hilton abounds in this stragetic area.

All in all I would go visit Orchard Road once or twice every year just for window shopping on top of necessary visits for shopping or movies/group lunch celebrations or enjoying participants at big sales by various departmental stores eg Robinsons, Isetan, Espirit etc."
,,That's the street,5.0,,You can find everything under the earth in many many many malls also in the surface and all sorts of brands this is the paradise of the shoppers
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,"If it's shopping you're after, dont miss this. The Paragon centre is my favorite with all the designer stores, like Jimmy Choo, Prada, etc. The top floor is just designer baby and children clothes, Armani, Nike.... The basement has a wonderful supermarket and great restaurants. Do try Gyoza-ya and the amazing dim sum shop next door. If it's cheap clothes you're after,try Lucky Plaza."
,,Shopping extravaganza,5.0,,"With abundance of high end malls be prepared to exercise.
Connected to MRT with easy access.
Shops open from 10am- 10pm daily.
On route with SIA hop on bus.
Star Bucks , Hard Rock Cafe and the Coffee Bean and tea leaf coffee shops opened 24hours are available.
Many hotels with different budgets to suit all.
Safe to shop.
Crime alert posters clearly visible to all."
,,Nice place for high end shopping and Night Life,5.0,,Orchard Tower in Orchard Road mainly know for Night Life but apart from that there are high end showrooms good food joints ect.
,,So close to everything!,5.0,,"We stayed at the Concorde Hotel 100 Orchard Rd and everything at our doorstep. 2 minute walk to open food mart on the corner for quick eat out food, 5 minute walk to the big plazas and more shopping. All transport outside the hotel including taxis with a few minutes wait. Money machines, a public launderette, and more shopping malls along the entire street. Lots of European eating restaurants as well within walking distance and an exceptional restaurant inside that has the best afternoon tea."
,,Shopping...and more Shopping,5.0,,"An upscale shopping district..Prada..Gucci.. LV etc... you can also eat from local small restaurants I highly recommend The Wild Honey...Amazing breakfasts from all over the World,,,,!!!"
,,Shopping haven,5.0,,"Wow - amazing strip of shops that cater for all with high end designer, American high street fashion and local Asian market style. You could literally spend days here shopping through the numerous malls. It's definitely worth visiting for a few hours to take in the sheer scale, modern technology and hype of orchard road. We mainly spent time in ion mall above the MRT."
,,Overrated,3.0,,"Meh. Unless you are a millionaire and actually plan on spending your fortunes in these stores than it is pretty boring. Sure it is glitzy and glamorous but window shopping items with price tags at a minimum of $10k is only entertaining for 20 minutes before you feel a stiff urge to start drinking.
Definitely take a stroll but don't plan your whole day around it."
,,So many shops!,5.0,,"Orchard road in my opinion is every shoppers dream! There are many department stores and some familiar brands like H&M, Zara, Uni Qlo, etc. Look out for the Hawker centres/ Food courts in some of the larger stores (usually basement?) as you can eat very well for very little money.

I think Orchard road satisfies the needs of any shopper. I unfortunately did not get time to visit them all but I would suggest using a whole day if you wanted to attempt to visit them all as there really are so many!"
,,Primium location of Singapore,4.0,,One of the best place or premium location in Singapore major malls and the premium hotels are located in the area.

,,Confusing and crowded place,2.0,,"The street itself is crowded and very confusing. The stores here can be found in other districts as well so we just visited one mall (Takashimaya) grab some food and went back to the hotel. There are too many people here more than what I experienced in New York, Boston or Chicago."
,,"Glitsy, glamorous...but that's pretty much it",3.0,,"I always make myself visited Orchard Road everytime I go to Singapore, but not because of the shopping.

Orchard Road is Orchard Road, great strip for window shopping or shop till you drop if you have endless cash to spend.

Shopping mall after shopping mall, from the original Tang to the newer one like Sommerset, Paragon, or Ion. Or you also have option to go to the sort of Lucky Plaza to go for bargain shopping.

For first time Singapore visitor, its a must go, so you can experience walking down this famous shopping strip.

For me, Orchard is another destination to find great food because within each of these malls I always can find great food."

,,Another anodin throughfare,3.0,,"A series of modern shopping malls and commercial centres, without much character, as those can be seen elsewhere in the western world.. Probably interesting if coming from the outbacks.without much interest for the eastern culture. Overpriced place.."
,,So Much To See!,4.0,,"Goodness me - I've never seen so many shopping malls on top of one another! A shoppers' paradise if you like shopping or even just window shopping. Remember that Singapore is very expensive though. Even if you're not a shopper, it's still nice to wander down this vast road in the evening when the temperature is cooler, just watching the crowds go by and popping in & out of the huge amount of shops."
,,Wonderful Choices,5.0,,There is an eclectic mix of shopping. Mainly the large and well known European brands. Wide pavements and easily accessed from the MRT.
,,Amazing,5.0,,All types of stores from cheap purist things to high end for ever. Best day by far. Shopped until our feet hurt then shipped some more. Use the MRT to get here as it's cheap safe and fast. Totally recommend this place
,,WOW - Surreal & Bustling,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a surreal eye opener and amazingly entertaining area!!! As a person from a rural area I was blown away by the nightlife in the area. I felt as if I was in a movie script!!! Visiting on a busy Saturday evening my every sense was awoken on arrival. An incredible place, brightly lit and full of all kinds of people. A fantastic place to simply watch the world go by or to partake in some serious window shopping. I found the prices very similar to Melbourne so not many bargains to be found. Many places to eat, drink and be merry!!!"
,,Must do shopping experience,5.0,,You may not be necessarily buying couture or labels...you should visit this place to do some window shopping or give into your shopping temptations at the many shops laced aroud the Orchard MRT
,,All the high end brands repeated ad infinitum,3.0,,"This is Singapore's ""premier"" shopping strip (not sure if that means for locals or tourists or both).
It certainly has every large multinational brand you can think of, pretty much one of each per block for the length of this very long road. There's a smattering of interesting local places in amongst it all, a few specialised shops and some well above par food court style dining opportunities.

The food options are pretty good, the air conditioned shops provide respite from the constant heat and humidity BUT this is just one long series of the same few top international brands."
,,Busy,4.0,,"We went on a Sunday and it was quite busy. One side of the road had all the big brands like Tiffany, Chanel, Gucci, Prada and alot less busy. The other side of the road was incredibly super busy. I think it was called Lucky plaza (or something). Looked like a great place for souvineers and bargains- but was the most crowded place I have ever been too ever-and I think I discovered I really don't like crowds LOL. There was nowhere to sit, food court full at 3pm. We ate at McDonalds, but alot of people were not eating, they seemed to be using the space for free wifi! (I suspect). Anyways we went back across to the calmer, less busy side of the road. Great Bookshop, hugest one in Asia is in Orchard st- called Kinokuniya. Anyways great shopping, ION centre interesting."
,,Classy - Window Shopping,3.0,,"A great collection of brands and shops - I enjoyed window shopping. Located conveniently close to Marriott Tang, I explored the places and the shops around. I was amazed by the total collection- represents the Urban Singapore."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Very nice and different stores of all the most famous brands, there are also bars, restaurants, coffee shops an so on..."

,,Shopping,4.0,,What a great place to shop till you drop everything that you could possibly want we had a stroll around had a good look around. We went into a smaller shopping centre to have lunch and stumbled into a small eatery what a find lots of locals eating seats hard to get but we were lucky. We had 2 prawn and chicken veg noodle dishes very nice food only $5 for each dish and cheap drinks as well had a chat to the locals as well very friendly we'll be back
,,Amazing maze.,4.0,,"I travelled by MRT on my first visit during my stay and the underground tunnel system by which you could access shopping arcades, the train and cross under roads really stunned me. It was a bit daunting initially but quite easy to navigate through after a while. There were many types of shops from high end clothing to simple foods. The architectural range was very interesting and I stumbled across a 'Victoria Secrets' store which I didn’t realise even existed."
,,The Best,5.0,,"What can you say about the best shopping experience in the world ? Orchard road has everything from massive designer Malls to quant market malls. The street , like all of Singapore is immaculate with tasteful flowers and trees everywhere. It's not the cheapest place to shop but it is a great experience."
,,So Much Wealth,5.0,,"We walked along Orchard from Scotts Road toward the harbor. The sidewalk was crowded and lined with block after block of mostly upscale shops of world famous designer brands on the street or in malls. After seeing these same brand names throughout the Marina Bay mall yesterday, one can't help but be amazed by all the wealth concentrated in Singapore. And Orchard is such a beautiful street with all the tropical landscaping and absolutely NO trash or graffiti anywhere to be seen."
,,Best shopping street ever,5.0,,"Singapore is a shopping paradise. Orchard road is where to stay nearby. Ion, paragon, takashimaya, robinsons,and many more for shopping and gourmet food are here. Many hotels nearby. Four SEASONS HOTEL IS just a few meters away orchard road."

,,Its The SHOPPING DESTINATION,5.0,,"OMG. I don't know what to write. Its a paradise for shopoholics.

You get everything from 10 dollars to thousand dollars and variety and quality in unquestionable. You can easily hand around for hours and hours if you do not have single penny in your pocket.

Great place to shop."
,,Definitely worth a visit for shoppers,5.0,,"Range of shops and lots underground which is essential in the heat. Range from top end to really cheap, not much in between."
,,Bland and soulless,2.0,,You could be in any city in the world given the shops here. Do yourself a favour and head to Little India or Chinatown instead!
,,Best street art,5.0,,"We are not typically shoppers but if that is your thing, this is the place to go. You name it, they have it. We go for the walk and admire all the different statues and works of art. Our favourite city for strolling. Also nice to pop into a cafe or bar ."
,,Full of Foreigners,2.0,,"Used to be a must hang out place over the weekends. However since the flood of Foreign workers, there is lack of local touch. Visit orchard road on the weekdays if you do not like crowds."
,,"Shop, shop, shop",4.0,,It's like oxford street or Times Square or any other major shopping street in the world. Apart from it's the probably the cleanest and safest street you will ever shop on. It's not cheap though as we found with all of Singapore.
,,Good experience on a very well known spot,5.0,,One of the main attraction spot at singapore. Have one of the best singaporean ice cream. You cant cross the road but there is underground integrated subway channel.
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,There are many malls and shops so a great place to do your shopping before heading home. Beautiful buildings especially the department stores where the staff are most helpful

,,Favourite shopping street in Singapore,4.0,,This is the famous shopping destination for tourists. We as a local do come here often as it is where we can find anything that we requires to buy. From branded items to daily stuffs
,,Quick shopping,2.0,,Forgot to buy special makeup gift for daughter on recent trip. Checked in our luggage at the Changi airport and jumped on MRT to Orchard Road. Had trouble working out how to access the Orchard Road underground crossing to Tangs department store but finally managed to make it. Straight to makeup department which had the new product. No trouble getting back to train. Made it back to the airport and plane without further incident. Staff at Tangs very friendly and helpful.
,,Nice malls!,4.0,,"If you're into shopping and you visit Singapore, then you should definitely check out the malls on Orchard Road. Ion was my favorite, but there are also other good shopping centers. So many to choose from!!"
,,The road for shopping,5.0,,"Orchard Road has several excellent shopping Malls, and easy to get to wherever you're in Singapore. Be prepared to spend more than you think, as there is so much choice, from a huge selection of shops. From low end to high end designer, everything is here."

,,"It's a shoppers paradise, but don't expect bargains!",4.0,,"Singapore is very beautiful. Everything is imported. Everything is expensive. Accept that to be the price of such a city/country, and you will enjoy the experience more."
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"A must see for all visitors. The place comes alive at night with all the shops and wonderful eateries open , which stay open until late."
,,A bit faded and jaded? It all depends on your perspective...,3.0,,"Orchard Road has gone the way of the mega shopping street, and the big high end brands are there in force. Yes, it is a lot of fun to see the cars, the stars and the merchandise, though it does pall after a while, especially when you can remember when you could walk across Orchard Rd, and not have to use an underpass that spits you out into the lobby of a shop that you just dont have any interest in. It is a the perfect location for a brandwhore, though there are perfectly good shops that offer the same thing for half the price. Even a pint of beer works out to $30 SGD, and walking 300 metres toward Tanglin drops the price down to $12 SGD.
Great to have a look at for social commentary purposes, but if your values are more practical and edge away from the big brands, shop elsewhere."
,,Shopping paradise,3.0,,"Did someone way ""mall""? Here you'll find it all. Best parts are the many food courts where you'll find all kinds of asian cuisine at very reasonable prices."
,,Tired and boring,3.0,,"It has been many years since we last stayed over in Singapore and we decided to head to Orchard Road to do some shopping as our memory was that it was the place to go. Unfortunately it has slipped badly, it was dirty, prices were exorbitant and to be quite honest the shopping malls around Marina Bay left it for dead."
,,Interesting,5.0,,This is one of the popular place with all the fancy showrooms and the movie theaters in Shaw house and all the shopping mall looks very expensive and the bars too but it's great fun wondering around with convenient MRT services to get there. Nearby bars are pleasure visiting where most of the bars are open late night and the people at the bars are friendly too.
,,Shops!,4.0,,Pleasent place to walk around. So many shops! This is the place to go if you want to shop until you drop.
,,Shop 'til You Drop,4.0,,"If you really really really like shopping, Orchard Road is the place to be. There are many malls along Orchard Road with brand name products, from clothing, shoes and makeup to furniture, housewares and so much more. I find it personally overwhelming and don't like shopping in malls, but if you are into shopping, you can spend days without repeating the same mall. It is worth it just walking through the malls and seeing how creative the decor and lighting are. Walk on path ways that light up with different color neon lights; see the mural art on walls or the fun sculptures of gigantic shoes and more. There are also many restaurants within the malls, so you can take a break from your retail therapy and eat or drink something. Go shop 'til you drop!"
,,Best place for people watching/shopping,5.0,,Loved this road. We are bargain hunters and wished we had more time for shopping - the Lucky Plaza was a good spot but our bargain spot was Far East Plaza on Scotts not far from Orchard Road. There are a LOT of high end shops along Orchard as well - basically something for all tastes/wallets !People watching here is just so much fun - you want cosmopolitan - this is the place!
,,Nice,5.0,,"Pleasent place to walk around. Lots of shops and restaurants along the road, some open 24.Very crowded during weekends."
,,Shops and more Shops,5.0,,"This is the place to go if you want to shop until you drop. There are no real bargains in Orchard Road anymore but it's worth the visit. You will find All the brands from H&M, Forever 21, Rolex and Louis Vuitton the list just goes on."
,,Vibrant road with a high price tag,4.0,,"So many shops, you could easily spent 2 to 3 days exploring and using the under and overpasses to get from 1 mini centre to the next. However a it f these stalls come with the need for a biiig wallet. It seems to always be happening till late into the evening, shops, stalls, locals, restaurants. Great area to stay with some nice hotels and obviously very close to MRT station."
,,Quite a shopping experience,5.0,,"At first, I wasn't too keen on walking down a street with only malls splattered on both sides. But this one was different. But when I arrived, i realized this place is more than just that.

First, the is a mecca for shoppers. Mind you, prices at some places were more than those we spotted in London and New York, but rest assured, the collections there are unbeatable - this was for the high street shopper. Mid range shoppers have a few opportunities here and there, but folks looking for a bargain, that's not the place for you.

One thing you should experience is the ION ORCHARD. It is literally an underground mall. Funny thing is that you never feel that you are 3 or 4 and sometimes 5 levels under street level. Also, the food options there are better than else were.

Spend a day and hope around the place. You might catch something you like. Recommended when in Singapore."
,,The famous road,4.0,,"This is the most famous road in the singapore, in this roas so many shopping center, if you want to buy branded goods just come to this road"
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"The shopping here is awesome.... I would say it is as good as New York City. They have all the brands and loads of shopping centres. ION is one off the better ones and the shaw centre. However they are all connected under ground so you can cross over and honestly spend hours and hours and you still won't have seen it all.

Highly recommend for a great day out shopping."

,,Absolute rort,1.0,,"All the high end retail shops with the high end price tag ,this expanse of shopping area was way overpriced .prices here would make shopping in Harrods of London ,or the shops of New York seem cheap ,I don,t understand how anyone would want to pay these over inflated prices ,give this place a miss ."

Great place to spend you hard earned money with some great bargains to be picked up."

,,Designer shops retail therapy,3.0,,Good to walk around the various malls however most of them contain mainly top end designer shops where the prices are extortionate. Remember that Singapore is the most expensive country in the world and the prices of goods support this infamous claim. Good to relax at one of the coffee shops or a cheapish meal in a food court whilst wandering around. MRT train stations are convenient as are the underground links between malls and underpasses to get across roads.

,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping",5.0,,"Everything you can imagine is there and although is famous for very expensive stores, you can find smaller, hidden gems, too.

,,Upscale shopping,4.0,,Whatever you need you can find here. If your dollar is good with Singapore dollar you may see a few bargains. Just fun to window shop and get your walk exercise
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Orchard road is full of every type of shopping experience you can think of. There are endless shopping malls with very hig end shops, Gucci,D&G Louis Vuitton, Rolex, you name it,its there. If you don't like shopping,don't go."
,,Beware...Lot of brands to get lost into...,5.0,,Well this was a scary place for me as my wife went wild. LOL... Shopping paradise. Dont forget to carry your passport for tax refund. Nice places to eat out. Ice cream parlours to keep kids busy. Things are expensive here friends so walk with a budget else you can end up in a trouble. Haha...
,,Boisterous community with reasonable shopping!,5.0,,The road comprises various accommodation and is located very close to MRT Station where we can travel and do the shopping.
,,Shopping city,3.0,,We were dropped at the high end haute couture boutique end and it was similar to Bond Street in London but each store had 3 or more outlets. There was also the mid range shops on other floors with a more accessible price range. Worth a quick visit.
,,Hustle and bustle,5.0,,Very clean and very busy! Great atmosphere with some fabulous shops and restaurants. Singapore has changed so much over the years. We loved Tangs and lucky plaza
,,Shop - eat - repeat,5.0,,Very nice & happening place for shopping . Think of a brand it's there . Think of the product it's there . Lots of ggo eating places to try around . Good place to hang around and Enjoy the place by walk .
,,Brands galore,5.0,,"Great place to shop one shopping centre after another, but than again Singapore is a big shopping centre in it self."
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,"Anything you want can be found here. Expensive for ""poor"" South Africans but lovely things to see and buy. Tax refunds easy to obtain and offered at point of sale."
,,Great place to people watch,3.0,,"Orchard road has a number of high end malls -Ion, Paragon, Ngee Ann City with all premium brand labels you could ever want - Ion also has a garden and restaurants at the top as well as some very interesting statues inside the mall. there are also more affordable stores like Tangs and Orchard Shopping Centre and lots of places where you can buy tourist gifts. Along Orchard Road there are also a diverse range of restaurants from Chinese, American, Korean food etc. The best bit about Orchard Road is the people watching, it is a very busy street with a wide range of fashions - and that is just not only in the shops! At night all the birds also congregate around dusk making a bustling noise - Orchard Road - a must see road if you are in Singapore!"
,,One of most famous street,5.0,,Usually I had been stayed marina bay side but I had stayed one of hotel along orchard street for this visit. I could feel Singapore from this street a lot. Especially all the big trees along street and open cafe in big conjunction main area. No shopping purpose just take a walk also interesting. Just be aware it's really hot during day time.
,,The Commercial Side of Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore sometimes gets a bad rap as being too commercial. Usually that is due to a singular experience centered around Orchard Road. If Orchard is the only area you see in Singapore, one might easily conclude that the place is one big shopping strip - which would be grossly unfair. Thankfully, Orchard Road isn't representative of this diverse culture - so make sure you venture further out to appreciate the richness of Singapore.
Now, while you are strolling Orchard Road you WILL see an incredible array of shops, malls, hotels, restaurants and bars representative of the best global and local brands - all jammed together. No matter what you're looking for - high end merchandise and cuisine to good deals on cheap souvenirs and indigenous eats - it's all here on Orchard Road. Explore each side of the road (and cross legally!) to take it all in.
But leave some time to venture out a bit further as well ... Boat Quay, Sentosa and the Zoo/Night Safari are just a few other ""must see"" areas of Singapore."
,,Good place for shopping,4.0,,A street with all high end stuffs but there are budget shops at places like the Lucky plaza and Far East plaza. There are places for the youth- Cineleisure and Scape.

,,High Fly uptown road,5.0,,"Big malls and high rises with interspersed with traffic. Bright and shiny in the night, especially decorated during christmas and new year!!! The view is awesome and out of the world experience. Malls have premium brands and there are other small shops nearby to buy trinkets, souveniers etc. Just nice to have a walk around in the evening with hustle and bustle of city life, but not tiring that much!! Some of the malls have great food joints on the rooftop, offering world cuisine such as chinese, japanese, american, continental etc."
,,always good for a walk and people watching,5.0,,"great place to wander, it can be a good challenge to see how long you can walk inside without needing to come outside to switch malls.

,,Amazing amount of shops,4.0,,"We went here on our last day in Singapore. Decided to take the MRT to one and start to walk back.

The malls are huge, multi level and have very similar shops. Several times I checked the iphone compass app to make sure we were going in the right direction.

If you love shopping (or window shopping) this is the place for you."
,,Busy Busy Busy!,4.0,,"A fascinating shopping paradise alive with a multitudde of people shopping, eating,drinking and enjoying themselves it is at its quietest before 10am and comes alive as the day turns into night. Orchard Road is the ultimate shopping experience in Singapore and needs to be experienced to be appreciated."
,,Its frantic,4.0,,Allocate a couple of hours for here. It gets exstemely busy at night time thats when it especialy comes to life. Great spots to have some really nice food and the shopping is great. Watch out for pick pockets
,,Shopping Mecca if you have the wealth,3.0,,This is a nice street to stroll down except for the annoying Ion underground walk way. Unfortunately everything in these stores is beyond the reach of most people.
,,Shopping!,5.0,,One word: Shopping (and lots of food too!) Plenty to keep you busy for a couple of days and close to many tour start points.
,,A must visit,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore Orchard road is a must visit. A huge range of shops and malls. Plenty of places to eat and drink also. Its busy ..sometimes crazy busy, but this adds to the experience."
,,Orchard ION Shopping & Food,5.0,,"Orchard is such a long stretch so I shall focus on ION only for this review. ION is an upmarket place but also housed with mid-tier shops. The building is sort of divided into 2 wings with the high sreet brands of AX, Zara, Topshop, H&M etc on one part to the more exclusive luxury brands outlets from well-know fashion icons like LVMH, Prada, Gucci, D&G etc in another wing. One can find the latest fashion apparels if you are into shopping.

For the gastronomical, there are a range of affordable food outlets and a food mall at the basement. It has chinese like wantan noodles, famous singapore chicken rice, HK-styled roast meats, muslim food, western and japanese. There are very few high-end restaurants at ION except for a couple of established chinese restaurants like Imperial Treasures but no western fine-dining ones. I would advise to try the food court food as it is one of the largest in town imo and has a good range of local food variety at reasonable prices. The roast meats stall is popular as well as the chicken rice. Do visit more than one time to sample the full range of singapore food here in a nicely air-con, yet not overly-cramped foodcourt compared to other places. I visit the place every other week and never get tired of the food because of the wide variety of choices available. I do like the muslim nasi padang and the nasi bryani very much. As the foodcourt is spacious, one can take you time to savour your food without feeling that you need to rush. So I always enjoy eating there and watching the well-dressed hip people goes by too.

Btw, there are also many luxury watch boutiques here, from the PP, AP, IWC, Omega, Panerai to the authorised dealers. I find it a joy to look at the latest timepieces though they are not always affordable to the masses. But no harm browsing and just enjoy the beauty and character of each watch boutique.

The building is pretty big so take your time if shopping and eating of free and easy nature is in you. I have friends who say there is nothing here but that is because shopping is not their cup of tea and maybe they are too tense working in singapore. I always enjoy dropping by, watching the people and find good food.

Hope to see you there this weekend..........."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"This is the place to shop when in Singapore, all the brands you want is located in that area, both budget and luxury shopping."
,,Lots of shops,4.0,,All kind of shops from high end to where the locals go. Don't be afraid to turn off orchard rd to find more interesting shopping. Mrt handy and bus to get to and from. Nice clean and safe city.
,,Good for tourist,4.0,,Its nice to shop around at there when you are a tourist. Some of the shops provide the tax refund service by issuing you the receipt with notes on it so you can request the tax refund easily at changi airport with your boarding pass of flight. Its quite handy but hope this service can be carry out to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal and Harbour Front Ferry Terminal as well by providing the boarding pass
,,Just Okay,3.0,,"It is just a shopping street, nothing much more. If you like to shop it is a great place to visit. If you do not like to shop then Singapore has much more to offer, so enjoy."

,,Kul,3.0,,"Shopping Street!!! If you are not shopping holic, just take your camera and enjoy your days with window dressing in each department store. There are many good photos taking lacations here. Food Court in ION Orchard is reasonable price :)"
,,If you fancy shopping .....,4.0,,"Been to Orchard road first time in 1982 and several times thereafter. Never amazes me the physical changes going on all the time, with very few original shopping complexes left like Tangs & Lucky Plaza. Still plenty of choice and quite liked Plaza Singapura with the food stalls.
Went to IonOrchard viewing gallery but it was closed for a private function - a pity as the weather was clear."
,,Easy to get lost,5.0,,"We stayed near Orchard Road and it's always very busy on the street. But, once you venture off into a store it's easy to get lost as there are so many levels and exit points. All the high end stores are there but there are other regular stores in amongst them you just have to find them. Beautiful at nigh with all the lights."
,,Shop till you drop,3.0,,"Orchard Road is of course iconic and a great place to shop. Especially if you can afford Rolex, Hugo Boss, Louis Vitton etc etc. We stayed in the Jen Orchard Gateway Hotel so could not avoid walking and taxiing down it several times during our stay. There are shopping Malls you get lost in. Mental."
,,Premier Shopping street,4.0,,"A really great shopping street with malls, high end stores and very good hotels. Also a vast range on restaurants from fast food to fine dining."
,,Same old same old,2.0,,Orchard Road is famous for shopping. Well it could be if you had a high end credit card. The prices here are higher than in Australia. That is saying something. Window shopping was not even that enjoyable as the shops and their wears are the same as every other major city in the world. It was a disappointment.
,,Average,3.0,,"Stunning shops with stunning prices and terrible facilities. There is no flow to how shops are set out, no real guides. No one in shops smiling, like they hate their job"
,,Indonesia clean version,4.0,,"If u go to Singapore, Orchard road is like Indonesian road.. Because many people said if u go to here at weekend there's so many Indonesian Worker who work in Singapore.. and it's totally right...But there's so many promo things to bought here"
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"This really is the classy end if an already classy city state. Orchard Road was impressive 30 years ago. It has, inevitably, lost some if the magic. But it us well worth a visit."
,,A bit confusing,4.0,,"Large street, full of malls and cafes and the odd roadside food kiosk. Great for retail therapy (high street brands and designer brands).

Souvenirs can be gotten from elsewhere (particularly Chinatown) much cheaper.

The layout of most if The malls is very different from western malls. They seem to not prefer a circular layout here, so navigating malls will be a challenge oftentimes."
,,Just upscale shopping,4.0,,Upscale shopping. Worth it if that's what you want. Tons of stores and a very pleasant environment. Clean and safe
,,What can I say? It's a shopping street,3.0,,"There are shops on it - quite a lot, including some expensive ones. You can access it from the Orchard Road MRT."

,,A great shopping experience,4.0,,Orchard Road was a great place to experience the different brand named shops. Very pretty at night and the way the shops are open into the later evening hours was interesting and took pressure of the hurry in the early evening.
,,Nice shopping place,4.0,,Place with all the brands and filled with shooing areas. Best for branded shopping. Try the Ion and Paragon mall.
,,Luxury at it's best,5.0,,"Shopper's galore if you want high end, think Versace, Gucci etc... And also for the not so high end, H & M, Zara etc... Heaps to eat. The eating places are mainly down the bottom levels of the shopping centres and plazas or the top of them. Not a lot of shop-front eating places. Heaps and heaps of variety to eat. Great to people watch too. Easy to get train to and hop-on hop-on buses go through there."
,,Singapore shopping place,5.0,,"This place is full of energy with many shops, hotels, restaurant, bars mixing modernity and tradition. It is a place where you can walk and feel Singapore life with the incredible diversity of its population"
,,Always clean and something new,5.0,,"Orchard Road has always been clean with very wide path for shoppers and pedestrians - trees lining up the boulevard added up to the beauty of this place apart from the many shopping centres. Every time I visit, it seems there's something new."
,,"""Shopper's paradise'",5.0,,"We were amazed by the amount of shopping malls catering for the high end shopper as well as the budget minded shopper, as well as the endless eateries catering for every palate."

,,Just another shopping centre,3.0,,"Went on a very hot day, the place seemed like a concrete jungle with lots of very expensive shops. Bit like Marine Bay but without air con. Apologies if it has more to offer."
,,Great if you want to shop rather than take in historic or cultural attractions.,3.0,,"I would say this is more of a shopping destination rather than 'an attraction' as it is mainly just a long street lined shops and Malls (including Ngee Ann City, Lucky Plaza, ION Orchard, and the Gallery at the Hilton). There are plenty of places to eat and also off of Orchard Road is the lovely Emerald Hill Road, which is certainly worth a walk along."
,,Shopping Area,4.0,,This is the place to go if you want a stretch of street filled with shopping malls. A great place to visit during the Christmas season as the whole street will be decorated with dazzling lightings.

,,AVERAGE,3.0,,"Many and many place for shopping and eat.
Everytime you look around is only mall, mall and mall again.

But not match for me, because i just coming here only for sightseeing :)"

,,Shopping,5.0,,Nice place to shop shopping malls are all big foods is everywhere but very crowded on Sunday signatures are everywhere
,,Shopping heaven for those into it,3.0,,"More retail space than you can imagine. Many high end retailers. Amazing how cool you can stay in the Singapore hot, humid weather when walking down Orchard Road and all the A/C blows out the doors as you walk past. A visit to Singapore would not be complete without a visit to Orchard Road."
,,Busy street,4.0,,"Its a very busy wide street, clean & tidy. What is noticeable is there are not many pedestrians on the street as the underground train corridors extend a fair way further underground between all the shopping centres than they used to. Its great when its hot & sticky outside not having to venture out to continue shopping."
,,Haven for shoppers,5.0,,"Our hotel is situated in Orchard Street. All the department stores are walking dstance from our hotel and from each other. The dept stores like Takashimaya are huge .
Basement levels are food stalls galore, filled with foodies. Had a hard time picking out food to taste because there were so many choices.
The shops in the upper levels are high end stores with some local popular Singaporean brands. Shops are lovely even for window shopping.
There are numerous similar dept stores in the area I did not have time to look at."
,,SINGAPORE SHOPPING,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore, strolling, or pacing up Orchard street is a must! You'll find pretty much everything you were looking for amongst the abundance of shops and shopping centres that you will walk past and theres also a great variety of restaurants and salons / spas too :)."

,,So much to see,5.0,,Lots to see and discover. There is an entirely different life below the roads. Excellent eateries and shopping options.
,,An Old Landmark Resting on Her Lurals,4.0,,"Years ago, Orchard Roar was the shopping centre in the city state. It was a Singapore icon. With many stores, shopping-centres and malls, large and small, it was the destination. The importance of this street has come down with the development of shopping and recreation facilities in several places in the city. The stores like Lucky Plaza, Takashimaya and C K Chang still remain there, and are huge attractions. You will find expensive brands in exclusive outlets and inexpensive merchandise in the not-so-expensive stores.

Pedestrian walk-ways are broad and well-paved. Though crowded, it is pleasant to stroll and to gaze at the windows. You might even get a chance to taste some street-food.

Reaching Orchard Road is easy. It is well-connected to almost any area in Singapore, by local suburban train and bus. Taxis are available freely to and from the road."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"This is the most impressive avenue for shopping in the world. You can find everything you want at pretty any time, and irrespective of the price for sure. Enjoy."
,,The longest shopping street in Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Street is Singapore's equivalent of Oxford Street or Melrose. It is well served by metro, bus or car access with numerous carparks below ground. There is a mind boggling number of shopping malls with goods at al price ranges from International Designer brands to budget shopping. There are literally hundreds of cafes and restaurants for refreshment and food."
,,Shopping galore,4.0,,Orchard Road is full of shops - mainly high end - but a huge variety including loads of eateries. Shopping centres are air-conditioned which is a nice relief from the tropical weather. You can spend hours walking up and down Orchard Road - sometimes going underground as there are some busy streets where pedestrians are unable to directly cross. Orchard Road is certainly the place for shopaholics!
,,Shopping District,4.0,,The area and the main Orchard road is lined with shops and is a shoppers paradise. You can see huge crowds here in the evenings.
,,Best Quality Shopping,5.0,,Orchard road provides with Branded shops. Quality product with high price. Recommend to visit Orchard road if you are in Singapore.
,,"Full of Shopping, eating",4.0,,"I think Orchard road is one of the most busiest road in Singapore. Plenty of shopping malls. Hotels, restaurants are here.

,,always full of atmosphere,4.0,,busy shopping strip with all kinds of stores and something for everyone. lots of people from all over the world.
,,Food and shopping.,5.0,,I believe it is the world's premier shopping area. It is a bit expensive but then we are on holidays and paying for quality and not quantity. There are plenty of food outlets and restaurants catering for all types of humans.

,,Nice Place,3.0,,I like when the night comes. I saw a lot of light around this area. Very nice to hang out or just walking around with friends or family.
,,not sure what i was expecting,3.0,,"rodeo blvd of singapore? it has all the stores you can think of, but i'm not a big shopper so i didnt go into any of the stores. really because i didnt have any more space in my luggage, i knew i couldnt shop. but i do wish i was able to see what all these stores offered. but the vibe is great. i really enjoyed seeing people and just taking in what the city has to offer."
,,Superb for Shopping!,5.0,,"Numerous high end shopping Malls on a wide boulevard which has to b seen at least once. Orchrd road also has many indigenous stores and independent traders and you can probably find anything your heart desires. This being said, prices in Singapore are very high and you can get any item you see much cheaper, maybe as much as 30% cheaper at home or in other countries."
,,Mall district?,3.0,,"Again, just another place to shop. Nothing new. Nothing special. I could shop anywhere in SG. Didnt see anything different."
,,Shopping spots,5.0,,You can choose where do you want to shop on this road from the expensive to cheap goods. You also must try the $1.20 ice cream.
,,Shopping Paradise!!!,4.0,,"Must visit place in Singapore if you are looking for some nice shopping. You will find all top brands available here. All brands have their stores setup on this road for sure. There are a number of malls as well which will cater not only for shopping but have good food options as well.

,,"OK, If You Like Shopping For Designer Stuff At Top Prices",3.0,,"I must admit I am not a committed shopper. I did go up and down Orchard Road twice and was not enthralled. I found interesting the well-designed walkways, under- and over-passes, lighting and access to public transport."
,,Great up market shopping! But NOT cheap,3.0,,Great to see the main shopping area of Singapore. Not cheap at all! Lovely greenery in Street and orchids etc.
,,Great place if you are Rich,4.0,,"This is one of most porch area in Singapore. You will get all kind of branded items from here. There are so many shopping malls you will get whatever you want. But I dont prefer this place when we have good and cheap shopping options like Little India and Musthafa.,"
,,"Everything you could want, but at prices you may not enjoy",3.0,,"The obvious comparisons to rodeo drive or 5th avenue don't quite give the breath or depth of the variety of stores which you can sample here, nor the number. There are multiple locations of the same designer or brand, some of which are barely known in the states. For example the are two locations for issey miyake and one for his bao bao brand, even a BAPE location at each end. If shop to you drop is your style, and you credit has no limit, orchard road is for you."
,,You can´t avoid going there!,4.0,,Orchard Road is mainly an avenue for shopping (limited only by your credit card limit). You should have walked on it! As a visitor/tourist you will probably join the SVC Orchard (Singapore Visitor Center @ Orchard) to buy a ticket for HiPPO Tours and/or Night Safari or ask for advice to your open questions.
,,If you've got the money this is a shopper's paradise,4.0,,Orchard Road gives you another area of Singapore to discover - well there's nothing much to discover other than major luxury shops and department stores. If that's what you're interested in you'll be very happy. There is one street that has a row of terraced houses that were built at the beginning of the 20th century. Some of them are very beautiful but that's the only bit of culture around Orchard Road.
,,"Try it, you'll love it",4.0,,We'd heard of Orchard Road before we left home. Allow lots of time to explore everything from up-market shopping to a multi-level indoor market crammed with everything one can imagine.
,,Shopping Haven!,5.0,,You'll find all you need on this road. A long stretch of shopping malls (of all levels) from gadgets to clothing and branded items. Our fav is Takashimaya! Find anything you need here. Lotsa nice hotels too.
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,A shopping street with many up-scale department stores. Along the way are many underground food courts with a mix of local foods. This road leads to some great tailors on one end and on the other end is a very close walk to the botanic gardens.
,,wow wow wow,5.0,,"one of the biggest shopping area in Singapore,what u want,everything can get here,from local to branded item can find in orchard"
,,perfect place for shophaholic,4.0,,"Spoils with shopping arcade, it is the right place for sophaholic to shop till drop yet window shopping is okay. For moslem traveler, it is the right place to find halal food as well."
,,"Fashion, Fashion, Fashion",3.0,,"What a fantastic collection of shops - can't think of any top brands that were not represented. Each time we went past it seemed to be very busy, it is a must-see part of Singapore to visit.

Very expensive, in our case it was ""look but do not touch or ask the price!"" Singapore certainly lives up to its name as the most expensive city in the world on Orchard Street.

Enjoyed our visit as there are some very nice buildings etc. ti see, and it is a good, wide street to walk along and people watch!"
,,YIPPY SHOPPING,5.0,,Day 1 to Day 7 we spent at least an hour on Orchard rd spending money the malls are fantastic and so many shops
,,Best Shopping Street,5.0,,"Still one of our most favourite shopping road in Singapore with a long stretch of malls on either side.

Best time to come of course it's during Christmas time where there's lots of awesome display of creative decorations and lighting.

Perfect tropical weather thruout except during the monsoon season between October to March with sudden thunderstorm or quick rain shower.

Otherwise it's a nice stroll through and shop till you drop!

Housing all the top fashion labels in various malls, this has been the centre of attraction in Singapore for shopping for decades and worth visiting."
,,What a change,3.0,,"Over the forty or so years I have visited Singapore, Orchard Road has changed from a place with prices attractive to tourists to an area heavily saturated with very high end brands. Many of the malls contain wonderful, but expensive, goods, and, interestingly we did not see many shoppers in those places. The Road is still fascinating and worth a visit. Lower prices are available and stores still have their sales, which can provide discounts up to 70%."
,,Just another shopping street,3.0,,"Boring, once you have seen it that's it. Unless you like to pay too much for the same things you can get cheaper online, walk it once."
,,All shopping in one place,4.0,,"All your shopping can be done on Orchard Road, it has both the budget and high end shopping outlets. It is best to research on the outlets during the seasonal sale time to find bargains and fun shopping experience along with enough and more dinning options for the foodie."
,,Shopping on steroids,4.0,,"Miles of high end shopping with lots of cafes, restaurants and coffee bars to break up the journey. Singapore is madly expensive but its worth a walk down Orchard Road to take in the shops. I am sure if my wife was reviewing it would get a five star rating."
,,Some lovely shops!,4.0,,Orchard Rd and Orchard gateway is excellent for shoppers. The down side is that pound is weak at the moment making the exchange rate quite low so shopping appeared a little more expensive.
,,The place to go,5.0,,I stayed on orchard road and it was perfect. Walk out of my hotel and the options are endless - both in shopping (which is the whole point right?) and food. If you want to spend a few days solid shopping then this is definitely the place to go! Everyone is super friendly and helpful as well which is great.

However if you really want to buy new branded clothes and apparels to add to your new wardrobe, i would highly recommend this place."
,,The best shopping area in Singapore.,5.0,,"Everything under the sun, and then some. Restaurants and shopping enough to fill a few days. A little higher priced than the outlying areas, but well worth the time. We stayed at the Royal Plaza on Scott's, just off Orchard road."
,,Gucci Pucci Confusion,3.0,,"If you're a designer brand shopper or you're from Mainland China, this is your mecca - every designer is here - repeatedly. You feel like you're in NYC.

Orchard road whether for shopping or city walk or restaurants have tons of options.
My this review I will cover our shopping experience.
Loved shopping at Takashimaya department store.
Convenient shopping with helpful staff truly was a pleasure so much so I will go again today.
Robinson store further down we picked up lots of household stuff like Crockery deals to towels and bedsheets.
Absolutely understanding and service oriented. We asked the Manager if they could deliver to our hotel as we shall go and do other shopping as well; after checking and twisting some of their rules (originally not willing to supply to the hotel) they agreed.
We too in the spirit of shopping stretched from about 6/700 dollars spend originally to wooping 3k plus spending. Just freaked out without realizing that we are from Dubai another shopping heaven!!
Also the road is well connected both internally and externally.
Only bit of difficulty we faced was in getting Vegetarian Food in malls' Food Courts. There would not be any. However their in-mall restaurants do cater some select range. If you are good with that fine.
We enjoyed and I hope you too will."
,,Lively place,4.0,,Orchard Road is quite lively place. Nice walk and buildings and roads with lights. There are branded shops in buildings and for cheaper goods go to Lucky Plaza. Lot of Philipinos around. Nice place
,,Shopping area,5.0,,"Well worth a visit, mostly high end shops, every brand name is available, main shopping area in Singapore. Even if not buying well worth a visit"
,,"Review of Orchard Road, Singapore",5.0,,"As a Singaporean, I would say that Orchard Road at Singapore is THE place to be. May it be a whole day of shopping, people watching, gawking or just stoning...! There's a long stretch of Orchard Road,with large shopping malls, eateries, cinemas, wide walking spaces. This place is easily accessible from one end to the other end, with a safe underground crossing, and cheap transport along the way, if you wish to take a short ride in the local bus. Though Orchard Road is not the cheapest place to shop in Singapore, the hundreds of different brands of items, varieties, that one can have as great options or choices.
Besides being a shoppers' paradise, Orchard Road has a vibrant, cosmopolitan presence. This is the place where you can also catch a on-the-spot live show on the street. It could be a live juggling act, a solo musician doing a live keyboard or guitar gig on the street, or a cheeky clown doing his 'thing' to the amusement of lunchtime crowds. For the not so spritely, there are benches for short walking rests along the long stretch of Orchard Road. At the end of Orchard Road, towards Holland Road, is where one locate the Singapore Botanical Gardens.....another place that one should not miss visiting. And towards the opposite end is the Bras Basah area, also another exciting place not to be missed.
If shopping is not your in your do list, then simply flit around to watch your favourite films in the absolutely clean cinemas, with superb surround sound systems to match.
There are also tons of varieties of eats to choose from, fine-dining, simple hawker foods, street foods in the shopping malls, with hygenic and clean environments. Take your pick of local, French, Italian, Indian, German food varieties, and you will surely be astonish with all the hundred of options you can hope to find."

,,Leisure walk and Shopping,5.0,,A great place to around and through. The weather in Singapore can be hot and humid but there are air-condition malls all around. Plenty of shopping areas for branded stuff.
,,Interesting and frustrating,3.0,,Lots of overpriced shops here. The best places are underground. Trying to cross the road using the MRT access and navigating the multi level shopping malls to come out where you want to be can be frustrating and ridiculously time consuming. Hamleys toy shop is there tho (near Dhoby Gaut station)!
,,Great street,3.0,,Loved staying close to this street but it is very expensive shopping. Heaps of places to eat very clean and felt very safe walking around late at night

,,So much shopping,5.0,,"Stayed for the weekend and enjoyed the endless shopping on orchard road, together with all the great coffee shops and restaurants. Look forward to getting lost underground there again."
,,Way overrated!,2.0,,"Can't figure out why all the hype. Every mall is about the same with the same sets of stores, and it doesn't matter what time of the day you go there, it's always crowded. You're probably better off going to visit sites that are more uniquely Singapore rather than here."
,,"Gr at shopping, safe, tidy, good food",5.0,,"If you come to Singapore and want to see shops, eat or just walk around, Orchard road is a good destination. If shopping is not your thing or you don't like shopping malls, then don't bother."

,,Orchard road,5.0,,"Nice place ...for walking, shoping and cullinary trip around the city. Good view and a lot of beautiful place on this street."
,,Shop til you drop!,5.0,,"Shop until you drop! Go hard or go home! These are too smart phrases that you should be ready for before venturing on shopping spree on Orchard Road. Shopping could easily take you a good 2 to 3 days in order to cover all the stores in this shopping district.

I took great advice from one of the locals here; she told me to walk past the Orchard Street MRT station to the Somerset station, and use that as my starting point. From there, I was advised to make my way Pat Orchard Road. In this regard, I would cover the entire area. This was easier said than done however. It would be OK if there were just one shopping mall or one shopping center. Here, in order to cover everything you would need to not only cover all of the stores on Orchard Road, but also all of the stores on the multilevel malls live in ION, WISM ATRIA, Orchard Gateway Shopping Center (closer to Somerset MRT), Robinsons, TANG's, Lucky Plaza, etc. This doesn't even include all the ""tourist"" souvenir shops like do your dinos and Rong Lee Da - The Gift Shop.

My favorite was ION. I just love the energy and the fact that there are stores to fit many budgets. Then again, what's a budget when you're in a shopping mecca like Orchard Road!"
,,High End Shops Only,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a must see for anyone, but don't expect to buy too much unless you are into the high end shopping. This street is all about labels and brands and you won't find any normal kinds of shops (groceries, pharmacies, budget stores etc)."

,,SIngapore's premier shopping destination!,4.0,,"If youw ant to get a feel of shopping in SIngapore's malls, hie off to Orchard Road where you will find a range of shopping destinations, from high-end shops in Takashimaya and Ion to affordable ones in Lucky PLaza. Enjoy broqwsing st stores and feast on the many restaurants that line this long road. Sit on the sidewalk and people-watch while sipping a refreshing drink or taking a cigarette break. If you are lucky, you will chance upon musicians and other performers doing their thing and you will be entertained. Just avoid doing all these on a Sunday as the sidewalks get really crowded and the malls, too."

Lots of restaurant in Orchard too but prices are more expensive compared to other areas in Singapore."
,,"Nothing special, just mall after mall",1.0,,"If your lifelong dream is a closet overflowing with rags and a different purse for everyday of the week... this is your place. It's mall after mall filled mostly with all the same stores you would see at any mall in the US or Europe. Nothing very Singaporean, other watching the locals max out their credit cards, just like some of us do at home.

Europeans maybe able to save a few bucks shopping here, but for US based shoppers... It's cheaper at home. Tip: Put the credit card in the penalty box."
,,Shopping!,5.0,,"Massive shopping street :). Avoid or enjoy, depending on what you are after! Very lively area. On the way from the center towards botanical gardens, maybe worth a stop."

,,Historic road - great (and tiring) walk,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of those hypnotic main streets that you have to exhaust yourself in at least once in your life. I understand its about two miles long. We walked the lot - and had to get an underground back. But it was well worth it. The buildings here are stunning, the streets are clean and filled with lovely smiling people, and tourists get such a great welcome. When you get too hot or tired there are a zillion places to go to cool off or eat and drink at and the senses are always stimulated by what to smell, what you see and what you feel. I love the place and love the walk, despite a damaged knee! The pain is worth it. BTW.. you can go downstairs in just about any of the buildings and find a new network of underground passages connecting buildings, rail stations and facilities."
,,Love Orchard Road!,5.0,,"Great shopping, lots of the fashion shops close together. I based myself in Somerset/Orchard Central and didn't get much further! I was only in Singapore overnight and needed to buy new work clothes. Orchard Road did not disappoint! We also went to dinner on Cuppage Terrace and had a delicious meal."

,,Fancy street with luxury brands,4.0,,Many luxury fashion brands can be found there. The street has many great malls that one day might not enough for a shopaholic. You should go there during sales season with many interesting discount items and better should not go with boyfriend beacause he will complain of walking to much and waiting you so long. Highly recommend to visit Takashimaya shopping mall in this place.
,,Great Shopping Area and place to People Watch,4.0,,"Orchard Road is known for its shopping, with stores ranging from Gucci to the little knick-knack shops (and the occasional condom shop close by). But there's more to Orchard Road than just shopping; You can find a spot in the shade and watch people go by all dressed up either going to work or to the next high-end retailer. There are also plenty of coffee shops and restaurants if you want to sit inside where it's cool. A real plus are the MRT (metro) stops at either end of the wide street make it easy to get to and from the area."
,,More affordable than told,4.0,,"Visited during Lunar Festival, everywhere was beautifully decorated. On Orchard Road, the decorations were a bit more elaborate. As for the shops, I thought I was only going to window shop because of its reputation of designer shopping but I was pleasantly surprised by the numerous centers that cater for the average shoppers. It was lovely. Also plenty of nice places of eat too."
,,Big shopping hub but generally big prices,3.0,,"Spent a few days around this area at a number of the shopping centers on Orchard road. Most of the shopping would be categorised as high priced luxury - not much for the bargain hunter looking for affordable quality. Places like Kuala Lumpar are a more affordable option to visit. Many of the shopping centers have a confusing layout and limited signage as where you are and what is available.

Food is almost extensively Asian, not as many Western outlets"

,,Depends of the kind of shopper you are.,3.0,,"There are many shops here, many are big brand and you need deep pockets. There are also many cafes and restaurants on this stretch. This is a very touristy strip for shopping. If you are looking for budget and average priced shopping head out to the heartlands."
,,Busy High End Shopping District,3.0,,"There are few large malls alone the Orchard Road. It feel like a maze after you enter the mail, I feel I can never get out, coz they seem to connect one to the other. It is also one of the major area for shopping and restaurant for the locals after work."

As H& M. It's fun to walk down the road and window shop and dream, even if you can't afford the hens and jewels that are offered!"
,,Meh,3.0,,What can I say? It's just a road with cafes and a mall or two. Can see that anywhere...I couldn't see anything special about it. The Hilton is here. Hooray.
,,Mostly top end shops,3.0,,"The shopping in Orchard road is mostly high end fashion. Lucky Plaza seems to have been taken over by the local Philippine workers. We were there on a Sunday and that must be the day off for most, so the place was packed."
,,Dare to Dream!,4.0,,"Lots of wonderful shops on this long stretch of road. A lot of money needed to purchase anything, but just looking at everything was fun. I loved getting ideas for my own sewing and decorating, which I'll enjoy when I return home. A bit tiring on a hot day!"

You can walk the whole road on both sides that you will find thousands of stores."
,,There cannot be enough said,5.0,,"Orchard road, year end deals, perfect weather, lots of choices for eating and drinking, nuf said, and that it aint enough either!"
,,A really big mall,3.0,,Essentially the entire road is one big mall. This would be cool except all the stores are brands that are in malls around the world. Do we really need another Sephora?
,,As a tourist you can do some shopping here.,4.0,,"There much to explore here, but this place is also among the most expensive. Choosing a restaurant you would enjoy may be tricky. Avoid dumplings here those are the most disappointing. Thai Chicken may give you good taste but may give you a bad tummy."
,,Orchard Road 2017,4.0,,Nice to see the same designer labels in every Mall on Orchard Road ....Incredible place exciting and expensive .... no need to complain because thats why it's there .....
,,Shopping mecca,4.0,,"So much has been said about Orchard Road as a shopping district that all I can really say is - its all true. If you want to shop then there is nowhere else in Singapore that can compete. Lots of fun, good options, despite being crowded there is no 'crush' feeling."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is THE road if you are a shopaholic. Set right in the heart of Singapore, the road is full of Shopping Malls, all of which have Food Halls where every type of fast food is available."
,,If you're a millionaire perfect!,3.0,,This street is lined with all designer brands and you won't just find one shop of each brand but numerous within a few feet of each other! There are your less pricier brands either in the malls itself or further down orchard road. Food is also easily accessible in the 55 malls that the road has (okay not 55 but there was at least 6-7 malls all side by side). Halal food was a bit of a struggle as only few places have a certificate. However a local told us all chicken/beef is halal but if the restaurant serves alcohol or pork the government does not issue a certificate but rest assured you won't starve..... unless it's after 10:30 because pretty much everything is closed after this time!
,,Over commercialised,3.0,,"We've been to Singapore twice before and stayed once near Dhobi Gaut and once near Newton Circus so spent a fair amount of time on Orchard Road. This time we stayed in Chinatown and walked back along Orchard Road after our visit to the Botanic Gardens. It seems very glossy and expensive and full of tourists. We were glad to retreat to Chinatown (which is also touristy but equally full of locals). I think unless you desperately want to shop, shop, shop there is nothing else of interest on Orchard Road."
,,Busiest shopping district in Singapore.,4.0,,"Many shopping centers to visit with top ends shops. At night time, the street is known for good bars as well."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise. Huge designer outlets, everything from Rolex watches to Gucci bags. Lots of places for food and drink. Crowds of people. An interesting walk"

,,Something to See,4.0,,"If you come to SIN, you need to take at least some time out to walk down Orchard Road -- the number of malls is astounding. Many people walking, but not many people buying, which I thought was interesting. It is a sight to be seen - at night they often have bands on the sidewalks."
,,Shopaholic road,4.0,,"For those who are very fun of buying and shopping, just visit this road and you'll be delighted that you're walking on big buildings of brands."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,This is a great place for window shopping if you are an ordinary traveller - but be ware!! Its very far - you can end up walking about 15kms up and down the road. Would suggest stopping at The Paragon food centre for great lunches and dinners.
,,Best,5.0,,I think its the Worlds best shopping street. You can shop in all the worlds biggest brands and amazing to be here.
,,Shoppers Paradise!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one continual stretch of glamour, colour and wonderful atmosphere. The high rise buildings just seem to keep on going up, but there is history hidden away in the corners. You must visit Emerald Hill Road to see the restored Chinese Shop Houses, extremely well renovated."
,,Makes you a Shopaholic!,5.0,,"Shopping was never so easy. From the top-notch brands to new-trend everything you'll get here. This long walk is good for Shopping Malls, Restaurants, Movies what else..Mainly everything."

,,Honeymoon shopping,5.0,,"Orchard road shopping district is a must visit if you're in Singapore.

Hubby and I spent many hours getting wonderfully lost through the many adjoining shopping centres.

Here you will find fantastic food, luxury shopping, all in wonderful air conditioning!!!! Which in the 30 degree heat and the humidity is fantastic.

100% will visit again next time we head to Singapore."
,,Where we shop,4.0,,"Orchard road caters the different stores. It is like the Makati or BGC here in the Philippines. They have shops like Paragon, Takashimaya, The Cathay, Lucky plaze and etc. If you want to shop for souvenirs go to Lucky plaza. They have cheap souvenis like Mobile phone cases for 10 for $10, keychains 5 for $10 and Tshirts 4 for $10. But if you want to shop for Mobile phone screen protectors and fashionable cases go the Cineleisure Shop."

,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"If you like to shop and eat, good place to fulfill that desire. Good hotels are located in the area for your consideration."
,,Shops Galore!,4.0,,"There is every type of shop above and under ground here. If the day is hot or rainy, no problem, there is under street walking and hundreds of shops. Every designer shop is here but the place I found most interesting and unique were the small box shaped stores with 3-4 levels of inexpensive clothing, nail service, manicures, hair cuts, tailors and food in the same relatively small space. While one person was eating the other two were getting hair cuts and manicures while I shopped for inexpensive clothing rights across the hall where I could keep an eye on everyone. This street has any brand of clothing, shoes and accessories at any price you could possibly want."
,,Shopping Heavn,5.0,,Shopping!! There are so many good clothing shops around. I spent sometimes in ION building and the underground shops. Love it.
,,Posh! Amazing Cars! Brands! Super Expensive! Beautiful!,5.0,,"Its one of the most Posh areas of Singapore. Its similar to Times Square of New York. Big TV screens with Ads, videos etc etc. You can see many posh cars parked/running on streets. Super expensive malls/brands. Posh looking people. Clean streets. Many foods and bar places (Posh). Nice greenary. Its best to visit at night time or evening. Most of the big hotels like fullerton, sheraton, good wood are near this place."
,,Great shopping but caveat emptor,4.0,,"There is great shopping along Orchard Road. Its probably better to stick to the shopping malls as the smaller shops (cameras, computers, etc.) can mark up their prices 2 or even 3 times other shops whilst offering you old and/or outdated products, i.e. cameras, computers, etc. For electronics, one would be better off going to Sim Lim Square, shopping mall, but once again, better to double check with 3 or 4 shops before buying."
,,Shopping til you drop,4.0,,Orchard Road is a must see if you visit Singapore. I can't say for sure but I cannot think of one famous brand/marque that isn't found on Orchard Road. Take plenty of money and be prepared for the crowds.
,,Shop Till You Drop,5.0,,Orchard Road has all the shopping choices any shopper could comprehend. Luxury brand goods to less expensive. IN the heat of the day its so refreshing to move into one of the numerous shopping plazas to see goods from around thye globe
,,Shops Haven,4.0,,"Mile long shopping mall for the well heeled and loaded. Still a great place to spend the afternoon, window shopping or meeting up with friends over tea."
,,Shopping Avenue,3.0,,"If you love shopping brand name stuff, it's good place to stop by. There is a mall that sell cheap products but it's not interesting to me. Nothing much to do except shopping, eating and relaxing."
,,Must go place in Singapore to Shop.,5.0,,"You can't go to Singapore without visiting the Iconic Orchard Road shopping street. Heaps of shops all down the street providing welcome respite from the out so just duck in and out of the airconditioning to recover while you walk.
My favourite places are, of course, the ION buiding a one stop mall if you don't want to walk in the heat. 7 or is it 8 floors of shopping, beware the first time I went in there I got lost and couldn't find my way out, I thought I might be in there forever.
Also you can access the other side of the road via underground walkways without having to go back outside. And also the MRT runs under there too.
Tangs is another hugh shopping treat right across the road from the ION or on the other corner Marks and Spencers if that's your go. A few blocks down is another large Department store that I love ""Robinsons"".
Also there a some nice gardens down orchard road and you can take in the Singapore Embassy as well although it is guarded day and night and of course you can't go in but you can take a picture."
,,Typical High-End Shopping District,3.0,,My father and I explored Orchard Road while visiting Singapore and it was interesting to say the least. We are not much into high-end shopping so I would imagine it would be quite a treat for those who do. It was cool to window shop and walk around though! We spent about an hour and a half walking from one end to the other and checking out all the shops. I work for Abercrombie & Fitch so it was also great to check out their Singapore location and compare it to my store back home. So different!
,,Lots of shopping!!,5.0,,"A great place to eat and shop. Easy to get to and worth a visit if in Singapore. Close to those central spots such as China town and Marina Bay Sands, Raffles etc. lots of bargains and lots to see."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,Orchard Road is one of the main shopping areas of Singapore and is surrounded with luxury hotels and top end shops. You can buy any branded products here although there are cheaper places in Singapore to buy presents gifts etc. The area is well served by public transport but most people can just walk from their hotel to all the malls in the locality.

,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Orchard road is good for all ages. However if you love shopping, this is definitely for you. The road is full of shopping malls on both sides of the road with some hotels as well.

You can easily spend the whole day walking from one mall to another. You can also just stay inside as many malls are connected from MRT station. A good mix of middle range mall to high end designer brands mall. Some malls has movie theater and good restaurants too.

Orchard road is famous for its Christmas decoration where they usually light up the whole stretch."
,,"The Asian answer on Champs Elysees, Paris",4.0,,There are shopping roads and streets like this where you can easily enjoy walking from one luxurious shop to another luxurious shop. But here you walk from an exclusive mall to an even more exclusive mall! Bring enough time. :)
,,Busy but good feel,4.0,,I visited orchard road one evening and being a long stretch there was plenty to see and do.A lot of people around all seem to be just enjoying themselves and getting on with their business.I visited a number of bars to have a drink and whilst expensive it did have a good feel to the atmosphere inside despite it being a bit quiet
,,Fantastic,5.0,,If you are a shopping enthusiast this is the place for you to go. Shopping Centres everywhere. You wont have enough time

,,Great holiday,4.0,,"One of the best area to visit if you planning a trip to Singapore. The area is filled with cafe, good restaurants, hotels and I mean good budget hotels. The place can be a whole day activity or even more. Good places where you can buy gifts and stuff for your loved ones too. A good place for a start it LUCKY PLAZA, ORCHARD PLAZA ...Just go for a stroll in the afternoon or late at night and heaps of happenings always....i loved it and i am sure you will too."
,,High class area in Singapore,4.0,,This place is one of the high class area in Singapore. Has almost all the major brands in hotels. Has maximum number of malls on this road. But most of them are very expensive. Although you don't want to buy anything as a tourist just visit this place as a good hangout place.
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"Amazing the minute you arrive at the Orchard MRT. Convenient to anything, anywhere. Local food galore in cool comfort. Affordable prices. Serving sizes allows you to sample more dishes. I like the eatery at Tangs, Ngee Ann City & Ion (the green Liu sa bao is yum). Xmas is a good time if you like the light ups. Just magnificent. Never fails to surprise. Any other time, its a shopping haven. Latest up to date anything, shoes, bags, gadgets, food...you name it. You can spend all day from one end of Orchard to Plaza Singapura, spans over 3 MRTs. You don't feel the distance, cos there's never ending things to see, Just love it. Window shopping is just as good. A good work out too."
,,Luxury Shopping District!,4.0,,"We walked to Orchard from Ibis Bencoolen. There's a lot of very nice shopping malls here. They have wonderful street displays for Christmas. A lot of the luxury brands are in Orchard like Louis Vitton, Prada, Gucci, Pandora, IWC, Issey Miyaki, lots of fine watch stores etc. For cheaper finds you can opt to go to Lucky Plaza which is also in Orchard. Budget meals are also in Lucky Plaza."
,,Love shopping,5.0,,We stayed on Orchard Road. Which is my favourite as of it's convenience shopping dinning close to botanical garden.
,,Catchup Place,5.0,,"There's lots of shops and cafes nearby the MRT stations at either end (Orchard MRT or Somerset MRT). Orchard Road is basically a long strip of shops and hotels from one station to the other, so you can shop til your hearts content if your a shopaholic. There are a few small ice cream stalls along the road for those dying for a ice cream or drink while walking."
,,So busy,2.0,,"It was ok only, not the real Singapore but if you want Mall after Mall, it's the place to go. We saw from the top of the bus tour and couldn't face it! Shops no cheaper than in U.K. Why come to Singapore for MnS??"
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"This place is a paradise for street shopping. U can enjoy a variety of things like local food, street shopping, exclusive brands and much more.

Alternatively u can also find a lot of 1st copy of brands like dior, guess, timberland, rado, Rolex and the likes.

Orchard road is a station itself. So it is easy to reach."
,,Always vibrant and endless shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the places that defines Singapore.
Endless shopping and dining, there's almost as many tourists as locals.
Relatively low crime it's one city you can visit without having to watch your back all the time.

Nights in Orchard Road gets even more exciting when the city lights come on.
When the pace gets too fast just chill at a cafe & people watch."
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,Lots of great shopping and a great place to people watch too. There are train stations all along Orchard road so it is easy to get to.
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"I could have spent the entire holiday allowance on this road - very tempting. Electronics, designer clothing and watches - my vices."
,,Excellent for high end shopping or just a stroll,5.0,,"My hubby and I did orchard road one late afternoon for the first time.

What can I say, it is excellent for high end shopping as here is where you will find many Gucci, Prada, LV etc stores to name a few . Although you will find similar stores all around, so if you do miss a store you're bound to come across it again.

It's a good stroll and very packed but with a lovely atmosphere . There are also many shopping centres everywhere , around 10 on orchard road I think.

So if you want to seek refuge from the humidity pop into any one of them to cool down .

I would recommend visiting but recommend wearing comfortable shoes as you will do a lot of walking ."
,,Western high end retail therapy,3.0,,"The Orchard road beloved of those of a certain age, has disappeared under high rise and concrete, gone are the old local traders and In are any of the Multi national high street names you can find in any big city. The charm it once had has long gone and I regret to say will never been seen again.
If you like high end western retail therapy you will love it, if you are looking for old Singapore forget it."
,,trip to Orchard Roadf,5.0,,This area of Singapore is a great area to visit while in Singapore. There is so much to see and do that this areea is a must see when traveling to Singapore.
,,For rich poeple and shoppaholics,5.0,,A lot of good choices for shopping. I would definitely enjoy being here if I have lots of money. One thing I like about it is the Lucky Mall where Jollibee is located and where cheap pasalubong stores are. I would definitely come back here when I get rich :D
,,Lovely walk but few unique shops,4.0,,Overall this was a pleasant experience but the world is becoming a lot smaller. most of the shops along orchard road can be found in most big cities
,,Expensive for shopping,5.0,,This area has options for high-end shopping. The area is nice to visit. Christmas decoration is really fancy.
,,Best Shopping Area,4.0,,The Orchard Street is my favourite shopping street. There are a lot of expensive brands but also shopping for normal people.

,,Orchard Road Shopping,5.0,,"We recently shopped in Orchard Rd Malls during CNY Sales and found some fantastic bargains from shops that are not yet in Perth. The Ion Orchard seems to go forever, when finished there proceed towards Somerset MRT for an endless range of shopping.(:)"
,,3 day stay in Singapore,3.0,,"We were staying at a nearby hotel 5 minutes walk from Orchard Road. High end shopping with brand names bouncing around the many malls. Not my cup of tea personally however found the subterranean malls surprisingly interesting, well air conditioned, reasonably priced food and clean toilet facilities were the norm. Pricy city, charged between 16-24 Singapore dollars for a pint of beer, found a great little eating precinct below ground next door to the Drunken Poet bar. Fresh good quality food cooked in front of you for equivalent of about £4-£5 per generous portion washed down with a litre of Tiger beer for equivalent of £5. Locals only using it but we were made very, very welcome. Well worth checking out if you don't mind the communal atmosphere."
,,Christmas light up,5.0,,"Interestingly, though Orchard Road is known as the main shopping district of Singapore where many branded shops abound, we were not there for that reason.

Instead, we were there close to midnight after visiting the Night Safari to view the Christmas light up which is one of the main attractions every year.

Beautiful and grand, the lights and gigantic Christmas tree and decorations add more life into the area. If you are visiting Singapore in December, be sure to visit Orchard Road at night to catch the light up."
,,Endless shopping,5.0,,Shops and plazas lasting appx 2.2 kms. Explore to hidden shopping plazas along the strip and shop until you drop Dont forget to stay hydrated maybe even stop for a coffee.
,,Same old,3.0,,"I found it boring because I'm not an avid shopper with $$$ to spend. I was in Singapore to explore and observe a new city, not to waste my time in big malls. But the malls are massive and very clean and the staff are quite friendly, so I'd suggest coming here if you are keen to shop for high end brands"
,,A great shopping street,5.0,,Orchard Road is World famous and visiting it at Christmas is quite amazing. Singapore presents and bright and colourful Christmas Shopping experience. The shops are all festively festooned and even the road itself has bright lights crossing the road for all of it's length. Some of the shops are repeated along the road. It can be argued that there are only so many luxury good shops of the same brand that a City can sustain. The pavements are very wide to allow good access although it has to be said that on festive nights there are so many people here getting around can be very slow. We love it.
,,brands ? so what,2.0,,"i can see those anywhere in the world no need to go , the only thing i like was in the orchard centre , go to top level and see the city from above , and the ion sky too"
,,Exciting shopping street,5.0,,"This street is at the heart of the shopping district in Singapore. Great shops, malls, vendors, restaurants, hotels, etc. In this area you can buy the most expensive jewelry to the kitschiest item. It is a must to visit."
,,Hedonism,4.0,,more shops than anyone could want. Lots of high end designers brands. Not a place for bargain hunting. Easy to get lost within these huge shopping malls along Orchard Road. Well served by transport links
,,Walk down,4.0,,"Walking down the orchard road makes you feel the real feel of Singapore. Malls, from high end like ION to others like Orchard palza, MRT Somerset, numerous eateries, nicely decorated pavements due to new year, the new tear countdown, live music in Cuppaze Plaza, really unbelievable."
,,Shopping on Orchard Road,4.0,,"Lots of shops to visit-many offering tax return shopping. All designer brands here in the vast shopping malls. Fantastic restaurants also here, including Din Tai Fung! Even if not buying anything, a stroll down Orchard Road is a must whilst in Singapore!"

,,Really?,3.0,,"When I think of great shopping experiences (I don't really like to shop), I think of New York, London, Paris, Bangkok, Dublin, Hong Kong and other cities of the world that have a unique experience.

This could be anywhere.
Same Same and despite it being December had little vibe at all."
,,Lots to shop for in all price brackets,4.0,,"You can shop everything from high end brands in the ION Orchard Complex (Orchard MRT station) to local small stores selling luggage, camera equipment, clothing and food.

,,"Shops, plenty of cafes and restaurants",5.0,,"Here you will find Shopping Centers mixed with plenty of Restaurants and interesting Street Art, a must to visit at least once during your visit."
,,Busy High End Retail,3.0,,It is worth walking around Orchard Road area. An interesting and informative stop is the Singapore Visitors Centre.
,,Great shopping area,5.0,,Orchard Road has very many shops and eating areas. I enjoyed shopping in Lucky Plaza it has a good choice of shops and also a great eating hall down stairs especially if you enjoy authentic Chinese food and duck...yummy
,,Shopping Paradise!,5.0,,"From what I remembered 20 something years ago, it was huge. I was blown away by how grand, green and leafy the street is this time around. There are 2 MRT station Somerset and Orchard Road so you should be OK to walk and shop all along the street. All the brand name, you could think of is there. CNY is not the best time as many shops are closed esp male fashion but there is plenty around to see, drink, eat and shop or even to look around. It did rain from time to time when we were there and so between big department stores we had to walk in the rain to another, which was a bit inconvenience and not very glam."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,Lots of shops! High end. If brands. Not many bargains. Great for window shopping. Iconic Singapore shopping street.
,,Perfect place,5.0,,This is the perfect place for any shopp-aholic around. Besides numerous malls of any price level (from Lucky Placa for Filipinas to high end).
,,Known for all the top brands in Fashion!,4.0,,"A broad selection of shopping centres almost along the entire Road. Though this time we also discovered several quality restaurants that focus on being open in the evening! Great to find several large granite benches on which to sit, and an underpass can take you from one side of the street to the other with little effort required."
,,A site to see,4.0,,On a trip to Singapore we travelled to Orchard Road - a place where you can find almost anything and get some really good bargains. Allow plenty of time to see everything because there is a lot to see
,,Drop Dead!,5.0,,"You could drop dead shopping on this street. There is so much to see and buy and so much to compare to each other, trouble is you can't remember where you saw it earlier or cheaper lol and with the CNY sales it was ripe for the picking on all fronts. Also there are so many food halls and malls that you can get a great meal for ridiculously low cost and public transport is super reasonable and efficient, you can get anywhere, anytime for peanuts. Do yourself a favour - shop till you drop dead!"

Transportation is world class to and from anywhere and everywhere. Now you know why we are call the most expensive city in the world??A MUST visit if you are in Singapore.. my two cent."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,You will find anything on this street. They have a lot of shopping from designer to really cheap stuff. It's endless and overwhelming with the amount of shops that you definitely need days to shop on this street.
,,Shop to your Heart's Content!,4.0,,"Orchard Road, as the name suggest, was actually a fruit orchard back in the olden days, subsequently rezoned to be a shopping center belt. Here you can find some of the world's leading luxury brands set up boutique shops here, usually as its Asia Pacific flagship alongside Hong Kong. On any hot day (yes, summer all year round), one can duck into the malls and enjoy cool air-conditioned comfort while shopping, sipping coffee at coffee chains etc. Ignore outdoor touts or promoters trying to entice you to try their lucky draws (nothing comes free!). Thankfully, these people are not plenty, and you can enjoy your shopping or strolling in peace. Orchard Road are working to improve the shopping experience for those with mobility problems (they can certainly do more here, but have done reasonably well thus far). For those with babies or children, several departmental stores offer nursing room where you can breastfeed your babies in privacy or change diappers (Takashimaya, ION, Paragon, Isetan Scotts, 313, Plaza Singapura, Wheelock). Toilets are available in all shopping malls for the public use (maintained by the malls), are clean and readily available.

Prices of goods are on the $$ side, though you can find all the world's brands gathered under one roof for yor shopping experience! Upmarket shopping galore, with inexpensive teenage and youth clothings to be found in hip shopping malls like Far East Plaza and Orchard Central. VAT/GST rebates are available in all shopping malls(minimum amount spending).

Note: Casual attire encouraged. Some said Singapore's tourists and locals alike has degraded to the point of wearing singlets, and flip flops while wandering around the shopping belt. Unlike other places which are near to beaches or resorts (thus the easy dress code), it pays to dress in casual comfortable clothing. Famous brands, restaurants, pubs lined Orchard Road. No problem with ice, water here (meets WHO standard).

No smoking rule in Singapore, especially in shopping centres, air-conditioned area, enclosed area, and places where pedestrians congregate. Non smokers will understand. Littering strictly not allowed, especially cigarette butts, plastic bottles etc."
,,Lots of shops!,4.0,,"If your looking for something specific to purchase, I have no doubt you will find it on Orchard Road.

There is multi-level department store after multi-level department store in this strip, if your in Singapore to shop, absolutely head here.

Personally, I found much of what was here things I could get back home in Australia and in some cases cheaper at home - so it didn't really blow me away like I thought it would.

Also, many of the stores featured in other shopping locations - so if you don't make it to Orchard Road, I honestly don't think your missing out.

It as still a nice stroll and there were some pretty spectacular decorations up for Chinese New Year. It was nice and worth visiting if your into shopping, but it didn't blow me away.

Best way to get there is via rail. There is a stop ""Orchard"" right at the head of the street, very well situated."
,,Busy street!,5.0,,A great place for individuals who love to shop!!! it was quite amazing to see the big shopping centers and high end stores!
,,Good shopping malls,4.0,,"Enough malls to appeal to everyone in the family with countless places to eat, shop and escape the heat"
,,Tired feet,5.0,,This street is unbelievable!!! The shopping centres look small from the outside but once inside are just huge. While inside it's a welcome rest from the humidity.
,,Nice Shopping Street,4.0,,"This road has all of the designers, I think, in the world. The stores are huge! There are also jewelry stores and many watch stores. The restaurants are good. It is a nice area to walk. Of course all of Singapore is so clean and safe that you can walk anywhere!"
,,Heart of Shopping!!,4.0,,"Want to spend a lot of money?? Then come here & splurge!! All sorts of shops!! Jewelry, fashion, malls..."
,,Christmas street!!,5.0,,"Absolutely loved staying on Orchard road, so central but what we really loved is the transformation the whole street goes under when in the Christmas season, everywhere you look there is lights, decorations, Christmas trees and holiday season songs. Loved walking this road during day and night, so many shops and malls that are accessible and within walking distance."
,,Good for a stroll,5.0,,Its a bit expensive but you get to see all high end brands on one street. It gets really decorated and looks super amazing during festivals and christmas
,,Orchard Road my favourite shopping and eating out destination.,5.0,,"Orchard Road has it all from high end shopping to streetware. Fine dining and some of the best roadside stalls. The hygiene is unquestionably high so eating anywhere is pretty much safe.
The pace keeps you going without getting tired. The only spoke in the wheel was the heavy rainfall in the two days we were there this visit."
,,best place to shop,4.0,,"Well if you love to shop, this is the place! lots of mall everywhere. you won't run out of mall to visit. If you can't find what you're looking for in one mall, just move to the next one. the sidewalk is also really comfy and clean."
,,The most famous road in S'pore,4.0,,Orchard is the most famous road in S'pore. Heaven for shopaholics from all around the world. You pretty much can shop for anything in this road.

Many U.K. Brands M&S for example ! Lots of eateries to keep you going ! Enjoy !"
,,Shopping Galore,5.0,,"For shopaholics, this is the place to visit. Get off either at Somerset or Orchard stops using the MRT, you land at a mall. Shop at your heart's delight you won't be disappointed."
,,"Superficial, boring and its aim is solely profit making",1.0,,"Superficial area with little busking and only one ""street food"" which is ice cream cart.
Most of the eateries caters to high end crowds where they serve ridiculously expensive food.
Lack of public seating for those who wanna take a rest or eat their snacks.

Everywhere is materialistic."
,,Shopping Therapy,4.0,,"The main commercial street of Singapore. Malls, shops, accessible by two metro stations, cafes and restaurants. Also some of the perpendicular roads are interesting. Not a cultural walk since you encounter no museums or temples but that of a metropolis that has to offer clothing, electronics, apparels and other capitalistic goods.
Also lots of businesses and social events are housed in the vicinity. The main strip of interest is about a km in length."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"I've been to Orchard road on numerous occasions. It's always been great. The variety is huge and can be overwhelming at times. All the malls are linked underground. There are fantastic places to snack or have a good meal.
Shops are open until late but be careful trying to hail down a taxi if your hotel isn't within the area. It can be difficult after 10pm, with lengthy queues.
Overall a fantastic place to shop!"
,,New year shopping,4.0,,"You can get most of the branded goods here in ion, paragon n takashimaya. Also some of the cheap item in far east or lucky plaza. As for food wise is at far east or lucky plaza you can get some halal food there."
,,Cleanest shopping street in the world,5.0,,"All the big brand shops, different shopping malls, hotels and restaurants are available in this nice, central located road.
Orchard road is probably the cleanest road in the world and a must for the shoppers.. During Christmas period there is a really nice decoration overhanging the street."
,,High end fantasy,3.0,,"Full of high end boutiques and big name brands like Gucci, Tiffany etc Very beautifully decorated for Christmas. The architecture of the various malls is also quite a site to behold. Takes a whole day to explore."
,,Be Here or Be Square,5.0,,"That Shopping Heaven! Vicinity fully loaded with labels labels labels and more labels! As an avid shopper..i find extra peace here! That sidewalk cafes, that busy streets. Be a local lah!"
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"You would need several days to really see this area, if you can't find it here you won't find it anywhere. We visited one of the large department stores, excellent"
,,Street-smart holiday,5.0,,"Each trip to Singapore for me begins with a visit to an evening of Orchard Road. Everything else - then. And yet, I highly recommend the last flight scheduled trip to the tour bus SIA Hop-on the yellow line (in the winter flight about 18 hours). You drive to Orchard Rd, and, at the same time, turn on the illumination that accompanies you through a further, interesting route around the city. It is very important due to the program Singapore Stopover Holiday (SSH) travel on tour buses in the city all five routes free.
Very nice on the street at night, when all the lights are lit. The whole street in shopping centers, one after the other, in which there are different brands, from the most famous to the Chinese."
,,"Shopping, bars, restaurants in gleaming modern Singapore",4.0,,"No trip to Singapore would be complete without a nice long stroll down Orchard Road to check out the shops, bars, and restaurants. Excellent to see both day and night."
,,Everything from Soup to Nuts,5.0,,This Road is like the 5th Ave of New York City. All your high end clothing stores with various shopping center mixed in with several variety store.
,,Modern Singapore,4.0,,"This is the super modern Singapore with fabulous (and expensive) shopping places. At 313 Somerset, we had dinner at Marche and loved it. The walk with its street magician was entertaining."
,,Shopping Heaven,4.0,,"Orchard Road will give any shopaholic a real fix. There is just about every shop imaginable above and below ground. It takes more than a day to cover it all.
Shops range from high class Gucci and Versace to more normal shops like Zara.
If it is raining you can still negotiate most of it without getting wet. There are plenty of places to stop off for a coffee.
The road is decorated with flower displays and some beautiful sculptures."
,,Paradise for shoppers,5.0,,During Chinese New Year it's crowded but clean and pleasant to walk. Paradise for shoppers. Very wide variety of shops and brands. A lot of restaurants and cafés too.
,,great shopping place,5.0,,we went during Christmas vacations so it was beautifully decorated.and all major stores and brand is available there.
,,One of my favorite streets,5.0,,Orchard road will give you a taste of the classy side of Singapore. You will find malls and food courts everywhere.
,,Nice Place for Shopping,4.0,,There are plenty of shopping mall in this road. Buyer has both the option to buy brand or local item. Local shops have cheap price
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,"Recommendation: I would research what it that you want to shop for at Orchard Road (adidas, Nike, Desigual etc.) and then work out which end of the strip you should start at (or stay in). Otherwise, as others may have noted, Orchard Road can be overwhelming. It's entirely possible to spend an entire day in one of the shopping malls, and there are easily 15 large malls/department stalls to get lost in :D
If you have kids, you may wish to concentrate on one shopping centre. Some have activities for kids and toy stores but otherwise, I don't recommend bringing them for an all-day visit. It's not that exciting for them.
Paragon is great for high-end labels, toys, sporting labels. Takashimaya is the Japanese department store so has some Japanese labels and an amazing food/dining floor on the basement level. Orchard Central has many interesting shops.
If you don't have a lot of time or patience, I would choose one and browse."
,,Great Christmas lights,3.0,,Loved walking down the road looking at all the Christmas lights and sights. Lots of expensive designer shops
,,"Just shops, restaurants and people",3.0,,"I'm giving it an average rating only because it wasn't what we needed. I'm sure if you're looking to do some shopping of H&M, Forever21 and those luxury brands, Orchard Road can definitely satisfy your need."
,,Just like any other high end shopping strip,2.0,,"First of all Singapore is expensive, we know that but to fly here specifically for shopping is not recommended at all. Aside from the prices, staff are rude or lack the hospitality and warmth of their ASEAN neighbors. We found it full of pretentious people with no extra value to offer. You can come roam the streets for an hour or so, but unless going to the ion 55th floor sky, I'd say Skip the whole visit."
,,Painful!,2.0,,I love shopping but this place is just too overwhelming. It is mall after interconnected mall and it just feels endless. Good luck if you're looking for a specific item! I'd much prefer boutique shopping at street level but this is hard to come by in Singapore.
,,This is Singapore where we were,4.0,,"Visit Singapore last week as we start begin of this year 2017 to first holiday in this year. Were here on our last day before head back to Bali. Just found out this area clean and lux. Shoping place was great. we been to ION Orchard to do some shoping.
Probabs come back here again soon with my bf when He turn to Asia from Australia."
,,Shopppppiiinnnggg,4.0,,"This road is littered with many shopping centers and restaurants. It is definitely fun to walk down, and the people watching is good. Prices at stores and restaurants very, so there's definitely something for everyone. And of course window shopping is always free. There's not much in the way of culture: museums, galleries, historical sites, etc., But still fun for exploration. There is also a nice movie theater in the Shaw complex, if like us, you get caught in a rainstorm."
,,Posh upstreet,4.0,,Very modern upstreet with good brands and a nice place to hangout ! Its pretty at all times and i had visited this place in morning as well as night and liked both the experience
,,Lot to choose from,4.0,,"You can get everything from orchard road. Clothes, electronics, jewellery, food... you name it! But it is pricey. Look out for food courts to get cheaper food. You can find them from almost every shopping center, usually on bottom level (locals think those arent cheap, but you can get great meal for two for 10-15SGD, which isn't bad in this area)."
,,So many shops,4.0,,We spent a rainy day wandering up and down orchard road - there is a fair bit of shelter from the rain and many malls and different levels of shopping.
,,For shopping lovers,4.0,,"But the shops are quite expensive! Remember it is very hot, think about umbrella if you are planning to walk there, it is very crowded as well."
,,Good place to find shopping centers,4.0,,Where high-end shopping malls are located. Try the famous ice cream sandwich for 1.20 sgd. Blueberry flavor is tasty.
,,One of the great shopping precincts,4.0,,"I'm not all that interested in shopping, however Orchard Road offers such a diversity of traders (not all fashion and jewellery) and they are generally so well presented, that even I can avoid total boredom."
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,Excellent shopping experience a lot of department stores and malls to choose from. Prices are reasonable.
,,The same but [slightly] different,3.0,,"All the exclusive brands represented, seemingly often two or three times. Victoria's Secret Stores by at least 4. When comparing prices with what one pays in Australia, I thought things were on the expensive side; no bargains as far as I was concerned.
Less hustle and bustle than Hong Kong."
,,Shopper's paradise!,4.0,,Wow! So many malls and shops and restaurants! Be sure to go underground for more local and affordable stores - the ground level stores are mostly high street brands and expensive stores.
,,Main place for shopping.,5.0,,It's a place that u can shop all. Kind of branded & original item. Pricing to shop is when there a sale (discount) going on. Look out for the month.
,,Shopping paradise but not cheap at all!,5.0,,One mall after the other and they are too many of them. It is a shopping paradise but the prices are not cheap at all and it is hard to find a bargain!
,,Great,5.0,,"You haven't been to Singapore without a stroll along Orchard Rd , So many sights & smells , amazing shopping centres to escape from the humid heat & lots of places to tempt your taste buds too."
,,Busy Street,5.0,,We visited Singapore around Christmas 2016 and this street was beautifully decorated. The shops were lit and total atmosphere was very very festive.
,,Friday Evenings !,4.0,,"If you like hustle bustle of the crowd , weekends are the best time to be here. Branded shops for satiate your designer instincts ."
,,Alive 24/7,5.0,,"This road is where its happening at night. The street was well decorated for the Christmas season and was alive all the time. Branded stores, food stalls, entertainers were all seen side-by-side. The colours, the brands and the people made this street come to life at night. Beware, traffic moves very slowly. Visit the Lucky Plaza. Lots of bargains and some are genuine branded products. Hidden deep inside Lucky Plaza is a very clean Asian food court selling quality food at affordable prices."
,,Shop 'til you drop or run out of money!,3.0,,"The main shopping area of SIngapore. Plenty of shops, all very high end and no bargains to be had, Exclusive boutiques. Underground, a plethora of Malls. If you like shopping, you'll have lots of choice but maybe an empty wallet all too soon!"
,,Shopping galore!,4.0,,"If you need to find something to buy, it is probably in one of the shops on Orchard Road. If you just prefer to people-watch, not annoyed with crowds and would like to soak in the hip and chic side of Singapore, you can just sit on one of the benches, buy Wall's ice cream from the vendor and feed bread to the doves. :)"
,,Shopping paradiso!,5.0,,"Be prepared to max out your cards here,especially if there's sales going on like everywhere. Good for photography"
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"A street that has tons of shopping centres, from little boutiques to high end designer brands, it has everything here, it's a must to come here if your a shopping lover !"
,,"Busy, Busy",5.0,,"Orchard Road just thrives with bustling crowds, going hither and thither, one wonders to where they are going. There are so many shops, so many arcades with so many stores. Department stores of the highest name quality,and not just one of them, but lots in different places. One cannot imagine how they ever make profit, but the thousands of people that we saw, particularly over a weekend, must make opening all worth while. It is a great experience, but it is clinical, with a scrubbed squeaky-clean appearance, little remains of the Singapore I knew back in the Sixties, with the street food hawker stalls, and the smell of burning Tilly lamps.
I managed to locate an 'oasis' - few and far between in this place, a pub! 'The Drunken Poet' is a place where the man may rest whilst his lady visits the shops. The pub is on
Orchard Road near the junction with Claymore Lane.
Enjoy the delights of Orchard Road."
,,"great selection, avoid during holidays, no bargains here however",5.0,,"We went a few days after Christmas, kids were out of school, the crowds were crushing and noisy , not fun, lots of lines for everthing, shopping is over the top with selections and variety . I would go to Harbor Front shopping center for better prices and near equvalent prices. Of course none will beat China town for prices and variety"
,,Don't know why this is rated ad a top experience,1.0,,"Wish we hadn't bothered. Hot and traffic filled roads polluting the atmosphere, old fashioned and worn out shopping arcades full of shops you can get anywhere in the world these days. Marina Bay Sands is a much better shopping experience. We couldn't wait to get out of there."
,,Once a shopping haven,3.0,,"This area was once a shopping haven, but now the prices have clearly sky-rocketed, and it has moved increasingly to become a high end shopping strip, but still suffers from the difficulty with being able to cross the road in the main shopping district. On the plus side, the dining options are very good for a lunch whilst shopping."
,,Shops shops and more shops,3.0,,"Well if you Like to spend Money and shop this is the right place to go in Singapore Nothing Real authentic about the place, the small authentic houses on a side Road was the Best"
,,Amazing shopping,4.0,,I was completely overwhelmed by the number of shopping arcades up and down the length of this road. They all seem to stock very similar products so it is possible to get a good bargain.
,,Some fun Xmas decorations,3.0,,"Orchard Rd was ok, not exceptional. There are some very expensive and freezing cold shopping malls. Lucky Plaza is a more popular shopping mall, mainly for the Phillipines expats. The food court was ok, the duck with rice, vegetables and soup was $6 australian. It was fun to get around but not exceptional or memorable. There are better places to visit first in Singapore. Go to Orchard Rd only if you've seen it all, have lots of time on your hands and lots of money to spend, otherwise give it a miss. Save yourself for Nanjing Rd in Shanghai pr Wangfujing Rd in Beijing. Orchard Rd is far behind."
,,Shop to the hilt,4.0,,"With 35 large malls to explore you can buy anything. Plenty of food outlets to enjoy as well. However, prices are high."
,,Retail therapy at its best,4.0,,"Got to let the ladies have some time shopping and there is no where better than Orchard Road, again on the hop on / of bus route, loads of shopping malls and all the designer names you want.
Just don't let time or the credit card run away."
,,the fashionable road of Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the most fashionable road of Singapore..everything you would think of fashion and jewerly is there..but dont focus only at shopping if you are a bit cultural the around Orchard area you will find Singapore Art Museum , the Gallery, the Istana and much more"
,,Too busy,2.0,,"If you don't want to shop avoid this area. Hotel wise, is not so convenient either. Too busy. If you need to get a taxi, call for one or wait for hours."
,,Shopping,5.0,,It's happening street with so many world wide brands to see and buy. Full to excitement street. It's has approx. 22 malls to visit.
,,Gucci Store,5.0,,"Gucci bag in store, good quality, expensive if you dont have money, cheap if you have money. It depends on your money!"
,,Confusing,3.0,,"Orchid Road is a very long road. If you don't know what your looking for or preplan it will be a waste of time. Not many bargains to be found. High end shops are high end found anywhere in any big city. Bargains, well you need to know where to go to find them. Don't rely on the taxi drivers"
,,Glimpse of modern shopping experience,4.0,,"A good place for high-end shopping as most popular top brands have chain shops around Orchard road area.
Lot of markets covering all major brands and retailers.
Price is standard to global pricing. Can't expect much of discount around.
Good place for 1 stop shopping experience; specially for Ladies.
Nice decorations around for family photo experiences and good multi cultural cuisines around for dining.
A must visit for 01st time travelers to Singapore, even for couple of hours.
Orchards Road area give the idea of modern Singapore."
,,Busy street with a lot of overpriced stores,2.0,,"If you come to Singapore to shop and money is not an issue, then dive in. This is the place to spend your time and money. Orchard Road is always busy with people walking in random directions. Locals have a term about walking on Orchard Road, they call it ""splitting of the Orchard sea"". You will be constantly stopping and trying to avoid collision with other pedestrians.
On this street you will find every brand you might think of. If you know how much it costs in your country, multiply x2, or x3 and you will get the price. :o)
The one thing for sure is that you will be buying a genuine product. This is why many Asians come to Singapore to shop. They don't want to buy the fake version.
If you are looking for a restaurant, try to move away from Orchard Road. There are a few good restaurants, but most of them offer mediocre food at ""Orchard Road"" price."
,,"Classic Shopping Street, as interesting below ground as above",4.0,,"Among the top things to do in Singapore, it is a shopping mecca. Even for those not interested in shopping, the cultural aspect of seeing so many people out and about is astounding. The underground city under the street is enormous, with as many shops and restaurants below ground as above. The food court at the Ion Center (modern day hawker center) is a good place for a bite. The Takashimaya Center has a lot of upscale stores. The only problem is how to get across the street to the other side of the underground city."
,,Enjoy a day,4.0,,"Enjoy a day at the orchard road has a special sensation, met with people from all over the world with a variety of styles to please look"
,,The Mecca Of Singapore.,5.0,,"Orchard Road shares a familiar association with Singapore. It is the busiest part of the city, teeming with retail chains, hotels and restaurants. It's basically the most happening spot in the city and definitely worth a visit!"
,,It's got everything and more!,5.0,,Just put on the walking shoes and enjoy. Plenty of malls thousands of shops and on Sundays millions of people. Just do the wall or preplan if you have limited time. Different food courts match different ethnicities for theme of food!
,,Convenient shopping and eating,4.0,,Orchard road is worth visiting during your Singapore visit. In fact it is a must. One gets a great variety in shopping and eateries. From mediocre to high end. It is a very good experience. Mind you prices of most products in Singapore are either equivalent to India or more. My advise is to only buy products which are not available in India at all.Then price does not matter. Such products are plenty if you have time at hand to explore. Cannot be done in a hurry. Most of the shopping areas are air conditioned and does not tyre you out.Can spend the whole day.
,,Good but super touristy!,3.0,,"Went because I had read it was good, bit of a pain to get to and very busy with tourists but they had a tonne of Christmas lights up and displays etc - which were stunning. Grabbed some food in the shopping centre and it was nice and cheap - went to a Japanese place - best tempura prawns I've ever had! Architecture is nice so add it into your trip if you can, but unless you plan on shopping it isn't a must must see!"
,,Omg,5.0,,We travel quiet a lot but I haven't seen so many high end boutiques in one mall :) Shopping is amazing in Singapore but the prices are the same as we have in Canada at the boutiques but with no tax. The reason to shop in Singapore is a different selection and bigger variety. Orchard st is the place to start your shopping
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"We stayed at the Mandarin Orchard Singapore which is located on Orchard Road itself so we were lucky to see Orchard Road every day of our stay.

As we had visited the country during the Christmas Season we were lucky to take in the sights of the streets being so splendidly decorated with Christmas decor.

Such a treat to see such efforts taken to do up a stretch of road which runs for miles at a stretch. Stunning.
Great Shopping Centers, each one better than the other. Nearly each Mall has a food court so you wont go hungry.

Mall likes Paragon, Takashimaya, Center Point one, Orchard Gateway line Orchard Road. There are even more malls as the list can go on.
Orchard road is mostly crowded as it is the main shopping district of Singapore. We had a fabulous time and love spending time on Orchard road."
,,Heaven for shopping,4.0,,"Orchard road is just an ordinary road, nothing special.. But if you really love shopping, this road is the best! Here you can find many stores, such as fashion store, food store, etc.. But i think the price is pretty expensive here.."
,,"Stores after stores, shopping centres after shopping centres...",3.0,,"Not really my thing, I don't care for shopping. You can find almost any store you can think of and all the major luxury brands, too. What I missed was cafe's/bars on the street level."
,,Very expensive shops,5.0,,I had been here many years ago and found the shops expensive then. Now they are even more expensive. But what in Singapore isn't. IF you have the money go for it. If not it is still worth a stroll down the road
,,Brand name shops,3.0,,"Great array of brand name shops, however pricing of the items tend to be on the very steep end compared to other countries such as Australia. Still well worth a visit especially at night."
,,Shop until you drop,5.0,,"So many storys, from really expensive brands to basic cheap stores and markets. Along this road there are super mall after super mall that are conected to each other so you can walk along this road for hours and days. Happy shopping!"
,,Allow a full day for Shopping!,5.0,,Very many shopping malls to visit. Very modern. One of Singapore's must do. So give yourself at least two days to visit that city/state.
,,just ok,3.0,,"if you have ever been to shopping streets in Bangkok, you will not say Wow. It's ok. There are shops. Lacks of variety."
,,Very expensive but a nice walk,3.0,,"Very upmarket area of singapore.
Don't expect to find any bargains here; the department stores are all very expensive, but lovely to escape from the humid singapore heat.
Affordable restaurants are also hard to find unless you visit a food court.
Being able to easily catch taxis is a big positive, and they can be caught from the taxi stands at various hotels along the street."
,,Need to Shop branded stuff?,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the place should you need to buy branded stuff.

You get lots of shops and malls to shop till you drain. Since it was the new year season we travelled, Orchard Road was decorated nicely but not nice it used to be many years ago.

Access from anywhere to Orchard Road is easy by Taxi or train.

The malls in Orchard Road were decorated beautifully during year end many great offers, I mean genuine offers."
,,the Mall mile of singapore,5.0,,easily accessible by the metro SMRT. there are lots of malls here with the major brands form across the world. good for an evening out for dining and shopping
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,Fortunately on this occasion we were only in Singapore for one night otherwise my wife's Credit Cards would have gone into melt down. Orchard Road is simply a shopper's paradise - leave the girls to it and find a Bar (it'll help numb the pain of the Credit Card bill).
,,Great Shopping Experience,4.0,,A virtual maze of shops and shopping centres. It can be difficult to access due to the volume of traffic. One gets lost in the vast array of shops available and there is no shortage of eating places to rest those weary limbs. Can be very crowded but this adds to the atmosphere as a whole.
,,Luxury brand stroll,3.0,,We just went here for a stroll in the afternoon before going to the airport. Twas a nice walk inside but outside is scorching heat!
,,Orchard road,5.0,,Paradise for shoppaholics! What you can't find here you don't need it! Big malls side by side for all price categories.
,,Shopping galore,5.0,,"For those who love to shop this is the place for you, corner to corner shopping from clothes to jewelry"
,,Must Visit,5.0,,"Orchard road is another amazing place to visit even for an experience if not for shopping, it has many shopping centers giving a feel of roadside shopping like old days, very crowded but yet it is well managed and one can easily roam around even with small kids with strollers."
,,"A staple for window-shopping, retail therapy and great dining",4.0,,"Orchard Road is a favourite weekend spot for many, crowded though it is. The pedestrian mall and underground link ways make the whole street level and below it so navigable. You want the sun, walk the street. The trees provide some shade anyway. You want shade n airconditioning, run underground. There are lots of shopping and dining options that one is really spoilt for choice. Very crowded but also very vibrant and happening."
,,Lots of Birds Scattered,4.0,,"There are lots of birds scattered here, and they're surprisingly very used to people. I have been told that it is not allowed to shoo the birds away. I also the ice cream sandwiched in wafers! yummmm"

Before the malls came in, the place had a number of orchards on both sides of the road. None of which sadly remain as Singapore modernised.

,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"A visit to Orchard Road to shop is a must whilst in Singapore. We started on one end, worked our way down that side of the street, then crossed over and worked our way back. It was an All Day event - amazing seeing all those designer label shops in the one precinct - and while we didn't step into those, we found some fabulous department stores and plazas where we treated ourselves to some great products.
Saw it at night once on our travels through - beautifully lit up."
,,Busy street full of shopping malls - what you expect?,4.0,,"Orchard road is certainly one of the must-go-to areas in Singapore, even if you do not like shopping. All the global brands you might expect. It's a busy stretch of road with rows and rows of shops and malls. It's quiet a sight. There are a couple of MRT stations along the road so getting to and from is not that difficult. Don't forget to visit the side street for some little shops as well."
,,Whatever you want,5.0,,"Orchard road feels like the centre of new Singapore it's glitsy huge buildings bearing the names of the top designers and apartment stores is interspersed with older gems like lucky plaza. If you can't find it on Orchard your not looking hard enough. It's very wide traffic area is always awash with cars and only had a few crossing places so be prepared for a 10 minute walk to go to the shop just across the road.
Defiantly worth a visit"

,,NEVER GETS BORING,5.0,,"Best to visit during night time as you can see the lights giving the whole stretch a more lively atmosphere. I love the ice cream vendors in the street, try the ice cream sandwich they are selling and continue walking to the end. ALL BRANDS HERE ARE EXPENSIVE AND HIGH-END so you don't expect a lot of shopping here if you are in a tight budget."
,,for those who like city life and shopping,3.0,,"There are lots of shopping centres, from low to high end. If you come from a busy city like Hong Kong, the place is not special. However, if you like shopping a lot, then it is a wonderful place, you can spend days just to shop."

,,The X-mas lights.,4.0,,"The XMas lights were on and were magnificent. The road was very crowded and full of people. Neat and clean, really pristine.
But people are not very polite, unlike England and Europe. Many were not looking where they were going and would barge into you without a word of apology."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,Very busy on a Sunday. Lucky Plaza was choc a block with those looking for a bargain. Lots of big air conditioned malls with designer shopping.
,,not much but traffic,3.0,,"A main street with lots of traffic, nice shops and eating places, you can find this sort of location in any city."
,,Sunday afternoon,5.0,,Orchard Road comes alive on a Sunday afternoon. There are literally hundreds of people sitting along the steps. I recalled from other visits that Sunday is normally the day off for domestic workers and that they love to sit in groups and chat. This was still evident. The icecream between a piece of bread which you can purchase at the carts along the road is to die for. Very different but delicious.
,,Better shopping elsewhere,3.0,,If you want high end stuff go to orchard road. Its a lovely tree folled road but when we went you couldnt move. I feel like there is better shopping in bugis where more bargains are to be had.
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping!!!!!",4.0,,"Orchard Road is jam packed with lots of beautiful shopping malls. All of the high end designer stores line the street (as well as more affordable stores!). Even if you are not a shopper, it is nice to visit this area and enjoy the atmosphere. Orchard Road is particularly lovely at night when all of the shopfronts are lit up. Worth a visit if you are in the area and highly recommended if you are a shopaholic!!"
,,For shopping reaks very good,4.0,,A very complete shopping road where you will find anything you want from designer staff to a bit cheaper staff. I ma not so much into shopping but you will find as well nice cafes and restaurants.
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"It is amazing how many shops can fit into one street ;-)
The street itself is not really interesting, beside that some malls have nice photo-ops near the boardwalk.
If you go by a cab (taxi) stop in the middle of Orchard-Street.
Be sure, your credit cards are OK before entering the mall. And the shop til you drop"
,,Xmas lights on Orchard road,5.0,,"We walked down orchard road Xmas eve.It was a knockout the lights were amazing.The Xmas music and shop displays were beautiful sight.Singapore,you do Xmas so well."

,,Eclectic mix,5.0,,"Orchard road has everything from bargain basement to designer chic! If you want to shop in Singapore this is the place. The shops are open well into the evening and there are endless centres to explore, with plenty of food outlets so you can stay out all day!"
,,Winter Lights @ Night!,5.0,,"The lights after dark are just stunning. The whole street is like a winter wonderland and you can easily stop to take pictures.
The road is relatively clean, but there is still some bird poop to watch out for. Don't be alarmed by the flock of birds at 6pm onwards that fly through sqauking. It's common."
,,Delicacy of Orchard Road,4.0,,"I heard a lot about Orchard Road as prime commercial location of Singapore. This place is also a hub of shopping mall, flagship brandshops like Rolex, Robinson etc. Arriving at Singapore we had the information that following Merry Christmas Orchard Road decorated magnificently. So we planned to visit there in the evening to have a glimpse of amazing decoration on the eve of Merry Christmas. Really the road was nicely decorated with effigies of animals and carts with multi colour lights. We had also a chance to observe activities performed by several street performers. Many best hotels are situated here. This road is very vibrant followed by huge gathering of tourists. This is worthy to stay hotels beside Orchard Road for those who are eager to be engaged in huge shopping from flagship stores."
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"Orchard Road is heaven for shopping fanatics. From internationally known top end brands, to local shops everything is catered for. The Malls are air conditioned and so provide a welcome break from the heat and humidity."
,,Losing its charm,3.0,,"The Orchard Road decorations were as spectacular as every year. For repeat visitors to Singapore, however, this is nothing new. If it's shopping you're after, Orchard is a bit tired. Vivo City offers a better experience."
,,Nice shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road has been famous for years for their terrific shopping centers. Alas this has changed a lot over the years. In the old days you had rather big centers with numerous small shops and it was a pleasure to browse around.
So what has happened? The previous centers have been traded for large shopping malls with only very expensive stores where there is no chance of getting a bargain.
Singapore may reach the sky but as a shopping center it is going down. It is even hard to be able to buy a silk shirt anymore unless you happen onto a Taylor.
Too bad!!"
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"This place really good for who shopholic, in this place you can found many brand goods or if already sale day, you can found it many discounts, really like heaven."
,,Good for shopping,5.0,,Very positive impression considering a small country of Singapore . Love the convenience of foods around the Shooping mall. You can get cheap local goods to high end restaurant. Definitely will return for more hang up.
,,Best shopping road,5.0,,"This road is amazing, 5th avenue is by far behind. Grab your money and spend :) Never seen such huge crowd of multi national people."
,,Good shopping district,3.0,,"Grey shopping with good food selection and interesting architecture, however no different to many other major cities."
,,Very busy,3.0,,Lots of shops and interest but quite expensive compared to London prices. Its a bit like visiting Oxford Street or Regent street. Lots of shops and department stores that cater for most tastes especially the expensive ones. Didn't really find anything different from back home.
,,Nice shopping,5.0,,Great street full of high end shops. If you are only window shopping is a nice way to spend your day without spending money.
,,Leisurely shopping,4.0,,The shopping areas were not too crowded - just right for a leisurely shopping. It was also easy to find a table at Restaurants.
,,Great shopping area or just to walk,4.0,,"The main strip of Singapore for shopping, dining, etc. Must have time to walk Orchard Road. Some great dining in the area."
,,High end shops thats all,3.0,,"Nothing special. Big name Brands like Chanel etc have their shops here, but Nothing that is a must see for Singapore."
,,If you want~ They've got it!!,5.0,,"A walk along the Orchard Road shopping district is a treat for even the most avid shop-aholic. There is EVERY shop you have ever heard of within 300 yards of the Scott Road intersection, ranging from touristy souvenirs to Rolex, Prada, Burbury and Chanel. The eating places also run the range from local food stalls to 5 star restaurants. The Shaw House building at Scott and Orchard roads has a GREAT movie theater complex, showing all of the latest US releases. This area is a MUST SEE place for all that Singapore has to offer in the way of food and shopping. The SMRT stops right at the Orchard rod!!"
,,Singapore's Champs elysees,3.0,,Singapore's main commercial street. Very similar to Nanjing West Road in Shanghai or Wangfujin in Beijing. Nothing but commercial buildings and malls. Ideal for shopping but poor from touristic point of view
,,Christmas in Singapore,5.0,,"The decorations are awesome..don't miss them if you are there around Christmas. This year is blue in colour, they even play your requested carol. The atmosphere is happy and relaxed."
,,outstanding shopping,5.0,,we've never experienced so many outstanding shopping experiences and indoor and outdoor decorations for the season in any other city.
,,All in,4.0,,"Heart of the City, Full of Shopping , Restaurant and hotels. Very long Road where you can spend whole day even days."
,,Best place for shopping,5.0,,Today our taxi driver took us to Orchard Road. It is a famous tourist attraction shopping area. Both sides of the road with shopping arcade and branded show rooms. It is the best place to buy souvenirs and chocolates.
,,Can be better,2.0,,"I go there only to visit Kinokuniya book (Largest bookstore), Takashimaya (B2 good foods/meal), Isetan (B2 - Japanese foods), Better Toy store (wooden and classical toy shop) and possibly Library - as a meeting spot (Orchard Gateaway).

Nothing else is special and items can be found in any other shopping center in Singapore since they sell all the same things here.

Taxi drivers hate going to orchard especially on weekends due to bad traffic.

Confusing walk and cannot be walk around in rain since they do not have a real under path to every part of shopping center which make you more tiring and not enjoyable."
,,Only if you are heavy shopper,2.0,,"Go by evening
It practically a malls road. You see one you saw then all ;)
The street itself is nice with lot of people restaurants and so

I'm sure that people who like shopping will find it most attractive and will be able to move from one mall to another from sunset to sundown... As said matter of taste"
,,Boring,2.0,,Same old shops selling same goods for double the price. Don't know why this toad is famous. Ok I hate shopping at the best of times but it wasn't any different to any other major city
,,Come.join thousands of people along the road,4.0,,It has something for everyone from shopping at high end stores to bargain basement shopping. Worth a stroll to observe the city
,,great place for shopping,5.0,,"i always have a great time shopping there< i went to Robinson@theheeren where there is always good discount the mall is not too big, easy to navigate. i had a awesome breakfast at laurent's cafe, it s located at B1, and open at 9 am before the mall open so its a good starting point. Takashimaya still my favorite,, nice book at kinokuyama maybe the last book shop in orchard road did walk till orchard tower but not much there."
,,Free Wifi @Tourist Centre,5.0,,"For those of us who like staying connected, the tourist centre is just opposite Somerset 313 and Orchard Central - along the main strip. Huge signs and very easy to find - staff are extremely helpful and knowledgeable.

Overall I found Orchard Rd fantastic - I'm more of a budget shopper so I found myself at Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza more often. Lucky Plaza has a flea market (called 'Flea Party') on the top floor just next to Jolibee and we snagged some great clothes for <$5 AUD apiece. Make sure you Google this and check when they're on as the dates and venues tend to change."
,,High end shopping at its best!,5.0,,"Crowded yes, but all the high end brands are here. A nighttime stroll is especially nice. Apart from clothing retailers, there are also lots of great dining options hidden away within the shopping galleries. An example is Din Tai Fung Chinese restaurant within Paragon - voted in the top 10 restaurants in the world by New York Times in 1993."
,,Take your credit card,5.0,,if you like shopping then this is a total must! every designer shp i can think of and then some more!
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"High end, low end and everything in between! Amazing sights and sounds along with some great value local food courts.This time of year is very hot but you can go underground and a lot of the centers are linked and air conditioned! crowded but everything moves along easily. Like most of Singapore if you eat in restaurants and like a beer its expensive so try the local food which is fresh and cheap!"
,,Shop 'til you drop,4.0,,"I'm a typical man so I won't be gushing about any shopping mall on the planet, but suffice it to say, Orchard Road is a world class shopping experience that stretches almost 2 kilometres.

Easy to access by foot and public transport, this is the perfect way to spend a balmy, humid day in air conditioning gawping at the latest fashion and bling. Cafes and restaurants are aplenty too, so grab your wallets and enjoy the experience. This is definitely a shopper's nirvana."
,,Huge variety of shops,4.0,,Definitely a shop till you drop location. Having not visited Orchards Road since the eighties the changes were mind boggling.
,,Like a therapy.. shop shop shop!,5.0,,Time flies on the Orchard road.. You can simply do window shopping at all those amazing shops of great brands..
,,Fascinating,5.0,,We are staying in at hotel at one end of Orchard Road so we are regularly walking along it. Lots of big expensive shops and cafes.
,,Orchard Road = SHOPPING!,5.0,,"We visited December and we were surprised there were lots of sale, one mall after the other! Then when one gets tired of shopping just enjoy the Christmas decorations outside and inside the malls, along orchard road!"
,,Crazy busy at Christmas time,4.0,,Stay away if you cant handle crowds. This place is teeming with people. At night the Christmas lights are fantastic and the Malls tend to compete with their Christmas decorations. Very festive and street entertainment in the evening. This place is very busy and crazy. Be prepared for crowds in December/early January.
,,Great shopping and dining street!,5.0,,"You can find almost anything along Orchard Road. From international to local brands, from clothing to household items... there are cinemas, spa outlets, bookstores... cafes, food courts and Michelin Star restaurants too. Great place for the locals and tourists, suitable for all ages!"
,,Shopping for everyone,4.0,,"This shopping district has something for everyone and never stops.....If you like to shop allow plenty of time as it is an entire street with high end shops down to everyday shops, enjoy"
,,Malls malls and malls,3.0,,I dont know why this street is very famous while it has only malls scattered on both sides. iON and iSetan are both the most famous and most crowded of them all. For walking I prefer China Town or Marina Bay area rather than Orchard Road. Better view and better experience.
,,Shopping wonderland,5.0,,Orchard Road has some 34 separate shopping malls and to do justice to them all would probably take you a week. You can get everything from a really good cheap lunch for two for a fiver to the most expensive handbags and fashions - often within a few years of each other. Christmas lights there are also really spectacular. Easy to access on the MRT. Also plenty of hotels all around this area.
,,Retail therapy heaven,4.0,,Orchard Road is great for a retail therapy fix - particularly if you are into Designer labels and have the wallet to match. Personally I'm a bargain hunter and even though it was between Christmas and New Year I certainly didn't see any good deals. However a must for browsing and checking the shops out.
,,Unlimited Shopping,5.0,,Be sure to carry enough money if you are going with your wife. Lots of branded showrooms and malls. You just wont have enough of it !!
,,Wonderful street,5.0,,"Was a great place to shop, specially charles & keith :-) you can find all the famous brands and some local once as well. Great place for foodies as well as this place is full of amazing restaurant's and food court's. A must visit specially if you are here during Christmas."
,,amazing shopping malls very upmarket,4.0,,"there are amazing shopping malls all very upmarket. also try Jamie oliver restaurant near Hilton hotel it is scrumptious as is the hard rock café same area, that is if you want a break from Asian food"
,,Most lit up Street,5.0,,"This is a good place to visit with family and children eventhough there is alot of shopping to do, having a look at the street is a wonderful way to spend time in Singapore especially Christmas time where is so beautiful to walk around."
,,Paradise for Shopaholics!,5.0,,"This road is simply a shopping paradise! Hundreds of shops locate along the road, as well as countless underground malls and arcades, with food courts and stalls spreading over the area. A huge range of service providers ranging from high fashion brands, local labels, to Michelin-star restaurants, mid-priced food places, supermarkets, cinemas, bookshops, stationery, bakery, coffee shops, bars. The list just goes on and on. A must-go place for shopaholics and foodies."
,,Bustling shopping avenue,4.0,,This is but one of the premiere places to shop from in Singapore as the store count is very high and one can take advantage of numerous sales. It is also well connected to the SMRT and bus routes.
,,Shopping variety unparalleled anywhere,5.0,,"2 kms from end to end - up one side an down the other with plenty of eateries on the way. Mall after mall after, most of which also have supermarkets in their basements if you are staying locally or need a chemist. Takashimaya is probably the most exclusive and extensive department store, tho; CK Tang is good too. in case you don't know, you can get a tourist refund when shopping over $100 but you must have your actual physical passport (not a phone copy) to get it. A special treat is the Peking Duck restaurant on level 7 of the Orchard Central Mall (181 Orchard near the tourist offices)."
,,Fantastic road...,5.0,,"We stayed at the Orchard Hotel at the start of Orchard Road so we got to walk the length and breadth of it. Full of amazing and beautiful stores, restaurants and cafes and, as it was Christmas, it was decorated to the max, but incredibly tasteful. Shops range from H&M to Cartier :)"
,,shop till you drop,5.0,,there is every shop you could dream of along this never ending road. easy to get disorientated when you descend some of the escalators and find yourself in even more shopping malls beneath the roads
,,Alot to shop,5.0,,Nice place to be to shop Nicely decorated during xmas Was crowded when we were there Not suitabke with small children
,,Shopping in a garden city,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the place that I go to whenever I want to do some shopping. There are many malls lined on both sides of the road.

I usually start my shopping from Wheelock Place (the Zara outlet there is less crowded than the one in Ion) and go down one side of the street to Ion (high end fashion brands from ground to 3rd floor and high street brands from basement 1-3 and food in Basement4), Wisma Atria (new Japanese food town and food court on 4th floor), Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya departmental store, Tiffany, Cartier, etc). These 3 malls are linked via an underground passage way and is linked to Orchard MRT station.

From Takashimaya, you can walk to H&M flagship store in Singapore (just pass Mandarin Orchard Hotel) to 313 Orchard and Orchard Gateway and cross the road to Centrepoint (Metro Departmental Store and grocery store Cold Storage) Or you can cross the road from Ngee Ann City to either Paragon (high end brands like Gucci, Tods and high street brands like Banana Republic, Guess, Esprit and Cold Storage) or Hereen (Robinson Departmental Store). If you loop back to the direction of Orchard MRT, you will also come across Tangs (a local departmental store, their 4th floor sells mostly Singapore and Asian designer stuff). There's many shops and if you are seriously into shopping, you can spend the entire day in Orchard Road.

Below lists the malls nearest to MRT stations:

Orchard MRT - Wheelock Place, Ion, Tangs, Wisma Atria, Paragon, Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya)

Somerset MRT - 313 Orchard, Orchard Gateway, Centrepoint, H&M flagship store, Hereen

City Hall - Raffles City

Please remember to wear comfortable shoes :D"

,,Shop until you drop!!!,4.0,,"Have traveled to most major cities throughout the world and have never seen anything like this .

Th wide boulevard is lines with multistory malls from one end to the other ( approx )
1 mile. Although mostly there is a huge presence of ultra high end designers in each mall, there are enough modest shops to keep u busy and happy.

Hope this review was helpful."
,,Good view during xmas,4.0,,"Went by taxi to see ""the tube"". Has a lot of shops. Had pretty decorations, floors with colored lights, giant shoe, xmas decorations."
,,Too rich for my wallet,3.0,,"Once the tourist mecca of Singapore, Orchard Road has become millionaire's row. Gucci, Prada, Chanel, etc etc... If you want bargains, you're on the wrong street."
,,Family of 5 adults,5.0,,So many shopping malls and the christmas decorations were excellent. I remember orchard road in 1970/1971 when it was nothing like it is today.
,,Top convenience and plenty to shop and eat,5.0,,"Orchard gateway is amazing!! This Is a relatively new underground shopping connector between a couple of shopping building from centrepoint station.

It was raining for the few days of our stay at orchard. We never had any trouble getting out for a quick meal or visiting the shops. Food is plenty and affordable. We even ducked out for a quick supper when the children were asleep with grandparents!"
,,Shops shops shops,4.0,,"Hundreds maybe thousands of shops from one end east to west side. Around 4-5 km street surrounded by hotels, malls, plaza from new to the existing oldies. Food & bars are spreading here. Branded to casual goods and items are here to choose. It's a heaven for shoppers. Many tourists & locals are here."
,,The Golden orchard mile.,5.0,,"Start at ION and make your way down fantastic shopping and food on orchard road. You can do this inside in AC comfort or outside from block to block. Food galore, merchandise galore....just keep going...."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,Well..... it's an area of Singapore surrounded with Malls ..... Many high end stores and some regular ones ..... for the regular joe like myself.... I would advise Vivocity
,,Shopping and eating paradise,5.0,,There are so many shops and restaurants you can visit made this Orchard Road precinct a haven for visitors. Even food court cuisine are of very acceptable standard and prices very reasonable
,,Shoppers paradise.,5.0,,"From high end stores to massive department stores orchard road has something for every shopper.

The size and scale of the malls is mind boggling - story upon story of boutiques, food and retail overdose.

Throngs of people too.

Take your credit card but set a budget!"
,,"Many malls similar, but lots to do!",4.0,,"Many of the malls have the same high-end outlets (Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton etc) and unless you're into that, it can be a bit monotonous and feel a bit like a big duty-free airport. Lucky Plaza is in the middle of the strip and is a more ""old-fashioned"" with more affordable gifts, phone accessories, cheap sunglasses etc.

Head up the IONsky (find the entrance on level 4 on the ION mall) is free and an amazing view. The food markets at the bottom of many of the malls are great for access to a wide variety of traditional Singaporean foods. The pick of the food courts is Tang's.

There's free Wifi available in most of the malls that is of pretty good standard - certainly enough for a VoIP phone call home while you're wandering."
,,If you like shopping,3.0,,"The best window shopping street in Singapore. It's not all top end merchandise, there are some bargain shops (not many). To kill some time it's not a bad idea to have a stroll around there. However I think Bond Street/Mayfair in London is better, if window shopping is your thing"
,,Fun but chaotic at the weekend,4.0,,"We walked along Orchard Road on a Saturday afternoon, which must be the busiest time of the week, as it was chaotic! Great to people watch and see all the amazing shops and malls. i didn't get a real feeling of Singapore here but it was still a fun place to visit."

,,Shopping strip,4.0,,"Wonderland of lights, glitz 😎 glam and big brands... This is the ultimate shopping destination in Singapore but beware, nothing comes cheap here... Heaven for Window shoppers...."
,,If you like uber-luxe International Brands...,4.0,,"Beautifully decorated for Christmas and very crowed, the Orchard Road shopping area is a fun place to go.... but... all of the malls are cookie cutters... all have the same super luxury international brand names and none of any store with local flavor. Sad that they have all been taken over and redesigned. The Ion Mall is super luxe. Store are all the same but there are some very good restaurants, mostly Chinese that are fun to eat eat. Lots of dim sum as well as full meals."

,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"Shopping for the likes of DIOR. Louis Vitton, Chanel, Tiffany etc. is what shopping is about. The thing is the hidden gems located within the high end shopping. The mini plazas provide further opportunities for your dollar to stretch even further. There is a buzz about this place akin to shopping at Oxford Street in London. Well worth the visit."
,,Shopping shopping shopping,5.0,,Basically don't come here if you don't like shopping or walking. All the big name brands and heaps of designers.

,,Christmas Light Spectacular,5.0,,"The Christmas Lights here are a must to see as well as the shopping centres. They are all amazing.

They have all the known brands spread in one huge street and over various centres. All malls are linked via underground tunnels and before you know it you may have covered 4 centres.

The MRT trains are great for getting around and we also used taxi's which we found were very cheap."
,,Orhard Road - a night time blaze of colour,5.0,,"Last night (29th Dec) after dinner nearby, my local friend and I wandered along Orchard Rd from Scotts Rd to 313@Somerset to enjoy the Christmas lights and displays and the decorated retail stores and buildings.

There were street entertainers and buskers every twenty or so metres.

We were joined by thousands of locals and international visitors doing the same - the displays are great. After visiting Singapore many times this is the first time I've absorbed the night time colours and activities at Christmas/New Year.

We thoroughly enjoyed the walk - if you are in Singapore don't miss Orchard Rd at night."
,,Highest Density Of Designer Stores,5.0,,"This is the first time that I have seen multiple Hermes, Tiffany, Rolex, Cartier etc stores in less then 1 mile. As expected the shops are quiet expensive at least for us using UK pounds."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"A great place to shop out of the heat. Lots of connected shopping malls with a full selection of shops and restaurants to suit all budgets. Start at B4 for the cheaper stores. The higher you go, the more you pay!"
,,just another glitzy shopping throughfare,3.0,,"I am 24 and I dont get what the buzz with Orchard is all about. Sure you can catch up with the latest in fashion trends and dine and wine like no tomorrow but for me, it's not a must visit. Far more captivation and significant places in Singapore."
,,Shopping Eating and more Shopping!,5.0,,Super deals at Lucky Plaza. Walk up and down this road for fantastic deals and lovely eats. Wear good walking shoes as there is a lot to cover.
,,Shopping malls everywhere!,5.0,,"I grew up in SIngapore near Orchard Road so I used to know this street inside and out. However, since I moved to the US and have lived here for over 20 years, a lot has changed. I go back every year for Christmas with my family and I tend to go along Orchard every day that I am visiting Singapore. I mostly stay on the Shaw House Lido Cinema side of the street, frequenting Ion, Tangs and Takashimaka. It is so nice to have underground walkways between these shopping malls (or centers) so you don't have to walk in the heat. All 4 of the complexes have great food courts where you can eat until you are stuffed. You can also shop at the expensive designer stores in any of them. I believe there are 2 Louis Vuittons between the 4 shopping malls. Along Orchard Road, keep an eye out for ice cream vendors around lunch time. You can get yummy ice cream sandwiches for S$1.20 and if you are lucky, you can get 4 different flavor mini scoops in a cup.

My family and I walked along Orchard on Christmas night and it was so crowded, even though it was raining and 10pm. Nothing stops people from coming out to see the lights!"
,,Very good but prohibitively expensive,5.0,,This street is packed with malls and shops. You can find anything under the sun here but its not for middle class shoppers. Its prohibitively expensive. Otherwise its another must visit if you are a shop-a-holic. Carry lots of money ;). Singapore is not a very kind country for bargain hunters and normal middle class shopping. Its all either very low market (lucky Plaza) or then Luxury.
,,Singapore's equivalent to Oxford Street,4.0,,"Ok, this road is huge and is the equivalent to London's Oxford Street boasting multiple cafes, bars, restaurants, tourist traps, agencies and far too many shipping malls.

Due to its length, there are nice parts and not-so-nice parts, but as a tourist it's most definitely worth strolling along for an hour or so (especially at Christmas, CNY or Devali, when you can see all the lovely lights and decorations).

Malls of note are: Ion (very posh shops), 313@Somerset (famous, if not a bit fatigued), Plaza Singapura (nice, large mall, lots of options, and located on top of one of the largest subway interchanges). There is also the President's house which you can walk past (only open to the public a few times per year).

If you're a tourist, it's definitely worth the stroll - but resist the urge to hit up Starbucks respite and aircon for a more local flavor Kopitiam or at least a Coffee Bean!"
,,Absolutely Amazing,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a must do! Even if it is to walk down the road. The Christmas Display is amazing, so many shops have participated it is great to see. So many shops as well! Great to window shop at all your high end stores or shop if you can afford it! Absolutely well worth a stroll down."
,,If shopping is your thing...,4.0,,If shopping and crowds is your thing then this high street is the place to be. Filled with all the usual high end stores.

,,Love it,5.0,,When visited orchard road i have seen the real singapore. And that was on christmas day where we have enjoyed the music and christmas spirit
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Always crowded but a really great place for shopaholics. I prefer to shop at 10.30am when the stores open and it is reasonably quiet. There are a good mix of high end retailers and some less expensive stores.I find Metro department store very good for shoes.

This visit I also did an evening visit as the Christmas lights and they were spectacular."
,,Best and Most Famous Attraction of Singapore !!,5.0,,"This is one of the best attractions here in Singapore and can take a whole day or two to explore the whole are. Lots of malls and shopping options. And the lighting during the evening is excellent, especially during any of the public holidays (e.g. Chinese New Year, Diwali or Christmas). And of course, all this is totally free !!!"
,,Super crowded on weekends and public holidays!,4.0,,"I prefer to go on weekdays, can shop leisurely without squeezing with other people. But if you want to see and be seen, go on weekends and public holidays!"
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,An unmissable retail experience! So many shops and shopping malls it would take you weeks to experience them all. There are shops here for every pocket from top quality luxury goods to the usual high street outlets. A real retail experience not to be missed!
,,It was calm.,4.0,,"My hotel was near this area and we were walking in the evening and at night. As The January was coming , so the shops were being ready for it."

,,Shopping Spree !!,4.0,,Its christmas celebrations on the globe so Orchard road was no exception ...loveley decorations & loaded shops ....shop or not you can be there on the Orchard road .
,,Great christmas lights,4.0,,Orchard rd has some very exclusive shopping and for christmas they light up the entire street with wonderful xmas lights. Some of the individusl shops like louis vuitton had their own window displays & there was a large area for childrens entertainment. There were huge crowds on Christmas Eve but it was good fun and very pretty
,,Shoppers paradise,3.0,,"It's pretty much the same shops you see anywhere in the world, sometimes repeated in the same block. Lucky Plaza is good for cheaper souvenirs and lunch in the food court.
It can be hard to cross to find somewhere to cross the road but taxis are plentiful (except when it's raining)."
,,Christmas lighting at Orchard,4.0,,All the malls and building were decorated nicely. My toddler had a great time strolling along the street... pointing delightfully at reindeers and santa. There were also many activity booths for bigger kids and christmas carolling along the street.
,,Great fun; high end shops and fine places to eat; use Subway to access,5.0,,"The Orchard Road location was well known to us as we lived and worked in Singapore. Very high end shops, terrific Japanese huge stores like Takashimaya, and plenty of tourists. Be careful about ""good deals"" found in the stores. You really need to be somewhat experienced about fair prices and also negotiating when it comes to goods in the stores. (Does not apply to big box stores or restaurants).
Note also that many stores are run by Chinese Singaporeans....wonderful people. If you find something that you really want in a particular store, make sure you notice location of item and the store and then MAKE sure you are first in line the next morning into the store. You can then walk to the item you are interested in and begin the negotiation. The store owners expect this...to a fault. However, be prepared to walk out of the store if you don't get your price. I'd recommend you do exactly that. The store owner will follow you to make the sale. Old proverb: if the store owner makes a sale to the first customer, that day will be most successful! Play it right and you'll get your deal."
,,Do your research!!,4.0,,"Okay, so this place is insane... It is a maze of shops on both sides of the street, but then go underground and you get 4 more levels of shops and eateries and Transport. It is incredibly easy to get lost on Orchard Road. You can't just cross the street either, you have to go under or over, so do your research!!! We went in December, so if you like Christmas lights, go see this place at night. It's Christmas on steroids!!!"
,,Lots of Christmas lights to see,4.0,,We stayed in a hotel at the top of Orchard Rd. We enjoyed our wander down Orchard Road at night and seeing all the lovely lights hanging over the road and decorating the shops etc. Very pretty
,,Christmas Time Driver Through,3.0,,"There is a lot of hype worldwide on the Christmas time decorations on Orchard Road and thus we did a special drive through on our return from the Singapore Night Safari.

However much to our disappointed there was nothing extraordinary except for the continous decoration of the two reindeers the entire road and the other decorations on the two sides.

Overall the decorations were nice and beautiful but nothing extraordinary or above the norm anywhere close to what is spoken in social circles about Orchard Road at Christmas time !"
,,"Orchard Rd is right in Singapore, MRT is close by.",5.0,,"Third time to Singapore in 4 yrs ,first time stayed a little further up the far end of Orchard Rd, Second time Clarke Quay area this was a little far out for us ,this time right on Orchard Rd ,everything was so close ,MRT close by and is so easy to use and get around
Underpasses to get from one side of the road to the other Shopping was straight out the hotel.."

,,Must visit if because it is shopper paradise,5.0,,The most interesting part of Orchard Road is from Somerset MRT station to Orchard MRT station. And the most interesting mall is Takasimaya SC. Atria Mall is not bad. Outside entertainment during festival like Christmas is not bad.

,,A great place to shop and feast,5.0,,"As a frequent traveller I have visited most of the capital cities in Asia, and on a regular basis.
Orchard Rd is a wonderful shopping belt in Singapore for quite a number of reasons
1. Sunny warm weather and you can pack lightly here in preparation for your shopping trip - temperature varies from 24-33 degrees , December to February are the cooler months
2. Safety for everyone, especially lone women Travellers - we have extremely Low crime rates, and we are one of the Asian countries with Many working women who shop, eat and pay on their own
3. Great range of brand name shopping - you am wit we have it
4. Local designers galore- world class designs at affordable prices try Orchard Central mall/ Tangs superstore for their local range
5. You really feast here, as we have 6 major ethnic groups here; Chinese, Malay, Indian , Eurasian, Caucasian and Peranakan cuisines. All at high standards as the locals have fussy palates, plus affordable pricing, prices start from USD 2 for a set meal in a food court to of course Michelin-starred joints!"
,,Nicer Xmas decoration this year!,4.0,,"I like this year Xmas decorations along Orchard Road, especially the underwater theme of Orchard Gateway. The food court at Takashimaya basement is always very crowded but I like to eat there as wide variety of food and reasonable prices for Orchard area. Not much discount though for shopping at the malls during this festive season."
,,The shopping street of singapore,5.0,,"This stretch of road is famous for the high end brands, yet caters for mid and mid-low end products for wide range of shoppers. Definitely a must visit."
,,Christmas season,4.0,,Walk along Orchard road during Christmas brings you a joy during this festive season Shopping is good if you are a branded person
,,Christmas decoration,5.0,,Visited this road just before Christmas and I must see the decoration along the road is the best I have seen for a long time
,,Singaporeans favorite pastime must be shopping,4.0,,"Pricing also makes you understand why Singaporeans traveling so much to neighboring countries to shop more. Today, Orchard Road is flanked by iconic shopping malls, restaurants and hotels, choc-a-bloc with retail, dining and entertainment choice for almost every taste and budget."
,,Just Ok,3.0,,"To be honest, I didn't really enjoy China town but it seems it is one of those things that every tourist has to tick. Maybe it is because it was a very hot day and we had been on the hop on hop off bus for sometime."
,,The life of Singapore,5.0,,"Buzzing with people and high street shops, a must do in Singapore is to walk through Orchard street and its ever sweeter during Christmas! There are pockets for street shopping as well as buying gifts or souvenirs. Should plan to visit in the evening as the streets light up! There are plenty of shops and they sell all kinds of things!"
,,nice place to go around during christmas,4.0,,"a lot of shopping and christmas decorations will make the evening good, also try the ice cream sold by locals carts in bread."
,,The permanent party place,4.0,,"One of my favorite things in Singapore is to walk down Orchard Road, enjoy the buzz, the lights, windows, food, shopping, street shows, music.. you have it all. Especially pretty during Christmas."
,,If you want it then it is likely here,4.0,,"Shopping, food, malls, shopping, food ,malls, shopping, shopping, shopping, food, shopping, food and shopping malls."
,,More to Orchard Rd than meets the eye,4.0,,"Orchard Rd is central city or the tourist trap for some. It is lined by the main shopping complexes and outlets in Singapore It has the modern, the ancient and oriental feel all mixed into one massive experience.
However there is more to Orchard Rd beneath the surface. The subway (MRT) has its exits from the underground stations but many other subtaerrean tunnels over various levels that are lined by shops and massive plazas. It's a bit like an Iceberg - there is lots more below the surface"
,,Christmas on a great Street,5.0,,"There were so many shops/stores for all budgets. You would need a good pair of walking shoes to do the whole street. From mid November onwards all buildings and the street are lit up with Christmas Decorations, with a competition being held for the best decorated. A must do if visiting Singapore"
,,Disappointed in fraser mall centre point promotion,3.0,,"Christmas is always the season of giving.
To spend $180 in fraser mall centre point you can purchase a luggage at $10.
So we waited as the promotion start on the 10dec. We spend $180 we buy the luggage at $10
They have different color each week.
On the 17th dec we went shopping again and spend $140 in order to buy the luggage we spend $40 more to make up to $180. Only to find out that the luggage is fully redeem.at the information counter on the 3rd level . But tomorrow which is 18th dec they have a new color blue luggage . We were very disappointed, couldn't they just allow us to buy the blue luggage since we have spend $180. ? The answer is no it only start tomorrow, here you have promotion and there you don't have customers service. Very inconsiderate.
And no one mention that the luggage is full redeem until you visit the information counter run by the mall. So so disappointed."
,,The most like place in Singapore,4.0,,"It's my most like shopping place in Singapore. There are lots of branded and fine dine in. But don't hang out there on Sunday. If don't believe it, just go and try on that day."
,,Not the meeting place it used to be.,3.0,,"I have been coming to Singapore for more than 20 years. About 10 years ago with the expansion of MRT and the population, new shopping areas and interesting spots started taking business away from Orchard Road.
Orchard Road is still a good place to window shop and see the Christmas lights, but with the overcrowding, it has lost some of its allure from years past."
,,The Main Shopping Drag,4.0,,This is the main upscale shopping district of Singapore where you will find all the major brands and nice places to eat.
,,All your shopping needs in one.,4.0,,"Presents, groceries, drinks, clothes... literally everything you need is on this road. Recently made a few trips here to buy Christmas Presents and it was so easy - lots of choice for all budgets and age groups. Lots of sales on.

i prefer to frequent Plaza Singapura as it is more like a shopping centre and so feels like there are less people around in comparison to ION or on the street. There are some nice cafes in Somerset, the department stores are always a good choice and Lucky Plaza for your cheap needs or money exchange.

Loads of buses and bus stops as well as the Red MRT line so easy to get to. Wear comfy walking shoes!"
,,"Fun, shopping, music",5.0,,"Christmas is in the air. Everyone's in a festive good mood. Decorations along orchard rd are a must see. Loud Music is played to the masses. Victoria secret just launched their new big facility to project New York style runway feel. Streets are crowded.
Orchard rd is the must see street with tons of malls interconnected at street level and basement levels. Many different types of food to sample especially at the Japanese malls."
,,Shopping haven 👠👡👞🎒👝👛👜,4.0,,"Having visited Singapore numerous times we often find Orchard Road good for some retail therapy. It was especially fun this time as all the department stores were competing against each other with their Christmas decorations.

However for shopping lovers head over to Marina Sands Bay as it's fabulous if looking for designer labels."
,,Almost too much to take in,4.0,,"This is shopping paradise from high end stores to bargain basement outlets and is especially good for electronics and fashion. The road itself stretches for a couple of kilometres and requires huge stamina to try to cover all the stores to visit. The MRT stop is central though.

Bring lots of money - you're going to need it"
,,Shoppers Paradise!,4.0,,It's a Shoppers Paradise. Home of all branded stores. But nothing you haven't seen before. The Christmas decoration is amazing.
,,X'mas Land - Oxford Street of Singapore,5.0,,"Herald in the festive spirits and moods of the holiday seasons along Orchard road.

Branded goods of Cartier Chanel LV Gucci Ferragamo the list is endless in ION, Takashimaya and Paragon. All guaranteed and no fakes.

After satisfying your shopoholic purchases numerous int'l restaurants of your choice are waiting to serve you.

After a sumptuous dinner walk down slowly and enjoy the festive lights and photoshop your memorable holidays.

It is a yearly festive fare so hurry to my garden city."
,,Funvee Christmas Trip,4.0,,"Go out with neighbours for Christmas trip via Orchard road on opened top double deck bus. The trip covers from Tanglin road towards Orchard road. Tanglin mall attracts many people especially the kids as it has a artificial snow created.
Next Ion mall towards Taka mall also attracts many youngsters with waiting to takes photos of friends or themselves. This part also has some performances carry on, making it with a more Christmas festive atmosphere.
Counterpoint is the next place with many photographers taking photos as the place is voted the most designed Christmas decorations.
Also the whole orchard shopping belt is lighted with blue & white Christmas decorations."
,,Feels like you're in Europe/USA,5.0,,Excellent road for shopping.. All the best brands of the world can be found over here.. Very clean and tidy place too.. A must visit even if you don't want to do shopping..
,,great,4.0,,this is the best shopping destination in the world....has more options than any other place.... slightly expensive but you get all sorts of clothes - branded to china made stuff
,,Concrete shopping malls made in China,1.0,,"To fly 20 hours to come to a shopping mall with good made in China is not worth a trip. Interconnected tunnels, atriums, and concrete plazas sell different levels of mass produced goods, interrupted by chain restaurants that reflect the wallet of the potential buyers. Climate and light manipulated, humans can spend their time away from nature, sun, and local flair. Any strip mall fulfills the same requirements- only closer to home and even cheaper"
,,Very nicly decorated for Chrestmas,5.0,,Very good sales. The street is realy alive till very late night. shops are open. the street is very nice decorated
,,Christmas is coming,5.0,,"Orchard Road, Singapore's shopping street, is wonderfully decorated with Christmas lighting. To add to the street based decoration, each shopping centre is trying to outdo the rest as a street long competition is run for the best decorated shopping centre. They certainly are trying their best to win. Can you pick one? Decorations go up about mid November until Christmas."
,,Make sure your bank account is loaded,5.0,,"If you are wealthy then this is the place to shop. No concerns about counterfeit goods here. Hundreds of huge, name brand, high end stores. It's easy to walk around and as usual the MRT puts you right smack in the middle of the action."
,,Beautiful as expensive...,4.0,,Orchard is the shoppers paradise. Dozens of high end malls with all of the brands you can imagine and much more. Its a really expensive street but nothing in Singapore is Cheap!. Must walk Orchard Road!.
,,Amazing shopper paradise,5.0,,"Pretty much houses every international brand you can think of, premium restaurants and coffee stores...very goo led spot to get lot of things done in one place."
,,A visit to a different world,5.0,,"We always head to Orchard Road via the MRT which drops you in the middle near the Ion Centre which has some fascinating but expensive shops. Tangs is a favourite destination where you can window shop and actually shop for a number of fantastic things from makeup to household interior decorations and even pencil cases. Yes, there is Prada, Armani and Dior which are worth looking at through the windows ,but there is also Lucky Plaza with souvenirs, perfumes and money changers and plenty of cheap food courts to eat at. The Christmas Decorations are amazing and add character to Orchard Road."
,,Nice decoration on Christmas Eve,4.0,,"First visit to Singapore, went to the Orchard Road because it's famous as tourists area. Nice decoration at the street especially on Christmas Eve theme."
,,Great in all seasons,5.0,,"You can wonder around on the ground level or go down under the ground and simply walk around without having to cross the road regardless whether it is raining or not. Great shopping, excellent food and unusual sights."
,,Expensive street,3.0,,We took the bus tour down orchard road to see the many houses built many years ago. Some of the bungaloos are with 25 million dollars today because of the land.
,,Wonderful shopping strip,5.0,,"As a passing tourist you will certainly enjoy Orchard Road, the hot, bustling, and right now dazzling (with Christmas decor) shopping strip in Singapore.
Starting from the Scotts Road junction (Marriott, Isetan, Wheelock, Ion) all the way to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT right opposite the Plaza Singapura, you will need 2 or 3 trips if you really want to explore every fascinating corner.
There’s something for everyone, whatever your taste or budget. From Cartier and Prada to the more accessible local brands you only need to ask around. Everyone speaks English. The international brands are at Takashimaya, Ion, Tang’s, Robinson’s, etc. Local brands are at Metro, Lucky Plaza, 313, OG. Take a walk from the Taka basement level right to Ion shopping mall and the Orchard MRT. This is a fabulous maze of shops of all kinds, from t-shirts to handbags, shoes, make-up, cakes and sandwiches, anything....
Eateries are everywhere and you may well get the impression that people eat all around the clock. Take a break at the food basement in Takashimaya or the top level at Plaza Singapura or Centre Point. These food courts are where you can find a staggering diversity of snacks, meals and drinks (chinese, vietnamese, indian, japanese, thai and more). Coffee shops are hugely popular and new ones seem to sprout every day.
Be sure not to miss Emerald Hill, where you will see the beautiful old Peranakan houses, some with lovely frangipani trees in front. It is a piece of history in the midst of this ultra modern district."
,,Internationally Renown Avenue of Malls of Distinction,4.0,,"Linked and pivoted by MRT stations ... like Orchard, Somerset, Dhoby Ghaut, Raffles City stations.... and serviced by buses, Orchard Road is a straight stretch of road that is easily accessible.

Breathing 'Lifestyle', the scene is a flowing stream of evolving fashions and revolving fashionables. Grand hotels grace this famous tourist belt as do eating havens and...the Istana - the official residence and office of the President of The Republic of Singapore.

There is a Singapore Visitors' Centre and vintage Peranakan Place where Emerald Hill Road joins Orchard Road.

As a lure for tourists, the stately hotels, fine buildings and malls of distinction are all heady with distinguished pricing!
Well appointed interiors, well sourced merchandise impeccably displayed, dining options which are of the finest imaginable do not come cheap. Indeed, marveling at classy presentations and classic impressions - people watching and window browsing .... doesn't cost at all.

And you never know when a gem of a buy will set your heart a-fluttering. On Orchard Road, ""Shop Till You Drop"" isn't as far fetched as it sounds. Do get ready for that assault on your wallet.

Shopping in December brings buildings and malls decked to the nines in Yuletide splendor. Even the roads are decorated and lighted up for Christmas."
,,The Place to Shop!,5.0,,Great experience to visit all the big stores and main high end brands. Good also at Xmas time to see the lights! Pay a visit to the Burberry store which is amazing!
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,You can shop for anything from cloths to phones to gifts etc. And plenty of places to dine. You will need at least two full days to cover the entire area if you are a real shopaholic.
,,No kids/husband shopping,5.0,,"If you like shopping without the kids or husband, drop them off at orchard cineleisure before you hit the shops.They can see a movie and then go upstairs for hours of fun at Bounce."
,,Gorgeous Christmas Lights to add to Festive Cheer,4.0,,"Orchard Road at night in December is like a fairyland, so beautiful with the myriad Christmas lights. I went with my husband and even though it was drizzling, there were lots of people out walking along this strip. It adds to the festive cheer of the season."
,,Its madness but fun,4.0,,"I think its busier than ever. Lots of fab shopping, restaurants and all sorts of discoveries to make. But you have to dig deep. For some calm we ate lunch in the Dynasty Hotel on the corner of Scotts Rd - now called the Singapore Marriott. They have a stupendous buffet. Another day in one of the big centers on the corner of Scott's rd in the basement - we found a huge eating center with a tremendous choice of different Asian food styles. Excellent food and low prices. Wonderful.."
,,Love Shopping,5.0,,"Virtually every shop you can imagine for all budgets along this street. If you love shopping you will love Orchard Road. December is amazing as the Christmas lights are a massive attraction, making Oxford Streets lights in London look so boring!"
,,Beautiful and magical,4.0,,"Orchard Road looked beautiful and magical at night with its X'mas decorations. Nice wintry Xmas theme at night, in tropical Singapore. The shop fronts of Centerpoint and Orchard Central looks stunning ...... great effort made to project the Xmas spirit. Maybe the people at Gardens by the Bay, could learn from these guys on how to project the Xmas spirit. The décor at Gardens by the Bay was dismal."
,,I fall in love to shopping at here,5.0,,It's very cool place that hv many things that I want. Sneaker will love here have a lot. Im from Thailand that have few fashionable with sneaker in the shop so I can stay around here the whole day to burn my money. Lol
,,"Good for browsing, expensive for shopping",3.0,,"I was excited to be staying in a Orchard Rd and checking out the malls. While the variety of goods is fabulous it's an expensive city to buy anything. Every building seems to be a huge multi level department store with endless similar shops. Cafes are expensive so head down to the food courts in the buildings for more reasonably priced food. Mostly you have to cross Orchard Rd by overpass or underpass so it's a hike everywhere. So easy to get list, but just walk out any exit, catch a cab and go, they are so cheap."
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,Many shopping centres located in town. Many restaurants and cafes to choose from. Very conveniently located.
,,Amazing lighting,4.0,,"We visited especially to marvel at the lights.
Once the night starts setting in the whole street lit up with a plethora of lights displays and music. There were photos opportunities a plenty and a feeling of joy and emotion. The area was very friendly as well as being frantic and manic at the same time. Too many displays to mention but you must visit before Christmas to appreciate all the effort that goes into this."

A place to visit to soak in the festive spirit and jostle with the crowds as they go about their shopping or just window shop. Have a drink at the many cafes while people watching. Expensive with not as much bargains but still nice to experience the festive mood."
,,Lots of shops and Malls but not enough places to stop for a Tiger beer,3.0,,"So many shops and so few places to rehydrate with a Tiger beer. Where have all the bars gone? If you like shopping then you might enjoy this road but for me after half an hour, I have seen enough."
,,Vibrant street,4.0,,shoppers paradise. this street houses the best malls and brands in the city. great eating joints and the christmas decoration was superb. Lit up and beautiful at night. You can walk the entire street over many days and explore different eateries and malls. Its centrally located.

There are choices galore in the restaurant category too. Most star rated restaurants can be found on the Orchard Street. Your trip is not complete without a round on this street."
,,Decor turns this shopping paradise into a photographers heaven,5.0,,"The glam of orchard road is not hidden from any one.

,,So pretty in December,5.0,,"We stayed on Orchard road in December and it was so festive! They compete for best lights and the shopping centres look fantastic. The whole street is lit up, so exciting at this time of the year. And if you are a runner the Singapore Marathon starts here."

From plenty of designer brands, cheaper mainstream stores and grocers, restaurants, cafes and bars. The whole street lights up beautifully at night, particularly this time of year where each mall seems to be having a competition for best Christmas frontage.

If you get a chance, would recommend a quick detour down emerald hill road for a drink in one of the bars overlooking old Chinese style terraces (some of the oldest in Singapore)."
,,Shopping paradise a mile long,5.0,,"Lots of shopping at malls, department stores with local/foreign goods and branded brands like here in the US. You can shop till you drop.

That surprised me!"

It is a must visit and you need to have some time, say half day to fully enjoy it. The things are expensive and you can bargain at a few places.
Singapore's orchard road has lost some charm in the last few years and now everything available here is also available at many other places. It is expensive as well.

I remember being here a few years ago around Christmas and that time this was a place to be in evenings and late evening. It probably still is and winter and Christmas is around.
So, do stop by if you are in city."

Mrs Joey generously showed us places to visit and on how to get there. we opted for a 2 day Hop-on-hop off Bus tour which is a great Chance to see the City.

My wife however likes the original market type shopping and when we were there made a visit to Bugis Street which she enjoyed very much
,,A Place to shop.,4.0,,I came here many times before. But this time I came here because I want to buy some gifts in Plaza Singapura. It's still a nice place to shop and visit while in Singapore specially closer to Christmas because the road is decorated with Christmas lights which makes it nicer.

There are also a number of more modest malls featuring bargain electronics and low-cost easting establishments."
,,"Stuff, stuff and more stuff!",4.0,,"We walked along the road and visited several high-end places and one centre which catered more for local folks.
Every brand name you can think of is represented on Orchard Road, and even on Sunday afternoon it was packed.

If your aim in visiting Singapore is to buy stuff, this is the main place!"
,,Not Very Suitable for Rainy Days,3.0,,"Been three times to Orchard. (Un) fortunately we came during heavy rains. Mall(s) was packed with people. Food court also full and full.

,,"Great, if you like shopping....",3.0,,"I mean, if you're really into shopping, this is the street to go to in Singapore. If you have more money than sense, then certainly go to the many malls on Orchard Road.

For us, it was not that impressive. The shops are all designer brands and too expensive. In terms of sightseeing there is nothing to see, just malls and shops. But, Singapore is full of shopping malls, and this is just a street full of them."
,,Just like any other big shopping mall,3.0,,This is a big shopping all with all international brands across categories. Nothing exceptional. Good shopping destination for branded shopping
,,Not impressed,3.0,,Nothing is open until 11 am!!! very disappointing when you have limited time and have to choose where you are going to spend it.

,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"Neat & clean road , both sides are lined with a number of malls. Nice pavements on both sides for walking."
,,Spend away,4.0,,Orchard road offers high end and budget shopping. The food is fantastic anywhere in orchard road as well. The great thing about Singapore is everyone speaks English and therefore there is no barrier language especially for us Aussies.

Other than that spend away!

For tourists from the region, this is sights and sounds a 'must visit'. However, with capital regions around asia and the western world lighting up as well, the novelty factor has disappeared

The nativity scenes i recalled from years gone in many countries have disappeared and people no longer know why christmas is celebrated !

Anyway enjoy the lights ! the decor this year is a bit subdued but that s my opinion"
,,Best place to shop,5.0,,"Lots of shopping mall along this street. Mostly from mid range to the high end.

,,Shopaholic's Paradise & More,5.0,,"When I'm in Singapore, three or four times a year (latest October and November 2016), I cannot miss a visit to Orchard Road, the shopping mecca of the city state. My personal favourites are Plaza Singapura, ION Orchard and Takashimaya. Been to others too, like the high-end Paragon to the seemingly rundown and low-end Lucky Plaza. Every time I visit I find time to discover something new. Three words of advice for first timers. One, try to score a map of some of the bigger centres like ION Orchard. If you don’t, you’ll lose your bearings. These places are like labyrinths (or worse still rabbit warrens). Two, you won’t see everything in one day. You’ll need to come back at some stage. It’s hard enough to shop in one department store or mall imagine a whole street of them! Three, if you’re not a shopaholic, just cruise around, maybe even stop to have a bite or a beer and enjoy the crowd. Prices are a little dearer but they won’t break the bank. Besides you’re there to enjoy."
,,Shoes & Clothes,5.0,,"Ion Orchard and Paragon are two places where I liked things to my taste, good merchandising and reasonable brands to buy from."

,,Shoppers' Paradise !,5.0,,"Singapore Orchard Road is the most hustle and bustle area of all the time. It has been another shoppers' paradise in South East Asia beside Bangkok. There are approximately 20 shopping centers on orchard road. My personal favourite shopping centers are ION Orchard, Wisma Atria, 313 @ Somerset, Plaza Singapura and Wheelock Place. Those shopping centers are more popular among teenagers and young people. The clothing in those departmental stores are update than anywhere in Singapore.
But when you dine any restaurant on Orchard Road, even the food in food court are more expensive than other place in Singapore. You will see many ice-cream carts selling by old people along the way of orchard road with umbrella."
,,Shopping spree street,5.0,,"The street is filled with shopping malls and luxury brands. If you want to shop expensive clothing, bags and shoes, you will get everything here. The street is also nice for window shopping and walking around. The street is already decorated for Christmas."

,,Shopping Heavens ^_^,5.0,,"Every time I visited Singapore, I wouldn't missed going here either to just window shop or be there for the sake of enjoying the ambiance especially during Christmas time. Shopping here is also very worthwhile during sale period. So many shops to go and lots of dining places to satisfy your hunger. You can find branded goods at a very affordable price."
,,Very expensive.,4.0,,I enjoyed walking on Orchard Road but the shops generally stock expensive branded merchandise. Still worth it to see the hustle and bustle and some nice coffee shops and a chance to get into air conditioning.
,,Lots of Shopping and Great Architecture,4.0,,"Orchard Road has a lot of high end shops, which you see mostly from the outside, but there's something for everyone as you walk around and check out all the different shopping area. Orchard Rd is quite a sight to see. The architecture of the buildings were amazing and the displays they had along the buildings and road were beautiful (we went in the middle of November, so they had Christmas decorations everywhere). Check out the different department stores and underground malls. You could easily spend the entire day doing Orchard Road, but if you just want to walk on the street to take in the sights, it's only about an hour's leisurely walk from end to end. If you get a chance, check out the golden orchids that Singapore is famous for. These are actual orchids dipped in 24K gold. You can find these on broaches and necklaces at Risis, which is inside Tang's Department Store."

,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"I love orchard road & it's a must place to visit when in Singapore!
With a family of two young kids we find it easier to stay at orchard road when vacationing in Singapore due to the ease of finding food & public transport.
My fav place to visit is ION & the basement level in Takashimaya (food market) where there's so many yummy treats!
Depending on how you shop, it can take you a few days to go through every shop or if you're a speed shopper like me, I can do it in one day ;)
Don't forget to try the ice cream with bread along the orchard strip, you can find a few vendors there!
Enjoy!"
,,Malls malls malls!,5.0,,"Famous with its luxury malls this place offers nothing but luxury shopping. If you wanna spend your time between Gucci, Prada shops thats the place , if not then it is waste of time visiting Orchard Road"
,,Huge Array of Shops to Meet Most Budgets,4.0,,Orchard Road has a huge array of shopping malls from up market named brands to more affordable smaller stores tucked in less prominent malls - but worth looking for as there are bargains to be had. We returned to a tailor in one of the smaller malls which we had visited some years ago and had silk jackets made and were able to also purchase there an elusive oval tablecloth for our table. Chinese tea served at another as we looked over and decided upon jewellery.
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,My wife and I walked up and down this road until we got tired. It is the street for shopping in Singapore. You will find all kinds of stores and restaurants. You can even have a tailored suit for less than $300.00.
,,Beautiful streets,5.0,,Its beautiful to roam around this street especially on Christmas time. Roads are decorated with hanging lights and colourful decorations. Beautiful showrooms and malls. Definitely a must have in singapore trip.

Christmas songs playing- lovely decorations everywhere. The night is magical - it's certainly is a must visit if only to see the decorations.
A Christmas shoppers paradise.."
,,Shopaholic,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the main shopping destination in Singapore. From cheap electronics at Lucky Plaza to all major designers from all over the world you will find them on orchard road. Beside shopping you should visit the 56th floor of ION Orchard, a shopping mall, its free and you'll enjoy a great view over Singapore."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"As soon as you set foot in Orchard Road, it becomes apparent why this is a signature location in Singapore. Shopping, displays, and surprisingly, room to move."
,,Shopping for electronics,4.0,,This street offers a wide variety of shops and excellent choice of electronics and Japanese department stores such as Takashimaya offers so many items from Japan and excellent food court. Highly recommend for any tourists.
,,Good shopping,3.0,,There are a lot of shops and shopping malls along this road with mainly high end designer stores so therefore prices are on the high side.
,,A shopping experience,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the principal shopping areas in Singapore. There is a huge array of various shops, restaurants and offices. There are many splendid bespoke tailors who are able to make suits and shirts within a day or so - no longer inexpensive but certainly well crafted & tailored."
,,It's like Makati in the Philippines,4.0,,A long stretch of road with high end shops. This is a busy road with foot traffic and it's just good to sit on one of the benches and watch people pass by.
,,Worth A Visit During the Christmas Festivities,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the upmarket shopping area of Singapore with shopping malls or arcades built all along the road with The Hilton thrown in. So if you are one of those who are on the lookout for luxury brands, just head there and you are sure to find your favourite brand.
Apart from these top rated brands, each mall has a food court where you can find cuisine from across the globe and that, in my opinion, makes this place a favourite with many tourists. Besides them, you can find your regular eatery and cafe chains like Starbucks, Haagen-Dasz, Costa Coffee, Burger King, KFC etc.
It also happens to be the main business district and is very crowded during the day time. In my opinion, you can easily spend a couple of hours strolling along the road in the evening even if you are not a shopaholic. You may also look to get a good ""Happy Hour"" deal at one of the bars close by. I happened to be here around the beginning of the festive season and got to see the amazing Christmas decorations on and along the road.
My Verdict: Go there, spend some time and decide for yourself."
,,A beautiful shopping area,3.0,,Seen one mall you have seen them all. There is an abundance of fashion and jewellery shops that are replicated in every mall you visit. Same same.

Loads of top brands like Gucci, Chanel, LV etc and also loads of more affordable shops like top shop, h&m, cotton on. You can literally find it all in orchard. Also plenty of restaurants. My fav would be brotzeit (German restaurant with great food & amazing beer) and ding tai Fong (top dim sum place) have fun!"
,,"Great shopping, easily accessible",5.0,,"Great shopping strip. Very easy to get to by taxi. Easy to walk street. Malls very clean, great facilities, each with their own distinctive character. Crossing street made easy by frequent light crossings and underground walkways connecting malls and hotels. Very wide range of shops, something for everyone. Overall a really good shopping experience. Can't wait to go back for more retail therapy!"
,,Lots of shopping,5.0,,Enjoyed shopping at all the malls and found lots of quirky shops as well. Lots of places to see and eat at. Busy most of the time but a lovely atmosphere at night with all the lights.

,,Fantastic Christmas decorations,5.0,,"Beautiful decorations this year, truly stunning! The road itself is a pleasure to walk at anytime and has shops galore covering everything you might want to buy at varying price ranges to suit everyone. Top designer labels sit along side cheaper tech and fashion stores. I reckon if you can't find something here in one of the numerous shops or vast malls then chances are it doesn't exist!"
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"This Orchard Road is full of shopping malls
You name it
You get it
From top of line to regular brands
This road serves you all
Plus the dinning options here are too good

Another catch is cineplex
Almost every second mall has cineplex with number of screens
It is almost a kilometer or bit more
But no one else you can such big range .....
I have been going to this road for last 22 years
And every next trip gives a new and fresh experience
I simply love this shopping boulevard ...."
,,Christmas Light-up at Orchard - Not to be missed,4.0,,"See the entire length of Orchard Road, Singapore's premier shopping district, dress up in resplendent twinkling lights and dazzling Christmas decorations. An annual glitzy affair. Not forgetting the retails therapy, this street is home to international brands."
,,Not so appealing these days. I'd rather visit the Heartlands.,3.0,,Shopping malls along this stretch of roads are becoming less frequented these days as more shopping malls are sprouting up in heartlands. It's worth a visit for food outlets / eateries but imho there's not much appeal to go into shopping malls along Orchard Road if you're into shopping.
,,Shopping galore!,4.0,,"If you love to shop then this is the place to do it. It is one long strip filled with many malls, stores and shops.

,,Fantastically Busy ! :-),5.0,,"We visited this incredible shopping area (a street of shopping malls !) whilst recently visiting Singapore. It was a hot day and Orchard Road was extremely busy when we were there .. we visited three or four of the massive shopping malls and eventually brought our shopping extravaganza to a halt due to the business of the area (extremely busy) and the heat and humidity of the weather. Orchard Road is an incredible `must see` in Singapore, it is vibrant with many many many shops and restaurants, and one day we will return, hopefully on a cooler and much less humid day !"
,,Shop til you drop without spending a dollar,4.0,,"There is every high end store here for you to peruse and shop should your budget allow. Walk down at sunset and enjoy the lights, glamour and glitz. For me looking in the windows gave me as much pleasure, so don't avoid Orchard Road just because you don't have too much to spend. Ensure you have comfy footwear because you will need it for this little adventure into Singapore's finest shoping area. However, if you are looking for a bargain, try Little India instead."
,,All you need of shopping,5.0,,An amazing stretched road that has major shopping malls among many many other shops and botiques. You can find everything you need from local brands to famous designers.
,,Orchard Road Singapore - 3 Kilometers (Less than 2 miles) of Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"This is my third year spending the fall semester teaching college business courses for the State University of New York in Singapore. I, along with several other professors, live at the ""far"" end of Orchard Road. By that, I mean we live at the end farthest from the central city area of Singapore. Our apartment is on Orange Grove Road, and we can walk down to Orchard Road in about three minutes.

You should visit Orchard Road at both ends, our ""far"" and, and down to the city end. Along the way, you will find luxury shopping, such as Ion Orchard Plaza and Ngee Ann City, and you will find more casual shopping, such as at Lucky Plaza. You will find food of every type, and entertainment, also of just about every type. From out end of Orchard Road to the city end, the walk is under three kilometers. It is worth the time to take the walk, and wander into the various shops and malls along the way. Walk during the day, and then come back and walk during the night.

During the Christmas holiday season, Orchard Road is lit from one end to the other. It is glorious. Take a bus at night from the ""far"" end (for example, from the Delfi Plaza stop). Get a double-decker bus and sit on the top level so you can see everything.

Give this a try and you will be amazed."
,,Posh Market place,5.0,,"The place is very nice full of top brands of around the world. Pricey place for shopping having goods value from 2000$ ++

,,Great place to shop and go for a walk,3.0,,"Orchard Road is home to an amazing number of malls/shopping centers. There is also a tourist information on Orchard.

,,The center of Singapore!,5.0,,"One will be surprised that there is more living and exciting energy below ground, There are at least 4 stories of shops and eateries under the ground that you never see from the street. Everything is open and very busy until 10 PM everyday to the week including Sunday. This area is like being in an airport with every company being represented that you have ever heard of."
,,Classy,4.0,,"A beautiful CBD as clean and as pretty as they come. Targeted towards high end shopping budgets, it is quite grandios with its large boulevards, majestic trees and shopping centres that were, thankfully, air conditioned. In fact my wife noticed how few people were out on the street. We figure it's because most people are taking advantage of the climate control available in the cbd.

Orchard Road can be seen in an hour or a few days, depending on the kind of holiday you are having. Our group found ourselves at the botanic gardens after about 90mins of browsing down the main part. Then onto the other cool parts of Singapore that are not actually in the CBD."
,,Busy thoroughfare especially on a Sunday,5.0,,Full of top range designer shops and outlets and local plazas whereyou can grab a bargain or two. The local Amahs meet up on s Sunday at the Lucky Plaza and Mount Elizabeth area and it can get very congested

,,Just another Shopping District,4.0,,"Bricks and mortar shopping centers are all very much alike around the asian Pacific and Orhcard row is very much in that flavor. Most common international brands can be found here and, as expected, prices don't really seem to vary these days from country to country. So, unless you are after something very Singaporean in flavor, its just as easy to do your shopping sat home. Of course, if you are a tall and large person like me (stay away from clothes and shoe shops as there will be nothing there for your size."
,,Looking for a designer this is the place for you,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the fashion hub of Singapore, can't think of any designer that doesn't feature here, of course if you have an abundance of cash or want to max out those cards that won't be a problem, however being a Scot I got just as much out of the window shopping experience and a cheeky photo or two of a couple of outfits to make myself.

,,Hip,3.0,,Lots of shops and malls. Food shops inside. Great for shopping especially if you like branded goods. But not as crowded as before and since it's my first time to visit in October ( since we always come here in December) I kinda miss the lights and displays donning the stretch of orchard.
,,How many shops is too many?,3.0,,"There are more shopping malls down this street than you can shake a stick at. Each is stuffed with shops. However, it is mostly expensive clothing and fashion goods along with restaurants from McDonald's upwards.

,,A hive of activity,4.0,,It is easy to get overwhelmed with the amount of shops along this strip but exciting and worth the visit.
,,Overhyped!,3.0,,"Orchard road being the "" central shopping destination "" in Singapore is loaded with malls and shops and eateries but in my opinion it is a little overhyped as every location in Singapore is actually loaded with malls and eateries 😊"
,,Lots of High end shopping outlets,4.0,,"This area has changed dramatically over the past years, Lucky Plaza once the place is now a little tired and a bit out dated , but still worth the time to look for bargains. Train to Orchard station and do one side of the road until you run out of shops , come back on the side . New shopping complexs with all the famous names and labels. These are nearly cities by themselves, Ngee Ann City, Tangs, Ion,The Forum. Most have vast displays and run specials at various times of the year. Large food courts and eateries, Fill in a day that the weather is maybe not good enough to go elsewhere , but expect crowds."
,,great tourist place,4.0,,"I went all around Singapore while I was there on business, but I did get to do many things. If you happen to go there, please make sure that you get out and see as much of the city as possible, you will not regret it!"
,,"Best shopping street in Singapore, but very expensive",5.0,,"So many malls on Orchard Street but a lot of repetition in each mall. Designer shops of clothes, watches, shoes, handbags and other stuff. Some malls remain on Orchard St where you can bargain and haggle prices like the East Asia at the top of Orchard St. Another in the infamous Four Floors of whores near the Orchard Hotel and Claymore Connection.
Watch yourself for Indian tailor shops on Orchard Road as almost all we encountered were rip off merchants. Stick to the known tailor shops associated with the hotelsto be safe."

On speaking to the people at the hotel, they said they were left in situation all year round!! Lots of great shops and shopping malls. A lovely area to explore."
,,Nice place for shopping,3.0,,"Lots of malls. But I still prefer suntec where everything is under one roof. Easier to move around.
If you want to shop premium brands, orchard is the place. They even have an Abercrombie and fitch. But everything in Singapore is a lot more expensive than other countries."
,,Standard Shopping Area,4.0,,Best place for high end shopping in Singapore. Be prepared to walk a lot! I prefer shopping in Eon Orchard and Takashimaya there.

,,High-end stores galore,3.0,,"If you are in to all the high-end name brands, this is the place for you. Personally, it is not my cup of tea. They did have some nice sculptures to see and in October were already decorating for Christmas."

,,wow,4.0,,I don't like shopping but I was amazed and impressed by the diversity of shops selling anything and everything that you could imagine. The malls are nicely air-conditioned so when it gets too hot on the street you can cool off inside. There are some great bars where you can sit and people watch and just relax.
,,Window shop till you drop!,5.0,,"Singapore is not the cheap place to shop as it once was. I actually lived here in the early 80's. But it does have it ALL for sure. Every brand, make and store you can imagine. Put on your walking shoes, there is a lot to see inside and out. Escape the heat and you can stroll Inside Orchard Rd in the comfort of the AC. Make sure you visit the Hawkers food courts. The 313 building has one and Center Court bldg does too. Many Hotels on this strip to pop in for a cool afternoon drink. Somerset MRT station is a good On/Off station.
At night hear the birds squawk in the trees that line the streets. It's quite loud, but very cool."

,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,This is a place that has everything. We spent a whole day shopping and only got through two malls. You could spend a week here and not do it all. Keep an eye out for some great big brand bargains in the basement levels of the shopping centres.
,,A nice shopping strip while visiting Singapore,4.0,,"Strip of malls and shops along and around Orchard Rd, this area has all the world famous brand names and lesser known ones. Main spots are Takashimaya at Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Mandarin Gallery...Pleasant to stroll along under the umbrella of high trees."

,,Shoppers Heaven,5.0,,What can you say the perfect shop 'til you drop experience. All the top named fashion shops & hotels
,,Comp specialists pte ltd on orchard road,1.0,,"This store is a complete ripoff and should be shut down.
I purchased a camera there last week and I would have paid about $1000 too much.
I didn't realize at the time but the camera I purchased is a Nikon D700 and I paid about $3800.
This included an extra battery, 3 adaptor rings, the D700 body only(which is at least 5 years old now) a wide angle adaptor lens and a CF card.
I am back in Australia now so I don't think I can do anything about it.
I wouldn't even rate this shop 1 star, but it is the lowest rating allowed"
,,Charming touts,4.0,,Orchard Road is an experience. It is not very long and can be walked each way in a morning. Head for the information centre to find out what is where and how to book visits to Singapore's attractions. Good bargains cam be found but beware of the charming touts who will take you to the shops that pay them a commission. Look around near where you are taken and you may find an even better bargain.
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,Shopping along Orchard road is just great. It has cover ways from one shopping mall to another. No need to worry about rain. Just need to get ready for shopping till you drop. Worth the shopping experience. Must try and see all the luxury goods.
,,Shopping galore,5.0,,If you like great shopping this is a must and inside the malls there is great food courts to eat really great. And lots of walking and things to see. At night on the street there is sometimes some live performances. I highly recommend
,,Orchard Road Upmarket Shops,5.0,,You must visit Orchard Road whilst in Singapore even if you cannot afford to spend anything in the Upmarket designer shops. I have never seen so many shopping malls in one Street. Although there are some cheaper alternatives Orchard Road is mainly known for its designer and Upmarket Shops.
,,"Shop, eat of people watch",4.0,,"Teeming with shopping malls and commercial buildings, plus good hotels, this is one of Singapore's most popular areas with tourists.
It is very well connected with at least 4 MRT stations servicing the area.

One can find both upper end (ION Orchard, Scotts Square) and lower end (Lucky Plaza) or mid range shopping here. Lot of restaurants, cafes and bars for all budgets in the shopping centers and in the tunnels connecting the MRT with the different buildings. There is almost another orchard road under the road above with many many places to shop and eat.

As a tourist, come here to shop and eat, no matter what your budget."
,,Just for shopping,3.0,,"Not much interested if you have been travel for different cities in Asia, but if this is your only stop you have to go for sure. So many malls in everywhere."
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,"If you have the money, energy and love shopping then this is the place! Multiple shopping centres line the street both sides. Underground walk ways allow pedestrians safe access to cross street. Taxis plentiful. Worth seeing."
,,"Extravagant or Budget, everything in one location",5.0,,"We reached here by taking the MRT and walking right into the mall. I can spend hours in the underground mall. They have everything that a girl or guy would need! My favourite are Etude house for their beautiful store( everything pink) and Bath and Body works for lovely collection of lotions and fragrances. Also these stores are priced just right , though Etude house may have few favourable options available at changi international airport. Once you are on the ground floor, you can see all the shop till you bankrupt stores. You name the luxury brand and it will be present there. A walk on the sidewalk will also be enjoyable, specially during evening when the place is teeming with people."
,,Cookie cutter mall,1.0,,Typical cookie cutter mall with lots of designer brands which are over priced. Doesn't give a good insight into Singaporean culture at all. Nothing is really decorated or artistic to look at. Consumerism at it's worst.
,,the jewel in asia's shopping boulevards,5.0,,never disappoints. always something new to see and the centres have all global brands covered. the tropical street scaring and entertaining adds to the vibe.
,,"Enjoyable experience, but not cheap",3.0,,Singapore is famous for it's shopping and none more so than Orchard Road. I feel there is much better value in other cities as I didn't feel like we were getting any bargains here as it is aimed more towards those interested in high quality luxury brands.
,,A walk in Orchard Road,4.0,,"My family and I always stop by at orchard road for a walk whenever we stop by at sibgapore. It's on of the must stop by place where you can find anything from clothes, books, household items, electrical tiers and etc. I love takashimaya the most as it has my favourite Kinokuniya bookstore and Japanese food court below with varieties of food. Another new place is the Japanese Street food newly opened in Ion mall this year with authentic Japanese food served. Best time to come here is during the Christmas seasons with lots of nice decoration along orchard road."
,,shopping heaven at a price,5.0,,"if your shopaholic or like your brands this is the place to shop. If there is something branded you prefer and can't find something to your taste come and shop here. You have all the designer brands and every style you can imagine. Don't be fooled, they are not bargains but actually may be more expensive compared to Dubai or London prices."
,,Good for shopaholics,4.0,,Numerous malls packed along a road. Good for the shopaholics but too much artificial for a nature lover
,,Every shop you could imagine and more,4.0,,"Spent a couple of hours here, many shops, and malls and lots of variety in stores. A very long road, we probably only did half of it or a quarter we. Started at the ION centre off the metro train and really wanted to go to the plaza singapora which was at the other end, couldn't walk it, and was suggested to take the metro back,but unfortunately we ran out of time. A good street to lose yourself for half a day or more"
,,A must,4.0,,"This famous shopping street is a must when you are in Singapore. We had a nice time here, strolling along the road and visiting some of the shops. We had a break and a soft drink at Dean & Deluca at Orchard Central.

Look for more reviews by MulleEllum."
,,Boring label brand street - nothing to buy here !,2.0,,"Zara Rolex Prada Cartier Hermes Gucci Michael Kors Tag Hauer Louis Vuitton - labels labels labels, and then repeat in the multiple malls. Honestly - why does Orchard Road bother with these types of stores ?

sure - if you are into high priced 'made in China' handbags, watches - you'll get your rocks off here - but it's boring and bland seeing these 'label' shops appearing several times in barely a few blocks of malls. And whom is this appealing to ? Come into our mall and see the same overpriced clothes shops from the previous mall. Sorry = the $$ stayed in out wallets.

Worth it only to say that you've been there... but not worth going back to."
,,Very busy and expensive,3.0,,"I would say the prices are comparable to London, do not come thinking you will get good deals. I've never seen so many malls in one space that are so large! Went into 4 malls, all very similar but nicely air-conditioned and good to get out of the heat."
,,SHOPPING!!!,5.0,,SHOPPING HEAVEN SHOPPING MALLS EVERYWHERE!! Must see for both locals and tourists However prices in shops can be expensive
,,Max Your Card,4.0,,High end shopping with all the top end brand names here. Not for me but the girls loved the window shopping experience.
,,Shop till drop,5.0,,"The landmark of Singapore as shopping paradise - yes, it is. Many shopping malls, small shops, everything you can need. Restaurants and cafes are just the bonus to it."
,,Pricey,3.0,,Lots of choice of good quality stores but prices in Singapore are at the very top of the range. Not a good choice for anyone looking for good value or on a budget
,,Must go there 😍🛍🛍,5.0,,"If you like to shop then it is a amazing road filled with big high street shops and good restaurants, cafes, malls. Even if you don't like to shop just go there anyway to say you have been there."
,,Why shop in Singapore?,3.0,,"Orchard road has all the glitzy designer shops you can think of and it's busy all the time. Don't expect bargains, shopping in Singapore is very expensive unless you're prepared to shop at night markets where the quality of clothing is very poor. Restaurants here too are very expensive($14 for a large beer) but the food halls underneath many of the shopping malls are cheap and good quality. When you look in and see that it's full of locals, you know its good."
,,Shop Shop Shop till you drop,4.0,,If you want to walk & shop this is the place to be.... get out the cash or plastic and shop till you drop. You can walk along Orchard Road and enjoy shopping as well as eating.
,,"A must visit, even if to just say you have been there!",4.0,,The street level Orchard Road is busy and rather hot. Below street level is an air conditioned walking path connecting MRT and shopping areas with some really good food court basements!
,,must visit,4.0,,Though we could not buy anything from the orchard road however little ahead near peninsula hotel there is a market complex with good souvenir and discount buy shops.
,,Sights and Sounds of Singapore,4.0,,"Since our hotel was on Scotts Road (Royal Plaza), the Orchard Road was around the corner (intersection) and hardly five minutes walk away. On it lie many of the popular shopping malls of Singapore. From top brands outlets filled mall like the ION Orchard to the economy-shops filled mall like Lucky Plaza, you get the whole variety of shopping options here on a single road.

And if you're hungry and tired from all the shopping, there are lots of high-end to economy-class eateries on the Orchard road, after which you can hit the Scotts Cinema which is right at the corner of the road (Scotts-Orchard intersection) where you can relax and enjoy a good movie."
,,Good Shopping and Dinning,4.0,,"Did not have much time to shop but did drop by two to three malls in Orchard Road for lunch and dessert. Orchard Road, with its numerous malls is still a pretty nice place to shop or window shop due to the diverse items / products available. There are also numerous good places for dining."
,,Shopping mecca,5.0,,"If you want to shop, this is the place. Very expensive but if you shop around bargains can be found."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"We stayed in Hotel Jen, which could not be closer to Orchard Road.
Mall after Mall! They are all along the road, what you see is only a small part of it, on the surface the Mall are huge but under ground there's a whole new world!! Shopping continues in a subterranean world , from Gucci to Rolex, that's at the top end but each Mall caters for all level of clients, and all within easy walking,
Given the humidity you will be glad of the air conditioned world that awaits you , even if your wallet does not!!!"
,,shops,3.0,,"very nice streets with lot a shoppingcenter and foodplace,but i thing it is very expensive here,but things are in very good kvalitet here"
,,All you need is strong legs to walk,5.0,,"I've have walked the Orchard Road, up and down, endless times. So crowded, full of hurry people from all races that mix together in harmony. Great malls like the Ion Centre and even the all time classic Lucky Plaza."
,,Shop until your drop!,5.0,,"I come to singapore once a year just to come to Orchard.

Just love this place, every kind of shop available! And not all above ground - much is below ground and it's like entering an alladins cave!

Make sure you have your credit card ready and an empty suitcase!"
,,the old and tired orchid road,5.0,,this is Orchid road that was one of the original shopping area of Singapore now. You will still find lots of bargain with shops that are maybe more affordable compared to other centres like Marina Bay Sand or Raffle City. Vivo would be the next largest centre to go to.
,,Good for shopping,4.0,,"its a nice place to shop all variety of branded items, the road itself is eye catchy. The malls and pubs around are nice."
,,Total Indulgence,5.0,,"For anyone wanting to live a moment in the life of pure decadence, Orchard Road is the place to visit! With every possible name brand known to man available within walking distance. The smell of perfume permeates every step and the fashion screams at you to stop, look and consider.

Definitely a place worth stopping and if you feel you've earned a treat, indulge in hand-bags, purses, shoes and anything else that tickles your fancy in a space that belongs in scenes from Sex & The City!

With coffee and cocktail stops, your cosmopolitan dreams will come true in an instant!"
,,Just for shopping,3.0,,It's street with lots of shopping center. You can see all ranges of Brands & Many kind of restaurants. Don't has a special things that you couldn't see in other places.
,,Lots of very large plazas,3.0,,"Lots of high end shops and some more market type shops - good to experience and handy when it's hot and you are looking for air conditioning. Didn't like being hassled at the market shops such as Lucky Plaza, by every shop keeper."
,,Shopping shopping and foood..,5.0,,Loved orchard road!! A long stretch of malls.. all connected to each other via the metro and you can walk all the way through each mall. Each mall has multiple food courts with a variety of cuisines.. weekends is very busy.. best to go on a weekday!
,,Shopping,3.0,,It's all about shopping. We have that in sydney so this was nothing new. A bit boring and definitely lots to see to shop if you are into that.
,,Great place to eat and shop,5.0,,We just browsed around lots of shops and had coffee and lunch their. My grandaughters loved it. Be warned to can spend lots of money very quickly.
,,Orchard Rd is Must,5.0,,Any trip to Singapore should include a walk along Orchard Rd. We arrived by MRT and the first hurdle was to get our wives out of the subterranean shopping malls around the train station. Once out into the daylight the brand name stores are everywhere. As with most areas of Singapore the area is very clean with sculptures and art works along the walkways. The ice cream vendors selling sliced ice creams in a multitude of flavours either between wafers or bread are a great treat.
,,Shepper's Paradise,5.0,,If you are a brand freak - this place is a must go. If you are not - You must visit to understand why Brand freaks are brand freaks! A glimpse into how a developed nation looks like!
,,THE shopping street!,5.0,,"It's located in the heart of the city, the hotels are way more expensive in Orchard road, but it is suggested as there are MRT's nearby. If you require to take the green line you have Somerset closeby or within another 5min walk you will get Dhoby-Gaut MRT which is the purple line.

It will take around 20mins to visit Sentosa and Universal from Orchard road.

There are many shopping complexes. But its very expensive. Should you need cheap stuff, go to Bugis. Take the MRT."
,,bring lots of money!!,5.0,,This is THE place to shop. Try Ion Tower... the 55th floor has a stunning observation deck. Excellent food court in basement.
,,Nice,4.0,,"Good view of ultra expensive retail therapy shops, getting an ice cream from uncle toms along the way. Beautiful tree lined streets."
,,Great for people watching,5.0,,"It's a nice, posh area and comparable to 5th Avenue in NYC. if you enjoy shopping, it's a great place to be, but if the pocket strings are tight, get a coffee and NY style cheesecake at a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and enjoy watching other dapper shoppers pass by."
,,"Spend, spend, spend!",3.0,,Worth a wander but a long street of mostly expensive shops into which you can go when the skies open. Take a brolly if you don't wish to be tempted and visit the National Museum when you're done.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,Get a hotel between the belt orchard mrt to dobi ghaut mrt. You can then move around as you wish. Shops are opened till late at night. You can shop high to middle end . Do not miss a visit to the istana heritage gallery which is found at 50 mts from dobi ghaut mrt.
,,Just night walk,4.0,,I personally do not like this place as its over crowded and over hyped . Yes it's good during festive season only if u just go around with family . Nothing much to see except high price shops which are available in multiple corners
,,shopping,5.0,,good place for shopping worlds great brands and malls here good for people who love to shopping and a lot of restaurants around
,,IPhone 7 shopping trip,5.0,,While looking for Apple products we searched along and came to the paragon centre 290 Orchard Road. It wasn't to be but we had a nice stroll up to Orchard Road MRT. High trees and we'll lit. The roads are busy and the streets a joy to walk along. Seven elevens are plentiful so are designer shops. If you are looking for Japanese eateries. Head towards Orchard Road MRT.
,,shoppers paradise.window shoppers paradise too.,5.0,,"Orched st is where the action it.visit as many malls as your legs can.If u want to see Singapore from the top go to the ION towers.on floor 4 there is an art center,from there take a lift to 55 floor,and u have the Birds eye viewof Singapore.but its only open from 3 to 5 in the afternoon,hay its free,no charges,n beautiful,"
,,Great if you are into shopping,3.0,,We arrived at Orchard Road from the Orchard MRT and started heading east to the Somerset MRT. There are a lot of big shopping centres (high end) that didn't really interest us. The only shopping centre we found that had the types of shops we were interested in were in 313@Somerset.
,,Orchard Road has changed,4.0,,"Orchard Road is full of high end shopping centers which can be repetitive, but you do not need to go to all of them.

What is good now is that there are a number of MRT stations along the road such that walking can be minimized (it is hot and humid there), and with the MRT there are extensive sections of walkways below or at road level which are air conditioned such that you can duck out of the heat every so often.

Some of teh shops are expensive, but like any major city, there are high end shops and reasonably priced shops. A good aspect now is the number of eateries available."
,,Nice place to experience Singapore,5.0,,A place with shopping centers and hotels which is worth going for a stroll. We stayed in a hotel on this road and would definitely recommend this to everyone.
,,Main area in Singapore,4.0,,"This is the main area to visit in Singapore where all the main shopping centres and brand stores are.

It is pretty much the only area where tourists should base themselves unless they are looking for something specific.

There are also a ton of restaurants in the various shopping centres on the main street and also on the streets off orchard road.

I would consider this the best area to stay in Singapore for tourists and visitors"
,,My favorite place,5.0,,The best place to visit in Singapore. A great place for shopaholics.There are 21 shopping malls. From high end to normal brands. One will get excellent stuff over there.
,,Must go in Singapore,5.0,,"From highend to casual brands here. You can find everything here. I often buy Charles and Kieth( singaporean brand), H&M and enjoy the dishes in shopping center."
,,Lots of malls and shops,4.0,,"If shopping is your thing this street is for you. Brands and non brands all in one long strip of shopping.

Some nice restaurants and food halls. A few shop houses turned into restaurants and bars.

Wouldn't say it was a tourist must unless shopping is your thing.

There is a good tourist info place on the street."
,,Great shopping spree,4.0,,Just wow. Top of the line brands and shops. Beautiful buildings and shops. The place is probably the best for shopping in the whole world
,,Prepare to be overwhelmed,4.0,,"Shops, shops and more shops. Almost all are expensive, however look out for the odd sale rack. Unfortunately there is a definite lack of any seating in these shops, so best not to take a non shopper with you! There are some outdoor seats on the side of the road though, if you are lucky you can find one in the shade that is not being used by smokers!
Enjoy an ice=cream sandwich from the elderly man selling them (around midway) Very cheap and perfect for a hot Singapore day out.
Worth visiting Orchard Road just for the experience."
,,Orchard Road---the Place where City Lives,5.0,,"Too Good. Let it be Lights, Shopping or Food. Best of all in Singapore. a Must visit for people to go at least once when in Singapore. too Good for Shopping. Good for Food. Takashimaya is also located on Orchard Road along with Ion Orchard which can prove to be too good for All varieties of Shopping. A Shopper Heaven"
,,Only for shopaholics,2.0,,"If you are looking for global brands than this is the place, nothing different from any other shopping street in any other big city. No Singaporean speciality"
,,"If you're cashed up, then fine, otherwise it's cheaper at home",3.0,,"KL and Hong Kong are better for the savvy shopper. If you're from Australia, you should save your dollars and spend them at home - it's much cheaper. Orchard Road retailers aim for the shopper who doesn't care about prices and loves the luxury brands."
,,"Shopping for days, but don't miss out on food either",5.0,,"It's the perfect shopping setup - mall after mall of shopping variety and air conditioning in a city where the heat and humidity forces you to dash from building to building. We were absolutely spent (in every sense) after walking this road from beginning to end and back.

Be sure to ask the sales people if there are any specials for tourists or certain credit cards - we were delighted to find a $60 VISA credit card and 10% tourist discount when we went into Paragon.

While Orchard is certainly a top-shelf shopping destination, don't miss out on the wonderful selection of food each mall's food court offers. We found delicious Mee Goreng in Lucky and Ban Mian in Wisma Atria."
,,Shops shops everywhere.,4.0,,So many shops and so much to choose from I found it a bit overwhelming and you really need lots of money as things quite expensive.Great experience though.You have to go even if it's only to say you have been to Orchard Road.
,,Shopping spree,5.0,,"If you love shopping, Orchard Road is highly recommended! Situated in the middle of Singapore; easily accessible via public transport, etc. A shopping place for all ladies!"
,,Great place to visit,4.0,,A must see while in Singapore. this is the main shopping area of Singapore with all the high end shops and hotels. nice to just walk and look.
,,Lost again on a straight road,4.0,,"Orchard is the only straight road where I have gotten lost ... Why? because Orchard Road is a wide busy street so the Singaporeans have build not only subways under the road but food malls and shops ... so when you go down on one side you come up on the other side ... but no usually directly across the street.

I have to say here that it was night time and I don't think we would have had the same problem in the daytime.

There are also MRT stations under the buildings and without a visual reference, my sense of direction leaves town.

We were staying at a hotel on Scotts Road (which intersects with Orchard Road and only a few minutes walk away but one night we just got lost ... we went down the escalator in the Ion Centre and appeared someplace else ... we proceeded to walk in a direction away from the hotel until we asked a man with a smartphone how to get back ... he sent us in another direction again and he was a local.

We finally got far enough away from the hotel to see the sigh on the top of the roof and headed back in that direction.

Orchard Road is shoppers and diners paradise and you can lighten you wallet really quickly if you are not careful ... the prices are pretty much the same as other developed western countries but you can claim back the GST if purchases from each shop equal or exceed SGD100.

We spent a lot of time sampling the different cuisines in Food Republic on level 4 of the Wisma Atria at 435 Orchard Road ... there are over 25 different shops catering to all Asian cuisines.

So if you go to Orchard Road at night, take your wallet and a compass."
,,Indian restaurants in this marker,5.0,,Lot of pubs and bars are dere...u can see 2 Indian restaurants also...but u have to visit before 11 to have indian food in this market
,,Busy but beautiful,4.0,,"This is probably one of the most popular streets to visit while in Singapore. It is very busy here with people and cars so public transportation is the best way to get to this road and there are so many options. Driving isn't really necessary anywhere in Singapore but especially not in this area. Hundreds of shops, ranging from H&M to Louis V. The street is lined with malls that are anywhere from 4 -8 stories (ION is one of the biggest). Grocery stores and food/ indoor hawker like eating is at the bottom of almost every mall on this street."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"If you love shopping this is the place to be! Orchard Road is full of beautiful shops, however, Singapore is expensive as everything has to be shipped from other countries. Take a stroll up Orchard and dip in an out of all the Malls from the most expensive to the native malls that sell everything a lot cheaper."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"Shopping heaven for world best brands, lot of collections, best malls ION Orchard is one of the best mall in singapore. Must see in singapore, Orchard road walk in the evening will be pleasant."
,,Nice place to walk and windowshop,5.0,,Nice place to walk at night when it is cooler and less crowded. The tree lined boulevard is pleasant and includes the sound of birds (electronic I think) chirping as you pass by the large and shady trees. If it gets you too hot there are underground connectors as well that gets your tom one mall to another.
,,THE shopping destination in Singapore!,5.0,,"Ideal location, well connected by public transport, at the Center of Singapore! What else can a traveler ask for?"
,,UGLY and Commercial,1.0,,"Why go to a foreign country to buy goods you could find anywhere? Commercial, hot and humid, over priced, garish and totally unattractive."

,,Busy day and night with shops galore,4.0,,"Designer shops everywhere in Orchard Road. Shopping centers every few hundred metres. Glitz and glamour everywhere.

There are other shopping centers where the shops are more market style and much cheaper.

So many places to eat you will be spoilt for choice.

Orchard Road is spotless and workers sweeping the streets day and night. We felt very safe here walking in the evenings."
,,Busy street Nice Food & Shopping,4.0,,A busy area with lots of people from different countries. Nice place for shopping and dining. Not a budget area though.
,,Shopping Heaven,4.0,,There is everything on Orchard Road that you could ever dream about buying. All the high end stores are there plus everything in between. Coming from the UK though I found that the prices were higher than at home so it wasn't the place to get bargains but great for window shopping.
,,the shopping town,4.0,,come here for shopping and food and people watching long street for u to walk up and down and bask in the personality of the city
,,Crowded Street,3.0,,"It's no joke to be at Orchard on a Sunday. There were lots of people and the restaurants and places are so crowded. But you have to go here when your in Singapore because it is the most popular street, I think, in Singapore. Have a cheap mall also for souvenirs."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Stayed in the centre of town . Great shops easy to access and nicely air conditioned . I found this area very expensive but then I'm not into designer clothes . Certainly lots of choice .
,,great shopping street,5.0,,"if you love shopping its the place to be but dont forget to bring some extra money, all the big brands are there."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"If you like shopping, this is the street for you. This has everything imaginable. I've never been to Rodeo Dr., however, I would imagine Orchard Rd is just as nice if not better. this Road has everything from Harry Winston to Breitling. Spectacular restaurants along the route. Nice Marriott Hotel, on the corner. I include this Hotel and location on every trip. You'll not be disappointed."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,Every international brand you could think of is here! The buildings are almost interconnected from underground walkways benefitting from air conditioning. The Singapore humidity is stifling and too hot to stroll around Orchard Road during the day.
,,a large street filled with so many shopping centres,4.0,,"My friend and I took the hop on hop off tour bus and we started prettu much from one end to the other. There are quite a few shopping centres on this one street catering for the cheap to the very expensive. Very busy street with a lot of traffic and people. To experience the shopping in Singapore, come to this street"
,,Becoming an ugly tourist trap,2.0,,"Orchard road is changing , will there are good malls and restaurants, a lot of what you will see is focused on the hoards of tourists that clog the street at any time of day. My advice is to visit once but then avoid , especially at busy times. Everything at orchard is available elsewhere and in more relaxing surrounds."
,,Overrated,2.0,,"Singapore is known for its shopping, why is beyond me! Orchard road consists of the same shops one after another and simply ranges from cheap to extremely expensive with no good boutiques, no mid range and nothing 'different'. At all costs avoid on a Sunday!!"
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"The very best shopping in the world with everything you could possibly want often at very good prices in lovely stores with great service. A few rip offs, so ask at the tourist office before you buy for hints about reliable retailers."
,,"Want to shop, look no more...",5.0,,"Orchard Road, like Singapore, has changes so very much over the years. Walk up and down the various streets around the 'centre of town' and you will have everything from high end to cheaper shops to spend big or little in. Plus more restaurants than you’d ever be able to enjoy…"
,,Luxurious,5.0,,"Fab houses and shops explore the old and new. You can shop, eat, drink, walk, admire the old buildings and lush houses. Long popular street"
,,Shopping Mega,3.0,,Dependant on what type of shopping you wish to do to whether it is the right place for you. Found these shops to be of the higher priced bracket. We made the mistake of going at the weekend. This is when the locals shop and is very busy.
,,Shopping,5.0,,Very busy street. Too many high class shops brand names...not enough average prise items. Many Australian brands. You feel like you are in Sydney. On Sunday morning hundreds of young women domestic workers congregated on the streets
,,Back to orchard after one year,4.0,,"This road nice to walk and doing window shopping,plus special the road very clean and beautiful flowers and green trees in both sides,am very happy you did people's smokes in the walking way they have place to the smoker to smoke,plus wash building you go have coffee place or have food place to have lunch or dinner,there is big department stores with new clothes and stuff I recommend any one go to Singphore must go to this orchard."

,,Trip to Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard road is a collection of various shopping malls alongside the street. Focus is on commerce and shine. But at the east end of the road, the Istana, the official residence and office of the President of Singapore is located in a wide park."
,,Orchard Rd Shopping.???,5.0,,Orchard road is the hub of shopping but over the last 20 years the prices have gone up and up. Some times its cheaper in your own country. Its a interesting place to see and walk down the long road. Its great for clothes that you wont find anywhere else and electronic nik naks.
,,Designer Labels by the Dozen,4.0,,Hmmm the Orchard Road of yester year has gone this is a smart strip full of shopping centres all boasting designer labels galore. You need to use the under pass to get from one side to the other. It is definitely worth seeing though unless you are seriously into designer labels have a look and move on.
,,Good atmosphere and good shopping,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a typical tourist Street, everyone visits it. It's entertaining and extremely busy but the shopping is good if you're into the expensive genuine brands like Prada, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Gucci. There are plenty of small 7/11 shops along the road that you can buy cold water from. And the ice cream sandwich stalls are a must. They are delicious, variety of flavours and very cheap, perfect for a hot Singaporean day."
,,Great range of Clothings and Food...,5.0,,"Who wouldn't drop by Orchard Road, whilst in Singapore. I guess every body does...it was so well promoted by the Tourist Board. Nevertheless, its a great place to shop, from ION, many branded items to Lucky Plaza, simply Tshirts to chocolates. Best buy in town!"
,,Clean and beautiful shopping area,4.0,,Loved walking along Orchard road and looking at all the shops - everything is so clean! At night it just lights up and looks even more beautiful. Central and safe area close to public transport - couldn't recommend this area more.
,,Shopping and wondering fun,5.0,,"There are some amazing shops on Orchard Road, and it's lots of fun just to have a walk up and down the road. Lots of shopping for the serious shopper and lots of buildings/shops to admire if only window shopping."
,,"Good for shopping, eating and chilling out",4.0,,"The many shopping malls, boutiques, cafes and restaurants in the Orchard Road belt means that you will be kept busy either shopping, eating or just chilling out, watching people around you. There are also cinemas where you can catch a movie or two."
,,"same, same and not different.",3.0,,"Orchard Road used to be the shopping mile to go to in the 70s and 80s. Now shopping is absolutely everywhere and the big names you find everywhere can be found at Orchard Road as well. Same, same and absolutely nothing different."
,,Designer stores,5.0,,"This street is back to back of designer stores, lots of places to eat, and lots to see, we spent a whole day here."
,,Entertaining area,4.0,,The local shops in a fairly upmarket district stand out for their friendly staff and their distinct character. There are many malls of very expensive but homogeneous shops along the road
,,Shop Until You Drop,5.0,,"So many shops, in fact too many. Nice to go and see, you certainly dont need to walk all the way down as the shopping malls seem to have the same brands. Great for food, shopping. Eacy to get to through the MRT or busses and taxis are easy. World class thats for sure, offers all the MAJOR brands."
,,Average,3.0,,There are so many shopping centres in Singapore that there isn't really a need to come here. Good for designer shops. We made it through 3 shopping centres then left. It's expensive to shop there - more expensive than London for chain stores
,,"Shopping, branded, and socialite",3.0,,Shopping street with luxury brands everywhere. But try to visit the tourist information centre in Orchard Rd. Staff in the TIC really helpful and friendly. The have numerous suggestions for you to explore Singapore.
,,Luxurious Shopping Complex,4.0,,"This place was always crowded in my opinion, but still wide enough for people to walk. Lots of luxurious malls with hefty prices, would recommend to go here if you're into luxurious branded goods. Lucky Plaza and Far East Plaza were the only malls with affordable prices for clothing and the foods. You could also buy the famous 'ais krim potong' or sliced ice cream served with bread or biscuits for only S$ 1.20 (it used to be S$ 1.00 last time I visited in 2012). Nonetheless, a very beautiful place, and a popular shopping destination."
,,It has been a few years,4.0,,"The last time we came to Singapore was about 4 years ago. I remember we enjoyed it, but this time felt different.
We told taxi to drop us off at Orchard Rd and he said it's quite long. So I said we don't want high end shopping. He dropped us in the middle at 313@Somerset mall. This was perfect .
We walked out the mall and walked one way, wasn't too bad, I shopped at OG dept store. Kept on walking then decided we'd turn around and walk the other end but all I saw was expensive shops one after another. The place we shopped at most was where we got dropped off. It has the stores like Smiggles, Typo, Cotton On, Forever 21.
Shopping in the suburbs seemed like a better option for us."
,,Shopping destination,4.0,,"It's one of the most busy road in Singapore, cluttered with various shops both sides if the road.. And at some points even under it.

It's probably one of the most well known tourist shopping destination. I don't think you so always get the best bargain here, but you can get everything here, from small shops to boutiques, department stores, specialty stores, restaurants to take ways.

Might be a good central place to look for accommodation. But look around the marina, mustafa, and Chinatown too. Plenty to see and enjoy Singapore."
,,Expensive! Expensive! Expensive!,4.0,,"Visited Orchard Road in September 2016. For those who love to shop, it's a shoppers paradise, for those who don't, it's your worst nightmare! 5kms of shops (2.5kms on either side of the road). There are shopping centres, upon shopping centres, both above ground and underground. It's like nothing we've witnessed before.

However, everything is very expensive. In many cases more expensive than Australia so don't expect to find a bargain. So many designer brands, Tiffany's, Chanel, Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana and so on... In general, Singapore is a very expensive city. Food and drink prices are outrageous. After, a few hours on Orchard Road, you begin to realize these shopping complexes all offer the same things. They become very repetitive with nothing new to offer. Good for a visit though, if not to shop, to be amused by the Asians stopping anywhere and everywhere to pose for a photo! Very bizarre..."
,,Most famous shopping paradise in Singapore,3.0,,"If you love shopping, definately you have to walking down Orchard Road when visit Singapore, because this is the most famous shopping paradise in Singapore. So many upper middle outlets you can visit along Orchard Rd to Somerset."
,,Great atmosphere at night,4.0,,"Definitely a shopper's paradise but it does get boring with the same brands in all the malls. Most of the brands are available in Australia for similar prices.
Orchard Road comes alive at night and it's great to go out for a meal and then take a stroll to soak up the atmosphere as everything is open until at least 10.00pm.
You'll find more interesting items and bargains in the older shopping centres than the new modern malls."
,,same same,2.0,,"Orchard road is boring and over priced. every complex is the same and unless your after top end names, there isn't much point wasting any time here other than some of the food courts"
,,Orchard Road Singapore,4.0,,"Well,what can I say.I have been here at least 6 times over 30 years,and every time I go.it seems to get even bigger. There are all manner of high-end shopping centres everywhere,which to me is becoming very boring,as there is really an oversupply of the stuff. There are also thousands of different types of food halls,restaurants,and hawker stalls. I feel Singapore is now just a hot,concrete jungle,devoid of its former interesting vibe. It is also very expensive now,and doesnt represent good value as a trave destination in Asia."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"For many shopaholics, Orchard Road is the place to go to. It contains many shopping malls, all within walking distance. There are branded goods for those looking to buy great stuff. A stroll along the street is also surprisingly therapeutic. During Christmas, this place turns into a mega beauty."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Very busy area with designer shops etc, anything you want. Great for people wanting to spend the day shopping!!"
,,Wow - quite a buzz!,4.0,,"Well if you like shopping, and like to spend lots of $$$ on high end brands - then this is shoppers heaven.

I really enjoyed walking down Orchard Road, we did it twice during our recent stay. Even though shopping isn't my thing. I'm not a name brand kinda gal. But it was a buzz walking through some of the high end shops. My teenage daughter loved it, but also wasn't prepared to spend her money there.

I much preferred the other side of Orchard Road, where you find many hidden shops underneath. I also preferred some of the bigger shopping centres. But that's just me, as shopping isn't really my thing."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,Nice place to shop..eat and spend time. Very energetic atmosphere.although the weather was little too hot in September. U ll find all designer stores here.
,,Convenient shopping,5.0,,All main shops are located on this type of high street. Many designer shops so don't expect too many bargain or budget stores. You can walk to all the shops which is very convenient . Great shopping experience
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Must see attraction with amazing plants, flowers, and wooden sculptures, this out doors so open to the weather. There is a high walking platform which is very open and suitable for those with a fear of heights, costs $8 so very cheap."
,,Visit Chinatown or little India,3.0,,"Upon my visiting Singapore i found the people from all walks of life,helpful, couldnot do enough for you to promote their beautiful city of delight . Where I have stayed on my many trips to Singapore ,have varied from backpackers to 4 star accommodation and i have found the hospitality second to none.
My visit to both chination and little India was to say the least very interesting and diverse with the two cultures living in the same city.My experience made me realise how different people can live in harmony if you have respect for each individual culture and the peacefulNess to acknowledge each others religion.
This time around i loved the flowers and trees that were blooming so everthis get looked gorgeous, my visit to the big wheel was a experience not to be missed also the tree garden shed that lit up at night.Every time I visit this place called Singapore l am amazed by places l havenot, seen.So l would recommend a visit to satisfy your thirst. Regards Mel"
,,A shopping hub that has lost its shine.,3.0,,"Once the place to do serious shopping but Orchard Road has lost its shine. The reason is that other shopping areas have taken the crown away long ago and now offer better prices and bargains for the serious shopper..
Orchard Road still offers retail for the high end of town but has also denigrated into a shopping area for the local itinerant workforce."
,,Good shoppibg,5.0,,Great shopping but not cheap better off heading further down orchard rd first better shopping but a great place to visit and look around
,,Very expensive place,3.0,,Everything you want you can buy in Orchard road. Many shopping malls many choises. Just see dont buy. The place is very expensive.
,,View of Eyes,4.0,,"I am wondering the views of the Road and the facing of the market.We visited, LV Dior, And other high Class Bags shop. The price is very high as of Bangladeshi peoples. But the Quality is Fabulous.We enjoy the Road side bench, walking and the couples loveness.ha ha like as love park."

,,Great Shopping,5.0,,"Orchard Road is amazing for shopping, cafes and restaurants. We discovered a whole world underground and under the hustle & bustle of the street: lots of amazing restaurants with local food and cheaper shops/markets"
,,Great for Shopping,5.0,,"I loved Orchard Road and the wonderful array of shops - great shops with great quality. Orchard Road has a few underground crossings making it easy and interesting when crossing the road - there are underground shops to browse and signage makes them easy to follow. I shopped late in the evening by myself and felt very safe - no beggars, no rubbish and NO GRAFFITI (hooray). Singapore is a safe clean city. Tanglin Road also has fantastic shopping centre smaller but loads of variety."
,,Like shopping?,5.0,,"Orchard Road is world famous for its shopping. If you like shopping, this is your heaven! If you can't find it here, it does not exits and you dont need it!"
,,Brands !!!,5.0,,Orchard Road is the place where you can get all the best brands of the world . Name the brand you will have it !!! Awesome place for shopping !!!
,,A Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"I really wanted to say,Orchard Road is a shopping paradise! Shopping malls are everywhere, and some of them are free of duty. A superb collection of all the good things! You can see the beautiful lighting at night. Enjoy your feasts for eyes!"
,,Shopping Shopping Shopping,4.0,,"If you love to shop and you love the big brands, this is THE place to go. Here you'll find many high end brands and mid brands as well. It's a very busy street but it's nice to Window shop too! While I was there, a massive UniQlo Flagship store was under construction set to open September 2016. If you have a day set aside for Shopping, Orchard Road is a must!"
,,Shops shops everywhere,4.0,,A place to go to buy labels. Also enjoyable to wander into or window shop. A couple of street stalls sell icecream in bread- a Singaporean delicacy.
,,Good shopping for a non-shopper,4.0,,"I'm not a shopper but Orchard road is an amazing place to window-browse or visit both regular and high-end stores, an outstanding array of international brands, I normally expect that in places like the US but Singapore stocks brands from Europe, Asia pacific and the Americas.

The retailers in Singapore do retail well, lots of different products and items in beautiful shops. It's also a good place to explore department store food halls. We enjoyed the ones in ION and Takashimaya (if you like jerky, try the Bakkwa at Bee Cheng Hiang counter in the Takashimaya food hall - it's really good). Some of the department stores are interlinked under ground so you can avoid the heat.

It's safe to say it's a shoppers paradise, even for a window shopper like me.

The Orchard MRT station lies below ION, you can walk the road down to Somerset MRT while shopping. Easily spend couple of hours"
,,Shopaholic,5.0,,This is a Shopaholic's dream come true. All of the brands are together on a single road . You can shop till you drop.
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,Very nice shopping road. Wide pavement. Many places to sit and have a break and see people walk by. Orchard Road has trees along the side and flowers underneath. Istana Park along Orchard Road is beautiful with a lot of flowers and a little lake with turtles. You cant go to Singapore without going to Orchard Road. At Christmas its a must to see Orchard Road with all the beautiful Christmas light.
,,The best road in Singapore for Shopping.,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the best road for both visitors and locals wanting to do some shopping in Singapore. Lots of different shopping malls with a variety to suit everyone from the cheap Lucky Plaza to the expensive ION Orchard mall. Orchard Rd is served by 3 MRT Stations and plenty of buses, it's a must see tourist destination for people who want to do some serious shopping."
,,Dynamic and Vibrant Shopping Orchard Road.,4.0,,"If you are a first time visitor to Singapore, it is a must to visit Orchard Road Shopping Zone to feel the vibrancy and dynamic excitement of shopping along a long and beautiful stretch for at least 15 km. Many tourists come here to look for their designer clothes or branded goods from all over the world. The atmosphere is different when you are soaked with the dazzling shopping decorations especially in the evening. Better if you come before December for the feel of Christmas festive season. Very crowded. Some will stay for at least 2 days along Orchard Rd for their shopping. But it may not cater for all visitors depending on what you are looking for. Along this street are dotted with 4-5 star hotels. Orchard Road is a safe, clean and green haven. Trees line along this stretch of road. Even at late nights it is safe to walk and move around including the underground passages. It is always crowded. No touting is allowed.
Orchard Road is not about shopping alone, there are many fine restaurants serving chicken rice, steamed boat, and international cuisines. There are food courts/malls in almost every building. You can spend about S$6 for a simple meal including a drink. Or you may desire to rest in a cafe along the street watching the crowd go sipping coffee. Food are plentiful.
If you are tired, it may be worth to watch a Shaw movie at Lido Building for S$9 while relaxing the aircond theatre for 1-2 hours. Hop on a tourist bus that brings you around parts of Singapore like Chinatown, Little India and the sea front Esplanade with Duck Hippo rides on land and sea. But a special day pass purchased from the MRT train stations (underground) will permit no limit ride on public buses and MRT trains. Or better go to the National Library (Orchard) and other international bookshops to relax, browsing of the latest collection.
If you are travelling with a tight budget, you may want to consider staying at Chinatown hotels with all the public transport including MRT trains within walking distance. Restaurants and food courts are just next door away open till late night. It is safe even at late nights to move around. In Singapore, if you are lost, the locals will be happy to assist you voluntarily.
Don't miss this opportunity going to Orchard Road and get lost with shopping crowd!"
,,Very Famous and just AWFUL!,1.0,,"Orchard Road is just AWFUL!
Expensive shops with no grace or charm - just selling international stuff at huge prices. The same stuff is on sale in all the major cities in the world - nothing special here.
If you have limited time in Singapore then don't waste a day of you holiday going to Orchard Road to see shops which you can find back home selling the same expensive stuff."
,,Wow street,5.0,,"From my point of view, it's not the best place for shopping, because it's so huge, you get lost easily and it's very tiresome to try to find something. On the other hand, I must admit, it's fascinating and great experience. Fortunatelly, we stayed in a hotel located literally in the street, which was convenient- Orchard Parade hotel."
,,Great shopping place,4.0,,Great shopping place for everyone. Very clean and safe. Price is more expensive than Canada. They have special discount for tourist in certain department store. They will ask and let you know. Not as crowded as a few years ago.
,,Over the top but fun,4.0,,"Is a must visit to be amazed by the ostentation, the bling, the number of shops you can't afford to go in""...."
,,Busy Shopping District in Singapore,3.0,,"This is one of the main shopping district on the island of Singapore. Most of the big shopping centres can be found along the road or within the area.

Busy with vehicles and human traffics. There are some performers by the road and stalls along the road to buy drinks or snacks.

Busy area but it's a typical shopping district compare to other major cities around the world. Hence the average or 3 stars rating."
,,High tech shopping mall,5.0,,Only place in Singapore to experience high end brands. The ION orchard mall is the major highlight in Orchard road. The underground shopping experience is memorable and most recommended.
,,Shopper's fairyland !!!,5.0,,"just a right place for a shopaholic ! though not any cheap buy !!! the whole stretch is full of malls, arcades. Great for spending a whole evening . One of the highlights of Singapore. Its kind of an entertainment and shopping hub of Singapore . Expect more :)"
,,Good if you like high end shopping.,3.0,,Good for a look but alot of places here. Also sizings are really small. Mostly high end places with the odd cheap places. Is cool to walk down and have a look around.
,,A shoppers paradise,4.0,,"2kms of retail therapy, with most high end stores present. Plenty of malls and arcades to wander through. Sunday is possibly the busiest day so try and go earlier in the week. Can access via MRT or bus. Each arcade generally has multiple levels so start at the top and make your way down. A good place to stop on the streets and buy a cheap ice-cream."
,,A shopping Mecca of sorts,4.0,,"We visited a number of shopping complexes along Orchard road and found there was vast difference in the types of stores in each complex the one next to the Hilton is old and the stores are more your money changers and tailors and food stores, while the one going away from the Hilton is new and the retailers are mote up market and there are a lot of high end stores in other complexes along orchard road well worth a walk down a few blocks or more and the options are many I particularly liked the one under the orchard hotel."
,,Singapore Odyssey,3.0,,Sadly now over rated.Is now mainly a group of designer shops you can see anywhere in the world.Suggest you try Little India or China Town first.
,,One of the highlights of Singapore!,4.0,,"Orchard Road has to be one of the most popular streets for shopping, for locals and tourists alike. It is quite a pleasant street, and very neatly laid out, and generally clean. A few restaurants and roadside stalls too. A must if you are a visitor to Singapore"
,,Depends what you are looking for,3.0,,"Personally I don't like shopping malls and high end retailers when I am on holiday. I prefer markets where you can get a feel for the culture and people of an area. So I wasn't really thrilled about a street full of expensive labels and snooty shop staff. However, if you are into that type of thing, you certainly wouldn't miss out here - every high end shop I could think of was here and plenty of options for food and drink too."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Main shoppinh strip in Singapore. if you are willing to spend head down this way. if you want to enjoy local fare its also available.
,,Shops everywhere,5.0,,"Lots of different shopping. Coffee shops, jewellery shops .all in walking distance.great to experience clean city"
,,Overated and expensive,3.0,,"We found this place very upmarket but worth the look. Most of what you want to buy is top quality so what you pay for is what you get. If you have the time to look around,you will find a bargain or two. It's a very big area so it takes time to see it all. Not my scene but others will like it."
,,Shopping Shopping,5.0,,"It never ends, these malls get bigger the further down into the ground you go. It can get a little disorientating but if you love to shop its a must. Street level are the high end boutiques and as you entire and go lower are the more common high street brands. Also home to some great cafes and places for lunch."
,,Shopping Time,4.0,,"Visited Orchard Road,a great place to shop & dine! A number of shopping center to visit and lots of choices to choose from 😀"
,,Main shopping area,4.0,,"Is the area with most expensive shops. Anyway, its worth a stroll. There are some cheaper places with foodstalls upstairs."
,,Center of all things,4.0,,"We stayed on Orchard Road and it was a great decision. Easily available public transportation. Easy access to other places for sight seeing. All the malls worth visiting! My choice of mall would be Lucky Mall!!!!! Unfortunately I only found out about it on last night of my stay and it was already closing but dear God it is was a great mall for bargain shopping!!!!! End up buying gifts from family from there. Takashimaya mall was also a nice one I enjoyed it.
Sigh I miss bring there already! Great experience."

The shopping ranges from really ""good"" copies of big brand names to theactual real big brands that us common folk wonder ""who can afford to pay that for a handbag"" We actually saw people queing outside a Channel shop where they were only letting in a small number at a time, now that is class or good marketing. It is an amazing shopping experience and worth a visit."

But for the past half century at least, it is famous as the retail and entertainment hub of Singapore.

It is a little over 2 km long, and is known locally as simply ""Orchard"".

In 2009 Orchard Road was given a S$40 million overhaul, with new street lights, planter boxes, and tiled pedestrian areas.

Orchard Road is now home to many malls that house top International brand name products, top rated star restaurants, and entertainment venues."
,,Viva Orchard!,5.0,,You are officially well certified in Spore if you have yourself in the mid of Orchard Rd. No need to sack plenty of cash to shop whatever the fancy stores provide but just to buy a sandwich icecream or softdrinks. And enjoy Spore 😀
,,Headspin shopping,4.0,,"Thought we should have a day on Orchard Rd. Dropped by cab to the midpoint (Singapore cabs are so cheap, not sure how when car ownership is so expensive?) and went into the Metro centre to look around. Found a great four level shop and an hour and a half later realised that if we spent that long in each shop, or even in each shopping centre, we would be on Orchard Road for several weeks. So broadened our horizons and wandered all the way up to the top, marvelling at the buildings and particularly the endless luxury goods stores with famous names. Surprised that the streets were not more crowded, and of course it is all so clean and ordered. After six hours we went to catch a taxi but the queue was long, so just a short walk to the MRT and for $1.70 each with one easy change we were back outside the hotel. The shopping gives you the opportunity to buy anything from a few cheap souvenirs to a Louis Vuitton bag depending on your budget. It's a 'must do' on your Singapore visit."

,,Great Area for Shopping and Eating,5.0,,"So here you take the subway from the airport.
I highly suggest going to Singapore Shopping Mall.
There are lots of other ones in the area, but, SSM i found to have tons of stores with decent prices,
and it is also my favorite place to eat in Singapore because if you go outside to any normal restaurant, it is super expensive. But it you go to the Shopping Malls food courts, prices are very low for good food. So Singapore Shopping Mall I love the most because you can get Steak and Lobster for $10.00 dollars :))) Or Sushi for a little more. They have lots of other good western food to eat there as well."

,,Something for everyone,5.0,,"Orchard Rd is lined with shopping plazas on either side of the road.

You have the top labels available everywhere for miles, but if you are looking for middle of the road fashion that is available too.

Most malls/plazas have food halls if required, and if you haven't ""shopped til you've dropped"" in Orchard Rd, the Marina Bay Precinct is only a $7.00 taxi ride away, for more luxury shopping and refined eateries.

Take a day or two to enjoy the range of shops and restaurants in these areas, and that is not including any of the many great ""ethnic"" hubs that are handy also."
,,Great,5.0,,"Visited this road so many times but only thought to review it now. As widely known, Orchard Road is the most famous road in Singapore.

,,The walking street of shops,5.0,,Is a whole stretch of high class to middle class of shopping malls along orchard. You will never want to miss a mall. But do be careful of lucky plaza if you were to buy electronics gadgets. Do search online before buying or ask more information before paying. Do not let them have your card or to sign on anything before paying. You wont know if you were to be ask to pay more cash for nothing. Do go to reputation shop for purchase.

Be it movie theatres, where I went to see Dawn of Justice, to malls to tons of place to shop, this place has it all. When I went there in the evenings, there was a sea of humanity crossing roads and walking on the sidewalks. On weekends, avoid malls if you don't really need to go. Waiting for a cab in a queue can take a while. It took me nearly half an hour to get my turn to hail a cab"

We had heard many things about it prior to honeymoon when we visited for 5 days.

We took a day to stroll about and the shops are the kind where you can't touch anything unless you have gloves on or look in any way worth a penny or two.

Needless to say nothing was purchased but it is an experience to browse through the designers and have a look at the handbags.

If you have money to spend and are struggling for ideas on what to spend it on then look no further.."

,,A bit of old within the glitz of the new,4.0,,"Whilst Orchard Road with its gleaming buildings, and fancy up-scale shopping malls, is the main shopping belt in Spore, what strikes the visitor is a 'bit of old' that makes up to be part of the streetscape. Dotted along the almost 2.5km stretch are ice-cream carts (on motorbikes actually) that are an inviting must-try of the local treat. Buskers enroute entertain, as you're walking & lapping on that cone. The well shaded, tree-lined promenade, with seats every 200m, is where people watching gets done. Not exactly the Spanish steps, but the many people sitting on the steps in front of Wisma Atria certainly lends to the atmosphere. It starts with the shopping intent, but as you meander along, its the eating places, drink joints, cinema halls, and the high energy of the younger set that soon become distractions in their own right. Never a tiring moment here....."
,,Walk this road,5.0,,"Orchard road is a long strip and easily one of Singapore best streets. If you got time to spare walk down this road for a first hand experience of this magnificent country. What's really interesting is the relaxing feeling walking down a street which blends the luxury malls , busy road traffic and outdoor food joints with an abundance of greenery. It's like walking through one giant park with the perks.

Only way to experience it is to do it .

Recommended time for walking would be from 4pm onwards so you could enjoy the walk and avoid the mid day sun . Carry a bottle of water to keep yourself hydrated. Cheers"

Plenty of buses and the Metro for easy access. It's noisy and very crowded, and crossing the street can only be done at infrequent designated crossing points.

,,“wow... really!”,2.0,,"Gelatissimo (Cafe)
Gelato ice - cream
350 Orchard Road, #01-01 , Shaw House, Singapore

“wow... really!”
3 of 5 starsReviewed 3 days ago NEW
Just got back from having a cup of gelato at Lido. Since their renovation their
potions has shrank. When I asked the counter girl ,she was good and admitted the
bottom of the cup is hollow becuz the gelato is puffed up but happily said the weight is all standard. ITs meant to be hollow

I did not see their server weighing the gelato cups... wow ! guess their servers instinctively know the weight of the amount they give

Before renovation the cup was full not hallowed from the middle. I wont be visiting them again.

Visited September 2016"
,,"Shop, Shop, Shop",3.0,,"I must admit that even this shopaholic was not terribly excited with all the designer stores on Orchard Road. Yes, I love designers, but I really want to purchase items made in the country. I purchase Itailian designers in Italy. I wanted to find something that represented Singapore. I'm sure that if I ventured away from Orchard Road I would have found something, but I confess I needed more time. It's just that this kind of shopping can be done in any western city and many others around the world. I found Orchard Road great for people watching. I love seeing the wonderful mix of cultures. It's also a great location for picking up tours. Being the hub of action, it is a very convenient location."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Once again Orchard Road has amazed me by it's own glory!!! Shopping malls are fabulous...

if you are a true shopper, pls visit Zara's flagship store along with M&S, Paragon, ION, Tangs for clothings, perfumes, shoes and bags...Takashimaya is still there and prbably thgeir food cour still offers best food.

Orchard road is very near to the Marina area and almost all other places are 10- 15mins away (I.e. Sultan mosque,Arab street, little India etc).

Near Orchard MRT you find iconic architecture ranges from Tang plaza of ancient Chinese design to Ion Orchard with futuristic outlook. Nearer to Sommerset MRT are the upmarket Paragon and the old time name Robinson.

Apart from eating and shopping with a wide selection of restaurants/fast food and departmental stores, learn more about the history of the buildings while appreciating some of the architectural designs."

,,Must See in Singapore,5.0,,"All the money and action in Singapore centers around Orchard Road. Even if you don't have much money and are not looking for action it is worth a walk and see. I usually stay at the Marriott or the Hilton on Orchard Road. There are more upscale hotels (Mandarin Orchard for example) and you can easily stay elsewhere and take a taxi or bus.

Start at Tanglin Road and walk towards the city on Orchard. Check out the Forum and Wheelock Square for shopping. You will see lots of familiar brands on this route. Check out the local shops too. There are several Starbucks on Orchard. Orchard eventually turns into Bras Basah and your will arrive at Raffles. Stop for a drink at the Long Bar and decide where to go next."
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Orchard road is the heart of Singapore, for me. Orchard road offered nightlife (pub&bar), shopping arcade, food and beverages experience too.. Lot of dept.store that we can see in the Orchard road.. If you're hungry, in the everyside of Orchard offered f&b stalls. Asian, Western, Europe, and many kind of f&b stalls in here. Like in the front of Takashimaya, we can found Kebab. In the Takashimaya we can found Japanese f&b stalls (majority) also Western stalls, in the Lucky Plaza we can found Malaysian, Singaporean, Chinese, Indonesian's f&b stalls.. And about the speciality in this road is: THE ICE CREAM IN THE BREAD <3 ..
#fyi, if you're a Moslem, there's Al-Falah Mosque in the Bideford Road (still in the Orchard's area)

We stopped there as Porsche's are like Ford in the Uk.

There are an endless number of shops, restaurants, food courts and everything you can possibly imagine. Famous upscale stores and discount stores. I enjoyed certain malls the best.

,,Overated,3.0,,"Let's face it. Singapore is a shopping mecca but it's not cheap and it's full of high end brands at high end prices. Nothing you can't get back home if you live in a cosmopolitan city. Your time and money might be better spent in Little India or the Arab Quarter (Kampong Glam) where you might pick up something with a more local feel to it like a silk sari, alcohol free perfumes, carvings or batik."
,,Mainly eating n not shopping,3.0,,"The retailers along Orchard Road changes too quickly... It's kinda sad. However, renovations n refurbishments are well done to enhance shopping experiences. The range of shops are more on the pricey side, so i usually only go to Orchard Rd for food."

We stopped and had afternoon tea at TWG inside one of the malls. Overall we had a great day and it was nice to get out of the heat!
,,All the high end shopping ypu would expect,5.0,,Certainly a shopping hub for high end in Singapore. Every luxury brand you would expect to see is here. Prices are high compared to the same items in say Hong Kong.
,,Orchard Road Mega Shop.,4.0,,"Good for a look and a dream. Most of the stores are very high end and unless your made of money, you wont be doing much shopping there. The highlight for me was OG Department Store. There is 1 in China Town as well. If you go between Jun and August, the Singapore sales are on and there are lots of specials to be had. OG has the biggest handbag section I have seen anywhere in the world. I have 3 adult daughters, so handbags and shoes are BIG on my list. Do Yourself a favour and visit this store. You won't be disappointed.8 handbags and 7 pairs of shoes later, I had excess baggage. Ha! Nothing new, I go there everytime I go to Singapore."

Cheers Bob"
,,Shopping center,5.0,,This is like the city center for the high street mall.Love the under ground malls.You can actually walk distance without realizing it.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Every shop you could ever want or need is on Orchard Road.
Name brands are all you would come here for so make sure you go with plenty of time and money to spare as there is no such thing as a quick visit here.
We did manage to get a little lost in the area especially with the underground shopping and crossover areas but we did suvive.
You really need to be on a shopping mission with no intention of stopping to rest your feet or catch your breathe as seating was a little hard to come by unless you purchased a meal.
The area has a full on fast pace vibe that is quite mind numbing."
,,Full-on commerce,3.0,,"Not my ideal of travelling, to be frank. There are much better places to spend your time collecting sights sounds smells and memories in Singapore, but if world-class consumption is on your agenda, then go for it."
,,A must see if you are a shopper,4.0,,"We stayed right off of Orchard Road and walked it several times while there. All I can say is wow! If you are into high end designer fashion then this is a place you don't want to miss. Huge stores for some top designers- giant stores for Tory Burch, Hermes, Gucci, etc. and there are lots of restaurants around to refuel. Even if you aren't in the market for high end, a fun place to see."
,,Pretty great when you think about it,5.0,,"A lot of visitors seem to get all judge-y about Orchard, but it's great. Yes, it's a road full of malls, but no, they don't all sell the same thing. There are some repeats, but in general each mall has an interesting assortment of different shops and specialty stores. And you can walk to most of them through underground tunnels and avoid the heat and/or rain!

Some highlights for visitors who maybe don't feel the need to go to H&M on their holidays:
Ngee Ann City - Kinokuniya bookstore, Isetan (Japanese supermarket)
Ion - The observation deck, TWG Tea Company
Paragon - Din Tai Fung soup dumplings
Mandarin Gallery - Lots of interesting and fancy little cafes
Orchard Central - The Library, cheap teen clothing
313 - Great food court. Also a place that sells churros, right across the street from cute little Emerald Hill.
Plaza Singapura - Daiso, Art Friend, Several great camera stores."
,,Malls everywhwre,5.0,,"Every building on the street is a mall. I don't see why this could be a tourist attraction though. But it's clean, busy and you will not know how time goes by."
,,If you can't find it on orchard road it don't exist,4.0,,"Shopping and food go hand in hand along orchard road, has changed slot over the years but has been the shopping destination of choice for a long while. Not the cheapest and bargain hunters are often disappointed but loads of choice. June and July during the great Singapore sale and Christmas bargains are good times to shop but it's a busy busy place.
Food stops include food halls, hawker stalls, coffee shops, cafe, chain restaurants to upmarket Michelin star spots. (I have a couple of favorite places to wait while the wife indulges in her sport of choice, pity shopping is not part of the Olympics)
Back to the shopping if you haven't been before don't just visit the new flash department stores and ritzy buildings check out the older arcades and small traders as well."
,,Shopping galore,4.0,,Really is a street made for shoppers. Northern part has a few plazas that have some cheaper stuff. Lots of places to eat everywhere too.
,,Shopping..Shopping and Shopping,5.0,,This is where you will find a long row of malls fitted with all designer outlets you carve for.

,,So many shops,4.0,,A busy area of Singapore with lots of shopping above and below the road. A must for serious shoppers. However the Australian dollar being much the same as the Singapore dollars it may be difficult to find any super bargains here. Haggling over price rarely happens here. There is much variety though. Bargains may be found in other parts of the city.

There are some restaurants along the way, the rest are inside the shopping centres."
,,A laundromat !! in Orchard,5.0,,"Was told there was NO LAUNDROMAT in Orchard. ""Rent too expensive... cannot survive...you have to take MRT further from Orchard"". Well, I researched and found the one (actually two, but they have the same name -- kinda slimey to do that) that was posted online in Far East Plaza -- $100, no thank you. Came across Aunty's Laundry at 360 Orchard. Again not cheap, but the owner was more sympathetic to my ASTONISHMENT of the $50 for 3kg (a few shorts,and t-shirts)... and when I saw the small laundry machine, I understood the limitations of the laundry machine... certainly, not the capacity of a Canadian apartment-sized stackable laundry machine. I removed half my laundry and gave them my essentials to launder and deliver to my hotel. To my amazement, the bag of neatly washed-folded-minipackaged-and-sealed laundry was indeed waiting for me same day. They were awesome! and worth the money. Thank you, guys."
,,Leave your credit cards at the hotel,5.0,,"A good old couple hour stroll throughout this beautiful road will make your wife happy, specially if you're in your honeymoon. The street is safe, there are outdoor activities going on, and also tons of stores, a very relevant number of which are haute couture, including 2 Louis Vuitton boutiques in less than 2 blocks, something I'm still trying to figure out.

If you want your kids to be able to attend college, leaving the wallet in the hotel's deposit box isn't a bad idea. Also, don't ask your wife to hold your credit card in her bag for you the night before."
,,very superb for shopping lovers,4.0,,"you will get all luxurious brands here , it has theaters shopping complex international brands store"

,,The place to shop,4.0,,"As you would expect from any main road shopping experience, Orchard Road has shopping malls stacked side by side with every name shop all trying to help you spend your money. An interesting place to visit and experience, though my wife and I were a little tired by the time we got there."
,,"A very impressive row full of sights, shops and sounds...",5.0,,"My 14-day visit saw me walking along this famed street everyday from Orchard Parade Hotel to Somerset. I hardly did so underground (except to cross from Wheelock Place to Ion - seeing its the only way to do so to get to the other side). I prefer the pavement and marvel at the impressive mega stores lined up neatly in a row - all offering something to both locals and tourists: high end shops, affordable shops, food, entertainment, street perfromers and other strollers who number in the hundreds at any given time. Its most pleasant early morning where the silence is only disturbed by the swish of the broom by the sweeper and a jogger here and there. In the afternoon and evening, the street is packed - with order. Watch out for bats who dwell on the trees lining the boulevard - they chirp like birds in unison and aften drop their ""gifts"" to unsuspecting pedestrians. It's a must do for all visitors - which I trust will be memorable."
,,Good to take a stroll,3.0,,"For the people who do not buy upmarket luxury products, this market would offer a treat to the eyes with the best designer products. The hustle bustle on this road is enthusing enough to make a stroll worthwhile.
For the cult designer lovers, this place is a heaven !"

,,A Must Do while in Singapore,5.0,,Orchard Road is famous and therefore a must see for all travellers. We walked from one end to the other both day and night as there is quite a difference when all the buskers come out and the lights are amazing.
,,chilling with friends and family,5.0,,"Just by strolling along this strip is a journey in itself. Peaceful, relaxing and comforting. It was such a pleasure to take a walk while watching people from all walks of life passing through. If you need to just relax and breath fresh air, Orchard Road is the answer."
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",4.0,,"If you want to do some shopping and you have time to spare you can easily lose a day (or a few) walking along Orchard Road. Escape the heat and humidity by popping inside the massive, air conditioned shopping centres and shop till you drop. It's also very easy to get a taxi anywhere along Orchard Road, especially around the exits of the shopping centres."
,,Main Shopping Belt of Singapore,5.0,,"The main shopping belt of Singapore, where you can get almost anything and everything. Orchard Road is a relatively straight road that spans from Dobby Ghaut subway station all the way to Orchard station. Most of the action happen between the Orcahrd and Somerset stations. Many larger stores offer tax refund for tourists so be sure to check. There are also many restaurants and eateries along this stretch."
,,Shopping Paradise of many Branded stuffs,5.0,,"If you have the money to spend Orchard Road is a must visit for high flyers. But of course, there are many shops that offer good bargains too at all the Shopping Centres along this whole stretch of Orchard Road.
Budget hunters should try the food courts where self service is the normal activities locally for delicious local food, like Nasi Lemak, Laksa (a bit spicy white rice noodles cook with coconut juice), Fried Char Kway Teow (rice flat white noodles or yellow noodles), Rojak (mixed Chinese salads with a Malay name mixed in prawn black paste with or without Chilli paste of your choice and top with grind peanuts).
Satay (Barbeque meats like kebab dipped in peanut sauce).
Fish balls soup with or without noodles, springy and nice. Hokkien fried noodles is a must try. It's like Chinese spaghetti fried with calamari and prawns & bean sprouts. A must try of those mentioned and many more especially Chicken rice."
,,"Photography, Sightseeing",4.0,,Come visit Singapore... Expensive City with value... Historical Values.... Full of entertainment ... Day or night...
,,"Shopaholics dream, but prices generally high",4.0,,Bustling with upmarket stores and browsing shoppers to fill them. All ver y clean and air conditioned but prices have risen generally over the years so dont expect to get great bargains here any more! Easy access via the SMRT
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"For those with a taste for designer luxury and shopping malls (we counted at least 10), Orchard road will feel like heaven to you. It is similar to shopping boulevards in big cities - except this is very high-end - so bring loads of money. If shopping is not your thing, then do the road for the experience and grab lunch while killing time."
,,After Many Years It Still Stacks Up As A Shopping Precinct!,5.0,,"We had felt that this area had really lost its mojo some years back. To be fair this visit redefined Orchard Road for us; great brands, attentive staff, spilt for choice really!
After Sydney, Melbourne and Jakarta Singapore's Orchard Road just has so much more to offer as literally the whole world is based right here on this small muddy island at the foot of the Malaysian Peninsular!
As a shopping experience we still felt that the Metro complex had great specials that we would never experience back in Australia. Go and check it out - every brand that you can imagine and a whole lot more!
It is great to see Orchard Road so alive in 2016!"
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"Every shop and eatery you want can be found on Orchard Road. From department stores,such as Takashimaya, to international clothing stores, such as Marks and Spenser, from Jamie's Italian to Asian food halls, Gucchi to Prada you will find it on Orchard Road."
,,Mall heaven,4.0,,"If you like giant, modern, luxury brand based Malls -nether Orchard Road is for you. However my favourite Mall was the Lucky Plaza on a Sunday afternoon. It was absolutely rammed with local ladies- I have never seen so many people in one mall- and the noise of chatter was just a buzz- a physical energy that was electrifying- brilliant place to have been and so much better than the grand luxury malls."
,,Shopping street with beautiful buildings and plea to eat,5.0,,"Our hotel is situated 5 steps away from the Orchard road. It is a beautiful street that had many shopping centers, restaurants, coffee shops and different shops from Various brands to high street shopping."
,,Make sure you have plenty of Money,4.0,,"Lots and lots of expensive designer shops in malls, and also several big brand name shops as well. Nice to go window shopping as that's what most people can afford"
,,Extreme shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the affluent, capitalism-driven side of Singapore condensed until it becomes a diamond, a shopping diamond.

If you like shopping, then you can spend a full day or maybe three just going from one giant luxury mall to the next. Yes, there are malls all over Singapore, maybe more than anyplace else, but these are the posh ones, the fancy ones, rivaled only by the shopping at the Sands Resort.

If you got money to spend, this is where to spend it. If you are more of a budget traveler, you can still have a wander, look at the young and the beautiful as they float from one store to the next, the luxury cars that zoom along the street, and enjoy the artwork that many of the malls here have invested a pretty penny into."
,,Crowded,4.0,,"This particular location is always crowded as it consists of lot of malls in this area. You can get all kinds of stuffs for shopping and also restaurants to choose from.

But didn't spend much time here as it was over crowded at the evening time. People with patience and who love shopping would love this place."
,,Good Place,5.0,,"This is a good place to find and buy souvenirs. Plenty of options with affordable price. If visit Singapore, this is one of the place you must visit"
,,Main Shoping area,3.0,,"You get all the main high street stores along this road, All major transport along this road, Buses, Metro, taxis"
,,Same shopping frenzy,3.0,,"Orchard road may have been a nice shopping area in the past, but what to do with all these new malls with all the same Louis Vuitton and Chanel shops in each mall? More of the same I'd say."
,,The shopping precinct not to be missed,5.0,,Shop until you drop in Orchard Road. Heaps to see and loads of shops to buy anything and everything.
,,Best Shopping Experience - Luxury Travelers,4.0,,Great shopping experience but mainly for Luxury travelers. You can find all luxury brands in this area in different shopping malls. A big street with soo many shopping malls adjoining with each other. Dont forget to try Biscuit ice cream on the street :)
,,Orchard road-- always festive in colours and lights,4.0,,"walking through the orchard road in Singapore is a must. its a paradise for the shoppers with all brand shops along the road, and Takashimaya on the opposite. however i liked orchard as a place to enjoy the ambiance, the festivity in lights on the above and everywhere with festoons and banners. you can enjoy your privacy amidst a crowd by sitting in a bench or on the steps of the shopping malls with a sandwich ice cream from the cart, or you can cross the road and enjoy hours of flipping through latest books in kinukuniya at Takashimaya. evenings are cool with soft breeze and occasional quick shower of rain. you can try local foods at Lucky Plaza food court nearby or go to Clark qui for a sea food dinner."
,,Lots of modern buildings,4.0,,"Visit orchard road on any occasions like Christmas, new year. Whole street is decorated with colourful lights and people come down here to celebrate the occasion

Food is little costly here, so just come here for treat to your eyes.... If you wanna treat your taste buds then be prepared to spend extra dollars"
,,Vibrant cosmopolitan,4.0,,"The best place in the heart of city where you find the rythem, pace and trendiest part of the little red dot."
,,Great shopping !!,5.0,,"Great for shopping for almost everything a tourist may want. Paragon the most expensive, lucky plaza the cheapest and 313 Orchard for in between."
,,People Watch Central,4.0,,"Great place to see & be seen- Don't miss TANG's the department store (like an American Neiman Marcus) - checkout Takashimaya reasonably priced & a local institution.
An expensive part of town but easy to walk around & very colorful especially over Christmas which lasts for about 4months ...Sep thru Dec.
Like almost all of Singapore it's VERY safe to walk around day or nite.
Can get busy weekends"
,,Most popular street in Singapore,5.0,,"What Oxford Street is to London is Orchard Road in Singapore. If you are in Singapore it is probably impossible to miss this happening stretch of 3 km or so. You will find number of stsr hotels, malls, eateries, restaurants and throbbing night life and what not in this place. During the day thils is usual busy business place and come evening this place becomes full of life and partying pkace. You can find all famous brand shops around this place. I love this and always make sure that I stay in this area."
,,Mall after Mall after Mall,2.0,,"Singapore has restaurants and malls in abundance, and the mall portion of the equation is especially intensive on Orchard Road. I suppose it's a great place to shop, but the massive crowds, long blocks, and huge structures (that all look alike at night) make traversing the road a challenge. The good news is that it's easy to catch a cab to get away from Orchard Road. I do have my favorite stores (Metro at Centrepoint Mall and Spotlight at Plaza Singapura), and there are great restaurants tucked away, but in general if you are on a short visit to Singapore there are many better places to visit. Just one opinion."
,,A visit to Singapore must include Orchard Road,5.0,,"While we don't need to haunt any more shops, the obligatory walk along Orchard Road is such a wonderful experience each time we come to Singapore. We always see things we've never seen before - or eat at a different restaurant each time. Just love the atmosphere, street hawkers, buskers and just being here. Singapore caters with the crowds so well, everyone is so well behaved and courteous to each other, directions are very clear and they really know how to move lots of people quickly. The escalators travel quite fast and cover many stories both above ground and in the shopping centres below ground. Love it. Love it. Love it."
,,Organised Chaos!,3.0,,"We did the obligatory trip to Orchard Road to experience shopping Singapore style!! On the helpful advice of our taxi drivers, we started at the Ion Shopping Centre which is all top shelf labels and brands and then progressed through a few tunnels to other shopping centres which were progressively busier. Suddenly we popped out onto Orchard Road itself heaved a big sigh of relief. I was starting to think we would never find our way out alive. If you want to shop until you drop go the Orchard Road!!"
,,Ever changing and ever busy,5.0,,"The shopping malls here are ever changing. Although I liive in singapore all my life, everytime I go to orchard, it's different . There bound to be new malls, shops , restaurant sprouting out.
Now with so many poke stops in orchard, it will get busy with not only tourist , but also locals busy catching pokemons."
,,Just crowd...,3.0,,"Orchard Road has started to lose its charm recently, especially with the introduction of online shopping. However, it's still really crowded during the weekends and at nights when people go over to find good restaurants for meals or catch up with their friends.

There's just a whole stretch of malls, and I will go down the stretch, letting you know their specialties.

1) Lucky Plaza (right beside Goodwood Park Hotel)
A good place to start. A place for youngsters and some blogshops. One of the cheapest foods you can find in the area, with a nice chicken rice stall at the top and Ayam Penyat Ria. A good standing sushi bar is there as well. If you are looking for variety of clothes at cheap prices, this is the place to go. If not, go for the food, it's cheap and good.

2) Royal Scotts Plaza
High end mall, with designer shops and many nice mid-eats/fine dining places. Not bad brunch place.

3) Tangs Departmental Store
One of the oldest departmental stores with a wide range of shopping. Getting a little obsolete of course. Still can find some good deals here.

4) Orchard Ion
One of the nicest building in the area. Relatively new, can go up to level 55 to catch the top view. Can take underpass to Wheelock Place which has a nice Jap restaurant Sun with Moon and some boutique shops. Nearby is the Shaw Lido for movie watching. Quite a nice theatre.

5) Wisma Atria
Basically from here onwards, the shops get quite similar at every shopping mall. Wisma I would recommend for the Din Tai Fung and the Jap Food Town at the top! This is the passageway to Takashimaya for most people!

6) Takashimaya
Great food at basement. Sometimes great bazaars (u can check their website). Good restaurants upstairs. High end shopping! You can find all your branded stuffs here. Good souvenir stop at the takashimaya departmental store for people who matter more, because it's more expensive.

7) Lucky Plaza
Underpass to Lucky Plaza, slightly dodgy looking place. Very cheap perfumes etc. This is for pirated stuff at a cheaper price. Filled with Phillipinos etc. Great food on top, the Yong Tau Foo is magnificent. One of the better places to buy Singapore souvenirs in bulk.

Very lazy, but the rest is generally the same. You have Paragon (high end shopping), Orchard Central (weird design but really good restaurants here), 313 Somerset (more shopping), Mandarin Gallery (Good brunch places and more shopping) etc etc...Generally the same, shops close about 9plus 10pm so you can walk the stretch down.

Anything later, you can walk to Alley Bar area opposite 313 Somerset, whereby the bars are quite happening at night. Or you can head to Cuppage Plaza to enjoy a cuppa at the starbucks there.

Way too crowded these days and the things are quite similar...."
,,Amazzzzzzing,5.0,,"Look out the world and we will see everything here, If you have a million $ you will spend out right away !"
,,Great way to spend time!,4.0,,"I've gone many times during weekends or evening time. Great place to shop, eat or simply to chill with friends nd family!"
,,Insane shopping street - busy,3.0,,This is the main place for big brand shopping and upmarket dining. All restaurants in the shopping centres had a queue and service was poor. Loads of people playing Pokemon Go instead of watching where they are walking. Would go back despite the crowds.
,,Inflated are to do shopping,2.0,,"The shopping district in Singapore with tons of cut throat price when you properly can get it cheaper in the heartland area. During sunday the place became a picnic place for the Philippines women and guys. Buying any branded goods, might get it cheaper in your own country."
,,Just shop after shop,3.0,,The main street in Singapore but the shopping malls are just full of the same mix of shops you see anywhere else. How many Cartier and Louis Vuitton boutiques can you browse through before reaching boredom.
,,Lucky Plaza,4.0,,Shopping galore Lucky Plaza is a good place to find a bargain very well priced the other shops are a bit pricey but bargains are there just got to look
,,Busy busy busy,4.0,,What a busy place and pricey. Luckily for me it was straight to Abercombie and then we got out of the hustle and bustle of the place. Great for shopping.
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,There does not need to be another review of Orchard road. There are 17 stunning and unique (although the same shops sometimes is not unique) shopping centres on one road. Go at Christmas time and other festivals to see how Orchard Road gets into the spirit with amazing decorations. Top malls include Takishimaya and Ion as well as the long standing Tangs shopping centre. For some of the best Chicken rice in the whole country - try Far East Plaza just off Orchard road. A well kept secret..
,,Crowded and overprised,1.0,,"Plenty of huge malls in one street, hotels and restaurants. For shopper fanatics may be paradise, all luxury brands are there. For me these are not interesting since I look for special Singaporean things. The great sale is a trick, not really reduced prices."
,,Very beautiful,5.0,,This is shopping road in Singapore. Many Luxurious shops on thid road. Compare to burgis and China town shops the quality good but very expensive
,,"High end brands, lots of hotels, tons of restaurants!",5.0,,"This is the paradise for shopping high end retail. Prada, Versace, Tods, Gucci etc. Lots of high end hotels are clustered around here: Four Seasons, St Regis, Shangri La, Hyatt, Marriott are all clustered here.. Keep in mind that these hotels cater to business travelers.. Some really good restaurants in the area like Tandoor, Song of India and Buona Terra. If you want to be near the beaches/amusement parks, it is better to stay near Sentosa."
,,"High end shops, overpriced for US Dollar",4.0,,"Orchard road is a shoppers paradise! It is filled with wonderful malls, high end shops and restaurants. Unfortunately the prices were significantly higher for the same item that I could buy in the US so the exchange rate was not worth it!"
,,Caters for all,4.0,,"Orchard Road is perfect for shopping - souvenir shopping is great at the Lucky Plaza with the same prices as Chinatown. Clothing shopping - high end to affordable for all. There are a great many plazas (malls) with a huge variety and price range. There are also street cafes, fast food places and restaurants. I loved Orchard Road and spent as much of my free time as I could there."
,,Not for me,4.0,,Walking along orchard road just for singapore ambience.. It feels like i don't belong here hahaha Too expensive for shopping (for me)
,,shopping street with all luxury brands,5.0,,"For Zara, forever 21, Victoria's secret and Charles & Kieth go to somerset mall 313. and H&M around the corner with 4 story building. piece of advice carry your passport for tax refund above shopping of 100SGD"
,,High glam luxury malls,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the Knightsbridge of London. All the biggest, most glamourous stores on in this 2 km stretch of Singapore. You can find all the big brands located in the shiny malls that dominate this famous shopping belt. The newest mall is Ion which houses all the usual suspect luxury fashion brands on lower floors and the mass market brands on the basement levels. Nice food court with a huge selection. The other 2 malls which dominate are Ngee Ann City and Paragon. You can find everything from all around the world in Orchard Road.
A hidden gem for foodies is the small little food outlet in the basement of Tangs Department store. There are only a few hawkers set up here but the food is great."
,,Awesome!,4.0,,"Love to see the ambience in this road. No traffic, no polution, everything seems right in their place. Won't forget my first experience with SGD1 ice cream here. It really tasty."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"if you love shopping then this is the area to visit, from all your designer name brands to all other types of shopping this is the area where you can get some retail therapy !!!"
,,Best road,5.0,,It is the one of the road/street in Singapore. Its a must visit attraction during your stay at Sinagpore
,,Nice,5.0,,It is convenient to go places from here. You can shop all you want without running out of store to visit. And the people is really friendly.
,,Shopping with extremes,5.0,,This shopping area has it all from the really expensive and exclusive shops to shops that cater for bargain hunters. Mainly split in terms of malls with Lucky Plaza at one end of the market to Ion Orchard at the other end. Probably best to do your homework on which shops you want to visit or just simply walk around and explore. You'll need plenty of time to do that though. Many malls have restaurants and food courts so no need to worry about where to eat.
,,Comfortable Environment But Lacks Characters,3.0,,"If you are a shopper, this is probably heaven (as long as you have the money). Orchard Road is perhaps one of the grandest luxury shopping precinct of the world. However, it seems to lack characters that other corners of Singapore has (e.g. Clarke Quay, Bugis)"
,,Camera Comp Specialist Pte Ltd 220 Orchard Road,3.0,,"There is a great deal of very positive comments about Singapore which can be found by tourists researching this incredible destination. However, there is very little information provided by way of warnings to unwary visitors about the scum who prey on those tourists who are inexperienced or easily manipulated.
It is easy to dismiss these situations with the admonishment ""let the buyer beware"", but the reality is that most people automatically assume a level of honesty based on their own 'home' environment whilst at the same time their judgement is most often affected by a variety of external factors such as being in “holiday mode”, being in another country, dealing with people of a different nationality, etc.
Tourists do have a responsibility to protect their own interests but it is an indictment of the tourism authorities that they do not provide a facility for tourists to lodge effective complaints relating to these unsavoury dealings and naming/shaming those who are known to carry out such practices.
In my case as an almost 70 year old visitor to Singapore I was cheated out of several thousand dollars by Camera Comp Specialist Pte Ltd of 220 Orchard Road by being charged more than was originally quoted for various items as well as being sold incompatible and over-priced accessories. I realise I should have known better and cannot explain how or why I was so easily duped, other than the fact that I accepted what I was being told. However I would like to help others avoid either the financial or mental stress or the physical pain (caused by an angina attack) brought about by my experience with this company.
I strongly advise anyone visiting Singapore to Google the Company name to see how they operate and definitely not to have any dealings with Camera Comp Specialist Pte Ltd of 220 Orchard Road."
,,Stroll along the City!,5.0,,"I read blogs about this road and got curios and interested at the same time. They said that this is a new tourist hub in Singapore, actually I just planned to go there to grab an ever famous ice cream sandwich. Nevertheless, I enjoyed walking along this road."
,,Shop and explore,5.0,,"While the street itself is relatively similar to Oxford street or les champs-Élysées with a couple of department stores with food courts what sets this street apart from the others are the side streets where one can suddenly leave the hustle and bustle behind and suddenly enter another world, made of colonial style houses and some of the most amazing cars (both antique and new) I have ever seen."
,,Fun,5.0,,Expensive but fun. Definitely a wow factor and you are able to get anything you are looking for. Incredible food and service all round.
,,Shopping extravaganza,5.0,,"Orchard road is by far the shopping epicentre of Singapore. All the high-end designer names can be foud here, either in their own building or in one of the many massive shopping malls. If you need a break from all the shopping there are plenty of food courts, fruit and juice stalls etc. to get you ready for your next round of shopping. Black belt shoppers can easily spent a couple of days here!"
,,Fantastic malls all on one road,5.0,,Fantastic malls with designer brands. Sales were great. Shopping is expensive compared to Europe. Takes months to cover all the malls. Lovely food courts in all the malls with an array of food varieties.
,,pubs and bars,4.0,,seems all the night life activity is located here. bars offer happy hours after midnight until 6 or 7 am
,,It's a day to visit it!!!,5.0,,It's a very nice place to visit. Lot's of malls (you get lost easily). The life is around this road. Several restaurants and places to visit.
,,Fantastic Shopping,5.0,,Well designed shopping experience. MRT is close by most shopping destinations. High end shops and discount shopping available.
,,A must-visit in Singapore.,5.0,,It is actually quite a pleasant walk from one side of Orchard to another in either direction. Plenty of opportunities to shop and grab refreshments along the way. Even the old school ice cream sellers. Quite a contrast to the super modern and posh boutiques/shopping centers. :)
,,Big Brands.. Big Names,4.0,,good and lively colourful place.... You would find lot of Malls and Brand outlets and fashionastas everywhere. I Enjoy the stroll on orchard road whenever i go there.
,,best shopping place ever,4.0,,"if you really wanted to have branded bags, shoes and clothes definitely one of the best place you can find anything and everything here just walk around and just see whats best for you."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Great choices of high end retailers and also good place to find a local tailor to have that little something made , once returned home you can always order and have posted as they retain your measurements. We found a couple of good tailors and the quality of workmanship was very good."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"I love shopping at CK Tangs , wheel lock , Metro , Mark Spencer's ,Toys R Us. Orchard is the best place for shopping."
,,Main Shopping District,4.0,,"You can find some of the best stores and best restaurants here. But during last visit, Orchard was less crowded than years before."
,,So so shopping,3.0,,I liked Orchard Road I actually stayed here for 5 days I was a bit disappointed because there seemed to be no spark or no energy. There aren't many restaurants and I was disappointed because there just wasn't any activity going on it just seems kind of dead and there are really expensive retail shops. It's still a nice walk and there are some really nice restaurants but there aren't as many as I had hoped.
,,Has lost a bit of its character over the years,3.0,,This used to be one of the main attractions of Singapore in the 80/90ies but the area is no longer the most attractive part of the city. It is still a main shopping area and the new Ion mall is quite impressive. Nice to visit but do not linger too long.....
,,Come experience the new metro in centre point,4.0,,"Metro departmental store is an old store has been around many decades. It has lost it shines as years goes by, product become un interesting. So I've stop going there for many years.
But since they took over the space which was occupied by robinson department they has improved alot.
They have wider range of products carry popular brand and has a good lay out and helpful staff. I once laugh at the staff, I told her you have a nice store but not enough crowd but again if you are crowded you don't have good service like now. She laughed.
Is really a wonderful store worth visiting and they have promotion often."
,,Great place to visit.,5.0,,"You can find many different malls, lots and lots of trendy shops as well as street ones. Prices range from expensive to inexpensive. Anyone can go there and buy something accordingly one's possessions and means without breaking the bank. You can get there by taxi, bus, metro, or by just walking from your hotel. It is worthwhile to visit if not just for the window shopping."
,,"""So much to see""",4.0,,"So many shopping and eating experiences to be had here. You can walk for miles, enjoying this beautiful Street in this beautiful City."
,,Walk of shop,4.0,,"Had many many times to walk through Orchard road. Quite green with many big trees to bring shady paths, but there is at least one spot that need more trees, next to Hilton hotel. Suggest to put water vapored fans on the street during hot July August season. Pedestrian crossing between ION and Wheelock was closed, while underground crossing was confusing and no clear sign, suggest to reopen surface pedestrian crossing. Many shops are available along the road, price was much better in the past few years back, now is a bit overprice. But it is still a good place to walk to shop."
,,The vive,4.0,,"Though a bit tiring for elderly couple, but Orchard road is very vibrant and full of activities. All good trendy malls are located in this street. It is connected with SMRTs. Easy access for all. Covered with big trees. If it rains, one can take shelter in the malls. Lots of street food shops. One can buy according to one's pocket."
,,Shopping in Orchard road,3.0,,"Lots of high end shops here so don't expect any real bargains. A lot of the stuff is end of line or superceded & is only a few $ off. If you shop long & hard enough you may come out with a bargain. I found half price Nike's, but the thing was they were not in my size, a lot of the shopping is like that & mot that many European sizes. But a good way to while away the hours."
,,Great for window shopping and street photography!,4.0,,"Shopping wise, there is no doubt that Orchard Road is the place to go for those who are in Singapore for a shopping trip. Orchard Road is basically a long chain of shopping malls which are able to cater to a wide range of budgets, from your mass produced Uniqlo or H&M everyday clothing, all the way to your Louis Vuitton designer handbag. Because competition is very intense here, shopping malls often undergo renovation and changes often, so you may see a different look every time you come down to Orchard Road.

Even if you are not there to shop, even window shopping can be a good exercise to spend a few hours there with. However, in my opinion, Orchard Road is one of the few places in Singapore to do some great street photography. For the street photographer out there, this will be a sort of a paradise to get that gritty street angle feel. During weekends and public holidays, people will tend to dress better when going to Orchard Road.

If you are feeling tired and hungry from all that walking, there are plenty of food choices everywhere, and of course, do not forget to get some ice cream from the mobile ice cream stalls all along the pedestrian pavement that will provide some respite from the heat.

Overall, it is a good place to go if you are a first time visitor to Singapore, or if you are in Singapore specifically to do some street photography. I would actually recommend going further out of Orchard Road or elsewhere for better bargains and prices though."
,,Expensive,3.0,,Lots to see and lots to buy. But very pricey too. Good for those who are in S'pore to shop. Otherwise nothing special. Shopping in other countries may be cheaper.
,,Amazing road,5.0,,"It's amazing place in Singapore. A lot of mall and activities around there's. The length of the road around three kilometers you can walking to shopping with a lot of brands shop and another

Also a lot of restaurants and coffee shop located there

I think it's one of the important road in the Singapore"
,,OXFORD STREET LONDON BUT BETTER BECAUSE ITS GOT DESIGNER SHOPS,5.0,,A street similar to Oxford Street London but better looking buildings and very classy. Lots of places to eat. Loads of seating areas when you get tired of walking. The decorations are fantastic at Christmas.
,,The Oxford Street of Singapore,4.0,,Bustling busy street of malls. If you love shopping you will live Singapore. It got to the stage where I couldn't walk into one more shopping centre!
,,A shoppers paradise.,4.0,,Looking for branded products from all over the world? Come to Orchard road. A true shoppers dream including places to relax over an inexpensive or excellent gourmet meal.
,,Over Hyped and Over Priced,2.0,,"This place is all about Shopping , Shopping and Shopping. Mostly all items are substantially overpriced which you can get almost half price in your Home City. today in the world of Globalization, there is no thing that you cannot buy at your Home City and cheaper too. so for me it was only some souvenirs, which now complement my Glass Cabinet :)"
,,Shopping Shopping,4.0,,Orchard Road- the name itself brings before my eyes the huge malls and favourite restaurants. One can just stroll around if you have the time on hand. Everyone ultimately discovers their own choice of mall/restaurant. But not advisable for the budget shopper who can always head to Bugis street.
,,Just another overpriced shopping centre,3.0,,"We went to orchard road expecting something out of the ordinary, we were disappointed.

Most of the times I come here just to look around, window shopping, watch people passing and have a bite of the Singapore's version of ice cream sandwich. As Singapore is one of the safest country, it is also safe to walk here even if you have loads of shopping bags you carry after going inside every shops.

,,All the brands you want in one place,4.0,,"Orchard Road is rightly described as a shoppers paradise, especially if you're looking for international and high end brands - they're all here. So are all the high street brands. Basically you can buy any sort of fashion or beauty or accessory item you want. Depending on the season ie. winter you can even get puffer jackets and ski gear despite the tropical temperatures outside. There is also heaps of food available from super cheap - go to Far East Plaza - to super expensive. ION Orchard is at the 'top' of Orchard Road and is home to big name brands from Europe and America. If you're looking for something a bit more 'Asian' you can try Tangs - which is directly opposite ION. Then you've got a bunch of malls running down both sides of the road until you reach the end at Plaza Singapura which is home to a lot of Japanese brands. You can also just about walk from one end of the road to the other without ever going outside via underpasses; plus there are three MRT or subway stops along the one road - Orchard (ION), Somerset (313), Dhoby Gaut (Plaza Sing). If you're looking for a bit 'character' then head to Emerald Hill (for food and bars and shophouses) - which is about halfway along the road on the same side as Tangs. But if you want to really get the 'feel' of Singapore and Southeast Asia you're better off heading off Orchard Road to Tiong Bharu."
,,Shopper's paradise!,5.0,,This place is every shopper's paradise and a heaven. Be prepared to walk around and explore. There are all high end brands and few street brands. You don't really need to buy a tour for this.

,,Another visit to Orchard Road from Australia,5.0,,Always something to see each time one visits Orchard Rd. We have been going to Singapore yearly since 2005. What changes & shopping experiences we have had. We always stay about a 5 minute walk to the centre of Orchard. Everything at your finger tips. MRT in the ION will take you anywhere you want to go . Taxis readily available at a very cheap reliable rate.Just a beautiful Rd & full of shade trees.

,,LONG WALK OF SHOPPING MALLS,4.0,,"We walked probably half of Orchard Road and decided that all the shopping malls had much the same thing. Prices were on a par with prices in Australia, no great bargains anymore."
,,Hm...,3.0,,"Malls malls & more malls, with some office blocks - that is all you will see on orchard. I guess it's great if you want to blow up a few thousand dollars on overpriced branded merchandise since theirs a large presence of international brands. Some good eating places are their, for the children paragon shopping center has a very good play area, also the food hall in paragon & ngee ann city & food courts in tangs & ion orchard are worth a look."
,,Only for Shopping,5.0,,"Orchard road is god for shopping and big shopping area with lots of international brands.
But Malls are very beautiful and they have many options for dine

Lots of food stores and hotels here. You will enjoy walking any time of the day as you will see attractions along the whole stretch of the road. You'll be glad to see interesting people from different cultures. We stayed in one of the hotels here and we never had problem buying stuff we need or accessing other locations from Orchard as we were minutes away from the MRT and few steps away from taxi and bus stand. Indeed, location! location! location! :-)"
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,If you are a person that loves to shop a lot then I insist that you go to orchard because there are tons of places to shop around... Great View Public Transportation to Orchard Road is there

,,Amazing shopping,4.0,,Orchard Rd is well worth visiting with shopping suitable to all budgets.Shopping plazas have endless array of shopping outlets.
,,Best shopping street in Singapore,5.0,,Orchard Road has malls with premium brands. Must visit for shopping. I will recommend 313 which hosts a mix of expensive and medium-range brands.
,,Shopping galore!,4.0,,"Shop your heart out girls :) the walk can be long, hot and... heavy (depending on how much you buy haha) hopefully it doesnt rain!
Super busy and fast paced, just like everywhere else in the city. Lights are beautiful at night, especially in December for Christmas... it is the best."
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"I love it here. There wasn't a day wherein we didn't go here; and we stayed for a total of 6 days! This is a place where you can find EVERYTHING. Prepare your feet to hurt and to get tired! WE WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK HERE! It's a must-go destination if you're a shopaholic. You can find BIG DESIGNER brands here like LV, Gucci, etc. But this place also caters for the middle-range like Forever 21, HnM, Zara, and more."
,,Shoppers delight,4.0,,Busy and expensive but you should take the time to see it at least once. Every high end shop from at least three continents is represented. The best bargain is McDonald's 80 cent ice cream cone.
,,5th Avenue,4.0,,"If you need a busy shopping day, walk along Orchard Rd. Satisfaction guaranteed. Also stop at a cafe or just embark into the underground shopping experince."
,,Shopping,5.0,,This place is very lively and full of shopping places and malls everywhere. I like this place and I also stayed on this road in the Grand Park Orchard hotel. Even at night there is alot box movement of cars everywhere especially on weekends. Great stuff!!
,,Shopping day,5.0,,"Just have to love the space, brands and options for anything! Buzzy, high energy but heaps of fun. If it rains just stay inside the beautiful shopping malls. Only go to size 12 in men's shoes and 8 in ladies but fantastic fun just looking."
,,"Ready, Steady...Shop",4.0,,"My first advise is wear comfortable footwear otherwise you'll spoil the trip. With all due respect to ladies out there, there might as well but a large sign for men to keep out!
Gentleman, if you love life like l do, my suggestion for you is leave your girls in charge, close your eyes and hopefully you lock yourself away in a man cave nearby...translation, find a pub or bar nearby and don't call them, they'll call you when ready.

This place is a shopping icon ....can't say anymore than this. Happy shopping girls!!"
,,New shops never stop opening up!,4.0,,"I used to visit Singapore quarterly until a few years ago I changed jobs. But no matter how often I visit Orchard, there's always something NEW!"
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,What an exciting busleing main shopping precinct. From high end boutiques to shady basement retailers there's something for everyone. Love the underground air conditioned maze which links the buildings. Wear comfortable shoes.
,,Always great shopping!,5.0,,"Anyone who has been to Singapore knows of Orchard Road. Shop till you drop literally! Always something going on; new shops, eating places and of course the cleanliness. Busy, busy, busy no matter what time of the day or night."
,,Malls,2.0,,"If you want to shop expensive mall after mall then here ya go. We wanted some unique culture, which I guess is super malls? We did find a cool conveyor belt sushi place nearby, which was awesome and cheap. But not our cup of tea."
,,The essence of Singapore,4.0,,"We stayed literally steps for Orchard Road and a few minutes’ walk from the MRT stop for Orchard road which was a great location.
So Orchard Road is all about shopping. There are an insane number of malls. They are literally everywhere and it is not easy to tell the difference. ION was quite near our hotel and had an absolutely gigantic H&M (there is an even bigger free standing one further down Orchard road). It is also quite photogenic at night – got that futuristic feel that Singapore is so good at. My favourite was the mall at the mandarin oriental hotel (333 Orchard Road). This was a three story mall but it contained quite a few cute boutique stores by what appeared to be local designers. Surprisingly these stores were not that expensive – about SD$150 for a frock.
The best part of the malls are the food courts. There is broad choice, quality is high and the costs very reasonable. I do suggest you take your own tissues though – it was very difficult to find napkins at any of the food courts we visited. Some did have hand washing stations which were great for post meal but not really effective when you have just shelled a prawn."
,,Love it,5.0,,Great for shopping very clean very neat one of the best places in this island did I mention great shopping one of the most expensive stores in the world but you still can find some stores in a good budget nice restaurant a lot of traffic but most of all is the safest place on you can be
,,Visit the little out of the way shops,5.0,,Great to walk down here and shop. Don't worry about the big name shops. They are in all the big malls and at the airport anyway. Go to the little out of the way shops. They have more character.
,,Don't expect outlet prices,5.0,,"This street reminds you of Chicago Million Dollar Mile. high end shopping at its best here. The great thing about it is you get Louis V, Coach, Diane Von Furstenberg, and other Asian designers in one area"
,,high end place,4.0,,"if you are looking to shop branded items this is the road. you can go to ION, Shaw center, takashiyama, paragon [all near by and can travel through underpass] etc malls and get all you want. this would save time but might stretch your budget.
for cheap items visit lucky plaza.
during evening with lights on the road looks wonderful. if you want u can watch movies at shaw and paragon."
,,Shopping outing,4.0,,Orchard Road is the perfect place to spend a day exploring the vast array of Shopping Malls. ION Orchard being one of them. Make sure you find the nearest underpass first to be able to cross the Road and a good idea is to look at the well signposted map of the Mall once you enter it so as to orientate yourself well.
,,Traveling with fussy family members,3.0,,"Many of my family members think that a visit to Singapore would not be complete without visiting Orchard road. Some even think a hotel would not be good if its far from Orchard road (despite an adequate transport system in Singapore).
What is so special about Orchard road anyway? In my opinion is nothing. Is just a barrage of luxury shopping centers that selling upmarket goods, which is not interesting for me.
My cousins and aunties thought that the items that they purchase in here have prestige value despite the fact that the very same item can be found in upper class shopping centers in Indonesia, with lower price.
The scene in the road itself is not enjoyable. Chaotic by my standard, where everyone rushed to go after their business."
,,U will find everything,5.0,,"I like this street it's very big and a lot of malls many brands and many resturante and coffe shops , one day it's not enough to be ther it's good , it's bitter to book the hotel in this street , u can find everything u want"
,,shopping street,3.0,,a shopping street and no different than any other city shopping street...we are from NY...not that impressed.
,,A good shopping street,3.0,,An interesting place to visit in Singapore but very expensive to shop around. You can see almost all the branded shops in this street.
,,Amazing,5.0,,the most shopping mall street. and famous street. it would good visit for everyone. The MRT connect to the mall very simply to reach
,,The heart of the Singapore,5.0,,"This is the most famous street in the Singapore, you can find the biggest shopping mall like: takashimaia, ion, paragon, tang,Istan, also so famous hotels: mandarin, Hilton , mariot , grand hyyat , st.regous, four seasons, regent and many restaurants"
,,Great Shopping Street,5.0,,Great for spending some time. Most are fashion shops. you can find all famous brands. Prices may vary...
,,Good walk around town,3.0,,"Good for a quick walk about to see, not affordable at all. Not the best place to go for a browsw with young children if you plan to do a lot of walking. Too expensive to actually buy things."
,,Shopping heaven !,5.0,,Shop shop shop!!!! Plenty of shopping mall over here in Orchard Road. Great place for dining & entertainments. Highly recommended for shopper! Branded everywhere!
,,Great shopping if thats your thing,3.0,,Orchard Road is basically the 5th Ave of SE Asia. Unless you are looking to shop don't waste your time. I say spend your time in the gardens or eating and shop when you get home.
,,good shopping,4.0,,"I enjoyed slowly walking around Orchard Road, lots of little lanes I felt quite safe walking down that came off the main road. Just a large shopping area really."
,,overhyped and overpriced,3.0,,this is a good place for window shopping and for buying if you are a maharaja.all the top most brands of the world are there to see...
,,It's a road,5.0,,"Yes. It's name of the road. Orchard.
Go do some digging and research about why it's called ORCHARD Road. Make the visit interesting. Otherwise, it's mostly a visit for you to go shopping and eating. Once of Singapore's most expensive shopping and eating belts.

While you're there, visit ION Orchard. Go up to the top floor and get to see the view of Orchard Road, from 55 stories up there in the air.

Very short road, but many opportunities for you to part with your money.
If you'll only visit Singapore once, then make it this time that you will be boosting our little economy. Buy a Prada."
,,Window shopping wishing... dreaming...,4.0,,"So so many shops, most of which are high end and expensive. Good for a stroll and a window shop but not enough money to spend!
I liked ION as there was a selection of more reasonably priced stores in the basement moving up to the designer stores on the higher levels."
,,Shopping district.,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopping mall - or rather a series of interconnected shopping malls, some above and some below grounds. To be honest I am not into shopping and I found it quite boring. It isn't a particularly cheap place to shop either. But I guess you could find almost anything there."
,,Fine,2.0,,Look good but most of the shops are brand names and nothing much to do or shop. Easy to find and filled with tourists.
,,"Busy, Busy, Busy",4.0,,Good shopping for pretty much anything you would want. Lots of entertaining things to see and great people watching.
,,Awesome,5.0,,Beautiful road that is clean and a doorway to many shops and restaurants! Awesome place to go to if you're looking for an amazing shopping experience. Shops range from luxury stores like Louis Vuitton to budget stores. Something for everyone!
,,Crowded on the streets...but endless shopping...high end,4.0,,"You name the designer and high end shop, and you'll find it on Orchard Road. There will be tons of people on the streets...and you'll always feel like you are swimming upstream. There are also many restaurants...from the street hawkers to the fine dining establishment along the mile stretch. Start at the ION Center / Tang Plaza and make you way towards the National Museum....lots to see, but bring your pocket book!"
,,"""Shopping Heaven""",5.0,,So many shops around that you will get your head turned. Shoppers can spend days here. Easy to go by from all of singapore
,,Good for a window shop stroll to see what's there,3.0,,There's no denying that Orchard Road has plenty of shops - it's what it is known for - but we found that most of the shops were on the higher-end price wise and it was more your expensive labels on this strip than boutique (mid-price range & non-label) or small quirky shops (which we like). We found Bugis Junction and VivoCity (the centre before you go across to Sentosa) to be more to our liking and where money was more spent than Orchard Rd BUT that should stop you having a look. It's especially good on a hot day (when is it not a hot day!) - air con does wonders!
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Very busy street but very beautifully decorated at Christmas. Lots of high end stores can be found here. Louis Vuitton has about 3 stores on this street alone! Lots to see, do, eat and enjoy here."
,,Shopper's haven,5.0,,"Long stretch of road with a lot of high-end shops and malls. It's a must-visit place for tourists! For budget dining, there is a nice food court in the lower ground of Takashimaya Mall. Tourists who want to buy a SIM card should check out the second floor of Lucky Plaza. All other places are a rip off!"
,,Duplicity Managed,5.0,,"One single area that would pragmatically satisfy cravings for shopping and food is Ngee Ann City & ION. A Mass Rapid Transit Station allows for convenient access to the centre of this region. With an adequate offering of brands and variety coupled with a plethora of eateries to suit varied taste buds. To visit more places along Orchard would be redundant as there is duplication, albeit in a more dilute form."
,,Shoppers Delight,4.0,,Orchard Road in singapore will provide every shoppers dream. The variety of shopping centres is incredible and so easy to access by using the basement levels to walk under streets avoiding the traffic and the weather.
,,Busy and full of shops,3.0,,Walked only a small section of the road near 100 orchard road this is not that full on but further towards the Singapore plaza i think it gets busy. Good place to find something for everyone.
,,Plenty of shopping and culture,5.0,,"Every shopping store you could need is on Orchard road, and plenty of events on the street side, all times of year. If you plan on shopping in Singapore, you must visit Orchard Road!"
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,Lots of variety. Lots of expensive places but if you look you'll find gems of small lower prices stores. Very crowded on Sunday's due to foreign workers day off.
,,Busy place. Mecca for Shoppers,3.0,,"I'm not a shopper. Seen one shopping mall seen them all. No other particular reason to be here, but thousands apparently feel otherwise."
,,Fantastic place for shopping,5.0,,Usually when I stay in Singapore I choose a hotel around Orchard road. Great place to walk around in the evenings and shopping ...especially nice to take a short wlak/stroll after dinner.
,,A long walk,4.0,,Stroll away enjoying walking around and sightseeing along the road at nite from Someset to Dhobby goat. Plenty of malls and resto.
,,"Clean, plenty of shops, cafes and a nice stroll through Singapore",4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the main roads in Singapore for shops, cafe's and just to go for a walk past all the expensive and cheap outlets! It is easy to get to by MRT or taxi from wherever you are in Singapore."
,,shopping,3.0,,glamour building and busy district of the country. but nothing different from other shopping center in North America.
,,Shopping galore,4.0,,If you want to shop this is the place. I stayed at the Hilton which is just at the end of the main shopping. It was very convenient and a very nice hotel.
,,Expen$ive,5.0,,"Aside from being a shopping district, I am so amazed with all the stores in this area whenever my neck craned."
,,Too Many To Choose From,4.0,,Long stretch of shopping. We just did not have enough time. Excellent place to shop and shop the whole day. Singapore Sales was on.
,,Rename it as Heavenly Road,5.0,,"Rating is not required at all. Very good, par excellence. Hats off to Singapore. Wish all the roads in India are similar to Orchard"
,,Best site for relaxing and shopping,5.0,,It's a great site for spending your day or evening and to do some great shopping. Orchard road has good range of shopping malls.
,,Shop (and eat) till you drop!,5.0,,"We stayed at a hotel just off Orchard Road, very handy, this place is wall to wall malls of excellent quality with all international brands and high end names too i.e. Gucci etc. A great way to stay cool of an afternoon and great deals to be had particularly electronics and tablets etc. There are some great hawker centres here too (moved off the streets in recent years into these malls so they could be regulated) and the food is fantastic, just choose your cuisine and go get it, authentic, great (and cheap!!). The underground transit is also on Orchard Road under several malls. It's a great street just to walk along too, lots of people just hanging out and enjoying themselves."
,,"Vibrant Walk , with access to all brand and food joints",5.0,,"We dint have shopping on our minds ,so just went there for a short while on our way back from Universal. Good vibrant walk , and unfortunately for me , my wife found TFS and ended up shopping :) . The place is bustling with regular and high end brands and has numerous good eateries also."
,,A shoppers delight,3.0,,"This street is amazing, so many choices for shopping (fashion, fashion, fashion!). If you do some research you will find much more ... art, electronics, cameras, homewares, coffee, tea, art classes, food, food, food and much, much more. So exciting. My wife LOVED it. I don't like crowds so I didn't like it so much. Avoid Sundays. It is crazy, so crowded, so busy, so bustling."
,,"So many shops, so little time!",4.0,,"Many shops, aircon in most if not all, some wonderful and colorful public gardens. Excellent public transport, comfortable and clean buses and taxis. Plenty of hotels to ""pop"" into for coffee too!"
,,'Heart' of Singapore shopping malls,5.0,,"Long stretch of shopping malls where one can find almost all types of retail brands. Many eateries, cafes and cinemas can also be found here! ✌😉"
,,Just a shopping street,3.0,,Orchard is the main shopping street and has all the shops you see in all big cities. I personally think it's a waste of time to go shopping in a city that has so much to see and do.
,,Orchard road review,4.0,,"Shoppers friendly. Just start from Hyatt hotel and all the way down to dhoby ghaut by foot though you can board the train which stop at every other mall. Anyway, you won't be confuse, it's very organized. Some malls are inter connected underground so don't worry about rain.

But most malls are repetitive. So you won't miss anything if you skip.

Sales are often. Best in June-July. Try to stay along this shopping belt. Food are plenty from budget to expensive.

Enjoy your holidays!"
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,Wow... If you love shopping you will love Orchard Rd... There are many high end shops.. Malls everywhere and at night the lights are amazing...
,,A great concentration of shopping mall,3.0,,Great for shopping sprees but the modern shopping centres do not really offer anything more than at any other large state of the art shopping mall in the world. There are many more interesting activities if your time in Singapore is limited. The food courts are always fantastic (especially the food court at Takashimaya) as is the food everywhere in Singapore.
,,Busting!,4.0,,"Just an amazing bustling area and mix of cultures, shops, hotels and restaurants offering so much atmosphere and excitement."

,,Getting old and tired,4.0,,The staff in some of the designer shops are arrogant and have feel of snobbishness.

Orchard Road is always bustling with locals and visitors alike. It's also good to stop in at the bar at the Marriott and have a cold beer after all that walking."
,,Very busy,3.0,,"Orchard Road is very busy and many, many high end shops. I did find Lucky Plaza 304 Orchard Road which is where more locals shopped. I found an excellent massage place Le Stage which I wish I had found at the beginning of my stay."

,,Touristy Shopping Area,4.0,,"Orchard road is basically the place to go to if you are looking to do some shopping. You might want to drop either at the Orchard MRT station or alternatively Somerset Station which brings you to a stretch of various malls.

I would recommend tourists to pick a hotel around this area if you are keen on accessibility and various options on food and shopping. You might want to check out Grand Park Orchard hotel which is located at a wonderful location.

You will be able to find various departmental stores like Tangs & Robinsons here along with bigger brands like ZARA, Coach and etc.

If you are keen in branded shopping, i do suggest heading to Orchard Ion Mall (directly connected to Orchard MRT station). It has lots of branded stores like Coach, Louis Vuitton, etc.

Food choices around the area is pretty large too!

You might want to avoid shopping on weekends if you are a tourist here. Lesser crowds during weekdays for sure!"

,,星加坡地標,3.0,,十多年前的烏節路非常繁榮，人來人往。現在全是名牌店。多是觀光客。若不喜歡名牌店就沒有怎麽可做。不過在烏節路尾有Ion Orchard 也有警喜.....每天下午3時至6時 Ion Sky 在55至56層是免費開放。在此可飽覧星加坡全市。非常直得觀看。Ion Sky on level 55 and 56 of Ion Orchard at the end of Orchard road is open for free to the public everyday from 3 to 6pm. It is well worth for your effort to get there. I did not pay $23 to go up to sky observation deck of Marina Bay hotel. This is definitely a good alternative to that. Never been to an observation deck of such high altitude for FREE .
,,shopping good,4.0,,Similar to other cities with the more upmarket shops here. It is great to catch the train to Orchard MRT station and walk down the street
,,Shopping,4.0,,Fifth ave of Singapore. Enjoyed the offbeat stores off of the main strip. Bring a bottle of water as it is hot and humid to walk the strip.
,,Rodeo Drive Singapore,4.0,,"Visitors from the USA will think that Rodeo Drive moved west! All of the designers have at least one store and many have multiple along this shopping paradise.

,,Noting much here other than branded goods,2.0,,"Not recommend to for the first time visitor, the whole road have many shopping malls then almost sell the same stuff, having same brands here, I'd suggest to other places to see the unique Singapore"
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore's shoppers paradise. There's 3 MRT stations along this busy road, namely (1) Orchard; (2) Somerset; and (3) Dhoby Ghaut. Thus it's wiser to check exact where one's heading.

,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"So many shops, so much to see and buy. Definitely get whatever you ate looking for on Orchard Road. Will definitely be visiting here again"
,,Shopping Madness,4.0,,"It is a thing to see but I wouldn't go there again unless I really need it. It is a shopping mall street, huge malls with all kind of brands for sell. The metros stop inside of the mall and when you get off it you don't understand where you are. The malls are really huge and if you aren't into shopping it can get quite a nuisance to get out of it. I've visited the street on Friday evening so it was madness there.. What I really like though, I walked to Emerald Hill road for some cozy little terraced houses to view, where old meets new. So if you want to escape the buzz, just wander there a bit. In the evenings the bars upon up there and you can have a drink there and even listen to live music."
,,Lots of lights and expensive shops,2.0,,Lots of lights and expensive shops. It is not much of an attraction. The street itself is over 2 km long. The street is not the place that it was reputed to be in colonial times.
,,Nice boulevard,4.0,,"A great looking stretch of road, wide walkways and great shopping... one of Singapore's best attractions"
,,Literally shop 'til you drop,4.0,,"If you're up for some shopping this is the place to go. If you want to get in and get out this is certainly not the place to go. Every mall had mostly the same stuff. The street itself was beautifully lined with trees and shrubs though for a pleasant experience. Be warned, most shops open at 11ish."
,,"Busy spot, but a great Shopping place",4.0,,"Busy spot, but a great Shopping place and hang out place, lots of designer work and lots of a fun place, even if you just chill outside there is a lot of restaurant, cafe, and street food,! the Singapore ice cream bread is a must to try, and, its a great spot to cruise around the town with your board,,, (I'm longbording around the street!)
its clean and the road is smooth! and its very clean place too"
,,Bustling,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a ""Must"" when visiting Singapore, however be prepared for the hustle and bustle especially if you go on a Sunday which should be avoided at all cost. Its your typical city shopping experience- designer shops etc etc, nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion"
,,My visit,3.0,,Orchard road you can buy anything from the cheapest bargain to sinature brands there are also few open wifi acess with in the area that u can use. If you are thingking of eating plenty of choices western and local delicacy suggest not.to go weekends to crowded. Basically 1 stop place for everything
,,Great Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Just great shopping street, you'll find almost everything, very nice also at night. Be aware of the crowd on a Saturday and especially Sunday, its crazy."
,,"Clean, modern, full of trees!",5.0,,"It was a plesure to visit this boulevard full of luxury malls and brandshops. Especially in the night there is like a show with all the commercials, all the ads and a lot of fancy cars.
Orchard Road is a very central boulevard, one of the main ones, and although is in the middle of the city it is filled with vegetation."
,,Great shoppimg for designer brands and also mainstream brands,5.0,,Gucci and Zara on the same strip... in walking distance. Easy to get taxis and so mamy shops its overwhelimg!
,,A Singapore Bucket List Item,4.0,,"This is a street which you really should visit if you visit Singapore. It has become one of the Singaporean landmarks/icons, and should be somewhere you visit. Of course, it might not be the best place for children because, like all of Singapore, it is very hot. In this case it is also extremely loud and busy. Of course, the malls will be wonderfully cold, so that might solve your problem. While on Orchard the best place to go to really get the feel of things could arguably be Ion, so I would recommend at least walking past."
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,"We enjoyed just strolling along Orchard Road taking in the sights.
There are so many shopping centres to choose from. All the high end shops are at street level or higher. Take the elevators in the departments stores down below ground level and there are many levels off shops and food halls. A great road to wander along."
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,"There are so many shopping centres, like Mankind G Rd in Shanghai but much more expensive. Europeans will find all the recognisable outlets but with summer/ hot weather version S of clothing. If your here to shop or like shopping centres you'll love it, if you don't care to shop, save yourself the long walk from centre to centre."
,,Busy,4.0,,Orchard road is the busiest shopping street in Singapore. There are lots of shopping malls dotted along it from the expensive to the cheap. Watch the traffic with the roads and be careful going down the underpasses especially the one between ion and wheelock place as you enter a whole new level of shopping malls and it gets a bit disorientating.
,,The shopers paradise,5.0,,"Be prepared for a hectic walking day, you need to pace yourself. Be sure to visit 'Tangs', must the largest department store in Singapore. Wonderfull shopping."
,,Shopping Again and Again,4.0,,"The famous shopping street in Singapore .. Actually I am a people that not really like for shopping .. The one and only shop that I search is Giordano .. And my priority is the most famous ""uncle ice cream"" and Laduree in Takashimaya .."
,,Malls galore,3.0,,"Fine if you like expensive shopping with mall after mall, prices are not cheap though. For photo stuff buy at home or go to ChinaTown"
,,shopping paradise,5.0,,one of the busiest street in Singapore. it's the shopping paradise in Singapore. you can find all the low. mid. to high end brands. definitely a one stop shopping.
,,Too crowded on weekend or holiday season,3.0,,"The best time to enjoy Orchard Road is during weekdays and on non-holiday season, shops are not full. A lot of shops and malls. Best mall is Takashimaya and Ion Orchard."
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"Unless you are very very wealthy, there is nothing of interest along this road except some very very expensive shops. Total waste of time."
,,Beautiful Shopping Area,5.0,,This whole area is beautiful and there are countless wonderful stores and shops to explore. The Christmas decorations were beautiful.
,,Good place for tourist,5.0,,It like the many shopping district other countries have. Being here allows you to get almost anything.
,,A magnifier of commercialism,3.0,,"There is no doubt that you need to visit just to determine whether all the hype is justified, and believe me it is.
This is a very long busy road with literally hundreds of shops ranged on either side and is a shopping heaven for those who wish for the ostentatious and feel the need for designer bags and accessories. On the other side of this comment is the fact that should you want something, there will always be the outlet, as long as you can find it.
For me, the delight of this shopping area is the wonderful experience of people watching with their fashionable apparel alongside those of clearly a poorer poplace, however both sets of people seem to exist in a frenetic world that has little or no time for a more relaxed and enjoyable lifestyle.
Do visit, but be aware that money will only go so far and that material goods are not the solution to peace of mind, just ask the locals."
,,"Walk , Shop and Eat",4.0,,"Actually you can see it is like Paris, New York.. but they offer ice cream with Bread and the most important is Safe - no pick pocket like Paris, Barcelona ..."
,,Shopping nirvana,4.0,,I am not a shopper but can appreciate why shoppers would love this area. Mall after high end mall and tons of people. Interesting sort of like going to Harrods in London.
,,Retail,3.0,,"This is down as one of the places to visit while in Singapore, however I was quite disappointed.
It is mainly different undercover shopping malls repeating the same shops, coming from the UK many are the same as we're used to seeing on the high street at home.
The food malls are interesting places to eat if you fancy eating with the locals.
If it's very hot it's a good place to head if you want to stay cool, if it's the rainy season not a bad place to go if you need to stay dry.
There are nicer malls to visit, go but don't waste too much of your valuable sightseeing here."
,,SHOPPING PARADISE,5.0,,"Anything you wish is here Orchard Road offer a huge variety of shoping mall for any kind of buyer, jung, reach and average"
,,Designer shoppers paradise,4.0,,"I walked the full length each side of this famous shopping strip and enjoyed the sights but did not buy much as the prices were similar to Australia. There is every designer store imaginable. Still it's a great place for cafes and restaurants and that great activity of people watching. A night time walk is best as it is cooler and spectacular with all the lights in this modern, exciting and thriving city."
,,orchard street,5.0,,"shopping malls everywhere! and a lot of varieties to choose from, i love orchard ion! great views to catch"
,,Prepare to spend,3.0,,Another high end shopping area. Prices are not cheap. Save your money for sight seeing. Unless you are after something unique.
,,Confusing.,3.0,,"Orchard Road has this amazing vibe, shops as far as the eye can see, but which direction do you go.? High end shops are everywhere, with very high end prices, even at sale time and the lack of signage is very confusing. For anyone seeking a middle of the range store or shop, we searched in vane as they were either high end or junk.
The only store we enjoyed was Takashimaya with good variety and sale prices quite good. To get from one side if the street to another you must take the underground system so plan your shops beforehand to save unnecessary walking. Maybe a two day visit as Orchard Road is very long and crowded."
,,Just another place to shop,3.0,,"A shopping hub in Singapore, wherein one may pretty much every stuff. If you live nearby or have to visit someplace there to buy something, then go for it. Else, you may as well get the stuff somewhere else."
,,Busy,4.0,,What a busy road. So many shopping malls and so much to see. You won't have any problem finding something to buy. There is so much choice. Great city and great views to be had from rooftop restaurants.
,,So much to see and do,5.0,,"We visited Orchard road many times on our short trip to Singapore. It has a great mix of food, shopping and transport. So is easily accessible and with great spots to eat you can rest and refresh between the shopping."
,,A party every night,5.0,,"We stayed in a hotel on Orchard Road and went out for dinner every night in a different direction. On Friday and Saturday nights, street musicians add to the excitement, and a steady flow of mostly young people from numerous cultures were stolling through the seemingly-endless flow of shopping centers, restauants, coffee shops, up-scale watch shops that seemed empty most of the time (the younger generation seems to find their cell phones to be perfectly adequate for telling time). All the major international shops can be found along the road, including a large VIctoria's Secret shop for those so inclinded. The dining options were endless, with offerings from all national cuisines and most chains from the US, UK, Japan, and elsewhere. We had a wonderful time just meandering up and down the street, enjoying the energy of the crowds and the diversity of sights. Plenty of shopping opportunities for almost anything your heart desires. Not much in the way of a bar scene, which presumably can be found down some of the side streets."
,,Great shopping but vast/very busy,4.0,,"If you are true shopaholic, like designer clothes and don't mind a bit of walking this is for you. I enjoyed my day here but a pain finding a cab back to my hotel"
,,A must visit!,5.0,,"If you come to Singapore, especially for the first time, this place is a must visit! This road is the famous outdoor shopping street. You can almost find anything you expect to be there!"
,,great shopping strip but don't expect cheap goods.,5.0,,"There are many international shops in the district but the prices were no cheaper than we could buy similar ítems in Australia.

One really interesting thing inSingapore, including Orchard Road, is that you can find some very cheap bargains for dining. We did not pay more tan $20 for two people for any meal from the food courts as an instance."
,,Shop til you Drop,5.0,,"A walk along Orchard road is a must, particularly if you've come to Singapore to shop. All the high end stores are there Visaci, Ralph Loren etc. You will need your wallet though, or load up your credit card, things are quite expensive. Its a long road and I suggest you start early in the day, before it gets too humid, or like me you'll end up a pool of perspiration. there are plenty of places to get a feed too."
,,a happening place,5.0,,"you can hold meetings there, or shop like a tai tai, enjoy the great variety of cuisine offerings, have dim sum, peking duck, caviar and champagne, climb up to the highest point of the road on one of the skyscrapers, have a picture taken with the models at abercrombie, meet an old friend at a halal cafe while waiting for your macbook air to be fixed at one of the biggest apple stores in the world, or just hop on and off one of many tourist buses plying the road if you wish to take in the sights of the city or catch a nap white traveling... you can be a local or tourist and enjoy a whole day in this vibrant avenue of many possibilities..."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"This road is the busy heart of Singapore with what appears to be an endless array of multi floor shopping plazas comprising of 'top end brand' to 'bargain basement' stores and abundant restaurants varying in quality and price. Be wary of the few stores that don't display the price of items. For example I bought a watch which the store keeper stated was $190, he said he would do a deal at $150, after further bargaining sold it to me for $100 afterwards I think I still got ripped off."
,,Great shopping experience,5.0,,"Too good place for shopping. All you need is time & money. Shop till you drop. ION, Takeshimaya, Shaws, paradise plaza blew my mind."
,,"A huge array of departmental stores, lovely cafes, nice hotels, and basically a lovely place to stroll.",5.0,,"My favourite road to walk , lined with shops , cafes, malls and local eating places. A must for any traveller, first time or otherwise. My favourite is Takashimaya, CK Tangs, H&M stores, Robinsons, etc... Try to do this area every visit."
,,best street,5.0,,"best place to shop with lots of cafes ,restaurants around,and high end brands.a place for shopaholics."
,,"If you love to shop, here's the place!",5.0,,"Orchard, Road is a shoppers paradise offering every boutique name under the sun in some of the most glamorous shopping centers I've visited.
Ion Orchard is a must, but bring you wallets & purses with you, The House of Tangs is a firm favourite of ours, Takashimaya is just across the road for all Japanese goodies plus there's Lucky Plaza which has seen better days but still great fun.
The food options are endless and transport is no problem.
It'd be hard not to spend a few hours here and no buy something!"
,,"Love shopping, lights and vibrancy- Head to orchard road",5.0,,"If you love shopping for all budgets and love food and vibrant full of life atmosphere, you should definitely visit the orchard road. All the prominent malls are situated at this place and you can find all the luxurious brands situated here. Shop your heart out and loosen your purse strings"

,,Shops Galore!,5.0,,"Orchard Road caters for every type of shopper. There are plenty of indoor malls if you want to get out of the heat for a while. I didn't go there to shop, I was on a mission to get an ice-cream from Haagen-Dazs :)"
,,"A blend of London's Oxford street, Regent Street and Picadilly set in a tree line boulevard",4.0,,"We stayed with friends in an apartment just off Orchard. There are several upmarket shopping malls selling the upmarket brands. It's expensive with most of the window displays showing no prices on watches and jewellery etc. Upmarket restaurants are common in them as well as the competitively priced food courts. It's possible to eat great food from $10 to 100 a person.

The roads are tree lined which us great since the Singapore heat can be intense. On Sunday the street and underground railway were packed with young women. Apparently Sunday is when all the domestic maids have their day off to meet their friends and go shopping in the Lucky Plaza mall on Orchard."
,,Definitely worth taking a walk,3.0,,"We walked to Orchard road from The Fullerton where we were staying and then walked the entire length of Orchard road in both directions and back again to the Fullerton. What a fabulous walk! The shops on Orchard road are not cheap but its an experience just going into some of the malls and travelling both up and down in the lift or escalator to see what's there. We found some amazing stores and felt quite underdressed in some of the more chic ones!!! We even found a golf driving range in one building on floor 8 or 9!!! Explore, you won't regret it!!"
,,one stop shop for designer brands,5.0,,"Everything you want and everything you don,t want can be found on orchid road. So clean and well laid out. Designer shops every where but carrying designer prices as well so not cheap but if you can,t find something of intrest to you here you probably can,t find it in singapore it has literally everything. At night it looks amazing with all the different lights everywhere and just so easy to get around. Goes for miles and it has every designer shop you could possibly think off but take your credit card or loads of cash . You will need it. If you want to claim the vat back off purchased items you buy take your passport with you as the shops require that to issue you with the document you will need to get refund at airport. Anything you want to claim on must also be in your carry on luggage as they will ask to see it when you go to claim the vat back at the airport.
Amazing place."
,,Night life at SG,4.0,,"Great show of brands for shopping,famous for adult night pubs , frequent road shows,fashion destination."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"If you want to do some high end shopping, you need to head here. Orchard road has all the big brands available. Places like Lucky Plaza would also have budgeted shopping, specially if you want to buy chocolates or gifts."
,,Crazy shopping,4.0,,"The is a crazy place to go shopping especially on a Sunday. So many people and so noisy. Great atmosphere but only for a short time. A mixture of expensive, glamorous shops and lots of sales. Couldn't wait to get out of the busyness to a quieter area of Singapore. Great if you enjoy shopping."

,,Continues to amaze.,4.0,,"Singapore is now a very expensive destination, so don't expect many bargains in the shops on Orchard Road. Go for a walk, be delighted by the ever amazing architecture. Enjoy the enveloping tropical warmth. Sit at an outdoor cafe and watch the world walk by. Still a street not to be missed."
,,Shopping frenzy,5.0,,"If you love shopping this is Singapore equivalent to Rodeo Drive or 5th Ave. they have all the designers you know and some you may not, but they are in all the malls. It's so clean you would never know you were outside, flowers everywhere. Make sure to take plenty of money, they will, help you spend it!"
,,Too crowded,2.0,,Made mistake of venturing into Orchard Road to run errands on Mother's Day. Who knew? Everything was crowded. Went into a Sephora and faced a huge scrum in the aisles and a Disney queue 50 people deep. Who wants makeup that badly? Not me! Walked out. Into hordes of people on the sidewalks and streets. Ugh. All the stores are all the same - how do any of them make any money?

,,"Dull, uninspring and overcrowded.",2.0,,"Came to Orchard Road because so many others go and rave about it. Didn't see a single thing that would make this a must-see.
Perhaps if you're a rabid consumer then maybe the shops attract you? That must be it, bc there's nothing else to see here."
,,Brand Heaven,5.0,,Every brand you can think of has a store here... pristine ... beautiful and safe place to shop - one store after another...with great personnel ready willing and able to help you.
,,"""shoppers' haven""",4.0,,"the place to go when you want to shop the easy way. everything is within a walking distance, but you have to remember where you came from because you will be confused by the number of shops around. all shops are interconnected via underground. and if you want to go far just access the MRT then presto you are in another place. food court is all over the place to taste the Singapore's, best food.
although the prices are not that cheap, they are of good quality.
if ever you get lost , there are lots of sign to follow, and if you still getting lost, there are information areas to ask the courteous staff, though you have to understand their english."
,,great shopping,5.0,,"great shopping, airconditioned malls and underpasses, spoilt for food choices, great way to just wander around and spend the day"
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping.",4.0,,"Unfortunately is not the bargain shoppers paradise it once was. Today The Lucky Plaza and similar places exit however they have been overtaken by the high end designer shops. Prada, Gucci, Coach, Tiffanys, Mchael Kors and the list goes on and on. There is a sprinkling of department stores like Tangs, Robinsons, H&M etc. For those who enjoy browsing or shopping there are hours of delight ahead of you on Orchad Road."
,,A lively place,5.0,,"We can go for shopping on this road ,both side mall are available but it looks costly as compared to India"
,,Overrated,2.0,,"Overrated on my opinion. Yeah, you can see a lot expensive brands etc. but frankly I don't understand the fuss. Marina Bay is more interesting in my opinion."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Full of shopping malls, cafes, restaurants and hotels. There's an underground that connects orchard road to opposite street. MRT stations available as well that stops inside mall buildings. Weekend night visit is little crowd."
,,Metropolis of shops!,4.0,,"What a buzz about the place, and some fantastic shops. Some top end, some, like Tangs just opens into a new world. Really are some amazing department stores here"
,,Orchard Road is fantastic but possibly a little overwhelming!,5.0,,"We are a family of 5 with 3 kids aged 14, 11, and 9. We recently stayed at Darby Park Executive Suites in Orange Grove Road close to Orchard Road. It was an easy walk to Orchard Road which has the most amazing shopping centres. We found some lovely food courts for meals and did some shopping. It is very easy to get lost in the myriad of tunnels that are underground but it is a real shopping experience."
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"So many shopping malls, so much to see and shop for!! We did some homework before we arrived to know where the locations of shops we wanted to see but when we got there all that went out the window and we went wild.. The streets are so clean and beautiful with the gardens and building architecture, once inside the malls it is another level of amazingness... We were lucky enough to be there for the start of their GSS - Great Singapore Sale. Very happy with the bargains we found!!"
,,Exciting way to shop,5.0,,"Amazing shopping experience, shops underground, on the ground and up in the air....posh shops, cheap shops, constant buzz of activity, leave your Visa card at home if you want to stay rich...."
,,Prime shopping destination,4.0,,"A must visit for shoppers, eaters and just for anybody who likes to do window shopping and explore exotic foods."
,,shopping paradise,5.0,,this is exactly the perfect place for the shoppers...i really dont know which mall i will go first...every corner theres a different mall...have to have money though...
,,shopping delight,4.0,,this place is great for the pure variety of types of shopping possible from the huge department stores to the small stalls. very easy to duck in to air con when the heat gets to you and a vast array of food options.
,,Orchard Road has many good mid to low end buys but one must know where to find it......,4.0,,"Orchard Road is generally perceived as a very expensive & high end brands haven for those with very deep pockets. Yes, there are many mind boggling high ends brands here but there are also many affordable ones too, if you know where to find it.

Malls that sells mostly expensive ""high end"" brands include Ion Orchard, Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Mandarin Gallery, Wisma Atria.

For ""mid range"" price products, go to malls like OG Department Store, Plaza Singapura, Tang Plaza, Shaw House/Centre, Robinsons at Heeren, Centrepoint (this mall under renovation but still open).

For ""cheap/lower end"" products, go to Lucky Plaza & Far East Plaza ( 2 mins walk from Tangs Plaza).

Another category of mid range products are standalone big international retailers like H&M, Uniqlo, Isetan, Marks & Spencer, & Metro (local)- some of these have few outlets in the various Orchard malls.

There are regular year round sales promotions in these mid range stores, which one can really grab genuine excellent buys."
,,High income shoppers mainly,3.0,,"Orchard road has shops such as Tiffanies ,Gucci and Amani. Very expensive but good to wander through and get scared by the price tags. The underground crossings for the road are the best places to eat with a wide variety of food stalls. They are very cheap, big meal for $5. A must see but we didn't buy anything there except food."
,,shopping paradise,5.0,,"we took mrt from levender station to orchid road,at orchid we came through ion mall station so huge mall with free wifi and lot food joints with lot of international brands showrooms...and on orchid road there are many malls and offices u will get tired vewing all of them"
,,Nice place,5.0,,A very nice place to hang around with lots of eating options. I tried Coffee Café Day and Four Finger restaurants and they are awesome.
,,Retail therapy paradise,4.0,,"Name a particular designer and you are likely to find at least one outlet specializing or stocking their clothing. Heading onto the shoppers street, from the Ion Orchard MRT station, we had one destination in mind as a first port of call - the Paul Smith shop (one of two). June - July is a good time to go because the Singapore sales are in full swing. And we were not disappointed. Whether its a designer outfit or a reasonably priced pair of shoes/jeans/underwear whatever, you are likely to find it somewhere on Orchard Roads in one of the rather overwhelming, multistory outlets both sides of the street. There's a range of food outlets as well."
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"Here you´ll find all kind of shops. The street are clean and tidy. Malls in every corner. Regular brands, exclusive brands or cheap brands - you´ll find it here!"
,,Centric shopping paradise for visitors,5.0,,Great for a walk with infinite options for food and shopping even in rainy days. It becomes a great party location on weekend evenings.
,,"All about the look of it, money driven, superficial",1.0,,"Consumerism gone mad. Expensive, crowded, many of the shops underground beneath Orchard Rd itself, so you have a separate sort of underground city to navigate. You can't just cross Orchard Rd, you have to under it via subway, or above it via overpass. But the best idea is, unless shopping for overpriced goods with the masses in a sterile environment truly lights your flame, go somewhere else. (Although the above review pretty much sums up Singapore for me, so finding a different somewhere else could be a challenge)."
,,fancy shops,4.0,,"You can walk and sit on benches enjoy your drink or ice cream, chic shoppers are in and out of brand malls which is entertaing"
,,Overwhelming,5.0,,This is a designer shopping addict's nirvana!! There are at least 2 outlets per design house on this same road. My favourite mall is Paragon....a bit of a balance in the name brands in the mall.
,,Great!!!Shopping!!!,5.0,,"Its a belt of about 3 to 4 km with Shops from Prada to Lucky Plaza,basically a balance .A must place for a shopaholic."
,,"Shopping, shipping, eat",4.0,,"Orchard road is a great area to spend a day or two. There is a lot of shopping, I had never seen shopping like this. A lot of high-end shops, actually there are multiples of the high-end shops. Inside the malls you will find more local shops and a lot of places to eat. From high-end to casual. The food courts are a great value and the food is very good. If you want fancy go to ION."
,,ORCHARD ROAD,4.0,,"This road is a shopping Paradise. Shop till you drop I ltrerally mean it!!!!. Designer goods, Cameras, Electronic Goods, you name it and its is there. However this is a slightly expensive place to shop. You may find better deals at shops on Serangoon Road (Little India). Glamorous place no doubt. Happy Shopping"
,,shopping for shoppers,5.0,,"This is for serious shoppers, its expensive but there is definatly what ever your heart desires and it comes along with a nice lable and a huge bill. Window shop but fight the urge to go in as it will definiately cost you."
,,A shoppers delight!,4.0,,Lots of shops to visit both exclusive and department stores. Catered for all budgets. A shoppers paradise!
,,Great for shoppingoholics,5.0,,"On 2,2 km there are around 22 malls. Designer stores. You can be here for days. We spend most time in Orchard ION. Metro station is inside the mall."
,,"Chanel, Dior, Ferragamo and much more.",5.0,,"One whole stretch of shopping malls, cafes, restaurants and hotels. There's an underground that connects orchard road to opposite street. MRT stations available as well that stops inside mall buildings. Indoor parking can be a little bit expensive."
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,A heaven for shopping the ladies really enjoyed shopping here got some great deals the ion Orchatd is irrestable
,,22 malls,5.0,,"This place has 22 malls. We covered 5-6 before we got exhausted. There was Great Singapore Sale going on so there were lots of discounts. Of course, everything was expensive and way above our budget. Most of the malls are high end. Worth a visit."
,,Mr,3.0,,A typical shopping area lots of variety. Don't expect the prices to be cheap unless there's a sale on ( we got them last year so was good value then ). If you're a keen shopper wear flat shoes as its a reasonably long road and you will need 2 days
,,Shopping heaven but expensive!,4.0,,"Orchard road and Scotts road is full of malls and full of choices for true shopping lovers. Easily accessible by MRT, this place is worth spending a day. Good food choices also are available in plenty in the malls and outside for food lovers."
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,Orchard! Come in June-July for Singapore Great Sale and you can have Orchard by yourselves. Expecting for mall to mall experience and keep shopping till you drop. Medium to high end stuffs so prepare some money. Nice eateries as well. Transport? MRT will take from here to everywhere in Singapore.
,,Good place to shop for shopaholics,4.0,,Orchard Road offers a wide array of shops to choose from - it really is heaven for shopaholics. Most of the shops are branded and pricey but there are some budget-friendly shops if you know where to look. Takashimaya is a good department store if you don't find yourself walking the whole stretch of Orchard Road which can be very tiring if you're not the shopaholic type.
,,Plenty of excitement for the shop-aholics,4.0,,A super long street filled with designer brand stores with multi-level buildings too. You will definitely fatigue if you try to explore the whole street. For the shop-aholics the challenge to complete it is there. Nonetheless a great street to visit with plenty of icecream sandwiches located on the street too.
,,City's main shopping street,5.0,,Orchard Rd is the prime shopping district in this über expensive city...plenty of ultra modern veritical malls and shoppes dot every part of the area. Trendy bars and upscale restaurants are in abundance...bring your platinum card.
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,All the stores imaginable are there. You'll never ran out of stores to go to or places to eat. It is definitely a shopping hub.
,,"Beautiful line of road, but too crowded",3.0,,"For more than 5 years Orchard Rd is never in my destination list every time I visit Singapore, unless I have to buy something there or meet people. The pedestrians along botj sides of the road are beautiful, wide and lined with big trees. For me it's not comfortable anymore to walk there because of growing number flock of people visit it. Haven for luxurious shopper, but not really worth a visit if you're not one of them--unless maybe you come from Indonesia (we don't have any huge beautiful pedestrian path)."
,,Unbelievable number of malls,4.0,,"You think that because each mall is on the road that they must be small, but actually each has 4 or 5 floors so each one is quite big. You could easily spend a full day shopping here."
,,Love the shopping here but it can be expensive,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a long boulevard of shopping shopping and more shopping. It is the retail and entertainment hub of Singapore. It is a huge tourist attraction but can be expensive. For my souvenirs, I shopped in little china and little india."
,,shopping heaven,5.0,,"Wide pavements make this busy road pleasurable in intense heat and humidity. All the big shops are here and also plenty of places to stop and have a drink. Worth a look, although prices are higher than Europe."
,,Everything you need,5.0,,"For shopping fanatics and foodies, this street has it all. There are back to back malls and shops running through the entire street, almost to the point of overwhelming visitors. As a resident on Orchard street, the only downfall I can see is that I end up spending too much money because of temptations. If you're not big on shopping or spending money, the perfect time to come for a walk down Orchard is right before the sun sets, when thousands of birds camp out in the trees to make a unique chorus like you've never heard. Then when the sun sets the night view and lighting of the street will show you another side of Singapores glory"
,,Shopping,5.0,,Enjoyed roming around the shops felt very safe. Prices of things much the same as in Australia. Lucky Plaza was great and if you are in the market for jewellery TAKA jewellery store was helpful and good prices located in Lucky Plaza
,,Bling and more Bling,5.0,,Shoppers paradise with every designer label on show. Subway stops allow you to avoid the marathon 5K length of this world renowned shopping street.
,,Another must see are of Singapore,5.0,,If you like shopping this place is for you. I don't personally like shopping if there is a place where I could see me picking up the habit. This is probably it. At night it really comes alive with all the lights on the shops gleaming off the spotlessly clean road and pavement.
,,Prepare to spend some cash here,3.0,,"The glitzy shopping district of Singapore, we came here on a rainy Sunday and the whole place was packed full of shoppers. The best of the best brand names have shops here along with some of the well known eateries. If you love shopping and don’t mind spending a bit of coin this is the place for you"
,,Shoppers Heaven!,4.0,,"This has to be shoppers heaven ! A labyrinth of inter connecting shopping malls many of several stories above ground and in some cases just as many again below ground linked with under passes and over passes. The scale of the whole thing is quite breath taking, there are outlets from all the top designer labels, and chain stores. If you can't get what you want here, it is probably no longer available! There are also a huge rage of places to eat covering all tastes and all prices.
You will get lost! My advise if you see something you like buy it then and there - because the chances of finding the same shop twice are very slim!! Most of the shops are open till 11 pm at which time they start locking doors so getting out of the malls can be something of a challenge - once the underpasses are closed actually getting across Orchard Road its self is almost impossible, they don't have many pedestrian crossings because they slow down the traffic flow too much, but maybe a couple of bridges which do not close would prevent some of the lengthy detours which exist at the moment!"
,,Mecca of shopping,5.0,,"That road is a succession of luxury malls , that underground starting from MRT .
You can stay all day with out seeing the daylight if you wish .
but really go up to the main road is really better nice art on the street and architecture to see very wide walk pass and comfortable to walk .
shopping variety is endless .
Part of Singapore a must try !"
,,Food and Shopping.,4.0,,"Enjoyed our day shopping, the malls were great. We also ate at various resturants in the area. The streets are are very clean, with no litter."
,,Another site Singpaore visit,5.0,,Orchard is the main shopping area a bit like London Oxford street/Bobd street. It's a great place to visit and just take in the scale of the shopping malls.
,,The glory days is over,1.0,,"This place no longer the posh shopping belt after the place is filled with people sitting everywhere along staircase, walkway, pedestrian, shopping cebter floors..etc For the local, this place can be avoided will be best."
,,If you love to shop then this is the street for you!,5.0,,"So many malls all close together! lots of stores, a lot of high end and few lower end stores, something for everyone! Every mall is massive and so fancy, great to just walk around."
,,Singapore shopping,5.0,,"In Singapore there are many places to shop but Orchard Road, China Town and Raffles City top the list in that order. So check out Orchard Road first. Then if you are still keen to shop just hop on the MRT and check out the other 2."
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"Coming from South Africa, you find comfort in the big shopping malls you see on Orchard road. This road is 2.2kms long, 22 shopping malls and over 5000 brands. Complete shopping madness! In Singaporean style, everything is clean and of high quality. Along the road there are public vending machines, apparently the government is encouraging citizens to stay hydrated during the summer season. You will notice a strange sound when traffic lights go green, this apparently has been done to accommodate the blind so they know when to cross the road safely. This city is modern, and everything has been thought of and planned for. You will enjoy Orchard road and the endless shopping. Set a target for the number of malls you want to see, and see if you can achieve your target, it could be fun."
,,Super expensive area,3.0,,"We stayed at the Hilton on Orchard Road, which was lovely, but there wasn't anything walkable unless you're there to shop really high end. We have all of the same stores in the US (Cartier, Rolex, etc), so we are more into the local markets.

I did notice prostitutes after midnight, but they were not aggressive."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Retail for all, not cheap when compared to Australia, however it is about choice, range and just the sheer size of this shopping bonanza."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Yes this is ""MALL Alley"" most of them was like Dr Who's Tardis - you go in off the road, and after a few yards the whole world opens up into a complex lair of different levels serviced by escalators. You will need at least four days if you want to visit them all."
,,Busy place full of tourist tat,4.0,,"A very busy place, still buzzing late at night. Great atmosphere but an awful lot of tourist stuff for sale. Keep your hand on your wallet."
,,great feeling while walking,5.0,,"to walk on orchard street is an experience in itself.it has high end malls, local shops as well as medium range malls and lot of activity going on. you get good options of food, yogurt , drinks and what not. it is very beautifully made...More"

,,Old haunts,5.0,,We used to live off Orchard Road and I love going back to visit. It is a huge street full of massive Shopping malls and hotels. Most malls have a supermarket in the basement area and also car parks which can be a little expensive....More
,,Not Orchard bu Shopping Malls Road.,4.0,,Malls and malls and shop till you drop. But remember all upscale shopping malls. Big international brands all over these malls. These include Forum; Paragon;Centrpoint and Lucky Plaza to name a few. Tip: keep a color copy of passport to get GST refund @ 12%...More
,,A Walk to remember,5.0,,"If you wanna check the finest viands of restaurants, pubs and bars and enjoy the beauty of Singapore at night you can always take the challenge of walking and discover the magical orchard road!!!!You can do it with friends and family."
,,"Very high end or low end shopping, very little middle ground.",3.0,,"I remember in the 80's I used to save heaps on all the new gadgets but now I am older I already have it and at a cheaper price in Aus. Lots of designer shops, but just for an example I bought a Tommy Hilf...More"

,,Great place to visit,5.0,,"We spent an evening walking up and down Orchard Road. Love all the trees and shrubs. If you like shopping, this is fun. Lots of night life."
,,Had to see it.....,3.0,,"It you love retail therapy this street is just for you....every imaginable shopping experience awaits. As Orchard Road is part of everything you hear about Singapore, it is worth seeing just to say...... ""been there, done that"""
,,Unending Shopping & Eating!,5.0,,"Since I have been here staying at The St. Regis Hotel on Tanglin Road just around the bend from Orchard Road, I have been down said road everyday! We are talking wide streets, lights, people watching, shopping, culture and of course Singapore heat! Took nearly 5 days before this 60+ body could stay out more than 30 minutes without nearing heat overload so take it easy and drink lots of water till adjusted. I only would wish that I could manuver around quicker because everyone seems to have mission but me. I am fumbling around! Love it none the less."
,,If you want to shop till you drop...,3.0,,"Then this is the street to go to. One mall after another, a lot of upscale stores and designers combined with other shops for ""real people""."
,,"It's a road, busy busy road. Love the hawker foods though",4.0,,"It's a super busy road, and if you come there in a budget like we did, just do some window shoppings and taste the Singapore ice cream sandwich on your way out of Dhoby Gout. Just 1 dollar, perfect."
,,SHOPPING,4.0,,Lots of malls and lots of shopping ... Orchard road houses all the known best brands and is a gr8 place for shopping.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"This road has got everything for a serious shopper, foodie & window shopper. The road has so many malls that you can't decide which one to spend time. Each mall has multiple floors & plenty to offer. It's bursting during the great grand singapore sale. Every known brand in the world can be seen here. Food options will leave yu wondering where & what to eat. One must try the ice cream in bread or biscuit sold by street vendors outside every mall. It's very delicious & cheap & at times has long queues."
,,Just a huge and UPMARKET shopping street,4.0,,"We stayed close to Orchard road , and from Midday to 10pm , its soo busy. Its very upmarket and you may prefer Vivo city for more normal shopping, But at least visit takasimiya"
,,average shopping area,3.0,,Average shopping area with a lot of shopping malls. Not quite special if you are more interested in sight-seeing.
,,It's a Shopping Area.....A Huge Shopping Area.....But A Shopping Area,3.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore's upscale shopping area. It's pretty conveniently located on the North/South (Red) MRT line. You can pretty much find any upscale brand you're looking for in multiple mega-malls. But that's just it. In the end, they're all mega-malls and a lot of them have the same stores, so it seems like a little bit of overkill to me."
,,Shopping! Shopping! Shopping! WOW!,5.0,,The GREATEST shopping on the planet!!! Stores go for what feels like both on the ground and above ground and underground. Never seen so many stores in my life! I've been shopping every week day for 3 weeks and still haven't been to 1/3 of the stores! :-0

,,Singapore Trip 2016,4.0,,Orchard road is OK but very tourist orientated. I am a bit spoiled as my wife is from Singapore and I have 12 brother and sister in-laws to take me shopping. We like to shop at Chinatown's Peoples Park Complex. Great place to shop and you don't get hassled by shop attendants.
,,Orchard road adventure,5.0,,"A fascinating shopping centre and the multiple levels mean you can , if you want, stay underground along the whole street. Be careful though of dodgy vendors in the arcades as some still exist and this is a shame."
,,So many choices,4.0,,Lots and lots of shops and many high end options. There are endless opportunities to find what you are looking for and can walk along orchard road and the adjoining shops for hours. Worth venturing out to see if you are a first timer in Singapore.
,,Upscale shopping area with some colonial heritage,3.0,,"This is where you can no longer tell you are in Singapore but might feel you are in any city that is being overrun by designer stores. A Gucci here, a Zara and Max Mara there and pretty soon you are seeing what you could have stayed home to see and not been nearly as hot."
,,Only for Shopping !,4.0,,"If you are here for sightseeing, don't waste your time there, only shops. But for shopping, you have everything you need. And even what you don't need !"
,,Orchard Rd,5.0,,"Want to shop, this is the place. So much to choose from. We were told Singapore was expensive, but we've found if you look around there are real bargins. Orchard rd has it all from the cheap and narsty right through to the high end big name brands."
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"Shopping along Orchard Road is definitely one unforgettable experience. You feel 100% safe for what you have purchased of, to me, Singapore it's already a brand by itself. There is a DFS (duty free) gallery also for shoppers to buy items with collected points and less in tax duty. No problem to locate a place for meals (light or heavy) and the shops generally close at 10pm. Perfect for shopping mania!"
,,Not anymore,3.0,,Orchard road is used to be Singapore's shopping strip. It is outdated now. You have to go to the end of the road to find upmarket's offering.
,,A must-go shopping heaven for tourists,4.0,,Walk from one end to the other. one day is not enough. Spare maybe 2 days to enjoy this shopping street. Go during Great Singapore Sales which starts in June n lasts about 2 months.

,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,Good deals. Amazing bargains. The variety and sizes of items available never ceases to amaze. You'll get very good deals on perfumes and shoes. You might need more than one day to go through the complete area.
,,Worth having a wander!,3.0,,"So, so, so many arcades and shops that one can easily loose direction. One shopping centre really has the same brand of shops in each. So one centre is really enough. Expensive and really busy. In the suburbs there are also great shopping centres, not as big but a lot cheaper. i.e. Tiong Bahru suburb."
,,Open your Wallet,3.0,,Unless you have mega bucks I think Orchard Road shopping precinct is only for sightseeing. Couldn't find any bargains at the Great Singapore Sale
,,Shopping Hub,4.0,,Orchard Road is the ideal place for shopping. The entire stretch of around 1.5 Kms has malls and shops on both sides. All branded and regular items are available in the old as well as new malls. The shops are open till around 8.30-9 pm. However remember that most of the food joints wind up by 10.30 or so except hawlkers and fast food jointsl. .

,,"Shopping, Shopping, and Even More Shopping!",5.0,,"Not that you can't brand-shop anywhere else, but you'd find almost anything and everything brand and luxurious on and around Orchard Road. As a tourist, bring along your passports and ask the customer services at each mall to receive some discount coupons.

To give your wallets or purses some time to cool down! you can enjoy the ION Sky (take the lift on ION Orchard 4th floor, closes at 5pm, free for public) or enjoy a movie at the quality Shaw Theaters Lido (IMAX is also there) or Cathay Cineplex (although the last ones care for your wallets again!).

You may even get lucky and get a bargain at Lucky Plaza or Far East Plaza, but do be careful at the time of the deal, and check the goods as well as the receipt carefully, as there have been fraud incidents before.

The Road itself is pleasurable to stroll, especially in the evenings as well as around occasions such as Christmas or Chinese New Year. Last but not least, if you're a shopping fanatic, do not miss the Great Singapore Sale (GSS) bargains if you happen to be in Singapore at the end of May or June."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,Awesome strip for shopping even window shopping. You can find whatever brand you can think of in this strip. Excellent window displays and very easy to get to.

I have never seen so many large shopping centres all around me filled with high end brands over five levels per store.

It has an array of stores for everyone plus many different options of food for all tastes.

Would recommend just to say you have seen it and the amazing endless shopping malls of Singapore"
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,"Orchard Road is decadence of shopping malls, stores, retail establishments, or anything other words you want to use for places to buy something. High end to low end and everything in between. Even the malls vary in status; some have enclosed walkings bridging Orchard Road. You can shop at Daiso or at a internationally known name brand place and drop more on an item than you may have spent for the entire vacation. Toss in the smattering of hotels and the ubiquitous restaurants often hidden inside the malls and you could comfortably live here. You may even come upon Isetan, the gated and guarded Presidential residence and Prime Minister's office. Easy to get to via public transportation or HOHO bus or even walkable, for those that can, from the Raffles Hotel area."
,,Night life,4.0,,Bought the popular 1 dollar ice cream here and the night scenery is good place for hangout. So many malls around here and in front of the orchard road is lucky plaza you can buy attractions ticket there or exchange money from money changer
,,Excellent with Hugh Shopping malls,5.0,,"This is was one of the busiest Roads in Singapore, Good to purchase clothes from top brands. Its above the Orchard Road MRT, Hence easily accessible. My Stay in Hotel Elizabeth which is near to Orchard Road made me to discover this Road.
Good for Handing around as well."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,hustle and bustle and lot of shopping complexes above ground as well as underground in metro sites. street performances...excellent eateries and high to mid range shopping complexes make the whole place lively
,,Heaven for Shopper,4.0,,"There are many shopping malls around here start from lowest up to highest price, and if you're lucky you can get special price or crazy deal for selected brand. Like me, because I was travelling on June, there were Singapore Great Sale :) Oh ya, dont forget to try singapore ice cream, its only SGD$1-1.20 each."
,,Orchard Road a Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"If its a shopping expedition or just watching the maddening crowd walking by Orchard Road is must do whilst in Singapore. The sights, sounds and smells will captivate you and the variety of things to buy will make you hide your credit card from your wife."
,,Hustle & Bustle,3.0,,Stayed at the nearby Orchard Hotel. This was our first stay in Singapore and it was just a 2 day stopover. being right next to the Hustle & bustle of Orchard road was a great introduction to Singapore.
,,For the very young or the very rich,4.0,,This was not one of my favourite outings. On Sunday there were literally 1000's of young people swarming in the Lucky and Far East Plaza. it was frightening and not a pleasant experience. The alternate was the high end stores and i am not into real and full price Guicci or Versace.
,,lovely posh shops mixed with chinese shops,5.0,,"A lot of our time on Orchard road was spent just shopping but not spending, the designer named stores were very expensive, we tended to seek out the chinese shops and spend a fortune!"
,,Nice Christmas lights!,5.0,,"Lights along Orchard Road during Christmas is simply fabulous and the best I have seen around the world! However, it is extremely crowded leaving barely enough space to walk around you. Singapore is an extremely safe place to be, so there is no worry about pickpockets making it possible to walk along it during the early hours of the morning without having to worry about your safety."
,,The fun of bargain shopping is almost lost now.,4.0,,Orchard road use to be a great fun place to explore with small outlets everywhere. Unfortunately it has been over-run with high end labels so every shopping mall is now exactly the same as each other. There are still a few small stores tucked away in corners but they are far and few between. Chinatown is better for the old Singapore shopping thrill of haggling a bargain.
,,High End Shopping,3.0,,"I think Orchard is a nice place to have. It's just a little too overhyped for me. The malls are all too expensive. I might go up there to eat. The Christmas lights are nice during December. I went to Lucky Plaza on a Sunday once and I just was laughing so hard. It's a popular place for the Helpers but it's uncontrollably amusing to hear the chatter of like a thousand Helpers. The malls are nice and you can get lost in them. If you want a good view, look up Ion Sky. It's free but the hours are restrictive."
,,You can buy anything here!,5.0,,"You really can buy anything you want here, so many shopping mall along the Orchard road. During the discount season it's really can save a lot of money😹"
,,Perfect for shopping,5.0,,Lots of people and so many shops. All the brands are there we only have the embarrassment of the choice !
,,Like to shop and spend serious money? This is for you,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopping paradise, but only if you are armed with plenty of cash. Designer label shops are there in abundance.

The place is remarkably clean and safe and teeming with people until the shops close at 10pm. On a Sunday, the street is packed with people literally sitting down and chilling on their day off. If patience is not your virtue, avoid!"
,,Mindblowing,5.0,,"If you have the money ,this is the place to spend. Paragon, tang and takashimaya are the places to go. Many more malls on this road. you also have best places to stay with super cool hotels, st.regis, marriott, four seasons to name a few"
,,Lovely place,5.0,,"Orchard road is heart of Singapore, business hub and lot of shopping attractions. Very cool place to visit. Very close to the MRT stations. Lot of hotels are located. Very central place, very easily accessible to every place of Singapore. In night this place give a fantastic views. Shopping malls are comparatively higher in rates"
,,Buy buy buy.,5.0,,"Bring a Singaporean, orchard road will come to my mind when I need to buy fashion items or when so bored and have nothing to do during off days. Why? Cos many buildings are linked together via underpass (Ngee Ann city, wisma, ion, scotts isetan, tangs and lucky plaza)
In the whole of orchard road, u get from branded, international brands, local designer and even flea market. Hope u will enjoy yr shopping trip while you in Singapore."
,,If you are into shopping.....,5.0,,"Then this is the place to visit. It is about a kilometre (if not more) of shops, shops and more shops. Pretty much every major brand is represented here.

It is clean and you cannot really get lost on it. There are two MRT stations, which are pretty much at each of the end road. These being Orchard and Newton MRT.

It can be a bit of a walk, especially if you want to go into each shop or shopping centre. However, there are plenty of cafes, fast food and restaurants along the way to feed your hunger or slake your thirst.

I have been there several times and probably the best time of year is near Christmas as they have a great Christmas light display running along the road.

Definitely allocate a day to do this, but if you are looking for some good buys, then this is the place to do it."
,,Very Busy Road,4.0,,"We stopped here on our first day while waiting for our room, had brunch. Very busy road.The malls are great, they seem to have all the expensive brands from all over the world.We enjoyed looking around."
,,Shopping!!,3.0,,Easy to get to from the MRT. Lots of high end stores as well as a few cheaper stores that we don't have in Australia. Perfect if you are looking to go shopping.
,,Great place to spend a nice evening,4.0,,Orchard road is a good place to shop but its more expensive. You will get very good shopping malls for high fashion brands. Luckily during our stay there were plenty of sales so we did shop quite a bit the Orchard Road malls
,,Shopping frenzy,4.0,,Too many outlets and malls with many choices. Expensive but tempting. MRT is nearby and u can combine this with the botanical gardens tour.
,,excellent shopping,5.0,,all the shopping was all close together near the metro station which was excellent and restaurants were always near bye
,,"Great shops, hotels and environment. All you need is here",5.0,,"Very up-market shopping and residential area with great eating options and cafés. It sets a very pleasant tone for walking around and enjoying the city life go by. There are a number of good hotels in this area- one of which is worth my mention: Quincy Hotel. If you're visiting the area, I recommend staying at the Quincy.
Singaporean heat is overwhelming however the Orchard area is predominantly interconnected by underground passages from one mall to another and all these places are well air conditioned offering you the much needed coolness. Next time I am in Singapore, this is the area I will stay at again- and for sure that the Quincy again!"
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,The strip known as Orchard Road covers everything in the way of shopping and shopping malls / complexes. They range from the cheap to very Expensive and a tip for the avid shopper it when you go into a high rise shopping mall and if you like something - don't buy it yet - ask the price and then go higher up (to higher floors) where the same thing is at a cheaper price. The reason is the higher away from the ground floor - the cheaper the rent so the goods are cheaper.
,,A shoppers paradise,4.0,,If you want to shop this is the place to be. Mall after mall of shops which stay open late and sell anything and everything. Many hotels are situated in the area but not a place to stay if you want a relaxing stay as it is the equivalent to Oxford Street but with more hustle and bustle

,,Classic,5.0,,Best place to shop..lot of eateries...high end brands to normal...clean...safe..great place to stay...happening place
,,Best shopping in the world,5.0,,"I have never seen anything like Orchard Rd. Even America has got nothing on Singapore when it comes to shopping. The road seems to go on forever with giant shopping centres on both sides. Amazing choice, all the big brand names as well as up & coming one's, plus shops for the lower budget too. I found the Harry Potter staircases in one centre, up 2 floors down only 1 !!! that had me going for a while !!! Amazing experience even if you buy nothing at all, its worth the trip. Public transport is amazing in Singapore & Taxi's are cheap, so its easy to get to. Highly recommend it."
,,Expensive shopping though worth a visit,4.0,,"If you have a few days in Singapore its worth a visit. Many of the shops are expensive fashion shops and accessories, Louis Vitton bags and such. Many of these are in underground and air conditioned malls, convenient to walk through in hot Singapore."
,,Excellent Shopping Hub,5.0,,If you are visiting Singapore you not nothing is cheap there & if you are a shopaholic you won't even care. I think I got everything that I had in my list & didn't. The entire stretch is loaded with malls and some of them even interconnected - like Ion Orchard & Shaw House. You name the brand and you will find it. Totally in love with Singapore Shopping.
,,Not very special,4.0,,"Good place. Many shops along the street. Brands, fashion, cosmetics, food, pharmacies, everything you like to get. But it's just the same as Tokyo, NY, other famous places. I don't think you MUST visit here. Just walking around will be fun."
,,Nice,5.0,,"Great for shopping, you could probably find anything here. Both expensive and more affordable brands. Pretty stores!"
,,"Great food, great shopping",5.0,,ION mall has the best food court and restaurants. Furthermore it is a great shopping place for family and it is connected to Takashimaya and Wheelock place.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"If you like shopping you are in seventh heaven and even if you don,t its well worth a trip just to take in the size of some of the shopping malls. Not cheap as most are designer shops but worth going to window shop"
,,Excellent for shopping,5.0,,Orchard road is full of shops suitable for everyone's needs. One can do some good shopping. It is very tourist friendly too with many discounts applicable to tourists only :) Tourists can also claim the GTS back at the airport.
,,Too many shops,4.0,,"Crowded, a million shops. It's great if you really want to do some serious shopping. Otherwise, it's too crowded."
,,Mind Boggling amount of shopping!,5.0,,"We've been here so many times! it still keeps us so busy and excited to shop - we have our favourite shops and eateries, also love finding new ones! You need a lot of money, because you don't have 'çheap' shopping here! Still so clean, busy, vibrant and completely safe - esp if you are on your own"
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"With a many malls with a thousand shops sells many things here, never miss a things in orchard. Branded fashion, cullinaire, books, and movies you can find anythings here. You can reach orchard road by MRT to Orchard Station NR22"
,,The shopping district for tourists!,4.0,,Perfect meeting place for everyone! Who doesn't know Orchard Road? it's the place for tourists as hotels lined up the road and buses and MRT station can take you from one end to the other. Underground passage way for people during rainy and sunny days.
,,Money,5.0,,Great for shopping so many to choose from. If no kids I would have spent all day and a fortune on all the beautiful things I seen. My kids hate to shop x
,,Far east Rodeo Drive.,2.0,,"If you've got money to waste and want to be able to say you shopped Orchard, have at it. Don't see what the fuss is. Maybe if you're from a place this stuff is not available. Or you're a window shopper."
,,Singapore's retail escapade,3.0,,"Like Fifth Avenue in NYC or Oxford in London, Singapore boasts many fine retail high streets. Orchard Road is a key stop, and one of the high streets that keep reinventing itself.
Depending on where you start walking, and the season you come - I would usually like to start my walk from the Ion mall , and then work towards Atria and Takashimaya(Ngee Yan city).
Within these three landmarks, you would have come into contact with a real taste of Singapore designers, Singapore cuisine (from authentic street food to fine dining), and also international brands.

You can choose to walk underground or walk on the street level. The underground/basements are filled with interesting shops and food joints. On the street level, you will come across your favourite ice cream vendors. During festive seasons, talented baskers entertain. At the end of the road, you can make a turn to the famous Mandarin Hotel, or cross the road to Paragon mall, and then make your way back to Tangs Department store. Between Paragon and Tangs, there are also many low to mid range priced shops where you can prowl for cheap buys.

I like Orchard because the roads are well paved, the trees are shady and you can shop with ease, have a meal, rest your feet and start again. Service at most times is great along this row. In terms of the international brands, you can also choose many of the latest deisgns without having to queue for a long time."
,,It is for shopaholics,4.0,,"Completely love Orchard Road, amazing brands and shopping experience. Food, commute and availability of designs make me love it everytime. Takashimaya is must visit."
,,Don't bother with cookie cutter malls,1.0,,"You know what's unique about Singapore? The number of Uniqlo and H&M stores in this small land area.

What's missing in Orchard Road? Authentic Singaporean. ION Orchard is my favorite example: Sample the delicious Australian flavours of Salt Grill, and shop at the various homegrown brands like Prada and Dior.

Heaven forbid you venture into the subway and mingle with the basement crowd. May you never know the taste of a GOOD laksa, chicken rice or chilli crab.

Tourist trap only for those who feel like contributing to our economy. Nothing here you can't find online or cheaper in their home countries. You've been warned."
,,Jersey Mall in Asia,3.0,,"Its a nice place to visit but I would not want to shop there. For first time visitors like me I guess it is an obligation to see, but unless you are going to the thousands of souveneir shops, the average person can not afford anything at the high end retail establishments...hmm just like a New Jersey Mall only in Asia!"
,,busy.,4.0,,"all the shops you want, and more. very hot though for just window shopping, very comfortable inside the shops.Be careful the bargain days have gone, at least in orchard road that is."
,,Shopping galore!,5.0,,"If you're looking for bargain as well as high-end stores, this could be the place for you. Familiar name brands are everywhere as well as local brands. Also, a good place to find something to eat as restaurants are just everywhere.....and I mean everywhere."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Singapore first timer must visit this legendary orchard road. Starting from only lucky plaza, tang, nge ann, wisma atria, I think almost every year we can see something new along this road.
You can shop in high class mall for branded stuffs but also can find street ice cream with reasonable price."
,,Crowded but nice,4.0,,"Orchard always crowded, since the fist time I was there a long long time ago. Always new improvement in the street. If you go there on Christmas time, we can see all the christmas tree . its very nice"
,,Shopping dream!!,5.0,,"Everything you could want and more!! ION, Tangs and Robinsons on Orchard are favorites of mine. Taxi queues are easy to get to as well as the MRT. One of the best shopping streets in Asia for sure."
,,Play time & shop til you drop,5.0,,"A girl can dream & this is the place.
The wide tree lined boulevard provides spectacular people watching as well as the shopping.
All the designer brands are here.
Cartier let me try on all their panther rings -$110,000 on one finger.
Chanel showed my girlfriend their finest handbags.
The Great Singapore Sale was just starting so 20% off at many retailers - popular with locals & visitors alike.
It is hot & humid but the air conditioned shopping malls are a refreshing oasis of temptation."
,,"Shop, Shop, Shop",4.0,,"If ytou are looking to shop in Singapore, then Orchard Road is the place to go. Whatever you are looking for you will find it, you can literally shop till you drop. Although there are plenty of cafes etc to rest thosec weary legs and enjoy a cool drink."
,,Orchard Rd,4.0,,Excellent shopping here. Shop till you drop. One gets footsore from waking shop to shop. From here you can catch the underground to Clark Quay and places such as the Banana Leaf Apolo in Little India or Chinatown.
,,The Champ Elysee of Singapore,5.0,,"With countless shopping centres along the stretch, Orchard Road reminds of me Paris' Champ Elysee where it is basically shop till you drop. I personally like Paragon and Robinsons along this famous shopping belt."
,,boring,2.0,,"shops were good but far too expensive for the normal person, so hot walking around and up and down the streets"
,,Shopping,4.0,,In this road you can find most of the shopping malls in Singapore and they are near each other also there are a lot of hotels there you can stay at👍🏻👍🏻
,,High-end and busy,3.0,,"I am not a shopper! This strip of high-end boutiques and malls is very clean, organised and safe. It is also busy and over-priced. My recommendation is to head to one of the many smaller malls in the surrounding suburbs to get a real feel for quality and value."
,,Great for shopping addicts but has a lot more,5.0,,"Long road in centre full of shops, hotels, restaurants and bars. This road is generally buzzing and even the shops are open well into the night"
,,Singapore's High street,5.0,,"A busy road with all sorts of tourists walking along sides of double sided shopping malls. You can find the reasonable to the highly expensive fashion and other goods from foods to electronics.
You'll never know you are on the equator if you see the place behind a display screen."

,,Crowded but its all there,3.0,,Lots of shopping and plenty of options but way too overwhelming for me. If you need any western sizes this will have some of the best chances. Pruces overall are not cheap.
,,A hot London,5.0,,"The shopping on Orchard Rd is second to none. Think Westfield, Bond St, The Trafford centre, Macy's all on one road!

Great under ground walk ways so you avoid the inevitable tropical rain.

Some fabulous eateries. I'd highly recommend Gusto by the ION centre. Good value great food!"
,,"A facade of expensive shopping, behind the veil is an open arena for hook ups...",3.0,,"Orchard road is all expensive shopping Centres and undercover hookers, high class and Low class both. Looks fancy for a walk, but nothing special really. Nevertheless, some of the most well known and renowned shopping Centres and movie theatre is right here in Orchard road"
,,Orchard road at night,2.0,,Orchard road is nothing valuable. Its like you are going on jagrata or marriage etc and 100-150 feet road covered with lights thats it. So go or not to go its all your wish.
,,lost its glory,3.0,,"overpriced shopping for tourists, locals tend to keep clear, not too bad if sales are on, but you could buy in your own country."
,,Shopping galore!,5.0,,Can't believe the number of shops / shopping mals in this one road. Every shop available for all walks of life. All located in road that is well maintained and super clean. Credit to the people of Singapore
,,Shop til you drop!,5.0,,"Orchard Road has always been a favourite for shopping, so busy yet Singaporeans are polite and you can find everything here. It's also connected to several underground labyrinth style tunnels to connect to other malls so you can stay out of the heat and humidity! Happy shopping!"
,,The best shopping high street on the planet,5.0,,"When there are 22 malls on one road it does cause your brain to flutter a bit lol from Plaza Singapura on one end to Tanglin Mall on the other and Ion at the centre of Orchard Rd, there's nothing you cannot get.

,,Shop to you drop!,5.0,,"Shopping mecca to die for, but also many nice bars and restaurants too numerous to mention. Take your wallet :)"
,,Unending shopping,4.0,,If you are into lots of shopping this is the place to visit. There are a number of shopping centers linked to each other underground. Lots of Designer labels stores. In a way in most of these shopping centers you could be in Europe. It's a place to visit and experience but frankly after one visit I wouldn't go there especially that it's very expensive.
,,The shopping destination,4.0,,"Easily accessible through MRT, you can find everything that a fashion platter has to offer. Not good if you are a budget traveller."

,,The Brrands,5.0,,Hahaha Shoppers you will love this place. They have all the high end brands to shop from. Delve into the world of shopping.

A few street vendors selling ice cream and occasionally buskers too . Beautiful at night particularly during holidays. All the name brand shops in the malls or along the road. Food courts and bookstores. On rainy days, head to the underground shops along the West side of Orchard from Ion to Taka. MRT lines operate along the route so you can get just about anywhere on the island without going outside."
,,Shopper's Delight,4.0,,"Shops, shops and more shops, all high end like Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton etc. Definitely out of our league but a real eye opener. The malls just go on and on forever. We went in one building and came out about three buildings along without ever coming outside! We found the biggest food court I have ever seen serving up endless dishes from so many different countries. I was fascinated, I could have stood and watched them making up meals the whole day. Definitely worth a visit, you don’t have to buy anything, you just have to experience."
,,never bored,5.0,,visit orchard dont forget for 1$ ice cream.... you must try.... cause this ice cream is happening at singapore... cheap and delicious....
,,Singapore,4.0,,"Nice City with sauer looking people in it , one needs a lot of money , recon city is well overpriced , but a marvel of conformity , the underground shopping malls at Changi airport , ? hope you or anyone else visiting has enough time and money"
,,The World Street,5.0,,"Orchards street is the Oxford Street of Asia. And I have no doubt in making that statement.

Two of my most loved streets to walk and feel the buzz of the city that's alive and kicking even at 4 in the morning. From Shopping to eating to doing nothing. That's an ideal street to be walking on, if you want to feel the world."
,,Have it all!,5.0,,"Very good shopping at Orchard Road, on the ground floor you find big shopping malls and luxurious shops but go done one floor and you find even more shops! Many shops have completed range of their products so what you don't find here you probably don't need!
Mostly fashion shops"

,,Shopping haven,4.0,,"Every high-end luxury store has a presence on this very long street. Many different malls, catering to slightly different kinds of shoppers. Many hotels too.
Not very convenient if it rains, as they do not have many sheltered walk ways.
Dining options are not great. Easily accessible by MRT or Taxis. However, getting a Taxi during peak periods can be a challenge."

In the afternoon you will see a lot of bird, and the sound of bird so relaxing."

,,Shop until you drop!,5.0,,Exhausting but illuminating. Many products not available in the west and if you hunt there are good buys to be had especially away from the larger Malls. LVuitton has a greater range than any where outside the Marina. Certainly better than Paris...yes!
,,Expensive but worth it,5.0,,Its a great location and must watch.. As stores are mostly branded so its very expensive. we also enjoyed the walk
,,For Shopping Lovers,5.0,,"This place is amazing, so many shops and so many options to choose from. The cool welcoming, air conditioned malls after walking on the streets are such a delight"
,,Shopping to the hilt !,5.0,,"The boulevard offers a combination of expensive and less expensive shopping malls. To avail items at an affordable and reasonable prices, Lucky Plaza is recommended. To get the taste of Filipino cuisine, Kabayan Restaurant is recommended."
,,Just for an ice cream,3.0,,"The road is crowded in anytime. I only visit this place to try the ice cream, well it's soo standard with ice and bread, but ok lah."
,,Good but ..,4.0,,"I am in Singapore for the first time and staying 1 minute from the main street. The street is full of expensive shops that have everything you can get from most places you go to so nothing special.
It is good for a look in the smaller markets on the street but be careful of the underpasses where is can get quite confusing where you end up and are going . (Btw the underpass is needed to get across some of the main streets.)
If you like a good selection of shops it will be ideal for you."
,,"Everything you're looking for, but...",3.0,,... so crowded and busy. If you know what you're looking for it is great. In. Buy. Out. But for snooping around it is very crowded and not very relaxing.
,,Shopping!!!!!!!!!!!!,5.0,,"Mostly High end Shopping along this Road Ion is all designer Brands, Paragon is High end Shopping, Down the end of Orchad is Somerset shopping Centre, more average shopping, quite a busy Street for shopping, similar to times Sq New York"
,,Famous for a reason.,4.0,,"There is a reason people come from all around the world to see this place, lots of high end la de da shops for the tourists looking to splash the cash. As for me, I like going through the the mazes malls that dot the road personally.

You just have to pay attention to which way you need to turn when you get out as a wrong turn could make a huge backtrack as orchard road is huuuuge."
,,Always favorite place in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard is always a place to be when in Singapore. Ambiance and restaurant are very convenience. Movie theater are the best in Singapore. Trees, pedestrian -- all are disciplined."
,,A shoppers Paradise,4.0,,Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise. Shops stretching for miles with every shop you can think of. There also a number of Mails as well and abundance of food halls for every type of taste. If you are a shopper this would be paradise for you hours can pass you by with you knowing If you are visiting Singapore you must visit Orchard Road to believe it.
,,QUALITY SHOPS ALL IN AREA,4.0,,No matter what you want its all here in Orchard Road and you can pick up some bargains if your lucky. Great eateries around the place and Starbucks for a good coffee. Highly recommend.
,,The reason to go to Singapore!,5.0,,"One of the best, biggest and cleanest shopping roads i have ever seen in my life. The Orchard road was the reason for us to go to Singapore. Can not write what you will see there. Go to Singapore and explore yourself!!!"
,,all big brand showrooms,5.0,,Its one of the best area for high end shoppng.. all big brands have their showrooms here.. its out of reach for people like us
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"This is the centre of Singapore shopping & suits all budgets . Easy to get around except on weekends when it gets very busy . Underground maze of shops & air conditioned comfort .Also lots of different cuisines , food courts , & great atmosphere ."
,,Walk about carefree,4.0,,"I love the easy feeling in this city. The sense of security and well being that engulfs you.

The cleanliness, the order, the friendliness and the relative affordability as a tourist if you are prepared to go looking away from the tourist type venues.

Don't be mistaken there is some seriously expensive shops and restaurants here, but use your head and the budget stays intact even in Orchard road."
,,Avoid it if you can,2.0,,Very crowded and people walk at a slow pace. Most of your journey are smoke- filled till almost choked. Anti-smoking laws are strict but most the people are smoking while walking. Sunday is worse.
,,Orchard Road .. Past and Present,5.0,,"I came first to Singapore from Europe in 1974, quite a different story and view.
Many places then and now are not the OLD homely Singapore, of course many buildings were due to be renovated but the city planning decided otherwise now its the new Singapore, but not for me now the food is very expensive and drinks as well.
Orchard towers back in 1974 had some bars and The Country club- Genevieve with a live country band with Mathew and the Mandarins, all gone, then there was the Tropicana another lively night joint and the treetops club in the Old Holiday Inn hotel with the Red Baron diner and roasted ribs for lunch and German sausages and beer, round the corner was the Negara hotel with the sing song bar all gone, 1974 there were some small restaurants opposite the Hilton Hotel, Pink Pussycat and 392 bar and restaurant and a very good eating place forgot the name history
I still like Orchard road , just need to forget the past ( which I not possible can)"
,,Shopping,4.0,,Orchard road is a vibrant buzzing shoppers paradise ..From high end shopping to local goods there's something for everyone's shopping taste. Be prepared go spend at least half a day here.
,,Not a fan,2.0,,"Twice now Ive tried to shop at Orchard Road. 7 years ago I couldnt find any clothes or every day bargains and still didnt this time. Great for high end shopping though i.e Gucci, Prada.
The sizing isnt for Westerners and there are way better shopping strips/centres in Singapore."
,,Warm festive period,5.0,,"The night time views of Orchard road were amazing, just walking round and looking. It was a pleasure to go into the malls to see their christmas displays the air con was a bonus. Streets were full of christmas shoppers a bit surreal though a warm christmas. All this for free too."
,,You have to do it... but CROWDS,3.0,,"Orchard Road is packed with loads of high-end shops; however there is a lot of repetition. There isn't just one Louis Vuitton shop;it feels like there is almost one per shopping centre! The real joy of Orchard Road is looking for the smaller boutiques in the centres; this is where you can find some really unique pieces that would be hard to find elsewhere in the world.

However, if you're not one for crowds, you might want to give it a miss. There are times in the day where it is absolutely PACKED with people, all with their own agenda. It shouldn't put you off from visiting, but it's certainly worth considering. Also; budget a fair bit of time to do the street as it is very large."
,,vibrant,5.0,,Huge market place for shopping . It has all the expensive brands. The ambience is very vibrant and chirpy. One of the most happening place I must say
,,Lovely day spent,5.0,,I am in love with this place. I spent the whole day hear. Beautiful buildings and musical fountain. I couldn't stop taking pictures. Beautiful clean streets and lovely people around.
,,Something for everyone,4.0,,"Don't expect to find bargains here (or at least we didn't.) All the high end brand names are represented in this shopping strip as well as a few unknowns. Several large shopping ""centres/malls"" as well, all with several levels of shops. Most of them don't open until 11am though but they stay open late. Plenty of food places stop and rest/grab a coffee. Although quite busy, we never found it overcrowded and the area is kept very clean. Plenty on public transport available but we chose to walk to fully appreciate it. Looks lovely of a night time with the lights on as well."
,,How it's changed....,5.0,,We still always go for a walk along Orchard Road when we visit Singapore. At the corner there is a great pub / restaurant which is a great stop for a cool drink. This time we continued further into Little India. Very interesting area.
,,Everyone should go there at least once,4.0,,"This is the main shopping district in Singapore. Most of the luxury brands in the world have shops, giant stores, or even malls here. There are also plenty of specialty areas, for instance a mall devoted entirely to Filipino migrants, who congregate there on Sundays to send money back home. The sidewalks are nice and wide, and there are even places to sit now and then, and vendors of cold drinks always easily accessible. I don't go there to shop because I'm not interested in luxury brands, but I do love the food court in the basement of Takashimaya. Everything is more expensive than other stores, but if you love Japanese food this is the place to go."
,,Vibrant shopping hub,5.0,,"The go-to place for anything shopping. I love Orchard Road. Love the atmosphere, love the multitude of cafes and restaurants, love the range of shops! If you're looking for a pleasant (sometimes humid) shopping holiday, this is a must visit!"
,,High end shoping,4.0,,I suppose this is a must if you come to Singapore but over the years it has lost its charm and become quite sterile. Better suited for a specific shopping spree than a stroll
,,The road that made Singapore famous for shopping,5.0,,"You'll be spoilt for choice at Orchard Road. Numerous malls, cafes, restaurants and boutiques compete for attention. There's always a SALE going on somewhere. International brands and cuisines are up against local fare. Scott's, ION Orchard, Tang's and Centrepoint constantly vie for the tourist dollar. There are bargains to be had. It isn't a bad idea to book a hotel here."
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"OK so you have had your fill of the tourist sight's, well this is where you need to be - shopping heaven. Everything and anything you need, food halls are fabulous, so many different types of food to choose from. Believe me you need a second suitcase to take all your goodies home."
,,Best place for shopping,5.0,,"you can nearly find everything you want to buy in SG, but most of malls will be closed in public holidays, eg, Chinese new year."
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"This is a shoppers paradise, though for me, much too expensive with mostly top end shops. Bargains can be found though and very interesting to walk and window shop. All modern shops and beautiful building most very open areas."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"One of the best places in Singapore for shopping and spending time for doing nothing:-) You can buy clothes, shoes or just watching. Walk, relax and have fun!"
,,Shoppers delight,5.0,,Definitely a shoppers delight. Lots of shopping for both ends of the scale. Easy to get around. Extremely clean and safe. Can easily walk from end to end. Also recommend eating at the many different eatery's that are around.
,,Lots and Lots of shopping complex,5.0,,"If you are a brand lover and are looking for shopping, then this is the place to buy. But if you are looking for something cheap, then this is not the place for you. Stuff is quite expensive here!!"
,,Brand brand brand,3.0,,All the luxury brands present themselves on the Orchard Road. Over and over again. After a few minutes I wasn't sure if I still was in Singapore or New York. Impressively annoying and repetitive.
,,Our travel to Singapore,5.0,,Super great extensive shopping and easy location. Easy to find pharmacy and coffee and wine. People friendly.
,,Shopping heaven or hell,3.0,,Shopping is what it's all about. Every name under the sun which you can avoid along with the humidity as you can get between shops underground mostly. Odd to even see a Jamie's Italian. Trouble is that you could be in one of many places in the world as all shops the big names.
,,best location. best hospitality. comfy clean room.,5.0,,"3rd of may 2016 to 6th may.
orchard wing # 1329
staff very helpful.
quick to respond to issues
my mom cant use the bath tub. we were quickly given another room without any hassle. thanks for this!
Breakfast food were extravagant.
unfortunately one or two menu were below par (fried rice dry hard and unappealing).
in the swimming pool also few moments of madness. one korean guest got angry on the first day we use the pool. reason= pool cleaning at 9 am. just the right moment when guests most likely using the pool. amazingly the next day it happened again with another guest. a Caucasian man got angry and left the pool 2 minutes after going in also round about the 9ish am in the morning. homework for management to improve.
room was spotless clean. air conditioning worked really good.
bed was firm and just perfect.
checking in was quick and easy.
taxi always ready and available.

all in all.. we had the best time in Mandarin Orchard."
,,great but mostly for tourists,3.0,,too many people on this street and its too commercial. yes go here if you want to shop and eat at mostly restaurant chains but this place does not give you the real vibe of singapore. sadly most tourists end up going here and thats it!
,,"Yes, the shopping is great but really it can get too crowded",4.0,,"My advice is, don't just wander up and down the road (it's too long to do that anyway) but instead do some research and go to the specific shops that you are interested in. Also, be aware that it can be very difficult to get a taxi from the Orchard Road area (there are usually long queues at all the taxi stands) so you will have to either order one by phone (get an app and use wifi if you don't have a Singapore phone number) or get the MRT to leave."
,,A different world in singapore,4.0,,The roads and malls and stores are amazing quite the lace you want to be the restaurants the place all of it is beautiful and a lovely place to see all the best sports cars at least I stood for 10 mins and I got to see a koenisegg agra to ferrari ...
,,People Watching,4.0,,"Mall overload. Each new mall is glitzier than the one before. High end shops abound in all the malls. If shopping in high end shops is your thing then Orchard Road is paradise for you. If shopping is not a high priority, buy a local ice cream and sit and people watch. Near Somerset MRT in a side street is a row of old Singapore buildings, some housing antique stores, cafes etc. A great photo opportunity."
,,Orchard road trip,5.0,,To much shops to see. With nice little places to sit out side and watch the world go by. The exchange rate between the £ and the sing$ made it quite expensive compared to a few years ago but well worth a look and the Lucky plaza.
,,The heart and soul of Singapore!!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is where all the excitement and happenings are. This is the heart beat of Singapore. Walking along Orchard Road you may chanced upon promotions, events, and activities that are happening along different parts of Orchard Road.

On the day I was there, there was a Thai fair happening and lots of singing and promotions of Thai produce. Further up Orchard Road, Isetan flown in some Japanese drummers/dancers and they staged 30mins shows every couple of hours. It was a such a treat!! It was vibrant, noisy and exciting.

Further along, a visit to Tangs was enjoyable, with cooking demonstrations with free popcorns, fried koay teow, baked cakes, fried rice being dished out for sampling after each demo. Competitive demonstrators flogging their wares and cooking up a storm!!

Across the road from Tangs, the food court in the complex near the MRT station boast stalls and stalls of great local delicacies. Hawker fares in airconditioned comfort!! And cheap too!

One needs a couple of days to fully appreciate and cover the length of Orchard Road and the many malls/shops/complexes. The many restaurants, hawker styled food courts, cafes etc along the road makes the journeying a delightful experience!!

Also a lighter wallet after buying a set of wok and frying pan!!"
,,Shoppers' paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road has a well-deserved reputation as a shoppers' paradise -- lots of options, mostly large-format stores/malls. We visited epiCenter in particular which was huge, with plenty of variety. The food court was very nice as well."
,,Shopping Overdose,3.0,,"Ok Ok, I'm a sucker for shopping so I went there. Justy so you know it makes other big cities shopping areas pale by comparison. One shopping mall every 100 meters and this goes on for about 3/4 miles. So the question is do you really need all this?"
,,Lively,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the best places to hang around in Singapore. There is a lot of malls around that area and lot of cafes to chill. The environment is always clean, we had there local ice cream with bread and it was super delicious."
,,shop until you drop,4.0,,Every shop you can think of and several more as well. There are some great department stores as well. Love it
,,Shoppppppppppping,4.0,,"Shopping, shopping & shopping. From local stores to the high end designer stores. It has everything for everyone. I have seen street performances here as well. Has Malls, Pubs & many eateries. The whole walk on the Orchard Road & the experience is enjoyable."
,,Branded goods shopping,4.0,,"Road full of malls and branded shops. But do not miss LUCKY PLAZA, you can find cheap souvenirs and other goods. For Filipinos, you might want to visit this mall. You can see many Filipinos hanging around the Plaza. We just spent 2 hours in the area walking and eating."
,,shop till u drop,5.0,,"the shopping district of singapore, if you love to shop and malls is your thing, then goto to orchard road and be amazed with the amount of malls on this road , also lot good place to sit and chill also ."
,,shopping,5.0,,"the amount of clothes stores and restaurants in this area is really amazing, i come always here when in Singapore, my wife also loves it !"
,,Singapore's Number One shopping street,5.0,,"Once, people went to Singapore for the shopping. That was a long while ago, now prices are much the same as they are everywhere else. The resourceful Singaporeans have countered this by going up-market. Most of the old-style mom and pop shops have been replaced by splendid retailing palaces. I no longer go to Orchard Road, it's a waste of time as far as I'm concerned."
,,Months together required for all to see so well managed and easy to enjoy.,4.0,,"We could contribute only one day and can say went more more thirsty. Chance given, we will devote at least 3 days to enjoy and buy world class stuff. All available at one go. Superb."
,,The central of Sgp,4.0,,"Orchard road is so famous road. The very clean road. Many mall and fashion branded, mount elisabeth (one of famous hospital also in there). You must come and looking orchard if you going Singapore. Nice to see although just for walking, capture the moment,sight seeing or shopping. Comfortable for kids. Oya they also have the 2 dollars ice cream in this road. Enjoy!"
,,Shoppers delight,5.0,,"Don't miss LUCKY PLAZA. Easy to find and many many bargains. Yes, there are more upmarket places. I had a jacket tailor made. Measured one day, picked up the next day and a perfect fit for this slightly obese body."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"Mall after mall after mall, every shop imaginable from the top designers to local ones. Take your passport to get the tax free savings"
,,Very Nice,5.0,,A walk in this road would be the only thing that anyone would ever want if they had a bad day at work or a day. It's that amazing.
,,Loads of shopping,4.0,,"Great place to visit for shopping, lots of brand name stores. Great sculptures along the very wide footpaths, just makes shopping more interesting and enjoyable."
,,All the Top Brands,4.0,,"If you're looking for the Gucci's and Givenchy's this is the place to go, although don't expect to find anything you can wear every day. There are some good down to earth makes like Zara, H&M (and dare I say M&S) but it's more like walking through a museum in some of the shopping centre. Leave your credit card at the hotel - it'll be cheaper."
,,Busy street,4.0,,Like every other city. Having a lot of big malls and showrooms. U must try the bread ice cream. Initially I thought it was funny. BUT it is tasty. Good place to walk around...
,,Must visit road in Singapore,4.0,,Orchard road is famous for its glamour. Glam sham glory of Orchard is never found anywhere in Singapore. From pubs bars to restaurants to shopping and malls everything is available on Orchard. Well connected by buses and MRT this is must visit for aby tourist or locals.
,,busy street for everything,5.0,,"shopping and food, close by Yee On City- a big shopping mall, can find everthing in Orchard Road, only 5 minutes walking"
,,Orchard Road is Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a must when visiting Singapore. The shopping, sightseeing, restaurants and its people add to the colour and vibrancy of this area. Make time to walk the road and soak up the local atmosphere. It is well worth it."
,,best place to shop for Branded Goods,5.0,,Its a street with lot of top end shops all but you get is brand shops... you will never see so much branded shops in one street with so much collection. no need to take tours its just bus or mrt away
,,Shop til You drop,5.0,,"Orchard road offers retail shops and malls like ION, which is huge and offers all kinds of stores from regular to very upscale. You can rest having a tea at TWG Tea store, having afternoon tea. There are 3 MRT stops along Orchard road and Hard Rock Cafe is Close by( MRT stop ""Orchard""). Plan a full day."
,,Wow! What a centre of activity!,5.0,,"Stayed at the nearby Orchard parade Hotel for 2 nights, and enjoyed walking down Orchard Road and seeing all the shops - you could shop here almost 24/7 (if you could stand the oppressive heat!) and still not be bored - so much choice. Fantastic."
,,Brilliant shopping.,5.0,,Great place to shop as you get high street brands and top end designer brands all at the same location. Lovely food courts to indulge in Singaporean meals and cafes to enjoy a coffee while people watching.
,,excellent,5.0,,"Best shopping ever, what more can l say, and lived Singapore fabulous place definitely have to get back there"
,,"if you love hussle, bussle and shopping then this is for you.",5.0,,"orchard road is centrally located, busy with people going in all directions including underground to walkways, shopping malls and I think you can find what you're looking for here or spend hours looking."
,,Orchard Road,3.0,,We didn't enjoy Orchard Road like we did before. All the Brand names are everywhere not small boutiques around anymore. A bit disappointed.
,,A CHINESE WONDERLAND,5.0,,One of the finest shopping centres in the World. You can order a suit or a dress here in the morning and it will be cut out and made from scratch and ready to wear within 24 hours. You can buy everything and anything here AT A PRICE. Fantastic experience. Hot & humid but everywhere is airconditioned.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,Tang the big department store makes David Jones look like k-mart with prices to match but you can buy all the big designer brands here.
,,Shopping Mecca,4.0,,"From LV to H&M, every conceivable brand you can think of you will find. From one shopping mall to the next, you will need lots of money to truly appreciate Orchid Road. Need an entire road to walk the street and all the malls along the strip."
,,A Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"My wife and I have been visiting Singapore and Orchard Road regularly since 1983. We even stay in the vicinity ......

Day 1 today of a short 3 day trip and the better half is out on her own exercising retail therapy.....

Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise offering a multitude of department stores, hotels, food courts, bars and pubs, restaurants , etc. and stretches for miles.

Personally, I am not into shopping but enjoy walking down the road and taking in the sights - The Istana Park, lovely architecture from a bygone era, massive departmental stores and shopping malls, etc. A real ""happening place"" easily accessible by public transport - the Dhoby Ghaut and Somerset metro stations are both on Orchard Road and several public buses ply the route."
,,Fun all day and night,4.0,,"Orchard road is an exciting place to visit. Lots of color and noise. Shopping is varied, from lucky plaza to ion. Go to lucky plaza for money changers and try an ice cream in bread from the night vendors. Best eat is takashimaya food court."
,,Full day out,5.0,,"You must visit Orchard road, for shopping, people watching,and great eats, try Ion basement 4, what a selection of food, you,ll be spoiled for choice, what a selection,in fact all big malls have great food courts, also try Coffee Bean, great coffee, for a really refreshing drink get a Sunrise cold drink, fabulous."
,,Shopping & Eating!!,4.0,,Does not matter what part of Orchard Road you are in there is sure to be either an underground shopping experience or a building full of shops & cafes!! Wear good shoes & enjoy the experience!!
,,Shops shops & more shops,4.0,,"Whats not to like about Orchard Road. The Malls were fantastic, great way to escape the Singapore heat!! You can wander around and get lost in some of these malls, you just seem to go from one to another. I enjoyed ION and Somerset 33, I found the store variety the best in these two. Most of the High End stores are on entry level, you have to go up or down to find the more affordable stores. I could have done with 2 whole days shopping here, I only had about 6 hours so I was frantically going from one mall to another, didn't really get to have a good look at the department stores.
From my experience Retail Assistants aren't the most helpful in Singapore, the have a kind of 'cash & wrap' mentality, no one offers to help you or offer any assistance."
,,WHAT IS THE FUSS ABOUT,3.0,,"Over crowded, steamy, all shops look similar. A 1 hour visit enough just to say I've been there. If you like shopping then different story. Most big cities would have a similar area."
,,Shop shop shop,3.0,,Orchard road is where you will get the best of the best. For shopping its pretty expensive. There are cheaper places in singapore to shop just as nice. Wouldnt go again. Would maybe recomend to others.
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Allways a good time had here,Luckys Plaza for cheap stuff and Ion centre for good stuff,use the hawker areas for good cheap food."
,,for shopping lovers !,3.0,,mostly offers luxury brands... each mall has the same brands... go only if you keen to shop from luxury stores
,,Asia's shopping centre,4.0,,"Every top end retailer seems to be here, all in smart air conditions malls, If you want branded high end quality goods there are few better places you could visit."
,,Nice place for shopping.,5.0,,"Ion Mall is the most high end mall with all international brands being located in first and second level. One can get taxi from this mall the taxi stand being just outside.

Orchard Road is the upmarket shopping area with several malls. Ideally just outside small shops offer equally good material and with much economically one can do shopping.

One has to virtual lye explore to do shopping rather than studying anywhere reviews."
,,impressive shopping street,4.0,,"I liked walking around here, the street is very busy, though. All the top fashion brands are represented here, so you can shop to your heart's content. This is a very expensive city, though."
,,Fabulous mall,5.0,,"If you like your shopping, you'll love this place. You can very easily be in here for an entire day. There are high end and mainstream stores as well as some lovely eateries. Worth a visit."
,,"Busy , Busy Street",4.0,,"Endless shopping Centres- some with designer label shops, some with market style shops. Heaps of choices - some long walks underground. Market style shops were overflowing some days, hard to get into shops. Quite hot in these - and on the street."
,,Shopping time,4.0,,Orchard Road is the famous place to visit and shopping. So many Shopping malls accross the street from North to south. Prepare your money and shop till you drop
,,A must for every visitor,5.0,,"This road is Iconic. High End stores scatter along its edges, as well as many trinket shops, for those looking for bargains come to the Great Singapore Sale generally beginning June where massive bargains can be found. Definitely a road to walk down either up above or down in the intricate underground system.
Christmas Time is particularly gorgeous with many centres 'snowing' at set times, the lights are gorgeous as each 'shopping' building competes for the best light display."
,,Upmarket shopping malls in one long line,4.0,,"Mostly upmarket stores across many malls along about a 2 kilometre stretch, serviced by buses and 3 MRT stations (Orchard, Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut) and surrounded by 4 star and 5 star hotels. They would be most attractive when sales are on.

There are pockets of mid-market stores on Orchard Road, but not many left now. For mid-market, I recommend Plaza Singapura mall (above Dhoby Ghaut MRT station). A branch of Tim Ho Wan is found there, but go off-peak, or be prepared to queue.

For low-cost goods and clothing, go to Chinatown (Chinatown or Outram Park MRT stations), or what the Government advertises as the 'Heartland' malls: i.e. the suburban malls, some of which are very good. With the extensive MRT network, those suburban malls are very accessible, although you may get lost inside from time to time."
,,"Yeah, sure....lots of shopping",3.0,,"Meh. This isn't that different from any other main street in a major urban center. This street could be in any town. Sure, there's tons of shopping, but it is not necessarily reflective of Singapore. This stretch of shopping could be in Tokyo, Seoul, L.A."
,,shopping street,5.0,,I think shopping tourists would not want to miss this famous singapore shopping street. Lots of malls and hotels can be found here.
,,"amazing place to shop, esp high end brands",4.0,,"singapore is well known for fashion and orchard road is just the place to be in if you want to be a part of that. this is where you will find outlets of almost every brand (well lets say all the brands that matter). i would split orchard road into two section largely, the one up on the road and the one underground (as you might know, singapore has a plethora of shops and eateries underground - connected to almost all MRT stations). the shops on the road are more high end, but the ones underground are also pretty good. although its easier not to get lost while you are on the main road - the underground portion is like a labyrinth! the red line MRT has a stop at orchard road"
,,Just a continous street of shops,1.0,,Nothing interesting there if you do not have plan to buy something precise. Better to spend time in marina bay mall you will find exactly the same.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,If you like shopping then this is the place for you. The sheer volume and variety of shops is overwhelming. The streets are spotlessly clean which makes it an enjoyable place to walk around.
,,Nice road,5.0,,A very clean road of Singapore even for the Asia even for entire world and it is the icon and must visit place when you are in Singapore
,,Still managed to buy something,4.0,,"We got out at the taxi bay out the front of Lucky Plaza, we then walked along Orchard Road.
Yes Orchard Road is full of expensive shops but if you look hard enough you can find a few bargains along the way.
We got slightly confused with the underpass and ended up walking around in circles for some time,
But all in all we had a really good few hours and happy with the bags of shopping we got back to the hotel with."
,,"Shops everywhere, but nothing special",3.0,,"Orchard Road is good for exclusive and expensive shops. For tourists it is just mall after mall, there is nothing special or extraordinary about Orchard Road. It isn't build in a cozy or marvelous fashion. It quickly becomes boring and i recommend only stopping by if you have plenty of time, there are much more exciting areas in Singapore to visit."
,,Shopping Road,3.0,,"If you want to go shopping you are just at the right place! From not so expensive to way too expensive ( if you are just an average backpacker) you'll find everything here. Still interesting to see! The ION offers a free entry to see SG from the 55th floor, which is worth seeing!!"
,,Spotless clean,5.0,,Many good shops are situated in this road. Smoking is prohibited by law. So you can walk anytime carefree.
,,"If you like shopping, this is for you!",3.0,,"All the major high end shops were represented and the shops go on forever - easy to get lost! But, there was a Marks & Spencer which was expensive and disappointing (I don't live in the UK). It is a place where you can shop till you drop!"
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"Orchard rd is very famous for big shopping malls like Ion, Takashimaya, Isetan, Tang etc. you can shop till you drop here. All famous global brands are here. Lots of eatery places too. The best thing is an ice cream seller on the street (they cut the ice cream and you can choose either waffles or bread)."
,,Mecca for the materialistic,3.0,,"Building after building after building of shopping malls all stocking more of the stuff we already have - clothes, shoes, handbags, etc, etc - but could always do with one or two more. All at obscene prices that are somehow able to be reduced by 50% or even more, at ""sales"" time.
A classic area that highlights our class society - the haves and those who can only dream of having."
,,World Class Shopping,5.0,,"Its been a few years since I have been to Singapore.

The masses of street traders have been replaced by the big global brands. The place is 2.2km long ( the main shopping area) and has some 28 shopping malls, FILLED with great food, great shops and gazillions of people.

One of those places that if you don't like people you will not like too much, but it has ALL of the shops, from lower to high end.

I would suggest that you try and plan where you want to go.

The food places are pretty good, but as this is a very high population place, not too many please have sit down places to eat, more take away."
,,Singapore Visitor Center,5.0,,You must visit Singapore Visitor Center @ Orchardgateway to get the most helpful advice on visiting most important places; Joey was amazing to advise where to be and when to enjoy the light and sound show at Marina Bay Gardens and thereafter at the base of Marina Bay Hotel. It was the experience of the life time; She even recommended the places to eat and overall how best to plan the sightseeing; Thanks Joey!!
,,"""Shoppers Delight""",5.0,,"Orchard Road,a must visit destination, for shopping indulgence with mix of high -street and
luxury brands.Have choice galore of Malls: ION
Orchard;313 Somerset ; Orchard Central;Robinsons;Wheelock Place& Tangs -famous departmental store.
You will have choice to choose from H&M/Marks&Spencer/Luxury Brands/ Jewellery of

complete without indulging in Food which is littered with eateries everywhere."
,,Pricey shopping,3.0,,"I am from the United States, and I have to say that shopping on Orchard Rd is very Pricey. If your are looking for trinkets to give as gifts, do buy them at Chinatown, because they are a whole lot cheaper there. But, its always nice to go and window shop Tang's Department Store on Orchard. But do your wallet a favor, and just shop in States for high end luxury items. Just fly to Ohare International Airport, Chicago, and take the free shuttle to The Fashion Outlets Of Chicago, and shop till you drop. A whole lot cheaper, plus they have hotels right across form the mall! We have busloads of international passengers at this mall. You will love it too!"
,,Very Busy,5.0,,Always busy and a collective of tourists on locals. A very interesting place to visit on a Sunday as the domestic helpers have their day off.
,,Main shopping road with numerous malls,3.0,,I walked down the road and entered a few shopping malls just to pass time during my two weeks visit to Singapore for business. Most of the luxurious malls are equipped with some of the major and expensive brands. There are also some smaller local malls in which you have to negotiate down your buys. Not for the common tourist.
,,"Great place with endless malls, restaurants and bars",5.0,,Orchard Road has always been a great place to shop. The streets are big and wide unlike a main shopping street such as Oxford Street in London. The place is safe and spotlessly clean. I'd suggest starting somewhere like ION Orchard which is central and at a crossroads with Scotts Road then walk down the road towards the marina direction and you will pass roughly 15 shopping malls on the way.
,,General review,5.0,,"Shoppers parades!!!!! All the malls and high street shops are there. Best time to visit is evening when it's well lit if you're around New Year ,,it's really beautiful"
,,Great for Shoppping,5.0,,"This is a great area for shopping and the center of many activities.

,,VERY HIGH END,4.0,,"Orchard Rd was nice, and even though <as a guy I don't mind shopping> but when I go to Asia I'm not interested to see all the shops I can get at home in 1000 other shopping centres.

It was worth checking out, but the best part was escape the heat just to get some air-conditioning.
All the shops are LV, Mont Blanc, Gucci etc...
If you've got $10,000 to spend in 5minutes your after that sort of thing, that's the place to go."
,,Fun shopping street,5.0,,"Great street to walk along and visit shopping malls. Paragon Mall was excellent. Good restaurants around this area. Not sure of the small shop owners where you can haggle price. We were offered binoculars for $2000 then he dropped price to $800!! We bought the bino's from a recognized electronics shop for $600 Beware the small traders.. Not saying they are all bad but get to know the price of 5the itim you want to buy, before you shop."
,,Not for South Africans shopping with SA Rand,4.0,,"Beautiful variety of designer shops, well worth a bit of exploring but very expensive for ""normal people"", if you can buy at M&S in the UK, for example, buy there as it is going to cost less in UK pounds"
,,Shopping galore!,4.0,,"The road is long and packed with all types of shopping.

Popping into the malls is a good way to explore many of the eateries along the way.

You could spend a couple of days easily just walking up this road which sells high end fashion goods to electronics and second hand rolex's so it has everything!

Don't get caught in the rain, bring an umbrella."
,,Shopping centres and retail therapy - at a price,3.0,,"Shopping, brands, retail therapy, air conditioned centres and a world of window shopping delights.

Wow, if there is something to buy then Orchard Road will have a shop for it, or at least one that can order it in for you.

Many options here, and depending on your budget, some options may be out of your comfort zone.

We walked only part of the length of Orchard Rd, we visited the information centre and a few shopping centres along the way.

Great food court selections and range or shops on offer. We brought some souvenirs only, left our 'bigger' shop to other districts.

But worth a walk and a browse."
,,The commercial street of Singapore,4.0,,"This is where you'll find almost everything you need. Big brands, cheap ones, banks and everything else! You can pretty much hang out for at least half of the day or maybe the whole day if you are a shopaholic!"

,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,"I live in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Although we have all the designer shops they do not contain clothing designed for the Western woman.I enjoy seeing new collections for the Western markets, and being petit in stature and size,I have no problems finding clothes that fit."
,,Everything!,5.0,,"Orchard road is the main shopping district in Singapore. It has every major store and more in a succession of shopping malls that are of course all wonderfully cool as the Singapore weather is so hot and humid. There are so may restaurants, from very cheap to very expensive but they always had a menu in the window or outside to peruse. Beware though that to walk from one end to the other takes considerable stamina. There are also 24 hour tailors all at reasonable costs. All in all a terrific experience."
,,Famous as it should be,5.0,,"I went here in the evening in early January, all Christmas decorations and lights were still up. It was just beautiful. Lots of people at night time, many shops open until late to look through, easy to find places to eat. No wonder it is famous!"

,,Shopper's paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road is always ready to please any shopper's insatiable appetite. With low to high end shops and malls lining both sides of the boulevard and numerous other shops up to three levels underground, there are plenty of options. Restaurants and food options are only limited your stomach. There is a lot of energy along the whole strip, great place for people watching and sit back to recharge after shopping. Easily accessible via taxi or mrt.

Visit at night for a vibrant orchard road."
,,Great hotel a very nice location.,4.0,,I have stayed at this hotel several times and always look forward to coming back. Great location and great service. Nespresso machines in your room are a nice touch.
,,"It's changed, but not for the better",3.0,,"I spent lots of time in Singapore around 25 years ago and I looked forward to revisiting my old haunts in February 2016. Though Singapore is a wonderful city, for someone who remembered it from the not-so-distant past, some aspects were very disappointing, especially Orchard Road. The amazing swanky hotels are still there but there seem to be more of them crammed in now and the green spaces I remember along Orchard Road seem to have vanished. Even the brilliant hawkers market has gone. If you like shopping, and that's the only real reason to go to Orchard Road now in my view, then you'll love it but, for me, it has lost the quirky appeal it used to have.
Saddest of all, Raffles Hotel now resembles an upmarket Harvester rather than anything Kipling or Conrad would recognise. I guess that's progress though."
,,Lots of looking - not a lot of buying!,4.0,,A shoppers paradise! Designers stores by the bucket load. Great to compare and contrast. Not great prices though. Better prices in other parts of the world.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"A street long showcase of some of the best brands. It's best to know which brands you would like to shop and then visit the stores as there are multiple outlets along the road. Takashimaya, Orchard Central and 313@Somerset are my personal favourites."

,,Shopping Bonanza. Bring your savings!,5.0,,Malls. Lots of malls. I would suggest doing a bit of research before taking a stroll down here.

Albeit it's a huge street street, 2.2km to be precise, there is so much going in you'd need months to cover everything!

,,Never sleeps,4.0,,"we wandered up and down Orchard Road during our visit to Singapore. It is a very exciting road to be on. The shops are spectacular. We were shocked by the number of people on Orchard Road day and night. It is a very pleasant atmosphere and feels very safe. Everybody is strolling along as it is too hot to rush. Go into any of the undergrounds and there is as much below the street as there is above. At one underground station near Marks and Spencers there are 4 more levels of shops.

,,It's a road with malls along it,3.0,,"Some people love shopping...I'm not one of them. Orchard rd does not hold much allure for me. It is crowded and difficult to get from A to B. Most of the shops are nothing special and are available in many other places across the island.

They serve the best chicken Pho at $9 a bowl and after 6 bowls the 7th is free. One evening the whole of Orchard road was closed off to traffic and people were able to relax in chairs on the road and listen to the music being offered. It was lovely to mingle amongst touists and locals and feel part of it.
,,Shopping Road Not Like Before,3.0,,"I have visited Singapore over the last 25 years and find that now Orchard Road is not what it used to be. Specially on a Sunday it's a nightmare to get around the stores and walk on the road. It is just too over crowded and many parts are full of maids and foreign workers. Food courts in many malls are disappointing, crowded and dirty. This road has lost it's original charm."
,,Shopping Heaven,3.0,,You can literally spend hours here shopping of course. I get to have a father-daughter special time shopping with my little girl here. If you're looking for a souvenirs then visit Lucky Plaza but you'll need to bargain for price which I really don't like doing at all and end up spending way too much.

,,The Singapore Road for Shopaholics!,4.0,,"If you are a shopaholic and are looking for a place to have a ball then Orchard Road is for you. This is a road that comprises shopping centre, after shopping centre, after shopping centre - on both sides of the road. You can find Centres that have nothing but the best boutiques in them, such as Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Rolex etc etc. I could go on and on but this would become boring. Ask a taxi to take you to Ion on Orchard and you will be dropped at a reasonably centrally located luxury shopping centre in which you can commence your day of ecstasy!"

,,Great shopping place for branded products,5.0,,This is the best place to shop for branded items in Singapore. You name it and the Brand is available here.

,,Shopping mecca,5.0,,"Orchard road is the heart of Singapore, with a myriad of shops and shopping malls, restaurants and hotels. You can spend an entire day walking up and down orchard road.

,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping",5.0,,A huge variety of shops and malls ranging from designer to brand names but also small local shops. You can find just about anything you need. Lots of souvenir junk!
,,I found that there's more to Orchard Road than shopping.,4.0,,"I agree that most of the shops in the large malls are expensive - at least too expensive for me, however I think that Orchard Road should be looked at in its entirety, and not just from a high end shopping perspective.

Take the time to visit the food courts in the malls and mingle with the locals while enjoying a very reasonably priced, tasty meal.

Wander along the tree line street and stop to buy a $1.20 slice of Walls ice cream wrapped in a slice of coloured bread or placed between two wafers. There are a few of these carts along the street and we found that the nicest, friendliest vendor was the lady with the cart closest to Ion Mall.

Sit on one of the seats that line the street and just watch the world go by. I think that every nationality in the world is represented on Orchard Road.

Whilst sitting, I observed a little Chinese girl break away from her parents and run up to a little Indian girl and take her hand. The families obviously didn't know each other because they appeared surprised at the little girl's spontaneous action, however they all smilingly acknowledged each other before walking off in opposite directions.

Witnessing that little girl's spontaneous gesture of goodwill towards a stranger was a lovely memory that I will take away from my visit to Orchard Road - and it had nothing to do with shopping."
,,Shops,2.0,,"Singapore IS a shopping mall and this precinct houses all the same names as you'll find all over Singapore, replicated multiple times. Add people aimlessly, and frustratingly, wandering all over the sidewalks and this is Orchard Road! A haven for brain-dead shopper types..."

From food to shopping, cheap to expensive prices. It is a very busy roads, but a nice place to see, but your feet must be ready to do a lots of walking. Since then, i never missed going to that place. Every year this place has something good to offer for the tourist....you must be very tired after both feet and your eyes :P"
,,Budget killer shopping !,5.0,,"You want to shop ? You think you have shopped till you dropped ?
Orchard road shopping is not for the amateur, professionals only (read: you better have deep pockets or else treat your wife to a spa day). If you can't find it on Orchard Road, its doesn't exist or its not worth having. The ION Mall is worth the trip just to see how the 1% spend their spare time and then enjoy a really budget friendly meal in the basement food court."
,,Expensive City,4.0,,"Country like Taipei, they have such expensive city around Taipei 101. Similar to Singapore, We call it expensive city because they sell food and stuff slightly overrated than other place and let's not complain because we are at tourist attraction vicinity. Just avoid traveling to Orchard on weekend unless you fancy much the crowds."
,,Not really sure why you'd bother,3.0,,Sure there are loads of shops but everything is super expensive. I can't at all see what all the hype is about. I guess you should go there to see for yourself but be prepared to spend through the nose if you actually buy anything.
,,Shop Until you Drop!,5.0,,"Armed with the tenacity to shop, wallets and credit cards on full credit mode, you may now attack this place! branded shops, modern local-branded stores are evenly spread out in clusters for your shopping enjoyment.

Its fun, enjoyable, relaxing and vibrant and its not just for retail therapy!!"
,,A truly incredible shopping strip,4.0,,For those that love shopping. But i must say it is not as cheap as you would hope but still a must do.
,,"Upmarket feel, not touristy, unless you are interested in shooping",2.0,,"The place certainly has that upmarket feel. The malls are good in number, stuffed with high end stuff. However, there is nothing distinct Singaporean feel for tourists. Orchard street is a regular high street found in other places in the world. Can be skipped if not interest in shopping or have never been to a high street area at least once."
,,The True Heart of Lion`s City,4.0,,"Travelling to Lion`s City for about 40 years Orchard Road district has been always on our mosr favorite activity schedule. Once known as low-price shopping and bargening paradise this bustling area now excels by its posh boutiques, jewelery shops, and purchasing temples for smart designer and fashiojn wear. Besides traditional shopping malls visitors will find here also local food stalls or hawkers on street corners offering mouth-watering small snacks and refreshement particularly during business breaks and lunch hours; but here you will find also locations for most elegant culinry dining and wining all around.
Orchard Road accommodates previously well regarded hotels or night-lodging palaces, however some of which become meanwhile old-established or out of date waiting for face lifting soon. Perhaps new business and entertainment districts such as Marina Bay might outstrip existing business areas soon ?
But what still excels Orchard Road is its very central location nearby well known other tourist attractions thus reflecting the restless and confirmed character of ist multi-cultural inhabitants.

,,Christmas Lights - Simply astounding!!!,5.0,,"We timed our most recent visit to Singapore to coincide with the lighting up of the Orchard Road Christmas lights for 2015. They normal turn these lights on in the middle of November and the remain on until early January. Orchard road is pretty spectacular at this best of times but as you will see in the photos Christmas just adds something more to the experience.

There are many exquisite boutique stores along Orchard road and these offer a vast array of high end products, even if you are not in the market to shop in these store the customer service is very welcoming and the staff are extremely friendly.

We would definitely go back to Singapore just to enjoy the Christmas lights again, if you don't feel the festive spirt after walking through all the lights then you must be hard to please."

Neither me or my wife were drawn initially to this locality, however, having walked through some of the area it is clear that this is a must see location, if not for the shops then for the scale of some of the malls.
We did continue onto our original destination, which is covered in another entry, but should we return to Singapore (which we hope is very likely) then we will definitely return to see what Orchard Road has to offer.
From what we saw, it is a must see location"
,,Bussines Location Road,5.0,,It is a good traffic and clean road. People respect each other. All office bussines building here...
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"A long stretch of shops, more shops and yet more shops. You can find every brand and every possible thing you can think of and probably never thought of. It can get very crowded and busy so if you don't like crushing bodies try weekdays before noon when it is much calmer. There are cafes and restaurants galore for all cuisines, tastes and pockets. Be prepared to pay premium prices in the shops though. Orchard Road used to offer all ranges but in the last few years almost every store is designer and it has lost a little of it's pleasure because of that."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Glad we got to experience the Orchard Road shopping. So much to see and experience.. Although most shops are over priced there are ones that cater for all budgets and its great seeing all the upmarket and designer shops. Great restaurants and food courts here too.

,,For crazy shoppers only,3.0,,"If you are not a crazy shopper, I would suggest you to skip this ""tourist attraction"". There is very similar to Tsim Sha Tsui in Hong Kong.

OK, go for the fun and to people watch or go to spend a small fortune on something special! Tangs, the old Singapore department store on the corner of Orchard Road and Scotts Road (Orchard MRT) is worth a visit and often has good things at reasonable prices and so do some of the malls on the north side of the road but the places on the south side will empty your bank account quickly!"
,,"Shopping, Shopping",3.0,,"This long street is famous for a huge numbers of shops and malls of course. However somewhere you can find more interesting narrow street and interesting places.

Not enough benches to sit along the sidewalks, even the set up stalls sell overpriced soft drinks.

Seems lack of character from other cities around the world. I think too restrictive and not many buskers. People don't seem to have good time. Not many happy faces."
,,"Hotel where I stayed was on Orchard Rd, made the carrying of all the bags much easier.",5.0,,"Nice shopping malls in the area but check prices as I found some things are quite expensive in Singapore. Food halls in basements of Malls possibly the cheapest places to eat and were all extremely clean. Check if shop where you are spending your money offers a tax rebate to foreign visitors which must total $100 or more - all must be bought on same day and all from same store. If you do use this option make sure you are carrying your passport to make a claim, firstly at the shop and then of course at the Sea or Air terminal when leaving the country. A great place to shop and just wander."
,,lots of high end stores... with high end prices,3.0,,"Lots of beautiful stores and shopping, but with the import tax and just overall costs shopping here compared to just shopping back in the United States just made no sense.

This road is very easy to find you just have to get out of the Orchard MRT station and all the direction are there on boards.

Once you get in to the road you can't cross the road in between in most places because they don't have the pedestrian crossing. I this area they have created some underground tunnels to cross the road which we found little bit difficult to locate.

On the corner, just across the road a large Abercrombie & Fitch and opposite the Takashimaya (huge department store)- fun to be there at 10 am when the doors open, all very formal and unusual in Western stores. (I'm told it is very Japanese). Fun to see.
In the Takashimaya mall there are some high end and middle end stores and (Including huge bookstore Kinokunya). One can also walk underground all the way to Ion and Wheelock place (handy when it is pouring down).
Opposite ION is Tangs department store and next to that Lucky Plaza ( & Far East Plaza behind Tangs)- both are the cheaper end stores but good fun malls.

Starting from Tanglin Mall at the top of Tanglin Road near the embassies of UK and USA, the Malls line the road all the way down to the Istana, the official residence of the President of Singapore.

There are too many Malls to list. Famous ones are of course ION Shopping Mall and Nee Ann City and Plaza Singapura which are huge and contains all that you can afford and want to eat.

But some of the smaller Malls are interesting too, like Lucky Plaza where there are many shops catering to foreign domestic workers. Orchard Plaza has many popular bars and lounges if you are so inclined. The Wheelock Place houses a large Marks & Spensers. Orchard Central has the Japanese brand Tokyo Hands. Both Mandarin Gallery and Paragon houses high end boutiques. The Herren has a large Robinsons department store.

Orchard 313 is another mall with a variety of boutiques and eateries. It has a spacious food court on the top floor. Other places foe local flavours are the basements of Tangs Department Store, ION and Takashimaya.

,,Always changing,4.0,,"The main shopping belt of Singapore is always changing. There's always some construction going on somewhere along this long street, with new shopping malls popping up all the time, or barely old ones re-emerging with new face lifts.

,,Pretty much what we expected,2.0,,"After reading a number of reviews we took on Orchard Road. In terms of shopping centres this place is crazy we walked for around 8 hours going down one side and up the other.

After doing our research and finding most centres opened at 10 we were there ready to go however we were very disappointed to see that over half the shops were closed the other half had staff in them but we're not opened.. We then went to the second mall to find the same thing. We did some googling looked at opening times and found they were meant to be open. After doing so much planning we were disappointed at having to wait so long. If we had known we would have re arranged our day.

The shopping centres themselves our lovely there are almost no sales in any stores and you pay the same prices if not more for clothes you could buy at home. It's worth a look but be aware you won't really find anything of good value (we didn't anyway and we went to almost every mall)

We found that Singapore is not the place to shop"
,,Lots of Shops!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a very long road, full of shops and plenty of shopping malls which you can go in! Anything you need, you will be able to find it on this road, especially clothes etc.

Its very nice on a night time, as you can see everything lit up, you can hear the birds in the trees, and various performers are on the street where you can sit and watch magicians, singers and dancers etc.

The only problem I had was using the underpass, there is not enough directions which tell you where to go. As we had to go under the iOn Orchard Mall to get to the otherside of the road."
,,"Shops, shops, and more shops",4.0,,"Exactly what you thought it would be, lots and lots of shops.

There are several malls and they're cleverly separated by how much you want to spend, i.e. the high end malls only have Gucci etc and the other malls have your M&S and H&M stores.

Can't go wrong if you want to treat yourself while in Singapore. This is the place to shop."

,,Shopping Fun!,5.0,,"All along this road are shops and more shops. Seemed to have all the high end shopping as well as service shops.

,,A shoppers dream.,5.0,,"A long road.Plenty of shops,But the ION centre not to be missed.Half of which is underground,shopping not cheap but you might be lucky and come across a sale or two.walk down at night again take plenty of photos,lots of lights.LOts of places to eat,but if you want a cup of tea,you have to ask for milk,which is served separately,and I think maybe recon powder milk.What you will notice is there is no rubbish no beggars,no graffiti,and you feel very safe day or night,Taxis are reasonably cheap and there are also hop on hop off buses 3 routes ."
,,Cool shopping mall,4.0,,"Every one who visited singapore should have visited orchard road, it consists of shopping mall, food hall etc. Even though it is a perfect place to take picture, the shopping mall sell branded stuff, it is a high class mall. But overall it is great"
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"You name the shop theres a great chance there is every chance it is on Orchard Rd, Singapore. The food is amazing, try the "" Soft Shelled Crab "" and there is a whole shopping plaza for the Filipino community called Lucky Plaza. Hotels here aplenty. It is the centre of shopping in Singapore, albeit the high end of shopping, but expect nothing less in Singapore. Their isn't many not knock off shops here, just a lot of money and business people. Great place to take a walk around, and don't forget to visit Orchid Towers for a lunchtime special =D"
,,Loads of shops!,4.0,,Amazing amount of shops selling a variety of wares but check prices carefully. Certain items extortionately priced compared to home. Worth a visit though.
,,Really Clean and beautiful area,5.0,,I stayed at Orchard Road in Hotel Orchard Parade. The street was really Singapore ;) and again it was Christmas time so... a bonus for us. Beautifully decorated Roads and buildings... WOW!
,,Shopping Overload,4.0,,"You name the shop theres a great chance it is here on Orchard Rd, Singapore. The eateries are amazing and there is a whole shopping plaza directed straight at the Filipino community called Lucky Plaza. There are many hotels here aswell. It is the centre of shopping for Singapore, albeit the high end of shopping. You will not find any knock off shops here. Great place to take a walk around!"
,,Nice and trendy,5.0,,This place is a must to visit with all the expensive outlets here. food and drinks at a fare price. mostly English speaking.
,,Don't care,3.0,,Not my scene at all. Lots of clothing and homewares that are available in my home city. So big and exhausting to walk around. I guess if you know what you want and where to get it then at least it's a one-stop-shop but I just felt tired after spending time here.
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Anyone wanting to shop til you drop should go to Orchard Road, endless retail space offering everything from Tiffany to Starbucks and back"
,,Short Visit,4.0,,Clean place with highly organized pedestrian and vehicle traffic.....road signage for the tourists are in easy English.....in fact the whole Singapore is a tourist friendly city....
,,Malls and malls,3.0,,"Not Oxford Street or the Ginza, where shops are at street level. Here many shops are hidden away within malls. The leading brands are on offer, but small mom and pop shops are also present."
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",5.0,,"Excellent shopping facilities. Everywhere is spotlessly clean and tidy. People friendly, lots to see and explore. Air conditioning a great relief from the heat!"
,,World class shopping,5.0,,This main avenue is always crowded with locals and tourists; just about every luxury store is here; also check out crazy underground shopping connected to subway system.
,,"Nice to walk on, very exclusive brands",4.0,,"We liked to walk around and go into the big malls, but buying.... Manolo Blanik, Dior etc. Expensive"
,,Shop till you drop.,4.0,,"Orchard Road one of the shopping heaven in Singapore. Range from High-end brands at ION. Muti label brands at Tangs, Unique Men's wear at Orchardgateway, Awesome food at Mandarin Gallery and Japanese company department store Takashimaya. If you are first time in Singapore do check this place."
,,"High end shops, window shopping, and fooood",5.0,,"One of the places I always go to when I go to Singapore! I always go to ion Orchard and Ngee Ann City or Wisma Atria. There's a huge selection of snacks and food in ion's food hall at B4, or the basement connecting roads of Wisma Atria. A supermarket in Takashimaya basement floor (I like browsing through supermarkets). And then there's a huge bookshop in Ngee Ann City (Kinokuniya). Most of the things may be pretty expensive but I enjoyed the window shopping very much :-)"
,,"Expensive, decent collection and Average",3.0,,"Orchard is amazing to walk upon and has a lot branded and some unbranded stores. The malls are expansive and beautiful . However, the collection is really average. Singapore being one of the foremost hubs of Asia one would expect a collection that is more up to date with the west. We saw the same collection that was available in India. Also, it wasn't cheaper to buy any branded items here. It's the same price as in India or maybe more expensive. Even though we do get the GST refund of 7%, it's really not worth filling your bags with branded clothes from here. Europe would be much better for shopping.
That's just my view coming from an Indian."
,,The place to shop,5.0,,"While Singapore has many shopping areas, Orchard Road has to be among the top....every known chain in the world....all levels of pricing."
,,So easy to get around,5.0,,As a first time visitor to Singapore I was very impressed in their road system and you soon realised when and where to cross meaning both traffic and pedestrians 'flowed'. Flower beds and trees were well maintained and I don't remember seeing any litter.
,,Could be London,3.0,,"Has all the shops you want. Could have been any major city, shopping-wise. Tend to be very top end shops, but there are malls with Billy's-bargain type shops too if you look closely."
,,Great road of shopping and food,5.0,,This is a must go place in Singapore. There is a ton of shopping and food options and nice cars and hotels to stay in this central location.
,,Bad Experience at LE WAY Shoe Store 313@Somerset Orchard Road,1.0,,"Just to share my experience at LE Way (By Limited Edition). So I went to one of the Limited Edition Store today (3/3/16) and I had a terrible experience at LE. WAY 313@Somerset. I just finished my dinner and decided to look for a pair of shoes. I went to the store and one of the staff who was wearing white shirts, shorts and white janoski max and he has also pony tail being very rude, impolite, and disrespectful. At first, I asked if the shoes I found got any discounts since they put it on the floor and next to the 40% tag and he replied me by saying with a mocking tone ""If all shoes got discount this is going to be a flea market."" I was surprised but I didn't say a word about it. I asked bcs someone just asked if the shoes he was holding got any discounts but I didn't hear the rest of the conversation that's why I asked. After he said such ridiculous reply, I kindly ask him if he could get me a pair of the shoes that I held, with my size. So then he managed to get me one and I tried it but unfortunately the shoes is too big, so I asked him to help me with the smaller size. Then he checked on the system and he couldn't find one. And He purposedly told me to get it from the other store in Scape!!! He said, ""That's all we got, and the other one on the floor. You just go to Scape."" And I replied to him that actually it's slightly too big not much but compare to the one I usually use I could feel that it's abit loose. Finally, since he told me to leave and go to the other store, I asked him what is the type or code of the shoes. AND he said with a rude mocking tone to his collegue ON MY FACE, ""THIS GUY KEEPS ON ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND BOTHERING ME!!!! YOU GO ASK HIM WHAT HE NEEDS."" What the heck is that. What kind of customer service LE Way store offers. I actually about to purchased the shoes although it's a bit too big, but with such attitudes I finally left the store and went home not with the shoes but worst shopping experience I have ever encountered. I'm really disappointed with such experience that I got, especially to know that the store is located in the tourist area, how can such customer service behavior is being practiced. I believe Limited Edition management should put this into consideration. I regret that I didn't scold the guy on his face bcs I was so sick at that moment and just wanted to leave the store. I hope you guys won't encountered such experience in this store, but If you unfortunately must face this employee with his attitudes please scold him on his face and give feedback to their management/manager on duty."

The Orchard Road area has some high end shops and some mid price shopping too. The Isetan shopping centre is one of the mid priced areas that we used quite a bit while we stayed in Singapore. Great selection of items an reasonable price. Also, the Isetan has it's own cinemas complex on the top fllor which we went to several times.

The ""Orchard"" MRT station is right at the corner of Orchard & Scotts Roads, so convenient !!"

,,A dream for shopping,5.0,,I would say one of the best shopping in the world. You can find all shops you need here. But the prices were quite expensive for me (exclusive brands cheaper in Sweden). But I was totally loaded with bags when I left for the day and recommend it.
,,The stores are full of the best stuff,5.0,,Everything here is more expensive than in the US. The luxury stores are geared to persons from countries where these items are hard to obtain. There are several Cartier stores with in three blocks. Evidently when the right groups arrive they were lining up out the door. I checked prices at Ferragamo and they were considerably more than the US even after the exchange ..

Even if you don't like to shop, it's worth a visit to the area to admire the sheer scale of the buildings/malls and architecture in the area. Great place to people watch too."
,,Mega shopping and eating with underground links,4.0,,"Orchard Rd is the original tourist area in Singapore. Over the years it has developed into multiple shopping centres, often linked so you don't have to walk outdoors for long. All the usual brands can be found, including many expensive brands. Along with shops comes many great restaurants and eating areas. For visitors, it is often easier to stay at a hotel near orchard Rd. It is very easy to get the mrt, buses or taxis to most places in Singapore . I really enjoy going back to Orchard Rd"

,,A Cross Between Las Vegas and Beverly Hills,5.0,,"We spent three days at a hotel in the heart of Orchard Road. The number of shops and restaurants on Orchard is nothing short of amazing. There are numerous high end shops (like two Prada stores across the street from one another) and several multi story malls stretching for several blocks. At night there are many street performers and apparently it's safe to walk the streets any time of the day or night. If your looking fir good shopping or dining, this is where you want to be."
,,The Feel of Singapore,4.0,,"Just to get the real feel of Singapore, it is a must visit.. there are multiple malls out here and plethora of eating and shopping options.. must go here for sometime even if one does not want to shop"

,,Singapore big high street,4.0,,"If you like shopping, this is the place to go in Singapore. Most of the designer brands are here and some good cafes and restaurants too. I spend quite alot on shopping which i should have done at the duty free airport instead. Overall i did enjoyed myself."
,,Always something new on Orchard Road,5.0,,"As usual, Orchard Road did not disappoint. Spent a couple of days wandering around with my family visiting the big shopping centres and enjoying the Singapore heat. Was very glad that we could basically travel underground after getting off the MRT and we were able to go between the different malls quite easily.

If you have plenty of money, you will enjoy this and if you are on a budget, just take in the sights and sounds and experience the atmosphere, people and Singapore cleanliness.

Great place to spend a couple of hours in Singapore."
,,Shopping Hellven,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a Heaven for shoppers. Luxury brands, all lined up right next to each other, making shopping super convenient. For others, who feel quite inadequate when just getting too close to those malls and shops, the Orchard Road in itself is nice to look at. Separating pedestrians on a super wide sidewalk from the street are tall trees that provide quite a lot of shade on really sunny days (except for noon, obviously). The street is covered with huge decorations depending on the season and there are many seating opportunities for our elders, and stairs leading up to the malls with statues where kids like to run around. There is also a small, but really informative tourist information office with lovely and helpful staff."
,,Has many shopping malls,5.0,,There are many shopping malls with restaurants in this area. There is also a hawker restaurant near concorde hotel.

,,You've gotta go - but once is enough.,3.0,,"The iconic retail strip in Singapore is a must see and do for travellers. You can lose a whole day wandering up and down. There are more shopping centres than you can imagine - most selling high end brands - but be warned its not cheap - virtually the same prices you can find in Australia.
For me it's one of those must do things but I won't hurry back - it can get really busy and there are much better and easier shopping experiences around Singapore"
,,Always!! Must visit!!,5.0,,Always been a must visit place when u go to singapore. Filled up with lots of shopping. N unjust get the feel of excitement when u go to the orchard road. Walk along the road and eat the ice cream selling outside the shopping mall before or after your shopping experiment is a good idea.
,,Just another luxury shopping complex,3.0,,"Singapore has many shopping malls now. So you don't have to go there to shop.

However, if you want to buy cheap souvenirs for your loved ones back home, I would recommend Lucky Plaza. The place was convenient enough for my young toddlers waiting for us (the parents) shop. We bought some small cosmetic bags for $10 for 5 pieces. The fridge magnets was also $10 for 5 pieces. And we also bought some chocolate at Chocolate Station on the second floor. The prices are super cheap, buy do pay EXTRA attention to the expiry dates, because some products wouldn't last longer than a few weeks.

For lunch, if you are craving for Indonesian food, you can go to Ayam Penyet Ojolali on the third floor. Tastes like heavenly-home!"
,,Everything you need,5.0,,"Shopping malls and hotels everywhere, busiest and most crowded MRT station.If you like Pubs go to Orchard Towers. ION;Tangs,Takashimaya, Paragon, Somerset @313 and a lot more for shopping. Isetan, Cathay, Plaza Singapura for Movies....Hawker Centers for affordable meals..."
,,Christmas on Orchard Road,4.0,,The two times I have visited Singapore were both around Christmas time. The lighting display and Christmas decorations on Orchard rd are certainly worth seeing at this festive time of year!!
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,A great stretch of malls offering a wide range of shopping depending on your preference. Paragon & Ion great for branded goods! Locals speak very good English as well.
,,Luxury Shopping at Best,5.0,,If you are a luxury shopper - you'll love this area. If you're looking for a discount - look elsewhere. This is the ritzy fancy area - definitely worth checking out - beautiful tree lined streets and tons of shops stretching a few kilometers.
,,Nice high-end shopping,4.0,,"All the top western brand name stores are here up and down the strip. What we like are all the food courts and cafes. So much to eat. I can shop at any of these stores in any major cities around the world, these good Asian foods is what I'll miss ;-)"
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"This road is full of malls and shopping, restaurants and bars. It is beyond an amazing place, with more of the high end designers located in one area than even in New York or Paris. The main shopping area in Singapore, a definite must see."
,,Street closed for fest,5.0,,Went here and got the street closed for a night fest. We can see the performance of some musician live at the orchard road. So much fun!
,,"It is a shopping Mecca for ladies, gentlemen will find a few things of interest too.",5.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore's main, top of the range, shopping destination.

It ranks alongside, Oxford Street & Regent Street in London, as well as Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and Via Condotti, etc. off Piazza di Spagna in Rome.

There are many shopping malls along Orchard Road, including Wisma Atria, Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya), Paragon, 313 @ Somerset, Orchard Central, Orchard Gateway, iON, Wheelock Place, Shaw House, Tang's Plaza, The Centrepoint, The Atrium at Orchard and other shopping areas.

Even though the top price shops can be found here, there are some areas where you can find cheaper prices for some goods, such as Lucky Plaza.

There are 3 MRT stations on Orchard Road; Orchard (junction of Scott's Road and Orchard, iON, Wheelock Place & Shaw's), Somerset (Paragon, Ngee Ann City, 313@Somerset, Orchard Gateway & Orchard Central) and Dhoby Ghaut (The Atrium @ Orchard).

There are may bars and possibly hundreds of places to eat along Orchard Road.

If you arrive in Singapore for the first time, Orchard Road is a good place to stay (especially if you are with a female partner), you can reach all the other major areas by MRT from here and have an excellent launching pad to explore Singapore.

If (like me) you have visited Singapore for over 40 times, it is still a good area to base yourself."
,,Depends upon what you want to buy,4.0,,"Orchard Road has more shopping malls in one area than I have ever seen I think.
Its okay to have a wander but there are many many high end shops in the malls and along Orchard Road most of which have security on the door which gives an example of the value of goods they are selling. Its not the easiest of places to cross over the road as it has railings all along the main street with underground passes for you to cross. There are a few pedestrian crossings but they are quite far apart so good foot wear is essential and a lot of patience. Like a lot of cities one shopping mall has more or less the same shops in all malls. If you are looking for any bargins I do not think Orchard Road is the place to come,"
,,great place for shopping,5.0,,No shortage of shopping malls and eating places all along this famous road... There are some attractions near by too
,,Main shopping district in Singapore,5.0,,You cannot say you have visited singapore unless you have visited orchard road. It is the main shopping district in Singapore.
,,If you love malla go here,5.0,,"I have never seen so many malls in one area, the street is so long with lovely malls all along, many with the same high end designers stores. Its at least a days visit, more if you have plenty of money to spend. Some flash hotels with malls to. There is also a jamie oliver italian ewtery there."
,,The place to be for shoppers,5.0,,You won't find as many possibilities to shop but here. Bring the large credit card and just start. You will find almost anything and all shopping malls have air conditioning.
,,Busy strip,3.0,,"It took me a while to work out how to get across the road, as in, find an underpass. They were not well signposted. Window shopping in high end shopping becomes tedious, so returned to the apartment and had a swim."
,,Shopping shopping what else,4.0,,you get all the brands in the world and can see very nice buildings. there are plenty of places to eat. when i visted there was an exhibition of mini coopers so there were few modesl parked outside a mall. of cause you must watch an Imax movie in the theatre. dont forget to enjoy ice cream sandwitches
,,Just a shopping area,3.0,,Nothing special. It's has several shopping malls on the road. If you like shopping it's ok. I like the Bugis market area better because it has more local and traditional products. The malls on Orchard Road have the typical western stores in malls around the world and they're expensive
,,Orchard Road Traveller Review,4.0,,"First things first. This is primarily a Shoppers place to go.

Along Orchard Roads length, which is approx. 2.2km is just a plethora of shopping Malls catering for all types of tastes and pockets. From more budget conscious Malls such as Lucky Plaza (popular with filipinos and gets very crowded at the weekends, particularly on Sundays) and Far east Plaza, to places such as Paragon/ION Orchard and Ngee Ann City which houses all the designer shops and boutiques. Eating/restaurants as you would expect are as diverse as well, with many hawker type centres around, along with places such as food republic at the newish 313 Somerset shopping complex, that connects to Orchard Gateway.. Entertainment complexes such as Shaw Cinemas with its IMAX/Cineplex cinemas.

Of course another location which is famous (more for notoriety) is Orchard Towers. This is a collection of bars, clubs noted for some degree of promiscuity, and is a big attraction for singletons from all over Singapore. Not really a couple place.

Emerald Hill is a pleasant watering hole, with a nice number of restaurants and Pubs..the latter tend to be out of the main Orchard thoroughfare so are pleasant to go to, and some of them do 1 for 1 offers until 8 is...well worth it as the standard price of a beer around Orchard is around 16-18 SGD for a pint!

There always seem to be activities going on and around, and its such a pleasant (aside from the crowd at times) environment to shop even guys don't mind the odd hour there or two..!

Of course, Chinese New Year and Christmas time see the area transformed ...amazing decorations, lights, exhibits, figurines...it truly is a pleasure to visit at this time. In terms of MRT access, you can start with Doby Ghaut at the bottom of Orchard Road, and then Somerset (mid Orchard) ending with Orchard Road itself, provide great entry/exit points for visiting. Note, that Somerset and Orchard are large MRT stations, so try and use the signs and match with which road/exit you need. Fortunately, Singapore is great for directions in this sense at its MRTs.

Early Morning are, of course, the quietest, as many shops don't open until 10 or 11 am, so its pleasant to stroll along without the heavy crowds..."
,,Must visit,4.0,,"This is one of the must go to places in singapore, beautifully decorated during the chirstmas month, it has a lot of big brands for all shopping freaks. Easily accesible via MRT and lot of good places to eat and hangout as well."
,,High end shopping,5.0,,"Have never seen such a concentration of high end designers in one space, more concentrated than Paris, good for window shopping, but I'm not so sure about buying---expensive $$$$$$$"
,,"Commercial, yet cultural.",5.0,,"I thought this was going to be just like Leicester or Times Square, but I was always very aware of where I was due to the architecture of the building's (and the weather). It was smaller than I expected and there are other places that offer better shopping in my opinion. But to look at it is visually stunning and if you have the budget you can really go to town here. But in my opinion there is just as good shopping all around Singapore."
,,Orchard Road---Concorde Hotel.,4.0,,"We loved staying in the Concorde Hotel, so near to all places that you want to see in Singapore. Etc Raffles Long Bar(great) City tour, botanical Gardens at night! there is so much to see. we were only there for 3nights and wished we were there longer. We will be back hopefully next year, if so we will book into the Concorde Hotel.It for us was special.."
,,Massive central mall district,4.0,,"This is the central shopping district people come to Singapore for. The mall shops can be quite pricey, but smaller shops in between or inside the smaller malls/outlets have lower prices. It's a very walkable area and great for taking a stroll. Wheelchairs and strollers are put to good use here. Taxis, buses, and the metro are readily available, so need to drive on your own. Be warned though, it can get quite crowded on weekends. Weekdays are the best time to visit.

For less hectic shopping/browsing and strolling, you can head to the west/southwest, within walking distance, to the Tanglin area where malls and outlets are usually less busy, but offer much of the same without the crowds."
,,Some glitzy shopping and food,4.0,,"The Orchard Road MRT station had me buried underneath this place, as it took me time to navigate my way out of the station to the main road. The entire area is lined up with retail outlets and food places (standalone and inside hotels). You could easily burn off calories walking from one end to another - just as how you can 'shop till you drop'.

If you ever come shopping here with someone, let them go while you explore more of this area."
,,Like every other city,3.0,,I was blown away by the number of repeat high end stores; The location is central and the point where a lot of tours start and end; other than that I would not recommend spending a lot of time here!
,,Shopping paradise,3.0,,"If you want to do luxury shopping, this is the place to go. All luxury brands have shops here and there also also a few shopping malls. Don't go on week ends, much to crowded!"
,,High End shopping,5.0,,This road is for high end shopping and has huge malls with top brands froma round the world. We got to see the famous decorations in the night during Christmas. It also has similar decorations during Chinese new year
,,Famous Shopping Street,5.0,,"This Street is so famous at singapore, because here so many branded store with good hotel arround it. There are also some Shopping Mall locate at this street. Here you can find also so many restaurants. Is a must visit to this area if you are in singapore. Mostly it's very crowded at weekend."
,,Love this place,4.0,,"A good place for shopping, eating, or just walk around. There are lucky plaza if you want to look for cheap stuff. Ion mall, Takashimaya department store & other mall if you want to buy branded stuff. Don't forget to buy one dollar ice cream in front of takashimaya shopping centre. Cheap ice cream but always long queue haha..."
,,Huge Place,5.0,,This place is larger than what I expect. Too many malls and shops for me to finish it in a day! Awesome. Also alot of nice food as well.
,,Strolling,4.0,,"I love strolling along the busy streets...going there again next weekend. Window shopping is my favorite of them all.

My friends recently discovered scape and some other cheap finds and we had fun.

Explored food items too.. and we wish go back for some bulalo next few weeks."
,,Festivities 24x7,5.0,,"I have managed to be on Orchard road around Christmas, continuously for the last three years and every time the decor and the festive look steals my heart. In the evenings, the whole place is lit up- high on spirits, fantastic crowd, every type of eateries and coffee shops, it has pretty much something for everyone.

I have been there on during Chinese New Year, other festivals and normal times- Orchard Road never disappoints. No trip to Singapore can be complete without a walk down the Orchard Road"
,,Stroll down Orchid Road,5.0,,"A must whilst in Singapore is to stroll down Orchid Road visiting the underground shopping centres along with the many international shops which line the road. Everything you could want is to be found along this famous road. The ""Hop on hop off""tourist bus stops at one end of the road to enable tourists to stroll the entire length."

,,A small town with connected linkways,5.0,,"It is definitely a great place to shop and dine. If you are in for some photo taking, you can head out along orchard road the pathment just outside ngee ann city, there are often street performances and buskers filling the busy street with music and cheers. If you are into shopping, there are several malls along the road, the most prominent of all is Ion Orchard, followed by wisma atria, takashimaya, somerset 313 and plaza singapura which is down the road. I have been here almost everyday, i work here as a retail associate and i never get bored of window shopping. If you are just here for fun, you can start the day at Orchard MRT station then plan where u want to go as every exits leads to a different mall and you will realise orchard road is small and connected. Try the food republic at level 4 of Wisma Atria. Good food but comes with a price."
,,For shopping maniacs,3.0,,"If you're not a shopping freak, than avoid this area. Nothing apart than shopping malls, haute couture shops,...."
,,Known for Shopping!,3.0,,This place is known for shopping but there are only fancy shops.. nothing very exceptional.. you can find such items at any other place too.
,,You'll end up here.....,4.0,,"I don't suppose that it is possible to go to Singapore and not end up on Orchard Road at some stage.
Either you'll be staying in one of the trade name hotels or roaming one of the many, many ""retail outlets"" that are Orchard Road. Like most experiences of Singapore, the best strategy is to go with the flow. It is of course busy, bustling, cosmopolitan, organised, and amazingly clean! Your experience of Orchard Road will probably depend upon how long you are staying in Singapore - only a few days and you'll probably only spend a few hours en route to one of the ""must do"" attractions - a little longer, and a little less urgency, may see you begin to enjoy yourself, albeit at the risk of some serious spending. It's not an ethnic destination but it could be described as a ""cultural"" one - if you count contributing to the economy as cultural! When the shopping begins to lose it's charm, take the MRT to Chinatown!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,"You can get every thing here, not cheap though, It's a lot of shopping centers as its all in aircon,"
,,Could be anywhere,3.0,,as a confirmed internet shopper this place holds no appeal to me but my wife said close your eyes and you could be anywhere in the world that says enough to me. Same brands and nothing to give you a wow factor
,,Magnificent shopping promenade,5.0,,"It is wide, green, very well kept. Shops are everywhere and mostly expensive, though you may find cheaper options to buy (or eat). Interesting small street off the main thoroughfare with meticulously restored old buildings."
,,Just more fancy shops,3.0,,I was disappointed. It's just more of the same that you see in any good airport these days! I found the maze of floors difficult to navigate. It's not intuitive. On the plus side I had some delicious pork dumplings from the food hall. I must admit I can't see the point of designer labels so this influences my opinion.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,If you are a shopaholic or simply enjoy a little retail therapy then Orchard Road is the place to be. There are so many shops and eateries that it is hard to choose. Caters for high end as well as budget shoppers. Wear flat shoes you will need them.

Best of all the shopping malls here are mostly LINKED by aircon walkway."
,,Prepare your wallet !,5.0,,"If you are into shopping, crowded places, fancy brands, here will be paradise for you. If you are not into this sort of ""big city"" environment, you could just hop into one of the sight seeing buses around and just have a quick look. It is worth nevertheless."

,,Yeah $$$,4.0,,"We stayed close to Orchard Road and went wandering to explore the famous street. The underground passes are tricky to navigate, it's easy to get lost. Many ways to park your cash here from luxury retailers to middle of the road. What did I buy? Nothing...."

Our favourite city straight on !"
,,over priced richville area,2.0,,miles and miles of Bling Bling Bling - so expensive - so showy - worth a look but don't waste too much time there if you are not a hard core shopper. the visitor centre is EXCELLENT!!!
,,Lots of empty designer shops,4.0,,"Walked down Orchard Road a few times as our hotel was situated at the top, always makes me laugh when I see hundreds of the so called designer shops (Gucci, Prada) and they are always empty with one handbag on display, but I guess one sale will give them their days takings. A good thing is that their is an even bigger subterranean world underneath the road full of even more designer shops, sometimes 4 stories down with links to the underground. There are places to eat and best of all its air conditioned and a good retreat from the heat up top, all shops and eateries are overpriced when compared to shops no too far off the beaten track."
,,Orchard road,5.0,,"The easiest way to reach orchard road is MRT Orchard road station which is in the heart of orchard road. Far east plaza is a good place to buy relatively low price items, Food court there is good too. There is a fantastic mall in the underpass going to Scott's road. There is a duty free mall on Scott's road.
Overall an amazing place for a wide variety of shopping experience."
,,Lots of shops and malls,4.0,,"This road is the place to go if you want to go shopping as the whole street is filled with shopping malls and stores. Some are cheaper than others but you can pretty much find what you need in one of these stores. Its quite a long street so there are lots of stores to browse. In terms of food, the food courts of each mall are quite standardised in terms of types of fare to be offered and the standards are not bad. Decent places to eat and its very clean (as expected).

There are other better places to shop around the world but in Singapore this would be the place to go to."
,,Best road,5.0,,The main road of SG. All types of shopping. Gorgeous especially at Christmas and Chinese new year time.
,,"Shopping, shopping",4.0,,"A wide range of shops - from affordable to expensive - await you here. Air conditioned centers along the road (like iON or 313@Somerset) drain your wallet :-)

,,The Heart of Singapore,5.0,,"A shoppers paradise. Everything under the sun you could possibly want. Multi-level malls, specialty shops, ultra high end emporiums, and every type restaurant imaginable. Great place for a stroll or to sit and people watch, especially on the week end."
,,Should suit all types of shopping,4.0,,"2 Kilometres of shopping. Top end (Tanglin Road) down to the middle has mant malls and many designer shops etc. Impressed by the different types and numbers of childrens shops within the malls, linked with nurseries. As well as shops there are plenty of eateries and coffee stops. Can be frustrating waiting at pedestrian lights. Road traffic is one way down Orchard Road from Tanglin Rd end. Watch out for the smaller more localised shops where tailoring is to the fore."
,,Looks like a window shoppers paradise.,5.0,,Stylish designer shops in lovely malls in a compact area; so many shops and beautiful works of art on open display. There are so many designer shops (window shopping for us) but also mid range and others. Stunning eye opening experience.
,,An amazing country to visit,5.0,,"It has been almost twenty years since my last visit here and how things have really changed,when you arrive at Changi airport which in my opinion is the best in the world,one hardly spends any time going through Immigration and Customs,and straight on to the train to the heart of the city,you have a number of places to stay in Arab Street as a budget traveller,avoid at all cost the Shophouse guest house not good value for your money. Singapore is a costly country to visit so think before you lodge in the first instance,lots of coffee shops and places to eat try Subway around the corner for a good sit in meal and make plans to visit this amazing place on foot or train you will enjoy avoid the midday as it gets very hot late afternoon is a good time"
,,Shopping Madness,4.0,,The street is full with malls and all the major brands around. Not possible to visit the whole street at one go. Take more time to enjoy the shopping experience. Crowded and nicely decorated.
,,"Shopping Paradise, check out the view from Ion",4.0,,"Perfect place to shop, everything from high end shops to regular stuff. If you are true blue shopaholics then it will properly take a few days to finish the whole road.
What I would recommend is to go to ION Orchard, there is a free viewing gallery at the top level which gives you a decent view of the city. Explore away :)"
,,Shopping !!,5.0,,"As we live in Bangkok, prices are more expensive in Singapore. But more luxury brands and a different experience, different brands."
,,Shopping central!,4.0,,"If you haven't been to Singapore before then Orchard Road is where all the main shops are, often housed within vast malls. Great place to go shopping, although it can be overwhelming so have an idea of what you want! There are plenty of food outlets for a break. Ideal for a rainy day as the malls are interconnected underground so you never have to venture outside if you don't want to."
,,Christmassy Awesomeness,4.0,,"Spent 2 evenings here Xmas 2015. Fantastic atmosphere with awesome Xmas lighting and most of the Malls and streetfront shops supporting the festive season. Great place to people watch, drink coffee, eat, see buskers, and of course is convenient for public transport."

,,Great place to shop if that's what you want.,4.0,,"All the world brands in one place never seen so many LV shops as their are in Singapore. This road is full of arcades to suit all tastes , and the road and surroundings are scrupliacly clean. At night it's just like Dubai, New York and Vegas full of bright lights. A must for shopoholicks. One thing to say it's not cheaper than any other city perhaps more that most and you only get the 7% GST back on big amounts and and if you claim it back at the airport."
,,great shopping destination,4.0,,very convenient and easily accessible plus plenty to shop and dine. every year we visit orchard area and never feel disappointed.
,,Do it early before it gets hot,4.0,,Nice tree covered walk. Lots of shops and plants to see. Must do early as when hot it is a chore to walk. Goes right by a couple of malls.

,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Walking around this street you will find huge shopping malls, restaurants, and hotels. It was pretty crowded and great decorated. A must visit place."

,,good for shopping,3.0,,you can enjoy your shopping but it was crowded. i spent one day at orchard but nothing to do and to see. only shopping haha
,,Always too many people,3.0,,"I've never really understood the obsession with Orchard Road. Yes there are plenty of shops, but there are also far too many people - and that can really detract from the quality of the experience. If I do actually have to buy something I'll usually try and go somewhere less crowded."
,,Not so fun for me....,3.0,,"Even though a hype was created about this street, I could not enjoy it, as it was all expensive with branded shops all around."
,,"If you love to shop, it's the place to go",4.0,,"I'm not a big shopper, but this street is filled with everything you could possibly need or want. I recommend investigating the shops you may want to visit before you go, because once on the street, it's hard to know which shops are in each mall - it's not one big centre."
,,If you are looking for upscale shopping and crowds of weekend young people...,4.0,,"Our hotel was on Orchard Rd, which made for easy access to SMRT stations, but crowds of young people on the weekends are a problem. It's hard to find a pharmacy (there are two in the Paragon shopping center), but if you need a Rolex this is the place. To be fair, if you go inside one if the MANY multi-level shopping centers, you can find practical items like shoes, socks, shirts, etc. Many, many restaurants. On weekends I'd avoid the Orchard Rd SMRT station, and use the Somerset station instead. The wall-to-wall crowds of young people blocking the sidewalks around the Orchard Rd station make walking almost impossible. No worries about crime, just masses of young people hanging out on Orchard Rd."
,,"Shop, shop shop",5.0,,"Just a great big shopping centre, with many speciality centres running off. Great food malls, would recommend. Number 5 bar for a cold beer after a long days shopping, all centres air con. It's a Singapore must do."

""follow the yellow brick road, follow the yellow brick road""... this is where you take Toto for a walk and explore the enchantments of 2.2 kilometres of shopping. The adventure will have you discovering the delights of this incredibly clean city... that is a commercial wonder. It has all of the glitz and glamour of any of the major cities worldwide..."
,,No paradise for me,2.0,,"I didn't expect to find anything to buy in Orchard road after shopping in Kuala Lumpur, where most prices are reasonable, so it wasn' t a disappointment. I do though wonder why this would anymore be called shoppers paradise. If you have the means and desire to shop at world brands such as Chanel, Vuitton, Tiffany's, a more upmarket location for example Marina Bay Sands would be a pleasure compared to this tired looking stretch of road bathed by constant tropical showers. The buildings don't look atractive enough to enter, I had to look twice to find the new Ion shopping center, which didn' t either have any architectural character indoors. I had an expensive lunch, mainly mayonese on salad leaves in TCC, which at first looked wellcoming with white wrought iron furniture."
,,glamourous,5.0,,this has every glamour shop you would ever wish for but deep pockets required as it s a massively wealthy area
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,Area filled with Shopping malls and famous luxury brands and hotels. Worth visiting Orchard Road during Singapore visit. Visiting this place is the evening is recommended. Public transport connectivity is also pretty good.

,,Shopping,4.0,,"If you stay in Nostalgia, to go to this place is just less than 30 minutes by bus which is available just in front of the hotel. Ask the hotel staff the bus number to take and in coming back. They will be so happy to help you out."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Good for those who like to shop Nothing new but lots of shops The only issue is the hot sun and humidity
,,Shoppers and strollers paradise,5.0,,"A walk along Orchard Road is a great way to explore Singapore. There is more retail square footage here than I ever imagined, and love that you can walk at street level and below ground to explore it. Further up the road we strolled by the British High council HQ and lovely homes with gardens, and could see so many fantastic high rise buildings in a variety or architectural styles. LOVED IT!"
,,This is just a luxury shopping strip,3.0,,"It is nice to visit if you have lots of shopping to do and lots of money to spend but if I was a tourist here with only 4 days to visit, I would definitely visit other landmarks"
,,Great shopping area,5.0,,The shops compare to Rodeo Dr in California and are beautiful and the road is spotless! Great for an afternoon out
,,Not impressed,3.0,,"Took the missus here telling her if you can't buy it here, it doesn't exist. Mind you I hadn't been here for 25 years and more. Moving on, this is very high-end shopping, like 5th Avenue, New York. Nothing has prices on it. I suppose if you have to ask for the price, you cannot afford it :-),,, going to Bugis Street, I think shopping there will be more to my budget."
,,Central in Singapore.,5.0,,"Many shop and restaurant in this area. I think every visitor will go this place. So it is busy. I have eat pancake, it was so good. But I forgot the name of shop. There is in the middle of Road. Please seek and enjoy it."

Do come around May, you will shop till your pants drop. Singapaore Great Sales. (normally in the month of May). There are good restaurants around this area too, some even a Michellin Stars Resto.

,,Heart of the Garden City,5.0,,Orchard Road is the epicenter of Singapore. It's nice to go for a night stroll and watch free public performances. Watch out for birds' poop. They abound in the garden cum concrete jungle. Surprising to see and hear flocks of small birds on trees at the busiest part of the city.
,,Shopping PLUS,5.0,,"Yes this is a shoppers wonderland, but more than that it is a day out for the whole family.
There are up market clothing shops but there are also shops that interest the younger family members. Taking the younger ones, be sure that they are used to walking long distances as Orchard Rd is a long road and if you intend to do both sides, then you will get your daily exercise for sure. I did not find a lot for the senior age bracket but the interest of what is available and the atmosphere of the area makes for a good day out with numerous food and drink shops to enjoy.
When I lived in Singapore (over 30 years ago) there was a very popular night market in Orchard road but I have no knowledge as to whether this still functions
If you have not explored the airport in full, don't miss this experience either

I am sure, if you are actually a shopping lover the shopping itself can be very nice (malls were all almost empty) but I just found it stressful and too much of everything (people, blinking lights, shops, ...)."

I knew Orchard Road when it had shop houses and open drainage ditches , and when dear old Lucky Plaza was the last word in freshly built modernity . Now Orchard Road has grown up , and even started showing its age in parts . But the vibrant bustle of Singapore life is still there ... and the Food Hall in the basement of Lucky Plaza remains as irresistible as ever for me . Stroll down Orchard Road , drop into the many newer , smarter , malls , and savour the feel for living that Singapore gives one ."

,,Expensive But Worth The Experience,4.0,,Good for a look but make sure you are prepared to spend.

It still has the lower end cheaper shopping Malls and in recent years have gone up market with high end Malls. It is always alive and if you get a chance to be there at Christmas it's even better.

,,Very Enjoyable with tons of variety,4.0,,"Its like the Oxford street of London. Shopping, Malls, Great restaurants with varieties of cuisines, whether posh or fast food like KFC and Pizza Hut, Convenience stores, Souvenir stores,, Groceries, the works.

,,Busy interesting,4.0,,"Orchard Road has many fascinating shops. There is one to be wary of a that is the Cold Stone Icecream shop. EXTREMELY expensive- beyond belief and the staff are not that friendly, the Icecream is nothing out of the ordinary either. Better place is next to the Cold Stores in the basement at Takashimaya centre. An interesting foodie place.
Lucky plaza is still interesting. High tea at the 2nd floor coffee shop in the Paragon centre is great value. Spices Restaurant in the Concorde restaurant especially the seafood banquet is wonderful value for money as well as being exceptionally good, staff are extremely pleasant and capable."
,,Average,3.0,,"Do not know what the fuss is about it is just a street full of expensive shops, catered for rich and famous who don't care about money, found loads of other places where prices are reasonable and better.. nice area to walk around but not to shop."
,,Multinational paradise,3.0,,Not my taste in shopping as very crowded at weekends. Popular with locals seeking D & G and Gucci. All the brands you can buy elsewhere plus some rundown malls. Better shopping in Suntec and Plaza Singapura.
,,Average Shopping Area,3.0,,"This road it's so famous for shopping, but it seems to me it's a bit more a showroom than a real shopping area. A lot of people hanging around but not many of them buying nothing. And prices are too high."
,,Endless days of shopping!,4.0,,"Had the luxury of staying at one of the central hotels in Orchard Road and we did not regret it at all! Always crowded from morning till late night, a massive variety of shops, boutiques, malls, supermarkets etc. Driving on the road may deceive you to think that orchard is just a strip of luxury brands, but there are hidden gems within malls such as ION, Somerset @313, Wisma Atria, Wheelock place, lucky plaza and SCAPE."

,,$$$ but worth spending the day!,4.0,,"Amazing variety of shops & malls. Very expensive but lovely. The New Year decorations are stunning. The were some sales for items we were looking for so happy with our purchases.

,,Amazing at Christmas,4.0,,"The streets are lit up with LEDs and trimmings...the only place in Singapore you'll find the Christmas spirit in Singapore in December. In other months, it's still busy, especially int he afternoon and into the night, Some great places to eat, and great for brand shopping (true brands, not replicas). Pricey but great for those who have a big budget."
,,Christmas at Orchard Road,4.0,,"If you think that Christmas is festival of western people, you haven't been to Orchard Road on Christmas eve. All malls and shopping complexes full of decorations, whole road will be lit with of christmas trees. It appears more commercial and warmth is much less that what you experience in Europe but still Orchard road is worth a visit.
On any other days it will be full of crowed, bustling with shopaholics, working class of Singapore and travellers around the world. Mandarin Orchard, Somerset, Takashimaya mall etc. are the places worth visit. Take a leisure stroll on this road and you'll find something new everyday."

,,Extensive range of luxury shops,5.0,,"Singapore is famous for its shopping and Orchard Rd is the place to be for all the high end luxury shops. They all conveniently located on the the Orchard Rd strip - ""shop till you drop"" with the extensive variety of luxe items all there if you can afford them. The ladies with the need to upgrade their bags and jewellery or just to see what is the latest fashion, it is all there waiting to be snatched up. The men have access to the latest and greatest fashions as well, but the cars that can be hired or purchased are all there, very accessible and at our disposal as long as you have the money. Lamborghinis, Ferraris etc - they are all there and so many of them. Just a note on the maximum speed in Singapore - it is only 90km/hr so if you think you ard going to fly on the road, it probably won't be in Singapore."

Tourists from all over the world could be seen shopping . Highly safe area at all times of the day or night. A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Expensive shops,4.0,,Still with the expensive arrays of brands which we were not interested. We enjoyed walking down the road and ate $1 ice cream (which is now more than $1). We just missed the xmas decorative ambient but we get to see a bit of chinese new year decorations that were already up.

I did enjoy the views and the friendliness of the people in singapore and them speaking good english is a plus for tourists from all over the world."

Shops galore and you will find everything here. We were here for Xmas and the decorations ON the street, BY the street and everywhere was just gorgeous and colorful and vibrant.

,,The best place to stay and shop and eat and walk and etc!,5.0,,"This is what I call the center of Singapore. Many hotels from the Mandarin to the Holiday Inn and even cheaper hotels. The shopping here is tired from America incredible both side of the street up and down From Takashimaya to Robinsons the Department Store to everything else.

,,Totally blew our minds!,5.0,,"The first time you experience Orchard Road by night with its glamourous array of shopping brands, fancy lights and atmosphere - it will truly amaze the senses. The lively atmosphere took me back to World Expo 88 in Brisbane. It is upmarket and I'll admit we didn't buy much, but just to walk through the street is a thrill. We took photos with the famous Tang Plaza and of course the 'out-of-place' Royal Thai Embassy."

I must say no one does it quite so well as store layout, variety and choice is amazing and don't forget to check out all the food courts, cafes and resturants in these centres. Just keep in mind that Orchard Road comes alive around 10/11am in the morning to late at night.

Also, make sure you buy an Ice Cream Sandwich from the carts on Orchard Road. They have around 10 varieties of Ice Cream in which is made in slabs and a thick piece is cut of your desired flavour and added to a piece of sweet bread. On a hot humid day there is nothing better and at $1.20 for an Ice Cream Sandwich you will be back to try every flavour."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"I have now been here seven times. Upmarket shops. However, the prices are very expensive. I was recently here again in January 2016. Many shops advertising 50% discounts for after Christmas Sales. Jeans - advertised 50% off - the price tag showed 89.95 - so with 50% off that is a fair price. However, when I enquire that price is with the 50% already taken off. Food and drinks are also very expensive. A bottle of water was $4.40. They say it is a clean City, maybe for an Asian City it certainly is, but overall still not that clean."

The throngs of people on Orchard Road was mind boggling and I was amazed at the fact that no jay walking takes place. People stand at the intersections and wait for the lights to change and then, boy oh boy, the masses march. There are very few places where one can cross the street but at the intersections there are underpasses which bring you straight into the many Shopping Centres along the Road. It is a shoppers paradise as every brand you could possibly dream of is available.
During the period we were there the Christmas lights adorned the street and shopping centres, each one more enticing than the next. On 2nd January a large section of Orchard Road is closed in the evening to vehicles and thousands of people walk in the road to admire the Christmas lights.
Orchard Road is a ""must""when visiting Singapore, but be warned.... take your credit card...."

Central location
Easy access to transport ( taxi or subway)

Window shopping
Real shopping is for people with deep pockets as street is lined by designer shjops for clothes or watch. Big malls are paragon, takashimaya, and independent styores like isetan, tangs and Robinson. Although sales were going on the prices were not enticing enough.
The road was decorated beautifully for Christmas and new year"

The festive lights this year were nice but were let down by the surrounding lights at ION, Tangs and Takashimaya. Had the festive lights at ION, Tangs and Takashimaya been good, it would have made the overall Christmas lights along Orchard Road be great.

Its magical specially during Christmas time with all the light and the decorations which keeps adding up through the night.

OMG, you cannot cross the road to get to the main mall, the main mall actually consists of several interconnecting malls and they all join up underground at basement level.

Orchard road has been all well known as shopping haven.

,,The place to shop,4.0,,"It must have cost a fortune to decorate this road for Christmas and it certainly attracted the crowds, myself included
There was huge crowds there on boxing day 26/12.I visited the largest mall in Singapore where there was an atrium sale. Once you chose your item,you had to wait 30 minutes to pay as there was only 3 people as cashiers, with lines of more than 30 people

A very lively street with performances at few street corners. Those were very entertaining for kids. Orchard road is home to a large number of malls. Ion orchard is my personal favourite. Several good restaurants to dine at as well. Paragon mall has some really good restaurants. Plus several cafes and coffee shops for a break from retail therapy. This street is any shopaholics dream and simply cannot be missed on any trip to Singapore.
,,Australian travellers,5.0,,Shopping! And more shopping! This area has all you could want in the way of shopping Centres catering for the low to the high end of the market. Some of the smaller shops will entertain bargaining but the bigger retail stores are fixed price. Easy to get to via MRT or bus and always busy. Good food outlets.

,,Retracing previous visits to Singapore,5.0,,"The legendary Orchard Road was dressed nearly end to end for Christmas last week, with lights and enormous Nutcrackers. If you're staying in Singapore over Christmas, it is definitely worth an evening walk around if not for that reason alone! There are still bargains to be had in the plazas, I do query the camera shop guy who tried very hard to get me interested in a Canon (Wrong brand!) P&S when I'm toting an example of Nikon's FF technology. His time to waste! Easy MRT ride, all the big brands as well tiny little stores with bargains."
,,"EXPENSIVE SHOPS, DIFFICULT WHEELCHAIR ACCESS",3.0,,We got off the hop off bus near the crossroads by the Tang mall and could not find a way across the street with a wheelchair. There is an underpass but we had to use the crossings which took us to the opposite side of the street to this mall. The barriers prevented us from crossing where we wanted to do. Lots of expensive shops that you can find worldwide. Wanted to stop somewhere for a drink as it was very hot but everywhere seems to have steps up or down.

,,Mall after mall after mall,4.0,,"If you've come to Singapore for shopping, then Orchard Road is your prime destination. There are too many stores among blocks and blocks of shopping malls to count, so if you're looking for it, it's probably here. Go during the Christmas holidays to marvel at the lights covering the entire area.

The MRT has two stops on the red line: NS22 Orchard and NS23 Somerset. Orange and purple lines can transfer to the red line at Dhoby Ghaut.

And if you're planning to spend big bucks, don't forget to ask for a tax refund receipt from the stores and bring it to the refund office located at the airport or cruise terminal."
,,A bit overrated,2.0,,"Orchard road is somewhat overrated in my opinion although I did make a purchase. The stores generally are at the top end of the market and expensive unless you are really into designer labels. The underground mall-linkage is great and there are plenty of food outlets but, for me, it doesn't live up to the hype. That said, check the Singapore tourist office on Orchard Road. The folks here are simply first rate and a wonderful resource for planning and booking any of your touristy stuff."
,,Too much!,3.0,,"Of course it's kind of convienient that there are so many shops on one street. But this was really too much for me. Endless street with malls after malls. This is a legend, but really, if you're on short vacation, don't spend your time here: it's just shops! And most of them can be found anywhere in the world. It's legendary to shop here, but there is so many better things in Singapore than this but still Singapore is known for this. What a shame..."
,,Shops shops shops!,5.0,,"Don't really know what to say except if you need to buy something you will find it there! Shopping mall next to a shopping mall in an endless fashion, all beautiful, new and with customer in mind. In the middle of the road you will even come across a bit of old Singaporean culture when you find the Emerald Hill."
,,Great shopping and Christmas lights!,4.0,,There is no better place to see the most amazing Christmas lights than orchard road. Well worth a visit and there's so many great shops on the road too!
,,Best Places for Shopping and hang out,5.0,,"The best place for Shopping, Tangs, Paragon, Takashimaya all international brands, named all are there, fast food, fine dining, Western, Europe, Chinese, Japanese, India, Indonesia, Korea and many more. What ever pop up on your head, all are here, the path along the way was so convenient. Millions people's from all over the world with different types of culture and fashion, very interesting for our eye and never feel bored. Many garden long chair a long way of orchid road, when feel tired just take a sit for while and enjoy the natural fashion show of Singapore,
MRT stations point are almost at all corner. Super convenient. Salute for Singapore especially orchid road the best icon of Singapore"
,,Excellent for shopping or just having a walk,4.0,,"It is as many have pointed out a shoppers paradise. However, if you are free at night do take a walk down this road, the malls are so well lit and decorated you will love it. Lot of places to grab quick bites as well."
,,High end stuff,4.0,,"Just go there for buying high end brand bag, fashion and accessories. Most of the 4 - 5 stars hotel are located in Orchard area. Few large shopping mall nearby. Can almost spend whole day there for shopping. Just get off the Orchard Station on the red line."
,,Shopaholics Paradise!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the perfect place to shop til you drop! It is easily accessible direct from the airport or from any hotel in downtown Singapore. Shoppers will find a long line of endless shopping malls lining both sides of the famous street, ranging from low for the budget conscious; to high end with designer boutiques. There is something to be found for everyone.

So get a comfortable pair of shoes ready and of course your credit card! Most shoppers are dressed casually in tee-shirt and shorts, as the weather is hot and humid. Most shops don't open until 10am (some even at 11am) and will close around 10pm....open daily from Monday through until Sunday, with weekends being very crowed.

Orchard Road is clean, modern and safe with lots of lovely eateries, for shoppers that need to rest and refuel. Expect to easily spend all day shopping and don't expect that you will make it up and down the entire street in one day, unless you have super-powers!"
,,All in one place,5.0,,Convenient area to walk around. Main activity has to be mall hopping. Definitely visit Ion Orchard (food selection at the food court is great!) and Wisma Atria
,,Shopping paradise?,5.0,,"A quick visit only, lots of beautiful shops with lavish decorations. Awesome, I was truly amazed. You could spend a week and still not be able to see it all. Christmas sales had also begun. Loads of people shopping and dining. Eventually, did not buy anything but only to watch was in itself a pleasure."
,,Christmas lights and shopping,5.0,,"Love the hussle and bustle of this strip. Easily accessible from buses to train stations (MRT Somerset and MRT Dhoby Guart) and along the tourist trails. There's over o dozen malls here and they are all open late (usually 9pm I think, and seem to be longer at Christmas)
The lights outside are incredible and there's even fake snow (foam) at the entrance to one of them.
Lots of eaterys too.

,,Always interesting,4.0,,"Whenever I visit Orchard, it's usually during Christmas, so the decoration of every shop are very excellent, lighting and music are along the road.

Last time I visit Orchard, this December 2015, I found so many street attractions, sometimes I feel it entertaining but sometimes I feel it so annoying, because when people are stop watching their attraction its quite messy and hard to walk through them."
,,Christmas lights,4.0,,"We enjoyed the Christmas lights and bustling ambiance here on the Sunday before Christmas. There are lots of high end shops and it was really busy. There were also lots of pavement activities and free events on offer.

We hardly visited any shops - although there everything imaginable, especially up-market names, is available - so can not comment on the prices."
,,Convenience,5.0,,"We have stayed an may places around Singapore but always end up coming back to Orchard road. It's not only good for the shopping, but there are many food options and jumping on the SMRT to anywhere else is also convenient.

A highly recommended place to stay when visiting Singapore."
,,Note: Major labyrinth/shopping scene even below street level,4.0,,"A brief guide to some major shopping malls:

Ion Orchard - mid to high-end shops are located from the basement floors up to the ground floor. Luxury retailers occupy the remaining floors from the ground floor up. For food, there are a few good Chinese restaurants on the top floor. More affordable food outlets are at B4.

**Head to Ion Sky (entry at top floor) to get an almost 360deg view of Singapore & even Johor Malaysia (free admission from 3-6pm)

Ngee Ann City - best known for its department store Takashimaya. A large variety of food options here especially with the Food Hall/Food Court on the ground floor near the indoor fountain & a supermarket (Cold Storage). Also houses a major bookstore, Kinokuniya.

313@Somerset - pretty mid-range here with several clothing and sports wear outlets. Also serves as a major meeting/smoking area. A major food court (Food Republic) is on the top floor.

Orchard Central (O.C.) - a more indie shopping mall with more independent retailers & outlets just like its neighbour, Orchard Gateway. Also comes with an interesting rooftop garden (though with less breathtaking a view)

Tang's - Singapore's very own high-end department retailer."
,,Shop till you drop!,4.0,,This is the place to go if you want the latest Hermes Bag or a pack of 1 for 3 socks. Multiple malls that suit every budget and tastes. Needs an entire day or more to look around and explore..
,,Shopper's paradise,5.0,,"great place for shopping , there is something for everyone here. If you are a shopper you can easily spend a whole day here. I loved the Christmas decorations along the street , was really a spectacle to behold and great for pictures."
,,A large well decorated road of shopping malls - nothing special,3.0,,"Everybody talks about Orchard road, and yes there are the large shopping malls that seem to compete for which one is most impressive. But mostly those are all the same international brands that can be bought in all major cities. The most distinct shopping mall seems to be Tangs, it has at least some local items and character. But altogether there are more interesting places in Singapore to visit for a tourist with limited time - Marina Bay, Botanical Gardens, Gardens By the Bay, Singapore Zoo, Clarke Quay why would you trade all that to go to a street of shopping malls even if it has some Christmas (or other seasonal) decorations?"
,,A Party Over Christmas Holiday,5.0,,"Decorations strung over the road...decorated trees and festive music and street performers make this the BEST place to celebrate Christmas ( besides Germany, of course)! People of every religious persuadion seem to enjoy the fun..,Last night we wete lucky to see you g people from Indonesia perform their song and dance depicted the history of their country,,,,.just beautiful,

As Western societies are outlawing "" Merry Christmas,"" as a politically incorrect thing to say, Singaporeans of all beliefs and cultures don't seem to mind it a bit....Everyone is just having some fun."

,,Great for shoppers but not much else for me,3.0,,I'm not the biggest fan of Singapore as I find it too lacking in Asian character. If you like shopping and getting all the high street or high end brands then you'll love it but it's not for me.
,,"Lively and as always , a pleasure",5.0,,"Orchard road is One of Singapores defining shopping streets and arguably one of the top 10 shopping streets in the world. It is lively , vibrant and a wonderful place to be at to get to see the heart of Singapore ."

We went in late November so all the Christmas decorations were lined along the street. Beautiful with lots of Christmas trees. Shopping is expensive along here so we just window shopped. Avoid lucky plaza if you are buying a camera. They tried to rip us off. Check prices before leaving home. It is a must see. Singaporeans love to shop.
."
,,Main Shopping Street,4.0,,"Shops, shops, shops along the street. Mecca of Singapore shopping with access to a bunch of major dept stores (e.g. Takashimaya, EON.) Personally prefer to shop around at air-conditioned complex with cool air."
,,Classy shopping,5.0,,"We stayed in the middle of the Orchard Road shopping area and enjoyed exploring the amazing luxury shopping malls. The whole length of Orchard Road was decorated for Christmas- amazing in the day time, but stunning at night. It was lovely to see all the children having their pictures taken with giant reindeer, enormous Christmas Trees and pastel lit snowmen- not to mention the adults- it was some show. We explored Peranakan Place which was off Orchard Road- a row of old terrace houses. Many of these are converted into very trendy and atmospheric bars- a bit of old world Singapore in the middle of the retail hub of the city. Further back from Orchard road these old shop houses had been converted into beautiful houses- obviously a wealthy precinct."

,,Very good shopping experiences except crowded in weekend and holiday time.,4.0,,Been to Orchard many many times since youngsters time with all kinds of choices and shoping experiences.

There was no shortage of shopping opportunity ,all the famous high end brands but no bargains,Singapore after all is not a cheap destination.There are plenty of places take find a meal,the usual food malls and some nice pubs near the tourist information building.With two MRT stations servicing Orchard Road is is a cinch getting there."

,,Research beforehand,4.0,,"ION Orchard was great mall to visit and shop. In Singapore, i have found that the rabbit warrens underneath most shopping centers give the greatest of pleasure.

,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,Awesome place to shop around. Multiple Multinational Brands mixing along with some local brands. Perfect location to shop around.
,,Soulless temple to consumerism,2.0,,Vast array of glossy air conditioned malls full of middle and upmarket retail chains. You will search in vain for any quirky or original shops or any bargains. Could be anywhere in the world.
,,Happening place,5.0,,"We strolled down Orchard Road several times as we were staying nearby for 5 nights.

Even if you are not shopping it is a fun place to walk on both during the day as well as night."

,,Orchard Road at Christmas 2015,5.0,,"I like to go to Orchard Road the shopping paradise of Singapore especially at Christmas. The commercial companies will sponsor the decorations of this road during the Christmas season. The beautiful lights and the Christmas trees are all lit up at night and it looks like a fairyland.
Every year the decorations are different and you will enjoy the people, the shopping and the camaraderie of fellow shoppers. Singapore is a safe place compared to Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur."
,,Good shopping location.,5.0,,We stayed in a hotel here and the shops were amazing. As we were here Christmas time the Christmas lights were amazing. They are so much better than Oxford Street lights.
,,High End Shoppers Paradise!,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a long string of shopping malls. If you are an avid shopper who prefers high-end designer labels, this is the place for you! There are a few bargain spots left (Far East Plaza and Plaza Singapura) but overall, not a spot to go if you are on a tight budget. It is fun to walk along and window-shop!"
,,Spend the day shopping,5.0,,Great to go now with all the Christmas festivities on. Weather is cooler and you can spend hours walking the length of Orchard road.
,,Main Shopping street,4.0,,This is the main shopping street in Singapore comprising of mainly shopping malls carrying international brands. Lots of underground passes and dining options.

,,World's best for a family Christmas!,5.0,,"Orchard Road in December is a rare treat for families, kids and grandparents alike! The entire road is lit up with amazing Christmas decorations and each mall vies for the top prize of the best display. Some even include ""real"" snow falling! Weather is cooler due to the monsoon season. A stroll along the excellent wide pavement for the full length of Orchard Rd is relaxing and full of sights to see, music, snacks to eat, and seats to rest and watch the world go by! And it's all free!"
,,Getting expensive,3.0,,I think Orchard is really a prime area in Singapore but things are getting rather expensive in the area. It's a place where you can no doubt get everything but I would rather shop back in HK or go to Korea.
,,Shopping haven - period -,5.0,,"Shop till you drop...this is the shopping capital for Singapore and one of the shopping capitals in Asia. Department stores, malls, hotels, restaurants, entertainment centers... everything is here. One day is definitely not enough to cover the street if you wanna shop, eat, see, play and have a wholesome family fun. And during Christmas eve and Christmas day, this street will be filled to the brim with people in full celebration mood!

Orchard Road is indeed one of the best shopping and entertainment destination in the world."
,,good shopping,4.0,,"I liked orchard road, the shopping is really good and you have a lot of choice. It reminds me of 5th ave un NYC but more hot and with more trees! But it's always really crowded and sometimes it is annoying"
,,Shopping Extravaganza,5.0,,"An amazing collection of high end shops and designer brands. A must-see but leave the credit card in the hotel. Much improved since my previous visit 20 years ago. No longer pestered by people selling copy watches or cheap suits. Serious penalties in SG for selling counterfeit goods. And so clean. in part because chewing gum banned. Once again, SG shows how it should be done."
,,Orchard Rd at Christmas time .....spectacular!!,5.0,,"Words can not describe how spectacular Orchard Rd looks at Christmas time! You can wander from one shop to another and stand and stare in awe of Christmas decorations, beautifully dressed Christmas trees and if you think they look amazing in daylight just wait till night....the street looks like fairyland!! Of course this road is renown for high end shopping and it's true if you can't find what you want in one shop you'll find it in the next. A tip.....Google became my best friend and I easily located items I wanted to buy and where they could be found. Also found many great eateries and loved the underground shopping in walkways under the road or at MRT stations. Love Singapore .....love the shopping ....love Orchard Rd!"
,,Extensive shopping available,4.0,,"A place that sells (almost) everything. Most of the big brand names have establishments here - Coach, Gucci, H&M, etc. But many things are over-priced - go to nearby 'towns' a few MRT stops away like Ang mo kio, Toa payoh & bishan to take a look at the smaller shopping malls."
,,Shoppers paradise all in the one street,5.0,,"If you into shopping in malls then Orchard Road Shopping is for you.
All the designer shops you could wish for but don't look for a bargain as
Prices are probably higher than Uk, Europe and USA
It's a very long road so allocate plenty of time."
,,City Lights!,5.0,,"This is a must-visit place during the Christmas Season not just because you can find a lot of shops here but the Christmas lights are also lovely! There are also a couple of shows in front of some malls when you walk by. I suggest that you visit this during the night to experience shopping in a street full of boutiques plus lovey Christmas lights. Though this is a high end and luxury shopping destination, you can find one mall within the street which sells relatively cheap goods which is Lucky Plaza. You can find branded cheap perfumes and chocolates here though others say that you should be very careful in buying electronics here."
,,WOW,5.0,,What an exhibition of lights and special features. Have never visited Singapore at Xmas time before. Give 100% for display and colour. Walked and road Orchard Road several time just to try and see everything. Boy amazing. Congratulations made our trip.
,,Mostly Luxury - items. Good for cinema and café.,3.0,,"We thought that it would be more midrange designer brands but its almost only the likes of Prada and such. Saw an levis, Adidas and a few more. Singapore isnt cheap for fashion anyway though. Has a nice cinema at the start."
,,Shoppers paradise!,4.0,,"Packed with different shopping malls that cover all the great brands. Some of the buildings are linked underground so it is cooler than walking on the surface. But it is beautiful to walk underneath the massive trees while you shop. There are some great places to eat with the different malls having food courts that serve some amazing food. So you can shop and eat and don't have to leave Orchard Road!! If you prefer to soak in the Orchard Road atmosphere and not be stuck inside there are some cafe's and restuarants outside the buildings.

Well linked to the MRT so easy access. I believe all the MRT lines go through the Orchard Road MRTs."
,,Christmas Lights on Orchard Road,5.0,,"Recently went to Singapore for my birthday and was looking forward to seeing the Christmas lights along Orchard Room as I had seen them a couple of years ago and they were brilliant then. Well, I was not disappointed. It's worthwhile just going to Singapore at this time of the year to see the lights and buildings along Orchard Road and the many malls along this route. Simply amazing, beautiful, bright and colourful. WOW, OMG."
,,Great location with all your shopping needs covered,4.0,,"This is a great location to cover all your shopping needs, what you might not see at first is how many malls the road has, ensure that you go off the main street and walk around the malls including the underpass mall."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"I usually head down to Orchard Road to get my perfumes at Lucky Plaza. Whatever you need, you will be able to find something for yourself in the budget range that you have. You just need to be aware of which places will give you the best bargains. Be wary of buying electronic goods when the prices are too good to be true. Shop around to get an indication of price. Don't buy it from the 1st sales person you see or meet."
,,Great for Holiday Shopping or seeing the Christmas Lights,5.0,,You can find anything you want on Orchard Road. Lots of restaurants and shops. The Christmas decorations were a highlight.
,,"Malls, Lights and Action",5.0,,"More malls on a single road than one can imagine. Though this is the high end and luxury shopping destination. If you are looking for cheap, stay away. At night its full of people and street performers."

,,For the Christmas lights,5.0,,"Oh how blessed were we. The main purpose for this trip was the lights down Orchard Rd. And the Saturday night Orchard Rd closed to traffic.

We caught MRT to Orchard and walked down to Doby Gaut MRT station.

We have AMAZING photos

A must for all and sundry even if Orchard Rd isn't closed you will still get great photos from the footpath."
,,Nice intergrated malls..,4.0,,"Enjoyed walking on orchard road.. Lots of big trees, covered light rain pretty well without going in the malls.. But when the rain pours hard, the malls was very much integrated, underpasses all all the way.."
,,Shoppers Pariadise,4.0,,Anyone visiting Singapore will never miss Orchard Road. It is one of the finest and expensive shopping alleys of the world.The luxury brands are here to hit your wallet.

,,Shop shop shop everywhere,5.0,,Shopping center everywhere ! Nice place to visit to relax and take a walk because its one of the icon in singapore very very nice
,,Average,3.0,,it is not bad but now shopping malls are no more a novelty as can find everywhere in the world. My error as had been to Orchard road about 8 years back and had enjoyed but now have similar mall or better in most part so felt is worth a visit only if you extra spare time in Singapore.

,,Great sight at Christmas time,4.0,,"So many shopping centres to explore - our favourites were ION Orchard and 313@Somerset. Although we didn't buy too much, Orchard Road is a must see during Christmas time (November/December) with wonderful themed decorations and lights everywhere!"
,,Plenty of time needed,5.0,,"Orchard Road is fabulous and I was lucky enough to walk it most days for two weeks visiting one or two large malls a
day. Wow. Yes named brands are expensive but looking is
cheap and there are a number of reasonably priced outlets.
I found a few treasures and enjoyed it tremendously. The
Xmas lights are outstanding and it is not too crowded during
the day."

,,Fantastic shopping street,5.0,,"This is a very busy shopping area. I went to see the Christmas lights because my taxi driver recommended them to me. They were worth a visit. The shops were full of Christmas decorations and looked very festive. I wasn't there to shop but on previous expeditions I found there was a great selection of fashion, jewellery and gift items. I used the underground to get there as I find it very convenient and easy to use. The locals are very helpful and will ask you if you need directions. Love Singapore"
,,Mega shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopping street like any other, there are so many large and very large Malls here that you may need a week to see them all. All the superbrands are her so come with you gold or platinum card :-) LV, Gucci, Versace, D&G, Hermes, etc I personally found ION as the best and easiest to access af all of then and the food court is great and you don't need the cards mentioned above. This mall also has a free sky deck open from 15.00-18.00 with great city views from floor 55"
,,Can't beat it for Christmas shopping!,5.0,,"Until I came to Singapore I'd evolved into a pure onlineshopper, in fact one year I'd brought everything online- and had most of it gift wrapped, I was quite proud of myself!

Whilst I still do online shopping for some items, electronics etc.. I have to say that Christmas shopping on Orchard road has become a mini tradition for me, the Christmas lights are very special, and the range of shops from designer (every one you can possibly think of), to High Street (from many different countries) to large department stores like Taka, Tangs and Robinsons means you will always walk away with gifts for everyone.
Apparently the Apple store opens next year- my Wife may be getting an ipad pro next year (even if she pretends she doesn't want one)."

,,Shopping heaven,3.0,,"I'm only scoring it 3/5 but not because I dislike it. I'm doing so because it's just another fancy road with fancy shops and malls. Not that that's a bad thing.

Even if you can't afford anything here (think $10,000 designer handbags), just wandering around and looking at the decorations is worth a visit. The restaurants and cafes on Orchard Road can be expensive, but if you duck into one of the many side roads, you'll find smaller cafe's and street stall with local food at very cheap prices. I had a delicious noodle dish (no idea what it was called) with a can of coke for $4."

,,Amazing Christmas Decorations,5.0,,We visited at night when the street was lit up for Christmas. It is absolutely spectacular. Singapore know how to decorate. The lights are turned on at 7.30pm until midnight. Get on a bus and ride the whole way down the street and have your camera ready.

Visited November 2015"
,,Most beautiful road of singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore's heart hub for shopping attractions. By the way in Singapore every where it's full of Louis Vuitton brand's show room's then think once it's most costliest city, not like Dubai where you have lot of shopping mall's and reliable for shopping you can fill the suitcase. Don't do fault by expecting shopping from Singapore it will be grandly costliest shopping i did."
,,Mostly window shopping,4.0,,Very pretty at night time but it's mostly designer stores with very expensive goods. Just stroll around and window shop.

,,Nice as always but forget about getting a bargain if you want to buy something,3.0,,"I used to came to Orchard road to buy electronics and clothes many years ago and get a bargain; not any more, (As Singapore $ is same as the Aussie $), and also prices have increased, even if a shop owner give you a discount, you most probable will get the item at a better price in Australia."
,,Xmas decorations to add to the awesomeness,5.0,,Our hotel is walking distance to Orchard Road.

Orchard MRT exit take direction directly behind the body .. and browse this path with a variety of attractions.
,,The same generic shops as everywhere else in Asia,2.0,,"A walk along Orchard Road is a pleasant enough way to get to the Botanic Gardens but it's the same old shops as the multitude of shopping malls throughout the city and there is little discernible character to the street. I didn't pass any cafes or restaurants that I wanted to visit and at busy segments the pedestrian is directed into underground shopping malls in order to cross the road.

I wouldn't rush into visiting Orchard Road unless as a conduit to a Botanic Gardens visit."
,,Shopping overdose,5.0,,"If you are a shopping addict, you better stay away. Because Orchard Road can suck out your last dollar.

The world's most famous luxury brands shine their sparkle at you as you walk down perhaps the highest priced location in Singapore. There are stuff to do for everyone - shopping, dining, movies, books, roadside shows, and more and even more.

,,"Shopping, but pretty standard.",3.0,,"I'm not the biggest fan of Orchard Road. It's not very local but just a big standard shopping area, much like you find in any country.

It does have plenty of things that other areas don't, so I often had to make a trip in for stuff I couldn't get elsewhere. (Spotlight stores, Crate and Barrel etc) and if you look hard you can find a bargain or two.

If you want 'authentic singapore' you won't find it here, it's just a designer shopping district like every city around the world has. If you are looking for souvenirs I would recommend exploring Chinatown, Arab Street or Little India areas instead.

If you are looking for Gucci and Marks and Spencer etc. you will find it here. Plus points for being able to navigate nearly the whole area through the underground passageways and malls, as if its too hot or rainy this can be a great way to get out and about and be out of the rain/heat."
,,Mall street,5.0,,"Orchard road is amazing. It has dozens of places to eat, plenty to shop at etc... everything is at walking distance and the street is really a must see.

,,Good for shopping,4.0,,Orchard road has not changed a lot over the years except that now there are many junk shops which a feel spoils the area. I found shopping to be cheaper here and is also quite easy to get to via the MRT.
,,Shopping mecca,4.0,,"You may want to think twice about bringing your significant other to this place as it is an endless mall of designer stores. You might be forced to take out a second mortgage.
There is a Rolex store on practically every corner and every store that is at street level or above is a famous designer brand. The cars parked in the street don't lie. You can see more Lamborghini's and Porsches here than at a regular dealership. The Christmas lighting is spectacular too."

Best time to be in Orchard Road is during Christmas light period from mid Nov - early January. The whole place is beautifully decorated & lighted up for Christmas. Great atmosphere!

,,Buzzing with shops and smokers!,3.0,,"We stayed at the Hilton which was conveniently located - a block away from ION mall and MRT - orchard.

Orchard road was beautifully decorated with Christmas lights and other festive decorations. Luxury brands love Orchard Road!

Not a good look - smokers smoked sat near the trees which lined orchard road -- which deterred us from sitting down and having a break!"

All major clothes, shoes, cosmetics and luxury are to be found there.
Also, many Super private and expensive medical practices there.
The malls are rather huge. One may well get lost in them (especially the ION) and icy-cold..."

,,Shopping district and more,4.0,,"Orchard Road is popular for the many competing shopping malls along the road. If you're in for a shopping treat in Singapore this is the place to be. During the Christmas season, the street is transformed with colorful festive decors. Aside from malls there are also different eating places so it's not just a shopping experience but a gastronomic one too. Don't forget to check Ion sky for a 360 view of the little red dot!"

,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"If you are looking to go shopping, this is the place to be. Every brand imaginable is available along Orchard Road. Be careful of some of the over enthusiastic salespeople who stand at the entrance of the stores and try to entice you to come inside. However, it's all part of the shopping experience. Cant visit Singapore without going down Orchard Road."
,,"Singapore Landmark! Food, People Watching, Culture and Music",4.0,,"See the flowers, trees, people, restaurants, culture, and be offered over a 100 shops and hotels to choose from. Orchard Road is a must experience!! Take the time to have a lunch on the road front, and experience the culture that attracted so many to fly thousands of miles."
,,"Shop, Shop until you Drop",4.0,,You can spend days on Orchard road visiting all the shops both above and below ground. Most of the time the streets and underground passageways are full of people and mothers pushing baby carts. On some corners you either have to cross before getting to the intersection or explore the underground passageways to get to the other side.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"The Main Street in Singapore which is full of hotels, shopping malls, restaurants and coffee shops. You'll soon max out your credit card here as all high end shops. Don't forget to claim the tax (GST) back that you paid on your purchases at the airport"

,,Mixture of High end shopping and other goods.,4.0,,Interesting to go to but I really prefer Chinatown who sell similar articles. If you want and can afford designer labels then this is the place to go. Not for me though. Worth visiting for a check out!
,,Fantastic Place!,4.0,,Can't tell you how much I enjoyed my time in Singapore. This is the one place I recommend everybody to visit at least once in their life time.
,,Great,5.0,,Awesome n great everything was fine with high end shops n lots food restaurant nearby n impressed by the mall
,,Shops Shops and more Shops,4.0,,"Great road for shopping especially if you are wanting to spend some serious Singapore $$$.
There are millions of high rise shopping malls with everything you could want to purchase. Many expensive shops and food courts.
Easy to access via Somerset SMRT station (middle of Orchard Road), Orchard Station (start of the road) or Douby Ghaut (end of the road)."
,,"Long, big shopping mall...",3.0,,"Long stretch of shopping malls, mostly containing the same stores in every other mall so it gets a bit monotonous... gets too crowded on the weekends."
,,Exuding Life!,5.0,,"I had 2 evenings out with friends along Orchard Road. It has a charm and exuberance that makes you want to stay on and on. Restaurants, pubs and shopping malls are open till late, and what's good, I could still catch a train toy hotel even at midnight!"
,,Absolutely Amazing Shopping,5.0,,"Wonderful shopping! Paragon Mall was excellent - all the designer shops, and other familiar UK shops are all there. OG, Orchard Point is also amazing for shopping. You need more than a week at least to cover Orchard Road. Excellent! Orchard Road at night is a sight to behold! Beautifully lit and decorated for Christmas."
,,No visit to Singapore is complete if you don't go to Orchard Road,5.0,,"This is the shopping and hotel hub of the city and you can get almost any designer brands in multiple stores across the entire boulevard (like Champs Elysees but in a much larger scale). There are several MRT stops there but most of the shops are conveniently reachable if you stay in a nearby hotel. Most of the hotels here are very expensive as they are high end. For shopaholics, it is a must-go and for those visiting Singapore only once, it is worth going just to experience the crowd and the lifestyle of the locals."
,,Busy and full,3.0,,"We didnt really enjoy Orchard Road, shops were quite pricy but we not much for shopping. It was a good central point to stay in and to move around. Not anything to see other than major retail stores. But very clean and easy to navigate"
,,Nice variety,4.0,,Like the Bond Street and Oxford Street of London mixed together!!! I'm not a major shopaholic but you must spend at least a couple of hours here!
,,Busy & Hot,4.0,,"Whatever you are looking for, you can find it here. Where loose and comfortable clothing because it is always hot and humid. Watch out for the heavy traffic all day and night/"
,,Nice place to soak in the late afternoon atmosphere,4.0,,"This is about 5-6km long road with shopping centers and shops on both sides of the road. Each stretch of the road seems to attract different type of crowds, so If at first you don't seem to like the place, I suggest you just continue your walk to another stretch of the road. You will also see that different type of crowds would come on certain time of the day or week. Orchard road on Sunday afternoon in front of Lucky Plaza, for example, will give you a totally different kind of atmosphere, which I personally dislike for a reason I would rather not say.

If you have a good stamina, I suggest you go to Cityhall station before the sunset and take a relaxing stroll from there until you reach the north end of the Orchard Road. You can also start your stroll from Dhoby Ghaut station or Plaza Singapura."
,,Shopping Haven,5.0,,"On Orchard Road, it is the Name Brand Store Shopping ! Many restaurants and hotels are on this main street also. A must see in Singapore, even to drive thru ..."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Lots of various types of malls suiting to various budgets. Shop all you want in the day and in the night, you have lots of bars and pubs around."

High end shops and local food and nice bars.

During day it's all business and shopping at night it turns into more kind of party place if you know what I mean.

It is safe however be careful. Trains are at the doorstep. Huge shopping malls and nice local shops.

It was great visiting Orchard Road and must see while in Singapore."

,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,Orchard Road was great shopping for pretty much all budgets. While the central malls are more high end - toward either end of Orchard Road (easy walking) you can buy from high street and discount stores.
,,great,5.0,,"5- Orchard Road,a 2.2 kilometerlong boulevard is the retail and entertainment hub of Singapore.The place hosts many upmarket coffee chains, cafes, hotels, restaurants and night clubs. Here, the architectural and design form in the shopping center is what distinguishes the place from other shopping centers around Singapore. It’s an uptown place to be at with all the top international designers and brands having their showrooms. Apart from that, it’s one of those places in Singapore where one would find many cheap massage parlours at a stretch. During Christmas, orchard road especially becomes a major tourist attraction hosting myriad shows and the street is decorated with a Christmas theme and there is light in every shape hanging from the trees and on the walls of the buildings. All in all, one should definitely add this place in their list when they visit Singapore."
,,Perfect for shopping!,5.0,,"This road is a dream for shoppers! There are so many choices; from low to high end shops, make sure to allocate more than one day to shop there!"
,,eye of entertainment,4.0,,"I've been here twice. This is like the center of Singapore for entertainment hub and malls. Also one of the major attractions in Singapore. The place is very accessible. You can drop down to Orchard or Somerset Station. You can walk along the road itself from Orchard to Somerset and there you can see lots of stores and restaurants. This is where you can see the famous ION Orchard and Lucky Plaza, where lots of Filipinos go every weekend. Every Christmas, the place is full of christmas lights."
,,Everything u looking for,3.0,,U can find all kind of products or famous brands here. If you don't like shopping. Here have a lot of afternoon tea shop or brunch. Want to watch movies? No problem. You will never get bored in orchard road.
,,Changed in the last 10 years,5.0,,"Is now full of desinger shops but worth a look around it still has the far east plaza and Lucky plaza, at lucky plaza it appears that all the small electronic shops have disappeared and the Lucky plaza may be catering for the Philippine Maids who send money home, clothes and shoes"
,,Orchard Rd,4.0,,My wife and I stayed at a Hotel behind Orchard Rd on a stopover to Europe.We have visited here before and always find something interesting to see and do including the obvious shopping and eating outlets.Would recommend a visit here to see the great range of shopping and eating options and take in the bustling and busy area
,,Singapore's exciting strip,5.0,,If you're looking for the big names and a beautiful broad boulevard Orchard Road is the place to be.
,,Shops,4.0,,If you are into high end designer stuff than this is the place for you. Extensive shops to satisfy your craving and if you are poor like me well just glance thru the window. Lol.
,,Good if you like shopping,4.0,,"Marina Bay Sands Shoppes it is not, but it has something to please most. From Dhoby Gaut to Orchard, it is a long walk. Lots of shopping centres to cool off in the heat."
,,Just trying a little too hard,3.0,,"I have to say I am disappointed with orchard road. It seems to me to have gone so up market, it is now not worth visiting. Gone are all the old original stores, replaced with Gucci, Christian Dior etc. It seems Singapore is trying to compete with the likes of London and Paris. Also all the neon lights make it seem trashy-similar to the strip in Las Vegas."
,,Need to like shopping,3.0,,"Malls, malls and malls... But you have choices, so many shops! Very clean streets, even busy keep orderly. If you want a taxi, it is only on taxi stand, it's the rule!"
,,Awesome place to visit,5.0,,"We visited Singapore during the Christmas celebrations; it was the best place to be! Lots of branded shopping stores, food diversity but was overly crowded."
,,Orchard Road,3.0,,"If you like shopping, this road offers all kinds of shops for you, mostly foreign shops like US, France and Italy. Plenty of designer stores, so bring big bucks! On the weekend, this place is crazy! And if you are tired of walking around in the heat, there are more shopping underground!"
,,"Nice, Big and Busiest Shopping Road.",5.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the big, busiest shopping hub of Singapore. It gets very crowded on Sundays, you can find all Branded , Designers Shopping malls and lot of bargain places on this or near by this road. We enjoyed shopping at Luck Plaza ."
,,Mostly overpriced,4.0,,"As with some areas of Singapore a lot of the shops here are higher end places costing a lot of money,there are shopping malls,department stores,designer shops,hotels eateries,some of the food courts are good value as are the food stalls that are dotted up and down,they have got the Christmas lights on which do look very good"
,,Many shops,3.0,,Great place if you want to buy clothes.Wanted to buy some middle priced souvenirs and found nothing.Easy to get to.
,,Hop on hop off,4.0,,"Great way to see the various stores, venues and attractions
It is worth the price - just make sure which company you buy from as many different ones so can be a little confusing ..
Enjoyed it as helped me identify easy way to get around"
,,So many great places,3.0,,"There were so many great places to visit. If you have a lot of money, you don't have to worry anything. Everything's great. The popular Ice cream was available, too."
,,Beautiful place to explore and shop,5.0,,we enjoyed wandering along Orchard Rd and into the different plazas. Everything from luxury shopping to discount shopping available. Don't miss Emerald Hill Rd for a beautiful streetscape (and the pub on the corner is very refreshing!)
,,Disappoining shopping street,2.0,,"If you are looking for shopping, go to VivoCity or Marina Bay Sands instead, unless you happens to stay in the area."
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,Here you can find from high street brands to the best of the high ends. Ideal for all types of ages and all types of shoppers. Christmas decorations are up early so that was pretty amazing. Shop opens till 10pm.
,,Take it or leave it,3.0,,Singapore is no longer a quaint interesting and cheap shopping destination. You can roam from mall to mall and not know you have moved as it's the same international chain stores with few exceptions. The actual price of many luxury goods is about the same or less in The UK. It's hardly worth the hassle of shopping and luggage. At night the end of Orchard furthest from Raffles is to be avoided. This corner is awash with drunks and people asking if you want a good time - male or female! More Bogis than Orchard! The main attraction are the hawkers food courts.
,,Excellent Shopping Place...,5.0,,Orchard road is one of the most prime location of Singapore... There are all the shops which you can name located on this street..
,,Shopping centers like anywhere else,4.0,,Go there if you are in to Shopping. I am not much so it is a bit of a waste of time if you do not like to shop. Nice art galleries though and my preferred hotel (St Regis) was there so could not stay anywhere else!
,,shopping fest,4.0,,"All the shops you can imagine and more... Nicely designed Mall linking several sub-outlets and quite a Maze underground. Direct access to Singapore metro system too. I guess no visit to Singapore would be complete without coming here. - Buyers beware, it is not an inexpesive place to shop - Quite the opposite in fact."
,,You have to buy anything to enjoy Orchard Road,5.0,,"Its the shopping district of Singapore. Actually, there are many shopping districts, but this one is a brand name. You have to buy anything to enjoy Orchard Road. It's just browsing, looking, coffee, people watching, and there you have your relaxing day!"
,,Confession of a shopaholic!,5.0,,"You want to grab those bags, boots, belts? You have it all on this street. It won't be budget friendly, you can max all your cards in 15, I bet. Major brands have multiple stores and the collection varies, so do check all of them out before making a purchase. Do check out Somerset too, if you're on Orchard street."
,,Heart & soul of Singapore!,5.0,,"Crowded, colourful & vibrant, everything you can find on this stretch of road. Never a dull moment! Shopping centres are in every corner, transports are convenient too or take the MRT."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,If you're into shopping then start from one end of Orchard Road and then if you can still walk more then go on the other side of the road and walk all the way back. There are shopping malls both sides of the road and underground too. Plus plenty of restaurants and coffee bars for refuel
,,Lots of shopping options.,2.0,,This road is for...the rich. I love shopping but the prices in Singapore are at least 20% higher than where I live. I'm talking about regular brands and high end brands. Orchard road is clean and large but other than window shopping there's really no point.
,,Shopaholic's Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard road has shopping arcade upon shopping arcade. They are beautifully organised, and the one by Orchard metro station has a stunning food hall full of inviting eateries offering something for just about every culinary palate.

The most striking thing for me was how clean and beautiful the centres were. Even the loos deserve mention. There were plenty of them, hotel standard and constantly being cleaned. Why can't the UK be more like this?"
,,"First rate shopping, massage, food etc",4.0,,"This area of Singapore has something for everyone from bustling malls to upmarket shops. The same variety is available in the range of foods available too. Have your feet nibbled by some Turkish fish, it tickle and you'll love it!"
,,Shop Shop Shop Till You Drop,4.0,,"Orchard Road Singapore is a crazy bustling shopaholic's paradise.
Start late morning as most shops are not open until 11.00am and they are open late.
You can start at the ION Centre at the Orchard Rd MRT stop and walk the full length of the strip, taking in numerous shopping centres, malls, designer shops and cafes.
The best in my opinion is the Ngee Ang City Centre with about 6 levels, the largest Books Kinokuniya stores in Asia which often requires at least a separate visit or a good hour wandering around.
The City also has quite a few very nice coffee shops for that necessary break (as most centres do not have public seating so coffee and water breaks in cafes are a must).
By the time you have walked down to the Somerset Rd arcades and the MRT stop, you will probably be walked off your feet but with a lighter wallet."
,,This is shopping heaven,5.0,,"Imagine the best / biggest shopping mall you know of in the UK. Now try to imagine a long street full of malls just like that. There is mall upon mall of high end shops, and pleasant eateries. Some of the malls are 4 or 5 stories high. You could get lost in them and go around in circles if you were not careful. If you love shopping, and have some money to spend, then this is definitely the place for you."
,,Shopping street,4.0,,Lots of shops. Mostly designer shops. You need money on one side of the street to even go in. The other side sells cheap items and is much more lower budget. It's a must see though if in Singapore.
,,Great location if ever visiting Singapore!,4.0,,"Great, accomodations; great location; easy walk to everything. This is my first trip to Singapore and the location made it very easy to manuever around the city."
,,Shop til your drop here,4.0,,"Orchard Road is lined with shops. At the top there are designer shops aplenty. In fact I have never seen so many huge designer shops in one location, even in Rodeo Drive in Beverley Hills. There is a lot of money in Singapore. If you can't afford designer then the middle and lower end has all the popular brand name stores housed in huge shopping centres. You go in through the door to be greeted by 6 levels of shops to choose from. If you want to eat or find a local supermarket or pharmacy then head to the basement levels. The food courts for cheap eats are usually found here together with a supermarket like Cold Storage."
,,We did it all wrong!,3.0,,"We had three days in Singapore and I thought I had researched it well.. We booked a luxury room at the Orchard Paradise Hotel at the far end of Orchard Road.. When we arrived late in evening we went to our room and it was awful.. Dull, in great need of refurbishment, the bathroom was full of mould and we looked out into a noisy centre void !... We went straight to reception and we were upgraded to a better room in the private part of the hotel on the 8th floor I think it was... We went down to the hotel bar for a nightcap, that was pleasant enough but four drinks cost us £32... Singapore is horrendously expensive especially for drinks...

The nest day we walked along Orchard Road to see the sight and get some breakfast, we stopped at the Marriott Tang Plaza hotel which has a street level restaurant, there were lots of people there and it looked quite good so we decided to have something to eat there and got food poisoning for our trouble which spoilt the rest of our stay in Singapore.... Of course Raffles is a must and you just have to have a Singapore Sling in the famous Long Bar... As you would expect its not cheap even by Singapore standards but don't waste your money on a Sling, they are disgusting...."
,,"Noisy, crowded and an assault on the senses",2.0,,"Orchard Road can be pleasant on a weekday and this unfortunately, is the main shopping belt in Singapore. Shops and malls are almost all brand new, dazzling and shiny but step into the malls and you'll be amazed at how the brilliance ends abruptly.

Orchard Road to me is still bearable on a weekday but come weekends, its just too crowded, not just with people but with booths blaring loud music, flyer distributors either from banks or some shops trying to get your attention. Its just a total sensory overload especially when you top that whole mess with big screen TVs adding to the noise, and its not even entertainment that they're screening, its ads. Its like a policy that every black space has to be overloaded with ads that are just in your face!

Overwhelming and unsettling, I've come to avoid this place. Besides, shopping in nearby countries like Malaysia and Hong Kong are way more satisfying!"
,,Shopping,3.0,,Orchard road has many shops and eating places. Unfortunately not my idea for shopping. Unless you are after designer wear then I would not suggest to go there. As for eating there are an abundance of eateries within the shopping plaza and Orchard Central. Would not eat at the hawker stalls. The smells turn me off.
,,FOR SHOPPING ADDICTS,5.0,,"Let me start but saying that Orchard Road is VERY VERY LONG. It would be impossible to walk the length of it in one day, especially as there are shops the length and breadth on both sides. But taxis are plentiful, and cheap and can be flagged down. But there are every types of stores from the chic and expensive to small 'tourist' type shops ( even a Marks and Spencer, but it's a lot more than here in the UK)"
,,Shoppers heaven,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the main shopping street in Singapore. The local bus from our hotel stopped several times along the street and cost very little. A taxi back to our hotel cost half the price in Britain. One side of Orchard Road is given over to designer shops and malls and the other to more middle-of-the-road shopping, although so much merchandise is imported, don't expect it to be cheap! The selection of ladies' shoes in Robinsons department store made London look rather dull! Lots of places to eat, too."
,,Super Shopping Area,5.0,,"Class apart lane of mindblowing malls ... Shopping for all .. Kid to Old ... You will get of all ranges and all brands .... cannot be missed ... For shopaholics its heaven ,,,,,"
,,ENVIROMENT,5.0,,"One of the main street of Singapore, island in south Malasia. Offers shoppings, restaurants and subway."
,,Orchard Rd,5.0,,Every tourist who come to singapore should walk in this street.. its a must because it has alot of mall and branded stuffs that WE LOVED as a women..
,,"Shoppers paradise, not for nature lovers!",3.0,,"This road can be shoppers paradise as best of shopping plazas of SGP are located here. Strolling along it may not be, at the same time, a pleasant experience for nature lovers due to very high pollution of heavy traffic on the road.

The area in front of presidential office and over Dhoby Ghaut MRT station do provide some relief from maddening traffic and crowd!

Most trees along the road are habitat of local birds chirping of which in the evening can be refreshing and monotony breaker for some."
,,Shopping street of the world,5.0,,"You name the brand..you will find a shop on Orchard Road. Great atmosphere even if you are not shopping here..plenty of food courts, restaurants, on street juice centers, currency exchanges etc."
,,Entertaining,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a must visit for every tourist, It is filled with a whole lot of branded showrooms, restaurants that cater to different cuisine, pubs, bars and also shopping malls. One will be spellbound by the variety of branded showrooms. It is one most sought after places for youngsters too. It is a very busy area."

,,The famed shopping street,4.0,,"A visit to Singapore, without one to Orchard Road, must be somewhat rare. The famed shopping street has a liveliness of its own, especially during times of festivals or on weekends. There are many high end stores which one could visit for a shopping experience. At times there are live performances on the sidewalks."
,,Shopping,4.0,,A great area to spend your time. There are malls galore....highend boutiques & restaurants....both great but expensive. Fun way to spend half a day.
,,Spacious Walking Area Lot of Shops and Restaurant,4.0,,Orhard Road is one of the favourite attraction in Singapore. Visitors come to shopping and walking along the road side is an enjoyable activity.
,,The road is nice to just walk around ..,3.0,,If the weather permits ... Then you can just walk around ... But shopping here is expensive ..there are only big brands ..so if you have money and wnt to spend ..then its fine
,,Excellent shopping,5.0,,Excellent row of shopping centers. At night the street is well decorated and lighted specially during special seasons like Christmas. At night you will notice a lot of chirping birds overhead in the trees. Tip from a local friend. Walking directly under the trees puts you at risk of getting some droppings on you.
,,Lots of food choices...and reasonably priced :-),4.0,,Same as a 'Garden by the Bay' experience - first-timers and stayed at hotel on the road. Easy access to just about everything you need and nice wide footpaths; and public transport works like clock work. Again you could spend quite a bit of time exploring this part of Singapore.
,,It's a shopping destination.,4.0,,You will find all the luxurious brands here... And you can shop here for the rest of your life. It's a long road with all the good options.
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,"From the beginning to the end of Orchard Rd, there're a few kilometres of shopping centres, malls, etc. Lots of food too. Weekends are crazy crowded.

,,All shopping malls,3.0,,Just shopping malls. You can find all luxury brands and products here. But i don't think that they are cheaper than those in HongKong or Airport.
,,"Shopping street, Easy to go",4.0,,"Many Shopping malls there. You can take bus or subway. There are also many hotels near the shopping mall. However, it's crowed when i was there."
,,Advice For Indonesian,5.0,,Visit the foodcourt of Lucky Plaza to enjoy cheap and decent meal. You can take free shuttle bus from bus station in front of Lucky Plaza to many places
,,One big shopping lane!!,4.0,,"Shop shop shop until you drop! If you want to get some bargains head to bugis mkts otherwise shops on orchard road are more expensive, coming from australia about the same price to buy here! Worth a stroll down main street as it's very pretty with xmas decorations already out, and a very clean city! :)"
,,"Shops, shops and - well - shops.",4.0,,"Walking along Orchard Road take the opportunity to enter the many shopping malls that line the road, more for the air conditioning than the actual shopping."
,,Ultimate for Retail Therapy !,5.0,,"Orchard road has an N number of malls of all standards and kinds for every pocket, budget or luxury ! Don't miss this road while in Singapore !!"
,,Where do u start? Soooooo many stores.,5.0,,From high end to little nick nack stores but wayyyyy too many to do all - great diversity. Most fashion though is local style and may not favour all international shoppers.
,,Wow!!!,5.0,,Great to walk around. Varity of places to eat. They have malls unlike anything I have ever seen. Designers that you would only expect on the French Riviera or Palm Beach.
,,Great shopping - expensive but for brand,4.0,,Great location for shopping - luxurious shopping. Only few malls where you can find reasonable rates. But for shopping lovers its a dream location. Easily accessible by all type of transport. Try the waffle icecream at the street on the go...
,,Part of the whole Singapore experience,5.0,,"Want to buy top of the line Fashion items, accessories, and Duty-Free goods at the best prices and then go to a Hawker stall and have some Hainanese fried rice washed down with tha cold Tiger beer or a Singapore Sling? Then Orchard Road is for you. The DFS Galleria is worth a visit on Scott's Road as well. Where else can you find duty free fragrances, liquor, Fashion items, etc. in one multistory building? I would go back in a minute just for a Suntory Scotch sample.."
,,SHOPPING THERAPY!!!,5.0,,"An amazing road of 2.5 kms in the center of Singapore. Whatever you might desire you can find it in those malls that provide to the customer the ultimate satisfaction in clothes ,shoes, cosmetics, electronics ,you name it.!!
MRT can help you to move around but it's nice to walk in this clean and so tidy road. And don't forget to get all your credit cards with you :-)"
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,Love just visiting all the shops and indoor markets on this road. Have been here many times over the years and still can't get over walking into M&S!! Very expensive here though. Love Tangs department store and always come away with things I never intended to buy.
,,Most happening place in Singapore,5.0,,Visit to Singapore cannot be complete without a visit to Orchard Road. It is a great place to visit any time of the year but it is at its best during X'mas and New year time when roads are well decorated with lights and other decorative items. I lived in Singapore for 8+ years and made sure that we were at Orchard Road every other weekend. It is a MUST visit place.
,,"Busy, busy, busy",4.0,,Lots of traffic and lots of shops - Many top name brands. Always an interesting walk along Orchard Road.
,,shopping road,5.0,,"This road suitable tourist for shopping, a lot of shopping mall here such as ION, WISHMA , TAKASHIMAYA, TANG< PANRAGON and etc."
,,Great Shopping Area,5.0,,This area is a mixture of cheap malls and top designer brands. There really is something for everyone and I could have spent days exploring it.
,,For shopaholics,4.0,,"The street stretches for 2.5 km and you can find any shop under the sun, plus places to eat and drink. When I visited on a Sunday afternoon it looked rather busy, but it is not crowded. I am not a great fan of shopping so have not spent too much time there, but was impressed by options. Additional plus was numerous bus links to other parts of town. There are also trains. Taxis might be harder to get as cannot stop just anywhere in the centre but in front of hotels and designated areas."
,,"If you are into shopping, go for it",3.0,,"A lot of shopping, as you can find in any large city. For me, not really interested in shopping, it's more interesting looking at all the people visiting, especially from the neighbouring countries. For them it looks like an adventure, taking pictures of each other in front of the famous stores. I noticed one store though, Takashimaya, well known in Tokyo."
,,Prime display of excessive consumerism,3.0,,"I have several bones to pick with this 'attraction' ;) of course people come to Singapore for shopping, but for my taste, this street (and other shopping outlets) are really overdoing it. I kept wondering just how much margin those shops must rake in to justify their overly posh marble and glitz store fronts. The other thing is that as a pedestrian, at times you can't simply cross the street, you HAVE to take some 'link' which means going downstairs several levels, passing more and more shops, for those who really just want to get the distance, this was super annoying ..."
,,Expensive shopping area,3.0,,"It is packed full of all the main designer shops.All the main designers have showcase shops along this famous road.Spend, spend and spend with gold and platinum cards.It is worth a visit to get the tee shirt"
,,Great shops but expensive,3.0,,If you are into your top name brands then this is the place for but be awRe that some of the prices on things are more expensive than the uk
,,The main shopping area,3.0,,"It's a long stretch of road, lots of malls left and right, that's it. It's a relic from past times when people came to Singapore to shop cheaper and locals spend their weekend 'window shopping' in the air conditioned malls. Get their only via public transport or taxi. Weekends are busier, Sundays are packed."
,,A huge shopping mall,5.0,,"This is a great place for shops and restaurants. It's very easy to access from the MRT and as it is all indoors, it is fully air-conditioned. Wifi is available too but as it is so big, it is easy to get lost and difficult to locate a particular shop/restaurant"
,,"Go for the passing parade - options galore to shop, eat and sight see.",4.0,,"Orchard Rd is about two kilometers long...Department stores and shopping malls line both sides of the tree lined road.

Both sides are linked by either basement underpasses and road crossings. Most stores open around 10,30 am till late at night. It is a hive of activity most of the day and night.

Orchard and Somerset mrt stations are the most convenient stops - on hot days stay on the basement levels, they are air conditioned - great on hot days - also many of the best retail bargains are in the smaller shops located underground.

There are so many basement level food halls and outlets on both sides of the road that it take months to graze from one end to the other.

A must visit when in Singapore."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Everyone mut visit this place when in Singapore, whether you have plenty of cash to spend on all the designer clthes or simply to stroll up and down the street to do some window shopping. There are plenty of Cafes and Restaurants to drop into but be warned. Carry lost of cash. Orchard Road is very accessible by public transport. The MRT Line services this area and there are 3 stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Sommerset and Orchard)"
,,Confused,3.0,,Seriously this is famous for shopping and i do not understand it. My wife enjoyed a lot here by vising but looks costly..

,,Fabulos,5.0,,One of the best road to stroll and do window shopping in Singapore. Most of the shops here are high end luxury brands. It is a place you must visit then you'll understand why i said Fabulos. You can use Hop on Hop off bus to reach this place or by train. Even if you don't buy do visit this place.
,,Romantic...,5.0,,Was at Orchard Road with my wife on 14 Feb 2015 and believe me the romance was in air.... couples holding hands were roaming around this shopping capital.... many events were organised for couples at this place... found it place to be unusually romantic on this day.... would love to be there again on valentine's day....
,,Immense,5.0,,"This strip needs to be seen to be believed!
The famous Singapore shopping district does not disappoint with numerous shopping centers spanning a good number of blocks. If you can't find what you are looking for here then you are not trying hard enough. The MRT delivers you into one of the shopping centres, otherwise buses are abundant.
Block out a full day, strap on your walking shoes, clear your credit card and get amongst it!"
,,Shoppers paradise 24/7 but look out for luxury motors.,5.0,,"Stayed at the Orchard Parade Hotel at the beginning/end of the most exciting road in Singapore (Orchard Road). A true international shoppers dream, but keep your eyes peeled for the truly top motors driving by, Maserati, Porsche, Rolls Royce, Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren. Great fun."
,,Lighting on New Year's Day!,5.0,,"What a view! We had gone to Orchard Road in the night of 31-12-2014 in addition to many other days. We just walked down the road. Experience of a life time! And for the first time I saw Policemen! (Well! they say you will not find a policeman in Singapore.) The policemen were there to assist you. The crowd was all too disciplined. In the rush our group got separated. My wife moved on when my grandson entered a shop. we waited there and did not realise that my wife had moved on. When we found out that she was not there with us, we started searching for. Went inside the shop, she was not there, looked back, she was not there, looked ahead, she was not to be found, then two of us moved forward to locate her while the children waited. At a distance of about 50 metres, she was standing by the side, expecting us to locate her. As we did not have many mobiles, it was not possible to have one mobile with each!
All is will that ends well! An experience to remember for ever! We went to the Marina Bay for the New Year Celebration show there after!"
,,Nice place to shop!,3.0,,This is a shoppers paradise ! It does have something for everyone's price range. You can find high end designer and the common store franchises. This street had many different malls with the same stores but perhaps different inventory. There's also plenty of electronic stores. If you get hungry you find the common food franchises and of course fancier options. It's worth a visit since it is a pretty popular attraction for shopping but nothing more.
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,It's one of the top attraction of Singapore especially for those who like shopping. Overall it's a quite long road with wide and clean sidewalk and lots of shopping centers.
,,Vibrant,5.0,,Shops were open between 10.00am -10.00pm. So clean & some amazing shopping. Easy underground access to shops across the road. Jamie's Restaurant was great value for money & great atmosphere.
,,Orchard Road,3.0,,"October 2015 . The Orchard Road . This Road could be everywhere in the World , it is nothing to do with Asia or Singapore . All you can see is expensive Hotels , expensive Shops , Rolex,Prada etc .I bought nothing"
,,Vast Selections,5.0,,If your looking for a vast selection of goods to shop this is the place from cheap to luxurious items. Wear a light pair of shoes and be prepared for a day of walking and searching.
,,Christmas is coming!,4.0,,"We haven't even seen a glimpse of snow while visiting Singapore but that doesn't stop them from bringing on Christmas. Soon the whole street will be fully dressed up for Christmas. Enjoy the decorations, the hustle and bustle and bring you credit card for some serious action! Orchard Road is Singapore."
,,Shoppers' paradise,5.0,,"For shoppers, the most rewarding route has to be between City Hall and Orchard MRT Stations. Shops are more densely located nearer the Orchard Station side so one can start from this end. The pedestrian along the road is wide but crowded. In recent years, sculpture of many styles has been placed around the open space to build up a cultural atmosphere. The road is good for family with young children and elderly too. Shops and eating places are handy. With the high local currency and rental, shoppers may not find as many bargains as in the past."
,,Shopping Mania,4.0,,"One huge road full of shops and shopping centres, they sell everything and anything, from clothes to electronics. A must visit."
,,"Money, money, money",5.0,,Loads and loads of designer shops here. Look to the bigger stores for sales or the names you know. Nice to look at though.
,,Shopping yes! Prices Ouch!,4.0,,Its all there to be gotten however travelling from L.A. the prices were approximately 30% higher on average on the same brand and style in L.A. Look but select your purchases carefully
,,Best place to walk around & shopping,4.0,,There are so many shopping malls & brand shops. Try the ice-cream with bread slice/ biscuit. Place for spending time & money.
,,Great shopping,5.0,,"The only problem here is too much choice - such a first world problem. Once you get over that though watch out wallet, its on..."
,,Top Shopping Destination,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the home of the top shopping destinations in SG. From the Ion Orchard to Takashimaya to Tangs Plaza, definitely your visit will be fun filled and also a gastronomic adventure."
,,Lots of upmarket shops but look beyond them,4.0,,"There are lots of upmarket shops and the usual high st chains but also some local craft shops, jeweller (fit a tag heure watch battery for me) and some excellent restaurants. The road also has some nice stutues by Dali and others"
,,Get lost in the maze ...,4.0,,"Deja vu - didn't I just see this shop a minute ago?! Amazing buzz and something for everyone - food, shopping, experiences and all priced to meet someone's needs!"
,,One of the many mall areas of Singapore!,3.0,,Just like any other mall area. Some very expensive shops then the usual clothing chains etc. Ion is a nice building but it doesn't stand out as an amazing mall for me.
,,Just another CBD,3.0,,"Nothing special about this part of Singapore, which I was disappointed about because so many people raved about it. Yes its clean and its a lovely spot, but I would only recommend if you plan to do shopping to visit this part of Singapore."
,,A Great Spot in the Hustle and Bustle of the City,3.0,,Well worth a visit. Orchard Road have a great feel of the past and the colonial Dutch houses and building just add to the experience. May great retro bars and alfresco eateries. It's a great place to sit and have a drink or something to eat outside listen to some great music and live bands.
,,Easy place to spend money,5.0,,"Orchard road is the shopping road, shops and malls enough for anyone. Bright, colourful and easy to enjoy"
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"We stayed at the Mandarin Orchard hotel which was very pleasant. Orchard Road is wide, tree-lined and easily accessible. Lovely shops and malls, plus lots of good restaurants."
,,Best place for shopping,4.0,,I've been here last June and hope to come back again. It's one of the best place to shop and eat. There are several types of food from many countries. The city is clean and fresh although its so crowed.
,,Best way to enjoy Orchard Road - walk and feel.,3.0,,"Well, definitely not those shopping malls along the road attracts me, I think Orchard Road has more to experience. To see, to hear and to watch every walks of people, tourists or working class, on this street is probably the best thing to do. Try the ice-cream cut with biscuit from the licensed stall at each corner of the junctions near Takashimaya, those S$1.00 traditional ice-cream is delicious and truly a taste of the past. It would be a great walk from the West to the East, just take the metro back in case your energy are dried up!"
,,SHOPPING,4.0,,"Your credit card will cry in this place, so beware! So many good stuff to buy here. The branded clothes, bag, shoes they are everywhere. It is a very big place with many shopping malls."
,,A must visit,5.0,,"A great walk down the main hub of Singapore. Here you find all the shops you ever dreamt of. High end fashion malls and original shopping centres like lucky plaza great food areas like food republic and original department stores like Tangs and Robinsons, all updated and part of Orchard Roads shoppers heaven. Love walking down the extremely wide footpaths, wandering into malls, checking out food, and is must in my opinion to any visitor to Singapore."
,,Saturday Stroll,4.0,,"I have been travelling to Singapore since childhood.
These sights have remained unchanged through the years.
The ice cream sandwhich; pidgeons and orchids.
Whats new though are the spruced up malls from Tangs all the way up to Suntec City.Both side of Orchard cater to the full spectrum of consumer.So one can either go shopping or just browse.
Its a true "" Treasure Box"""
,,Busy Road,4.0,,"Orchard road is very famous for the big well brand shopping malls. One after one, they are there. The roads are full of national and international visitors. Well maintained roads, very neat and clean. Road markings are very clear and it was easy for us to find our destinations easily. There were nice arrangements also for the tired people to take rest. Lots of trees also covered many parts of the street."
,,Nice and Clean,5.0,,"Orchard road is tourist destination from over the world, not only for shopping, also for relaxing by sitting on the bench on each side of the road. Really fantastic for me and would be visit again even I was here many many times."

,,Chic Singapore,4.0,,"Nice and civilised shopping precinct - it gets busy at weekends just like any other shopping area. Plenty of shops and wide range of goods, also numerous eateries to choose from."
,,Too much for me,3.0,,"I like shopping, but this was just too much. Huge shopping malls all trying to be bigger and better than the one next door. They nearly all have the same shops, too
If you only have a couple of days here, I wouldn't bother - leave it for the locals"
,,Soul of shopping singapore,5.0,,"This street, or rather road, have all the materialistic products you can dream of. Branded goods that equals to the cost of your months worth salary to buy."

,,Great for luxe shopping,4.0,,If you're looing for London Bond Street or Champs Elysee shopping experiences then go here. Loads of really big designer shops. Massive street which is super busy and hectic so bear that in mind if you're in a rush. Easily accessibly by the HRT.

,,3 days 2 nights 14-Aug-15 till 16-Aug-15 celebrating Sg 50,5.0,,Full of people. good view. a lot of malls & shops. shops with branded goods. I have bought casing cover for my Iphone 6 plus at Takashimaya. Awesome goods with good price. Hawkers with tricycle selling ice cream either. I bought Mark & Spencer product such as cookies & chocolates.
,,Amazing Orchard Road,5.0,,this maybe one of the best shopping street in the world starting with takashimaya mall there is a lot of shopping to be done in this street it is in the heart of Singapore.
,,Just Another Busy SHopping Area,2.0,,"I hadn't visited Singapore for over 30 years, and the change to this area is astronomical. Now devoid of character and full of traffic and shopping malls where you spend all your time underground, really, why would you bother? Food and other shopping is high end so expect to pay big bucks."
,,Long Road!,4.0,,"Fun experience, but in my 12 days in SG i must admit tha i walked orchard road once and never again, the shopping outlets are almost repetitive in every mall"
,,Singapore's Heart,4.0,,"Any visit to Singapore has to include Orchard Road. Although bustling with people the wide footpaths on either side of the even wider multi lane 2 kilometre road makes it an ideal place to go for a stroll, participate in as much retail therapy as you can take. The world famous shopping and entertainment hub is a major tourist attraction. It would seem you can buy most anything you're looking for somewhere along the strip. There's entertainment, street seating and coffee shops when you want to take a break. I would think all transport leads to Orchard Road !"
,,Miracle mile in SING,5.0,,Short and nice walk along the many luxury shopping malls in SING. Also very good dining options. Subway available.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,Absolute heaven for shoppers. There are number of malls and brand outlets. From affluent buys to value-for-money buys
,,"If you have the money, spend it!",5.0,,"The exclusive part of shopping in Singapore is Orchard road. That means you pay more there than anywhere else in the city! But, do not be put off by this remark, for it is still worth a look around the big stores and pubs, hotels, in this vicinity."
,,Awesome But Expensive Shopping,4.0,,"We spend a week in Singapore in lodgings adjacent to Orachrd Road. At night the place comes alive and its worth the stroll if only to people-watch. Be aware that there arent many public places to sit and the pedestrian flow involves many underpasses to access some of the shopping centres. So remember to wear comfotable shoes.

The shopping and eateries are plentiful but abit more expensive than some of the other areas off the main-strip.

We were able to find almost all of the international brands on this single road but be prepared to pay a premium."
,,This is everything I hate about expensive cities,2.0,,"This is a road packed with non-stop traffic and shopping malls. It is the very pinnacle of consumerism. I have very little interest in chrome-and-glass, in Armani suits, in other over-prised fashion items, in over-lavish displays of wealth. I am a boring human who likes peace, tranquility, nature, order and good value. Orchard road has none of that, except for scattered attractive architecture and some more humble shopping areas."
,,Easy way to spend your money,5.0,,Plenty of high class stores from Rolex the real thing to Tang and Robinson this Street has everything your credit card desires and more have a great time
,,A bit of everything,5.0,,Everything in one road just make sure you wear comfortable shoes and have few hours and money of course. It has all the shops in one road high end but also for the normal tourist that cant afford to go high end. Enough eating places around in case you get tired or hungry. Its also a nice place to see different people listen to street music and so on.
,,It's a must visit have to shop there. Shoppers paradise.,5.0,,Do not go to Singapore without a shopping experience along there. The bargains and food hall in lucky s centre is unreal. A few dollars under $6Singapore gives you a bowl of soup a bowl of rice a dish of great crispy duck and a plate of vegetables. Where else can you eat that much for the price? All types of spices free with food. Pick your own. Food prices leave more money to spend on trinkets etc.
,,High end shopping at its best,5.0,,This shopping strip is full of malls and plazas housing high end designer shops and some mid to lower end shops too. The ION shopping plaza was a maze of all types of shopping including food. Just make sure you come out the same way you go in from Wheelock Place because you can't cross the road from the other side. The signage is good though and it even houses an MRT station for easy access by public transport.
,,Only shopping,3.0,,"The pedestrian way is wide. The street is clean. You can see people walking, smoking, eating, shopping, selfie photo. Not only Singaporian but mostly Indonesian..."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Rd is great for people who like to shop until they drop and don't mind massive crowds and being underground for long periods of time. The vast majority of international brands can be found here, conveniently in one place."
,,Just a road full of fancy Shops,3.0,,"Full of the named brands that the everyday traveller cannot afford,worth looking at but the shops too expensive for us"
,,A place full of brands!,5.0,,"This place completes the world of brands, and it is comparatively a good bargain than Malaysia. The interesting walkway along the street gives an experience as a real tourist. Whether you are shopping or no, this is a recommended place."
,,Wear good walking shoes!,5.0,,"If you are a shopper, this is the place to go! Every designer that you can imagine, and then some, are located on Orchard Road. Be prepared to walk a lot! I highly recommend good walking shoes and a high-limit credit card."
,,Heaven for Shopaholics!!,5.0,,one shopping mall after the other - That's Orchard Road for you. The entire stretch on the orchard road is a shoppers paradise especially for all branded products.
,,Not an overseas shopper,2.0,,"Except for the air conditioning it provided, I didn't care for Orchard Road. I have no interest in walking around in a Crate & Barrel (or whatever other chain store) in Singapore."
,,A must visit,4.0,,This is one of the heart of Singapore's tourist attraction. I think everyone should visit this place because it has everything from middle-priced stuff to super expensive stuff. I particularly like Takashimaya's food court for its ample choices of food.
,,Busy as!,4.0,,"If you can't find what your looking for along here with endless malls and shops, I don't know where you would find it otherwise. The underground links also filled with shops is a welcomed relief from the heat. Insanely busy on a Sunday- almost too busy."
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"Singapore is identic with Orchard Road! ;) Many shopping centres here.. Let's say Lucky Plaza, Paragon, Tang's, Takashimaya, Wisma Atria, I-Setan and ION Orchard and many many more.. My fave places when I visit Singapore, of course for shopping ♥♥♥♥ and of course for $2 ice cream in front of Takashimaya.."
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,Great walking and shopping. People watching is great too! There are more shopping centers in a smaller area than any place we've ever visited. Easily accessible on North/South line of MRT.
,,Great variety of shops,5.0,,"Lots of shops. Would need a couple of days just to see them all. Prices aren't as good as they were in years past however they offer a great variety.

Whilst the variety is there the sizes don't cater for westerners, I had trouble finding a pair of shoes to fit my size 9/10 foot.

Well worth a visit, even if you are just window shopping."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,A good walking stretch housing the finest brands and shopping arcades. Eating stalls and 7 Elevens dot this stretch to cater to any cravings of the tummy. Hard Rock Café rounds up the ambience.
,,Singapore thoroughfare,4.0,,"Difficult to escape walking along Orchard Road. This is the city main showcase, a sort of shopping heaven for aficionados! It has changed tremendously and it is a succession of luxurious malls one after the other. It is a nice place for hikers like me though as the sidewalks are large and shaded by trees. The nice additional touch these days are the statues added. There was currently a series of artwork by the famed Spanish artist Salvador Dali. The other worthy place to visit is Emerald Hill Street just off Orchard."
,,Shoppers paradise with all the major brands!,4.0,,Orchard road hosts many places to shop till you drop! Ion mall on Orchard Road gives complimentary Wifi for 2 hours with occasional offers on top brands.
,,The main commercial street in Singapore..No body misses visiting it,4.0,,"Shops and malls of ALL kind are available in this street. Expensive shopping, cheep shopping, and any thing in between is available in this street."
,,Best shopping Area in singapore....,4.0,,Hi tech road for shoping. must visit for shopping but bit expensive... lot more shopping malls and ion orchard is must visit mall here.
,,Luxury at its best!,5.0,,Being at Orchard road is a feeling of pure luxury. One can spot all high end international brands here. Great malls on both sides of the road and lots of shopping and eating out options. SMRT has a great connectivity at this place. One can get on to the hop on Singapore bus also for an excellent view if you don't wish to walk and explore too much.
,,Two kilometres of shoppers heven,4.0,,"As per the heading this stretch of road is about 2 kilometres long and is a one way road.
Years back this was the most famous shopping paradise in Singapore . Today we have several other sopping areas. But this on still is the biggest. Also in recent past few new malls like Ion Orchard added to the glamour and fun of the place.
But do remember most malls in this area are full of designer shops and high end boutique type sales outlets. So the prices and goods available on the high side.
If you are looking for bargains this as not be the right place for you to shop.
You can use both MRT and bus services to reach here
Dhoby ghaut MRT is located at plaza Singapura which at the end of the Orchard Road while Orchard MRT is at Ion Orchard which is almost the beginning of Orchard Road.
You have plenty of of food choices from roadside fast food to signature restaurants and food courts so at least you will be spoiled for food here."

,,A big and boring street,1.0,,A big street full of expensive shops and no sights. I dislike this street and don't recommend to go to this place
,,Great place at night,4.0,,"The place really comes alive at night. We could reach here by foot since we stayed at YMCA @ orchard, it was just 10 mins walking distance. The place looks lovely at night with all the lights on and hawkers selling food. All brands can be found here esp the expensive brands. The whole strip is full of malls which makes it better since one can do mall hopping! But beware! all are expensive brands."
,,Shopping place,5.0,,whoa stores -> shopping. This place really good to go to shopping. well you can find alot kind fashion brand in here. But window shopping is fine in here. Else you can find singapore ice cream in the street. when i buy is S$ 1.2
,,well worth a visit for a shop!,4.0,,"Had a great time shopping here by myself and then with my sister. ION orchard was my favourite mall though keep in mind i didn't get to go in all of them. could spend more than a whole day on this endless road going in and out of all the difference centres. book lover must stop off at the huge book store in Ngee Ann City, the bookshop is called Kinokuniya, could spend hours in there!!"
,,Expensive,4.0,,"Orchard road is a must to see in Singapore. There are top end clothing etc rows and rows of it. The shops go on forever as do the shopping centres they are just everywhere. Gucci, prada and the list goes on, . Leave your credit card at home, saves the temptation"

,,Shopper's paradise,5.0,,"This is a must go place if you visit Singapore, I warn you , you can get lost in here :) . You can find almost any brand here.

I didn't buy anything from there but worth a visit to see latest fashions in the world."
,,A Great Place to Eat and Shop,5.0,,"Walking Orchaid road is always fun for people watching and finding whatever you want to eat or buy. Taking a hop-on hop-off bus or public transportation lets you enjoy the may faces of the road. Along the way you can go into large buildings that have many small stores/stalls/eateries to shop or eat in or have a service perfomed, i.e., a massage, pedacure, or get your nails done."
,,Now this is shopping!,4.0,,"Shopping shopping shopping not much else to say but loved the time spent in the Paragon Shopping Mall and the surrounding stores on and along Orchard Road, came home with far too many goodies ...now to pay off the credit card :)"

,,Shopper's Paradise,4.0,,I suppose everyone has heard of Orchard Road. It looks a small street but is in fact a long way. It has a huge number of malls and shopping areas. Some on the cheaper end but many of the expensive and Boutique shops are also here. Most of the places to eat are best found inside the malls along this road rather than outside. Fun and busy street but bring your wallet.
,,Welcome to Orchard Road,4.0,,"You have to visit the famous Orchard Road shopping strip, a trip to S/pore is not complete unless you do! It has everything for everyone - from the High-end purchaser to the Low-end purchaser. Singapore, for me is no longer a shopping haven. It has become quite expensive.

,,shopping galore,4.0,,"Love ORCHARD road. I have been at various times of the year, but the best time is November/December. The road is splendidly alight with colour and it feels like Christmas's of old only in a warm country. The shopping is great. As usual brought lots.of thongs I didn't need. This year Orchard road was busy, the shopping was good but the atmosphere was business as usual due to the high PSI readings. Lots of areas you can pop into for an 'air con fix'."

If you are looking for anything it is guaranteed you will find it here in the 2kms of shopping malls to choose from. Lucky that we were in reasonably walking distance as one of our travelling companions luggage was lost so we were able to find all the clothing and items he required right here. This road is buzzing and the craziness of all the late night shopping I have never seen anything like it!
,,Go if you must,3.0,,This is the heart of consumerism in Singapore... The avenue is lined by shops and malls that cater for all tastes but in general is mostly high end with a few department stores.
,,Orchard Rd shopping !,3.0,,Too Too expensive to shop. Unless your after top range designer items with top range price tags. Accomodation was reasonably priced and location good.
,,Wall to wall- shop to shop of designers items.,3.0,,"It seems that there are wall to wall designer shops, all selling the same things, also available in department stores in Orchard Road. This shopping precinct is expensive and no longer the Singapore of Olde when bargains could be had on premium designer items."
,,Orchard rd,4.0,,Beautiful and clean . Lots of shops .can be expensive as its the high part of Singapore but a must see everyone knows orchard rd when u mention been to singapore . Foods expensive along there and for the price u pay its not wow food . A glass of beer was 25 dlrs but if u google they have really nice restaurants off orchard rd with cheaper meals and very tasty
,,My husband got a great bargain buying binuloculars,5.0,,"It was great wandering down the road, only downside is if you are over size 14 there are no clothes ready made for you and to have them made is quite experience, but we love it anyway"
,,"Expensive, Fun, Block half a day",4.0,,"The good thing is that the MRT connects most of the malls through the Lower basements and that makes checking out all the malls fairly convinient. What excited me was to shop at the smaller outlets which were a part of the underpasses or under-bridges connecting malls or MRT stations. They were mostly fashion or F&B outlets run by locals (and not the big brands), and hence offered more realistic pricing for everything."
,,Busy and vibrant.,5.0,,What a lot happens in a busy setting. So many shops and restaurants. A lot of instantly recognisable brands have outlets here.
,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"No matter what you are looking for, or at what level you want to shop, Orchard Road is the place to go.

It has mall after mall, offering shops from all around the world. Coming from the UK but living in Sydney, I was very happy to find Marks and Spencer amongst all the high end labels. It is so good to be able to find so many European labels amongst all the other worldwide brands.

You can also find amazing places to grab a quick bite to eat or enjoy a drink to break up an afternoon of shopping."
,,shopping on steroids,5.0,,"Orchard road is home to all the shops you have heard of and read about in magazines and then some more. Service in every shop is excellent. However Singapore is no longer the home of bargain shopping. Shopping hours are extended, so you can really window shop for a full day or more"
,,The place to go if your interest just run to shopping,3.0,,Lots of shops - from the exclusive & overpriced to the cheap & dodgy (eg Lucky Plaza). Far more interesting places in Singapore
,,This is the place any women needs to go once in a lifetime! ++++,5.0,,"MUST DO IN SINGAPORE Shopping Heaven!!! Location Location Location
Brand Names everywhere but average shops for the average Joe like me.
Amazing food in shopping complexes and hours and hours and days of shopping to do BRING SOME GREAT SNEAKERS... Don't even think about heels, save them for a nice dinner out in town but for shopping all day your feet will still hurt that night so good luck. :P"
,,A great place to shop if you have lots of mony,4.0,,"Orchard Road is probably the premium place in Singapore to shop, if designer gear is your forte. However, I found that in general that prices are far higher than at home in England, apart from Technology items which are about half the price of similar items in England. The only problem with Technology is that some items may not be honoured on the guarantee as they may be made to use in the Far East only. Its a fun way to pass a couple of days, yes days, as it's a vast area."
,,"Shopping malls, everywhere..",3.0,,"The road is almost one big shopping mall, since you can go underground from mall to mall, which is a great way to escape the heat. You can find everything here, to high end till the local 7-11. You won't get bored here if you're on a shopping spree."
,,Grand and Expensive affair,4.0,,"One of the high-end locations in Singapore, this is a great place for shopping. And it boasts of some good restaurants. But again, it's on the expensive side. So choose carefully - if you are looking for less expensive shopping/dining places, you might want to try ChinaTown"
,,Shopaholics Heaven,5.0,,"While you can get every European designer label here be warned that they are cheaper back home. On the other hand, local and Chinese made goods are very reasonably priced.

Famous international brands like Crocs have a much wider range here than in Europe and cost a lot less. Also, high-end brands of perfume are less than half the price of so-called Duty Free airport shops in Europe. But buy these in the smaller specialist shops where you can bargain.

However, the days of cheaper Rolex watches and Apple computers is over here as the big name brands seek to equalise their prices internationally. Where you will save with high-end watches and audio gear though is on bigger discounts.

Don't be afraid to bargain. It is the done thing here except in the big department stores."
,,I really cannot think of a worse place on earth to spend time.,1.0,,"I really cannot think of a worse place on earth to spend time. There really isn't anything here that I aspire to own or be associated with. If you are so Vacuous that you Site Shopping as a hobby or pass-time, then this may well be heaven for you.
If however you are looking for culture, class, taste, value for money or good service and a bargain. I would suggest that you look elsewhere because it wont be had here."
,,Shopping for all,4.0,,Browse the 2km. It has shopping for all. Stay away from lucky plaza. Well worth the visit. Can get extremely busy. Take your passport to get 10% discount if you are a tourist.
,,Nice,5.0,,"Lights, bulidings, malls and everything. This is the best place to go shopping of branded items in Singapore."
,,Singapore shopping mecca,3.0,,It's famous for shopaholics .. But is it special? No in my view because it doesn't have any unique character unlike knightbridge in London or Central in HK. All the usual.names are in big malls next to five star hotels. But you won't find bargains except during sale season. It is singapore.shopping mecca but not all that unique.
,,Shop Til' You Drop,4.0,,"Luxury shopping galore. Fill your purse and wallet with every Black, Gold and Silver Card plus some dollars to quench with inbetween shopping session cafes. I recommend two days here: one for browsing and the next for buying."
,,A studded orchard,4.0,,"Orchard Road is an unmissable street in all of Singapore.

Orchard road is best traversed on foot since its not a very long stretch. This area also have plenty of restaurants and upmarket chic bars for everyone's likings to get their taste buds satiated or even their heads swinging with some interesting cocktails. A place where the rich and famous of Singapore throng for their hip shopping and great nightlife. Orchard road is a unmissed jewel in Singapore's crown."
,,Tips to enjoy Orchard Road,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the most popular road in Singapore. You can find plenty of shopping malls and part of the most famous hotel in Singapore, like a Hilton or Mandarin hotel or Hayta. Also one of the best thing of this road is that is probably one of the best link to connect and moving another areas of Singapore, because you will find plenty of buses or MRT lines and visit in just 10 min by train Marina Bay Sands Hotel or going to the fast train to visit Sentosa Iland.

,,Busy Busy Busy,4.0,,"We have spent five days looking at what the shops and restaurants have to offer on Orchard Road. There is no shortage of choice, from world famous shops to cheaper ones, and reasonable restaurants to very expensive ones. You will not be shopping or eating alone, as Orchard Road is very popular, so factor in time to negotiate the crowds! Also, the haze (smog?) has been simply awful so this may affect your stamina!"
,,Most Happening Place!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the most popular stretch of road dedicated to shopping, food and some play!

From the start at Tanglin Mall, all…… the way to Plaza Singapura Shopping Centre, you will find huge malls, mostly at both sides of the road. You will need stamina for this and of course, you need not hop into every mall nor could you do it all in one day…Sometimes, you can just soak in the atmosphere with a nice stroll along the road.

Beside shopping and food, you can also visit the Istana (during open days), National Museum of Singapore, and Singapore Art Museum.

Easily accessible via mrt and buses."

,,"Good Quality Shops, Hotels and Restaurants",5.0,,"If you love Chinese cooking you must visit CK Tang store on Orchard Road where cooking demonstrations are held especially during the weekends when more brands are out vying for your custom. ION Orchard is fairly new and it has good quality shops and a food court for those who likes to taste local dishes. Takashimaya is an amazing store stacked with beautiful clothes, shoes, household goods, etc. One would need 2 whole days to explore Orchard Road properly as there is so much to see!"

,,Not for me,1.0,,"I sit here waiting for my wife, she is looking at more clothes, bags and shoes. God please no more shoes, at least anothet 4hrs of this. I keep on going on knowing it is worth some browny points and i will be fed soon. This is torture more tiger beer stalls are required to kill a few brain cells."
,,Orchard Road - A treat,4.0,,Orchard Road is one of the most happening places in the whole of Singapore . After the Merlion its the most sort out destination in this city . Malls restaurants flock a galore over here . A real treat to live by the Orchard Road experience .

,,Shopping is boring for Europeans,4.0,,"I love Singapore and over the years people have always said that if you love shopping - it is the place to go. Yes the Variety is great but not for Europeans or if you're living in Europe. They have all the stores we do. Shoe shops clothes etc etc and not mention a Rolex store on every corner. You really can leave this of your list to see and do. its not fascinating unless you really LOVE shopping..... And bargain wise, i found it expensive...."
,,Lakwatsera SA Singapore,3.0,,"Traffic cause by F1 I guess.. The area is nice closest to all shopping malls, foodies.. Lucky plaza within the orchard."
,,mall after mall after mall selling mainly the same stuff,4.0,,If you want high end clothing this is the place to shop. There are a few malls lhat have mid range stores and offer great shopping. It is a shopper's paradise though the same brands do occur over and over again
,,Do NOT miss out on the Food Republic food halls,5.0,,"The shopping malls on Orchard road have literally everything you could ever want to shop for (unless you're a WalMart shopper, in which case there's almost nothing here for you). From midrange to high end clothing stores, jewellery stores, phone accessories, novelty stores and more. Ion Orchard is THE mall to start in.
If you like books, Kunokiniya in the Ngee Ann City mall is gigantic book store on a scale you can't imagine.
Paragon has some more down-to-earth stores. Less Louis Vuitton and more Timberland.
Do NOT shop in Lucky Plaza - there's a lot of enticing electronics vendors that face out on to Orchard Road but not many of them are reputable. Any number of scams can happen in here from grey imports with no warranties (less likely) to charging for things that would normally be included (like battery chargers and cables). The latter is the most common. You'll get a great deal on a camera but you have literally just bought a camera. Want the battery? Charger? Manual? Box? All extra.
My tip is something not a lot of western tourists seem to do: eat at one of the Food Republic food halls. I say that not a lot of westerners seem to go to these places because from the four times I've been to Singapore (and the many times I've eaten at a Food Republic), I've yet to see another westerner at any of them. The two I would recommend are on the top floors of 313@Somerset and Wisma Atria. These are not food courts like a westerner would recognise. There's no McDonalds, Subway or Panda Express here. Food Republic has local food vendors - VERY local food vendors. It's one step above the famed Singapore hawker food stands and the food is every bit as good. Don't expect to procrastinate, or make substitutions or ask for anything vaguely customised. Go for what the vendors have on show on the picture menus - food will come out quick, be hot and fresh, and be very VERY good quality and value for money.
The FR on top of Wisma Atria has a drinks lady that wanders around with a drinks cart (you don't typically get drinks from the food vendors). The FR on top of 313@Somerset has a dedicated drinks vendor in the middle of the hall."
,,Full of action,5.0,,Well if you like shopping orchard road is for you malls after malls and designer shops. Cafes all around and if you like to pop into raffles famous hotel you can have a Singapore sling but at $31.00 dollars you better have deep pockets . The shops are great clean and vibrant .

,,Best shopping experience,5.0,,"Malls malls everywhere, a shopping paradise. Must visit if you are going shopping, you can find almost all the brands in the world"
,,Nicer option for central shopping & dining in Singapore,3.0,,"Very clean, safe and conveniently located variety of shops & dining, however don't expect much different than you'd find from most of the other mall options throughout Singapore. A good mixture of both high and moderate end shopping and dining. Suggest avoiding Orchard on Sundays, as the area is blanketed with people, including helpers off on Sundays who picnic literally on the sidewalk."
,,Malls,5.0,,The best road to spend money. Almost every buildind of this street it is a mall. Dont miss ION Orchard Mall.

Always take your passport so if you spend a hundred dollars you can claim back the tax at customer services within the shops. Great food halls too, with perfect reasonable priced food of decent quality and it also keeps you nice and cool !"

,,Cool to shop,3.0,,"If you can, try not to visit Orchard Road in the weekend. So many people are out and visit it, so you might not enjoy your day here. If you like to shop, then you will like it here. If not, then you can skip it."
,,busy place,5.0,,"busy,busy,busy.so manys shops and so much to see,were do we start??we spent a lot of time in the basement shopping arcades,we found these to be a bit cheaper,found some great places to eat."
,,Way out of date.,3.0,,"This used to be the street in Singapore for shopping. Its way past its use by date. there were even a couple of places which were vacant.

,,"Shops, shops, shops oh ! And shops",3.0,,"The place is just a massive shopping street with little else but shops, only a few places to sit, eat, drink and watch the world go by, and the world of Orchard Road is a hundred thousand shoppers mainly clutching and staring into mobile phones ? At least 8 out of 10 are staring into their life support IPhones, but if shops shops and shops is what your looking for then knock yourself out on this road"
,,shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"the best place to shop while in Singapore is orchid road. it has malls, and the metro services are inside the malls, so it gets very convenient for people to travel places and go shopping. all sort of branded stores are there in one place, so we don't have to roam around and it is convenient"

,,It was ok,3.0,,"We visited Orchard road as people that visited Singapore said it was the place to be... However we thought it was ok a lot of designer shops and the Ion mall etc now I do like shopping and I like going to malls been to plenty all over the world. I just felt Singapore has a lot more to offer in terms of attractions so compared to all the other things we did in Singapore Orchard road to us was just ok big we did not spend much time here, and if I visited Singapore again I would give it a miss and do one of the attractions in Singapore instead. What I will say is if you do go to Orchard road try some ice cream from one of the stalls outside they put it in a piece of bread like a a sandwich it was a strange idea but promise you was lovely and cheap too:)"
,,Same as always,4.0,,Find every possible mid to high level brand along the malls on this road which gets repetitive if you visit more than often. Great for shopping if that's what you are there for bytes not much else to do or see.

,,Good for the shop-a-holics but there are better malls else where.,3.0,,"Orchard Road was less than I expected and less than some other large shopping malls I've visited, true there are many shops but it's more like 3 separate malls which means going outside into the heat and humidity which detracts from the experience. Construction in the area detracted from the experience as well."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,The best aspect of shopping on Orchard Road is the taxi service.

,,Over rated,3.0,,"Yes Orchard Street is a 6km long shopping strip with a few high profile restaurants as well, however we felt it was over rated and not a shopping strip that we would shop at.

Most of the shops here are high end brands with multiple shops along Orchard Street, and not for the everyday regular shopper e.g. Louis Vuitton, Max Mara, Prada, Aston Martin, Dolce and Gabbana etc.

Too much of a good thing?

Wouldn't miss it but wouldn't return unless there was something specific I needed to buy."
,,Very nice place,3.0,,"Orchard road is a nice place but please don't get me wrong, if you are from London, and been on oxford street it pretty much similar to that, just the road a lot wider and shopping centres a lot bigger lol.

The whole area is filled with middle to high-end shopping malls that caters to the whims of the goods-crazed tourist. Prices of commodities may vary so I recommend that you compare prices from different venues to get the best deals. Food establishments are aplenty so you will not get hungry from shopping.

Huge shopping centres inside, as well as movie theatres, hair and nail salons restaurants etc. Not much clothing here if you are a bit on the large size though.

I walked around 1 hour with my girlfriend. She is really a shopping fanatic and loves to try new make up and see new trends etc.
But, even she said after one hour walking around 'Please let us go'.
This street is our personal hell. We had such a headache after this hour. Unbelieveable.
5,6 or eben 7 big shopping malls. All the expensive fashion luxury brands. Overcrowded elevators and lifts. Just people walking fast like little ants building a new anthill. Everyone and everything is busy. You constantly having a pulse of 150.
Maybe nice if you don't have to look after your bank account. But for tourists not worth to see."
,,Always fascinating,4.0,,"This time it happenned to be a pedestrian night at Orchard Road! It was cool ! The police blockage 1 block in front of Nge Ann City and Wisma Atria so it was free from cars.

,,Got all that back home...,1.0,,We went based upon the recommendation that this was a good place to go but honestly it was a bunch of repetitive stores in malls for a kilometer. There were a few unique places but you had to go into the dirty dingy malls that look like they were a hundred years old. We spent most of our time in there and not in the 50 different Rolex stores. I would not recommend this as a tourist attraction but rather a place to leave your wallet if that's your thing.

,,If you want to shop.....,4.0,,then this is the place to go in Singapore! In the various Malls you can buy cheap tourist 'tack' right up to top end designer stuff (not necessarily the same Mall). Great to wander down and see the variety on offer. Plenty of options for food so no reason why you cannot spend the day there (money permitting).

,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,There are a huge number of shops from the most inclusive to the reasonable priced stores. You could spend a half day in any of dozens of malls. It is best to get there just after opening(10 am) before the crowds. If it is hot on the street go into the air conditioned malls. Toilets are available in the malls. Everything is spotlessly clean
,,If you are not into shopping...,2.0,,The street is shopping central for Singapore. If shopping is not your thing then your options are much more limited and I would suggest that you don't allocate too much time here.
,,Shopping District of Singapore,4.0,,"If you're in Singapore for glamorous shopping, this is where you want to be.

It is very flashy, pricy, and crowded. The food and drinks are way overpriced, which doesn't seem to bother the rich folk who feel the streets. The architecture and design of the buildings is stunning in a modern way, so stop by even just for a bit if that suits your fancy.

If you're looking for a cultural experience, try somewhere else."

,,Good for wealthy tourists,4.0,,"The Orchard Road strip is the most familiar retail shopping area for tourists in Singapore, but please note that you will get better deals and lower prices at malls and shopping centers near HDB housing areas in many other areas of the city.

,,Good ambience,3.0,,Very well situated but quite old building this hotel offers the Singaporean hospitality. I was surprised with the quality of the food from room service. Near to the bubbling street of Orchard Road food on the street /mall/ restos very easy .Shopping also a real treat. I loved my trip
,,Something for everybody,5.0,,"If you go to Singapore then Orchard road is a must. There are several large shopping centers selling all sorts from cheap and tatty to very expensive items. There are lots of places to eat and half way up there is a stall specializing in Durian fruit which is something you need to try, essentially do not be put off by the smell which is awful, once the fruit is in your mouth it transforms its self in to something entirely different with a wonderful taste and texture of smooth custard. TRhere are several attractions near the road as well so if you can put up with the heat give it a go."
,,The city,5.0,,"If you are here to do some shopping at a city area. You have came to the right place! Orchard road is a place where all the branded goods, great food and hotels are. The prices of things are generally the same through out the entire Orchard Road. Do take note that majority of your shopping will come from departmental stores. If your main goal is to get cheap stuff or haggle, Orchard Road isn't the place for you! Definitely expect prices to drop when there is 'Singapore Great Sales' going on.

It is great if you want to spend the night there to eat at one of the stores! There are also couple of night pubs and clubs around the area should you be interested in having a night life."
,,Amazing....,5.0,,My favourite favourite road in asia is Orchard road i love dis road itz so amazing orchard rd has everything starting from shoping to everything just love Orchard road..Datz y wenever i visit to Singapore i choose a hotel in orchard road..INSHALLAH wil b dere agn soon...

,,Shopping - eye popping,3.0,,Amazing. Walked from one end to the other and back again. Cannot believe there are that many shops in one spot.
,,Shopping Overload..,4.0,,"This was just retail madness but in a good way. I still can't get my head around the multitude of shopping centres along this strip and I'm pretty sure you could find anything along here.

We caught the MRT out to Orchard Road and made the mistake of trying to navigate our way from the Somerset MRT. I had no sense of direction and couldn't work out which way I was headed until I could get street side and see the sky. Everything seems to have 3 or 4 basement levels, with basement level cross overs and links to neighbouring shopping centres. I wouldn't be surprised if you could navigate Orchard Road without having to go to street level.. At least that's how it seemed.

My only tip, if you are looking for a shop in particular, do your homeowrk and try to narrow down its location. Stumbling around hoping you'll come across it doesn't really work with luck playing a bit part if you're successful.

Even if you aren't into retail therapy however, there are some great cafe's, eateries and bits and pieces where you can grab a coffee, ice cream or some serious food and watch the world go by.. Another must do in Singapore, at least once."
,,Big name shopping,3.0,,"Very clean slick shopping street with most of the high end clothes retailers, Prada, Chanel, Louis Vitton etc. If this is your bag then you'll love it, lots of big malls too but don't expect too many bargains, this is not haggling territory!"
,,Great Night Scene,5.0,,I don't get the change to really walk around. I just drop by Orchard Road. It was awesome with night scenery. Crowded with international people and also crowded with very big mall. I can't wait to have another trip again.
,,Busy and Grand.,4.0,,"Somewhat like a New york feel. Just go walking in the road. We took a walk at 12 am . Safe and the shops really impressed. Its more of window shopping as you are unlikely to buy anything there. But the grandeur is worth the visit.
In the evening when the crowd gets iut and you have street singers etc ite awesome. The buzz is impressive. Best would be to stay on Orchard road."
,,Shoppers paradise.,5.0,,"Fabulous!!! If you can't find anything to buy in that street, you are very hard to please. From souvenirs to high end luxury, everyone is catered for. The shopping centres are huge and air conditioned, which is a welcome relief when shopping for the day. Although expensive, there are a lot of sales. You can also bargain in jewellery shops."
,,That is a shopping street,4.0,,"This street offers every thing, something for every body: shopping in various price ranges, food courts and great restaurants. Great Singaporean Laksa one can get in the Basement of Tangling Mall - I always go there for a ball."
,,Asian most favourite place to shop.,5.0,,"From wherever you are, as long as you are shopaholic, you will love orchard road. There are some good hotels in this area, but here is my opinion:
If you don't have any budget for accomodation and have a some standard for fab life, better to stay at Meritus Mandarin Orchard, Park Hotel Orchard, or Marriot Orchard. So after you hold many of shopping bags, you can drop it at your hotel room first, then continue to shop again.

But if you are in budget, you could stay at Holiday inn express orchard, Hotel Jen at Orchard Gateway, York Hotel, or even rented room at apartment for sharing.

Try a 1.20 $ ice cream along this road, wear comfortable shoes for shopping, and for food, simple, just look at the queue in front of the stall or restaurant. Happy shopping!"
,,Shopper's paradise,5.0,,"Must go to Orchard Road when in Singapore. There are many retail shops, malls, Department stores restaurants and food outlets. A great place to shop and to eat. Be prepared to spend a whole day there, but you still,won't see everything."

,,"Malls, shops, and ... malls",3.0,,Enthralling area if you are planning - and willing - to spend your bucks and pennies on famous brands or even knick knacks. Tenants are mostly similar in these malls but it's a great area to waste a day (or two) in Singapore.
,,Worn down,2.0,,I was expecting a bustling road with good stores. But was disappointed. The road just seems to be holding onto its former glory. I will not recommend as a must visit
,,Waste of time,1.0,,"This is promoted as a great shopping experience, not surprising that most shops are empty. Really expensive, same old shops in multiple shopping malls with freezing air conditioning, just like at any airport. When I go abroad I want to see shops selling things that I can't get in Oxford Street, Orchard Road is just multiple Oxford streets crammed together, If we ever return to Singapore we will not be going to Oxford Road."
,,Great architecture and lights,3.0,,"It's beautiful, but it's just shops and malls, and it's just not my thing. For those who like shopping a little too much, and are rich enough to pay the expensive prices, it might be fun."
,,Great place to shop at orchard road,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a 2.2 kilometre‑long boulevard that is the retail and entertainment hub of Singapore.

It can take you for 1 whole day to shop till you drop. A detailed guide to Singapore shopping from high-end Orchard Road malls to bargain stores. It is quite fun to shop, stroll, or just enjoy a cup of coffee, finger food or a hot plate of waffles with a scoop of ice cream just to relax your mind at any shopping mall after a whole day of walking ....."
,,Orchard Road - Robinson,5.0,,"This year when I visited Orchard Road I was surprised that finally Robinson has
its own building after the dreadful fire in the early 70s in downtown Singapore.
I was glad to see that they retained their old characteristics - i.e. being able to find
everything under one roof. I was looking for a present for a friend's baby. I found an
ideal gift for her."
,,Very developed location,5.0,,"For a moment I thought I'm at Korea. (No joke, haha) The streets were well kept, old or new buildings were definitely well maintained and the amount of eye-catching statues/arts/monuments were indeed very well developed. Access to many location through links/bridges has brought convenience to travellers and the lively atmosphere were absolutely fantastic. Great location for exploration, whether it is solo, with friends or business."
,,Only a posh shopping area,3.0,,"Unless you are coming to Singapore for shopping yourself to death and with loads of money, Orchard Road is not an interesting ""attraction"" I would recommend."
,,Shopping Shopping Shopping!!!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopping paradise!! Small brands, big brands it's all there!! ION is the main shopping centre that most people would go to. But all shopping malls are interconnecting which is convenient if it is raining you can just use the underground walkways. If you are visiting Singapore, Orchard Road is a place you must go visit."
,,Over-rated,3.0,,"Orchard Road is billed as the epitome of shopping. Sorry, vastly over-rated for the ordinary traveller. Unfortunately, in general, prices are higher in Singapore than Australia. Orchard Road is even dearer. OK for a look."
,,"Easy to travel, a lot of same store, hot!!!",5.0,,"Orchard Road is a must see in Singapore. Though the weather always makes it difficult to walk ON the street. I would recommend walk underneath it, since most stores are connected once you get out of subway anyway. A lot of the same stores are along the way, so I have to say once you've seen a section you might have seen most of the stores. ice-cream with cookies or with bread is a nice snacks but it's on ground level on the street."
,,All you could possibly want!,5.0,,"You couldn't visit Singapore without at least a stroll along this high-end shopping street.
All types of stores and nations are represented, with top designers dominating. But for those on a budget there's the Swedish H&M, Spanish Zara, and good old Marks and Spencers. Also a number of department stores including Robinson's and the Japanese Isetan. We even found something as pedestrian as travel-size toiletry items at the Guardian pharmacy in the Paragon centre.
Don't plan an early start though . The store hours are 10.30am to 10.00pm, so you can plan a day of shopping around breakfast, lunch and dinner. And for when the feet get sore, there are plenty of places to rest with a coffee or drink."
,,Middle to high end shopping,3.0,,"Being located at the St Regis we were within easy walking distance of the shopping paradise that Orchard Road presents. Not only are there the glamour stores, but a range of great shopping complexes such as the ION centre, Robinsons and Paragon, to name but a few, that provide plenty of middle to high end clothes and gifts. Unfortunately as the Australian dollar was pretty much on a par with the Singapore dollar there were not too many bargains to be gained in this area, but if you're prepared to hunt through racks and stores there still are bargains to be obtained."
,,Shopper's Bar! Intoxicating!,5.0,,"Shopping, shopping and shopping! Loved the Abercrombie & Fitch outlet! There are many more to name than just one! What's not there!"
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"lovely road with all activities. contain of hotels, shopping malls, coffee shop, restaurant and 7 eleven."
,,not as clean as it used to be,3.0,,government should pay more attention about cleaning. in the afternoon almost every spot is dirty. not so comfortable to see anymore.
,,Same shops as everywhere - like being in a giant airport,1.0,,Lots of shops - none very original. The same shops as everywhere. Airport shops + cheapies that exist everywhere in the world. Mostly more expensive than everywhere else in the world. I don't think it is worth a detour.
,,Lights,4.0,,The lights stuning. I love the atmosphère. Such a beautiful lanscape city of singapore! Hope someday back here again!
,,Extensive shopping both posh and not so posh! visited in 2010,5.0,,"Amazing amount of top end stores. Plus loads of eating places and bars, would recommend the Half Moon Rising for a night out."
,,THE shopping district of Singapore.,5.0,,"International hotels, malls, cinemas, restaurants, stalls, food courts, Orchard Rd has them all. Well served by the MRT, buses and taxis. Shops range from tatty cheap to genuine top brands. Fakes are strongly discouraged by the Govt, but can be found prospering under cover. Bargaining in all but the major department stores is essential, as is getting 2 or 3 quotes for items over $100, if time permits."
,,One stop shopping destination,5.0,,"The Orchard Street had me spoilt for choices. From names like Chanel to popular local brands, this street is a shopping hub.
You will find everything from clothes to souvenirs, plus it is well connected with the MRT station.
The ion mall and Takashimaya mall is my favourite with brands like Charles and Keith, Forever 21 and étude house.
If you are looking for economical options, visit the lucky plaza."
,,Great modern shopping place,4.0,,I was many times in orchard rd already and it is wonderfull with many decorations and many many malls. But it is quit bussy
,,over priced,1.0,,high end shopping in Asian sizes good luck finding anything other than an over priced handbag here. not my cup of tea
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,Great shopping and also people watching... I was last there just before F1 hit the city and there were a plethora of super cars on display. Could spend hours going from one air conditioned shopping mall to another !
,,Really don't waste time.,1.0,,The shops looks dated in places like Lucky Plaza which are Pinoy favorite. The newer malls offers high end stuff that many says are more pricier than in HK & Bangkok (even Jakarta). Will give it a miss .
,,Singapore at its most chic...,5.0,,"Orchard Road doesn't even have to try to be elegant, it exudes panache from from one end to the other and it truly has something for everyone. For the book lovers it has some of the most amazing bookshops in the world, for those who jewellery and fashion, it can certainly give Rodeo Drive a run for its money."
,,annual visit during december,5.0,,Woww - so good ambiance extraordinary- All people was in a festive mood. Decoration was superb- But we need to wait for 2 hours in a queue to be seated for dinner.. But though we enjoyed very much
,,Shopping and more shopping!!,5.0,,Orchard Road is beautiful at night. All lit up. LOTS of food places to choose from. You just have to go inside of the shopping centers to get to some of the nicer restaurants. If you are there around Christmas it is fabulous to see this road all decorated. There are many shopping centers across SG in general but Orchard Road has a lot of designer shops and merchandise. Easy to walk but crowded at night and on Sundays. Favorite place for us was Somerset 313 because we lived nearby and the MRT station was there. Movie theater at Shaw House. Centerpoint has bookstore and Cold Storage grocery store. Paragon is more designer like shops with a Cold Storage as well. People are very helpful and kind so just ask if you want to know something.
,,Day trip to Orchard,5.0,,"Take a bus or the MRT to Orchard Road( 10 stations) from Sembawang or 1hr 15mins on bus 167. You an always get a seat on the bus as the bus terminus is next MRT station.
We took a bus ride on National Day 9 August morning. Weather was nice and cloudy.
Free ride on this day for everyone. Never happen for years, this is my first time in 60 years. I was so excited and happy also."
,,Could Be Any High Street In The World,3.0,,"I'm not sure why everyone gets so excited about the shops on Orchard Road - they are the same as any other high street in the world, same brands and the same layouts. Difference is, very few in Singapore have a sale running making the stores on Orchard Road generally more expensive than your home country."
,,Bright lights,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore this is a must - a busy road, with so many activities going on. It's filled with trees either side and is an amazing spectacle over the Christmas period. It sums up the essence of Singapore for me. No sign of chewing gum anywhere and everyone crosses at the lights!"
,,my visit to singapore,5.0,,take lots of money because there is so much to buy a safe environment to be in i would definatley go back again
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"Orchard Road very good and clean, it have many shopping center, it so very good for foreigner so much"
,,A popular strip,4.0,,Leafy road with plenty of shops n restaurants. Crossing the road underground is a labyrinth of shops. Easy to get lost and kill a couple of hours
,,Paradise for shoppers,4.0,,"I love shopping at Orchard and like to reach there before noon. Its not so crowded. Restaurants and foodcourt are still empty. I can take my time to walk around and choose what I like to have for early lunch. After that, I start my shopping and usually begin at Ion, then Wisma, Takashimaya and will stop at Somerset 313 or Orchard Central for a break/drink. I just love this road of shipping malls."
,,Best Shopping Place,5.0,,"Best shopping place in Singapore, from high end to low end. Visit during Great Singapore Sale or end of year for best bargain deal."
,,Day trips,4.0,,"Such a good shopping experience as well as the environment down this street. Everything is easy to get to from here. Bus stop everywhere, get on the hop of hop off day passes then can just get on and off where you want and then get back on. great way to see this city."
,,Nice clean shopping street,4.0,,"The road contains plenty of shopping malls and hotels.. It's very nice to have a walk in the evening as the lights glow the street, the pedestrian lane is wide and very comfortable for walking freely with no congestion."
,,Shoppers' Paradise!,5.0,,Excellent place for shopping. You will find whatever you want. All famous brand shops are available here. But most of them are very expensive. Lot of good restaurants with variety of cuisines are available.
,,Best place to shop,5.0,,"There's a lot of shops, from high end to affordable one. Highly recommended to those who love to go shopping."
,,The place to be seen,5.0,,The is by far the best shopping belt in Singapore . Nothing comes close. There is nothing you can't find here.
,,THE Shopping Street in Singapore,4.0,,"A trip to Singapore is not complete without a trip to Singapore's equivalent of London's High Street. Orchard Road is Singapore's premier shopping street, with malls stretching from one end, Tanglin Road, to Bras Basah Road. It used to also be the main entertainment street for clubs and pubs but that has since moved to Clarke Quay, Marina Bay and Chijmes. Only a small side street called Peranakan Place holds some pubs like No. 5 and Ice Cold Beer."
,,Nice atmosphere,4.0,,"Good choice of branded items. A lot to select from. Sometimes can be overwhelming. Can be very crowded during weekends.

It would be good if there are more sitting areas in the malls to accommodate the needs of tired feet - both for adults and children, specially when mommies are on a shopping spree."
,,Shops for Any Pocket,5.0,,You could not possibly want more shops than are available at Orchard Road! Shops for all wallets and plenty of places to stop to refuel.
,,Busy and expensive,3.0,,"Well, they are all here... the big brands. It's a shoppers paradise but also VERY expensive (rated the most expensive place to shop in the World apparently). Busy... and lots of people around. It really is just one very long, very busy place."
,,So many shops!,4.0,,"So many shops. Do we really need them all? Still an experience with the noise, colour and sights coming at you from all angles. Every shop you may or may not need allowing you to buy almost anything. Open late with evening shopping allowing an exciting stroll in a illuminated wonderland. Go off into a mall and again shops and eating places everywhere. Try a large store and have a more relaxed wander around. Part of the Singapore experience."
,,Shopping!!,5.0,,"Highly recommend for who love shopping, lot of shopping mall and 5stars hotel, also many of a good restaurants. but it was too crowded!!"
,,Great shopping,4.0,,It caters for all tastes and price tags but high end shopping is the major focus. Easily accessed by train bus and taxi . Traffic is always busy . The far east shopping centre is worth a visit for the golf nuts looking for equipment. The other department stores sell the higher end equipment in their sports section.
,,So much glitter!,4.0,,"What I loved about this place is how HAPPY it looks. It's brightly lit, always bustling with people, musicians singing on the streets, food here and there.. So lively!

There are soooooo many stores here, interconnected malls and something for everyone. Whether you wanna just walk around, window shop and then chilled at a café, to actually hit the stores with a vengeance; orchard road has whatever you need."
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"An iconic street filled with shopping malls, felt it could have been nicer if some of the shops had lined the road rather than been inside large malls."
,,Many malls full of shops,4.0,,"This road is huge and it is crammed with malls. At the beginning I was very excited but in the part of the road where I started there were just two kind of malls, the ones that had luxury brands like cartier, armani, zara... and the ones that had cheap Chinese stuff. Luckily at the end I have found a mall called Plaza Singapura that contained many shops (some of them with video games and manga stuff) and restaurants. Another mall that I liked was Ngee Ann city because it had inside Kinokuniya, an huge library with books and comincs in English, Japanese and Chinese."
,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping.",4.0,,"Actually there are some good local restaurants and cheap beer to be had. Lots of dept stores, Starbucks and it's a shopper's dream come true. The subway runs right along the street so easy to get to, though it can be hard to find a taxi."
,,A great place for shoppers,4.0,,"Orchard road has many shopping malls with numerous brands, many shops that offer expensive brands, and many that offers less expensive ones, so you gat to choose"
,,Great shopping for everyone,4.0,,"This long street has many malls that offer something for everyone. Where comfortable shoes as it will take you all day from one end to the other going into each mall and shops.
Tip: take passport or photo of your passport so you cans get a gst tax claim back receipt at airport for items purchased. Allow extra half hour at airport to do refund but worth doing"
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Great variety of shops. It is what it is, a shopping paradise. Very clean, good supply of taxis and public transport. All the main brands of shops and restaurants."
,,"People, fashion, shops and food",5.0,,"You cannot truly say that you have seen everything that Singapore has to offer if you have not visited Orchard Road. It is a 'must do"" each time we visit Singapore.
During our recent 36 hour stopover in Singapore we managed to squeeze in an hour or two along Orchard Road. As has been our experience, during each of our previous visits, it was jam-packed with people, a combination of locals and tourists all with one thing on their mind - shopping!
Shopping is what Orchard Road is all about. It's all there from the ""high end"" fashion, fashion accessories and jewellery shops through to department stores, small boutiques, electronics stores, gift and souvenir shops. There are also a number of multi-level shopping malls located at various points along the road.
You will not go hungry either. Numerous types of food outlets from high-class restaurants through to fast food outlets offer a plethora of choices.
The only slight downside, if you are a shopping fanatic is that you need to be visiting Orchard Road at the right time of the year to score a bargain. That time is when the sales are on, which usually in the New Year and mid-year. At other times of the year, you may struggle to find a bargain. Prices tend to be quite high compared to other parts of Asia.
If you find the prices to be too high, at least you can enjoy ""watching the world go by"", window shopping and the food."
,,Shopping frenzy,5.0,,Be sure to bring your credit cards and cash cause you won't leave Orchard empty handed... If you're traveling with your wife/girl bring a book or make sure you have wifi access in the stores...
,,"Busy, yet clean",5.0,,"Was here for business purposes .. went up and down this place for a week every day. Busy place and everyone mind's their own business - but hey, that's Singapore"
,,Shooping,5.0,,Well start at one end and enjoy bargin basement to the very top end the choice is yours take your pass port to claim back tax
,,A Singapore Must,5.0,,"Singapore is one of our favorite places to visit in the world. It is neat and organized and everything works as it should.

People are friendly and almost everyone speaks English which makes it much easier to get around.

Be sure to take your credit card and allow more than enough time when you go to Orchard Road. You will find any imaginable thing to buy - great quality products and good prices. All kinds of different restaurants with a variety of great food."
,,"The Filling Station, Orchard Road",1.0,,"Orchard Road is wonderful BUT watch out for The Filling Station on Orchard Road. It is full of dubious people and for the sake of your own health and that of your credit card, stay away. We had our credit cards multiple scammed for over $4,300 AUD."
,,"Orchard Road, Singapore",5.0,,"Orchard Road is the place where you want to see the up and coming happening in Singapore, a lot of restaurants, fancy restaurants and shopping center is all here. Nice atmosphere at night, lots of lights and good looking people roam the streets here. Anyone plan to visit Singapore must make some time to walk around Orchard Road."
,,Good for Shopping,4.0,,This is the centre of Singapore and you find alots of shopping opportunities for all brands you like.
,,Shopping,5.0,,"A lot of malls at Orchard. Business district in Singapore.Great crowd !! I have been there for almost a month. My favorite malls are ION Orchard , Takashimaya and Paragon."
,,Very enjoyable!,5.0,,A great place to go shopping! At night there is a wide choice of restaurants and bars popular with tourists. One bar in particular which was just off Orchard Road was akin to a pop up bar very elegantly done.
,,"Hot and crowded, you need to know where you're going!",4.0,,"The first time, I hated it ! It was way too big, way too expensive, way too hot for me to walk in Orchard Road. Then, I learnt how to know her better, and now I kind of like it ! Of course there are plenty of shops I will never enter (or only out of curiosity) but if you are patient enough to find your happiness, you will like the temple for shopping in Singapore !"
,,Champs Elysees of Singaore !!,4.0,,"If you are shopaholic, this place is not meant for you..Since you will only end up in buying brands and things. on a serious note, this place is amazing with brands, seems like the Champs Elysees of Singapore."
,,Mecca for shoppers,5.0,,"Bubbling with the energy of shoppers, great crowd and shopping places, one can just indulge in some fun window shopping or actual shopping. Love Tangs."
,,Shopping time,5.0,,good place for shopping. spend at least 2 days there. nice and cheap ice-cream. Like takashimaya most
,,Very posh and glittering,5.0,,"One of posh areas of the Singapore city, here you will find lot of malls, hotel and commercial offices. Very active night life, lots of fun and what not? Must visit in night."
,,Great shopping strip,4.0,,"Good shopping strip, a couple of malls either side. All the main international shops. Singapore as a whole is very clean but loved the lush green trees lining the street. Would recommend a shopping trip here if visiting Singapore."
,,Very fun extremely expensive no Taxi,4.0,,"We landed at night on amazing ""Pedestrian night"" which was unique as main road closed for traffic lots of live music and food stalls.Had loads of fun.Shopping extremely expensive I can't afford anything but nice windows! I am sure guys with money would love it Highly recommend night strolling along"
,,Great fun - negotiate hard though,4.0,,"Great place to buy just about anything. Be prepared to negotiate hard, VERY HARD, for example, a camera lens I was looking to buy ended up being just a third of the original asking price"
,,"Shopping, Restaurants, People Watching Extraordinaire",5.0,,"What can you say about Orchard Road? If you love street music, vibrant shops, lovely restaurants and SHOPPING, then this is your place! The wonderful Singapore Metro will get you there and back to where ever you are staying in a flash. But I didn't want to wait that long, so we just stayed on Orchard Rd!"
,,The Shopping Steer of Singapore,4.0,,Orchard Road is a street close to the financial district of Singapore. You can get there by MRT. It is a good place where you can find shopping malls of different price range. Good for clothing shopping.
,,Worth the wait,5.0,,"Had been hearing about the christmas lights for some years. In 2014 I managed to spend a few days in Singapore in time to see the spectacular lights show. Worth the effort as there is indeed a spirit of celebration and lightness of being as you wander completely distracted by the vast array of light displays along Orchard Road. Be prepared for crowds...if you tend more towards the bah humbug notion of Christmas over-celebration and spending you may not enjoy it unless of course you can take your enjoyment form the immersion of others in the experience... It was an experience I am pleased to have had. Cannot comment on the shopping as that is rarely my interest! The Botanic Gardens , however, are a must see and could be the the daytime companion to an after dark experience in Orchard road as they are closeby. Wear walking shows for both."
,,Shopaholics paradise...,5.0,,Its a temple for shopaholics... One can spend a few hours to days and weeks on the Orchard road in Singapore. My personal favourite places are Takashimaya and Orchard mall. These malls have equal number of floors above and below the ground. You need to plan what kinda shopping you wanna do.
,,Widow Shoping,5.0,,"Had to take a walk down this road just for the hell of it.Well what a place to see, heaps of people but still plenty of space. They have parks and rest areas all over the show,and some of these areas we saw people(locals just out for a picnic) and all having good time.Saw some rubbish around but not as much as you would think for the number of people around. There was always some body cleaning up or tending the gardens.The shops were fist class and staff very helpful, you can spend hours if you are that way inclined. You name it and you can find it on this street and thats anything you want, all at a price.Very easy to max out your credit card thats for sure.Dont be in a hurry if you take a stroll sit down and just watch the traffic flow. Not many private vehicles, mainly taxis but all flow so well as do those walking."
,,At least one day of every holiday is spent on Orchard Road.,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a must for shopaholics, what you see on the surface is only the tip of the iceberg. By entering the MRT stations you can enter any of the department stores/shopping malls, and lose yourself on many different levels. I often liken it to an ant's nest, there are so many levels and interconnections with different shopping malls it is sometimes difficult to remember where you are exactly, but as soon as you reach an MRT station things become apparent. Many of the hotels on Orchard Road have more than one restaurant, one for casual dining and another usually on a higher floor, that caters for the smarter set in the evenings."
,,A meca for shopping,5.0,,"You dont have to look any further when you are at Orchard Rd, plenty of exclusive department stores with all well known designer brands as well massiv mall complex where you can easy get lost in, great for bargain look out for seasonal sale signs.
Take some food plenty to offer as well coffee shops in abundance nice to see and shoppe a bit."
,,LOVE WALKING ON THIS STREET,5.0,,"Lots of interesting and nice shops, See culture on this street. Great stores. This city is extremely clean and beautiful. Shopping is an experience you won't forget."
,,SHOPPING MECCA OF SINGAPORE - ORCHARD ROAD,5.0,,They say shopping is national past time of Singapore and if you want to participate in this national activity then you must visit Orchard Road. Its full of malls from budget malls like Lucky Plaza to High End Ion Orchard. Just make sure your wallets are high on cash and bags are empty. Ha ha ha ha.... Must visit attraction in Singapore.
,,Best place for a hotel,4.0,,"Orchard road is a shopper's paradise, has over 50 malls and all the brands you know of plus a lot more and of course it comes with great dining experiences due to the many, many great restaurants there, both fast food and Asian restaurants. Also many affordable and great hotels in the area."
,,Like any typical shopping street in every major city,3.0,,"If you want to shop in Singapore, i guess you can shop here to spare some time. There are better and cheaper places to shop in Singapore."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"There is endless shopping in this area. A shopaholic paradise. Lots of very high end shops, mid-range as well as budget shoppers. As long as you know where to find discount stores in the area. Lots of food places also for any budget. We prefer strolling at night coz Singapore's weather can really be too hot. In my opinion any trip to Singapore is not complete without experiencing what Orchard Road has to offer. There are plenty indeed for all sorts of folks. It's also very accessible via taxi, mrt and buses. One day is not enough to browse on the various stores."
,,Best place to shop and eat in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the centre and main road of Singapore. All the big brands are right here scattered among Takashimaya, Wisma Atria, Ion, Paragon and Mandarin Arcade. There are 4 big hotels along Orchard Road which is Marriot Hotel, Holiday Inn Express, Grand Park Hotel and Meritus Mandarin Hotel. All the restaurants located in the shopping centres in Orchard Road are good ones so eating and shopping is not a problem. Personally i like the food court of Wisma Atria and Ion. Singapore holds a yearly Singapore Great Sale around May to July so look out for great offers. Be sure to ask for GST refund ( tax refund ) each time u shop in Singapore. It's near to go anywhere from Orchard Road. It's easier to catch a cab from Takashimaya as there are a lot of taxis there, just go to the taxi stand"
,,Best place for shopping,5.0,,"Best shopping place for good and branded items. Lots of shopping mall. Must go to Lucky Plaza for cheap shopping. Also, go to OG for best deal."
,,A lovely part of a fantastic City,4.0,,This is a fabulous area for shopping and getting something to eat. It has changed beyond recognition from when I visited last many years ago. a great place which I would recommend anyone to go and have a look at.
,,"busy, busy, busy and tonnes of shopping",5.0,,"we could not believe the number of shops on Orchard Rd, it was July so the sales were on, how can a tiny island have so many exclusive shops.

The shops are beautiful and very modern and clean, go to the basement levels and you will find the supermarkets and cheaper eateries, under the roads there are lovely shops all tunnelled, truly amazing how many shops there area.

There are huge Neon signs at the corners, fantastic to see night time.

the only issues we had was the amount of smokers in Singapore who just leave their butts on the side of the walkways, that is the only thing that Singapore could improve on to be clean. I know it is Asian culture to smoke but please clean up after yourselves, there are bins ever where."
,,It's Totally a Merry Christmas in Orchard Road,5.0,,"Since we came on Christmas, every single street lamp, pillar and even some cars were festooned with Christmas decorations. Plus with the special Christmas offers at shopping malls, the best time for both shoppers and holiday makers is, of course, Christmas!"
,,Singapore- Orchard Road,5.0,,"A 2.2 Km long boulevard, which is one of the most popular shopping place in Singapore. It's a well lit famous tourist attraction. Some of the shopping centers includes DFS Galleria, ION Orchad, Ngee Ann City, to name a few. The best time is during the Christmas time when when the entire road is decorated with Christmas lights."
,,Find anything you want,5.0,,Really you can find whatever you're after on this road. Just check online and see which mall you'd want to go to. Lots of malls are connected to each other so you don't have to walk out at all.
,,The Shopper's Delight,5.0,,"Any foreign trip without shopping is like eating a cake without icing.Orchard Road is the ultimate shopping heaven for all the shopaholics. The road beams with more than 5000 brands, and feels no less than a carnival at night. The street is brightly lit and buzzing with people, that even people not fond of shopping, return back with truckloads of stuff. A must visit for all the fashion lovers."
,,Nice Location,4.0,,"Lots of restaurants, bars and shopping on this road. The get on get off tour bus also stops here. Nice place to spend the afternoon or evening exploring."
,,Retail Tale at the Orchard Road,5.0,,"The brilliant 2 km long shopping extravaganza of the country perhaps begins and ends at the Orchard Road. The Orchard MRT is the nearest MRT to take you to the most happening shopping district in Asia and you possibly cannot afford to miss the Botanic Gardens, Goodwood Park Hotel, TANGS, DFS Galleria Duty Free and the majestic ION Orchard."
,,"Shoping place and green park, well mixing",3.0,,So livesly when I went there. Along the street full of big trees and many park. I have a good place to rest after my big shopping.
,,Shoppers Paradise...if you are smaller,4.0,,"It is like shopping on steroids and we were there during the national sale where people come from all over the area to shop. Many high end name brand shops so you can find what you want ... as long as you are tiny. the sizes are much smaller than american sizes so for a size 12 its tough. One point, the stores are duplicated so you don't have to go far before you find yet another Louis Vuitton store....."
,,Why bother?,1.0,,"You know, you're never gonna but anything here. Seriously. So why bother? Shopping malls compete with each other for the architectural Darwin prize: crass pink marble, monstrous glazing and the curmudgeoning finesse of a Brontosaurus. You could place a badminton Court between each of the handbags in miu miu or pool table between the shoes in Jimmy Choo. OK, so you HAVE to see Orchard Road in Singapore just as you HAVE to see Rodeo Drive in LA. But apart from a brief detour to Emerald Hill Road I see little merit here."
,,"Tired, old and pretty dirty",3.0,,"I think Orchard Road was pretty competitive 20 years ago but while the rest of the great shopping and tourist cities have moved forward, this one seems to be stuck frozen in time including the same Japanese branded department stores and tired old US theme restaurants. Shopping in general has moved to bigger nicer malls everywhere including KL, HK, JK, BKK an even some new developments in Singapore but not here. It almost feels like Orchard Road has sort of inverted into a local and regional focused tier 3 locale..."
,,$¥€£shopping & eating,5.0,,all tourists will visit orchard road......great shopping in many trendy and upmarket air conditioned cool malls but pricey so bring lots of $¥€£ ...highest outside escalator with fabulous view in orchard centre and its one of the few free sights in singapore....the food court in Tangs shopping complex is delicious and good value...happy shopping and eating
,,Tired,2.0,,"Has no end of shopping malls, but all have similar / the same stores. If you go to ION you've pretty much covered it off. Orchard Central has some stores that are a little more funky, but apart from that its very samey. Understand the government is planning a renovation which would be good to bring some new life to the area."
,,Must visit for shopping,4.0,,Great place to go for shopping! Easy to access - only a short bus ride away from Marina Bay Sands. Plenty of ATMs available. Great brands!
,,Never ending shoping!,4.0,,"If you like shoping, come here! Great shopping centers and boutiques on both sides of the road. You will loose track of time here."
,,Modern Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Road is still the hub for shopping but very modern now compared to 20 odd years ago.
Lots of expensive stores - not really my go.
Nice nighttime lighting and very busy feel.
Still some nice older style buildings - Lucky Plaza ( although more modern than last time) but still retains the touting shops and a good basement food court."

,,Shopping paradise for anyone who visits Singapore.,5.0,,Shopping paradise for anyone who visits Singapore. Almost every major International brand has a store on Orchard road. It is pleasing to walk on this street even if you are just window shopping. Eating out paradise as well...
,,You must do,4.0,,You cannot miss Orchard road when in Singapore. It is a must just to see how many people are here during the day and all the time. Shopping is also reccomended.
,,Just like any other shopping area,4.0,,This road is where most people go shopping however I find it is just like any western shopping area only more expensive. There are plenty of nice cafes and restaurants to stop and watch the world go by which is more interesting than the shops
,,Shoppers heaven,5.0,,A great road especially at Christmas when it is all lit up . The Christmas lights are so good. Great shopping . A must go to when in Singapore
,,Shockingly Dull,1.0,,"Singapore is the most advanced economy in South East Asia. Its heart is Orchard Road. If the shape of human development in the Asian century is anything like Singapore then we are heading towards a dullness of spirit from which we may never evolve.

Orchard Road is a shudderingly boring array of shopping malls. Architecturally it is an utter wasteland. The buildings are entirey un-inspiring. In the main the malls sell disappointingly similar products, there are very few areas of interest or the unusual.

Food courts and other eateries along Orchard Road are lifeless. The exotic mix of Padang, Chinese, and Western seems to result in the lowest of each common denominator. Orchard Road is a place to eat the mundane just as it is to soporifically purchase the inane.

Crossing Orchard Road is possible but the underpass system and signage is poor.

There are occasional areas of specific interest for those seeking out a particular type of item but in the main this is a place of department stores and the obvious. For all the hype around Orchard Road it is a shockingly dull place."
,,Orchard Road Ice Cream,4.0,,"One thing that I wont miss everytime I went to Orchard road is getting the Orchard Road Ice Cream. In Orchard rd, you can find the souvenirs with cheap price. Of course you can find the most wanted ""oleh oleh"" for Indonesian tourist, which are Ovomaltine Crunchy Cream and Nutella spread."
,,"Shopper, Foodie and Urban Explorer's Paradise",5.0,,"While traveling in the heart of Singapore, we stayed at Hotel Jen which is situated right on Orchard Street, connected to Orchardgateway. Orchard Road is truly a shopping mecca with 1,000's of stores and many malls and street markets to choose from. When you are famished, you can choose from a seemingly unlimited amount of restaurants, cafe's and street vendors to satisfy your cravings. When in Singapore, take a few hours and explore the Orchard's endless plethora of consumerism. Although your pocket book may regret it, you certainly will not!"
,,Shops shops and more,4.0,,"If you like shopping this is the place to go,shoppers for all tastes and budgets are catered for here and there are many places to eat and drink from high end fine dining to the food courts.
It does get very busy especially at the weekend and on public holidays so if crowds are not your thing stay away."
,,ORCHARD HOTEL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5.0,,"Orchard Road was where I stayed on my first visit to Singapore. The Ochard Hotel is very well located for visitors wishing to Shop-Until-you-drop!! A fabulous array of shops and arcades where you will find most goodies, and moderate to exotically priced items. In one of the Arcades I looked around one of the reputable tailors, selected the cloth, was measured, had a quick trial fit and took delivery at the Orchard Hotel before leving the next morning! GOOD VALUE. And two made to measure shirts! The location of the Orchard Hotel is very convenient, being close to China Town (WELL WORTH A VIST), a huge Shopping Mall, anda pleasant walk to the Boat Quay with a great number of places of interest and fascinating Restaurants.
Needless to say, The Hotel also has Excellent Dining, and the Accomodations is VERY GOOD."
,,Nothing else like this !,5.0,,"Best shopping street in the world !!! No need to turn, just wald traight up and you will find all brand here, close late is a plus. Item is a bit pricey !"

,,Could spend a week here!!!,5.0,,"Have an idea what shops you want to go to and where they are. Starting one end will take days to get to the other. Something for everyone from designer, casual, sport, $2 shops, food, department stores etc...enjoy!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Great location if you love shopping and eating. This road has 20 malls on it. The malls cater for different tastes, a but of research for favourite brands would help before hitting the road."
,,Just shops,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a road of high class shops that you will see in any major city. There were a selection of sculptures along the road when we went and as it was near Valentine Day, there were lots of displays of hearts and flowers. If you like 'posh' shopping this is the place for you but for me it was nothing special."
,,Synthetic Appeal Disappoints!,3.0,,"Orchard Road, the upmarket locality in Singapore, is beautiful but exudes a synthetic appeal. What I find most lacking in this city is its warmth to tourists. I missed my stop during a drop back trip from Sentosa Islands. Being a tourist visitor and a lone female one at that, I tried asking people at bus stops for help but no one was forthcoming to provide me with correct information on how to reach my hotel."
,,Malls Malls Malls = Shopping Shopping Shopping,5.0,,"Its amazing to be in Orchard Road Singapore , all malls are almost interconnected underground. And you move from one mall to another by simply walking through its interconnected underground walkways. Though you will find malls within and without Orchard Road , the Big Brands can be found here. Try visiting Singapore Orchard Road when the GSS ( Great Singapore Sale) is on going and get the BEST bargains of your life. Goods and merchandise are at 30-50-70-80% off and for GAP at ISETANN we were able to buy several stuff for a steal , imagine at 80% off and getting an additional 10-20% if you buy 6 or more !!! its like getting it for FREE , well almost !!! And if you're not the ""shopping type"" just walking through Orchard Road will overwhelm you , its one mall after another. The sidewalks are wide and clean, there are a lot of trees ( is'nt it amazing ? lush trees in the midst of a concrete jungle) and just before the sun sets in the late afternoon , flocks of birds make that noise that seems to signal the coming of evening...Orchard Road never seems to sleep and that's what makes it simply amazing!!!"
,,Orchard Road - Great Shopping Precinct,5.0,,"Amazing shopping, from your high end shopping to your every day shops! Transportation was great, really easy to get to with the MTR."
,,"Yes, you must visit this during your visit to Singapore, it has it all morning, noon and night...",4.0,,"yes! worth a walk up and down, morning, noon or night. always loads of people, loads of shops, places to eat and just around the corner from some nice residential areas. we stayed at the Grove apartments which was quite residential, but just a few minutes walk to Orchard Road, which really has it all. A must visit for anyone going to Singapore. Always interesting."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,We could certainly not have imagined this road! Every store you can imagine for ultimate luxury all the way through to H&M. We loved it! A real shopping experience!
,,Great shopping area,4.0,,"As you know it was not many things to do here in Singapore. Shopping therapy is one of my favorite when I getting bore. Along street full of small shops, malls and food stalls. It just like a all in one place."
,,There's something for everyone (and cheap ice-cream),4.0,,"Not the most affordable, but you can find pretty much all the good brands here. Orchard Road is very well connected through all the underpasses, and you could theoretically walk almost anywhere in Orchard in full air-conditioning. Shop till you drop with GSS and look out for Pedestrian Nights.

There's a shopping mall for everyone there - if you're looking for high-end luxury goods then you have Ion Orchard, if you want a departmental store there's Takashimaya (Ngee Ann City) and if you're bargain hunting Far East Plaza and the Filipino-friendly Lucky Plaza are pretty cheap.

My strongest recommendation wouldn't be any particular mall or shopping centre but rather the one-dollar ice cream you can spot on the streets. Cubes of ice cream sold with bread, waffles or in cups won't taste mind-blowingly amazing, but they really satisfy tourists and locals alike and help them deal with the weather."
,,A lot of shops,4.0,,Nice road to Central Singapore. A lot of shops of famous brands and a lot of restaurants and bars. When visiting Singapore you should pass here once.
,,Retail Gone Crazy!,5.0,,"If you're an ardent shopper this is the place for you.
A walk along Orchard Road is like visiting Southland AND Chadstone Shopping Centres ... each kilometre ...... FOR SIX KILOMETRES!!!!
It's a great experience ... but you are unlikely to get a good deal until you venture into Little India or China Town!!"
,,Suggested shopping route from Orchard MRT,5.0,,"Many of the shopping malls are connected by underpasses hence it is easy for people to move around rain or shine. You may plan your shopping trip with the following suggested route starting from Orchard MRT:

ION (High End brands) => Wisma Atria (with Isetan departmental stalls) => Ngee Ann City (High End brands + Takashimaya Departmental) => cross the road to Mandarin Gallery (High End plus Interesting brand names) => cross the road to H&M flagship store at Orchard Building =>cross to road to 313@Somerset which is connected to Orchard Central via Orchard gateway which houses many local designer brand names.

There are many restaurants, eateries and café in the malls for you to rest your feet and fill your rumbling tummies so take your pick along the way!

This is just one suggested route. There is the other side of the road where there are malls as well as the other direction. Orchard Road is indeed a shoppers' paradise."
,,Good for spending half a day.,4.0,,"You can spend may be half a day here. Very good for shopping. Many malls and all kinds of food can be found here. Nothing much for sight seeing, just typical shopping and food area."

You can literally walk down from Dhoby Ghaut station through to Somerset to Orchard Road station and even down to Tanglin. There are malls on both side of the road and shops underground as well. If you are serious about shopping through everything, one day is definitely not enough. Even though the brands repeat themselves, you will still get enough to see. And not forget the food too. The food prices are higher than your average because most are cafes and restaurants."
,,Too much shopping!,3.0,,"There are a lot of shops, so plan carefully. Make sure you do your research. I preferred Suntec, Vivo and even Bugis shopping malls. Somerset@313 wasn't too bad"
,,Shopping galore,3.0,,Orchard road is one long line of shopping malls. Some are high end some are medium. It is ok for a short time but gets very old after some time.

Malls run the length of this street, with hundreds, if not thousands, of shops and department stores stuffed full of everything you could wish for, from high-end fashion goods and accessories, jewellery, furniture and home goods to local shoppers' malls. Even if you can't afford to shop in the most upmarket stores like those in ION, it's enlightening to see how the other half lives!

It is, understandably, an extremely busy place so if you should need to rest a while and take stock of your purchases, there are also many food courts, serving every different kind of food you could hope for, from coffee and cake, ice-cream, snack meals and full meals.

We went during the day and then again on Saturday evening as on the first Saturday of every month, a large section of Orchard Road is closed off and becomes a pedestrian zone from 6pm to 11pm. It had a different vibe altogether- jam-packed, with a festive atmosphere, with balloon animal makers, buskers, bands playing on a stage, street vendors selling cold drinks and icecream and a DJ playing music, announcing events for the evening and of course, special offers from some of the stores! It was quite cool!

Orchard Road is a must-see place, just to say you've been even if you don't intend to shop till you drop!"
,,Expect to max out your credit card.,4.0,,"If you are the type of person who enjoys shopping (which assumes anyone with a pulse) then this is your place. There is too much to take in with only a one day trip. I showed great restraint in keeping my credit card in my wallet. (Of course my luggage is already filled to the brim). This is a must see for anyone looking for a new and fashionable wardrobe, or an upgrade of your furnishings or just sparkly bobbles."

,,Not that great,2.0,,"Probably more my fault as I'm really not a big shopper but I found Orchard Road to be repetitive; high-end designer shops and just a general overload. So many Rolex shops!

,,Hustle and bustle,3.0,,"Crowded, busy - it really is not worth it, but every visitor to Singapore heads to Orchard Rd like a magnet. For me, I prefer the upmarket malls such as ION but downmarket places such as Lucky Plaza, even though old-style and crowded are actually worth a quick visit."

,,Singapore Fling,5.0,,"It took us two days to take in the shops of Orchard Road. We did one side one day and came back and did the opposite side the next.
There are bargains to be had in the multilevel department stores as well as the boutiques, so ensure you peruse all of the shops.
We caught the local buses (make sure you buy a multi-day pass for cheaper travel) for when we had the time to get to wherever it was we wanted to go, but taxi's are reasonable because of their one-way system in the city centre."

Love to shop? There's tons of shopping center. From Lucky Plaza to Takashimaya/ION Orchard
Hungry? There's a hawker center beside Concorde Hotel, padang padang resto in ION Orchard's food court (I forgot the name). Anyway padang padang got the cheapest option for meal. Only about $5 or $7 and your belly will thank you.haha.
Craving for dessert, there are tons of $1 ice cream (but not exactly $1 anymore. Inflation, right? Lol)
There are 3 MRT Stations across orchard, Dhoby Ghaut (below Plaza Singapura), Somerset (Below 313 @ Somerset), and Orchard Station (Below ION Orchard)

,,A must for shopping,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and Orchard Road is a great place to spend a day. Lots of Malls like ION, Wisma, Paragon and more. High street chains like Topshop and H&M to designer shops like Prada and Gucci to suit every budget. Plenty of places to grab coffee and lunch too. Orchard road has a great buzz at the weekend and has stunning Christmas decorations over the holiday period."

,,"Malls, malls, still malls",1.0,,"For shopping majority of shops in Orchard Road can be found even in Changi Airport. Shops after shops after shops... I used to visit Orchard Road, simply because the places and activities to do in Singapore is so limited. In the neighbourhood, there are malls. In CBD, still malls. Frankly speaking I will rather shop at supermarkets in European cities (Spar/COOP/Rimi/Kiwi) and the one at Flughafen Frankfurt then shopping at Orchard. Simply because I am just so tired of them!"

It is pleasant just to walk a,one this famous street, it is also used by the locals so it is often crowded especially on the weekends.
A must see though."
,,Not for me,2.0,,"I'm not a big shopper but my wife loves it, but Orchard Road didn't really hold much appeal. We didn't really attempt the shopping experience and didn't venture too far so maybe we just missed it, but nothing really appealed to us too much from what we saw. There were shopping centres like plenty of other cities, some were horribly overcrowded and it really just didn't do a lot for us. Getting across (or in fact under) the road itself at the corner of Orchard/Scotts/Patterson was a nightmare."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a wonderful area with both high end shopping as well as many under the street areas with shops and dining establishments. It is worth spending a few hours here when visiting Singapore.

If visiting during Christmas, the decorations and lights are all spectacular as well."

Conveniently located food courts will help you fill up intermittently.

Do this for sure if you have time to stay, can take up more than 4-5 hours if you are a serious shopping buff."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Mall after mall after mall, so many shops and the entire SMRT branches underground are full of shops as well. The prices were higher than home for many items, so we didn't buy too much, but the selection of food at the food courts was impressive."
,,Interesting buildings but fairly typical of many large modern cities,3.0,,"Lively city street with some interesting architecture. We managed to get a bit lost in an underground section which we thought was just an underpass to avoid the traffic, but routes seemed to go off in lots of different directions."
,,Must visit.,5.0,,"On every trip to Singapore i make at least one trip to Orchard rd. Its one of the most exotic shopping destinations in the world. Huge variety of shops and food of every description, and very very safe. Just remember it will be 30-35 degrees in high humidity , thats all."

Quite a scene at Christmas with the lights, trees, and all.

,,take a walk in the evening,5.0,,"Orchard Road is very alive in the evenings. You will enjoy the walk along the shops, restaurants and department stores and the amazing lightning of shops, gardens and buildings. We where very impressed by the atmosphere there. So do not miss it on one of your evenings in Singapore. During daytime it is less impressing."
,,Loved Orchard Road. Shopping paradise!,5.0,,Orchard road definitely a must visit place while in Singapore. Very modern and the shopping is incredible. Able to shop all the high end stores in one place. I definitely recommend tourists to visit. Street food along Orchard road isn't bad as well!

,,Family fun!,4.0,,"FUN BUSTLING AREA OF THE CITY, enjoy walking shopping and lunch. We had a great time and found some lovely things to bring home."
,,Avoid.,1.0,,Just another giant shopping mall. Everything else in Singapore was great. Just another street full of overhyped designer goods.
,,Shopping Mecca,4.0,,Easy to get to either by MRT or the hop on hop off red bus. Lots of shopping malls with various themes to International brand shopping.

I love the architecture of ION Plaza from outside, specially ask taxi driver drop me at night to view the lovely shape of ION Plaza...."
,,luxurious upscale shopping district,5.0,,"Its the prime shopping district in Singapore. my favourite shopping is takashimaya as the department store offers interesting imported food in basement and offer everything you need. Ion us the shopping center you end up when u arrive at orchard mrt station. Mostly filled with designer shops like prada. Gucci and the likes. For dining try nam nam at wheelock , it's connected to ion basement. Other food and reasonable prices eating place include Bangkok jam at wheelock, food court in wisma and takashimaya basement.for filipine fare. Try lucky plaza jollibee and the basement foodcourt. Orchard road shopping are often overpriced and locals don't do much shopping there unless they are there specifically for imported stuffs or branded accessories and clothes. It's a good place if you atevlookinh for high quality stuffs and more upscale shopping experience. for real Singapore experience. Try heartland places like Chinatown, little India, bugis where locals and tourists both alike find delicious and reasonable prices items."
,,Good place for window shopping,5.0,,"This is the place to be , if you are into window shopping, all the high end showrooms with the most luxurious brands and also very many nice and clear eating places"
,,This has changed!,5.0,,A very much changed Orchard Road compared to my youth when I lived there! CK Tang the department store has changed but they did included the original pagoda roofs on the new building. We walked up the road and did enjoy this although it was a bit warm.

,,great shopping area,4.0,,wow what a shopping meka . Cheap and top quality. Love Miss Empire shop. Just as good as Hongkong. Shops have very good selection .
,,The Rodeo Drive of Singapore,5.0,,Take a walk down orchard road and you will be in awe of the number of shops and restaurants on Orchard road. You can find anything from street fare in a hawker center to a wonderful choice of Dim Sum to exclusive dining. For a real experience visit Ion Plaza and experience shopping and dining five floors up and 5 floors below ground level but be careful not to get lost!! I lived in Singapore 2 years and never could visit all the places along Orchard Road. Try an area called Emerald Hill for a quant area for drinks during happy hour after shopping. This is a must see for all visitors as is Marina Bay and the night safari.
,,Class at its best,4.0,,"The hub of brand shopping in Singapore. Orchard road is a place you must visit if not for shopping but for window shopping. The high rise buildings and well lit stores make it a happening place. Do try the ice cream with bread and biscuit which the vendors on the sides sell, worth the money."
,,Shoppers delight,5.0,,"Shops shops and more shops. If you like shopping, then don't miss. Nice vibe and lots of people around. Lots of restaurants as well."
,,Endless shopping!,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore and in the mood for shopping, this is the place to be! Takashimaya and Ion are my personal favourites, as most of the malls do tend to cater for exclusive brands, a bit expensive for the typical tourist."
,,Definitely best place for shopping,4.0,,"One can hop from one mall to the next on Orchard Road. They vary from being pricy and upscale, to cheaper alternatives. Within the malls are many restaurants. You can shop and eat well at the same time!
We used the MRT and exited at a Orchard Road. Very convenient. There are many stores underground. To cross the street, you have to look for underground pedestrian tunnels. We went to Paragon and shopped at M and S and Warehouse. For lunch, we went to Imperial Treasure Super Peking Duck in the same mall. There are so many malls and stores that it us impossible to cover all of them in a day."
,,Burstling with life,5.0,,"Orchard Rd is an iconic shopping strip in Singapore. It has everything imaginable and more. Caution is recommended as there are many not so trustworthy shops on the strip. Know what you want and how much it costs at home before committing to a purchase and check on warranty coverage. Otherwise, soak it all up!"
,,Just for the Shopperholic,4.0,,"If you feel sunny Singapore is just too hot for your liking, try some shopping at the famous Orchard road. The just so easy to navigate shopping belt is lined with dozens of shopping malls from the most chic brands to the simply affordable stuff. Not to be missed, the thousand different types of cuisines available at the malls is just too delectable to be missed."
,,SHOPAHOLICS DREAM,5.0,,"What a road.... The old saying ""shop till you drop"" depicts this road to a tee. From the old stalwarts ie Lucky Plaza, Far East Plaza to the stunning new Orchard Gateway where you dont even have to leave the shopping centre as there are so many retail outlets....personally I would prefer a mans room situated on every floor so that i could go and have a beer whilst the other half shops...So we have about 2 km of shops along with big wide footpaths to cater for all the pedestrians. Now a lot of shops don't open untill 10 and the reason for this is that they close around 9.45 pm....Apparently thats really great news for shopaholics. Very clean with refreshing bursts of icy cold air cond as you pass the front doors of these mega shops. Lots of bus stops available to reach from one end to the other bearing in mind it is a 1 way street"
,,Good for shopping but expensive.,4.0,,Nothing to do in Singapore but to walk on this road. Many shops and restaurants. Taxi is very easy. Souviner shops are plenty at Lucky Plaza.
,,Most active part of the city.,5.0,,"This is a must visit part of the city. Orchard Road is a of the most beautiful street, with huge shady trees covering both sides of the street. Pedestrian ways on both sides are very wide and clean. This is the place you can find modern, high end stores and traditional bargain stores. Also a place you can find all kinds of hocher-foods in air conditioned food courts. Restaurants of many cuisine from different countries are located here, but there usually very expensive."
,,Shopping addicts will certainly enjoy,3.0,,"Got to about, I am not too fancy about shopping. If you hit the desire to go for the big brands, you will have obtrusive of choice. Also smaller and cheaper ones available in the many malls - sometimes a little deeper look may be worth it. In the end it us I've huge stretch if shops and eateries. As one of the main attractions in Singaporean and as a status symbol, it is definitely clean, organized and pretty safe also at night. Suggest to explore the local bars at night, ask around for which ones are the nice ones. Orchard towers have the image to be a prostitute place, but once been there with male and female friends, we have not really had that impression. I guess it's a must-do to see the orchard road once you are in Singapore."
,,Touristy but clean,4.0,,"Shopping and more shopping...some interesting characters here that you don't see elsewhere because of all the tourists. This was an OK place to visit during the day. The streets are blocked off so you have to navigate the various underground shopping mall tunnels to get to the other side at som for browsing around and souvenirs (for some reason locals dislike Filipinos) . Orchard towers are sleazy; you're not missing out on shopping or eating there. Just be mindful taxis can be hard to get at peak times here, you can't flag one down you have to queue at a stand."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,Perfect for all kinds of shopping. Soooo much choice. Recommended whatever you want you will find in Orchard Road. Just the best !!!!!
,,Must go for all Tourists,4.0,,Orchard road is a must go for all tourists as it symbolises the spirit of Singapore and paradise for shoppers. With malls all along the road it also has some good options for foodies as well
,,Lucky Plaza,2.0,,"Overrated. A rabbit warren of the same shops over and over, floor after floor. I am an Aussie, and there was nothing there to impress me. Even had to pay to use the bathroom... Didn't bother with any more malls on Orchard Road, took the train to Bugis where the shops are much better although still could find nothing to impress me. Depends what you are shopping for I guess. I wasn't looking for anything special just something to interest me at a reasonable price. Didn't get it..."
,,The shopping place!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the place to go for non stop shopping in Singapore. You can walk mall after mall and shop till you drop. During this time of the great singapore sale, it's an even better time to be at orchard road!"
,,Fabulous Singapore,5.0,,"If its shopping you want, then this road is for you. Especially at christmas time the whole street is decorated, Awesome!!
We love singapore, been there many times, everything so clean and We always feel able to roam without fear of muggers. going back 2016 cant wait"
,,Uncomfortable experience,2.0,,"Last week I went to Orchard Road via MRT; I haven't come here for several years. And I was disappointed because there were a lot of smokers along the road and almost all seat were occupied by smokers, shockingly a lot of them are women.
This made me feel very uncomfortable and my memory of a clean street and clean air of Orchard Road is no more, you can smell smoke everywhere except near the malls entrance. The government must realize the impact cause by those smokers; it bring hazardous environment to kids, pregnant women, elderly, etc.
I hope the government impose higher tax on tobacco and enforce stricter law regarding smoking; especially in a place like Orchard Road"
,,Orchard Road Singapore,5.0,,"Hmm for shopper don't miss this shopping area. Just visit and pick your choose up and pay . If you see offering at the cashier, like buy something special price and you choose it, please make sure the staff put on your bag. Because my experience the staff forgot 1 item that I purchase and paid. And I have no time to come back to the store. Many special offers with same shops but different types. Some other offer special price at the cashier stuff ... grab it because sometime you will not find the same things at the different branch store either the location is same mall complex
Happy shopping guys .."
,,The shopping stretch of Singapore,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore then you should keep at least a day for Orchard road. It's a must do for shopaholics. So many malls on a single stretch one after the other. It starts from The Tanglin mall on one end to Plaza Singapura Mall on the other. Every mall is unique and the best time to visit this road is during Christmas provided if it's not raining. Other malls on this road are Takashimaya/ Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Somerset, ION, Orchard Central, Forum all are worth a visit. So many malls and so many brands and so much shopping to do. All the malls have wonderful food courts and restaurants. Every cuisine is available. Just check and individual mall directory to find out about the restaurants. It's a shopping den for locals and tourists alike. Every time we end up finding nee promotions and sale. It will surely impress you with the variety and promotions it offers. For all your handbags, dresses, clothes, shoes, accessories and children stuff don't forget to explore this area. A must do for everyone."
,,"Shops, shops and more shops !",3.0,,Not all it's cracked up to be - yes there are shops and malls but having seen one you've seen them all. The shops deal with all price ranges so there is something for everyone. If you with a lady guys then you'll have no choice but to go !
,,See it around Christmas,5.0,,"This is a really great place to be during the Christmas season. I love Christmas lights and Orchard Road does not disappoint. If you get the chance, check it out. I've been there twice when it's all lit up. Can't wait for the 3rd time."
,,u dont go to Singapore if u dont go to Orchard,5.0,,"This Orchard Road has international reputation as a shopping and leisure destination. Branded, local designers, vintage and unique stuffs, u can find here. Also perfect for strolling around, enjoying ice cream or kebab from street hawkers. Love love love Orchard!"
,,Oxford Street on steroids!,3.0,,"London's Oxford street on steroids, if you love shopping you'll love this street! However you may tire fairly quickly of the constant stream of western stores with higher price tags than int he UK or US so I wouldn't spend long here."
,,Shop till you drop.....,4.0,,"This is 'THE' place to go to shop, shop and shop till you drop. Plenty of malls to suit everyone and it's best to allocate at least 2 days to explore this famous road. Best time to go is during Singapore Sale and during Christmas where the road will be brightly lit up and bargains plentiful.....Do not just shop, but spare time to eat, eat, eat and drink, drink and drink too..."
,,Just shopping malls.,3.0,,"Just shopping malls. It is filled with international brands. Why travel all the way to Singapore to visit shopping malls when you can visit shopping malls in your own country. I think you can come here at night when you dont have any other attractions to visit.

You can visit ""Ion Sky"" when you are at Orchard road."
,,One of Asia's Premier Shopping area,5.0,,My last free day in Singapore coincided with the start of the Great Singapore Sale. Didn't really have the chance to go to as many shopping centers/malls because of lack of time as well as the hot weather. Still enjoyed the place with its wide sidewalks dotted with various coffee and tea houses. A sign of the times was the closing down of a big bookstore in Wheelock Place along Orchard and Scott Roads. The area can get crowded so best to get anearly head start. Still a great area to wander around!
,,Best markets,5.0,,If you want the cheapest shopping in Singapore go to the Orchard Rd markets. Best done at night to experience the atmosphere. It is very busy loads of fun. You need plenty of time to take it all in. Heaps of cheap eating places.
,,Shop 'til you drop... Literally!,5.0,,"If you love to shop, eat, then shop some more then this is the place to go. You'll find anything and everything here. I think we stayed here all day long and there were still other shops that we wanted to see. The layout is a bit confusing though. Plus if you are planning to buy those high end brands and you are planning to go to Hong Kong, it's a little bit more reasonable to purchase them in Hong Kong. But there's lots of other stuff here that are reasonably priced and restaurants too."
,,Popular place with tourists and locals,3.0,,"This area is crowded not only by tourists but also by locals as well. Lining both sides of the road are well-known departmental stores like Robinsons, Takashimaya, Metro, OG and many others. Blocks of shopping malls lined the road from one end to the other end. Best time to visit is in June where they have the Great Singapore Sale and December where the long stretch of road are decorated brightly with glittering lights."
,,Too many high-end stores,1.0,,"Orchard Road was a disappointment. How many Guccis and Pradas does one road need? It's spectacular to see the size of these shops, but what good would that do when hardly anyone actually goes in, or let alone, purchase anything in these shops."
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",3.0,,"No matter what your budget is, you will find a suitable shop here. There are shops and shopping centres lining the entire area. Orchard Road is much more modern than a number of other Singapore districts and has been hyped up to be ""The place to shop in Singapore"". If you are after a bargain, you will find them with effort but Orchard Road is not generally the place to find a bargain. It is a road that attracts many tourists and their tourist dollar. Two MRT stations (Orchard and Somerset) and numerous public buses service the area. A free bus operates 7 days a week from the Orchard MRT bus stop to and from the Great World City shopping centre (check the Great World City for details)."
,,Got to go,4.0,,"Anybody who visits Singapore has to take a walk down here! Shops and bars galore, even little alleys which open up onto more bars. It was so bright even on an evening, the birds sing and a must is the end of orchard rd! You have to visit four floors ( lady boys and women selling themselves) as this is an experience you will not see in many places"
,,Christmas is Best,4.0,,"The buzz of Orchard Road is great all-the-year-round, but at Christmas time they really pull out all the stops and its well worth taking an open-topped bus ride to enjoy the colours and sounds. The shops are varied, I prefer to eat at 'hawkers' always fresh and very good value, but Orchard Rd. has lovely places to eat, great coffee & cake places too."
,,Must see,4.0,,We enjoyed looking but if you want cheap avoid the brand shops and go into the shopping malls cheap food gifts and just about anything else. The Aussie dollars not to good at present but you can still find bargains
,,Potential to overwhelm the senses.,5.0,,"So much choice! With 42 or so shopping malls you need a bit of time to experience a good selection of these. Lucky Plaza if you want the old style mall with multitudes of specialty shops. Be warned, Sunday is when the Philipino girls, house maids etc, have their day off and meet here; thousands of them! The other major malls are well serviced and most have very Nic Nic resturants and food halls."
,,Shopaholics heaven,5.0,,"Everything you could possibly want to buy is on Orchard Road, from high end (thank you LV for my gorgeous new handbag) to inexpensive souvenir shops. Make sure if you see steps leading down from the footpath you go and explore as there can be some amazing little shops in these arcades. We thought Singapore was on a par price wise with Australia, remember you get what you pay for, its also handy to know your prices if you are shopping for something specific so you can truly compare."
,,"There are better places to shop in Asia, even in Singappre",3.0,,"Orchard Road has been hyped over the years. It has been publicised by word of mouth as THE shopping destination in Asia. I couldn't disagree more. There are a lot of malls and stores here on the stretch. You can window shop and ship until you cannot walk anymore. But with the currency fluctuations over the last couple of years Singapore isn't cheap anymore. People used to come here to buy original branded clothes because they were cheaper. Nothing is cheap anymore. We spent some time at Jems mall and found that area to be more pocket friendly. It is like going to Paris and going to the Eiffel tower. Its something that everyone must do to tick it off their list, but not the best, overall, value for money shopping experience."
,,The heaven for shopping lovers.,4.0,,"If you really enjoy shopping things, this is one of the must-visit places. There is a large number of shops that you can walk in with nothing in your both hands and walk out with shopping bags. Enjoy :)"
,,The most famous street in Singapore,4.0,,"Who hasn't heard of Orchard road ..... One of the iconic streets of Singapore. A tourist must definitely visit it even if u don't plan on shopping here. This road is lined by malls on both sides and just a walk down orchard at night is truly amazing . With lights all around and big screens showing movie trailers it reminds one of Times Square( not sure if the comparison is apt;)...
We visited Orchard central , Orchard gateway, Takashimaya, Ion Orchard . Ion was the best of the lot and has an Aaaaamazing food mall.
There's Lucky plaza on orchard which looks like it's seen better days but is an excellent place to shop for gifts.. Chocolates, bags, souvenirs and bags.Very cheap and good quality.
You may not want to shop much on orchard but a visiting it is a must.. Don't leave Singapore without a walk down Orchard Road...,,"
,,Good retail experience and wonderful choices of food,5.0,,"In the last few years, seen few construction activities in the Orchard / Somerset Road vicinity. No longer the case as major developments are completed and retail experience to the consumers are getting better. One thing for sure - with so much more retail space, it is certainly less crowded nowadays, enhancing the shopping and service experience."
,,It used to be unique...,3.0,,"It used to be unique (I have made many visits during last 20 years) but today you will see all the same brands as in other big city in the world. And prices will be similar to elsewhere in the world
So I will suggest using Changi Airport instead. Or some web shopping to get a better deal.
But still an interesting place to go - to look at the shoppers - and also look out and take photos of the ""shopaholic signs"" with their emergency numbers - this for me is the biggest find ;o)"
,,Very busy,4.0,,"This street is crazy busy. You can spend a little or a lot here, of both your time and money. There is something for everyone"
,,Much better than Oxford Street,5.0,,"Reluctantly, I admit that Orchard Road is a much better place to shop than Oxford Street in London, and the shop assistants are more friendly too.

Yes, Singapore seems expensive, but bargains can be found (e.g. H&M) as well as excellent Asian food at reasonable prices. But a day walking around is tiring in the humid air, so make sure you rest at intervals in One of the many coffee shops (try Providore in the Mandarin Gallery)."
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,"Where do I begin - first find a hotel close by., if you're on a stopover - there are some great deals through Singapore airlines. I usually stay either at Mandarin Orchard or Royal Plaza on Scott Hotel as they are located within walking distance to some of my favourite malls along Orchard Road. You can practically use the underpass to get from one shopping mall to another. I would suggest to try shopping early (most stores open around 10am-10pm) as the crowd start building up from 4pm. I usually start shopping at ION City ( a mix of high end designer clothing from Dior , Chanel and much more to the more mainstream shopping eg H & M, Zara, Topshop, Mango etc) and work my way towards Wisma Atria then Ngee Ann City, Somerset 311 and beyond. All these malls are situated along Orchard Road. The MRT system is efficient and convenient to use if you need to shop in another area. . Don't be afraid to try out the Food Hall at Ion City and Wisma Atria - an opportunity to savour some local food. Good luck!"
,,Shopping in the heart of SIngapore,4.0,,This place is considered the premier shopping area in Singapore. Many big shopping centres are here. Place is crowded throughout the day. Of course cost of things here is of a premium. Food is available throughout the day.
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Luxury items all at this area. Singapore main shopping district. Massive malls and super crowded. U can really shop till u drop. Or u can just window shop, take a walk. Have fun"
,,The Oxford Street of Singapore,5.0,,this is the mecca of modern retail and this road has endless amount of mall and entertainment on this road. my personal favorite is the Takashimaya Mall. it is epitome of luxury
,,A great place to shop and dine!,5.0,,"The same old Orchard road I've known for almost 20 years.. You want genuine / authentic bags and shoes , Platinum, Wisma Atria , Robinsons etc. It was the season of the great Singapore sale and fashion week. The Orchard road never fails to excite me !"
,,shopping,4.0,,Plenty of shopping but not if you want to find a bargain. All very expensive. I found it to be very American but with a much higher price tag
,,shops galour,5.0,,"although orchard road is a lovely place, its also very expensive as well, with mostly designer shops, although i did manage to bag myself a bargain pair of fab shoes in robinsons store, $49.90, plus got 10% off as well....
so if you like designers then you'll love that place, ita long road to walk as well, which isn't very nice when its a boiling hot day, or pouring with rain!!"
,,High end and expensive,4.0,,"HIgh end shops galore here. This is the most expensive shopping strip in the world and its easy to see why. Gucci, Chanel, Tiffany, Miu Miu....the list goes on. Lots of shopping malls and if you are a photographer then the window dispalys are always a must to see. Unless you are made of money, just look around and window shop at a world that few people can experience"
,,Shopoholic's Paradise- brand lovers,3.0,,"For brand lovers, this street is good as you get all the brands here. So its like shop till you drop, make sure to carry your cards... :)"
,,So many Shops,4.0,,I didn't think it was possible for me to run out of shopping power and then I met Orchard Road - WOW - shopping on steroids - everything you could possible need in one street! Worth a visit and bring your wallets!!
,,Know where & when to look for good buys in Orchard Road.,4.0,,"Orchard Road is not necessarily only well known for selling expensive branded goods/food. There are also medium to low end goods/food but one must know where & when to look for good buys.

Ion Orchard, Paragon, Mandarin Gallery, Robinsons at Heeren are some of the upmarket shopping centres, selling branded or expensive products.

For mid range products, go to Centrepoint, OG Department Store, 313 Mall, Orchard Central, Orchard Gateway & Plaza Singapura. Ngee Ann City & Wisma Atria has a mix of high to mid range shops including Takashimaya. Stand-alone retailer H & M offers value buys too.

Look out for sales, which takes place often throughout the year. There is also the annual Great Singapore Sale, around end May till end July. Often when there are sales, one can get very good bargains on certain products. Really worthwhile buys.

For cheap products, go to Far East Plaza. This mall is located in Scotts Road, few minutes walk from Orchard Road/Tangs Marriot Hotel. Here you will find many small shops/varieties/food with cheap or reasonably good prices. But don't expect high end products here. Lucky Plaza is another low end mall but varieties & range very limited.

Come during Christmas & Orchard Road is beautifully decorated & lit up for Christmas."
,,Busy Orchard Road,3.0,,"Many shopping malls, lots of brand, convenient mrt that link to the shopping malls, busy road with lots of cars and people. Love the ice cream potong stall outside the mall, yummy ice cream with bread, must try!"
,,"More shopping, More fun!!",3.0,,"This is heaven for shopaholic people. Bring a lot of money, coz i was ran out of money when I visited here :) Everything you need is here. :)"
,,Orchard Road Review,5.0,,"stunning location. as almost all other people suggest, its a shoppers paradise. lots of amazing stores of international brands. the entire street is such a lively place. you will be amazed with every store that you pass especially the Gucci and LV stores. There is a cinema/movie theatre at the end of the road which is also amazing. lot of restaurants on the road so you can energize yourself for a the whole day of indulgence.
its an exciting road, something that you will not find often. Fantastic experience."
,,Good shopping experience if you want to buy brands,4.0,,"On orchard road, there are many shopping malls which are huge....most of the brands are available....If you want to shop brands then orchard road is perfect for you.

Even of you just want to do window shopping, it will be a good place to spend your time."
,,Expensive part of the city,4.0,,"Full of ""rich and famous "" shops that will make your money disappears in minutes! You can also find some less expensive brands and make sure you eat in one of the malls, the food is wonderful and plenty to choose from."
,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping!!",4.0,,"The place to eat, and shop! What else can be said about Orchard Road? Shopping, shopping and more shopping!"
,,Hell on Earth!,1.0,,"Avoid at all costs unless you want to go shopping for the same old stuff you can get in any city across the globe! The streets are busy, its hot & humid and likely to be raining! There is so much to do in Singapore, why bother going to the same shops you can visit anywhere!"
,,all the global brands,5.0,,313 is worth a look - right up the top. My friend is an ex pat and knew that each level higher you go the prices get cheaper so if you are a bargain hunter keep going up those escalators!
,,the way to see city life of Singapore,4.0,,"very clean road. It is a way to see the city life of Singapore. There are many top brands on this road. If comparing the price, I think the price of same product in Changi airport is cheaper. The local food on the street is nice. But if you want the real meal or feast, it is better to go to Chinatown."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"Everything youve ever wanted or looking for is within walking distance. Lots of shops from designer labels to small brands. Also electronics, spas, restaurants and bars. Very cosmopolitan, and very chic."
,,Modern City Style,4.0,,"You can purchase everything you want and need here,and get good food also~ The shopping malls built so spectacular~even if you don`t do shopping,orchard road truly has high calue to come and visit!"
,,Cloning !!,1.0,,The obsession with consumerism is apparent the second you walk into Changi airport however the cloning of shopping malls basically filled with reruns of the shops you saw in the last mall is tiresome. If you have money and time to burn then by all means visit as it is possibly the cornerstone of Singaporean life.
,,Highly overrated shopping experience,3.0,,"Depending on where you live or are from, you can probably experience the same luxury brands shopping experience at every and any other large, international city. There aren't a whole lot of Singapore-only brands or shops to find on Orchard Rd, and prices at shops are higher than at other similar cities such as Hong Kong and Tokyo. However, the tree-lined stretch of road is quite beautiful and mini malls are literally beside each other all down the stretch. If just walking you can be done in an hour or so."
,,Glitzs and Glam,4.0,,Orchard Road is the equivalent of any Miracle Mile if you want the same fashion top names. Good way to beat the heat and a place to dodge if you get stuck in a sudden downpour
,,A place for anytin n everytin!,5.0,,"U name it, it's here at Orchards! Malls after malls, n any brand on earth, it here!
Come here during Xmas time to witness a magical season eva! The roads are lined with lights n deco hanging from e trees, n everywhere u turn there are a variety of Xmas trees!
U can spend a whole day here.. Trust me.. Lol"
,,I prefer markets,3.0,,"To me this was just department stores and brand name shops that you find everywhere. I'm more into second hand markets and local area handicrafts. I got there really early with the idea of having breakfast at leisure and then having a look around. I went into some of the malls and hardly anything was open and if they were they were packed and in a basement. There really wasn't anything in the way of food that interested me, what was open at the time, around 8.30-9.00am was typically western fare. I got a little frustrated with the whole thing and I'm ashamed to say, went to Macca's, it just seemed easier. I'll admit that I didn't hang around for the shops to open as by the time I had breakfast I was over the whole thing. However there nice wide footpaths and being mid-November, lots of Christmas decorations. Singapore puts on a fantastic show for Christmas everywhere you look. I suppose if you're into designer wear etc. Orchard Road might be your thing as there is quite a lot of malls and shops. It just wasn't my thing."
,,Shoppers' Paradise,5.0,,"This 2km stretch is literally lined with malls upon malls, shops next to and across one another, and that's not counting the side streets and alleys. I only went to ION and Paragon as almost all the malls carry the same international luxury brands from Gucci to Prada. However, they also carry affordable low to mid-range priced brands like H&M, Zara, and forever21. I spent an entire day (my last day in Singapore) in these two malls as I went around to shop and dine. If you are a person who would rather see other attractions in Singapore and don't have time to squeeze in optional tours such as shopping in a mall, then skip this place by all means."
,,Ôrchard road singapore cosmopolitan food and shopping extravaganza,4.0,,"We found orchard road, close to our hotel Elizabeth, to be an excellent location , MRT, buses, taxis easily accessible to and from here.The street food stalls and restaurants in the malls had excellent value for money with a wide range of local foods as well as popular kfc, Pizza Hut and mcdonalds outlets. The area is very clean, neat and crime free. We often walked late at night with no problems. Mosque is close by and Halaal foods available too. We found the People very friendly and patient and helpful. We will certainly return here when circumstances permit. Overall singapore is a must visit island for tourists and visitors."
,,Shop till you Drop!,5.0,,"One of the best places to shop in Asia. Singapore retailers are more genuine in their products as they are being governed with a number of laws against fake items, sub-standard products and there is the Lemon Act. This act allows a recourse for the buyer within a stipulated time frame. Also there is CASE where consumers can bring their action against retailers. So you can safely shop atleast some peace of mind. One of Singapore's main resource of revenue comes from visitors touring here. So one can understand the need to have all these laws.
Orchard Road is a good place to shop and with easy accessibility by 3 MRT Stations, bus, taxi and private transport. Ample parking with some having free parking during lunch hour to attract shoppers. Branded goods from all over the world can be found here. From clothings, ladies and men's bags, beauty products, money changers, banks, and more you name it they have it.
Orchard Road also has lots of food on kiosk as well as food courts and fine dining. One place not to be missed is the food court in the basement of TANGS which brings the old flavour of the 60's street food culture and almost there taste. Lucky Plaza is a galore for Filipino cuisine. JollyBee a well known fast food join in the Philippines can be found here in the food court and 6th level.
The Singapore President's official residence, Istana, is also found along here near to Dhoby Ghaut MRT and Singapura Plaza.
There are lots more here and if you are a big time shopper catch the sales during the BIG Singapore Sale in May to June each year.
As I said ""Shop Till You Drop"" and I mean literally drop. There are massages around there to soothe your tired feet and body."
,,Road of 10 thousand malls,1.0,,Super mall after super mall all of them packed with the same exact stores and goods.... Another mall....another mall... Another mall..... Nothing special..very over prices merchandise! Difficult to navigate your way to the hidden locally owned merchants through the forest of commercialism
,,High end shopping,4.0,,This place has many high end shopping malls. The street has very well known famous brand showrooms . Also there's an area where you get perfumes n Deos of all kind. It's a good place.
,,Heaven For Shopping,3.0,,"I visited this place when i travel with my friends, and i don't think any other thing is important here. It just full of shopping mall, and most of them are branded. The lower price in this place is found at Lucky Plaza."
,,Not for those with light wallets,3.0,,"Mostly designer/chain stores on both sides of the road and underground. It's fairly tiring by the time you've looked through the third H&M in a row, and even my girlfriend got sick of the lines to the change rooms. You're better off finding some of the more boutique or specialty stores in the surrounding areas."
,,Way Overpriced!,3.0,,"It was just a city street choc-full of up-market brand stores. You had Gucci, Armani, etc, etc plus small couture boutiques all packed into one dizzying, overpriced street which you couldn't cross except using the underpasses. The only thing I'd go back for was the bookstore Kinokuniya which was still way overpriced, but the largest one I've ever stepped foot in."
,,shopping,5.0,,Orchard Rd is by far the best shopping road we have been it's 2.5k long the shop's were still open at 10 p.m the most amazing thing we ever was on Sunday family just stop anywhere on the footpath and sit to eat.
,,orchard road- indispensible part in Singapore,5.0,,"i had been here in the last day in my trip. it was so pitty if i did not come here. traffic in Singapore is very easy. You can come here by metro, or bus, taxi also. Orchard road looks like Disney Land for me, there have a lot of shopping mall, entertainment place, park, restaurant,. It's worth to say that Singapore is a palace in the world and Orchard road is one of indispensible parts in this beautiful country."
,,good for high end shoppers,3.0,,"orchard road is abundant with high end shopping, with many shopping centres with the same stores. at first it was exciting, after a while, boring...
the H&M is fantastic though, spent many hours in there and lots of money!
while on orchard road you must buy one of the ice creams from the street vendors. not sure if they have a name, its a piece of sliced multicoloured bread with a rectangle block of ice cream (your choice of flavour) folded over like a taco looking thing. it's delicious, and only available on orchard road so try!!"
,,a large and long commercial road,3.0,,"It used to be a prestigious zone. With time passing and some shopping centers aging, I find Orchard Road less attractive. It is still interesting to walk there and look at the crowd and see the stores."
,,The road is your Oister,4.0,,"What I did there and what happened there, stays there. But apart from that, it offered a cuisine and atmosphere not from this (sweden) planet!"
,,Huge shopping centers,4.0,,"Huge shopping centers! Exclusive stores, like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Prada, Dior, Celine, Fendi, you name it! But also many stores for everyone, like forever21, hm, abercrombie&fitch, sephora, Victorias secret(only makeup, creams etc). The centers are so huge, it will take forever and go through everyone. Good luck shopping! :D"
,,Awesome Decorations in December 2014,4.0,,"The Orchard Road's decorations was amazing in the month of december due to christmas week, one can walk over midnight and can enjoy over these streets, Bus service can be easily accessible from orchard road."
,,Good shopping location in the heart of Singapore,5.0,,"Definitely worth a visit.

Lots of different types of shops including Tang's Dept store and you can cool off with a drink in the outdoor cafe next door (which is now run by the Marriot Hotel although I always knew it as Tang's) while watching the world go by. afterwards."
,,SHOPPING AND EATING,4.0,,"Easy to get to MRT underground $3.00 SGD rtn
Food - everything at any price - I had to reorder the Mango Shrimp rolls They were way too delicious.
Shopping, even for my wife, way to much. Prices no deal We ended up not buying anything."
,,Good place to find all the branded goods you want,4.0,,"Orchard road is a must go for shoppers. It has almost every branded brand you want to find. Ion orchard is the most convenient as it's located just outside Orchard MRT. You can walk from the MRT to wisma which do not have many shops but do have a pretty decent food court (food republic) where you can find some local dishes but standard is only ordinary.

Venture further you will reach Tangs and its has a nice cafe at level 4 call Island Cafe the food is nice."
,,Life of Singapore,4.0,,"Perhaps the most iconic of Singapore cit after merilion is Orchard road..
the place to go for window shopping..almost all the brands are present..its a long road with complexes on both sides of the road..its a cozy walk specially in the evening..lots of things are always happening..u don't want to miss it when in Singapore.."
,,Orchard road shopping area,4.0,,great area for shopping with both high end and average shopping available. getting taxis now that taxi waiting areas on orchard have been eliminated make it a little difficult and require exploring to find an area. Restaurants are in the malls for most part and again difficult to find to find and select.
,,Great bit of shopping,5.0,,"If you want to shop, then this is the place to go in Singapore. Another one of those ""you have to go"" places. Don't expect loads of bargains here especially if it's a western brand. Remember they're importing it, so it's expensive!"
,,Shopaholic,3.0,,"Orchard Road is good, but there are other better and cheaper shopping spots in SG. Orchard just has the reputation and glamour, but doesn't always stand up to it. Sundays are the worst day to visit as this is the day the Philippino maids all have the day off and head for this area making it super crowded. The underground tunnels connecting the malls make it relatively easy to get around without getting into the heat, but even they can be deceptively tricky to navigate."
,,Just a bunch of high end designer clothing shops,2.0,,"Nothing special - these shops are everywhere you go; Bangkok, Hong Kong, Bejing, Shanghai, Delhi, New York, London, Paris, Singapore etc etc. Unless you have a huge need to buy a LV bag or Chanel something else on holiday, i would recommend seeing something a bit more unique to Singapore like chinatown or gardens at the bay."
,,Place to shop and eat,4.0,,"Any kind of stuff that you want to buy, high range to lower range. Food courts, authentic chinese food restaurants, Japanese restaurants. The only thing was, crowded at the underpass, just like cities in Hong Kong, Beijing, everyone is rushing, so older people be careful when you in the midst of the younger people, hold on to something. My aunty who is in her mid 70s almost knocked down by another person."
,,Orchard Road.,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the most happening stretch for shopping and F&B. They have shops of any labels, be it high end and low ends. The department stores do have regular sales offer so do keep an eye for them. Food is everywhere and wide spread from western to eastern fares. Local street food is available in all individual complex and its very affordable. It is very safe to roam around with huge walkways and boulevards. My favourite place in Singapore."
,,Shopping....shopping....,4.0,,It is a place you must visit if you want to go for shopping in Singapore. Many branded items here that you can find...but unfortunately i couldnt find the shoes that i want here.
,,WORTH EXPERIENCE,5.0,,"Plantation Road and the encompassing range is the most prominent shopping locale in shopping distraught Singapore. Bringing a transport down this street is to watch a tide of mankind going starting with one shopping center then onto the next. The shopping centers line the 2.2 kilometer street, extending up to the sky and vanishing under the street in complex warrens of underground ways, shopping back streets and shopping center connections. Take a huge wallet, a consumeristic desire and simply lose all sense of direction in shopping.If you are into no doubt understood brand like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel, Cartier Orchard Road is for you. It is a long road around 2.2 km loaded with shopping buildings. It's not just the center point for shopping there are likewise lodgings, nourishment court, eateries, bistros, bars and excitement focus. I thought that it was' pleasant just to glance around and blending amongst the group."
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping!!!!",5.0,,"Shoppers alley, or should I say shoppers miles!! Reminds me of NYC. Every where you look, everywhere you turn, there is something for everybody. If you don't like to do all that shopping, people watching is all too funny. It all amazes me as to how clean it is. Even when you go under ground, like you were going to the MRT. All the stores down there! It is place to see and experience! Enjoy!!!!"
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"Wow wow. Every designer you can imagine or want are located on this road.

In the malls if you head further underground you will find some bargains (designer on street level) you could spend a week shopping and still not visit every shop.

Lots of restaurants and bars along route to break up the long walk

Worth a visit"
,,The BEST shopping road in Singapore!,4.0,,"Orchard road is worth a visit if you like shopping! There are shops for every budget, from the super luxurious to local places. There are plenty of large shopping malls and sometimes they are connected underground as deep as 3 to 4 levels.
Definitely walk the streets by evening time,much more busy than day time. Not only that the exotic cars, like Lambo's and Ferrari's, get out and show off. There are so many places to eat in every style and country, again for all budgets, so no need to starve either.
As Singapore is a very save and extremely clean city it is a pleasure to be there. Still i would advice to take good care of personal belongings as it remains a big city, reserve showing off for the luxurious hotels and their terraces to be see and be seen.
For the normal financial sound shopping our recommendation would be Paragon smack in the middle of Orchard Road shopping."
,,Great for shopping n lunches !,5.0,,"There were many nice shopping plazas where we spent hours browsing and shopping for food and all essentials... There were also many designers shops... At night we enjoyed talking a stroll along Orchard Road where was lively, clean and safe;) The architectural designs and lightings of the many modern buildings looked spectacular at night!"
,,A long walk,4.0,,Orchard Road is about 3 miles long in all so best to use the 'hop on hop off bus if you don't want to spend too long walking.We got off the bus the stop after the Botanic Gardens and walked for a few hours.Lots of shops in the Malls sell designer goods so prices are sky high but if you seek out 'cheaper' goods you should pick up some bargains.Overall very impressive and a must visit.
,,the singapore,4.0,,"this is the real singapore ... since the 1960's... despite the new attractions elsewhere, people always come back to this street... for food, shopping, everything... every few year, the place gets a renovation and it always seems to improve... in the morning you see indonesians line up in front of the shoppes like takashimaya and in the afternoon people hang out around the sidewalks..at night even more livelier... good fun for the family"
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,This area is a great assortment of different types of shops and malls. It's not a road full of souvenir shops (I had to ask directions to find one just to get a fridge magnet). The road also has a mall underground that goes for several blocks and it was where I finally had my first Krispy Kreme donut.
,,Shopping Crazy,5.0,,"Well Orchard Road the main road for Shopping with a capital S. This is a one way road buses taxis and cars. so be careful and go with the lights. If you are looking for Hi end such as Gucci etc this place has a designer building Tommy Helfinger Polo for the men.
The Japanese department store Takashimaya goes forever. Good tip for food eateries go to basement, there are Korean Japanese, Western etc.food. Also in this area is a super market for those little things you may have left behind. For the Bargain savy of us Lucky Plaza on Orchard Rd near the Marriott Hotel has Electronics, Shoes, Clothing, Jewelery etc. Bargains can be purchased here. Apart from the big Hotels and the Shopping Malls and there are lots of them you could be gone for days."
,,A good walk,4.0,,"Probably one of the most important shopping streets in Asia, with a high number of malls and luxury stores. Also recommended even if you just want to go for a walk."
,,Shop shop and shop some more,4.0,,"I have read all the previous reviews and agree with all of them. Everyone has a different experience shopping some love it and some hate it but I would say, give it a go in Orchard Road, it was fun seeing all the designer names there, and you may be surprised as some of them were much cheaper than the UK, Zara for one, I got two lovely going out dresses for £30 each, it is also worth looking at the sale rails in each store as some had as much as 70% off for some real bargains, it was lovely and cool as well, a good place to go to get out of the mid day heat , and lots of food courts as well, Also note that even if they have the same shops they don't all carry the same stock,so just because you have been into one of your favourites dont assume they all carry the same stock. But I would stick to one mall and do all the shops there, there are not as many people so you can breeze in and out of the shops easily, worth a visit"
,,"Shop, Stare & Rewards!",5.0,,"Orchard Road is indeed a very interesting place for locals & tourists. Most tourists would enjoy walking down Orchard Road from Lucky Plaza, CK Tang, & moving to the opposite side of this would be Takashimaya & Ion Shopping Centres.

There are varieties of shops & sights that provides different types of services & products to everyone. There are always food courts or food junctions whereby local or foods from South East Asian countries are found. These food courts provide cheap & quality food & tourists could mingle with the locals. Orchard Road is an interesting crowded shopping area for everyone. If one comes to Singapore, it is a MUST for him/her to visit Orchard Road or his/her trip to Singapore is not complete. Orchard Road is the heartbeat of Singapore in terms of shopping!"
,,Beware of Mall Blindness!,4.0,,"Simply put, Orchard road is some five kilometer stretch of malls and shops side by side, one bigger than the other. Comparable to a Paris Louvre, where you can't tell the difference between the artworks after seeing too many of them in a too short amount of time, walking the Orchard road gives you the feeling of not being able to tell the malls apart from each other. The best strategy is to select one and stick to it, the rest will be pretty much the same anyway. As it is the Singapore, the food courts are probably the best the malls have to offer and it's also a differentiating thing between them. All of them offer good selection of affordable and well prepared food."
,,meh,2.0,,"Overcrowded on weekends. Mostly overpriced, mediocre food around the area. Access to a extremely large variety of stores in the malls. You can find old school ice cream vendors every few hundred metres, great for countering Singapore's unforgiving weather.

One of the few things I like would be the buskers performing during late noon / evening.

Not bad for the occasional day out with family/friends or shopping spree."
,,Shop your heart out,5.0,,"While I am not a big fan of shopping, this place has endless streets and buildings filled with everything you can imagine. Work at least going once (though you won't likely see everything)"
,,Happening Street,5.0,,Endless road of shops with huge malls of luxury stores. It is really a long long walk and one would surly need good stamina and fluids to enjoy. Takes just a day to glance everything here.
,,Shopping extravaganza,4.0,,"Wow, every shop you could ever wish to visit appears to be located in the orchard road area

Numerous malls, all exceedingly well laid out, immaculately clean and well designed.
There is aldosterone a local mall located within the central area, where cheaper, touristy goods can be found, some evening entertainment is available, and to stop and rest and enjoy the music was very welcome. The area is always exceedingly busy, and be aware the traffic can be crazy, so only cross the road at the official areas, taxis are cheap and easily available"
,,a place for shop alcoholics,5.0,,a beautiful road full of the most expensive brand outlets but very refreshing and full of crowd and energy and lively as well
,,"Shops, shops and more shops!",4.0,,"Even if you don't really like shopping it's worth taking a stroll down Orchard road as it's quite impressive. It's busy. But the streets are nice and wide so never feels too crowded (like London!)
Plenty of places to grab a cold drink or something to eat.
We also discovered (some) shops are MUCH cheaper than the UK! Vans for example worked out at almost half price compared to the UK...
Our hotel was just off Orchard Road so it was a convenient place for us."
,,Shop,5.0,,Take your wallet as you really can shop till you drop. From cheap to very expensive. Enter a door and dozens of shops appear . Wear comfy shoes
,,Take a quick glance,3.0,,"A mile or so of souvenir shops interspersed among huge malls of luxury stores. How many Prada
Stores dies a city need? More unique things to see in Singapore. And it gets very hot walk down the road. You duck into the malls to cool off."
,,Chaos,4.0,,"So many people, at all hours of the day. It is a real bustling hub in Singapore. Shopping options beyond description and restaurants galore. The food courts at the major department stores are amazing."
,,For shoppers and non-shoppers alike!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopper’s paradise for those visiting Singapore. For stores and restaurants at 313 and Orchard Gateway, major department stores like OG, Metro, Robinsons, Isetan and Takashimaya, bookstores like Times, Kinokuniya and Borders, and an infinite variety of retail outlets at ION, Orchard Road is the place to be.

Even if you are not a shopper at heart, you will find the clean, broad sidewalks appealing – the perfect place to people-watch! We especially enjoy walking along the wooded lower end of Orchard Road opposite Concorde Hotel and the palace. Few cities are as fortunate as Singapore to have such lovely gardens and clean air in the heart of the retail district."
,,Impressive rows of shopping malls,4.0,,"Huge, gleaming malls fenced the Orchard road; selling new, shiny, luxury goods, and some scattered cheaper products. Mostly big international brands. Crowded during weekend. It's definitely a sight to see. To shop, maybe another matter."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,This a great place for shopping or just window shopping with loads of option restaurant to cafe and even foodcourt.It was busy and a very clean area easily accessible by the mrt.Can be tough to get a taxi here especially peak hours.Me a Singaporean living a road found so much of changes compared to my last visit.Just enjoyed strolling around.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road in Singapore is the best destination for shopping. A shopper can find the best of High Street stores neighboring great bargain stores. Some of the stores have some amazing steal and bargains. The best time to be here is during the great Shopping Festival. For visitors to Singapore, the bonus is the GST refund that you can claim on your way out of Singapore."
,,The epitome of globalisation.,3.0,,"A huge and crowded road filled with Starbucks every 20 metres, Louis Vuitton stores every 50 metres and a Hermes store. If you are wealthy and shopaholic enough, this is for you. Or you are simple a broke sightseer and traveller, well... You know what I mean!

The skyscrapers somehow darken the street and create an atmosphere of claustrophobia."
,,Been shopping here since 1972,5.0,,"Orchard Road has changed in 43 years I have been shopping here. I lived in Singapore from 72-73 and In the early years there were old shops, food markets (the car park next to the Hilton for example). What fun it was then. It had not been developed and you could still park in front of CK Tangs, my favourite shop. But the years have changed it so much but not necessarily for the worse. It's just now upmarket and even though I can't afford to buy a lot here, I still have to just get something at CK Tangs - moved up the road and modernised. I don't go into the malls as I prefer the outdoor shops. If you want the real feel of Orchard Road, give the malls a miss and walk from Penang Road down to the Marina and then back up the other side. You won't miss a thing but you'll sure sleep that night. Great fun. I've flown over just for dinner and the night."
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Didn't really like Orchard Rd. it's very expensive and crowded, especially at Christmas time. But I did like the Christmas lights."
,,Shopping !,4.0,,"If you want to shop in Singapore, expensive exclusive brands, then this is one of the places to go to. Must-do in Singapore."
,,the shoppers paradise and non shoppers paradise too,4.0,,"Enjoy your day here, if you are a shopaholic, you can find a lot here, with all high class branded are in here. But if you don't like to shop, enjoy your walk along orchard road, with many statue along the street, you will definitely like the view. Enjoy your stroll here, it's enjoyable just to walk around. Also you can find 'Daiso' in ION that has all $2 stuff from japan."
,,Main shopping area in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are a shopaholic then this is the place to be and let's face it ladies, who does not like a browse? Anything at any price can be found here!"
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,The perfect street for shopping. Orchard Road has every shop you can think of. It's a very busy spot.
,,No bargains here,3.0,,"If you like shopping then this is the place. So many Malls, so much variety. Worth a look even if you don't want to buy. Many shops, high rent! Don't expect any bargains - I searched hard but didn't find any."
,,High end bling and low end sparkle.,4.0,,"It has it all . Shops you only see on T.V. and low end 3 for $10.00 shops. Very flashy but it's all there , if you look. Expect to see multiple high end shops inside the same bulding, let alone Orchard rd. Can be very overwhelming. But it is an experience not to be missed."
,,Shopoholics heaven,4.0,,"If shopping is your thing then you can't go wrong on Orchard Road with shops to meet all tastes and expectations,My wife would like Robinsons to open up in the UK!"
,,Shopping hub,4.0,,"Some of the most expensive Hotels,Shops,cars in Singapore will be found in this place. a real good place for a Window shopping walk for someone who doesnt wanna spent big on shopping."
,,An element of perfection!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is many things to many people. If you want to shop, this is the place to be. It has everything! Me? I was just here to observe, to wander, to people watch, and to be my nerdy city planner self. The area is spotless, with people who sweep up fallen leaves after a little rain storm. Nothing is out of place! It is very modern here. It is over priced and commercial, and that's exactly what Orchard Road was built on. It's a unique place, and worth it just to wander around here."
,,Shopping Nirvana,5.0,,If you like shopping like most Singaporeans this is the place. From high priced Ion Plaza to low budget Lucky Plaza. It has it all. For food go to the Taiwanese chain Din Tai Fung for delicious Shanghai soup dumplings. But there AE many more. The area has about 23 malls connected underground so no need to experience the hot steamy weather.
,,High end meets thrifty,3.0,,"What a confusing but altogether delightful experience - one side of the road you have big brands like LV, CK, ZARA, etc and opposite you have the lucky plaza - reminds me of our China mall back home. Love how one area can meet the demands of so many. PS: omw what is it with people walking and talking on their cells nonstop!"
,,A nice shopping palce,4.0,,We stayed in the hotel in orchard road. It is a place that you can go shopping and get things to eat easily. You can find almost everything you want form there.
,,Get an ice cream sandwich,3.0,,"Look out for street vendors selling the uniquely Singaporean ""ice cream sandwich"". The vendor will slice off a slab of ice cream and wrap it up in a sort of breadish sweet cake. Delicious, cheap and fun. You will find them on Orchard Road and some other places in Singapore. Apart from that, I found the rest of Orchard Road to be overpriced and commercial. You can find stores like this anywhere."
,,Ritz & Glitz.,2.0,,"Nothing to brag about. If your and avid shopper and want all the brand names of clothing in one place then your in heaven, just don't expect a bargain."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road is truly amazing, when we were there it was completely transformed in Christmas sphere. Beautiful!!! The longest shopping road I ever visited. Really worth visiting!!!"
,,Shopper's Paradise,4.0,,"Everything you've ever wanted in a couple of kilometers, but it's not as cheap as you'd think. Very cosmopolitan and well worth a trip. The humidity in Singapore can always be a bit sticky and always be prepared for a downpour, but there are plenty of shops for you to take refuge in with free WiFi"
,,Where beautiful Singaporeans show off !,3.0,,"From my hotel, following Google navigation, I and my roommate started walking along the way to reach Times Plaza, Ochard road at around 9:00 PM.
As they say, it is a shopping spree in Singapore. We entered a multistory mall, I don't remember its name, where my friend had picked some things to buy at home through its online page.
Straight on the 1st floor is a batch of sale off clothes for woman. The price I think is not expensive in compare with other neighboring countries for as well as budgets.
We go on the elevator to the 3rd floor for men and women fashion. The same standard stuffs, but what surprised me was so a lot of beautiful young girls.
I wondered myself how did they, these energized people could stand just simply shopping night after night? I explored the shop for a while and leave my friend with his passion. I went out to my prefer area: Geylang. But however I will not forget that valuable time wandering along the crowded street side of Orchard, so a lot of beautiful Singaporeans, foreign travelers also."
,,the place to be in sg,5.0,,"Chicago has the miracle mile, NewYork 5th Avenue and Singapore has Orchard Road. Here you will find mall after mall of the famous and infamous brands. There are luxury malls that cater to Chinese, others to Europeans, Japanese and so on. I have yet to find an American brand not represented along Orchard Road.
Now for the fun part, on Sunday this place is crazy. Its suddenly full of shoppers for their one day off a week, not much purchasing but people gawking and milling about. The road runs along two subway stops at Somerset, Orchard or Doby Ghaut so any stop you choose will land you in a different mall."
,,A busy place with tall buildings.,5.0,,"Head down the Somerset MRT station and just go with the public flow. Some building may be interconnected either through the basement or the building itself. High rise hotels and buildings here, very fun to walk through but the items their selling here are quite expensive. A good souvenir shop you can find will be at the Lucky Plaza, opposite to ION orchard. Halal food you can find at the Far East Plaza, or make sure to download the Halal Tag app whenever your in Singapore to lookout halal place to eat in any specific area."
,,Overrated and expensive as a shopping experience.,2.0,,"As an attraction and to go for a walk this is OK, but it is a disappointing shopping experience. There are mainly high end luxury brands, with other mid-premium brands within the different shipping centres. Prices are high compared to other major global cities. This isn't the place to go for fun good value shopping."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Loads of huge shopping centres filled with designer shops which are all very expensive,but every thing is beautifully laid out and the shops are lovely and cool after walking up and down the roads outside.Worth a visit."
,,Bustling street,5.0,,The main shopping belt in the heart of singapore. Plenty of retails and a wide array of food choices. Perfect for families
,,Designer shops,4.0,,Nice stroll in the evening on orchard road. Lots of huge shopping centres and designer shops. We don't come on holiday to buy designer gear so not really my thing for shopping but enjoyed the walk.
,,Shoppers only.,4.0,,"I headed here as I had time to spare good friday afternoon. However,being a holiday and seemingly half the population of Singapore here, I soon reached saturation point. Okay, I am not addicted to shopping and so was not prepared to spend my afternoon battling against the masses. I admit the shops are stunning and the choice amazing. Seek and you may find..."
,,Fantastic road,4.0,,"This approx. two miles road between Orchard and Dhoby Ghaut MRTs is full of life. All major brands of the world are available here. Electronics, apparel, tailors, fashion accessories, hotels, attractions, money changers, departmental stores, spa, saloons, hospital, furniture, antiques, and what not? Tourist should take care of cheats they may come across while shopping electronic items specially from Lucky Plaza.

Singapore Tourist promotion board organize many events. Lights on festival days are marvelous. You will not feel the heat while walking on the road as the path ways are getting coolness of the malls on both side of the road."
,,Endless Shopping,4.0,,"This is a major shopping district with nearly endless options for shops. If you need something, you will find it here. Also some great food options mixed in, to refuel while you shop."
,,Orchard road Fairyland,5.0,,It is a really wonderful place to take children to especially before Christmas when all the lights are up. Really amazing display of Christmas decorations and lights never seen anywhere before. Even the older ones would enjoy the beautiful sights on display. You can expect big crowd along this road especially the weekend before Christmas when the place goes into a Carnival mood. Sure a place not to be missed when you are in Singapore in December. Amazing lights shopping all along the way added attractions for any tourist planning a trip to Singapore.
,,If you can't find it here then they don't make it,5.0,,"This is a shoppers paradise, over 6km of shopping, Prada, Gucci, Tag Heure , you name it , you should find if. Add a Hard Rock Cafe and other outlets along with rail and bus connections what more do you want?"
,,most beautiful street,5.0,,"i went to this place at night, and its so beautiful and modern street, full of all brands for shopping and nice malls and modern structure, and sounds of birds in trees is so wonderful! dont miss it."
,,Busy as a bee,5.0,,"Buzzing with people and activities .... the streets are lined with shops and shopping malls ..people follow the traffic rules strictly. The roads are spik n span and the local residents sincerely follow and practise cleanliness. They are truly eco-friendly. ION Orchard, Somerset, etc. are...More"
,,"The Mosque, Zam zam restaurant, arab street",4.0,,"The cleanliness is good, very well organized & neat building structures, but the people are less friendly. Overall, it was a pleasant trip."
,,Great time to visit during Xmas Holidays,4.0,,"The whole place was decked up with light and decorations and every single mall had beautiful christmas displays of trees and other stuff which added to the holiday cheer. Great places to eat, though quite expensive but overall it is a great stroll."
,,Great shopping but not cheap.,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the The Shopping Road of Singapore, a true tribute to consumerism. You have huge and really impressive department stores as well as single brand shops, primarily on the expensive kind such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton. My favorite is Ngee Ann City of...More"
,,Main shopping and restaurant area,4.0,,"Singapore main commercial street, very nice to go around during the day; at night you'll see young people getting together for fun. If you look budget shopping the place is Bugis, but you cannot miss walk around Orchard and see how life is going on...More"
,,Buzzing,4.0,,"A street for shopping at all levels, from inexpensive local shops to high end top brands, the mall underground in the MRT network is amazing, you could spend all day underground. This street has everything Singapore has to offer."
,,"Excellent shopping, great access",4.0,,"MRT is close by, so are the bus stops. So getting to Orchard road is a breeze. Great place for shopping but beware that if you are looking for a bargain, you may be disappointed. Some of the malls are pretty high-end e.g. Takashimaya. If...More"
,,For 'normal' shopping don't waste your time here!,3.0,,"The massive hype of Orchard Road led us to believe we were in for a treat. Massive let down, unless you want to shop in places like Gucci, Michael Kors, Vuitton, etc. The only other stores here are the big department stores. Much, much better...More"
,,Main shopping street of singapore,5.0,,"Every country has a shopping street. Tokyo have roppongi , Korea have myeongdong , Singapore has orchard road. Walking along the stretch you can find numerous shopping streets both on the left and right of the main road. Do note that crossing to the road...More"
,,Shopping Delight,4.0,,"Convenient hub for department stores and shopping Malls with MRT station close by. If shopping is on the agenda, this is the place. The tourist information center is just opposite Somerset MRT station on Orchard Road. No worry about breakfast, lunch and dinner, there is plenty. If you ask, you will find 24 hours Singaporean eateries. No limit to what you can do in one day."
,,Something for Everyone,5.0,,"If you can't find your intended purchase on Orchard Road, you won't find it anywhere.

And even if shopping is not your main mission, this is a place to wander and take in the sights and sounds of rampant consumerism, whether in the elaborately presented shop windows, or the late model luxury vehicles on the road itself.

Orchard Road has something for everyone. I enjoy sitting in one of the many coffee shops and simply watching the world go by.

For good street food, try the food court under the Orchard Tower at the top end of the Road. It has been there forever, and the food is good and reasonably priced."
,,a must visit place when in Singapore,4.0,,"If you are a shopaholic, or you just want to do window shopping or you want to sit down and eat, i guess this place offers something for everyone, malls, shops, food joints,."
,,"Walk, shop, walk, shop!!!!",4.0,,"There are too many shopping malls along this street!!!

Some are old malls, some new. There are plenty of department stores and shop lots that sells clothes, perfumes, bags, cosmetics, and pretty much everything else.

Walking from one shopping mall to the other might require you to walk out of one, onto the pedestrian walkways and/or cross the road, and into another one. It will be a hot walk on a sunny day and if it rains, you might be stuck in that one shopping mall but there will be plenty of shops to walk around and food to taste until the rain stops."
,,A must for first time visitor to Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore's Rodeo Drive of LA. A whole street where numerous shopping malls sit. There are hundreds of shops in each mall, stocked with all the latest fashion and world reknown brands. The shops are interpersed with cafes, bars, restaurants and eateries. In most shopping malls there are usually food courts where you get to sample local fare. Things are not cheap on Orchard Road. Apart from the young and trendy, locals don't shop here, but it is a must have experience for first time visitors."
,,Shoppers street of dreams,2.0,,"I don't shop for recreation but if you do this is a great place for it. Building after building, with multi-level malls in each stretching on for 2 miles. They have large food areas with lots of choices to walk through and see what is available to choose from. High end shops - Prada, LV, Philipe Patek and on and on. Plus all the usual chain shops, Forever 21, H&M, etc. You could spend a lot of time here not seeing the real Singapore.
A bonus at one of the malls has a very modern library on one level, great for a break from walking and view out over the city."
,,Shop all you can,5.0,,"Orchard is a good place to shop for everyone. If you have an eye for branded and high fashion items then you can find the most popular and high class shops in the world. They are aligned on the road... Meanwhile, if you are on a budget, you can find affordable shops in this place. One thing I like about this place is that they have huge tress on the road which made the place so amazing."
,,Bustling and amazing shopping and dining district.,5.0,,"Great shopping and dining street. So much to offer in a safe and hospitable environment. Ideal also for a casual stroll. Lined with elegant stores and dining outlets. Home to some great department stores and hotels including the Hilton, Mandarin Orchard, Holiday inn. Very lively and pleasant experience just strolling by."
,,Nice street for Shopping,5.0,,i guess its a besst street for shoppers in Singapore because Orchard road gives vibrant choices for shopping (cheap as well branded) and it has excellent street food outlets and coffee shops like Starbucks.
,,Family friendly,5.0,,"A whole stretch of shops, cafes restaurant and the best parts were the underpasses, which is so helpful when its too sunny, or raining, or with children. But the walk outside, is just as nice with a lot to see."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Orchard Road is about 2.5km long. There is every conceivable shop and retail outlet you can think of but what really is noticeable are the big name brands and luxury shops. One mall rolls into another, often linked underground so it's hard to know exactly where you are sometimes. ION mall is probably the best mall, all 10 levels of it! Be prepared to walk miles. Not ideal for small kids. Be warned, Singapore is not cheap. I'd say it's more expensive than London or New York and Dubai is far less expensive. Still a great experience tho."
,,High Fashion Street,5.0,,"This street in Singapore is the one street where you get a feel of the city and its fashion sense. The street is lined with high end fashion brands all across. ION and Paragon shopping malls will fulfill all your shopping needs but still if you feel theneed for more, there are many more shopping malls to cater to your needs. Towering glittering buildings on both sides of the road and impeccably dressed people on the streets will definately catch your eye. You must must spend a lazy day roaming on this street."
,,Orchard,4.0,,One of the singapore largest shopping town area with multiple malls and big branded things to buy. Surely able to occupy your whole day !
,,Over rated,3.0,,Too many shops and malls to choose from and roo many people. Much preferred MBS for the serenity and shopping.
,,Crazy...,4.0,,"Orchard Road is totally nuts! Shopping is the national sport of Singapore and it's evident at Orchard Road. Thousands of shoppers fill countless malls and jostle for the latest designer must have item. It's very strange to witness but it's an experience non the less.

You can pick up some seriously good deals in the less glamorous malls and don't be afraid to haggle - it's expected.

My advice is to get there early in the day to avoid the lunchtime and evening crowds. Enjoy..."
,,Awesome shopping destination,4.0,,"You can spend hours together at orchard street/ road...it is lined on either side by many shopping arcades.. economical stuff at Luck plaze... better branded stuff at orchard & takashimaya towers...
in evening & night this place gets transformed, /...amazing lights & overall a great walk thro place...

MRT orchard basement offers a great food mall to tstae variety of cuisines too at affordable prices..."
,,Great shopping!,5.0,,Great range of shops and malls from high end shops to budget basement shops too! Beware on a Sunday all the maids come out in force and the area near lucky plaza and Tangs is mobbed!
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,Great place to go to shop till you drop. So many stores that cater to all sorts of people with any kind of budget. The stores are modern and really fun to walk through. So many places to eat and a nice garden too. Several differnt malls all in the one street make it easy to spend a day dedicated to spending money :)
,,Overwhelming,5.0,,"Wow! This is truly a street with large mall after large mall, and inside the malls there are so many stores above and below ground and the malls wind around - it's easy to get lost! We spent 3 hours there, went in 4 malls, and I don't feel like we really end up seeing very much of it (but my teenage son was done shopping). There was something for everyone - high end to cheaper stores."
,,shopping above ground and eating underground,4.0,,"Most shopping starts at orchard mrt . Your choice to go above or stay below ground.
Promos are on al the time especially this year due to 50 year celebration.
To walk this strip takes at least 2 days with no detail shopping just looking. If you have specific items in mind then get those out fo the way so you can enjoy the strip.
Good eating at Tangs basement, at underpass to paterson road or head to wisma atria walkway loads of food until you get to Takashimaya--where u have more food.
Avoid busy hours on mrt if possible ie 830-930am and 4-530pm."
,,Shortest Downtown but Felt Complete,4.0,,"It is the favourite shopping desination for us Indonesian where you pretty much can get everything but at a high cost (Singapore considered the most expensive country in th world currently 2015). You got to be prepared if you want to shop $ dine here.
It is a price I'm willing to pay in exchange for security, organized, clean, everything within walking distance, good food & high end shopping. Go splurge yourself you deserved it if you can afford it !"
,,For younger folks,3.0,,"We stayed at the Four Seasons near Orchard Road so we ended up walking it several times. It was very crowded and had a lot of young people milling around. Kind of reminded me of being a teenager in a Midwestern mall. Lots of big national stores with great names, but I tend to prefer boutique shopping where I can support local artisans. So it just wasn't for me."
,,What's not to love about Orchard Road,5.0,,"If you love shopping, food, cafes and people watching this is just the best place. It's all there and all great!

Don't be afraid to check basement level food halls, there's some amazing food to be had for not a lot of money.

If you're there on a Sunday check out Lucky Plaza. I'm not sure where all the people come from but there's millions of them!"
,,Beautiful Tree Lined Singapore Main Road,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a Beautiful Tree lined Road dotted with Malls, Restaurants and Office Buildings. Here you will find all the High End Malls that Singapore has."
,,"The ""IT"" Place",4.0,,"Its the most happening place in town I guess. Though it has a different vibe at day time and at night. There is so much to do, eat and shop, its a good idea to book a hotel nearby so that one could go about walking and explore this fabulous place called Orchard Road. It's especially delightful at christmas time decked in twinkling lights."
,,Worth a walk through!,3.0,,"Visited in September 2014 and was staying at a hotel a little distance away from Orchard Road. Having done some serious shopping many years ago in Orchard Road wanted to do a visit to see how things had changed. You may know that this actual road and the neighborhood has a business association which works tirelessly to keep this place one of the best shopping streets in the world. And of course it's not only just this street, there are many side streets and business centers and numerous hotels and restaurants all throughout the neighborhood.

For us the shopping was not so good because we have the opportunity to shop in the USA and the prices there are really sharp. However it was a great walk through, had a little stop for lunch and then walked almost the entire length of the street. Great for outdoor walk and exercise and of course if you do live in another part of the world where electronics are more expensive then this would be a mecca shopping experience for you!"
,,Excellent in all respects,5.0,,Excellent food with the best sea view in Singapore. Great service and next door a fantastic dance bar with outside vip seating and view over the city.
,,One Dollar Ice Cream!,4.0,,"Towards afternoon i found this ice cream being sold in Orchad Road, its only 1 dollar and taste amazing! Never had it in any other place."
,,Heart of Singapore,4.0,,"Everyone goes to Orchard roped at some time or other as this is one of the worlds major shopping strips. There are shops for electronics, cameras, fashion and just about everything else you require.
Be aware its hot, humid, busy and noisy and should you need a taxi you will usually have to wait some time."
,,Forget it!,1.0,,Over rated and way too expensive. I honestly didn't find this to be a pleasant experience. Not really sure who can afford to buy anything in any of the shops on this road.
,,Good attractive shopping street of Singapore.,4.0,,"The maintenance & set up Orchard Road is very good and attractive, as such giving a good image to Visitors who want to taste a good shopping street in Singapore. There are many shopping complexes providing a wide range of goods & services to normal tourists visiting and serves like a 1 street attraction in like to Oxford Street in London. However the heat is sometimes too hot to bear. Perhaps an air-conditioned glass covered walk way could be more attractive for visitors to use even if a nominal fee is being charged as it can be an alternative convenience of choice."
,,Shooper's heaven,5.0,,Great place to visit for a shopping buff. Its like the millenium mile in Chicago. A new traeller should ask to be dropped at RObinsons as the access is easier from there. Should keep phone handy with google maps to traverse shops
,,Something for every kind of traveller,4.0,,"A great place to be, if you love walking,shopping,food,nightlife. There is something for everyone.This place is dotted with malls and food outlets. Its great to simply walk around this place as well. A must visit place for every one visiting Singapore."
,,Nice Place,4.0,,"Good place and excellentely build like any other thing in Singapore ,you can find lots of restaurant malls and food joints"
,,"Obligatory for tourists but crowded, hectic and nothing particular to buy",3.0,,"You gotta do it when in Singapore but as a resident, I avoid Orchard Road - crowded, hectic, pushy and nothing really to buy despite so many stores!

I think if you're coming from North America, Europe or Australia, you may be disappointed that there is nothing really to buy that you can't get from home. For example, I find Zara to be about 15-20% more expensive than Europe - so no real point if that is any benchmark. There are all the western chain stores that you'd expect and few unique things.

I do like Takashimaya, the Japanese department store which is a nice experience and nice Japanese section which is culturally interesting and unique. Otherwise all the other malls are western brands and the same thing you'd find in the west. In the same mall, Ngee Ann City, there is also a great book store - probably the largest in Singapore - Kinokuniya - that is excellent as well."
,,Fascinating insight into consumerism,4.0,,"So many shops and malls that it was overwhelming. I felt they were generally over expensive and not worth the time as there were no bargains, really. People seemed to constantly be shopping and Orchard Road always seemed to be alive and bustling. Alot of the shops opened at 10am and closed at 12ish. Couldn't get over fact that at 11pm at night, shops were still busy. Don't people have a home or family to get to?
Orchard Road is good to see at night with all the lights and big screens and tall buildings. During the day, lots of traffic. We were there on Chinese New Year and it was the only time of the year when the road was almost empty. Regret not taking a photo of it.
Easy to take public transport from there- lots of buses, and MRT's scattered along it.
We loved the food malls as the range of food was amazing, cheap and so delicious. That's where alot of the locals seemed to eat. We often had our breakfasts there and never disappointed.
The Information Centre was on Orchard Road which we found invaluable in getting information, paying for tickets etc. Thoroughly recommend a visit to the Info Centre. Staff were so helpful."
,,Clean Heathy Crowded Modern Road,4.0,,"Seeing Orchard Road is like seeing a mirage. Now you see people everywhere watching other people. Evening lights are everywhere to decorated the streets and the department stores. With the convenience of the MRT, visitors are able to get themselves to the heart of Orchard Road easily. One can spend a full day in the area for shopping, dining, and sightseeing on street level as well as underground. Like all areas in Singapore, it is being converted into ultra-modern city of the future."
,,Great shopping area,4.0,,"Great place to do some shopping, they has all the designer, but bring your credit cards, cause it ain't cheap, but you can also just go around in the area which is also nice, but I think it the most expensive place in SGP"
,,Shopping Galore,5.0,,Store after store of name brand and luxury brands you can think of! A shopper's paradise especially for those with limitless wallets. A lot of dining places and food kiosks to choose from. Beautiful especially at night with all the decorations and lights.
,,Christmas,5.0,,I have been to this road many times but this year i had gone with my friends to celebrate Christmas and it was amazing to see so many colours together and so much fun.
,,The Mecca of the modern shopper,5.0,,"What a fantastic road, everything you could possibly think of at your fingertips! My husband and I got lost in the crowds as we shopped until our feet were sore and enjoyed the culinary delights in the basement levels."
,,"Singapore's answer to ""The Miracle Mile""",5.0,,This street has everything that you ever wanted in upscale shopping and dining. Really outstanding and the people are incredibly gracious and accommodating.
,,Nice place for shoppers!,3.0,,"For people who like shopping and big malls this is the place to be. All famous European brands are present and of course you can find imitation. Keep in mind that you need a full day to explore it and prices are higher than other places in Singapore.
Besides shopping and malls, this area is well animated during the day and night as well. There are many nice hotels, many restaurants offering various cuisines and good places to have a drink.
For those who don't like shopping and crowded areas, this is not a place for you.
Last advice; avoid Orchard Towers area if you don't want to get harassed by prostitutes."
,,One Awesome place to Shop,5.0,,A very busy shopping Area of Singapore where you will find all the top shops along with great restaurants. Allow yourself plenty of time.
,,Go to tangs and the summer set 330 shops to eat as it dead cheap,4.0,,It's very busy and very hot and you can get lost going from one side of the road to the other . Great super food at summer set shops . Enjoy the japenesse beer on the way into summer set shops but not the German beer crazy ££££ !
,,Only if you like to spend money,3.0,,I guess I have to visit it so I can say I have been here. I like shopping but these are not cheap. I can get better bargain from outlet store in Woodbury Common in New York usa. I hear you can get cheap electronic stuff but you have to bargain. Seriously?
,,"Shoping, eating...",4.0,,"Shoping and eating... And again, again, again :)) You can find all of brand in there, from luxury to normal. Nice place to visit, but if you will miss it, you can live with that."
,,The Ultimate Shopping Street!,5.0,,Orchard Street is equivalent to the word Ultimate Shopping! Some of the best brands in the world have their shops over there. Many big shopping centers and prices for everyone. Many thousands of people perform their shopping every day under a very safe environment! I have been many times over there and i feel very safe.
,,To many High End Shops,3.0,,"Unless you went into shopping malls it was a long walk down Orchard road in the heat, so glad to stop off in to cool shops but very disapointed not like I remember yrs ago we only spent 1 day looking,.. enjoyed Marina Bay shopping much better very over rated....handy to MRT & Buses only bonus.."
,,Times square x 10,5.0,,"If you like endless luxury malls, high end restaurants and low end foot courts, teeming crowds day and night, spectacular light displays at night, and unbelievable conspicuous consumption, Orchard Rd. is for you - and for me too. Went there numerous times. Even our grandchildren enjoyed it."
,,Shoppers delight,5.0,,Here you can shop til you drop. Never seen so many shops in one street. Every other building is a shopping mall with big designers to ordinary high street shops like zara and h and m. Lots of places to eat as well.
,,Crowded cozy place to go,4.0,,"If you are shopaholic then you should go to orchard road. There are several big malls here. In the street, you can find a crowded ice cream store. It's only S$ 1,2 and it's really delicious!! you have to try it"
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a belt of shopping mall. Most of the mall are link to one another. There various mode of transport to take you there. You could take the train (MRT), taxi or bus. For more convenience you may choose to stay at the hotel with the Orchard Rd belt. Do not if drive, ERP charges apply at certain hours."
,,great area,5.0,,"This's one of the great area in Asia, you have all in this road luxury at best make sure your Wallets are heavy enough if you go with family,"
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,Great experience seeing so many world class names side by side. Most of the glam shops had no prices on the good in the windows. If you have to ask then you can't afford it. Yey within the malls were chinese markets where prices of all goods including food were sensible. Free shuttle buses collect & deliver you to the main hotels in the area. Great experience.
,,Beautiful Shopping but expensive pricetags,3.0,,"This is pretty much an experience in high end fashion shopping. There are not many big brand names that aren't in Orchard Road.

I enjoyed the experience of looking at the expansive and expensive stores including the vibrant hustle and bustle of people. This isn't for the bargain hunters though as I may suggest Chinatown if you are looking for a cheap buy.

Despite this, it is truly a worthy tourist experience just to see it and walk the street and shops. We spent a half day here but that was enough for me.

If you were looking to buy an expensive item at a upmarket named store then Orchard Road is for you.

By the way, there is MRT available in the main street so access here is very easy and about the cheapest thing available in the street."
,,"Everything Shopping, Shops and more Shops!!!",5.0,,"We were there during Valentine's Day so the side walks walks was very nicely decorated. We really enjoyed walking up/down this street. It is a must see in Singapore! This street is a high energy, busy street with all the high end stores and more. It's way more than I could have thought of with everything you can want. The displays for the high end stores were amazing especially Louis Vuitton . It puts New York to shame@! This should be the shopping capital of the world. I love it and would go back there if I ever go back to Singapore!"
,,Should be visited in December!,5.0,,In December there are a lot of Christmas trees! They are different and of cause amazing. You can make many photos with Christmas sculptures etc.
,,Expensive shopping,4.0,,"All the top brands along this shopping road. Very expensive and don't forget that the price you see may not include the surcharge plus the tax. Very interesting to look around, the stores are well laid out and enjoyable to be in."
,,Cant ask for more :-),5.0,,"The Orchard road in Singapore is a shoppers paradise. Dotted with large malls on either side & interconnected with MRT all along, you can literally ask for nothing more. Even walking along the pathways can spend 3-4 hours easily with food joints along the path. if you are interested with small shop shopping, options available too. There are umpteen places where you would feel like stopping for some pictures. Enjoy thoroughly while in singapore"
,,Nice street but really expensive,2.0,,"It is really nice to take a walk down Orchard Road, lots of different but very expensive shops. I found Zara and H&M ;-)"
,,A cleaner and more pleasant version of Oxford street!,5.0,,Orchard road has everything for everyone! we stayed in Hotel Jen that was right on orchard street and very convenient for the MRT.Lots of places to eat and relax and a truly wonderful shopping for experience.
,,Shopping --- > Infinity !!!,5.0,,"This place was mentioned by everyone, when i asked for the places to visit in Singapore.

Countless stores and showrooms covering both sides of the road, makes this a heaven for shopping lovers. Various shops from tailors to designer outlets; Branded showrooms to new brands unheard of; This place offers much more than you can think of.

Also, there are pubs and restaurants at almost every square meter of area, so you dont have to worry about your stomach.

A TIP: Keep a fat wallet and yourself hydrated so as to maintain the shopping spree !"
,,Busy but enjoyable,4.0,,Just as the title suggests I found Orchard road busy but very enjoyable. It is the biggest shopping road in Singapore by far and has everything you could possibly need. The shopping variety is brilliant they have absolutely everything. I also found a lot of small food shops which were very nice. The heat and bustle can get a bit much after awhile but there are many taxi stands with taxis there constantly and very little wait. Overall it was a very fun day trip.
,,Champs-Élysées of the east,5.0,,"I had heard so much about Orchard road, that there was no way I would have missed it on my first visit to Singapore. After taking a taxi, I got down at a busy junction on Orchard Road, and over the next few hours, walked up and down the length of this road. The place has an energy that seems to be in overdrive, and probably defines the city itself. It is vibrant and pulsating with multitude of visitors and regulars who are attracted by the endless number of stores and showrooms in a line of malls that dot both sides of this road.
It would be an understatement of say that its a shopper's paradise. Of course, needless to mention, nothing comes cheap here, and you got to be loaded. Nevertheless, you can always enjoy window shopping !
Around Christmas time the whole place was brightly lit up and decorated with Christmas trees, and other interesting displays.
To an extent, it reminded me of Paris’s, Champs-Élysées (but, without its long & rich historical glory). We could possibly call Orchard road, the Champs-Élysées of the east."
,,Great shopping but sometimes confusing,4.0,,"Orchard Road is definitely the top Asian shopping locator and one of the worlds best too . All the top brands are here and often more than one store per brand . It's like a shopping promenade with sometimes unplanned links between Malls , this causes confusion sometimes on how to get from one to the other , but got shoppers this confusion is worth it"
,,Worth a visit,3.0,,"Orchard Rd is clean and lined with designer stores like Gucci, Prada, Chanel, etc. All of which are not interesting to me, but I can understand the hype as the only one I think I didn't see was Dolce & Gabbana, so it's a good street for serious shoppers. It also had H&M and Forever 21 for those (like me) looking for a few things more affordable. There are also heaps of shopping centres on Orchard Rd such as Ngee Ann City, Paragon, ION, Tangs, and so on. Definitely has something for everyone, but it is no cheap marketplace. You can find pretty good food for really cheap prices inside any of the shopping centres too; in the food halls (usually on the very top or bottom floors). You can comfortably spend the day walking up and down Orchard Rd, eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner there if you want! Most stores trade 10am-10pm 365 days of the year."
,,"Shops, shops, shops!",3.0,,"Orchard road is ever hanging, every time I visit Singapore it looks different and there are quite a few new shops here.

Orchard road really does have very high end brand you could ask for, but not with any variety of cheaper shops.

And as a visiter from Australia, most of the brands you find along orchard road are already in Australia and if not the same price, more expensive.

Unfortunately orchard rd isn't the exciting stop it used to be"
,,Shops,2.0,,"Yes it's a street full of shops and overpriced goods so why would anyone want to come here. There so much more to see in Singapore, save time and don't bother coming here, just not worth it"
,,Great place to have a suit made to measure!,5.0,,"Easy to get to ! We took a taxi from our hotel and found Max Mohan Tailors and , had a marvellous
Dinner suit made to measure . Fabulous service and beautiful work! Walked around and looked at some really interesting stores and ate some delicious food ! Lots to see and do if you like to shop."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Wow, so many shops catering for all tastes, especially expensive ones!! There must be some seriously wealthy shoppers out there to keep these businesses running! Still very enjoyable for the window shopper and plenty of dining options as well."
,,Fun even if just window shopping.,4.0,,"We enjoyed ourselves even though we didn't really buy anything. Had a look at the interesting wacky clothes stores, delicious deserts and some tech stuff. Probably not something I'd do if I didn't have much time, but if you have some time to kill it's worth a look."
,,"Shops,Malls and more shops",4.0,,You can buy anything you want in Orchard Road but prices are high. From high end to everyday things. For us it had lost some of the appeal it used to have compared to a previous visit several years ago. Some of the shop displays were very good and lots of work had gone into them. Everywhere was very busy.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"This is a must visit shopping paradise for everybody in singapore. From budget clothes to high end clothes, even budget household items to high ended, there are a lot of gems to be discovered here. There are so many shopping malls in orchard road from you to choose from. Local delicacies are also available everywhere. Night lightnings are also very attractive."
,,The best shopping in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road Singapore is the best shopping experience in the region. The shops are various , from tailors to designer outlets, food shops and banks. The road always seem to be busy 24 hours a day.
The street scene varies from 3 storey TV advertising screens to the Thai Embassy in lush green surroundings to big department stores and building catering for a sightly risqué clientèle!
Its a great place to window shop, but be careful crossing the road and avoid the road racing from taxi's, cars, and general manic road users!"
,,Everything Shopping... and more!,4.0,,"I stayed near Orchard Road during Christmas time and it was beautiful - the whole place was decorated with christmas trees, lights, and other grand displays. There were so many photo opportunities under fairy light canopies and with statues (there are also Christmas mascots too), but as expected it was super crowded! During Christmas there are also band performances on the streets and near the entrances of shopping centres, which is sure to entertain.

The place is fantastic for shopping - all your designer stores inclusive, as well as local stores. A lot of the designer items on Orchard Rd is more expensive than if you were in another country, so as a tourist, do your research and make sure you can get it online for cheaper - though you do have the benefit of christmas sales and claiming tax on it!

Lots of places to eat on Orchard Rd too and it is super close to all the MRTs. One of the best things to eat while I was there was Mangolia ice cream sandwiches. I had a $1 sweetcorn ice cream sandwich in rainbow bread - you have to eat it quick or it will melt (and it can get a bit messy). There are other flavours like like durian and red bean too.

Make sure you bring a map of all the places to eat/ go on Orchard Rd! You'll need it!"
,,Overcrowded,1.0,,"The shops are repeated, the crowds are crazy. If you are a tourist, please visit this place once. Else, it's not worth it. The Christmas decorations makes it bearable but even so the crowd makes it difficult to stop to enjoy it."
,,My favorite place for shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road is my favorite place since 1996. I always visit this place every time I go to Singapore either for shopping or just hang out. I can find any my favorite goods from watch, bag, cloth, books and toiletries in this place. Comparing to those of in Indonesia, the price are cheaper. I also used to hang out in front of Takashimaya watching people passing by eating ice cream purchased from a street vendor. In this place, we will find a new mall from time to time and we will not get bored as the government also providing something new. But better you are not coming in Sunday or public holiday, this place will be very crowded."
,,nice shopping street,3.0,,"Orchard road is street where you can find nearly every store you are searching for! On each side of the street are Skyscrapers with tons and tons of Shops inside! I liked the ION best, because you can find affordable Shops below surface as Topshop, Mango, Forever 21 and so on. Most of the other malls are filled with expensive Shops as LV, Chanel, Dior. But be warned: it is very cold inside the Shops, so take a Pullover or a jacket with you for Shopping!"
,,Shopping galore,4.0,,"This was one crazy experience -upcoming Chinese New Year , Valentines Day and weekend - crowded and crazy amazing. I went to Ion, Paragon, Robinson, Tangs, Wisma Atria, Takashimaya, lucky plaza and 313 Sommerset. I loved 313 Sommerset... found the sales staff friendlier and more helpful. Dont forget to try the Godiva icecream at Takashimaya- it is to die for:)

The malls were interconnected and one can spend a day there."
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping!",5.0,,"For shopaholics like me it's shopping heaven. Massive mall after massive mall. But ... take plenty of money, you'll need it. Singapore is not cheap."
,,Everything shopping,4.0,,There are lots of people on the streets doing window shopping and real shopping. Too many malls with same brands/stores. Make sure to plan and decide selected malls to visit. Not all are too friendly.
,,Amazing Homage to Materialism,4.0,,"An enormous stretch of road dedicated to all the materialistic possessions you want, or do not want, need or do not need, and a most painless way of separating you from your cash! Great to simply walk down, lots of outdoor cafes and people watching spots. The traffic is relentless and its near impossible to get a taxi unless you wait patiently in a long taxi line at one of the malls. Good food courts in many of the malls, some interesting local sights but basically offering the same items you see in any destination where you an satiate your retail desires."
,,Amazing shopping experience - but can be expensive,4.0,,Most definitely on a par with shopping in London except the weather in January is much better in Singapore. So much to see and buy so 'control' of the credit card is advisable. Several very good and not expensive restaurants down the side streets off Orchard Road.
,,Worth a visit but hide your credit card,4.0,,"A whole world of exclusive shopping can be found along Orchard Road. It really is a location for the rich - or for those, like us, who just want to peer into those exclusive stores just once. A great people watching area and, if you look closely enough, little gems like the Asian Food Hall in Lucky Plaza can be found. That was more our style. $4 exquisite Asian meals."
,,Every high-end store on the planet located here,3.0,,"Quite a lot of stores, all in one place. Not only are all of the designer stores, but also many many ""affordable"" stores offered here as well. There are as many stores below street level as there are above. Lots of restaurants here as well. Kind of fun to stroll along and look at things. I cannot imagine that it one were looking for something specific, that it couldn't be found here. Shopping galore!"
,,Cannon Optics cheap glasses,4.0,,"Both my husband and I get eyes tested at cannon Optics in Orchard Road. Great frames and cheap too. Also speedy overnight service. Been going there for about 10 years now, wonderful service lovely people"
,,Shopping on Orchard Road,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a wonderful shopping destination with every designer under the sun. However, be prepared, it is expensive.There are many other shopping malls and side streets that are also wonderful for shopping if one doesn't necessarily want the big labels. For fabric, Arab street is wonderful. You can also bargain there, something not to be tried on Orchard Street!"
,,Shopper's Paradise,5.0,,"Ok.. what is there not to know about Orchard Rd? And where do you start if you want to go? The best advice is.. plan plan plan..

Orchard Road has just about everything you want when you are on a holiday trip, shopping trip or just to walk along that 2 mile stretch of road for window shopping.. if you are a serious shopper looking for the best of brands, then there all over the area. If you are that average then again, there is also plenty of that as well!

Some serious walking and a fat wallet is the order of the day! Be as casual as possible if you are doing the wallking and don't bother about taking those water bottles because there's plenty of stations to have your quick food or drinks. 12noon to 8pm is the best time to go. Go ahead, give it a try and make sure you book a time to go for a foot massage because after the end of the day, you would probably be crawling back to your hotel! Be warned about rubbing shoulder to shoulder during peak holiday season though!"
,,Underwhelmed,3.0,,Walked from one end to other. Interesting architecture from older to modern shops. Mixture from high fashion high price to cheap. Pick your shops - you can get some things here at home for about the same price - plenty to see though if you are a serious shopper
,,Orchard road,5.0,,"Orchard is a retail and shopping hub which located in the city. Transportation is convenient, there MRT and buses services. Some of the shopping malls are Tangs, Robinson, Ngee Ann city, Takashimaya, 313, Wisma Atria, ION, Lucky Plaza, Centre point, Plaza Singapore etc, All these malls carries well known brands of goods and many eateries which are very affordable.

If you come to Singapore should see theses shopping malls. No regrets!"
,,"Shopping, eating and watching people",4.0,,"From mid-morning until midnight, you can watch people waking up and down the street. They carry shopping bags, are in discussions, smile and take a lot of pictures of the malls and many decorations. Even when it is rainy, you simply hop from one shopping mall to the other and stay dry, or just settle for a while in one of the many Starbucks or other coffee houses. Sure, if you live in Singapore you go shopping and eating a bit away from Orchard, since there it is cheaper. However, just to walk down and up Orchard Street is a great experience, with all the window-shopping and happenings, especially on the first Saturday of the month when part of the road is closed for some activities."
,,Orchard RD - shopping unlimited !!,4.0,,"Its place to test your card limits !!... best of the global brands have their showroom “Shopping unlimited”
entire stretch of orchard has multiple malls interconnected and again its place for “good food” and have pockets of place’s wherein you can enjoy night out

“Orchard is accessible by public transport - best is MRT”"
,,High end shopping street,3.0,,I just dropped by this street since it was recommended by travel guidebook. But to me it looked a high end shopping street like Japanese Ginza.
,,Great shopping and Dining,4.0,,More shopping than you can poke at stick at from Upmarket Designer labels to cheap versions with prices to match as well as Silver Service Dining also with prices to match or eat like a local and eat well with 2 good meals plus glasses of fresh juice for under S$12.
,,Awesome shopping!,5.0,,If you're looking for the big brands and variety of stock then you'll love Orchard Road. There are so many shopping centres with what seems like thousands of shops and department stores. You can easily spend two days here shopping non-stop. You'll love going in and out of the shopping centres for their air conditioning as it gets warm in Singapore. Remember to keep well hydrated so you can maintain your shopping enthusiasm! This is a shoppers paradise. Happy shopping!
,,Not for me,3.0,,"While many hanker to make the long and tiresome trek down Orchard Road for the shopping delights that obviously exist there, it's not for me and many other like-minded men. Let the women look aghast at the pricey world wide labels while we males find a small Aussie bar."
,,Not for me.,3.0,,"Returned for a second look after 12 years.Same old same old.Miles of upmarket malls/shops selling overpriced goods.Sure,there are some cheaper places but even those are expensive compared to other districts.All the international brands feature here.All the style of the well to do.AAARrrrrrGgggggg.Not my Singapore.This area was once orchards,albeit long ago,and got its name from that.Lets face it,you can see streets like this in your home city.If you just want this type of thing so be it but Ime not gunna travel from Australia to see something I can see just down the road."
,,Shop Shop Shop!,5.0,,"This is a shopper's paradise!!! This is nothing like New York or LA, people are respectable otherwise you will be fine in Singapore. From Coach to Hermes to whatever your heart desire, they are all here. Starbucks is on every corner like 7 Eleven in the states. For coffee lovers, you will enjoy the coffee."
,,Asia's Champ Elysees,5.0,,"Beautifully decorated at nights and wonderful for shopping, eating and enjoying: that is the Singapore's Orchard Road. Though it has become much more crowded year by year, the road is still one of my most favorite places in the world. Singaporean want to make it the Champ Elysees of Asia, and I think it is! It deserve the heart of the city state."
,,Shop until you drop,4.0,,"I spent the day following my wife around the many and varied shops on Orchard Road. The variety spans the very expensive to he very cheap and all things in between.
While I did do the following there was more than enough to keep me entertained.
There are some great coffee and tea shops to rest the weary legs in while enjoying a quality coffee."
,,Wonderful shopping land,5.0,,"There are more than incredible for shopping. All brands are here. PPl respect each other especially wait for taxi is make me feel amazing Singaporean waiting taxi in front off the mall and no one dare to steal the que !
I love love love this country ! Wanna go there for a month next time :))) bravo !"
,,Good finds.,4.0,,"A shoppers paradise indeed. We enjoyed walking up and down this tree-lined ""road"" which looks more live a boulevard. And you think you are in the tropics but there's a lot of shade that you don't have to sweat it out while shopping between buildings or malls. I am not too tall nor wide so being close to the average ""Singaporean size"" made Orchard Road the perfect shopping paradise for me. This was also conveniently located close to our hotel."
,,Strategic,5.0,,"This is my favorite area of singapore as it houses almost everything you look for. From average to high-end malls, different restaurants and shops. Pretty much everything you need is there. Orchard point, Centrepoint, takashimaya. All you need is an unlimited credit to purchase all you need. The area never sleeps. MTR stops in the area and buses and cabs available 24/7. Just stay away on a sunday as it is jampacked with Filipino workers you can barely walk along the stretch of the street."
,,Diva,3.0,,Singapore too expensive for shopping. Don't bother with lovely tea shop in Ion shopping centre for tea and scones it will set you back $50 australian dollars!
,,Orchid road has everything,4.0,,I have watched this real shopping strip evolve over the past 40 years . The malls have gone up and they just get bigger and better all the time . This is a genuine shoppers paradise with numerous anchor stores and some original brands selling fine local crafts.
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,If its shopping you want then a visit to Orchard Road Singapore is a must. There are many shopping malls along this road and they all have similar shops. These malls are big! and you can spend hours in them.
,,Continuous shopping from day to night,5.0,,"You can't claim that you have been in Singapore if you haven't been in Orchard Road. This prestigious shopping street is full of malls where we can shop from affordable until very unaffordable things and of course, eat local food. The road segment I choose to spend my time is always from ION-Tangs Plaza until Plaza Singapura. I rarely use MRT nor buses to browse all the buildings. I always choose to walk, for shopping or at least window shopping. Walking here was very safe, very seldom police in uniforms could be seen. Every time I walk down the street past 6 pm, I can hear big flocks of bird's sound, which gather on the trees along the street, especially the ones after OG Orchard building.

There was a big renovation in the middle of Orchard Road I noticed last September, that had resulted in new hanging bridge for a new mall called Orchard Gateway which I could see finished and in operation when I visited Singapore again in December. Orchard Road was very beautiful with all the decorations especially at Christmas time. I always try to schedule going here just to admire Christmas decorations almost every year and last year (2014) was fantastic!"
,,Shoppers' paradise,4.0,,"A definite must for shoppers or people watchers. Best idea is to take Dhobi Gaut underground right up to the Ion Centre and then wander back down the road, as it's too long to walk up and back. The Ion Centre is an experience in itself. You could spend all day there, and get lost in the process. Orchard road is probably best seen in the dark in the evening when the whole place really comes to life and it's not quite so hot. The lights are spectacular. And remember, everyone tows the party line and waits for the green man before crossing the road!"
,,On of the great walks of the world,5.0,,"start at tanglin mall and just stroll. Take the day. Pop in and out of restaurants, shops. Enjoy the sounds, smells and people watching. Stop for a spa and certainly secure wonderful accommodation on or just off Orchard. As good or better than the 'great avenues' of Europe, or 'magificicent streets' of North America. Can't get enough of Orchard Road and make it a must do when in Singapore."
,,Eat your heart out.,4.0,,"With St Valentine's Day upcoming, it is not the gaudy diamond (and diamante) trinkets or high end watches in every shop window that are the star attraction of Orchard Road, it is the cheap, wholesome and beguiling local food in the commercial basements - like No. 73 - that is the real performer on a world stage. Nowhere else can you find, under one roof, delicious specialities from Teochew and Sichuan Chinese, Malay, Peranakan, Indonesian, Filipino, and 'Muslim' repertoire freshly made in front of you. In the slightly plusher setting of ION and other nearby underground shopping malls, you can find 2 kinds fish and noodle soup laced with chili, brisket of beef hor fun, bee hoon and mee goreng, tropical vegetables in soy, black bean and curry, and truly Singapore delights such as bak yut teh - the famous fragrant pork rib in broth. Head to Orchard Road - but down and not up, for the street foodie experience of your life."
,,"Hectic, hypnotic and totally dedicated to retail.",5.0,,We have been holidaying in Singapore across the last 25 years. When we first came here we wondered why the otherwise clever Singaporeans had left such an expanse of vacant land between the street and stores. But during those intervening years we grew to admire the forethought that left wide footpaths a la the Champs Élysées that allow you to stroll down this road and not be worried by the crowds. We also marvelled at a government that planted an avenue of native shade trees beneath which said busy shoppers could stroll in shade in the tropical glare. Now the shops and shopping malls are nestled together along several kilometres. Beaming from these retail palaces are massive TVs blaring adverts for premium brands or the latest movie. As a tourist let go and wander - there is no right or wrong direction here as everywhere are premium brand outlets from around the world. Then when the sun sets orchard road changes and becomes a magical scene with twinkling lights in the trees and seasonal decorations across the street (Xmas is the best!!). The vibe is more relaxed but still a mix of bustle and that magic that we love about Singapore.
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"I don't think you should miss a trip to Orchard road if you are in Singapore. This place is easily accessible by MRT, there is a stop right at this place. It would be ideal if you go there in the evening, because you can walk from one end to another when the atmosphere is cool. So many shopping malls lined up on both sides of the road. Very good, wide footpath, which is well maintained and also has seating at intervals if you want to take a rest or just soak in the ambience and sights. A window shoppers dream destination. Shops are on the expensive side though. A nice place to spend the evening"
,,Beautiful....better at night!!!!,5.0,,"What kind I say to a huge street full of shops, shopping centres, etc. Evening walks are better as you can see all those amazing lights that are display with street performances!!!! Have a walk and enjoy it!"
,,A enjoyable area to visit,4.0,,Having lived in Orchard Road in 1972 and stayed at the Shangri La hotel [situated On Orchard Road]on many occasions I thought another visit was timely. It is still a lush green area just outside the downtown area so if you are not on Business and purely on holiday try staying in this area as I think you would like it.
,,normal,3.0,,okayish normal! i mean i am a singaporian so i know! i am a kid so don't ask me about household stuff or anything like that! but i agree with jtsh12! because during Christmas the light lights up and the bubble starts a blowin and stuff like that!bye byebitty bye bye!
,,Extraordinary Road,5.0,,"This must be one of the most compact consumer paradises... especially if you are into fashion brands. Every building in this short length of central Singapore road, has an internal air-conditioned mall. The outside plazas are clean and not as busy as might be expected. There are several MRT stations to deliver you to and hurry you away from Orchard Road, and the Hop on, Hop off buses drive down it, with a couple of stop points.
I'm a shopper, and I just love walking around looking at 'stuff': gazing in exclusive and more familiar shop windows, and just people-watching. When you get hungry or thirsty, there are eateries or food halls available in every mall, but best to look at the individual mall directories to orient yourself.
For a different take on Orchard Road, take a walk up the hill-side streets a stones throw, and you can see 'remnants' of an older, and now more exclusive Singapore - with streets of terraced houses. These could be good places to visit for a meal at night."
,,Predestrian Night Out,4.0,,Great chance to walk down Orchard Road like never before. Road is closed to traffic from 6.30pm to 10pm every first Saturday of the month. You get to experience activities and performances like never before during this time.
,,Shopaholic heaven,4.0,,"It's shopping heaven for any shopaholic, and I seriously mean it. All kinds of things can be found here, from average household items to high end designer items. And the decorations is one of the best in Singapore, especially during Christmas. Give it a visit."
,,Great shopping streets,4.0,,This street have a most of the shops from branded name products to very cheap product. Great for shopping
,,"Love Orchard Road, great atmosphere",4.0,,orchard road has shops that sells all sorts with prices from reasonable to designer. There is something there for everyone. Tasty food too. A must visit when in Singapore
,,Meh - Big shopping street in big city,3.0,,Orchard road was not really for me. It is a big shoppers haven but once you get over the enormity of it then it's not much. If you want to spend spend spend have fun but if you're looking for authentic experience look further afield.
,,"Fantastic place to shop, and also see Christmas Lights!",5.0,,"We visited Singapore last month and enjoyed Orchard road, which was easy to walk to from our hotel and they had a shuttle running there through the day so it was an excellent place to take shelter from the rain as well as grab a subway to other parts of the city. We found a Marks and Spencer on Orchard, which delighted our British friends, as well as just about every store conceivable! There are at least 2 huge malls off this street as well, it is a shoppers paradise. Finally, the street was lined with amazing Christmas lights, not the reds and greens we see in the western world but lots of pinks and light blues and other pastel colors. Very nice place!"
,,Like Beverly Hills But Different,4.0,,"I was astounded by the pink artificial Christmas trees and other crazy western like holiday decorations as I got out of my free shuttle from my hotel, but the shops here are unique within a few square city blocks which make for great shopping and not many bargains.

Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world and this high-end shopping area is no exception to the ""dear"" prices you will encounter throughout. I loved all of the high tech murals and LED lights along with the convenience of retail shops and food courts. Even if you are not into shopping, this is a great place to window shop."
,,Shop until you drop,4.0,,"Orchard Road is know for it's diverse shopping from the small shops and cheaper prices of Lucky Plaza, to the main steam large stores like C. K. Tangs, Orchard Central, Delfi Orchard, Orchardgateway, and many more. You can buy almost anything in Orchard Road. You'll find plenty of places to eat too, from fast foods to exclusive dinning. Go there Christmas you'll be amazed at the decoration and lights and Chinese New Year is another time to visit. The cleanliness is well know for Singapore and with the amount of people it is quite remarkable how it is kept so clean. If you visit Singapore you will visit Orchard Road."
,,Christmas Lightup,4.0,,"The whole of Orchard Road was lighted up to usher in Christmas and the New Year of 2015. The road has been transformed into a fairyland of lights with stars, Christmas trees and decorations. It was indeed exhilarating to stroll along the stretch of road , and stopping now and then at the various road stalls and carts. It was a fun night out in this annual event of the city , joining the crowds , spending the last week of the year."
,,Great for shopping,4.0,,"Kate, my lovely wife enjoyed it a lot, my credit card not so much! It has everything one could ask for, luxury shops, shopping malls, and FOOD COURTS! Nothing you won't find elsewhere but still very nice!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Long road goes on for miles plenty to see and do for everyone we visited just before xmas .Xmas decorations lights trees etc wonderfull best I have ever seem awesome!!! A shoppers paradise !!!
,,Was pretty and dressed up for Christmas and new year.,3.0,,The heart of Singapore as they say. A bustling place done ip very well with lights and decorations. Plenty of food carts and stalls on both sides. Quite well connected with the bus and mtr services. You definitely get a feel of Singapore here.
,,Same same,3.0,,"Plenty of malls but all very simialr with mainly up market retailers, Rolex, Channel, Louis Vuitton etc.and the prices to match. A lovely boulevard to walk and brouse with plenty of cafes and restaurants as well."
,,Beautiful on Christmas,4.0,,"I had been here twice for its Christmas street decorations. Especially at nite when the colorful lightning of major shopping center shining make the orchard road become cheerful, very enjoyable! Here also is a busy shopping street, lots of branded high class shops."
,,From farmland & orchards to one of the world's most upmarket shopping streets,5.0,,"Orchard Road has it all....a beautiful ""boulevard"" where every upmarket store from east & west meets. As well as being connected overground at street level all the malls are also connected at subterranean levels & it's possible to walk from one end of the street to the other without coming above ground. Of course the individual malls are also multistory upwards. As well as shops eateries abound & the whole street is well served by both MRT & bus. In the evening it's wonderful to hear the bird song from the thousands & thousands of starlings who nest in the trees on the street."
,,Too much walking...,3.0,,"This place can be confusing since there are multiple malls to decide where to go. If you are travelling with small kids then its just better to visit couple of malls and leave otherwise it can become very tiring. Personally, for shopping I found Shoppes@Marina Bay and the Singapore airport better than this place."
,,Only one heritage shop house block left,4.0,,"Orchard road contains even more shops and malls than a couple of years ago. Continuously Singapore find another couple of square meter to cram in another shopping mall; according to my observation from the upper deck of the SIA bus, only one block of heritage shop houses is left. Glass and steel high-rises reign. But you can shop till you drop; and don't forget the cafés and restaurants.A must visit in Singapore."
,,Shopping and Walking!,4.0,,"If you want to shop or eat, this is the place you want to be. You can find best of the brands and malls on this road. Take a leisure walk on this road and you can feel the energy."
,,"Shopping, shopping all around...",4.0,,"Right from the plazas for heavy bargains to high brands and good indian food near courts/oz... orchard street takes it all for shopping. Visit in the evening for the glorious looks with lights all around. The courts shop near oz is ideal for buying TVs and music systems (Have Yamaha brand exclusively here).
Watch out the prices and compare them before buying. check out the warranty clauses too."
,,For those that love to shop,3.0,,"If you love to shop you will love orchard road, if shopping is not your thing then I suggest you visit the many other fabulous attractions on offer in Singapore. A highlight of orchard road are the lights in the trees along the street. The area does also allow an escape from the heat and humidity in the many multicoloured shopping centres....orchard road is easy to access via the MRT with stops at either end and centrally."
,,Shopping shopping,4.0,,Orchard road is very famous for shopping. You can find everything in here. But price is not cheap This time they make decorations with many flowers and heart for valentine.
,,Very Very Busy,3.0,,"Went at night during first week of December. Makes Oxford Street in London feel like a quiet village.
Amazing sights and sounds, multiple malls with repetitive high end shops. As a non shopper it was a nice experience but with two kids (8&5) I was glad to leave. A public toilet in one of the malls was the cleanest and plushest I have ever seen and put a 5 start hotel to shame. You would never see this in the UK.Sums up Singapore - modern, opulent, civilised and very clean. But I don't like shopping !"
,,stores and more stores,5.0,,"the shopping is first class. every store and designer is represented here in one form or another. even if you're not a shopper you have to admire the beauty of the windows and merchandise. there are also great cafés and restaurants along the way. during the christmas holidays the light displays were amazing. there were so many people, yet, no one threw garbage on the streets, fabulous."
,,New Malls and New Look,4.0,,We were pleasantly surprised by the new look that this famous stretch of road has taken on just after two years. Quite a few new malls have been built along the stretch opposite the Center Point. The pedestrian walkway has also been spruced up.
,,Favorite shopping strip.,5.0,,"It is not as cheap as it used to be but lots of interesting malls to go shopping. Try Tsangs next to the Marriott hotel, always good discounts there. Takashimaya is a great mall with brand names shop and the prices to go with it. Food malls are great too. A greta way to spennd a day or two in Singapore."
,,shopping till you drop,4.0,,"If you do not enjoy shopping....move on.
If you like shopping, put on your sneekers and go for it.
Any brand, any fashionada, any taste you will find it.
Even more important, look for the brand in the main street, then go to the upper levels of the shopping malls and find the same 50% less expensive"
,,better than before,4.0,,"It was nice to walk around and did some shopping. It's been changed lots of things since I was there 10years ago. But before it was easier to find things around there .
Still the same there are lots of traffic and many people.
At the end of street, it is a building with under ground food market.
If you are looking for the local cheap food, then, it is the right place."
,,Characterless crowded street full of malls,2.0,,"Went to Orchard Road as we had read it was the most iconic street of Singapore. Only stayed there for a short while because it's just a characterless crowded street, with lots of malls and full of shops that can be found anywhere else in the world."
,,Start at top and then keeping going through the malls,4.0,,"Yes very commercial, yes very busy but soak up the noise and the atmosphere. Our 19 year old granddaughter just loved it, our daughter in law loved it and we always do the Orchard Road crush at age 65 years young. Use the MRT train system to get back to your hotel, cheapest and best way to travel in Singapore. Food halls always best in basement areas of centres and reasonable prices even in the best shopping centres. Head to Marks and Spencer's for good quality goods, Robinsons for bargains and Isetan for reasonable prices and quality."
,,Why?,2.0,,"Nothing but overpriced name brands, and overpriced stores. You cant walk along the road, you get stuck in confusing underground malls with the soul of a versace bag.

If you need to kill time there, go to Kinokuniya, but even though the range is vast, the prices are high (like the rest of the place)."
,,Shopping ONLY,3.0,,"If you decide to go to Orchard, which is the iconic street of Singapore, thats mean SHOPPING! In here theres a lot of shopping mall with tons of stall to satisfied your passion to shopping!"
,,Paradise for shoppers,4.0,,"Visit orchard road when singapore sale period.. Almost all stores, sell things with big discount. Along the street, so many shops and restaurants. You need to get lost here so you can really see all things around the area. All famous branded stores on the right and left side from this road. If this is your first time to singapore, mandatory to visit this road."
,,Shopping paradise,3.0,,"I love shopping at orchard road. I could walk from one end to the other just shopping and sometimes stopping for an ice cream, yoghurt, sandwich or even a movie. There are quite a few book shops where you can browse and for me, I collect beautiful and cute journals, so one of my favourite stops would be kikki k at Ion Orchard. I also like to visit the kate spade boutique and also the takashimaya shopping mall. Sometimes, I would have lunch at soup spoon at plaza singapura with my sister or friends. The best time to visit will be Christmas cause the whole orchard road will be decorated and lighted up. It is also a very good time to shop for Christmas gifts for family and friends."
,,Hark the herald angles sing,4.0,,"We stayed in a hotel on Orchard road in Singapore, great place to stay, it was a few days before Christmas, after dark the street was full of Christmas lights and carols being playing in the shops and malls. Lots of bustle and life, local food stalls available. Temperature about 25c and a little humid but not enough to bother me, at one point it rained lightly. Definitely the place to stay.
Singapore is a very clean place and very safe."
,,Shopping or Not... Take A Stroll,5.0,,"This is truly a shopping haven. A long stretch of shopping malls on both sides of the road. You can get basically anything here. Even if you do not plan to buy anything, this place offers nice ambience just walking on the main road, especially at night. It's fun people watching, and enjoy the malls' nice decorations."
,,Busy but if it's shopping that you want!,4.0,,very busy but it was beautiful at Christmas! Light galore! Ice cream at Cold Stone lived up to the brand expectations!
,,Great the first time but too expensive lah,3.0,,"Orchard Road (read Singapore) is way overpriced and if you like shopping go to KL instead.

It is worth a stroll along Orchard Road but over recent years there has not been much change and once you have been there a couple of times it does not offer much."
,,"Shopping on Orchard Road, Singapore.",4.0,,"Plenty of shopping here but a lot of the same as well. You could spend a lot of time in and out of the shopping malls without buying anything, it is an eye opener seeing so many shops but it can be exspensive as well."
,,Shopping only,3.0,,Go there only for a short stop when not visiting the malls. There are not many things to see. Look Emerald Hill Rd. at Somerset MRT with nice buildings and short pedestrian zone at beginning of Orchard Rd..
,,"2015 New Year Eve is not that bright, crowded as before",3.0,,"Orchard Road seems rather quiet, not many people gathered as my experience some years before. Overall Orchard Road was not as bright as before."
,,"Deep pockets one side, cheap pockets the other",3.0,,"What a contrast is Orchard Road. With Tangs and Happy Plaza offering the usual myriad of cheap stuff along with sharky tailors touting ceaselessly for custom on the one side. On the other side is a maze of underground and above ground elite brand stores that we observed usually with more staff than customers. Many cheap local style food outlets everywhere, especially in the underground but mostly everywhere. The cheap side is something to behold on a Sunday. Descending like gulls on a dump site, there are thousands of females from the alien workforce that provides menial workers for the hotels and the moneyed elite of Singapore. There is so much noise from their raucous squawking and so much congestion as they mill around the cheap side buildings one can only wonder where the joy is. Most seem to come for the meeting up rather than the shopping so why don't they choose a nice park? Who knows? Buses and trains are crammed full of these people which makes Orchard road a place to avoid on a Sunday. There are many other shopping districts available that offer better pricing with less congestion."
,,"Overwhelming, challenging, over the top Orchard Road",3.0,,"Visited here for Christmas 2014 to see the lights. There were plenty of lights, but the street is overwhelming and crowded. The shopping centres are challenging to navigate. I didn't really like the Christmas lights, as in much of Singapore, the Christmas decorations are over the top and excessive and lacking in taste. We came in via ION / Orchard Road MRT, and walked down to Somerset MRT. The highlight of Orchard Road was the Japanese food court in the basement of the Takashimaya department store. Also, the bookstore Kinokuniya in the Takashimaya department store is good due to the range of books available, but the books are expensive."
,,What fabulous Christmas decorations,5.0,,"We were shocked to see such incredible Christmas decorations. Better than anything I have ever seen in NY and we have lived here for 40 years! The entire road was covered in beautiful colorful decorations. There were people dressed up as wise men on the streets. It was incredible. Orchard road in itself is an incredible shopping mecca. Even if you aren't in the mood to shop it is a sight to see, everything is so clean and new and gorgeous."
,,Too many top brands and not enough middle brands,3.0,,"There are just too many top brands in Orchard Road.
It really needs a mix of middle brands which we only really found at 313 Somerset. This is a nice spot with a lovely vibe.
You need a day to traverse this strip. You probably wont buy much."
,,Worth Visiting its impressive,4.0,,"Definitely can be challenging it's all very good. Lots and lots of shops. You are spoilt for choice. I don't think you can do it all in one day. I'm going back again to cover what I missed.

Tip - good walking shoes, deep pocket, decide what end you want to start."
,,Too much of a good thing?,3.0,,"No trip is complete I am told to Singapore without visiting Orchard Road. I first visited here in 1981 and it is now unrecognisable. If shopping is your thing you will be in paradise, all the main stores and designer brands are available here, its a mecca for consumerism. A great variation of cafes and restaurants abound, so you have plenty of opportunities to rest those tired feet! For me though, the character of Singapore seems to have been lost, look hard and it's still there, opposite the Mandarin Orchard hotel, just off Orchard Road there are some great bars and night scene, in beautifully restored buildings."
,,Great shopping destination,4.0,,"A must when in Singapore, this huge street offers loads of shopping options and you can shop to your heart's content. It has its own unique atmosphere, wide streets and lots of people. If you would like some drink, however, stop at any bar you find on your way as there aren't many outside the shopping centres. We grieved not stopping at Hard Rock Cafe for quite a long time as there were no other options to sit and relax."
,,"A marathon, but worth it!",5.0,,"If you do not visit Orchard Road when in awesome Singapore, you are missing out! Orchard Road shopping district goes for quite a few blocks with mainly the same shops in each mall. The best mall I found to be was ION Orchard. It had everything from Prada and Dior to Forever 21 and H&M, something for everyone."
,,So many shops!,4.0,,We spent a morning wandering along Orchard Road both window shopping and having fun making purchases. There was a wide range of shopping options and we tended to visit the more affordable brands but enjoyed seeing the high brand stores as well. The malls are air conditioned which provided a welcome relief from the humidity or rain spells we experienced.
,,"Fantastic, but a marathon",4.0,,"You cannot come to Singapore without visiting Orchard Road.
At night, it is gorgeous with lights everywhere. During the day, it is a shopping marathon.....wear comfortable shoes, and have some top cover for those a/c shops.
But be aware. Nearly each mall has the same set of stores in it. And once you have seen one Cartier watch, or Gucci handbag, you will have seen lots!
Ngee Ann City with Takashimaya is VERY upmarket, Lucky Plaza is definitely not."
,,Great place,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a nice 5 minute walk from the Shangri La Hotel. It has everything you want in shops.
You have all types of food to try out and it is not expensive. You can get a dish with noodles and fruit for about £3.00 which is excellent value and tastes delicious. These places are frequented by the locals as well. Everything is freshly made."
,,Great Shopping Place,5.0,,"Really great for shoppers, so good for a walk and enjoy the virtual sound of birds chirping. Exciting!"
,,3 January 2015,5.0,,Tha place was decorated for christmass.It was exciting to walk around.Shopping malls right and left .A walk and visit in them is a must
,,Has to be some of the best shopping around,5.0,,"Amazing place to come and shop and the variety is out of this world, I have never seen so many shops including Brand Names stores and many others, The restaurants are fabulous and the choices of food is fantastic, Singapore also has some great Buildings as well, Orchard was great because there is so much happening there and easy access to everywhere else as well."
,,Orchard road,4.0,,"SG has been my fav place in Asia, part of it is bec I love to shop at orchard road. The only challenge is the pedestrian lane for crossing orchard is scarse. I miss the performances along ngee an city this time."
,,For Brand Conscious,3.0,,If you are brand conscious then this is perfect place for you. Road full of shopping malls. Looks very happening from outside. Worth taking a walk and buying some branded stuffs.
,,perfect place for shopping,4.0,,"The orchard Road is the perfect place for shopping, has many shopping centers, hotels and restaurants. You can walk all the 2.2 km enjoying the street life and having a traditional chili crab and a draft beer in one of many restaurants."
,,Wonderful Shoppers Mecca,5.0,,"There are numerous shopping centres to enter and enjoy along Orchard Road. Prices correspond to the stores one enters, however there is an unending selection of goods for the very budget minded up to an including those with packets of cash to blow. As a gift for one family member I entered the lovely Takamayisha Centre and found a lovely Swarovski Crystal ring that was reasonably priced and on sale at 50% off. I would not have been able to match this for three or four times the cost back home in North America. Yes, I saw items at Hermes, Harry WInston, and Tiffany that would blow a year's salary if not ten years...but they are there not only for the wealthy consumer, but also to give the browser a ""spiritual lift"" because they are so beautiful. Singapore and Orchard Road I highly recommend!"
,,"Great shops, beautiful Christmas decorations",5.0,,"my wife and I visited here on Christmas Eve. There were at least 20,000 other people there with us. The stores were all decorated beautifully and the streets were as well."
,,Everything you could ever want you'll get,4.0,,"There is no shortage of malls shops and eateries. The prices in Singapore are not cheap by Asian standards but if money is no object you will find everything you want to buy on this road. Great food massage shops that are welcomed after to have pounded the pavement for hours.
High end stores are right on the Orchard MRT.
Keep you 20c handy if you need to visit the toilet in Lucky Plaza."
,,Christmas on Orchard rd,5.0,,Wonderful experience to see the Christmas lights all along Orchard Rd. Many acts and dressed characters performing while you wander which made one very entertaining evening. I have been to Singapore many times but this was extra special. What a selection of shopping Malls and eateries there is something for everyone no matter what the age. You can roam around this area day and night and feel so safe. One of the cleanest cities in the World.
,,Best Shopping Experience,5.0,,If shopping is the priority item on your agenda then Orchard Road it is. Its a collection of all the best brands and big labels in one street. You get individual shops in malls as well as the convenient department-store option where you get all the different brands in one store. There are also plenty of places to grab a bite...
,,Christmas lights - wow,4.0,,We were in Orchard Rd at Christmas time and the street decorations and shop lights were fantastic. A lot of high end fashion label stores but not ordinary clothes or gift shops. Have to use underground walkway to get from one side of Orchard Rd to the other which is great if you can find it.
,,A must visit for the shopperholic,5.0,,"Shopperholics rejoice, here's a chance for you to walk the streets. From food to fashion and everything thinkable, you name it, they have it. from the most chic brands to the common street items, movies or just a nice stroll down to see what's buzzling. Each mall has it's unique features. What you need now is a deep pocket and a nice pair of flats to walk the whole stretch, that's if you didn't get stuck at one mall shopping your day off!!
Bonus: Visit during end year to see the malls and streets all decked up to the season to wow everyone, quite different from the West really. Only warning: End year- Brollies please.
It's so easy to move about, you'll never be 'lost'
Setback: Malls ain't linked up, so if it does pour, you're stuck within an area, but good enough to just shop and eat, rest and relax.
Shopping Tip: Do your own homework, bring your calculators, start shopping!"
,,Shopping Street,4.0,,"Orchard Road is Singapore's largest shopping district, got all major brands. The whole street is lined with shopping malls, the streets are clean."
,,"orchard is very happening, but beware",3.0,,"in orchard is good to shop for fashion, or in departmental store.but not electronics. somehow there is no reliable electronics shop along the way. many con man around.
for electronics I think Court departmental store in Faber house and Harvey normal in centre point 3rd floor and best Denki in takashimaya 5th level they not too bad as many items has a price tag.
do not go in to small electronics or phone shop as they are on commission and they are not honest just want to make a quick dollars.
when departmental store has offer is something a bargain shop what you need."
,,Luxury,5.0,,You can find what you want in Orchard Road.Technological shopping or luxury shopping. Fine restaurants on the road.
,,Love it,5.0,,"Went to Orchard road shopping WOW the shopping malls were terrific from not too expensive to expensive, saw shops with things i have never seen before and the food terrific in one of the m a lls so much variety very hard to choose You must go to orchard road and spend a couple of days shopping"
,,The Place for Shopping,5.0,,"If you come to Singapore for shopping then you have to visit Orchard Road. It's a long street and there are a lot of shops, so shopping wise there is something for everyone there. All of the top brands are represented as well as some less well known to European travellers. Price and quality are very high and there were significant sales when we were there.

There are a lot of people on this street, so take good care of your personal belongings. Crime is very low in Singapore but there is still the possibility of pickpockets, as with every major city."
,,Just another shopping experience,3.0,,"Orchard road is probably the most ""happening"" place in Singapore when it comes to shopping.
From local brands to famous international brands, you will probably find whatever you want in this place.
However, when it comes down to the fact of whether it's special or not, I'd say it's yet another shopping experience just like any other place around the world.
Still would recommend to go because of the scale!"
,,Shopping day,5.0,,"Don't full yourself! You need a full day on this street. There are almost all (and maybe more :)) ) of the high end fashion brands present here. Most of them with more than one shop. Coming from Europe, Ck, Burberry, Armani, Versace, Dior, D&G seemed rather expencive. Never the less, Guess and Armani Exchange were very well priced. Also, if you want something at a good value try an Apple store. If they have it in stock, the iPhone and iPad are very very priced."
,,Beware of Camera/Electronic Shop on Orchard Road,1.0,,"The high end stores of every name are beautiful to window shop unless you have a large pocket book. We were wandering Orchard Road mid way taking a few photo snaps here and there when we were approached by a local business man, inquiring how we are enjoying the city and offering travel tips for tours etc..as we continued to walk. We are visiting our daughter who is recently working in Singapore, so some of the tips we already knew.

He advised he worked at the Mandarin hotel, which was across the road from us, so we continued to listen as we strolled. My husband had a Sony camera around his neck, which I now believe was the mark in the crowd for this target. He eventually after many travel tips advised us to make sure we stopped at this camera shop just up the road as it offered duty free on camera and all electronic items and less expensive than the blocks of stores we had been passing. All made sense..and we were looking for deals on these items. He said he was going this way and guides us.

The store called Camera.Comp Specialist is on Orchard Rd..just farther up from the Mandarin Hotel, across the road and offers all cameras, lenses, IPad, cell phones and all related electronics.

Our daughter bought a Samsung cell phone with intention of using phone with SIM cards pay as you go, rather than a plan, which he advised would work. Short and sweet back to her place in Singapore, to discover the phone was locked and could not be used with any SIM cards purchased.

When we called the store we were advised that they thought we were tourists and taking the phone out of the country and not a resident looking to use. Oh so tourists get ripped off as they are already out of the country by the time they find out it will not work. What kind of business are you running....Because she was local and threatened posting warnings to other Expats of Singapore about uthe scam, they finally agreed to refund her, but not without lots of challenges...

BEWARE....before you buy anything here and know your prices for cameras, electronics and accessories as they also tried the pressure sales making you think you are getting a heck of a deal.

If you web search the business name Camera.Comp Specialists Pte Ltd you will also see bad reviews from other customers who were ripped off."
,,Orchard Road Singapore,5.0,,"An excellent place to just walk down in the evening time. One must take MRT til orchard road and then walk till Dhoby Ghaut MRT. The place was very well done during new year eve. So many mall and so many places to eat, shop, wine , pub are available. There will also be a lot of persons performing some arts/ stunts/ singing on the road. U might like to give them a small tip. Overall an excellent place."
,,Christmas on Orchard Road not to be missed,5.0,,"Spent time in New York, Paris and Singapore in December, and I must say Singapore/Orchard road had by far the best Christmas displays. Loads of people on Orchard looking at the lights, displays etc but some how people traffic kept on moving."
,,"expensive, yet expansive!",4.0,,"Make a list of the world's most coveted brand names and what you have is the Orchard Road directory!! If you're not Ms or Mr Moneybags, you're not going to like the fruits in this orchard... then again, window shopping is absolutely free:)

Thankfully it was Christmastime when we visited and the entire street had come alive with little elves and large Santas, twinkling lights and plentiful pine-trees... it was oh-so-beautiful!

During daytime it is shopper's paradise (perhaps) but come nightfall and all the Singapore streets lead to Orchard Road... people are gaping and gushing and generally going ga-ga! You may not find anything very affordable here, yet you cannot afford to miss this vital part of the city. Expensive, Orchard Road still represents the most expansive spirit of Singapore."
,,Great for shopping,4.0,,"We went over the christmas break so was a little crowded. But the place was decorated very beautifully. There are malls for all tastes. Mustafa, Lucky Plaza etc ugh!! Cheap and nasty. Wife loved some of the other malls though, quite a a few high end (unaffordable!) designer labels. Genearally, nice clean and miles of shopping :)"
,,Our favorite place,5.0,,we simply love this road. and make beautiful memories. we've been coming to Singapore for the last 8 years and never get tired of this road.
,,Best place to shop,4.0,,"This is one busy street; crowded but not observably not chaotic. We went to this place to shop the day before we left. There's a long line of shops both for the branded and otherwise. And so a splurge here and there is quite practicable and will largely depend on one's
available funds. But for the budget conscious, nothing beats Lucky Plaza. Many of the shops here have Filipinos in their employ who are eager to attend to the zealous ""kabayan""shopper."
,,Must Visit During Festives,4.0,,"What makes Orchard Road different from the regular stretch of roads in Singapore is the decorations on trees and along the road according to the various festive seasons. It is a worthwhile visit place of attraction during Christmas, Chinese New Year Eve & other public holidays (like Deepavali) just to see pretty lighted decorations that are unique to each festival. Visitors may also be able to catch some of the street performances and take photos with the various interesting statues that are located along the street. However, be warned that it is very crowded over the weekends and on public holidays. Worth a visit but try to avoid the weekend and public holiday crowd."
,,It was ok I guess,3.0,,"What can I say, there was a lot of shopping, some average food courts and pretty much everything you would find in a big mall. Nothing particularly special unless you are going with the intention of blowing a lot of cash."
,,Shoppers paradise!,5.0,,"After consuming a mandatory buffet breakfast at your hotel relieve the guilt by walking the entire Orchard Road precinct. Take an umbrella in the rainy season as there is a tendency for a sudden downpour. There are all the major fashion brands and although it can become abit repetitive across a number of complexes it is an exercise in indulgence. Tangs and Takashimaya offer great choices and plenty of European sizes and for something out of the ordinary Desigual is a nice change.
A lunchtime sojourn at the Marriott hotel offers a wonderful Yum Cha style lunch and a trip into Lucky Plaza reminds you of the old style vendors that was the Singapore of yesteryear. Ion Centre and Paragon are both top end retailers with plenty to tempt the shopaholic. The best season is June when the sales were really something! Christmas time offers stunning window displays and festive decorations but the sales did not compare with only 30% off most store prices and only limited stock reductions."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"There are two metro stations located on two ends of this shopping street. Orchard and somerset. While most of the high end malls are located closer to orchard, it makes sense to start from orchard and take somerset on the way back. If you take a taxi, forget what i mentioned above."
,,Its worth a visit,4.0,,Its very crowded and busy place. Lots of shopping options . Some really good bars/pub as well. Lots of restaurants Its certainly worth a visit for nice shopping experience.
,,The singapore brand shopping mecca.,3.0,,"Orchard Road is great, but depending on where you've been before, it may not be the best. It is a shopping mecca, and it's a shopping mecca on both sides of the street (and it's not easy to cross from one side of the street to the other without walking a decent distance). Definitely worth a look with if you're a newbie to Orchard Road. But if you've travelled elsewhere, and to far bigger cities, I dare say it won't be amazing for you. But if shopping is your thing, and you want to do that in Singapore I would definitely recommend it. Food shops, brand shops as far as the eye can see. But take a full wallet full of cash and cards because you'll need it!"
,,Shop Till Your Drop,4.0,,Feeling rather like a gopher with the endless miles of shops below ground we took time to pop up to street level to enjoy the amazing Christmas decorations. you can connect between several MRT stations a you can find everything from Designer goods to mass merchandisers. Take your credit card and enjoy!
,,Shops! shops!! everywhere!!!,4.0,,"The hub for shopping in Singapore has plenty on it and nearly equally as much underneath. A couple of intersections are not directly accessible to the pedestrian, so crossing the street requires you to a venture underground where your greeted by many malls with numerous arteries that must be navigated just to find the exit back to the surface and hopefully.... the other side of the road. If you like shopping then its possible you'll never surface. Night time during Christmas this street becomes a visual experience that is ultimately worth doing as an evenings entertainment in itself, if only for the sheer volume of lights, tinsel, Xmas trees etc. that's going on. Plenty of food, facilities & street entertainment to keep evoeryne amused"
,,Shopping and eating in Orchard Road,5.0,,"Whenever I visit Singapore my first stop is Orchard Road. It is crowded, but bearable particularly if you want to going to the variety of shops and department stores all with something good to offer. Not far from Somerset station are a variety of tailors on hand to design or copy some clothes for you. If this does not appeal to you, have a massage on offer by an army of men and women all willing to unwind your body to a state of relaxation."
,,"Shop,shop shop",5.0,,"Really busy place ,orchard road is full of malls restaurants
There are plenty of shops catering for every budget .
The street was lit up at night with Christmas decorations and it was full of people shopping for bargains .
It was a little crowded t night but we found this added to the atmosphere .
We loved the whole atmosphere of orchard road ,and something for everyone ."
,,Worth visit at least once,4.0,,"Very BUSY street. Actually, nothing is historical about this place, all you can see here is malls, restaurant, branded boutique. If you like to shop, this might be the perfect place for you. Come and visit here at least once, if you don't like shopping you can always enjoy the street performers, some of them are really interesting."
,,Worth a visit but don't expect amazement,3.0,,Definitely worth a visit but not worth spending lots of time on this expensive street. A large range of shops and lots of crowds so if wary of crowds probably best to avoid. Lots of seating areas and the tourism office has some helpful ideas if stuck for ideas. Worth a walk down at night to see the street at sunset/night.
,,Fab at Christmas,5.0,,"Really a gorgeous walk from top to bottom at Christmas time. The decorations are fantastic and there is a competition between the shopping malls - who can do the best decorations. There are plenty of shops to stroll through for all tastes, but even those who have no interest in walking through shops will enjoy this street. We visited in 2010. You need a few hours to do the whole road including shops"
,,Very busy!,4.0,,"Although we have visited in December we've also visited in other months. It is a really busy place to shop!
It is worth a visit as the malls are big & have a wide selection of stores for every budget but be prepared for a busy place.
If you don't like crowds avoid the pedestrian access nights, we went to the Dec one (1st Sat of the month) and it was crazy busy. It's busier on Sundays too as a lot of domestic workers have their day off & meet up on Orchard.
It's worth driving/walking down at night over the Christmas period to see the lights & mall displays - if you're walking nip into the shopping malls to see their decorations. There are lots of seating areas on the street & in the malls if you need to rest tired legs with numerous places to eat & drink and don't forget the food courts in the malls.
If you fancy a birds eye view of Orchard try ion's observation deck on floors 55/56. You can see all the sights."
,,Expensive Shopping Street,4.0,,"This is an expensive shopping street at Singapore for branded products..Series of malls adore this street at night with well lit outside of the buildings. Definatelt good view.. Street is also decorated for Christmas and new year.

All time this will be too crowded by shoppers and pass timers..

Well connected by MRT at Orchard Station on North South line aka Red Line..

Not much indian food options available.."
,,Becareful when you shop,3.0,,"I guess today's Singapore is not like the Safe Singapore as I used to know. We shopped at some stores on Orchard, and by Orchard, I'm not talking about grey area shopping malls like Lucky Pl...I was shopping using S$ cash, and found out later on that I was given a change of10 Malay Ringgit in the middle of a stack of S$10, which is worth only a third of S$10. 10 Malaysian Ringgit looks similar in size and color to S$10...so be careful!"
,,Best location for ice cream bread,4.0,,"I'm not a fan, but if you're hankering ice cream wrapped in a slice of bread, orchard road is the place to go. There is a guy there who sells it. Not sure the appeal. It doesn't strike me as something that would taste good, but people seem to want it. If you don't want this, go for the shopping. The place has everything."
,,A must walk on singapore,4.0,,"Spent your night strolling down the orchard especially on christmas and new year. They have lots of performances, christmas trees, and great discounts. The people are gathering until midnight, really fun. It is like the heart of shopping place on singapore."
,,Great shopping experience,4.0,,"Shopping heaven. Many shops to explore. Many choices to cater for different needs. In the event you are hungry, there are a few food courts that you can go to. Recommend to go to the Food Republic. Many choices."
,,Orchard Rd Singapore,4.0,,It is beautifully decorated with lights at night during christmas period. It is a tourist attractions and the best decorated lightings will win a prize. It is a long stretch of road from the junction of tanglin rd to beach rd. It is clean and safe with mall on the side. The Mandarin hotel is along Orchard rd and CK Tang departmental stall is famous for its specialty in fashions
,,wow longest shopping road,5.0,,"it was my first ever experience to see such long road with full of world class high brand shops on every steps..What they don't have there!! Just imagine and it comes true , the orchard ion, takashimaya, orchard tower, ;lucky plaza, shaw house .. wow its unbelievable. You wont know your wallet is empty here .. Its full of world class big brands...."
,,World class shopping,5.0,,This is one of the best shopping streets in the world. There is a mall every few steps. You can find any brands you can imagine. The only issue is that shopping is a bit expensive in Singapore comparing to US and Europe.
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"Probably the most famous road in Singapore. It is the main shopping district, lined with the world's top fashion brands.

Orchard Road is home to numerous shopping malls and arcades, all of which though carry very similar boutiques, but they all have different look and feel, giving the shoppers all new experiences."
,,Oxford Road on steroids...,4.0,,"...to quote my wife! Lots of shops, shopping malls, places to eat. In terms of contrast, I say Chinatown is where you shop by cash, Orchard Rd is where you shop by card. About 45-60 minutes walk from the Parkroyal, through Fort Canning Park."
,,Beautiful city street.,4.0,,Orchard Road looked outstanding in all the Christmas lights. Singapore had gone to a lot of effort to dress the street and it looked marvellous.
,,Christmas time,5.0,,"Right it's Christmas time in Singapore expect something a bit special.
Every hotel makes a real effort with their decorations from fancy lights to window dressing.
The road from top to bottom is decorated with lights across the roads and every so often some sort of Christmas scene that has been thoroughly thought out , you have photo opportunities galore and much more , fancy a coffee or a beer or food from every region in the world you can imagine.
You have a great medley of cultures here and you are so safe when walking round or shopping.
It's a must at least once in your time.
Come enjoy relax and be happy."
,,If you like shopping - then Orchard Road is a must,4.0,,"This is probably the most well known shopping road in Singapore. You find everything, from upscale malls, to small shops, plenty of restaurants, always crowded particularly during daytime.
In December you can see lots of Christmas decoration and lights, and Orchard Road changes into a different spirit.
I believe a visit to Singapore without at least a stroll on Orchard Road is incomplete."
,,Most lively place of Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard road is the most happening place of Singapore.You can find sexy malls with sexy crowd.There are other shops also who sell goods at cheap rates.I bought soveneirs , chocolates etc etc from here on my short trip to SG. Loved the atmosphere there.Dhoby ghat station is on orchard road so one can go to anywhere. Hop-on Hop off bus stops at orchard road as well.So staying at Orchard road is the best option.All the best hotels of SG are on and around the orchard road."
,,"You name it, it is all there within a short distance",4.0,,"December is like a pilgrimage. Evenings, the best way to get around is walk or subway. Christmas is in the air. Malls have musicians and carols are sung in the main lobby. Some have outdoor performances. Rain is part of it all. So they cover the happenings.

Shopaholics and foodies - it is a must place. But even to absorb the hectic pace, you need the stamina to watch, experience it and wonder how it all functions like clockwork.

Orchard Road is decorated like any main street in a Western capital. A great place to have been once at least."
,,The Shopping Mall Central of Singapore,4.0,,"It's hard to visit Singapore and not come across Orchard Road! December is a great month to visit as there are lots of Christmas lights set-up both in each of the malls as well as well on the street itself (all being color coordinated which is much more pleasing on the eye!). It's also probably the 'coolest' time of year as well (by Singapore Standards....).

If you are on holidays and want to explore, day time is probably better as it can be quite crowded at night when many of the locals return from work. In terms of food places, you are definitely spoilt for choice, but there is often quite a bit of a queue in any restaurants (especially on a Friday or Saturday night) so plan to get there early if possible.

Many of the shops and malls are under ground. So hopping from one mall to the next can sometimes be convenient, but it can also be quite easy to get lost. I would also suggest visiting the Visitor's center. The staff can offer great advice and help point you in the right direction.

If you want high end shopping destinations, head towards Ion (many brands there I had not even heard of), but for anything else, head towards the other side of Orchard Road.

Public Transport is also very good with many bus, taxi and rail (MRT) stations available."
,,Shopping? Thousands of options. Walking? YES!,5.0,,"Walk up and down Orchard Road, pick up a couple of souvenirs or just enjoy the thousands of different shops and options.

During the holiday season, the decorations add even more to the festive look and feel of Orchard Road.

TIP: Although we did not haggle in our two purchases, we saw several people do so. One merchant, even without us saying anything, dropped the price of an item by 22 percent."
,,Fantastic Christmas Decorations!!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a must - the length of the road plus the atmosphere at the very end of November was absolutely fantastic!! I have to say the majority of the shops were out of our price range but so pretty to look at!! We enjoyed our visit to Tangs - one of the original shops from years ago!! The assistants were very helpful and friendly and the ambience was just great!!
The number of malls are unbelievable - you'd need at least a week to wander round them!! We travelled the entire length of the road on the hop on/ hop off bus in the daylight and at night with all the Christmas decorations lit - amazing!! Then to walk part of it just completed the experience!!"
,,Overwhelming temple to boundless consumerism,2.0,,"I'll start by saying I don't go to malls at home if I can help it. And this is Land of Malls on Plastic and Platinum Steroids. Much of it is underground, windowless, of course, with very poor signage so good luck if you are trying to find a specific store. It goes on and on, one mall blending into another, levels on levels. Obviously people like it. The hallways are relatively narrow and constantly crowded, so it's fairly claustrophobic. People are too busy or too lost themselves to help with fairly simple questions, like ""Which way is the subway?"" You can get a massage, eat, get your Starbucks, Gucci, piercing, stock up on diamonds or drop a wad on cosmetics, shoes, electronics, or any other consumer item. There's a vast and excellent bookstore: Kino. However, most of the shops are relatively small. The overall vastness and amount of money coming and going were for me a bit sickening. Very little says ""Singapore"" in the merchandizing (total globalization) although there is quite a variety of Asian restaurant chains, including one in which the soba is made in front of a big window. That was interesting but I'd have no idea how to find it again. I assume there are rest rooms somewhere but I didn't see signs for them. I think it would be very difficult to negotiate in a wheelchair. Maybe there are elevators but again, no signs."
,,"Efficent, clean, top end shops. No real sence of old Singapore",4.0,,"I have been visiting Singapore once a year over the past 15 years to visit my daughter. Each year so much changes, reinvention is the way forward as far as the people in charge believe. All very impressive but at the cost of loosing an old world charm. I do realise the forward thinking is good for the native Singaporeans but don't destroy all your heritage. Visiting Singapore is like visiting a theme park. Regimented, clean, relatively safe compaired to other capital cities, ever changing,.. Selling is foremost, top brands, lesser known brands all getting a foot in catering for the ex-pat spenders. I do describe Singapore to my friends as a theme park. Orchard road is fast and well catered for by the Underground network, (MRT) fares are cheap, the trains clean and reliable.. Young people always offer their seat to older passengers when the train is full.. All that is really missing is local culture. I suspect it could be found if you were to travel to further out districs but within central Singapore, apart from museums you will not see anything of the old Singapore."
,,"Frantic on a Sunday, but go.",4.0,,"A huge selection of malls that are cathedrals to shopping. Worth going to, to just to look inside at the different styles and some very high level retail opportunities. Good selection of food at the Somerset St MTA entry. You can spend huge amounts or nothing at all whilst soaking up the atmosphere. Great at Xmas as so many decorations, but just a great place to watch people."
,,Christmas Capital,5.0,,"I have never seen a road or street done up so much for Christmas,it was quite amazing. The display goes on for such along time down the middle of the street and along all the shops on both sides. This to us was the best thing about Orchard Road, as the expensive shops were out of our range. A Stunning Christmas Display!"
,,Heaven for Shopping,4.0,,"This street is suitable for Shoppingholics. You can find many giant shopping centers here with the attendance of many famous brands. In Sales Season, you can find very reasonable price for beautiful items, especially my favourite brand: Charles & Keith"
,,Any big street in any big town,2.0,,"We were told to go see Orchard Road as it was the most beautiful road in the world. We were told there was large shopping areas, as well as street side vendors. Cab was about $15 each way from our hotel. The Christmas lights were beautiful, but no different than Michigan Avenue in Chicago, or any other large street in the US. There are shops galore, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, etc. Nothing you can't see in any other big city. No local shops. Food is very expensive. Very crowded, especially on a Friday night. Clean and pedestrian friendly. If you like overpriced high end shopping, you will love it. When I travel, I like culture and unique experiences, and this didn't offer that."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"For those of you who know London this road is like a combination of Oxford, Regent and Bond Street all rolled into one but not cheap! The Christmas street decorations were lovely and there were some street entertainers at night"
,,Endless shopping and pedestrian friendly,4.0,,Relaxing yet vibrant with energy with shops with brands from around the world in one street. Plenty of places to sit and watch if you need a break.
,,Shopping and eating paradise,4.0,,Nice shops and restaurants along the whole stretch of orchard orchard...many choices..from budget to upmarket. If you visit in year end.. many photo opportunities for gatherings and memories keepsake...if you dont like shopping it is relaxing to sit down down in a cafe to spend the afternoon. Walk along the road instead of taking cars or public transportation so soak in the atmosphere.
,,Good Walk representing Singapore,4.0,,"Visited July 2014. One should plan to take a walk along Orchard Road instead of just seeing it as part of other attractions.

It is best to walk along the road in the afternoon. You will see huge modern buildings, malls and some historic sights. The mix is a good combination as you can see the development of Singapore in the scenic views along the road."
,,Shoppers paradise !,4.0,,You can spend your year's pay at Orchard Rd. There are so many shops and stores that it will take a few days to visit them all. I had a great suit tailored me and it came out great. A little bit more expensive than Hong Kong though. The only problem with all of Singapore is the cigarette smoke that is ever present. I hope that someday soon they will ban smoking on sidewalks like they do with so many other things.
,,A Shoppers Dream,5.0,,"Hidden along this road among the high end stores are incredible malls. The one I was very impressed with was ION. It is connected to the train station down in the basement and not only has 3 stories of shops underground, but 3 stories above ground. Also there are plenty of eateries and restaurants. But besides this, stroll along the street and take in the sights. The Christmas lights during the holiday season were incredible. They decorate this street Nov. 14 for the holidays!"
,,Shops galore,5.0,,This is great it would take weeks to see all the shops most of them are five storeys high and the streets are so clean . The road must be a mile long there is at least two hundred sops lots of designer ones too every make you can think of .also there is a lot of food halls . Great place for retail therapy
,,Shopping and sightseeing,5.0,,"I had been Orchard Road twice. Whenever I went there, I would find something new and fresh. It is my first time to be in Singapore in early December with a Christmas atmosphere.

The Christmas atmosphere is so strong that you felt that you were in Western countries. Lots of decoration made you feel it was the Christmas day."
,,Shopping street,4.0,,Shopping street where you get all the expensive brands. Worth a visit once while you are in Singapore
,,A hustle and bustle of activities,5.0,,"Every year in November, Orchard Road is the road that everyone must visit. It is so beautifully lighted up and every hotel and shopping centre is really decked up for the Christmas season. There is this feeling of Christmas when you are walking along the five foot way."
,,expensive!,3.0,,"Nice to walk and look at the tall buildings. Can go inside for window shopping. At night, it is lovely with all the lights on. One weekend, they closed the street for partying and doing stuff. Just watched but didn't stay too long. Too much smoking around."
,,Shopper's Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Rd is a shopper's paradise-- the street is home to many hotels and every high end shop imaginable. It also features Robinsons, a department store."
,,Vibrant,5.0,,Its been a long time since I last visited Orchard Road. Very imppressive with the lightings and ongoings
,,THE Singapore experience - free,4.0,,"Lights, shops, more shops, food and more food. However the safe and wide sidewalks are free, the view is free. Few touts, no beggars
Best place to see not only Singaporeans (you can tell the they wear shorts, mostly or office attire) as well as Middle Easterners completely covered from top to toe in black, eastern Europeans, often outside Orchard Tower. Chinese, Indians, Hindus, Muslims, westerners all harmoniously enjoying this little place of peace.
It's generally clean, though one or two smokers and street revelers will leave their trash around. Don't join them!
Duck into a food court for least expensive meals. Just ask people in stores where is the nearest one.
Glittery lights and decorations appear as early as November as Hindus celebrate Deepavali, then Christmas & New Years after which comes Chinese New Year, so the lights may stay up until Valentines, with many variations."
,,Christmas lights really spectaclar,5.0,,"One of the best decorations I have seen, really spectaclar. Other than shopping and eating, it's a good idea to look how pretty the decorations are. Christmas ambience just filled the entire street. Awesome. Am blown away"
,,A Must See site at Night,5.0,,"We went to Orchard Road last night & It was spectacular. The road was lit up with Christmas lights, shops were bright & vibrant, people everwhere. Loved it.."
,,Most Happening Street of Singapore,4.0,,"This is one of the best streets in Singapore with more than 20 shopping malls and top class brand showrooms. You will encounter many different people(sellers) on streets selling you claimed ""original"" Rolex and Tissot watches with the price whatever you say which should be more than $50 SGD, but off course that's your call. Also, the unique thing about this street is, it feels alive even at 2AM, because shops and malls on this street have to pay huge fine if they shut off lights in night..

Great street to walk down and see amazing things."
,,Go at night- the lights are amazing!,4.0,,"Orchard Rd is a sensory overload. There are shopping centers one right after the other- from holy mackerals expensive (Ion) to the fun jumbled reasonably priced (Lucky Plaza). Even if you're not much of a shopper it's well worth spending a few hours just wandering down the street and popping into the centers here & there.

There are also all kinds of food options- ranging from the very nice restaurants to various street food options. If you want to try a mild/sweet/citrusy curry crab head to the 11th floor of the Orchard Central shopping center. The holiday decor there is also way over the top. Think pink lights EVERYWHERE with unicorns with pink hair.

During the Christmas season it's quite the sight to see. I have NEVER seen such an assortment of bright lights and over the top Christmas decor.

It's easy to get to on the MRT.

If you get tired of the lights then head towards Istana Park for some tranquility. When I was there it didn't look like you could see it at night though."
,,Shopping malls and people watching,4.0,,"We live around the corner of Orchard Road in Singapore. It is The Big Street in Singapore, where all the major, often luxury, shopping malls are.

But there are also wide pedestrian areas, huge trees, birds and people-watching all day long.

There is always something happening, there are restaurants, bars, art galleries and what not.

A nice area to stroll around, even when you are not buying anything.

Read about it here:

,,Must see,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise, if you can afford it. Beautiful high end street and Christmas decorations were up - gorgeous and all out, especially at night. Lovely to mosey around and through shops. Beautiful ambience at night with lots of people out."
,,THE BIGGEST SHOPPING STRIP IN THE WORLD,4.0,,"Orchard Road is arguable one of the biggest and definitely most expensive shopping strips on the surface of the Earth!

Think Las Vegas! Many casinos, hard to navigate streets, shining lights. Except replace the casinos with shopping malls. There is literally perhaps about 20+ shopping malls on the strip, each one canvasing multiple levels and home to some of the most expensive designer brands in the world. They are so big that you can perhaps spend a day in each mall!

Orchard Road is truly a Mecca for those with an insatiable penchant for designer brands and those with a bottomless bank account. Be warned though, the prices are probably more expensive than what you can get at home."
,,"ORCHARD ROAD , SINGAPORE",3.0,,Shoppers paradise or consumer overload - well that all depends on what you want and how long you are prepared to walk this very long road of shops to suit all tastes and budgets . Designers shops mixed with street fruit vendors it really is a shoppers dream or shoppers hell .However it is definately a place not to be missed .
,,Shop till you drop!,4.0,,"You can't go to Singapore and not stroll along Orchard Road. And with the Xmas lights on, it is just amazing! Very busy at night, but not to be missed!!"
,,Spectacular Christmas display,5.0,,This street is well worth seeing especially during November/December. It looks like something out of a winter fairytale with thousands of Christmas lights and tree displays. Orchard road is home to many designer brand stores so if you like to shop this is the place for you.
,,orchard Road,5.0,,"Probably the best and most pleasant shopping street in the world where all the top designer brands can be found, plus loads of bargains from clothing to electronic devices such as cameras, laptops and cellphones of the latest designs and at very good prices."
,,Indeed a Great Road!,5.0,,"It's always an invigorating walk up and down Orchard Road. We were there as November turned into December. Orchard was festive and sparkling with Christmas lights and decor. On a weekend, the wide sidewalks are just full of people and more so inside the malls that line this great street. Even if you aren't a shopper, orchard will surely charm you!"
,,So depressing,1.0,,"Mankind living to spend its money, that is what Orchard Road really is. More Rolex shops than you need, prices are typically higher than in other cities in the world. You do find some nice food courts though to lighten things up..."
,,New mall...orchard gateway,4.0,,"Must visit this new mall, orchard gateway. Exit sommerset mrt and viola, you'll see the entry to the mall within a minute. Go to the 3rd flr to check out the view bridge that stretches across Orchard road (the glass sphere too blur for photo shoot, but good to stand and car/people watch.). The mall itself offers interesting lifestyle shop and I like the I.T. and totallyHotStuff shops. And of course, there is the national library (no children's book!) to enjoy the artsy stuff too!"
,,Singapore's Shopping district,4.0,,"In the past 3-5 years, Singapore had been adding more malls to this shopping street. It is a long shopping street that actually stretches between 2 MRT/train stations - Orchard and Somerset. You'll find anything and everything here, from souvenirs, clothes, shoes, electronics, appliances, a bit of furnitures, jewelries and watches, signature items, drugstores, specialty clinics (dentists, health clinics, cosmetic clinics @wheelock), banks, remitance centers and money changers, restaurants/food centers, gym....so i guess this list tells you that there is more to Orchard Rd than high end shopping.

Many tourists may think that as they will ofter alight Orchard station which is just below ION mall - a newer mall where most Signature brands are housed. But you just need to get out of ION and you'll find other malls. For a more affordable brands, alight SOMERSET station and start your mall hoping from 313 Mall."
,,Shopping Shopping Shopping,3.0,,"Only if you have a never ending bank balance would you bother getting off here, but still good for a look especially at Xmas they really know how to do Xmas."
,,Millionaires Row,5.0,,Think of a big name brand and this is where you will find it. Start at ION shopping centre and slowing make your way down the road exploring or the shops.
,,High End Shopping,3.0,,"This street is no different than Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, CA, NYC's 5th Avenue or any number of streets in Ginza, Tokyo. Same high end brand names, same exorbitant prices."
,,Paradise,5.0,,Shopping hub/street of the city. Has all the brands..name it & will find it. Clean road & absolute heaven for shopping enthusiasts. This place is bustling with ppl around & has various malls all through the street.Easily connected via mrt & taxi. Also has hotels for those who wish to stay here. Since christmas is round the corner the entire street including the shops were beautifully decorated.
,,High End Shopping,4.0,,"This makes most luxury shopping look poor. It is block after block of every luxury name on earth, and some of them have 3-4 stores! At Christmas the directions make Rockefeller Center in NYC look like they are Amish."
,,Beautiful street,4.0,,Orchard road is very beautiful but only needs to be seen from a bus/taxi window. The street is full of highly expensive shops like Louis Vuitton etc so there's no point in visiting unless you're rich!
,,for shopping enthusiasts,4.0,,This road is full of shopping options with branded shops and malls. It's a good walk for the shopping enthusiasts..
,,its not Paris or New York,4.0,,"How would one describe Orchard Road? Its not Paris or New York but full of life, bustling with people. Be amazed with the geometric multicolored, shaped, lighted, sequinned structures and malls. Its very modern Asian. The discipline on road lanes, the bus stations and time arrivals. The haven for Shopping lovers. The houses of signature brands and Sex toy shops and lots of hawkers on side streets. And choose december season to be there to check the christmas decors, its like a competition."
,,My worst nightmare is here!,1.0,,"Forty years ago (yes, I know the world has moved on) this was heaven. We would come to Singapore for a long weekend every month as it was cooler and more civilised than Malaya. I loved the Orchard Road, the shopping, the street stalls, the bustle. Now it is hell on earth. You can't MOVE for crowds of people. Claustrophobic hordes of them. And the weird this is that, apart from the tourists, they all seem to be under the age of thirty. Is Logan's Run alive and kicking here in Singapore? Is there some ghastly carousel that spirits folk away, hidden in one of the multitudinous shopping malls? We tried to cross the street and made the mistake of trying to do this safely, by subway. Over an hour later, fighting our way through the endless stream of young maidens who were all rushing in and out of the mobile phone accessory shops, the sunglasses shops and the watch shops, that fill the endless corridors underground, we emerged into daylight at the place where we had started. Terrifying! In this subterranean shopping horror there are lots of signs pointing to 'More Shops' but none to wherever you might hope to go. The Tang Mall, by the way, which is massive and also endless, used to be a lovely department store. This city has sold its soul to the devil! I am never going back."
,,Designer shop heaven!,4.0,,"If you're in need of anything while you're away, or perhaps just enjoy shopping, this is the place to be - it even has an M & S in amongst all the Gucci and Prada shops! It was unbelievably busy, but glad we experienced it. There are also numerous coffee shops and restaurants that you can sit and have a break and watch the world go by."
,,Shopping and eating paradise. Brand collectors paradise,4.0,,"To do: mall hopping is your best bet. Name it and the brand is there for you.

Each mall is a collectors delight. Clothes. Accessories. Bags and food.

With kids: you can hang around till 11-12 with a lot of traffic and things to enjoy. Dancers, performers and just people."
,,Best shopping place ever,5.0,,"Never ending malls. You just have to name any shop or brand and you will find it next to you. Full of restaurants, hotels and cute places and things to take pictures next to."
,,Heaven of shopping !,4.0,,"If u are a fan of shopping, this is your heaven. U can buy anything from low to high quality products. I think all of the famous fashion brands of the world in here such as LV, Prada, Hermes or Rolex. It's so amazing! A long street with many shopping malls and luxury shops. U can go to ION center, Paragon or Tayeshaki for average and luxury things. If u want to buy something cheaper , u can go to Lucky Plaza and Tang plaza, I think almost products come from China. Orchard is also a beautiful street for walking. Hope u enjoy it when u come to Singapore !"
,,Shopping...But not Cheap,5.0,,"The prosperity of Singapore is clearly seen in Orchard Road. Every high end store on earth is here. Gucci, Cartier, Dior. And they were BUSY. It seems that everyone in Singapore has money to spend. Lots of it. Go check it out, if only just to ogle."
,,High end shopping,3.0,,"I've never really been a big fan of Orchard Road, but it's certainly the place to come when you absolutely need to buy that designer handbag or a top end watch. Malls like Ion, Paragon, Takashimaya, 313 Somerset are as good as you get anywhere in the world, but they all tend to merge after a while. Always plenty of interesting people watching to be had as you stroll along."
,,"This is complicated, so read on ...",5.0,,"There is variety along Orchard Road. Shopping - yes! Above ground in hotels and numerous malls, and below ground, in Ion Orchard multi-level mall.
If you are in Singapore for a few days, try to visit Ion Orchard mall on a weekday. It will be easier to navigate, as it will be less crowded. Arrive after 10:00 am if you want to shop, so that the stores will be open. Hint - The public bathrooms in Ion Orchard are equal in style and cleanliness to any five-star hotel.
If you are British, you will be pleased to find both a Marks & Spencer and an H&M. This means that you can buy clothing that is sized to fit Europeans (and Americans) at reasonable prices.
I am ending a four-month stay at one end of Orchard Road, on Orange Grove. At this end, there are embassies nearby, and the prices in restaurants, hotels, and stores, probably are as high as you will find anywhere in Singapore. But the variety is high as well, for the same reason.
What makes this complicated is that there also are less expensive options. For example, walk away from Ion Orchard along Scotts Road, past the Marriott, to the Far East Plaza, where you will find dozens of lower-priced stores of all types. Then, take the crosswalk overpass across Scotts Road and walk into the Galleria Mall. Take the escalator, which only goes to the top floor, and find your way back down. This mall was designed so you have to walk past every store to get the next down escalator. It isn't big, but you will find some of the best luxury brands on your way back down.
Then walk back to Orchard Road and turn right. Walk past the Thai Embassy (which is under construction) to Orchard Towers. I will let you do your own search on Orchard Towers. However, I recommend not bringing your young children into the first and second floors of the Towers or you may have to explain the facts of life to them on the spot.
Take time to look around the entire Orchard Road area, which runs from around Orange Grove almost all of the way into the downtown city area. There are many more things to see along the way downtown, including more shops, massive malls (above and below ground) and museums.
Enjoy."

Even if you're not into shopping, walking around this busy street is something you should'nt miss when in Singapore."
,,Shoppers are Spoilt for Choice,4.0,,"The Orchard Road is not only a main thoroughfare but also the main shopping street in Singapore. It is dotted with malls and shops, restaurants, upscale coffee chain, cafes, tailors, dress shops and haberdasheries, barber shops, beauty salons, Spa and wellness clinics, entertainment centers, etc.

And if you just want sightseeing and wandering around, lots of street food stalls are opened at night. Don't worry about your expense wether you want to spend your money for expensive stuff or just the cheap ones, because you can find the things that you want which suitable with your pocket."
,,fifth ave in singapore,4.0,,"The first shop of note on Orchard Road was Tangs founded in 1934 and established on Orchard Road in the 1950s. Orchard Road is flanked by pedestrian malls. Orchard Road contains numerous upmarket restaurants, coffee chains, cafés, nightclubs and hotels. It is the site of the official residence and office of the President of Singapore, the Istana.Tanglin Mall is located at the junction of Tanglin Road and Grange Road. Its customer base is made up of expatriates, yuppies and professionals. Anchor tenants include Tanglin Market Place, a gourmet supermarket and bakery, and Tasty Food Court where up to 15 varieties of local cuisine can be found.
Every first Saturday night of each month, a section of Orchard Road will be closed and the road will be used as a temporary pedestrian street between Scotts Paterson Junction and Bideford Junction between 6pm -11pm from October 2014 to May 2015. Known as Pedestrian Night on Orchard Road, this six-month pilot initiative aims to inject street vibrancy into the precinct by creating an integrated community space with activities such as street tennis and mass yoga.
If you are into well known brand like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel, Cartier Orchard Road is for you. It is a long street about 2.2 km filled with shopping complexes. It’s not only the hub for shopping there are also hotels, food court, restaurants, cafes, bars and entertainment Centre During the day many companies host open-air promotions to help sell their products and services. Not far away I came across a temporary pavilion promoting health and beauty products. They did this by giving free samples, make-over’s and had some athlete exercising on a bike. The promotions change in terms of days, companies and format. They are also absolutely brilliantly done and really highlight the ingenuity, creativity and industry of Singaporeans. More than blatant sales come on, this is a real slice of Singapore culture. Come on down and stand around."
,,Ultimate shopping trip,5.0,,"There is something for everyone here. Unique one off shops, department stores and designer shops at every corner. There is multiple shopping centres here that can entertain you for hours. Places to eat and drink to unwind are everywhere so you will not be short on choice here. It's a very clean and tidy shopping experience and plenty of maps if you get lost ! Happy shopping"
,,Everything you could possibly need,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the traditional main shopping street in Sinagpore and is lined with several shopping malls as well as side streets with small, local vendors, such as the various tailors shops. It is well worth a leisurely stroll, popping into the various malls to cool off!"
,,Main shopping district,4.0,,"This is the main shopping area. Kind of overwhelming, mainly super expensive stuff you can get in America or Europe."
,,For die hard shoppers,4.0,,"when you are a shoppers; this place is a must go if you're traveling to Singapore. They sell everything in here - from no brand items for souvenirs up to all the branded items.

Basically Orchard Road is mall to mall experience. However, it can get quiet hectic and packed when it's having a great sale (there's people everywhere!)"
,,enjoyed,5.0,,lovel street to go shopping down. Multiple malls ect along the street. very clean i noticed. would shop again.
,,Christmas light-up,4.0,,The Christmas light-up is on since the last weekend. It is lit from one end at Tanglin Mall to the other end at Plaza Singapore. It is very bright and decorative during the night. The light-up will runs untilJanuary 1 next year

,,A walk down Orchard Road,4.0,,A nice wide street with a few malls and loads of shops. It is the main street of Singapore and well worth the time to go and explore. The Christmas decorations were being put up but weren't lit yet but going to look fabulous.
,,Nice place to shop,4.0,,"Good place for shopping due to a big variety of multiple brands. However, I'd prefer more to shop at Vivo City mall. You can find a few good cinemas around. Personally I don't have any favourite eatery places here. But tourists like walking along this central street of Singapore."
,,Christmas is coming to Orchard Road 2014,5.0,,"Christmas is coming again. In fact, this street is more westernized than some countries in the west. It is all here - from eating to shopping to people gazing. For the cheapest Singaporean food, go to Killiney Road and look for Comcentre, where Singtel is located. You will find Killiney Kopitiam which serves great local breakfast at a reasonable price. Just opposite Killiney Kopitiam is a staircase leading to the basement which houses a foodcourt. The prices here are incredible. You can have a plate of vegetable rice + meat for less than S$3 (the locals here call this economy rice). The queue may be super long but those guys manning the shop are super fast! Don't waste time and money at the FOOD COURT at shopping centres because most are not worth the money. Orchard Road is the place to go for branded and unbranded stuff. Some of the cafes are simply incredible."
,,I remember when.... (don't bother coming here now),2.0,,"I remember when Orchard Road used to be a really eclectic place. Wanted high-end? Wanted cheap? Wanted good value in the middle? Wanted the best shops in town? Wanted a good vibe?

Now the place is hardly eclectic. Value is hard to come by. The pleasant vibe is absent (if you are used to shopping all over the price range, and know the difference between [Orchard Road] sleepwalking formula-driven and [elsewhere] creative retailers, restaurants, clubs, etc.).

Orchard road has gone the way of Bugis street. Sanitized into a coma. Can it be rescued? Fortunately, there are options, all around Singapore and SE Asia, so that we don't have to hold our breaths while waiting.

Have been here a couple of times recently. I have ""free money"" (a couple of fairly large cash vouchers) at retailers here. Even considering it as ""free money"" I can't find anything worthwhile to blow the vouchers on. And there's nothing else to do here.

Memories of when Orchard Road used to be a vibrant place haven't faded. But will any more such memories be made now, or in the future?

Give Orchard a miss. Spend your time and money in better places. In Singapore and elsewhere."
,,X'mas decoration is up.....,4.0,,X'mas is still more than 1 month from now but the decoration is all up from street to all major shopping mall.

,,Best and Easy Travel City,5.0,,"The best time to visit Singapore will be now November to February. This is to catch the fantastic Christmas and Chinese New Year Decoration celebration especially at Orchard Road and Chinatown , being the most important festival in Singapore.
It is a pretty expensive city but if you know how to plan it can still be affordable and cheap.
These re the tips:
1. With public transport (public bus and train system) so convenience, you can stay outside the city for cheaper hotel or hostel. We even have train system from airport to city and major attractions for less than US$2 dollars.
2. Good and cheap food - try our hawker centre and you will enjoy a vast variety of Chinese, Indian, Malay and even Asian food and many others at a very affordable price of less than US$3.

These are some of the places worth exploring since you are here. All these location all have convenience train and bus going there.
Orchard Road
Singapore River
Marina Bay
Marina Bay Sand
China Town
Little India
Arab Street
Tiong Bahru Hawker centre and Redhill Hawker Centre and visit our Singapore neighbor and see how we live
Botanic Garden
Singapore Zoo and Night Safari (no train system available and quite out of the city)
Geylang - this is like King Cross and has some famous Singapore food. You need to explore and find.
Middle Road (we have a Indian and Chinese temple next to one another- this is our racial harmony which I believe you can only find in Singapore
and Bugis Junction

Have a great holiday and Welcome to Singapore"
,,A shopping mecca,5.0,,Orchard road has continually developed over the past 30 years. It is easy to get to and is filled with boutique shopping malls and hotels. There are still the old malls such as Far East Plaza (around the corner in Scotts Road) and Lucky Plaza for the traditional bargains and souvenirs.
,,If you like wasting money ...,2.0,,"Same shops, same goods and same prices, as you'd find anywhere in the world. 2 or 3 miles of it.. with a 4 lane road in-between the 2 shopping sides. Life is too short ..."
,,one stop street for dining and shopping,3.0,,"if you love, and i mean really love shopping, this is the place you must go to! all those branded shops are lined along this street. and if you get hungry, many restaurants to choose from as well. you can also just sit around and do people watching if you get (or you wallet) of shopping. :)"
,,uplifting,4.0,,"If you are working and need another place to be than all the pubs then just start walking here
the crowds the eating places the shopping centres and the lights will uplift you
sit anywhere inside outside have a drink eat and munch
but most places close by 9 and eating joints start closing from 10 toll 1 except on the weekend
but i would definitely go here again
exepensive shops but what the heck window shopping never hurt the wallet
and walking helps you tone down:)
espirit was good and helpful staff in paragon mall"

,,"Expensive shopping, decent place, yet can be skipped",4.0,,"This place is just an summarized version of shopping destination@Singapore with so many shopping malls on the same street connected to each other. The place presents a great view of Singapore economic success, and offers loads of expensive shopping avenues."
,,Chose whatever your style,4.0,,"Many shopping center offering many style,prada,tangs,takashimaya,all you can chose and buy as long the orchard road"
,,shop till you drop,5.0,,"It was interesting having a look around but I dont go in for Brand names you can see all these in any country you go to.

I enjoyed looking but didnt buy much as I can get it all at home for the same price or cheaper.

I did buy some nice bling that I couldnt get at home and the family will love for christmas."
,,Boring,3.0,,"All the names are there – Chanel, Givenchy, Prada, Lois Vuiton etc etc etc, but I can see the same lot of shops in downtown Brisbane or Sydney, or London or Paris or Rome, or even Frankfurt and Cologne. To my mind the eternal expansion worldwide has cheapened all the brands. It’s not quite the same to buy Tiffany from Brisbane as it used to be from 5th Avenue in New York. Orchard road is very boring now."
,,"shopping, shopping and wait, more shopping",3.0,,"….if raiding your bank account is your thing, then Orchard Rd is definitely for you…this is the stock standard shop til ya drop street that EVERY city has, from the catwalk name brands to the smaller chains of acclaim, i guess there is something here for everyone, almost, we high tailed it out of there quick smart!! I generally don't travel with the idea of spending money on things I don't need and that i can buy back home…there are plenty of better ways to spend your time and hard earned salary, but IF that is what you're into then this is definitely the place for you!!"

,,Shop To Drop,5.0,,"Orchard Road lives up to it reputation as Singapore's shopping mecca. Living both sides of the street are shops of every stripe, including some of the most famous high end brands. What is particularly interesting is that underground lies the tunnels that connect the subway lines and these locations are filled with countless other high end shopping venues and magnificent food courts. The benefit is that on a hot, humid day one can spend their time leisurely walking the cool, albeit crowded, underground venue."
,,Window Shopping Spree,3.0,,"If you are shopping for high-end products, this is the place to be.You just name the brands-you will get it.It has stretches of malls and shops.But if you want to get souvenirs the better place to go will be Bugis Street where the items are more affordable."
,,"""SHOPPING""",5.0,,"Take a hop on/hop off bus for $22.00sng as new can see and do other attractions in one day... Orchard Road... Loads of shops and malls from budget price to very high end retailers. As you walk along, I found the further down orchard road less people because the high end retailers seem to be more at one end... It is certainly a place that can be revisited on many occasions...no problem with eateries either....give yourself plenty of time to visit if you can. Catching a taxi is also very cheap if your staying around Robertson or Clarke Quay area to get to Orchard Road. Less than $10.00sng"

,,Shoppers' paradise,5.0,,Orchard Road is one long street filled with shopping centres catering for the rich to not-so-rich. If you love shopping then this is the place for you. A number of the centres are connected by underground 'streets' and it's easy to get lost. The best way to tackle the centres - if you have all day - is to do all on one side and then head back on the other side doing those shops and centres. There are lots of places to eat and drink to keep up the energy levels.
,,Place full of life and lights,5.0,,"I loved this place totally. first time, visited during late evening, it looked mesmerising having beautiful lights, statues around. it has many malls where u can shop. this place is always full of life. dont miss this place if u have time."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"My wife wanted to visit this famous road for all of the designer shops located along its stretch.
There is all of the top end designer shops that you expect to find.
It's a tourist haven.
I actually ended up purchasing a new digital camera and bought more clothes than my wife.
I had been told that Singapore was expensive for luxury items, but it's pretty much on par with the UK.
We enjoyed it so much we ended up going back for another few hours the following day."
,,Shopaholics take note,5.0,,Entire Street filled with shopping malls packed with all the brands you want. Prepare to empty your wallet here.

,,Must visit for shoppers!,5.0,,"I got this place as a tip from local taxi drivers. All of them suggested Orchard Road for my unending shopping queries. Be it branded or local, you can find all here. I happily bought 3 t-shirts for $10 and 3 more pairs of nightwear for $12. You can take the train or bus to this place. The underground station directly leads us to all stores and even across the road into other shopping centers. Poh heng jewellery store has amazing designs in diamond and gold jewellery.

So all shoppers, fill your wallets, carry some snacks and water and get moving around Orchard Road as long as you can!"
,,"Busy, vibrant and diverse!",4.0,,"Orchard Rd has it all! From the high end shops to your normal plazas. We found Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza a great place to eat and shop. Far East plaza has a great set of shops on ground level for eating. The Juz foodcourt next to Concorde Hotel is a must, we had beautiful chilli crab and fresh seafood at one of the stalls! At least allow a good day to explore the Orchard Rd area."
,,It's all there for dedicated shoppers,4.0,,"We were looking forward to seeing Orchard Road, having heard about this Singaporean 'street of shops'. What we found was more like a street of shopping malls, with multi-storey buildings from one end to the other, each packed from top to bottom with outlets selling everything from clothes to electronics. Lots of designer branded shops, as well as independent retailers. Many of the buildings were really impressive inside, but what was a bit disappointing was that so many of these concentrations of retail therapy seemed much the same. There wasn't any real character to Orchard Road as we'd hoped to find; just one buying opportunity after another. And because Singapore's a pretty prosperous place these days, prices weren't anything special. There were lots of restaurants in every building we entered, so you can shop and eat to your heart's content if that's what you're really after. It's a great place for dedicated shoppers and of course much bigger than similar places in the Sydney or Melbourne CBD. However, for the real fun of shopping we preferred the markets in Chinatown and Little India. Not so big or fancy but a lot more entertaining."

,,Glitz personified,5.0,,"Orchard Rd , especially in the run up to Christmas is about as glitzy as you can get . Its a shopaholics wet dream. Every fashion name under the sun is represented there en masse . It makes Upper Sloane St. look cheap.

,,Lovely place to shop,5.0,,"One of best place to shop in Singapore. Huge ranges of shopping choices from normal to high end. Concept is slightly similar to Oxford street in London apart from the fact Orchard road has got more restaurant and offices built in. Shops are very nice and trust me the more you look at those, the more you want to spend. One very blatant fact about Orchard road: tho there are many people daily, it is always clean. Last but not least, on Sat and Sun it could not be as a shopping area as usual cos there are many group of people eating, drinking or chatting out loud outside the malls. They are fun and lovely."
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the shopping area in Singapore, crammed with huge designer malls with every label and brand imaginable. Inside the malls are also excellent food courts and restaurant where you can find great food from all over Asia. The food is very well priced compared to its European equivalent, but the prices in the designer shops are on par if not slightly dearer.

There are the very high class malls that are vast and spacious, down to almost the flea market versions, bottom line is that you will be spoilt for choice in how to spend your cash. it's worth going just to take a look at the sheer volume of malls and shops on show and then grab some food."
,,Had so much fun,5.0,,Staying at one of the hotel's in Orchard Road amazed me so much coz they have the great shopping center although the shops are almost all the same. When we went there they are still on sale but i did not find their price really what one expects during sale season. I love shopping that's why i loved Singapore.
,,Make sure you have Lots of Cash!!!,4.0,,"Its one of the well known shopping streets in South Asia. It has many malls with high end brand shops. The usual Armani, Prada, Boss, Versace are all there. All shops are very well designed and makes you wanna spend. Prices are little on the higher side so unless you have lots of money to spare, I wouldn't venture there. Lot of good restaurants there too. I will not mention names as there are too many."
,,Singapore's magnificent mile,4.0,,"This is the 1st and still the best place for shopping in Singapore. Similar to the shopping streets in hongkong, New York and other major cities, the aim is to awe and saturate the senses

Most of the malls are very similar, let me attempt to pick some highlights of each:
1. Orchard Ion - this is the newer and larger of all the malls. It has 2 nice art galleries where you can purchase murakami and Damien hirst lithographs
2. Ngee ann city, which is like an older Ion. It has the kinokuniya bookstore, probably the largest and best bookstore in the country
3. Paragon , which is like a smaller Ion. It has 2 of the best Chinese restaurants in town, both facing each other on the same floor. imperial Treasure and Crystal jade
4. Orchard gateway, the newest kid on the block, with the Underarmor store

There are many other malls, which will take you an entire day, and more"
,,One of the Great Shopping Streets in the World,5.0,,"Every traveller should spend at least a day wandering Orchard Rd to admire the shops and food outlets in this amazing road. The atmosphere hasn't changed much in over 35 years, just the names on the shops and the quantity has increased dramatically. there are plenty of excellent food outlets to keep one's energy intake up for the journey."
,,"Celebrity or not, this is a must-visit.",5.0,,"MRT station Orchard road to Dhobi Ghaut, check them all out. I got out at Orchard Road and made my way along the subway to many a interconnecting Mall. Later, as I got out in the street, I was mesmerized with the view of a neat, clean, striking shopping district. If you have the money please spend it here. The Ion looks great from outside."
,,Trendy Shopping,5.0,,"When you are visiting Singapore, you must visit Orchard road. This is the whole stretch of shops all in one line with all kinds of branded shops from economical to luxury so one can have a very wide range in one spot. However, it is most crowded in the evenings and weekends so best time to go is in the mornings."
,,FANCY LANE!!,4.0,,"Visited Orchard Road in August with my partnar, this wasnt our first time so we had an idea of what was there and where things were.

Great road for shopping has everything you could think of!
Personally despite the beautiful and endless stores this road has to offer, I find it to be more on the high end scale, filled with luxury boutiques such as chanel, burberry, louis vuttion, rolex etc..
So if your shopping budjet is a bit tight this road is probably not for you. I recommend you research the stores that are there if your looking for anything specific.
Having said dont be alarm there is still an abundance of stores that would suit the ""non high rollers"" lol ranging from:
•zara
•h&m
•forever21
•sephora
•nike/ adidas
•hoops factory (which I highly reccomend for all basketball lovers)

Our favourite place would definitely be Lucky Plaza! Great place for inexpensive goods. The stores are mainly influenced and populated by Filipinos (which made me feel right at home ☺)
My partnar and I literally went there everyday just so we could eat filopino food. Also we were so suprised and delighted when we discovered a Jollibee (filopino version of mac donalds) which is a new edition to the plaza. (Note* they have 2 one at the top and bottom level food court)

If shopping isnt really your cup of tea,I still recommend having a stroll and wonder down this road as it has many things to offer and see.

helpful tips:
•Fill up your wallets/purses! $$
•visit Lucky Plaza!
•set aside at least half a day or even a whole day for ur visit (for those shopaholics!) xp

Hope this helps :) xx"
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"Good locaton for shopping, from Tanglin to Plaza Singapore. Everybuilding has its unique theme. Inside and outside, both give a different feel."
,,Main Street,4.0,,It is the main street in Singapore where all the major stores and malls are located. A lot of the netter restaurants and hotels are on Orchard Street.
,,Paradise for Shopaholics,3.0,,"malls - fashion store - convenient store - food truck - malls - fashion store coffee shop - malls - food booth

that's all i see at Orchard Road
shopaholics can call it ""paradise""
but if you are not fond of shopping, the view is quite good to take a photo (just like me who loves to take photo than shopping :P)
many Indonesian people often come here to shop. they think the price is cheaper than you buy it in Indonesia"
,,Stay away during the weekends,4.0,,"But other than that, COME and enjoy shopping! I'm the claustrophobic type of person and the CROWDS really do get to me during weekends. That being said, this coming from a semi-local (lived here for 2 years+). All high end designer boutiques have opened up shops mostly in all the most prominent corners of this stretch of road.Anything AND everything then some, it's all there.Just make sure to shop around.
Tips:

For electronic goods,camera/lenses- try going to Far East Shopping Center rather than say, Lucky Plaza.ALL tourists go there that's why the prices are ridiculous.

Try to go to Singapore Expo when it's The GREAT SINGAPORE SALE.I assure you that's the best priced bargain deals are for mostly everything.(Happens every June)

For ladies that are handbag afficionados, Try DFS On Scotts Road (it's close to Orchard Road too) OR keep an eye out for road shows that sell authentic Kate Spade,Coach, Tory BUrch and some higher end ticket items like Prada,Gucci,Burberry etc.I got handed a flyer that says handbag sales in such and such hotel (all in Orchard Road) whilst walking to the train station. Don't just throw all the leaflets being handed there as some can be really worth your while.
Singapore does not allow fakes so I'm sure you will get the real deal.

The one thing I'm not fond of shopping for is toys for the little ones while in Singapore. US prices (and nearby Asian countries) are cheaper and have more choices.This is based on Toys R Us prices.

all in all I love shopping and hunting for bargains in this expensive city-state.happy hunting!"
,,"Great mix of shops, a must for shopaholics",5.0,,"Great mix of high end luxury to affordable souvenirs . Loved the Abercrombie store and it had a sale on. Worth going to the same store brand in different malls, ie Ion and Paragon ,as some have sales on that the other one didn't. Think it's to do with their placement area in the malls if in a quieter spot. Loads of food options . Shops don t open to at least 10am, some even 10.30am, but some Lucky plaza shops where opened as early as 9am when I arrived. Going in to the under paths to cross the road can end up taking you into a labyrinth of more shops from an enjoying mall which even for a shopaholic like me was kinda confusing. Found some decent shoes in Far East plaza, but it can be a diamond in the rough, just need to look everywhere and keep your eyes opened for a bargain.All in all a shoppers paradise."
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,"If you love shopping, you cannot miss this street. There are a lot of stores and shopping malls, prices are as in the rest of the world. You cannot bargain."
,,Hectic Shopping Street,4.0,,"This street has many shopping malls, from extremely expensive, to cheap looking electronics shops. We've seen like 3 Louis Vuitton shops pretty much next to each other. ;)

You can find everything you want in here, it is also a nice stroll for people watching. Very good connection on the metro. Not a prime destination for sightseeing if you have short time in Singapore, but worth a visit otherwise."
,,Shops VS Dollars!!,4.0,,"Armani, Hermes, Prada, D&G name whatever brand you might think of, Orchard road has it!! Starting from Orchard MRT station to Dhoby Ghaut, Orchard road is a shoppaholic's haven. Just don't go there by Sunday"
,,Shopping,4.0,,By far the busiest place in Singapore for shopping. Great if you want to burn some dollars or just strolling around. The Kinokuniya bookstore here is large and worth a visit.
,,"Orchard Road, Singapore-Great Shopping",5.0,,"I am a local, and Orchard is my favourite shopping place. Be it shoes, bags, clothes, toys, accessories, electronic gadgets, etc, this is the place I go to. It is a place for all. There are expensive labels, mid pricing and relatively low pricing outlets housed at different buildings in the whole stretch of Orchard/Scotts shopping district. Across a span of 3 MRT stations, there could be multiple Mango outlets, Handphone shops etc, where I can hop into ALL in a day just to find the correct colour of a Mango blouse or handphone if it is not available in every shop. There is a wide range of food ranging from food courts to restaurants everywhere with a wide variety of international cuisines. Clean toilets can be found everywhere. It is an ideal place to meet up with frens as it is centrally located in Singapore."
,,shopping,5.0,,"Well worth walking both sides of Orchard Rd and also entering some shops to just look. We found Lucky Plaza, Centrepoint Plaza more affordable than some others."
,,Shopping Paradise!,4.0,,"My friends and I go to Orchard almost everyday on our 5-day stay in Singapore. From low-cost to high-end shops, you'll find almost everything here! Love it!"
,,Wow Wow and Wow,5.0,,"If you love shopping you will love orchard road. It has everything from low cost budget shops to the top end Dior, Chanel, Cartier. An amazing place. Even if not to shop its great to walk. We started at the top by Hard Rock and walked all the way to the bottom of Orchid Road and then carried on walking where eventually we came to Raffles Hotel where we stopped for a well deserved Singapore Sling. If you carry on walking from Raffles you will come to Marina Bay and the Merlion. From here we caught a water taxi back to our hotel at Clarke Quay.

Great wall and lots to see xxx"
,,Shopping Paradise!,4.0,,"There are plenty of restaurants with different cuisines to choose from , also, many big famous shopping malls in this district. Moreover, there area many decent hotels located here. I would say it is the best area for tourists to stay at! As for people who love retail therapy, one entire day is not enough! You got to spend much more time here to enjoy Orchard Road!"
,,Keeps discovering more!,4.0,,"On my 2nd visit to Singapore in 2 years, I keep discovering more places there! The Orchard Road is one of the most happening place in Singapore after Clarkes Quay. Plenty of shopping, great restaurants, enough and more road side eateries and lots more. Most of the international brands are here. There are quite a few dance pubs as well! Be careful of who you hang out with at these pubs! But seems to be a very safe place even at 1 AM."
,,Fantastic orchard,4.0,,If u r looking for shopping & desserts this is the place. Hotels are also good. Robinsons & takashimaya are my favorite especially if there is a sale....
,,Can't miss this place,4.0,,"You will find more than 20 shopping mall in this area and quantity of restaurants. It's a must in Singapore. My favorite mall: ION (basement) and Somerset. At the beginning of the evening you will be surprised by many birds near Wisma, Paragon....scary but no danger. In all mall you will find clean toilet, it's a must compare to mall in other countries"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,"I really enjoyed walking/shopping down Orchard Road! Everything is there! Even if you aren't a big shopper, I still think the atmosphere of the strip is awesome."
,,Why would anyone come here to shop?,2.0,,"Let's see... crowded, hot, expensive, rude sales people... why? I can't imagine why people would come here to shop. There are no bargains here and no attractions other than overpriced goods."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"Air-conditioned malls line this street, and are always filled with Singaporeans for whom shopping can often be a preferred activity. The malls themselves give the shopping experience a whole new meaning, and contain eating places, supermarkets, luxury brand names, etc.."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"On your way back from Europe via Singapore and just looking for a bit of sun and swimming.
Well Orchard road is the exact opposite.
There are heaps of high end shops and everything you wish to purchase is here.
From camera's to Gucci. Prams to Prada.
Heaps of restaurants and eatery's."
,,Mind boggling,5.0,,"Take your time,use a whole day and be prepared for anything!! If you can't get it in Singapore, you'll never find it. Enjoy the smells and sights of orchard road and be prepared to bargin, and go with a shopping list in mind. Also use public Transport to get around and save costs."
,,Nothing particularly unexpected or unique: Lots of shops & restaurants,3.0,,"We weren’t impressed by the shopping district. Just hustle and bustle of a big city. There was a lot of traffic and if you don’t know where you want to go, it is a hit-or-miss shopping experience."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,When on orchard road you just need money. A shopping paradise for everyone. All the leading brands are here huge malls worth seeing.
,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping",4.0,,"Not only there's shopping, but there's heaps of food too! Endless supply of shops. Food is also ridiculously abundant. It wasn't a question of what u want to eat, but more or how much can u eat!"
,,Megashopping without the need for dropping,4.0,,"Yes, you can indeed shop till you drop in the wide collection of supersmart shopping malls that Orchard Road offers, but there are alternatives: go more than once, taking it in bit by bit, or go with a single mission, heading for the purchase of that elusive CD in the impressive HMV collection, for example. Once that is accomplished, seek nourishment from one of the excellent value for money foodcourts in the malls, and replan: Do I want to continue? Or perhaps use your Singaporean connections to identify reputable self-owned exchanges to exchange currency from one of several available in corners of the malls, and at much better rates than the larger operators. You won't be bored in Orchard Road."
,,Yawn,2.0,,We read this was the place to visit in Singapore so headed there on our first day. But really it is just full of plastic chain shops with no character. You could be in any capital city in the world. The market streets in Chinatown have way more character and charm!
,,"orchard rd, singapore",4.0,,Orchard rd is busy everyday and is fully decorated during christmas period starting in november every year. The lightings with neon lights are beautiful at night
,,So in Love with Orchard Road!,5.0,,"Orchar road is like ""wow"" ! Coz it combines classy and relaxed modes! You can find nice stuff there, not very cheap but it would be a nice shopping experience.
A coffe in the afternoon is perfect to watch people hanging out and enjoying the place.
Orchard Rd is very clean, safe and nice... So walk it till you're really really tired.
Bon voyage!"
,,Shopping!!,5.0,,"Every girl loves shopoing! The ION mall's basement have nice stories with a reasonable prices, I liked most store called ""factorie"""
,,Just a big road for shopping,3.0,,"Was not so impressed by the road which is very long.. Better take a bus! The only things to see are the Orchad Central but nothing to see there besides shopping. Even the rooftop isn't great. Btw, nice architecture!"
,,Shop n Walk,4.0,,"This road is for shopaholics, food lovers, massage lovers - I remembered to pass lots of brand stores, shopping centers and definitely rush of people. Was in a business training down the road and enjoyed food several time in lunch or after hours. Good place to move around - as solo or family."
,,One of the best shopping shop,4.0,,"Orchard road is the best way to shop,this a many famous brand from lot designer at here,and many shop for easying life from convienence store until famous brand store near from mrt stations and easy grab for cab,easy for take your food or drink even good way for take your snack at here"
,,Good deals,4.0,,Look for shops along the road and not inside the malls. Much cheaper buys. Crossing the road is difficult and the underpass is hidden. Looks amazing during the Christmas season. Not to be missed if you want some December holiday photos.
,,Heaven for Shopholics,4.0,,"If you love shopping, this road is the Must place to go. During the street, there are many shopping plazas which are diversified of price and brand names. You may be confused because you do not know want to start from where. My hint is that you should go window shopping first and then decide later, you can find qualified products with good price in this road."
,,One of the top shopping streets in the world,5.0,,Orchard Road can rival anywhere in the world for shopping options and experiences. Shops stretch all the way along on both sides and even underneath the road. There is a range of shops from designer to 'high street' brands and it is also a good place to grab coffee or food.
,,Amazing Place,5.0,,Orchard Road is a must visit. It is an entertainment hub of Singapore with one of the most popular shopping area. You will find everything here if you don't find it anywhere else in singapore in addition to it is also a beautiful place to rome around for a few hours. It is also easily accessible with taxis.
,,prepared adventuring with sore feet but really fun,5.0,,"when I was in the territory of orchard road, I split way with the women, they spend time for shopping, and we look see and feel the joy of ice 1 singapore dollar.

in this place we spend our time almost half a day. according to the women, this site is a shopping paradise. =D"
,,Shopping street - as many others worldwide - but SG is unique,4.0,,"You arrive in Orchard rd and you are bombing buy one shopping mall after the other, if you are not used to Asian shopping experience you get confused in a second, especially about how to cross the road passing by under-passages between one shopping mall and the other.
U can find everything here, from Hermes and Prada to H&M and Cotton On. Say one brand? Probably you find a 3 floor flagship on this road.
Be here during GSS (Grand Sales Singapore) july and december will put yourself in a great proof of self control, big discounts everywhere impossible to keep you money save in the wallet.
Raffle City, Takashimaya, ION, Lucky Plaza, Shawn Centre. It only matter to choose one.
You can spend all day long shopping eating coffee shopping coffe aperitive dinner.
Outside you are on a large boulevard covered by huge tree wt a lot of noisy birds (especially in evening) giving you a nice fresh touch."
,,I like shopping but loved it here,5.0,,Visited last August with a friend. We headed for the high end first and spent a fortune - I had to buy another suitcase on Orchard Road to put it all in. I had never been in Tangs before I liked it and prefer departments stores anyway but wanted to see this as it was credited with basically creating Orchard Road as a shopping district. We had a great time and stopped off at eateries along the way as we were there all day - bad I know but a great time. They have everything here.
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"The place to be for shoppers. All brands and street-full of shops. Even if you don't buy much, the shops will dazzle you. Bargains can be found. Come December and be treated to Christmas in Spore."
,,"Like Madison Avenue, but more intense",4.0,,"I'm not a shopper, but I'm blown away by the zillions of shops, from very high end to medium low, all along Orchard. Three Coach stores (that I saw...there were probably more) for example.
For me, the large buildings and long tunnels that have all of these stores allows me to walk in AC comfort. I love that part!"
,,"I found it average, but shopaholics will froth over it",3.0,,"Yeah, first time back on Orchard Rd in 10 years and not much has changed. Mega malls, mostly packed full of exactly the same brands and shops that you see everywhere in the world and all selling at very solid prices. It was underwhelming.

However, shopaholics will totally love it - hour of big name brand hunting galore. It's got a reasonable vibe to it and is very walkable.

It's certainly worth a wander, even if you're not much of a shopper, and is worth to see. I ended up with a couple of t-shirts so it wasn't a complete loss of time for me - others will do much better!"
,,Shop 'til you drop,3.0,,"Perfect place for shopaholics, especially those who are into high-end brands. But there are malls for the budget shoppers too. I suggest wearing good walking shoes if you plan to spend time (and of course, money) here."
,,Overrated Shopping,3.0,,"The shopping is certainly extensive, centres every where along the road, but I found it expensive and nothing much different to home. I bought a pair of running shoes at a pop up shop that I love and they were cheap, nothing else."
,,Great shopping experience,4.0,,"One of the most amazing streets ever, it goes on for miles, has such a great buzz, beautiful people and mid blowing shops. There is probably just everything you can find in one street. Loads of amazing places to eat and drink, including a snack at ""Garrett's popcorn"", probably the worlds best tasting popcorn ever. Love Singapore and can't wait to get back to Orchard Road!"
,,Shopping Heaven!,5.0,,"Singapore's Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise! Whether you're looking for bargains, chain stores, electronics or high end luxury brands, you will leave satisfied.

Starting from Plaza Singapura (the end closest to the CBD), full of chain retail stores you can stroll down, toward the Tanglin end where stores and malls get more and more exclusive. Paragon, Ion Orchard and Ngee Ann City are home to numerous fashion houses and high end goods. The OG, Takshimaya and TANGS are large full scale department stores, the latter two reminding us of department stores of yesteryear. There are several branches of the same stores along the road, so you are unlikely to miss out if shopping for your favourite brands.

If you want your nails done, or your phone repaired - try Far East Plaza off Orchard on Scott's Road.

All the major cinema houses have a theatre on orchard road.

Travel between Dhoby Ghaut - Somerset - Orchard is a great way to get down the road if you don't like walking!

TIP: If it starts raining, keep out of the underground section of Wisma Atria between Takashimaya and Ion Orchard. It can be very crowded. Taxis will be hard to get. Find somewhere to have a coffee or something to eat until it passes!"
,,Busy but facinating,3.0,,Good if you like shopping as there were lots and lots of malls. Had a good ice cream at Swensons. I didnt like the fact that a lot of the shops were present in several malls like M & S
,,Excellent Shopping Street !!!,5.0,,"We have been here every weekend intern of time staying in Singapore. Normally, We took a MRT from our house ( green line), there many way to reach here, but traveling by MRT is most convenient and fastest in Singapore. No need to wait so long and people very helpful always make concession to enter train ( standing behind yellow line, people come out first). Nowadays, everybody can reach there by Circle line ( yellow line) from many station in Singapore.
We intend do window shopping but when getting there you can't stand to save your money. Big sale, big promotion. Recommend for lady purchasing at Saphora Comestic with plenty of goods and product."
,,Nice atmosphere!,5.0,,"Definitely orchard road is a nice atmosphere for either shopping or people watching. There is always things going on, and shops to suit any budget if you have a good look :) Easily accessible by Orchard or Somerset station."
,,Shopping exprerience,5.0,,Orchard Rd is a big avenue with lots independent fashion designers boutiques and most famous luxury brands. Cool spot to go shopping!
,,Shopping!,5.0,,The best place and heaven for shopaholics! Just take MRT to reach here and enjoy every mall in this street. Crowded yet you will enjoy if your aim is shopping!
,,An Experience,5.0,,"We visit Orchard Road multiple times during every visit to Singapore, mostly because my parents live right off of it, so to get to the MRT station, we have to walk through Ion Orchard. Orchard Road is lovely - it's the Fifth Avenue of Singapore, yet coming from a New Yorker, Orchard is much more pleasant!

It's the main shopping hub of Singapore, and it does not disappoint. When people speak of modern, futuristic Singapore, I believe this is what they're referring to. The buildings are pretty much all brand-new and shiny, with high-end flagships lining each side of the street - Dior, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Tod's, Hermes, Rolex, to name a few. The displays are beautiful and eye-catching. There are other stores too - movie theaters, electronics stores, supermarkets, department stores (Takashimaya), gyms, restaurants. Orchard Road literally has everything you could want, at all different price points, although the majority of stores are extremely high-end and mostly window-shopping only, for most people. That said, if I needed plates, t-shirts, even a hair straightener - those can all be found at stores dotting the road, and at great prices.

You can also connect to both sides of the street underground through the MRT as well as various underpasses, and basically wander through a whole string of malls without even going outside into the heat - which is awesome, and slightly scary at the same time! Ion Orchard is my particular favorite - every store you can imagine, plus a great food court, in a modern space that doesn't feel like a mall at all.

There are people there all day every day, and it's wonderful to sit and eat an ice cream from a local vendor and just people-watch. On weekends the nannies and maids come and sit outside for hours, hanging out, tourists are taking photos, and then you have the locals going about their business. They decorate beautifully for the holidays. Yes, there are a lot of people, but welcome to Singapore - it's a city!

It almost goes without saying that like everywhere else in Singapore, the road/shops/mall/everything are amazingly clean.

For me, a trip to Singapore would never be complete without at least one stroll on Orchard Road!"
,,"Orchard Road, a shopping paradise",4.0,,"If we hear the Orchard Road shopping mall imagined a fairly large, when visiting Singapore in January 2014 we also made time to visit Orchard Road, the place is very easy to reach, just take the MRT stop at Orchard then when we came out of the MRT and go up using the escalator will direct leads us to the ION Orchard shopping center, from where it connects directly through the underpass towards Tang's Plaza and Lucky Plaza are adjacent, so for those who have a hobby shop then this area is perfect."
,,shopping heaven,5.0,,"I went to this place twice, at night the street was light up and it was beautiful. If you like shopping, this is a must for you, i went to Lucky plaza everything here was so cheap, onething you must do is go around and find the cheapest one, first time i entered the shop i paid 10$ for 3 shirts, and then i walked pass some blocks and i saw 10$ for 4 shirts, they were exactly the same shirts i bought and i kept walking i saw 10$ for 5. Shirts i was like shiet i should not have bought my shirts at that shop"
,,Singapore's shopping hub.,3.0,,"If you are the kind of traveller who loves shopping, Orchard got you covered. This whole ""stretch of shops"" is probably the most famous attraction in Singapore. Here, everything is everywhere, and you can find large department stores, hotels, restaurants and famous brands everywhere, literally, even within hotels. Everything is practically connected to each other, and it may seem very simple to get from point A to point B, however it's not that simple when theres a huge crowd attempting to do the same thing as you. To save time, avoid any underpass and try to get from one place to another overground and outside, as there is much more space to walk through. If you are the kind of traveller who likes peace and quiet, and less shopping, Marina Bay is a better choice for you (where all the business hotels are)."
,,Consumerism at its Finest,4.0,,"All the lined 5 star hotels and elegant malls you can imagine. A nice strolling experience. Come over during the Great Singapore Sale and you might just nab a good find or two in its hundreds, possibly thousands of stores and shops. Ion Orchard foodcourt is a bit pricey but has a good selection."
,,1st year in Singapore Christmas @ Orchard,5.0,,"The road's are decorated so well, the glitter and mad rush of people... never seen so may people together in Singapore before this day. Loads of offers around to shop we did get our share of the loot ... would recommend people to visit during Christmas time."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,This has got to be the best shopping road on the planet. You name it and you can get it here. Very safe environment there due to police zero tolerance there so as a tourist you could not feel safer.
,,Shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"The place to be for upmarket shopping. Lots of shops, small ones, big ones, expensive ones. Also the place where the Singapore president lives. Easy to get to by rapid transport.."
,,Shop eat and drink,4.0,,"Complete road dedicated to shopping. Lot of brands and non brands to choose from. If you could avoid crowds on weekends, it is a great place to just walk along the footpath.Most of the things here are fixed price, no need to spend your energy and time bargaining."
,,"You can find anything here, except a bargain",5.0,,"You have most likely heard that Singapore can be an expensive place to live. It should come as no surprise then that its renowned shopping area along Orchard Road is full of high-end stores and not many ""bargains."" However, there is probably no designer or item you cannot find somewhere along this road...at a premium price of course. However, if you are a serious buyer strolling along Orchard, you probably can afford it anyway. Louis Vuitton, Prada, Fendi, etc. are all here. Oddly there is no official Apple retail store, but there are authorized resellers for Apple products. Overall, the shopping experience can't be beat for selection; it's quite impressive. People-watching opportunities abound as well."
,,Shopping Haven !,5.0,,"Orchard Road is convenient to access, if you take the MRT and stop at Orchard station. Very clean and lots of beautiful big shopping malls. Shopping is a haven with latest season on sale. Good for finding lots of delicious food too."
,,Most famous place in Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard road is the most famous place in Singapore for already long time.
And there are a lot of famous shopping centers along the road.
Many tourists and people of Singapore visit pn holiday for shopping.
When I also stayed in Singapore, I visited with my family every week.
Especially during Chrismas season, the road is illuminated by many beautiful lighting illuminations, it is just like Disney land night carnival.
So I wold like to recommend you to go to the Orchard road during Christmas season."
,,Love Shopping - Should not miss it....,4.0,,"Worth a visit for sure.You name the brand, it is located here, you want something, you will find it here. no limits/ cost barrier of the items you want to purchase. you will find some of the costliest items in this market at least a glimpse of which you would surely like to take because may be you would never see it again in your life. shopping lovers do not forget to fill your pockets full with money and credit/debit cards."
,,Singapore is just expensive,4.0,,"Worth a visit for sure, there is just mall after mall and shop after shop. You name the brand, it is located here, you want something, you will find it here. This is a full days visit, maybe more to get around everything. You will never want to see another shop once you spend a day here. Book a spa when done."
,,My favourite place,5.0,,"One doesn't come here for peace and quiet. This is the hip and happening orchard road, bursting with activity. People, shopping and world class dining. If you visit Singapore I recommend you stay here. I have stayed In hotels on this road every time I visited Singapore. New year is a special time for orchard road, everything is lit up and the whole place is like a huge Christmas tree."
,,Shopped until we dropped,5.0,,Thank goodness we went when the sales were on was an addictive experience the shopping malls were set out so nicely made it way to easy to max the credit cards out - lovely air con as well :)
,,Have fun shopping!,4.0,,"This is a one crazy place for shopping lovers! There are shops after shops from one end to the end. You can easily spend a whole day walking around either window shopping or buying what you find. There are quite a few large shopping centres and each one of them have a uniqueness to them. If you get off at MRT Orchard station, you will be able to access to Ion, Takashimaya and Isetan which are all great to strut around. They are not probably the cheapest but all the big brands are there. If you get hungry, go to the underground levels and you will find so many choice of food there too.

The street stretches from Dobhy Ghaut where Plaza Singapura is through Sommerset to Orchard station on MRT. You will probably need more time than you would firstly think as that's what happened to me. There are literally countless number of shops and eating places and easily time will go pass by. Get a refreshing fruit juice or bubble tea to walk around and you will have the great time if you love shopping!"
,,Shoppers delight,4.0,,"Literally dozens of shopping malls lining both sides of a busy boulevarde. From exclusive brands in many centres like Takashamaya to bargain basement shopping in Lucky Plaza, a visitor to Singapore need hardly go anywhere else to buy a genuine (or fake)Rolex, find a good tailor, have a massage, change money and eat cheaply."
,,Interesting even for a non shopper,4.0,,"I'm not really 'big' on shopping, but I enjoyed Orchard Road as it was great for people watching and dining as well. Absolutely frantically busy when we were there but we still found a quiet spot to watch the world go by."
,,"""shop till you drop""",5.0,,it is still amazing after so many years that Orchard has been the main shopping areas where you can spend the whole day exploring.
,,It's a shopping street in a global city,3.0,,"Not the most inspiring part of Singapore. You could be anywhere really. Many brands, many big malls, many ways to have retail therapy. If you want to see real Singapore do the quays, the parks, the view from Marina Bay and, yes, Raffles."
,,Biggest shopping center at small country,5.0,,"Must go here for shopping, it make you forget about the timing. Because it takes a few hours to walking and go around this shopping complex. Nice place for shopaholic."
,,Good mix of shops,3.0,,"I was there on a week day evening, and the streets were not very crowded. There is a good mix of big brands in this unique looking building called Ion. Was also directed to a mall with smaller ""street stall"" style shops. In terms of pricing of goods: some brands are definitely much more expensive than I would usually pay for in malls like Macy's. This is especially true for the US brands.

It was a unique experience overall. I am particularly impressed by how many of these malls are linked underground via tunnels that is equipped with air conditioners!"
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is madness! Shopping malls sit next to shopping malls, which sit next to yet more shopping malls! It's a bit overwhelming, and not for the faint-hearted! But a shop-a-holic's dream!

It's a long stretch of road, so a game plan is a good idea. Do some research before you go so you have an idea of which malls have the shops you are looking for.

There is a real mix of malls with normal High Street brands and high end couture. 313 and Ion Orchard and two great malls for your average budgeted shopper, with many of the brands you'd find in the UK.

As an Aussie, prices for the High Street stuff are much the same as what we'd pay at home - but the range and choice is what makes this worthwhile. I found places like H&M to be good value for money (as always) but others, like Dorothy Perkins were good to go in and try stuff on, then head back to your hotel and order online. It was often cheaper for me to do this and have it shipped to Australia from the UK than buy it in Singapore.

If you want to eating keep costs low, I recommend heading to the basement of many of the shopping centres for casual dining, a wide variety of take always and supermarkets."
,,Easy to Find Halal Restaurants,4.0,,"I bumped to halal franchise restaurants such as McDonalds, Old Town White Coffee. Not a problem for Muslim tourists who want to have familiar kind of food."
,,Brings lots of money,3.0,,"My hotel was in the heart of Orchard Rd so of course we had to go window shopping while we were here. We compared prices to US prices and things were marked way up, even higher than their normal luxury prices. If money is no object, this is the place for you."
,,Shopping Shopping,5.0,,A road which full with luxury shopping centers. You could find luxury brands and items on just one road.
,,Ideal shopping centre,4.0,,plenty of shopping malls in this road. can find every luxury goods here. But it is more suitable for wealthy people.
,,Plenty of shops but expensive,3.0,,"Orchard road appears endless at times and overwhelming with the number of shops on offer. If you are shopping for luxury brands and high end items there is plenty on offer however for someone on a mid range type of budget, I found there was not heaps on offer. I would recommend going to the Paragon Shopping Centre (they also have a good basement food court) and 301 (or 303?) shopping centre."
,,Shop Till You Drop (Literally),5.0,,"Fantastic shopping with large department stores at most corners. Easy way to shop in the heat as some malls have malls between them. Hard to find a bargain, but the choice is endless."
,,Nice view to shopping area,4.0,,"This area have alots of branded retailer in all the shopping mall. The best place to shop are Takashimaya, Somerset 313 and Central Point. Because those are the most people who like to went there.
I like 313 Somerset is because of the building view with alots of glasses that make up of natural daylighting during day time.

At night, have a beautiful area if you go 313 Somerset at the top level."
,,"Big shops, big luxury, big street, big pain",3.0,,"More shops than one can imagine, more high end shops in one place than one can take in. The street big, wide, full of traffic, people, very bustling. Convenient to get to by public transport. Say it is a pain because so big, spread out, not easy to navigate where to go, find what you are looking for."
,,Not just for shopping,5.0,,"It's also a great place to stroll aling, relax and enjoy the culture of Singapore. Nice places with great architecture could be seen from your walk along Orchard road and very accessible with it's own train station. It is best enjoyed at night where the LED lights come on and buildings and stairways are lit up with changing colors. A must visit area in Singapore!"
,,Not really that great a place.....for men,3.0,,"I walked all around this Orchard road and went into numerous shop and centres and none of them cater for the man who's doing the shopping with the missus and doesn't want to be there, no seat for men to wait patently why their other halves take minutes to try on everything they can every one hundred metres, no comfy leaning spots to just stare into the distance, no electronic gadget shops, no real men shops apart from clothing lines. I don't reckon I'll bother shopping there again."
,,Shops Galore,3.0,,"Just another shopping strip, full of designer stores, no different from what you can purchase in the other department stores around Singapore."
,,shopping disctrict,4.0,,++ best shopping district in South East Asia ++ underground way connecting every malls with MRT -- super crowded
,,A Shoppers Paradise.....Fabulous!!,5.0,,If you are in Singapore and have just a couple of days between meetings and some personal time - just hop into a cab and come to Orchard Road! There are so many malls to choose from all in this one long road. You will find all Luxury Branded items to local brands you name it they have it. The shops are big and spacious unlike in other cities. There are many eateries and cafés and also food-court where you get mouth watering local food. Plus the local Singaporeans are very friendly - even the cab drivers will give you suggestions on where to go. Basically a trip to Orchard Road is a must for all tourists visiting Singapore besides all the sightseeing spots!!
,,awesome shopping street,5.0,,"if you are in singapore and not visited orchid road you have missed a lot..
such big is this area that you need atleast a week time to explore all the malls.. it has all the brands from top ends to lower ones with each brand having multiple stores and all of them were having such nice offers..
very nice shopping hub.."
,,Crowded,3.0,,"I came here on Saturday evening... may be that's why its so crowded with many people. We can find almost all branded store here. From clothes, electronics and another fashion items are available here. Just name it and prepare the money..^_^. After strolling the area we go to food court in Lucky Plaza with many choices of food and drink."
,,Paradise for shopping,4.0,,"Fantastic possibility to shop everything from luxury goods from all brand marks to more moderate items. Though, a little bit too much for me with all these goods wherever you turn."
,,Big beautiful shopping centres,4.0,,"It's amazing how many Gucci shops can there be on one particular street, as the number of fashion stores is quite dazzling. As a not that huge of a shopper, I personally feel like it's a bit of a one trick pony though. Apart from the huge and beautifully made shopping malls, of which there are plenty, there isn't really that much else to see or do. Still, it's a nice walk along the road, and if you're loaded with cash you can really go on a shopping frenzy here."
,,Just Looking,4.0,,"Well this shopping area has very expensive and exclusive shops.
Also there are Plazas like the Lucky Plaza that also has a variety of cheaper shops. A lot of eating areas, outside and inside cheap and expensive. An interesting road to have a wander up and down even if you are not spending."
,,Good to see,4.0,,"Orchard Road has every designer shop you can think of, but don't expect any bargains or bartering in them, because it doesn't happen. It's an experience, but unless you have limitless cash, one visit is plenty."
,,Super Expensive,3.0,,"Orchard Road is fantastic to see, however the only thing worth buying in Singapore would be anything digital as everything else is horribly expensive"
,,Christmas lights!!,5.0,,"We were in Singapore on the run up to Christmas 2013 and often went along Orchard Road, it's a 'must do' at anytime though. The lights were amazing and the shopping!! Well there's everything you could wish for and more. So vibrant and alive with action!"
,,Orchard Road Sales...,3.0,,"Love travelling to Singapore when the Sales are on in the stores - only coincidental as I don't necessarily travel because of the Sales.... but 70% off RRP, great for anyones pocket :-)"
,,Singapore shopping centre,4.0,,Orchard Road is the most famous shopping area in Singapore. It's all here so take the MRT to Orchard road for shopping or for night life as there are loads of bars and restaurants all along the street with the Hard Rock as well as many others!
,,Complete shopping enjoyment at Orchard Road,5.0,,"This is the place I always go to and never missed while in Singapore. Complete shopping experience from the largest Takashimaya as a landmark, Paragon with its branded collection shops or the Lucky plaza shopping arcade for those looking for more affordable items. Shopping and enjoyment in Singapore are on Orchard road..!"
,,Just keeps getting better,4.0,,Been visiting here for many years. Lots of the top stores but can be pricey. If you are looking for some bargains try some of the older malls at the south end of Orchard Road.
,,"malls,shopping & waiting for taxi",5.0,,One of famous streets in Singapore. It has numerous with all the big brands. You can spend a day here hopping malls. There is free shuttle from various Singapore hotels to Orchard road. And when you are done waiting for taxi is a big pain as it can take anything from 30-90 minutes in the queue waiting for taxi.
,,Clean Street and Reasonable Price,4.0,,"We went to Orchard Road by bus from our hotel in Little India. We walked to Lucky Plaza through underground tunnel from Ion Plaza. The streets are clean, and the traffic is not jammed. We found a lot of stores in the tunnel with interesting price and attractive promotions. We had lunch in the Hawker/Food Court in Lucky Plaza, the price of the food is quite reasonable there. The Hawker is located at the lower ground of the plaza. We planned to have dinner there, but when we returned there at 9:15 PM more than half of food outlets at the Hawker is already closed. Only fast food restaurants still open at that time."
,,Home of every premium and luxury brand,4.0,,"2 kms of shopping malls, high street and luxury brands. Super crowd. Good food. The prices weren't as great as I was led to believe. Everything is cheaper back home in India."
,,WOW,4.0,,"what an experience,a real eye opener
shops &malls cover any budget from the cheapest little trinkets stalls to the upmarket pradda & tiffanys
great food variety & malls all air conditioned which is a relief
was not prepared for what our taxi driver said to start at 1 end & work your way through,he was correct & we never did make it all the way"
,,The most iconic area for shopping pleasure,5.0,,"Singapore is Orchard Road, the most favorite and iconic area for shopping pleasure or just for window shopping. The surroundings are shopping centre forest. You can find most famous international brands or local brands. You can get find dinning or just casual foodcourts that suitable with your budget."
,,It's a shopping street,3.0,,"Orchard road is much like Nathan St in Hong Kong, Regents Street in London, and any other international city ""high end"" shopping street. It's got all of the usual shops, it's packed with people and to be totally honest there is nothing particularly unique about it. It also gets amazingly hot. If all you want to dois shop then fine, it's a good place to go, but if seeing the same brands as you would in any other city doesn't thrill you to the core then there are a lot better ways to spend your time in Singapore"
,,Shop until you drop,5.0,,"A wonderful shopping experience. If you can't find it here you won't find it. Good coffee places for the much needed rest! Great places to eat - especially the outside Italian Bar there.

Easy transportation makes for a great day out - if you want to shop that is..."
,,Too Much,4.0,,"The variety is unreal, and visiting just one centre can be an all day affair. I spent a full day and walked the entire length, up one side and back the other. Food areas are so full of choices. Prices of goods are not so cheap in some places, and I found the same items for half the price in lesser known areas."
,,Lots and lots of shops,5.0,,"I walked to Orchard Road from the Mandarin Oriental at Marina Bay. It was a hot, but pleasant walk. I stopped at the Butterfly Trail @ Orchard (http://nss.org.sg/project.aspx?id=1) and had a cool beverage before hitting the shops. Lovely garden right on the edge of Orchard Road. Really enjoyed looking through Takasimaya, especially the food court in the basement. Lots of wonderful foodie gifts. I brought home TWG tea, some of the finest breakfast and green tea I've ever tasted. A lightweight and affordable gift for friends back home. Hubby got a lovely and well priced watch at the Hour Glass. Fine luxury items priced far less than in the US (we compared prices online before we purchased) I must say, shopping is really not my thing, but I did enjoy one day on Orchard Road. Saw a dance marathon in front of one of the malls, and it was s sight I will never forget. Fantastic!! Lots to see if you like watching people!"
,,Need to Shop? No Problem,5.0,,"While not quite as expansive a selection of goods as you'll find in Hong Kong, Orchard Road remains one of my favourite shopping/eating/people-watching spots in the world. And I love that the stores are open late every night."
,,Very much a shopping paradise,5.0,,"Orchard road a shopping haven, so many clean, well maintained shopping malls in one place. Warm and friendly welcome everywhere you go, so many people happy to assist.
The food courts are educational, so much to choice a feast for every one of your senses.
A massive book shop, could have been all day in that one. Transport is excellent, clean and reliable and cheap. Everyone looks well dressed the fashion is great.
Enjoying all of this with a glass of wine or beer comes at a price, alcohol is a touch on the expensive side"
,,Shoppers' Paradise!,5.0,,"I would echo what many travellers would have already mentioned that it is genuinely a shoppers paradise. Honestly I have not so many malls and brands in one street - you can shop , shop and shop all day. Though the recommended time for Orchard Road is 2-3 hours - I would definitely suggest my shopaholic friends to plan to go there twice - or else you would always feel that you missed picking up that and repent why I didnt buy that?? I am sure you can relate to me :) You get a lot of variety from very high priced to medium priced brands. Lot of places to eat in and around. You can also beat the heat by being indoors specially during the afternoon. I loved a $ 2 shop ""Daiso"" which was a new thing for me as we dont have this chain in India. Over all a very good shopping experience for me in Orchard Road. Dont miss this when you are in Singapore!"
,,Spoilt for choice,5.0,,"Never seen so many shopping malls on one stretch!! Top brands , medium brands, even the small brands. Huge malls , medium sized malls & the very small ones!! Restaurants too!! A place for anybody , everybody !!"
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the busiest street in Singapore. Lots of people including local and foreigners. Take a underground train ride to Orchard station. Upon the exit of the station you will already see the extrance of a few big shopping malls. The Ion, Wisma Atri and the Wheelock place. So when you choose the exit, see which shopping center does it lead you to. If you love to shop and shop going through any one of these exits will lead you to another shopping and another shopping mall. All the malls have all the famous brand name as well as local brands. Orchard road definately lift up to its slogan, ""shop till you drop"". Make sure you put on a good pair of walking shoes. If you do feel tire after all the shopping. There are plenty of cafes serving a good piece of cake and a great cup of coffee. After all the underground shopping, you should take a walk on the streets to see how all these malls really look like from the top. You get some pretty nice shot on your camera."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise. One day is not enough to go to each mall. You can find all the signature shops and boutiques from all over the world. Not for shoppers with a tight budget like me, hehehe."
,,"Its just the same old shopping however, you can not ignore this Road",4.0,,With all the shops and Malls in Singapore you are definitely spoiled for choice along this strip. From pure Luxury shops to cheap tat shops you will spend a good few hours browsing and buying. in this area. It is the most famous Road in the country and you can see why when you visit.
,,Big Brands - Paradise for shoppers,5.0,,"We chose to visit Orchard Road on our last day in Singapore, so that we get ample time to explore the place and check out the brands. It definitely houses the biggest of brands in everything, starting from Louis Vitton, Mont Blanc, Gucci etc. The place leaves you awestruck, especially when such outlets are not available in your country.
Overall good experience walking around and checking the brands, can't finish in a day for sure."
,,Love it,5.0,,"We chose accommodation near orchard road (regency house) because of many reasons

Good clean food courts (food republic), shopping, close to somerset, orchard and Dhoby Gaut MRT, availability of taxis, walking distance to Fort canning, close to Killarney road.

Some of the best shopping malls: 313 somerset, ION orchard, pavilion.

You could spend weeks shopping, and still not see everything."
,,Shopping MECCA,4.0,,Fantastic shopping on Orchard Road! You definitely need a few days to explore all of what Orchard Road has to offer.
,,Still Hectic and Appealing.,4.0,,"Top end shopping abounds along the busy Orchard Road. Stand out locations are Tang Dynasty, ION, Paragon and Lucky Plaza. The MRT easily gets you there and over to you to enjoy. At this time there were many renovations in progress but overall the Road still is vibrant, colourful and a delight for shoppers and food lovers. Almost all the stores are refreshing away from the humidity outdoors. Best also to view this area in the evening when all the neons and lights are on. It is the place to be for very serious shopping."
,,Top End Place,5.0,,Stayed in Le Meridien at Orchard Road and its the most lively place with food plaza and high end shops and malls.

,,The labyrinth of all high streets,4.0,,"Don't let the drive by fool you, there are more shops to see underneath. Orchard Rd is massive and you could easily spend the whole day and all future paychecks without even trying. There are multiple levels of air-conditioned stores packed with merchandise and lots of high end stores to drool over. Don't go there expecting a bargain, but do expect to be dazzled. It is easy to get to from pretty much anywhere in Singapore. There are multiple busses and trains and taxis that will take you there. Bring your best and prettiest walking shoes, you'll need them."
,,Mall O Mania,5.0,,Get off at the Orchard Street Station and youre in an underground mall - basements +3 levels and each one canyons into the other all inside underground confusingly crazy and if youre a shophahoic nothing better! food drink shop till you drop ! get inside go outside - its a 3km long road and you can spend a day in there !

We across from Batam to Singapore with fery, and after arrive, we directly to go to Orchard Road because I really curious, what are inside Orchard Road that really popular in my community.

And really, there many shops that sale many stuff to bought. Orchard Road is a busy place which many people will buy anything they want, from low price until expensive price depend on their budget, and for me, I do not buy expensive stuff, but I buy cheap stuff like t-shirt, neckle for my sister, hat, cheap watch.

I wish I can go to Singapore again but I wish I have much money to buy another things that I do not have yet."
,,Luxury shopping,5.0,,"A road that could launch a thousand brands! A showcase of Singapore's affluence, you could walk the whole stretch of the Orchard in just a couple of hours. Trees lined up the Orchard making some covered pathways with chirping birds above your head. Tourists, locals and foreign workers converge en masse in all corners from all walks of life. Don't buy if you don't have any; makes for perfect window shopping only."
,,Need to be rich to shop here but good window shopping,3.0,,Very very expensive high end designer shopping. Even the cafés were expensive. Good for window shopping but not much else.
,,Posh Road - Orchard Road,5.0,,This is the fanciest part of town where the road is full of high end classy malls with over 100s of shops to choose from. Each mall has a dedicated food court which have some great restaurants as well as local food stalls. This isn't in everyone's budget as far as the shopping goes but its worth a visit to stroll through and see how the locals spend their time there.
,,Love it!,5.0,,"It takes a while to get started in the mornings, but once it does Orchard Road is amazing! It's busy with huge shopping centers, food options and it has a great buzz even late at night. I felt safe & the Singaporeans were always helpful & smiling. All the brand stores - Prada, Armani - it's a great spot to while away a day or two no worries"
,,Unbelievable,4.0,,I couldn't get over the number of shops and malls and centres along Orchard road. We went in one and came out the other side of the road but in the opposite direction that we thought we'd gone in. However for bargains no its up market and a lot of the shops are in Australia so sale items tend to be the same. Go to markets for bargains
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the busy streets in Singapore where people goes into Shopping. It is like one of the metropolitan area in Singapore where it is crowded with different nationals that you can see, some traffic jams are there and sorts of.
This is the area where shopping is made possible from souvenirs, designer clothings, etc. There multitude no. of malls from left to right where a visitor can choose from."
,,Good place but heart pain.,2.0,,"Orchard road is no longer for singapore residents.. Its conquered by outsider, indians dan pinoy... So annoying, irritiating and pathetic."
,,Come here to experience the atmosphere,3.0,,"No visit to singapore will be complete without being on this main street. It is full of high end shopping , of course if one to look closely, there are actually departmental stores that offer hugh discounts here. Easy to travel here via MRT."
,,A good place for shopping...,3.0,,"The area filled with a lot of malls and actually shopping is not really my thing so I was kinda get bored here. But, along the road, there were some ice cream sellers, and my cousin told me that usually when people went to Orchard, they will taste that ice cream, and it only cost 1singapore dollar.It is cheap and has variety of flavour, and yeah the ice cream healed me after going around the malls.."
,,High end shopping,3.0,,"If you like shopping and spending a lot of money, then you will certainly enjoy Orchard Road. It has some impressive malls and buildings, but it is solely a retail area really. If you are looking for a more sedate and cultural experience, then perhaps this is not the place for you. Quite interesting, but expect to pay high prices for the usual brands."
,,WOW !,5.0,,"Such a beautiful place, reminded me of NY Times Square, but this is much cleaner and nicer. The shopping center of Singapore, with almost all the brands located here. Must try the ice-cream sandwich sold on the street."
,,Must see,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore would be complete without a visit to this super chic strip. Great shopping options and food venues. The Takashimaya building downstairs food court and niche food shops is a must. Great food, safe and delicious. Cold Storage supermarket is also worth the visit for a great view of everything the world can offer, food and grocery wise. Soak up the atmosphere and get swept along with the rush of literally thousands of people.
N.B If you don't like crowds, don't visit on the weekend"
,,shoppers paradise,3.0,,"I spent an evening walking up Orchard Road having during the day crossed it at many points
It is one long parade of shopping malls, department stores, boutiques etc. They all started blurring into each other. I did come across a bit of park with what looked like an open air stage whit a number of young people acting and dancing - a refreshing break from the endless shops..
I guess if you are willing to shop till you drop you couldn't do better than this.
I was totally bemused and overwhelmed. After two hours of starring at windows and checking labels both known and unknown I quit
How do these shops survive - it cannot be the local population - there must be a host of tourists that shop here.
To me there were a lot of more interesting places to visit in Singapore."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"You will need more than one day to visit all the shopping centres along Orchard Road.

My favourites are Ion and Ngee Ann City.

While you are here, try the ice cream stall for the $1 ice cream treats. It's truly one of a kind that you only get in Singapore! Look for the umbrellas with words like WALLS (a local ice cream brand). It's easy to spot the stalls, usually with long queues."
,,Shopper's Paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the world's great shopping areas. If you are not a shopper then do not go here as shopping is the prime pastime.
Orchard Road stretches for a good few Km and is lined by large shopping malls on either side of the road. if you like branded goods every major brand is represented here. Orchard Road is serviced by numerous cabs and many metro stations."
,,OXFORD STREET OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,"Wow! I m in London but this is not the wet and gloomy Oxford Street depending on its season, this is the humid and sunny Orchard Road of Singapore. Take yr pick of branded genuine branded goods from Paragon to Takashimaya and ION of renowned brands of Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, Fergaramo. Majority of the shopping malls are interconnected whereby you can avoid the scorching sun o rain. Enjoy our shopping paradise and now is the Great Singapore Sales is ON ..... what are u waiting for?"

,,Shopaholic Paradise,3.0,,Don't waste your time here if you don't plan to do shopping in Singapore. Nothing interesting there unless tons of malls. We wasted our valuable 1 hour just to pass by all the shopping malls.
,,grand,5.0,,Orchard Road is a long stretch of road whereby one can spend days shopping. It has all the major stores and is a lot grander than many malls you can find in other countries.
,,One of the Singapore greats!,5.0,,"An amazing experience. Many, many malls from high class to lower end. So much great food and slightly pricey coffee on offer. Easy to get to mainly via the Orchard or Somerset rail station. Plenty of buses too. Definitely more expensive than HK but just as good. Can be very crowded particularly near the Lucky Plaza shopping centre. The best people watching opportunities and a good place to meet people as well. Take note that some electronics stores in at least one mall can be a little shall we say inconsistent when dealing with customers!!!.... Taxis are scarce and a long wait is often required. Generally very safe but the odd incident may occur at night. Very good photo opportunities. Most toilets are free but in Lucky Plaza the cost if 20 cents. Can't wait to return!"
,,"Orchard Road - eat, shop and just “people watch”.",5.0,,"Where to begin?
This is Singapore’s retail and entertainment hub.
I guess that the biggest “sell” that I can give Orchard Road is that I planned to go there for a quick look but ended up going back many times to eat, shop and just “people watch”.
Orchard Road is only a couple of kilometres long and has plenty of trees and shade so it’s not hard to walk the distance but you’ll find that you’ll need to set aside plenty of time because the amount and variety of retail and dining here is mind boggling.
Getting there is easy. Taxis are cheap, hotels run shuttle buses and there’s an MRT station as well.
Orchard Road got its name from the orchards that the road led to back in the 1800s.
TANGS(as in Tang Plaza) was the first retailer on Orchard Road, the oldest home-bred department store in Singapore, and is one of 3 fabulous Malls on the Orchard/Paterson/Scotts Road intersection.
Tang Plaza you can pick by its Chinese styled roof.
Opposite TANGS is ION Orchard (its glass front also doubles as a giant media screen ) and Wheelock Place. All 3 are worth the time to explore but appearances are deceptive because there’s a lot happening below ground as well with a lot of retail space as well as underground walkways between the malls that run underneath the street, as well as an MRT station.
In addition to the above that there’s The Ngee Ann City Shopping Mall (think Prada, Giorgio Armani, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, Cartier – that sort of luxury brand that I certainly can’t afford!), Lucky Plaza (the other side of the street to Ngee Ann and certainly more MY budget!) and Paragon.
There’s sooooooooooo much more.
On my travels I would think of this as being one of the most pleasantly surprising of all spots that I’ve been to."
,,Absolutely Fabulous,5.0,,"A great place to shop. So many shops. So many shopping centres. Loved the ""ion"". It like a rabbit warren. 4 levels underground. The first time to you go down you can get lost. Hard to find your way back up again. The food courts are great too. So much to choose from."
,,"Same old, same old",2.0,,"This is a nice street to shop at, if that is your kind of thing. It is generally over-crowded, lacks character, and the restaurants are outrageously expensive. If you've done your research and know pretty much what you want to buy, then you wouldn't need more than an hour in this God forsaken area. It deserves a quick entry and exit only. This is no Stroget. If shop you must in Southeast Asia, there are equally good (or better) deals in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok."
,,Fantastic I loved every moment,5.0,,We stayed in orchard road . It was around Christmas time so they had amazing light displays and singers in each hotel . It was one of the best times of my life I must say
,,Good selection of shops,5.0,,"Most people deemed that Orchard Road is expensive. That's probably because the big label shops are well situated along the main human traffic flow. You can find good buys at some shops if you're keen to look for them; such as Isetan at Shaw Centre, mobile phone shops at Far East Plaza, and Takashimaya at Nee Ann City."
,,Shopaholics' Haven,4.0,,"For foreign visitors to Singapore, Orchard road is definitely one of items on the Must-Do checklist. Don't get me wrong, you do not need to spend loads of money (that is if you can resist the temptation), but just window-shop and have a meal/coffee along the stretch. It is a one-stop area filled with glitzy malls like ION, Wisma Atria, NgeeAnn City, Paragon, just to name a few, plus boutiques, shop. Orchard is a pretty long stretch, but don't worry about covering all the malls, because a lot of the boutiques are repeats (esp global brands)..
For the foodies, there are countless food establishments (restaurants, mid to high end... ).. Try Din Tai Fung...
OR for the economic-conscientious (Non-Restaurant with no service charge), there are multiple 'food courts' located within the malls. For example, Food Republic in Wisma Level 4, Food court in Lucky Plaza B1, Food place in Tangs Orchard B1, and also Food Opera located at ION Orchard B4. At Food Opera, I'd recommend local favourites like Naan with Butter chicken, DimSum (LukYu), Chilli Crab, etc..."
,,Shopping Along Orchard Road,4.0,,The must visit shopping street of Singapore where the best shopping and good dining restaurants/cafes are located. Never to be missed on a trip to Singapore.
,,Good for tourists,5.0,,"Loads of shops, great night scene and plenty to do for both the local expat and tourist. A must for a holiday. Start one end and work your way along all the shops. Should take the best part of a day."
,,HIGH END SHOPPING STREET,3.0,,"Orchard Road is a glitzy shopping area. Most if not all the luxury brands have their stores here. Some with more than one located in this street. It is comfortable shopping, no doubt about it and new malls are popping up even though this place has been in existence as a high end shopping area for decades. This seems to be a must visit place for visitors, especially the first time visitors. Indonesian tai tais make it a point to come here regularly to satisfy their shopping appetite. Besides shops there are medical centres and restaurants, lots of it. Visit it once and if you like to spend your money, this is the place!"
,,"Too high end and expensive, but still worth a visit to see",3.0,,"I eagerly anticipated by visit to Orchard Road, and I was left disappointed not by the sheer number of shops that line the road, but the lack of variety in the shops - majority are all or closer to the high end side, with little room for local chains. A lot of these high end brands I could purchase at home or online cheaper than what I could buy them for on Orchard Road, even after tax.

Glad I visited but not on a list to go back to."
,,Brand shopping time,3.0,,"I personally didnt really like this place. But if you want to go shopping branded things such as burberry, prada, etc its a good place to go. There also kinokuniya, a big book store from japan. There also an electronic centre across the street but i dont recommend you to go there."
,,Nice place to shop/ eat,4.0,,Nice place for a tourist to shop/ eat/ hangout. This place has both well known brands as well as local ones.
,,"Orchard, 1 dollar Ice cream",4.0,,I've been in Singapore for 4 times and always get 1 dollar ice cream in orchard. Sitting in front of a lot of expensive department store and enjoy the ice cream is one of kind if unforgettable memories I have experienced
,,Disappointed,2.0,,I was lead to believe that Orchard Road was a shoppers paradise. WRONG! All merchandise was expensive. The food outlets were limited and the places we could find certainly did not meet Australia Food Safety Standards. Singapore was not the clean city we were told about. We could not get out of Singapore quick enough.
,,"Too expensive for us, but it's still amazing!",4.0,,"A lot of big label shops around, very much the higher end of shopping and being the S$ is much the same as the NZ$, we were very weary of spending money here. Out of our league is more to the point! It's a must see though, all the malls and expensive sopping. Just be aware, an early start won't get you anywhere; most of the places are shut until 10:30 - 11am!"
,,Shopping World,4.0,,"Like other popular shopping areas in other countries, Orchard Road is the same. Crowded and noisy, you may see different faces, very international. And you can find some rare brands which not available in China yet - which I like.

And to my surprise, the shopping road is incredibly clean, the entire country is quite clean.

One thing I dislike is that the AC in mall is quite cold compare with super hot temperature outside.

Worth a go."
,,Good Hang out-shopping/eating options,4.0,,"It is the heart of Singapore-offering a wide array of options, be it shopping eating or just hanging out,
with friends/family.
Easy to reach from any part and from major hotels-some of them offer complimentry drop/pick up
to a pre-fixed central place on Orchard Road.
Plenty of bargains on shopping around the year and one does not have to wait for the Great Singapore Shopping Festival-so go ahead and enjoy !"
,,The best shopping street in the world,5.0,,"I never need to go shopping overseas or to hunt for anything, because it's right in my own country.

Orchard road has absolutely everything, from designer brands to street fashion. Of course there's also food at every turn of the way.

It's a whole stretch of shopping center after shopping center. It is possible to go through the whole stretch of shopping centers without stepping foot outdoors.

All the buildings are connected underground, which is most appreciated when the weather outside is crazy hot.

During weekends, it is way too crowded for my tastes. But weekday afternoons and evenings are great."
,,Best shopping spot in Singapore,5.0,,"My hotel was in Orchard Road. Good location, atmosphere, restaurants stores, shows and a lot of locals on the street.
I like Orchard Road because is clean and you have the subway near so you can get anywhere in Singapore from there.
Has the best stores and shopping malls which is the ""sport"" of Singapore.
Is very interesting to see the locals afterwork going shopping or having a coffee in a trendy cafeteria on that area."
,,The reason we are called a shopping paradise,4.0,,I believe orchard road is the reason why Singapore is called a shopping paradise for visitors as there are countless malls located along this stretch of roads in Singapore. Many international 5-stars hotel are also located here. You can literally walk for a day and still not finish visiting every mall located here. Many dining options available that suits all kinds of budgets. Commuting to this part of Singapore is very easy with the mrt stations along orchard road and many public buses ply this stretch of roads too.
,,Shoppers paradise.nSomething for everyone.,4.0,,"If you want to do a spot of shopping in Asia then Orchard Road is for you.
From the food courts to the gadget shops to the designer outlets, there's something for everyone.
If you're looking for bargains on the latest electronics, cameras etc. then it could be worth a visit.
It does get very hot of course so a short break in a food court or bar is appealing and a great place to do some people watching."
,,Shopping maniac??? right place for you!!!,5.0,,"The best way to get to this shopping heaven is by MRT. Getting off at Orchard station you will be at the basement of ION mall.
When you are here get lost in malls and malls… the full boulevard has numerous multi story shopping centre.

You name it and you have all possible brands here high end to mid-range…

Shopping isn’t cheap here but at least once you have to visit this avenue.
We had been here Christmas time also and the charm of the street was completely different from the one we got to see this time.
Christmas is more fun as all the lanes is full of Christmas décor… lights everywhere… and people in full zest of the festival. And to add to this many outlets were offering Sale and offers "
,,Shoppers paradise!,4.0,,How many Malls can you build on one road? Fabulous shopping for all tastes and budgets! Mall after Mall all the way down with the odd coffee shop and restaurant to refuel at. If you get hungry I would recommend the food halls … not at all like in the UK the food is good! ION was our favourite of the malls!
,,This is the shopping mecca of Singapore.,4.0,,This is where most of the shopping happens in Singapore. From low end like Lucky Center to High end retail shops Orchard street has got it all.. but please note Singapore is not cheap by any standards so shop with care.
,,It's got a bit of everything,4.0,,"There's everything here. All the top end brands. If you don't want the top end, go underground or to some of the older malls. It's always busy at any time of day and not somewhere you need to go unless you have your serious shopper hat on."
,,Shopping Place,3.0,,"If you had a shopping budget, it's a place for you. As a shopping lover, this place is a must to visit in Singapore. Too bad the designs doesn't really fit me. It can be too crowded in some stores. You can just come earlier if you want. After a tiring day, you can just sit and enjoy an ice cream from street vendor/"
,,There's no place like Orchard,4.0,,"Spanning almost 2.2km, Orchard Road is nowadays a swanky, one-way palm tree-lined boulevard offering nearly 800,000 sqm of retail, dining and entertainment options to please any taste or budget. It is full of upscale departments stores and shopping malls, such as Ngee Ann City and Takashimaya. Inside each of these amazing malls are hundreds of upscale shops, restaurants, and fast food outlets.

Another two major malls on Orchard Road are Paragon and ION Orchard. Although a huge Gucci is situated just outside, the interior of Paragon seemed to me as a more regular kind of mall with not so much luxury as some of the others on Orchard, although ION Orchard is arguably the most impressive of the lot, with its space-age façade and MRT station built just in front of the mall itself. It is outside ION where you will find flagship stores for Prada, Emporio Armani, and Cartier, among many others.

313 @ Somerset and Plaza Singapura are two other specialist malls on the Orchard shopping belt. I in particular really adore 313 @ Somerset with its emphasis on young and chic fashion. Plaza Singapura was actually the first mall to open on Orchard way back in 1974. Since then obviously newer and larger malls have opened, such as ION and Ngee Ann City. The result of which is that there are more and more options for the consumer!

As you may expect with a shopping district of this calibre, it attracts attention from everybody, from window-shoppers to serious money-spenders! The crowds at Orchard can be devastating sometimes, especially during Singapore public holidays, so it is best to plan ahead and perhaps get there and back as early as possible to beat the worst of the crowds. However, just as with all major shopping districts in this part of the world (think Bukit Bintang in Kuala Lumpur, Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok, Makati in Manila, etc), the crowds are all part of the charm! The palm trees and tropical temperatures somewhat help the stress of dealing with the Orchard Road crowds, and although it gets busy, it is never busy enough to completely ruin your enjoyment. There is still room for everyone – unlike London’s Oxford Street!"
,,Wow!!!,4.0,,"Unless you have unlimited funds to shop, it is a waste of time. Any designer you can think of is represented in the stores in this area. It is a bit overwhelming. There are so many stores. We used the Orchard Rd MRT station and found two more levels of a mall underground with more high-end stores. Unless you can afford Harry Winston and Rolex or Gucci and Prada, it's a bit out of reach for the average person. I felt like I was on Rodeo Dr. in LA. It is a beautiful street, with lots of trees. It is also very busy with people and traffic."
,,Average,2.0,,"This place is not what it once was. If you like crowds and designer shopping, go here. If you want authentic, ""old world Singapore"" go as far from here as possible. It's a big, busy street with lots of overpriced Western world clothes and an occasional souvenir shop. Ho hum."
,,Non-shoppers: Avoid like the Plague!,3.0,,"Unless you're looking for high-end items, Orchard Road is one to avoid. There's nothing different here to what you will find in any other city's CBD area and pricing is nothing to write home about (much the same as Australia).

Considering you practically trip over shopping centres around Singapore's CBD, there's really no need to go out of your way to visit Orchard Road unless you're a keen shopper looking to remortgage your house."
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Although Singapore full of shopping malls everywhere in this small island, but if you want high end luxuries and branded goods you shall go to Orchard Road as this area are full of World branded & luxuries staff from all over the world ... enjoy the tax free when you buy anythings in Singapore ..."
,,"SHOPPING, SHOPPING, SHOPPING",5.0,,"Orchard Rd can be found by getting to Orchard MRT station. Throughout Orchard Rd there are shops as far as the eye can see. There are many big brand labels like LV, Prada, Chanel, Gucci, Dior, Hugo Boss and more.

The best thing about Orchard Rd is that you can get various flavours of ice-cream sandwiches from street carts. This is the thing you definitely have to do when you are on Orchard Rd. The line ups are long sometimes especially on a hot day."
,,"ORCHARD ROAD, SINGAPORE",4.0,,"Orchard Road was the key area for top end shopping malls and five(5)stars hotels and still is; despite the facts that many good hotels and shopping malls are springing up in other areas in SINGAPORE. Orchard Road is akin to Regent/Oxford Street in London, Champs Elysees in Paris. Walking down Orchard Road following the traffic flow from Shaw House towards Singapura Mall, one will come across all the beautiful shopping malls : ISETAN, IONS, TANGS, WISMA, LUCKY PLAZA, ROBINSONS,TAKASHIMAYA, 313,...........and Hotels: Marriots, Mandarin, Parkroyal,......Good eateries are also aplenty lining the road or in the shopping malls and hotels. During Christmas, the whole stretch of road is lighted up with CHRISTMAS LIGHTING DECOS. Many visitors reckon it is one of the best globally as compared to other infamous CHRISTMAS LIGHTS in the world!!! Do have a walk down ORCHARD ROAD when visiting Singapore."
,,Cosmopolitan,5.0,,Everything you want to see in a cosmopolitan city. From high end luxuries to everyday essentials. Travelling to different malls is convenient
,,Great shopping Zone (Expensive),4.0,,"I was there for four days the area is excellent for shopping all leading world brands are there, great selections. Too many shopping complexes and all are expensive some times you can get great discount deals.
If you want to buy some cheap items you can go to Lucky Plaza lots of selections some are cheaper than China town."
,,Mall after mall after mall after.....,5.0,,"If you can't find it here you won't find it anywhere since this street, about a kilometer long, is one shopping mall after another with everything from the top designer brands to five and dimes. There are also lots of restaurants. It does get very crowded in the afternoon and evening."
,,Good window shopping no bargains ridiculously expensive!,3.0,,"I think that once pano a time, there were bargains to be had on Orchard Rd. As an Australian, the appeal lies in being able to browse sores that we still don't have in Australia but even there, the prices are outrageous. How many REGULAR tourist, can afford Jimmy Choo shoes or Fendi bags? Ha ha I saw some really nice scarves in a window in the Paragon and realised I was in the Hermés store! Lots of stuff suits the under thirty crowd but don't go looking for underwear - ALL the bras are padded... Also, finding anything that is suitable for your own climate is hard. I spent up a storm at the Marina Bay Shoppes which just seemed less taxing. Do try the anger Ann City food court - it's great. Recommended malls are Paragon, Ion (less interesting) and Takashimaya. also the Mall just near Somerset MRT is quite good. The boulevard atmosphere is nice and there are some decent restaurants tucked away along the road. Loads of construction at the moment so really, unless you're staying near OrchRd Rd if recommend going further afield for your shopping experience."
,,Place to go to shop,4.0,,"This is the place to go if you like to shop, shop, shop especially if you're into expensive items. However there are many inexpensive stores also located in the area. The food court should not be missed."
,,So many shops and so little time and money,5.0,,This road has to be seen to be believed. Every exclusive shop is here and even if you don't buy it's well worth window shopping. There are many malls to explore- most of which are underground. Keep you eyes open for the many exclusive cars that park and drive along the road.
,,"Same, same, but then some...",3.0,,"If big shopping malls and the usual international brands with their sometimes overpriced products is something you crave for, this is for you. Should you however think this is boring and the same, same as in most big cities, beware: there are some unique little shops hidden inbetween the malls and high rises that do sell unique Asian (not always Singaporean) goods and artefacts that would be difficult to obtain somewhere else.

To walk on the side of the street with towering high rises next to you with the sweltering, humid heat and then experiencing an afternoon tropical rainshower has been a unique. There are more interesting places to visit in Singapore, but it is still worth the visit."
,,The place to be,5.0,,"This is the place to stay in singapore. You have it all around here. Shopping hotel food.... Very lively place crowded day and night. From the beginning of road, it is very lively at night with girls wandering around. So if you traveling with family it would be better to stay far from these part. The middle part of the road is full of malls and this is where all your money will vanish. Stayed in a hotel down the road with my family, and it was awesome as taxi are readily available and the train station also."
,,OMG,4.0,,Even if you don't shop much visit this area. All the big fashion names are here and window shopping becomes a sport. The food hall under ION is an adventure and a must do.
,,Very clean,5.0,,"Orchard road is one of the famous road in Singapore. Travel can see many brands of fashion and high buildings. Sometimes , there are a lots birds which fly around and the road is really clean."
,,Luxury Shopping Street,5.0,,"This called the most expensive street in Singapore. So many famous clothing , bagging , shoes stay here to wait people come to catch it. Well if you have money , this is best place to Shopping."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"You can find all the brand here everywhere is shopping mall, i spent the whole day here and i didn't even get bored haha"
,,recommended!,3.0,,All of the famous brand name are displayed in orchard road. where you can buy the most updated trend of clothes. the whole road is for shopping.
,,Shopaholic heaven MEGA MALL,5.0,,"Walking all along this most biggest shopping road just like walking along the red - fashion carpet in the top world-wide fashion show. We can find out any single cloth brand you love. It took us more than 3 hour walking along and get all around the Takasimaia building. Well if you wife, partner, gf are such a shopaholic person so this is the right place to calm them down after long year tired taking care of your family."
,,All in one road,5.0,,"You can literally find anything you want here at orchard road, from cheap to expensive, the best shopping place ever."
,,Bending the Plastic!,5.0,,"Shopping Malls galore - you will want for nothing as you browse around endless high class shops, many of which are situated in an underground maze of air conditioned walkways, up and down so many escalators. These precincts are high class with shop window displays beautifully presented and staff who are very welcoming and helpful. This the area to wander if you wish to buy a new ""wardrobe"". for example!? Cafes and restaurants are all available - should you wish to get your breath back at anytime."
,,Main shopping area of Singapore,4.0,,Famous as the Champs Elysee in Paris or Bond Street in London. More than 20 malls with the most exclusive brands and trendiest fashion houses. I mainly went to the ION Orchard mall. This monster mall spans eight retails floors and 48 more residential floors.
,,Great for a stroll and shopping,5.0,,This place is great. Lovely for a stroll and/or a bit of retail therapy. I'd say it can be very hot in the height of summer but lovely in February.
,,If it want to shop,3.0,,"It could be anywhere in the world if it wasn't for the heat. Every designer brand seems to have a presence here and the various shopping malls are a consumer dream - if you've got the cash, as things are not cheap in Singapore - the air conditioning in all the shops is welcoming but must use up endless amounts of power."
,,Kinda like Times Square,4.0,,"I visit orchard almost every week. The first time I was there, it was quite a site. Tall buildings and lots of lights and screens. Very expensive shopping. Nice to see."
,,Shop till you drop !!,5.0,,"Visitors to Orchard Road are spoilt for choice when it comes to upscale shopping options. It is home to more than 1000 outlets of leading international high street brands and designers sprawling over kilometers. Your feet will leave you, but not the options!! You can shop till you drop!!"
,,Shopping Spree Area,4.0,,"You can find almost all famous brands in the world here, both luxury and casual brands One day is not enough."
,,Shopping!,5.0,,"Possibly the best place, if not the only place in Singapore were all the shopping is found within the one area.

A little touristy, and therefore busy however we have always looked for our hotels within the area and manage to spend a lot of time shopping."
,,High end and normal round of shops,3.0,,If you are in singapore and need a little dose of international standards in shopping go here. Lots of high end shops and a movie theater with english support or style.
,,A Shopping Extravanganza,4.0,,"Most of the country's shopping malls found here... Visit Singapore's biggest bookstore, Kinokuniya, at Takashimaya. For teens clothing/etc, head to Cathay Cineleisure or The Heeren. Shopping: Takashimaya, Paragon, Wisma Atria. Stay away from Orchard Towers unless you're looking for pubs/prostitutes.

Finally orchard rd is gr8. fun for all the family. any one from anywhere will love it, shopping, food, night life. its all here."
,,Nice Malls but expensive,4.0,,There are lots to see and admire. Lots of shops to visit but really expensive. Food courts available.
,,A shopping Mecca,5.0,,"This place is amazing. There is a shop or should I say Mall, for everyone. Whilst most of the ground level stores are high end and only for the very wealthy, it's just as fun strolling through the likes of Tiffany, Prada and Louis V. The lower basement stores are excellent as are the underpass arcades and you'll be sure to find a bargain or two in the department stores. Crossing the road is a treat as you can watch movie clips on big screens at just about every corner. A visit to Singapore would be lacking if you didn't fit in an expedition to this shopping haven."
,,Shopping street but expensive,3.0,,Lined with A-class malls and large food courts. But the shopping is quite expensive. This is no Hong-Kong.
,,Go once so you can say you did,3.0,,"Orchard Road is famous as a shopping mecca and has been for many years. And certainly it does make for a decent wander if you go to the 'top' and walk back down. There are plenty of shopping centres that are all uniformly uniform and interchangeable. There are plenty of (praise be) air conditioned buildings to wander around swooning at the name brand stores and a few pleasant enough buntings strung up off street poles etc.

The place also has a few bottom end tourist trap stores which do at least serve a purpose (you don't want to go home without a Merlion paper weight do you?) and the place is well enough serviced by transport.

Downsides are that unless swooning over name brands is your thing it's pretty boring. Few of the buildings are interesting to look at, many of the stores aren't open oven by mid-morning given so much of their trading occurs in the evening and really given the plethora of other shopping options that have sprung up around Singapore perhaps the place has lost its lustre somewhat.

Still, for those who have heard about it for so long this is it."
,,wouldn't go again,2.0,,Nice to see but expensive to stay. Recommend if you want to see it get on a bus that drives through. Lots of high end shops.
,,Different world...,5.0,,Its like a different world when you look at the stuff and the prices there For normal persons not to understand how people can buy a clock for 35.000$ Nice architecture and a great atmosphere Nice to see how the rich are living 😄
,,Unbelievable Shopping and choice,5.0,,"I last visited Singapore in 1992 and was impressed with Orchard Road. It is now beyond your wildest imagination. Beautiful structure after structure, featuring all the top brands from around the world. You can spend hours just walking and window shopping. It's worth it to go at night .... the way the area is lit up is a treat and it is buzzing with people everywhere. Just soak it in!"
,,Non-shoppers enjoy seeing the architecture,4.0,,"Our hotel shuttle dropped us off here and we began hiking around the many buildings/malls in this area. Subway access led us to other places. We enjoyed the area, but didn't get the feel that this is ""real Singapore life."" But then it is high-end shopping, so what did we expect? We found the shopping choices and architecture at the Marina Sands shoppes to be superior, but indoors."
,,Nice,4.0,,"Malls are overrated since i'm sure u hv at least one in ur country, but the way the government managed the area is excellent. Its clean and very safe even during the night. Transportation are easy and with several malls lined up in the are, there's hardly anything that u can't find here. Don't forget to buy roadside ice cream sandwhich!"
,,Exciting Orchard Road,5.0,,Orchard Road - a wonderful shopping experience for those who wish to purchase or just window shop. This shopping strip is not to be missed with plenty to see and many great restaurants.
,,safe city street,5.0,,"Its Singapore's most iconic shopping street. Its a wide avenue, relatively clean and safe. Let me emphasise this safe safe safe. I like fine watches and Singapore is one of the few cities that i will comfortably wear a gold swiss watch while riding the MTR. Hong Kong is the other. So if you are in singapore don't get lost in the shopping, walk along the avenues and appreciate that you can do so without fear of violence or any crime."
,,Shopaganza!,4.0,,For the confirmed shopaholic this is a long street of back to back shopping malls. Although you do see the same chains on a regular basis there are enough individual retailers to make things interesting and different malls have different focuses.A few more bench seats for foot sore tourists would be welcome though.
,,Many shops all selling the same overpriced stuff,3.0,,"The title of my review says it all really. We spent a day on Orchard Road working our way down one side and up the other, and yes there are some amazing shopping centres containing so many shops. But basically as far as I could see, so many shops were selling the same overpriced items. I could get the same or similar items in Australia at lower prices so I did not buy a thing apart from a DVD set about the history of Singapore and a cup of coffee when caffeine deficiency struck. Having said that, I am not really a ""shopper"" and retail therapy is not my thing as I prefer to spend time doing the cultural and history thing."
,,Must do if you are in Singapore,4.0,,"Lots of shopping malls, the more prominent ones are Ngee Ann City (which house Takashimaya), Ion Orchard, Weelock, Tangs, Atria and others too.

Food are aplenty with restaurants and cafe as well as food courts for the budget conscious and those who want to try on local food. Superb place if you are into designer stuffs otherwise it's a great place for people watching as well as window shopping.

Come weekends, it is bursting with people walking at both parallel roads, I would say it is not too hot to walk along Orchard Roads as most pavements are shaded with mature trees."
,,Just malls,3.0,,"Malls, malls, malls. If you love shopping and have the money to spend, this is the place for you. Some of the foodcourts within the malls are good, but I think you can find better food in other parts of Singapore. It's super commercialised, kinda of bland, just ads and advertisement. I do admit it is a nice place to just have a stroll and see other foreign tourists and do some people watching while having a coffee or something."
,,Chain stores and Restaurants,3.0,,The street has almost any expensive store that you can think of and while would I want to go there. I don't travel the world to shop for products I can get at home. It would be much easier to stay home and shop. Boring.
,,So overrated.,3.0,,"This is just a fancy shopping street, nothing more. It is SO overrated, since expensive shopping can be found in other parts of Singapore, too."
,,It's fine if you have a big bank balance,3.0,,"Orchard Rd is a Singapore institution. I can see why people love it, but it's just not my style. Almost unlimited shopping options abound here. Prices seemed similar or more expensive than for the same items back home in Australia, so I didn't buy too much. The high-end malls, such as Ion, are good for window shopping. Really hard to get a taxi from here on weekends, so get the MRT instead."
,,Expensive and very expensive shopping,4.0,,"So many shopping centers in a nicely decorated street,but it is very expensive and overprice.we liked strolling ,coffee and eating but no shopping."
,,Shops in an easily accessible street,4.0,,"Plan to spend at least half a day, as you would want to check so many things. Evenings are a bit more crowded."
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"The whole stretch of Orchard Road is nothing but a conglomerate of shopping malls. You hop in & hop out of different shopping malls. The pace is full of electronic goods, textiles, gift items etc. Each Mall is eye catching but prices are mind boggling. If you are a budget traveller then you are at a wrong place to shop. But you can have a heart-full of gaze at the various wares displayed free of charge. There are various Restaurants to satiate your hunger. The whole stretch of the road is good for hanging on with family and friends in the evenings. It is always crowded and traffic is a nuisance and women, children and aged people have to be little careful & alert. It is a nice attraction in Singapore but it will leave a big hole in your pocket if you go for shopping."
,,Shopping Shopping Shopping,5.0,,"Shopping, Shopping, Shopping – Amazing shopping street massive shopping centres and loads of them. You will need the whole day & loads of money as you can get great stuff ranging from all prices."
,,Good number of shopping centres for luxury items,3.0,,If you are looking for luxury items and big brands then orchard road is the place to go. The shopping centres are all the same and everything was pretty much over our budget. Not the place to get a bargain.
,,An Icon of Singapore!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is so much a part of the Singapore experience. Drive down the street, catch a local bus or taxi down the street or even better, walk down this iconic street. You will see a myriad of shops, malls and dept. stores from high end to amazing bargains for $10. If you love shopping, this is Retail Therapy at its very best. There is a huge variety of retail stores and malls, which are beautifully decorated. There are a huge variety of places to rest and refresh, if you want to make a day of it.
Orchard Road really comes alive during festivals, when the lights and decorations make it a truly beautiful place at night.
So if you have the time, go have a look at this iconic place.
It's also a great spot for people watching!
Have fun! :)"
,,Just a street full of shops,3.0,,"Try not to go during daytime because the heat in the street is killer, and the distance between each mall seems unreachable.
If you've been travelling through Asia as we did, you'll find this place VERY expensive for the same things you can find anywhere else."
,,it's more than just shopping malls,4.0,,"to some people, orchard road is where they go shopping for branded items. Its vibrant fashion is along the road, and it may keep eyes opened for most shopping freaks. the names of the world's top brands welcome you at the entrance of each mall. I was not really into shopping, for my money would not go beyond the nicknacks offered in traditional spots such as Bugis Market, Chinatown, and Kampung Glam. Just go to orchard road in Chinese New Year or during other special occasions and you will usually find this landscape fully decorated. I strolled along this road during lunar year celebration in February, and along the orchard road i saw lots of decoration in red related to galloping horses (as this is the year of horse in lunar year).

what made me curious to know about this orchard road was not the shopping malls, but rather the one dollar ice cream my friend had told me about. At one corner of the road you would find an unusual view where an old couple sell Walls ice cream for only one dollar. it's certainly the cheapest product you can buy along this expensive orchard road. The ice cream stall is always ended up with a long queue of people from around the globe. i remembered standing in the queue among americans, indians, arabians, and Singaporeans. when it was approaching my turn to the seller, I was surprised that they did not even speak a word of English language, and they shouted in their language when they meant to say that they did not have the flavour my friend wanted. Learning from this situation, I was in a rush changing my mind for another flavour before i came to my turn. I got my blueberry without any shout. I believe they shouted because they had hearing problem instead of getting mad for no reason.

Never miss your camera to take some more pictures. i did not use my camera so often in this road but prefer watching the passers by, enjoying watching birds flying lower to the ground wishing to grab some leftovers, listening to the rhythm of the city abuzz with speeding cars, pedestrians and the music accompanying a juggler performing his dexterity with sticks. They all made my day.

This is certainly a place not to be missed and try to find the ice cream stall right in front of the watch store i forgot its name.

Orchard road is more than just an array of shopping malls."
,,shop and enjoy,5.0,,This road looks amazing during Christmas season because of decoration. Weather is always nice to walk. Malls are stretched over a long distance. Good for shopping for branded items especially.
,,Shopping!!!,5.0,,"Never thought it was possible for me to get shopped out, but orchard road will do it! The whole road is full of different shopping malls! was fantastic!"
,,Only worth a look if you have lots of money!!,3.0,,"SHOPS, SHOPS, SHOPS!! Yes, this street is full of shopping malls... BUT, only go here if you are looking for designer labels. We bypassed most shops as they are shops I would never waste my money in. We looked through almost every mall and there was a lot of crap, or the same shops just repeated mall after mall...

If you want to check out just one mall, save you're time and only go to Ion Orchard if you are looking for clothes. It had the best variety.

Shopping is much better in Australia in my opinion."
,,I have never seen so many shopping malls in one place!,3.0,,"Orchard Road appears to go on for miles and miles with dozens of shopping malls (each at least 3-4 storeys high) lined up side by side. It's a very funky street too and when we went they had really cool Valentines Day displays set up; I liked the other various statues and water features they had spread out around the place too. The shopping for me wasn't the best despite the massive array of shops to chose from, only because I prefer market stalls over the designer fashion boutiques of which occupy Orchard Road. This place is great for those shopping addicts with money to burn."
,,Plenty of shops,5.0,,"If you like shopping, this is the place - it's huge! With plenty of shops to choose from, all at different price brands"
,,Great if you're into designer fashion?,3.0,,"I know it's a Singaporean icon, but we were a little bored. The Orchard Road retail strip goes for about 3km, where there are lots of shiny shop-fronts selling high end designer fashion. It has a lot of repetitive brands too, so I'm not quite sure how they all stay in business! We walked along about 1km of it between 2 subway stations, and that was enough for my wife and I. If you want to get the vibe of the street as a tourist and don't really intend to shop, you can probably just take it in from one of the hop-on-hop-off buses."
,,Shopping was great,4.0,,"It was busy but not too over-crowed, lots of shopping centre with lots of shops, if you love designer shopping you should go, but don’t expect to get any bargains, the price for most things were reasonably comparable to most parts of the world. It would be more inconvenient if the shopping centres close later, i.e. till at least mid-night so you get enough time to get out if you get lost in there!"
,,sparkling street....,5.0,,this is an amazing street which is an absolute must see while in singapore.the walking through it is a treat in itself coz when v went there at the year end it was very well lit n decorated.the whole place was glittering.but its true that almost all the malls n showrooms there r extremely high end n out of reach of the tourists.but going there n having the feel of it is a must.believe me u will not find such a beautiful street anywhere else.....
,,didn't like it,2.0,,"When I read about this street it souned like a dream comes true, but walking around was borring - all the mall have more or less the same brands and they al very expensive. We felt that it was a bed way to spend time as tourists when there are so many other atractions to visit."
,,High end shopping,4.0,,"Worth a look,but be prepared,most shopping is very high end,expensive,lots of atmosphere,good for people watching,lots of good eateries in the food courts and hawker stands,most food courts are found
On the lower floors of the malls,this road is also on the hop on hop off routes which gives you good access,well served by mrt network also"
,,Don't take your credit card with you,5.0,,"Orchard Rd is of course one of the ""must sees"" in Singapore, it's most famous street there. If you think that you can explode your budget in one mall, then imagine what would happen when you have huge (luxury) malls one after another. I took cash only,because I knew what would happen with Credit Card :) Prices are expensive in many shops, even in European standards. I bought Hugo Boss shirts almost half price from Changi Airport."
,,Designer Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"Although not intending to shop, I thought you couldn't go to Singapore and not go to Orchard Road. Every designer you could possibly imagine is there. The footpaths were beautifully decorated with blossums and flower displays for Chinese New Year. These were more of a highlight for me than the shops. Lots of malls to walk endlessly through and get lost in. Shopping in general was quite expensive compared to Australia."
,,Worth seeing - can get overbearing,4.0,,"As a spectacle, or if you love shopping, then quite impressive.

Quieter in the morning. Zillions of people in the evening. It is impressive (including the occasional super-car zapping along Orchard Road) but can get a bit overbearing after a while.

Take a couple of hours to visit. Experience it and then escape."
,,Boring.,2.0,,"Visited this area in 2008, 2011 and 2013. Repetition of every shop known to man. Every item on this capitalist-island is expensive. 85% of the so-called shoppers who frequent this road are nothing but a bunch of snobs. Bars & restaurants serve the same food over and over again. Overrated Tiger Beer that one can get much cheaper just across the border.

On a positive note, no rude drivers around and best ice-cream parlour in the region located here (Cold Stone Creamery)."
,,Best Shopping and Food!,5.0,,"If you want to SHOP, this is the place to go...you'll find everything on Orchard Road. Mall after mall after mall after mall...you get the point.

Most malls have the same stores. It's a nice walk after dinner or lunch--you can also find great restaurants here like Tatsuya (Japanese), or Mezza9 (International) <-- our top 2 favorite restaurants in Singapore.

For shopping sake, you don't really need to go to The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, because Orchard Road has many more options and you'll be able to visit them all."
,,shoppers paradise,5.0,,"A visit to singapore is incomplete without going to Orchard Road, its a shoppers zone, the big magnificent malls, where one can do endless shopping for days. The food court here serves super multi cuisine, ice creams etc. The Takasima mall is one of the best. A place for all age lovers."
,,If you like shopping then enjoy,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore and you want to do a little shopping then Orchard road is the place!!. Like a giant London Oxford Street but much more noisy!!!. Shops, shops and more shops plus places to stop and eat etc. Top designers shops, large department stores, small boutique, it has everything. Of course if you hate shopping then avoid big time, there is nothing else on this street!!!!!. Lively and colourful especially at xmas & Chinese New Year, splash the cash and enjoy but remember your luggage allowance for your home flight!!!."
,,Of course you must see this once,4.0,,"Obviously you must see (walk) this iconic Singapore street at least once. But beware, it's way overpriced if you don't watch out. Also you will find a lot of japanese business along the road, including some very good japanese restaurants. The atmosphere is luxurious as expected"
,,nothing to buy,3.0,,"for me as a budget tourist, this place so expensive. i just spend my 3.5$ for buying garret popcorn. hahaha. just looking around and get some photos. nothing special."
,,Main attraction in singapore,4.0,,"When you are in Singapore, you go to orchard. As simple as that. Mostly tourist, the road is full of shopping malls. You can spend the whole week in Singapore, and still wont be able to finish all stores in here. The street decoration is amazing too...!"
,,Shoppers paradise!,5.0,,"Absolutely spoilt for choice here! So many shopping malls, restaurants, and big name brands! Worthwhile even for a good dose of window shopping. Lots of food courts for good value meals. Easy to catch a Taxi anywhere along this street."
,,Shopping and Eating All in One Street,4.0,,"If you're in Singapore to do shopping and eating, then by all means, this is a good one stop place to do it. It's a whole street of different shopping malls/buildlings, and provides a good range of stores and restaurants. Most flagship stores are located here. There are of course other big malls that have emerged like Vivo Mall near the water and many malls emerging in the surburbs, but walking along Orchard Road is by itself a very interesting thing to do, even if you're just window shopping. During Christmas Holidays, the street is lighted up and an evening walk is very pleasant. Sometimes, there are street performances too. Your visit to Singapore won't be complete without a visit here.

There's literally loads of places to eat here, you can't really go through them in one visit. We loved the basement floor of Takashimaya for some good Japanese and Korean food. There's now a small hawker centre near the Concorde Hotel. There's Food Republic, the popular food court chain that offers a whole selection of local and non-local food on a budget. And of course, there's also the more upscale popular restaurants like Marche, Chatterbox in Mandarin Hotel, Ipuddo Ramen, and Soup Restaurant. We also had late lunch at Tim Ho Wan in Plaza Singapura, which is a Hong-Kong based dim sum place, line was long as usual.

So basically, everything you need to shop and eat, you'll find in Orchard Road, thus making it a convenient place to stay. Hotels are generally expensive here. But if you prefer cheaper hotels, pick one from one of the side roads nearby."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Say goodbye to the wife and go for a beer, Let the ladies loose here and you will have a free day or more to yourself, every sort of shop you can think of and more, rather overwhelming for the average guy, you can tell they all stand in the shop doorways under the air conditioning looking like trees with their arms held out to catch the cool air."
,,A very long shopping center,4.0,,Shopping centers and shops are all long the road from both sides. Most of big brand names got shops at the road. It's a main Singaporean attraction.
,,IF YOU LIKE SHOPPING THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO,5.0,,Now I love shopping but this was overwhelming. It has every single store you can think of x 10 plus extras ones in abundance. I got fed up with it after three hours went back to the hotel and I have a sneaky feeling my husband was rather pleased! Everywhere clean and plenty of place to eat and drink and grab a taxi.
,,Singapore main shopping street,4.0,,You can spend the whole day going from shop to shop along this well maintained leafy and very busy street. The road is interwoven with quality hotels and top brand designer store and eateries. A stroll up some of the side streets away from the crowds is very worth while
,,Mall after mall after mall,3.0,,"Great if you like shopping, although just choose a small section as all the shops are repeated in different malls along the street."
,,Heaps of shops,4.0,,A nice place to spend window shopping. The $1 ice creams are always popular. The place is very colourful and clean with good footpaths & lots of shopping malls to go in to.
,,lots of shops,5.0,,"just like oxford street in london, very pretty near christmas with all the lights and trees, lots of street traders makes it more fun!"
,,Great shopping with heavy discounts before xmas,5.0,,"This is the Oxford street of Singapore, surely more crowded and modern. Shopaholics will love especially that there are affordable hotels next to Orchard Rd. All way safe at night, branded clothes at reasonable discounted prices. Not to miss the foam party on xmas eve..its just awesome and so far it was my best xmas eve when being out of town."
,,Shopping shopping shopping,5.0,,"Orchard road is a lot of fun. There is a huge variety of shopping and lovely eating places. It is easy to get about in the cool air conditioning by using the underground connecting walkways. The maps are confusing though! The shops open late-maybe 11 in the morning, but they stay open late too, so evening shopping can be an option."
,,Unbelievable shopping,5.0,,"On any trip to Singapore you must go to orchard road. It's some of the best shopping in the world all in one street.
Great mall after mall with shopping from cheap and nasty to the highest end possible with all the brands lined up one after another.
And no matter how much you enjoy shopping you will have to take a rest and put your feet up.
A good couple of days to get through all the shops.
If your not a shopper then people watching is great with people from all over the world"
,,Shopping Anybody?,3.0,,"I don't care how much of a shopaholic you may be, there is no way you can go through all of these malls before wanting to run away from Orchard Road.

The shops are great, but each complex has the same shops as the last complex you just walked through and other then shopping there isn't much else to do.

If you want to shop, head to orchard road and go crazy. Just remember to take your walking shoes with you! It's boutique shopping at its best."
,,Amazing,5.0,,Great place for people who can walk for hours. U may get tired but the amount of shops in this place will not run out. U can find smaller market places and also all the big brand outlets. Definitely worth checking out.
,,Everything you need ( and don't need ),5.0,,"Obviously the highlight for the shopOholics amongst us and easy to suffer a relapse if you are a recovering one...

All you could ever seek or not in one massive accumulation of malls

Nothing more to say really, all the malls are very nicely done and obviously differ in the target audience, so excellent for what it is !

In my opinion not really a true attraction, but to many it seems the main one ;-)"
,,Shop 'til you drop!,4.0,,"Orchard Rd, as the name suggests, used to be an area in Singapore where fruit trees grew. Now I guess the only growth will be in shoppers' credit card bills! It was a few weeks before Christmas when we visited so the road was decorated along with the shops and at night time it looked amazing. It can get busy as you would expect but there's plenty of room but one word of warning...if you use the underpasses to cross a road, make sure you follow the right exit! There is every conceivable shop on Orchard Road and I lost count of the number of shopping malls. It's good for photo opportunities if you want to try and impress your friends with pictures of you in front of some of the designer wear shops.
Some of the architecture is worth a closer look and there are plenty of places to eat. If you venture down the underpasses, you will find still more shops and restaurants.
I think it's better in the evening when it's cooler but be prepared for credit card pain!"
,,"Good and bad, depend on your view",3.0,,"Good: the trotoir is wide, cool under trees, good to take a picture, meet a lot of people from different culture, love one dollar ice cream ;) and. .....kinokuniya book shop Not good: expensive shops, crowded"
,,Haven for Singapore's Wealthy,3.0,,"This area definitely reminds you where you rank in the class stratification hierarchy, and highlights the huge problematic gap between the wealthy and less well-off or poor here in Singapore."
,,Shopping malls,4.0,,"Orchard Road is all about shopping with mall after mall after mall... it is a shoppers paradise. We used the MRT to get there and started at Orchard Road station and then walked down the very busy road.

As we visited over the Christmas period there are lots of decorations so it's worth taking a camera. It can also get very crowded so we ended up spending a whole day there.

In terms if shops there are a lot of high end brands which I think are expensive compared to the UK. However there are some bargains to be picked up. There are lots of restaurants/snacks and ice cream places."
,,"Wow, what alot of Shops",4.0,,"We were dropped off at one end of Orchard Road by the Miramar Hotel free shuttle bus, we made our own way back along Kilkenny Road back to the hotel using a map the hotel tour desk had provided us with.
Orchard Road, wow all those shops, its a bright vibrant place to visit. Do take a camera, there are lots of photo opportunities and of course take some water. Shops for all budgets, from Lucky Plaza which houses lots of gift ideas from Singapore, to high end fashion houses like the Paragon Mall.
We walked virtually from one end down the road and back up the other side, to Kilkenny Road, visiting most of the Malls. The air conditioning is great and a welcome cool blast from the relentless sun and humidity. Even if window shopping this is a great place to wander along the road and just people watch and amaze at the items on sale, from life size Father Christmas' to keyrings . As we visited in December of course, there were lots of Christmas decorations. Along Orchard Road itself, there were blue pearl drops hanging across the road and outside most Malls a Christmas display could be seen of some sort or other. There are also plenty of cafe's, ice cream parlours for that welcome pit stop and of course Restaurants/Bars.
We noticed especially around lunchtime it was crowded with people, maybe also workers on lunch break and quite a lot of construction work going on in some areas of Orchard Road.
Apparently the flagship store is Robinsons, unfortunately when we visited it was VIP day and closed to non-ticket holders, so we couldn't enter the store.
We spent a full-day exploring Orchard Road, but you can make your visit as long or as short as you wish."
,,If Designer Shopping Is Your Thing,3.0,,"If you go to Singapore then a visit to Orchard Road is one of those things you have to do. And, if money is no object and you have a fancy for the exclusive brands and shops then you will not be disappointed. Every named brand you can think of is represented in this shopping strip. The street has a reasonable amount of construction work taking place at the moment and this obviously distracts from the experience. For big named brands, people people people and that shop to you drop feeling then pay a visit. For me the train leaving Orchard Road was the best part."
,,"It goes on forever, up and down",3.0,,"It's like going through a maze. There's something more and interesting around every corner.

So many shops on so many levels, or so many standards. It's not all about Lucky Plaza, in fact, ignore that one and just enjoy the rest. ION was excellent as example.

The street was lite up for Christmas, and created a wonderous atmosphere.

Shop, browse, walk, enjoy. It's a must visit when in Singapore"
,,Great variety of shops and restaurants,5.0,,"Whether you just want to ' window shop' at the extreme high end of the market, or pop into M& S, Orchard road has it all! Lots of beautiful air conditioned malls, in which to escape the humidity and heat often city."
,,Lots of people... And construction!,3.0,,"Lots and lots of opportunities for shopping but not so much in the morning around 10am! However, it is completely different at night where the streets are extremely crowded!"
,,Busy,3.0,,Busy place that will be enjoyed by those who like to shop. Wonderful road to walk and shop. Enjoyed taking pictures in this busy area.
,,Malls+people+food=Singapore!,5.0,,"This is the busiest area of Singapore! Especially during Christmas time with all the sales happening! There is so much to buy, see, and eat which is what Singaporeans do best! it is very crowded so you have to be prepared to bump into people and walking with the traffic around you. It's a little bit like driving - you have to maneuver your body around the slow-walking groups of families and youngsters and try to get into the fast lane if you're trying to get somewhere. If you're just hanging out with your own family or friends, it's a fun time just to walk around leisurely. Definitely a must visit to see all the Christmas decorations this time of year!"
,,Shopping Mecca and was all light up,5.0,,Went during Christmas and it was absolutly magical. Primarily you would go there for shopping. The eating places are good as well
,,Lots of People and Shops - Bewildering,3.0,,"My wife and I spent the best part of a day wandering through the shopping malls along Orchard Road. Simply awesome and bewildering. Lots of choice from designer labels to discount lines, so if you had a particular requirement, then you should be able to find it. There are plenty of options for a casual meal or a drink. Most of the shops were crowded. Maintaining your bearings was a challenge through the vast array of shops and arcades."
,,soooo crowded,2.0,,"The place was too crowded, it was very hard to navigate around the swarms of the people. especially on the weekend or after office hours, it was like all hell broke loose."
,,Gerald Kong Salon,5.0,,"Tucked away in the the Hilton Hotel is this quiet salon with possibly the most talented stylist I've ever known! Mervyn does an amazing cut and color! This salon is a jewel on Orchard! Do some shopping, stop in for appointment then happy hour! The salon prices are average, the service is 5 Star!"
,,Shopping Haven,5.0,,"Love shopping in Orchard Road, find everything you need there. They cater for everyone in the family from food to manicure & pedicure. The hustle and bustle there is so alive."
,,Shoppers' paradise,5.0,,"What a place! 2.2 kilometres of shopping arcades, hotels and entertainment venues - Orchard Road has it all! It is modern, fast paced, vibrant and alive. To me it has a special atmosphere in the early evening when the lights and big screen TVs add another element to the constant buzz of people out shopping or for a meal or drink with family and friends. I have been here numerous times and it never fails to impress me.

Orchard Road is home to high end fashion, watch, jewellery outlets. The shopping arcades range from conglomerates of small outlets selling souveniers and specialty products to high end arcades with big brand outlets. There is a myriad of underground arcades, food halls and underpasses which connect different arcades and allow pedestrian to transit the busy roads in the area. Lucky Plaza is a great place to shop for camera, gaming and other small electrical equipment. 313 Somerset is one of my favourite shopping arcades and houses a newly refurbished Food Republic food hall which is a great place to grab a bite to eat while out and about.

At the Tanglin Road end of Orchard Road there is a small entertainment precinct with restaurants such as Black Angus steakhouse and bars such as Muddy Murphy's Irish Bar - both of which I recommend.

Orchard Road is serviced by the rail (MRT) and bus systems and there are numerous taxi bays from which people are constantly ferried to and from the area so getting there and back is not a problem.

I have always found shop assistants to be friendly, courteous and knowledgable.

Orchard Road is a must see when visiting Singapore."
,,If you have money to burn,4.0,,"This is the destination if you really want to splurge in Singapore - huge malls right beside each other , all containing popular names in fashion, luxury and everything in between. Orchard Road is easily accessible by MRT. You can start at Somerset and walk your way down or get off at Orchard Station and be right in the middle of the action at ION Orchard mall.

Yes, it is expensive here so accommodation is definitely cheaper elsewhere. But mealtimes aren't a problem budget-wise since there are food courts below Paragon, ION, Ngee Ann, Wisma Atria and of course, Lucky Plaza that offer pocket-friendly meals. So don't fret if you get caught here at lunchtime. There's even a small hawker center located beside a hotel whose name escapes me right now.

If you're looking for ubiquitous souvenir items like magnets, T-shirts and other cheap stuff, Lucky Plaza can provide you with those but you might find better variety and maybe better prices at Bugis Junction or the stalls around Chinatown."
,,THE shopping destination,4.0,,"If you're not all mall-ed out from the rest of Singapore, then Orchard Road is the destination for you. It's malls on malls on mall - literally. You can pass through multiple malls underground and not even notice. They cleverly design the space such that you can really only go outside for air for a few moments, and the only way to get from one mall to another is by going underground (no crosswalks). Plenty of shopping, and in the winter there are nice christmas lights at night. Architecture and opulence can be found in abundance, but there are some ""shadier"" malls towards one end. If you need to shop while in Singapore, you can get it done all in one go at Orchard."
,,Sort of interesting,3.0,,"Quite a nice road with all the decorations at the moment, but overall not sure what the fuss is about. Expensive shops with lots of levels. Overall there are many more interesting things to see in Singapore than this shopping strip."
,,Christmas lights !,4.0,,"The last time i had been to this road was during the day time - with all the malls lined up and i chose a few of them to take a look. But this time on my friends recommendations - took off during the night and was elated to see such a beautiful light arrangement on the entire road for christmas. Excellent decorations !! Christmas trees have been lined up outside and inside every mall and the whole sight is very pleasing. The place looks very lively and active during the night.
Recommended !"
,,Shopping & Dinning,4.0,,"It's a must see area, biggest shopping and dinning area in Singapore, shopping is expensive unless your selective. Lucky Plaza is a locals shopping mall and reasonable, Far East Mall is just a short walk off Orchard and is also a locals mall. Great dinning but again you will need to be selective if price is a factor. At Christmas it is lights everywhere and quite impressive. Fun to roam around and window shop."
,,Nice Christmas Decoration,4.0,,"Love the Christmas ambiance in Orchard always! This year consider not bad, however, the most unforgettable was the candy house theme..."
,,Jummah mosque,5.0,,For those who are around orchard road on Friday jummah prayers there In this area with big mosque Near the shopping complexes You may ask some for directions It's walking distance to lucky plaza paragon
,,Bring lots of Money,5.0,,"It seems like there is an LV, Chanel and Tiffany in every mall along Orchard Road. It's a nice place to spend an afternoon."
,,Busy shopping areas,4.0,,"It's a shopping areas with high quality and branded dress, there are several hotels beside so that you can stay and shopping. During this December, it will glow brightly when Christmas day."
,,Gotta see it,4.0,,"The prices are high, but it is one of those places that you just have to see if you're in Singapore. This is truly a mecca of consumption. Multiple locations of every high end retailer on Earth."
,,Expensive Road..,5.0,,"In every step, there is a mall on the road. Most of the store are high-end-luxury stores. Orchard Road inSingapore is like Fifth Avenue in NYC."
,,Choose the time of your visit and know your prices!,4.0,,"I guess that this is THE place to head to for shopping, particularly if you're into the designer heavyweights.

Avoid Sundays like bubonic plague. Maids, housekeepers and labourers generally have their weekly day off on Sundays so Orchard Road is absolutely rammed with people. Go on a weekday but be aware that it starts getting major busy after 1800 hours as people head there after finishing work.

If you think you're likely to be tempted with the delights on offer, do a bit of research before going shopping. Mulberry products are significantly cheaper in the UK as are Christian Louboutin shoes (even after getting your tax back at the airport). Montblanc is on par with the UK. Apple products are cheaper than the UK but on par-ish with Australia. Didn't bother looking in Louis Vuitton as I think that pattern is absolutely hideous. Urgh! Most Oakley sunglasses are double (seriously!) what you'd pay in the UK so give them a wide berth.

Plenty of places to eat and drink too, so not a bad day out."
,,A little too noisy for my liking,3.0,,"A fantastic place to window shop and catch a glimpse of the Christmas decorations but otherwise a little too crowded for my liking. There were crowds of people everywhere and trying to get a seat for dinner was also a challenge with long queues almost everywhere. Strangely enough, some restaurants refused to take reservations.
It's best to visit early in the mornings to early afternoons."
,,Great Atmosphere,4.0,,"It is undoubtedly a great place to be. It's all lit up in the evenings. Mostly for shoppers but people roam around leisurely. The high end shops are very fascinating. Most of the top notch brands are here. A few local vendors are also here if you have a shopping budget.
Love the spirited atmosphere that is present,"
,,never ending road,4.0,,"i never find it boring to explore this street. yet alone, with my best pal, or with my sisters and nieces--it's always fascinating to spend hours walking and sight-seeing. me myself, is not a shopper,but i love watching all the shops, street vendors, and the shoppers, while i enjoy 1$ ice cream and take pictures. night or day, orchard road has its own appeal."
,,Good to Visit,4.0,,"More spectacular at night, but crowded. If you want to avoid crowd go during daytime (keeping in mind a lot of places do not open before 10am)"
,,Singapore's- and one of the world's- great shopping precincts; accessible by MRT,5.0,,"If you like shopping, you will love Orchard Road. It is one of the world's great shopping precincts- with shopping centers ranging from the sophisticated and elegant, through to old fashioned bargain shops.

To explore everything on offer, you would need a full day- possibly even longer.

There are several hotels in the area and nearby. If you're staying elsewhere, there is an MRT station in the heart of Orchard Road.

New visitors and those who gave not visited for several years should note that the pedestrian crossings at the Scott's Road - Orchard Road intersection are now underground- if you're at street level, you need to look for the signs and have a clear idea where you want to go.

Besides the wide range of shops, there are hundreds of dining opportunities- from snacks to gourmet meals.

Tips:

1. If you're going by taxi, make sure you locate a cab rank for your return journey- these are not located on Orchard Road, and it would be literally impossible to hail a cab at peak times. Ranks are located in Scott's Road and at the rear of several shopping centers- be prepared to queue! Using the MRT may be quicker.

2. The MRT station in the basement of the ION Orchard shopping center- at the Scotts Road intersection.

3. Tang's Department Store is a good mid-market shop offering a wide range of department store lines. They have renovated the store recently, giving it a fresh look.

4. For anyone interested in English apparel, Marks and Spencer have several stores in Orchard Road, and these have small but useful food and wine shops offering a selection of their English lines.

5. Takashimaya is a large upper level department store. They have a ""Talking Hall"" in the basement where they offer a lot of bargains- you never know what you'll find! Also, in their basement, there's a Cold Storage supermarket and a food hall, where they offer Harrods groceries.

6. Kinokuniya is a vast bookshop in the Takashimaya Shopping Center.

7. Lucky Plaza is the bargain center.

8. Stroll down Scotts Road to Far East Plaza for the ""olde"" Singapore shopping experience.

9. If you love shopping, also consider visiting the shopping center at Marina Bay, next to the Casino- also accessible by MRT.

10. ION is worth a visit to see the sheer size of the center.

Good luck finding bargains!"

BY WOO SIAN BOON
18 NOVEMBER(PAGE 1 OF 3)
SINGAPORE — The dengue situation in the Republic’s prime shopping belt shows few signs of abating, as the number of infected people continued to inch up. As of last Friday, there were 86 cases in Orchard Road and its surrounding area, making the vicinity the second-largest dengue cluster.

The authorities had identified the Orchard Gateway construction site near 313@Somerset as the source of the dengue outbreak in the area.

In response to TODAY’s queries, a National Environment Agency (NEA) spokesperson noted that 53 of the cases were workers at the construction site, most of whom were infected in the earlier part of the outbreak. It added that the more recent cases linked to this site were “people working or living in the vicinity”. At the nearby Devonshire cluster, seven of the 10 cases were construction site workers and the remaining three were residents.

A check by TODAY over the weekend found that there were hardly any public education efforts in the area — in contrast to the extensive anti-dengue campaign in residential estates, which includes putting up banners or posters and distributing pamphlets.

Most tourists TODAY spoke to had no idea there was a dengue outbreak. However, employers had instructed service staff — some of whom had witnessed colleagues being struck down by the disease — to take precautions.

A Chinese tourist, who wished to be known only as Ms Yan, said: “Looking at the number of people walking around, the situation doesn’t look very serious.”

At Orchard Central, pushcart stall assistant Ng Xiaohui, 21, has taken to wearing long sleeves and carrying a bottle of insect repellent to work. She said: “We only started becoming more cautious about two weeks ago, when a colleague came down with high fever. We suspected it was dengue fever.”

The shopping centre’s concierge, Mr Limbu, 28, said its management has engaged a company to conduct weekly pest-control. Mosquito patches and insect repellent have also been distributed to the staff.

The Orchard Road cluster is bounded by *SCAPE Youth Park and *SCAPE Skate Park, extending south to include Chatsworth International School and shopping centres such as 313@Somerset and The Centrepoint.

Senior Minister of State (Education and Law) Indranee Rajah, who is the Member of Parliament for the area, said the River Valley Neighbourhood Committee had also identified the area around Eber Road, Dublin Road and Oxley Rise as potential risk areas as there were several dengue cases there. Door-to-door outreach to homes and shophouses was conducted on Oct 26.

On the lack of public education efforts in the commercial areas, Ms Indranee said the NEA is working with the relevant parties. She said: “The most important thing was to make sure that there’s no water ponding, to clear up all the waterlogged areas and … making sure that people don’t leave stagnant water around.”

She added: “It’ll be a little bit strange standing in the middle of Orchard Road giving out flyers. And it’s not all hours of the day when the mosquitos will bite.” Aedes mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn. The original article stated that Aedes mosquitoes are most active at night between dusk and dawn. This is incorrect. Aedes mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. This article was edited at 6:06pm on Nov 18.

The NEA spokesperson said the agency has “intensified its inspections in the Orchard Road area, as well as a wider zone around it”. “All buildings ... as well as construction sites are being checked. The NEA will also continue with the use of insecticides through fogging and misting to kill infected mosquitoes,” she said.

In all, there were 358 new dengue infection cases last week, as at 3.30pm last Friday. This brings the total number of reported cases here to 19,501. Currently, the largest cluster is in the Bedok area, which has 155 cases."
,,Great for shopping and people watching!,4.0,,"Always busy, but clean. A microcosm of Singapore. Try and stay in the shade as much as you can, because it can get really hot during the day. You will shop till you drop, especially during The Great Singapore Sale. Buy ice cream in a cup from the guys selling it from a rickshaw, then pick a spot and just sit back and watch people go by. There's lots to see people wise. Try and figure out where people are from, whether they're local Singaporean, nouveau rich from China, expats from the West, or transplanted Malaysians. If it gets unbearable, head inside where the a/c is always on, and there're myriad food courts selling all the usual local favorites."
,,Short trip is enough if you're not shopping,3.0,,"It's filled with huge expensive malls, there are some cheap ones too. The walk outside is cool. It's somewhat calming, some statues are replaced every few months making good photo spots and there are events here sometimes too. Go do your homework and come at that time.
Beware : I read some reviews you better hold back shopping electronics here. Some of the qualities are bad and the price scams are everywhere"
,,it was wonderful,5.0,,"if you love shopping then this is your heaven, large amount of shops and malls line next to each other, coffee shops and restaurants too. love walking there every morning and having breakfast. though going underground u can get lost for bit."
,,Do research before you travel,4.0,,"At the moment along Orchard Road they have a large amount of building work going on in the subway underpasses under the street. This can cause confusion and trust me I got lost. The street is great a lot of shopping malls, with a great variety of shops and restaurants so it is not all high end expensive shopping.

Singapore is amazingly clean and Orchard Road is no different. Would recommend taking a few bottles of water with you as it does get very hot & humid walking around. Shops have air-con but this dries you out as well after a while."
,,Cool yet a bit boring,4.0,,"This road was full of malls. I honestly say the malls were also huge and awesome... but again... malls malls everywhere... I find it's kinda boring... I don't know.... maybe it's because I'm not so shopaholics person...

nice things about this road were it's highest rated of cleanness.. the people around were so fashionable. .. malls building were stand out. And... ya whatever things u wish exist in the city larr.."
,,Shopaholic's Paradise,5.0,,"If you love to shop, you'll definitely love Orchard Road! The whole stretch boasts an array of malls that houses all the retail brands you can ever imagine. It's so huge, you wouldn't know where to start!"
,,Shopping & Dining Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a 2.2km long boulevard that is the retail and entertainment hub of Singapore. It is a major tourist attraction, in addition to being the most popular shopping enclave in Singapore.
ION Orchard, Knightsbridge, H&M, Orchard Central, 313@Somerset, Tanglin Shopping Centre, Wisma Atria, Takashimaya, Apsara Antiques & Arts, Robinsons, Isetan, Centre Point, to name a few shopping & dinning destinations. We have a good food at ‘Shiraz’, a small road side food joint that serves delicious veg and non-veg dishes. Cold Stone is a unique Ice Cream joint where they roll ice creams on a cold stone."
,,A Very Clean and Fun City!,5.0,,"Orchard Road has it all: Both high end and low end shopping and everything in between. Whether it's department stores, designer specific, or local shops, you can find it here. Plenty of good dining choices, and awesome clubs for the night life! There's Strumms in Lucky Plaza and you single guys can always find someone to accompany you at Orchard Towers. Excellent hotels all up and down the strip. This is a very clean and polite city. You could probably eat off the sidewalks. But just like any other busy place, watch out for pickpockets. Carry your purse zipped up and in front of you and don't have a wallet in your back pocket. The subway system is the best!"
,,Great to shop in SG,4.0,,Lots of variety to shop from and lots of very good cafes and restaurants if you need a break. World class and concentrated conveniently on one road. Popular with locals and tourists. At least a day if you have limited time.
,,Good area to stay,4.0,,"If you coming to Singapore for the first time this is the best area to stay it has many hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and metro station every 200m along the Orchard street."
,,Streets of MALL,5.0,,"If one of all these things mentioned stands out and is on every ones lips that visit Singapore or that matter the locals it would be the mega shopping strip that has the whole of Asia in envy.Orchard road has been the heart beat of Singapore for many years and reasons it is a multimillion/multibillion dollar marketing extravaganza that is famous for its shopping.Wheather it be fashion,food,jewelry,or anything in between Orchard road has it all."
,,Everything you need on one road,5.0,,"This road has almost anything you want to buy! Shopping malls, expensive designer brands, restaurants, coffee shops, cinemas (including IMAX), small local shops, cold stores, metro station, etc. You can find Starbucks & McDonalds every 200m!

Shops are located on both sides of the road and there are pedestrian overpasses and underpasses.

I stayed in a hotel at one the very end of the road and I was able to walk on both sides of the street at day and night. Its a safe place to walk at night and see all the lights and big screens showing nonstop ads. I have also spotted other hotels very close to the road (you can search on the map and locate them).

If you like to take photographs of city life at night then its a good destination for you just to walk and capture even if you don't want to shop."
,,World Class Shopping,4.0,,"Singapore's Orchard Road has a stretch of road that consists of mall after mall after mall, with a hotel or two scattered throughout. It really is exciting to get lost in the underground tunnels that connect the malls and cross the streets. You can find so many different brands there. The one downside might be the large crowds, but that's easy enough to get over."
,,The Place To Shop In Singapore!,5.0,,"While there are many venues to shop in Singapore (VivoCity, Bugis Village, City Square, Marina Square, Raffles City, CentrePoint, etc..), Orchard Road is still Singapore's premier shopping destination! If you are determined, you can find bargains. I remember going into one of the ""locals"" shopping centers off Orchard Road (Lucky Plaza) and it had many clothing shops where I could get shirts for like 10-15 dollars. Also, don't be afraid of the big department stores...one time I went into Takeshimaya Dept. Store and they were having a big sale. I managed to score some Lacoste sneakers for under 40 dollars."
,,Just 1 shopping centre after another,4.0,,"We stayed near orchard road @ Quincy. Orchard rd is a long strip of shops. Most are high end expensive but there are a few centres dotted along that you find items at a reasonable price. Lucky Plaza is so busy on a Sunday (local hangout for Filipinos on their day off) but you can find souvenirs here & a cheap & varied food court on basement, beware electronics here though. Food Republic at Wisma Atria is awesome!! Plaza Singapura (very end if Orchard Road) is excellent too. Cineplex at Shaw House good too. Very clean, pretty street to wander down, shop, window shop, eat, drink... must do thus when visiting Singapore."
,,Orchard road,3.0,,"Just another shopping strip.very clean and plenty of high end shops. if you miss it do not worry. If it wasn't for the history (W.W.2) you would not even rate it as a vist site. This is a personal reflection on the road, I personally do not go overseas to shop. So if you are not a shopper, you have not misse much"
,,Endless materialism in the most sanitized venue,4.0,,"Not much into shopping so I sat in a local drinking establishment while my wife and daughter enjoyed themselves. Not sure who spent more, me with $15 Tigers or the girls with bags of goodies I dared not look at the receipts. Lots of energy on the street and in the stores and in the bars and cafes. A little something for everyone."
,,One day is NOT enough for Shopping here !,4.0,,"Tons of department stores on this street... both sides. Enjoy shopping for your favorite things eg. street-wear, luxury products, brand name, sports wear, food, books, toys and much more. All department stores have food court to stop by for eating & relaxing."
,,Seemingly endless parade of upmarket designer shops - but impressive nonetheless.....,3.0,,"This is possibly the most impressive shopping streets I can remember visiting. It certainly knocks the likes of Oxford Street into a cocked hat. An endless parade of very upmarket shops - Jewelers, clothing etc etc as well as other more normal outlets such as Marks and Spencers and endless Malls with all manner of outlets in them.
We visited at night and it is a very impressive sight.
They do play a typical trick - to get across a road you have to use the underpass - which forms part of a mall - and it's never properly signposted so one gets disorientated and and up traipsing around the Mall which is v frustrating.
Plenty of places to stop and eat.
When a shop like Louis Vuitton & Giorgio Armani start to become commonplace they start to lose that ""Special"" status and after 30 mins or so we began to tire of the endless parade of ""exclusive"" upmarket outlets - but people who like shopping will love this !"
,,Endless shopping day or night in a very busy city that does north sleep,5.0,,"Luckily, my hotel allows me to walk down this endless mall location via bridge, tunnel basement via excavator down or to cross the street to the lucky plaza where bargain souvenirs or exchange money's at a bargain basement. Of coupes em Chinatown can also have a varied souvenir hunting and foods to the hawker center site where locals cans still enjoy the best of the best foods at a bargain. The ion mall beehives look can be had day or night and closed at 1030 pm for my daily satay fixed at level 4 B decisions. Decisions for tons of food choices longing for more as each night approach providing one is on foot and does not venture well into the night going solo, however I din make note options for 24/7 places that are open and Lebanese option can also be had in seemingly endless shopping to include Isetan which is a japanese brand of the huge mall.
Shop till you drop, literary,
Cheers!"
,,Busy busy,4.0,,"Hustle bustle busy and exciting! Get a buzz! Lots of fab shops! But you need lotsa money! Takashimaya is my favourite, a great Japanese store, but a word of warning, if you are like me, getting old, you need to sit down a lot during your visit to this very long shopping road!"
,,Love love orchard road,4.0,,The shopping is without a doubt amazing only one teeny criticism i wish it was slightly more pedestrian friendly particularly in the malls better signs so that you can work out where you are so you can work out where to shop next!
,,A Hip hot spot for almost all you need,4.0,,Always a pleasure to ramble along orchard road. Too many place to shop though things are not cheap. All designer brands you can think of. Like to chill out by the café bar and watch the people passing by.
,,Top End and Not Worth it.,3.0,,"Orchard Road is fine to visit to see what all the talk is about, but l wouldn't spend a lot of time there. There are far more shopping centres in Singapore worth a visit if you want to find value for money. I would recommend the Suntec (Marina Square mall) or even Vivo City Mall at Harbourfront Station."
,,Shopping plus!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one of those streets that caters perfectly to all shoppers. Whether you want designer clothing and apparel, to discount shopping, its all there!
Plus, if you take the time to explore, there are many cafes and restaurants, both in asian and western food types. Take your time if you have it. My wife and I spent two days there last year and didnt see enough. We spent a week this year and got to find everything."
,,A must for every shopper and foodie,5.0,,Great to shop in sg. Lots of variety to shop from and lots of very good cafes and restaurants if you need a break. World class and concentrated conveniently on one road. Popular with locals and tourists. At least a day if you have limited time. As many days as you like if you have plenty.
,,Too Top End,3.0,,"If you like shopping in top end shops then Orchard has plenty of them, and the outlets are repeated in every shopping block. Would prefer more mid range options. Spent 2 full days in the area and did not spend more than $200.00, food was the biggest item, and yes some great places to dine at.

And $S4.00 for a seniors theatre ticket in great theatres, was the highlight."
,,Shopping galore,4.0,,"Orchard Road is probably Singapore's most famous locale. It's about as tourist-y as you can get. Lined with lots of malls and shops, you'll have to spend hours just going through everything.
Shop, dine, watch movies, take pictures and just have fun.
Via the Orchard MRT, you can exit to ION Orchard Mall - if you're looking for an H&M branch, this is the easiest to go to. There's also a nice Kinokuniya bookstore along this stretch of road.
Just walking through the road is a pleasure in itself."
,,Beautiful at Christmas time...hold on tight to your wallet!,4.0,,"This is a shopping mecca...anything you want, you can find...for a price. Be prepared to pay a pretty penny to shop, but know that you'll be shopping the best designer labels, so quality comes at a price."
,,"Boring, boring: an obscenity of riches",1.0,,"Utterly, indescribably boring. Endless shops and eateries. Certainly not humanity at its worst but veering in that direction."
,,More than enough shopping malls,3.0,,"Have you see five or six shopping malls, you have seen them all. I was bored, in and out, seeing more of the same, but the ladies loved it, until we passed number seven. Went bac to the other end of Orchard, and ended at the Long Bar. Nice."
,,perfect shopping experience,5.0,,"I love orchard Road. There are shops for everyone. top end designer, the delights of Muji and more downmarket malls as well.
even if you ae not spending on clothes the food court at Ion is well worth a visit. Also TWG is a fantastic tho not cheap place for a cup of tea and some cake."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Orchard road is a shopper paradise. You will be spoiled for choice plus all the nice resturants and cafés. Simply it was fantastic.
,,Shopping shopping shopping!!!,4.0,,Whatever u need to buy u can find it here. They're probaby not the cheapest througout singapore but u definately can buy everyhing here. One stop shopping.
,,Great if you enjoy up market shopping or just people watching,3.0,,I love shopping & I love shopping overseas. I think his is a great shopping precinct but a tad boring if your on a budget or don't enjoy shopping for up market labels. I was very time poor when I visited & may have enjoyed it more if I had much more time. Be careful of the traffic - I've never seen so much pedestrian / motorist road rage anywhere in the world as I did here. Be careful.
,,A 'Must do' while in Singapore,4.0,,"We travelled around the city in the double decker bus, we purchased a 2 day pass, it was a great way to travel around the busy city, it stops regularly at many stops on Orchard Road, so there was usually no wait for a bus back to the hotel while taking in the sights from the top deck
Orchard Road itself was great to see, especially at night where it really comes alive, bright lights, and thousands of shoppers, a real buzz.
I found the shops were either low end discount stores or the high, high end exclusive stores, which I thoroughly enjoyed browsing through. The whole experience makes for a great day or night trip, with all stores open till late."
,,Shop till you drop on cosmopolitan Orchard road.,4.0,,"Singapore is famous for many things,it's food ,Sentosa Island,it's hotels and then you have the famous stretch of road called Orchard Road.If one of all these things mentioned stands out and is on every ones lips that visit Singapore or that matter the locals it would be the mega shopping strip that has the whole of Asia in envy.Orchard road has been the heart beat of Singapore for many years and reasons it is a multimillion/multibillion dollar marketing extravaganza that is famous for its shopping.Wheather it be fashion,food,jewelry,or anything in between Orchard road has it all.I have never yet completely explored this road to its fullest and I don't think I ever will simply because it would take me a good month or so to really see what is on offer.

So here is a short list of things that the shop aholics would look for or the window shopper that only gazes at to kill time.From designer brands like Rolex,Fendi,Chanel,Louis Vutton,Hermes,Ives Saint Lauran,Gucci,specialized couture tailors, 22 shopping malls,6 department stores,food courts,international franchise restaurants,world renown restaurateurs,and a mirage of hotels and entertainment venues which has something for all tastes and wallets of all sizes on a stretch of road that is 2.2km long.The Singapore government and it's tourism board have out done themselves to create what is arguably the best shopping avenue in Asia.This cosmopolitan playground set among a lush,tropical landscape adorned with historic angsana trees that grace the side walks are also a treat and refreshes the senses before you take of again discovering that hidden bargain or two.

So the next time your in Singapore and want to see a tourist attraction with a difference,which has something for all tastes then remember ""ORCHARD ROAD SINGAPORE"",Stay,shop,drink,eat,and explore till your feet burn."
,,More Shopping,4.0,,Wife had to come down to this part of town....to get her therapy (shopping). Whole street 4km streach full of shops and top notch malls. Spend the whole day in Orchard Road and was very amazed by multiple levels of shopping catered to everyone.
,,Shops!,4.0,,"Great area to go if you are looking for shops, lots of large malls, to suit all budgets and there is a mrt line linking most of them, so that makes it easier on your feet."
,,marvelous shopping and dining,4.0,,"just by walking down orchard road top to bottom, i have experienced the broad meaning of shopping and dining haven. no matter what item you are looking for, all are within your resources limit...."
,,Options galore,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise, clean, easy to get around. So much to choose from High end of market to souveniers."
,,shopper's paradise,4.0,,"A great place to shop and dine in the city with never ending malls , great architecture , famous brands. this place is a must go for shopaholics."
,,A shopping street,3.0,,Orchard Road is a high end shopping street. Great if your shopping is aimed at all the high end departments stores- you will find them all there. There are some great little shops if you go downstairs in some of the large malls. Just a bit too sterile for me and not what I am after when holidaying in Singapore.
,,mall strip,4.0,,"Walk down the whole road and its malls everywhere. Whats cool about it is that malls have found a way to differentiate from each other. Going inside takashimaya is different from ion, for example. The shopping experience inside is also different when walking up/down outdoors of orchard.

However, there are malls outside of orchard that can satisfy the shopping cravings. Orchard is good to visit, and go back for specific items."
,,You'll find it here,4.0,,"Shopping at Orchard Road with my two boys aged 13 and 6 was okay. We caught the taxi to ION mall. There are lots of high end stores here. We them went to the next mall and visited the Gap store. Lots of things for the boys. We stopped off at the Food Republic and had an early dinner. then we travelled to another mall and I found some nice items for my 16 year old daughter. I then needed some souvenirs so went went across to Lucky Plaza via an underpass. I only had three hours to shop. There are lots of locals, school kids and tourists. It wasn't as busy as I expected. Hoping to return and investigate more! Don't be put off by the negative reviews."
,,If you like shopping - this is the place!,4.0,,"Overall another massive shopping district. While I'm used to seeing luxury stores all over Asia, I enjoyed the fact this mall had mid-grade and other nicer stores too. Stores like TopShop, North Face, Muji, etc - not just the Louis Vuittons."
,,Must be on to-do Shopping List,5.0,,"This was my third trip to singapore and Orchard Road for Shopping. Each time I have never been disappointed. Always start from Orchard Central, then work my way all way up-to Ion Orchard. If too hot outside, there are also multiple level shops underground that connect from Tackishimya- Wysteria -and Ion Orchard. -Worthwhile looking at."
,,Hustle Bustle everywhere,5.0,,"Being in IOrchard street and orchard Blvd. is quite an experience-Streets lined with shops big and small large department stires, Isetan, Robinsons, M&S you name it they have it and despite all the hustle abd bustle the traffic flows and is pretty smooth-
Here you wil meet tourtists and locals rub shoulders together as in Singapore despite the ocls shop in other NOn tourist areas Orchard road shopping is for one and all with their sales that bring every man womN OUT OF THEIR HOMES TO TAKE BACK BAGS LADEN WITH GOODIES
\Enough said Take a trip to this country and experience all this for your selves"
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Shopping on a big, big, BIG scale!
Amazing labels, all of your designers in the one place. Huge multi-storey malls line the road and everything looks like an architectural masterpiece!

It just a WOW moment!

Very clean too which is great. All of Singapore is.

Cant wait to be back in January next year (2014).

Takes lots of spending money because everything is just amazing!!!"
,,Beautiful but busy.,4.0,,"Orchard road is the 5th avenue (although with a few more turns) of Singapore. Filled with all the big names, it's a (rich) shopper's paradise. The prices are not exorbitant and with some outlets having both tourists discounts and VAT refund, you could get good offers. Well if you are on a very tight budget you may stop at the Lucky Plaza.
Overall, it is a good experience with a significant number of known brands."
,,Oxford street with 92 degree plus humidity,3.0,,"I am not much of a shopper. If you are and like high end labels LV, Dior etc AND you dont live in the USA then at the very least you might enjoy browsing. Tip - use the interconnecting mrt/tunnel walkways to move from mall to mall. Avoid going on Sundays as most Singapore maids/slaves have there days off and the place is crowded and frankly a headache."
,,The bond street of Singapore.,4.0,,High end designer shops. Worth a walk to see but no chance if buying if you're on a budget. Browse the designer stores and take it as a high end Singapore experience.
,,Plenty of shops but the area is looking a little tired and dated,3.0,,When we visited there was a lot of road work going on which made it very difficult to get around. I found the area looking a bit tired and dated where designer shops - many in need of a re-fit jostled with cheaper stores. This does not really compare well to upmarket shopping destinations around the world but is worth a visit if you have nothing else to do. I wouldn't be a hurry to return here.
,,Super Shopping Experience,5.0,,"One of the best shopping experience i have ever had.the most amazing brands and the most coolest stuff ever.they have dior,versache and what not.its extremly expensive,but if ur a brand freak then this is one place you cant miss."
,,Shoppers' Paradise,5.0,,"The stretch of Orchard Road is long and wide. Aside from the different types and variety of retail shops available along Orchard Road, you can simply sit by the bench located along the road to enjoy the scenic and the pedestrians dressed in their fashionable outfits.

You will never stay hungry as there are wide selections of eatery in the malls located along Orchard Road."
,,Champs-Elysées Singapore,3.0,,Orchard Road the Champs -Elysées of Singapore many malls ans hotel restaurants all day busy day and night in the sides some attractions it is nice to walk there but i prefer morning and afternoons ispend time in walking or sitting in cafes
,,A street with malls,3.0,,"Do not plan to come to Singapore only to see Orchard street. It is only a street with a lot of malls and restaurants on the site and you can find plenty of them home.
The street by night is worth coming if you are already in Singapore but nothing really typical is to be seen there. The dynamism and lights by night are somehow exciting but nothing breathtaking."
,,"great place, plentyl of stuff for everyone",5.0,,"lots of things for various people, ballers will have their shops and affordable people will have theirs. taxi line is really long but worth a full day if you are keen to see many things and have the wallet to cover the purcahses"
,,Addiction for shopoholics......,2.0,,"Personally I don't like this place for being unnecessarily expensive....... very ordinary place with 'nothing special' shopping malls..... but yes......almost all the world famous brands are there who charges like Paris/Milan/London stores!!! Good quality products are available here but I don't find any reason to pay SG$ 250 for a simple one color Polo shirt whereas I can buy the same with a cost of SG$ 100 from the same designer store somewhere else (for example, in KL). Orchard road has a good collection of brands but the place 'Orchard Road' itself has not got such a brand image like Milan or Paris who's being producing hundreds of designers over last hundred year. Shoppers around this road look like big fools and they look happy to be fooled by the stores.

You will find some good places for food and drink for sure."
,,Shopper's delight!,4.0,,"A stretch of shopping plazas, with high street brands scattered all around: that's how I would describe Orchard Road. If shopping (for branded goods) is on your agenda, than this look no further. And if you aren't in Singapore (like me!), then spend about 90 mins roaming the place, preferably at night and move on.

Loved how the malls are inter-connected underground, and even the tree-lined road outside gives it a very distinct look.

Do not expect any traditional or ethnic stuff to be here: it's all world-class branded stuff. Go to ChinaTown or other areas otherwise."
,,Nice but Not What Expected,4.0,,"We thought that Orchard Road would be really mind blowing homes etc but Paddington and Glebe in Sydney and I am sure many places in London and New York would run circles around this place in terms of Architectural beauty and significance. There were some nice little terraces and shops but nothing out of the ordinary really if one is widely travelled. It was only a very short street. Lonely Planet guide totally overated this place to visit and the house numbers they gave to check out did not meet expectations in any way, in fact there were far better places both Historically and archictecurally in the street than there recommendations. We found the little streets off Northbridge Road called Haji and Arab Lane to be far more Architecurally pleasing and the shops a blast. Highly recommend you take a walk there. Much better if you into cheaper and more crazy shops than trendy label shopping around Orchard Road."
,,Megamalls!!,3.0,,"Large Malls dominate the area, and you can easily go into one and 2 hours later come out of another one 100 metres up the road on the other side such is the confusion and sheer scale of these things.

The issue is that all the shops and tiny with limited stock, and nothing is remotely cheap. There also aren't recognizable brands and therefore quality is relatively unknown. Fun to look round for a bit but that's all."
,,Typical shopping area but very nice at night,4.0,,"A busy shopping experience, lots of restaurants and eateries around the area as well. Thought it to be quite over-rated initially but it was very lively at night. Lots to explore so would recommend setting a few hours aside."
,,A good place to shopping,4.0,,many shopping malls thr and dont forget to go the A&F to take pic with those muscle guys which is free ! Dont shy !
,,Excellent shopping experience,4.0,,A good range of shops but a little pricey in places in comparison to the UK. A variety of shopping malls including international and local designers. Busy hustle and bustle atmosphere which I love and what felt like an extremely safe environment for a solo traveller!
,,Go at night,4.0,,"It´s a nice place to stroll. Lots of people , many place to eat or drink something. I don´t know how many shopping malls in this street, but there´s one for every taste and budget.
All kinds of store , fancy and not so fancy ones, If you walk around you can find good deals on local sales."
,,Superb Place. A must when in Singapore.,5.0,,"Every building on Orchard has a mall within, above and below it, with all of them interlinked. Excellent place to shop. But do not miss a stroll on the street itself as its worth it. Lots of place to just sit around with a beer. The only down market mall on the strip is the Lucky mall and to top it, they charge you 20 cents for a pee. Isetan, Ion, @323 Somerset are all worth a visit. Kindly note that at one end of the road is the Orchard MRT station and at the other end is the Somerset MRT. Its a must when in Singapore."
,,Best Shopping Spot of the City,4.0,,High end brands are located at this shopping area. Whole orchard is Filled with shopping malls from budget goods up to high end products.
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"By all means this is the busiest and nicest street in Singapore for shopping, window shopping.Easy access by all transport ,Buses ,Taxis and MRT.Amazing buildings ,full with shopping malls like ION Orchard , Takashimaya , etc.Nice to sit on the bench enjoying the day.The best time to visit Orchard is during the GSS (Great Singapore Sale ) ,can buy many things in bargain price including the branded items.Some Shopping malls were connected with each other by underpass including the opposite malls.Must try the ice potong on the street of Orchard, refresh your day during hot sunny days."
,,Shoppers dream street,4.0,,Full on shopping above and below ground. Do your homework if you are looking for a good deal. In the smaller malls barter. For the mainstream stores the pricing is comparable with home. It's still a fun experience.
,,bus drivers terribly unhelpful and rude,1.0,,"Our hotel recommended that we take public transit to get to some spots on orchard road. I was with my Mum who's a breast cancer survivor so she's not as agile. We took 4 different buses because each bus driver told us ""we no speak English... My English not good..."" so they end up dropping us off at the wrong stops! The transit map and the street signs were not easy to read so I had to drag my poor mother through the streets. We finally found a taxi stand by one of the upscale malls (thinking that at least we could get a car service or an Englush speaking or even a nice driver). The lineup looked like ""all westerners"" only because we were patiently waiting at the taxi stand while the cabbies picked and chose their fares.... Singaporeans only! It was a real horrible experience! We got a cab after 2 hours!!!! The cabbie didn't want to take us at first but my Mum decided to just get in anyways so he had no choice but to take us. He said he wouldn't have taken us otherwise because at that time of day (5pm) they prefer to take longer routes. Ridiculous!!!! I was fuming because my Mum's stitches started hurting because of this ordeal! I would never recommend going to Singapore ever again."
,,Amazing road in Singapore,4.0,,Orchard road is lined with the most amazing buildings. Lots of busy shopping malls all filled with lots of people all day. Must go at night as all the lights make it an amazing sight to see. Really enjoyed the vibrant clean friendly city.
,,Shopping,1.0,,"Overrated. Lots of shops but very average. Sephora, michael kors, forever 21, h&m, Zara ect but apart from that nothing special. Terrible shopping for men and no seating areas."
,,Shop and Snap !!,4.0,,"This place is lined up with malls and amazing buildings. Did go in the day time and found the outside of the malls to be more attractive than the inside. Shops are quiet expensive ! Must go in the night for the lights. its a paradise for photo's - people with camera's can be found everywhere taking snaps. Architecture of the building have been well thought off, ample parking space.Good place to visit !"
,,panic mode,5.0,,"my first time to travel alone. i never regret it going to this beautiful country. i'm a self-confessed shopper. shopping is my past time. i am torn between BKK and Singapore. In singapore, orchard road is a must. the road it self is very clean and oragnized. the only vendors i saw were selling sandwich ice cream and it was pleasant. Malls i love are Ion, Wisma Atria, Takashimaya, and Paragon.Ion mall, i went to H&M and had lunch at TWG Tea, while on Wisma, you can find nice stores like tory burch etc. in Takashimaya, they have sales now on their department store, really good finds. paragon mall is a big place with also many stores. panic mode at orchard road!
*just went last August 14, 2013."
,,Busy shopping area,3.0,,"Full of hustle and bustle - store after store, mall after mall. It is the shoppers paradise. This is just one side of Singapore if you like to shop."
,,Either You Love it or hate,4.0,,Orchard road is an amazing attraction in Singapore with so many different shops and malls. There is so many people and its either you'll love or hate it. Interesting place.
,,Shopping shopping and shopping,4.0,,"Wide selection of brand and concentrated. Always found what I need, surrounded by million of restaurant. Center of S G. that good for both locals and tourist! I could easily adapt myself in this area."
,,a fabulous experience,5.0,,"Orchard Rd is an amazing shopping avenue for shoppers, it provides many big fantastic malls and glamorous stores. Many world-wide famous shops such as H&M, ZARA, TOPSHOP... and to more bigger brands like Chanel are included! For shopaholics seeking for somewhere to spend your vacation, Orchard Rd should be on you top priority!"
,,A very busy street with malls on both sides,4.0,,"If you like shopping then this is the place. The entire street is full of malls on both side of the street and most malls seem to have the same shops. When we went, there was just a sea of people walking around. Most of the shops are what is easily available in the USA for us so we didn't see a point in buying things here and then pay luggage fees to take them back to the US. If you are a bargain hunter like me then this place would be ideal for just window shopping and not buying since most of the things sold there are cheaper on sale in the US."
,,Over crowded and very expensive,2.0,,"Everything in Singapore is way overpriced. Cheap junk that you would pay $15 for back home is $45 there. Expensive things take on a whole realm of their own here. Designer watches cost $50,000 to $70,000 for the cheap ones while $171,000 is not uncommon.

There are some many shops here all trying to sell the same stuff out of, what must be, extremely expensive shops that they have to charge excessively high prices. It's not good value for money and any reasonably smart person would not waste money for nothing.

Even if your a millionaire I don't think you'd throw money away on overpriced luxury items that are on offer here. Otherwise you wouldn't be a millionaire for long."
,,Shop till you drop !,5.0,,"Thats what my wife did in Sinagpore.....shopped, shopped and shopped - 6 pairs of shoes, several dresses and tons of accessories. Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise. ION and Far East Mall were her hotspots."
,,Orchard Road - something else for serious shoppers,4.0,,"My friend recommended we visit Orchard Road. I couldn't believe the number of designed shops - and the size of them.

We were welcomed into the shops we dare venture into (Tag Heuger, Omega, Tiffany etc). Their premises were lovely (and air conditioned).

There was still something for everyone. Shop assistants in the department store were a little over attentive when you were browsing - it was a little claustrophobic and annoying with them breathing over you waiting on a sale.

Overall though worth a visit."
,,I had a lot of fun exploring all the places,4.0,,"There was everything from high end stores like Prada and Gucci, to more of a mall type of building that had every type of store under the sun. I had a lot of fun exploring all the places, but needed maybe a week to explore them all, and with work taking most of my time, I didn't even scratch the surface. I would love to come back here someday"
,,Christmas at orchard road,4.0,,"have heard about this but it was truly a treat for the eyes when i saw it for the first time. Very painstakingly decorated with birds (real & artificial) chirping around at 8:30 pm in the night! loads of shopping to do and a very decent walk. one should avoid the weekends as it crowded to the core. so if you are tourist or travelling with kids, do it on a weekday. this is typically ready by 2nd week of december and it arrives with a bang publicity. i would definitely suggest one to take an open top bus tour during this time."
,,Nothing special,3.0,,That's a shopping street like in any other big city in the world. Gone there as it's so much advertised in the guidebooks. If you have some particular interest in shopping it's an ultimate place in Singapore. Otherwise it's just a busy street. Keep in mind that it may be hard to find some budget eateries if you get hungry. I'm attaching a photo of one shop that caught my eye :-)
,,Lots of money required,4.0,,"We had not been to Orchard Road for many years, and many things had changed, once you could pickup all types of items at good prices but now their are many Designer stores, which is fine if you have lots to spend.
Unfortunately there is not much left for the average shopper which is disappointing only the Department stores which generally have the same items that are available at home, having said that it is still a great experience as this Road goes on forever."
,,"Shopping, shopping and shopping",5.0,,"It’s the center of Singapore for shopping, night life, food and everything in between. No doubt it takes some cash to enjoy in this place. You have to be a local to get away and know your way around in this place. I have not seen so many people no matter how late at night it was. There are lots of shops, restaurants and people on the street but wait, go underground to the subway system and you’ll be overwhelmed with a lot more shops, restaurants and people."
,,Super expensive,3.0,,Take plenty of money if you want to shop in Orchard Rd. Singapore used to be a great place for bargains but now this Rd is full of big name brands at top prices. In general it is cheaper to shop at home.
,,Shopper's Paradise for all types of budget!,5.0,,"One stop shopping for all budgets is what we have at Orchard Road. start from Isetan Scotts/Wisma where you can find designer items at knock off prices. Range is 50% to 70% off original price. Brands like DKNY, CK, Armani, Guess, Coach, Long Champ, etc. Ion is good place cos there are just many stores with incredible discounts during the great Singapore Sale during June and July.
Stores in Ion like Kate Spade, Marc Jacob, Zara, Guess, Gap, etc. Within these shopping malls you will find food and beverage outlets. Many different types of cuisines and price range to suit the visitors.
We love DKNY, CK, Coach( a factory outlet at IMM in Jurong-must go!!)
From Ion walk to Takashimaya and you will be welcomed by more designer stores. These higher end designer shops like Prada LV may not have good discount.
We figure if you are going for Prada, Gucci ,Chanel brands etc,you my want to save it for Hong Kong or Milan trip. There, at these designer factory outlets you will find incredible discounts to die for!!!

Takashimaya has Moschino, Desigual, Armani, Juicy Coulture, Coach,etc. Don't forget to go down to basement for food paradise...international selection!

From Takashimaya, you walk down to 313 and there are similar shops like ZARA.
Opposite from Takashimaya there is also Paragon...good with high end brands. However, discount may not be attractive. However, if the consumer is rich, they do not really go for discounted goods or do they?...smile.''

Tangs stores is getting worse....we do not find interesting stuff in this store even after the renovation. It has a huge basement for household appliances.
The ladies department and men's level are disappointing. We think you can give it a miss.;(

For those short press for time, we will recommend, Ion, isetan Wisma and Takashimaya as prime areas for your shopping and dining pleasure.

You can practically get everything you want in these 3 malls.

For budget conscious travellers, go where locals go...IMM in Jurong.( Jurong east interchange) There are many branded designer outlets selling off season products for incredible discounts!

Visitors, Happy shopping! Good things are meant to be shared.;)"
,,"cool indie vintage store- the attic, lifestyle store",5.0,,"This place has always seem to excite me on my every visit. Situated almost at the end of the Orchard Road belt is this lovely little vintage store tucked away in an older pioneer mall called FAR EAST PLAZA. The mall is just in between the Grand Hyatt Hotel and Goodwood Park Hotel. It is on the fourth floor hidden behind a crocodile handbag shop called Malaysia Reptile House. Don't bother checking the old mall's directory cause it's not updated...the first time I managed to find this gem was while looking for a toilet! Stepping into this little store just set me into another time dimension. If you are sick of everyday goods and generic high end shopping along Orchard Road, this is definitely the place!!! It is choke filled with antiques,records,vintage designer sunglasses,antique designer jewelry,vintage clothings/accesories, oddities and many more,,,,you just name it and they might just have it! Definitely an out of the box shop. A++++EXPERIENCE if you love vintage hunting and collecting! I uploaded some pictures of the store which I researched online:)"
,,Every Tourist Must Spend Few Hours Here And Enjoy The Electrifying Atmosphere,4.0,,The place otherwise known for best Malls in Sigapore and exculive brand shopping has many attractions on road also (even if one does not want to shop) like jugglers showing tricks; ’bands playing music ;performers doing cultural acts. etc. etc---The surrounding ; decor and atmosphere is electrifying . One can spent few hours here on road enjoying without getting bored .It is a must visit place for tourist who is advised to spend some time ( few hours) soaking in the hustling and bustling of this road ‘The best time is evening hours when it is not hot and there are maximum attractions and multi ethnic –multi cultural crowd on road Fountains ; Statues etc all add to beauty of the place.I am sure tourist will take back sweet memories and photos back home to tell and show to others .
,,Excellent shopping,4.0,,"All the shops you want and more.... Enjoy singapore sale and all fab restaurants. Use MRT to go around, easy, convenient and cheap!"
,,The main Shopping street of Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Raod is the main shopping area of Singapore. Famous as the Champs Elysee in Paris or Bond Street in London. More than 20 malls with the most exclusive brands and trendiest fashion houses.

I mainly went to the ION Orchard mall. This monster mall spans eight retails floors and 48 more residential floors. There are over 333 strores with high fashion brands and gourmet dining venues.

Easy access with the metro, stop Orchard (basement of the ION Orchard mall)"
,,Singapore Sale,5.0,,During July it's the Great Sale season hence Orchard Road is bustling with business. One has to be patient and compare prices. The prices varies from shop to shop
,,Lots of high end shops.,5.0,,"Great if you want to blow some cash on the best luxury brands. If you are cheap and just want to eat, go to the food court in the basement of the Takashimaya in Ngee Ann City. Awesome noodle stand, and great chicken rice."
,,Shopping place and park in one,5.0,,It's easy to walk the path along Orchard Road. You can sit anywhere and take your shopping all in a stride. Brands are everywhere and you can choose to cool inside the malls or relax under the streets at the side walks.
,,Could be anywhere in the world,3.0,,"To me the Orchard Road area is one of those shopping areas that you can visit anywhere in the world. The malls are pleasant and contain a range of shops. There is no cheap shopping here as they are mostly the brand names and seem to be fairly expensive. It is difficult to find clothes or shoes if you are a little more than average size. It is extremely crowded on the weekends and you will have a lot of people with you. There are some nice shops here and the best book shop I have visited is here. It is Kinokuniya in the Ngee Ann City building. Well worth a visit and a browse. At the top end of Orchard Road there is an older mall near the York Hotel, but a number of the shops were fairly ordinary and a lot closed."
,,Shopping and 1S$ Ice cream,5.0,,"ION is a must visit place especially on the period of Great Sing Sale, but uncle ice cream is always great...all over the years......love it!"
,,"One word, shopping.",4.0,,"There is basically nothing to do but shop and eat along Orchard road. Its one place is Singapore that you must visit, even if you don't like shopping. Every good brand you could ever think of. Lots of expensive and lots of cheap stuff! Easily a whole day for shopping here."
,,"""A must for Shopaholic !!""",4.0,,"Its a Paradise for buying expensive items also a home for Luxury brands like Prada, Louis Vuitton & others..If you are not looking for luxury then you can also visit Lucky Plaza in Orchid road where you can find everything at some reasonable rates. It has good shops from money changer to Travel/Tourism where you can buy tickets at slightly less rate other then from the entrance gate of the attraction.
Also good for spending the evening while looking at the crowd & the shops."
,,The shopping centre of Singapore,4.0,,Though its no Fleet Street but it is a great place if you are a shopaholic. We spent over 3 hours hoping from one side to other.
,,Christmas wonderland!,5.0,,"Having seen Christmas lights all over the world - this has to be the most spectacular - and this in a non-Christian country - brilliant! It is a wonderful way to spend an evening - shopping in some of the finest shops in Singapore, enjoying a free light show and just people watching - fantastic. Only thing - book your return taxi via Concierge in Mall or from your hotel - or you'll wait in line for hours!!"
,,Shopping,5.0,,"If shopping and browsing are what you want, Then Orchard road is the place to go. It has been several years since we have visited Singapore, and we're pleasantly surprised by the range and variety of shops and shopping malls. Plenty of variety and enough to keep you busy for days"
,,Heaven of shopping.,5.0,,This is the place to make you keep shopping and shopping. Variety brand and in cheap price. The most happening time is on Christmas season the road is full fill will many lighting very beautiful and also is year end sales every where. Love it.
,,It has everything you want,5.0,,If shopping is your thing Orchard Road is paradise. How many luxury stores can exist in a kilometer?
,,Shopping galore,5.0,,"Shops, shops and more shops in mall after mall. I am not a shopper but my friend was so we spent a day here. A huge selection of everything. A lovely picturesque tree-lined street. Lots of places to buy liquid and food sustenance along the way."
,,Sex and the City!,4.0,,"Even if you don't buy anything, just strut along the full length of this road of expensive signature shoppes and feel the vibes of Miranda or Samantha or Charlotte or Carrie!"
,,Lovely Ion Orchard building,4.0,,"Beautifully designed building. Couldn't care much about the stores inside, but the exterior of the building, just.. genius."
,,Signature Shopping,4.0,,"This is where you can find malls beside malls. Very ideal for shopping especially if you're into branded/signature items and if walking is not a problem. Taxis are everywhere though costly, so walking or taking the bus would be another option. If you're looking for good and cheap finds as well as items which you can bring home to your loved ones/friends, do not buy here, instead, go to Bugis."
,,Shopper's Paradise,5.0,,We have visited Singapore twice for eight days on each trip. We stayed in Holiday Inn on Orchard road the second time round. You never get bored on the Orchard road. Loads of shopping to be done and sales and offers going on. It is alive till late and so it is a good idea to opt for a day out for attractions or excursions and then return to the Orchard road for shopping and entertainment. There are a lot of restaurants and also street dancers and entertainers are present in abundance.
,,Nice shopping street.,3.0,,"Orchard road is shoppers' heaven. We stayed at a hotel on the Orchard road. The road was very nice, safe, and clean. We went to a few shopping department stores. We didn't buy anything expensive. I am not a good shopper."
,,Crowded shopping.,3.0,,"If you like shopping and big brand names, definitely stop here. I don't, but my friend does... So we compromised and kept our visit brief.
That said, when I asked locals what to do in Singapore they ALL said shop & eat. This area offers both if that's your thing :)"
,,Shoppy Shoppy,4.0,,If you like shopping then this is the place . All the main brands and plenty of market stalls in highrise comfort to bargain with. Avoid the weekends as they are very busy
,,Shopping!,5.0,,Be ready to do a lot of walking as the malls are lined up. You'll be able to find something for sure. June is the perfect time to go because they have the Great Singapore Sale!
,,Giant shopping street. Brands. That's it.,3.0,,"Great if you love stuff like Gucci, Prada, Vuitton, etc.
Terrible if you love hiking, nature, and hawker food stalls.

There isn't anything special or wonderful about this place, it's just a high-end shopping district. Compare it to Ginza in Tokyo, or 5th Avenue in NYC. If that is what you are looking to do...then this place is to do it."
,,Nice but crowded,5.0,,"It's the hub for High Fashion(Gucci, Prada,etc). I loved the shopping but the nobly problem was the crowd. It's always crowded even on a normal day."
,,Fun to Dream,4.0,,We couldn't afford anything as it is all designer but it was fun to dream and look at everything. We did find a 3 for $10 store which had some really cool stuff. Coming from a small country with tiny malls this was quite exciting for us. I didn't like people taking advantage of the disabled kids though to make money from the tourists. It was quite sad. If you see the little carts buy a icecream sandwich - $1 and it is great in the hot weather. If you have money to spend lucky you but if not it is still an interesting street!
,,Crowded shopping area,1.0,,"I can't imagine why Orchard Road should be a destination of any interest to anybody. It's wall-to-wall people, shops, hotels, buses, cars, fumes, and noise.

There are shops below ground, at ground level, and above ground. You can buy the usual stuff: clothing, food, electronics, and so on.

You might as well stay home if that's all you're looking for."
,,Shop till you drop on Orchard Road!,5.0,,"Holy WOW! What a shopping district - everything you can think off including all the high end retailers. LV, Gucci, Prada, Chanel etc etc. Always worth a stroll, plenty of malls to escape the humidity and MRT/Buses are plentiful to Orchard Road."
,,Too much designer stuff,3.0,,"I am a bit disappointed by the overrepresentation of very very high end, expensive designer brands. Would be good to see more of a mix of shops. Overall a fun place to spend the day though."
,,"Soulless , characterless,hot and humid",1.0,,"If you like concrete malls in hot,humid and sticky climes this soulless road is for you, all retail madness gone insane in the perfect example of globalization squeezing the entrails out of diversity and multiculturalism.Bland,heartless,doleful.Romford with palm trees.Retail without life.Just buy and not fully comprehend where you are, where you are going or how you got there."
,,It's okay - bring tons of money!,3.0,,"It's just a really massive road of high end shops - lots of which repeat themselves after a certain distance. I guess I was hoping for more shops that I hadn't seen before. We got almost half way before becoming a little bored and tired!

There are some cool little malls scattered here and there and you can find some great food courts and little eateries.

Worth a visit if you have the time and money!"
,,Mind Boggling,5.0,,Orchard Road is awe inspiring with all big brans around and laods of malls/retail outlets for shopping etc it is a really great high-end shopping place
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Great shopping area a whole street of just mall after mall. We took the metro to Orchid road and you came out in one of the malls (wheelock I think) All the major stores are there and plenty more besides. A whole load of food courts and restaurants as well
,,Massive Road of Shopping,5.0,,"I am an avid shopper but this road literally had me floored. We were so exhausted and tired after only going through 3 of the malls that we decided to see if we can walk the entire length of the road - its a near impossible feat.

This is a must-see in Singapore. You have to come here at least once during your stay."
,,An absolute must for tourists....,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a 2.2 km road FULL of shops, bars, hotels, restaurants, and malls. You name it, it's probably on this street. It is a fantastic street to spend the day on....walk, eat, people watch, hang out, watch the buskers, etc. The only thing you should not do on Orchard Road is drive....traffic is always busy. However, there are three metro stops on Orchard Road (Somerset, Dhoby Ghaut, & Orchard) which allow easy access. Personally, I think the street shows best in the nighttime but whether it's day or night, you'll be impressed. There is a huge Tourist Information Center on this street and the staff are very helpful. During Christmas, this is a fantastic place to hang out due to all the Xmas lights. Put aside a full day for this street...."
,,Shopping!,5.0,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping. Literally shopping mall after shopping mall. If you like shopping, you'll go nuts! Lots of walking! A good day out to work up an appetite!"
,,One of the most beautiful moments in my life,5.0,,"I had one on the most beautiful moments in my life while standing in the middle of orchard road at sunset. After a day of shopping, when you're tired and hungry and ready to go to a restaurant or back to the hotel the last thing you want to do is stand still.

But we did.

We stood still because, I wanted to grab something from my purse and as usual couldn't find it so I had to take a seat at the steps in front of ION. After a bit of rummaging I found what I was looking for and was about to get up when me and my boyfriend both froze.

In a metropole like Singapore City, where there's almost never a silent moment in between all the people, the taxi's, the delivery cars, the cars, the motorbikes and so on.
It was dead quiet for a second: the sky was purple, the neon signs and led lights on buildings everywhere were shining brightly and that second of silence seemed to last forever. Then it happened: the silence broke and out of the beautiful trees growing beside the busy, modern, crowded Orchard streets there was the most overwhelming sound I have ever heard, the squeaking, twittering and chirping of thousands of birds began.

For those few seconds, which lasted ever so long in my head, Singapore was even more beautiful than it already is and I can't wait to return."
,,place for shopping,4.0,,"this area is full of mall, when you come to singapore for shopping, you must try to shopping in this area. you can find many brand shop in this area."
,,Mrs,3.0,,Shop till you drop! Just wish there was more outlet-type shops for budget shoppers. If you like high-end retail then you have come to the right place.
,,Something for Everyone.,5.0,,"I loved Orchard Road. So much choice for shopping centres. The department stores are beautiful with products that we can't get in Australia.

We visited ION which is huge and very smart, Tangs which leaves our department stores for dead, Takashimaya and more. The quality of food in these centres is very high. It is busy especially on Sundays when the locals go shopping.
We caught the MRT from Bugis which was quick and easy.

Orchard Road is clean, has great atmosphere and lots of variety. It's sophisticated and exciting."
,,Visit ION,4.0,,"You will find with Orchard Rad a lot of what it has to offer is inside its malls. I was surprised to find that Ion offered five levels, two underground. If you wondered where all the people are this is where they hide. Great shopping and some definite bargains to be found. Ground level you will find Armani, Gucci, Tiffany and Boss etc not cheap."
,,nobody gets lost in Orchard,4.0,,"Long street of hotels and shopping malls and eating places. This is a must in Singapore. Places to go are Forum if with children, Ion Orchard for a whole range of brands known and unknown alike, Ngee ANn city Takashimaya basement floor is a must for all foodies, Paragon is a cozy quieter shopping place with nice restaurants at the basement. There is an Apple store at the Wheelock Place."
,,Excellent shopping excellent,4.0,,"Can be overwhelming at first, but then you may find some stores repetitive. I would recommend going through the shopping centres as much as possible to avoid the heat. The thing I like about orchard road is there's always something going on like a show or promotion. For electronics avoid lucky plaza as they are a rip off there, go somewhere like Funan digital mall."
,,A must see during X'mas season,5.0,,"People say, in Asia there are 2 places you must visit to be amazed for the x'mas celebration decorations and lightings, one is HK another is Orchad Road. Over the years, I've made it a point to visit Singapore every alternate year to experience their fabulous effort to decorate the whole street with thousands of lights. The street is lined with big malls which tries to outdo each other in decorations."
,,Shopper Heaven,4.0,,"If you love shopping you will love it - all the main designer labels in one street. If, like me, you hate shopping, just have a look at it as you go past on the circular tourist bus!!"
,,orchard road singaore,5.0,,"This one is best shopping destination you can visit if you have taste for all international brands
must visit Negi ann city , u can simply sit there outside shopping mall and enjoy surroundings it will certainly calm you down , just take stroll across road lot of small activities like music show goes on
there are lot of other mall where u can get all sorts of stuff , just one downside
bit expensive stuff"
,,for the shopper in me,5.0,,Nice place for shoping..all good brands are availble but mostly very crowded at all times.however what i like about being here is the livliness of the place
,,fun area with lots of shops and dining,4.0,,"worth visiting, beautiful area. Orchard Towers will be of interest to single men with all the different bars in one location."
,,Most Singaporean Favorite Meeting Place,5.0,,"As i have mentioned, Orchard Road is a 2.2 kilometre-long street that is the retail and entertainment hub of Singapore.You can find all sort of attraction here, in addition to being the most popular shopping enclave in the city-state. I also find it very convenience as if all under one roof."
,,A Walk in the Rain,4.0,,"Sound not-so-romantic eh? No, it actually is romantic, just make sure you bring umbrella and you don't miss the places you passed by.. I love rain in Singapore!"
,,Shopping on Orchard Rd is insane!,5.0,,"You just cant expalin to some one who hasnt been there what it is like! Orchard road is a shoppers paradise, some stuff is very expensive but go anyway. Do what I did and window shop, try on a $250,000 yellow diamond ring, eat a $5 bowl of hand made beef noodle soup and just soak up the atmosphere"
,,Shopper's Paradise,5.0,,This is a must see for any shopper on your next trip to Singapore. Every name brand you can imagine is here. My wife and I replace her wedding ring during our visit at one of the higher end jewelers. It was a great experience and a fun day of shopping!
,,Shop till you drop!,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a shoppers delight with literally hundreds (possibly thousands) of stores to choose from! The core shopping area stretches for approx 2 kilometres and lots of it is inter-connected underground. A very busy strip when we visited and I assume it is like that most of the time - and it's not difficult to work out why. You could easily spend an entire day along Orchard Road. It's name is derived from when the road that led to pepper and fruit orchards during the 1800's.

There is one building (the name of which escapes me for the minute) on the left hand side (MRT side) of the road which has stories upon stories of elevators. This elevator is external from the building and is easily accesible from road level. It is THE largest, longest elevator ride I have ever encountered. An experience on it's own!

For the MRT train users alight at Dhoby Ghaut (this stop is basically at the start of Orchard Road) or alight at Somerset for a more central drop off stop. Bus services are PLENTIFUL to say the least also.

You will most likely do a lot of walking so our advice is to keep hydrated (especially in warmer weather) and take your time, grab a bite to eat, sit and relax in between stops, and you will have a good time taking in the many and varied shopping complexes and buildings that Orchard Road has to offer!"
,,Shopping Paradice,5.0,,"With over 20 malls with every breand ever imaginable, I can honestly say its THE place for shopaholic, so much to do your head will spin!"
,,The Go To Place in Singapore,5.0,,Orchard Road is the main go to place in Singapore...The huge malls and the branded stores on the road can be compared to other mega cities of the world. Went during Christmas and the roads were all decorated and wore a festive atmosphere..most of the malls had huge Christmas trees and were all set to welcome guests.. Of the few things this place is well connected by underground. We enjoyed our time just taking a walk on the road and shopping :-)
,,great place to shop and eat all day,4.0,,"Orchard Road is obviously one of the main places to go to in Singapore! So so many shops everywhere, but it's packed all the time. We made the mistake of walking outside along the sidewalk...but really, you never had to do that since pretty much all of Orchard Row is accessible and interconnected underground.

For me, Takashimaya had the best food court, which is definitely a factor when I rate where to go and go again. During the Moon Festival in September, there is a great sample area of all the moon cakes at the bottom of Takashimaya which I wouldn't miss.

Orchard Road is the biggest concentration of shopping in Singapore, so although goods in Singapore are notoriously overpriced, it's still a great place to window shop and browse. You could spend all day here!"
,,Shopping shopping shopping,5.0,,"What else is there to say! I followed my darling wife around for half a day whilst she took in the delights of Orchard Rd, and wasn't bored for a minute. There's plenty to keep even the most stoic anti shopper (read husband) entertained. Above and below ground high end shops abound. A must do."
,,A Must-Visit,5.0,,Who goes to Singapore and does not visit Orchard Road? This place is simply the finest place for shopping. It is also a great place for walking trips - scenic and very nicely-decorated especially during Christmas season. You will definitely never get bored here.
,,Busy!,3.0,,This area is the shopping center of Singapore. However it can get very busy amd not everything ais the bargain it first seems.
,,let's shop till we drop!,4.0,,great place for shopping. Luckily! got fragrance with great deal and discount! btw shops in every mall around there are same...
,,Awesome,5.0,,"One of the most posh area of the city and located to dhoby ghaut, the biggest mrt station of s'pore and the singapurra plaza, the biggest mall. You can easily venture out into the street and the malls are breathtaking. The mrt opens under the mall so you don't even need to cross the street. Try getting a hotel near it. You'll thank me afterwards. :-)"
,,For an Ultimate Shopper,4.0,,"One's visit to Singapore won't be complete without a brief visit to Orchard Road. As the city's center and shopping hub, you should arm yourself with a list of shopping malls to drop by too with a list of specific items to shop for as the whole length of Orchard Road from left to right side of the said road is packed with shopping malls.

It would indeed be advisable to research or ask 1st before plying along the road, may it be by foot if your staying in a hotel along Orchard Road, or by taking the mrt or bus. Items to shop for would usually be more of branded items from apparel to bags and accessories.

It would be nice to take note that there are also wonderful spots along the road e.g. venues or areas where art is encouraged with more items on sale or with certain areas for art appreciation for budding and made artists in their own comfortable medium of art may it be visual arts and etc.

Malls along Orchard Road range from expensive e.g. Takashimaya and those for bargain souvenir shoppers e.g. Lucky Plaza. With each kind of mall or mall building you have to take note of what is available inside the said malls - like if money changers in this specific mall have a higher rate or gives a better exchange . . . and for bargain shopping malls if certain items are advisable to be bought in those kind of malls e.g. electronics or just merely limit to small souvenir items.

Restaurants found in the malls range from fine dining restaurants to food courts. If you'd rather have McDonalds or the newly opened Filipino Jollibee you can find them also either in the malls or along Orchard Road. Coffeeshops like Starbucks and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf are also around along the road.

I guess it's all in all a shopping hub complete with a range of dining experience . . . with a little bit of culture at one end of the Orchard Road.

A must visit road, I'd say for shoppers and for the curious traveller."
,,Shoppers Heaven,4.0,,"Mall after mall, many connected by tunnels due the hot and humid weather year round in Singapore. Every store you can think of and more. Plus lots of food courts. We stopped for great fresh fruit drinks."
,,Orchard Road - The (shopping) backbone of Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a historic street that can be traced back to the beginnings of the Singapore. This long road is the backbone of the city and easily the finest place for shopping in Singapore.

While the shopping is more spread out compared to the scene in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui shopping districts, there are far fewer people, making it much easier to enjoy.

The list of shopping centers, malls and departments stores you can find on Orchard are extensive and it would take you several days or more to visit them all. Most (if not all) mid to luxury brand names, plenty of restaurants options and hotels can be found along Orchard Road. Alfresco coffee shops are also available, something that you don't always find in SE Asia shopping areas.

In addition to the good shopping and dining scene, we have always enjoyed the very large trees that you can see, lining parts of Orchard Road, providing shade and amusement in between shopping spots.

Overall, Orchard Road isn't a nice area of Singapore that we try to spend time around during trips to Singapore. Its a priority for shoppers but others will likely want to make there way to Orchard at some point during their visit to the city."
,,Only if you are a shopping addict,3.0,,"Even if thebuilding are beautiful i recommand you a visit only if you are a shopping addict.
It can take you a day to visit the road from the beginning to the end as all buildings include a lot of shops.
It's easy to get lost inside as all buildings are connected and each connection have shops so it's like a maze to get inside Orchard ^^
There is a lots of options for eat drink or shop but don't expect to visit other things here."
,,For shoppers its heaven,4.0,,Shoppers cannot find a better place than this in South East Asia. If you have got big bucks for shopping this is the place you should be at. You also have many options to eat to choose from. There is also a place to play pool while drinking beer. But you will have to get your own beer.
,,If you love to shop...,3.0,,"...you will enjoy Orchard Road but overpay for everything. I found it too crowded, too commercial, too much light, sound, smells...just total sensory overload. But it is less crowded than Hong Kong Island's Causeway area."
,,Non Stop Shopping Paradise!,5.0,,"No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the world famous Orchard Road which was named after the numerous pepper and nutmeg plantations that were in the area back in the 1840’s. It would probably take many weeks’ maybe even months to see every shop and mall that is here.

All the high end shops such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior etc are along this 2.2 kilometer shopping haven not just once but quite a few times. Singapore’s flagship department store Tangs is also on Orchard Rd and has been there since the 1950’s.

Tangs is my favorite store and I have lost count of the number of times I have been in here and their store at Vivocity, it is excellent for clothing, handbags and makeup etc.

Orchard Rd is a day out in itself and there are plenty of restaurants, bars and food courts to have a break from all the shopping. It is actually a lovely street with a lot of greenery, places to sit and people watch, sculptures, even a mobile ice-cream man who makes ice cream sandwiches!

We very rarely visit Orchard Rd now as we have been going to Singapore for the past 20 years and now prefer to go to the shopping centers in the suburbs, maybe not as flash but certainly lot cheaper.

But for the first time visitor orchard Rd is a must do."
,,Mecca for Shoppers,5.0,,"I was here on a business trip, and just couldn't believe all the shopping malls and stores all in one place. There was everything from high end stores like Prada and Gucci, to more of a mall type of building that had every type of store under the sun. I had a lot of fun exploring all the places, but needed maybe a weekto explore them all, and with work taking most of my time, I didn't even scratch the surface. I would love to come back here someday."
,,Paradise for Shoppers,5.0,,"It is well known that Singaporeans live to both eat and shop, well, of all the shopping areas we visited Orchard Rd offers the most opportunity to part with your hard erned cash, everything from Channel to Cartier all in one street offering the latest and wide collections I have seen anywhere in the world, all the shops are of course air conditioned so you simply have to visit them if only to cool down."
,,Shop Shop Shop,4.0,,"This is one street where you can shop until ya drop, it has improved over the last few years and its just a Shoppers delight especially those who want ridgy didge brands!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,Very good at orchard road. Marvellous experience .the people around are so friendly n the price of Singapore souvenir is cheap and anybody can afford
,,They have everything!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is located in the heart of Singapore. It has every store from, Forever 21 to Accessorize! There are so many restaurants with cusines from all around the world."
,,Window shopping delight,4.0,,"I was ready to dislike Orchard Road: I figured it'd be another overpriced shopping district packed to the gills with sharp-elbowed snobs. Not true. Although the prices in many stores are on the high side, Orchard Road is a cultural, culinary, and architectural experience as well as a commercial hub.

Try out a sidewalk cafe or two. Take in a movie — one of our favorite meals in Singapore was at the Cine Cafe next to the Shaw Centre multiplex. Take in the sweeping, undulating lines of Orchard Road's modern buildings. And people-watch. It makes for a wonderful afternoon."
,,Nice for shopping.,3.0,,"This is undoubtedly the main street in Singapore, where there are the most luxurious shops of the city, say that the best Italian and European fashion boutiques and not only are all strolling along this road.
In addition to fashion shops, many shopping centres, hotels in a full traffic road.
In few words, the famous an busy Orchard Road."
,,Comfy shoes and plenty of room on your credit card,4.0,,There are lots of the same shops including designer and big brands repeated in several malls but the malls are well laid out and usually food halls are on top floor. Valet parking available.
,,A MUST when you visit Singapore,4.0,,"This is the street where every visitor must pay a visit when they come to Singapore. I'd recommend starting from Tanglin Mall (at one of Orchard Road) and walk all the way to Plaza Singapura... Take a nice leisurely stroll.

There's the ever popular Ion Orchard, TWG, Paragon, H&M, Ippudo, Robinsons, OG, Kinokuniya and Takashimaya all located within this same stretch that is worth a look."
,,"too many people for fun browsing, just stop and have a coffee instead!",3.0,,"My advice, figure out what you want, where it is, and go straight there. Good news is there are more outdoor cafes and eating places, so if the crowds become too much just stop and have a break!"
,,Orchard Road,4.0,,"Touristy area. Great place to people watch and enjoy the various shopping malls. Prices are expensive and couldn't seem to find any unique shops - but then again I would need a local to guide me around and/or spend a week in Orchard Road to truly explore every nook and cranny!

Lots of taxis available for when you can't be bothered taking the MRT with your armload of shopping bags."
,,By far the best place to shop for gifts,4.0,,Simply loved the vibe here. The food options are also fantastic My hidden gem tip: Nice place to benchmark prices and window shop. Afterwards itis easy to grab the items from less touristy places.
,,have a look!,4.0,,"very crowded street, nice shops, good for looking more than shopping!! u can find better prices out of this region, but u should be there if u go to singapore!"
,,Lovely street to shop,4.0,,I can say that this road is the shopping paradise of Singapore. I just love to stroll along the road and visit different stores. Lots of nice food to eat too.
,,Must see Singaporean street,3.0,,If you happen to get the shortest layoverat Singapore be sure to visit Orchard road to get a good feel about the busy bodies of Singapura moving about in most fashionable clothes....Great eye candy...good shopping malls and overall sexy environment
,,"noisy, too big",3.0,,"I love shopping but I wouldn't go back here, shopping mall after shopping mall, all have the same shops, top labels, not for me"
,,Alternatives to Orchard Road,5.0,,"Orchard Road is nice. A must see for most visitors to SIN. However there's more to SIN than Orchard Road, the Jurong Bird Park, Sentosa Island, the Zoo, and the usual touristy destinations.

For instance, jump on one of Singapore's excellent ""Smart Mass Rapid Transport"" (SMRT) trains and head into the suburbs. Get off stations at random and go visit the local shops, eateries and villages. It's surprising what you will see, and the prices are much better than anything you'll realise on Orchard Road!"
,,worth people watching,4.0,,nothing unique about most of the stores. it is just incredible that one city can host 5-10 of the same high end stores within 3 blocks of one another. to get a grasp of the locals...go to the asia market malls.
,,"international shopaholics, unite!!",5.0,,"Whatever you're after, from high-end luxury to high street chains, it's all here. my favourite shopping centee is ION Orchard, as everything is under one roof. in contrast to other shopping havens like Hong Kong, things are a little greener and more orderly. Lots of air conditioned havens when you need to escape the heat, but if yoh can stand the heat, do enjoy waltzing along Orchard Road, with the lush tropical foliage and surrounded by people from all over the globe.
The Botanical Gardens aren't far away if you want a spot of quiet after all that shopping!"
,,good shopping,5.0,,"Orchard road is the best place to shop in singapore - yes, it is high end luxury but there are affordable options too. Seafolly at Wisma Atria has the best swim wear - i love you can buy pieces individually so it is mix and match to your style and size."
,,Takashimaya shopping mall,5.0,,"A lot of variety brand clothes, assecories and food. I like the basement 1 supermarket and food stalls."
,,It's good to go :),4.0,,It's a nice place to roam around .. so many options for shopping and food .. all brands is available.
,,Good place to shop without crowd,3.0,,"Maybe this is personal, but i find the crowd around make the whole shopping experience tiring. Not so high class as imagined. Same shop repeating and repeating. Better off go to Suntec City or Vivo City"
,,Rich n Luxury experince,4.0,,"It was an great shopping experience at Orchard rd,Singapore.I was there with my friends.So many brand stores r there alongwith great malls.U wil get huge choice over there.Also i went to Seiko store.Simply awasom.We walked the whole Orchard rd n it was an great experience.There also we got many resturants n food stalls.Lovely yummy food.Over all it is worth visiting there"
,,Heaven for shopaholics,5.0,,"Wonderfull shopping even for those who are quite sceptical about new trands. The great variaty of brands, colors and sizes. Plus nice service."
,,An endless road of shopping centres,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a great place to spend the day walking around window shopping and exploring. Make sure you have comfortable shoes on. Much of the shopping centres along Orchard have the same stores in them except the ones like Lucky Plaza which have your cheaper stores in them. No problems in finding food or a drink along Orchard, just pop into a shopping centre and they all have amazing food courts with lots to choose from. If you go during christmas or chinese new year the street is amazingly decorated and lit up at night, and most of the other times during the year you will find something going on on Orchard Road. Do be careful crossing the roads as some of it is done underground and can be confusing so don't be afraid to ask someone for directions as most people are always willing to help."
,,your average shopping street,2.0,,"This one is certainly over rated, you have streets with malls all over the world now, so there is nothing extra ordinary about orchard road.
It has most of the fashion brands lined up and a few eating joints, but doesn't deserve any special mention.
Can be skipped if it's out of the way."
,,Shopping !!!,5.0,,"If you visit Singapore , you must come to Orchard road! Why? Shopping and Eating! The best recommend period is in December period? You can see beautiful lightings at night .. as chiristmas coming! Enjoy! :-} Sun"
,,Shopping during Lunar New Year,3.0,,"Chinese New Year in Singapore is fun, but practically all department stores close around 5 p.m. on 9 February, which is the eve of Chinese New Year, and they stay closed from 10th-12th and open in the 13th. Finding a taxi also begins to get difficult in the evening of 9 February. Therefore, those who plan to go shopping in Singapore may consider rescheduling for before or after during Lunar New Year."
,,Designer lovers walk.. poor mans window shopping street.,4.0,,Orchard road is known for its vast selection of designer brands and its prices. Unlike many destinations in Asia Ochard Road caters to the effluent locals who earns handsome salaries than the tourist who come to Singapore. But you do get tourist also buying from here. Orchard road is famous for Rolex watches as the main dealer also operates down this road and you could get good prices compared to many other locations.
,,Still a shopping paradise,5.0,,"Many malls have sprung up over the past years on the outskirts of Singapore, but Orchard Road is still the best place to shop. It has the best of everything. WHen you're here, don't go for hawker fare, but go for the fine-dining. Hawker food is better out of Orchard Road, and at more reasonable prices."
,,Main Shopping Thoroughfare,5.0,,Main shopping street of Singapore where there will be more foreigners than locals. Lots to see and do but cannot possibly be completed in a day.
,,One-stop Destination for Global Fashion,4.0,,"Orchard Road is famous in Singapore for 1) being in the Central Business District and 2) Offering a HUGE variety of shopping and dining options. It has cemented its reputation of being one of the key shopping streets in Singapore, for the upmarket, sophisticated crowd with a little bit more cash to spare. However, let this not mislead you into thinking Orchard Road is just another street, with no unique character - traces of the cosmopolitican Singapore city can be glimpsed, so long as you know where to look.

As a tourist, most likely you'll be visiting Takashimaya (the red, glossy building carrying major fashion labels such as Chanel, it's hard to miss unless you're visually impaired) for your branded goods fix and Ion Orchard as well, for its jewellery street located near the MRT interchange level at the basement. Yes, Orchard is known for its dazzling cluster of desginer gems and labels, and is a great place to get your designer fix, if the huge sales volumes from Chinese tourists are any indicator. However, we are not as well-stocked or cheap as factory outlets in Milan. If you come to Singapore, you might as well check out local labels such as M)phosis (available at 313@Somerset), max.tan, alldressedup and many more, scattered across the CBD.

For cheap perfumes, silks and tailoring, give Lucky Plaza a go. Locally, it has a reputation of attracting Filipino maids as well as Bangladeshi workers, so you may not see a lot of locals actually patronising the mall. It's a bit dingy by Singapore standards, certainly the building itself is old, but it is definitely the place to go if you want your perfumes on the cheap - one shop in particular would be Dollars and Scents. While there might be multiple issues of ethics arising from this - including parallel imports, authenticity - well, let's just say the prices are incredibly tempting. A cautious way of operation would be to go to the counter selling the perfume you're interested in at Takashimaya or Ion Orchard and taking a sample, then going back to Lucky to see if it matches.

All opinions from hereon are from the perspective of a cash-strapped teen. Most of the time I go with my friends to Far East Plaza, for cheap clothes (around $15-25, can rise to 80s depending on shop), accessories and shoes. Now this, my friends, is the TRUE fashion mecca for the stylish budget fashionista, melding a variety of styles, fashions, and cultures. Interested in demure, chic and office-appropriate Korean fashion? They have it. Love that satchel off from Vogue Britain? Chances are, there's an 'inspired' item somewhere in the rows of outlets. Obsessed with the edgy-glam rocker look? They have that, and more! From Mod to Sweet Lolita japanese fashion, this unassuming mall caters to all types of style and is an excellent place for those who want to try out a new style of buy a few key pieces for the season. Clothes can be one-size fits all, but most of the time it is fitted. If you need shoes (who doesn't need more shoes?) I recommend going down to the basement, where they sell stylish flats, heels and even booties which have a median price of $15. The cheapest I've seen is S$10. Quality-wise there is no issue, as the pair of waterproof booties I bought for travel to Milan during Winter last year held out pretty well under the onslaught of torrential rain and kept my feet dry. There are brick-and-motar stores for blogshops, too, for decent quality clothes with great sartorial statement.

Aside from clothes, Far East Plaza is also THE place to go for stylish tresses. (Yes, I do know I've been repeating the word 'stylish'). With a multitude of hairsalons from the basement to the upper levels - mainly level 4 and 5, you can end your gorgeous vacation and return back home rejuvernated, with vibrant locks. The prices do range from affordable to exorbitant, depending on the salon you patronise, but all in all if you're looking for the sort of cutting-edge (heh) makeover, the stylists there are pretty conversant with the latest hair trends and are well equipped to help you. In fact, some are so good you need an appointment a few days' in advance in order to secure a slot. Oh, and if you want hair extensions, you can do it here too, on level 2.

If you plan to go to Orchard, I recommend travelling to all the interconnected malls through the underpass for convenience - that is where the mrt interchange is, if you're wondering. Of course, a bit of Vitamin D will do you good if the sun is shining and you want to soak up the glitzy atmosphere of being on THE premier shopping strip.

For food, if you don't mind standing, I recommend going to Takashimaya's basement. The gelato is excellent, and you are offered a huge variety, from Korean street snacks to Japanese, and German cakes. If you want to sit, there are plenty of food courts around that area- sashay off to the basement level at Ion Orchard for their Food Hall. It's a little pricy, and the food average, but it's close to where all the major brands and good shopping is. Cafes and restaurants abound - I could go on but I fear this review is too long already. If you're at street level and the weather is scrotching, there should be a walls ice-cream vendor somewhere along the streets. Order cheap ice-cream in a block, wrapped by rainbow-colored bread or between two wafers, and plop down on a public bench lining the streets for a bit of people-watching, a smoke, or a rest.

Whether solo, with friends or family, Orchard is an excellent family-friendly place to visit if you're in Singapore. The wide streets allow great ease of access and maneuverbility for wheelchairs and baby buggies, and the toilets in major malls are pretty much sparkling clean. And if you are feeling particularly spry, you can make your way on foot from one end (Ion Orchard) to the other (313@Somerset). It's excellent exercise. If you're too lazy, there are plenty of taxi stops around but the queue will be pretty long so be prepared to stand a while. Of course, if you happen to visit in time for one of the major festivals such as Chinese New Year or Christmas, you're in for a visual treat."
,,"A ""Must See""",4.0,,"If you haven't seen it, Orchard Road is an incredible expanse of shopping, from high end designer boutiques to H&M. At least take a look while you're in Singapore."
,,No cheaper than home.,3.0,,"I went hoping to purchase a new handbag by Chloe. Unfortunately the one I want is not available in Singapore. Added to this other brands like mulberry Marc Jacobs, Mont Blanc all seemed much more expensive than England. So not the great shopping experience English people would be looking for. In addition it's incredibly busy in some areas on Sundays especially the queues for taxis."
,,Shop til you drop,3.0,,"If shopping's your thing then you'll be in heaven. If not, it's interesting if somewhat monotonous. We wandered through a few small and big stores but felt a little underwhelmed. I'm sure there are more enjoyable shopping experiences to be had in this city."

Tip: Carry a lot of cash or cards :p"
,,Shop to you drop!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is something not to be missed as well!!. Although I am not a shopper at heart...living in Singapore City may change my tune a bit. Orchard Rd is a very busy section of Singapore City, all major high end shops are located on this road and adjacent streets. The thing which stood out to me the most is the architecture and facades of the stores!...they are HUGE and very visually appealing, which makes you want to go inside....all very good advertising!!!. Another very interesting aspect of Orchard Rd is..McDonald's!!....there are small stand alone McDonald's kiosk on the curb side of the sidewalks, these places are very clean and tidy with table and chairs to have your quick meal, most regular food items can be bought here as well. Enjoy Orchard Road..it's a fun way to spend a few hours at!!."
,,ORHARD and XMAS is inseparable,5.0,,"my Christmas was awesome last year thanx to Orchard and its street decorations.

GOOD JOB"
,,Mind blowing Rd.,5.0,,Beats N. AMERICAN standards. Never seen so many malls and high end shops. Even NYCs fifth ave dosent compare. Worth a look and there are middle class shops too with delicious food in the food court.
,,Just a busy road,4.0,,For me Indonesian People who really not often to go oversea this place nice and you can enjoy good governance for this city. If you tired walk you can find a place to rest and seat at side of pedestrian. But you should carefully with your young children if you pass a sex toy store. They put a big ***do and make your child asking loud about that. Many luxury mall and shopping time for woman but not good for man wallet :)

,,Shoppers' Paradise,4.0,,"It is a 2.2 km long street that is the retail & entertainment hub of Singapore. Here you have the pick of expensive signature brands & less expensive & affordable ones in the many shopping malls which abound in this area. There are also a number of hotels & restaurants where you can dine in when you're tired & hungry from your shopping. If you're not shopping, it is also a good place to take a walk in the wide, paved & well decorated sidewalks specially more so in the evening when the lights are on. It was particularly lively when we were there because of the Chinese New Year with its colorful decors. Rain is not a problem(It was always raining in the afternoon
while we were there) because most malls are connected through extensive underground pedestrian walkways.Here you can literally shop till you drop!!!"
,,Experience the real joy pf shopping .,5.0,,"Thus road gives you almost all brands outlets . After London , i have seen so many brands again on a single road .

,,Better places yes,3.0,,"It is very clean on orchard road and a lot of chose to do in every kind of shopping, but i still prepare BKK and HKg for shopping as the prices is high here. A little good thing is that HRC is just near when you need to listen to some music"

,,Shopping Heaven,5.0,,"There are so many stores, restaurants, and hotels on this street you could spend the whole day wandering around. First off it is so clean and the sidewalks are very large so you don't feel like you are stuck in a crowd. They do a wonderful job decorating the street and making it an attraction in itself. I loved walking down Orchard Road I just wish I had more money to go shopping."
,,The essense of today's Singapore,4.0,,"The Singapore of today is really Orchard Road. Old Singapore still charms everyone China Town and a lot more but Orchard road is what modern Singapore is.
Some of Singapore's best malls, restaurants fancy and cheap, shopping and a lot more.
Among the best is Ngee Anne City, the main occupant of the mall is the Takashimaya department store.
I was saddened by the closing of my favorite book shop Borders a couple of years ago but in Takashimaya on level 3 is the 43000 sq ft bookshop Kinokuniya, now Singapore's best.
If you feel like a cold beer, go behind 313 Somerset to Discovery walk and visit Brotzeit. For breakfast stopover at one of the Coffee Club branches and have their Scrambled eggs with mushroom and pesto bruschetta.
There are 3 MRT stations and many bus stops connecting you to every part of Singapore."
,,"Come here to see, and to shop",5.0,,"Here you can spend as many hours as you want. You can eat at so many places in each shopping centre. There are so many stores. Maybe not so many budget places, but during sales you can make good bargains. Read online at the malls homepages to see which one fits you the most, or just try one by chance. If you don´t like it, go to the next."
,,The best Area,4.0,,The best for shopping but to far for looking all of Sin . Then i hv a living at Concorde Hotel on Orchard Road. Its a pretty good for me.
,,Shopping Central,4.0,,"After living in Singapore for the past 4 years, Orchard Road is ever expanding into the shopping commerical hub it is. New malls keep springining up, some making way from old to new. Nevertheless a great place to shop, eat, drink and be entertained. Do avoid busy periods such as Sundays or Christmas periods. If you're not one for large crowds it can get pretty cpongested during this time, so a little patience is needed. The Ochard MRT is a little under capacity given the size it was originally built to, but in comparision to other citiesw is generally very smooth."
,,Very similar,3.0,,"We started at the top of the road at ION Orchard and headed back towarda Singapura Plaza. A lot of the shopping centrea are the same, offering the same shops and a lot of those shops are expensive such as LV, Prada, Gucci, Rolex. The ION Orchard and 313 Somerset had a lot of more affordable shops such as Forever 21 and Topshop but we only got as far as 313 Somerset so there could have been more"
,,A Shopper's Mecca,5.0,,"Wonder of all wonders, a series of extravagant and diverse shopping malls the length of Orchard Road. If you are a shopper, or for that matter only seeking to browse, this is the location for you! I would start your trip by going to the Paragon Mall, and then crossing the street to the Takamashiya for a total experience. Shops from Dior, Harry Winston, Chopard, Miu Miu, Furla, Judith Leiber, Kate Spade,Hermes, Christian Laboutin, to name a few are all here. Stores open at 11 a.m. generally, although a few may open an hour earlier. Everyone must experience Orchard Road, it is totally amazing,,,and one can shop in sublime comfort, clerks will often ask if you wish to sit, ask if you would like a beverage...fantastic service in what is a fantastic city state. If taking a cab back to one's hotel be prepared to line up...its ever so civilized."
,,Orchard Road - Epicenter of shopping,4.0,,"Orchard Road is in a country know for its shopping. This translates into being able to purchase whatever you heart desires. From tailor-made suits and women's clothing, to electronics, to souvenirs, Orchard Road has it all. The prices here tend to be a little higher than in other parts of the city, I found. But, with everything concentrated to one road, shopping life is made for convienence in this area. Electronics had the overall best value, as compared to when shopping in the States.
It is the main road in singapore! Thousands of shops in really big shopping centers where you can find everything, supermarkets, restaurants, fast-food and all you need to buy! The best is enjoying the air-conditioning in the stores because outside it is really hot and humid (at least for temperates region inhabitants).
This activity is has been done by women's, but eventually shopping has becoming a new outdoor activity for men as well. In Singapore, it is a good opportunity to shop around at the Singapore proudly shopping district, Orchard Road. Which is known shopper's haven in Asia."
,,Shoppers dream!,4.0,,"The number of shopping centres here is amazing - but they all seem to have the same shops. We spent a few hours walking through them all and bought a couple of things here and there.

Its great value compared to things in Australia plus you can get the tax back when you leave the country - which is 5-7% (minus their fee of course!).

Its worth buying things like watches here as they are much cheaper than back home.."
,,Loveddd the feel of this place,5.0,,"One road you should visit ... What an amazing place to be in ....The streets , restraunt , mall , people , culture ... all so nice and diff here"
,,comfortable mall shopping,4.0,,"orchard road is like harbor center in hk. comfortable, cool, hassle-free. here are some tips:
- if you get hungry, i like the takashimaya food area (not the food court) but tako pachi area and the ones beside it. if food court, i guess food republic in wisma is fine
- if you get tired, go to the nearest osim store or any massage chair you see along the way
or better yet, go to kinokuniya for a relaxing read
- if you need to change your money, go to lucky plaza
- if the dept stores along takashimaya, wisma are pricey, take a bus down the road to OG. it's cheaper and nice choices too.
- for all-in-1 mall for brands i like, go to 313 somerset (forever 21, uniqlo, zara)
have fun happy shopping"
,,The biggest shopping mall in Asia :-),5.0,,Actually a long connected series of shopping malls in large buildings and underground. If you can't find what you want in Orchard it probably doesn't exist.
,,Must be See to be Believed,5.0,,"Talk about a consumers paradise. One high rise mall after another line both sides of Orchard Road. Puts the Las Vegas Strip to shame. Every high end store you can imagine (and some you can't) is located somewhere on the road. Every mall has restaurants and a food court. Many have full service Department Stores, including Marks and Spenser and several from Japan. Obviously you can't see it all and I didn't think the prices were anything to write home about, but this is certainly one of the great shopping streets of the world and worth a look."
,,Nice to see but overpriced,3.0,,"Orchard Road is nicely layout road full of malls! but the price is not as good as KL, HK and Jakarta."

,,Shopping,3.0,,"Nice city lights at night, a lot of shops and malls along the road. Must not go to Lucky Plaza area on Sundays as too crowded. S$1 ice cream is available along the streets. I choose to have ice cream wafer than sandwich. Lots of flavors too."
,,best road for shopping!!!!,5.0,,More than 5 shopping malls with thousands of shops and restaurants and always with a good vibe! The shopping malls look so classy and well designed.. Lots of trees and super clean! Orchard Rd is a MUST visit road in Singapore!!!
,,"Big names, huge malls, highest prices",3.0,,"I think that, before talking of Orchard road, one should think what sort of shopping he likes.
When I go shopping I know what I want and I'm looking for a good quality at the best price. Then for me Orchard road is just NOTHING! But I realize there are also people with 20/30,000 USD to be spent in one afternoon, like the Chineses that go in Chanel shop and take bags worth of 5 or 6,000 USD and buy them like my wife buys apples in a greengrocery. There are also women that like to spend their afternoon looking at Prada, Gucci, Chanel, L.Vitton etc.etc. Well: that is the place for them, that is a paradise for them................and the hell for the poor husband that must go with them.
Clear? However, in Orchard road there are also a lot of nice bar where you can sit, have a good coffee and a nicely done cake, while your wife ""clean"" her eyes."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Yes this is where people come to shop! Its gorgeous and well lit ant night theres so many shops and so much to see even if youre not a shopaholic you would love walking up and down this orchard road
,,Nice christmas ligthings,4.0,,"Nice Christmas decors.....totally retail outlers with nothing much to do except, shop, sleep and spent! Gets a lil boring with cosmopolitan city living on the frontier.To avoid totally on weekdays morning, lunch and evening due to the peak hour human and vehicular traffic. IF you are trevelling, please go by MRT. Do not take the taxis due to their extreme charging of additional charges."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,Shoppers paradise. Shopping mall after shopping mall. Christmas lights were nice. It was busy Christmas Day but an enjoyable atmosphere and walk along the closed section.
,,a good place for shopping,4.0,,"if you are a shopaholic,do come here.so many international brands are here.it is heart of singapore.so many eating joints are here."
,,Ok if you think of it as a museum of commerce,3.0,,"While I do appreciate a good shopping trip, I have to admit I got bored after about 30 minutes. It is interesting to have a bit of a look but on the whole it is completely inaccessible to the average person. Go here on day 1 and everything lwill look like a bargain afterwards."
,,i love this street,5.0,,"i love this street, it's more than what i can image, especially in the evening, you can hear the voice of lot of birds there! so amazing."
,,A lot of shopping,4.0,,"A lot of shopping on Orchard Road. Mostly name-brands, but some local brands too. A lot of high-end malls are situated along the road, most of them are typically crowded. A good place to go if you like people-watching, or want to shop the big brands. Things in this area are pricey though."
,,Best place to shop in S'pore,5.0,,"A must go for all tourist if you love shopping. Everything is here and you wiill need at least one full day to do meaningful shopping here. Probably the best place to check out especially during singapore sales period from Jun to Jul each year. Once you're done with shopping, check out the night sceneries and lightings around the shopping area."
,,Housekeeping,5.0,,"Good afternoon.

,,Chrismas Lights - Restaurants,4.0,,We have visited Orchard Road a few times as it is a good shopping with manyy wonderfull places to eat. The 4th of January was an added bonus of the Chrismas lights in the road. Absolutely lovely.
,,Too crowded,2.0,,"If you have come to Singapore to visit, I wouldn't waste your time in Orchard Road. It is uninteresting, generic and overly crowded. Go somewhere worthwhile such as Chinatown or Little India, both of which are full of culture."
,,"Shopping heaven on Orchard Road, Singapore",4.0,,"Recently in Singapore to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we were bowled over by the sales in the shops on Orchard Road. Christmas lights were still up so the whole experience had a festive atmosphere about it. Robinsons, Isetan, Takashimaya - department stores along this iconic street, where bargains were to be found. there is a lot more to see in Singapore and we did but this was a great place to start!"
,,Overpriced,2.0,,"After visiting a number of countries in the asian region, I can only say that the shopping in Singapore is a big disappointment. There is no shortage of shopping malls, but lots of the same shops are duplicated from mall to mall. Brand name and luxury items are overpriced compared to other countries in the asian and oceanic region. If you want to go shopping, forget Orchard Road and Singapore and consider going to Tokyo or Hong Kong.
I went to Singapore with the intention of spending a considerable sum of money to update my wardrobe. At the end of a week there, I'd only bought one pair of sneakers. Not only were clothes more expensive than in my own city (Sydney), but most of the shops were completely out of my clothing sizes and when asked, showed no interest in obtaining stock for me.
If you are going to Singapore for a holiday, forget Orchard Road, do your shopping somewhere other than Singapore."
,,Rip off....!!!!,2.0,,Hotel and shopping malls.....that's it's. Be cautious before shopping here everything is way costly. You will be ripped of your hard earned money by shopping in this area. You can just take a stroll. If you want to shop head towards bugis street...
,,fun,5.0,,We live off of Orchard..... gets crazy busy in the eves but fun to people watch. Lots of lights! Lots of money could be spent shopping if so desired.
,,"""Posh Area""",4.0,,"Orchard road is located with huge shopping centers and star hotels. Hotels like Pan Pacific, Marriot, Hyatt, Sherraton and many other popular hotels are located in this area. The place is much crowded. ION Orchard is a luxurious shopping destination located in this place. The street also has cheaper shopping centers attracting people from all over the world."
,,pretty lights,4.0,,"This is the place for a stroll in December with all the Christmas lights.

Shoppers paradise and open to late.

We were surprised when we got home that it was past midnight as the vibe on Orchard Road was that there were still hours to go in the night!

Squillions of people also were out and about too.

Hot as hades even this late in the evening."
,,"Shopping, shopping ... shopping !!",4.0,,"This place gets busy on weekends, but it doesn't open until 10.30am so you will need to be there then to beat some of the crowds. There are endless shopping malls, several joined by underground walkways and underpasses (like most of Singapore) and you could spend the day here without too much trouble. Bargains? ... not in this area, unless the sales are on."
,,Walking on orchard road on Xmas day!,4.0,,"Always busy, and not everyday you can walk on Singapore's mainstreet. The shopping centres are massive..if they don't sell it on Orchard, it probably doesn't exist."
,,Takashimaya Dept store check it out on Orchard Road Singapore.,4.0,,"As an international traveller, bring your passport to get a discount card for shopping.
The food in the basement levels is good.
There is also a currency exchange on the basement level near the food court. There are no fees for currency exchange.
Dept store is a bit pricey but there are sales."
,,THE shopping experience in Singapore,4.0,,"Singapore's prime shopping district. Best time to visit: June (mid-year sale) and December (Christmas sale). Noteworthy buys: crockery (Tang's and Robinsons), apparel (Robinsons, 313 Somerset), toys and perfumes (Takashimaya - but do compare Mustafa Centre first for perfumes)"
,,The top shopping area,4.0,,"The orchard road is the heartbeat of singapore tourists attraction. You can shop and dine within the area. This is singapore golden road where tourists come in the thousands each day. You must spend at least two days to shop around until your heart drop. There are plenty of highend malls and food courts are everywhere which cater to international foods etc. This the festive seasons, you can see chingay parade"
,,Mall after mall.,4.0,,Highly recommended place to shop if you are having a short stay in Singapore. Every brand you can think of can be found in one of the malls on Orchard Rd. All the malls are interconnected. It is easy to get lost in the world of endless shops. Sometimes you don't released you've entered a new mall.
,,"Orchard Road, The way to go!",4.0,,"Time to make over. But still with Ion Orchard, it makes the place, the ""IT"" place in Singapore. All favorite brands can be found with great eateries. The Christmas Decorations this year, sponsored by Hitachi makes the illuminations, best ever!"
,,Christmas time,5.0,,In 2011 I was in Singapore in November and their Christmas decorations are wonderful and on Orchard Road they they have so many wonderful decorations.
,,good enough shopping,4.0,,"Probably the main place to go to for shopping in Singapore. Personally like: ION, Wisma, Tangs, Paragon, Ngee Ann City, Mandarin Gallery."
,,Shops...shops...shops...and crowded,3.0,,"Orchard Road is where every single soul in Singapore hangs out! A place full of people, food and shops. It's crowded and traffic is horrendous if you are driving."
,,Welcome to the Shopping Belt,4.0,,"The Buzz of people around the area brings the buildings to life. Given that it is Christmas and the shops are decked out in extravagant decoration accompanied by jolly Carols, you almost wished that El Nino would hit and bring Singapore snow.

The best part about Orchard is that you can find cheap bargains at the buildings adjacent to the more grandiose malls. If you are travelling with kids, the malls have entertainment for them so that you'll be able to 'park' them while you shop."
,,Avoid unless you shop,2.0,,"The always crowded shopping district of Singapore; unless you have intention to buy branded good, you should avoid this place especially on Sundays where a lot of maids tend to visit this area. The prices being sold in the Orchard area has been marked up compared to other branches within Singapore. However, it is definitely worth to visit Orchard road at least once during Christmas season to see the street beautifully decorated to accommodate the season. Be informed, that usually around Christmas season, Orchard road is much more packed with tourists visiting to see the decorating lights."
,,Orchard Road - the Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"If you are looking for genuine branded goods, this is the place to go. There are also many eateries, spoilt with the choices of food."
,,Buying something?,4.0,,Well I'm not much for shopping - but if that is you thing - I guess this road must be heaven. You got a bunch of chops designer thingis and so forth.
,,Shopping paradise of Singapore,4.0,,"Shopping paradise for most travellers, including Singaporeans. Expensive but there's a great variety - clothes, shoes, books, food, bags, phones, and basically any possible shopping item. Always crowded. Extremely convenient though, MRTs and taxis are always readily available except for really long queues on weekends. Always full of festive moods with Christmas lightings and songs everywhere around the shops. Good place of a summary of a vibrant yet clean and green Singapore."
,,"""Asia's best for shopping"".",5.0,,"PRO: ~International brands, all under one roof. ~Shopping centres provide many ammenities. CON: ~Parking at some places maybe exhorbitant. ~Some F&B outlets charge a premium, better to dine at the cheaper food courts."
,,A mall is a mall is a mall,4.0,,"Yes, Orchard Road is worth checking out, in part to understand the rampant consumerism that's plaguing Singapore. There are malls on every corner (literally probably like 8 mall side by side), but they all have the same stores - Louis Vuitton, Chanel, etc etc. This is not exactly a cultural experience, nor would you find anything unique that you couldn't find in New York or London. But it's worth checking out because there's just not that much to do in Singapore anyways."
,,A well balanced street,5.0,,"It is nice to shop at the different stores on Orchard Road. There is a good variety of them – some high end brands and some reasonably priced stores. The street is neat and it is fun to just walk around, in case you do not want to shop. There are some very nice restaurants offering options of multi-cuisines also."
,,Shoppers' paradise,5.0,,"A must to all visitors to Singapore. Everything on this earth can be found in Orchard Road, including all the eateries, clothing and electronics. The beauty is all these are in 1 walking distance from each other. A real shoppers' paradise mall."
,,Always alive,5.0,,"Orchoard Road, always busy, always full of people, always full of live. There are some lovely shopping centres here like ION, Paragon, Centrepoint, Knightbridge, Plaza Singapura, 313@Somerset and many more. I love visiting Orchard Rd during Christmas time, it's always beautifully decorated even despite the heat and humidity always makes me feel quite Christmasy :)"
,,Christmas Lighting is up :),4.0,,"During the December each year when the Christmas Festival, along the Orchard Road, all the decoration and lighting is up and you can see the colourful ligthing and you will be able to feell the festive atmosphere. While you enjoying the lighting, you also can enjoy shopping around there. Have your partner and walk together to enjoy the romantic moment together, dont miss it."
,,So clean and hassle free,5.0,,"If you want shopping this road has everything and every store you can imagine,its a shoppers paradise,very clean and a no hassle street,loved it and my wife she loved the shops.."
,,SHOPPING,5.0,,This is the Fifth Avenue of Singapore. All the high end shops beautifully presented. For somewhere not no expensive I always stop of at OG on Orchard Road. They have a great range of ladies shoes.
,,crowded with nothing,2.0,,crowded. nothig special. nothing to eat except the expensiv western food. no snac or local foods are available here. alot of teenagers with play cold customes and a lot of show which are more suitable for teenager
,,Loves it,5.0,,"another spot to shop in Singapore. you can find luxury brands until cheap stuff along this road if u know the spot :). This place is well maintain of cleanness, it became too crowded during weekends. lights on everywhere, nice scenery at night. shop until you drop.. Halal food for Muslim is really hard to find near this place, i just bought a water for that."
,,Always full of atmosphere,5.0,,I was on Orchard Road recently when the Christmas lights were up and it was an amazing sight. Very well done and gets you in the spirit. Worth taking a photo or two to send home! I always enjoy walking around the area and soaking it in.
,,shopping and eating,5.0,,"wonderful and clean place to shop and enjoy the hustle and buzzle, wonderful shopping arcades to cool off in, great eateries in the arcades too, very easy to walk around"
,,A little too pricey for me,3.0,,"I was told that visiting Singapore without visiting Orchard Road would be like going to NYC and not seeing Times Square. Personally, I think they meant 5th avenue. All it is is high end designer shopping. My poor-broke-college-kid-traveler attire didn't fit in with the designer names. But I was there just after Christmas decorations went up - so it was very pretty.

Great if you love fashion - not great if you're super poor! I walked around and took photos is all."
,,Orchard Road in Singapore,4.0,,"It's great to come here in December, while the streets are decorated splendor to celebrate Christmas and New Year. this is the neighborhood for shopping believers, seems all the world's famous brands are available products in this shop."
,,Shop until you drop,5.0,,"Orchard Road is for shopaholics! It is essential to ignore any asking price, because competition is furious and only tne naive pay top dollar. Knock off at least 30 per cent and hold your ground. They work on fairly modest margins, so get a bargain.."
,,Superhighway for shopping,5.0,,This is a shopper's paradise! It has a wide range of brands from affordable to the most luxurious. Lucky that the Roberto Cavalli store was on sale when I went there.
,,Shopping Centre Galore,5.0,,Multitudes of shopping centre in one street. Even if you plan on nothing to buy you can walk and do people watching especially during this time as they have Christmas decorations all over Orchard road.
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,"More stores of all varieties, food of all types, and year round entertainment always there. Don't go expecting sollitude."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,No shopping center is cleaner with more options of high end stores than Orchard Road. One is never far from good food at any scale and price and never too far from some bargain basements. The people watching is greatest on the weekends when the multitudes and rainbows of peoples are out in their best displays.
,,one of the few streets you must see...,4.0,,"There are a few streets that you ""must"" see in the world, like 5th Ave in NYC, or via Condotti in Rome, etc... Orchard Rd is one of them, if you like the crowd and are shopping-addicted !
All major firms are here, massively... huge shops, shining lights all along this strip.
Every time I come to Singapore I reserve some time to simply walk the Orchard... I rarely buy, just window-shopping.
Great with XMas lights."
,,Good shopping,5.0,,"Lots of top class shops and also bargain shopping at Lucky Plaza, Far East Plaza etc. Two MRT stations as well as buses and plenty of taxis."
,,Singapore's Premier Shopping Street.,4.0,,It is the most updated and modern shopping district in the city. the best place for people watching too.
,,okay but a little overrated,3.0,,YES - Orchard road is great.. but a bit filthy in comparison to the rest of Singapore. There is construction going on everywhere and the high class stores blends in with basementshops privat market selling souvenir stuff en mass
,,love the shops,4.0,,"our hotel the holiday inn is along orchard road so we enjoyed our leisurely walks here, they were putting up the xmas trees when we were there and it was nice to feel the early xmas rush everytime we walk towards the sommerset train station. we were travelling on a budget so we enjoyed the window shopping.."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"When visitors come to Singapore, they know why this little island state is known as a shopping paradise when they visit Orchard Road. On a stretch of 3 km or less lies the shiniest, most glamorous and most expensive stores in the whole nation. All the big international brands are located on the best stretch of Orchard Road. There are excellent restaurants to be found as well. Salt is located at top floor of Ion Orchard, from this vantage point you have an excellent view of the city. Ask for a window table, away from the sky light, unless you like to wear a sun hat and sunglasses indoors.
If you're looking for a food court, you can find an excellent one at Wisma Atria. The basement in Takashimaya is a great place to visit for food, bakeries, cafes everything under one roof.
Tangs is 80 years old and the oldest department store in Singapore. Go there for for the best cosmetics floor in Singapore.
Mandating Gallery and Ion Orchard are new additions to the shopping scene. Paragon has anew wing and is still fairly cosy. Ngee Ann City seems to have all the biggest international brands under one roof."
,,The Main Drag,3.0,,"Shoppers for 'fine' things, this is your place to shop. The food courts are nice but, expensive, as compared to places like Bugis or Lavander."
,,Don`t know what the fuss is all about!,3.0,,"Orchard Road is just a very long,busy and overrated shopping destination.We in Australia and in many other large cities, already have the same brands,the same shops and even the same eateries you find there,we visited on a Saturday and it was crazy,mainly it was packed with locals and foreign workers,many of them mailing money home.We entered one of the malls and the stairs were clogged with shoppers (the lifts were not working) you could count on one hand the people that were actually walking with their head looking forward,90 per cent were texting...very unpleasant and almost unsafe"
,,Orchard Road,3.0,,"... a walk walk walk to nowhere and eat eat eat to get filled would be just fine in Orchard Road, Singapore."
,,"Orchard Road, Singapore",5.0,,"Orchard Road must be the premier shopping street in Asia, it is clean and orderly, packed with international brand names and local businesses too. From luxury goods to books and magazines, from high end restaurants to common-or-garden food courts there is something to please everyone in Orchard Road.
Just sitting at a pavement cafe and people watching while sipping an Earl Grey tea or drinking a iced coffee is pure pleasure."
,,Shopping,5.0,,Great place to shop and spend time with family and friends with some nice places to eat offering local cusine
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"If you wanna high end products, Orchard road is a paradise. Along the road, there are lots of designer shops. Even LV got 2 (or maybe more than 2. I am not very sure) big shops there. As for meal, the price at the foodcourts are pretty expensive due to high rental. During Xmas, there is xmas light up starting from mid/end Nov to 31 Dec and every year has different theme. The best time shop in orchard road is during Xmas and Singapore big sales as there are many promotions."
,,Great for Shopping and Dining,4.0,,"Endless shops and food outlets awaits. Be sure to visit Ngee Ann City Shopping centre. High end boutiques like Coach, Prada, LV will leave you spoilt for choices. There are also restaurants. My favorite is ""Imperial Treasure"". There are 2 branches in Ngee Ann City itself. Ion Shopping Centre is worth a visit as well. There are lots of different retail outlets."

,,Busy,3.0,,"shops, shops and more shops,no bargains, in December the Xmas lights are stunning but apart form that for me it is a no no."
,,wonderful place to time pass,5.0,,Yes it is the most busiest but fashionable street of Singapore. Passing time here from walking along the road is good fun and you find number international brands showroom for shopping but it is said that it is the costliest place to shop. The orchard road is well connected by Singapore MRT.
,,Do your research,4.0,,Can be overwhelming so do your research online first. Very repetitious. Lots of high end brands. You get lost and confused very easily as a lot of the malls are linked to one another so in the heat it's not great. As compared to Aussie prices there are no real bargains unless things are on sale
,,Malls... nothing else,2.0,,"Nice if you're a shopaholic needed a shot. Otherwise, I see no reason going there. Or, during the day that is, because at night you can have a lot of fun at Orchard Towers."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"The shopping meca! If you cant find something to buy here then there is something wrong.

Allow plenty of time to visit all the shops. There are some amazing shop window displays. Becareful of some of the cheaper food court types as we suspect one caused some sickness.

In all the shopping we did, only encountered one rude salesperson."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"For all shopaholics like me, this is the place to find all the brands. Of course the famous Ion mall, Paragon, nge yan city and tangs will make you really not in need for any other store. What ever brand you think you will be able to see it in that lovely stretch of 2 km. LVs, Gucci, Burberry, prada...etc. still you can find good food for all tastes."
,,For the shopaholics,5.0,,"Check out ION, Ngee Ann City - the 2 biggest malls along Orchard Rd. They house many luxury, mid-priced brands - bags, shoes, clothing, etc. The linked underground walkway - connects many malls together. Makes moving around easily & pleasant.

,,An awesome place to cruise and check out all the stores,4.0,,"Without a doubt and from all the times visiting Singapore, Orchard Road is the shopper's paradise...to a certain degree. If you came to Singapore with the desire to shop, this is the one place to go. There are so many shopping centers in this area I still can't believe it sometimes.
Needless to say, whenever here, I always make it a part of my regular visits (mainly for the food though). There's a really good bakery called Bread Society and can be found at one end of the really big shopping center called 'Ion'. This particular shopping center has some VERY high end retailers though (like Dolce & Gabbana, Gio, etc) so many of the stores I won't even think of going into. There are others that are nice though like my favorite, the Quiksilver store.
Anyways, there's certainly no shortage of places to shop at and dives to eat in so if you're a shopping kind of guy or girl, hit up this place. It's worth a look."
,,shop and eat till you drop,4.0,,mall and restaurant heaven.. if you have a lot of cash..then this is your heaven a lot of great mall on every side of this street a lot of restaurant too on every side of this street a lot of good hotel also..
,,"Malls, Malls and more malls...",3.0,,"Best way to see this stretch of shopping malls is to get off at the Orchard Road MRT, at the ION Orchard mall exit. If you manage not to take up the entire day walking thru all the shops at ion orchard alone, you can get out and start walking the length of Orchard road. It is lined with high-end fashion stores, most of them obscenely expensive. Though you can catch the occasional sale at places like H&M's and get great stuff at decent prices."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"The whole stretch from dhoby ghaut mrt to tanglin mall, it would take you more than a day to explore. Most people hangout here during weekends or after work to relax, shop and dine."

,,Every shop in the world is here,4.0,,"along with all the prices! don't expect great bargains here, Singapore can be cheaper for electrical goods but clothing can be more expensive!"
,,Oxford Street with heat,3.0,,"How many Prada shosp can you get in one mile? THe road is good for malls and... well, malls. From the Thai Ebassy to Dohby Gohat there i everythin to buy, local and international - but not as cheap as you would expect. Hot too, with the air con sometimes freezing. Beware the top end near Hilton Hotel at ngiht."
,,The Oxford Street of London,3.0,,"Didn't buy anything, but this vibrant road is full of up market shops. I accessed it via the hop on hop off bus on the original route, or LRT is Somerset.

Worth hopping off during the day to wonder around, but not sure I would go out of my way to go there."
,,Not cheap but good for window shopping,4.0,,This is not the cheapest place on earth but there's a few few novelty type place to make it interesting. Worth a day at least once in your lifetime.
,,Window shopping not much buying,3.0,,Got out at orchard station. What a nightmare. This road intersection can only be traversed by using the underground pathways. Pot luck if you come out where you intended. The hotel I stayed at previously has vanished and the street has taken on a much more high end feel. If you have time or cash to spare. Enjoy. Otherwise do your shopping elsewhere. I&M was the only store my daughter or excited about.
,,Exciting street with lots of great places to shop and eat.,4.0,,"Pick up some great bargains at Lucky Plaza, shop clothes and cosmetics in Tangs, Takashimaya or Robinsons, then head for a coffee at TCC or on the roof of the Marriot. Finish with a glass of wine in one of the lovely bars up Emerald Hill or the Cuppage Plaza and you've spent a very pleasant Saturday!"
,,O Orchard Road,4.0,,"I used to shop at HMV along Orchard Road, but then it disappeared! You will never feel bored walking along Orchard Road. If you are tired, either hop on to buses or go to the underground train station called MRT, otherwise enjoy your window shopping or feel the pinch in your pockets!!"
,,Many things to see and shop,4.0,,"There are many things to do and try at Orchard Road. There are shops for everyone from high end to the budget. There are many food choices to try. For example, if you like Indonesian food, go to Lucky Plaza. Otherwise there are many good restaurants or food courts in the various shopping centers. Orchard Road looks the best during the Christmas season when the entire road is decorated with lightning."
,,"shop, dine and stay!",4.0,,"When visiting Singapore, I make sure my hotel is located at Orchard. Why? Everything's there...shopping, dining, and mobility to go to places! Take a stroll from end to end and go to malls like Paragon, Nge Ann City or Ion Orchard. Plus you can easily go to Sentosa, Gardens by the Bay or Esplanade via the MTR which is in at least 3 locations in Orchard - Scotts Road, Somersett and Dhouby Ghaut."
,,Crowded,3.0,,"You can managed to find lots of international brands there, but the place is too crowded. During weekend or holiday season, you see human beings more than merchandises."
,,If you want to depart with your money..,3.0,,...this is the place to be. Innumerable amount of malls and galleries with stores each fancier than the next one. I personally chose not to shop at all in here - I'll go to London for the same brands for cheaper..
,,Great place to window shop !,4.0,,"Walked the length of Orchard Road during our recent stop over in Singapore. Quality stores and mechandise, but sadly out of our league. Only down side was the cheap and nasty Lucky Plazza complex with its sex shops, which was filled to the rafters with cackling Filipino women all screeching and shouting into their mobile phones. Dreadful place !"
,,Lots to do,5.0,,"Plenty of high end restaurants and food courts available at Orchard Rd. A lot of expensive shopping places here like LV, Gucci, Prada, Chanel, etc and during the Great Singapore sale & Christmas sale, there's lots of discounts at the department stores. Check out H&M, Mango, Zara, Forever 21, etc. Cineleisure is a popular place to watch movies and teenagers to hang out. Takashimaya basement is a food haven. Ion and 313 are good places to check out too. Very pretty at night, especially during Christmas. Great place to chill and relax."
,,excellent place for shopping,5.0,,"excellent place for shopping,if you go to singapore in December,you would be crazy for the promotion,haha ~"
,,If you got the money honey I've got the time!,5.0,,"Yes, all you're high end shopping needs are met on this stretch of road, and MULTIPLES of some stores are found here. Prada, LV, Gucci, Balanciaga, Bottega, Celiene...as well as Nikie, Zara, Cole Han, RL. It's an easy walk if you are staying on one of the many hotels on orchard road, but if you are at the Marian Bay Sands, no need to come this way unless you just want to see.

So if your luggage is every lost, come here to pick up a few items to get you by."
,,Everything is so big and lots of designer shopping to be done,4.0,,"Our hotel was just off Orchard Rd so most of our mornings and evenings ended up on Orchard Rd.
Lots of designer shops with very impressive window displays - although I didn't buy anything unfortunately to expensive for me.
There are however a lot of UK high street stores - didn't look at prices so not sure if there was a difference.
The one thing that jumps out at you is how clean everything is - every thing is immaculate.
Worth a visit even if it was only for window shopping!!!!!!"
,,Another long stretch of shopping paradise,4.0,,"Orchard Road is one of my favorite Singapore shopping strips, from bargain and tacky shops in some centres to an exclusive designer labels, complete with great eating places and banks everywhere..."
,,Night-time lights,3.0,,"Even if you don't intend to shop here, Orchard Road is worth a visit just for the experience, particularly at night.
Have an after dinner walk along the famous street to work off some of the fantastic Singapore food and take in the atmosphere. Bright lights, the buzz of the people, a bit of window shopping and all without the swealtering heat of the day. A very nice way to end the evening."
,,Good shopping experience,4.0,,"Good shops particularly ION mall, however items are quite expensive in department stores. We at at the food court at Takashimaya - food is ok if you're hungry otherwise not recommended"
,,orchard rd,5.0,,if you like shopping or even if you dont you can eat instead....the malls the shops just dont stop they go on and on and on forever....
,,Must visit for tourists or newbees,5.0,,"Central neighborhood for tourists sort of like the Time square of Singapore. Uber expensive shopping but you'll find every designer store you can think of from Louis Vuitton, Gucci,Armani,Hugo Boss, Tiffany s etc . There is a store in Ion Orchard that sells everything for $2.00 (sort of equivalent to US dollar stores) but you can probably get it cheaper at other places like Changi MRT shops etc.

The basement of Ion orchard mall has great cheap food. No need to eat out at expensive restaurants.

Great neighborhood for people watching even if you don't want to shop."
,,Window shopping,3.0,,Sell mostly branded goods. Hardly visited this place as a local. More for youngster or tourist. You;ve to spend lots of time here as too many branded shops and shopping centre ard. Can easily spend one day shopping.
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Lots of shopping malls along the road. It is so convenient for you to shop and dine. Also, you will see some mobile cart selling ice-cream sandwich. Durian taste ice-cream sandwich ... yummy!"
,,Shopping - Shopping - Shopping,4.0,,"My Wife is in heaven here. Running down to Somerset 303 this is a great area for shopping and people watching alike. There are branches of well known and local shops abound and something for everyone. Prices are very good compared with he UK and Australia, but slightly higher than USA. Remember to get duty free receipt for larger purchases as it gives around 5% rebate."
,,Shopping District in Singapore,4.0,,"if you want to shop till you drop, this is the place to be.
you can just take a walk to Orchard road from the morning and enter every shop and malls you want, until your soles swell and you feet hurts, hahaha. There's a lot of malls on Orcahrd road so better plan before you Go. There's Takashimaya, Ion Orchard, Paragon, Far East, Lucky Plaza, Centennial, 313 Somerset, and a lot lot more."
,,great for people watching and shopping,5.0,,orchard road stretches from Shaw center (Lido) to plaza Singapura. Visit Paragon and Takashimaya for high end boutiques. I used to buy MacDonald's takeaway from lucky plaza and have my meal on one of the benches along the road on a lazy sunday. There are many interesting sights and this is a good place to be if you like to have a greater understanding in the Indonesia/phillipines diaspora in Singapore.
,,"Very modern, full of top brands.",3.0,,"Orchard Road is a very modern shopping street with over 2kms of high quality shops and malls full of top brand shops. Unfortunately this has caused the area to look very similar to many other modern big cities. It's perfect for visitors who are into high price brands, but for normal people it has become simply a window shopping area. Only the slightly run down Lucky Plaza still carries a hint of the old Singapore character and charm."
,,Love it,5.0,,Orchard is always a nice place to visit. It is clean and has many nice cafés and great shopping alternatives. Access is easy by MRT. Weekends are crowded but during the day time on weekdays you can have a lot done.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Orchard road was great. Complete shopping malls ! From high end boutiques till the middle class shop. Environment also very clean. Simply love Orchard Road !!
,,Orchard Road! Not the best shopping,3.0,,"It is annoying that the shops don't open until 10am or later. The prices are about the same as in Australia so I didn't really find any bargains as such. It is a long Road to have a look at a lot of shops, so so if you have plenty of time go for it. not he best shopping place in the world but depends on what you are after. Take the city bus trip around and you can see where you want to shop as well. Hop on and off bus."
,,shopping!,4.0,,"it's actually a shopping area so not much else to do, but do spend at least a few hours to get in the atmosphere don't go to early though, as nothing is open before 10 o'clock!"
,,Nothing more than an avenue full of shopping malls,3.0,,"Some of the shopping malls are extremely luxurious with exclusive luxury shops. The prices there are generally higher than in Europe, despite the lower VAT in Singapore. The service is not always up to par with the prices. The buildings are however very nice, fancy, clean and look new.
Some other shopping malls cater more to average middle class buyers.
Some are quite old and look totally outdated.
It can be nice to go there to get a feeling of the shopping spirit in Singapore. However in none of them (be it on Orchard road or elsewhere), at any period of the year (Great Singapore Sale or not) can it be expected to make real bargain shopping."
,,A Shopper Paradise,4.0,,There is every type of goods available that any shopper would be looking for. We have visited and shopped in numerous Cities noted for their Shopping but Orchard Road has to be there with the best.
,,too much crowd,4.0,,"just a shopping holic can survive there. great place for shopping lovers and night life be careful, i have seen a woman thief running in front of my eyes with stuff stolen from english guy, all his passport, money, gold chain, hotel keys, wallet etc, and that english guy was chasing her behind like mad and panting."
,,happening place,4.0,,dont miss this place during your stay one of very good place for shopping lovers there are many malls around
,,Topnotch Shopping District,5.0,,"The world famous Orchard Road is a shopper's ultimate dreamland. From the designer's brands to the (relatively) cheap clothing, this road offers anything from both ends of the spectrum. One can also find electronics, bookstores, gyms, and most especially a pleasantly several food cuisine ranging from local to Western. Everything is literally here. One day is certainly not enough when visiting the malls along Orchard road. If you're not into shopping, it's also nice to spend the night away here."
,,Great for a Day Out Shopping - but nothing special in terms of bargains,3.0,,"orchard road is lovely for a shady stroll of shopping - and there are many many shops and malls - with both mainstream and upperclass shopping experiences, however i wouldnt say the prices are cheap! they are abut the same price as home (for australians), so as long as your not looking for a suoer cheap bargain you will enjoy youself."
,,Glamours,4.0,,"This street so famous for many big mall such us ION, Ngee An City, Takashimaya etc. My impression when I walked along this street is Hot thanks there is a bench so you could take a rest for a while. For me who traveling on budget this street only great for sightseeing and if lucky to get some discount. Don't forget to try the Ice cream you can find the guy who sell it along this street and it's soooo good and it's interesting too you can see the guy slice the ice and they will ask do you prefer bread or wafer.if you bring a lot of money than this is for you but if you on budget it's still Fun only walk,sightseeing,see the people and use all your senses and make some opinion about this place"
,,Only if you like shopping,4.0,,"If you love to shop, then this is the place to go, there are so many shops, ranging from the very expensive to the slightly dodgy cheap elevtronics places."
,,Another great shopping street,5.0,,"This compares to the best street shopping in the world. If you are into all this, or your kids like looking at clothes, worth a visit. Plenty of western style restaurants here too."
,,"A Must See, but be prepared",3.0,,"Maybe Singapore's Rich and Famous find it very interesting to find five Guccis, ten Pradas, eight Vuttons, six Omegas, three Vertus, twenty Starbucks and multiple shops of all those brands you see everywhere, stacked away in five outrages malls on a stretch of no more than two kilometers. But honestly, if you've seen one, you've seen them all. When dropped there blindfolded, you wouldn't be able to tell if you are in Singapore, Rome, Paris, New York or any other large city. So, if you're prepared and can stand the incredible waste of money and energy, then go there to have yourself amazed. If you can't, stay away."
,,Really vibrant,4.0,,"A different feel by day and by night. By day there are an extensive number of shopping ""towers"", but night there is a really vibrant energy to the road. Can't come to Singapore and not visit. Try using the MRT to get around, though taxis are cheap."
,,An absolute MUST,5.0,,"If I had to choose an absolute must when visiting Singapore, Orchard Road would be it. I once read a comment by an English teacher who worked in Singapore. He said, “Living in Singapore was like living in a giant shopping center.” There is a lot of truth in that statement because there are shopping opportunities everywhere in Singapore, and Orchard Road is the heart of it all. You can find everything here from luxury department stores to movie theaters and bookstores. We especially enjoyed the Kinokuniya Bookstore at the Takashimaya Shopping Centre, and the Hard Rock Cafe."
,,Shop until you drop or run out of money,5.0,,"Orchard street is a long street filled with shopping malls on both sides of street. If you like mall shopping, this is the place to go. There is a good mix of low and high end shopping venues. I didn't know what to find on Orchard street and now I know!"
,,Shopping paradise,4.0,,"The whole stretch of Orchard Road is all about shop and dine. I would prefer to shop for books at Borders in Wheelock Place, movies in Shaw House and dine in just outside Wisma Atria. Do visit there in December which there are lots of street lights enlighten the whole road up to Raffles."
,,High end shopping to street style fashion~,3.0,,"At the moment there is a lot of construction going on to create faceless, generic malls. There are hardly any interesting little shops left and it's hard to get around or across the road, you are forced down into underpasses. It's better to go to Bugis street for more interesting shopping…"
,,Too expensive,3.0,,"This area of Singapore had a lot of famous shops and name brands but they were all too expensive for me. I did however like the Lucky Plaza where I could find a lot of cheap souvenirs. If you want to pay top dollar for top brands, then this is the place to go. Sundays however might not be the best time since it was packed that day."
,,Long walk at Orchard Road - shop & dine,4.0,,"Orchard is one of the best and bust roads in Singapore where lots of fun, shop and dine can happen. It's refreshing to walk slowly, and see the nice places around, especially in the evening when lights are all glowing. It was fun at Orchard."
,,great place for shopping & meeting up with people,4.0,,"all the shopping centres and malls line the streets of Orchard Road. so you can literally shop till you drop. there is something for every budget. there are also many eateries so one is spoilt for choices. orchard road is conveniently located and serviced by Orchard, Somerset & Dhoby Ghaut mrt stations."
,,Always here.,4.0,,"I live right off the road, always go here. Whatever shops you want, good restaurants. Always busy and fun. Only complaint is the birds make a lot of noise in the evening."
,,Not Sure I Get It,3.0,,"What you think is based on where you are from I guess. Being from the US the prices for even routine items are very high to way too high. Staying/Working in Orchard and have spent sometime walking the various plaza's and I have not seen a deal yet I could not get a way better price in the US. Again, I think its about where you are from. In reading the reviews people from Europe and Singapore say they are great deals. Oh well. BUT it is a site to be seen. Come on by and walk the plaza's"
,,"""Orchard Road, a shopper's paradise!""",3.0,,"At Orchard Road, you will find all that you need! There are so many malls to choose from, and we chose Lucky Plaza to buy souvenir items like t-shirts, key chains and magnets! There are also stores that sell perfumes at Lucky Plaza but I suggest that you buy at the Duty Free stores in the airport, it's cheaper there."
,,A MUST!,5.0,,Many people believe that travelling is mainly for having some rest. Singapore combines everything and a place that someone has to go when they visit Singapore is Orchard Road where all the shopping centers are and someone can have the best shopping experience in very good prices!
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"I personally don't like shopping but being in Orchard Road had me going crazy with all the amazing stores and malls. Truly a remarkable shopping experience. Prices maybe a bit a high but quality of clothing and electronics sold along orchard road is quite good. Apart from the excellent shopping adventure provided in Orchard Road, the variety of food sold here is also brilliant. From Korean to Mexican to Indian, you name it - a whole bunch of delicious cuisine can be found at Orchard Road. Definitely recommend orchard road to all you shopaholics :)"
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Shopping paradise, need I say more? You can get pretty much everything here. From high end shopping to street style fashion, you can walk out of this place all decked up like a fashionista."
,,Frantic!,3.0,,A shrine to consumption and could easily be left out unless you really love shopping. Made us feel like rats in a trap when we entered some shopping malls.
,,not sure of the attraction,3.0,,"Having heard about Orchard Road for so long, I could not see the attraction of loads of expensive shopping Malls and I am please we stayed nearer to the Marina. We did do Hard Rock Cafe one evening and that was good, the kids got thier badge guitars and glasses which they now have a large collection."
,,So many shops!!!,4.0,,"Amazing shopping experience, so many shops to choose from! Easy access using the MRT stations and the cooled shopping centres are brilliant."

,,Shopping belt in singapore.,4.0,,Most of the big brands like LV GUCCI YSL MIU MIU PRADA can be found here and it is consider a high end shopping area but you can still find some middle priced range shopping here as well.
,,Great,5.0,,"The main street of the City with shops, restaurants and anything you need. Stay at one of the hotels maks your life very very easy."
,,Fun for a stroll,3.0,,"Strolling up the wide pavements of glittery Orchard Road is a fun way to spend a couple of hours. There are plenty of places to eat, drink, and rest. All the big names and luxury brands are here.
Some of the shops are more interesting for a Western person to look at, such as the Japanese department stores; also check out the food courts to get a sense of the different cuisine. But as other reviewers have noted, globalisation has made most shopping quite generic and homogeneous. A couple of hours here are all you need."
,,so many shops!,5.0,,Shopper's delight. Where to start?!! From designer brands to huge shopping malls. You could get plenty of shopping done in this one area alone. Worth a visit if you love to shop!
,,all new to see!,4.0,,orchard area ever changing landscape and new malls are a must for locals and foreigners to take a visit!
,,Excellent Shopping,5.0,,The shopping is wonderful with all the brand names you can imagine. Plenty of 4&5 star hotels within in walking distance and the night life is robust and exciting!

,,One of the Best Shopping Areas in the World,5.0,,"This stretch is one of the best shopping areas, not just in Asia, but perhaps in the entire world. Shopping has sometimes been defined as the single standout tourist activity in Singapore. If so, the Orchard Rd. stretch is the best of the best. There are both upscale and local shops with everything in between. There are small shops and large department stores such as Takashimaya. There are simple local malls and elegant world class malls. Along with some very interesting shops, there are also great restaurant choices. It is accessible by Metro as there are two stops on either end of the stretch. There are such a plethora of browsing and eating opportunities that you can easily spend an entire day or more. A visit to Singapore is not complete without spending some time on Orchard."
,,Shopping On A Global Scale,4.0,,"Orchard Road really is a great shopping street. However, in this globalised and inter-connected world there probably isn't anything here that you can't find in in your own city or mall.

Whether or not it is better value than hone, is something only you know.

All in all, Orchard Road is a nice day out. Even if only for people watching."
,,Stroll,5.0,,"Had dinner and decided to head on down to Orchard to witness the change.True and thrill with the tremendous face lift and shopping mall over in the left and right. Notice there upgrading for human traffic as well via underpasses.
Great ambiance and lots of sales going on with lots of Pub and eateries all over.
Guess it will never be a fuss for shopping and charging yourself up again with wide varieties of foods.
Will visit AGAIN during X'mas time as heard the lights up are must see."
,,Great shopping,3.0,,"Great area to go shopping, you will be ble to view all the major brand stores, we found the best Tim to visit was before 3ish as it was very busy after that time.

,,All the shopping,4.0,,"With loads of Malls and shops, underground crossing for the rain, this is a great place to shop. The big brands were the same price as in Oz, but a lot of the surrounding shops have good deals. Its worth seeing even if you dont need anything."

Shopping Tip Mustaphas in Little India.Open all night and full of no name brands.Got half price cosmetics there."

,,Upmarket,3.0,,"Lots and Lots and Lots of stores. You can spend an entire week here and not step into a store twice - no kidding. But don't expect bargains galore, this is not chatuchak. This is Rodeo Drive with a smattering of slightlyl older malls with smaller shops."

,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,"This road has so many shopping centres on it, if you can't find something you need, then you must walking around with blinkers on. It has the real top end items and there is still a couple of centres that are fighting the upgrades, that a lot of these shopping centres go through and things in between. Plaza Singapura is a personal favourite but at the moment it is going through an upgrade."

,,even if you don't like shopping,4.0,,"If you don't like shopping go for a stroll, wonderful to see all the people buzzing about. Could just sit here all day watching the crowds. For shopping I don't like it - there's just too much. I prefer quirky places like Little India and Chinatown."

,,It's a shopping street,3.0,,Probably not the place to take kids unless they are into BRANDS.. You have all range of cost from low budget to super rich. Nice to see but wouldn't go out of my way to see it. There are plenty of other good shopping centers around Singapore.

,,busy,4.0,,A superb range of top quality shops which however do charge top prices.You need to have plenty of cash to buy what you could certainly buy cheaper elsewhere.
,,Pleasant but Expensive,3.0,,"The road is chock-a-block with the leading brands of the world and a few malls apart from some key hotels. The convenience factor is there in terms of finding all the brands here, but they are quite on the expensive side as they do not need to offer much discounts given the high volume of sales already happening anyway!"
,,1 day isn't enough,5.0,,I think 1 day isn't enough to explore the Orchard Road. My favorite is Ion Orchard.
,,Great for Shopping,5.0,,Lovely road with great shops. Safe and good rates on a money changer! have to see when in Sihgapore!

At the moment there is a lot of construction going on to create faceless, generic malls. There are hardly any interesting little shops left and it's hard to get around or across the road, you are forced down into underpasses. It's better to go to Bugis st for more interesting shopping"
,,shopping shopping shopping,5.0,,"dislike it too crowded. like it convenient. it's paradise of shopping, international cuisines. it's even more fun after sunset. clubs and pubs are along the road!!"
,,You will find whatever you need.,5.0,,"Fantastic shopping street with amazingly high prizes. Being a Norwegian i should be used to paying high money for clothes, electronic, photo gear etc but have to say this beats it :-)
Do not use the money changers they rip you off. Visit Coffee Bean for a nice break and enjoy the view of thousands of people stressing by eager to spend their money."
,,"Very expensive stores, but fun to see the beautiful people",5.0,,"You will see some of the most spectacular looking people walking down Orchard Rd. Many events and parades are featured in this area. Lots of upscale shopping and prices to match, but you can find pretty much anything down Orchard Road. We liked the ice cream venders the best :)"
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Plenty of shopping centers, expensive. I preferred the markets at Bugis and Chinatown."
,,city lights,4.0,,excellent place for branded shopping...and hang around..i recommend you to go on evening time
,,Shop till you drop.,4.0,,"Orchard Road has changed so much since I first walked it in 1976. A lot of the old charm and warmth has gone, along with the old car-park restaurant. However, the new glass and chrome facade is a shoppers dream. I'm not into the new Mall type shopping but I found Orchard Road had a better layout and style than any similar (?) area that I've been to. For the adventurous, plenty of local food outlets to satisfy the palette. For the less investigative diners, lots of small McDonalds and McCafes to keep the belly happy. Also, try a walk up and down Scotts Road. There is an older style shopping plaza, The Far East Shopping Plaza, that has some quirky shops and a great little Thai Food place up on about the third or fourth level."

,,Shopping and more shopping,4.0,,If you are into shopping or even browsing it is the place to go. My daughter and granddaughter loved forever 21 and H and M. Prices are okay clothing just a bit different from back home
,,Shopping malls along the road,4.0,,"This is a place where you can find all the shopping malls located, from orchard to Dody ghaut. Alight at Orchard MRT and you can walk slowly up to doby Ghaut, there's not only shopping malls along the road and food court and resturants. Very exciting and interesting, worth going."
,,Crazy,3.0,,"This place is insane, soooo many shops, most of them are very high end so you need deep pockets.
There are definatly better bargains to be had off the beaten paths.
One of our favs was mustafa in little india they have everything and at great prices."
,,Great place to shop,5.0,,Although it was raining day we visited it didn't put a damper on our shopping. This road is full of shopping centre and people everywhere.Drink and ice cream stalls along the road which is a great idea as it is so humid. There are a lot more up market shops so just to go for a visit is an experience in itself.
,,A shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Wear good shoes as you will be walking alot to ensure you see everything. We were there for the great singapore sale and there were some bargains to be had but sadly not from coach or gucci - Australia is cheaper.
A must stop for anyone who enjoys shopping or people watching, I think shopping must be a singaporean national sport as men enjoy it as much as the women.

I would say a few hours are needed at a minimum. Fantastic food also in this area to gain more energy to contunie shopping.

Enjoy"
,,If shopping is your thing...this is about as good as it gets.,5.0,,"Every designer you can imagine is represented here. The streets are clean, safe, and easy to navigate. Remember, however; that if you have access to these stores in the US, there is NO bargain to be had. The prices are cheaper in the US. All-in-all, a very nice experience, however."
,,One-stop centre for shopping,4.0,,Everything and anything you want can be found in Orchard Road so it's no wonder travellers go here for a one-stop shopping experience. Orchard Rd has everything from high-end luxury brands at Ngee Ann City and Ion to lower-end shops at Far East Plaza. Loads of cafes and restaurants to choose from and a couple of cinemas too. There's no need to go anywhere else for shopping.
,,Center of Singapore,4.0,,"We loved the location of this road that we decided to stay in one of the hotel here. It is great for people with various interest i.e. It has great choice for shoppers, good place for tourist to stay as it is centrally located..."
,,Still the most popular shopping area,4.0,,can choose from top to low grade items from Orchard Road
,,Extraordinary shopping,5.0,,"If you like Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton stores, you will adore this place. Very busy, money money money. Unbelievable to see how much money Asia has. We are used to Kensington in London where we thought there was plenty of money. This Orchard Road gave us a completely new outlook on what money truly is ! Worth visiting as long as you have the money"
,,Orchard Road Review,4.0,,"It's a nice shopping street, probably the best (according to me) in Singapore with departmental stores like Seven-Eleven and many other brands to shop from in 6 different malls ! It's a nice place"
,,Look for the specialty shops,4.0,,"Of course you'll find many flagship stores of the big and expensive brands, but in most of the malls you'll also find many specialty shops (e.g. on traveling, golf, lifestyle) that you do not find in smaller cities. Nice to visit!"
,,Shopping place,4.0,,"Orchard road is all about shopping, cinema and food court. Not much for kids. Great for those who want to window shopping, go to hospital. But for kids it really not fun I guess."
,,Excellent choice of shops,5.0,,Orchard Road is as they say is a main part of singapore shopping and they would be right you can find just about anything here including a good information centre if you get off at the sommerset m r t station. If you are looking for a choice in places to eat then you will find a good selection here on orchard road and it's an easy place to get to by either bus or m r t.
,,Excellent choice if you have a lot of spare cash,5.0,,"I have never seen so many high quality shops in one place. If you can't fnd what you're looking for here, yoiu'll never find it."
,,"If you are into shopping, here it is.",5.0,,"I'm not into shopping, but the wife is. Still an amazing place. An entire street of shopping malls with everything and anything that you could possibly be after. Make sure you have room on the Credit Card.
Takes about 45 minutes on the MRT from Changi Airport and costs $3.10 Singapore for a single journey. If you have a few hours layover in Singapore go and have a look. If you hand your ticket back into the machine you get a dollar back, so not bad for about four dollars return."
,,Love to stroll down this road,4.0,,"This is the main hub and expensive area of Singapore. The tony shops, restaurants and hotels are in this area"
,,stop till you drop,5.0,,"Whole stretch of shopping opportunities line this road but the good thing is you needn't walk the entire stretch if you are looking for the standard brands like Zara, Mango, etc because many major Orchard malls carry them. Ion is relatively new and you can spend a whole day there. Great pity that bookshops are fast disappearing and you won't find as many around today. Check out the food hall at the basement of Takashimaya, Ngee Ann City for different food from all over the world. Worth a trip even if you're not planning on buying anything."
,,Awesome shopping during GSS2012,4.0,,Three days was not enough for a shopping trip. We did not even have the chance to visit some of the shopping centres on Orchard Road despite staying right in the middle of that area. Minimum stay for shopping would be at least 4 days.
,,Nice,4.0,,"An asian happy street.Much like Tokyo.Full of nice street shows and shops.Nice shopping malls and Hotels. Hard rock cafe, Marks & Spencer, Zara, Centerpoint,..."
,,Just ordinary experience,2.0,,"First time I saw this place, I did not have interest too much. When I entered one of the shop, I was more not interesting. If you want to get a pleasant shopping experience, sorry, it's boring. It is not as good as the promotion. I saw the better place before."
,,Guess what .............,3.0,,"Its a road, with lots of shops on it (restaurants too!)"
,,Walk walk walk,4.0,,Clean roads and and a very safe place to walk late at night. It's easy for getting here and there by using the MRT. Shopping mall wise are pretty much the same for all.
,,Typical Shopping Road,3.0,,Orchard Road is the typical shopping road in any large city.
,,Fun but please stop the same dull designer outlets,3.0,,"This is a great street but is being ruined by the repeat, repeat and repeat of the same dull designer outlets. Oh wow another LV shop, come on put some unique shops in it. Ion is fun as is the food court and as noticed elsewhere there is some fun people watching to be done. It is very lean and feels very safe.
Oh their goes another LV shop. It's a bit like McDonalds in Singapore."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,Whatever you want. You will get it. In style and with lots of food and fun
,,Window shopping paradise,4.0,,"Wonderful place for window shoppers. Luxury at its best, therefore, have your credit cards ready with huge limit if you intend to go further than just watching windows."
,,"I don't understand the big deal, other than the Christmas lights",4.0,,"We've been here a ton, and I can't deny that I've shopped a lot on Orchard Road. I know the high class shops and import shops are a big draw for some people. But everything is so overpriced, and it is extremely noisy/crowded/crazy. Over the repeat visits we make to Singapore we find ourselves gravitating to Clark's Quey or Robertson Quey, or the Bughis area, or Holland Road.

The only time it's worth going to Orchard Road IMO is if you are shopping for an original LV purse or if it's Christmas and you want to see the festive lights."
,,and they say...shop til you drop??,5.0,,"Bring the Gold Card and GO!! If you enjoy (or not) shopping, this is the place! Orchard Road is several kilometers of shops and shopping centers (Malls). If you cannot find it there...it likely does not exist in the fashion world. Sun Tec city and Sim Lim Plaza for electronics."
,,To get the maximum benefit,3.0,,"It has to be worth checking which mall/shopping centre has what. I wanted to visit the Kinokuniya store which meant locating Ngee Ann City. Yes, that is the name of the shopping centre."
,,nice shopping,4.0,,everything u need in 1 location really enjoyed the atmosphere and everything is so clean and tidy
,,A fantastic place to people watch!,4.0,,We had an enjoyable afternoon walking up and down the length of Orchard Rd in the Singapore heat. There's plenty to look at and eat!
,,Sensory Overload,5.0,,Not enough money on my credit card limit for this street. The Singaporean's know how to shop and design wonderful shopping malls.
,,"Fabulous if you love shopping, or just looking!",5.0,,"All the world brands on display, but also more "" local"" , like in Lucky Plaza, with souvenirs, jewellery, and the diversity of Singapore workers, especially on a Sunday, all out and about, meeting friends, and having fun"
,,Orchard Road is Amazing,5.0,,"I just love Orchard road. Its so clean and you can find almost anything. With the underpasses its so easy to cross roads and the atmosphere is great. The one thing I love is a small vendor outside Lucky Plaza that sells juices, called Juice with an Oomph. The best mango juice I tasted. If you coming to Singapore I think you should stay in a hotel on Orchard."
,,Fun fuN fun,5.0,,Great for shopping even found a few bargains delicious meals & lots of shop options!!
,,Maybe can found a good deal if SGS,3.0,,Dont experience anything special. Just street with many malls
,,SNOB STREET.,5.0,,I need not go to orchard road anymore. I can find all the same brands in many other countries too. Prices are not competitive too. Sinagpore was a shopping paradise but no more.
,,Shopper's paradise,4.0,,Do not bring your wife here! Leave your credit card at home or be ready to face the consequences.
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"Orchard is like Madison Avenue or Rue San Honore stacked in Malls. There are all the best shops like Hermes and lots of unique botiques, food stops, public art and as you shop you can stop for a foot massage. The big hotels like The Marriott and The Hyatt are along here and both have good restaurants where you might rest up for more shopping. ."
,,Shopping,5.0,,"Take an umbrella. great place to walk, shop, and eat. Extremely clean, friendly and as safe as anyware in the world."
,,shop till u drop,4.0,,"huge amount of shops from high end (zara, lous channel,etc etc) to market style ( lucky plaza ) excellent food hall in Ion shopping mall. transport excellent with the subway"
,,Still the charming place for shoppers,3.0,,"It's the third time I have been to Singapore and Orchard Road still has that shoppers' charm. It is a convenient place to walk around even at night because of the sprawling hotels and malls next to each other. It is also easy to get there by bus, MRT and taxi. There are plenty of food outlets to choose from if you want to have a good bite. But if you're into serious shopping of high-end, branded products then this is the place to be."
,,Go late afternoon,5.0,,We went mid afternoon and shared a pod with a dozen others. The views were lovely. By the time we left we could see the queue had entirely gone and families and couples were getting a pod to themselves. Next time we'll time it for around 5 -6 pm and see the city lights come up.
,,Nice Place to spend time,5.0,,"Even if you don't want to shop since everything seems to be very expensive in Singapore, its a lovely way to pass your time and do some window shopping and see the beautiful malls around on Orchard Road, we use to walk around every evening and then go and eat in one of the malls."
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"Orchard Road used to be the place where one can shop leisurely and take in the sights but not anymore.

The place has been overrun by large unruly crowds where there is hardly any space to walk, let alone browse leisurely.

Most of the shops appear to be selling the same standard overpriced items with sales staff unable to understand not serve customers. The F&B outlets are no different with rude and oftentimes non-existent service."
,,Shopping in Orchard Road,4.0,,Plenty of cosmopolitan shopping sometimes very over priced especially in the up market stores. Most inexpensive are found in the smaller shops. Great Service.
,,Great shopping,5.0,,Walk down the whole street to get good deals. The plac has many shops and restaurants. Also try out the Mustafa centre - open 24 hours !!
,,Beautiful Street,4.0,,"Loved Orchard Rd, even though most things were way above my price range. Found shopimg at ION Orchard very reasonable and as we were there for the Great Singapore Sale we picked up some great bargains."
,,Connected shopping malls,4.0,,Loved the fact that all of the shopping centers very connected underground - definately helped beat the heat.
,,Browse and Cool Off,4.0,,"If you are an upscale shopper, this is your Mecca. For the rest of us who don't fancy paying $1000US + for a simple cocktail dress, it is a fun place to visit! I can't lie, my favorite thing was the fact that we could escape from the heat and humidity...didn't realize what a luxury air conditioning was until this trip."
,,Fashion and hookers,4.0,,"Orchard Road has all the big fashion houses, Rolex, Chloe, Channel, etc. and these are the real thing with prices to match. Next to the Orchard Hotel is hooker heaven."
,,Unbelieveably great shopping district,5.0,,"You can't beat this area for amazing stores, food and sights. The shopping center continues underground for several levels! There you will find amazing places to eat, rest and shop 'til you can't take it anymore. Every possible store imaginable throughout the area. Easy walking; then you can catch the subway to your next destination!"
,,Great for shopping,4.0,,I've never seen as many malls in one places as on Orchard Road! Great place to do some shopping or to go to the movies.
,,Shopping haven for shopaholics,4.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopping haven for shopaholics. It's a long stretch of road filled with shopping malls and hotels, side by side, opposite each other. Was not able to check out all the malls as it will have to take days before I can finish going to all of them.
I made sure to check out newer malls such as ION Orchard and 313@somerset. Prices of items are not the cheapest in Asia but the variety of shops give shoppers many options. Restaurants and cafes abound too. At night, the strip bustles with life, restaurants packed with people, streets well lit, with fancy cars passing by.
Visitors need not buy anything to enjoy the strip. Just have a relaxed stroll and enjoy Orchard Road at your own leisurely pace."
,,Don't go on a Sunday,3.0,,This whole area is full of shops packed with people on a Sunday I thibkn it is to do with this being a lot of peoples only day off so it is so busy
,,Similar to Australia,4.0,,Prices and types of shops were mostly the same as what is available as in Australia
,,An unpleasant attack on the senses,3.0,,"Obviously, shopping districts are not my favourite destination. But at least, you expect to find bargains in Asia. Not so in Orchard Road, Singapore. For a nice stroll, try China town or the Indian district."
,,A big street full of shops,3.0,,If you are a shopaholic you will be in heaven! It was interesting looking at all the massive shops!
,,Shops galore!,4.0,,"Even if you are not buying, it is a must to see the shops in this lovely area"
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,Great shopping area! with one of the most expensive brand outlets there.. loved walking on the streets and restra
,,Great if you like shopping - Stay away if you dont,4.0,,A great place to shop with so many large well designed shopping centres next to each other. Be warned however shopping in Singapore is expensive for well known goods with prices on a par with London and New York. To get good bargins you need to go outside of Orchard Road to other areas and more local markets.
,,Corner to Corner Shopping,5.0,,Orchard road is a must visit road for anyone visiting Singapore. I find Takasimaya which is located at the centre of the street the best place for shopping anykind of goodies one can think of. Some of the hotels on the street are also very good with much friendlier service than the marina bay sands' one.
,,So much to do,5.0,,Great shopping again...not the cheapest shops as they are again designer brands but there is a department store that has an incredible range of items on each level. The eateries are cheap and full of delicious choices. The visitor information center is not far along the road and is open to late at night. Great place to pop into to get all the information you need to discover the sights of Singapore. They will give you lots of valuable information
,,Who Needs Paris?,5.0,,Orchard Road is high end shopping with jaw dropping stores. The best part is going underground and seeing all the subteranean shops and food courts; you could be stuck down there for a week and still not see everything.
,,great shopping,5.0,,"well orchard road is a shoppers paradise,something for everyone.best time to shop is in there 6 week sale may-july,with
great specials sometimes up to 70%off....wow.awesome picture displays on the buildngs for advertising...great sight at night time.after shopping it is nice to have coffee and some kaya toast(with coconut egg jam) so yummy,at Ya Kun in Sommerset shopping centre"
,,Shopper's Heaven,5.0,,"There is so much to do on Orchard Road. Shopping, of course is incredible in the enclosed malls, and the food courts that serve everything from the famed Chicken Rice to Malay satays. It is just great to walk along there and see and experience the commerce and energy of this great city state."
,,Simply the Best!,5.0,,"If you would like to buy something, especially branded goods, this is the best place that you should not miss. Orchard road is one of the best shopping belt in Singapore. You can find almost anything within this areas. It can be access easily either by bus or MRT. The only issue with the shopping center in Singapore is having a similar retail shops and food outlets all over the area. Therefore, if you forget to buy something in one of the shopping center, very likely you can buy it at another shopping center within the orchard road - that is how convenience the area is. You must visit the following shopping center at Orchard: ION, Isetan Scott, Tang, Takashimaya, Centerpoint, 313, Paragon and Scott Square (New)."
,,GSS,4.0,,"As expected, it was very crowded every where we went but the items on sale were quite attractive and we were spoiled for choice. We still managed to get down to a nice and cosy place for dinner. The shops were mostly quite attractive and tempting."
,,busy and crowded,3.0,,"Busy, hot, crowded - if you are looking for where all the people in Singapore are, this is it. Every major designer and then some. Loved the theaters and Garretts Popcorn"
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"Walked up and down Orchard Road a few times. Loved the shops. Found that there was a lot of variety, in content and in prices."
,,A feast of shopping,4.0,,There are so many shops it can be a bit confusing but it certainly is an experience. Worth going further to the Tanglin Mall.
,,"Walk ,soak up the atmosphere and shop 'til you drop!",4.0,,"Orchard Road is THE main shopping area of Singapore and a great pace to walk and soak up the atmosphere. Singapore is very clean and safe so walking about is a pleasure. Orchard Road goes on forever I seems but it has everything great cafes, restaurants, shops from the high end designer stores Chanel, Gucci, Dior etc, and everything in between. You can very easily spend the day wandering around here. A few of the side streets have terrific, trendy and local restaurants, try Emerald Hill area whe you can sit outside and gaze at the beautiful colonial and old Chinese style homes."
,,shops galore,5.0,,"We went to Orchard Road by MRT, then did the rounds from high tech gadgets to clothes, food and some more shops. As we had to catch another appointment, we took the train back to the hotel..."
,,Shoppers paradise,5.0,,True shopping with hundreds of shops all linked by underground passages from high end designers to numerous high street brands.
,,I came over during the Great Singapore sale on the Tiger Airways inaugural flight,4.0,,"The sales. The shops at Orchard road ae easily accessible from the MRT or the road. It is very covenient and exciting shopping there. I went to Tangs, Lucky Plaza, Takashimaya and all the other places around."
,,overcrowded and very busy,3.0,,"I should confess that I live and work in New York City and therefore have access to the greatest shopping in the world. Orchard Road is a series of large malls that are overcrowded with sightseeing tourists, and i noticed hardly anyone was buying anything. All the stores are name brand merchandise, and to be honest, the prices are much better shopping these same brands at Bloomingdales or Nordstrom or Macy's in the US. We were visiting a famly member in Singapore and ended up walking through the mails one evening, The ION mall is especially fun to walk through, so large, but again, prices there were very high (30%-60% more) compared to NYC prices. And we were told this first week of July was a sale week in Singapore,,,, but prices were still very high. People from other countries who do not have these brands in their own home towns might find this a bit more exciting, but for this working girl from NYC, I would not return."
,,Great shopping!,5.0,,"Every kind of shopping, you won't be disappointed."
,,Life in Singapore,4.0,,A must-visit place in singapore. Well known for its night life.
,,I loved it,5.0,,"great street for shopping, I loved it. Ion mall was amazing. walking around without shopping was also good."
,,super fun….,4.0,,"must go to takashimaya ion and paragon.
the streets are a pleasure to walk on…
excellent coffee shops
some very good restaurants
good deals on branded stuff though the shopping is quite expensive here compared to other countries and high
good serious and window shopping.
overall lots and lots and lots of fun!"
,,Must Go in Singapore...,4.0,,"If you are in Singapore you have to go to Orchard Road for shopping, it's mad here during Christmas or New Year's or even on weekends. I simply loved taking a stroll here doing window shopping...:)!! Filled with lots of good restaurants and Shopping Malls, it's an amazing sight and place to be..."
,,Shopping,4.0,,Love shopping in Orchard Road as there is still a couple of malls that is like Singapore was in the 80's but also have all the brand name shops.
,,"Orchard Road , Lucky Plaza area",4.0,,"Vibrant, lively area , lots of shopping and food. Walkways are well maintained and buildings are inter connected. Transportation is readily availaible"
,,A shopping street like any other,3.0,,"Orchard Road is the heartbeat of commerce in Singapore. Much like Oxford Street in London, its massively overcrowded, and a procession of giants stores and malls. It is what it is, but nothing to shout about."
,,A shopping experience,3.0,,"Orchard Road is ok if you a shopper and have more money than sense. At one end rows of designer shops from Chanel down to M&S then Orchard Towers at the other, a surprise area of lady boys and over priced bars. If you're adventurous venture into whats' nicknamed the 4 floors of w***** and see if you can tell the difference betwen men and women."
,,shopping shopping,5.0,,"great shopping experience. the best malls you can find, the quality of the good and the service is definitly one of the highest in the wordl"
,,Nothing new if you're from UK,4.0,,"You can see all the brands you see in the UK, top shop, new look, body shop, accessorise, M&S (:0/) and a few more. Plus loads of designer brands, not quite in my budget range - so all in all a little disappointing for a British Chick who was on the look out for something a little different. ION was a maze! Conformed to everything I mentioned above."
,,All about shopping,3.0,,"A long street full of large shopping malls. Most of them modern, though some are typical chinese. If you're in Singapore for the shopping, this is the place to be. If you're not, there isn't that much to see and do."
,,the world famous orchard road woth a visit,5.0,,"its epic, amazing and worth a stroll if you are into shopping. I love orchard road and every time i visit Singapore take the time to at least get a few hours there."
,,Great Place for Shopping,4.0,,This is where we bought our Gifts since there's so many shops selling cheap items. You can also look for a Money Charger with a high rate compare to the Airport.
,,good design,4.0,,"Orchard Road, has only malls, shopping center and restaurant, the pedestrian area along the road is well designed with great street furniture , it is fun to walk along the road"
,,If you've never been to shopping malls...,3.0,,"If you've never been to shopping malls before, then go to Orchard Rd and see the same stores that you will see in any other malls in the world. Have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it? Orchard Road is the answer. Don't get me wrong, the 22 malls there are done beautifully, but I can see any of these name brand stores in any other city in the world. I would rather take in the old sites in Singapore that are slowly being torn down, destroying their history, to build yet another mall."
,,Shops Galore,4.0,,"I wish I had more money! Every label you can think of. The only downside is that food is expensive. Getting around is fine, we walked down Orchard Rd and got a taxi home."
,,Mecca of Shopping,5.0,,"Always a pride of Singapore.. Now with new malls like ION, it is even better. I love this better than Oxford Street of London. It's great dynamic atmosphere and throbbing life, i would recommend this to both residents and visitors."
,,For shoppers only,3.0,,"If you want to go designer shopping - don't miss this street.

If you don't, there's very little reason to go here and you'll have more fun haggling and exploring Arab Street, Little India or Chinatown!

Nothing wrong with Orchard Road at all if you want to stock up on top name stuff, but the prices were no better than what you'd get elsewhere so don't go out of your way otherwise!"
,,Beats new york,5.0,,I am a shopping queen and this street beats anything I've seen even better than new York.
,,Spend a little? or a lot..,4.0,,"Best for shopping with unlimited range of quality goods,Just dont empty the bank.."
,,Glitz,3.0,,Over-rated in our opinion. Many very expensive shops and crowded.
,,Malls Galore!,4.0,,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn - Orchard and so we were just a few steps from Orchard Road - the shopping center in Singapore! June/July is when the Great Singapore Sale happens. There are several high-end and middle-range malls with huge 50-70% discounts plastered all over the malls to tease shoppers!

When we went in for a little ""window shopping"" (my husband says all actual shopping starts with a little window shopping, lol!), I noticed that even when most items are on sale, due to taxes and fees added on to the price tag and/or it is really that expensive in Singapore, I find shopping in the US, Hong Kong or even in the UK, cheaper than in Singapore! Nice street to walk by and go in and out of the malls either to actually shop or just look around.

FOOD OPTIONS: There are yummy and cost-efficient food choices at Food Republic on the 5th floor of 313 Mall. It's a huge food court with huge selection of food to choose from with Class A rating for cleanliness which is a plus to know. If you're staying in a hotel along or near Orchard Road, there are lots of mid-range (SGD75-100 for 2-course meal for 2 persons) restaurants located at Cuppage Terrace along Cavanagh Road (it's the street between the Centre Point and OG Mall. Maharajah serves good Indian food and Viva Mexico serves, well, Mexican food. Good food and good service. These restaurants worked well for us as we tend to do sightseeing all day, back in the hotel to freshen up and have a little rest in early evening and will be wanting dinner late at night (between 10-10:30pm). We don't seem to find any other restaurants in Orchard that are open beyond 10pm,even the restaurant inside the Holiday Inn Orchard."
,,Great for Shoppers,5.0,,"I think its best place to visit if you enjoy shopping. Especially if you are from overseas with strong currency. Even if you dont like shopping, eating is amazing. Authentic cuisine with tons of choices."
,,If you really need to be in airconditioned places,3.0,,"It is one big shopping mall after another. If it is a really hot day maybe being in airconditioned spaces might be intesting.... Why would you come to singapore and visit malls?? (if you want to buy Hermes buy it from Marina bay, at least you'D be in a ""well designed"" building"
,,Busy busy busy,4.0,,This is the main shopping area! Very busy lots and lots of designer shops and some very good eateries! Don't forget your plastic and passport for various discounts.
,,Shopping,3.0,,Just shops that can be found anywhere. Plenty of them and plenty places to eat.
,,Lots of Higher End Stores,3.0,,"We caught a cab there and was a bit early as nothing seems to open until 1030am.

There are a huge amount of stores and malls. We felt we could have been in any western country's malls so didn't really get into it.

We went over to Bugis Street area and enjoyed the shopping more."
,,A mass of humanity,4.0,,"If you can stand the heat and humidity, I highly recommend talking a stroll down Orchard Road on a weekend if for no other reason than to experience the crush of people. It's quite the scene. Mobs of Singaporeans of all stripes, and great window shopping to boot."
,,shopping road,5.0,,"good ambiance for shopaholics, large pedestrian, clean and fine :)"
,,Shopping shopping shopping,4.0,,"Lots of shops both high end luxury goods, chains store and departmental store. Food hall at the basement of shopping centre easy access after all the shopping."
,,Top luxury Brands dominate,4.0,,There are bargins to be found but this requires a bit more work. alot more luxury stores than when I was last there. We found centres like Raffles City Mall more mid priced and easier to get around.
,,Orchard Road Review,5.0,,The extremely wide variety of goods and services offered stagger the imagination. Simply amust when in Singapore!
,,Max out your credit cards!,4.0,,"Need I say more..? Stores upon stores for as far as your eyes could see. Most famous area in Singapore for shopping freaks.

As beautiful as the city is, Orchard road is perhaps one of the best places if you want to shop in Singapore. Big brands, local brands, expensive, cheap. Everything and anything is available at pretty reasonable prices. From Gucci to Loui Vuitton, D&G. The list is endless. The street is filled with Big Brand Exclusive stores and malls. Easily accessible by MRT.

Not really very surprising except that everything is available on just one street. Shopaholics paradise. That's all and suddenly you realize that your cards have maxed out!"
,,to be avoided,1.0,,"Unless you are besotted by yuppy retail 'names' it is to be avoided, not even at decent bar in the area these days"
,,Just too much,4.0,,"Never seen so many shops at 1 road. It is just too much. Interesting is that further down the road, the shops are not that exclusive anymore and you even can start buying things. (Sorry, I have no budget for all the big labels like Gucci, LV, Hermes etc. there are just too many of them)
If you have done this once, it should be fine for the next decade.
(I am wondering how A&F are selling their hoodies and sweaters in this country, you can only wear this in the ice chilled office, outside you are just melting....)"

,,Good place,5.0,,"many indian stores are there, you can pick items at quite reasonable rates"
,,Lots and lots of shops,4.0,,"Lots of shops. The new ION Orchard is good. Some centres and quite old and are for specialty items (formal dresses etc). Also cinemas. If you like to shop, you'll be kept busy."
,,Mall experience,3.0,,"We took the double-decker bus to Orchard Road to see the shopping mekka of the already very shopping-friendly Singapore. Where are the shops?, we wondered during the journey, expecting some European-type set up. When all our fellow travellers seemed to get off and the station was actually called Orchard, we joined in, slightly confused where to go. It turned out that Orchard Road is a collection of very big, nice and sometimes luxurious shopping malls. There is an astonishing selection of brands, including the big French and Italian luxury houses, but since those are also featured at home, we decided to go to Little India for a different experience."
,,Shop til you drop!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a shopper's dream - so many malls stacked with the latest fashion designs.

,,Amazing place on earth - if you are a shopper,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise! So many shops, splendid buildings and amazing extent of the shopping levels underground. Worth exploring the shopping arcades connecting the main shopping centres.

,,If you have the money best shopping in world,5.0,,Three floors of Gucci. Queues outside Channel. Never seen anything like it. Knightsbridge is nothing compared to this.
,,Quite an Experience...,3.0,,"In our 5 days in Singapore we went to Orchard Road twice.

My feelings are a little mixed about the whole experience so I am going to summarise it in simple positives and negatives. In the end while it was fun I would not rush back again.

POSITIVE
- Easy to access, we stayed at Clarke Quay and took the MRT to the Orchard Road stop (After changing once).
- We got some good deals in H&M.
- Lots of variety and stores to choose from.
- The air-conditioning is fabulous, maybe even too good, in some stores I needed to wear a cardigan.

NEGATIVES
- Even though it was the Singapore Sale I did not find many what I would call bargains. I did get a lovely Oroton bag for $400 SGD and a pair of sunglasses for $105 SGD which is a lot cheaper than in Australia.
- Most of the stores in the easy to find places were high end designer and expensive. Its a very hard place for the average tourist to navigate.
- Unless you know exactly what you are looking for the sheer variety can get overwhelming.
- Some of the shopping centres are like mazes and are very hard to navigate. The 'cheaper' centres are not well sign posted.
- I felt many of the stores were repeated and in the areas we discovered (by no means all of Orchard Road) the same stores were repeated time and time again.

TIPS
- Unless you are after high end designer goods head straight for the basement levels for the (generally) more affordable items.
- Food can be a bit more expensive but the food halls are still mostly good value for money.
- Do not buy a large coffee and the Coffee Bean - it is bigger than the average person's face.
- If you are tired movies are about $7.50 SGD each at the Lido Cinema in the Shaw Centre.

At the end of the day if you have the time and inclination to tackle a lot of shopping, lots of crowds and part with lots of money Orchard Road is an ideal place to do so. I personally would tackle many different attractions in Singapore first though!"
,,"Everything, everywhere",5.0,,"I counted 3 Channels, 3 D&Gs and 4 Armanis. Then there's everything in between and all the way to small corner shops. This is shopper heaven."
,,born to shop,5.0,,"Fifth Avenue, Rodeo Drive, and the Magnificent Mile - Singapore Style. Wicked cool shopping district with every store you can think of."
,,GSS+Orchard= value,4.0,,tiring but bought lots of good deals on clothes for our kids. too bad the apple ipad2 did not have the same sale during the GSS.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"There are enough shops to keep everyone happy, there a food outlet in all the malls so you can eat very cheaply"
,,nice place but ruined by Sunday maid gathering,4.0,,"A wonderful shopping area with a lots of branded stuff, pretty ladies and foods"
,,Great place to shop,4.0,,"I am an avid shopper and usually love hitting the shops, however Orchard Rd seemed to have a lot of the same shops as the malls closer to my hotel, with prices that were pretty well on par with Australia (where I'm from). Despite being in S'pore during the sales, I really didn't see anything that caught my eye that I just HAD to have and came away with only 2 pairs of shoes, a record for me!!!! On saying that, I did enjoy strolling around and seeing what was on offer and there are a great variety of stores to choose from so if you like to shop, you really can't go to S'pore without hitting Orchard Rd!!"
,,Shopping everywhere,4.0,,Stores galore. If you can't find it here you just wont find it. It was actually a little to busy for me. Hard to decide what to look at.and where to go.
,,why to spend time there?,3.0,,"Having seen many luxury streets in European countries, why would you like to spend time in a such a place when you have the chance to see totaly different things? The only answer, shopping. Well, you don't have to go miles and miles away to do this. Spare your time to temples, China Town, Little India etc. instead."
,,Ideal place for shopping,5.0,,It's the ideal place for those who likes shopping. The area has all the big and famous brands. Is worth going to check it out.
,,All your shopping needs at one place,5.0,,if you go to singapore and plan to shop. then there is no other place you ought to be staying. All kinds of brands and budget stores not to mentions any variety of food one might desire !!

,,Shopping experience in S'pore!,4.0,,"The best shopping street in S'pore.. elegant and fancy, don't miss it!!!"
,,"Busy, Expensive and Crowded",3.0,,"It's a shopping haven but of course it's mostly branded. Even food there is expensive!

Other than all the branded stuff, you can actually find some good deals of electronics, money changers and there is this one malay food stall that sells delicious food at cheap price at Lucky Plaza.

The Malay food stall named Al-Shifaa Cafe. Usually opens around 11am and closes at around 5pm. Please be advised that it has a super long queue during lunch time. Best time to go is before 12 or after 2pm. Even that, you have to queue a bit. But you have to try their nasi lemak ayam goreng at 3SGD. Delicious!

Other than that, you can also get reasonable priced food at the basement food court."
,,Shopping heaven,4.0,,"Love it, but if you are looking for cheap bargains, this is not the place. Great for labels and brands."
,,Shoppers paradise!,5.0,,"Singapore's undisputed number one shopping district. Check out all the major designer boutiques, all within walking distance from each other"
,,Active place,4.0,,Place was active with numerous brands. A good place for shopping with great selections.
,,"Overpriced, just for tourists",3.0,,"Very busy, traffic is a nightmare, had coffee at a place in Orchard Road and paid $14 for 2 lattes.. Not worth the visit"
,,average shopping street,3.0,,shopping street where Singaporeans go sale bonkers. always busy shopping. (high end and high street) Expect no bargains here!
,,A Shopper's Mecca,4.0,,"Anything and everything that a Shopper wants!!!Only if they can put in some benches across the road so that people can soak in!! But Still, the quality and quantity of stores coupled with the discipline of Singaporeans!!! Its purely worth the pleasure"
,,shopping,5.0,,so many wonderful shops - what's not to love! Very easy to spend several days here going into all of the different shopping centres and trying so many wonderful foods.
,,Modern Shopping Place,5.0,,Exotic feel. Lot to shop and eat.You will find best of brands.Eating places were abuzz with activity. Adjoining green belt is an asset.
,,"shopping, shopping, shopping",1.0,,Why walk in the heat to shop when their are so many other places in Singapore that you go to most of the same stores in zircon.
,,Malls Galore,4.0,,great place to just roam around and shop.. it also has some nice places to eat
,,Great experience,5.0,,Wish I had more time minus a husband Shopping was amazing but only had a couple hours food hall at top of 313 was amazing
,,hard to beat,5.0,,"coming from Perth, it's pretty hard to beat Orchard road for shopping."
,,Great for shoppers.,5.0,,"Orchard is designer shop after designer shop, don't go here for your tacky souvenirs as you wont find them. Great window shopping for me but there are plenty of people spending their money. Nice restaurants around too, Hard rock Singapore is on Orchard Road."
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,The iconic shopping street of Singapore. Catch out food republic on the top floor of Wisma Atria. It is a themed-food court that recreates the Singapore of the past and sells great food.
,,i'd love to be here!,4.0,,"i'd love to be here, you can shopping and shopping and shopping aaalll day here!"
,,Exhaustive shopping,5.0,,"What a place for shopaholics!! So many malls, so many brands, so much stuff! The best part is most of the malls have a decent play area to keep the kids engaged for some time. The best brands and ofcourse visitng during the Great Singapore Sale was fabulous. Wanna go there again soooon ;)"
,,Shop til you drop!,4.0,,"What's not to like? If you like shopping you'll be wowed by the beautiful shopping centres and the amazing choice of goods. Of course, every shopping centre has the same type of shops and although we were there during the ""great Singapore sale"" - there weren't really many bargains. It didn't stop me spending quite a bit of money however :). The great thing is that there are masses of cafes,food halls and restaurants so you can take a break at any time to relax and regain your strength for more retail therapy."
,,"Shop, shop and more shop",5.0,,"This road is vibrant place. Lot of shopping malls. World class brand shops all are here. If you visit Singapore, don't miss this place for shopping.

All the shopping malls has nice sculpture inside or outside the mall. Buildings of the shopping malls are with modern architecture. Shop staffs are very friendly. You'll fell good to shop here.

,,All shopping mall,3.0,,"Well,nothing much to say other than this is where most of the popular shopping centres are located,the price of goods in Singapore is more expensive in comparison with the likes of Hong Kong,especially the luxury goods
There are some good food stands underneath ion orchard with huge selections"
,,Good shopping,4.0,,You get most of the branded items and the concierge and staff very friendly.
,,High shopping street,4.0,,"From the hi-fi brands of Rodeo street - LA like Gucci, Armani, Salvatore, Louis Vutton to the normal & affordable brands, you get eveyrything here. Malls and shopping centres on either side of the street, it's a good place to spend yr evening."
,,Impressive part of the city,4.0,,"Although it is the main road for shopping, there are still trees and greenery and the landscaping is nice. The entrance to the MRT at Ion Orchard is impressive."
,,Orchard - an orchard of shopping,4.0,,"once a road through fruit orchards, now it is the highpoint for many Singapore visitors. Shopping is there on all levels from mid to high end. everything is there. name brands and ultra luxe. personally i think it used to be more fun, now it is shopping shopping and shopping. and it is an experience worth trying. shopper or not!"
,,wow,5.0,,liked it all incredible shopping and just love the archititure of the biuldings just a must to go there
,,Good for the eyes,4.0,,"Orchard as a place is very appealing for any travelers eyes with its lively shop fronts, streets and hotels. However Orchard may not be the best place for the budget oriented travelers."
,,Heart of Singapore,4.0,,One of Asia's great shopping streets - you can get just about anything you might want here - especially strong on branded merchandise. Much of it can be experienced in the aircon passages underground also. Only drawback is a lack of non-chain type stores ...
,,just shops,3.0,,"There are better places to shop and there was too much construction going on when we were there. Unless you need to go to Takashimaya and Isetan, go to Vivo city instead."
,,Brands Festival,4.0,,Fabulous road where is possible to dream ...but only dreams for the most part of the people .
,,interesting to go there and just look around,4.0,,It was very buzy...very hot though and so many people.
,,Be sure to spend cash,3.0,,"Long road, high humidity = tired legs. Its not cheap and bus stops are confusing, you need correct change to travel on the bus."
,,Shopping Haven,4.0,,"This 2.2 km of road is exclusively lined with shopping malls, each connected to the other! Its a haven for shoppers, from luxurious brands like Gucci and Prada to Forever 21! There is a great food court at ION Orchard, and mostly houses high street stores, like Zara, New Look etc.
It was even more fun because of the super sales in the summer :)"
,,Aah.. hapening!!,4.0,,"This is a really hapening place all times of the day. There are numerous designer stores lining the street which are bustling with fashion garments. However, we found them to be a bit pricy and rather shopped in Bougis Junction & the fantastic + value for money bougis street"
,,"Nice, but...",3.0,,"If you like expensive shopping and busy streets, Orchard Road is the place to visit. We took a stroll down the street - cannot go to Singapore and not go down Orchard Road, right?!? To me it was just ok - nice stores and all but too many people and what I hated the most was crossing the street having to go underground. Would I suggest to friends who visit Singapore to go to Orchard Road, yes, but I would not recommend they allocate too much time to this activity as there are many other nice things to do and places to visit in Singapore."
,,New building as always.,5.0,,They always keep it update with new building although the road is standstill. If you love shopping for branded goods then just go here.
,,nice shopping,5.0,,"excellent atmosphere, great shops, good restaurants along the road"
,,Not keen,3.0,,"We thought it was far too busy and there was traffic everywhere, we could not cross the road safely and had to really fight with the crowd to get through. We'll probably give Orchard road a miss next time."
,,I do not recognize Orcard Road,2.0,,"Compared to the Orchardd Road I knew when I lived here in 2000, 2001, Orchard Road is just yet another packed Street in a busy citi. There are now a lot of bussines shelter (banks, financial institutions, shopps, etc, all over the sidewalks, blocking the people passage, forcing them to go underground. The sidewalks al also dirty and with a lot of fences in reason of diferents construction an service mantainance. Orchard road loost its charme. Pitty. june 2012"
,,Luxury at its best,4.0,,Pro: Really nice road including all the luxury names in high end fashion! Con: Not enough cafes and lounges for shopping breaks.
,,Orchard Road....never fail to excite me,4.0,,"Visited Orchard Road again, 6 months after the visit prior to this. The last time, I didn't have enough time to enjoy everything offered by this busy street and wasn't able to enjoy the atmosphere as well.

This visit, we allocated close to 8 hours walking back and forth the busy street on Saturday, 9/6/12. Reason for trip was to experience the Singapore Sale or GSS (Great Singapore Sale). Stayed till close to 10.00pm and able to see the lights and thousands of people (local & tourist) walking up and down the street looking for bargains. Almost all the malls are pack with people going through merchandise and the queue at the cashier counters are very long. Ended my day with a dinner at one of the side café with good company – my family and cousins whilst embracing the lively street.

I personally think that the bargain are good, however most of the stuff on sale are not to our ‘style’. However, the street has never fail our (my wife and mine) appetite for perfumes. We discover that the prices are much cheaper in Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I can easily get a 30ml branded perfume for SGD42 versus the same for RM169 in Kuala Lumpur. If you are lucky, the perfume is one of the selections that are on additional discount rack which they sell at SGD38 per bottle.

Nonetheless, Orchard Road continues to impress me in its persona of pulling large crowd to visit the ever busy street."
,,Shopping,5.0,,The shopping along Orchard road was an endless variety of stores suitable to cater for all tastes and the side streets were just as exciting.
,,Expensive,3.0,,"Shopping in Singapore is expensive. Comparing the prices with HongKong & Bangkok, Singapore is far more expensive.Although there are various new shopping areas & malls like Vivo City,Marina Bay,etc,Orchard Road is the main shopping area where almost all brands are available.Still it lacks variety & i feel Hongkong & even Bangkok offers better shopping options even for branded stuff. Dining options in Orchard Road is plenty but steeply expensive. For Indian food better visit Little India near Mustafa Centre. Its much cheaper there, compared to the indian restaurants in Orchard. Overall i feel that Singapore is not a good option for a family holiday, compared to Hongkong & Thailand."
,,Shop till you drop - or till you wallet is empty,3.0,,"After many recommendations from my friends but also traveller's recommendations, we set off to explore the Orchard Road.
True, I don't think I have seen so many shopping malls on 1 square kilometer, but after we visited 3 or 4 o f them, I got simply tired....
Most malls have the same brands, so you don't find anything different or interesting that you wont find in any US, Canadian, French, Belgian or British mall.
The prices are very high - coming from Belgium, I know what I'm talking about. So to find a pair of Ferragamo shoes with a double price in SIngapore then at the fancy Avenue Louise in Brussels was somewhat shocking.
The only interesting thing I found on the Orchard Road was the different architecture of the shopping malls - each had a different design.
If you are looking for something ""unusual"" amongst the hundreds of same shops, I recommend to visit the mall within the Mandarin Hotel. You can find couple of local designer brands and labells."
,,Everything you on 1 street,4.0,,"Great place to shop and go for a walk, every thing for the low end bargaining stalls to high end fashion merchandise can be found here."
,,Orchard Road Shops,4.0,,"Lucky Plaza cab rank outside the building, short walk on both sides to other shopping areas"
,,Malls,3.0,,"It's a very long busy street of shopping malls. Not dissimilar to Chicago's Magnificant Mile/Michigan Avenue, New York's Fifth Avenue, etc. If you want to shop, there is a lot here, but note prices seem to be higher in Singapore, particularly for designer goods.

If you want to shop for everyday clothes/stuff, VivoCity is better, but not as glamorous looking.

The only time I make a point to venture to Orchard Road is during the Christmas season, as all the major malls -- Paragon, Ngee Ann City/Taka, Tangs -- have Christmas markets on B1 or 1, where you can stock up on ornaments, decor and other trimmings."
,,People everywhere!,1.0,,Too crowded for me! I like some space when I shop and having to fight my way through throngs of people whilst after a good bargain just does not appeal.
,,"Same old, same old market type stalls.",3.0,,"Wasn't impressed with Orchard Road after having visited much better in other countries. If you want souveniers which are ""tacky:"", then maybe Orchard Road will excite you."
,,One stop stopping for high-value brands,4.0,,"i enjoy the road since its designed perfectly well for shopper..high brands shopper...for me..just looking at it, can't afford it..sorry"
,,Expensive but.....,4.0,,"Great special road to visit, to hang with friend, to eat, to have fun....must go along"
,,Good shopping,4.0,,Good deals and shopping during the great spore sales....many choices
,,great fun,5.0,,Great shopping destination and the best brands and now even H and M is on Orchard
,,Good if you are a shopper!,3.0,,"Orchard road is lined with the big brand labels. If you are a shopper this is the place to go! Electronics, clothing you name it. Years ago it had a charm about it but now it's about sales and money! The traffic moves well and the area is easy to access by bus and MRT. We love the Singapore MRT, if only we could have this system in Sydney!
I loved Orchard road when the carparks had the hawkers stalls set up for food in the evenings. There are still hundreds of place to eat here and Orchard Road and especially Newton Circus have great food stalls."
,,places to eat,4.0,,"Lots of places to eat with different kinds of food. Choices of Thai food, indian,singaporean food etc."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"Shopping heaven .....if you have saved up! Not to busy lots of cool ir con malls to choose from the under ground is central,"
,,Orchard Road shopping,4.0,,"A great place to shop especially branded goods. Love the christmas decoration displayed by the shopping malls sometime in November till January. Most shopping malls have eateries,restaurants and cinemas for old and young."
,,"""Not this time""",4.0,,"The first time I visited Singapore, I was solo. From my hotel I walked all the way to Orchard Road and satisfied my hunger with hainanese chicken in one of those small eateries along Orchard Rd. (white chicken with ginger sauce). Since Holiday Inn Atrium is quite far from Orchard Road and with very limited time, we were not able to visit this famous place in Singapore :("
,,Shops and more shops,3.0,,"Lots of shopping centres to choose from, and all the brand names anyone would ever want. If shopping is why you are in Singapore then this is definitely the place to visit."
,,"Orchard Road a bit overrated, but there was a surprise.",4.0,,"Orchard Road was ok, but not as good as I believed it to be from reading previous reviews. Yes, there are lots of shops (high end shops) and the footpaths are wide. But the best thing about Orchard Road was the multi-level underground shopping centre I found adjacent to the MRT station - right under the intersection of Orchard and Scotts Roads. You can enter this shopping centre from the MRT, or if on street level, through the Marks & Spencer entrance on the corner of Orchard/Scotts. Then you can take the escalators to several floors below street level."
,,Shopping haven,4.0,,If you like shopping-this is the place to go. Just be ready with a lot of cash and huge balance in your credit card/s.
,,Upmarket shopping malls,3.0,,Orchard Road is full of huge shopping malls - it could be anywhere in the world. Great is you're looking to shop till you drop otherwise worth a quick look. It's a great area to stay as it's close to the MRT and easy to get to all areas of Singapore.
,,You have to experience it (for a little while),4.0,,"The mix of traffic, people and beautiful vegetation is an experience. Don't walk the whole length as the best area is a few blocks either way from Scott's Road. I really like the McDonald's ice cream cones and gelato by the Shaw House to cool off."
,,Very busy street,3.0,,Too many people and cars. Too many shops if you are not a shopper.
,,Lost the edge,3.0,,"No longer a bargain town, Orchard road is now like any other major city with major names, only more humid! Marina Bay eats it for pretty much everything"
,,I love the Heat and the % star shopping centers,5.0,,"The mix of people and the Food available is amazing , going to a Movie is cheap $$and super cool. Love Orchard rd from top to Bottom ION down too Little India direction Love it, I lived in Singapore for 5 years Loved it."
,,A beautiful array of lights and eye catching experience,5.0,,"Whether you walk down Orchard Road in the day or evening the sights and sounds wow your senses. You don't have to shop but the window shopping is an experience in itself. There are upmarket shops and department stores to tempt parting with your money, but just managing to cross the road is an art in itself. The walkways under the road need some forethought as to what direction you wish to proceed.The MRT allows quick and convenient access to this precinct. We have watched the transformation of this Road since the early 1990's and are impressed with what has been accomplished."
,,"3 Guccis, Chanel and Prada... and no one buying",5.0,,"I challenge you to find someone that has actually bought something from all the designer stores on Orcahrd, they all look and then fly to Europe to buy the products. There are 10 malls, 7 stories high that seem to have every store from all over the world in them. If you are coming from Europe, save your money and buy it all back home. Just spend your time eating in some of the great food outlets along the road, basement at Takashimaya, Sushi Tei at Paragon or Taste Paradise for dim sum at ION. If you are pushed for time in the city give this a miss..."
,,Find anything here,5.0,,"Orchard Road has improved over the years. You can basically find anything you want around here. Apart from the upmarket plazas with all the Gucci/Hermes/Cartier type goods there are reality checks in the Robinsons, Marks and Spencers etc etc. We liked Orchard Plaza for tailoring and alterations, haircuts and a very good watch repairer all at very good prices."
,,Stores I don't shop at,3.0,,"The stores were impressive and there are many name brands you will recognize. However, if you are not a Chinese woman shopping for a coach, LV, or Guchi handbag, you will probably not wish to spend much time here. It certainly felt like the place to be in Singapore. If you are going to Singapore to shop, then you will probably end up here within 24 hours... But Singapore has malls everywhere, but there will be more high end shops on Orchard Road."
,,Great location,4.0,,accessible almost to most of the tourist destinations.
,,Where people shop,3.0,,"This is the most famous place where people shop. Although, there are lots of other shops everywhere. It's just the hippest and in general the most expensive shopping area in Singapore (besides Marina Bay Sands)"
,,A good walk in between all the glamour,4.0,,"The orchard road is a much busy and fast version of the Istikalal street of Istanbul, many people would instantly understand what I mean if they have seen any one of the places. I wouldn't say that a lot of history is there, but a lot of glamour sure is... A stroll along that long strip would be a memorable day to spend an evening in Singapore, because essentially, a trip without Orchard isn't really a complete trip. Different international outlets as well as local shops are there, not to mention a lot of eating outlets.

There are a lot of money changers on that road but they all give a very poor rate. No matter how strong the urge, try to avoid changing money from there.

When your done with the strolling, walk to the end of the road (depending on where you started from) and have a nice dinner at Black Angus steakhouse."
,,The Complete ROAD,4.0,,"I had to give it this title, I used to stay at Somerset, Orchard road and the reason i call it this is, there is virtually nothing that you would not find in that area.It has malls, Shops, Taxi is easily available, pretty busy area. Good crowd to kill time and of course Orchard Towers."
,,Great shopping with vast choice,4.0,,"Shopping on Orchard Road is definitely a great experience as there are so many shops and almost every designer has a boutique there. However, it can be rather sweaty if you are on the street between 11am to 4pm. So, I would hide in a department store like Takashimaya during that period of time. There are lots of nice restaurants on Orchard Road too so finding a good restaurant is not a problem at all."
,,Lots of the same ole mall shopping...,1.0,,"Ok -so we are older travellers and perhaps pretty cynical and certainly we don't like noisy, flashy, brash places much but we wondered what the fuss was about Orchard Road. All of this stuff you can buy all over the world now easily and more cheaply I would think. There are malls and department stores and Starbucks and Mackers and all of the same ole same ole everywhere now aren't there?
We prefer small, quieter quainter places -which sadly we found hard to find on our visit to Singapore. Next time maybe."
,,Good Christams light up,4.0,,"The lights are dazzling during the christmas light up and everything looks quite magical. We shopped for a lot of goodies and with the christmas sales on, we could really stretch the dollar. It rained during the christmas floats but even then the crowds didn't lessen. The traffic gets a bit too much though and jams are common, getting a taxi is difficult during peak hrs and the mrt is a better option even though that too is crowded."
,,Too many changes,3.0,,"This is not the Orchard Road of my memory, all the shops are underground, and the few on the outside did not appeal to me, in 2007 i found it a lot better, I would not look to go there again or stay in that area. And all that is left of Tangs is the roof and red poles."
,,A must do in Singapore,5.0,,"You must walk this strip, its historic and so beautiful to wander around. Raffles is so expensive, but costs nothing to wander around, taking pics."
,,One of the World Best Shopping Streets,4.0,,"I have done many of what people claim are the best places for shopping in the world and I am afraid Dubai, London, New York etc all have to move aside as Orchard Road deserves to be right in there with that company. Personally I think Orchard Road and Las Vegas are two best shopping experiences in the world. And Singapore is so easy to get around and with so many food choices it's my number one."
,,Expensive,4.0,,You definetely have to go here even if just to see it. I have never seen so many shopping centres in the one place before. You can buy cheaper label clothing such as Esprit or cotton on kids but the majority of the shopping is expensive labels. If you dont have thousands to spend on bags and clothing etc then not worth going for the shopping.
,,This place is amazing,5.0,,"Orchard Road is a unique place, every shop for every budget is located in this main road of Singapore. Stay near it"
,,The place to go.,4.0,,"When in Singapore go here for the best shopping,so many shops and centres to choose,you can buy anything here."
,,Shop to you drop,5.0,,"The shopping street of Singapore. You will find here from cheap to very expensive. Don't forget to also check out he malls where there is a MRT station, a lot more shops underground!"
,,Not bad but if your looking for real bargains!!,3.0,,"Orchard road is a slick clean and upmarket Asia shopping experience. What's nice about it is that it is generally a very safe place and walking from store to store is an experience in itself where you can stop and take a coffee or smoothie from one of the many cafe's on the pavement. Bargains are best had in the summer sales around July time. But if you want to get the real bargains and come home with your suitcase bursting, you should go to Bandung which is where you will save $'000s"
,,Shopping! shopping!,5.0,,"Take your money with you, there is something for everyone, high fashion to those take-home presents. For a great meal of ""street food"" go to the Food Opera in the basement of the Ion Center."
,,superb road,4.0,,most popular spot for tourist..clean & good for window shopping
,,Intersting walk,3.0,,"Nice Street with numerous high end stores, galleries and shops. Not many deals to be had, enjoyed window shopping!"
,,Orchard,4.0,,alight at Ion orchard MRT and make your way through the Mall. Lots of places to shop
,,Overpriced designer goods,3.0,,As an Australian traveler who usually goes to the US for bargain designer goods I knew Singapore would be pricey but was even higher than expected and more expensive than what I would pay at home. The experience is great but don't go if you are expecting to buy up big unless you are loaded.
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,It's famous worldwide as the shopping belt of Singapore - and it's totally true. A great place for whatever you're looking for. Prices are not especially a bargain but you should not expect that on Orchard Road.
,,shop till you drop!,5.0,,what can I say! you can get anything if you look! some good value but some not. have fun and enjoy:)
,,Shopping Paradise!,5.0,,"This has got to be the BEST shopping mall street in the world!

You will see all the famous designer stores over and over again on the same streets, plus H&M, Mango, Zara, and massive department stores full of good variety and price goods, like Takashimaya for example.

I recommend leaving at least a half day to visit it if you're just looking and a full one if you're shopping.

The street is beautiful, full of locals and also international visitors, street performers, people from all ""tribes"". You will have a nice time even if you don't like shopping, for you can just people watch, have a drink or even take a walk to beautiful Istana park.

Don't miss the luxury Ion Orchard mall inside, it's very nice, even if you're just looking.

From clothes to shoes to electronics, to food courts with every kind of fresh fruit juices, to huge screens projecting images on the streets, the beautiful evening lights, everything is amazing in this place.

Definitely, a must see.

The best of it all is that you will be shopping in the safest city in the world, so no need to worry! Have fun! :-)"
,,Luxury shopping,3.0,,"If you want to take a walk amidst shopping malls and have a look in the windows of the luxury brand stores, then this is definitely the place to go. It's the Singaporean Champs Elysees... For those who don't care much for shopping, there's really not much of interest for you there a part from Emerald Hill, which has a few ild houses and funky bars"
,,Orchard Rd shopping has a competitor.,4.0,,The traditional Orchard Rd shopping is still good but the new Marina Bay centre has it all in air conditioned comfort. The big names are here

,,Shopping haven,5.0,,"I liked the modern, busy street filled with shoppings malls and boutiques of every brands imaginable!"
,,Great shooping,5.0,,"Orchard road is just one big shopping center, loaded with more shopping centers. In the samll shops lining both sides of the street, especially Lucky Plaza, haggling is the norm. Be careful of the old bait and swtch, and all of the ""important"" accesories which will be listed after you've already paid. Do your homework first, know exactly waht you want and don't let them lead you on. If the first shop doesn't give you what you want, there are at least another 30 close by with the same merchandise."
,,Shop till you drop.......,5.0,,"Many great big malls with thousand of stores to spend your money at, also great restaurants from the cheap ones to the fancy ones. You need to wear a sneakers and bring a mineral water to explore orchard

,,Like expected,4.0,,"A succesion of shopping centres with some interesting places like the huge Japanese bookstore named Kinokuniya, google it, they it is the second largest bookstore in South East Asia.

And for family, some of the shopping centres have breastfeeding room and indoor playgrounds.

Most of the centres have food court, usually in their basement, and sometimes on their top floor"

,,Shopaholic? Here's the place,4.0,,"Looking for high end brands ?
Ion, Paragon, Ngee AnnCity/Takashimaya are good.
Mid priced ones? Same. Local brands likeGG5, Mphosis etc can also be found at these malls!

The food court and atrium at Takashimaya and Ion are good. Restaurants at these malls are good too!

With kids? Ion has a bookstore Prologue on top floor while there is Kinokuniya at Takashimaya/NgeeAnn City. Takashimaya has a good selection of toys as well. Toys R us are located at Paragon and Forum. Paragon 5th floor has good clothings stores for kids.
Looking for Electronics etc?
Head to Best Denki at Ngee Ann City. Personally would buy from these chains as i find the prices rather competitive and the quality is assured unlike some stores at low end malls like Sim Lim. Funan centre i also the place to go for IT stuff."
,,Wow,5.0,,Went on Saturday night and what a hive of activity. Could not believe the shops and shopping malls. They are everywhere. Food courts are awesome.

,,"This Garden,please see it!",4.0,,"There are a lot of orchids in one place . We were lucky to see the Singapore Orchid. The time was March and as you see the photos, the shape of flowers and colors are very nice. I enclose a few photos to see the difference of them. There are some other interesting places to see such as Marina Bay Sands Hotel , Flyer, Bird Park, ...."
,,No longer good value,3.0,,"Watch the camera sales people who offer ""genuine bargains"", even trade-ins, and quote conversions to your currency that are greatly exaggerated in favour of a sale. The prices are very high when compared to duty-free and internet sites for our home country (and purchases in our country are covered by warranty)"
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"As one other reviewer put it....WOW! This is a lovely part of Singapore with more shops than you could imagine. I had to laugh -- just ""how many"" Prada, Louis Vuitton, etc. stores do you really need in a two block span? Shopping is very upscale which begs the question -- who really shops here? However, there were plenty of shopping bags walking by so somebody is buying! Even if you don't buy anything, it is worth the time to stroll through this well manicured shopping district! Definitely a ""must see"" on your trip to Singapore!"
,,Worth a visit,4.0,,"Lots of shops, but if your not into shopping not really worth it as all shops you can get back in UK."
,,Amazing shopping,5.0,,"I am always surprised at the value you get when you shop here. There is always a bargain to find. For people who love retail therapy and don't mind the expense, it is worth saving up for."
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"Great shopping, but pricy drinks.Tourist info nearby"

,,Great shopping,5.0,,"Excellent place to spend your Singapore dollars, shopping malls are air conditioned and all major stores are here"
,,Not what it used to be,3.0,,"We were a little disappointed with Orchard Road - having traveled to Singapore a bit in the past, we were surprised to see how much Orchard Road had changed. Once ""the"" place to go and shop, it caters more to the big names and brands. It does have one large bargain shopping center, but there are so many empty shops in there now, that it does give it a sad feel."
,,Shop Till You Drop,5.0,,"Orchard shop shopping is amazing. Everything from top designer haute couture, casual wear, shoes, shoe, shoes, handbags, jewellery, tattoos. The underground malls are literally heaven underground."
,,I love shopping here...,5.0,,Great shopping for both branded and cheap stuff...Just don't get caught in the traffic on Friday afternoons after work rush - stagnant traffic :-(((
,,Expensively beautiful,5.0,,Wonderful street of top name brands. Very beautiful expensive stores.
,,Love the hustle and bustle!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is fabulous for all your shopping needs. If you are thinking of going, I would recommend starting at Takashimaya, the food court in the basement there is brilliant (and super cheap) and work your way up Orchard Road from there. It is always extremely busy but you can walk out of one shopping mall straight into the next!!!"
,,Shopping,4.0,,More shopping than you might find anywhere else - an easy place to wander around and all sorts of shops and stores from which to choose.
,,Overrated,3.0,,"A place to be seen, overpriced, was over it very quickly, seen it all before"
,,Thirsty alley with German Beerstub !!!!,1.0,,"Thirsty alley with plenty of low cost night life. Crowds of Tourist during the day, crowd of drunk people overnight. Same shops then everywhere else in the world. Escape !"
,,"Many shops, but generally not very cheap",3.0,,"Bustling Street, much to see and do. However, it is crowded and bargains are not always easy to find."
,,An interesting place to take an evening walk,5.0,,"This is Singapore's answer to New York's 5th ave or Time Square, perhaps. The neon lights and many malls are splendid, yet many of the shops are expensive. Some of the stand-alone stores or stores inside some malls are even open to bargaining!

Yet, this is not where you would want to do much shopping. For that, go to Little India or Chinatown."
,,Very Commercial,3.0,,"Took a special trip to Orchard Road. Was hoping to see more of the ""traditional"" shops as I did a number of years ago. It is now very commercialized with all new buildings and shopping centres with brand name shops. Merchandise is more expensive than in Australia, even with the exchange rate in our favour."
,,Great shopping,5.0,,What a variety. Lucky Plaza offers great value. All the malls are well organised and very clean. We had a great burger and beer at the the Hard Rock Cafe to take a well deserved rest from all the shopping
,,"If its Orchard Road, its Singapore!",5.0,,"The 5th Avenue of this island city, Orchard Road caters to ALL tastes. The department stores for the smart shopper, the boutiques for the picky brand-chasing visitors, you name it, they are there. Tired feet after all that shopping, there are tea places, excellent restaurants, foot massage palces... you can go on and on... And what's more, they are all of very high standards of hygiene, taste, quality, etc. Prices may not be low as everyone expects Singapore to be 'Cheap', but you will not get cheated if shop at good non-touristy shops."
,,Interesting place to window-shop and people watch,3.0,,"Lots of shopping here of course. I mostly go here for the food courts, located in each mall, which are great. My favorite is probably Wisma. I also enjoy the Shaw theater as well."
,,Best shopping,5.0,,"Bought lots of stuff, best shops ever. So many different malls and shops."
,,shopping addiction satisfied,4.0,,"Firstly as you probably know Orchard road is a long road so pick your mark to start if you are going shopping.
It is peppered with malls all along it and as we were shopping for teens Cotton On was our start point and we just went from there.
Personally it was really to satisfy a need to shop rather than getting bargains which these days one can get online.
We didn't get to the markets and at the other end of the spectrum of course you have high end brand shops. Shops for every type and level of addiction.
But fun anyway as long as for me, it didn't take over completely."
,,Too many malls,3.0,,"Orchard Road is still where it's at, but the new malls lack character, same old stores."
,,"Shops, shops, shops",5.0,,"What can I say. Orchard Road in lined with shopping mall after shopping mall, with any brand you can conjure up available, also in brand flagship stores.You can easily spend a whole day; choosing food and drink is also no problem on Orchard Road. My favorite is the ION shopping mall. Luckily the 20 kg baggage allowance of Singapore Airlines keeps the shopping binge in check. After a day Orchard Road the High Street in your home town will seem a bit dull."
,,shopping heaven,4.0,,"basically orchard rd is the shopping district..

all the imported, high end stuffs are here. the malls are placed side by side. so its like mall hopping. the restaurants found in the area could be quite expensive so beware.

from tiffany to LV to Hermes everything is found here...

would suggest to go here by end of may to july for the singapore sale
or by Christmas time, because of year end sale ..

most stores open at 10 and closes at 9-10pm"
,,An eclectic road,5.0,,"This place has everything from your underground market style righ through to our top end Armani, Prada stores. A must visit for any Singapore stay especially I your chasing some retail therapy"
,,Fashionitas heaven,3.0,,Went there just to experience one of the famous street in Singapore. Full loaded with a designer's boutiques. Branded luxury things. Not so much to enjoy for except if you love to shop with a big budget and appreciated the art of the fashion.
,,shops,4.0,,"great place to shop not like the uk ,most shops will come to a price for a item which suits you both"
,,Too avoid if possible,2.0,,Car traffic and human traffic is main contributor. Place is to conjested. Need to replan the area
,,Orchard Road Forever,5.0,,"if you come to Singapore, Orchard is the important place you have to visit... must must must... crowded, shops every where... but nice to walk around."

,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"singapore best shopping place. conveniently located in the central of singapore. shopping , food paradise, hotels ."
,,Busy yet styllish,4.0,,"The road is busy but really good to experience. The shopping complexes there are huge and offer a variety of deals. We particularly also liked the 3 for 10$ shops. You get to take any three items for just 10$ which is definitely worthwhile and moreover its not cheap looking items. You can explore and be there for an entire day with trams and buses at your disposal every 2-3 minutes. We were there for just a few hours as we wanted to collect the Singapore tripper pass from the authorized agent there. However, would love to spend some more time there the next time I visit with family."
,,All roads lead to Orchard Road in Singapore,5.0,,"You can't avoid being on Orchard Road if you're staying in the city centre. And what can one say about it, other than its worth one visit for sure just to experience Singapore's premier pasttime - SHOPPING!"
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,Just part of Singapore that has been there for years. Worth a visit or walk.
,,Feast for the Eyes,5.0,,"We walked down this strip and took in the riot of lights. It was a moving visual feast and, for a moment, I had to remind myself I was still in Southeast Asia. Walking past Ion Orchard and all the high-end malls, I felt compelled to do some shopping but my legs were just too heavy already, having done a lot of walking the entire day at nearby culturally significant neighborhoods. I heard this area is more stunning during the Christmas season . . . mental note to self."
,,Very very busy,3.0,,"Great place if you like shopping, but I don't. Lots of shops lots of people and plenty of food."
,,"The chic and the posh, Singapore style",5.0,,"Orchard road is a must see when in Singapore. Here you will find all sorts of malls, the one after the other, and some of them are really worth to visit in a slow pace. The best prices are in the oldest ones, where you will find small shops, with all kind of bargains. There are of course high end malls, with exquisite brands and styles, where you will find the chic and the posh as well."
,,A wild and wondrous place for retail therapy ...,5.0,,"Orchard road is not for the feint hearted ..... Shops, shops and just when you think it can't be possible a sign pops up saying ""more shops"". Level upon level of shops. Above ground. Below ground. I amongst the shops are also wonderful eateries. Of every description and every nationality. We only went to Orchard Rd the once. And it was enough. But what a ride ...."
,,Shopping...,5.0,,Best location for shopping for all kind of things.
,,Shopping and more shopping,4.0,,"Great selection of shops from all over, however on the Ion side of the road it can get a bit frustrating as you walk from one shopping mall into the next without realising it.
Morning's are better as there are lesss people about and definately avoid Lucky Plaza on Sunday nights as its the place all the filipna maids seem to congreate on their day off."
,,Nothing too impressive,3.0,,"Few good restaurants and shops, but pricey compared to KL"
,,Shopping Overkill,5.0,,"Great shopping experience, massive choice of shops and restaurants."
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,Anyone visiting Singapore must visit Orchard Road and experience the shopping. The sales are in May and June and prepare yourself to stand in long till queues. The road is lined with beautiful trees and there are plenty of benches in the street to take a rest and watch the world go by.
,,"Food, shopping, everything",5.0,,"It's got so many shops, it could take you a week to comb through them all."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"One can find anything they want to buy here in Orchard rd,everything u name it they got it. So it's very convenient place to stroll and shop whatever your budget is. Orchard rd is still my fave shopping site every time I'm in Singapore for the reasons."
,,Something for everyone,5.0,,Best thing about Orchard Road ... The variety! There really is something for EVERYONE! From glamorous high end stores to middle of the range chain stores. It is shopping Mecca!
,,Must visit place,5.0,,"Well its the very famous Orchard Road it has everything to indulge your passion of foods,shopping,arts etc ... Fabulous !!"
,,Shopping - nothing special,3.0,,"For all the hype about Orchard road, we found it disappointing. It seemed like a shopping strip just like any other, with exactly the same designer label shops as you find anywhere in modern cities."
,,Shopping Street,3.0,,It's huge and for me it sometimes was confusing to cross the streets because you often have to use an underpass and I just lost my orientation. A shopping place like everywhere.
,,The Asian 5th Ave.,5.0,,"This street is remarkable, it actually puts 5th Ave in NYC to shame. It's beautiful, amazing for shopping and finding great places to eat. A must for every trip in Singapore."
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,Tourist..!!!! heres a shopping belt for you..go on..walk the leg.. =)
,,A road full of shopping malls,3.0,,"We didn't care for Orchard Road, you need to know what you are looking for, ask the best place to go and go there.l Strolling along Orchard Road is not scenic and Singapore is too humid. Some of the malls are attractive and it is good for accessories for Ipads etc."
,,Just a mall,3.0,,Just like any mall in any other major city. Starting to show its age. Marina Bay shopping center was far more impressive
,,Great Vegie Meal in Lucky Plaza,4.0,,"Found a great little Vegetarian outlet called ""Fancy Vegetarian Food"" (or similar) in a cheapo food court under Lucky Plaza S$5.00 for two meals ! Yeah its cheap but a lot of fun."
,,Great Place for Shopping,5.0,,"Orchard road is the heart of Singapore and you can find all the famous brands in the shopping centers around Orchard Road. If you are looking for good deals you can head down to Lucky Plaza or Far East Plaza and there are loads of nice clothes / accessories there. Paragon, Takashimaya & Wisma Atria house all the famous brands from LV to Gucci to Prada, DKNY and more~"

,,boring all malls,3.0,,every malls look the same and they offer pretty much similar store
,,"If you love shopping, you'll love Orchard Road",5.0,,Orchard Road has shopping for most budgets and loads of restaurants and cafes to stop at when you need a rest. Check out Ion as well. Easy to walk along and spend a whole day browsing and buying.
,,Always good,4.0,,the cleanliness and the opening hours of the shops and restaurant here are perfect. not so like the lack of help from locals when asking for direction
,,Shopping haven.,5.0,,"More structures are being built, but still it is a shoppers' destination."
,,An overwhelming experience,5.0,,"So many designer shops and places to visit. Had to space it over two nights, even then couldn't see it all. No shortage of places to eat or shop even for the smaller budgeted tourist.

Would recommend bringing a map of Singapore before taking it on."
,,Full of expensive stores and underground shopping,3.0,,"For me the best is kinokuniya which has to be one of the best bookshops in the world. I als liked MUJI. I have never seen so many queues outside expensive stores such as Prada, gucci, Vuitton etc. The prices are not cheap. It is all clean and there are no copies. Most interesting for me is the people watching but I am afraid it is not more than a large expensive shopping mall without character."
,,Shopping nirvana,5.0,,"Heaps of international brands and more Asia-specific, including Japanese chains like Muji and Uniqlo. Great consumerist retail therapy, though be sure to balance it out with the more cultural aspects of Singapore and its less flashy neighbourhoods."
,,RE: Tiring - Shopping,4.0,,Here is where you would find some nice shopping complexes. Shop till you drop !!

,,Mall Central,3.0,,"If you like Malls, this is the place to go. There is a huge variety of places to shop, but you really have to enjoy centralized shopping!"
,,Changing Times,3.0,,"Ten years ago every second store along Orchard Road sold cameras, computors and other electronics. Today it's one in twenty. The reason? well the world has cought up. I could but an ipad cheaper that in Britain, but not cheap enough to off-set the risk of buying so far from home. I think that this is probably the same for most goods now."
,,"If you are into shopping, this is the place to go.",4.0,,"Shopping in Singapore does not get better than this. The advantage of shopping on Orchard Road is that you can connect to most malls without having to cross the street and allows you to stay in the aircon. This is due to a network of underground subways, escalators and stairs. I am certain that you will find what you are looking for on Orchard Road."
,,Good Shopping If That's You Thing,3.0,,"The core of Singapore's shopping culture. Mall upon mall of brand name and not so branded retail outlets ... something for every budget. Some great restaurants and food eatery's in just about every one of them. Great during Xmas, the whole of Orchard Road is literally lite up like a Christmas Tree."
,,shopping galore,4.0,,if you are trying to save money avoid this place because you will be tempted to shop for sure! avoid the weekends as this place gets really crowded. if you want cheap perfume (which aren't knock offs) go to lucky plaza and look for the perfume shop at the ground floor near the stairs which has a money changer right beside it. make sure you haggle to get an even better price.
,,Shopping,3.0,,"An expensive designer brand street, BUT Lucky Plaza has cheap goods and food - great for clothing bargains and souvenirs. The Orchard Road MRT stop is a great place to get off and start exploring"
,,Busy!!,3.0,,Very hectic and tiring and noisy but bargains to be got
,,Going for a stroll,4.0,,A shoppers paradise except for being propositioned 3 times within a block.
,,Beautifully decorated at Christmas,4.0,,Walk along the Orchard road in the Christmas eve. Listen to carols and buy things at sale places.
,,good shops,4.0,,"plenty shops for every wallet, from cheap till expensive"
,,Still the most concentrated shopping strip,4.0,,Yes you get the same shops in each arcade and nothing (except Abercrombie and Fitch) that I can't get back in Marina Bay Sands but the experience of trotting from one shopping centre to another is a Singapore institution and must be experienced. Besides there are hawker food stores within walking distance as well as some cheaper electronic stores you can bargain in. But it is no longer the shopping haven it once was
,,High end shopping,4.0,,Orchard Road is lined with high end shopping and Parragon Mall. There are hotels also in the area. Beautiful drive under tree canopies and traffic galore.
,,Top class shopping,4.0,,Wonderful shops... could not drag my wife away. Ion particularly impressive
,,shop until you drop,3.0,,Too full of expensive shops - prada etc - where are all the reasonably prices shops. Found everything very expensive and spent days looking for a bargain. Found out there is no such thing as a bargain in Singapore any more.

,,Busy,3.0,,Very very very very very very very busy place and I really mean it. Extremely busy.
,,Strong Singapore dollar have not trickled down to Orchard Rd shops,2.0,,Orchard Road have the dubious honour of being flooded everytime there's a thunderstorm in Singapore. as far as shopping is concerned the strong Singapore dollar have not translated into cheaper luxury goods along Orchard Road; which are imported from Europe or USA. Beer is extremely expensive; 1 can of Tiger Beer brewed in Singapore buys a 6-pack of Danish-imported beer in Hong Kong; that's protectionism 101.. HKG has no Goods & Services Tax; to the extent that all Singaporeans are actually shopping in Hong Kong. what an irony !!
,,Full of Designer Studios,4.0,,Huge and grand shopping complex paradise. Its for branded fashionista!! Nice to have a walk at night here.
,,Overpriced and nothing special,3.0,,"My wife was expecting more, especially with the Aussie Dollar flying high, but saw nothing they stuck her as being dirrenet or good value"
,,Shopping,5.0,,If you want all your designer clothes this is the place to go rather expensive but it is singapore afterall.
,,Great place to stay and operate from,5.0,,"On every trip to Singapore, we usually get a hotel on Orchard (preferably around Paragon). Area beside Paragon is the best place to stay. This road is home to the most popular brands on this planet (LV, Gucci, Bvlgari, Dunhill, Chanel, Tommy Hilfiger, etc). There are also sporting stores, departmental store, wholesale stores and malls.There is something for everyone! It is one of the most safest areas in all of Singapore as it is the area preferred by foreigners. It has more than many dining options serving from fast foods to even 5-star dining. It has easy taxi and subway access."
,,city lights...,4.0,,"Best to see the orchard road in the late afternoon, if you intend to walk along the road, to appreciate the city lights and attractions, and less heat. Shopping malls usually closes at 10:00 pm.."

,,Shop till you drop you Shopaholics!!!,5.0,,"If you cannot find what you want here, then you can't be looking."
,,Expensive!,4.0,,"Like most things in Singapore (depending on where you come from/exchange rate I guess), Orchard Road is expensive. Designer shop after designer shop, glitzy mall after glitzy mall ... but lots of choice. I preferred the ""old Singapore"", in the days when Lucky Plaza was THE shopping destination. Now poor old Lucky is just a tired place in midst of high rise chrome and glass."
,,"Tang's, Takashimaya, Wisma, Ion, 313, Wheelock, H&M",3.0,,"Good concentration of shops and major brands in these shopping complexes, especially higher end shopping. You'd find almost everything in Orchard. The only downside and probably the most annoying is the traffic and people jam here. In Singapore, almost everyone's hobby is shopping. Be prepared that whichever shop or corner you are in whilst in Orchard, you're likely to get pushed, elbowed or people just walking right into you,"
,,Orchard Road shopping,3.0,,A concentration of shopping centres next to each other. You can find good bargain in the small little shop. However price is not as good as other shopping centres such as Bugis Junction. All these shopping centres have food courts with a variety of dishes.
,,do Singaporeans really need this many LV stores?,4.0,,"if you like to shop, this will be your heaven. But do keep in mind that the currency convergent rate doesn't make anything cheaper than what you can get in the U.S. Might be better to buy what you want at duty free (assuming they have the same thing you want)
Don't forget to eat the famous chicken rice at Mandarin Orchard hotel"
,,hectic but shopping paradise,5.0,,"of course, shopping paradise :), i loves sephora and buy make up tools here.you also can find many branded clothes and great food"
,,just another street of shops,3.0,,to anyone who likes shopping for designer brands this is the place for you! for anyone else its just another street filled with expensive shops. Sure the street is clean and modern but the people and general feel around the place is one of upper class and snobbery. I think if your in singapore you have to see it but for the cultured traveller you wont find much. In comparison i would say shopping in Melbourne (Australia) is much more appealing.
,,Shopping.,3.0,,This would be really neat if you like high-end shopping (which I don't). I prefer the ten watches I bought in Chinatown for forty dollars.
,,Wow - lots of bling!,4.0,,"Okay, so Orchard Road is not for everyone, but hey, they mop and buff the sidewalks!
Both sides of the road are filled with amazing architecture housing the worlds top brand names in fashion - Gucci, Prada, Cartier, Rolex, Armani, etc. It was fun just to window shop for things that we would never really see outside of a magazine. The street is amazingly clean, there are plenty of places to eat - large and small - and once at the end, you can just pop down into the MRT station and get a cheap ride back near your hotel."
,,Too chaotic but has everything u need,3.0,,Shopping street that always crowded. Not a place for me. But I like 313 as its compact but has most of the brands I like.
,,center located,5.0,,it is very easy to go every where from there. there is big MRT station. anyway.
,,Things are expensive in Singapore,3.0,,We went to one of the shopping centres in Orchard Road and found things are quite expensive there. Be aware of the extra charge when you dine in a restaurant. They will charge you for using refresher towelette 30 or 40 cents per pack.
,,Shoppers' heaven,4.0,,Loved the atmosphere. Hated that I wanted to buy EVERYTHING and no money to do it. The world's best brands at good prices.
,,Overwhelming,5.0,,"Brilliant for shopping, Everything you could imagine and lots of it, Shopping mall after shopping mall. Shoppers paradise."
,,"First class international shopping brands with no ""fakes"".",5.0,,"A very neat, clean, and upmarket shopping area where most all brand names are located on the main street, with the odd passage ways where you can encounter some bargains on perfume etc. I love shopping in Singapore"
,,Miles of shops and Christmas decorations,4.0,,There are so many shops and malls along this strip. It is most attractive in the evening especially when all lit up with Christmas decorations.
,,loads of malls,4.0,,great for shopaholics but you need lots of money as was expensive.
,,very posh!,4.0,,"we spent half a day here and were spellbound by the posh and elegant malls and markets around. Mall after mall, we spent hours just window shopping. though most malls in orchard road are expensive, we managed to get very cheap food products in plaza singapura."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Amazing place, shop till u drop, need plenty of money, although can find cheaper deals, had a fab Singapore traditional food experience, loved it, must see while your there, good in the evening to see the place lit up"
,,Are you Shopaholic?,5.0,,From Somerset 313 you can have Japanese Food from Komodo JP restaurant and walk along Orchard Road ending with Ice Cream selling on the footpath.
,,Singapore April 2012,4.0,,Great as always - lots of shopping malls to peruse. Purchased my usual supply of perfumes and men's colognes at Dollars & Scents which is in the Lucky Plaza. Wonderful prices.
,,amazing shopping experience,5.0,,"I spent a whole day just walking up and down Orchard Road and visiting shopping malls as took my fancy... I didnt see it all! Clean precinct, the range of shops was outstanding."
,,There's too much LV as there are contructions,3.0,,"There seems to be so many Louis Vuitton shops around, every nooks and crannies!"
,,Designer shopping,3.0,,No matter where you go designer shopping is designer shopping
,,Mall upon mall upon mall,3.0,,"Same high end designer shops in every mall. Poor Singaporeans serving foreigners. Who buys this stuff? I found that the prices were much higher than back home in Sydney - and trends are a bit last season. Gets very wearing walking this strip, particularity because you can't generally just cross the road at the intersections. You have to use the underpass which takes you, guess what? Into another mall. Just try and find your way out on the correct side of the road."
,,Window shopping,3.0,,"There were many shops & malls. Since it was raining most days, our shopping was in the airport."
,,Too Busy Place,5.0,,Too busy with foreigners on weekends. Although the renovations did Orchard Road good. Not recommended for on-budget tourists.
,,Always fun,4.0,,"If you don't like shopping then Orchard Road will be of limited attraction. If, however, you are a fan of wandering around huge air-conditioned malls then Orchard road is lots of fun.

I'm not into showy brands like Prada, Gucci etc. but there are little gems to found among these aspirational brands. My favourite mall on Orchard Road is the Ion which is accessible from the Orchard MRT station. It gets posher as you go up so start at B4 where the Food Opera food court is and wander ever upwards. Highlights for me are Uniqlo and Muji, but there are lots of little shops around to entertain.

313Sommerset is another Orchard Road mall worthy of a visit and has a nice ground floor. Plaza Singapura (Dhoby Ghaut MRT) is currently being renovated but is also worth a poke around (go the Lego shop). Paragon is worth poking around once you get off the first floor. Other malls are full of your YSL type shops which are fun for the spectacle. Places like Ngee Ann City. Oh, and Lucky Plaza is decidedly down market, but lots of fun.

We also like the Tangs department store on Orchard Road. Everytime we have been there we have bought something that has been just right - a Japanese mini speaker, a pair of elasticated Havianas for our son or a pair of discounted Onitsuka Tigers.

You can wander up and down Orchard Road all day and night. Lots to see, eat and drink. Clean, safe and easy to navigate."
,,The heart beat of SINGAPORE,5.0,,There can be no vist to Singapore without going to Orchard. The trees lines streets and the shopping malls all come to life especially on the weekend where streets are crowded and there are a lot of street buskers.
,,"Shop, shop,shop !",5.0,,That says it all ---- a true shopping area ! Orchard Road has a variety of shops to appeal to everyone. It is a fun area to spend a day in Singapore !
,,Great for shopping and dining,4.0,,"Great location and strip for food, shopping, and sight seeing."
,,best shopping street,5.0,,"Very best shopping street in Asia, clean, green..gorgeous malls !! a true pleasure to wander around on a nice sunny warm day.."
,,How many malls can you put in one street,3.0,,"I have to comment that the ION mall was truly frightening - never have I seen so many huge designer stores in one building, my wallet shuddered"
,,Much variety and many price points,4.0,,"It seems one can find anything on Orchard Road. Chain stores and independants, high end, medium and low end goods are all found here. It's a fun street to visit, with the occasional street entertainment such as a fashion show outside."
,,A long road filled with expensive shops,3.0,,"Orchard road is a long road filled with expensive shops. It's very generic, better to visit Little India and China Town for a more authentic shopping experience. It's a fantastic location to link up to other attractions, so if you can find reasonable accomodation along Orchard Road then go for it."
,,A little overrated. very expensive shops,4.0,,Only peoplewith very big wallets can afford some of these shops.....Never go their on the week end. mucvh too crowded
,,If you like shopping then this may be the place,2.0,,Every top brand is represented in the multitude of malls here but it is a very strange experience if you like the fresh air on your face. Yes it has all to be air conditioned but not seeing the sky for long periods and being down in the bowels of the earth does not suit us.
,,Shopping,5.0,,"This area is excellent for shopping with a wide range of shops and eating venues.

We ate at the Coffee Club - what a difference from the ones in Australia. It is more like a restaurant. The staff here were very friendly and the service and food were fantastic."
,,"Shops, shops and more shops",4.0,,"If shopping was an Olympic sport, Orchard Road is where it should be held. If you can't buy it here, I don't think you can buy it."
,,Congested; expensive,3.0,,"Orchard is the place to be if you're new to Singapore and want to enjoy the nightlife there. There are loads of shops and eating places along Orchard, although prices are very steep. Be prepared for the crowds if you're there on the weekends as it can get very congested."
,,Too much!,3.0,,If you like shopping it's paradise but for me it was all too much. My wife likes shopping but even she was flagging in the vastness and busy-ness of it all!
,,Extreme Retail Therapy,5.0,,"If you like shopping this is heaven - if you don't it is hell!
Health Warning - do not attempt to visit every mall in one day - you will keel over with exhaustion. If you quite like shopping for a little while have a wander round swanky Takeshimaya then avoid the heat by taking the underpass to the Lucky Plaza - a Chinese mall full of tacky shops and great bargains - extremes of the spectrum!"
,,Love Orchard Road,5.0,,Had a great time here this is one of my favorite places to visit in Singapore so clean and the people are friendly all the best latest information visit www.orchardroadsg.com/ they have plenty of info just on Orchard road and Singapore in general. Make sure you visit little India while you are in SG its great place some people dont like it but its worth a visit
,,a little generic,3.0,,"Yes, it's great for shopping, but how many Prada stores do you really need in life? For me, this was too generic. And why is it virtually impossible to cross the road???"
,,Good shoping center,4.0,,Their are many shoping tower along the road and under I have lost little bit but good as it lots to buy
,,Just a road full of big and expensive shops,3.0,,"I am not a fan of Orchard Road, it is just a road full of big shops. A huge succession of famous luxury brands and big department shops. No real atmosphere. Nothing noticeable that you cannot find in a big city."
,,Most happening place,3.0,,The big show rooms and happening places on this road.Full of people and good to visit anytime in the day.Taxis are available anytime and they are well behaved.Some of the high speed motor cycles and cars are spoiling the beauty of this road.
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,What elese is there to say. Its Orchard Road. Watch out for the prices at Lucky Plaza. Make sure that you know whatyou want and how muc you are willing to pay for it before venturing into Lucky Plaza.There are bargains there but you need to be a savvy shopper.
,,wonderful!!!,5.0,,the street is full of famous brands. you should definitely go there for shopping!!!
,,Fashion Street,4.0,,If you are brand savvy then this is the place to shop...
,,Shopping and good food,4.0,,"All kinds of stuff from luxury brands to mass market items are available in the smart malls to the small shops in the older shopping centres along Orchard Road. There are inexpensive food centres and specialty restaurants as well. In December, Orchard Road transforms into a fairy land, specially lit up for Christmas."
,,shopping paradise,5.0,,"Do not forget to bring your credit card and just visit Paragon and Takashima, stroll around and enjoy all the beautifull things on Orchard Road"
,,More shopping,4.0,,"I've never seen so mant exclusive stoes in one location, jewlery shopping at some of the smaller stores were great value."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,Long lines of exclusive malls and designer shops. No bargains tho !
,,Ever changing,4.0,,"Singapore is like a city chameleon, ever changing to suit the wants of its tourists. The Orchard Road attractions of yesterday are mostly gone, with a few exceptions, e.g. Lucky Plaza, but even that has stopped being Singaporean and has even changed nationality (!). If you don't believe me, go and look.

Lets be honest. Orchard Road exists to extract money from all its many visitors. Whatever the tourist wants is there to be found, at a price. Presumably most visitors know that and pay up happily. Orchard Road can be fun to visit and there are also many attractions that children will enjoy.

Orchard Road may be the heart of Singapore but it is not the ""Singapore Heartland"". If you are spending significant time in Singapore, by all means start by soaking up the atmosphere on Orchard Road for a short time. If you want to see and feel the Singapore of Singaporeans, hop on the MRT and get off at almost any station, visit a food centre (bound to be one not far from a station), sample what the average person eats, be amazed at the choice and talk to the people you meet. You won't find those people around Orchard Road."
,,$$$$$'s,3.0,,Has become home only for the rich as most items are over priced
,,A shopper's paradise!,5.0,,"Me and Kaylie, my daughter, love to shop. We visited Topshop, Abercrombie and Fitch and Forever 21. I think Orchard Road is wondeful and I disliked seeing people writing reviews saying Orchard Road was horrible because they don't like shopping. I LOVE SINGAPORE"
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,Too many shops and not enough time and money. You can shop till you drop wear comfortable shoes as your feet will suffer... You can gt everything you want here from cheeap and nasty to designer labels. ENJOY.
,,adorable,5.0,,"feel the ambiance of modern art blend together on a nice street with a shopping paradise,"
,,NEVER SAW SO MANY BEAUTIFUL SHOPS,5.0,,"Every kind of designer shop you ever heard off, plus a million others. A gorgeous, wide, shady boulevard filled with amazing architecture. You could spend all day just wandering."
,,"If you want designer clothes, there are fewer better places anywhere.",4.0,,"Orchard Road is great, but you must have great energy!!!"
,,Boring and expensive,2.0,,"If you like to drag yourself in and out of the same old names, and spend money like it is going out of fashion - head for Orchard.

Lucky Plaza is fun on a Sunday when the Filipinas get their well-earned day off.

Other than that, vastly overrated and dull."
,,For the shopping browser,4.0,,No greater place to browse whilst you take in the latest offerings
,,Great for Rolex and Prada...has lost its charm,3.0,,"I have been coming here for 25 years and I am afraid Orchard road, like Singapore has lost its charm. A huge shopping area but up market only so if Prada, Gucci and Hugo Boss are your thing you will live it. If £600 for a suitcase fills you with horror then avoid at all costs. Lucky Plaza is a sad place today and not a patch on its hey day of 15 years ago"
,,Shop Till You Drop!,4.0,,"Malls, malls, malls.
All you can see is malls everywhere, with 1 ice cream seller worth SGD 1 in each front of the mall.
Compared to Jakarta city, I must admit that Singapore government was awesome to have this MRT-linked below those malls and could create comfort & security for any visitor shopping until late night.
It is advised that the time of your visit here shall be on Singapore Great Sale event (from May to July, held every year)."
,,Busy !,4.0,,Wonderful place to shop and dine - options are endless. Never knew so many branded stores could exist in one shopping centre and then to see it again in the centre next door is mindblowing
,,Very disappointed with the shopping,2.0,,I had heard so much about shopping in Singapore and was very disappointed for the range of products on the market!
,,Shop Shop Shop,4.0,,Its a 2km or 2 And a half km stretch straight road ment for shopping with all good brands restraunt and all possible stuff..
,,Christmas is the time to be here,5.0,,"If o love Christmas lights, and I know I do, then come to Singapore and ad,ore the fantastic Xmas displays on the street, in the shops and the malls and all over town. Singaporeans know how to make a tropical Xmas very special. ION plaza, Tangs department store, Paragon mall to name a few, are so visually appealing that you don't want to leave... Open late into the evening Orchard rd is a perfect pre Xmas shopping destination to fill the stockings with unusual gifts and then head downstairs to tngs food court for the best kebabs in town!"
,,Shopping district!,5.0,,"Walking distance from my hotel. Convenient to MTR Somerset station, lots of shops to go for."
,,"shopping,brands and a lot of walk to do",5.0,,this road has got almost everything and anything you can think of. Though i couldn't find any medium range clothing shops but i still found H and M at this road. Must visit
,,A shoppers paradise,4.0,,If you have the money and time this is the place to shop. Shopping mall after shopping mall line this road. Not a lot of bargains to save your pennies to come here.
,,Rodeo Drive in Asia,5.0,,"The 6km or so along Orchard Rd is lined with malls. You can shop upscale with Tiffany's, Louis VIutton, Gucci, Armani and on and on or more affordable with Marks and Spencers, H&M, Zara, Isetan, Takeshimaya, Tangs and just about any other known store from the entire world. If you are from the US or Europe you will find prices are higher here in the European and US name stores and clothing sizes are for the petite Asian figure. This is not the place to shop for Asian souvenirs---head for Arab street or other more ethnic areas of the city."
,,Orchard Road - A shopper's delight,5.0,,"I was told there are 116 malls on this road. I have seen around 10 of them . But Lucky Plaza remains my all time favorite . Throughout the year you get Chocolates , perfumes and nick-nacks at bargain price . Statutory warning ... please keep an upper limit cap on your budget. You have money exchange corners almost every 100 meters . That drains you of your resources without your knowledge ."
,,Shopping And Eating,4.0,,"If your country has a favorable exchange rate with Singapore then this is your destination.

Orchard Road has shopping, medical offices, spas, and girl bars all in one spot. Most of the malls are linked via the MRT and underground passages.

Shopping is why most people come here. The Paragon and Takashimaya are the anchors for the top of the line shopping and Ion is the newer mall with the more common brand names. Do some research and plan your shopping. There is no possible way to see all the stores in one day. Lucky Plaza is known for its more independent chain shops of electronics, gadgets, shoes, and luggage. Brand names are speculative there.

Many options are available to eat during your spree. Everything from McDs to upscale bistros. juice shops to mochi they have it.

There are many medical offices in the shopping complexes from dental to podiatrist.

In the Orchard Towers there are the famed girly bars that nestle themselves in a working office building.

There are grocery stores attached to the larger chain stores underneath the malls. You can pick up some cooking supplies on the way home."
,,Loved it,5.0,,Walked the street late at night it was so safe and clean. Credit to Singapore
,,"Extremely busy, but fantastic",4.0,,Orchard Road is one of the busiest roads I have ever seen. Even in the shopping centres its busy. I would recommend going on a cool day so that when you are walking around you don't get too hot.
,,Great people watching!,4.0,,"Great location to sample fashions and food, gawk at the hoards and shop! Please be careful after 9pm of assorted activity a bit unsavory for a neophyte. Underground passages between through fares are wonderful and easy to maneuver. Great assortment of shops - worldwide brands. NOT for the faint of wallet! A fabulous stroll down one of Singapore's main drags."
,,shop shop shop!,4.0,,there are soo many shopping malls and easily accessible from one mall to another with the underpass. it is also easy access from the MRT. try to go to Lucky plaza for xxxcheap souvenir shopping and don't forget to haggle!
,,Great shopping and snacks,5.0,,"Has everything you could ask for - shopping, dining, snacking, movie theaters and a nice place to walk around and take in the culture."
,,Wow shopping fix,4.0,,"If you ever needed retail therapy, this is the place to come, enormous shopping centers with everything and anything on sale. Each centre has a basement food court with very high quality food for sale, there is no need to leave. You can looses hours in these shops."
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,Lots of wonderful stores and cafes with every designer brand you canimagine
,,The place to be in Singapore,5.0,,"Very beautiful shops, Dior, Chanel, enz.but also normal shops, nice restaurants but some are very expensieve, we took tea and coffie that was10,00€. Twighigt tea shop is an nice place to sit down."
,,The Epicenter of Shopping in Singapore.,4.0,,Great shopping--go during weekdays to avoid the weekend crowds.
,,Busy,4.0,,"Çėñtrę of the country ... Is a main place for business , shoping , and Sight seen ...."
,,High dollar neighborhood with reasonable food and many sights to see,4.0,,"Our first sightseeing destination was the botanical gardens. This is the point of the trip I knew a “doo rag” or handkerchief would be an essential travel item for our duration in the Far East. The gardens are an outdoor walking tour and a good way to acclimate to the real beauty of Singapore. Throughout the city, we found much flora and fauna in the gardens as well as trees unique to the tropical Asian climate. The gardens have several ponds populated mostly with Asian carp and many turtles that the other guests were feeding. In any setting, I find the people the most interesting item to observe. I saw student groups gathering around the food and drink vendors on a school excursion for the day. All of the Singaporean students wear a uniform that indicates what school they are from and come in a variety of colors and patterns. Children on a field trip from school - what an enjoyable day! We observed a future bride and groom taking pre-wedding photos amongst the beauty of the gardens. We also observed an ex-pat wife running with an overheated Golden Retriever. The group that was the most salient, as in most places, is the construction labor force and in Singapore, it is the Indonesians who fill that niche. As we crossed the gardens, we exited on the far side by a beautifully gated arch and found ourselves upon the famous Orchard Road shopping and general high-end district.
As we waited at the traffic light, as all Singaporeans do, I noticed Rolls Royces, Bentleys, Maseratis, Lamborghinis and many Mercedes proceeding under the controlled traffic (electronic road pricing) which charges your account each time you use the identified street. This was in contrast to the vehicles that avoid the high tech toll road such as service trucks and personal motorist in Toyotas and other fuel efficient vehicles. Since gas runs about $7.00 a gallon, economy is a concern but with many forms of reliable public transit, a personal car is not a requirement in Singapore.
At this point in the day, a cool location with some cool drinks was what the group required and Trucker found us a modern Hawker in an air con shopping mall on Orchard Road. As it was the tail end of the lunch hour, we were pleased to the well-dressed Asian workers of the high end stores and ex-pats finishing their lunches. I enjoyed a Mango iced fruit drink while sampling Tucker’s coconut one which provided little taste but came in the most interesting container, that of the shaved down coconut itself.

Tucker had chosen a Dim Sum restaurant off Orchard, the aforementioned high rent district, and it provided an exciting opportunity for people watching. We noticed several families that had nannies with them dining at the same table and assisting with the children and their meals. The wait for a table was about twenty minutes which provided the opportunity to watch the Dim Sum dough being prepared and formed into delicious steamed treats. We dined on several bamboo containers of different steamed, dough-covered, hand sized delicacies of prawns (shrimp), chicken, and lamb. The dinner including some cold drinks and Tiger beer cost $60 SING or $42 US which seemed like a bargain for this type dining and location.
We travelled by foot from the restaurant down Orchard which was spectacularly lit up, and the high end retail shops were decorated for the Chinese New Year. This walkway was congested with many pedestrians but everyone was orderly and friendly and I even requested a light for my cigar which a fellow smoker obliged me with. We travelled the MRT with Trucker’s guidance to the Marina Bay Sands station which was the second to last stop on the red line. Tucker decided to exit one stop early to give us the opportunity to walk off some of the dinner and view the harbor from ground level before we travelled 60 stories above the city. The walk over also provided the opportunity to see some of the never ending construction in Singapore. The large structure that was being erected had a 24-hour labor force that seemed to consist of Indonesian workers, some of which were on a break outside on the curb, enjoying each other’s company the special way Indians seem to."
,,What a range of shops,5.0,,This was a real experience seeing so many top quality shops in one area. The highlight was the shopping mall with 4 stories below ground. Got lost in it. It did have M&S!!!
,,For Shoppers Only!,5.0,,Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise. Here the visitor will find just about everything under the sun. But not cheap on the wallet. This is Champs-Elysees of Asia!
,,A must see while in Singapore...Open your wallet,4.0,,"We have visited the Orchard Road area 6+ times now and enjoy it each time. If you like shopping for branded goods (Gucci, Prada, etc), high end shops or want a plethora of eating options this is the place for you. Orchard Road is literally just that, a long road with buildings on both sides in the Central business district. In general, you will find most things are pricey or otherwise not bargains on the street. There are a few exceptions though...

Locals know where to find the best deals including Lucky Plaza (#1 place for Singapore helpers on Sundays...it gets very crowded with many Filipino maids on their day off) and Wisma Atria has many mid-range stores.

Good luck and Happy Shopping!"
,,Shops...!,5.0,,If you like shops then this road is for you...! We love 'em so spent a while cooling down in the ferocious air conditioning...!! Try the new ice cream concept at the vast complex at the centre of the street - spot how many m&s shops they are and marvel at how expensive they are - looking forward to returning already...!
,,One of the World's Greatest Streets.,5.0,,"We visited Orchard Road around Christmas (excuse the lateness of the review.) There were well over 15 giant Christmas Trees and the lights of Orchard Road were stunning. Well worth seeing at night. During the day it is a shoppers paradise, it also features some brilliant restaurants."
,,shopping Nirvana,4.0,,"Cooled malls, (bring a sweater) excellent food courts, variety of price point shopping on offer. Beautiful the walk the street."
,,Brand Shopping in Singapore,4.0,,Shopping...thats the only reason for going to Orchard road. They have a lot of nice big malls that carry designer brands. Don't go here for deals as most name-brand stores don't offer much deals to begin with. Its still a nice place to visit but likely not a desired destination for those that do not want to shop.
,,Preferred the old,3.0,,"How to lose the charm of a City, build shops – shops – shops, where is the caricature of the street gone?? Taken away by the greed of the inconsiderate, leaving sad faced people to meander around looking like robots off to their station, where’s the life the street food the fun of a large street is gone, where is the markets at night that stretched along the Orchard road. The Life the Smiles and smells the caricature of Orchard road all gone. If you like shopping then Orchard road is for you, but be WARNED IT IS NOT CHEAP."
,,Shoppers' paradise,4.0,,"Whatever you want it, you can find it here! Well connected pedestrian malls, underground passes made the shopping experience seamless and enjoyable in the hot humid Singapore weather."
,,Lots of Options,5.0,,"Orchard Road has lots of options!!
If you're looking for a hamburger joint, coffee shop, fancy eating establishment, good old fashioned pub, or the night scene, Orchard Road has it.
If you are looking for a variety of shopping establishments, Orchard Road has that too!
There are good hotels all around and along Orchard Road."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"If you like shopping then this is the place for you, dozens of malls and thats a good thing cos its so hot you need to keep nipping in to cool down. What can you say other than its shoppers heaven enjoy."
,,Shop 'til you drop,5.0,,"Great place to shop, eat and watch the world go by!"
,,shopping road,4.0,,Well this is a road where you will find lots of shopping malls all the way. the price of article depends on what you are looking for as the international brands tends to be a bit expensive but prices vary from the shopping malls like the 'Tangs' and the 'Lucky Plaza'. Whatever it remains a good place to do some shopping.
,,shopping.,3.0,,"what else in here beside shopping, from luxury mall, to ordinary available in here."
,,brand lovers paradise,4.0,,"a bit too crowded, but does have all the brands and mall experience you can imagine...head to lower floors of ION mall for local brands."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,I have shopped in Orchid road last trip I would say it is one of the best areas for shopping in Singapore But the underground shopping areas are also good Do both if you can
,,Expensive,5.0,,"It's really expensive then my country. I went there and surprised to see that all branded items are really expensive, infact cheaper in my country. Yes, Lucky Plaza was cheap and good to buy the things from there."
,,Take your walking shoes!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is nearlly 2.5kms of shops - so pack the comfy shoes and enjoy the wander.
There's shop fronts, brand names, small and large arcades, multi-level shopping complexes, department stores, jewellers, eateries, bars and everything else you'd expect from the central shopping district.
Singapore is no longer as cheap as it once was, but still some good deals to be had.
And tax back at the airport if you meet the prescribed conditions which helps."
,,SPEND ALOT MONEY,3.0,,Every weeks almost go to orchard and spend much money. Many things look interesting and it makes me disappointed because I don't have more money to buy.hahahah.
,,Decemeber its happening there.very nice at night time. Good for shoppers with lot of discounts.,4.0,,Went there on the Christmas day night and it was really nice and so much happening there. All the shopping malls were nicely decorated and had huge discount sales.. Thought the food also expensive in orchard road..But the food was quiet ok and had a good western selection in most of the shopping mall food courts.
,,Shop till you drop!,4.0,,It is like walking on 5th Ave in New York and you don't have to be Donald Trump to enjoy it!! Anyone can ! There are shops for every budget!

,,Plenty of shops,4.0,,"Plenty of shops, i was here during xmas, it was nicely decorated and it was nice walking around"
,,Wow except for the heat,5.0,,Shopping on Orchard Ave is like being bombarded with brand after brand of designer outlets and of course main street shops. It is best to stay clear of the area during Friday night late night shopping because there are just too many people and getting home via a taxi or public transport involves a big line up. With the large numbers of shopping centres along the street it is best to have a bit of a plan with what you are looking for. Take water with you to stay rehydrated. When outisde the shopping centres it is very hot and being downtown there feels like there is no fresh air.
,,"Tangs, and other shops,,, shops and shops.",3.0,,"We spent a lot of time roaming around the shops in Orchard Road. In the main an interesting experience, but not very worthwhile as we believed they were mainly too expensive. We found goods more expensive than in most capitals in Australia."
,,Shopaholic avenue,4.0,,"I was not aware that Leo Sayer's song was actually about a street in Singapore. Malls, shops, etc but anuhow a nice road as well for a walk. Maserati's and Ferrari , galore"
,,Nice to look around,4.0,,"With all the premium brands on display, the street can be visited to look around, and shop if one can afford the brands. The thing is - such a shopping area can be found in other parts of the world too, so am not sure why one would spend too much time here, apart from a couple of hours."
,,Colourful and Amazing Street,5.0,,"The orchard road is a must visit when you are insingapore. Walking from one end of the orchard to the other( which is really not possible if done )will cover all the fashion labels in one go.This street is accesible from the Orchard or Somerset MRT, dotted with many malls housing all brands of fashion labels and food courts to pamper all taste buds. To mention a few- wisma atria,. orchard central , orchard plaza and centrepoint are not to be missed.l One can spend a whole day shopping to hearts content and also satisfying their hunger .Christmas is one time when the entire street is bathed in colour a sight cannot be described."

,,Overrated,3.0,,"Crowded, same shops as everywhere else around the world, overrated in my opinion."
,,Shop till you drop!,5.0,,I kept busy for a whole day and didn't even scratch the surface. If you like shopping this is the place for you! Good range of stores from really cheap to midrange to really expensive.
,,feels heaven for shopaholics,5.0,,ION is the newest mall so far when I visited last December 2011... it's a long strip of malls that offer cheap to expensive goods... better to visit during Christmas season since there are a lot of attractive lights during night time and different exhibits they feature...come across the elephant exhibit and a big christmas tree we climbed for picture taking
,,One of the most empresive streets in the world,5.0,,"This is one of the most impressive streets in the world. More impressive than 5th avenue. You will find all the malls, luxury shops, shops and more shops. It is 1 hours walk from start to end."

,,Expensive but a must,3.0,,Mostly international brand. Overall shopping in Singapore is expensive but some bargain still can be found. Try Tangs and Far East Plaza.
,,Shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Lots of great western shopping malls but my favourites are the old ones, such as Lucky Plaza and at top end, Tanglin Shopping Centre (not the mall). Hopefully these won't be demolished along with most of Singapore's historic and quaint buildings."
,,"shopping is nice, hookers, not so nice",3.0,,Shops galore! Only downside is amount of prostitutes cat-calling my husband while we shopped- got a little annoying and creepy.
,,Many Shopping malls around,4.0,,Look out for Brand name shops! The price is lower than many other countries in Southeast Asia.
,,A shopper's nirvana,4.0,,"It really is a shopper's paradise, haven, and dream come true. You'll see everything from small shops to very high-end designer department stores. Huge signs with ""Gucci"" or ""LV"" everywhere. It can be a little overwhelming. But definitely worth a trip, even if you only window-shop."
,,Amazing Shopping,5.0,,"The shopping here is very high end and classy, there is nothing you can't get, but you will pay for it. Orchard Rd is very modern and looks like something from the future. I myself love a bargain so go to Little India to the Mufasa Centre it is cheap and has everything."
,,Nice to take a walk and relax,3.0,,"Good place with many shopping malls , famous stores , restaurants and bars. Need to go there and just walk along Orchard road to say you were in Singapore. Not one of my favorite places but its a place you should go anyway. More for people who are interested in buying clothes or similars. Ive enjoyed anyway, just walking around and checking things out."
,,low priority,3.0,,"I love to shop, but most stores on this road are the same big name chains that I can find in my city. They are not unique Singapore experience. So I recommend this as a low priority."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"Best shopping in the world. Constantly changing, always worth a visit. Takashimaya is our favourite, especially the food hall."
,,Boring,2.0,,"Boring. As Philip Lee (singaporean journalist) wrote in his book ""Fridays with Philip"" ""Orchard Road lacks life and soul""."

,,Bright lights,3.0,,"Since we were here during the Christmas season, the street was lined with bright, beautiful and colorful lights. A lot of people are on the street."
,,Busy but worth visiting,5.0,,"Great selection of shops but can be expensive. You tend to find the same designer stores at each mall and all with the same prices. For us apart from some electrical goods there was little else of good value. Many shops appeared to be doing little or any trade, perhaps a reflection on the prices?"
,,Street of Malls,4.0,,"So many malls along this street, make any lady happy with the shopping things :)"
,,loved it,4.0,,was in seventh heaven with all the high end shops. Have to go back soon.

,,Good Shopping and Food- Very Singaporean!,5.0,,Orchard Road is one of the major shopping districts. Make sure to stop by the Takashimiya department store. The basement is filled with food stands. Great place to eat and try local foods.
,,Shopaholic,5.0,,If you enjoy shopping malls this is the place to be. Prices are expensive compared to the UK but you're spoilt for choice here.
,,Shopping and Eating,3.0,,"On the road is basically arrays of expensive boutiques. Be careful, during Sundays can be extremely packed with helpers/maids who are taking Sundays off. If you're tired of brands like LV, Prada, etc, then you might want to check Lucky Plaza, where they sell local (made in China) souvenirs, some cheap but good eating places, or some goods from the Philippines. It'll also be useful to check Takashimaya website to check the event held on their Basement 1 level. Usually people are aiming for their toy fair or baby fair, where you can get toys and baby stuffs at a discounted price."
,,Masses of shops,4.0,,Orchard road is a shoppers paradise with countless shopping malls and cafes. A lot of the shops were for the very rich as it was mainly designer and some of the smaller outlets sold quite a bit of tat. it is a great experience just...More
,,Shopping World,3.0,,"No other word from me for Orchard Road, it's a shopping world! Or Shopping heaven? Ha.. There is so many malls. Between mall and mall it's possible that you find same branded store, so you have to search here and there to find the store...More"

,,"Walk, shop, walk, shop !",5.0,,if you like to shops then you should walk! it's heaven for shoppaholic. :)
,,Overrated Shopping Street,2.0,,There are more interesting places to visit in Singapore than Orchard Road. It seems to me that Pavillion and Marina Bay are the new shopping hot spots.
,,Shop till you drop !!!,5.0,,"The ""mile long"" avenue of shopping malls or plazas, shopping centres, and specialty shops can tire you out. But I like Takashimaya as it has almost everything ""under one roof"" including food courts at the basement serving wonderful local dishes that Singaporeans love (take notice...More"
,,Orchard Road - Shop Shop Shop,4.0,,What a street for power shopping. Huge buildings on both sides daring all to enter. Definitely interesting to see all this retail and wonder how can all these stores / shops be supported. I would hate to go there on a weekend. Or maybe not!!...More
,,Good place to hang out but not to shop,3.0,,"(+) Nice place to hang out, take pictures or just window shopping (-) Not much different to most of the shopping malls in other countries, could not buy anything if you're on a tight budget"
,,Caters to tourists,2.0,,Orchard Road caters mostly to tourists. Most locals will not venture there unnecessarily. Most items over-priced. Locals know of better places to buy stuff.
,,What an experience! Don't go on Sunday.,3.0,,We (my husband and me and another married couple) made the mistake of visiting Orchard Road on a Sunday. It was raining heavily and the crowd was enormous which made it frustrating and impossible to really shop seriously. It wasn't long before we had to make our escape back to our hotel (Marina Mandarin...fantastic!) and a welcome sojourn in the Meritus Club Lounge to allow us to recuperate. We ventured out again to Orchard Road some days later and were able to enjoy an excellent and much less frantic day of shopping.
,,Just like any shopping strip anywhere in the world,4.0,,"Orchard road is lined with hundreds of shops mostly high end. Louis Vuitton , Burberry, ferragamo etc etc etc. they are all here. There is not much difference in prices compared to any big cities .

The real shopping where you get the local flavor are in little India, and Chinatown."
,,Shop till you are down,5.0,,The christmas decorations were amazing and the road included almost everything to shop.
,,Love it or hate it. I didn't love it.,3.0,,"A stretch of high-end malls for high-end consumers. While I can understand the appeal (and there must be an appeal for it to remain in business), it is not what I came to Asia for. The selection is neither bargain nor exclusive; the malls are sterile and snobbish. If you enjoy rummaging through ""stuff"" that you won't easily find at home (Europe, North America), go to the Mustafa Center in Little India for some more eclectic finds at a lower price tag. I must say, however, that the food in these malls is truly outstanding. Those familiar only with Western-style mall ""food courts"" will be duly impressed."
,,It has everything,5.0,,"and then some. Iconic. voted number one shopping street in the world and you can see why. it has it all from designer heaven to electronics, fashion, books, golf clubs and of course, being singapore, a myriad of places to eat to cater for all tastes and budgets. vibrant and exciting 24 hours a day"
,,How many shopping malls,4.0,,"How many shopping malls can be found in one street, it is well worth the experience of simplu going for a walk, but don't go early as most of the shops don't open till late morning as they are open till late at night.

It's a shopping experience that can't be missed."
,,shoppers paradise.,5.0,,what else can I say other than its a shoppers paradise and really more than anyone can take in but you wont be short of any type of shop selling the latest fashions and top brand name articles.
,,over rated,3.0,,We went to Orchard road twice lots of flash shops and in my opinion does not reflect the true Singapore Beware of some of the shops in lucky plaza they will try to RIP you off so check your prices before hand and check what you sign still its a day out.
,,The People Watching Mecca of Singapore,5.0,,"It is fun to people watch on Orchard Road, different days of the week and at different times of the day. One can observe a wide cross section of Singapore's population. Weekdays and weekends are very different, and on Sunday it takes on a completely different vibe. The lights at night are spectacular, particularly around the various festivals in Singapore. It is the place to go for the best and brightest Christmas light shows in Asia. As you proceed from the Ion, down past Orchard Central, you can see everything from high end designer brand flagship stores, all the way to hawkers slicing ice-cream and sandwiching it between sweet bread. Watch for the bead-man who swings mega sized wood bead necklaces as well as other entertainment. Stop for a refreshment at one of the pubs up Emerald Street which has a great assortment of history shop-houses, beautifully restored."
,,Fantastic Shopping,5.0,,Great place to shop and enjoy the hawker food in the food courts.
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,"Nice to walk around and browse. Lots of choices, stores,and selections."
,,Give yourself a day,4.0,,"Take advantage of the ""hop on hop off"" bus service that goes along Orchard Road, fab shops do them all!"
,,So many brands,3.0,,We found Orchard Road a bit like Groundhog day. So many shopping malls and almost all the same shops. We found better shopping in the more out of the way places. But it depends on your shopping tastes and goals.
,,FANTASTIC SHOPPING,4.0,,"I love the shopping at Orchard Road. It has everything from household to clothes, shoes, bags. I like to shop at Takashimya, CentrePoint and Plaza Singapura."
,,rat race,2.0,,"overcrowded, rude, rushed, poor options, reptitive... frankly not an experience worth repeating unless you are forced to meet people there try and avoid it. High priced boutique shops - how many Tiffany's does anyone need to visit? how many shoppoing malls ??"
,,Variety,4.0,,Plenty to choose from shops and restaurants. If you are prepared to spend the time then discounts can be found. Just be prepared to line up.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"The best shopping in the world, one gets amazed at the no and quality of malls in one single road.. the orchard trees give the road a very sceninc look."
,,Shopping Haven,5.0,,Just shop and shop til you drop. Lots of food places too. There's something for everyone. But it is very crowded.
,,Paging Shopaholics! :-),4.0,,"A long road lined with shopping malls and high end stores!

It is my 2nd visit along this famous Orchard road and I am fascinated to see how many people go there on a Sunday.

If you have got the money then splurge!

Happy shopping, dahlings! :-)"
,,If you like to shop...this place is for you,5.0,,I have never seen so many shopping malls. Some are filled with high-end designer stores and others have crammed in boutiques with the cutest clothes and accessories. There are also lots of hair and nail salons and places to eat. I could have spent days shopping on Orchard Rd.
,,Very nice walk even if you're not a shopper-holic!,5.0,,"Just star walking from the start (where the Hard Rock Cafe is settled) and take a look of the magnificent shopping complexs this street has. We actually did not shop anything at all (besides a yummi ice-cream) but just by walking you'll enjoy seeing so many different people, places, buildings, etc.
I Highly recommend to take a time to FEEL the reason why ORCHAD road is SO famous!!!. Enjoy!!!..."
,,It provides everything,3.0,,"I am serious, you can find everything here. Ranging from imitation clock and jewelery, food from various countries, the top brand outlets, to the shops that sells a variety of ""personal equipment"". But to be honest, I really like coming here not for shopping, but sitting under the big trees and have a look at lots of people passing by. It's very entertaining, especially if you sit and eat $1 Ice Cream uncle that you can find easily along this road :)
Try shopping at one of the souvenir shop in Lucky Plaza. I forget the name of the shop, but if you enter from the left side door of Lucky Plaza, you will immediately see it. This shop provides good collection, ranging from silk garments to the miniature bus Sentosa Island."
,,Shopping!,5.0,,"Its was cool just to see as its impossible to imagine that many malls on one street! Most of it is up scale shopping but there is a huge forever 21 and H&M where I found some awesome deals and also some local cheaper stuff around the corner, but cool to see."
,,Shopping,4.0,,You have a good range of shopping options along this stretch. The malls themselves are relatively kid friendly.
,,Shopping Belt never ends,5.0,,I was on Orchard yesterday and there are a lot shopping malls. All the high-street brands are there. Only thing I did not like is the crowd. Too crowded. And of course very hot.
,,Too many shops,4.0,,"If you want to shop til you drop this is an ideal place. There are so many shopping centres, but a lot of the shops are repeated in the centres."
,,"Shopping, shopping and more shopping!",5.0,,"Don't go shopping on Orchard Rd if you're looking for bargains, although there's still plenty there if you look in the right places. This is where you find the genuine big brand names. The prices are still cheaper than Australia and, with the current exchange rate, a lot of items work out to be quite reasonable. Around Scotts Rd, there's plenty of little souvenir type shops/stalls where you can pick up all the tacky stuff, although Chinatown and Little India are better for these. Take the time to have a good look at all there is to see - Chanel, Louis Vuiton, Coach, Pandora - it's all there."
,,good place to visit,4.0,,"good place to visit, plenty of food outlet options to choose from..."
,,The very best in Shopping,5.0,,"Take a stroll and enjoy the clean and bright stores, if you enjoy shopping you'll enjoy Orchid Road, plenty of duty free, cafes, restaurants and plenty to do for all tastes."
,,Shop till you drop,3.0,,A lot of different types of shops and shopping malls. If you want to do some shopping this is the place. Nothing special in my opinion though and the prices were not that cheap either.
,,Ah Orchard,5.0,,"this strip of a road had something for everyone . The newest mall ION has all the major brands under one roof . Takashimaya has the most fabulous art store called Art friend , if you are looking for supplies . The food court at NGEE ANN or Takashimaya basement are great. Try the tu-tu keh and the mango pomelo ( both sweet !!!For the book worm there is KinoKiniya also at Takashi !!!John little always haas some bargains going . Somerset 313 has the resto LE MARCHE a great place The bortsch served there is yummy ...easy access by MRT or cab ,"
,,Everything you need.,4.0,,"Great for last minute shopping for those who are short of time. Has everything from small to big brands, from fashion, food to gadgets, cheap to premium, expensive items, all in the comforts of air-conditioned malls."
,,Modern shopping area,5.0,,Very nice and very modern area to shopping or simple to walk around.
,,Permanent shelter,3.0,,"You have to give it to Orchard Road, especially how it can shelter you from one place (I mean, mall) to another when it rains. Almost world-renowned, not quite sure if the repetitive luxury shops are necessary though. Strolling along orchard road in the wee hours with friends is quite an experience, when its all quiet."
,,Good,3.0,,This street was good but nothing amazing. But still very nice.
,,good place to move around,4.0,,"Good Place for Clubbing , Pubbing and party around lot of places for the same"
,,A street full of malls and redundant shops,3.0,,"It's my first time to Singapore so I'm just checking out what's the hype about this Orchard road.
Ok it's a serious shopper's heaven.
not for me though but worth the experience to see a road full of malls on both sides.
the first mall I went to is ION orchard, it's a new one and full of boutique shops.
Well what i like the most about this mall is their food court (i think it's called food hall) serves quality food.
If this is your first time to south east asia, you definitely should try the Oyster Omelette and Nasi Padang here. Nasi Padang is a rice dish with variety of side dishes to choose from and it's originated from Indonesia.
I also tried the dimsum here from a mobile vendor inside the food court but it's not the best that i've ever tasted. just OK.
There's also a tea place where they serves tea from all around the world in this mall..which i love. and you can buy the tea there too. it smells like heaven.

All in all Singapore is a very clean and organized city. i love it. in that sense.
we spent more than 6hours on Orchard Road and still havent check out everything.
Well everything looks repeated anyway."

,,A happening place,5.0,,"Love Orchard Road. Everything is there. Shopping, eating, lights, fun."
,,Shop til you drop,5.0,,"I was blown away with how much quality shopping you could find on the main shopping road. I walked around for hours just to realize i havent covered half of it yet. ""flagship class"" stores for all the brands you can imagine (except Apple)

I was expecting more electronics though."

,,100 million dollar shack,5.0,,Walk along Orchard Rd and stop and look at the Thai Embassy. Sitting on what has to be the most expensive real estate on the island is a building in need of a major overhaul......
,,Great!,5.0,,The street is full of bright neon lights and hordes of people. You could find there everything you need from state of the art computer to handmake silk scarf. Shopping is really too expensive and I would say a bit old-fashioned compared with Italy. The restaurants cater for all tastes. I’d personally recommend Sushi Tei for seafood lovers.
,,Christmas lights!,5.0,,"Went to Orchard rd specifically to see the christmas light displays...and it was fantastic...so amazing!! An absolute must for everyone to see (wrong time of year now tho!)
Didnt actually go shopping there, but if you are into 'brand' names...this is the place to go for sure!"
,,A hassle,3.0,,"It's a hassle going there during weekends n public holidays as traffic is extremely congested.Moreover,if one were to drive there,it gotta be very early in order to get a parking lot."
,,Wear comfortable shoes,5.0,,You could shop here for days and never repeat a store or restaurant.

,,Biggest Shopping Destination in Singapore,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the hub of Singapore's shopping district, it has a huge shopping malls, plazas and arcades!

,,You've gotta visit this place!,5.0,,"Shop! Shop! Shop! If you've not visited Orchard Road, you're not visited Singapore. No words can describe this street."
,,Overwhelming shopping opportunity,3.0,,Staying at the Hilton leaves you right in the heart of the Road. Brand after brand in shopping mall after shopping mall. It's pretty overwhelming and certainly could not be described as cheap. 120 Singa dollars for a pair of shorts in Abercrombie and Fitch. Gulp.
,,Best place for shopping!,5.0,,Orchard Road has everything when it comes to shopping. It's a must when visiting Singapore.
,,"Good shops, spread afar and with a hefty price",2.0,,"Nothing at all like London's Oxford road. Long road with a lot of ugly malls. Some contain good storers but a lot of them are just rubbish with cheap crap and food courts. The prices are pretty much the steepest I have seen around great shopping cities and the only allowed for minimal designer shopping. Some decent electronics shops can still be found but I would much rather use Orchard as a nice sight during my trip. If you need to buy overpriced designer stuff from Singapore stick to Marina Sands, at least in Marina there are decent places to get drunk while doing your stuff..."
,,A venture,5.0,,"Beautifuk expensive shops.!, were here 30 years ago and the changes - WOW I didn't recognise Orchard Road. Beautiful hotels,"
,,Great area for shopping,5.0,,Everything at your fingertips within walking distance. All Airconditioned shopping centres.

,,Good for shopping,3.0,,Soo many shopping malls/centers along Orchard road!! Quite a few stores are replicated in the various malls. We enjoyed Orchard ION the best which had a large variety of stores and a good food court right next to the MRT.
,,Shopping Malls,3.0,,"Malls that go on forever, a shopper's paradise. People friendly and helpful everywhere."
,,nice to shop,5.0,,"excellent place for shopping, fun and enjoyment. day time can shop in big malls. night time thrilling expereince in orchard towers pubs.."
,,Not too sure on shopping mecca,3.0,,"Everyone says to visit Orchard Road, but personally I found it to be overpriced compared to same labels elsewhere and just a bit frantic. Marina Bay was much better for the high end stores, and Singpaore has lots of shopping malls and choices. Glad I did it, but only once and I spent my money mostly elsewhere."
,,Shopping Galore,5.0,,You haven't been to Singapore if you haven't shopped at Orchard Road. :)
,,Here you can buy anything...anything,4.0,,"I stay here at Orchard Park suites and it was a really nice area, one huge mall in my opininon for shopping, eating, and clubbing. Very Fun"

,,Shop Shop Shop,5.0,,If you have a Bank Roll.....Break it out this is the place to shop till you drop.
,,Ho Hum but good for the Fashion Conscientious,3.0,,"Way over the top for my budget. if you have been to NYC, this is just another grand mall."
,,A place to spent money on shopping!!,4.0,,"During the weekends,i will usually go there for shopping with my family or friends."
,,"Lots of shops, lots of people, but missing a certain something",3.0,,"Orchard Road is basically a line of enormous air conditioned malls, running from one end to the other. Each mall is slightly different - the Paragon is a big glass box, the ION is an alien spaceship made out of neon lights and Louis Vuitton - but all kind of similar - there's only so much differentiation of escalators, air conditioning and glass.

Thus it's a good place to buy expensive things, or to watch people, but it doesn't really feel like it has the requisite buzz or soul of smaller, more idiosyncratic shopping districts in the rest of the world, and there doesn't seem to be a natural centre to it if you wanted to go bar hopping."
,,Orchard Road Shopping,4.0,,"There is such a great variety of shops and plenty of bargains if you look. Certainly Singapore isn't cheap, but the shopping is great."
,,"Just the same shops, over and over and over",3.0,,"Whilst you really have to see it for yourself, how many times can you look at Dior, Gucci, LV et al and not get a little bored. Honestly, I would not be able to afford a pair of socks in this street, it's Collins Street, Melbourne times 1,000! I found it all a little boring. Wouldn't bother going back again."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Plenty of shops to make the walk worthwhile. Quality fashion, electronics and accessories."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,A must see - but if you go for more than window shopping be sure to have deep pockets. Mostly very expensive but very nice shops and huge department shops.
,,Come here at the end of the year for decorations!,4.0,,"You get everything here as the entire road is filled with shopping malls, so you will shop til you drop! Asides from the malls, the best thing is to come here at the year end to see the brilliant lightings, Christmas trees they have put up and the decoration along the road. Very fascinating"
,,Wow!,5.0,,"This is one hell of a shopping district. From Versace, Prada, D&G et al. Particularly liked the plethora of shopping malls and the vast array of wares on sale in each. The whole Road just was awesome."
,,"Expensive, expensive - not like the old days!",4.0,,"I remember Orchard Road in 1965 as a place where you waited 15 minutes to cross the road, where every vehicle blew its horn every few seconds, and the smell of durian would clear a building if it got into the air conditioning! I remember the makan stalls, the night markets (pasar malam) and hotels like the Singapura (great piano bar), C.K. Tangs and the shophouses full of flowers, cane furniture etc. It's all gone now of course, with huge department stores and specialty shops on the street.

It's a sign of the times, but to me Orchard Road will always be bamboo scaffolding outside buildings under construction, Hakka women with their coolie hats and bamboo rods over their shoulders bringing the building materials in and all the wonderful smells and sights of a real Asian city. (Don't miss the smell of the monsoon drains, but it just aint the same these days!)"
,,Like the Gold Coast on steroids,3.0,,Really I have to admit I'd been told by many people not to go there. I was told it was a little sleazy and ofcourse very expensive but I felt I had to atleast see it and experience for myself otherwise I would be missing out. Worst part of our entire trip.
,,U get everything here......,5.0,,U get lost here for hours just because U have too many choices to do your shopping!
,,Shop til you drop !,5.0,,"If you cannot buy it on Orchard Road, you just cannot get it elsewhere."
,,Don't understand the hype,3.0,,People go on about the shopping but I didn't see anything out of the ordinary compared to other high-end shopping areas around the road. Walking outside was nice to see the mix between urban settings with beautiful trees; but again I've seen that at other places. A skip in my mind unless you want to burn money is Singapore dollars compared to your local currency.
,,whatever you want,4.0,,"if you are in singapore for shopping... go out and venture. you can certainly find it all. one mall next to the other and I eventually stopped counting on how many rolex, Louis vuiton, Chanel, cartier or burberry shops I saw. you can also find asian products, but you need to kind of search for them by now. The singaporeans love shopping - so try and avoid the weekend in Orchard Road and the malls as it will be full - very full.
the ION caters for everything you could possibly wish for and more."

Visitors to Singapore should at least once visit this shoppng paradise.

there are many good places to eat as well, but you need to find them"
,,Great Shopping Area,4.0,,Great Shopping Area and convenience by using Subway to other area
,,Consumerism in its extreme form,1.0,,The temple of consumption to its extreme. Shops-shops-shos-restaurants-shops... The only place you can see queues in front of LV and Chanel shops.

,,Shops shops and more shops,4.0,,"The title tells the story, there is not shortage of shops and malls along the entire length of the Orchard Rd. But, some of the stores do repeat from mall to mall. Take the walk, there are plenty of places to get out of the heat and take a drink, and of course, no shortage of places to eat. If you like shopping, you will be in heaven."
,,Great for shopping and entertainment,5.0,,How can you come to Singapore and not go to Orchard Road?
,,Too Much Shopping!,5.0,,"Orchard Road features many things besides the upscale western brands. At Lucky Plaza, you can see the Filipina maids sending their remittances. At the Somerset MRT, the shopping plaza you walk through to get to Orchard Road has a great bakery.
At the Dhoby Ghaut MRT, you can walk through the station to Plaza Singapura, one my favorite Singapore shopping centers."

,,"SHOP, SHOP AND MORE SHOPS",4.0,,"If you like shopping this is the place to come. You have all the big names here, but be aware - they are expensive."
,,Orchard Road is more than shopping mecca,5.0,,"I love Orchard Road - to see it as just another shopping street is REALLY REALLY MISSING the whole point of what makes it unique. Yes, there are many shops and shopping malls (given the strong SGD, don't expect the prices here to be a bargain) here, in fact kilometres long stretching from Tanglin Mall to Dhoby Ghaut. The shops at Orchard cater mainly to the mid and upper-tiers (given the high rents), if you are looking for cheap goods, you should head off to Chinatown and Bugis (where there is a great street market).

Main selling point: Orchard (as the name suggest) was previously a place full of plantations. Therefore, from the moment you hit the Orchard belt (which IMO should start from Tanglin Mall), you are greeted with beautiful landscaped greenery alongside beautiful shopping malls/ hotels / embassy. The lush greenery of Orchard is what makes it stand out - besides the long stretch of shopping malls. The greenery whether day and night is a wonderful oasis of calm, at night, the white street lightings create a different ambience. Come Christmas, Orchard is all dressed up with beautiful Christmas lightings!

Shop at the many malls (many international brands are represented here), savour food from around the world at food courts / restaurants / street kiosks, people-watch at the many cafes, enjoy street performances every weekends, catch a movie, catch the energy of the youth at Scape Park, skateboards at Somerset, enjoy an oasis of calm at the colonial-era residential district of Emily Hill (right at Somerset), go for traditional Singaporean-style breakfast at Killiney (Somerset), admire the interesting architecture of Orchard including the iconic Chinese pagoda style Tangs Plaza (where Marriott stands) and new malls with their colorful lights facade...

Orchard is unique and a very attractive place to just window-shop / people watch even if you don't have the budget - it was recently voted as the world's best shopping street. Don't just come here to shop - but for the full experience that Orchard has to offer!"
,,Central spot of Singapore,4.0,,"Orchard Road its exactly what its Charms in Paris, mile of fashion big names, known restaurants, food places and exclusive shops, its nice to visit and would be even nicer to book there a hotel and be so central and close to the sub station"
,,Popular for Tourists,4.0,,This is mainly a shopping area for tourists. Prices range from average to very expensive. Very conveniently located and languages especially English is not an issue at all.
,,A typical street of busy shops.,3.0,,"A typrical street of busy shops. But make sure you go and visit the VISITOR CENTER for up to date information, maps and transport timetables. The staff were very helpful."
,,Shop til you drop (10 x over),5.0,,Hide out from the afternoon heat in one of many air-con shopping complexes on Orchard Rd its guarrenteed you will return with a lighter wallet!
,,Great place for shopping designer stuff,4.0,,"It's a long strip of mostly high-end shopping malls and a few corporate offices. It's a great place to get designer stuff but cheap items can be found at Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza.

My visit isn't really a great time as there were several constructions going on which made me walk a longer route. Nonetheless, still a place worth going to."
,,Over-rated and over-priced,3.0,,Why pay these prices when Chinatown and Bugis have the same goods at lesser prices.
,,From high streets fashion to high end labels!,4.0,,Orchard Road is one of the best place for shopping! Must go during GSS(great singapore sales)!
,,Orchrad Road,5.0,,"Too much not too like, always busy, always so much to see and do, too little time as always"
,,A nice place to spend a night and shopping in Singapore,4.0,,"Good place to hang out with your friend or family also a good place to spend your money. Be aware with the deceiver, they'll try to offer you with some sweat deal such as lottery or many things and put you in trouble as you never thought before. Most of the tourist come to Sin for shopping and when the they find something interesting and trying to get the price down from the display price, some hawker (very little number but can be find easily) take this as a ""must buy"" thing and become unfriendly when you decide to buy it. Be careful when you trying to buy something on the street."
,,Not worth coming to shop here from Europe,3.0,,"This is shopping street for shoppaholics. There are numerous shopping malls some good, some not. If you are looking for luxury brands this is the place. Being shoppaholic myself this would work for me during Sale but I don´t think that other times I find good enought bargains to spend my holiday here. For me it is not worth flying 12 hours just to shop here. I get most of this stuff same prices and closer in Europe. Still I am happy I checked this place If I ever come back it is The Great Singapore Sale."
,,Shopping Mecca,5.0,,If you enjoy shopping this is where you end up sooner or later when you are in Singapore. Big shopping malls with all the designer brands at nice prices. There's plenty of restaurants and we especially enjoyed some western food after traveling in south east asia for a couple of months mostly on a diet of rice/nudles and chicken :)
,,shop till you drop,4.0,,"Never seen so many shopping centres before, selling absolutely everything. The prices arent cheap any more, but on par or even a little higher than UK prices. Lots of high end shops makes for impressive malls, but where are the cheap high street shops? definitely worth a visit though for the sheer scale of the place"
,,Shopping Shopping Shopping,3.0,,"I'm letting my personality take over on this one ... I love shopping but Orchard road wasn't anything extraordinary. Yes, it had great shops/stores (and tons of them) but nothing that really grabbed me. There are plenty of places to eat on Orchard Rd - with some amazing foods - but this place doesn't do it for me. Going once to see it and say you've done it was enough for me. If you're looking for souvenirs/nick-knacks, go to Chinatown."
,,great stores,5.0,,the most important street in singapore for shopping
,,Amazing,4.0,,"If you like shopping and Asian (not only) fashion you are in the right place. Singapore is really great for the shopping lovers, even for me it was just too much ;). The Christmas lights and decorations are just mad and over the top, it is great to see it though. I would recommend going over December and have a stroll around."
,,Heaven,5.0,,Shopping!!!! yaye!! Lots of shops you cant tell when one shopping center turns into the next! A must visit for any woman
,,A shopping street,3.0,,It is nothing more than a long shopping street with extremely expensive luxury brands. We drove through it and that was perfectly enough. There is nothing special or interesting on this particular street unless you are in Singapore to spend your money.
,,Bustling side of the Island,4.0,,"If you have never been to Orchard Road, you have never been to Singapore. After traveling around the world for a while, I tend to appreciate the order and cleanliness when I am there. I could just sit at a cafe, read my book, and not to be disturbed by the smoke from the vehicle's exhaust pipe zooming by."
,,Spend a day and get a bargin,5.0,,"Well known road and I can see why we spent a full day in Orchid Road and still never got it all done look for the shops that are hidden away they are the best for a bargin and dont forget to haggle they love it
Try anyone of the different places to eat there is plenty of them and make sure you arrange a taxi or something to get back to your hotel room with all your shopping bags ENJOY"
,,Do your homework !!,4.0,,Orchard Road is full of all sorts of exciting places to spend your money. I can only suggest that you do your homework with regard to tailored clothes etc. Had a suit made at Tony's Fashions which was quite good and also had two shirts made which were supposed to be silk. They were in fact microfibre and i think i paid too much as well but lessons are there to be learned.
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,Need i say more? Make sure you spend some time here. The crowd can be a bit overwhelming especially during holiday seasons. But that's part of the fun. :)
,,Wow what a shoppers paradise,4.0,,Great place loads of shops of all kinds from designer to cheaper you could not ask for more apart from sore feet ha ha
,,shopping-shopping,5.0,,"everything is here: mall, food, hotel, etc. walking around the orchard road was great."
,,Shopping,4.0,,"Busy shopping street, especially during sale. Personally, i prefer shopping in Hong Kong."
,,very commercial,3.0,,very commercial and super noisy - you feel it is a place for rich people coming to spend and show - lack soul to some extent
,,shopping street paved with GOLD!,4.0,,endless shopping just like a GIANT Mall coming together.
,,Shopping Malls Galore,5.0,,"Having travelled to many countries, I must say that Orchard Road is still my favorite shopping destination. Shoppers are spoilt for choice with new malls regularly appearing as dated ones are demolished or upgraded. There are shops everywhere to suit every budget. Best of all, you don't have to wait for the Great Singapore Sale to get good bargains !"
,,Only if you love to shop...,4.0,,... but worth a look even you hate shopping. The sheer volume of high-end luxury stores is amazing and definitely provides lots of choice. Interesting as well were the mini-Macca's on the kerb edge that are like an oversized street vendors stall!
,,Copycats everywhere,3.0,,It is all the same old boring mid to high end brands. Who wants to jostle with the maddening crowd?
,,A great shopping destination...,4.0,,"Orchard Road is all about the shopping. There are plenty of malls, shops and stores on both sides of the road featuring most of the well known brands from around the world."
,,"Nice for shoppers, overwhelming for anyone else",4.0,,"I liked that Orchard Road offers every shop, store, cafe, restaurant and other consumer desire that you could want; I didn't like that it's so overwhelming (malls within malls along a very long road) that you literally could get over stimulated just walking two blocks. Perfect for those who love to shop!"
,,i don't like to shop but if you must...,3.0,,"this has got to be one of the nicest shopping strips, even for a non shopper. but it is the same shops in every other shopping centre"
,,Too much,3.0,,"This is an area where you are never more than 100m from a designer shop and never more than 500m to the same designer shop. Prices are expensive, but remember to ask for you Sales Tax refund to reclaim the tax at the airport. It's easy enough, but remember to have the actual item with you (Refund is at the Check In area) in case customs want to see it. All refunds are in cash."
,,Another street to shop till you drop,3.0,,"Best to catch MRT to Orchard then walk down to Somerset. If Orchard Rd was a price scale, then you will find all the luxury brands at Orchard whilst the more you head down towards Somerset the cheaper the stuff gets."
,,Shopping Mecca,4.0,,"If you like shopping malls, you will love this place. Every designer franchise in the world has got to be here somewhere. I was told there are 40-some shopping MALLS on this road within a stretch of about 3 miles. It is incredible. I was not here to shop, but did find it to be an ultra-modern part of the city with loads of restaurants, food courts, and electronics super stores."
,,Spectacular at Christmas,4.0,,"Were fortunate enough to arrive after all the decorations for Christmas had been set up. The displays were amazing and added a fantastic feel to the street. The Elephant Parade was also taking place and there were a painted statues everywhere which only served to enhance the atmosphere.

Shopping was fantastic as expected (and I'm not one that usually enjoys shopping centres and the like)."
,,Shopping at it's best,5.0,,"If you like designer goods you will love Orchard, if you can't find it here it doesn't exist. Cleanest shopping street in the world and the best"
,,love it,5.0,,I love orchard road sooo much.....so many filipinos and it felt so home
,,If you enjoy culture you will hate Orchard Road,2.0,,"We've lived in Singapore for over year now and still will do anything to avoid this part of town. Tacky mall architecture, constant blaring pop music and throngs of tourists all getting their picture in front of one of the LV locations (I believe there are 5). The shops are not worth the fight to get to them. If you end up down here and need a bit of quiet try going into Paragon. Usually there's someone playing piano on the first floor and the general ambiance is more subdued. Some reasonably good quality mid-range stores are on the 2nd and 3rd floors."
,,stopped going there.,2.0,,"too crowded, too overpriced. its better just to shop or go around the neighborhood estates coz you will get almost the same thing - minus the crowds ... and who knows, even cheaper also."
,,Like shopping!,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise, with many malls, worth the visit if only for the experience."
,,Shops Closed during Chinese New Year,4.0,,Beware Chinese travelers if you wanna have thorough Orchard Road shopping experience. Most (about 70%) of the shops along the fabulous Orchard Rd were closed during CNY and you might end up window shopping.
,,"Shoppers paradise, but not for me",3.0,,"Excellent place for higher end shoppers with a lot of stores. Since I have adversion to shopping, it was not for me."
,,Blah,3.0,,Some would love it I'm sure - it's just a load of shops
,,Very fun place to spend the day or evening.,4.0,,"Orchard road was such a delight while in Singapore. We spent two of our evenings walking up and down the busy sidewalks. There is every kind of shopping imaginable, from H&M to Chanel to little local style boutiques. There are many restaurant choices along with a lovely cinema. Orchard road was great and I highly recommend it."
,,Orchard Road,5.0,,"An incredible shopping mecca. Well worth it to visit the underground supermarkets--plenty of free samples. Numerous places to eat including American chains, but also food courts offering Malay, Thai, Chinese, etc., food. It's a road with beautiful modern buildings and hotels."
,,Beautiful,4.0,,"i was there during Christmas, the whole street is lit up and you could here sound of birds chirping, Mad people shopping all over the place. Robinsons is the only nice plae to visit.

The road is connected by both bus and MRT. MRT is faster way to travel. The street otherwise come lively after 7. Worth going"
,,Busy,3.0,,"Perhaps I am not the shopping kind. Find Orchard Road really busy with people. It it quite difficult to get transport public - very packed. There is a whole range of shopping centres plus good restaurants. However, you would probably need at least 2 days if you really want to go into each shopping centre."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"You name it there is every shop under the sun, shoppers haven!!!"
,,One giant mall,2.0,,No reason to go here unless you need some mall therapy....
,,I could spend days here.......,5.0,,Ion center is really amazing and paragon and takashimya food courts are great. Great eats everywhere and endless amounts of merchandise to look at.
,,The Most Expensive Street for the Upwardly Mobile,1.0,,Fantastic place for the upwardly mobile - buy your show off branded goods here and tell people - no where else will you pay more. Wonderful street. But do watch out for the Bird lime it drops from all the lovely trees especially after raining - as white mist. And beware of bombers on your shirts and blouses [personally got hit x 2].
,,Excellent for shopping,5.0,,"If u like shopping, Orchard Road is a must place to go in Singapore. Huge array of shopping malls, cinemas & eating places. Massive variety of merchandise with good quality but prices are not cheap. You can also find any posh & branded boutique from around the world here. Very crowded place and open everyday for late night shopping."
,,Phew,5.0,,Do not walk this in the heat of the day. Really interesting and not to be missed.
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping",5.0,,"If you are a shopper, then this is the place for you! Not much in the way of bars, cafes, etc like you would see in other shopping strips in Chapel St Melbourne or an LA boulevard. My friend and I spent 2 days and lots of money in all the shopping centres. IOM Orchard is probably the best one."
,,Great place despite the traffic on the road,5.0,,"this is a great place to do shopping in Singapore. The things sold here arent as expensive as what people say. If you could not afford the LV or Dior, you can go for the lower end stuffs like Cotton On, Forever 21 or even H & M"
,,Singapore without Orchard is nothing .,4.0,,Both sides of roads are running wiith many malls. All the brands of the world r available with their latest collection . All the varieties of food is also available .
,,Shop till you drop and stay cool,3.0,,"Shopping in Singapore is a must, not because anything is particuarly cheap, but the shopping malls here on Orchard road have some of the finest air conditioning known to man. Expect huge crowds at the weekend as we all clamber to Orchard road to keep cool and hide from the humidity. Orchard road is not the shopping high street to wander around looking for something...my top tip is to only visit there is you have a serious plan and you know where you are going! With a million different malls - you have to know where you are going or the crowds will carry you along to queue outside Chanel."
,,"Go shopping, the best stores in the world",5.0,,"It's fantastic the number of shopping centers and a lot of stores ( Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Aercrombie, and so on ), restaurants, hotels in that avenue. If you want to buy good products, you will find everything at Orchard Road. Good Departaments Stores, good shoppings center, a lot of them ."
,,Shopping heaven,5.0,,"If you like to shop until you drop, this place was made for you!"
,,Shopping is fantastic.,5.0,,I love Orchard Road. There is every shop you can think of here. I especially like the Paragon centre. If you are shopping there with kids there is a kid's play centre near the children's wear. Also check out DinTaiFung downstairs for lunch.
,,Malls everywhere,5.0,,Indeed a shoppers paradise. But bring your wallet or checkbook. Things are quite expensive here.
,,Oxford street on speed,5.0,,An awesome shopping street that will take several days to explore. Visit near Christmas and see lights that make London look like a bunch of cheapskates

,,a MUST to visit,5.0,,"you cant go to singapore without stopping by at orchard road. this is shopping heaven.
all the high class brands are easily found and many big retail shops. easy to walk around on orchard to get from one road to the next. shoppers, come here to shop and even better shop during sale time! :) PS: electronics are always cheaper in singapore."
,,Shopping spree's heaven,5.0,,"Wide pavements for easy strolling along the road. Lots of plazas and malls give tons of shopping options. Easy access by public tranports (MRT or taxi). However, the humidity is something that is quite unbearable to stroll this long shopping road."
,,Lots of Shopping at High End Stores,4.0,,"A great place to visit just for the sights of lights (especially at Christmas and New Year's), great architecture, and people watching. Of course, the prices in the shops and restaurants match the high-end scale, but it's a fun place to visit and stroll around."
,,Busy and overwhelming,3.0,,All the malls and the crowds would fill your senses! So many choices and too little time to go through each and every one of the shops. I find it impressive how Orchard Road keeps on refreshing itself.

,,Good Variety,4.0,,Lots of variety and shops. Neat and well organised with wide walkways. Tend to get crowded on weekends though...
,,Crazy!,5.0,,On a hot day the Malls invite you in as they blast out the cold air! This is a road for serious shoppers but unlike other citys it is safe from pick pockets and theives. Enjoy the experience; it is crazy!
,,If you like to shop...,4.0,,"This is your place. Pretty much any store you can think of to spend your paycheck. Since I can go to chain stores anywhere in the world, I stuck with the local shops in Lucky Plaza and the massive Takashimaya dept store I hadn't seen before. This was the best place I found in town for gifts."
,,Shops from every major city :),3.0,,This is shopping in the homogenized style of every major city. Go below to Ion for Hawker food -- not so ordinary.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"You've never been to Singapore if you haven't visit Orchard Road (or shopping in one of the stores). This is the heaven for shopaholic, from branded to high fashion. I think we can say that this is Singapore's answer to Oxford Road."
,,Amazing display for Chinese New year,4.0,,"The place is brilliantly lit up and full of festivity. What I didnt like was that for Chinese New Year everything is closed for 2 days !!!! After 2 days ...there were Post Chinese New Year sales which were from 20 to 70% !!!
Dont forget to go to Bugis street ...there were markets which sold all traditional sweets, wall hangings, charms ...the dragons were in huge displays, your horoscopes and blessings for the year mpost prominant and Chinatown had an amazing festive atmosphere. There were live performers at corners and even if you did not know the language ... it was great to view the acts !!"
,,Good for shopping,3.0,,"I would have rated this a bit higher if there was an option between average and very good. Orchard is a great place to go shopping, but it gets very crowded and I didn't find much else to do (other than shopping)."
,,Hustle and Bustle and Expensive Shops,3.0,,"I suppose going down Orchard Road is a must when you visit Singapore but it is a long long street full of shopping malls, many of them full of very expensive shops. There is no way you can see all of them in a day. Singapore is very expensive so you dont even get any bargains."
,,Expensive Shops found anywhere in World,3.0,,A very long road comprising of one mall after another. Nothing outstanding just the usual designer stores.
,,Must see,4.0,,Well if you are in Singapore you must take a stroll up Orchard road. I lived here for 4 months and still found my self on this road time and again. You cant really go wrong with this many shopping centers located on one road.
,,shoppers paradise,4.0,,massive malls and retail shopping. i wonder how they can support so much retail space?
,,OK,4.0,,"Nice to browse shops, but lots of very 'high end' designer shops which do seem to be marginally more expensive than back in the UK. Good shopping malls"
,,prepare to spend,4.0,,makespend make sure you wear comfy walking shoes as this 13km stretch of shopping centers will test you. a must or shopaholics!
,,Luxury shopping,4.0,,"Orachard road is a place where you will get best of the brands from hotel it cost 20 Sing Dollars in a cab to reach about 10 minutes.

I feel best time of the year to go is during december when there is a sales season and the luxury goods and clothing can be picked up in a cheapest / afforadable rates."
,,Best Place for SHopping,5.0,,You will be spoiled for choice. Dont forget to visit the Ion Mall
,,Shopper's dream,4.0,,"But I am not much of a shopper....
We walked the entire length and did notice that the stores do repeat themselves, so no need to walk the entire length of the street. We walked from the botanic garden back to our hotel at marina bay. It was chinese new year day 2, so many stores were closed. Still a lot of people out and about, though.

Lots of coffee shops along the boulevard for a little refreshment.

I was sorry that the Ngee Ann shoping center was closed, as that was noted in our guide book. There was a big event outside featuring a large jade buddha.

We did make it into the ION center for some lunch - chose to go to a little fast food indian place.

Overall, must see to get a sense of how Singapore is so important in the region for shopping. Just that shopping isn't my bag."
,,Great at Christmas!,5.0,,"Plenty of posh and reasonable (Like M & S) stores - you can shop till you drop here! It's not a ""market style"" street - at least the main stree isn't"
,,Full of action life restaurants and shops for bargains,5.0,,Lucky Plaza for shops that seem to sell everything Get a suit made in a couple of days there !
,,Christmas Magic,4.0,,"Best Christmas lights and decorations EVER! Fun to walk around, see all the famous brands, enjoy an ice-cream and window shop."
,,outside the hotel,4.0,,but watch out for the ladies of the night which is quite near the hotel
,,Best shopping street in the world!!,5.0,,"Hands down Orchard road is the best shopping street in the world !! ( For me at least). From designer to the not so designer, you definitely can find it here... Be prepared to shop till you drop!!"
,,"The Same Old, The Same Old",2.0,,"There isn't a need to walk the entire stretch of Orchard Road to do a thorough shop as the shops and the merchandize they sell is repeated throughout different stretches of this strip. The upside is that you can spend a little time in a small section of this strip and devote the rest of your holiday to other attractions in the city.

,,Way too busy,3.0,,"If you like to shop, this is definitely your street, but I found it way too busy to enjoy myself. Also, if you're over 5'8 (which I am), good luck finding any clothes that fit you!"
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,Every you want or see you can find on Orchard Road. Walk along the road up and down try to visit every mall and you will be very tired ......... Take a a few days
,,Always a pleasure,5.0,,So much to explore and always so little time. This time I managed to explore ION- very interesting and great shopping. You can always plan to go to many shops along Orchard but the reality is- you get stuck in one area because there is so much to see and do and time escapes! I didn't make it far up the road this time! Oh well maybe next!
,,SHOP SHOP TILL U DROP,5.0,,Gr8 shopping district- though if you are a non smoker advise you to walk closer to the stores even as a line of smoker puff their way away on the road sides.....Saturday and Sunday evenings are crazy...the crowd is unbelievable
,,Not for us,3.0,,"This road is very popular for shoppers so we weren't overanxious to see it.

Some of the buildings are very impressive and we took a few photos of them. This was the highlight of visiting Orchard Rd.

I guess you just have to be a shopoholic to love this area."
,,All your shopping comforts ...,4.0,,The place to go if you want to buy things in Singapore. However do note that you have to move from shopping center to shopping center and shops tend to repeat.
,,Good for shopping,4.0,,"If you need shopping, this is right place for it. My shopping was perfect."
,,"So many shops, so little time....",5.0,,This is shopping centre world. There is a number of shopping centres which cater for all different price range and age. ION and Paragon are too high end centres and I like them. Don't be fooled though - Singapore may be shopping heaven ....as long as you have alot of money - its more expensive than Australia and Hong Kong for branded goods
,,hustle & bustle,5.0,,"orchard road is a place that you shouldn't miss during your visit. that's almost the only hustle & bustle road in s'pore before marina bay. various choice of restaurants, coffe shops, shopping centres."
,,excellent place to shop and have fun!,5.0,,"The variety of shop and products offered is amazing. And all in one place. I was there during new year sale, so enjoyed twice more."
,,shopper's paradise,4.0,,shops and shops and more shops. There is hardly a brand that you can't find in this world class shopping belt.
,,Shoppers Heaven,5.0,,Maze of Millions of shops in all price brackets you can never visit them all in 2 weeks
,,Best Shopping,5.0,,"From designer wear to excess factory production, its all there just got to know where to look. Put on comfy shoes as you will spend the entire day if not a couple."
,,Shopping on Orchard Road,5.0,,"Wow! You can get everything you want (and more!) on Orchard Road -- from budget kitchen ware to well-known luxury brands. All at resonable prices. Also, it was decorated to the ""nines"" for Christmas."
,,good place for shopping,4.0,,you get moost of the branded products at one street
,,This has to be one of the world's best shopping locations,5.0,,"The shops, malls, restaurants are all geared to induce one to part with one's money and enjoy the experience. In one or two short miles, one can find absolutely everything from the best of Haute Couture and top labels to markets, bazaars in places like Takashimaya, Isetan, Wisma, Tangs, Lucky Plaza, Paragon and many others at all ends of the scale. One also need never go hungry while shopping here as there are food courts in every centre, in every direction, satisfying food needs from many different countries!"
,,Make sure you visit even if just for an hour,4.0,,"This is a great place, but be warned, it gets busy and hot. It's basically just a street full of shopping malls and very expensive shops. The prices for the designer stuff are higher than London, sometimes by a great margin so be warned. There are also no public lavatories (or if there are we couldn't find them). If you go to Singapore you have to go and see this area without doubt though."
,,Just a Bunch of Malls,2.0,,"Orchard Road might once have been a shopping beacon in the South-East Asian wilderness but now that every city with more than a couple of buffalo to its name has some sort of mall, its novelty value has been greatly reduced. There are lots of shops, some fairly uninspiring eateries and lots of concrete and class. Tourists looking for some local color, should avoid this street and head to Little India or even Chinatown."
,,a busy place to shop or catch a movie,4.0,,"The best place in Singapore to shop, but you'll find the glitz is equal to the price."
,,"expensive shops,restaurants",4.0,,"it was quite nicely decorated during our Christmas trip. Each city can boast of a luxury main avenue that host expensive shops,restaurants. Singaporean Champs Elysee."
,,The shopping paradise,5.0,,Just go for shopping and celebration during festivals!
,,December Lights Awesome!,5.0,,Good shopping malls. Lit up during December. spent hours here! Enjoyed every moment
,,Good shopping if you're rich,4.0,,"Orchard Road is the main shopping precinct in Singapore although many of the shopping centres (especially the newer ones) tend to cater for the rich - so if you're not rich, you'll be spending most of your time doing window shopping."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Beautiful Christmas decorations and lots of things to see.
,,Nothing unique,3.0,,"Nothing unique here aside from the fact that malls are SO much a part of Singapore's culture. Go in any of the malls, especially the nicer, newer ones on a Friday evening and they will be simply packed with locals strolling about, window shopping and grabbing a meal.

There are numerous restaurants sprinkled throughout the malls and each mall also has a food court, usually in the basement, as well. In my opinion, the Ion Orchard has the best food options, especially Itacho Sushi on level B2. The food court in the basement also has tons of options.

As far as the shopping goes, if you are from the US you will encounter all the same shops you'd see on Fifth Avenue or the Miracle Mile or Rodeo Drive and you probably won't find any particularly good deals.

The street is decorated lavishly with tons of lights during November and December. That is worth seeing if you are in town at that time."
,,It would probably be great if you had a million dollars.,3.0,,"I know it's supposed to be the best shopping in Singapore, but the shopping was all very expensive clothes! I'm not the type of person who is happy to spend $200 on a dress that I would just wear around the house. I did manage to find Forever21 in the underground shopping centre but got terribly lost for half an hour.

Underground food court had FANTASTIC food but it was very crowded and hard to find a seat. A lot of the food places either sell food or drink. Not both. So you I had to line up twice.

There was also a building along Orchard Road notorious for female sex workers."
,,A shoppers paradise,5.0,,"Lots of different shops, high end designers right through to tat. It is a very long street though, so perhaps do it over a couple of days like we did, or hire a cab. You do see more on foot though, but many of the shops do have more than one branch on the road"
,,Shopping Paradise,4.0,,"must go place for shopping at Ion and Istan Takashimaya is great, You should all buy Singapore map toto bag."
,,Shopping eaven or hell!,3.0,,"If you like shopping it's amazing. I don't, but I was pleased to have walked along the length of this temple to materialism."
,,Large shopping street,3.0,,"To sound a bit jaded, I didn't find anything all that unique here in terms of the shopping experience. The amount and size of the malls is a bit overwhelming. One note, skip the high price restaurants and head to any one of the mall food courts for cheap eats."
,,"Shopping, shopping shopping!",4.0,,My wife thought she had died and gone to shopping heaven!
,,Rated the best shopping experience in the world in 2012!,5.0,,"People are helpful, you can hop around from one store to the next, one mall to the next. lots of places to chill out or have a meal and relax in the air con. wear comfortable shoes."
,,Vibrant!,5.0,,"Very vibrant area, very alive even at night time! good shopping malls, resto and everything!! I love this area"
,,Shopping Centers,3.0,,Just for shopping but things too expensive. Suitable for window shopping and hangout.
,,Great place for shopping,5.0,,"Obviously since there are so many shopping malls. The only thing i can complain about it is that I couldn't go to every mall there...Too many choices, from budget shops to designer stores. You should google where to buy what before you go unless you just want to look around."
,,Shoppers delight,5.0,,This is a great spot for shopping. If you cant get what you want here I dont know where you could!!
,,Great district for shopping goers...,4.0,,It's a shopping heaven... Just lack of seating area outside the shopping mall... You really need a break when you walking too much during shopping.
,,Best shopping ever!,5.0,,"Nine of us travelling together found everything we wanted - plus more we hadn't realised we wanted!! - in Orchard Road. Prices were excellent and more choices than we'd ever have at home. Service was outstanding and as everywhere is air conditioned, warm weather is not an issue."
,,Shoppers Delight,5.0,,Take plenty of cash and enjoy the shopping centres... great choices... yet amazed that the fashions are still very european influenced with plenty of winter wear available... temperature in Singapore in Jan 30 degrees !
,,Shops,5.0,,This is the place to go if you want to shop until you drop! As they say!!
,,nice to visit but overrated,3.0,,"mostly very expensive, brands, brands, brands, not my style"
,,Wonderful Christmas Decorations,5.0,,"The Christmas Decorations were very nice to look at. However as we went on Christmas Eve, the streets were packed with people and could not catch any taxis."
,,Just bring money...,4.0,,"Shop, Shop, Shop... that's all about it here... so help our economy along with your purchases! It's great retail therapy for all!"
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,This is the most beautiful group of shopping malls anywhere. Everything that you would find in an American or European mall can be found on Orchard Road - but who wants to go to a mall when you are in one of the beautiful cities in the world?
,,"""Core"" Singapore",4.0,,"If you are a shopper, or even a browser, this road is the place to take in singapore shopping."
,,Shopping for brands,3.0,,This is the place to go if you have little time in the city and intending to get international brand items. Not the best place if you want to check out the local purchases. No difference from the Oxford St of London.
,,Most comfortable in the world..,4.0,,"Having been to great shopping streets around the world, I have to say Orchard provides the balance between comfort (thermal and the pedestrian experience), variety (from LV to local brands), and average hospitality (if you look wealthy, they'll serve you well)."
,,Fantastic shopping,5.0,,Quite a distance to walk but worth it. The Christmas decorations were fabulous. We used the hop on hop off tour as a methos of transportation and this certainly helped. Ion is a great shopping experience.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,My favourite with all the big name brands as well as little names. Wonderful shopping centres and the ambience is just fantastic.
,,Shop shop and shop,4.0,,Great place to shop for all the luxury brands. Ion orchard is a good mall. Takashimaya has one of the largest bookshops i have ever come across. You can spend atleast 2-3 days and still not get bored of the different kind of shops that are there on this one stretch of road.
,,Shopaholics Beware!,4.0,,"Shopping till you drop. Mall after mall after mall, but really something to see. Especially when the road is closed and you can sit at the sidewalk cafes."
,,Past its prime,3.0,,"Don't rate the shopping - prices are cheaper in other countries and staff aren't particularly helpful. A stroll to look at the modern architecture of the malls and shophouses at Emerald Hill does kill an hour or so, plus there are cinemas where you can see blockbusters very cheaply and escape the (likely) rain."
,,Worth walking around,4.0,,"In comparison to other shopping places in the world, I would rate this 4/5 - too much construction going on which spoils the actual route. The actual buildings of the shopping malls look great, however coming from a person that shops, expect 'asian fashion', sure there is a H&M store and Zara store, but there are those stores everywhere in the world. Street fashion and local fashion was very limited."
,,Fun,5.0,,"If you need a place to empty your pockets this is the place to go. Wow we were shocked at how expensive everything was but had huge fun window shopping. Orchard road consists of all the Who is most definitely Who in fashion name brands, odd malls set up here and there amongst some rather trashy neighbours where you can by anything to help with your sex life. It was a fascinating experience for us but back home I can buy some things much cheaper so preferred to keep my wallet in my pocket. The whole district does have a lovely vibe though and walking the street and stopping for a coffee to watch the passing traffic is fun, ducking into the odd mall to refresh in the aircon air is necessary too."
,,Singapore Shopping,4.0,,"Great shopping experience.
Here you can really ""shop till you drop"".
Plenty of lights, of people, of shops.
Mega shopping center, floors and floors of all sort of food, clothes, electronics, shoes, chocolate, ice creams, famous brands and whatever.......That you cannot imagine.
Super offers, sales and much, much more.
Everything more marked, beeing around the Christmas time."
,,The best entertainment in Singapore,5.0,,"Looking for versatile entertainment, than head to Orchard Road. From branded shops, eating outlets, many bars and restaurants, Orchard Road is the place to be.

It offers a haven for shoppers, nightclubs and bars for adventourous and just a chill out zone watching people go by. Whatever your fancy, Orchard Road has it all."
,,Excellent shopping,4.0,,Loved the many branded choices available. Did not love the massive cab / traffic wait behind Takashimaya ... very slow moving at around 4pm. We had to wait for 30 minutes in the line to get a cab.
,,Good shopping,5.0,,Can get busy at the weekend but shopping is good - indoor shopping centres which make life easy.
,,Fantastic Near Christmastime,5.0,,"We went last December, mid-December in fact. The lights were amazing, and there were just so many things to see! Their malls were also top-notch. This is a MUST if you are in Singapore. Get ready to spend!"
,,Over shopping,3.0,,Too many shopping malls with the same labels in every single one of them. I did like some of the food courts and I thought Tang's was the best department store
,,Great shopping,4.0,,"We were visiting in November and they had set up the Christmas lights. Was a great experience to go and visit at night, although crowded, we still enjoyed it. There are such a wide selection of shopping options, my suggestion is to stay for about a week and shop in the mornings (from 10am when most open), spend the afternoon around your hotel pool and then go back again in the evening for a few hours more shopping before going somewhere nice for dinner."
,,Great shopping in Singapore,5.0,,A must do when travelling to Singapore. Be prepared to spend some $$$ If you can't find it in Orchard Road I'd be surprised.
,,Shopping overload,4.0,,"Orchard Road is amazing! Perhaps too good.....we were overwhelmed by the number of shops and malls, the size of the buildings and their amazing entrances, and very creative temples to shopping. It was a great place to window shop as there were many, many exclusive label shops which are way beyond a normal budget. Ended up coming away emply handed by glad of the experience!"
,,Plan your shopping,5.0,,"I scored a great pair of new glasses. the variety is considerably more extensive than NZ. great mixture of high end brands and more homely stalls. The malls have become so extensive that you need to plan ahead where you are going to go, or you'll end up wandering aimlessly around. Always try on clothes as the sizing is quite small"
,,Christmas Lights Spectacular,4.0,,"Loved the Christmas lights in Orchard Rd. but also surrounding areas with displays, Singapore really makes an effort for this festive time of year."
,,Shop til you drop,3.0,,If you like shopping this is the place for you ! Miles and miles of shopping centers with obligatory food courts! Very crowded thoroughfare.
,,Christmas lights,5.0,,"A great place to promenande in the evening, Christmas lights were spectacular and Tangs window displays briliant"
,,for very big spenders,5.0,,"Orchard road is a very classy plece where you can find all the superchic international brabds (Prada, Gucci, Rolex etc...) be prepared to spend a lot of money if you want to bring something back home. Very good jewelleries like Taka for diamonds."
,,Great shopping,4.0,,Many shops with everything you could want. Very busy so be prepared to fight the crowds. Great eating places up and down the road.
,,Orchard Rd Singapore... like a maze,5.0,,"SO huge. You go into one department store, then you go underneath the underpass and you so happen to manage to go into another store, and another, and another.... I used to get lost all the time, and as just as i thought i was on the right track i would find another store to shop!

Designer clothing from overseas was heavily discounted. Need to try on though. No pushy salespersons. Shoes were amazing - Charles & Keith WOW! The basements are great as they normally have huge supermarkets there as well. Carrefour etc. Also they do heaps of demonstrations for food, so if you are in the right place you can sample what they make. We tried pandan cake and mango cake, delish!

I suggest water, and comfy shoes. And be prepared for entering in and out of a/c all day. A must to do and try the icecream on the side of the road - $1SGD (still the same price as in 2007)!"
,,HIGH END FASHION STREET,4.0,,"What can you say about Orchard Road that you can't say about the main shopping street of any city in the world? Lots of VERY expensive high end fashion stores and lots of things that can be bought anywhere. It is impossible to wander around Orchard Road the way you could thirty years ago because of the traffic barriers etc. The Christmas decorations were great, but shops are shops!!!"
,,ION is big,4.0,,Had a brief walk on this road. Too many malls. I only stop by at Ion and got loss as it's very big and many shops in there. 3 level down under the road (in the basement). Guess you need two days to complete shopping in that building.
,,orchard road,5.0,,"really the only place to shop, eat and just hang out in singapore."
,,It is a road full of life and a shoppers haven.,4.0,,The shopping is about the best in the world. Did not like the humidity.
,,If you love designer labels,4.0,,"Shop till you drop, the Singaporeans are spoiled for choice. From electronics to make up to good reading."
,,Great hub for activity and entertainment!,5.0,,Great shopping and great food! The best malls and so many different places to dine.
,,shopping ok,3.0,,"We were hoping to buy electronic equipment. Sony tablet, ipod etc. We found the prices to be the same if not dearer than in Melbourne or online. Some clothing items were cheaper. Just have to look. The xmas decorations were excellent."
,,Shopping shopping & more shopping,5.0,,Love all department stores in Orchard Road especially basements at Tang and Takashimaya - great bargains to be had.
,,shop till you drop,5.0,,"stores of all types , high rise and under ground . could easily get lost as you can walk above and below ground across the road without realising it. well worth an afternoon."
,,Love the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road,5.0,,Orchard road is just a shoppers paradise with so many shops to choose from with some excellent choice Love Tangs and staff just so helpful. definately recomend
,,I never saw so much shops together,4.0,,This the place for shopping addicts. Even the oldest shopping centre is modern compared to European shopping centers.
,,A shoppers delight,5.0,,"Every shop hungry person must go to Orchard Road, great bargins to be had here."
,,Very expensive and Very busy...,3.0,,"This is where all the individuals go to look like they are shopping and not buy anything. It is the place to be seen. The stores for the most part are WAY overpriced or elite brands (Vutton, Rolex, etc.). However, I would definately recommend experiencing it or if you were lucky like me stay at the hotel near it."
,,top shops,5.0,,the place where all the big names meet great looking street leading up to xmas well decorated out
,,Love the shopping but oh so overwhelming!,5.0,,Too many shops for me to manage! A shoppaholics dream!
,,"Shopping, food and hotels",4.0,,"This street is one of the major shopping street in Singapore, you can find malls and stores, connecting to Scotts Road with further shopping..."
,,Orchard Road the best avenue in the world,5.0,,"We enjoyed one week stay Christmas and new year 2011, I can't wait to return again. All famous brands have amazing shjops specially Vuitton, Cartier and Dior. Don' miss Ion Orchard and Tangs. Specially the elephant parade by Tangs was spectacular. Thans to Singapore Tourism Authorities for this brilliant Christmas"
,,really wide range of perfect boutiques,4.0,,really wide range of perfect boutiques. You will be able to find anything you like. But shops of that streets ar really overcrouded
,,Christmas lights - spectacular,5.0,,Definately recomend a visit to Singapore in November or December to experience the Christmas lights and decorations - amazing.
,,Tangs & elephants on parade,3.0,,liked the elephants on parade and purchased a collectors elephant for $109. disliked the crowds.
,,Shop til you drop,4.0,,Very crowded the week before xmas. A little better than the aussie dollar. Lots of food and drink stops needed. Wear comfortable shoes!
,,christmas lights,5.0,,"Try and get to Orchard Road once in your life time to see the Christmas lights, you will not be disapointed. The shopping is of coarse excellent."
,,Tourist Road,3.0,,Very much for tourists. There are only so many times that one can do the same thing-which is shop til you drop.
,,Must come if visiting Singapore,5.0,,"Just go to orchard road and start walking. You'll be amazed by the beauty of the concrete jungle. Just be carefull with the peak hours, might get a bit crazy and hard to get a cab."
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,"As mentioned earlier by all...if you want to shop you have to be here , all kind of shops, malls, restaurant are present on this road. Will suggest going in the afternoon if you want to beat the crowd and catch the best deals ."
,,Singapore blooms,4.0,,The lights are Orchard room was great this year. Well done for the creativity.
,,ENDLESS shops and malls....need weeks to see it all!,4.0,,"We were simply amazed and the sheer quantity of shops along Orchard Rd. Some of the malls had chain stores (Top Shop, Zara etc), and some were independent department stores (Robertson? I think....).
Some were clearly expensive with ""high end"" stores (Cartier etc) but these were pretty obvious from the outside and you could simply choose to avoid them or go in for curiosity (out of our price range!)

THere are lots of places to eat at including local foods and international chains (KFC, McDonalds etc).

For Australians, the prices for clothes are ok but not great. We were going to London the week later and when we did the exchange rate comparisons (which you could do on price tags in Zara and Top Shop and H&M), it was cheaper in London.

Tip: Top Shop has free wi-fi if you need to check emails etc while out."
,,Shopping madness,2.0,,"Prices gouging to the extreme, crowded, hot and not worth the effort. I reside in Singapore and have to negotiate the madness on a daily basis. That said, it is worth visiting once for a few hours if you are visiting Singapore but save your money to spend in Thailand or Vietnam."
,,An entire road lined with shoping malls!,4.0,,"Loved the fact that I could easily choose and compare prices. Hated that it was extremely crowded, I blame it on the season though since I went on Christmas day!"
,,Wow too much to do in one day,4.0,,You need at least 2 days to cover the shops and centers. Very busy though. Head off the main street o fg your taxi
,,"Skip it, better shopping in CBD",1.0,,We went there after visiting the malls in the CBD. The malls on Orchard Rd are older and less impressive with the same stores and same food. Feel free to skip.
,,It's like a street long shopping mall covered with christmas lights,5.0,,"I went to Orchard Rd at the time when they were decorating the street for Christmas, and I have to say, it's amazing! The lights, decorations, the street is lit up so brightly it's almost daytime."
,,Amazing experience for a first time visitor to Singapore.,4.0,,"Wonderfull shops and food outlets for all tastes, albeit very humid on the street the shopping centers are airconitioned and it brings great relief."
,,If you are rich go here,2.0,,Another really sad story of how countries such as Singapore take care of their rich. The vast gap between rich and poor is incredibly evident by the massively high end shopping district called Orchard Road. The large majority of Singapore residents can't shop here.
,,Where it all happens,5.0,,"Gliterring Shops all around and the road too nicely decorated & lit for X-mas. From Big Departmental stores to road side shops - all very attractive. Great place for tourist, business persons and for locals too."
,,Wear WALKING SHOES!,5.0,,"fantastic strip of shops from boutique exclusive branded shops to department stores especially robinsons! The Christmas lights were stunning and won't forget this in a hurry.lplentyof western cafes around to have lunch, toilets in dep stores. However, it was very very crowded!! Got tired easily in dodging people, so wear comfortable shoes."
,,Shopping area.,4.0,,"A shopping area as any other in any place in the world, but with the VAT reduced you could find some bargains..."
,,Shop til your knees buckle!,4.0,,"Good shopping! But there's also a buliding that's called the Orchard Towers which the notorious ""Four Floors of Wh***s"" are located..... *wink*"
,,che bel manicomio,4.0,,"E' la famosa strada dello shopping di singapore con gli addobbi natalizi, ma tanto non riesce a rendere l'atmosfera del natale. Comunque in breve consiglio Plaza Singapura per lo shopping medio e tanto food, paragon piu in fondo con l'ottimo sushi seti al 5 piano molto affollato e molto buono con prezzi moderati. Infine Ion orchard mentre cercherete di passare da una strada all'altra con il sottopassaggio non riuscirete piu ad uscire, un vero labirinto di negozi e food di ogni genere!! Pero passarci troppo tempo stanca contutto quello che c'e' da vedere basta dedicargli solo un pomeriggio."
,,A Shopping Haven,5.0,,"I tried to go to Singapore whenever I can. Loved the shopping there, wonderful shopping complexes and beautiful designer bags"
,,Christmas lights,3.0,,"We went Christmas night, lights spectacular, but ooooooooh sooooooooo crowded had to fight our way through, but a must see!"
,,Bit of a let down,3.0,,Found orchard road to be a boring trudge along a busy road going from one building to another and never getting the feeling that I was in shopping area. Whole thing seemed disjointed and I just ended up bored.
,,Overdone,3.0,,"Like any main street in a major capital, it's packed with luxury stores that don't differ from back home save that you can haggle. Ugly red light district ahead."
,,Packed during christmas,4.0,,"We decided to hit Orchard Road on Christmas Eve and it looked beautiful with all the decorations but it seemed all of Singapore was there! Could barely walk, youngsters were spraying ""snow"" over everyone, and it was impossible to get a taxi or reach the metro station. I would recommend going there before or after the holiday!"
,,Wow!,5.0,,Shopping in Singapore is surpassed only by shopping in Tokyo! This was just amazing: decorated for the holidays and it's great to see high end shopping mixed with mid- and lower-end shopping. The shops were all gorgeous and nicely turned out. People are quite accommodating as well.
,,Singapore's Oxford Street,4.0,,"All the shops, cafe's and restaurants that you would expect from a major shopping district. The post office is also here."
,,shop til you drop..,5.0,,if you're into shopping areas..then this is where you should be you..walk along orchard road and you'll find diff malls everywhere..left and right...
,,Great Experience,4.0,,"Orchard Rd is truly amazing to visit...roads and roads of multi-storey shopping malls. The interiors are beautifully designed and immaculately maintained. However, unless you have a lot (and I mean a lot) of money to spend it's just an excursion. The stores are very expensive and in the words of Donkey at the Universal Studios Shrek Show ""Singapore, ridiculously expensive!""
A great experience but not a place to do a lot of shopping"
,,A Shopping Extravaganza,5.0,,"Almost the best shopping street in the world. Be careful not to be caught by some of the dodgy camera shops and if you really want an eye opener, go to Orchard Towers at night"
,,"Vibrating place, day or night",5.0,,"World class street, Fantastic selection of shops offering all price ranges in many catagories of goods. Clean and tidy. Absolutely safe to walk and shop in Orchard Street and it is decently and beautifully decorated at Christmas. A MUST on Christmas Eve. Super atmosphere during the day and wonderful to meet so many friendly Singaporeans in the evening."
,,Nice place for shopping with something for everyone,4.0,,"This famous shopping district definitely has something for everyone - from the high-end products at ION Orchard to cheap deals for teenagers at Far East Plaza.

Nice place to dine would be the foodcourts such as those at 313 Somerset, or at Ngee Ann City's basement. Of course, expect a huge crowd everywhere you go at Orchard Rd. For those who want to dine at restaurants but are on a budget, you may choose to go to Wild Honey somewhere near 313@Somerset, or Chinese cuisine at Crystal Jade Kitchen/Palace at Ngee Ann City proves good too.

A good time to visit would of course be during the Christmas season when the entire street is lighted up with all the Christmas Decorations."
,,Christmas light,4.0,,very good in Chirstmas time for people who love colorful light along the road and lots of shopping malls
,,Shopping!,4.0,,"Must visit for tourists - Singapore's favorite pastime. Even if you are not a shopoholic, it's nice just to stroll down the street, wander into some shops and check out the array of merchandise...or get some free chilling down from the hot sun."
,,Shopping Area,4.0,,is a good area for shopping....have a lot of shopping centre and transportation is convenience
,,Christmas decorations,4.0,,"Went here just for the Christmas decorations, which was great! Walked from Orchard MRT to Somerset MRT, and there are a lot of shopping malls along the way. Definitely come here for your retail therapy."
,,If you don't like people and auto traffic jams avoid during the festive season,3.0,,"Orchard Road during the festive season was nuts. You will find that you can't just cross the road in many places - you are forced to go through an Underpass - most of the time that means getting lost in the labyrinth of shops. The Underpass from Takashimaya to Ion is so popular that during Christmas the walkway is cheek to cheek with people moving at a snail's pace. Definitely not for the claustrophobic. BTW, Singapore prices aren't what they used to be.....electronics are not cheap here anymore."
,,Food courts,5.0,,"You should try the food courts at some of the shopping malls. Our favourite was 313. They have an amazing choice of cuisine, not to mention the prices are fantastic value for money. We made a trip to orchard road once just for the lunch! And yes there are more than enough shops to satisfy any shopping hunger and more!!"
,,It doesn't get better,5.0,,Be sure to bring an extra suitcase--shopping really doesn't get any better. It's a great opportunity to buy fashions that you can't find in the states.
,,"Shopping, dining",5.0,,"What's not to love about Orchard Road? Miles of great shopping (some might be on the pricey side), electic food establishments abound, people watching, theatres and more!"
,,Obviously touristy,3.0,,"Very intense experience. As people who do not shop for sport, we were not match fit and so found it unrewarding. Christmas lights were not the 'wow' experience we were built up for, although pleasant enough."
,,Shopping is the same worldwide,4.0,,"Actually it's rather sad that it doesn't matter whether you're in Zurich or Singapore. Upscale boutiques of all the familar brands seem to be everywhere. Singapore, like Hong Kong, is a shopper's paradise. Still, it's tough to understand why anyone would waste time shopping while in a place as lovely as Singapore."
,,Plenty of good shopping and restaurants,4.0,,"Take a walk down this shopping street. Many stores, shopping centers and restaurants and 3 subway stations along the way."
,,shop shop eat,3.0,,"A lot shopping and food- very convenient as you can access from the Orchard Road MRT or even the Somerset MRT. Love the food court in Lucky plaza, many Philippines and other exotic cuisine offered there."
,,Shppers Paradise!,5.0,,A must see and visit place for visitors to Singapore.
,,X-mas is here,5.0,,Ever wondered where all the x-mas decortions have gone? Head to Orchard Rd and enjoy classic over the top decorations. No bargins as it used to be but still great to see a plac ht put in that extra pesazz to get the X-mas feeling.
,,It's Singapore Culture!,5.0,,"Apart from the many many malls that keep springing up, there is nothing you won't find! Plus the best icecream in the world. It's convenient,clean and althought teaming with people, exciting rather than congested. Also the architecture of buildings beggars belief each building more exciting and eye-popping than the next. Christmas is a great time to go as the Christmas lights are over the top, yet tasteful at the same time, with shopping malls officially competing for best Christmas decoration each year!"
,,Shoppers paradise - if thats what you like,2.0,,"A large street full of clean modern shops selling everything you could want - could be anywhere in the world. Worth a look, but certainly a little soulless."
,,Good shopping District,4.0,,"I can understand some of the comments regarding the lack of soul with regards to Orchard Road. It is very much a row of malls, ideal for those who love shopping.

But it doesn't try to be anything else. Its main purpose is to cater to the big chains and offer some fantastic malls and huge selection of brands, all in one place. In that sense it's fantastic at what it offers."
,,Shopping....,5.0,,....was fabulous with so many places to eat too at very reasonable prices
,,Shopping Heaven!,4.0,,"If you want shopping on another scale you must visit orchard road. Everyhting from budget to bvlgari. Even if your not shopping I would recommend a walk along this road, coffee and people watching."
,,Busy busy busy,5.0,,"Lots of shops, top names and brands - a must if you are in Singapore"
,,Orchard Road doesn't change,4.0,,"Regardless how much street improvement and infrastrcuture they build, Singapore's Orchard Rd remains the same. One the one side the big, expensive shopping centres, on the other Lucky plaza. Tang's has an amazing Elephant Survival/Protection campaign on right now. Visit Level 4 and buy one - it is for good Conservationist reasons."
,,Definitely a site to take in at least once in your life!,4.0,,"If you are in need of high end retail therapy, Orchard Road is the answer to what ails you. Every high end merchant is there to meet your needs. As I am not much of a shopper, the experience was a little daunting with wall-to-wall shoppers strolling and taking pictures of the sights. I enjoyed the fact that I could peel off at any point in time to move into one of the many shopping mall buildings. Very happy to have seen the special Christmas decorations which dressed up this historic shopping venue."
,,Good shopping experience,4.0,,"Enjoyed Orchard Road. But had just come from Hong Kong; the shopping in Singapore looks a little sparse in comparison. Had I come from home, the perspective would have probably differed tremendously."
,,"Dull, homogenized, and overcrowded: no local color, and nothing worth seeing",2.0,,"Orchard Road isn't Singapore at all. This is the least authentic, least colorful place in the city, and it has no interesting sights for tourists. It's merely the standard, tiresome shopping street that every city has, with bland and overpriced chain stores. There's no interesting architecture, there are no cultural or historical sites, and it's an urban area with no natural beauty. It's just one homogenized mass of glossy malls and trendy clothing shops.

Tellingly, it's the only place in Singapore where prices are specifically marked as ""Singapore dollars"" (rather than simply ""dollars"" as everywhere else in the country), indicating the stores here choose to cater solely to foreigners, and specifically foreigners who are too ignorant to realize that OF COURSE the prices would be in local currency, presumably as opposed to U.S. dollars. If their customers have no interest in local color and can't be bothered to know what currency the country uses, perhaps they should stay home and buy their H&M flashery and Louis Vuitton trinkets online.

Orchard Road is too overcrowded even to be a pleasant walk because although I was there on a rainy day, it was still packed; mobs of tourists kept bumping into me as I tried to walk down the sidewalk. No Singaporeans, of course--just tourists. As a result, this is also the only place in Singapore where I found a tourist information kiosk; given its implication in this setting, however, that's hardly a positive.

I can't even pretend to understand people who travel all the way to Singapore then choose to spend their time shopping for Western goods in British and American chain stores. So instead I'll address my remarks to people I do understand, who (like me) travel to other countries to experience new horizons: their languages, cuisines, cultural and historic sites, and everyday idiosyncrasies. If you want to experience Singapore, then you should marvel at the Buddhist and Taoist temples; eat in a small restaurant in Little India, where you see no other tourists; walk through the rain forest in the Botanic Gardens; and stop into intriguing stores while walking down an ordinary street. Don't waste any of your valuable time at Orchard Road."
,,"Hectic, but plenty of shopping malls within one road",4.0,,"There are a lot of shopping malls, very nice experience. There are a lot of people shopping during my visit."
,,Best shopping placec,4.0,,"There alot of things to buy , some fake , some reals and , its ALWAYS crowded , many restaurant . advise you to go there to shop and get most of the branded stuffs"
,,"Shopping, shopping & more shopping",4.0,,"This is the ultimate shopping street. Every brand, product & designer are on this street. Singapore isn't the cheapest place to shop though"
,,Buzzing,4.0,,"Loved browsing the shops even if we didn't have any baggage allowance to buy anything! Mmmm mmmm, had ice cream at Cold Stone (???) Parlour - what an experience!"
,,Great Shopping Area...,4.0,,"Had a great time walking around the road with the beautiful christmas lights, wide roads for walking around without stepping on other people but after half an hour the shops do repeat itself with the same brands."
,,Christmas lights are amazing!,5.0,,"We visited at night and the xmas lights this year are just amazing.Walk up to Tangs,looks beautiful, and dont forget to take pictures of the elephants of Asia!"
,,Like London Oxford Street but ten times longer!!,5.0,,"A couple of days needed to be spent here, shop till you drop. Pop into many shopping malls and for everybody's price range."
,,Must visit,5.0,,"This is a must-visit attraction of Singapore, as it is where the best shopping is located. Recommended malls include the ION Orchard for something for everyone (both mid-range and upper-class brands), to the popular Takashimaya and two Isetan departmental stores, and even a large Food Republic in Wisma Atria. Not forgetting standalone stores such as Singapore's first H&M outlet as well as entertainment in Cathay and Shaw cineplexes (the latter also has an IMAX theater).

Of course, you'll have to make your way through large throngs of people, especially during the weekends and public holidays, which can be a bit overbearing for some!"
,,Good if You Don't Mind Paying Double,3.0,,"Orchard Road is an average to good shopping district. Although Orchard Road itself is long, the shopping malls surrounding it are actually small in size populated by big brands. For example, there are two huge Louis Vuitton along Orchard Road. It is expensive when it comes to small brands such as Guess, Coach, Adidas, but actually cheap compare to other Asian countries when it comes to big brands such as Louis Vuitton and Prada. We did enjoy going there but found the shopping centres at Marina Bay more affordable and customer service better. I would say that Orchard Road is overrated compared to other shopping districts in Asia such as Central and Paragon at Thailand or the Golden Triangle in Malaysia which I believe is one of the greatest and most value for money."
,,Great for shopping,5.0,,"Great for shopping but with all places that is great for shopping, to many people."
,,A Very Cool Shopping Area,5.0,,Populated by huge malls offering all the designer stuff (and even M&S had a presence). The ION centre has multiple floors carrying all sorts of product and contains the MRT to take you to Marina Bay etc (spotlessly clean and highly efficient). And jaw dropping Christmas illuminatiions (which run until end Jan)
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,Great choice of shopping and good restaurants - The Ion Centre - superb but VERY easy to get lost in.
,,shopping,4.0,,"Moost popular shopping boulevard in Singapore .The palce is well decorated for Christmas and its a pelasure to stroll down this road in the evenings.We enjoyed teh long walk from Pan Pacific to Orchard Road .Frankly ,i did not find great offers going for xmas ."
,,Bring a lot of money/credit cards if you intend to go shopping here,4.0,,"Our original plan was to just walk along the entire Orchard Road, see the facades of the high-end shops, and enter Ion Orchard and Takashimaya only. We had to go inside one or two more malls (the names of which I can't recall) though because the latter were linked to certain MRT stations. We didn't bring much money on our visit to Orchard Road, but we really wish we had because almost everything here was pricey. Nevertheless, we still enjoyed our short visit because of the air conditioners in full blast, clean and luxurious comfort rooms, and a lot of opportunities for luxury window shopping.

*You have to spend at least one day here if you plan to go an extensive shopping spree."
,,Always not enough time,5.0,,It always happen on every visit to Orchard road I will not enoigh time to enjoy the ambience especially during Christmas. The beautiful deco and lights worth a visit at night.
,,Orchard Road IS Singapore,4.0,,"If you don't like shopping... please move on. This is NOT the place for you. If you do like shopping (or just looking) imagine a road spanning three MRT stops that is just one luxury shopping mall after another! Orchard Road is shop till you drop central. Mostly everything is high end these days, but you can still find some bargains in Lucky Plaza. And Orchard Road is really NOT the place to eat in Singapore... the food centers are expensive and serve highly ""sanitized"" versions of local dishes. Best to shop there and go eat in Chinatown or Little India."
,,Christmas at Orchard Road - lively!,5.0,,"Orchard Road dressed up for Christmas and what a lovely sight! It was lively, energetic and yet peaceful enough so you could wander around and lose yourself among the shoppers/observers without being disturbed or noticed.
The buildings dressed up for Christmas and Tang's was so bright and colorful. There were street performances - ballet, acrobatics, magic shows; there were food stalls - ice creams, hot dogs, burgers, coffee and there was so much life! All in all, a late night stroll along orchard road is highly recommended at Christmas!"
,,Man Hell!,3.0,,"Date of visit: 17th December 2011
Think of a cross between Regent Street and New Bond Street. We went to show the kids the Christmas Lights. Whilst the lights were nice, they quickly became repetitive.
If you love shopping in malls and designer stores, you'll love Orchard Road.
For me, a waste of time."
,,Very nice,5.0,,"Its the Champs-Elysees of Paris, sans the beggars and the crows! Lots of street entertainers and beautiful, yet over-priced malls!"
,,XMAS lights at their very absolute best,5.0,,"Breath taking! That is the word I am looking for. The Christmas lights on Orchard Road seem to get better every year and this XMAS, 2011, they are simply outstanding. The blue and sliver hues shimmer all the way along Orchard Road and leave you mesmerized. I have travelled to Paris and Vienna and Prague and London and countless other cities over Christmas but Orchard Road in Singapore simply takes the cake! And all this in the middle of the tropics."
,,I love Orcahrd road,5.0,,"Its an extremely energetic atmosphere at ORcahrd Road. Not only the shopping cetres but everything surrounding. Youcant get bored for a second. Walking around the road, you will find serious people moving for their business places, olds and young for almost all nationalty walking for shopping. You will find tour guides, colorful buses, even the prostitues around Orchard Tower . This is a place you fell a global atmosphere , a lively paced life and energy to do maximum from your life. Do not compare it with Oxford Street London which have on elite class shopping arcade only"
,,High end courture with high end prices.,3.0,,"Orchard road is a shopping paradise as long as you have the money to pay for the designer goods on sale. Don't think that you can wander along and find a souvenir shop to buy as you memento of Singapore. Here you are faced with Gucci, Prada, LV to name but a few in one mall after the other and believe me Orchard Road is a very long road. If this is your first visit to Singapore then fine take a look and admire the very classy shops and the intriguing architecture of some of the malls (ION for example) but they are very crowded and not a backpacker in sight. For a nicer experience go to Vivo city( MRT Harbour Front). For us the Christmas decorations along the road were the highlight of our visit."
,,Disappointing Christmas Lights & Deco!,3.0,,"Don't expect too much, the Christmas lights and deco are so plain....it's no longer like the previous years. How sad!!"
,,Amazing Shopping Experience,5.0,,"Shopping on Orchard Road is an amazing experience, there is a great range of shops and something not to be missed."
,,"Short Trip but still ""Shop Till U Drop!"";)",4.0,,"We visited some shopping malls along Orchard Road. We think we are spoilt for choices here on Orchard Road. However, for the tourist who have little time and are wondering what should be on their checklist ike my cousins from USA(5 days). Here they are:

1.Ion Orchard-
where the Orchard MRT station is and the start of your shopping spree.;)
Must visit for those real deal clothingsand for cheap and good clothings, go to basement and look for Cache Cache. This is a French store and they carry many casual wears; T shirts, pants, dresses,etc. It is for ladies mostly so guys, sorry! ( Price from $10 to $70) Look out for Sale where you get more bargains. For those who love sports, there are many sports shops within this building. On the same level as Cache Cache, there is a food court where you can try different cuisines Price $2 to $8.

2. Takashimaya(flagship store)
From ION, just use the basement link and you will pass thru Wisma Atria(Isetan shopping store) and very quickly you get to Takashimaya( the building is known as Ngee Ann City)
For tourists, besides just massive shops, you must go to the basement food street. You see all types of cuisine in the making. A true eye opener for tourist; candy making, breads, yakitori, coffee, Japanese noodles, etc..It is like a museum on FOOD. You can spend a whole day in this one shopping mall. Dine and eat all day long;)

3. 313

Yes, this is also a shopping haven. Shops that have good deals include Nichii, Uniglo for winter wear, Esprit, Forever 21, etc. There are two places to eat; first the highest floor is the ""Heavenly"" food court where tourist can try different dishes. Prices are reasonable but a $1 or $2 higher than typical food court cos of the rental here. If you move to the basement, there is a food street where you get mainly fast food. There is a Malayan cafe. They serve Penang food. Some food items are good but some are not so good. Try the popiah, prawn noodle, ice kachang. Avoid Penang laksa and Kueh Pie Ti..shamefully poor standard ;(

The chinese gal who takes order is poor in service and forgetful. On two occasions she forget and key in wrong order but refuse to change the dish. For $4, she prefers to upset the customer.Clueless staff! Be forewarned!

4. Centerpoint Robinson-
Our favorite no doubt. Here at Robinsons, you get to shop for everyone.;) This is a one stop shopping paradise where value for money starts. Service is also good. Used to be better but with shortage of staff, service has been compromised.;(
Remember to visit the food street; Prima is great for SELECTED local food. Prices are reasonable from $4 to $12. At the basement, surprisngly, there is a Foodcourt. Not many knew this fodcourt cos it is fairly new. So tourists can also have a try at local cuisine here. The Fried Fish soup and rice is an all time favorite. At $4.50, you get fish, vegetables, tofu, soup, seaweed, rice, only all the healthy stuff! Must try.;)

For the time constraint tourists, these are the must visit 4 great shopping malls on Orchard Road. MRT stations are Orchard and Somerset stations. All major buses go through Orchard Road.

Happy Shopping and be safe!"
,,"Window shopping is the order of the day, and a nightime stroll is worthwhile though most shops close at 10pm.",4.0,,"My wife being an avid shopaholic spent an entire evening walking the entire length of Orchard road, luckily for me the Christmas lights were on and I could people watch. Drop into one of the Ice cream parlours for a real treat and take in the atmosphere. If you love shopping you will love Orchard Road day or night."
,,"Very pricey , very crowded, go if you are bored",3.0,,"Visited Dec 2011. If you are among the top 1% of wealthy people then this is the place to go.

You will find every exclusive brand in the world here at top dollar.

It's a hot , balmy walk up and down the road and the street is full of cars belching forth exhaust.

If you're bored then go. Otherwise there's too many other great places to shop."
,,Shopping fever,5.0,,Wow and wow again. So many great stores...great merchandise and great prices. And the foo courts simply divine.
,,What more do you need,5.0,,"All the way from stalls to boutiques. Clean, and honest."
,,The place to be for shopping and entertainment,5.0,,"The world famous orchard road now boasts of new shopping centers , huge hotels and entertainment spots. I particularly liked the Centerpoint shopping complex and the Lido complex, lots of shops with branded goods for sale. Was told that the best time would be yhe june and july period where there are sales all over . Lots of high qiality side walk cafes to choose from for a light meal."
,,Just another stretch of urban shopping,3.0,,You can find universal prices of goods in that area. Crowded with tourists that is why prices always remains up.
,,nice shopping street,4.0,,IF you like to go for one stop shopping street in singapore its Orchard. We travelled here about a couple of weeks back and it was decorated for Christmas and looked beautiful. there are lot of dining options on the street so you would never go hungry.
,,Ultimate destination for Shopping Lovers,5.0,,"This is the place if you are in Singapore for shopping. you get here almost all the best brands...there are amazing choice deepening on your pocket size. I had an amazing shopping experience here....loved it... This street has some great coffee & ice cream parlors... not much of choice for vegetarian food. I had to struggle... but if you are a shopaholic, then you will manage with the little choice that is available. I had a great time at the StarBucks in one of the mall.... You need at least 2 days to fully see the place. Evening is the best time to be there... i would definitely love to go to Orchard Street Again..."
,,Endless shopping,5.0,,"Shopping heaven for neigbour population. Most shoppers are from China, Indonesia, Japan, Phillipine, Malaysia. Paragon, Takashimaya and etc. Endless of branded boutiques. $$$$"
,,shopping overload,4.0,,"i am a seasoned shopper and i was overwhelmed by how many stores there are. so much so i saved my husband a lot of money. bought a few things, enjoyed the drive at night, everything lit up (assuming for the holidays). USD favorable, however if you can find it in the states, buy it there."
,,Great for shopping but beware of Lucky plaza,5.0,,You can shop everywhere except shopping for electronic items at lucky plaza. 90 percent of the shops are dishonest. I was cheated of a cell phone. the place is called DAB electronics .
,,to many people on the street and not clean anymore like 2 or 3 years ago.,3.0,,"the city was crowded with people, might the city government has to put some officer to watch people so they won't through garbage every where. The city wasn't clean."
,,Amazing shopping malls,4.0,,Lovely Christmas decorations and illuminations as we visited at night..very crowded with shopping lovers
,,SHOPPING,5.0,,ORCHARD ROAD offers you a wide variety of Fashion shops and shopping malls.
,,Shopper Heaven at alll price points,5.0,,"Shoppers paradise. Mot major cities around the world have a shopping hub, but I would suggest that in terms accessability, ability to shop in all weather conditions (lots of shops/ dept stores inter connected to subway) variety of price points and dining options, Orchard is right there amongst the better ones"
,,walk time,4.0,,"dont buy around, mostly branded stuff, but walk is worthed, window shoppin is worthed, some sleazy areas there too, but no problems of lawlessness, enjoyable place. from drinks, couisine to people, all are friendly,"
,,Shop 'till you drop,4.0,,"If you like shopping, you'll like Orchard Road. I don't and I didn't (but my wife did).

Lots of shops and restaurants - many of them overpriced. I was there in late Nov/early Dec so they have the Christmas lights on which were nice.

By the way - taxis are difficult to get, especially if it rains. Find a train station and get that instead,"
,,"Crazy Crowds, Great Shopping",4.0,,"Yes, it's NUTS, especially on a weekend, but it's everything to everyone in terms of shopping"
,,Shopping anyone?,4.0,,"In my travels, I've seen a lot, but nothing compares to the magnitude of Orchad Road's shopping. It's everywhere, we even got lost underground tring to get from one side to the other. What a pity, just most windows to look into."
,,Busy,2.0,,So busy and full of shops you can find in Australia! However very good dumplings and the macarron shop on the lower level of Paragon shopping plaza is amazing!!!!!!!!!
,,orchard area in weekend,4.0,,stay up to late night at orchard area during weekend and start an early day on sunday for a duck tours
,,Countless Malls,4.0,,"Orchard road (particularly at night) is a vibrant shopping strip with a combination of boutique/luxury stores down to bargain basements (literally). There are plenty of hotels and restaurants and you could almost spend a full day (and most of your spending money) traversing the myriad shops and malls.

Crossing the road can be quite a challenge as most of the road is fenced off and you have to find a underpass, which can be rather frustrating when you spot a shop you want to visit but you have to walk another mile to cross the street to get to it...

Also, be aware that catching a cab home can also be quite a testing experience - which is not uncommon in Singapore's main areas. At certain times a day, the mall taxi queues are chock full of people and the hotels will only hail cabs for guests. My advice is either take a train or be creative with where you will hail a cab (side streets etc) and have patience.

Otherwise, Orchard Road is a vibrant, fun day that may end up costing you more than you bargained for,"
,,Excellent Xmas decorations,5.0,,Great to wander at night to shop and see the decorations
,,Don't miss this...,5.0,,The Christmas lights were switched on - a truly amazing sight and a must if you're there at that time of year.
,,Orchard Street is Vegas Except the Casinos are Malls,5.0,,"Amazing street to wander on. Every major designer and store is here. Bring your wallet and if you your timing is right, try to be there is November to early January to see the great Christmas decorations in day and night."
,,"if you like shopping, this is the place",3.0,,"Row pom row of shopping malls line up on this road. Hoards of people and pretty much anything you could want to buy. If your not into people watching or shopping, then avoid this area like the plague."
,,Still the place to visit in Singapore,4.0,,"The grand old shopping street of Singapore is still glittering in style. You have not been to Singapore if you have not visited Orchard Road. No real bargains there, but all designer brands like in other places in the world. Go have a lunch at the Marriott terrace and see the people walking by, shop at Takashimaya, the largest mall on Orchard. Try Durian ice cream for only one Sing Dollar from one of the rolling ice cream vendors."
,,Busy,5.0,,Singapore's great organised SMRT takes you directly under the shops. And they are all linked with tunnels so you dont get wet or too hot. Christmas lights were out which was a treat to see.
,,Shop till you drop,4.0,,"Great to go and have a look but we didn't see too many shopping bargains. A lot of high end shopping right along this strip. You need to look long and hard to find a bargain. Some excellent eating places hidden away in some of the shopping centres though. Go and have a stroll - if nothing else, enjoy the exercise while the world rushes by...."
,,Christmas lights,5.0,,The Christmas lights are wonderful and shopping malls are also fitted with thousands of lights.
,,Typical High End Shopping Area,3.0,,"All the high end stores are represented, several times, on Orchard Road. Some malls, some stand alones. Numerous food courts within some of the malls. No bargains if you're looking - can do better at home. Worth 1 visit just to look."
,,Singapore tradition,5.0,,Pretty much a must see in Singapore. Shopping is no longer cheap in Singapore but its a great place to people watch and a great insight into Singapore culture.
,,Lots of shopping,4.0,,"All sorts of shopping available here, anything you can think of. There is a huge bookstore you can't miss that sells books in about 5 different languages! Some of the shopping malls are not what you think at night!"
,,You will not be disappointed down this road.,5.0,,Well you will love this experience including the xmas lights. Just returned from four days in Singapore. The shops are amazing and you can buy anything you want including a Marks and Spencer dept store. Assistants very friendly and helpful in the shops we went into. Worth a visit day or night as they stay open until 9.30pm ish.
,,For Serious Shoppers,5.0,,This busy road has a host of shopping outlets including all the top brands that can be found in upmarket areas of the world I visited one shopping mall that had five levels of high quality goods
,,Shopper's mile,5.0,,"Well marked malls and plazas - some great shopping for labels we don't see in Australia, and also for the absolutely delightful Emerald Hill Street, which leads off it. The old Malay houses were beautiful to see."
,,Tourist Trap,3.0,,No longer have any charm on me. There was just too much tourists and locals stuffing the road. Inflated prices and gets kinda boring.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Easy for everythings, transportion to other place, shopping centre and etc."
,,Alwasy Amazing,5.0,,"We go to Orchard Road with our kids often as we live in Singapore and I feel its always nice to give shoppers a better feel of our country. Orchard is full of many diffrent malls though the big ones are ION, Plaza Singapura, Paragon and 316@Somerset. The shops there are plentiful and the golden rule is if you find something and you think it's a bit expensive, there will be a cheaper shop somewhere in Orchard. Another tip is to not jaywalk as the car's there come and go very fast and it won't be wise risking your life."
,,Compulsory,4.0,,"Of course, no visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Orchard Road. There’s not much to say except:
1. Expect crowds
2. Expect shops
3. Expect crowds

My only advice is to eat either earlier or later than everyone else… this is especially true if visiting with children when you require a table of 4 or 5 seats. You won’t have any trouble finding a table at 11am, and all the food will be fresh. If you try to get a table at midday or 1pm… good luck! Everyone has an opinion about their fave place to get food, but every local I know loves the Food Opera foodcourt in the ION Basement, and I would agree.

If visiting in late-November and December, skip the daytime visit as it comes alive after dark… the Christmas lights are really stunning.

For the non-shoppers in the family the Lido has a fantastic IMAX and regular cinema complex inside Isetan (across the road from Wheelock Place and ION). And there is another huge cinema complex further east called Cineleisure Orchard (just behind the Mandarin Gallery). And the cinema is really cheap in Singapore compare to Australia :)"
,,Fun,3.0,,"Alot of stores, malls and restaurants. Met alot of amicable Pinoy. Very cleana nd disciplined people."
,,Nightlife Hub,4.0,,"Orhard tower in Orchard road is the one of the hot Night Life area in Singapore... In the day whole of orchard road is good for shopping.... In the night it has all sort of night life things... Bar, Pub, etc... But be careful with Bar girls they suck your wallet till it gets empty..."
,,"Shop, shop, shop!",4.0,,"Lots of variety, lots of recognisable names. Good shopping! Christmas lights are usually (like this year's) lovely."
,,Shops Orchard road,4.0,,Amazing amount of shops and eating places in and around.
,,"GREAT PLACE TO SHOP, EAT AND PEOPLE WATCH",4.0,,"I always enjoy being on Orchard Road, it is Singapore and if you can't find it on Orchard Road you don't need it.... We always stay in a hotel that is on Orchard Road or one block off. The only other place that is as exciting and bit cheaper is Buggis Junction but Buggis is more like a giant flea market, Orchard Road is more main stream and not as crowded."
,,plenty to see and do but buy an umberella !!,4.0,,variety of shops excellent but expensive. Shops within easy walk of Orchard hotel.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,With Malls malls and more malls its shoppers paradise. if you clearly understand the directions shown in the underpass you can get to so many of these malls through the their basements. Its soo much better in the rainny season. Personally i liked the food hall and shops at Takashimaya mall the best.
,,Shop till you drop,5.0,,A great one-stop location for shopping in Singapore. Long opening hours and a great choice from cheap to luxury. Great food halls in every shopping centre.
,,No other place equal for shopping experience!,5.0,,"Not New York, not London, or anywhere; that's the place! You can find all and special for you as you want. Avoid Sunday's, it could be too crowed!"
,,Great Shopping,4.0,,"This is the best place in Singapore for shopping, food courts & restaurants. There are mega malls galore & the streets are beautifully decorated at this time of year :-)"
,,shops,5.0,,"shops shop and shops. Underground has more stores than on ground. Its Shopping street, malls everywhere."
,,Always facelifting,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the major shopping center belt in Singapore. It's a must for first-time visitors to Singapore to come to Orchard Road. It's like Paris with its Champs Elysees, Tokyo with its Ginza.

What I see every time I visit Singapore (particularly Orchard Road), there is always something new, something different. Some shops have changed their facades so they look fresher, brighter, if not classier. They always do facelifting to keep up with the always-changing environment.

I used to like being in Singapore at Christmas time. The Christmas decoration created by the shops and malls alongside the road was spectacular and amazing. I could feel the joy and warmth that Christmas time brings, but unfortunately for the last few years, the Christmas decoration was not that spectacular anymore. I don't know if that was because the budget cut due to the global financial crisis or just the change of the way how people nowadays perceive Christmas. Maybe it's no longer a festive and merry-making season, but more a time to do a reflection of the year, so the decoration is not that grandeur anymore."
,,Crowded! Great place for shopaholic,4.0,,"I get very happy here. Many shopping places I can visit. All I wanna do when I see it, shopping, shopping, and shopping. Heaven for all shopaholics! From ION Orchard, Tangs, Wisma Atria, H&M, and others. Just take a walk around Orchard Road, mall-hopping! I bought an ice cream there with bread, S$1 and it's delicious!!"
,,Singapore Shopping Central,4.0,,"Ion, Tang's, Takashimaya, Paragon, malls and designer stores galore. It does get crowded on weekends and in the evenings but is worth a good stroll to window shop and checkout what's new in the world of fashion."
,,Too Busy!,3.0,,"I hated it, could have been in any major city in the world! Great if you like retail therapy, not for me!"
,,amazing place to see.. prices just like england though,5.0,,what a amazing place big tall buildings in lots of shapes and sizes and lot of the shops you see around the world a lot of designer shops if that is what your looking for
,,"If you like mall shopping, you'll love it",4.0,,Orchard road is full of shops. A bit on the pricey side but a lot of variety. Plenty of designer labels and high end brands. Worth a visit as the atmosphere is quite nice.
,,Great Place for Shopping,4.0,,Wife loved it. Lots of malls within easy walking distance from hotel.
,,Even if you're not into shopping,5.0,,"Just go there and take a stroll - it's worth seeing it.
Now if you're into shopping,... you're going to find heaven.

All department stores are different. Ask for advice. For instance, go to Tangs for lingerie, to Takashimaya for shoes (and pretty much everything), to Heeren for independent younger brands, etc"
,,An OK place to visit now and then.,4.0,,"After earlier living in Singapore for more then ten years, and now spending at least five months here every year we are quite familiar with the city. And we will mostly do our shopping and dining away from the most crowded tourist areas. But we will anyway take a few trips Marriott for high tea, and to ION for stocking up on coffee from their Nespresso shop every stay in Singapore."
,,Some great malls - even better food courts,5.0,,The new dining hall at Takashamia is fantastic - don't forget to see Orchard road at night during the Holiday seasons - the lights are wonderful and the displays....well fun
,,Wow!,4.0,,"There are so many malls there, that you could spend a fortune and a lifetime shopping!"
,,Exciting Time,5.0,,"Orchard Road in November.......apart from the shopping and wonderful places to eat,
you have the beauty of Christmas decorations everywhere. It's lovely in daylight, but out of this world at night. Apart from the delights of Orchard Road you have the Sands. The hotel ...with three towers and a boat built on the top... is something to be seen. You can purchase a ticket for S$20 to go to the observation tower. Don't miss going there. Then there is Clarke Quay...but don't bother going there before noon...nothing open, but when it is open you will enjoy being there.

,,Good for eye for budget traveller,4.0,,So many well known shops and more shops. If you have a more budget than me go for them and enjoy shopping spree.
,,A typical upscale shopping area,3.0,,"Singapore as a whole is a very clean city, and Orchard Road is no different. The vibrant street is lined with many shops, of which many are upscale. There are lots of hotels and restaurants as well. Singapore's public train system has a couple stops along the road which can take you anywhere in the city.

Orchard Road is quite nice at night, as it is all lit up."
,,Full of shopping centers,4.0,,"It's Singapore's most famous street I think. There are many shopping centers as well as top brands shops along this street, well I was just aiming to have a look, didn't buy many things, but still quite impressed by so many goods. Worth going there."
,,"If you're a girl, you'll love it! ;)",4.0,,"Basically Orchard Road is mega mall after mega mall. Every trendy shop you can think of is here. There is nothing at all to do on Orchard Road other than spend money. So if shopping is what you enjoy most when you're in a foreign country this is your place... blah!

The only cool part about Orchard Road is the exterior of the Ion Shopping Center. Architecturally it is a very impressive and interesting building to look at.

The malls also do offer great A/C... so if you're walking around the city a lot and being an active visitor they are a nice place to cool off."
,,Nice christmast light,5.0,,"The crowd was fantastic. Thelight decoration here and there was also tremendous. The crowd you can find from varieties of nations. Its clean and safe to walk by yourself, even in night time"
,,Orchard Crazy,5.0,,"Love Orchard road.....great shopping, top eating and a beautiful strip which is absolutely spotless. A real credit to Singapore."
,,Long street,3.0,,We walked for awhile but didn´t shop anything though. But the street is very long and there are so many shopping centres. Great variety.
,,Shopping Paradise,5.0,,"Orchard road is the place to go if you like shopping. Two interesting places to shop are Tangs Department store (cnr. Orchard & Scotts roads) and the Japanese department store 'Takashimya'. When you are all shopped out and need a cold drink and a good meal, the food republic on the 4th floor of Wisma Atria is the place to go. For the best Malay chicken curry in Singapore, go to the food court at bottom level of Tangs department store and look for the lady selling curry and 'Nasi Lemak' at the entrance to the store, we always make a bee-line for this place but make sure you go early, she often sells out by late afternoon."
,,hyped up orchard road,3.0,,its just another shopping -glitzy area...great crowd...big names...solid done up shops....for the rich...not my kind of shoestring budget tourist shopping areas....
,,If you love shopping this is a place to be!,4.0,,Shortly saying it is one HUGE shopping mall above and below ground level. Many corridors of shops which looks like a labyrinth. I was too scared to get lost there but if you are a shopping animal just ENJOY :) Absolutely beautiful as of 19th November when all Christmas decorations got enlightened. Not to be missed!
,,"Average shopping, very hot exploring on foot",3.0,,"While we heard so many good things about shopping in singapore, we found the variety and the prices weren't that great.
We were shopping for shoes and spent the entire day traipsing up and down from shop to shop trying to find a single place that sold in larger non-asian sizes.
The best part of the street was probably later in the evening and visiting some of the bars that opened up."
,,alot of pleasure,4.0,,orchid tower is located there if u want to have fun
,,For the deep pockets,3.0,,This market makes sense only when you want to shop for high end brands and dont care how much you spend.. We found all brands but unfortunately all brands were priced astonishingly higher than what you would get in US or India..
,,wooo bring your credit card!,5.0,,"Wow lots of beautiful shops with lots of nice treats! all your high end designer which is wonderful if thats your thing but i am afraid it is a little outta my budget but fun to look all the same! Lots of nice food outlets and bars and a lovely place to walk around!

The Christmas lights are beautiful too, a sight to be seen if your lucky enough to be there at that time of yr."
,,Buzzing,4.0,,"Obviously, this place is one of the most famous landmarks of Singapore, and when we went there, it is buzzing with activities and people. It is interesting to walk down, and see all the stalls and shops on this road.. but I can't really say it is cheap"
,,one stop shopping area,5.0,,"Too crowded during holiday season, but my fave is when the sale is on ... I shop till I drop"
,,Shopping Fantastic!,5.0,,Loved the shops but couldnt take back more than 23 kg grrr.
,,So Many Shops,5.0,,We couldn't believe that there was so many shopping centres together! Nice to look around at ION.
,,Paradise!,4.0,,"If you like to shop, this is your Paradise. Take a day or two or more... A great experience for all."
,,Not on a weeknd!!!,3.0,,"I guess if you are into bumping into the vast crowds this would be the place to go, but if you value personal space..skip it! I would STRONGLY suggest NOT going on a Saturday! It is full of activity however and if you find a little niche to simply sit back and people watch..it is great! Shopping is king here and if you like the hustle and bustle...a great thing to do."
,,just shops,3.0,,"if your not into shopping for brands, don't bother. It is not the cheap alternative thatit once was."
,,fashionable street but not bargain anymore..,3.0,,"The place look good always, well maintain and keep improving all the time. It's nice place to stroll in the evening with many shops, department store, restaurant, hotel, food centre and many more. This is the heart of Singapore Shopping spree. However, the prices are not cheap anymore compare with the same brand name in Malaysia and Hong Kong or even Thailand, Singapore is a little bit higher. But if you do not mind about the price, this street is for you to roam around and enjoy yourself."
,,nothing but shops,4.0,,hard to know where to start here I would suggest that you would need more than one day to even go close to having a look at most of it.
,,Orchard Road Shopping,3.0,,Huge choice of clothes shops . Excellent range and choice but no longer value for money.
,,Excellent Shopping,4.0,,Can't beat it - Orchard Road has everything! Don't miss the new flagship Marks & Spencer inthe Wheelock Plaza.
,,All the big names in world fashion are here plus more,4.0,,"Loved the variety of shops along this road, from very up market expensive to the smaller store holders. Just like the rest of Singapore plenty of food too! Did not like the prices not that much different from OZ. Also cafes etc add on a service tax and then a govt (GST) on top of this total price, Starts to get expensive when you compare to the basic menu price. Service was good in most places."
,,The Heartbeat of Singapore,5.0,,During the day as we strolled down Orchard we saw numerous tourists who like us were trying to get their time zone adjustment in place. Then at night the tourists disappeared and the locals came out and everything changed into a teeming of masses. Will all of the shops and foods courts it is difficult to pick any out other than to say that you can find it on Orchard. It you like watching people go there!
,,My favourite shopping street,5.0,,"With over 12 trips to Singapore in 20 years we have seen Orchard Road change into the modern shopping district it is today. Although it is full of designer shops there are still lots of bargains to be had. Tangs department store has great sales and the items are good quality. Go to Paragon if you like slightly more brand names. Markes & Spencers can be relied on for value and quality - and even winter items! The newer centres near Emerald boast lots of young fashion at very keen prices. And for shoes they are everywhere. The best way to approach your day is in comfy shoes, loose clothes and start at one end and keep on walking. By nightfall treat yourself to a taxi home repleat with all your goodies!"
,,Shopping haven..especially Singapore Great Sale!!,4.0,,"prepare to be swayed away with all the glittering stores in the modern architecture of all shopping malls for 2.2km in Orchard rd. Watch out your wallet! or you will not realize it will be gone in 30mins or so.

If your scene is more like Prada, Burberry, and other high-end stuff, this is exactly where you have to be. Thank GOD we stayed at Singapore during SINGAPORE GREAT SALE! it is like Christmas in the middle of July. Prices were slashed 50%-70% off. ah I'm speechless."
,,Best shopping road in the world,5.0,,"This street keeps changing every time I come back to Singapore, and every time it becomes more and more beautiful and shining."
,,great shopping experience,4.0,,"Lots of big names and stores, but still also a large number of older enterprises. Lovely!"
,,Shopping trip,5.0,,Great to browse the shops but watch the prices. Plenty to see and it is easy to get carried away.
,,good shopping district,4.0,,is a nice avenue with full of malls around but do not expect bargain prices
,,Singapore Strip,4.0,,"This is the mainstay of Singapore. There are shops, malls, resturants andbars all up and down it."
,,crowded crowded street,3.0,,if you're with kid and happens to come to Singapore on rainy season on weekend then just simply avoid Orchard. It's seriously crowded...from the pavement...to the mall itself. Other days beside weekend...it is actually ok to walk around Orchard
,,Is it really that special?,3.0,,"I had heard so much about Orchard Road and the supposedly wonderful Christmas lights. When I visited there in December perhaps my expectations were too high, but Orchard Road failed to impress me.

Yes, the lights were nice, but they were only as nice as a lot of other shopping streets around the world. Were they special enough for people to go all gaga over? I didn't think so.

Perhaps I'm not the right person to review Orchard Road as I am not generally someone who likes wandering around crowded Big Brand shopping centres, and Orchard Road is just another big brand shopping fix for the retail junkies of the world."
,,So many shops to spend your money!,4.0,,I had a great time going through all the malls and looking at all the shops. We went on a public holiday and there were so many people out shopping so it was very crowded. Thoroughly recommend this if you love to shop.
,,Too Busy,3.0,,"We visited Orchard Road on a weekend and it was so congested, it was difficult to get into any shops, not my favourite place - I would recommend the plazas for shopping as they are aircronditioned and have many stores to choose from within one complex."
,,Good Bye Orchard Road,4.0,,"With Marine Bay Sands, and the surrounding area; I will never miss Orchard Road."
,,the most well known street there,4.0,,"lOt of huge shopping malls , all brands , all categories, lot of restaurants inside malls , but less outside"
,,Shopping haven,4.0,,"This is mall heaven for people looking for luxury items at reasonable prices. If you're a shopping addict like I am, this is THE place to be."
,,Nice crowded place- good for window shopping dont buy,5.0,,"Orchard has all the big hotels and all big stores around. You can find stores on electronics, consumer goods and as well there are good hop-on-off buses to take you around. all major brands are available but not a good option for people to buy."
,,Great for shopping,4.0,,"Well, if you like shopping malls and metropolitan bars, this is a good place for both daytime shopping and evening entertainment."
,,Shopping malls on one very long road,3.0,,"Orchard Road is full of high end shopping malls. I usually go there when I stopover in Singapore but when you do it for the fifth time or repeatedly, it can get a little boring. Like other reviewers, I agree that the shopping malls are not for bargains.

There are plenty of food shops inside and outside malls to sample some local specialties. Outside the mall when it is very hot, you can also try some local ice cream from some uncles and aunties selling ice cream from the carts."
,,Colorful and Vibrant!,5.0,,"I had gone before Christmas. So, the streets and malls were fully lit up and decorated. It was very colorful and the lanes were full of people, happily shopping away. We decided to walk all the way, and by the time we entered each mall and reached the end of the road, we were dead-tired. Had burgers at McDonalds, and took a the MRT back to Farrer Park. A very good shopping experience. The best brands in the world are in the mall (be ready to empty your wallets!)"
,,Great Shopping Experience,5.0,,"Orchard street can only be appreciated by shopaholics and foodies.. i shopped like crazy and continued till dawn.. ate like a pig and drank like a fish, so people go get it.. Orchard road is the ultimate place to be.."
,,SHOPPING FREAKS,4.0,,"Once you reach orchard street , you can visit all the malls around and all the designer brands like Tods , Armani , Gucci , etc are there .You also have toysurs for children in 2 malls where they can be busy till you shop your own stuff ."
,,Not as it was,3.0,,Orchard Road is only special if you ahve tons of money and like to shop in designer stores. The charm and bargain hunting of the old days is dead and gone!
,,Shop till you drop,2.0,,"Well...this is a place you either love or hate. I belong to the second group. Orchard Road offers one shopping mall after the other and you will have a huge crowd there every night. However, don't expect anything ""particular"" or ""special"". You will find the commonly known brands and no interesting boutiques..."
,,Brand name shopping,4.0,,Brand name shoppers paradise with its own MRT station. There are numerous complexes with all the high end labels. Each also have their own high quality food courts with a variety of cuisines.
,,Worth a visit - but not for bargain shopping,3.0,,some great Malls and we loved the Paragon the most but really not a shoppers paradise. Check out Robinsons and Marks & Spencer and there are some good shoe shops. Hated Lucky Plaza seems so old now in comparison
,,Good for mostly everything,4.0,,Borders Books stores are here above the Marks and spencers store. There is a lower standard mall called Lucky Plaza for bargaining. For food can head to the great food court of 'Food Republic'. Somerset area has cinemas.
,,It used to be famous,3.0,,"This might be heaven for luxury/high-end brand item hunters, which I am not. Such a large shopping area is now available in any big city especially in Asia; Hong Kong, Jakarta, Seoul, Tokyo, so I don't think it is unique, maybe it used to be....More"
,,Shopping shopping,4.0,,A Must for the shopping mad lots of coffee stops for the men to.
,,Shops Galore,4.0,,Shop till you drop orat a pavement cafe with a cool drink and watch the world go by.

,,Chadstone on Steroids,5.0,,"Amazing variety of shops and cafes. So clean and well staffed. Busy but orderly. Very expensive if compared to Thailand Malaysia or Bali, but much more upmarket. All the brand names and also some cheaper alternatives. Lovely trees and plantings which are well maintained. A...More"
,,"Far too many shops, not enough time",5.0,,"Shopping malls everywhere, selling all sorts of things that I never knew that I wanted. Very busy area. Relatively expensive, better value away from the road."
,,Must visit for shopping,5.0,,"If shopping is what your raison d'etre is, then this is your place to be. Almost everything is available on Orchard street at all prices. This is a long street, so exploring this place for the best deals can be time consuming. There are plenty...More"
,,It's Shopping,3.0,,"All the High Street shops from Western Europe and the US are here. It has no real appeal for me, but if shopping Malls are your thing then I guess this is heaven!"
,,Bustling,5.0,,"If you like shopping, you'll like Orchard Road. It is full of huge malls which let you enter, but make it difficult for you to navigate your way out again, however they all have food courts, so you wouldn't starve. There are shops of every...More"
,,Festive time there on Christmas !,5.0,,I was there in December and the Orchard Road was lit up beautifully with christmas decorations everywhere !! I loved the Ferrero Rocher Chritmas Tree there ! It was good fun to walk there in the night and shop at both High End and Simple Local Stores !!
,,dont go here unless you like shopping or eating!,4.0,,i'm a bit bored of orchard road but probably becasue i always end up here when i stop in singapore. for first timers its definately worth a visit. great if you like shopping and lots of different places to eat (esp cake shops if you just want a coffee or afternoon tea etc). taxis are very cheap to and from hotels and very reliable.
,,Shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"All the high end stores can be found along orchard road as well as many malls. This is not the place for bargain hunting! Put on those comfy shoes and be prepared to walk! orchard road is a long and very busy, especially during weekends"
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Shopping paradise, everything you could ever want in one street."
,,shopping,4.0,,International brands at good prices goods were worth the cost and not being overcharged many shops to visit a day is also to less to complete the visit to the shops...... transportation is easy as there is a met close by that is fast and easy to travel by ......
,,Nice Place to have walk or shop,4.0,,This is one place where if you are in Singapore has to be visited and luckily I was staying there at Orchard Hotel. Nice Place as has the accessibility to most part of the city and then you can g for long walks and shopping is one thing which makes you happy
,,Non stop shopping,5.0,,Shop till you drop territory - you just can't do every arcade/shopping centre etc in 4 days! Be prepared for crowds after 6pm
,,Same old orchard road!,4.0,,"Missed orchard road, this was my fifth visit to Singapore and we frequent orchard road and we usually book in hotels in that area as well as Scott's road."
,,High End Shopping Not really a Bargain Area,3.0,,"Too many high end outlets. We found Lucky Plaza, also in Orchard Road a great place for bargains, souvenirs and were able to bargain with shop owners for the best price."
,,Excellent shopping and dining!,5.0,,Great at night and day! Plenty of high end and regular shopping and dining.
,,"Shopping, Shopping, Shopping",3.0,,"That is all that is there, so great if you are wanting to go shopping. That's about it"

,,Best place for shopping,5.0,,Every year I go there to shopping.... Specially for shoes... One of my best destination for shopping. Very safe for shopping and I love every minute of it...
,,So many shops,4.0,,"Shops shops and more shops...highe end and expensive, most items were comparative or more expensive that Australia. Still worth a look and the air con is great for some respite from the heat"
,,A good place for eating and souvenir shopping,5.0,,"Actually this is my favorite location in Singapore even compared to Orchard. There are a lot of delicious and cheap food in the foodcourt. And many souvenir shops, try the shops in the back they a little bit chaper"
,,"So much luxury, so little time",4.0,,"Only in Hong Kong have I seen so many luxury stores in just a few short blocks. Lots to see, shop, and people watch. But be a bit careful in the later evening, but generally just at the Orchard Towers end across from the Hilton - lots of prostitutes."
,,There is no orchards in Orchard Rd...,2.0,,"Singapore is no longer that people friendly, culturally interesting, affordable place that many travellers tend to associate with some 20 years ago. It's now Money Land, and may as well has its very name replaced. Singapore's Great Leap into the Ultra Commercial is, I believe, an inevitable consequence of Singapore government's so called Progress at Moulding the island into a multi-trillion dollars Playground for the Nouveau Riche. Just look at the Integrated Resorts. Gone were the days when people were genuinely friendly towards others. Nowadays, people shake hands & attempt to make friends with you because they want to sell you something (if you look like a foreigner), or get you to sign up for a new credit card (if you appear local).

Consider visiting Bangkok or Hong Kong instead. Things are cheaper there, people are friendlier, and there are more cultural things to see and do than to waste your money on the casinos."
,,A Hectic Place,5.0,,"Orchard Road is always busy and particularly colourful in the evening. Shopping is the order of the day however dinind opportunities are everywhere. Traditional food stalls can always be found in most basement complex areas where if you are prepared for laminex tabletops, the food is amazing. Lucky Plaza presently undergoing a renovation has been a long time favourite and the Claypots a magnificent feed."
,,Crazy shopping!!!,4.0,,"If you are out to shop, go to Orchard. If you want beautiful views,coffee shops, waterfront, and relaxation, go to the Marina area."
,,Shopping paradise!!!,5.0,,Very nice shopping experience!! Soo many malls like Paragon. anD the very famous japanese takashimaya!
,,No one has enough money to spend here,5.0,,Fantastic but just too many shops - keep the credit cards
,,Shopping Heaven!,4.0,,"I found orchard road as shopping heaven of Singapore. The newly built Ion Mall is simply amazing! We watched a movie in IMAX shaw theatre, undoubtedly a very well maintained theatre. Would recommend to every one who come to Singapore for tourism or Business. Orchard should be part of their"" must visit places ""itinerary, A worth visiting place!"
,,Great Shopping,5.0,,What great shopping on Orchard Road! I think this was my favourite shopping in Singapore and we will definitely be back with lots more money to spend! Loved all the shops there that we do not have at home.
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,The variety of shops was amazing ans it kept going on forever. Dont forget half the shops are underground
,,Too much of a good thing,3.0,,"Block after block of malls all selling the same things, same name brands. How do they all remain in business and how do the brands not compete with themselves?

I didn't find the prices to be that great. In fact, brand items cost more here than back home."
,,fashion at a price,4.0,,"all designer shops down one side, opposite cheaper copies, long road and tireing in the humidity in singerpore"
,,Buzzing,4.0,,"Great shops & atmosphere, real lively place, lots of places to eat even at 10pm at night!!!"
,,Too expensive,3.0,,Well I had been told by so many friends that it was reLly good value. I though everything was very expensive. Even Zara clothing cost 30 per cent more than the same items cost in Spain
,,Shopping paradise,5.0,,"Shop shop shop.. almost everything you need is here. The road is pedestrian friendly and clean. The road is full of malls and shopping centre. wear a comfortable shoes because it's such a long way to walk and so much things to shop. Try to buy ice cream for approx $1 from the street stall, very refreshing after all the shop and the walk."
,,Waste of time if you have primary school aged kids,2.0,,"We struggled to find any decent toy shops, they mainly have collectables. Bottled water we bought at most places tasted like milky water. Bus from Marina Bay was easy & cheap to catch."
,,One of the world's great shopping destinations,5.0,,"Orchard Road is one of the world's great shopping precincts.

It offers several major shopping centers- some of them could each take a whole day to explore!

The variety of goods on offer is vast, ranging from specialty shops offering the most exclusive- and expensive- luxury goods to stalls offering bargain prices (for example the basement of Lucky Plaza).

And, there's a wide range of dining and snacking opportunities.

It's well worth a visit, to see the wide range on offer.

Tips:

1. It would pay to consider setting aside a whole day- wear good walking shoes as well!

2. There's an MRT (underground railway) station in the basement of the ION Orchard shopping center.

3. Tang's Department Store is a good mid-market shop offering a wide range of department store lines.

4. For anyone interested in English lines, Marks and Spencer hacve several branches- including small but useful food and wine shops offering a selection of their English foods.

5. Takashimaya is a large department store, with a wide range of merchandise and apparel.

They have a ""Talking Hall"" in the level 1 basement where they offer a lot of bargains- worth a look!

Also, in the level 2 basement, there's a Cold Storage supermarket and a food hall, where they offer Harrods groceries.

Special tip: they offer a discount ""passport"" for overseas visitors.

6. Kinokuniya is an excellent bookshop in the Takashimaya Centre."
,,So much to see...sore feet,4.0,,TAKE COMFORTABLE WALKING SHOES. Thais will take a while but it is so worth it. However after a while the more shops you visit the more same-ish they become. So you could probably see all the shops in a day to a day and a half.
,,Past it's Prime,3.0,,"Now that Marina Bay Sands is the centre of all the top end stores, Orchard Rd is looking a little old. You can still get good tailoring in the Orchard Plaza and some of the bars and restaurants in the back lanes and side streets are good,. Nonetheless Orchard Rd is the heart of Singapore and worth the look."
,,Buzzing Commercial District in the Heart of City,4.0,,Orchard Road is a buzzing district in the heart of the city. High Class District for top notch shopping and house to some of the finest hotels of the city. I most enjoyed my time having coffee on roadside open cafe joints.
,,almost too much shoppinng!,4.0,,"Most woman love to shop and I am no exception, however Orchard Rd wore me out! Seriously - a great selection of shops with lots of local designer shops at reasonable prices. There are the usual chain stores and International boutiques but I really enjoyed purchasing some different pieces of clothing."
,,Singapore's Champs-Elysees,4.0,,"If high-end shopping or window-shopping is your thing, this is your place. Take a stroll down Singapore's Champs-Elysees, where you'll find more than one Louis Vuitton boutique, Boss, Ferragamo, Prada, etc. Several of the malls are linked underground, by airconditioned tunnels, so you don't necesssarily have to sweat it out by walking on the street outside."
,,It was fun for a couple days shopping,3.0,,"Orchard Road is great high end shopping. It is one Chanel after another, when one disappears from sight another appears! How many glitzy Chanel, Dior, and Louis Vuitton, does one need in sight at any one time? Many women would answer at least one! And Orchard Road will fill that need. The malls on Orchard Road are man made shopping wonders. One can enter a mall on Orchard Road and exit 3 blocks and 6 hours later and feel like she has barely touched its surface! Truly Orchard Road is the shopping mecca you have heard it to be and it was fun to explore for the first couple of days of our holiday. Honestly I preferred Chinatown and Little India. Those areas were far more interesting and made me feel much more like I was on holidays and visiting a foreign country rather than downtown in my own."
,,amazing buildings/sights,4.0,,"although very pricey, this area is amazing to photo and check out. Like everything in Singapore, well planned."
,,Shopping heaven!,5.0,,"This is the perfect place to get some shopping done while you're in Singapore. It's also got some interesting buildings to look at and if you venture into some of the side streets, you'll find some quiet old neighbourhoods (like historical Emerald Hill, for example). Allow a good three to four hours, at least."
,,Great Shopping!,5.0,,It has amazing malls to cater both expensive and moderate taste. Lucky Plaza is great for souvenir shopping. Emerald Hill has great bars and pubs.
,,Amazing just to look,5.0,,"It is worth the walk, down one side & back up the other, we went into every mall just to get the expierence. Didn't buy anything apart from some toys as we thought it was more expensive than in Auckland"
,,Has it all....bring more than just your pocket money!,5.0,,"It's like this......we know that Singapore is now one of the most expensive cities to visit!
However, knowing this, we keep coming back to our favourite haunt in Singapore, which is Orchard Rd.

Once we get over the shock of hotel rates, we then sift through our wallets and coin purses looking for that extra bit of pocket money we thought we had saved up to spend here!

No Genie appeared after rubbing the bedside lamp in our overpriced room either but it didn’t stop us weaving in and out of hundred of shops along Orchard looking for that elusive bargain.
Twenty years ago, there were a few bargains to be had along this mega-shopping road, not so anymore.
Sale signs do not mean ‘cheaper’ but rather ’not as expensive’!

Orchard Rd has reinvented itself time and again and with that comes remodeled malls, quality products and a multitude of choices. Orchard Rd is THE place to spend your hard earned while in this city.

High prices aside, Orchard Rd is the heart and soul of this city. Day or night can be a rugby scrum of shoppers, not necessarily spending ‘top dollar’ but rather just mingling with other 'like minded' bargain hunters.

We love it not because it has so many shops, restaurants, people and traffic but because it has an atmosphere unlike any shopping area in the world.
When we come home to our humble but excellent shopping street, we always say to each other...
""It's no Orchard Rd""

Enjoy your visit!"
,,Lots of Atmosphere,5.0,,So many shops to chose from. Gets a bit monotonous with repeats of the same shops over and over.
,,A shoppers paradise,4.0,,"Depending on your desires, you should be able to find anything you want. I'm more of a budget shopper so Lucky Plaza is the go. A lot of the malls sell expensive high end brands so that didn't interest me."
,,The Shopping Strip!,4.0,,Crowded on weekends. More of people watching than anything. But its fun being in Orchard Road. Its alive and bustling.
,,Window shopping at its best,4.0,,Do what the locals do and stroll along Orchard rd in the evenings to take in the local atmosphere. But if you're going to spend make sure you have deep pockets!
,,Little slice of America,4.0,,"For those that might be missing America, this is a great place! There are a bunch of American restaurants on this road, as well as some great shopping. You could spend a whole day+ here"
,,Lots of High End Stores,3.0,,"If you want to spend a ton of money, shop here (or at any store in Singapore). We loved walking the street, but once was enough. Not a Christmas bargain to be found."
,,Shopping Haven,5.0,,"Long street of stores and malls similar to many other big cities. Enjoyed the largest bookstore in Singapore and maybe Southeast Asia, called Kinokuniya in the Takashimaya Shopping Centre, and you can find Shanghai Tang in the same mall. It's a bit overwhelming but worth a trip."
,,Everything you can imagine,5.0,,"Singapore has taken shopping to new heights: Orchard Road is one long series of shopping malls with goods from everywhere and in every price range (with many of them being high-end shops). Some are dedicated to specific goods, like technology, while others are the food and clothing ones you find worldwide. Good luck-- prices are not cheap!"
,,Excellent shopping,4.0,,Great place to roam around for shopping during the day and then partying during the night ! Quite overpriced though.
,,"Shopping, shopping, shopping!",4.0,,"Orchard Road is a shoppers paradise, with the entire street lined with shops of all sorts. At night it becomes a sea of neon lights, and is worth a trip just for that. Most of the retail stores were closed after dark, but there are still some shops open, along with all sorts of restaurants and cafes. The street was still very busy, so there was plenty to see. If you have money to burn, a shopping trip to Orchard Road is a must. Otherwise, it is still an interesting place to visit and look around."
,,Bring your credit card!,4.0,,"Very beautiful part of the city. I think that if you are in Singapore you must go and walk around even if you don't buy. These malls are very upscale and have stores like Chanel, Prada, Rolex and etc....window shopping was enough for me but if you are serious about expensive brands this is where you should go!"
,,Cool MUST VISIT !!!,5.0,,"BUSY BUSY BUSY Great shops, restaurants, clubs, street artists, lots of people ! If you love this climate then it should be on your list as a number 1 ;)))"
,,At least visit once when you visit Singapore,4.0,,"Okay, Orchard Road is expensive as hell. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, the good part: There are many stores that cater to the average person. For example there's a huge H&M store selling clothing and accessories and almost everything is under $200. In fact, I bought 7 pants and the total cost was $250. If you walk a little further down Orchard, you may not be able to buy underwear for less than $250 in some stores.

There are lots of buskers (specially around Christmas time) performing up and down Orchard street. The buildings are beautiful and worth looking at. When you're in Orchard, it feels like Singapore has plenty of real-estate (even though the rest of the city is quite congested).

Also a note for people that appear to be of the Indian race: avoid entering the expensive stores if you aren't going to buy anything because Singaporeans (specially the Chinese Singaporeans) can be very rude towards people that aren't rich. I was told to ""keep it to yourself, If you can't afford it, don't look."" angrily when I mumbled (mostly to myself) that an item was very expensive. (By the way, I *could* afford it, but the item wasn't worth it and frankly it couldn't afford my money.)

Other than that, I would recommend you definitely check out Orchard at least once if you're visiting Singapore, even if you aren't planning on buying."
,,Not our thing,3.0,,"This just wasn't our ""thing"" and we visited out of curiosity regarding Orchard Road's reputation. We travel to have different experiences and immerse ourselves in unfamiliar food and cultures. Given that we can shop anywhere (including home), Orchard Road just wasn't terribly exciting to us. We did find a good Thai restaurant a few floors up in one of the shopping centres, so this was the highlight of our visit to the area. This won't be on our itinerary on our next visit - we had more fun walking around the frog porridge restaurants in Geylang (authentic Singapore!) than along Orchard Road."
,,Stay away & enjoy the real Singapore unless you've got money to burn!!,3.0,,"We walked along Orchard Road for a couple of hours: it's extremely busy (I don't generally have a problem with crowds), extremely humid and for Aussies & Brits it's extremely expensive! If you've got money to burn and just came to Singapore to shop, you'll have a brilliant time. If you're just on a sightseeing trip I just wouldn't bother, you won't miss anything and will have a much better time doing something else."
,,A shoppers Paradise,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, you must go here.

There is no doubt that have tons and tons of shops, from the most high end boutiques to some bargain stores and would be able to suit the needs of most shoppers regardless of their budgets.

I would suggest a fish pedicure at the Kenko Reflexology and Spa when you want to take a break from all the shopping, and some bread or desserts from bread talk if you are looking for a snack"
,,Busy busy busy!,3.0,,"Ive been to Mew York City, but it aint got nothing on this! From the momwnt we stepped of the MRT, we wished we had have kept going on back to the hotel. Shopping - yeah for sure, but seriously if youre an international traveller, it hasnt got much you couldnt get duty free. Visit becuase it is a must see, but dont base your whole trip around it. Ive had better shoppping at home in Melbourne. Half a day - tops. needed."
,,shoppping overload,4.0,,"A definate must if you visit Singapore. Orchard Rd is just a shoppers paradise. From trendy to elegant to cheap and inexpensive, you can find it all in the multitude of shopping centres along this great and famous shopping district. In between shopping, there are plenty of food outlets and restaurants to serve all tastes . The heart of the shopping is around the Scots Road intersection of Orchard Road. Easily accessible by MRT/Taxi/Bus, and situated in the heart of the Central business district, this area is flooded with hotels and tourists. Orchard road stretches for over 2-3 km, and all the shopping centres are airconditioned for your comfort."
,,"Shopping, shopping & more shopping!!",5.0,,"What a place! Open from 10am to 10pm. So many shops, suits made to order, electical shops & jewellers gallore! Each time we went there we found something new. Loads of places to eat. So very hot, had to keep going back to the hotel for wash & change of cloths! So much to do & not enough time, next time we are going for a month!"
,,one long shopping district but come here if you have the money to spend alot ...,4.0,,"Orchard Road is basically the main street of Singapores shopping district. You'll need a day just to go through the street and go through the serveral shopping centres that Orchard Road has to offer and possibly another day.

We only had one day so we started somewhere in the middle and just walked from one shopping centre to another. It was the 'great singapore sale' when we went in end of June although even with the sales we felt that the prices were still pretty expensive.

We did a bit of shopping e.g 2 levi jeans for $200 singapore dollars and a couple of things here and there but not to the extend of going crazy and buying everything. Singapore is a pretty expensive place and whilst we were in the sale season, we didn't feel like the prices were cheap enough for us which was really dissapointing because i think singapore fronts itself as a shopping haven but i'd rather go to hawaii for shopping and i know i'd go crazy there.

So Orchard road in summary - an expensive but nice to see shopping district. If your loaded with money, then you'll be alright, if your someone that has money but would buy on a bargain, try another area or even another country (i think hong kong is close and they have better & cheaper items).

There are subway stations along the road so it was good being able to catch the MRT to go to chinatown after a day of orchard road."
,,overcrowded shopping area,3.0,,"could be a paradise for shopaholic, but definitively not for me. the prices fairly ok if you can handle to walk in and out from mall to mall to more malls. get ready to walk A LOT! not recommended for couple with young children. but if you do, don't forget the bring along the stroller if you don't want to hurt your back.
tips: good for window shopping. if you know what you want to get, better go straight to the targeted place before you wandering around."
,,Shoppers Paradise,4.0,,"One good place in Singapore to shop for. Must visit this place during the great Singapore sale season which begins in June. All the big branded showrooms are there and they have a huge discount to offer during sale. Try to book a hotel near Orchard road if you are a shopaholic because its quite difficult to get a cab late night. Its quite busy all day. One of good mall is Takashimaya. There are a number of malls in this area to shop for. The street is filled with lots activities at night like juggling, magic and night life is fun there. Even walking on the streets is enjoyable. Do not miss the ice cream at Cold stone in this area. Its just yummy and the way they make it is all the more enjoyable."
,,Exaggerated,3.0,,"Expensive and too crowded. Also need to walk out and in from ""mall"" to mall."
,,You can get almost everything here - if money were no object,4.0,,"Orchard road is in the heart of Singapore, full with posh shopping centre, private hospitals, and expensive hotels. From souvenirs to branded bags and dress, you can find them all here. You can also find some electronics, but not at a good deal. Many nice restaurants as well for you to take a break after all day shopping.

The pedestrian walk along Orchard Road is very convenient (when it's not too crowded), makes it easy to go from one shopping mall to another one. They also have underpass that connecting these shopping mall, need to worry about the rain no more.

Avoid going on Sunday afternoon, it's gonna be unpleasantly crowded.
If you don't plan to buy many things, better take MRT. Cab needs to take longer route to get here."
,,Singapore is about shopping. Shopping is Orchard Road.,5.0,,"Orchard Road is quite a long stretch but you can almost find stuff to buy for both young & old, male or female. You must definitely visit it 2 weeks before Christmas as the streets will be lighted with special Christmas decorations."
,,Fancy street,4.0,,"It is nothing but a street, where you have fancy restaurants and malls, you can do shopping, you can just walk and watch and you can have dinner or lunch."
,,Retail haven but some culture as well,4.0,,"Orchard Road shopping is maybe what Singapore is about. Dedicated to retail therapy.

The road is busy with pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Be careful to cross the road. You will see tourists confused with their surroundings in the midst of the malls packed together all wanting you to spend money in shops. If truth be told you will find many of them in your home town or the nearest city to you.

The designer shops have designer prices making you wonder how do the ordinary locals manage to afford to shop there. Of course Orchard Rd is also a place to eat. There are cafes, restaurants and coffee shops. There are nightclubs to entertain you and hotels for you to stay in. The malls have food courts and you will find the usual fast food outlets increasingly joined by international brands such as a recent addition, Coldstone Ice Cream for those who have a sweet tooth.

Of course the road is too long to to explore in one day. To resist temptation hop on a bus and at least you can see the area without losing a cent from your pocket.

The retail expansion only took place in the 1970s onwards. Since the number of malls have exploded, gone through renovation and some do serve different communities and price brackets. Lucky Plaza is popular for those looking for electronic items and popular with Filipino workers for example. Also not all the malls will have the same stores so you have to visit the different ones to find a particular shop you wish to visit.

Of course there is also some cultural aspects to the area. Colonial architecture is found in the Goodwood Park hotel, there is a Botanic garden and take a side trip out to Emerald Hill. There are also museums to visit as well."
,,"Busy, bustling, shopping heaven.",4.0,,"This street is crazy busy. With all the billboards, lights, crowds and noise it reminded me a little fo the Las Vegas Strip (minus the casinos) or of standing in Times Square. You can spend a little or a lot here, of both your time and money. There is something for everyone and no matter what it is you are looking to buy you will find it in one of the many endless malls on Orchard Road. Ion was my favourite, but you can't wander through here in half an hour - the place is massive!! Even if you're not a mad keen shopper it's worth just wandering around here for a while, it's part of the Singapore experience."
,,Singapore - Orchard Road,4.0,,"Is the place to be. Nightlife is vibey and colourful. Lots to see and do. Went with children and loved going to a mall that caters for youngsters and teenagers. Ion is one of the nicest malls as it has everything, loved the outside concept of entertainment where movies are screened outdoors. Such a great family trip."
,,Vibrant shopping strip,4.0,,"Though I've been to this area on numerous occasions and having more and larger malls at home, I still find Orchard Road a cool place to hangout. It's a vibrant strip with lots of people of different nationalities, countless dining options and glistening shops. On some weekends there would even be street shows and performances. If you're into high end name brands this is the place to shop or window shop. I find the prices a bit higher here though compared to other cities. I find the ION quite impressive and convenient as it sits right above the MRT station."
,,"Orchard Malls - Ion, Tangs etc",3.0,,"If you're into shopping this is the place, some good eats too but you won't find any stores here that you wouldn't also find in most other major capitals, they are like clones especially for luxury brands. How many outlets do Gucci, LVMH, Chanel etc actually have here?

Basically for Singaporeans, there isn't a lot else to do at weekends except go to the mall, its a small island. Some of these malls can quite literally resemble an ant colony where there is zero co-operation. They are packed.

Singaporean middle class youth are mollycoddled, are a bunch of poseurs, some like to wear those ridiculous big spectacle frames with no lenses (I mean really?) and shuffle around slowly, aimlessly playing with their cellphones in groups. It's a nightmare if you are just passing through the mall with an actual objective of getting some place. Weekends and early evenings are the worst, especially in the malls around Orchard MRT.

So my advice, be prepared or go shopping weekdays during the daytime"
,,"Generic shopping, but pretty",3.0,,"If money is no object, then this is probably the kind of place where it would be spent. If you're on a budget, however...well, it's still enjoyable to walk up the Road at least once to take in the atmosphere and have a giggle at the piped music from the department stores which house shops that you can find all over the world.

Doesn't really compare to just walking around Chinatown, Little India or Kampong Glam and taking in their unique atmospheres and wares."
,,"Shop til you drop, its a shopper's galore!",5.0,,"Orchard Road is the biggest and best shopping area of Singapore. It is reknowed for its shopping outlets that line the stretch of shopping centres. If you love shopping, this is THE best place for you!

Shopping centres both old and new line the streets. The ones that I reccomend:

-Ion Orchard, which houses many designer brands and a humongous food court at the basement. Opened in 2009.

-Orchard Central, Singapore's tallest and most trendy shopping mall, twelve storeys high.

-Ngee Ann City, incorrectly known as Takashimaya, a department store, which is the main tenant there.

-Far East Shopping Centre, which houses many tailor shops, cheap and affordable fashion outlets and cheap food. Great deals found here.

-Bugis Junction, although technically not part of Orchard Road, still extremely close and makes the cut. My personal favorite, containing a whole department store and many fashion outlets and dining options, shophouse-styled.

-Forum the Shopping Centre - specializing in children's clothing and toys (a Toys 'R' Us is located there). Honestly, United Square is better but Forum is more convinient.

-313@Somerset, right above Somerset MRT station making it easily accessible.

-The Centrepoint, more of a 'classic shopping mall'

The time taken in each shopping centre would approximately be thirty minutes. Although I'm not into shopping at all, I still reccomend an hour of shopping/visiting for the average traveler, and three hours for the picky shopper.

All in all, an excellent shopping lane catered to both the elegant and designer clothing-laden shopper and the ones who look for affordable options. Definitely must visit when visiting Singapore!"
,,Excellent shopping area,5.0,,"We walked from our hotel to Orchard road, it is a brilliant shopping area. Unfortunately not everything was open due to Chinese New Year but there was still a huge array of shops open.

You can get all designer gear from Gucci to Prada, also with some more affordable shops. I bought a few items and saved a huge amount from any other place i could buy it.

This is a must do thing when you are in Singapore!!!! give yourself atleast half a day to look around at a casual speed."
,,Assault on your (shopping) senses,5.0,,"Singapore's world famous Orchard Road is a never ending stretch of malls, where you can easily spend a full day. All the major design brands are here, but there are also some department stores, and, if you’re lucky, you may be able to find some great bargains! Besides all the shops, there are many places where you can eat and some hotels too. To reach Orchard Road, you can take the MRT and use one of the 3 stations that serve the street: Orchard, Dhoby Ghaut and Somerset."
,,Wow,5.0,,"It is big, long, busy road and one the best shopping area in all over the word. We could find so many things to do shopping with our fair budget but the goods quality is very good. It was easy to find a kappa, nike, adidas… with many type of models. If you had enough money, we would love to buy everything in here on this road."
,,Place for everything,5.0,,I proudly can say that this road is one of the best shopping roads in all over the world. It very busy almost every time. The shopping stores get full of customer every single day. The service is perfect without any doubt about its quality.
,,Must See!,5.0,,"I visited Singapore in November and it was beautifully lit-up for Christmas. The entire road has the best brand names from Europe, US and Japan available. It is a great place to shop designer wear of any kind. Even if you do not shop you can still enjoy window shoppingore

There is a giant Borders bookstore on this street, which is a treat for booklovers."
,,"chanter, careful your payment.",2.0,,"Actually I have been this street many times, But this time got very bad experience. Due to my aging battery, I want to buy a new mobile. there r many small electronic shops, I drop in one, stuff quote me a competitive price, about 300US$ for Nokia E72, that 15% lower than his neighbor shops. It sounds good for me. then I decide to buy and paid 300$, the stuff was very enthusiasm for intro each mobile functions, soon I found I need to change languages, and during that time I make a trial call. the stuff promise the software service change were complimentary but need a time to upgrade firmware, I agree that and appreciate his service. it really take long time, when I got back the phone still English version. nothing changed. As he said, the network were not stable for download, I can changed it when back to home country. I accept as they offering a free 4G SD card. but soon the merchant show his real face. the bill up to 500$, ask another 200$ which quote for service, OS upgrade were not totally failed as he said, he has unlock the WiFi, and unlock the 3G connection for oversea carrier, which will charge 200$. Language change is free but failed. I m wondering why they dont quote those price in advance. and deliver such service without my endorse, or even no such service. I realize this cheat and want my 300$ money back. but 3 guys round me and threat me to pay another 200$, because the phone I have used(the former trail call), cannot sell any others. it takes hours, they budget from 200$ to 50$, but I insist the former agreed price. Certainly, I have to call my local business partner for help. as they suggest, I call 999 and back to civil world with my money."
,,City of shopping,5.0,,"It was a busy street, you're spoiled for shopping. There are enough things for you to choose: clothes, shoes, handbags ... Brands, imitation also. Diversity, richness. However, prices in Singapore are generally slightly more expensive than in some other cities. But if you travel to Singapore in June or July, season salesin the Singapore, you will buy goods with prices decreased 50% - 70%"
,,Shopper's paradise!,5.0,,"Orchard Road is the premier shopping strip in Singapore.

It includes several shopping malls- each of which could take a full day to explore!

Many of the world's leading designer and upmarket brands are represented here.

Also, there are department stores and specialty shops which cater to basic needs, as well as older style shopping centers which have a myriad of stalls selling a wide variety of apparel and merchandise.

Are there any bargains? You'll need to shop carefully. Make sure you have a fair idea of prices before you commit to buying, to avoid disappointment.

Besides shopping, there's plenty of food choices as well.

There's a variety of hotels in the area- the Hilton, as well as the Regent and the Shangri-La (around the corner).

This is a very busy area both during the day and at night! It's very popular with locals as well as tourists.

Highly recommended

You can easily spend an entire day here, even if you're just window shopping!

Highly recommended"
,,Major Shopping Hub!,5.0,,"2009's Christmas lights-up on Orchard Road is the best so far. Plenty of lightings, not scattered, many Christmas theme decorative and displays along the long walkways, all the way from Tanglin Mall to Singapura Plaza!

With the completion of 3 new shopping malls (Ion, 313@Somerset, Orchard Central), and Orchard Road going through millions $ of upgrade in 2009, the walkways are finally more spacious and brightly lit now. You can easily spend the whole night strolling along the road (shopping time not considered), enjoy the lightings, atmosphere, and catch a few of the street performances infront of Wisma Atria and Takashimaya. Try to start around 6pm before the sky turns dark with a different view, especially for photography. A few sections that should not be missed: Ion, Wisma, Tangs, Paragon, Heeren, Center Point, Central Orchard.

For the shoppers, hope the following list will help you decide which shopping centre to visit in Orchard Rd. Having enjoyed many countries' shopping exprience, we still found shopping in Orchard Rd a gem! Impossible to visit all within a day if you are really into shopping therapy. It's based on local preference, may not be what tourists look for.
- Wheelock Place (lifestyle fashion & products with EpiCentre)
- Far East Plaza (excellent young fashion, Japanese & Korean style)
- Tangs (dept store, local fashion, a special section Tangs&Co for upscale fashion & shoes)
- Paragon (excellent international & upscale fashion, watches, jewelries)
- Ion/WismaAtria/Ngee Ann City (excellent international, upscale & mid range fashion, lifestyle products, EpiCentre , shoes, watches, good cluster of jewelries store, Isetan & Takashimaya, electronics@Best Denki, great variety)
- Heeren (Young fashion)
- Cathay Cinelesiure (Young fashion, small but open till mid-night)
- Orchard Central (mid range & young fashion, good cluster of spa & hair services, EpiCentre)
- Center Point/OG area (dept stores, mid range fashion, lifestyle products)
- Plaza Singapura (mid range fashion, lifestyle products, jewelries)

Even though we go to Orchard Road every week, we are still amazed by 2009’s lightings. Typically, it starts early Nov to end Dec. Always crowded, worst on Fri & Sat nite. IMO, it’s the best time to visit Singapore for the wonderful festive mood and sales!"
,,must see during christmas time!,4.0,,"Have been to Singapore several times - most memorable when I was there during a November period when Orchard Road gets ready with a truly awesome display of Christmas lights and decoration. Literally the whole road is covered!! Would definately recommend during this season, but it was SO busy........ even past 11pm on a week night.

By reputation, Orchard Rd is famous for the crazy amounts of shopping to be done. There is no way you can finish the whole stretch of road as they aren't just shops, there are numerous shopping MALLS on the road and each one is several storeys high. Advice is to do the research before hand, which malls/shops you actually want to visit and try not to get sidetracked!!

My favourite mall is Fat East Plaza (don't confuse with Far East Shopping Centre or something like that..filled with tailors, old jewellery, watch and camera shops). It has heaps of hip fashion- clothing, accessories and make up for cheap prices. I guess it depends your age group....I'm 22 so I love this mall =)

Would recommend Orchard Rd as a great day/night out as there are crazy amounts of first-class eateries. Orchard Rd equals what Singapore is about -> shopping + eating!"
,,If you want to shop while in Singapore this is the place!,4.0,,"A friend of mine who had visited Singapore recommended Orchard Road as did my guidebook which said it was a great place to shop or to sit, relax and people watch. I found this to be true. I didn't really want to do any shopping as such - just wanted a few souvenirs and I found plenty of places selling souvenirs as well as everything from music to designer label clothing and electronics.

If you're looking to shop til you drop this is a good location with everything you could ask for but if you're looking mainly for souvenirs there are lots of smaller, privately owned souvenir shops too. The best place to look for these is in the shopping mall style places they have. Several of them contain up to 5 floors with hundreds of smaller shops. There are also some good, larger souvenir shops in the basements of larger stores but I'd recommend the smaller ones in the shopping malls as they are out of the heat of the day and all privately owned.

Prices here are higher than you would find in other areas of Singapore as it's their version of Oxford Street or Fifth Avenue so if you are out of the centre and have any shopping malls there I would recommend looking there first to judge prices of anything except souvenirs. However if you're looking for souvenirs this is the best place to go and you really wont find the same selection anywhere else.

If you don't want to shop at all there are some restaurants and cafes although these seemed to be mainly chain ones. There were some smaller ones but not as many as you would think. It's a good place to just explore or people watch anyway and isn't far from the Singapore River and other sights in central Singapore."
,,Poker trip to Orchard Road.,5.0,,"After some unexpected news that we would be joining the Asian Poker Tour in Singapore we found ourselves walking the immaculate streets of Orchard Road, a trendy cosmopolitian area. Packed with one off boutiques and well known stores, it creates a tranquil shopping atmosphere. The streets are lined with cafés, wine bars and resturantes with traditional mouth watering crúsine. Also theres a range of places to be visited, such as China Town and Little India, both with different vibes and qualities to remember."
,,Orchard Road Bonanza,4.0,,"I went to Singapore last year and will be there again this year. Orchard road I found to be fantastic. There is so much to see and buy. A shoppers paradise. The multi story shopping centres do have a lot of similar shops, but that makes bargaining all the more fun. It is a great sport!! The areas surrounding Orchard road are also lovely, with the area and streets lit up quite amazingly around Chistmas and New Year. I would not hesitate in reccomending this as a great place to see and experience... Get into it... Head first!!! ENJOY!"
,,Orchard Road Shopping,3.0,,"Well coming from Perth Australia I found Orchard Road a little overwhelming. Not a great place if you don't like crowds, I was amazed at how big the shopping centres were, average was around 7 stories high, and oh no photography is allowed, i went to take pictures inside to show family and friends wat they were like and was stopped by a security guard, something to do with terrorisim etc.

Be prepared for guys to hassle you when you want too look at electrical gear. They will keep hassling you wanting you to buy something. So not recommended if you are after a relaxing shop, but great if you want a cheap video camera, just do alot of haggling, they are very desperate for your business.

As far as clothes etc I wouldnt say that its cheap, pretty average really so dont go looking for specials cause we didnt really find any.

Oh another point, great holiday for laying in as shops dont open till around 10:30-11am and dont close till 9-10pm.

Last point is Sunday is the best time to shop as crowds are way down. Monday to Saturday is the busiest.

But honestly to sum it up, all the shops seem the same, all seem to have the same stuff for sale etc."
,,"Great malls, but Singapore has more to offer than this",4.0,,"I must say that for me personally (coming from a relatively underurbanized city) that Orchard Road is great. Of course the food is excellent; but if you are going to Singapore for Orchard Road, why bother to go? We have such types of strips here in the U.S. You will have much more memorable experiences to go to the parts of Singapore that are not so strongly linked to huge commercial chain malls and shops. Plus the food, clothing prices, and general products are more better found in places like Chinatown, Arab street, Queensway, and so forth.

However, if you want to experience shopping in highly luxurized shopping malls, Orchard is the place to be!"
,,"Takashimaya is fun, esp. the foodcourt",3.0,,"I found Orchard Road to be a bit depressing in a ritzy way (too much luxury, too little personality) but I liked Takashimaya dept. store. It has a fabulous, kaleidoscopic variety of food in the food court, and the same goes for the shoes! Adorable little sandals you just don't find in the US. When I was there, the dragon dancers (they drive away bad spirits during the New Year's celebrations) were very thoroughly and *very* noisily making sure all the bad spirits were cleaned out of the food court. Wow, those cymbals are *loud* in a tiled space. It's very cool to watch the guys in the lion suit, though!"
