,,wonderful surprise,5.0,,"I actually didn't plan to go to place but one night before my return flight i got a ping from a frn who asked me to visit this place. I had nothing much to do on this day so i thought of giving it a shot as it was just two stations away from my hotel. And i don't regret going over and spending the beautiful time at this place. I first went to Haji Lane which is filled with small, colorful and vibrant shops and cafes.So many shops stuffed with handmade things to offer. The next street to Haji Lane is Arab street which shows you the rich Arabian culture in terms of food and house decor luxury items. The architecture of shops and restaurant is Arabian and cuisine is paradise for non vegetarians. Arab street takes you to Sultan Mosque which is beautiful and majestic. It's the combination of religion and modernity."

,,MashaaAllah its a lovely mosque.,5.0,,During my stay in Singapore I offered my Friday prayer at this place. Its a stunning mosque in terms of architectural beauty and the way they have displayed LCD screens on every pillar with english translation of the Juma sermon which is delivered in the local language is very impressive. Appropriate place is there for women to offer their salah as well. Nestled in the Arab street its a very well maintained mosque and my congratulations to all the people who are responsible for the upkeep of the same.

Right outside the mosque there are lots of middle eastern restaurants but I would recommend Positano an Italian place.
,,Absolutely stunning mosque.,5.0,,"What an beautiful place. The mosque is an amazing building to view from outside but also the inside is stunning. There is lots of information on the mosque to read whilst in there but also lots view.
If you are not dressed appropriately you are given a loan outfit to cover up. So don’t worry if you turn up in shorts and vest. You can still access.
The mosque is situated in an area with lots of shops and stalls to browse so easy to pass a couple of hours in this area.
I would highly recommend a visit."

,,Beautiful golden-domed Mosque,4.0,,"The Sultan Mosque or Masjid Sultan is located near Arab Street in Singapore's Kampong Glam district, and is the most important mosque in Singapore. It has a large golden dome and a cemetery on the grounds and is quite spectacular in terms of it's architecture.

The main prayer hall is truly spectacular and the entire area completely covered in a beautiful Islamic motif carpet and looked extremely grand.

At the back of the mosque is Muscat Street where the main entrance is located. In this area can be found lots of Turkish restaurants and places selling Muslim and also other local foods."

The inside of the Mosque was interesting and impressive. Non-Muslims were asked not to go in the main prayer hall, but it could be clearly seen, we weren't hurried or hassled. Close to the entrance were several boards in English providing information on Islam and the mosque. Outside the architecture is very impressive. If you want to eat nearby 'Zam Zam' is very good (and inexpensive) with roadside tables with a view of the mosque."
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"The place is well run by very friendly mosque attendants. You must wear the freely available clothing if your dress style is a little revealing. Beautiful interior, peaceful, calm, and no rush or pressure to move out. Lots of tourists for the main photoshot, so get in line. Located on Arab Street, it is walking distance to Little India (10 minutes) or 5 minutes to Bugis MRT. Also walking distance to Cathedral in Bencoolen.

,,Absolutely Beautiful,4.0,,One of the most beautiful places to visit in Singapore. Not to mention all the amazing Mediterranean restaurants close to it. Would highly recommend!
,,Iconic,4.0,,The mosque is the icon of Arab street. Been there both during the day and night. Both presents different experience altogether but I do prefer the night with its lighting.
,,Sultan Mosque,4.0,,"Singapore's primary mosque is a landmark building in Kampong Glam Malay Heritage District. It is also called Masjid Sultan. The history of the mosque goes back to 1824 when a brick structure was erected in honour of the Sultan Hussein Shah, the first Sultan of Singapore. In the 1920s the mosque was rebuilt with designs by Denis Santry. The new mosque took on the Saracenic style with traditional domes.

It was great experience to be in this place to know more about the Architecture ,Islamic culture in Singaphore.The people were friendly and welcome."
,,Interesting visit,5.0,,"A great experience to be able to enter a mosque. Visitors are given various robes or attire to wear prior to entering the mosque. It was lovely that the gentleman doing this job had such a jovial and friendly personality. A beautiful building, check for opening times as it was closed for a while early afternoon."
,,Mosque,3.0,,Good to visit and see the different beliefs that Singapore has. Very different design and well kept. Friendly people
,,Interesting visit,4.0,,"We came here on our first day in Singapore as we were following a list of what to see! It’s a lovely mosque and architecturally impressive! You need to take your shoes off and I was a bit worried after some of the places I have been, but it was lovely and clean inside, with matting on the floor. There is history written up for people to read and it sheds a little light on the religion. Women are given a gown to wear over their clothes and men in shorts are given a skirt; very worthwhile visit!"
,,Amazing street,5.0,,The area outside the mosque is the Arab street. It throngs with visitors and diners in the evening. The background of the mosque provides a certain charm to the place. A good cultural experience for all.
,,Beautiful,5.0,,Unfortunately we arrived during prayer time so couldn't go inside. Even on the outside it is an amazing site.
,,One of the Top attraction in Singapore,5.0,,"Very nice place to visit. Visitors can go inside when its not time for prayer. Nice building, very clean. Not to miss."
,,Lovely area and mosque,5.0,,"We went to visit the mosque, and they had a women’s section upstairs. With a lift for easy too which was impressive!

Around the mosque are some lovely shops - great for souvenirs and places to eat too, which we found overpriced for what it was compared to the rest of Singapore. Anyway don’t think many other areas offer the same cuisine so we made the most of it.

This area is worth a stroll and spending a couple of hours if you’re already visiting the mosque. Remember to cover up out of respect and courtesy, this applies to men too if you’re wearing shorts."
,,Sultan mosque visit,5.0,,I visited the historic Sultan masjid on Muscat Street. It's an amazing place to see. You need to check the website for visiting hours as there is prayer times during the day that visiting hours are closed for. Please dress accordingly for a mosque visit.
,,Good Place to Learn Southeast-Asia Islamic Culture,5.0,,"It's located in Kampong Glam district and with walking distance from Bugis MRT station. Staffs are nice and friendly, and you can approach them for an introduction. Take note of the visiting hours if you want to go inside."

,,"Stunning Mosque, great area",5.0,,"Kampnog Glam is the historically the Arab quarter of and still has some very significant building, not the least of which js the Sultan Mosque.

Outside Istanbul, I cannot think of a more beautiful, more moving mosque, it is just stunning.

Visitors of all, or no faith are welcome, of course. There is no fee but clothing that covers the knees and shoulder are required, but as with all mosques that we have visited, they have ‘over garments’ that are available for all, at no charge - not that you would want your photograph taken in some of them.

Architecturally, visually stunning."
,,"Impressive, Historic, and Hospitable",5.0,,"The Sultan Mosque is impressive in its architecture, historic in its connection to the birth of modern Singapore, and hospitable to non-Muslim TA readers who’d be interested in going inside.

Architecture: Kampong Glam is dominated by the Sultan Mosque’s huge tri-part golden dome (a finial at the very top, a huge onion dome at the bottom, and a lotus decoration connecting the two). Upon closer inspection, you’ll see that these elements are recapitulated in the chhatris (umbrellas) on top of small pavilions on either side of the dome. And the chhatri-pavilions are found again, on top of each of the minarets flanking the mosque. The rest of the mosque, from the dome’s drum down to street level, is primarily bone-white trimmed with brick-red flourishes. It’s a distinctive type of architecture developed by Victorian Brits during the heyday of the Raj, which you often encounter in India. Architectural historians argue about what to call such architecture, but I’m backing Neo-Mughal as the most apt. You can see the same combination of giant dome, flanking chhatris, and elevated chhatris atop the minarets, at the Taj Mahal. The mosque is one of the most imposing landmarks in Singapore, a city full of striking sights. (See Sultan Mosque, Dome and Chhatris, and Minaret photos). I was once lucky enough to get a photo of the mosque’s dome and western minaret topped by a crescent contrail (see Crescent Contrail photo). I never was there at the right time to get one of the dome topped by a crescent moon (actually, contrary to popular belief in the West, the crescent moon is not a symbol of Islam, which has no symbols.)

History: The “Sultan” bit refers to Sultan Hussein Shah. Hussein, the eldest son of the Sultan of Johore, had the misfortune of being trapped downwind of Johor by contrary monsoons when his father died. But it’s an ill monsoon that does no good, and that delay left the field open for a younger half-brother to seize the throne, with Dutch backing. Which in turn gave the British a splendid opportunity to sponsor Hussein as the rightful sultan of Johore, and give him a small fortune in exchange for his signature on a document transferring a wee bit of real estate on the island of Singapura to them. Hussein wound up becoming Sultan of Johore, as well as quite rich. The British got Singapore, already had Penang and Malacca, and then step-by-step got the rest of Malaya. Even the younger half-brother didn’t do too badly, becoming a sultan in a small way over some turf within the Dutch sphere of influence. Hussein spent most of the rest of his life in a grand new palace in Kampong Glam, and built a royal mosque nearby with classic Malayan architecture (not at all like the current mosque). Sir Stamford Raffles contributed $3,000 to help fund the construction (either the Spanish dollars used for the China trade or the Marie Theresa thalers universally used by Arab traders; if the latter, Raffles donated 165 lbs or so of fine silver, which would now be worth a bit over S$50,000; which was worth a lot more back then, when convict labour worked for free).

A mosque on this site thus goes back almost 200 years: ground was broken in 1824, and the job was completed in 1826. One of the curious consequences of building an instant city in a multi-cultural environment, is that lots of different religions date their first place of worship to almost exactly the same time. Singapore’s first Chinese temple, Thian Hock Keng. was established in 1821; a Sufi shrine was established at about the same time for Indian Moslems, and the first Hindu temple in Singapore, Sri Mariamman, was being started as the Sultan Mosque was being finished. Christians were relative late-comers: the Armenians opened their Orthodox church in 1835, and the first St. Andrew’s was completed in 1836. Within a 15-year period, Singapore had acquired its most revered Sunni, Sufi, Buddhist, Hindu, Orthodox and Protestant places of worship. Of course, several of them were improved and updated in the last 200 years, including the Sultan Mosque. The original mosque, dilapidated by the 1930s, was razed, and the one you see today built on the same spot.

Hospitality: In some parts of the world, non-Muslims are strictly prohibited from entering mosques at any time; at Sultan Mosque, you’re cordially welcomed. You can come in anytime between 1000 and 1200 and between 1400 and 1600 on any day of the week except Fridays, when visiting is restricted to 1430-1600. In order to enter the mosque, you have to be dressed properly: for men, that means long-sleeved shirts and full-length trousers; for women, conservative long-sleeved ankle-length dresses: no plunging necklines, translucent fabrics, or provocative form-fitting clothes. And no shoes inside, of course.

On arrival, you’ll be greeted by a charming docent who’ll escort you inside, up to a certain point. Once inside, no talking whatsoever; ask questions before you enter, or after you exit. You can take non-flash photographs, but should not enter either the main or upper prayer halls (see Main Prayer Hall and Main and Upper Halls photos). The prayer halls here look large, but are even more commodious than you’d think. They can hold 5,000 of the faithful. The central prayer hall has an almost tropical feel, with bright white areas and lots of light lime green. The mihrab emphatically stands out, directing your vision in the direction of the Kabaa, and dwarfing the minbar to the right, from which the imam leads the prayers (see Mihrab photo).

My docent was thoroughly charming, and eager to discuss Islam. Setting Farangs straight, as well as Buddhists, Confucians, Hindus and so on, is part of why she’s there. We had a long, and for me, entertaining talk. Q: “Why do women wear head-dresses but men aren’t required to?” A: “A symbol of purity. Besides, whenever I enter Christian churches I always see Mary wearing a hijab, but never see Jesus required to.” Q; “Why don’t women here and in Malaysia and Indonesia wear full burqas, as they do in Afghanistan?” A. “Strictly self-preservation; for Malays, smiling is a huge part of our culture; why, if we couldn’t smile at one another, we’d all die.” That sort of thing. She was impressively good with her banter, with a witty and thoroughly reasonable answer for my every question.

So, you get impressive architecture, an important slice of Singapore history, and a warm welcome, all in one package. True, you don’t get either shopping or dining opportunities, but from where the Sultan Mosque is situated, it’s impossible to get out of Kampong Glam without walking past dozens of those, as well.

p.s. TA asked questions after I completed this. I answered ""yes"" to this attraction requiring ""formal attire"", but that means what I've stated before; if you try to enter with a backless evening gown and a single strand of pearls, you won't be allowed in. TA also asked whether this would be a good hot day, or cold day activity. Temperatures are always tropical here, 365 days a year, so I answered yes to both of them, BUT the better question would have been ""is this a good rainy day activity?"" and the answer to that question is NO: if there's a monsoon downpour go to the National, Art, or Asian Civilizations museums instead; wait for a sunny day to see the dome of the mosque."
,,Nice view,5.0,,In the middle of Kampong glam is the mosque which you can enter as well. I sadly couldn’t cover my knees so I couldn’t enter. But from the outside it’s nice as well!
,,One of the most important Masjid in Singapore,5.0,,"The Sultan Masjid is one of the most important Muslim prayers areas in Singapore and it makes an interesting place to visit as well. Before visiting Its worth reading up a bit on the historical role of this masjid played in Singapore's early days and history.

Entrance is totally free and you can take pictures inside. there is no audio guides provided by the management, However, local visitors are are available as a good source of information. Visits can be done in 10-15 minutes, making the mosque well worth visiting if you plan to spend some time in this area of the city. The interior area of the Masjid that can be visited is decorated in simple manner. The exterior of the masjid is quite attractive.

In addition to visiting the Sultan Mosque, its worth spending a bit of time walking up and down Arab St most popular for Halal Food got wide range of Turkish, Labnese, Arab and many more and nearby Haji Lane where you can got coffee with your picture while you are in this area."
,,Worth visiting this magnificent mosque,5.0,,This beautiful mosque is right near Arab Street and is well worth a visit. The architecture is outstanding and the grand hall is very interesting to see. Remember to dress appropriately when visiting this site.
,,Former Royal Mosque now gazetted as a National monument,4.0,,"What a striking vision it was to see this beautiful building wedged between a row of colonial styled townhouses with a backdrop of modern skyscrappers in the distance. It was the two large, golden onion-shaped domes on top of the Mosque which first caught my eye while out on an evening stroll for dinner in Kampong Glam. The Mosque was completed in 1928, formerly the royal mosque of the Sultan of Johor, it is well maintained and since 1975 has been listed as a national monument."
,,Beautiful and peaceful,4.0,,"As a non-muslim you can't visit everything, but you can see the central hall, which is beatuful and peaceful. If you aren't ""properly"" dressed a friendly man will lend you a skirt or more to cover yourself in. Didn't seem to insist on women covering their hair."
,,Large mosque in town,3.0,,"This is a large mosque in town. We stopped by here on a city tour. Didn’t go inside, but depending on where you are, you can get some good pictures of the Mosque from the outside"

There is no entrance fee to the mosque.

If you are not properly covered,the mosque will provide some clothes for you to put on to cover yourself.Best is to come in shirt(must have sleeve) and long pants."
,,Biggest Mosque in Singapore,4.0,,"Very nice mosque! It’s worth seeing, you can enter if dressed appropriately. Worth walking around it to see the cool architecture."

*walk to bugis street / Suntec city for shopping
*walk to albert market for local food"
,,Tranquil in the City,4.0,,"Several times coming into Singapore, this is the first time I've chance to enter the mosque. Unlike big awesome mosque I've normally visit in many ASEAN big cities, Masjid Sultan is quite modest in size and design. In spite of its size, this mosque is quite active with many communal activity offered either to the residents or visitors. Its interior and surrounding also clean and comfortable, suits it purpose as place of worship."
,,Boring. Nothing special.,1.0,,"Maybe I am just a bit biased but there isn’t anything special about this mosque. It is big and I will give it that. Also it is very cool that this mosque is in Singapore because it is one of the only places in the world that people of all religion live in harmony. However coming from Iran where there are many beautiful mosques, I don’t recommend people even visit this place. It’s just a basic mosque that you can really even go into the prayer area or explore around. They only allow you to see what they want you to see.

From the outside it’s a beautiful mosque though. So you should visit it there."
,,"it was a short visit , the Masjid is Clean",5.0,,"You may take pray in sultan masjid. Its comfortable place. Just 1 hour of visit is enough. You may take a shoot in the place. Use appropriate clothes, due its a masjid."
,,Centerpiece of Singapore's Muslim community,4.0,,They say that this mosque is the focal point of Singapore's muslim community located in the historic Kampong Glam area.

,,Beautiful Mosque,4.0,,"This is a beautiful mosque in Singapore.

The mosque is named after Sultan Hussein Shah. He started construction of this mosque in 1824. It is now a national monument.

The mosque has a capacity for 5,000 worshippers.

As this is a holy place, visitors need to be appropriately dressed. If you are not appropriately dressed, you will be given a robe to cover yourself. You need to take your shoes off when you enter the mosque.

There is a small section where you can get facts about the Islamic religion."
,,Not too much to see,3.0,,There isn’t much special about this mosque - the dome is pretty but not much else to see or learn. Don’t go our of your way to visit.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,One of my favourite location to visit. I even have a chance to pray here. Inside view is as amazing as the outside view
,,Beautiful. A must!,5.0,,"Stunning architecture and very interesting.

,,Praise Allah,4.0,,"The mosque was built for Sultan Hussein Shah, the first sultan of Singapore early in the 19th century and completely renovated one century later. It is located in the heart of the Malayan Kampong Glam area. It is the main Islamic center in Singapore and by far the most beautiful mosque in the multi-ethnic little country. It also has a great center for Islamic studies. Even non Muslims will enjoy the great architecture of the mosque with its beautiful onion shaped golden dome."

,,Nice interior with a touch of modernisation,5.0,,"The size of the main hall is spacious. Before entering, we need to remove our shoes and for anyone with sleeveless top or shorts, the staffs provide a coat and wrap skirt to cover ourselves to uphold the upmost respect in the mosque."
,,Historical and Tranquil,4.0,,"Going to places of worship always give people the feeling of peace and tranquility. Sultan Mosque, built in 1824, is one of the largest mosque in Singapore.

To get to this mosque, you have the option of taking a bus or the MRT. I would recommend taking the MRT as it is the fastest, yet comfortable mode of transport. Assuming you are staying in Orchard, take the train from Orchard MRT and change train at City Hall (to the East-West green line) - which is across the platform. It is just one station from City Hall MRT station. When you reach Bugis Mrt, there will be signage and map to guide you. Do remember to bring an umbrella when you are going there as it can either shelter you from the sun or rain.

One other draw point of this mosque is not only is it conveniently located in the heart of Singapore and there are many good eateries, especially halal certified restaurants in the vicinity. There are many different kinds of cuisine that are halal certified, namely, Chinese, Middle East and Malay to name a few.

If you are visiting Singapore, please remember to add this as one of the places of interests to visit."
,,Beautiful mosque in Arab street. .,4.0,,"CYC+CG ( 18.07.15 )

,,Must visit oldest mosque 🕌 whenever in Singapore 🇸🇬,4.0,,"Highly recommended ~ It’s the oldest mosque in Singapore

Due to time limit & closing time, I didn’t managed to wear the robe prepared at entrance to visit this mosque during my recent trip

Love its unique architecture, it’s beautiful ‼

Only a photo at its main entrance, will be back again in my next trip

Read my travel blogging ‍& many lifestyle sharing, blog link at profile ☺️"
,,The most ancient monument of Singapore,3.0,,"I had some hours to spend in a morning in Singapore and took my guide. It suggested a visit to the Sultan Mosquee as the most ancient building in town.

I went there by.taxi and visited the Malay heritage center (just aside), the Mosquee and the colored roads around. Had a fruit juice and than the storm arrived.

So I put myself in a breakfast bar to eat some local dishes."
,,Basic but Free!,3.0,,The Sultan Mosque is basic. It is free to enter. It is near out hotel Santa Grand. We spent about 15 minutes inside. The architecture is OK. The area outside is good for tourists.
,,Lovely Architecture,4.0,,The Sultan mosque is a place of worship and quite beautiful. The surrounding area is really coming up well and in general its a nice place to walk around and learn about the area.
,,Simply Stunning,5.0,,What a beautiful mosque near Arab Street or Haji Lane. The golden dome stands out a mile. Great structure.
,,Nice Mosque,5.0,,"This Mosque near our hotel in India's town, only 5 minutes walking there. nice and peace mosque, huge gold dome. Many people come there to pray, it is near Arab street. We tried to go inside but do not have chance because it was closed. Highly recommend for first time visitor."
,,Peace even in busy,5.0,,"We visited this mosque on March 30, 2018. It is excited to meet with the religious community. The wise khatib conveying the sermon besides suppressing the concept of progress without sympathy is not in the effort to reprimand alms beggars."
,,If you only visit one mosque...,5.0,,"If you only visit one mosque; this is the one! Huge, oversized gold dome, soaring minerets, simple but massive architecture. Sometimes you can't enter because it's prayer time, but these regulars are remarkably patient considering the throngs of sight-seers & photo snappers stomping around gawking... Try to make the locals' lives a bit easier by dressing appropriately (ladies should have a scarf around their shoulders or on their head), taking off shoes & socks, respecting distances, limiting your photo-taking, remaining silent or keep chat down to a whisper, have $1 at the ready for the donation box, etc.
If you want to try murtabak (the Indians' answer to a savoury crepe... but much bigger!), the best murtabak restaurant ($4 - $6) is Zam Zam's.

Beautiful on the outside and even more so on the inside - the sheer size of the Mosque is unbelievable. You have to cover up to go in - they lend you the necessary clothes free of charge.

,,Must visit,5.0,,"The mosque is off Arab Street and is close to Turkish restaurants. The gold minarets are incredible and superseded by the internal décor which is just mind-blowing. Easy access all the time if you are Muslims, otherwise visiting times are limited for non-Muslims."
,,Limited access for non Muslims,3.0,,"Having visited Masjid Negara in Kuala Lumpur last year, I was expecting something similar. There is no doubt that the main hall is stunning, but apart from looking at it from outside, and restricted side views, there is not much access. having spent over an our in the KL mosque, Sultan Mosque took little more than 15 minutes to see everything.

Clothes are provided for those unsuitably attired, though head cover is not required."

,,Heart of Muslim community in Singapore,5.0,,"As the name suggests, this mosque was built for the Sultan of Singapore. Communities in the olden days stay together within a locality and the Malay/Muslim community congregate where the Sultan resides. Within the vicinity of the mosque you would find the Sultan's palace called Istana Kampung Glam and the Malay Heritage Centre. The area surrounding it have succumbed to commercialisation unfortunately, leaving very little trace of the ethnic origin of this area.

As for the mosque, it is well maintained and very much operational despite being almost 100 years old. I was here twice - once for a Friday prayer during a business trip and another visiting with family."
,,Very interesting,5.0,,"Very interesting Mosque, men have to were a Sarong (provided at the entrance) and women have to cover up with a Cuftan (also provided at the entrance).

,,Beautiful traditional architecture,3.0,,"My rating is because I have not been inside the mosque. When I was three times and the timing was always closed.

,,A true Malay / Arab experience in the heart of Singapore,4.0,,"Both the mosque and the surroundings are a must-see. Multiple visits to Singapore and we finally made it.

,,"Worth a stop, even if you can only see it from the outside",5.0,,"A very grand and historic mosque, undoubtedly one of the best in Southeast Asia. Even if you can't tour the inside, it's still a treat to view it from the outside around Kampong Glam - especially from that one pedestrian street/square near Baghdad Street where palm trees line both sides of the path leading up to the mosque's facade. The mosque's overall design scheme is very impressive. At first glance I thought it looked a bit Turkish or Ottoman-inspired but it was actually built in the Indo-Saracenic Revival style. The mosque and its surrounds are definitely a great place to soak up the atmosphere and vibes of old Singapore."
,,Wonderfull mosque,5.0,,Biggest Mosque in sigapore . İt built by johor sultan 1907. so beautifull Mosque Different atmosfer wonderfull architect i advice if you go to singapore deffenetly must see location adress in arabstreet

,,Impressive architecture,4.0,,"This mosque has a large gold dome that is visible from a distance. The various buildings that comprise the mosque complex are also quite photogenic. Inside the large prayer hall is only accessible to Muslims, but you can get a decent view just from the entrance. And to capture the sheer size of the hall, you really need an ultra wide angle lens. I wore shorts that covered my knees but they are not good enough to enter the compound. They do provide sarongs that you can wear while you visit the place. In the surrounding neighborhood, the buildings have exotic architecture with an Arabic touch and provide great photo opportunities. It is definitely well worth the visit."

,,Good cultural experice,5.0,,"There was a service/prayer in session, so I didn’t get to visit the inside of the mosque. The architecture itself is just majestic. The golden dome reflects the sunshine on a sunny day.

There are many shops and pubs around the mosque. I really liked the Singaporean style skirts and dresses and shopped for a few for myself. Good pub scene at night, though I didn’t get to grab any drink during my visit.

The mosque structure is very beautiful and you can't miss the golden dome that sets it out. There is also a massive prayer hall inside.

,,oldest mosque of singapore,5.0,,"The mosque is the oldest mosque of singapore. I went there on my own. Nearest MRT is bugis and then you will need to ask for direction for some locals. Ask for arab street.

Once in the area, you will notice narrow lanes, lined with small shops selling soveniurs, and restaurants offering halal food, sheesha and barbecue.

The lanes leading to the mosque are narrow but not crowded or dirty.

The mosque has visiting hours for non muslims, however muslims can visit at ease.

The mosque is well built with a decent capacity.
If you are not in proper attire to visit the mosquem, then its not a problem. The mosque people will provide you gowns to cover your body, so you can visit the mosque."
,,Historically significant site,3.0,,"Located in the traditional Malay area of Kampong Glam, the mosque of course carries a lot of historic significance. For that alone one must pay a visit and ideally take a guided tour to understand Muslims' history in Singapore as much as the history of this place of worship. However, those in search of architecture should know that its an old mosque in a dense area that has been rehabilitated well.

Make sure you're aware of prayer times so that you can avoid not being allowed inside the mosque. While visiting the mosque, enjoy the narrow streets around it, including Haji Lane and Arab Street, to soak in the culture."

,,Easter egg hunt.,3.0,,"Honestly, this is a nice mosque. Some Singaporeans also see it as a symbol: ain't we all living together in harmony. Others see it as nonsense opium. If you look at the golden dome, you will see the Easter egg that most miss: the dome is sitting on what appears to be round, black, glass tiles. They are not tiles. They are the bottoms of soy sauce and ketchup manis bottles. The bottles were collected from villages all around the country when the mosque was begging and borrowing to acquire materials.

I would recommend visiting if you are in the area, or you have never been to a mosque. Don't go out of your way for this."
,,Unfortunately not allowed inside,3.0,,"There are specific operating hours,so be informed before you go. We didn't allowed to go inside but doesn't matter because there are not too much to see. The nearest mrt station to go there is bugis"

,,Closed for prayers,4.0,,A magnificent immaculately decorated Mosque central to the Arab quarter a small area of original dwellings housing many varied shops and excellent halal restaurants – sadly we could not visit inside as we were there on a special prayer day (22nd) and it was closed to the public – I strongly recommend that you inquire in advance about visiting hours as the inside is said to be stunning – an extra for us however was the presence of a wonderfully aromatic food bazaar in the side street alongside the Mosque selling yummy street food
,,nice and interesting,5.0,,very nice monument in Singapore. You have to obay the religious rules and then you can visit it. It is very big
,,Mystery,4.0,,"This temple is a mystery place, that not always open to public. But there are some restaurants and souvenir shops outside the temple"
,,An Interesting Experience,5.0,,"To visit a mosque if one is not a Muslim, is a privilege indeed, granted by those in authority at the mosque to invite those of other faiths and non-believers to look at their place of worship, and in turn their heritage.

I have lived in Singapore many years but not seen the inside of a mosque, but decided to take a look having had lunch in one of the numerous Arabic restaurants nearby.

There is a good educational display at this mosque which tells about Islam and the life of a Muslim. I am surprised to see many quotes by the Prince of Wales on the betterment of life backed up by Muslim doctrine. Think how your dressed before you enter - otherwise others may think for you and offer you suitable covering clothing.

A big thank you for giving me an inside look into your religious life. Some pamphlets are available to take away. Best time to visit 2-4pm."
,,Great,5.0,,"We didn't realise we could actually go inside this beautiful building until we read it on this page! Our hotel room overlooked the mosque, so we could hear the call to prayer at regular intervals. Sounded beautiful."

,,A spiritual experience,5.0,,"Mosques are a spiritual place and are beyond comparison. The first and foremost thing to do here is praying. All other parts are optional. Even though it is not possible to ignore the aesthetics in anyway. I prayed a few times there and I was spiritually touched. The Imams there recites the Quran with a lot of devition I feel and it helps in being more devoted in prayers. This is a very big mosque with grand architecture. This is the only place I have seen in Singapore where Azaan is made through the mic and covers the surrounding area. One thing that I found astonishing was that as I was approaching the mosque for Maghrib prayers, the sound of prayer was heard from a bit far outside. This is something I have never heard before."
,,Divine,5.0,,Very good architecture outside and in. Went to pray it was really peaceful and comfortable. In an area with lots of traditional buildings. Loads of options to eat or have a light snack.

,,Beautiful mosque inside and out,5.0,,"Although Mosques in general are open to all (with respectful attire), this mosque seems tailored to tourists with signage indicating prayers are ongoing and displays explaining the mosque and Muslim beliefs inside. The adjacent Arab street attractions and Malay heritage center encompass the former Sultan's royal complex. The mosque is regarded as a sign of the multicultural identity and origin of Singapore and Muslims and other ethnicities have helped in its upkeep and restoration in the past, including the dome that features glass bottles donated by the poor."
,,a very good photo point,4.0,,a beautiful mosque worth visiting..the surrounding area is nice to stroll and to take plenty of pics..visit the malay garden next to the mosque...
,,Beautiful !!,5.0,,"We intentionally stayed at ParkRoyal hotel on Beach Road to explore the area Kampong Glam.
Sultan Mosque is a very beautiful mosque at Arab Street one of the main attraction in this area all along it you find middle eastern food restaurants as well.

,,Unique gem,5.0,,The architectural features of this mosque were very interesrting to take in as were the customs observed there. The lighting at night made this attraction even more intriguing. Local worshippers were more than happy to elaborate on anything to do with the mosque.
,,Awesome short stop,4.0,,"We visited the Arab St. area on our last day in Singapore.
A visit to Singapore would not be complete without coming to Kampong Glam neighborhood.

Lots of small unique stores selling the traditional Kebaya, hand blown glass perfume bottles, and of course the usual souvenir shops.
Also lots and lots of restaurants offering halal type of food, Lebanese and Turkish food.

The highlight of this area is the grand Sultan Mosque, an terrific Muslim architecture in the midst of peranakan architecture."
,,"We mostly prayed here, every time we visit Singapore.",5.0,,"In Singapore, is very hard to find a place to do a prayer/salah. So this is where we mostly pray when we are in Singapore. Because as we know this Masjid is the closest accessible Masjid from many main destinations in Singapore."
,,Historical Mosque,4.0,,"This is a good place to get a good understanding of the Islamic faith in Singapore. There are curated tours. Singapore is one of the few places in the world where one could visit a Muslin mosque, a Buddhist temple, a Hindu Shrine, a Taoist temple and a church all in a day and within walking distance."
,,Lovely exterior but noisy,3.0,,"You can't miss this place when you're in Kampong Glam. There was a festival on, so it was very bustling and busy with Ramdan activities outside the Mosque. Beautiful architechture building. Please respect the people who pray here."
,,something nice to see,3.0,,"When you have a guide, you hear a little about the history and that makes it more interesting. Otherwise, just a stop on you tour of the city."
,,"Good, but not as spectacular as some of the other mosques around the world",3.0,,"This is okay....may be good, but surely not as good/grand as some other mosques. It may have significance as an icon of Muslim history in Singapore (with all its history and the fact that it was originally built more than 100 years ago), but for others, it is not exactly a must see. The area around is quite interesting......Arab street etc....."
,,Set aside 2 hours to see this as well as the wonderful tiny streets around it.,4.0,,"This is the highlight of a visit to the Kampong Glam district of Singapore. Get out of your taxi and spend at least 2 hours walking the tiny streets here (Arab Street, Haji Lane, etc.) which are cute pedestrian lanes. Yes, many of the shops are touristy, but it's still colorful and cute. There are many wonderful places to get a meal or a beer (keep in mind the Muslim restaurants do not serve alcohol). The mosque itself is large and they welcome anyone to come inside, you just remove your shoes at the front door, and ladies need to cover shoulders legs etc. We enjoyed an interesting intro to the mosque by a nice man who works there and kindly explained the traditions. There are also several well-curated exhibits and diagrams along the wall that explain the Muslim faith. We felt very welcome there and are glad we went."
,,The Golden Dome,4.0,,"Though the mosque is not especially old or traditional and was designed by an Irish architect, the view of the white minarets and the imposing golden dome are really suggestive - and to Western eyes very much Arab fairytale.
The main access is from the busy Bussorah Street, all tourist shops and palms but if you like the building I recommend you walk around the area and the side street to get interesting views and good photo ops."

,,"My visit to the Sultan Mosque, Singapore",4.0,,"As a Muslim, I will usually find time to visit & pray at this old, yet modern, clean, traditionally built Sultan Mosque. It has been recently upgraded, painted with a new coat of paint. The Sultan Mosque is situated, smack right in the centre of busy Singapore city, at Sultan Street. Muslims from all walks of life, who work or live nearby will have the added advantage to be able to perform their religious obligations daily, here. The surrounding areas of the Sultan Mosque has a vibrant, local and cosmopolitan vibe.
There are exotic restaurants, serving delightful Turkish, Arabic, and Indian Muslim cuisines. The nearby side streets host colorful shops selling Middle eastern or local traditional Malay clothes, scarves, handmade jewelleries, Islamic prayer caps and prayer mats, men's chapals (leather slippers), colorful sarongs, and much more that I can name. There's also a traffic-free mall right in front of Sultan Mosque, in between two other shop buildings where one can people watch, or sip coffee sitting at the numerous modern cafes nearby. During selected evenings, there are groups who will perform traditional drums, or showcase traditional forms of dances. The attractive evening ambiance serves as a warm welcome to anyone who visits."

,,Absolutely Charming...,5.0,,"Sultan Mosque is located at Kampong Glam, Songapore, where cross-cultural environments are so apparent (Malay, Middle Eastern, India, and Arabic).

Kampung Glam itself is very famous for both locals and foreigners. Its kampong-like surroundings attract people to wander around, making it one of Singapore's top tourist destinations.

It's really a contrast as compared to other modern parts of Singapore, worth-experiencing therefore.

Sultan Mosque is actualy a part of Singapore's Royal House. They were both constructed by British colonial power in around circa 1824 for the Sultan allowed it to build a trading outpost in Singapore.

The mosque surroundings are very attracted, dotted with vintage Malay buildings and mysterious alleys, where people sit in and eat at, relaxing, especially during weekends.

Tourists mostly from China, Japan, South Korea, European countries, and Indonesia flock the mosque, whose architecture is so unique and charming.

Cars are prohibited to pass by, hence making it really safe for children to roam free.

Restaurants of all sorts are abundantly available. The most popular among other are Hj. Maemunah Malay restaurant and Derwish Turkish restaurant.

Overall rating is 5/5, worth visiting."
,,Cool to visit a Malay / Muslim Religious cultural Place,3.0,,"Interesting to visiting Masjid Sultan.

There are days that the Mosque welcome visitors to visit into the worship hall (designated area). Remember to follow their rule for dress code and conduct. The Mosque would provide suitable covering scarf for visitors. Shoes off in the Mosque hall."
,,Beautiful mosque and nice surroundings,4.0,,"Went for a tour around the most typical sightseeing places in Singapore and this area was one of the stops.

The area around the Mosque has tons of nice cafes and trendy little shops. One of my favorite parts of the city.
,,Have to visit,4.0,,"First established almost 200 yrs ago near Sultan of Singapore's palace. Surrounded by old 2 storey buildings which are protected for its historical value. Not many places like this in Singapore so i recommend you visit. You can enter the mosque outside of prayer times. If you are not decently dressed, the mosque has sarongs you can put on before being allowed in. Hearing the call to prayer is interesting. Some say it gives them an effect just being there hearing it. The interior is calming and cooled by fans. You should also stroll to the old palace and a small museum. 1-2 hours is sufficient for you to get an idea of how Singapore was like in those times. Its a bit commercialized with the many shops selling souvenirs and a variety of ethnic mid eastern food and products."
,,Beautiful view with some great food,5.0,,Absolutely beautiful. It transported us into another world and we are very happy to have taken time to stop here. The walk to the mosque is along a narrow road surrounded by Arab/Lebanese food restaurants. We tried to sample as much food as possible in the little time we had and took some takeaways and I am happy to say it was all delicious.
,,Beautiful building surrounded by great restaurants and markets,4.0,,"We are glad we stopped here and strolled the streets, sampling take away food from the market stalls set up that day. The outside of the mosque is very beautiful however we didn't have an opportunity to go inside."

Passed this renowned Sultan Mosque. Did not realize that visitors are allowed inside during certain visiting hours.

Not to worry if you are not properly attired as you can borrow their outer coverings at the entrance so you can enter to take a look."
,,Beautiful,5.0,,"I'll start by saying that I only visited outside. Unfortunately I kept missing their small windows of time that visitors are allowed in.
What I can say, is that the call to prayer is something everyone should hear. Everything goes quiet when it starts. Shops turn their music off, people stop talking, birds hush, and everything just stops to listen. It's impossible not to! It's such a spiritual experience. Do yourself a favour and loom up the call to prayer times. You can hear it from a distance, but it's not the same as being right there in front of the Mosque, hearing and feeling the full effect."
,,Impressive mosque,3.0,,"This is an impressive mosque with golden domes and minarets located in Kampong Glam. Recently restored, it is open to the public. Look close at the glass onion dome base.

,,Peaceful place for meditation,5.0,,"A beautiful mosque open to the public. A great display of a brief introduction to Islam. The prayer hall can be viewed from behind the railing, but very open for observation. Shoes must be removed before entering, a nice place to rest and become one with God!"
,,Pretty gold domed mosque,4.0,,"You can get some nice outdoor photos, but you're limited inside due to cultural reasons. Sporadic hours so check before you go. It's worth a look inside, but it will be a short visit. Men and women will be given a robe to cover if legs (i.e. wearing shorts) or shoulders (i.e. Tank top) are exposed. People were very nice and provided info on the history of this 2nd oldest Mosque in Singapore."
,,Beautiful Mosque,3.0,,This Mosque is located close to Haji Lane and Arab Street offering many shops and eateries...plus photo ops. I was not able to go inside the mosque but walked all the way around to get pictures from all angles. It truly is beautiful.

It was just beside of Arab Street; all we have to is walk for 5 minutes.
The gate of the mosque was not open by the guards; so we couldn’t able to discover much. May be for the Ramada, it was not so easy for them to entertain visitor in such early morning. May be next time we will have a visit inside the Mosque for a deeper discovery.

Street shops at the mosque gate was cheaper."
,,Interesting,4.0,,"I think it's an interesting site to visit in a great little part of town. The mosque is pretty. There is limited access to it however we went on a Friday afternoon after the prayers and people were still praying in the mosque.

We were allowed to take photos and wander about. There are several people who welcome and assist visitors at the Mosque and one took our photo for us. This is the second Mosque I have ever been into and it was well worth the visit.
,,Great experience,5.0,,"I was keen to visit the mosque and was really pleased we did. Couple of points:
1) check when it is open. It is sometimes unavailable to the public due to prayer meetings.
2) be willing to dress appropriately. Ie. you will need to remove your shoes, and you will be asked to wear a cover garment

Non-Muslims are allowed inside the building, but not inside the main prayer hall. Inside the foyer there are some interesting information boards about the Islamic religion, and of the Muslims in Singapore."

o It becomes the center of the whole Arab street. I would say, it is a highlight of that street for me.
o Serenity is what you will experience.
x Limited access for non-Muslims. (It is their holy place, do respect their rules - no complaints.)
Be grateful cuz they are gracious to let you enter!
x Rather small, literally one round to finish your visit.
i. Visiting time is 1400-1600 (forgot what is the morning time slot). I went beyond 1600 so I missed the chance to enter their sanctuary because they have a service coming up.
ii. Within the visiting time frame, tourists can access through designated entrance."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Absolutely amazing. Night sight is terrifying. During the day there is not much people around there but during the evening people come around and all the apps and restaurants open.

,,Beautiful Mosque,4.0,,"You cannot miss this imposing Mosque with it's golden dome if you're in Arab street. Very nice from outside. It is free for visiting, but when we were it was Friday praying time so we couldn't enter. Few good restaurants with Arabic food across it."
,,Must visit for all tourists,4.0,,"This mosque is beautiful both inside and out and is definitely worth a visit.

,,Historically Unique,5.0,,"Like most old mosques, Sultan Mosque has its own history, arts and design and also its own character. Worth to pay a visit."
,,Tranquil,4.0,,"Any mosque, in my opinion, is a worthwhile place to visit and see a different way of living. Take a few calming moments to enjoy the architecture and ambience - just don't go wearing short shorts, bikinis etc because you will be denied entry or be asked and expected to cover yourself up - gowns/covers are provided. Videoing of the premises wasn't allowed on the day I visited but the taking of pictures was very welcomed."
,,Outing in the morning,5.0,,"A really interesting outing since non Muslims are often not allowed in mosques. Internally the building is beautifully decorated with some ornate pieces. Externally it is quite an imposing structure as well. The only restrictions are that you are appropriately dressed (they will provide clothes if necessary), you must remove your shoes before entering and you are not allowed in the prayer hall. An interesting experience."
,,Beautiful Mosque in Arab Street,4.0,,"The Sultan Mosque is an interesting place of worship in Arab Street. It has striking architecture with mosaic work and gold finishes.

,,Great visit,5.0,,I was allowed inside the temple and to pray. It is beautiful outside and I took pictures from inside looking down at Arab street.

This Mosque has adequate facilities and air-conditioned. Unfortunately there is no special room for nursing. So nursing can only done on the second floor, place for women praying . In front of the mosque, there is a stall that sell fresh coconut. Very refreshing. There are also souvenir shops."
,,Historical Building with Stories,4.0,,One of the oldest mosque in Singapore. It's near Arab street where many nice crafting items can be found. Spending a day there might also means having some nice Muslim food from Coffee shops like Zam Zam.

,,Largest mosque in Singapore.. the Golden dome is the land mark..,5.0,,"If you are wondering in the Arab quarter, you will notice the Golden dome, very attractive..If you are interested in Mosques, I would recommend, that you go to An Nahdhah mosque (Bishan). Get the MRT to Bishan station, ask about Bishan Stadium, the mosque is right next to it. The mosque is connected to its Harmony center, that center is doing the effort to get all the religions in a peaceful Harmony..The idea is great, you will know a brief ( in posters ) about the main 10 religions in the world . If you are interested in the subject, we highly recommend a visit."
,,Impressive Mosque in the Arab quarter of Singapore,4.0,,Largest mosque in the city situated at the bottom of Arab Street and near the Malay Heritage centre. Dates back to the 1920s. It was prayer time so we looked from outside. Impressive building.

,,Currently closed for renovations,1.0,,"To this beautiful mosque usually all are welcome to visit (except for prayers) - but currently it is closed for renovations (with no reopening date being displayed). Still a nice view from the outside, but no historic building and also quite simple from the inside."
,,Beautiful minus the Renovations,3.0,,"If you really wanted to get a taste of all the cultures that Singapore has to offer you must visit the Sultan Mosque. It presents an Arab designed mosque in a predominantly Chinese population. Yet, this brings out the historical Malay Muslim culture, which predates the Chinese population of today. The interior and the ablution area are designed aesthetically pleasing and the inside is full of prayer space for worshipping Muslims. It was nice to see a mosque in this diverse city-state. It was a disappointment that I had to imagine the part of the mosque covered by scaffolding as it appears beautiful. It's not too big, but it is an essential part of Singapore's historical culture."
,,Biggest Mosque in Singapore. wonderful!!,5.0,,"You are Muslim, you must visit this place. We'll find all Muslim in Singapore here. Nice to meet with other in the different and wonderful place especially this mosque (home of God)."

Unfortunately on side was covered in scaffolding and tarps when we visited so no good photos but if you in or near Muscat Street check out the amazing building. Like all places of worship you should dress appropriately, my daughter and I covered our heads and wore long sleeves and trousers."
,,Closed for Entrance,2.0,,Building work is going on at the moment and so you are unable to enter the Mosque and some photos are not too good as you get building works in photos.
,,An expeience in Prayers,5.0,,A Mecca for the faithful . The golden shiny dome of the mosque and the surrounding area of Arab street is best on the Friday . Ladies allowed inside with heads covered .
,,Historical Mosque,5.0,,historical mosque in Singapore. classic view and a very nice old building that keep maintained. A must go especially for muslim if you travel to Singapore
,,Clean and Calm place to pray,4.0,,I stopped there for prayers in the afternoon and I don't think this mosque is ever full. It'd big and looks old on the outside which is probably a deterrence but is nice and clean inside.
,,"Large, peaceful",4.0,,"It was under construction during our visit on a Friday afternoon, but we were still allowed entry. There is no cost, however, they accept donations. We removed our shoes, my husband was given a wrap/long skirt-type to wear and I was given a hooded robe (only needed to be buttoned to my waist) and my children did not need anything to cover with. You are obviously not allowed entrance to the main prayer room but it is beautiful, both inside and out. We also went during Ramadan and there was a street food festival at the entrance to the mosque. The doner kabob was amazing. It also has many cute shops and restaurants in the area. We didn't go to the mosque until the end of our visit and regretted that because the Bugis area has a lot of offer. The only thing I would recommend is seeing if a tour or something is available. I would have liked to hear more about the mosque and hadn't done proper research ahead of time."
,,Historic Mosque in Kampong Glam,4.0,,"This is a historic mosque in Kampong Glam.

Located close to Bugis, where there's an MRT station, and thereafter a short walk to the Mosque.

The inside of the mosque is off-limits to non-Muslims, except for the information centre, where you can learn more about the Islamic faith and also the history of the Mosque. Visitors (men and women) have to be suitably dressed to enter the information area. They do have robes to cover you up if you wish to enter. No footwear is allowed inside.

You can walk around the mosque and take photos of the exterior of the Mosque which are nice."
,,tranquilling,3.0,,The view of the mosque was amazing from outside right before the sun went down. Little shops and modest restaurants around the mosque are important parts of tranquilling streets'
,,Jewel in the rough,5.0,,A wonderfully charming and classic masjid in the heart of old Singapore. Prayed magrib prayers here and it has a wonderful vibe and atmosphere. May Allah preserve this wonderful heritage building.
,,Nice Architecture but front part was covered up for construction,4.0,,"I love walking through this area and see this wonderful structure. I could also see it from my room nearby and the mosque is lit up at night too. During Ramadan, you'll see the food stalls set up outside the mosque, waiting for sunset where the Muslims would end their daily fasting. I believe the stalls open at around 2pm. So, if you're in the area, drop by to try the food, they have a great variety. I got myself a lamb shawarma to go and eat in the quiet lounge at my hostel nearby. Don't wait till sunset as there will be a lot of people already."
,,went to mosque,5.0,,the mosque we went to was in malaysia and this was wonderful tour but hard getting on and off bus for passport crossing
,,Nice,4.0,,The sultan mosque is beautiful- at least the parts we were able to see since it was mainly under construction... Near Kampong Glam area.

the building is very pretty wonderful architecture
and a great introduction to Arab street
unfortunately the front had a lot of scaffolding at the front of the building doing some painting
walked around the side and back and saw more of the building and its wonderful architecture

put this on your list to visit"
,,Architecture,3.0,,"It is a nice mosque at least on the outside. We were not allowed inside because they were closed for prayers till 2:30pm. Sultan Mosque is under construction right now(May 2015) so it is very hard to take pretty pictures.
I think that it is worth seeing it when you are in the neighborhood (Arab Street & Bugis)."
,,Very welcoming,5.0,,Even though the mosque was undergoing renovation when I visited (in preparation for Singapore's anniversary) it was still beautiful. The hosts are extremely welcoming and will answer any questions. Incredibly peaceful prayer hall.
,,Great visit,5.0,,"First off, ask for a tour guide. They have volunteers who are just waiting around to talk to people. We sat with a guide for 45 minutes just in q&a. I learned so much about the Muslim religion and the place is beautiful."
,,Worth a visit!,4.0,,"If you've never been in a Mosque, the Sultan Mosque built in 1824 is worth a visit. The interior is very peaceful and simple in design."
,,A peaceful place in a busy city,4.0,,"The day I was here, there was obviously a lot happening with scaffold and the like all over the place. Inside, the mosque is a peaceful oasis in a busy city and it was beautiful. The gentleman on the door was friendly and helpful and the display interesting. I would love to see it again when it is finished."
,,Beautifull,4.0,,"This mosque located in the Arab Street, we have a chance to visit to this place and going inside. we attend religious lectures in mosques, they use malay language. This mosque is clean, and nice to visit in between your activity arround of Arab Street."
,,Being refurbished,3.0,,The city sightseeing HOHO stop is not far from Arab Street and the Sultan Mosque. Unfortunately it is undergoing refurbishment and had scaffold around it and no entry. Not sure when it will reopen.
,,It's currently under scaffold,3.0,,"Was really looking forward to visiting this mosque as I had heard about it's significance in Singapore.

Disappointed to find that it was under scaffold so the outside is not appealing at the moment. It was all closed up when we were there so unable to go inside.

I am sure that it would be nice to see once remodelling is complete."
,,One of Iconic Mosque in Singapore,4.0,,"When I was visiting Singapore. it was friday and as muslim I should go to mosque for jumuah praying. I decided to pray at this mosque. the environment was so good since it is near around arab street. I had religious experience when I visited and prayed at this Mosque.

One of Iconic spot in Singapore beside Merlion Park"
,,Under refurb,3.0,,"We were really looking forward to our visit to this mosque. We took the mrt to bugis, exit b then only a 5 min walk. It was a huge disappointment that when we got there we found the mosque to be under construction and there was no access to the inside when we were there. It did look like the mosque needed a paint and a little freshening up. It will be well worth a visit once the works have been completed."
,,"Very aggresive officials, skip visit and look for better, more interesting attractions",1.0,,"mosque was on the to-do list when visiting Singapore. When entering the mosque was about to close ( 12.00-14.00). Signs are placed naar the entrance. Mosque official (??) started to shout and gesture very aggresively forcing us to leave the entrance immediately. Man was unable to express himself other than shouting.
Despite this offensive reception, decided to visit the mosque after 14.00. Mosque is of below an average quality (architecture, decoration,). Not worthwile a visit."
,,Only Mosque in Singapore Open to Tourists,4.0,,"Our hotel is across the street from the Arab Street section of town. So we decided to visit and to see the mosque as communication is much easier in Singapore than other places to question and query about the do’s and don’ts.

The latest version of the mosque is less than 100 years old, so it’s not something at all ancient. (There is a placard across from the place talking about its history.) We arrived shortly before noon when they close for afternoon prayers. Nonetheless they welcomed us graciously and with an extremely friendly temperament.

We were appropriately dressed, but as mentioned in other reviews, gowns are available free of charge for those not dressed accordingly.

The docents were extremely hospitable and answered all questions. So we learned that this is the largest mosque in Singapore and the only one open to tourists. It is considered the National Mosque of Singapore. You can’t enter the main hall unless you are Muslim, but you can still see the beautiful and sedate architecture and lovely green color scheme (never seen this color before) inside. There are some information posters in the back to learn more about Islam. Unfortunately they have no information about this mosque in particular and only an information booklet about Islam, which is actually from Houston, Texas USA!

Currently the mosque is under remodeling and some of the outside building is covered in sheeting. Thus it was disheartening to see other visitors not even offering a S$1 as a donation to visit, for the upkeep, or to help defray the remodeling costs.

As a non-Muslim, you can see everything in ten minutes or so. More time is needed if you want to read the information posters or look at some of the “museum finds” in the back as you enter- look for the tiny Qur’an, for which you would need eagle eyes to read! And as has been mentioned, the area is filled with material (fabric) stores, carpet shops, general touristy shops, perfumeries (oils), and, of course, eating establishments.

If you are at all curious about mosques this is most recommended. But please leave a small donation as gratitude as you would in any house of worship."
,,Beautiful Mosque,4.0,,"The Sultan Mosque is an incredibly beautiful place, very serene and picturesque.
The interior has a brilliant design, great carpets and lights. If you are not dressed in clothing that covers the shoulders and knees you can borrow a robe at the entrance for free.
There is a lot of great information on Mosques, Prayer and Muslim life within the Mosque. We saw many families performing their daily prayers and a few other tourists having a look around/taking some photos.

Unfortunately there were renovations happening on the front facade of the mosque so we weren't able to view the front of the Mosque. But ultimately those renovations will improve the Mosque/help with the restoration."
,,It's not just a mosque..It's master piece.,5.0,,"Sultan Mosque was built on 1819 by Sultan Johor. There is different atmosphere between inside and outside. Inside mosque is a master piece. Amazing combination between middle east carpet with ancient decoration on the wall. There is no air conditioner inside, but you will not feel warm. Outside mosque are surrounded by many old and nice food and souvenirs stores, but its arranged neat and clean. You must try walking some blocks here about 15 minutes. You will find delicous and original turkish kebab and Indonesian nasi padang here. I see at Indonesian nasi padang restaurant write on the door since 1952, I taste the food and wooww it's same taste with original padang food at west sumatra, Indonesia.
If you are a moslem, try to do praying jumah here, and it will be a great experience."
,,Nice area with good eateries...,4.0,,"Went to Arab Street in Singapore and explored the streets around this mosque. It was a nice experience. There are lots of nice eateries, cafes, bakeries and pubs. It was fun to have some turkish coffee and eat some middle-eastern and indonesian food. Not all eateries looked that attractive. Also a nice place to look at some carpet shops and pick up a batik shirt!"
,,Masjid Sultan,5.0,,Masjid Sultan has a beautiful facade and you can take some really nice photo's in this area . You can enter the Mosque during specific times as a non Muslim but during prayer times it's open to Muslims only . Remember this is a place of worship . Inside there are some explanations about Islam . You must take off your shoes before entering and the Mosque provides scarves free of charge to cover yourself if needed .
,,A jewel off Arab Street,4.0,,"We had to do the Sultan Masjid and Arab Street to get the sense of the multi ethnicity of the island that has now practically all nationalities as residents and many who have become citizens over the years.

An impressive structure and the interiors also well decorated and maintained.
The facade on North Bridge Road was being renovated so it was covered, but the entrance to the mosque from Arab Street was operational. It is a place of worship, so appropriate dress code is expected of visitors and use of mobile phones and photography is restricted during prayer times.

The connecting Muscat street has murals depicting the Gulf state of Oman. The call to prayer by the muezzin is very soothing and inspiring.

Besides Arabic (Yemeni, Moroccan), Turkish and Indian restaurants in Kampong Glam, there are Malay and local cafes so you can have your pick.

We had lunch at a local restaurant named Zam Zam on North Bridge Road, famous for the local S. Asian rice - (biryani) and the Indianised version of Arabic cuisine (Mutabbaq) - folded stuffed (meat or chicken) pancake."
,,Sultan mousque,4.0,,We were nearby the sultan mosque... the stay at a hotel of NUVE. This mosque is so famous in singapore. The biggest mosque...
,,masjid sultan,4.0,,"old but well treated. though I was just passing by at that time but still this mosque is very ""interesting"" that made me want to stay for a while.

,,A must visit place,4.0,,Very impressive historical mosque from external to internal area and very clean. Ideal location especially for Muslims tourist to stop for praying and to find souvenirs and delicious foods nearby.
,,Beautiful Mosque,5.0,,"Even if you're not Muslim you should pay a visit to this mosque. When you walk inside you sort of get the feeling you are going back in time. The design of the building is unbelievable. You can see the gold dome on top from almost anywhere in the Arab Street area. The mosque is very grand and ornately decorated. But it's not the tacky ""over the top"" look like some mosques tend to be nowadays. Come for a visit or come for prayers. It's a wonderful experience. Especially after the Friday prayers are finished and you see all the men pouring outside. This is a must see place. Oh, and please be respectful of this place and don't disturb anyone inside if they are praying."
,,Great Staff,4.0,,"Located in the heart of Kampong Glam, this mosque is quite striking with its golden domes. The street leading to the mosque is lined with palm trees making for a great photo op. Inside, the main prayer hall is most grand with its numerous archways and green hued lighting. Sister Rozannah Mohammed was happy to give some historical background on the mosque and answered several questions I had relating to Islam. I was made to feel most welcome here."
,,Singapore's most scenic mosque,3.0,,This mosque is a highlight of the surrounding area and is probably the most attractive of the mosques in Singapore. Easily accessible from Bugis MRT.

,,Beautiful,5.0,,It is terrific to see this mosque and the views from the various angles especially as dusk turns into night. It is very moving to just listen as the chanting begins inside the Mosque. Do yourself a favor and sit an have lunch or dinner at one of the several restaurants that have outdoor dining facing the Mosque.
,,Nice to see,3.0,,Typical Muslim temple was nice to see the shops surrounding are very good. Was part of a tour and would of liked more time to shop as very cheap . The temple has limited access for women which if part of a tour feel that we should be equal that is why only given it 3 circles
,,"Beautiful mosque, inside and outside",5.0,,"Really nice architecture and beautiful inside as well. Located on Arab st, the surrounding streets have really nice Moroccan, Turkish and Lebanese food. Closest MRT stop is Bugis. The mosque and surrounding area are definitely worth a visit."
,,MashaAllah Fine Architecture,5.0,,"Singapore being a diversified culture and society have a number of prayer places for different religion followers. Being a Muslim, I was amazed by the beauty and architecture of thing small mosque at Arab Street. Spacious prayer hall and courteous staff there that help visitors to take a look around the Masjid and undertake prayer incase you are a Muslim."
,,By far the best Mosque to visit in Singapore.,4.0,,"I visited 3 Mosque's whilst in Singapore for a few days and the 'Sultan Mosque' located in the interesting Kampong Glam district is by far the best one to visit. Make sure you dress appropriately, that is not in shorts or vest tops. However, robes can be borrowed to cover-up if you are underdressed for Mosque tourism. Non-Muslims can not enter the Prayer Hall but you can walk around the edges.

The Sultan Mosques 'Onion Dome' and large prayer hall are fine examples of what a Mosque should be and the Saracenic build style includes Persian, Moorish and Turkish designs. Built in 1928 on the site of the original old mosque... Well worth a visit."
,,Biggest Mosque in Singapore,3.0,,"Visited this mosque , on 13 Oct 2014 , because its quite near to my hotel , at Bugis.
Reachable by foot from the nearest MRT station Bugis towards the North Bridge Road , cannot missed the sign.

,,Mosque with great history,4.0,,Sultan Mosque have been preserved well since the 18th century. It is an iconic landmark at Arab Steet or Kg Glam area.

,,Great Mosque,4.0,,This mosque is situated in the middle of Arab Street. You will find many people there and great restaurants. I dined there and enjoyed the view.
,,Mosque,3.0,,We have visited plenty of times the area around Sultan Mosque. The actual mosque looks quite pretty on the outside and to be honest we never had any attempts to visit the inside.
,,Beautiful and serene,5.0,,"Although this mosque may not not aesthetically pleasing to the eye as others its beauty lies in its simplicity, its beautiful gold dome and its rich history. There is a feeling of great serenity and tranquility to be found here which is not always found in 'bigger and grander' mosques. There are fans to be found in the mosque and not the modern ac but we absolutely loved it.

We visited several times and were overwhelmed by its sense of peace and humility, its welcoming air to all, a reflection of its humble origins in the 19th century.

Literally opposite the mosque are several eating places which appear to be very popular and price friendly."
,,Beautiful....,4.0,,"One of the biggest and most amazing religious structures in Singapore which is very impressive. The huge Golden Dome is notable.
Its one of the must visit attraction here.
If you would like to visit inside you may have to look for the visiting hours. They do have some restrictions.
you get lots of halal restaurants nearby to hog delicious food."
,,Fantastic cultural site,4.0,,We respectfully visited this working Mosque and enjoyed the experience. Upon arrival my partner was asked to cover herself with a robe which was provided by the Mosque. This historic Mosque is worth visiting and the scripture contained within it is very interesting.
,,Old Singapore Heritage,5.0,,"In a city which is so famously modern, the Sultan Mosque provides a wonderful look at old Singapore. Originally built in 1824 in the heart of the Malay / Muslim part of town called Kampong Glam. The mosque was enlarged to this gold domed version in 1926. It is possible to visit between 10-12 and 2-4. Inside is rather sparse, just pale green walls and lots of ceiling fans. You aren't allowed to walk on any carpeted areas.
The mosque sits within a network of very peaceful and picturesque lanes with exotic names such as Muscat St & Kandahar St. Pedestrianised Bussorah St lined with palm trees leads directly to the mosque. Nearest MRT station is Bugis."
,,Friday Praying,5.0,,i was there to do Fiday Praying (praying for men). This mosque is majestic as it's one of heritage places in Singapore. What a unique from this mosque is that the khotbah (speech) is delivered in Malay instead of English. In from of this mosque you can find some Indian/Malay restaurants with great price and taste.
,,Nothing spectacular,3.0,,"From a purely asthetic point of view there are far more interesting temples/mosques/churches to be seen in Singapore. The area around Sultan Mosque is definitely worth a visit so you might want to pop in if you're in the area anyway (you'll be given a robe to wear if you have shorts on) and the staff were certainly welcoming but once inside it's a fairly unimpressive building, certainly anyone who has visited a mosque in Turkey etc will have experienced far more interesting and visually exciting mosques.

There are information boards inside the mosque describing the Muslim faith etc which frankly we felt were borderline propaganda and made us uncomfortable."
,,Not a lot to see,3.0,,"As it is often the case, you are not allow to enter the mosque with short trousers. The staff at the entrance will however provide you for free some ""appropriate"" clothing. Apparently, this regulation does not apply to people coming to prey, as I have seen several of them wearing short trousers...
Frankly, there is almost nothing interesting to see there. So if this is your first opportunity to with a mosque, why not, otherwise, the area around that building is much more interesting."
,,peacefull,5.0,,"evening after shopping in arab street,, took a break n sat at the sitting place outside the mosque n at the same time aajaan began it was so truly peacefull,, felt so good ..."
,,A nice Mosque to visit,4.0,,The Sultan Mosque is a nice place to visit in Little India. You have to sign the guest book and remove your shoes. If you are wearing shorts or a dress they provide you with a cover up (similar to a graduation robe) without a problem. You can walk around the main prayer hall but you are not allowed to enter. It is an interesting place for a short visit if you are in the area.
,,Grand and Splendid Mosque,5.0,,"This is a grand Architectural marvel. It is a Muslim religious place where prayers are held five times a day, as in any other Mosque. Non Muslims are allowed for a visit during non-praying hours to have a look of the grandeur. One is wonder struck with its architecture, serenity and peaceful atmosphere inside. It has no Air-conditioning, but there are king size fans which attract our attention and it is cool inside. The chandeliers are also feast for the eyes. The Imam leading the prayers and his rendering of Quran is soothing to the ears.It is one of the oldest Mosques in Singapore and the surroundings, i.e. the Arab Street and the shops buzzing with tourists of different regions and religions, enhances its beauty very much. During Friday congregation, it is full of devotees and colourful. It's visit is a must for every tourist, particularly a student of Architecture and History."
,,Huge Mosque,4.0,,"Huge Sultan Mosque is of course major attraction in this area, but it's not the only reason to come here.Little different vibe than any other place in S'pore. Nice little shops(remember bargaining) and some good restaurants too."
,,Very welcoming,5.0,,Great place to visit. Huge mosque with a very welcoming environment for any non-muslims. Some great eating places right behind this mosque to check out.
,,Spirit,4.0,,"Architecturally it is a sight to behold but it is the spiritual aura of the place that makes a trip to this religious site worthwhile. We got here and we just appreciated the calmness and peacefulness it gives ones soul. It is located just a few minutes away from the Bugis MRT station and is also near the very busy Arab street.

Suggestions:
- Length of visit: 30 minutes - 1 hour
- Go and appreciate the fun and hip Haji lane, it is very nearby."
,,The most I LOVE,5.0,,My favourite place in Singapore. Clean & really comfortable. Peace of mind ;) Will come over and over again.
,,Spiritually up lifting experience,5.0,,"Great atmosphere and ambiance to the area in what I believe is created by the presence of the worshipers attending the various prayers. The call to prayer, the Adhaan, in the bustle of the city brings a serenity to area. The mosque still has the old architecture and feel which gives this entire area a special character. Definitely worth a visit to experience a different side to Singapore."
,,Very welcoming,5.0,,"We went on Saturday morning, there were 2 wedding parties at the Mosque and we were invited inside to meet the brides and wish them we'll. once inside the door there are some really interesting sign boards explaining all aspects of their religion. Yes we had to wear the supplied robes and button up which was fine. The exterior has the most wow factor of course and the inside is plain for a reason ( not to distract worshippers).
We were guided around by a lovely gentleman who was a part of the bridal party and happy to show us everything and answer questions, a very nice gesture indeed. There was no suggestion at conversion or one religion being superior to another just this is what and how we do it.
Very enjoyable, so thank you to our guide.
We stayed over the road and could see and hear the mosque from our room which was fabulous, the singing on Monday night was amazing."
,,Super area with magnificent mosque in the heart of it.,5.0,,"Sultan mosque stands imposingly at the heart of the Arab Quarter. The area is lovely, reminiscent of an older time in Singapore, I.e. no high rise skyscrapers! I wondered around the shops selling carpets, perfumes and bought myself a cushion cover embroidered into an elephant design...I've seen these for sale in India for much less the price, and haggling is the key. Soon, the mosque beckoned and after donning the required cover ups, provided free of charge there, I went in. Inside is as the photos on this site show you, grand and in my mind a bit bare, and women are not allowed in the heart of it. But it is much more imposing and magnificent from the outside. One of the members or guide from the mosque got into conversation with me, asked me what my religion was. The answer prompted him to flick through the papers in his folder and he pulled out the required one...the folder was full of leaflets which were ttitled 'why (insert religion e.g. Christians, Hindus, Sikhs etc) should become Muslims'!

Worth visiting the area and the mosque."
,,"Interesting Mosque, in Muslim community",4.0,,"The Sultan Mosque is located at the junction of Arab Street and North Bridge Road. Arab Street is the central place for Singapore's Muslim communities.

The mosque was first built in the 1820s. However the original structure was demolished about a century later to make way for the current building, which was completed in 1932. The mosque holds great significance for the Muslim community, and is considered the national mosque of Singapore. It was designated a national monument in 1975."
,,the golden dome at singapore,5.0,,"the most important places to visit was the Sultan Mosque at singapore.
last week,my daughter and her friend from KL went to have Bak kut Teh,a pork rib soup.thenw e went to the Sultan Mosque.
the entry into the mosque was guided by a few rules like wearing the robes provided free of cost.
this mosque was built in 1824 by Sultan Hussain Shah,the then ruler of Temasek,former name of Singapore.Sir Stamford Raffles promised that the East India Company will provide $ US 3000to assissting in the building of the mosque.It was a brick structure with an area sufficient enough for the Muslim population of that. time to do their prayers.Huge aesthetic windows,prayer rooms,separate for men and women,.Total quietitude and the ambience that is required for a place of prayers.Islam is a religion and a way of Life here at Singapore."
,,Beautiful mosque,5.0,,"Sultan masjid is peral of singapore's culture a full arabian or muslim touch , colourful buildings ,jewel golden dooms of masjid its a wonderful place to visit love u singapore :)"
,,Not Singapore,4.0,,"Once you are around this area, its like going back in time - I love the uniqueness of this place. Walk around, take a break, buy some food or Arabic middle eastern stuff."
,,Beautiful and very religious,5.0,,"Sultan Mosque is really beautiful located near Arab street. I really love to went inside. If the female is with you, must cover the body. Very near to the hostel I stayed Feel At Home."
,,i bring all my friends here,4.0,,just wear decent clothes if you plan to go there...coz its a place for worship. what i love most were the cafe nearby and the authentic restaurant that are halal
,,Underwhelming,3.0,,"This highly publicized mosque in the Arab Street neighborhood of Singapore is rather blend and uninspiring. If this is your first mosque, by all means, please do visit. If you have seen some of the - for example - outstanding Turkish and Istanbul mosques that are of exceptional architectural and artistic beauty, you will be underwhelmed. Meh!"
,,"Time to Pray, when it calls",5.0,,"The mosque was very clean, that include the toilet and place to us to clean our body before our prayer ( wudhu). But unfortunately I had my period at that time so I forbid to pray. I just went to their toilet."
,,Sultan Mosque,3.0,,Arab street is a beautiful street and the mosque is a good finish. But i have to say that the mosque is not so beautiful as i expected. Exterior is more beautiful than the inside if you want an advice.
,,Sultan Mosque - One of the most important mosques in Singapore,3.0,,"The Sultan Mosque is one of the most important mosques in Singapore and it makes an interesting place to visit as well. Its worth reading up a bit on the historical role this mosque played in Singapores early days and history before visiting.

Entrance is free and you can take pictures inside. As expected, shoes much be removed, they also ask visitors to wear a gown cover as well, which is quick to slip on and off. No audio guides are available for this visit but there is some information about the mosque on both sides of the main worship area just after you enter the mosques. Visits can be done in 10-15 minutes are are free, making the mosque well worth visiting if you plan to spend some time in this area of the city.

The interior area of the mosque that can be visited is spacious, decorated in simple manner. The exterior of the mosque is quite attractive, particularly when viewed from along Bussorah Street which affords you a nice full scale view of the Mosque. Up close, it is also nice, when facing opposite the sun so that your pictures are not bleached.

In addition to visiting the Sultan Mosque, its worth spending a bit of time walking up and down Arab St., Oman St. and nearby Haji Lane while you are in this area. Just across the street from the mosque is a great little restaurant called Singapore Zam Zam that is worth a quick stop for the murtabak dishes, where are excellent.

Overall, not one of the top priority attractions in Singapore but a place worth visiting if you plan to be in this area of the city."
,,an interesting place,4.0,,"one of the biggest mosque in Singapore, surrounded by the Muslim community in Sg. There are many shoppes, restaurants, cafes that bring a very different feelings..."
,,Big Dome,5.0,,"If you haven't been to a mosque before , you should come here . The interior design inside is kind of indian ;D. Great for tourists , especially those that.want to have cultural photos.The guide was very funny and informaive and he even gave us free notebooks ;D ."
,,Singapore's golden dome,4.0,,"Have you seen a major Muslim landmark built by a Brit? Come see. At every prayer call, the mosque rises, overcoming Kampong Glam with senses of calm & relief as its reciter sings through its loudspeakers."
,,The biggest in Singapore.,5.0,,Great stop for a photo if you've not experienced mosque's before. This is coupled with beautiful arabic dining surrounding the area. It really has a great feel about it.
,,Beautiful and Unique...,5.0,,Loving the location... A very active mosque members and communities around it regardless the ages... A perfect spot for tourists. The restaurant nearby is just nice.
,,A welcoming place,3.0,,"Don your green gown , take off your shoes and wander through the mosque. It is hardly the most beautiful mosque in the world but it is interesting and the fact that there are usually people on hand willing to talk to you about it (and about Islam) is great. It is worth a visit."
,,Historic mosque,4.0,,It has a long history that goes back to 1824. There are free tours conducted on weekends and a guide will bring you through the mosque and explain some muslim culture and traditions.
,,Beautiful at night,3.0,,A very old mosque with lots of charm. Capture a few shots at night. It's beautiful especially the intricate details of the structure.
,,Beautiful Architecture!,4.0,,"I pass by Sultan Mosque quite frequently, and will always stop to admire the architecture of the mosque. The mosque stands out with its golden dome, and makes for nice pictures both during the day and at night. Kampong Glam Cafe is a nice spot to enjoy a cup of tea with a good view of the mosque. Malaba Mosque, Abdul Gafoor Mosque and Hajjah Fatimah Mosque are in the vicinity as well, and worth taking a look if time permits. Each of the mosques is unique in its own way."
,,A beautiful mosque to visit and to learn about the Islamic religion and culture,5.0,,"The Sultan mosque in Singapore has a history that can date back to 1824. It is located in the Kampong Glam district, and is a prominent landmark of the district. This is the mosque to visit to learn more about the religion and culture of the Muslims in Singapore.

In Aug 2012, I visited the Sultan mosque during the month of Ramadan. I had the privilege to register for and to attend one of the Ramadan Trails that is organised by the Sultan Mosque. I understand that the Ramadan Trail was organised during the month of Ramadan on selected dates.

THE RAMADAN TRAIL:
During the Ramadan Trail, visitors can expect to be given a presentation on the history of the mosque, and the significance of Ramadan. In addition, visitors will be given a guided tour of the mosque. Volunteers from the mosque would also give a demonstration of the prayer. The Ramadan Trail ends with the breaking of the fast with the Muslims. The folks from the Sultan Mosque were hospitable. In addition, it was enlightening for a non-Muslim like myself to learn more about the Islamic religion and the signifance of the month of Ramadan. I felt very grateful to be given the opportunity to break fast with the Muslims too. The Ramadan Trail was about 1.5 hours in duration, including the optional breaking of fast with the Muslims. To sign up for the Ramadan Trail, it will be helpful to enquire directly with the Sultan Mosque during the month of Ramadan.

VISITING THE MOSQUE:
In general, visitors who are non-Muslims could visit the Sultan Mosque at the following visiting hours to learn more about the mosque:
Mondays - Sundays (except Fridays): 9.30 a.m. - 12.00 p.m./ 2.00 p.m. - 4.00 p.m.
Fridays: 2.30 p.m. to 4.00 p.m.

There will be multi-lingual docents who would guide visitors about the Sultan Mosque. I read that the docents could speak languages such as English, Malay, Japanese and Chinese.

The mosque has a relatively large prayer hall which can accomodate up to 5000 people. I understand that visitors are not allowed to enter the main prayer hall and the prayer hall on the second frloor except with the company of a mosque official.

Photography is allowed in the mosque. Video filming is subject to approval from the mosque. Please take note that all visitors must be properly attired. There will be robes available at the counter near the main entrance of the mosque. Visitors are expected to remove their footwear and observe cleanliness in the mosque's compound.

There are many good eating places nearby the mosque.

The nearest MRT station is Bugis MRT station which is about 10 minutes walk away.

Here's the Sultan Mosque's website: http://www.sultanmosque.org.sg"
,,Unforgettable cultural experience,5.0,,"From the outside, the mosque is a beautiful structure, and a landmark of the Arab Heritage section in Singapore. I was not sure you could enter but I ventured it. All you have to do is leave your shoes outside and cover your whole body with a garment. If you are not dressed for it, they provide some kind of garment that covers the whole body, arms and legs. If you do not comply with the garment rule, you cannot enter. The internal area of the mosque was impressive with beautiful unique chandeliers and some kind of gate that separated the public area from the more exclusive area where the men prayed. When I was there last month, it was Ramadan, and there was a foodfair going on outside. The food was from different Arab countries, as well as Singaporean Muslim cuisine, affordable and quite good! As I left the mosque, the man at the reception invited me to join their mosque sponsored Ramadan breaking of the fast dinner that night, which I did do, and which was quite an experience as well. Inside the mosque, they also have an exhibit with information on the basics of the Islam religion. Very informative."
,,"Free Entrance, Shops nearby",4.0,,"The mosque is open to visitors everyday except during prayer times noon 12 to 2pm and 4 to 5pm is closed. Those wearing shorts should use the Green Cloaks provided at the main entrance at the staircase. The ladies prayer Hall on level 2 is out of bounds for Tourists.

On level one is small exhibit of the history of Islam & the mosque. Sometimes there are volunteers to guide you around the mosque in English.

It is worth visiting the area around the mosque start from Bali Lane, Haji Lane, Arab Street and so on. It is very lively at night too. Around the mosque, there are lots of two storey shop houses selling food, clothings, cloths, souveniers, perfumes, bookshop, carpets, 7Eleven convenience store, camera shop etc."
,,Lovely landmark near Arab Street,4.0,,"I didn't go inside this mosque, but I took a few photos of the outside because I found it quite spectacular.
It is located in a colorful area and there are lots of restaurants nearby.
Arab Street is very close so you might want to check it out as well. It has a nice vibe."
,,Harmony,4.0,,This is an old mosque. There are interesting building features in it. It is also in the heart of Arab street. There are interesting shops around. There is one that sells perfumes made without alcohol.
,,Biggest mosque in Singapore,4.0,,"Love the architecture, the most beautiful mosque in Singapore and biggest too. Good for photography also..."
,,Great architecture,5.0,,Mosque is beautiful but it was very hot when we went (not adequate ventilation considering its age). There is an AMAZING food place right in front of it though that you must eat it if visiting it.
,,Interesting history,4.0,,Love visiting the mosque. Visitors get to go in the mosque provided you put on proper attire. Head scarves are available for ladies to use. Observe the glass bottles on the stucture. These bottles were donated by the folks who couldn't donate $$$.
,,Interesting - worth a visit,4.0,,This is the first mosque I'd ever been into. You can't enter the prayer hall but visitors are welcome to wander around and look at the building. I found it really interesting and enjoyed looking around.
,,School excursion,5.0,,Ask for a tour. They provide excellent explanations. Lovely at night too as it is lit up. Good open air dining too.
,,Great............!!!!!!!!,5.0,,Great mosque after Taj Mahal in India.......didn't it?????
,,Beautiful monument relects power and pride of the malay community,3.0,,"The building itself speaks for itself. Incredible architecture. One has to read about it before you visit.
Yes, it is a place for worship but we just admire it and it feels great!
One needs to be in respectable attire before you enter. Do ask if you want take photos. The outside is fine but if you want take photos inside, do check iwth the people taking care of the building.
Around the areas, there are shops and also restaurants where one can try Malay cuisine. Always our favorite cusine!
Nearest MRT is Bugis. From MRT about a 5 minute walk along victoria street."
,,One of the most impressive mosques I've seen before,4.0,,"As the first mosques I've had the opportunity to see up close and visit, I have to say that it was very impressive! If memory serves me correctly, I seem to remember seeing a sign (or unless I read it after getting home from my trip there), that it's the biggest mosque in all of Singapore and certainly very beautiful in it's architecture. As you approach the site, the big golden domed top greets you from afar. The minarets and pointed towers are also unique in style and the prayer hall was very neat to see. During my visit at this particular time, there were a number of prayers going on and so I sat at the back of the hall just to listen to everything.
* They actually have little colored circular areas on the rug for everyone to sit on throughout the entire prayer hall floor!
Again, as my first time to see a mosque, this place was rather impressive for me."
,,"Not much to see inside, but the outside is cool looking",1.0,,"It's big, and the outside is kinda impressive, so you might want to look as you walk by. Don't bother going in. It's very plain, and they don't permit toruists to enter during prayers, when it might be interesting."
,,Central to Kampong Glam,5.0,,"Irish architect Denis Santry of Swan and Maclaren adopted a Saracenic style when designing this mosque, incorporating minarets and balustrades. The mosque was completed in 1928. The prayer hall and golden domes highlight its features.

Sultan Mosque has stayed essentially unchanged since it was built, with only repairs carried out to the main hall and an annex added in 1993. It was designated as a national monument in 1975.The mosque is regarded as one of the most important mosques in Singapore.

Along with regular prayers it holds regular social functions and during our visit there was one taking place with stalls selling items and food."
,,Kampong Glam's main attraction,4.0,,"A trip to the Sultan Mosque is an essential part of understanding one of the three major religions that make up modern day Singapore. The mosque is quite an imposing structure in its own right, easily seen from the surrounding area. Entry is free. I attended with the “Arab Street” tour from Singapore Walks which does a good job of putting the Mosque in the context of the history of the Arab community in Singapore. Of note, if you are wearing shorts or a sleeveless shirt (short sleeves are permissible) you will be asked to put a robe on before entering."
