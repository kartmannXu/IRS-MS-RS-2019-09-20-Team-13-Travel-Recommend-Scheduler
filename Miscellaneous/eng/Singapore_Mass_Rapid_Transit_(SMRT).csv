,,"Efficient, cheap and clean way to get around Singapore...",5.0,,"SMRT is a great way to get around Singapore.

We purchased a Singapore Tourist Pass at the airport - for 30 Singapore Dollars it offers unlimited travel on the SMRT and buses for three days (shorter and cheaper options are available).

The SMRT is clean and user friendly - all of the signage and announcements are in English. The carriages are spacious, although seats can be at a premium during busy periods, and other users are very polite.

The SMRT network links to most of the main sights of the city. Strongly recommended..."

,,Daily commute to work,5.0,,"One of the most reliable mode of transport is the MRT, as you can estimate your travel time to your destination, provided there is no breakdown. Use it daily to commute to work. Also good for tourist to go site seeing, when its above ground, theres wonderful and nice scenery to remember by.
Its been 30 years since the first MRT started rolling and have since improved and upgraded its services with more trains and routes. You can go almost anywhere on the train but first check your routes on where you want to go.
The best, fastest and easiest mode of transport. Travel during off peak, its less crowded. All you need is to purchase a stored value card at the ticketing office.
Train start rolling at 5.30am and last train at mid-night.
Enjoy the ride.."

While I was in Singapore for three days, I was able to get a pass for $S12. The Downtown Line was the only one I needed to use in order to get me to all the places that I wanted to go during my short time there so I didn't even need to change lines.

You can get the map online and check which line to take or where to change the train to go to a particular place. Well connected to most of the important location in Singapore. Tourist friendly with proper indications given. You don't have to ask any one for directions, jus know which street you want to go and check it on indicators. Very clean, air conditioned and comfortable. Has hefty fine for drinking and eating inside station or train. Ticket vending Machine are available at entrance. You can also buy pass at the airport.

,,Awesome experience,5.0,,Using MRT in Singapore is cheapest way of travel. Need to buy a card which is available at any MRT counter. These MRT stations are located all across Singapore and quite easy to find. Same card can be used to travel in buses as well as Sentosa express monorail also. I used it once from Bencoolen station to Marina bay station. For people coming to Singapore for first time and with family using MRT to travel is bit tricky. But overall a very convenient way to travel across and very cost effective. Using MRT map will be very handy to know about routes and stations.

,,"Convenient, Cheap & Comfortable",5.0,,SMRT is probably the most convenient & quickest way to travel around in Singapore. There is a train every 2/3 minutes in every station. The fare is quite reasonable. Ideally would encourage tourists to buy MRT passes (which work with Singapore Bus as well) and load it beforehand with atleast 40-50 SGD/person (we stayed there for 6 days). there is an official website as well which shows the traveler the optimum route to go from one place to the other which was quite easy to understand.

With different lines available, you can travel in comfort to various locations in Singapore like Bedok, Little India, Chinatown."
,,Using the MRT from airport to get to the city and elsewhere,4.0,,"For overseas visitors to Singapore, if you are travelling light, you can use the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) from the airport to get to almost any place in Singapore. Take note that there is no special area to hold luggage on the trains, so you may cause some inconvenience to other commuters if the train is packed. You will need to get off at Tanah Merah station to transfer to another train (just across the platform). This puts you on the East-West line, which brings you to the city or you can change trains along the way to get to your destination. The system is easy to navigate and there are many signages (primarily in English) around the stations. Get an EZlink card at the station (self service kiosk) if you plan to use the MRT and public buses to move around the island. You can enjoy some savings this way, especially when you hop off a train to catch a bus and vice versa."
,,Efficiency at its best,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is easily accessible and very efficient. You can purchase your tickets at the numerous machines installed at stations and enjoy the ride.

,,This is how public transport should be!,5.0,,"A great way to get around in Singapore, whether you are a tourist or a local. Fast cheap efficient clean safe and frequent. There are maps on the stations and in the trains for your line and the whole system. 4G works on all the lines so your map app will continue to work if you have roaming (no WiFi). Serves the airport well, although a little more difficult for terminal 4, not impossible but takes longer and involves a bus ride."
,,Easie peasie,5.0,,"From airport to hotel lobby one change of line same platform
How easy is that, OK it was Marina Bay Sands but that was efficient, up town, Boon Tak Rd, Little India all accessible from here to there.

,,The way to get around.,5.0,,"The trains are clean, quiet, frequent and cover the major tourist places, the airport and they get you close to the rail station if you fancy heading to Malaysia that way. Get one of their electronic pay cards as you get discounted travel with multiple use. Most stations are n air-conditioned underground parts of shopping malls so you are kept cool. It can be exhausting if you try to walk in the humidity. Use the map in conjunction with a guide book as it can be confusing working out exactly where you are when you emerge form one if many exits at a particular station."

Highly recommend"
,,Cleanest and safest seeling underground I have every been on,5.0,,"If your measure for what public transportation and specifically an underground system should be like is somewhere like London or New York then Singapore is a real eye opener. The basic concept of course is the same , but what makes the difference is how incredibly clean it is, the fact that no eating or drinking is allowed will help with this, but also as with all of Singapore it just feels incredibility safe.

From a tourist perspective, the only think that could make it slightly better would be to be able to obtain the passes automatically from the machines rather than having to queue at the booths to buy them."

When we arrived at our station, taxis were available to take us to a final destination. We are in our 70’s and even though there are many seats marked for special consideration, they were always occupied by those who did not appear to need them with their concentration on an iPhone so they had no idea of those standing nearby. We found it amusing that just about every passenger’s vision was glued to an iPhone. I became unwell on one journey and my husband had to ask a teenager to give up the seat, which he did immediately- thank goodness! Singapore’s MRT is wonderful, with clean toilets at every station and attendants to assist. It’s the best way to get around the island and see the extensive building development."

The MRT system in Singapore is the easiest underground transport system we have used for wheelchair access.
There are raised metal dots on the floor guiding you to the elevator and the platform location where the disabled carriage will stop. The local travellers are really helpful and will make way for wheelchairs. This includes the lifts. No queue jumping. People will wait their turn to use the lift."

Firstly tourist 1,2 & 3 day pass.
Can only be purchased at certain stations Airport a d China Town are two. Need to take passport when purchasing, valid for multiples of 24 hour periods from time of purchase. $10 deposit returned only at certain stations see above. Fr

Top up card
Purchase card $7 at hotel use card on buses and trains, card needs to have value added from machine in tube station. Not sure if you can get money paid for card back when finished.

Pay as you go
Buy single or return tickets at any station, just point at destination on screen and insert correct cash. Note max note size $5

Good luck"

,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"We have purchased our tourist travel cards multiple times on arrival at the airport. Go to Terminal 2, (on the Sky Train) just to the left of the MRT station at the bottom of the escalator. Often there is a queue but it’s worth the wait.
This time we got a five day pass for $S30.00. We used the trains and the buses daily and found both to be superb - for comfort, frequency and cleanliness - another day and we would have needed to top up, but we had enough for the five days. Best of all, on this particular card, you are reimbursed the amount left on the card, so no money wasted.

Maps and information always accurate and readily available. The only place we’ve encountered that you can’t get all the way to with your card is the river safari park - but we used that to the last stop in the tourist area and then caught a bus that we paid (very little) cash for. This is the best tip for travellers to S’pore - get an MRT pass."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"We used the MRT during our visit to hop between the different areas.

All signage is in English and it is easy to find your way around.

We purchased a $12 card which worked like an Oyster card. Journey costs are minimal.

Although taxis are cheap the MRT is a good alternative and easy to use."
,,Most efficient way to make your way around Singapore,5.0,,"Pick up an ezlink travel card in your nearest MRT station and load up with cash. This avoids the need to carry excessive amounts of change.

When you plan your travel itinerary make sure to reference the local MRT station.

Overall it is cheap, clean and quick."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"This is the way to get around Singapore. Grab a card and get some credit to travel around the network cheaply and efficiently, with 5 minutes normally being the most time you need to wait for next service. There is a special Visitors Card you can purchase for travel over a few days but we got the local ones as we were staying longer. Just remember that there is no eating or drinking on the network - fines apply."
,,AWESOME MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM!,5.0,,"This transportation system is state of the art. I have used many different mass transport systems all over the world, and Singapore's MRT is superior to all the others. It is so clean, quiet, air-conditioned, well lit, has great signage, and is very easy to navigate. We managed it well from our first trip."
,,Train,5.0,,So easy to use that I could explain to someone how to use it after three days of using it used it a lot
,,"Easy to use, efficient and clean",5.0,,"My family and I just finished a 5 day stay in Singapore. We found the MRT to be a convenient and easy way to get around the city. Having been to many cities around the world with subway systems, this one ranks amongst one of the cleanest and most intuitive. You purchase a card on day 1, load it up with stored value, and you’re off to the races.

We opted not to use the 2 or 3 day tourist cards (given our 5 days stay). Overall, I think the choice not to purchase the 2 or 3 days cards was the better choice.

This easy to use and far reaching network is a good option. We had no difficult getting around. You can also download an App in which you type in your starting and ending stations and the App will tell you which train to take and where to get off. Easy!"
,,Very Good value,5.0,,"We used the MRT on many occasions to get around Singapore, its quick clean and cheap way to travell around.
Using the ticket machine is easy just make sure you know the best way around the network and which interchange station to use.
If the MRT does not go direct to where you wish, it will usually get you pretty close where you can then walk or take a short taxi ride.
We preferred to use tickets each day as opposed to the rail card you can buy and top up."
,,"Excellent service - clean, efficient and cheap",5.0,,"My title says it all - so easy to use, frequent trains, cheap and absolutely spotless. People actually queue here sensibly (unlike the London underground!) And even in rush hour you can get onto a carriage. Much better than spending lots of money on cab fares and good if you don't mind the walks too."
,,So convenient,5.0,,"Stayed in a hotel next to the MRT. So wherever you want to go you can get there without any hassle once you get to understand the MRT map.

Cheap. Opt for the prepaid card rather than singapore tourist pass. Much cheaper.

Well aerated and light. As everywhere the place is clean and safe."
,,An excellent transport system,5.0,,Very efficient service with very frequent trains & very helpful staff. We took several journeys from our hotel close to Esplanade Station to Sentosa Chinatown & downtown
,,Best Transport,5.0,,"Well what can i say. Best Transport, clean, maps everywhere. We got a tourist card for $30 each. You get $10 back when you return the cards. Driver less trains, amazing. No graffiti and beautiful polite locals"
,,Like something straight out of the future,5.0,,"The MRT is an extremely efficient, clean and easy way to get around Singapore, much cheaper than taking a taxi. Also super safe."
,,The MRT should form the model for ALL underground Railways!,5.0,,"Once you purchase your Pass Card from any MRT station, it gives you around $7 worth of travel which is easily topped up at machines using cash or credit card.
Before departing Singapore with plans not to return soon, you can refund any excess cash from your card with ease.
Navigating around the MRT is incredibly easy with each Train Line having one identifying number. Each Line is color Coded.
All railways should be like the Singapore MRT if only they were as cool and clean as the this amazing form of transport."
,,Really quick and convenient,5.0,,"A well priced and easily accessible underground system that was easy to use and not overcrowded, even on a saturday"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"This has to be one of the best public transport systems in use anywhere. It’s cheap, clean, fast, safe, always on time & when you combine trains and buses, you can get almost anywhere. For tourists, there’s a special tourist card available from the customer service counter when you show your passport. It’s only valid for 1, 2, or 3 days (choose your option when you buy) and can only be extended for an extra two days. If you return it to a customer service desk within 7 days of purchase, they’ll refund you $10SG."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"MRT is a great way to get around. Not expensive, super clean and efficient . Just be aware to check that you are not buying a return ticket by accident. The machine does not default to single you have to select and we booked return by accident! !"
,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,"Clean, modern, cool ride with ease in English and other languages. Great way to travel and economical. The East West Line, starts from the Jewel in Airport...to the West and links youto the City via North South Line."

,,"Efficient, on time, clean!",5.0,,"Awesome transport system here in Singapore, probably best I’ve seen, and also very reasonably priced"
,,Clean and fast,4.0,,"Singapore isn't exactly big to begin with, but this system makes it a lot easier to get around. If you don't like walking then you have some tough luck, because the entrances are far from the platform."
,,Clean & Fast,5.0,,"Last time I used the MRT was 10 years ago. Yesterday, I used it and the train looked brand new and there was no smell. The air-con was excellent and there is an electronic board now that shows which is the next stop and whether the line splits. MRT has undergone minor tweaks and its even better than before."
,,Quickest way around Singapore,5.0,,"A fast and efficient transport system, we used it on the way back from the National Stadium after the game between Manchester United and Intee Milan
There were close to 55.000 there but at the MRTyou would not have thought so, trains every couple of minutes getting peopke away into the city, we’ll sign pisted, plenty of announcements and cheap, standers ticket $2 Singapore dollars (£1)"
,,Great way to explore Singapore.,5.0,,This visit to Singapore we took the SMRT from Changi airport to our hotel. It was one stop then change to a different line to get to the stop we needed. Then a short walk to our hotel. Train was not too busy and seating available. Wide trains that are clean and have clear listing of the train stops and where to change to a different line. There are lifts at the staions for us to use with our luggage We bought a tourist 3 day pass at the airport as we intended to catch trains each day to take us to some if Singapores many attractions. From our hotel station back to Changi airport on the 4th day we bought a ticket from the machine at the station and this was easy to do and cost was S$2.60. The trip was 1 hour from hotel door to airport but the time went quickly.
,,Perfect way to get around!,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is so easy to use. Trains come every few minutes and they are clean, fast and the system is so efficient.

Fares are cheap and it really is the perfect way to get around Singapore. We used this every day and also caught it out the the airport when we left. So so easy!"
,,"Cheap(ish), quick, regular service, very clean",5.0,,"Unmanned ‘underground’ modern transport. Very easy to use and clearly signed/mapped, regular trains, helpful staff and citizens."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit was one of our only mode of transport. We had to travel from Singapore Changi to Holland Drive. As I travelled more often by means of transport I have learned the route and familiarised myself re: interchange stops.
The MRT system is reliable, clean and comfortable.
I saw a worker that went on the train and inspected the train by making sure the disabled seats were used by those who needed the seat more than others. As I was a walking stick user, I managed to get a seat most times but there were days that I had to request for a youth to let me have the seat. See you Singapore in September !

MRT trains here I come."
,,Punctual and good to get around,5.0,,Easy way of getting around in Singapore. Buy the 2 or 3 day tourist pass if you are there for a visit. I used citymapper app to figure my way around
,,"Fast, efficient and cheap!",5.0,,"Driverless trains which arrive every couple of minutes get you around the city with ease. Clean stations, friendly people and simple to work out the best ways to travel. Get hold of a Singapore Tourist Pass which gives unlimited access to trains and buses."

,,So clean and efficient,5.0,,We found the MRT so user friendly!! Cheap and quick! Ticket machines are easy to understand and clear signage everywhere 👍💜
,,Wow! So impressive.,5.0,,"This would have to be the best public transport system. So easy to get around the city, the signage is exceptional, we had no trouble finding where to go!"
,,Wow! The world could learn from this!,5.0,,"The MRT was the best mass transit system I've ever seen. Very convenient, fast, and CLEAN. We bought the 3-day visitor pass while on vacation and it was the best decision we ever made. HINT: always look at the end of the line location you want when choosing your train. The maps are everywhere so you can figure it out."
,,The most convenient,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is the most convenient and inexpensive transportation. the instructions for each route are very easy to understand, even for tourists who visit Singapore for the very first time. in general, platforms have direct access to many shopping centers and/or others popular buildings."
,,4 day singapore stopover,5.0,,Couldn't rate this system any highly. Its the best transport system I have ever been on. Never waited any longer than 4minutes on every station for a train. The stops and information is all displayed very simply and universal. The tickets are cheap roughly around $1.60 for a single depending on the distance you travel. Don't waste your money on taxi's the MRT is much cheaper and quicker to see the sights and get around the city.
,,Tourist pass,5.0,,"We purchased a tourist pass for each family member and were able to travel everywhere for $10 each (plus $10 bond/deposit each). Very convenient, clean and so efficient. We travelled all over Singapore in our time there. The only downfall is we couldn’t get our bond refund as the ticket office was closed when we were at Changi airport for our flight departure."
,,Good Experience,5.0,,I have been taking the MRT when I am back to visit and never experience any delay or problem. Enjoyed all my rides.
,,"Affordable, reliable, and convenient, but...",4.0,,"Ok, so you've read a lot about the MRT system we have here and how it's risen (almost) from the ashes of the first huge breakdown in 2011 due to lack of maintenance and replacement of ageing components.

Now, in July 2019 with the overhaul and upgrades and teething issues sorted out - plus a rapidly expanding network of new train lines to cover the whole island (except Pulau Tekong, you poor, poor recruits and SAF Regulars) our MRT and subway system has greatly increased the locals' and tourists' ability to travel in air-conditioned comfort to forage for good eats from the Heartlands to MBS.

However, beware: always be alert for when our current Transport Minister Khaw's joyful (some say cursed) announcements of new milestones in rail reliability. Because there has been a noted running joke (or trend, however you comprehend it it) that whenever he praises the MRt/subway system, something will break down.

So ride the lines, and enjoy what Singapore has to offer. But keep your eyes and ears alert. #SGSecure"
,,Cheap and convenient.!,5.0,,"Easy to travel, easy accessible, clean subway. Every person is there to help. In morning it is crowded because of peak hours but else all good"

,,"Quick , cheap , clean",5.0,,"If you find yourself in Singapore , a stay or just a stop over this transport is so easy , cheap , clean , efficient and very safe you can get into the city ( raffles ) etc within 45 mins , it’s provides so much information of were you are what’s next even if you don’t speak English or other languages, u can buy a unlimited tourist card from machines in the station for $20 Singapore, don’t forget to get a refund on the card when your finished it’s $10 Singapore , it’s an amazingly cheap a great way to see Singapore"
,,Convenient transportation in Singapore,5.0,,"The reason we like to use public transportation in Singapore is that very convenient, safe, on time and very easy to access from and to anywhere we want to go in Singapore. The price is also very good and reasonable. In our country we never/ seldom use public due to the reason above, but in Singapore is totally different. My kids are very excited to use public transportation especially MRT in Singapore."
,,Travel Singapore by train,5.0,,"Totally automated train service. Get the Ez.link Tap on tap off card. Once you understand and get used to the different lines and station interchanges, its great. Lifts and escalators make it easy for anyone. Trains very regular. Everything in English. Best metro service anywhere. All central stations access shopping centres."
,,much nicer tham NYC subway,5.0,,"was in Singapore for 3 days and needed to get around. Used MRT a number of times and was very nice experience.
several stops close to my hotel in Clarke Quay.
Signage good. hint: there are a number of exits/entrances. when u enter it is good to take note of letter designating your entrance/exit so that finding your way once u get out is easier.
I did get the 20 SGD 3 days pass which I am not sure was correct for me as I felt I did not use enough to justify. Additionally there was a 10 SGD deposit on the card so returning it for refund was PIA."
,,Easy and safe to use!!,5.0,,We found the MRT really good and easy to navigate. The ticket process is simple and staff are on standby to assist.
,,Safe and Cheap,5.0,,"This is buy far the best way to get around. the fares are the cheapest, a Taxi from the Airport cost $50 Singapore to CLARKE KEY. The MRT fare was $3.50 Singapore."

,,Easy system,5.0,,"The MRT is effective, efficient and easy to navigate. Highly recommend using it instead of taxis. The ticket machines are also user friendly."
,,"Modern, Clean and Efficient.",5.0,,"One of the best I have travelled on. We obtained our three day tourist pass from one of the main stations in our case “Orchard”. $30 unlimited travel. $10 refund when the card is returned. This can be done at the Airport. The trains are regular, clean and on time. Everyone is patient and well behaved. The signage is clear and easy to follow. Transfers are easily accomplished. It’s the way to get around the city without doubt. Staff at the stations are helpful and polite."
,,"easy, organized, clean",5.0,,very easy to travel the MRT - and there are friendly people on guard to help with the tickets if you need it.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"That about sums it up, quick, efficient, inexpensive, very clean and helpful locals. Just be aware in prefers low denomination notes, S$5 and below, for payment and does not always accept credit cards."
,,Efficient and on time,5.0,,SMRT is by far the easiest way to get around in SG. The price is reasonably and the MRT is clean and cool. By a card as you will be using it and it gives you good savings.
,,Very easy to use.,5.0,,The MRT network is easy to use and very efficient. With little effort a person or a group could easily travel all over the city.
,,"Easy, fast, cheap and clean",5.0,,It's a very modern and cheap way to travel in Singapore. You can use your credit card since April 2019. It's cheaper than buying a day pass for 10 SGD.
,,"Get the ""ezlink card""...it pays off!",5.0,,"Read these hints. It'll help you!
1) You can save money by not using taxis and traveling with the MRT
2) If you will be in Singapore 3 or more days then I suggest you do what we did and spend $12 per person on an ezlink card(s). The card will have $7 worth of riding value and $5 goes to pay for the card itself....BUT each time you ride it costs less than if you went to the ""general ticketing machine"" and bought your fare to wherever you want to go. So, the ezlink card pays for itself! Additionally, you can get on the trains immediately each day without having to walk up to a machine and figure out how to select your location and pay for it. That's just wasted time.
(ezlink cards can be bought in the MRT Stations. Yes, 7-Elevens sell them too, but for $10 with $5 riding value....remember the station will sell the $12 cards with $7 value.
3. You will enjoy your experience with more confidence if you do a little preparation here at home.
Use the website ""gothere.sg""
It works like this: Enter in the MRT Station closest to your hotel
.....then.............: Enter where you would like to go
Click ""search""
This handy website will tell you what train line to start on....what station to get off at.....it makes you feel so confident when you get there :)
4. Inside the train there are electronic signs that show you where you are and what station is next....and the ones beyond that too. There announcements are clear and audible.
I should admit that the MRT will not take you everywhere in the COUNTRY of Singapre but it WILL take you within walking distance of everything in the CITY of Singapore! :)"
,,Quick way to get from A 2 B,5.0,,"Using MRT in Singapore is easy, fast and cheap.. Especially if you have a stored value card. Enjoy the ride!"
,,The Bay Area could learn a thing or two!,5.0,,Only bad news is to buy an MRT Pass you must have Singapore Dollars or a MasterCard (don't take VISA or AmEx). The large fines for eating and drinking on the MRT means that the stations and cars are very clean and in good condition. Multiple lines cover practically the entire city.
,,Clean and efficient,4.0,,"This is a very clean and well run metro system. The trains are always on time and are very safe. It’s pretty reasonable to use as a way to get around Singapore, although there are not stops everywhere one with desire. Also note that if you are coming straight from the airport or just got into the country, there are certain machines that only take cash, and you have to have the appropriate bills or it may not work. Can be a little confusing for first timers."
,,Smooth SMRT Ride,5.0,,"Most convenient, comfortable and value for money ride in the mass rapid transit transportation which takes you from North to South, East to West and the Central region of the island with ease"
,,Travel with easy access,5.0,,"Travelling on the metro was a unforgettable experience here in singapore.
I would say it was smooth travels and I also have a thing for transportation. You may easily buy a standard ticket or get a travels card to access the public transport for few days with no hassle I repeat no hassle."
,,"Clean and fast, but doesn't cover enough ground",4.0,,"Very clean subway system. Easy to use with a rechargeable card. A bit expensive though since children over 90cm pay like adults and need their own card! The card has to be reloaded often, and only take 10dollars recharche minimum. The system is good otherwise and you do get around, but I found it less of a massive system compared to NY, London or Paris."
,,Just get MRT card & you are good to go,5.0,,One of the best transport system in the world.. MRT in Singapore !! It is extremely efficient & designed in such a way that even the ones who have never used it before are comfortable using if for first time.
,,Easiest and cheapest way to get around Singapore,5.0,,You can get a tourist pass for 3 days max for unlimited travel or you can top up the normal travel tickets up to six times which is great for 1 or 2 days use. Trains and buses run regularly and take you to major tourist attractions. Several lines also interconnect each other for making getting around easier.
,,MRT system is first-timer friendly :),5.0,,"It was my first time to travel outside Cebu PH (that do not have MRT transpo system). Experiencing MRT for the first time in SG is very great, they have helpful map with very easy navigation."
,,Seriously good transit system,5.0,,"As many other reviewers have noted, the underground is very clean, efficient, easy to navigate, and provides a brief escape from Singapore’s heat/humidity. It seems like a station is never far away when you’re exploring the city, and you can buy an EZ-link card from any 7-11 store (in addition to MRT stations) then top up as needed. Easy peasy."
,,Perfect,5.0,,What to say? Clean and efficient just typical Singapore. Great as well to go to airport and since it’s aircon a good way to cool down

,,Amazing transport system,5.0,,"I took this almost everyday to work and this is one of the best transport system in Singapore. The train is clean and fast. Avoid the crowd from morning: 7.30am to 9am, evening: 6-730pm and you will be alright."
,,Singapore Transit System,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is a great system. Easy access from the airport, clean, efficient, safe, cheap. What else do you need? You have to get a card ($5 at the airport, not sure if it's cheaper anywhere else), load it with the desired amount at any of the widely available machines, then just go. The route network is easy to understand."
,,Good value,4.0,,"We (family of four) used the MRT extensively over a period of a week and got excellent value from a regular (not singapore visitors') pass each. Efficient, clean and reliable."
,,London could learn a thingh or two.,5.0,,Bought the 3 day pass and that allowed unlimited travel in the city. Very clean and for the most part not very crowded. Never far from a station
,,MRT Great experience,5.0,,"Great experience traveling on MRT in Singapore. Easy to use, station close to hotel. Clean, convenient."

,,So easy and affordable,5.0,,The system is so easy to use and the maps are not confusing at all. We got to all of our destinations with minimal expense and no time stuck in traffic. The air conditioning onboard is excellent and it is so clean. They are also fast and efficient and staff is helpful if you have any problems. Stand up Stacy program is also great and promotes courtesy.
,,Cheap and easy to use,5.0,,"Getting around Singapore via MRT is as easy as. Cheap, extremely safe stations, clean as, helpful staff if you should need help, polite and courteous fellow travellers. The safety factor sets this MRT as the benchmark for any other subway/rail system in the world"

,,A subway that is a bullet train!,5.0,,"Be prepared for the most unique 'subway' you have ever been on. I've traveled many countries and always mastered the subway, but Singapore has it on everyone hands down! It is completely spotless, runs efficiently on autopilot, and is the fastest train you've ever been on underground! Don't be afraid to try!"
,,Easy to use,4.0,,"We travelled around Singapore on the MRT. Easy to use, follow the signs. Lines run North/south, East /West. Stations are inside shopping Plazas. Great way to get around the city."
,,Frustrating,3.0,,I found it frustrating that not all stations could sell you a tourist pass? The buses/trains all ran regularly and easy to use but they need to sort out where you can buy passes!
,,My kids did the navigating,4.0,,"My only criticism was that the station could have been closer to the hotel - just kidding, the walk changed every time as does the city. My kids who are 8 and 9 did the navigating around the city. The travel pass allows 'everywhere' travel and the MRT puts you at the door in quick time. Clean, safe and friendly - if you smile at people, they smile back....."
,,V easy,5.0,,Great air con and very easy to navigate.easy to understand ticket machines. Stations and trains nice a d clean
,,Useful facts about the MRT.......,5.0,,"Much good & praises has been said about the MRT here but there were also some ""misconceptions"" in some reviews as well.

Here are useful facts about the MRT.

1. EVERY station has lifts ( & escalators). Just look above on ceiling level for lifts or directional signages.

2. EVERY station & all trains are fully air-conditioned.

3. EVERY station either has toilets within the station itself or within short walking distance to toilets in a linked shopping mall.

4. Stand on the LEFT of the escalators. Right side is for those who wants to move up fast & overtake.

5. EVERY station has a Passenger Service Counter, where one can ask directional questions or seek assistance. Or ask the security staff or the locals, who are usually very helpful.

6. Ask for a free pocket size MRT map from the Passenger Service Counter for your trip planning. Or download an app ( eg Singapore MRT ) that tells you how to & even advise the shortest routes (fares too) to take.

7. Tourist Pass. Fares for trains & buses are cheap compared to other countries. Therefore, a Tourist Pass may not offer the best value unless one travel extensively daily, which is unlikely as much time are spent at attractions.

Get an EZ Link card instead ( stored value card), just like the locals. One get discounts for every usage using EZ Link card, compared to single ticket cards. And just tap & go. No long queues at machines or hassles.
Simple top up at machines when needed.
Available at all ticketing offices at major MRT stations.

8. For single fare tickets purchase, machines accept only $2 & $5 notes. But $10 notes can be used for EZ Link card value top ups. Often see tourists feeling puzzled as to why the $10 notes keep being rejected by the machine.

9. No drinking or eating inside trains & within all train stations premises. Or risk a heavy fine - this warning is clearly indicated in all trains & stations.

10. Driverless trains. Only the newer 3 of the total 5 MRT lines are driverless.

The older EW (Green) & NS (Red) lines have train drivers - these are the 2 oldest lines.

Hope these facts helps."
,,Fabulous!,5.0,,"So efficient, quick & clean! Love it! We were soon zipping about & marvelling at how well the system works. The best way to get around Singapore!"
,,Don't believe what you hear in the media.,5.0,,"The train service is unbelievable. For those complaining, try using a train service overseas and for such cheap and efficient service."
,,Simple and Cheap,5.0,,Just like subways in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Stations are clean and modern. A little bit slower than some subways as stops are longer and distance between stations is longer.
,,World travel,5.0,,"The best rapid transit system in the world so far. Cheap, easy to understand, 'you can drive it', if you stand at the front, lol. Efficient, clean, what more can I say."
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap and goes everywhere",5.0,,The Singapore rail system known as the MRT is a model of efficiency that must be the envy of rail operators world wide. Trains operate island wide with subway operation in the city zone and becoming an above ground operation once into the suburbs. The MRT operates from Changi airport to the city center however a change of train is required at Tanah Merah. Single trips can be purchased at the automated ticket machines but the stored value cards known as the EZLink needs to be purchased at a ticket window. Top up in value can be done at the ticket machines. The EZ Link card can also be used on the city's bus service as well.Singapore is very well served by public transport of all forms.
,,Great,5.0,,"Was pleasantly surprised to find the underground trains very efficient, very clean and air conditioned. A very good way to get around Singapore."
,,Fun and fast,5.0,,"We purchased a tourist three day pass which we had to queue up to be reissued for our next two days. It was very easy to use and when we queued to hand them back in we were refunded $10 per card. Nice. We found it best to get to the customer desk early to get the card. Check the MRT website for the closest customer service desk & the hours of opening & closing.
We relied heavily on our handy little MRT map.
One day we entered the MRT on the very front carriage and it was great to see it travel fast through the underground with no driver."
,,Ticketing not friendly at airport,4.0,,The SMRT is very efficient but it is not easy to get ticket for visitors at the airport station if you do not have the store value ticket.
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap and easy",5.0,,"Best in the world. Clean, efficient, safe and cheap. Purchase an EZ Card and top up as you go along."
,,Great way to see Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT is brilliant! The system is efficient and very easy to navigate. For people who use rapid transport on a daily basis you will probably not be as impressed but I don't and I was able to move around the island of Singapore with ease. The staff at the Transit centres were very friendly if I needed help and proud of their country.
Quick, cheap and effective way of getting around the place - a winner for me."
,,Simply superb,5.0,,"Clean, Fast & Reasonably priced public transport to get around Singapore. We took this from Farrer Market to Bay Front to reach Garden by the bay"
,,Modern and advanced,5.0,,"Best tube system in Asia. Reminds me of Europe. Easy to purchase tickets via attendant or automated kiosk. We took the tube from our hotel Aljounied RedDoorz to the Marina Sands Park. It was simple, clean, and fast. Announcements at every stop. Stations have maps and route info."
,,Tickety boo – works like clockwork,5.0,,"Excellent system – covers the island quite well, and there are more routes coming in the next five plus years. Very efficient, very clean, spotless stations, great frequency. The staff manning the counter help you to find places at the exits. What more could you want?"
,,Best Public transport system in a major city,5.0,,"The SMRT is amazing. Train stations are easy to find your way around. All lines are colour coded and so many maps and instructions are available in English, arabic, Bahasa Malay and Thai (I think) to help you find the right trains. They run every 3 to 5 minutes everywhere and operate late into the night. Trains are clean and comfortable and not as busy and crazy as some other major cities (Tokyo), although still allow extra time in peak hours to reach your destination. Buy a Nets or SmRT flash card. Tops ups of the card are easy at all stations. Nets cards you can also use for other things in 711's and grocery stores and anywhere displaying the NETS logo. Super easy! And very cost effective too. Beats getting stuck in a taxi in endless traffic jams!"
,,The Best Way to Travel around Singapore!,5.0,,"The Lion City had the advantage of developing its metro when technology had advanced sufficiently to build an exemplary system. It is definitely the most comfortable way to travel around the city. The large tunnels (for people and trains) make it much more spacious than the oldest metro in the world (London's Underground). Sometimes it lacks signposting.

The different lines do some strange things - so get a map. Also the different trains have different passenger display systems inside - just as in London - but much more intuitive than those in London.

Be aware that the Tourist Pass only works for three calendar days - so it might be best not to buy it on your first half day. If you don't extend it, then you can get your deposit back."
,,1 day pit stop in singapore during a cruise,5.0,,"incredible subway, GB presence means something, underground station with free wifi that runs even in the train (not all) air condition and passage that allows uou to avoid the street under the burning sun you can go around the city without any problems"
,,Simple and easy to use,5.0,,"Good signage, comfortable and reliable trains and very simple to purchase a ticket and work out which stop you need."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,"It is clean, prompt, and goes almost everywhere a tourist wants to go. The riders are considerate about respecting seats reserved for the elderly, handicapped, pregnant, or those with small children (unlike Japan, where people knock you out of the way to get to these seats -- young people are the worst). The only minor downside is finding elevators if you have children in strollers, or people in wheelchairs. They are in every station, but sometimes involve a long walk, and sometimes you have to use more than one to get to the appropriate level. The good news is that regular riders don't hog the elevators, so they usually aren't crowded and you don't have to stand in line. Getting a general purpose prepaid card is convenient as it saves time and a small amount of money. There are SMRT maps everywhere, and the stations are well marked, both as to the station name and the direction the train is going is clearly indicated on the platforms."
,,Confusing,3.0,,"Although they are quick to get you from A to B, we found them confusing and no one was thereto help."
,,Mrt,4.0,,"I really appreciate the smart staffs, for their hard work! I understand sometimes the train service delays but I know their doing the best they can to keep it going"
,,Buy your tickets at the airport,4.0,,"the SMRT system is as good as the one in Hong Kong, but not in terms of ticketing. The ticket offices (singular) at each station have only one staff serving and so the queues are long. Better to buy your Singapore visitor's pass (for 1-3 days) at the airport when you arrive."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"The MRT is the easiest way to travel around Singapore and also the cheapest way from Changi Airport through to the various areas of the island. Clean, cheap and running every few minutes, what’s not to like?"
,,The best public transport system in the world?,5.0,,"Here’s a thought. Let’s create a public transport system that is user friendly, fast, efficient, clean and dumb proof.
Let’s put this system in one of the most densely populated countries in the world with some the most time efficient people in the world using it and see what happens.
Voilà, you have the MRT.
Why can’t every country take a leaf out of the Singapore book and design an underground train system on this model?
As a new user to the the system just pick up one of the small maps available at the information counter and follow the train line you need to be on by the colours. You will be comfortable with the system in 15 minutes I can guarantee.
We purchased a 7 day card at 7.11 convenience store for $12 which is loaded with $7 worth of trips. You can top this up at any machine or ticket office in the underground. It will cost you roughly $1.50 per stop to use the train. It is a tap on and tap off system and will reject your card once you get below $3, alerting you that you need to load more money onto it. There are people everywhere to help.
Move with the crowd and don’t stop suddenly or you might get bowled over! Keep to the left on escalators to let people pass. A very, very, very simple transport system to use. We used it every day for 5 days at a cost of approximately $30 each."
,,Singapore travel,5.0,,It was very easy to travel about the area. The trains were very clean and the directions were easy to make our way around the area.
,,The best way to get around.,5.0,,"Clean, on time and not crowded. The best way and easiest ti get around in Singapore. The best way is get the tourist card if you plan to stay few days."
,,"Best transport. Cheap, Clean & Fast!",4.0,,"You will never find a single piece of litter in the train nor at the platform. Nobody eats or drinks in the train too. The trains reach out to all parts of Singapore. Fast and efficient, it is very affordable too. Tourists can buy a 2/3/4-day ticket for unlimited rides. You can even ride from your hotel to the airport, it is so convenient. For frequent travellers, buy an ez-link card that you can top up (when the value runs low). You will save more.

You will not get lost in the MRT transport. If you miss a stop, just alight at the next stop, walk across the platform to take the reverse train to go back.

The only thing to avoid the train is DO NOT TAKE IT DURING PEAK HOURS, ie 7.30am - 9.30am and 5pm - 7.30pm."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Frequent enough and many lines that reaches almost everywhere. Use a ezlink card instead of buying single trip tickets. The price differ a lot, like more than 20%."
,,Travel in comfort,5.0,,"Can be very busy during peak hours, but fast and efficient, buy your swipe card at a station or seven eleven, very reasonable priced."
,,quick and easy,5.0,,"Cheap, simple to use, fast, clean transport and a good escape from walking in the hot and humid streets."
,,very safe and efficient...,5.0,,travelled solo and was so amazed by its efficiency and accessibility. near all major attractions and landmarks
,,Not easy experience for tourists.,2.0,,"I always like using metro or MRT when travelling especially in different countries. It's nice to see how it works and how the train looks however it was not a good experience for me in Singapore

As a tourist I found it quite difficult to navigate. Firstly to buy a ticket you need to use the kiosk machine. The machines only accept coins or notes smaller than 10 SGD. It's frustrating coming from a long flight and realising that you need to have some 2 dollar notes or 5 dollars to buy your ticket. Something to plan and remember for next time.

Also not sure if it's everywhere or only Changi airport station but cashier does not provide change."
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,"A $30, three day pass gets you free train s and buses everywhere and the train has stations near everything! This is a really fas, efficient way to travel, and you get $10 refund when you return the card.
Online there are some great sites to make your journey easier and tell you what bus or train and where to change."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Just as the title says, plus helpful attendants. One of the cleanest subway systems I have ever seen, so light and bright. I would think safe to travel on at any time of night"
,,Fast and effective way to get around Singapore,5.0,,What Australian city planners could learn from Singapore...effective mass transport. The MRT is easy to use and prompt. Multiple inter-connecting stations enable you to traverse the city. Finding the ticket booth was the biggest challenge.
,,Convenient and Economical,5.0,,Clean comfortable ride. Hassle free. Almost link to all major interest areas. Very clear routes map shown at every station.
,,Cheap and efficient,5.0,,Bought a pass and went everywhere. Good value and efficient transport. Pass was $12 and included $7 credit. Trips cost between 85c and $1.90. Important to note that destinations are signed according to the last stop on the route.
,,Amazing connectivity,5.0,,"Hassle free commute!! Get the tourist all day pass and you are sorted 😃 also you can try singtel hi tourist ez link card which $3 complimentary to commute one way, you can top it up later."
,,"Easy, efficient and clean was to move around Singapore",5.0,,"I'm always amazed at how great Singapore train system is. You don't have to look at timetables, just head to the station and pick your line and in no time your train arrives. I caught it many times from the central stations and I never waited more than 1-2 minutes. They clearly announce the stations and you can see on the routes in the train where you are. It's also cheap to travel you just need to get a transit card. I haven't ventured on the buses as the train seemed to take me where I wanted to go."
,,Love the SG MRT!,5.0,,"My last Singapore visit was last March 2019 but my husband and I are deeply grateful for the amazing chance to live in Sg for 3 years, 2009 to 2012. It was great to experience Sg’s MRT. It was very easy, convenient and clean. We enjoyed getting around the city."
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,"The MRT is the best way to get around Singapore. We bought a card then topped it up when we needed it. Most trips on the MRT with the card are around 0.93 cents. You can use the same card on the buses which are just as cheap. Once you catch it a few times it’s easy to work out the routes, it stops at most tourists attractions around town."
,,Easy and cost effective way to get around,5.0,,"As with any unfamiliar city, learning how public transport works is a top priority if you want to preserve your cash. The SMRT makes it easy - you can reach most parts of the island on the very swift and efficient rail system and the integrated bus routes. To make it even easier, you can pick up a preloaded fare card from any station or one of the ubiquitous 7-11 outlets and top up as needed. Navigation is simplified by well-displayed routes and announcements trackside and onboard."
,,The Best system.,5.0,,"I always enjoy go from A to B in Singapore, the convenient of the MRT is the Best, it's very convenient, tidy, clean, well systematic and the people are so polite."
,,Great improvement in train regularity,4.0,,"As a part time surveyor monitoring SMRT train regularity, I’m quite impressed with the big improvements in the regularity on the East-West line for the past 1 year. There were hardly any breakdowns and more often than not, passengers could board trains at the first instance without having to wait for the next one. At the very most, they could board the next train which would come within the next 2 or 3 minutes. Keep up the good work SMRT."
,,Really easy to use transport system,5.0,,This is up there with the majority of transit systems in the world. Its colour codes makes it simple and you can use ticket machines in a variety of languages. Cheap to use and easy to navigate.
,,lifeline of singapore,5.0,,It is one of the best developed mass transport which criss cross connect whole singapore. You can reach great distance at a throw away price ... Very disciplined . Only hich up late night .
,,Whisk away,5.0,,Having travelled on London Underground this is in a different league. Clean and So friendly and SO good for disabled travellers. A lift at every station and toilets too. Fabulous - it really makes a trip to Singapore sing !
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,This was one of the best rail network experiences we have had. Only ever had to wait 3 minutes for a train. Very cheap and they are so clean and efficient.
,,Easy As,5.0,,"SMRT is fantastic. Trains arrive every 3- 5 minutes so no need to worry about timetables. Like the London Underground the different lines are colour coded so it's easy to work out which station you need to change at and so on. Plenty of electronic boards on the platform telling you where the next train is going, next station and so on. Carriages immaculately clean and seem vey new. Electronic displays over the doors tell passengers what the next stop is, which side to exit etc.
Fares seem very cheap. We bought a reloadable card with $7 credit on it and it lasted all of our 6 day trip in Singapore. My children went off to Universal Studios on Sentosa one day and needed to reload the card to do that- easy to do at kiosks but unfortunately $10 is the minimum reload so they still had a bit on their cards when we left. Perhaps a smaller reload amount might be useful. Otherwise I couldn't fault the system. Staff we dealt with on our first day purchasing our cards etc very friendly and helpful."
,,Clean and easy,5.0,,"Riding on the SMRT is very customer friendly. The buses are so clean! Mass transit is affordable here, so it is the way to get from one place to the next."
,,daily routine,5.0,,"very convenient for all passengers especially the travelers. they provide facilities it keeps world-class standards, very safe and time and money saving mode of transport."
,,"Clean, fast, and easy",5.0,,Great MRT system! I bought a 3-day pass and have used it several times already. Excellent way to get around Singapore.
,,Urban planner in the city,5.0,,"This is one of the most efficient was transit system I have used. It is clean, safe, timely, and cost efficient. The best way to see the city for those of us who love to visit cities around the world."
,,A breeze,4.0,,This system is so easy to use and the signage at each station and on the trains is brilliant. The trains and stations are spotless. The frequency of each train is fantastic. I’d recommend getting a card to make travel easy. We got ours from a service centre at the station
,,"Very easy to use, and cheap",5.0,,"The mrt is well with using - most trips only cost about a dollar and the maps and signage are very easy to navigate. You can buy a card for a small cost ($5?) and then top it up when needed. On buses you need to tap both in and out, unlike in London. If you forget to tap out it’s not the end of the world, it you will get charged the maximum fare, which is about $3."
,,Excellent and affordable,5.0,,"First class, from/to the airport and around the city. Easy to navigate and good information on the screens Don't add too much funds."
,,"easy, clean and fast",5.0,,"Best MRT in world, clean, reliable and easy to find your way around. Regular train service no waiting time"
,,Easiest Transit System to Navigate,5.0,,I used only the lines from Changi to Orchid Road and to the Gardens by the Bay. Both required transfers and they were so easy to do. The trains are clean and those seats nearest the doors reserved for the elderly and/or disabled are always left unoccupied.
,,Fantastic holiday,5.0,,"Fantastic way to travel around Singapore ,so cheap,clean ,safe.Saw so many tourist attractions,Marina Bay Sands,Esplande Harbour front,Santosa beach,Clark Quey Little India,China Town and so many more."
,,Wonderful Service,5.0,,"Clean, Safe,Cheap, Rapid transit system. Co-Operative staff to guide traveler if seek any help. Life line of Singapore"
,,Cleaner than most mass transit,4.0,,The lack of chewing gum stuck to the mrt is amazing. And they have lines showing you where to stand to board the train. There are signs inside which light up to tell you which doors are opening and the stations coming up. Buying a ticket was not difficult and the map is quite easy to read. Lots of people take the mrt and the system seems to work well.
,,Does its job,5.0,,"If you're a tourist to Singapore, the MRT is your best bet at touring the city state. Its easy to maneuver but best to do it at off peak hours. Early morning and late afternoon/ evening commutes are not the most pleasant."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"It is everything you hear. Fast, frequent, very clean and orderly. Easy to find your way round as the signage is clear"
,,Top notch public transport,5.0,,"I've used Singapore's MRT many times, and it is incredibly easy to use, efficient, fast, safe, clean, and affordable. Even the least confident and inexperienced traveler will be able to use this system with ease."
,,EFFIECIENCY AT ITS BEST,5.0,,From the airport to our hotel and travelling to and fro - using the MRT was safe easy and great way to see the city. The coaches are clean and on time.
,,"best in the world, except maybe next to JP n HK",4.0,,"ask any SG, some will complain about it, some will say its the best. i guess it depends on the person's outlook in life, as with most public goods in this world. having taken subways in many parts of the world, i'd say its one of the better ones. train faults last few yrs not withstanding, the service/cleanliness/comfort/price of the trains is pretty high. tad bit crowded during rush hours, but which public transport isn't? a pretty fast and reliable way of getting around in SG, esp during rush hour."
,,Easy bus and train,5.0,,Easy to use bus and train in Singapore- best to get a travel card though as it saves having to count your small change.
,,"Fast, easy & clean",5.0,,Very easy way to get around the city. Multiple lines cover all the major attractions. All information is in english so you should not get lost.
,,"Train service breakdown frequently, overcapacity while fare continuously increasing",2.0,,"Train service breakdown frequently, overcapacity while fare continuously increasing. Been to other more densely populated cities but somehow they managed much better with no service interruption experience"
,,Great way to move around,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is very safe, cheap, fast and runs frequently. It is widely used by locals and can be crowded especially during rush hours. It’s also a way to cool you down."
,,Revisit the technology and requirements,2.0,,What was new ages ago can’t be relevant now. SMRT should keep up with technology and introduce new initiatives. Just maintaining and carrying on but charging increasing price does not justify.
,,Excellent underground train service,5.0,,"The whole mass rapid transit (MRT) is completely driverless. When the trains travel below ground, all platforms are enclosed and, the doors open exactly in tandem with those on the trains. Destinations are announced before arrival at the next station. All the coaches are air-conditioned. Single tickets can be purchased with cash at all the MRT stations. It is more convenient to purchase a travel card and to credit cash into the card as and when needed. Cleaners are present frequently to keep all the stations spotless. A quick way to travel within Singapore if one is not too bothered about missing all the sight and sounds of this beautiful Island State."
,,Always clean and perfect!,5.0,,I lived in Singapore for four years...I took it every day! One of the best services in the World! You can try!
,,Birthday,5.0,,"Four of us where celebrating a 70th and 80th Birthday. A week in Singapore and we booked a three day pass twice for the MRT and bus service It was fantastic we traveled all over Singapore the service is so efficient,no waiting time. Outstanding"
,,World class,5.0,,Singapore is small but the Mass Rapid Transit system is great! Inexpensive and highly effective besides being inexpensive. One of the cleanest and best organized in the world by many standards
,,affordable and clean,5.0,,"As what Singapore is famous for.... .. even her public transport is very clean. Very affordable too. took the train from my hotel to Gardens by the bay, very fast and didnt wait for long."
,,Best transport system ever,5.0,,We have managed to get round Singapore far better than any other city. The trains are fast and frequent. The only place we didn’t get to with it was the zoo as we were concerned it was too far out and we might get lost. Instead we booked a tour for it and glad we did as we got caught in the middle of the thunderstorm.
,,Smooth,5.0,,This modern subway system is very user friendly and easy to use. The staff spread all over as well as the people in the ticket office are very service oriented . All this makes the usage of the subway excellent. One can purchase day ticket(s) which makes it easy to get around.
,,Makan Rest Tidoh,3.0,,Yup. MRT means Makan Relax Tidoh (tidoh - sleep). Seriously crowded during peak hours and sometimes slowdown or worse... breakdown. Where all these people come from?!
,,well connected,5.0,,SMRT is well connected through out singapore and very easy to use since lots of information provided.
,,Almost perfect....,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT(Mass Rapid Transit) must surely rank as among the best in the world. clean, tidy, this on-time mode of travel is to be used and used and used. everyone is cheerful as the train whizzes by. cheap and affordable too."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT),5.0,,very easy to use it. buy mrt card and load money. then use it. another thing the validity of mrt card is 5 years. but if you collect rest of money from ur mrt card then it will be blocked and you cannot use it further.
,,Awesome train system MRT,5.0,,So efficient and convenient!! I used the app SG MRT for an even better experience! Great prices too!
,,Transportation,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is one of the most convenient, effective and efficient modes of transport. The trains are very clean and nicely maintained with excellent 3-4 minutes frequency and convenient changeover stations from one segment to another.
The communication of stations and interchange junctions is excellent."
,,Travel by SMRT,5.0,,"Whether I take the Tube (MRT) or the bus I would like to recommend both as they are both very punctual & they touch all points in Singapore. The beauty of taking the bus is that there isn't much distance between the two consecutive stops.
The only problem (say about 5%) is that a few of the drivers understand only Chinese. The Singaporeans are very friendly & hence one of them would come forward to translate for you what the driver is trying to communicate.

Rest is all okay. Highly recommended."
,,Smooth Sailing,5.0,,"I commute to work via the Mrt. It is Smooth, clean and fast. Of course it is pack during peak hours. Try to avoid if you can, especially with prams, cos peole are rushing to work. Aircon is nice and cool. It will have the occasional breakdown, but that is alright, cos the Mrt is quite old but well maintained."
,,One of the best MRTs in the world,5.0,,"Such a nice, clean, timely MRT service Singapore has. Pretty on time, hardly gets delayed, No food, beverages allowed inside , otherwise it causes heavy fine, helps to keep the MRT so tidy. Station and MRT trains both has 3-4 languages used for direction and other useful information. English is always present and announcements also are made in English along with Chinese/Malay and sometimes Tamil."
,,Relatively Easy to navigate,4.0,,"With just google map in hand, u’ll be able to travel from a station to the next.
While over the years new stations and new smart lines have been added, navigation is relatively manageable, just follow the signages in the stations to bring u to the next lines. Pretty much self explanatory, just like that of the subways in Seoul. Oh and the stations are generally very clean!"
,,MRT circle line,4.0,,Very good rail system in Singapore fast and clean. Very comfortable and efficient service on average 1 min waiting time. Very safe as well.
,,Superbly fast and on time,5.0,,Very detail and easy planning for our journeys within Singapore. Out of Sentosa island to Vivo city....must go mall for shopping. Extensive and can be like a maze.
,,"Convenient, safe and inexpensive",5.0,,Transport in Singapore in not expensive for a major city but the MRT is a great way to get around and it doesn't cost much.

,,Easy to navigate and get around the city,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is one of the best subway systems in the world. So easy to get around the city and very easy to figure out which train you need. Visitors can buy an unlimited rides 3 day pass for a very reasonable S$20.
,,"Its efficient, fast despite complains from the locals",4.0,,"The subway/train system received many flax from the small number of local because of breakdowns, crowded trains etc.

On the contrary, the breakdown is not so often as claimed by the complaining lot. On the average there only one breakdown once in a blue moon. Overcrowding is overhyped. This only happen during peak hours from 7am to 10am. Other than its fine

Trains’ interior are clean and spacious. Overall its a good and cheap way ti travel around the island."
,,A Very Convenient Public Transport,5.0,,"Fast and very convenient public transport. The train stations are clean, and very kid and handicapped-friendly. Also the stations are very well-thought of the locations, near to the residents, malls, etc. Just a bit crowded during rush hours but still manageable."
,,A Great Day Out,5.0,,The Zoo was a great experience and well worth the whole day to have a good look around. The animals have plenty of room and you got to experience a lot of the exhibits first hand. Well looked after and perfect for families as well. A must if you are in Singapore.
,,Public transport with no traffic,4.0,,Fast and effective than road transport. But it's crowded like any thing now a day's. Some time we have to leave the first train. Then only we get the chance to board the second train.
,,Very Good public transport system,4.0,,"takes across the country to almost all the places with connecting buses etc, one of the best transport systems I have come across"
,,Excellent Public Transport Ever,5.0,,"When I was arrived at Changi Airport, I rush into MRT Station between Terminal 2 & 3. At first, I’m impressed with this public facility, it’s clean, extremelly cheap and fast. I use Singapore Tourist Pass for 3 days so I can use MRT, LRT and busses for unlimited travel all days.

,,Amazingly Efficient.,5.0,,"As a first time visitor to Singapore i was so impressed with the Singapore MRT, it was cheap, clean, fast, and efficient.

,,Excellent,5.0,,"Honestly, one of the best public transport that I have ridden on. The trains are fast and very convenient. If you're a traveler in the area, you wouldn't get lost as such the stations provide very easy signages and fast train rides. Overall trip was convenient."
,,Easy to use.,5.0,,Trains are on time & clean. Tickets are easy to purchase at the stations or purchase a card to tap on & off.
,,System works but ticketing challenges,3.0,,"Undoubtably the mass transit system works well, but the ticket purchasing and reloading is a real hassle for tourists so much information is required but he cannot know. There is no one to ask. The tickets don’t take credit cards and only take cash notes in less than $10. You get the drift..."
,,Easy and Cheap to get to Airport,5.0,,This must be the best Airport Transfer ever. So easy and only $2.50 to travel from the city to Changi
,,awesome transit system,5.0,,who would’ve known you have a choice of not being out in the sun or rain. it’s climatized and on time too^^ among other options i highly recommend using the underground should you want to experience more of singapore and why it is considered one of the most advanced countries in the world!
,,So Easy!!,5.0,,"Wish we had this sort of public transport in Brisbane, I'd be on it all the time. It's so easy to use and so clean, you feel safe. I would feel comfortable with my teenagers travelling without me! It's just fantastic!! Someone asked me yesterday what my favourite thing in my Singapore visit was and I actually said the MRT!!"
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,"As someone who has never liked using the tube in London this was such a wonderful experience! the stations are so clean, efficient and very well sign posted. Getting around Singapore is so easy and cheap on the MRT, you cannot go wrong! staff at each of the stations were extremely helpful and polite."
,,So much better than it used to be,5.0,,I used to live in Singapore and the MRT was a bit of a one trick pony with only a couple of lines. It was really useful this time. Well done.

,,"simple, cheap, reliable, easy to find your way",5.0,,"used mrt and bus a lot. very easy to manage, everything is well explained in the stations and in the mrt cars itself. bus drivers are friendly and will help you in case of doubts to exit at your station (all the drivers we met spoke good english). bus, subway and all stations are super clean. lets keep it this way and follow the instructions: no food, no drinks inside."
,,"Quick, cool travel around Singapore",5.0,,We were only in Singapore for a few days but even so its hot and humid and most hotels have underground connections to the SMTR so you can get around quickly less the heat and humidity
,,Easy to Use and Fast,5.0,,The SMRT is the best way to get around Singapore. It is fast and efficient. The trains run frequently and are clean and comfortable. Plenty of stops to make sure you can get almost anywhere. Next time I will MRT to the airport.
,,I am from New York City,5.0,,"Possibly every transit system is better than New York. However, the MRT is affordable, clean and the staff is helpful. The subway system is very easy to navigate. The best thing is the passengers using the system follow the rules! Please come to New York and fix our subways!"
,,Punctual and Accessible,5.0,,"The MRT is everywhere and they run every few minutes. You can but your tickets a the stations and get them for a single journey. We didnt realise until after our second journey you can top up the paper tickets, and get a refund on unspent dollars. A very good system for tourists."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,The MRT is so easy to use. We just topped up the card each time we wanted a trip. We used cash for this. So clean and so efficient. Never waited more than 4 minutes for a train.
,,"Very easy to get around, just tap and go",5.0,,"Rather then the overpriced tourism day passes, just go to any convenience store (or also at the airport) to purchase a card with S$5 deposit and $5 already loaded on the card. From then on you can add money at the MRT stations and every time you tap in or out (which is when they charge based on distance) you can see your balance. I used Google Maps-public transit to navigate myself around. The plus of these cards is you get refund any extra $ left vs the tourism cards. MRT was clean, orderly, on time throughout my trip. Screens show you when the next train is coming and even how full it is. Inside the train stops that are coming or that you are at are lit with lights. An amazing public transit system."
,,Nice zoo,5.0,,"Very very nice Zoo, with so many animals, it is a very large Zoo, you can see all the kinds of animals ib this Zoo"
,,Best way to get around in the city,5.0,,"Well planned, cheapest and convenient mode of transport in Singapore.

,,Worst taxis in Asia?,1.0,,"Getting around by taxi in Singapore is a nightmare. They do change overs at all hours, so no concept of you park at the rank you take someone. All old, rude, Chinese uncles. Be prepared to sit at a rank and watch 50% of cabs not stop.

Secondly, a significant proportion only take cash...welcome to 1999."
,,best MRT in the world,5.0,,"simply the best, cheapest and most customer friendly city train service in the world London is the worst, Singapore the best! clean, air conditioned, always on time, wifi, cheap just amazing"
,,"Clean, convenient, safe and on time",5.0,,"The trains are on time, and timing notice are accurate. The trains are clean. There's quite a lot of exit that conveniently connect to a lot of shopping malls and hotels that you generally don't have to worry about getting drenched when it's raining."
,,"I Feel Sorry to Have this as Rank 1 in this ""Things to Do"" List",3.0,,"I am not saying the MRT system of Singapore bad. To me, it's good, air con adequate, compartment inside clean, staff available for guidance, price acceptable (but it's not that environment friendly as paper tickets are still used for one-off single ride).

Just that, it's not WOW! In particular, I don't agree a common transport system (as many other countries have) can beat and win over all other scenic spots or attractions in Singapore. Aren't there other spots worth praising about in Singapore and thus people have to find a transport system to hype?! To me, there're so many world class attractions in Singapore eg zoo, safari, the baobao tree like indoor establishment etc.

To have an ordinary public transport vehicle ranked top one here is an irony, downgrading all other beauties of attractions that Singapore has."
,,One of the best subway systems in the world!,5.0,,Trains are always on time and come so frequently there’s no better way to get around Singapore. All subways have directions to significant landmarks which makes getting around stress free.
,,The best public transport system I have used.,5.0,,The best public transport system I have used. interlinks with bus services and works faultlessly with gothere.sg app
,,Punctual and smooth,5.0,,"Excellent connectivity, amazing punctuality and very convenient. All stops are also very well positioned keeping the convenience of public as a priority."
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,"We used the MRT everyday to get around Singapore and it was so easy to use and follow and we didn’t get lost once! There are MRT customer service attendants on every platform to help. When we 1st arrived at the station we weren’t sure what to do and and a lady explained how it all worked in including how to buy a ticket etc. I’ve been coming to Singapore for the past 30 years and this is the 1st time I’ve used MRT and I loved it, I’ll never use another taxi again."
,,Fantastic service,5.0,,A great service. Easy to use. Lots of signage around so you know where to go. Cheap and you can use your credit card to tap on and off. Don’t bother with tourist passes as we did quite a bit of training around and only spent $4-7 a day each. Clean safe and frequent. Easy to use to and from the Changi airport.
,,Fast and clean and lots of seating expecially for the old and disabled,5.0,,People were very courteous in giving up their seat for the disabled and old like myself. No one was hiding behind their newspaper to hide the fact that they should give up their seat.
,,Absolutely brilliant transport service,5.0,,"We used the MRT every day while in Singapore for 12 days. So very clean in the stations, easy to use, trains are frequent and spotless. People are very respectful of their elders and we were offered seats in every journey. Cannot praise the MRT enough!"
,,Smooth Operator,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is so convenient, cheap and easy to use, what a country to implement Quality infrastructure for the residence and tourist to enjoy. Well Done Singapore."
,,Wow,5.0,,"The MRT system is great, clean, convenient, safe and there are stations everywhere. We used it each day of our week long holiday in Singapore & just loved how easy it was to get around."
,,Great way to travel around,5.0,,Cheap and excellent. Travel from the airport to the city centre for about $2.50. Very easy to navigate too.
,,The World Best,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT provides the best ever experience for traveling in the city. Most comfortable, punctual even with following connections. Any corner of Singapore is completely covered by the MRT. You might have to walk a lot but you will get wherever you want. The staff is very helpful. The MRT is quite economical."
,,Excellent public transport system,5.0,,MRT is clean safe and cheap. A very efficient way to get around the city and to and from the airport. Just need to check the map to find out where to change trains. Wise to double check for the cheapest way to travel especially if only in Singapore for a few days.
,,"Fast, efficient and easy to use",5.0,,"Throughout the whole of our five day stay in Singapore we used the MRT. We found it to be fast, efficient and easy to use. There are no long waits and both stations and trains were extremely clean and safe."
,,"Highly efficient, affordable public transit",5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, it is best to buy a Tourist pass from the airport subway station (Changi Airport and other MRT stations, self served kiosk) so that many parts of the city can be reached and essentially, it provides unlimited travels. The pass is around $10/day, and let you go on subway and buses. The SMRT is efficient, and runs from 5:30am till around midnight everyday.

The subway routes cover most of the city and it does not take long to go from one place to the next. It is much cheaper and faster than renting a car or taking a taxi, even taxi rides are relatively inexpensive. The SMRT tries to keep it clean and thus, there is no eating or drinking on the subways or the waiting platforms. If you choose to bring a Starbucks, there will be a $500 fine! Watch out.

Tourists who are going to Sentosa Island (Universal Studio, beaches, Casinos) may have to buy the slightly more expensive option but it is still a great deal"
,,Super efficient transport,5.0,,"The MRT proved super efficient in getting us around Singapore. We had one day and a very busy schedule. Our Hotel (One Farrer) was right at the station. We used a day Tourist Pass and got to everywhere we wanted to visit in good time. Services were very safe, frequent, the carriages are spotlessly clean and comfortable enough and the network is comprehensive and easy to navigate. We also used MRT to and from the airport beating the traffic and the taxi fees. I recommend, tourists particularly, using this service."
,,Just Brilliant,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 5 days and the MRT was all we used ,brought a S$30 ticket on arrival at Changi airport and when we left 5 days later we still had S$5.76 left on the card after countless trips .
The MRT is sutch a quick and easy way of getting around Singapore with clean trains & stations, with the ease of getting around Singapore I would highly recommend the MRT"
,,Very Convenient !!!,5.0,,MRT runs in the Heart of the City. Very helpful. Helpful to reach Sentosa Island (upto Harbour Front).
,,The best way to move around,5.0,,"It is cheap and it takes you close to all the touristic places. If you like to walk in the cities you visit, we don't recomended you to buy the 30 dolar/ 3 day option they have. With my husband we managed to spend 10 dolars in 2 days...because we like to walk, and we only used it maximum 4 times a day."
,,Singapore MRT is very good,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is one of the means of transportation that connects all places in Singapore. If we stay 3 days and many locations to travel, it is recommended to buy the Singapore Tourist Pass (STP) for 30 Singapore dollars, because it can be used to travel anywhere without limits either with MRT, buses, etc. If the first new ride on the MRT is recommended to bring a map to make it easier to find a destination, it would also be good to learn about the various types of lines that exist as well as places of destination. All the places we will go to are clearly printed on the sign, so we only need to find out how to understand them and follow the instructions. Tourists are expected to prepare physically because they will often walk straight or up and down the escalator or stairs. Singapore MRT is very helpful for tourists, so use it when traveling to Singapore."
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,"This is an efficient and low cost way to get around Singapore. Lines have colour codes, and is a really simple system to use. Trains are very clean. Buy a card at the station, makes it under a $ per trip"
,,Nice service,5.0,,great service and great people of Singapore Nice and and excellent atmosphere. will be nicer if hv nore lines
,,Dependable connectivity,4.0,,"Surface transport is always slow in any city, and same is the case with the city-state of Singapore. Luckily, about half the country is connected by Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Singapore's name for the Tube/Underground/Metro transport system. Trains are clean, driverless and air-conditioned. But even the MRT gets overcrowded during peak hours. There are reserved seats for the differently abled, pregnant and senior citizens. Problem is that such persons cannot reach those seats during rush hours."
,,The epitome of efficiency!,5.0,,"The MRT represented a fine way for us to move around during our recent stay, even for shorter trips , for example from the Raffles City Shopping Complex to the Fullerton Hotel. The Stations were clean and well-signposted. They were easy to use and models of quick, convenient service."
,,Best way to get round Singapore,5.0,,"This is by far the best way to get around Singapore. It’s cheap each journey $1.60, clean, efficient and fast."
,,Efficient and Clean,5.0,,"The MRT is the best way to go around the island, and it’s efficient and clean. The attendants at the stations are also typically informed – some better than others – but everyone is typically friendly and helpful.
-----
We researched quite extensively on the most economical way to get around the island on the train, and it was perplexing and frustrating trying to find complete and clear information regarding the variety of travel cards available. Even enquiring in person at the service counters was not very helpful.
Here’s our research/experience …
Basically, if you’re in Singapore for a few days and WILL visit many tourist attractions, and need to hop and off several stops a day, then getting the Singapore Tourist Pass is best. If you plan on walking around more than hopping on and off public transport, getting a Standard Ticket is better.

A Standard Ticket is valid for 6 trips – with no stored value – you need to charge it by buying a ticket (at a machine at the station) each time you travel. Basically, it’s more of a temporary travel pass/paper card and NOT a ticket per se. Not the most cost-effective per trip but it’s best if you’re just using it for a daily return trip.

An ez-link card is a stored value travel card with a non-refundable fee for the cost of the card. Details can be found on the Singapore LTA website — though the site needs a good edit and re-structure, and also re-write of some of its content to be clearer and more informative."
,,Top train system,5.0,,"With trains departing on all lines every five or so minutes, it's easy to get anywhere in the city. Signage is clear, trains are super clean, the stations feel very safe, and our city could sure take a lesson or two on how to run an underground from these guys!"
,,Envy,5.0,,"Every time I travel on the MRT, I can't help wondering about the amount of money spent on its construction and the beautifully finished stations. I wish we had one."
,,Fantastic System,5.0,,"For us the MRT is our preferred mode of transport in Singapore. It is convenient, prompt at all times of the day and night. The service itself is amazing. The trains are super clean, safe and you know where you are and what the next stations are. Each line is colour coded so you can easily work out which line you need. The internal signage inside the actual trains is fantastic - so you know which stations are coming up. It even tells you which side of the train you exit. The 3 day pass which allows tourists to travel all day long is superb value and easy to use. The MRT is the best system in the world."
,,Way better than the tube,5.0,,Cleanest most efficient metro system we've ever come across. Super cheap as well which makes getting around Singapore easy.
,,Ease of travel,4.0,,A very easy and convenient mode of travel. Tickets can be purchased through kiosks. A good option in city but I believe Delhi Metro is better considering footfall.
,,Easy to get around,4.0,,"We have used the MRT many times during our stays and found it quick, easy and clean. We purchased cards and were able to top up when needed with cash or card. $10 min to top up and $3 min to travel."
,,Economical fast service,5.0,,"A 2 day pass is 16 Singapore dollars per person. There is a small amount of tax on top of that. You have to buy a travel card and when you return the travel card you get the cost of the card returned to you

This mode of transport is very very clean. No food or drink is allowed ."
,,Very Convenient and Clean,5.0,,The MRT system of Singapore is something her neighboring countries definitely envy. It’s very clean and always on time. Stations are strategically across SG. Very easy to understand the routes and there’s always someone from the MRT ready to assist you.
,,Brilliant transport system,5.0,,We used the MRT each day while we were on holiday in Singapore. The MRT is spotless and the trains run like clockwork. It is easy to get about and there is no over crowding even at peak times. The trains are comfortable and spotless. There are options for buying tickets. There is a 3 day tourist pass which costs $10 per day and there is a $10 deposit that you get back on day 5. A great way to travel.

,,EASY,5.0,,"Its the most convenient way to get around most places in Singapore. Best to buy a stored value ticket and some hotels ( IBIS for one) lend you a zero value ticket for you to load up and use during your stay. 5 and under travel free no ticket needed, but you must go through the package/large luggage gates which are monitored normal by a guard."
,,Not great...Credit Cards not excepted,2.0,,My experience was not that great at SMRT when first time I visited I was having credit card and high denomination currency only. The lady at ticket booking window told me that I can only get tickets through auto ticketting machine and so I waiyed in queue to get ticket from machine but when my turn came I was wondered that I needed to insert small denomination currency according to ticket price which was around singaporean $5. But I was not having these. I requested the lady to provide small denomination currency or ticket but she was very rude. Not a good first time experience.

,,Clean and efficient way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"This is the cleanest rapid transit system I have ever encountered. All the signs/announcements are in English, so it's very easy to use and not get lost. I highly recommend using the SMRT for inexpensive travels around Singapore."
,,"Easy to navigate, great value and clean",5.0,,"We purchased the unlimited tourist pass for two days. Great value with unlimited MRT and Bus access. System is easy to navigate and very, very clean. Don't be afraid to give it a try. One item of note, the airport line closes at 2200, so if you land after that this is not an option."
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,"Smooth connectivity in the entire Singapore with neat and clean platforms. I spent the entire day travelling in MRT and in just SGD 10 Smartcard, I have covered Little India, Chinatown, Novena, Clark Quay, Bugis Street and Harbourfront"
,,Easy to use and very cheap,5.0,,"I spent a whole week using SMRT on a daily basis, multiple trips a day. The trips are so cheap. It is easy to use, once you get the hang of the different lines. There are multiple apps you can use to get you from A to B as easily as possible. A $30 loaded card covered the whole week, don't buy the tourist cards."
,,Cheap and easy Changi Airport to City,5.0,,"The cheapest way to get to the city from the airport, or visa-versa is to use the MRT. No need to buy a ticket, just use your contactless bank card or credit card - just tap and go. The MRT is easy and cheap to use. All trains are air conditioned. Depending on where you’re going to/ coming from, it will take 45-55 min.
There are two metro options from the Airport station located between terminals 2 and 3:
Hop on and go ONE stop then change (just walk across the platform) to the BLUE line train.
Or travel TWO stops and change (3-4min walk) to GREEN line."
,,Perfect for seeing Singapore,5.0,,"Except for using Grab to and from our hotel and for one other instance, we used the SMRT to get us all over Singapore. We went to Chinatown, Little India, Marina Bay, you name it and we could get there via SMRT. Cheap and easy using our passes."

,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Definitely don't be afraid to use this, easy transportation to and from Airport and around SIngapore and over to Sentosa.

Best to purchase an ezlink travel card from a ticket office $5.00 for the card then what ever you want to put on it further top ups are a minimum of $10 but you can get a refund on any unused amount at the end of your stay. Travel is very cheap using this card $1.80 from Airport to downtown area! Lots of stations which are well signposted around the City and in the Shopping malls"

,,We love this mass transit system,5.0,,"My partner and I love in NYC and are regular MTA Subway riders. We have also traveled extensively and have used mass transit in Montreal, Vancouver, London, Paris, and Portland OR. Of all the various systems we have used, and while I'm a big fan of the 500 station strong NYC MTA, is have to say Singapore wins as the best hands down.
It's clean, modern, convenient, reliable, comfortable, easy to use, and efficient.
Customer service is superb.. at least inasmuch as we have ever interacted with them. Very safe too."
,,An Amazing Experience,5.0,,"We have traveled many places across the globe, though Singapore has one of the best public transport systems we have ever encountered. It became a game of how least a time we had to wait between trains. They are incredibly fast and efficient. They do get busy around peak work times, though it is all about the experience."
,,Very easy and cheapest mode of transport,5.0,,"We went to Singapore for our family leisure trip of 5 days along with 2 kids of 6yrs old. You can by EZ link card from any MRT station for all the individuals. For children below 7 years you can get complimentary EZ link card from selected MRT stations. Due to some wrong information, we had to buy chargeable card for our kids, but actually below 7years it's complimentary. Maps are very convenient to understand even for the first timers. We used Sing MRT app where in you can simply put your nearby MRT and your destination, you will get all details which MRT and how to go, it's really easy and signboards are self explanatory.
We thoroughly enjoyed our journey.
And the same EZ Link card you can use for Buses as well as for shopping at 7-11 shops."

,,"Very quick, easy to navigate, and cheap",5.0,,"Don't waste money on taxis or time in traffic. Hope on the mrt and go basically anywhere you need to. All attractions and shopping are connected to the mrt. Including the airport.
Don't worry about listening to the train guides, they are not very good. Just scan your credit card or bank card on the paywave entry gate and then use the mrt line map to figure out where to get on and off to get to your desired station.
Scan again to leave and you pay about 2.50 a trip.

So easy and get there in a quarter of the time."
,,Deserving of its Reputation for Ease of Use,5.0,,"This public transport system has to be among the cleanest, most efficient, well sign posted and reasonably priced conveyance on the planet. Am so glad it was recommended to me...saves a lot of tiring walking in this humid city"

,,Super easy MRT,5.0,,"We purchased 3 day tourist passes for S$30 (S$10 is refunded when you return the card).

,,"Efficient, Clean and Dependable",4.0,,"I have been using the Singapore MRT (train and bus) for about 1.5 years. I have never experienced a major delay nor have I been stranded during my commute. The system is very clean, extremely safe and inexpensive. You can get an MRT card at any station for a small fee which includes the processing fee for the card and about $5 of travel credits. One word of warning when riding the bus, make sure you scan in as you enter and very important to scan out as you exit, otherwise you will be charged maximum fare for that line.

Pocket size maps of the various lines can been found in all stations for reference.

Another helpful tip is to download app call city mapper which will guide you from place to place and tell you very accurately which train, bus or walking route to use."

,,best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Yes the cabs are nice but this is the cleanest, on time and best transit system I have ever encountered. It was spick and span clean.

Be sure to purchase a 3 day tourist pass at only $20 (singapore dollars)"
,,"Clean, Fast and Convenient",5.0,,"We used the SMRT during our recent stay in Singapore. We had a station within 100 meters of our Hotel and used it extensively.

Just bought a Tourist Pass at one of the machines and spent 5 minutes Looking at the whole map, checking where the airport was and where my hotel was and I was ratty to use the whole MRT system.

So easy to use for 1st time travelers to Singapore. Routes and directions clearly marked at every station and in the trains themselves. Changing lines at stations is so easy with your travel path from one line to the next clearly marked and color coded.

They have done a fine job designing and building this system."
,,So good,5.0,,"The hardest thing about using the MRT is getting the right exit when you surface! They are so big you could end up on one of the many surrounding streets. Apart from that they are so quick and easy to use even if you need to change lines. And you never have long to wait for a train. I love the fact that the platforms are inclosed, theres no possible way to fall on the tracks and everthing is so clean."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"I have NEVER seen a subway/train system that is so efficient, safe, and clean. Do not shy away from using the MRT to get around Singapore. It is easy. We opted for a three day tourist pass for 30.00 with a $10.00 refund. We then started doing just by trip and that was very economical.
I laughed when TripAdvisor listed the MRT as a top attraction but it really is."
,,Clean stations,4.0,,"Very clean stations. Some locations are difficult to find, but once you are in the system, it is very efficient."
,,"Easy, clean and cheap",5.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore. The MRT offer tourist passes for unlimited travel, worthwhile doing. We used the MRT to get around town and couldn’t believe how clean and efficient it was. Highly recommended"
,,Surviving Singapore,5.0,,"Walking around Singapore is not unlike swimming your way through warm bath water. For a quick, efficient alternative to getting around the island, there is the MRT. Stations are new and spotless with more than sufficient air conditioning. Trains arrive about every three minutes and do move from point to point rapidly. Available for tourists are one, two, and three day passes providing you unlimited travel which are definitely worth buying. Why get tied up in traffic in a taxi or the local Uber alternative. The MRT will get you to most places worth going to on the Island."
,,"Clean, Safe, and Good Access to Sites",5.0,,MRT was very easy to use and clean. Purchase the plastic card to avoid the lines at ticket purchase. It is well worth the $5 fee.
,,Amazing public transport,5.0,,"Singaporeans complain a lot about the mrt. But I used public transport on three different continents and the SMRT ranks in the top 3. Clean, efficient and cheap."
,,"Efficient, cheap, fast, & clean",5.0,,"Exactly what the title says, even on the weekend and evenings only a 5min wait between trains. Need an MRT card and most rides costed us around S$0.89, can use to take the train to Sentosa as well. Much easier than taking a taxi and MUCH cheaper."
,,Great,5.0,,"Really convenient and inexpensive way to get around town. Fast , clean and efficient! Especially useful when taxis are in short supply."
,,Great for getting around,5.0,,"We used this service minimally but it is so well run, a train leaves every 5 minutes. Once you get the hang of it, it is easy to use. As more mature tourists there was no seniors fare like other SE Asian countries have and with the strictly governed taxi service and grab I found it not really a cheap way of getting around. However it is much faster and you are not stuck in traffic and very clean. Singapore runs very smoothly!"
,,Clean and Reliable,4.0,,"The MRT network in Singapore is dense, it covers most attractions and a lot of large malls have direct access internally with MRT. The contactless card can be bought at any 24/7 and can be recharged at all station kiosks with both cash and cards. The trains were clean and well maintained with announcements in multiple languages.

Only slight criticism for me would be that stations were not marked too well on the surface. Small signage that are easy to miss were in stark contrast to say London/Paris or even Delhi subway systems where you can make out a station even from a distance."
,,Still the benchmark for mass rapid transport in South East Asia,5.0,,We purchased a 2 day Singapore Tourist Card and used it extensively. My only gripe is the difficulty in redeeming the cost of the plastic itself. I really believe that Singapore could do better with this process.
,,"Cheap, clean, safe and convenient",5.0,,"Easy way to get around Singapore quickly and cheaply. Trains are air conditioned and clean. The lines I travelled (North South, East West, Circle) had trains every 3 or 4 minutes during the day. Easy to buy a ticket (machines are multi language with interactive maps to chose route and destination). Transfer stations are well sign posted to help you change lines. Taxis are cheap, but MRT is a great choice when it's raining and the to queue is long."
,,Cashless society? Not yet,3.0,,"The subway itself was great. It’s clean, safe, air-conditioned and fast. However, we couldn’t use a card to buy tickets at Bugis, and under you have almost exactly the correct change, you’re snookered. Would benefit from a London Underground type contactless system, but otherwise great."
,,MRT brilliant for getting around,5.0,,Whilst Grab and Comfort taxis offer cheap fares the MRT is fun for people watching and extremely good value... Buy a $10 link card and you're off! Services most places you want to visit. Very clean and very punctual!
,,Decently reliable,4.0,,"The service is mostly reliable. That said, smrt is usually slow to notify the public of train breakdowns and the such. They do tend to provide passable aid to those stranded with their shuttle buses tho."
,,Simple to use,5.0,,A perfect system to support sightseeing in and around Singapore. Starting from the Airport and ending up with a suitable number of fast connections
,,"Fast, frequent, and very clean.",5.0,,"Been to Hong Kong and used their rail system? This one is ""Same same, but different. Cleaner than Hong Kong's, and easier to work out where to go. Oh, and really inexpensive too."
,,Convenience,5.0,,"Excellent connectivity over Singapore plus connectivity within local areas of MRT stations, significant travel time saving."
,,Singapore MRT for sightseeing use,4.0,,"The cheapest and easiest way around Singapore city. Buy the Ezi link card definitely as you put cash on it and can use it for buses, trains, taxis and at 7 eleven, easy to top up at any station. The trains are every 4 minutes mostly and although the system of coloured lines seems complicated at first, it is easy to navigate with clear signs all in English, and good information on the train about stops and crossover stations etc. cost us 83cents(SGD) each to go 2 stations, the same at peak hour in taxi cost $11."
,,go easy,5.0,,The MRT is so convenient and cheap. Astoundingly good value plus a great life experience. Very easy to manage and information helpers everywhere
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,So easy to use. We spent five days in Singapore and used the system several times a day. Only downside is the early closing time.
,,Very convenience,4.0,,"You just need to get a ""MRT Card"", then top-up the card value. You can travel around Singapore with the card via MRT and bus. Their MRT station is clean and on-time. Please remember, no food and drinks are allowed. Cons is, take care of your elderly as their excavator is move faster than normal."

,,"Easy, quick, and clean",5.0,,"The MRT was easy to navigate and extremely clean. We found the ticket system a little confusing so purchased tickets on a one by one trip basis. It would have been nice to load the card with a certain amount and use that, but we were unsure how to do that."
,,Buy a ezilink card much cheaper than travellers card,5.0,,Easy to navigate. underground cannot see anything but really fast Cheap travel we spent S$12 all up in 4 days
,,Simple straight forward subway,3.0,,"Rides are mostly reliable, except some hiccups occasionally that wont significantly jeopardize your journey given the small city that Singapore is and also the fact that SMRT provides the FOC shuttle bus service (in replacement of the no-service if any) at all the affected stations. Sometimes, you may just get to travel around on the shuttle buses for free and see more things on ground level."
,,Excellent mode of transport,5.0,,The best way to travel around Singapore. Trains on time and no shortage of them. They operate till late night. Not too expensive. Still have my card with me.
,,Traveling,4.0,,"Smooth ride and enjoyable. Spore MRT is great for a small and packed country to allow for easy connection and transfer around the country. Its a city state so there is no village.
Visitors to Spore should enjoy the MRT and the bus system to get to sight see and real feel of the vibrant lifestyle of the citizens. Thanks"
,,Awesomeness,5.0,,"I have been on the Kew york subway , the california tube and the London trians. Singapore MRT beats all of these train services hands down"
,,"Just the best and cheapest way to get around Singapore,",5.0,,"The MRT is an amazing experience. So easy to use and so cheap to get around.

You only have to ask for help and they will oblige."
,,convenience,5.0,,"the SMRT is a convenience way to travel in Singapore. The trains are clean, safe and always punctual. For tourist you can buy tourist pass for 1 up to 3 days that can be used not only for train but other public transportation also such bus with unlimited rides."

,,VERY CLEAN AND TRAINS WERE ALWAYS ON TIME,5.0,,The SMRT is a great way to get about the city and we used it several time during our stay. It is a cost effective way to get around and the trains are always very clean and on time. I would recommend the system highly.
,,Super Easy,5.0,,"This has to be one of the best transport systems around. Trains are clean, safe and always on time. You can get a ticket from the automatic machines and reload that ticket up to 6 times. Trains are on time and frequent. The colour coded system makes it easy to find your way around and maps inside the train and announcements help to keep you informed of where you are along the way. Changing trains is also easy when a different line is required."
,,Excellent public transport,5.0,,We used the MRT daily while in Singapore and it is easy to navigate the stations and get to where you have to go for a very small cost. I wish all major cities had a public transport system as efficient and reliable as Singapore.
,,MRT.,5.0,,"Don’t be afraid to use it. It’s so easy, cheap and clean ! We used it to travel back tp the airport for our journey home. So much cheaper than a taxi and goes die t to the departure lounge."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"I used to either take taxi or shuttle bus to and from the airport to my hotel, but not anymore. The SMRT takes me to and from my hotel / airport in half an hour. It is a pleasant ride and a super value. I highly recommend it."
,,Is the Singapore SMRT a good means of transport?,4.0,,"Singapore SMRT started as one of the most efficient and cleanest public transportation to the city from various parts of the island. Other than a slight delay sometimes, it is still one of the best means of getting to and from various parts of the island at reasonably priced tickets. Just avoid the peak hours in the early morning and evenings when most workers get on and off work.
Just remember your SMRT ticket also allows you to take the public bus transport at a discounted price if you hop on to the bus within 45 mins to reach a destination that the SMRT doesn't bring you.... provided you purchase the store value card
Clean, neat and safe way of travelling round the island to major tourist attractions whether it be in the city or out at the suburbs where you can get good hawker and coffee shop food and dining that Singapore is famous for...."
,,World class beating system,5.0,,"Its great, clean, efficient, on time, quick, inexpensive and everyone is polite. Exactly how I had heard it was but it actually is!!! No food, no gum, no music, no unpleasant people. Great"
,,Best way to get around in Singapore,5.0,,Cheapest and most convenient way get around in Singapore is taking MRT. You get to pay lesser per trip if you use a store value card. This card can be purchased from all mrt station or bus station. The ticket can be used for both buses and mrt. You can TOP up the card at all self help ticketing machines. For refund of unuse amount you will need to go to a counter.
,,Daily Commuter,5.0,,"One of the best city rail transport in the world. Connects to each corner of the country, convinient and easy."
,,Always efficient,5.0,,"I came here with my kids, and honestly? i have always told them how efficient the train systems in SG are, and i even decided to show them by literally counting, and they always come on time, down to the second. maybe im lucky? but hey... also, im not sure, maybe ive always been lucky but even on what we consider peak times, it never seem to be crowded."
,,Quick and easy,5.0,,Cleanest metro in the world and so efficient - download the MRT official app to plan you route across Singapore- real value for money!!
,,"Excellent, always punctual, good reach, aircon",5.0,,"Best mode of public transport in Singapore. Download the relevant apps to help plan routes, otherwise Google Maps also provides accurate routing information."
,,Easy to use as long as you have small bank notes,5.0,,"We have been here on a weeks break and so used the MRT quite a bit, we found it clean, cool and efficient. The one problem we had was at the ticket counter, the machines would only take $5 or smaller, we only had $10 and above notes so had to find a maned counter and get our money changed, but on the great scale that wasn’t too big a burden.

Will we use it again yes
Would we recommend it yes"
,,Nice transit system,5.0,,"Singapore have a great train system that you can easily understand the system, where you want to go and where to stop."
,,Effective MRT,5.0,,Very effective MRT in Singapore. Despite the fact that quite a share of mainly locals do complain about the MRT being unreliable I have personally not experiences major issues with reliability using the MRT nearly on a daily basis. The network keeps extending as well. Can't wait for the line in the East to complete.
,,World Class Public Mass Rapid Transport System SMRT,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transport System Must be one of the best in the world. It is clean, well signed, all trains run frequently and some trains are driver-less. Seating priority is given to the elderly, pregnant and disabled."

,,Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Visited for 8 days and used the MRT to get around , downloaded the app on my phone and found the maps were brilliant for planning where I wanted to go.fast efficient .very cheap effective transport"
,,a shopping mall from one SMRT stop to the next,5.0,,"Fabulous MRT system which is clean, safe, and on-time. We often got on at the Promenade stop. It was convenient to the Pan Pacific and points we were interested in visiting. We also visited the ESPLANADE several times and used the underground mall to walk between the music stage and our hotel. Along the way we were entertained by the local folks who were also using the air-conditioned space."
,,The right transport mode,5.0,,"Getting around Singapore using the Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) is a Breeze. The rail networks are well connected. The MRT stations are within walking distance to all parts of major attractions & large Shopping centres. The ticket price is reasonable, and the rides are comfortable."
,,MRT,5.0,,"The MRT is a pleasure to use, inexpensive, incredibly clean and on time every time. The best way to use the system is to purchase a rechargeable access card. It can also be used on water taxis and buses. An overall great system."
,,Brilliant - easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Exceptionally easy transport system to use. Very clean and there is always someone around to help you if needed.
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Fast and efficient, clean environment and easy to use. Just like the rest of Singapore’s infrastructure, this works as it’s supposed to. Recommended"
,,Great system,5.0,,An easy way to get around Singapore. Visitors can purchase a 3 day pass and travel at will. The trains are clean and the locals are courteous to each other. There are special reserved seats for anyone with mobility issues.
,,"Fast, Clean and Efficient",5.0,,"SMRT is a good (if it's not the best) way to travel around Singapore. You can go fast almost anywhere you want. I recommend you to buy a SMRT card, top-up and go anywhere. The trains are clean, with good and well localised stations"
,,Perfect way to get around Singapore,5.0,,So if you need to get around quickly then the MRT is the best way. Depending on how much you will use it will determine whether its best to buy a Tourist pass or pay as you go. It's quite cheap with a ticket from the airport to down ton around S$2.40. The tourist pass costs $30 for 3 days of unlimited travel on trains and buses and the first day ends at midnight so don't start using it late in the day of you lose a full day usage. We arrived late into Singapore and just got a one way ticket for the initial trip to the hotel. You also get a $10 refund when you hand the card back in after 3 days. For the cheap cost it's just easier to buy the pass and walk straight through the turnstiles rather than buying tickets for each trip. Most stations are air conditioned and definately all the trains are. As with everything else in Singapore they are very clean and run on time. I love using public transport when on holidays and the ease of using the trains makes it part of an enjoyable holiday.
,,Best public transport,5.0,,The Singapore public transport system is the best and easiest way to get yourself about Singapore. Don’t be fooled into buying a 3 or 5 day pass at the airport. Go to a self serve ticket both at any train station ( including the airport) and buy a ticket. You can easily top it up with more credits as you need it. The same ticket can be used on trains and buses. Download the SMRT app and app will advise you which bus or train to catch and tracks your location to even tell you when to get off for you desired destination.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,I have taken public transport in multiple countries around the world. The SMRT is one of the cleanest and easiest to navigate. It is brightly lit and I felt safe at all times. We used both buses and trains and all were always on time and came at good frequencies.
,,Reliable,5.0,,Fast and reliable transport through out Singapore. Easy to navigate within stations though some take a bit of walking within the stations from platform to exits.
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"So easy to get around. If you are visiting for a few days or more and will be using MRT, ask at the service counter for a transit card you can add money to. This card cost ten singapore dollars but gives you, from memory about seven dollars on it for travelling and the fair is cheaper then paying each fair as you go. You can just top it up at the machines."
,,Slick,5.0,,"The MRT is a fabulous service. It would have been better if more staff were on hand to help tourists, especially when buying tickets."
,,SINGAPORE STANDS TALL BECAUSE OF SMRT,5.0,,"Singapore has a population of approax 5.8 Million. Its almost mandatory for all adults to go for work due to high cost of living and countries policy to make the best use of their every citizen.
So 5 million ppl transit across the city everyday which is not seen on the road. The roads are just 2 lanes in most of the places, but there was absolutely no surge of traffic or a traffic jam during our week long stay. There are so many lines of mrt traversing around and across the city. Its like bus stop and buses in Indian cities. But prompt, pollution free and carries larger no. of ppl. Walking to and fro from the stations incorporates an active lifestyle in the population. When Indian cities turning barren due to cutting down of trees and expansion of roads only to be congested by overwhelming pvt vehicles and buses, SMRT is an eyeopener. Wish its implemented in all cities in india."
,,"A safe , convenient and cheap transport neatly maintained",4.0,,"Presently, mass rapid transport has become common in many countries. So metro may not be a big tourist attraction anymore. However, due to the excellent maintenance and disciplined travellers, I would still suggest it to the visitors of Singapore."
,,"Very clean and cool. Nice directions, Need to understand their ticketing system (self help). No need to buy their MRT",5.0,,No need to get a MRT pass if travelling from A to B (for just once). Ok to purchase if staying for a longer period.

,,Easy to use and inexpensive,5.0,,Very convenient and useful. Clean and safe and a good frequency of trains. Very cheap also. There are so many lines and it will take you right to the airport also.
,,Quick and often,5.0,,There are plenty of buses and trains. You need to understand where the routes travel and the timing. Be mindful that the underground is not necessarily where the entrance is. I walked @1km from the U entrance at the main tourist bus interchange along the arcade to the nearest train.
,,LIFELINE of SGP,5.0,,"SMRT is indeed lifeline of SGP. Very convinient, punctual and amazing connectivity. We took SMRT to every tourist place and distched the tour operator provided transport."

,,convenient.,5.0,,convenient transportation system. one of the best in the world. no sweat and hassle free travel . . .
,,One of the best!,5.0,,"When I'm at Singapore, one of my favourite form of transportation is SMRT. The SMRT is so well connected, so well design and very convenient for everybody, from young ones to golden generation. The facilities provided by SMRT for the disabled are 100% perfect! So for any first timer to Singapore, I advise you guys to explore the country by using SMRT."
,,Get an ezlink card!,5.0,,"We always use our ezlink cards when we are in Singapore. We bought them ages ago and just top with 10 Sing $ when we arrive.

There are automated ticket and card top up machines on all the MRT stations. It's all in English primarily too so there are no language issues.

The journeys are so cheap that we managed a whole week of travel without spending anymore than our 10 Sing$ top-up."
,,Super,5.0,,"I landed at Changi Airport and travelled to Little India via MRT. In my 4 days in Singapore I have just taken cab once and travelled only via MRT and I guess it was super.

,,Convenient,4.0,,Easy mode of transport around Singapore. The MRT is very connected and allows me to get from one place to another at an affordable price
,,The efficient and economical way to tour Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore underground can get you to all attractions. Go for the SD 12 card which includes SD 7 travel credit. Top up at ticket machines, we spent only SD 22 each over five days. Lines are colour coded, changing lines is a pain with escalators etc.
Only negative is you see nothing in transit. Card can be used on bus system as well. Buses easily worked using Google maps which gives bus numbers and routes etc. A clean prompt system easily mastered."
,,singapore mrt,4.0,,really easy to use and very reasonable with the tourist pass - we paid 52 Singapore dollars for 48 hours (2 x 26 dollars each) but then received 20 dollars back when returned the passes to the ticket office - cheaper than the London underground!
,,Quick easy and clean,5.0,,"What a fab experience, so easy to use, so cheap to get around on. So easy to navigate and everyone is so helpful - brilliant system others should sit back and learn."
,,Why would...,5.0,,...the subway be the number one attraction in Singapore? The algorithms need some work here. It is a fantastic system and easy to get anywhere in the city.
,,Super easy to use and clean,5.0,,"Most big attractions are within a block or two from the MRT. I will compare all other mass transit to this one. We got our money’s worth out of the tourist pass card. You can turn it in at the airport and get $10 back.
So, I used the Grab app to ”plan trip” which gives train and bus routes in addition to the car hire option. The Grab app lets you view a map and gives step by step written directions of transfers and distance to walk to final destination."
,,So easy to get around!,5.0,,Singapore's SMRT is the best - just so easy to get around. Stations are clean as are the trains and they run very frequently.

,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,The MRT is so clean and efficient. The trains are separated from platforms by glass panels so the platform is clean and quiet.
,,Best metro anywhere,5.0,,The metro was so easy to use and inexpensive. We had a 3 day tourist pass which we could also use on buses. The stations and trains are clean and air conditioned. Signage makes it easy to find your way. Simple maps show how to transfer. There are often volunteers stationed to answer questions as well. Trains run very frequently. Note that escalators are very fast and to stand on the left as people pass on the right side!
,,Public transport pleasure,5.0,,"The MRT is fast, clean regular, cheap and everywhere. We bought an EZ card for our four day stay and I think that was a better option than the alternative card where you pay a fixed fee for unlimited travel. We took a lot of trips at a total cost of about $15."

Very often routes!"
,,Good,4.0,,Overall train speed is good and consistent. Train here you can't see much within city area ride. Mostly underneath train. I am impressed that I saw the train station security really went into detail they are on patrolling the station. He even use torch light to look into every detail notice board frame slot and all minor sip in area. Impressive safety concern city.

,,Quick and save,5.0,,"We really like that Metra system while it is clean, save and fast. And you can reach all interesting parts of the city."
,,The best MRT in the World,5.0,,"Perhaps Singapore is the best MRT in the world.

It’s efficient, fast, reliable and clean.

It’s mandatory that you don’t eat food and drink, but I think most people can manage doing that for their journey. Obviously, like most modes of transport in SE Asia, you’re not allowed to bring durian fruit with you!

You can get to most parts of Singapore using the MRT. If not, then you can easily jump into a bus nearest an MRT station. Most travellers / tourists will be surprised that you can get the MRT basically near the border with Malaysia, you’ll just have to jump on a bus for a 10 minute ride."
,,Most amazing train system I have ever seen...,5.0,,This is an amazing set up. Very cheap. Extremely efficient - trains every 4 minutes. Very clean. Everyone is courteous. Even foreigners like us could easily understand and use the train.

,,best way to get around Singapore!,5.0,,"SMRT is incredible!! The buses and subway system can get you all around Singapore. I was in Singapore for 3 days and used SMRT religiously. It was very clean, easy to use, and comfortable. Apple/Google Maps offer directions for places via transit which I found very helpful. Also I highly recommend getting the tourist transit pass! It lasts for 3 days and offers unlimited rides for $38 (Singapore dollars). The pass allows you to freely explore Singapore without needing to reload a card. I easily used the transit system over 15 times during my three days in Singapore which definitely made the pass worth it."
,,Great way to get around Singapore - and its all air conditioned,5.0,,"Drop into any MRT Station, go to the helpful staff and get your ezLink card and a pocket map of the system. The ezLink card can also be used on all of the buses. Its even easier to get around if you load up the Gothere ap."

,,Really good,5.0,,"Using this is very easy with well sign posted stations. The trains themselves are very clean and quite spacious. I would recommend finding which station you want ie nearest to your hotel or attraction that you are going to. Cost for single ticket between 1-2 Singapore $ , although if using throughout day best to get a day card. Stations can be large and trying to get out at an exit that you want can be difficult. Prepare to walk."
,,Cool and nice,5.0,,"Great way to travel across Singapore.Easily accessible to all. Sinages and maps at all stations.Great experience.,"
,,Systematic,5.0,,"The SMRT is definitely the backbone and soul of the city. It is absolutely systematic, easy to navigate for tourists and surely an economical choice. It’s clean, accessible and convenient for old as well as for people with physical impairments."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Apart from Japan I would regard Singapore's MRT as a fantastic way to get around Singapore. We got a three day tourist pass, which means we could hop on and off as many times as we liked for 30 Singapore dollars and when you take back the passes they give you ten dollars back. The system runs on multiple lines all going to different places but intersecting at certain stations, which means you can get around Singapore simply and cheaply. The MRT trains run every 4 Min which means no waiting around for to long to get to your next point. It will take you to all the tourist attractions in air-conditioned comfort."
,,Easy for travelers,5.0,,"I wish we had this in Australia . Was brilliant to get around Singapore . You can get a tourist card , we paid $16 for two days and could use the MRT and the buses unlimited.easy to navigate and so very clean ."
,,Train commute,5.0,,"Easiest way to get around Singapore especially in the cbd and regional centres. Cheap, fast, safe and air-conditioned"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"I believe there cannot be any words for such an amazing MRT which Singapore have got. The most economical way to commute in Singapore without hitting one's pocket only on transport. Ordinary, the ticket price ranges from SD 1-2 per trip for almost all the sectors. One can also consider buying a tourist pass which provides unlimited travel in both MRT and LRT.
The ticket issuing kiosk is very user friendly."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,We found the SMRT to be reasonably priced and easy to use. It seems to be pretty new; very clean and nice.
,,Nice,5.0,,Cool transport mode to travel across Singapore. Basically can explore singapore withing 1-2 days using mrt
,,The best,5.0,,"Having recently moved to Singapore we did not get a car as we use MRT and the buses it is super convenient. Buses and MRT are neat, clean and always on time. We started using the Moovit app and it has been a blessing u will never get lost as there is always a connection available nearby for either bus or MRT. Have to admit that Singapore has the best transit system."
,,Fast and clear instruction,5.0,,it is very easy to get to the destination because of the clear instructions . Also the SMRT is access to lots of sight seeing places. It is very convenient to tourists.
,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,I bought an E Z Card which cost $12.$5 for the card with $7 of travel.Top up was $10? Journeys were very reasonable.The Card tells you how much is left at every entry or exit point..I found this type of card better for me than the 2 or 3 day EZ card which included some attractions.At the end of your stay you can get a refund of any credit at any station.But not the $5for the card
,,amazing,5.0,,"This is the most amazing rapid Transit I have ever been on. So clean! we used it everywhere, you could eat off the floors. Great deal for tourist very inexpensive. My partner and only used this method of transportation. There are staff posted everywhere who quickly answers your questions and if they see your not sure about something they offer help. The transit system is like a giant shopping centre nice and cool. The easiest transit to use, very well marked. A must use in Singapore."
,,If staying for just a few days buy a tourist 1 2 or 3 day go anywhere ticket. Used ours extensively.,5.0,,"Clean efficient safe cool and polite. Simply the best rapid transit ever. In train displays tell you next station what to see there where changes are how long which side doors open. It even tells you how the upcoming platform is laid out, which exits go where and the things roads sights etc accessed from which exit. So easy and so comprehensive.On the platform notices telling travllers to allow others off the train first and giving clear direction where to go."
,,"Efficient, moderate and links you",5.0,,I jumped into the MRT from my hotel to go find some hawkers market to eat something Singaporean. Fast and efficient. I used it to Senosa to pick the cable car and found my way back easilly. Again i caught up with folks for the Singapore flyer. I still got change remaining on a 10dollar card. Will surely go back and use it
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,It was very easy to use and very inexpensive. Signs are clearly marked and very quiet and clean. Staff is posted everywhere and can answer any questions.
,,So clean and efficient,5.0,,The premier way to get around. Clean fast cheap safe and always on time. The western world needs to learn!
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, punctual, easy to use and reasonably priced. Great way to explore the City. All directions and signage in English"
,,"Quick, cheap and easy to navigate",5.0,,"Great system. First time to Singapore and navigated the system no problems at all. It is well signposted and coloured coded, with network maps throughout. It’s also easy to top up your card and very affordable. Very clean and reliable. Only negative is it can get very busy during peak hours and you can get stuck behind masses of people when walking between platforms. It does keep moving just slows you down a bit. The trains are running frequently though so not a big deal if you miss one."
,,Really efficient!,5.0,,"Trains were very clean and I don’t have to wait long for them to come. Train stations, although need lots of walking, very very spacious and clean as well."
,,Cheap and easy to use.,5.0,,Used mrt on couple of occasions to travel e.g to night safari ( followed by a bus) and little India . Ticket machines were easy to use and trains were spotlessly clean.
,,busy so avoid peak,4.0,,"we tried this once to get around. Its very inexpensive BUT the long walk to the platform and the mass of people at 5pm, maybe you need to take a taxi or tour instead if you are visiting"
,,Great source of Public Transport,5.0,,"With SMRT, it is relatively very easy to commute around Singapore. The different coloured MRT lines will take you to almost every place in SG.

One of the cheaper modes of transport, its mostly reliable and very user-friendly too.

SMRT staff will be more than willing to assist you on your planned journey."
,,Wordclass,5.0,,"Reliable, cheap and clean metro. You have a train every five to ten minutes and you can get everywhere. Hard to get a seat so you just stand most of the time. But it is a cheap and fast way to commute."
,,Easy convinient fast and clean,5.0,,"The title said it all, very comprehensive network, easy to find and always very clean and safe. We got with the 3 day pass and we used it extensively. Recommended."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Great way to get around, and with the Tourist Pass it’s cheap, efficient and available. Stations are everywhere, staff helpful, and it’s really convenient"
,,Very easy and clean.,5.0,,"Love using the MRT.
Firstly it’s clean!
Secondly it’s quick
Thirdly it’s very easy to use
Finally people are polite. I saw a number of young kids stand up and offer seats to older people and Mum’s etc. need to bring this level of politeness back when travelling on public transport in Australia"
,,Singapore’s “Tube” or Underground,5.0,,"Super easy, efficient and most cost effective way to get around Singapore. Simply purchase a card at almost any MRT station or 7 eleven. I think it’s $12 SGD and you get $5 dollars of credit on it and away you go. You can continually top up the card as needed at any station, and when you’re done, simply bring it to one of the offices again at most stations and give the card back and any remaining value will be returned.
Download the SMRT app for ease of map and station listings"
,,Clean and very comfortable,5.0,,I love to use MRT during my trip in Singapore. So clean and comfortable. It’s also much cheaper than using taxi.
,,Best transportation around the city,5.0,,"We use MRT as many singaporean do everyday. It's cheap, easy, and convenient. My MRT card is refillable every time we visit. Sometimes SDG 20 is enough for 3 days travel even from the airport."
,,Train Travel as it should be.,5.0,,"I just loved getting around Singapore on the SMRT. So cheap, (80 Aussie cents to go 5 stops) easy tap on tap off card, trains running every few minutes, nice and clean, strict no eating laws, very organised. I cannot fault it. It’s basically as good as you can get."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Easy to use and spotless. The underground stations are massive. Also can’t believe how cheap it is. Keep your ticket and top it up on your next trip.
,,Excellent Transport Service,5.0,,"Staying at Ibis Hotel, we had to walk 3 blocks away in the Bugis area to get to the Rochor MRT Station. Took the train upto Tanah Merah then transfer to a train going to Jewel Changi airport .... fare, just S$3.00

Fast & accurate service, clean coaches, what else can we ask for? Admire the automated gate enclosure in the MRT stations as it keeps the passengers/travellers safe, my first time to see this safety feature. They don’t have such in the U.S. nor in Australia"
,,Very convenient way to get around,5.0,,We used MRT a lot. Purchased multi day pass. I highly recommend it. Downloaded the app for time table.
,,First Class,5.0,,"I'd never used the MRT on my previous visits to Singapore but this time I was determined to put this right. I had this idea that the MRT was fairly limited in the area it covered and that the stations would be small and crowded.,I was wrong on both counts::I used my travel pass (i recommend purchasing one) to visit many of the areas II'd never visited before and found the journeys quite straightforward, apart from getting ""lost"" on one occasion
The stations are spacious and bright, and yes, some can get very busy,, particularly at peak times but generally I found them more than adequate.
In the trains themselves there are seats designated for the Elderly and Infirm which are used by fellow travelers when there is no demand for them. If someone is sitting on one of these seats they immediately stand up and give the seat to the priority traveler.
The MRT is a first class service."
,,"Clean, safe and efficient",5.0,,"Loved getting around Singapore on the SMRT.

Trains are super clean, efficient and reliable. It is very hard to get lost on the network. Signage is clear and in English and ticket machines are easy to work. At some stations there were staff telling people which trains were for which destination. Getting on and off is easy due to the queuing system (let people off stand behind the lines and then get on which is common in Asia instead of a free for all like London)

Stations themselves were clean and exits clearly marked and transfer to other lines also clearly shown so getting around is super easy."
,,Very organized,5.0,,"It was a great experience with their mrt. There was a lot of connections. You can easily go around the city and the attractions through the Mrt.

I got my mrt card at the airport TRAVELEX Money Changer. They offered an SG$18 sim card that came with an mrt card with sg$5 value. The sim card had 100gb data in it, 30mins international call, and a few other benefits. Just the mrt card, the data, and international calls was more than my money's worth.

The mrt system was simple enough that my 13yr old daughter was the one navigating throughout our trip.

Grab was also availble, but riding the MRT was more fun ^_^ and cheaper if your destination is a few stations away or more.

My wife bought us KLOOK vouchers for the Hopper bus. Looking back, we should not have paid sg$28 per person for the hopper bus. Instead we should have plotted our itinerary around the mrt."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Probably the best transit system I have used. Easy to navigate and very clean. We appreciated the tourist past and is highly recommended for tourists that plan on using the MRT more than a few times.
,,Ease of getting around SIN,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and on time. Trains every 4 to 5 minutes to most parts of Singapore with connecting lines making a seamless way of travelling. Great way to get to he airport - cost is very good."
,,"Efficient, safe, clean and easy to use!",5.0,,"SMART in Singapore is one of the best in the world! It is efficient, nicely air-conditioned, safe, extremely clean, easy to use and not expensive at all! It's very frequent, on time departures & arrivals. It goes to all most everywhere in Singapore, and makes my trip easy and very enjoyable."
,,Fantastic transport system,5.0,,"Recently visited Singapore and we used the trains to go everywhere, they are very easy to use. There are less than 10 lines I think and color coded and named logically.
We bought a train card at the airport and it cost us only $17 sgd for the whole week which is amazing value.
The train stations are very clean, safe, have good shops and easy to navigate around. The trains are also air conditioned and very clean. Most people were polite when getting on and off the trains, waiting for the exiting passengers first.
Definitely use the trains when in Singapore."
,,Ok but not the best,4.0,,Trains are smaller but clean. The system is great but HK is better overall. However they are always expanding and improving. During off hours trains tend to be less frequent.
,,Great Experience,5.0,,"We took the subway from Chinatown to our Orchard Dr. hotel. It was fast, clean and efficient. It was well lighted too."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"This mass transit system is very efficient, and easy to use. Helpful staffs, fair price, goes everywhere you want including airport, very clean and very soothing."
,,SMRT (Singapore Mass Rapid Transport) Usage Review,3.0,,"Firstly, I will write about the things I dislike about the SMRT. The SMRT trains are the cheapest and fastest way (after Grab cab or Taxi) to travel in Singapore. But they may have double standards when it comes to heavier handcrafted items.

On 6th April 2019, my Less Than 7kg Bag on Trolley was Rejected for Entry at Admiralty Station (total 4 bags to move and I had intended to move one by one on one trolley, making a total of 4 trips). But someone else's 16KG trolley of Ghee was allowed into LRT station. Also, tourists' 2 luggage bags pulled by two hands could be heavier than mine, and yet I was not even allowed mine, which had bulky items in the bag (on trolley as bag had no rollers beneath) but weighed less than 7kg.

Not all the SMRT topup machines accept notes or coins, so tourists may have this problem more often, if they don't he one day or three day passes. And the lrt trains that go to Senja/Pending/Fajar/Bangkit stations stop working by 11pm at Bukit Panjang station. So if you need to reach that area from airport， you have to leave by 9.30pm (yes, navigation is a little tricky and may take some time to find especially from the newly opened JEWEL), as you can't get the blue Downtown trains at airport, you need to take the smrt train - not to be confused with skytrain - to Singapore expo station to take the Downtown (blue line) train to Bukit Panjang (and take the LRT trains before they stop at 11pm).

Anyway, the good part of SMRT.
Friendly and efficient staff! A Miss Sharifa (Indian lady) allowed me to take a shortcut to the toilet while I was wheeling my aged mother. We were on our way to Garden by the Bay on 13th May afternoon and was only one station away from Bayfront station.). Thank you Sharifa! Her service is way beyond the other things I dislike about smrt."
,,Well connected!!,5.0,,"Convenient and easy commute option. Gets busy during peak hours like in most urban cities. Well connected to other transport option LRT, bus service and taxis. Very clean interiors, family and wheelchair friendly."
,,Fast anc clean ride,5.0,,Relatively easy to use as maps are available inside the station. Strict on no eating and drinking policy even at their platforms. Was a bit thirsty and automatically reached for my bottled water. Was reminded by one of the attendants about their policy. Used an EZ link card for multiple journeys. Can be topped up from the machines inside the station or at any 7-11 for a minimal fee. EZ link can also be used to pay for 7-11 purchases.
,,Nicest Transit I've Used,5.0,,"Europe and the States can't beat this mass transit system. Very clean, very efficient, and very soothing."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"So easy to use, helpful staff, cheap, goes everywhere you want including airport, all english signage too a real credit to Singapore, they should be proud of their mrt"
,,Smart SMRT,5.0,,"This rail system is one of the best in the world, if not the best. It is extensive taking passengers to all corners of Singapore. It is safe, very clean, has frequent & on time departures & arrivals, & is not expensive. It makes a trip to Singapore easy & enjoyable."
,,"So easy, safe and clean",5.0,,I def recommend using the public transit system. It’s very well organized and safe and clean. I used it to get everywhere during my trip. Bravo to Singapore for creating a great public transit system
,,Cheap and Easy to ride.,5.0,,we tried riding it for the 4 of us. easy to purchase tickets and easy to read where we want to be. we ended up using it to get to the universal and the casino. good trip
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The Singapore subway system is excellent. It's easy for anyone to use, organized, and ridiculously clean."
,,TfL could learn from these guys...!,5.0,,"What a fantastic system, modern, clean and prompt. Not only that they tell you before the train arrives how busy each of the carriages are and it’s air conditioned. Great value Awesome... !"
,,Sightseeing,4.0,,"the transport system is just brilliant, MRT stations were so clean , not staffed in every station, and you can only buy
a two way trip at a lot of stations, we ended up purchasing 3 day pass at a shop which suited out needs better. Bigger stations you can purchase passes but you only find that out when you ask someone."
,,Great service,5.0,,"Great investment, great service, security and easy to be used by a tourist! A very convenient way to get around and explore Singapore."
,,"Easy, Convenient, Affordable ... and lots more!",5.0,,"I travelled to Singapore in May 19. Initially I was not sure how easy and convenient the SMRT in Singapore is. So after landing in Changi airport I took a taxi to my hotel in Little India.

On the second day I first used SMRT and was impressed with the ease and convenience of traveling. It’s cost effective too. The ticketing was hassle free because of the EZ Card which I had purchased on the airport. You just need to load the card with money and you are ready to travel.

All the stations are neat and clean and so as SMRT. At the station you can find maps of the SMART system and by following them you can easily travel to various places in Singapore.

So from the second days onwards, I used SMRT and the SG Bus only. No taxi!"
,,The way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Caught the SMRT several times on our recent trip to Singapore and it is a great transport system, clean, easy to use and trains arrive and depart on time."
,,The Best Public transport,5.0,,"Perfect way to travel around Singapore. Its cheap, very clean (no eating, drinking or smoking) on the MRT. Very efficient system and we found it very easy to use."
,,"Great, fast and affordable way to travel, subway, MRT train service",5.0,,"The trains are fast, effective affordable. Most train stations are connected to shopping malls in the city. There are several interchange stations thst cuts through more than one line. The lines are colour coded and easily identifiable; north south line, east west line, north east line, circle line and downtown line. There is the Airport station that is accessible to all for Changi International Airports. Best way to travel in the Island City!"
,,The best metro system in the world,5.0,,"I live in Toronto, a city of 3 million people just in the metropolitan area, and a subway (metro) system built for a city with half the population. Most of it was completed in two stages during the mid 1950s and mid 1970s, with a short extension in the last few years. Taking it to work daily is a depressing experience. And it is among the better North American systems. Spending a few days in Singapore in mid May I was able to indulge in a dramatic fantasy of being in a city with a beautiful, clean, modern metro that goes everywhere, has no delays, lots of interchanges and redundancy in case of a problem. If heaven has a metro it must be built by Singapore."
,,Superlative transport system,5.0,,"Used the MRT many many times during our 2.5 week stay in Singapore. It is highly efficient, spotlessly clean, very cool and extremely cheap. I cannot imagine a public transport system anywhere in the world that could surpass the MRT"
,,SMRT,5.0,,Getting around Singapore using the SMRT was an easy and cost effective way of seeing Singapore. This is an excellent mode of transport. I wish other countries would take note. Made our trip enjoyable and stress free.
,,Wow,4.0,,A fastest way to travel within the country. The staffs r everywhere and would be helpful at all times. Trains are crowded only during the peak hours.
,,Convenient SMRT,4.0,,SMRT is a convenient means of transport within the city. However if one is travelling in a group then it is better to take a taxi through Grab app as it will be more economical and faster to commute.
,,"Easy to navigate, very clean.",5.0,,Easy to get around the city and easy to figure out the different colored routes. What was most surprising to me was how clean and quiet it was in each car even with so many people on board.
,,Great value very good service,5.0,,"The tourist 3 day card is great value. It is easy to navigate. On time. Safe entry and exit. Sometimes some longer walks between connections, but hey, it's holiday. Also very very clean."
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,Best public transport system. So cheap too. Travel around easily in air conditioned comfort for a fraction of the cost of others
,,Brilliant transportation system,5.0,,"I'm impressed with this metro system, only Japan can match up in comparison. Very fast, circle line every 5minutes, user friendly map system, immaculately clean subways and trains, extremely safe, secure barriers, well poised culture."
,,So clean and efficient,5.0,,"A great way to get around in a clean, air conditioned environment. So efficient, service at least every 3 minutes. Uses a system similar to our Myki system but very cheap, based on distance travelled."
,,great SMRT,5.0,,great clean fast service around Singapore very tourist friendly and lo cost if you go buy the top up pass
,,Such an easy way to get around!,5.0,,"We loved the MRT in Singapore. It is so easy to use, and easy to get around Singapore to see all the sights. Lots of lifts for pram acess which is great."
,,Good,5.0,,"Great subway system, trains are fast and everything is very clean. The ticket system is easy to use in many languages"
,,SMRT,3.0,,Metro is good but if you compare with Delhi metro then its small. Delhi metro is nothing less than SMRT.
,,Fairly convenient and Great during off Peak hours,4.0,,"I would say that Singapore’s MRT is still one of the best city train commute among the world, despite many stories of it’s poor management, broken down and blah blah blah .. no city had perfected that I Guess (only Japan and HKG, might had done a better job)

It is generally modern, with all the necessary pre notifications on arrivals or delays, reasonable fair rates and probably the cleanest in the world (since chewing gum was banned more than 20 years ago)"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Brilliant metro system. Simple to read and use maps, cheap day tickets, always a seat, spotlessly clean and air conditioned"
,,Singapore Travel Pass,5.0,,"Well recommended. $30 for 3 days unlimited travel on MRT and local buses. You can even claim $10 back if you return the card or can continue to top up after 3 days.

All stations we went to were clean, tidy and well sign posted. Occasionally the trains were quite full but no different to any other Metro system.

In train information very helpful and majority in English."
,,"Quick, easy and efficient",5.0,,"The MRT is very fast and efficient. The network work is easy to navigate and stations are well placed to enable easy access to places to visit across Singapore.

It’s a great way to get about. Tickets are cheap and easy to purchase.

One of the better city transport systems across the world!"
,,From A to B on the MRT!,5.0,,"The the MRT system is fast, cost effective, safe, clean and efficient! We used it the visit both the university In the west and the Sungei Buloh Wetland Centre in the north of island!"
,,Excellent choice for rapid transport,5.0,,"The Singaporeans have this transport sorted. A brilliant way to get around. They have a tourist pass card you can buy at the airport MRT station (elsewhere as well, this is just where we found on arrival at Changi airport), there is a small office to the right of the escalators on the train platform. Office open from 8am for cash sales, but there is a vending machine that takes credit cards beside the office. Choice of 1, 2, 3 or more day pass. Excellent value and the pass works on their bus system as well. Make sure you surrender the card at the end of your trip - there is a refundable deposit amount due to you!"
,,So easy to use. Priceless convenience,5.0,,"Once we’d found which of the four exits / entrances to use to get into the MRT from under our hotel, we loved using this system. So cheap to use, air conditioned and so convenient. We liked to wander around and see the sights, but to get to Marina Bay area or the Orchid Gardens from our base in Chinatown, you could not beat the convenience of the MRT."
,,"Easy, efficient and cheap",5.0,,We found it easy and cheap getting around Singapore using SMRT. Make sure you buy the Tourist pass. It's not available for purchase at all the stations. We got ours at the Chinatown station. My kids loved the characters that remind passengers to be courteous. lol. The public videos on what to do during an emergency were informative although I thought my young kids would get scared after viewing them. We LOVED the bathrooms at all the stations. Very clean. Typical Singapore! :)
,,Confusing,4.0,,"We got on the subway at Chinatown which was easy in a way lol. Ticketing easy but we got on the wrong train then had to get off and turn around. The subway is amazing but when we got out at gardens by the bay, very confusing, signs everywhere so unless you know exactly which exit you take read very carefully otherwise you will be doing a lot of extra walking trying to find your way. It is a lot of walking to get anywhere. Not sure if it is the same going back because we caught a taxi. Taxis are so cheap in Singapore seems it doesn't matter how far you go it costs $10 and they are mainly very modern cars and clean. You just don't get shown landmarks unless you get a good driver like us, sadly on the last day but he did point out places we had driven past in our travels over 3 wonderful days in Singapore."
,,"Efficient transportation but placement of system map far from optimal, and certainly for visitors",4.0,,"On my recent visit to Singapore I used the SMRT extensively. Sometimes whilst waiting for the train to arrive I would want to see what alternative line I could take, particularly when the train "" appears to take longer to arrive"". For that to be possible system maps should be placed on the platform in between the lines going in the opposite directions. But that is not always the case.. Apparently, Information ergonomics has not been given a priority or perhaps there is a belief that passengers know where there are heading and how to get there. But what about a foreign visitor?. One would then have to walk some distance or go up or down to the entrance where such maps are displayed. That takes time. Effectively the ergonomics of information communication needs improvement, particularly for the visitor.

Sometimes one has to walk quite some distance to get to the net connecting lines... obviously that is a result of new lines being added much later, such as the Downtown and North East lines. Strangely, one has to check out from one line and then walk some distance and then check in again to continue on the next line.

The SMRT systen is extremely clean. However, often the trains were crowded particularly in the mornings and evenings.

Compliments to the many Singaporeans, particularly the young people who tend to give up their seats to the elderly, the less mobile and to expectant mothers."
,,A great time saver system,5.0,,"If you buy the Singapore Tourist Pass (it comes in three options: 1 day S$20, 2 days S$26 and 3 days S$ 30. At the end you can get back S$10 if you give the card back), you'll get unlimited travel to go in the MRT, LRT, and buses, but if you are planning to go to Universal Studios, you must buy a ticket in Vivo Plaza"
,,Safe & easy,5.0,,"Easy & cost effective travelling option for tourists . Stations are located very closer to many of the city attractions ,"
,,off peak hours,3.0,,"easy access to places, easy purchase tickets, friendly assistant. all only ay off peak hours when i was there."
,,Easy to use,4.0,,"My title of easy to use is accurate, however! Being a tourist, getting your money back on the cards is more challenging as you have to go to a specific counter.

The station we tried to do it at meant us walking in the opposite direction to where we wanted to go and we were running out of time.

So... we have them for our next visit.

Using the MRT was easy, once you figure out the end station! You then know which line you need to be on / & the direction to go.

Clean and easy to use... a pleasure."
,,Everything is close to the MRT,5.0,,"Every I visiting Singapore , MRT is first transportation for me to go anywhere in MRT.
Range and frequency also make us easy, because so many and fast.
The station near from public area. Ticketing machine easy to use.
line or track SMRT so many now, and make us easy go to anywhere in Singapore.
I love this transportation"
,,MRT - A surprise ride is waiting,3.0,,"When there are no problems, Singapore MRT offers a fast and convenient ride in Singapore. But when there are train delay, rain, or other factors that screws up the schedule, get ready for a hell time. Train delays are common although it has shown improvement lately."
,,Fantasic MRT ststem,4.0,,"Timely and superb !! Thats why cars & petrol are so expensive($2.2) as the Govt pushes you to use their Transport than use own cars . They are present everywhere, although you need to watch out for the boards, less personnel around"
,,Efficient and generally clean,4.0,,"Being the only train system on the island, SMRT has to work efficiently and effectively to ensure that everyone gets to work or school (or anywhere else, for that matter) on time. Appreciate the fact that the trains are ending earlier to allow for maintenance. Would be good to have more posters placed in the trains to remind passengers to avoid eating / drinking on trains. There should also be posters and perhaps, advertisements or videos to encourage passengers not to watch videos or listen to loud music on their mobile devices with the sound on. We need to be sensitive to our surroundings and be mindful of our actions. Are earphones expensive? I thought that all mobile phones come with earphones anyway."
,,Wonderful system!,5.0,,Good and cost effective option to get around Singapore quickly! The trains are frequent and very clean.
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Cheap, reliable, efficient & runs regularly, easy to use too, you can’t go wrong! Great way to travel around."
,,Great,5.0,,"Single passes cost around $1.8~$2.5. Trains are clean, led displays for the stations. Great experience!"
,,Singapire MRT,5.0,,"Very easy and userfriendly. Don't buy a touris pass, it is cheapwr to buy a travel card and add money to whenever necessary. Never any delays, if you miss a train, the next one comen in 3 to 5 min."
,,Easy pesy!,5.0,,"So clean, so reliable, soooo cheap!
I will be using the SMAT every time I come to Singapore now. The stations are easy to get around and the ticket guy was very helpful at the first station we went to. After that, we used the automated machines which are also super easy to use."

,,Taking SMRT as a senior citizen,5.0,,"I retired recently and started taking public transport after driving all my life. Having plenty of time on my hand and never in a rush, I started taking buses and SMRT trains at least 3 to 4 times a week going to my gym and also going around the island meeting friends to catch up over meals.

By the way, I am a senior citizen and was given a PASSION SILVER card to enjoy the discounts on all public transports.

I try to avoid taking public transport during peak rush hours as it can get seriously crowded and you might even not be able to get into a bus or SMRT train. However, when the train is crowded you can get lucky if a younger person is gracious enough and offer to give up their seat (especially for the ""reserved seating"" for handicapped, pregnant women and elderly). In 6 out of 10 times, I will be offered the seat by a younger person and I am happy with it.

The SMRT train is very clean and efficient and this is probably one of the better mass rapid transportation in the region as I have traveled around a lot before my retirement."

We bought a two day visitor pass and used the train extensively to travel around this beautiful city.
It was inexpensive, always on time, air conditioned, practical and really easy to navigate where you were going, and there are trains every couple of minutes so not a lot of waiting around! Plus, the stations are all kept immaculately clean!
The Singaporean’s are doing there rail travel right!
I highly recommend!"
,,Clean but unreliable,2.0,,"Though the train are generally clean, for a small island like Singapore, it takes too long to travel from home to destination as you have to take another mode of transport which is usually a bus to the train station, so all in all the traveling time is way too long, unless you live next to a train station or your destination is just next to one, bad planning."
,,Fast efficient and effective,5.0,,"I took a grab to reach SACA Singapore After Care Association At 81 Dunlop Street and wanted to try taking the mass transit railway (MRT) to another meeting place
Really didn’t realise it was so simple fast and easy
Only issue is I have to change at Newton and it seems on the fare reflected that it was indeed counted as two separate trips and not as one trip like the other lines exchange points like City Hall"
,,Clean efficient,5.0,,Clean well run efficient. Good signage. Typical 4 minutes between trains. Its quite cheap but if you have mobility issues it will be more difficult than taxis.
,,Number 1 in SE Asia if not the world,5.0,,The best public subway system you will get to use. Van often be a little crowded around rush hours but nothing compared to other large cities. Comparatively cheap too.

Air-conditioned station which eases the hot climate. Convenient to buy tickets just make sure you have coins with you as you pay thru the machine."
,,Practical but can be more expensive than taxi sometimes,4.0,,"Very well explained and easy to use but it works by distance so it will always be cheaper than a taxi if you are alone, could be close for two people, and could even be more expensive than a taxi if you are three persons."
,,SMRT. Easy to use,5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore for 21 years, I have seen the Underground or Tube as us English like to call it to grow up. From what was originally only two lines it now almost covers the island and is easy to navigate and cheap!"
,,Easy and economical,5.0,,Must be the best way to get around if you don't use a taxi. You can get a pre-payed card and top up. Get an MRT map at a station and study where the intersections are or check on googlemaps. Stations are all air conditioned so great way to cool down. MRT staff are available at several of the ticket machines to help you.
,,"So very efficient, cheap, and easy to use",5.0,,"#Found the MRT very easy to use, and the ticket machines are great - just be aware they don't take big notes (had to buy someting in 7-11 that we didn't want just to change a $50 note)"
,,easy to use,5.0,,used this a few times mrt stop was very convenient to our hotel excellent very clean easy to navigate
,,Easy to use,4.0,,Was in Singapore over a weekend and very easy to navigate the public transport system. We bought tourist passes for two days which makes it all very easy but trying to find an open ticket office to redeem our $10 deposits on the cards proved impossible...so we still have them to charge up next time we are in Singapore...
,,SMRT,4.0,,"The MRT was one of the best inventions ever. It has made getting to places so easy for Singaporeans, as the Circle, North- East, North- South, East- West and Downtown lines connect almost every part of our Little Red Dot. Unfortunately, the MRT has broken down several times before. However, it is a far cheaper alternative to taking a cab or booking a Grab or Uber."
,,Use to go everywhere!,5.0,,Very simple to use. Fast. Air conditioned. You can get close to almost all the attractions. Reasonably priced.
,,"Efficient, easy transport in Singapore",5.0,,The MRT system services the entire island and is a convenient and cheap way to travel. The network is such that most places can be reached quite easily directly by train or one can transfer to a bus. Clear signage makes this easy to follow. We purchased a swipe card and were refunded with the amount we had not used when we returned the card. The trains run so frequently that the longest wait we experienced in 6 days was 4 mins! At peak travel times they can get crowded and one might have to stand for part of a journey.

,,Best train ever,5.0,,Bring this system to Australia. Fast efficient train. Sleek and clean. Very organised system. Signs clear and easy to understand. Didnt even need a ticket if you have a mastercard. We just used it to tap on tap off. Very very efficient and so cheap. We used it to get from the airport to the Esplanade took about 45 mins. Two stop changes but the trains run very frequently.
,,It works and works well,5.0,,Coming from other countries that have “trains” I was a skeptic .....and I was wrong! It works and is even cool as in temperature with the door system and enclosed underground stations Well done Singapore on achieving what most large cities dream of !
,,Give it a try,5.0,,"Starting off using taxis, which are not too expensive, but sometimes long queues, we decided to brave the SMRT. Once having worked out how to purchase tickets and which colour platform to be on, it wasn’t any harder than our experiences in London and Paris on their underground systems. And very cheap!"
,,Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit,4.0,,"The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is Singapore’s most convenient mode of transport, connecting almost all of Singapore, with plenty of interchanges conveniently located, one can easily travel around Singapore without any fear of getting lost. The MRT line consists of 5 different lines currently with another line under construction. Once ready close to 80% of Singapore’s neighbourhoods will be connected and linked."
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,Great way to get around Singapore. Trains come every 3-5 minutes. Very very clean. Plenty of room on the train. Bought a 3 day pass which gave us discounts at various places and then we got $10 back for returning the card
,,Super easy to get around and so clean,5.0,,MRT is by far the cleanest train station I've seen. Large walkways between stations/platforms. All easily sign posted and clean inside the carriages. Sydney could take a few tips!
,,Smart,5.0,,Went everywhere in the smrt. Easy to read maps people also he!pful. Very clean and air conditioned and trains come quickly. Many people speak English if you need help. Took one to the Airport just to see the sights in the terminal. Go see the waterfall.

,,Clockwork Precision,4.0,,"We travelled on the MRT a number of times a day. It was fast, efficient, clean and informative. Didn't have any trouble finding which train to take us to where we wanted to go."
,,SMRT OF SINGAPORE,5.0,,"What a high model of development of Singapore. A really really useful and helpful Aircondioned Train transport for the people of Singapore.

I visited Singapore in 1990, 1998, Jan-2019 & recently April-2019

MRT is Wi-fi enabled. It comes to every station after almost every 3 minutes.

MRT cards are also available on daily basis, top-up basis & for certain period.

An amazing service 5/6 floors down the raod level having shopping malls, 7-Eleven shops, Lifts & exclators facility"
,,A lesson in urban rail travel,5.0,,Never had to wait more than 5 minutes. Certain times of the day are crowded but so is any other urban city rail system. Never had any issues.
,,Most efficient and clean,5.0,,Very easy to use. We bought a one day pass then you can take car back and get $10 refunded. Trains so efficient never had to wait longer than a minute. Clean and airconditioned. Felt safe the whole visit.
,,Clean and easy,5.0,,So easy to use. Ticketing is simple and trains are smooth and very clean. A great way to get around.
,,Gardens by The Bay,4.0,,We visited the gardens and thought that it was really pretty and well worth a visit. It is free to walk in the gardens but there is a charge to visit the indoor exhibits but they are spectacular.
,,Very Conveninet,5.0,,"Great way to explore Singapore. Cheap, convenient, and a very reliable commute option for tourist. You just need to buy a travel card and you are good to go. Just make sure your card is topped up all the time. And when you leave singapore, you can get the balance of the card, or you can keep the card which is any way valid for 6 or 7 years. Even if it expires, you can reactivate it for SGD3"
,,Perfect for our needs!,5.0,,"We were here just over 3 days which meant that the tourist pass was not ideal as needed transport for longer. We bought a local pass which cost 12 dollars, 5 non refundable and 7 dollars credit - we could then top it up as and when needed - you need 3 dollars on the card to travel anywhere - from airport to bugis area cost 1.75. On our final day we didn’t have enough to get back so bought a single ticket to airport for 2.50 and got the remaining credit on our card refunded. I believe with the tourist card you can get a full refund but it will cost more - we are keen walkers and did a lot of sightseeing on foot - therefore we didn’t need to top up and spent just under 7 dollars in total - if you want to be care free and use the mrt all the time tourist pass may be easier."
,,Good Transport Option,5.0,,"I only used the MRT a few times, but found it to be very clean and efficient. It's very affordable, so DO NOT buy the tourist pass (although easier, so much more expensive).
If you have a Mastercard Credit Card you can just tap on and off on your card."
,,Quick and accessible MRT,5.0,,"The MRT services are great It is economical and quick means of transport. We used it one day to travel, they do have escalators and lifts"
,,Quick and clean,5.0,,Once you get the hang of it - and it is simple - this is fast efficient and clean. And the prices are fair and reasonable with the daily travel card - ten dollars deposit
,,Easy and accessible all time,5.0,,Entire city travel was through MRT and it was easy being the first timer. Smart card availability and recharge is also very easy and available at every station.
,,Clean & efficient,5.0,,"Brilliant way to travel when in Singapore. We used a mixture of the 3 day Tourist card as well as single & return tickets. Clear & simple instructions at stations and on the train.
We did a couple of longer trips (Chinese Gardens & Changi Airport) which were a good way to see more of this great city."
,,Easy to go around the city,5.0,,"The fare is cheap compared to other means of vehicles (grab, taxi..) and it can bring you to any place in the city. The trains are well equipped with very clear instructions to minimise the chance you get lost."
,,"Clean, efficient, and wonderful!",5.0,,"The Singapore metro is one of the most efficient, cleanest in the world. Get a multi-use reloadable tap card in the latest styles. A few years ago, we got limited-edition Star Wars and Captain America EZ-link cards. This year, they had Captain Marvel cards."
,,Getting around town is easy!,5.0,,"SG has the best public transport system. Affordable, convenient, clean, easy to navigate and everyone onboard is friendly."
,,"Overused, under maintained",1.0,,The train gets more and more crowded each day. Schedule is unreliable. The police enforcement presence and causing unnecessary checks on innocent locals rushing for works makes one’s MRT trip an unpleasant experience. Buck up MRT
,,Fantastic if you have change,5.0,,"This is a great system BUT there is one big issue. If you are a tourist and using the paper tickets you need $5 notes or less to buy single tickets. Cards aren’t accepted for these small amounts. You can’t get $5 notes from ATMs. Mrt offices don’t provide change.

It’s frustrating. Please accept credit cards for all amounts."
,,Excellent MRT,4.0,,"It is one of the best, cleanest and well organized MRT in the world. It is absolutely safe and tourist friendly, with people guiding you all the time."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"You can take the MRT from Changi Airport to mostly anywhere in the city. Super efficient, clean and fast."
,,The best way to travel around Singapore!,5.0,,Being first time visitors to Singapore we were slightly anxious of how easy we would find it using this system to travel around the different areas. What a pleasant surprise - the MRT is exceptional. The different lines are clearly marked and signposted at each station and the AC is always so welcoming! Would recommend everyone to use this when visiting the city - it is also priced very reasonably and we would also definitely advise getting a EZ-Link card from the ticket offices which are very easy to top up. Brilliant!
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"Extremely comfortable ,quickest way to reach a place. Staff at the helpdesk/ service are extremely helpful."
,,Ultra Efficient!,5.0,,"The MRT is a boon for the Singaporeans as well as tourists. This is clean, timely and most efficient way to get around Singapore. Major areas are covered and at max, one might need to change stations once and in very rare cases twice.

Do note that not all attractions are very close to the MRT stations and as long as one is prepared to walk a fair distance from the station to the attraction, this works well. In some cases (especially if you are a group of 3 or more), Grab works better as you would avoid the last mile walk and save some time for little extra money.

Having said that, the MRT is very useful to get around to most of the places in Singapore and it is frequent, clean and very fast!. Also, we never experienced too much of crowd even in peak hours."
,,Great way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"The wide network of transport via bus or MRT brings you nearly everywhere for a very low price, if you buy once a tap on tap off card instead of buying a ticket for each ride separately. Websites like ""go there SG"", ""Moovit"" or Google Maps calculate the best connections for you."
,,Brilliant System Applauded,5.0,,"As regular visitors to Singapore, we greatly admire the MRT system in so many areas. The cleanliness of stations, the rapidity and regularity of trains, the ease of finding your way all around the network. Unlike most rail systems throughout the world, you feel sensible people are in charge, planning how trains can best serve the people, not expecting citizens to uncritically accept a second rate system. Large numbers of people move without fuss around the network, unlike the grubby, chaotic and often unreliable system in many other 'developed' nations. Look and weep or better still, Look and learn."
,,Clean and Rapid,5.0,,Very convinient way to travel across Singapore. Cleaner than most MRTs around the world and very well-developed too.
,,well organized,5.0,,"We used the 3-day and the 2-day unlimited card for our five day stay. You can go anywhere, in a quick efficient way. There are 8 ""metro"" lines that can take you almost everywhere. There are some bus lines (e.g. to the Zoo) which complete the coverage.

It worth to use the App to organize quickest connection.

Be careful where you buy the pass, as there might be difference in the deposit (you may not get it back, if bought at some agent)"
,,Can be better,4.0,,Taking this regularly to office every morning and after office hour. Reliable and convinient. Rush hour can be very crowded especially at interchange such as Jurong East.
,,Fast and efficient mode of transport,5.0,,"The MRT is a fast mode of transport, well lit, bright and spacious at a good price. It is easy and not expensive to get around the city."
,,Tourist Day Pass,5.0,,"10 S$ for a day of travel on the underground in Singapore. Fast, clean and efficient. Gets you to all the sites quickly. Maps easy to read. You have to pay 10 S$ for the card which is refundable. Beware though that the offices that do the refund close at 21h00."
,,Excellent transit system,5.0,,"Wonderful, clean, safe, air-conditioned, efficient transit system. Easy to navigate. What else would you want in a public transit system?"
,,great but very busy,3.0,,took the sort twice while visiting. Its very inexpensive but the mass of people and the long walks put us off so maybe quicker in a taxi. Just way too busy
,,excellant,5.0,,"the MRT is just plain easy , so fast and cheap to use and my definite chose of transport whilst in singas , even from the airport"
,,Most convenient way to visit Singapore,5.0,,"Easy and Fast way to move in Singapore even with two small kids.
But you need cash to buy tickets at the machines. They do not accept credit cards.
The stations are well announced in the cars visually so you cannot miss your stops.
Only drawback is that you do not see much."
,,An enviable system,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is absolutely world class. Trains and platforms are spotless, information and ticketing is really simple.
It's sometimes a bit intimidating visiting a new city to use public transport. The complexities of buying tickets, finding stations, safety are always a concern. The MRT should be the default for getting around Singapore. Its so easy and so good.
If you use Apple phones the MRT will appear on your map app so getting around the city is even easier as you are told stations, exits and everything you need to zip around the city."
,,SMRT,4.0,,Let down by a tour company so used the SMRT instead. Great way to travel around. Soon found ourselves to get around easily and cheaply.
,,Easy to navigate around,5.0,,"The MRT system is very easy to navigate and very safe to use . We purchased just the normal ezy pass from a seven eleven store , there is also a tour past however you have to do a lot of travelling to use $10 of travelling on the MRT . I would recommend the use of the MRT to all travellers to Singapore ."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,Very efficient and fast and clean. Though there are times that the station gets really hot due to the hot weather of Singapore. Easy to follow the map and the instructions are clear.
,,The quickest way to travel,5.0,,"What a brilliant and affordable train system! Spotlessly clean, runs on time and easy to navigate as a tourist. It's an enviable system."
,,Simple transit system to get around,4.0,,The train system is clean and efficient. We went from place to place on it. It can take you to and from the international airport where shopping is unexpectedly great. One can easily spend a few hours at the airport mall with its inexpensive restaurants.
,,Singapore City Tour,4.0,,"Our plan was to use the subway from the airport to the area where you purchase tickets for the hop-on and hop-off bus and instead rode the SMRT all around town due to heavy rain. We were able to make several stops to see the architectural highlights in Singapore during a long layover. We ended up purchasing several one way tickets and should have purchased a day pass which may be less expensive, confusing, and saved time. The SMRT is easy to use and attendants are stationed at the ticket kiosks to help you."
,,Unbeatable,5.0,,"Our family used similar systems in other countries but none compare to this extremely efficient, clean, punctual, problem-free and cheap way to travel. Brilliant!"
,,Quick and east way to get around in Singapore!!!!!,4.0,,SMRT is the fastest and the quickest way to get about in Singapore. Specially if you are travelling during rush hour. It is relatively cheap in comparison to some of the other countries and very very clean.
,,Superb public transportation,5.0,,Easy and very cheap way to get around Singapore. Definitely the cleanest underground system I have ever seen! Buy a rechargeable ticket at 7-Eleven.
,,The best way to move around Singapore,5.0,,"Buses and underground systems are frequent, punctual, clean and air conditioned. Getting an EZ link card is very easy and they refund the not used money !"
,,Easy to use. Fantastic staff. Peak hour is very busy,4.0,,"We used the MRT regularly on our trip. Getting tickets, reading the rail maps etc was easy. Trains were clean and efficient. The only negative was that they are absolutely packed in peak hour. If you have personal space issues, then peak hour is not for you. Aside from this period, seating was always available and the trips were safe, clean and cool."
,,"Clean, reliable, good value",5.0,,Easy to navigate and super clean with punctual trains and lots of easy access lifts and very polite fellow travellers
,,Best way to get around by far,5.0,,"Im not normally one to catch public transport when im overseas, mainly becuase it's confusing to me but the MRT is incredible. I was in Singapore for a month so i purchased a EZlink card for tap on and tap off like most PT systems. It uses a colour code for each line and runs around every 4 mins during peak and longer during non peak times. Price for your EZlink is $12 initially which gives you $7 credit. Subsequent top ups are $10 minimum and you have to have a $10 note with you becuase no change is given. I was travelling around 5 stops each way and it only cost me 0.83c. Way cheaper than a cab. Highly recommmended."
,,Too easy!,5.0,,"Cheap and efficient way to get around, would thoroughly recommend. Safe and clean. We even traveled at peak hour and still got on and off easy ."
,,A very easy way to travel!,5.0,,This is a must for getting around Singapore! I paid $20 for a three day tourist pass. It took me all over the city!
,,Just... amazing,5.0,,"Easy, convenient, clean, efficient. Really simple to purchase the tourist card that gives you unlimited access. Loved it."
,,So easy,5.0,,"The MRT is fantastic, quiet, quick, clean and a breeze to navigate. Used it on Wednesay night, had us back to our hotel in under 10 minutes"
,,A day in the city easily negotiated,5.0,,We left from Changi and found the SMRT easy to negotiate. We arrived very quickly after a change to another train but it is so well signposted in each carriage in 4 languages. Goog value
,,Excellent Train System,5.0,,"One of the best, if not the best train system we have used. Reasonably priced, easy to use, very punctual, almost no waiting times, many options to get to places and covers most parts of the City. This is the most efficient way to travel in Singapore, although from airport to hotel taxi is more convenient with big bags. We would have spent $5 on MRT versus $20 for taxi from airport to our hotel in Little India, so one could make their own decision. Very clean and no food and beverages allowed. Extremely safe from an operational and personal safety point of view. Directions and information is very well displayed and explained via audio system."
,,Best public transport system I have ever used by far,5.0,,"Signage and directions are easy to read and understand, ticketing system is a breeze to use, services are on time, and transport between locations is quick and efficient. Almost anywhere you need to to go in Singapore is serviced by the MRT, why would you need anything else?"
,,Superb!!,5.0,,"Clean, punctual, value for money - what more can one say? Try for yourself...you won't be disappointed"
,,The best trainnetwork,5.0,,Grab a tourist pass on the way from the airport if you are catching the train to the city. Used the trains everyday no need for taxis to visit any tourist attraction. Cleanest and best train system I've ever been on.
,,Best way to commute in Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is an excellent system in Singapore to travel across the city. The most efficient, timely services and most importantly, all of the lines are interconnected for the convenience of the passangers."
,,Could not be any easier getting around Singapore.,5.0,,"It could not be any easier or any more convenient than to use trains and buses to get around Singapore. You can purchase and top up cards from any station. If you miss a train, there is another in 3-4 minutes. Busses run every 10-15 minutes depending on the time of day. Download the app or use google maps to determine times and whether a train or bus will get you to where you need to go quicker and more conveniently. Here's the best part, you can get from one side of Singapore to the other for about $S2. Travel on public transport is unbelievably cheap. We travelled from the Airport to Chinatown for about $S1.30 one way. We travelled from our hotel in Chinatown town to the Zoo and it cost about $4.80 per person round trip. Taxis are also cheap but why bother when the SMRT is as good as it gets."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"The public trains are absolutely amazing and convenient as well as easy to use. You can't go wrong, trains basically run every couple of minutes and gets you in the heart of any area. Wish all cities had a train system like this one."
,,MRT station exits,5.0,,"Stations have multiple exits. Choosing the right exit could save you a few hundred meters walking above ground.
We probably looked too much like tourists. Every time we stopped for a second to read the signs, a very polite staff member would come and ask us where we would like to go and direct us.
This is the most efficient public transport system in my experience."
,,Essential way to travel..,5.0,,"I'd heard so much about the travel system in Singapore. We decided to experience this as soon as possible so went three stops to Orchard Rd for the experience.
Fantastic - very efficient, clean and safe to ride in this close to perfect system. Be sure to get a map of the entire MRT network to expedite getting around many parts of Singapore.
Cabs are very cheap if trains arent your thing."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,Very easy way to travel around the city. Easy to navigate from line to line. Safe and clean with regular train service till midnight. Multi day visitor tickets available are great value.
,,Brilliant transport around Singapore!,5.0,,"Our family recently spent 5 days discovering the many exciting places around Singapore. We were based near Clarke Quay so Fort Canning was our “home base”. We purchased a Singapore tourist pass for 3 days and found the MRT to be safe, clean, efficient and very quick. We would highly recommend it!"
,,Reliable,5.0,,Efficient and reliable for us to go from place to place without having to take taxis. The stations are also well spread with eateries and shopping
,,Very convenient mode of transportation,4.0,,I like the way they organized their railway system... it's very convenient... it is easy to understand that even a 1st timer in Singapore like me were able to travel around the city easily
,,"Super Clean, cheap & efficient",5.0,,Nicest and cleanest public transportation I have ever ridden. The staff at the ticket station was very nice & helpful towards tourists. Probably the best MRT in the world.
,,One of the Best,5.0,,"The MRT is well connected and reliable. Easy to get around and change between lines. Fast, clean, safe, efficient. We keep our card toped up and reuse each trip."
,,Buy a Tourist Travel Pass,5.0,,"We purchased the 3 day tourist pass for $30 and was worth it! I recommend to get the pocket map to help you locate the nearest stations to where you need to go. It’s very easy to use the network, the trains are extremely clean and the aircon will refresh you after walking around the streets. I really liked the glass doors installed at each station where the train stops this is a great safety measure and it reduces the noise as well."
,,So easy to use and download SG MRT app,5.0,,"The only way to get around . While the network is easy to figure out , downloading the SG MRT app makes it so easy to find a station"
,,Excellent Integrated network,5.0,,"1. Clean, fast 2. Well connected to all parts of the city 3. Integrated with bus network, both in terms of connectivity and fare system infrastructure (Ezlink/NETS) 4. Easy for tourists, given that the connections are available on Google maps and multiple apps"
,,Best transport mode in sg,5.0,,"For tourists do use the MRT when travelling around Singapore. U will not get lost, no jam (other than human jam at peak hours), low cost and get to places easily."
,,Best public transport system.,5.0,,Very easy way of getting around Singapore. All underground and easy to work out. Very reasonably priced and a good travel experience.
,,"So safe, so clean, so effective, oh and it’s cheap!",5.0,,You can travel all day on this wonderful clean safe underground train system for about £2.50! Of course it is air conditioned too.

,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Definitely get a transit card. Very clean, fast and safe. Lots of lines to get you everywhere. I went to the airport at 5:50am - train was quiet."
,,Very Convenient,5.0,,"Very convenient but be prepared to walk! As long as you can follow directions, you will not get lost. Also be prepared of the influx of commuters during peak hours."
,,Great Network,4.0,,"signs are not very user friendly, and not much help for tourists, for a local it must be ideal. signs are confusing for new people to the city."
,,The only way to travel Singapore!,5.0,,"This really is the best way to get around. We have a Nets card or you can buy an EZ Link card. So much better than buying individual tickets. It works out cheaper and you can use them at some places to pay for food etc
Note, the minimum load amount is $10 and you have to have at least $3 on the card to get through the gates. Most places we went were about .80c fares and the most was $1.77 from the airport. We stayed near Farrer Park. So Changi to Farrer Park was $1.77. To buy a ticket for the same journey was $2.60.
We were over in Singapore in June 2017 and we had a few dollars left on each card and we just went back now, April 2019, and just added money and used the same cards.
For Nets you can dl the app and your smartphone can read the card and tell you your balance as well as transaction history etc
It really is the only way to get around!"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Very easy to use transport system. Its quite easy to get around on this system.
You can pretty much get to most places using this system.
The fares charged per trip are very reasonable.
Our only complaint was that we had $2.43 remaining on our train card and when we went to catch a train that would have cost us $1.54 for the fare, the turnstile would not open, saying that we had insufficient funds on the card."
,,The only comfortable way to travel around Singapore.,5.0,,"The MRT is clean, airy, safe and a good model for other cities to follow in terms of underground rail provision."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Cheap, clean, efficient. Envy of many countries. Buy an EZ link card if you plan to stay more than two days. Works on buses too!"
,,Best way to commute in Singapore,5.0,,"Buy the Singapore Tourist Pass which comes with a validity of 3 days, 2 days or 1 day. Provides unlimited travel on MRT and SMRT buses. Easy and hassle-free way to travel in Singapore."
,,so easy to use and efficient,5.0,,"such an easy system to navigate, trains are never delayed! Even if you go over the ticket credit, or as I did, use the ticket twice in 1 station; staff are happy to rectify!!"

,,Very effective transport,5.0,,"A very effective transport system. It just works. Check if it is worth while to buy full day tickets. Also kids under 7 years can travel free even if they are above 90cm high, but you need ID."

,,Thankyou Singapore for a comprehensive map!,5.0,,"Loving the MRT map and how easy it is to use the whole public transport system! It’s easy to get a ticket and top them up for each trip, and super easy to read the maps.

How’s the focus on safety on the platforms! Top notch, you have to check it out, barriers and doors on the platform

Def use the SMRT public transport system to get around Singapore, no need to be scared, it’s not run by Transport Sydney... clearly!"
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,The MRT in Singapore is a good and cheap way to get around. It's a very efficient and intuitive system to use. It has different lines and there are times where you have to change lines to get to your destination. All destinations are only a few Singapore dollars to reach and you can get two day passes that cover both the subway trains and buses so is good value.
,,"Cleanest, fastest and easiest",5.0,,The best way to travel when in Singapore. Extremely easy to use once you get a hang of it. Just refer the maps..

,,SO EASY TO USE,5.0,,What a great Tr. So easy to get where you want and so fast just a shame we cant have this in australia.
,,Fast efficient and cheap the way PT should be!,5.0,,"Most rides are 80c so a Smart card purchase will do most people for 3-4 days without a top up. Good frequency, signage, access and air conditioned carriages make this a breeze to use."
,,Easy accessibility,5.0,,"The MTR is a breeze to get around. Stops are well marked,but make sure download the MTR app for accurate and current service. Connecting via weekend buses, service is not well reflected on Google Maps and not all bus drivers are able to help you navigate to where you need to be."
,,"CLEAN, IMPRESSIVE, FAST METRO",5.0,,"You can get from airport to virtually any place in SINGAPORE for a few SGD. Very clean, technologically impressive and one of the best I have travelled in the world. Signs to get around the metro system are plenty and easy to follow."

,,Very reliable system,5.0,,Comparing this system to what I have in the UK this wins hands down! Never had to wait more than 4 minutes for a train and the prices were great. Ideal train station locations and used it often
,,"Great system, easy to use and very reasonable prices",5.0,,"Tourist tickets can be purchased giving unlimited travel for 1, 2 or 3 days on the MRT and buses. The 3 day card costing S$20 plus a S$10 deposit on the card S$16 for 2 days). Or, if you want to combine the MRT with walking and taxis, just purchase an EZ card with say S$20 credit plus a deposit and use it for the duration of your stay. (Much cheaper than buying tickets per journey). Beware, not all MRT stations have facilities to purchase these cards and some (e.g. Somerset) do not open until 10am. Orchard opens at 9.30am and there can be queues."
,,Great transport system,5.0,,"Easy to use, affordable and covers a large part of Singapore. Note, if you are going to Marina Bay Sands or Gardens by the bay use the MRT stop at Bayfront!"

,,Great,5.0,,MRT always on top priority to go to others place in Singapore. The Cart is always clean and the schedule is always on time. And it’s connected to other transportation mode
,,Super Clean.....,5.0,,Like everywhere in Singapore the SMTR is super clean not like trains / buses at home. They are very frequent so you aren't sitting around wasting your time. The best thing about the train is the air conditioning that makes the trip enjoying. Inter changes are very easy to use and take you every where.
,,Good system,3.0,,A very good MTR system which all automated and no drivers or staff on board Covers most the city Clean tidy efficient
,,Should use,4.0,,"The subway system in Singapore is one of the best I’ve ever used. Efficient, clean, accessible and air conditioned and cheap. They go almost anywhere you want. Don’t waste money on cabs."

,,Awesome system,5.0,,Pain free way to travel. Simple maps and easy to follow directions. We purchased both single trip tickets and the Tourist Pass. The Tourist Pass is highly recommended as gives you unlimited travel for 1-2 or 3 days for a fixed price.
,,Inexpensive and very easy way to get around in Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT (MRT) is an excellent transportation system within the entire Singapore city-state. There are eight different lines with many transfer interchanges between the lines. You can get almost anywhere in the city in just a few minutes. And, if you are a visitor to Singapore for a few days stay, be sure to purchase the visitor’s pass which allows unlimited travel on the MRT and surface buses for 1, or 2, or 3 days. The three day pass costs S$ 30 per person, with a S$ 10 rebate when you return your plastic passcard to them (within five days of purchase). The cards cannot be topped up, but that is just a minor point."
,,World’s best Metro system,5.0,,"Used this system a lot on our recent visit. Easy to use, helpful attentive staff and inexpensive. Can reach almost anywhere in Singapore. Trains and stations spotlessly clean inside and out and ticket purchase is made easy from ticket machines."
,,Grwat transport,5.0,,"Was a bit sceptical and scared to use it at first. After numerous people telling us it was great, we bit the bullet and bought an ezlink pass at a seven eleven store loaded it with $10 each and haven't looked back. The service is easy to navigate and if you get it wrong .... what the heck you are on holidays anyway."
,,Always Use MRT,5.0,,Whenever we visit Singapore we use MRT and eash time we visit it continues to expand! Tourist travel at discounted rate. Trains are frequent and reliable. Train and stations always clean and tidy.
,,Not bad and pretty cheap,4.0,,"The cost of getting around anywhere always weigh on a travellers mind!
I debated 2 days in Singapore can I get everywhere by cab (airport - downtown $30sg average) or MRT it.....
After pricing it up I realised whatever I was doing I needed to get about, cabs will quickly add up (and local cabs I heard are funny with taking cards let alone Apple Pay etc, and Uber is gone, some Grab app is here in its place), I chose the option of MRT.
Airport MRT station is easy basement at the new Jewel and between T1,2,3.......for T4 you need to catch a shuttle.
You have to buy an EZ-card it’s $12......$5 for the card and $7 of rides. I bought and added $20, you can buy at the airport station or a 7/11.
The MRT map is super easy to navigate, although pronouncing the names is a bit 50/50!
The stations and trains are also pretty easy to navigate unlike say New York.
As a virgin user, I found the Singapore system, fast, clean, cheap and the best way to get around, as good as the one in HK.
Yes you can use Apple Pay, but I never even saw the locals use it......not brave enough with the mass crowd of folks trying to use the train - the ezcard was super fast to use and in the space of one day I must’ve taken the train 11 times on day one alone, have over $18 left on my card......airport, orchard, harbour Front, marina, Chinatown, Somerset, raffles, city hall, bayfront were all visited in one day - total spend $9......how about them apples.....waaaay cheaper than Toronto, London, New York!
Still have plenty for day 2 and to get back to the airport (which by the way was around 20 mins ish)."
,,Faultless way of exploring the wonders of Singapore,5.0,,"Get a tourist pass and enjoy this great way of exploring Singapore. Cheap, clean and so easy to use. Nothing else needs said really, great system which allows all to freely travel in this city."
,,Great way of travelling,4.0,,Easy and cheap. Very punctual. Some station news easy accessible. Very clean. Well maintained. Great job.
,,Most impressive transit system I've ever experienced,5.0,,"Sparkling clean stations. Ubiquitous coverage. Inexpensive pricing. Why would anyone living in or visiting Singapore ever need a car?

Exceptional planning and governance makes this happen and a citizenry with a strong sense of pride in their ownership of it keeps it in tip top shape. We'll done Singapore! You are a model for other cities, large and small, around the world."
,,Great Connectivity and affordable rides,5.0,,Great Connectivity and affordable rides to anywhere in Singapore. I suggest you take MRT pass from the airport itself and travel anywhere after that.
,,Wonderful transportation,5.0,,"SMRT is wonderful, fast and very clean way to get around Singapore. Singaporeans are lucky to have this excellent transportation service, cheap too."

,,Really easy to use!,5.0,,I'd never used the MRT before so was slightly apprehensive about ticketing and navigating. It turns out I had nothing to worry about. The maps are easy to use and the ticketing machines are very straightforward to use. This is a great way to quickly get around the city.
,,Very well connectivity,5.0,,MRT in Singapore is one of the world class InterCity transport well connected and supplemented with bus service. Stations are built in a child friendly way and customer service was God too.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,The subway is easy to use and quick. Just make sure you have no more than 10 SGD notes as the machine's don't accept large notes.
,,Wonderful,5.0,,The transport system is amazing. It is well labelled and easy to follow. Combined with a NETS@ezipay card it was able to take us everywhere we needed. Heard an announcement that due to track work services would be reduced to 10 minutes. I wish we had a service so infrequent (lucky if we have a bus every 30 mins in my area). The only disadvantage was trying to work out the bus network as it’s not as well labelled as the trains.
,,The best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore metro is certainly one of the best and fastest way to travel around Singapore on a visit. It is very easy to use, extremely safe like the rest of the city and simply spotless."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Cleanest, Most On Time subway train service that we have ever experienced. A great place to get away from the heat on your way to wherever in Singapore you may want to go. Surprisingly affordable!"

,,Excellent Service,5.0,,Air-conditioned underground trains ; there are ladies with white gloves to direct you; the carriages are very clean; The MRT is very easy to navigate.
,,Super-efficient System. Some tips for you.,3.0,,"This is a great, highly efficient transportation system but we spent more time buying tickets than on trains, and judging by the fact that they've set up Disney-style zig-zag snake lines at the ticket machines it's a recognised issue.
Tip 1 Stock up with low denomination notes and coins
The machines will not accept notes higher than SGD5, which, in Singapore, is small change. You just don't see many of them and no ATM we used offered them. So you have to carry a pocketful of coins in the hope you have enough to buy a ticket. And coins that the machines is happy with. I was getting a 20% rejection rate. It's annoying when you've queued for ten minutes and your money isn't accepted! Go to the 'Ticket Office', change your money and rejoin the queue.
Tip 2 Re-use your ticket
This is the first transport system I've used which charges a booking fee! 10c is charged for a ticket; it's refunded if you use the ticket for a third time and a 10c discount is given if you use it for a sixth, and final, time.
Tip 3 Don't just read the signs which face you
The MRT has a lot of signs. But many are single sided so you may walk the length of the hall in search of your exit to find that you passed it because the sign faced the wrong way, or you were walking in the wrong direction. Be aware to look at both sides of signs."
,,Singapre Tourist Pass is the Way to Go,5.0,,"If you're a tourist get the Singapore Tourist Pass. We got one for 3 days and paid at the kiosk a the airport and didn't have to wait in any lines and were able to board the train immediately. The 3-Day pass was unlimited travel on the MTR for 3 days then it turned into a regular EZ link card where you just put money on it and go. You can only get a refund on the $10 deposit at the airport and certain locations.

The transit in Singapore is like no other, everything was so clean and air conditioned. The trains were always on time within a few minutes of one another, we never had to wait that long. I also like how they have the glass windows up along the train tracks so no one can jump or push anyone onto the tracks like they do here in the U.S. I enjoyed riding the transit very much."
,,"Efficient, clean and reliable. What more could you ask ?",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT might not be as comprehensive as some understand systems in the world. but it is excellent value, trains are frequent, and thanks to the law that prohibits eating and drinking on the MRT, all trains are spotlessly clean. They are also extremely safe and you can travel at whatever time of day or night you choose and feel secure."
,,EZ Pass,5.0,,Public transport in Singapore is pretty great. Grab an EZ pass (especially if you're staying for more than 3 days) for $10 (preloaded with $5) at convenience stores or Changi airport. And top up at train stations or 7-11s as you go.
,,cheap and convenient,5.0,,A very easy and convenient system. Purchase the Ezlink card and use it oin trains and buses. Easy top ups at all stations and also 7 eleven stores. No other transport necessary when in Singapore.
,,Easy way to get around in Singapore,5.0,,Very clean and cheap way to get around in Singapore. Trains run frequently and it is easy to understand the routes - clear maps. All stations and trains spotlessly clean and safe to travel at any time.
,,Super efficient and clean!,5.0,,"Coming from NYC, and have rode the subways in Paris and London...the MRT in Singapore stands alone! Inexpensive, clean, safe, no loiterers, no beggars, air conditioned! Fantastic just like Changi airport."
,,WAY TO MOVE IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,"We found the train SMRT system of travelling around Singapore quite easy to navigate, and although at times very busy it was fast, efficient, and very clean. You can get unlimited travel passes S$10 for 1 day S$16 for two and S$20 for three although there is a S$10 refundable deposit on the card. It also works for the local busses we thought good value!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The MRT is clean and modern and the perfect way to get around in Singapore. As a tourist you can buy a card for $18 ($8 is refunded at the end of the day) with which you are able to access the MRT all day and go as far as you like. The trains are frequent and usually not crowded.

There are barriers along the side of the track which open automatically when the train pulls up. This safety feature is a great idea as it prevents accidents and suicides. Thoroughly recommended."
,,Best,5.0,,The MRT is the best though never imagine we could go and travel so easily with the kids very safely we were 4 days in Singapore and used only MRT to travel to places we wanted to visit. The map is very easy to follow connectivity impressive keep it up Singapore
,,Great way to tracel,5.0,,"Used the MRT for the first time in March, it is clean, efficient and very easy to get around and has great air conditioning. You have a travel card (like an Oyster card) that you buy at the station and can top up anytime. There is an MRT station within walking distance of all major attractions. Try it, its fabulous!!!"
,,Best transport ever!,5.0,,Buy your Ezee card at the Mrt station or any 7 eleven and you're set to go.We put $20s each on our cards and travelled by mrt all over the island.Its clean efficient and superb value.
,,Well organised.,5.0,,So easy to use the trains in Singapore. Very well organised ticketing machines. Must have coin or small notes for some . $5sgd or less. Cost varies from $1.60.
,,Easy and comfortable,5.0,,"The best transportation ever! If you are a tourist, just get your tourist pass and go wherever you like"
,,Top class,5.0,,"As a local I find it an injustice when locals (mostly) complain about our MRT system when there is a delay or breakdown.

They should look elsewhere in Europe America and other parts of Asia before whining and complaining.

Try maintaining a 24/7 train system.
Look at the positives and the cleanliness and hygiene factor!

Be thankful for its endeavours to be efficient and safe.

We should look and focus on the positives and allow them time (although not too long) to forge a safety first culture and maintain the system properly with a strict regime and replacement of genuine and reliable parts."
,,Too many disruption this few years,3.0,,"Singapore suppose to be one of the country with best public transportation, but lately there is too many case of disruption on the MRT system which cause the nation to go into chaos due to to non systematic arrangement of alternative transportation from station to station, the station management sometime close the elevator system altogether at few station and caused a slow flow of commuters.
Overall the public transportation are consider better then most country in Asia but hope the Singapore government will improve them soon."
,,The ‘S’ stands for Smart,5.0,,"Clean, fast, efficient, safe and cool (air conditioned). An easy way to travel and experience Singapore’s neighbourhood diversity. There are a few card options, so check their website for information as to the best travel card to purchase for your needs and length of stay.

The Singapore 1-2-3 day unlimited travel Tourist Pass is an easy way to travel, but you have to return the pass within 5 days of when you first purchased it to get your $10.00 refund per card. Only specific SMRT locations sell the Singapore Tourist Pass that you need to return to for your refund. This may be an inconvenience when traveling throughout the city if you have to detour to a specific location to return your card for you refund.

The Ez-Link MRT card is like a debit card. You put money on it as needed at any MRT station, in minimum denominations of $10.00 at a time. You need to maintain a minimum balance of $5.00. When you scan the Link card to enter or exit the MRT, your remaining $ balance will be displayed. A reminder to add more money to you Link card will also be displayed. When your card falls below a balance of $5.00, just go to the ATM looking machine and use your credit or debit card to add more money to you Link card. Easy, easy, easy!"

,,Getting around Singapore,4.0,,"The MRT is good value by world standards. It’s clean and fast. Mostly reliable although breakdowns can occur.
Outside most MRT stations (probably all) you will find bus stops and taxi stands and you can also order a grab taxi (Singapore’s version of Uber). There is also Go Jek. You can pay cash or load your credit card so download the app or apps.
Trains usually run every 3 to 5 minutes and you can check the maps at the station or download the MRT app and signage is easily understandable to know where to change lines (denoted by different colours such as red line or green line). Just make sure you jump on headed in the correct direction.
Anyway it’s a pretty good system and in one day you will be an expert at riding the MRT.
Enjoy Singapore!"
,,Perfect for Everyday commute and trips to town,5.0,,"The MRT is perfect for daily commute to work and trips to town as the downtown line is clean, reliable and not too crowded. Even for visits to town or festivals are a nightmare, we would opt to take the subway instead of driving to avoid the jams or long waits for parking."
,,Ease of Public Transportation,4.0,,"Singapore is well connected by the train system. If u have time to spend, you can get from the far end of Singapore to the other by the MRT. Of course there's breakdowns and stuff like that but there will always be staff to assist you in case you get lost or stranded. Bear in mind of the following:
1. Make sure u get a route map from the Passenger Service Counter. The lines are colour-coded and at times you need to switch lines to get to where you are going. It can be confusing at first but you can get the hang of it.
2. Avoid peak hours travelling during weekdays. You might have to wait quite a bit before getting on board 1.
3. Purchase a normal ""ez-link"" card (Not the Tourist Card) for your travels and load it with at least $20 depending on how much travelling you wanna do. That way, u don't have to queue at the ticket machine everytime u wanna catch the train. Plus, its cheaper and the card can be used to pay for bus fares, Sentosa Express and on ""Comfort"" and ""CityCab"" taxis too! Less cash in your pocket. If you still have some value in the card, you can have the balance refunded at the ticket office at every station.
4. No eating or drinking at the train station or onboard train.
Having said all that, it is safe, clean and reliable.
Enjoy!"

,,Excellent,5.0,,Mrt in Singapore is the best we ever experienced. It is very efficient and clean and you can get to any part of Singapore in no time
,,Best way to get around in SIN,5.0,,"Very well connected and efficient. You can download the MRT map from net and save on your mobile. Additionally from google you can also get to know which exit to take after getting down at a station, for a particular attraction. You can buy tickets in 3 ways. Either buy specific point to point journey tickets, but this will be expensive not to mention that you waste time for every travel to stand in a queue. Second buy a tourist card for SD 20, roam unlimited for 2 days and surrender the card after 2 days and get back SD 10. In this irrespective of how much you travel in 2 days you cannot spend more than SD 10, so a little wastage will be there. Third buy a SD 12 card in which you will get a travel cost of SD 7. You can recharge it if the value falls below SD 3. The cards are a cheaper travel option, in addition you can use the same cards for bus travel. Go for third option if you are going to stay in SIN for more than 2 days, or are a regular visitor to SIN off and on. Eating inside the metro car is strictly prohibited, follow the queue at all times. Proper signage will guide you to different directions. Metro travel is definitely cheaper than taxi, however, the travel time is more. So decide wisely."
,,Singapore MRT great system,5.0,,Great value and reliable easy to transfer between lines and go to many different locations. Buses easy to use and cheap

Trains are air conditioned which with the constant heat is a real bonus.

,,MRT_ Singapore,5.0,,"Mass Rapid Transportation/ MRT is one of the best of its kind in thw world while I was in Singapore for 10 yrs, I noticed why it is one of the bes,when I started riding New York Subway. It is fair to say New York system is older. But New York should keep up, in terms of cleanliness, safety, and toilet/lift availability to the public."

I avoid the MRT whever I can."
,,Excellent SMRT,5.0,,Reliable and Excellent service by SMRT in Red Line. Best of my knowledge SMRT train frequency is less than 3 min in peak hours. I never waited for 5 min in station. SMRT buses also excellent. I take connecting bus to my office. Bus frequency be too good.

,,Richard Wee,5.0,,"Smrt is very efficient, clean n punctual. Also it covers a great part of Singapore. It is so convenient n reliable.

,,Travel is simple,5.0,,"The price to ride single trip is approximately $1.50 in clean, air-conditioned carriages & in the stations. To travel one-way to Changi airport, the price is $2.80 per person. Very cheap option & highly recommended. The line ends at Expo and you need to change train for one more stop for the airport."
,,"Clean, Punctual, Easy To Use, Safe",5.0,,"Singapore offers a MRT (subway) which is superior to many other countries. It is inexpensive, easy to use and very convenient.

This is the way to travel whilst in Singapore."
,,Used for 3 day tourist visit,5.0,,"Very easy to get around, everything is in English and signed just like the tube in London (but better!). You can get tickets and top up cards. The top up cards can also be bought from all 7-Elevens. The top up cards cost S$5 + the value of travel - outs had S$5 to start and we ended up having to top up by the minimum S$10. The card bought from 7-Eleven is S$5 + S$5 travel money, the card bought from the MRT station is S$5 + S$7 travel money. The MRT is air conditioned and most (if not all) of the stations come out in or next to a mall."
,,"Easy to use, Tourist pass a bargin",5.0,,"We used the Singapore transportation system during our stay at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. The subway was close by and had entrance via a mall.

We got the tourist pass for S $30.00 for three days. You get a refund of S $10.00 if you return the card on the last day. Now that is a bargain.

The subway system is very clean, almost spotless. People are polite and there is no shoving or pushing. It is very easy to plan your route with the color systems and also directional information.

The pass is good for buses above ground as well.

Take advantage of the underground to walk where you want to go also. It is air conditioned, huge and flat. It is so hot in Singapore this means of getting around and staying comfortable is the best thing to do."

cross the city to see the many attractions. There are several different ticketing options that range from single destination to multi day passes.

The trains run on time through a network of underground stations that makes it seem you are travelling through another city - only this time its underground."

,,Wish Australias Public Transport was as good,5.0,,"The MRT is te easiest and quickest way to get around Singapore but does take a day or 2 to get use to. Make sure you have internet the first time you use it as we had massive trouble figuring out which station and line we needed to get to our hotel.

We got the $12 card which you get $7 credit with. You can use flashpay to pay for food at a lot of smaller food vendors (but we only figured this out a day before we left).

Card can be used on buses and trains. Only a small fee each trip. I spent $30 for a week travelling around doing all the highlights of Singapore.

There are trains every few minutes so you are never waiting long. They are so clean. No eating or drinking on any transport so no rubbish anywhere. Everyone is polite and respectful and the purple seats saved for elderly, pregnant or disabled people are offered straight away to those that need."

,,"Impressive, convenient, & easy to use Subway System!",5.0,,"The SMRT (or MRT for short) was the best subway system I have ever been on. NYC nor London do not begin to compare. It was super clean for starters. There were friendly, helpful guides throughout the stations to help answer all questions (in English). If you're not sure which direction to go, there is a large, clear map on each side of the platform showing you the route to take. Maps are posted throughout the stations and each subway car. There are also a series of 'friendly behaviors' posted at every station to remind you (or perhaps educate you) to be kind and thoughtful to your fellow passengers. This was a fast, efficient, and convenient way to travel throughout Singapore."
,,An Excellent Integrated Mass Rapid Transit Service,5.0,,"We purchase

My Wife and I purchased an ez link pass each and used it throughout the nine days of our trip to Singapore. ( If you are Travelling by bus they require exact fare). The rail system is easy to use and well signed with onboard announcements and digital countdown of stations and even on board indications of which side the platform is. The buses are equally well equipped most have at least 2 swipe in and out card readers which also display the stop as you approach it, so even if you don't know the route you can sit near a reader which will display the up coming stop. At all the bus stops the length of route is displayed so you will know how many stops your journey will be. As you swipe into the system it shows the balance on the card, as you swipe out it shows balance and cost of journey. Beware though buses here can sometimes arrive 6 at a time at the larger interchanges but they always allow you time to get on."

,,MRT travel in Singapore,5.0,,"So easy to use. The only downside we found was that the Singapore Tourist Pass,on which you loaded your money, wasn't available at all stations (and not our nearest one), so we simply easily bought tickets when needed. The trains are clean and comfortable and announcements and signs inside the trains in English and very easy to understand."

,,Faultless,5.0,,Amazingly efficient and cheap. Incredibly clean. Singaporeans are disciplined and courteous which makes things even better. A ticket machine took our money but had no tickets. I reported it to the staff on duty who were incredibly helpful and issued us with paper temporary travel tickets. It was a bit of bureaucracy that's probably rooted in British times but the staff at either end were very helpful.

Trains are spotless and run on time.

We couldn't work out the ticket machines so we found a ticket office where we bought day travel passes which alowed us to use both buses and the SMRT, these cost £5 each plus a £5 deposite. I would recommend these to anyone staying in Singapore."
,,Easy,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and frequent trains. Very cheap compared to London. You can buy single or return tickets at the machine or buy a Oyster type card. Only problem is that you cannot use large denomination notes in the ticket machine so make sure that you have some small notes or coins."

,,Top rate service!!!!,5.0,,"Having suffered the London Underground for many, many years, both as a commuter and a tourist, what a DELIGHT and PLEASURE it was to use the SMRT services whilst recently in Singapore. It was clean, tidy, well lit, well signposted, organised, SO disabled welcoming and friendly, it was safe, polite, excellent value for money. Comparing it to London, I honestly do not think that I could even use one adjective in the same vein as I just did about Singapore!!! People queue to the sides of the doors to allow people off the train first. All signage is in four languages. There are on train info videos in the four languages telling people how to board/leave a train; whom to give up their seat too; to move down the train, PLEASE; what to do in the event of an emergency.
Major cities of the world, TAKE NOTE AND LEARN FROM THE WAY SINGAPORE IS RUNNING ITS MRT SERVICES. Rest of the world has SO MUCH TO LEARN!!!!!"
,,Efficient,5.0,,Great transport and easy to use.We travelled continually using this method and the fares are reasonable.Even travelled to Sentosa Island so no need to take any expensive trips.
,,Fast clean efficient,5.0,,"Can't bel8eve I was a little stressed about trying to get around on Singapore's MRT despite having lived in Hong Kong and UK where it's a way of life.
The stations are brightly lit and very clean. The trains are also clean and comfortable. It connects you to many parts of Singapore although you may have to take buses as well. Although Singaporeans complain about trains breaking down, I have not experienced it."
,,Most convenient and easiest way to get around Singapore,5.0,,We traveled all over Singapore with a child and a toddler in tow in the MRT everywhere and it was the best way to see Singapore. So well managed and easy to use.
,,Singapore's Tourist Pass Best Value for Money,5.0,,"The best way to get around Singapore using the MRT (train and bus) service, which run 'driverless' and efficiently around the city/country. Purchase 1, 2 or 3 day pass for all the train/bus travel over those day(s). If you purchase the 3 day pass, you receive S$10 back. We used this refund to buy second 3 day pass. MRT stations are well marked to locate your platforms and ensure you are on the right train. We found fellow passengers and bus drivers very helpful in catching the right transport."
,,This is about the mrt and the bus system,1.0,,"So one day I was running to my bus 335, I stopped at the exact time but the driver didn’t see me I waved but he didn’t see. At this point I was starting to get mad and I took bus 180 to Chinese garden and on 180 the driver scolded me and when I arrived at Chinese garden station I was waiting for the train but the train I had to wait so Long and I got frustrated and finally the train arrived and the train was going so slow.

In conclusion I would like to say to those stupid and blind drivers to be more smart then dumb.

I was going from 7 Jurong West st 41 to Jurong East."
,,Best Public Transport Service,5.0,,"Easy , efficient,friendly, MRT or bus average waiting time is 4 mins! Can you believe it, public transport that is a joy to use and clean. The only way to move around Singapore."
,,"Excellent, World-class service (as you might expect)",5.0,,"We caught this service from Marina Bay Sands just to see what it was like. Took the Circle Line as far as Harbour Front, then the North East Line to Dhoby Ghaut, finally the North-South Line back to Marina Bay. Compared to Sydney Underground this is pretty World Class - no graffiti, no mess, nice clean MODERN rolling stock and a real travel experience. Busy though, even during off-peak hours, so it must be quite an experience during their rush hour! :-)"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Clean, frequent and so easy to use. Felt very safe, such a good way to get around Singapore. Buy your transport card at 7/11."
,,Easiest means to get where you want to go,5.0,,"SMRT maps are located at multiple locations within every station, making it easy to determine how to get to your stop, and each station has a local area map to pinpoint the best walking route to your nearby destination. That, plus frequent service and relatively inexpensive fares make traveling on the SMRT enjoyable. The bus system is also quite extensive and most lines tie into the rapid transit system at one or more locations."
,,Very clean and easy to navigate,5.0,,"Very clean subways and buses and very easy to navigate, prices are very fair too, you can also purchase various passes to suit your needs"
,,"Fast, efficient, clean and safe",5.0,,"Cards used on MRT can be used also on buses. There are always someone to assist and security is uppermost. There are cute signs at end of a row of seats indicating use for older/needy travelers: ""stand up Sally"" and one asking to keep the noise level down when talking on mobile.
The system is certainly one to be proud of and also there are escalators and lifts to reach the platform. It is impeccably clean and well maintained."
,,Clean & Easy,4.0,,We used the MRT to travel to the city after arriving at the airport. Very clean and easy to use even for someone like me who has no idea of geography. Very regular train and the system seems to be able to deal with congestion very well
,,Always on time,5.0,,"On our recent trip to Singapore we used the SMRT, we found it to be clean, cheap and always on time. The stations were easy to find as they have street signs around every where indicating the closest station."
,,Always love the SMRT for getting around the island quickly.,5.0,,Singapore MRT is one of the cleanest and fastest ways around the island. You can buy a standard ticket and reload it 6x and get a % discount. The SMRT will be a faster route than driving or riding a bus. If you want to make a quick trip from Changi airport hop on the green line and get off at one of the junctions. I like to book my hotel locations near SMRT so that I won't have to walk to the nearest bus stop or grab a taxi to get to the MRT.
,,If only all cities had this!,5.0,,"A real eye opener. Spotlessly clean. trains every 2 minutes on busy routes, multiple station outlets on different streets to help you on your way. Amazing cheap fares. The best way to get around this lovely Island."
,,"Simple, cheap and safe",5.0,,All i say UK please learn this is the way for transit. Clean air con feels safe at night ( like all of singapour) tourists card worth it as no hassle and 3 days all transport
,,Cheap way to get around,4.0,,"Make sure you get a good street map as the stations can be hard to find. I liked using Maps.me.
If you are only going to make 2 or 3 trips, it is cheaper to buy single use tickets. You can also reuse these tickets 6 times and save 10 cents each time."
,,Efficient and clean,5.0,,A transit worker was a bit rude when we boarded the train after a downpour. I guess we were supposed to walk home. . .
,,Best way to get around the city,5.0,,"Excellent way to get around the city $16 (+$10 refundable deposit for the card) for 48 hours - trains and stations have aircon and a spotless, hardly ever crowded and the people who where around were super friendly and helpful - just grab a map and go !!"
,,The. Best. In. The World.,5.0,,"Just wow. This is how you run a MRT. Spotless and flawless. No delays, all very smooth. Stations superclean and very easy to find your way."
,,One of the most economical and convenient modes of travel !!!,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is one of the best and the fastest way to travel around this small island city. The tickets are very economical and the metro is available for almost 20 hours. One can buy MRT card and preload with amount which is convenient for use. There are discounts if the amount loaded is for more than one day. The app is fantastic and it tells you everything you need to know for using the MRT.

,,First Class,5.0,,"Wow, what a system, it's clean efficient and takes you everywhere. Signage everywhere to take you where you want to go.
Other North America cities that have subways should learn from this country's system.
There are wall to wall barriers that prevent people from falling on to the tracks.
Trains are spacious and clean .
You are able to use your cell phone while you travel underground.
Its the way to travel."
,,Amazing system,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 3 days and used the MRT on each of these. What a superb system, so easy to use. Very clean , there is always someone, staff or travellers, who is willing to assist you should you need it. Very very impressed!"
,,How to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is the quickest and most cost effective way to travel around the city.
The service runs every few minutes with clean comfortable trains, just don't expect to see a driver. The stations are well staffed so there is always someone to guide you or help with the ticket machines.."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a clean, inexpensive and efficient way to get around the city. While a tourist pass is offered another option (especially if you are staying more than 3 days) is to purchase an ezlink card which costs $12 (sgd) and comes loaded with $7 to use for fares. Like the DC Metro or SF Bart the trip cost varies based on distance. Many shorter trips are less than $1 sgd. Trains come quickly and the signage at the stations is excellent. It is a great way to get around."
,,so easy to use,5.0,,"The best way to get around the city and its so easy to use

With trains every 2 to 4 mins you really waste no time zipping around the city.

The Tourist Card was perfect hassle free option for me, but not every station as a top up desk.

If you only have a couple days stop off in Singapore and you want to see the city use the MRT"
,,Easy to get aruond in Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT starts from Airport to almost all of the place in Singapore. The cost of the Trip is very cheap, I have been travelling around for 4 days and only cost me around 15 US dollar. The map within MRT is very clear, also the announcement is loud and clear you won't miss your stop."
,,Great option when travelling off peak,4.0,,"Changed from driving to taking the MRT to work.

Two key benefits:
- I get to exercise
- Saves a ton of money in parking in the CBD

During peak hours, can be very packed but if you time your travel, it can be a very pleasant and fast journey.

Fortunately, I have not experienced any service disruptions but by all accounts, this can be hell.

Overall, a great and convenient mode of public transport"
,,One of the most efficient in the world.,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is probably comparable to the most efficient railway systems in the world. Trains come and go at no time, stations are strategically located in commercial, tourist and residential areas - and are inter-connected so we don't need to transfer from one station to another."
,,7 days in Singapore,5.0,,"Great way to travel. Trains almost every 3 minutes. Clean and easy to negotiate. Access by lifts and escalators, some have public toilets."
,,Improvement in reliability,4.0,,Convienent to use mrt as mode of transport. It can reach most of the tourist sites n even local food sites. Check for mrt day pass if you travelling around
,,Easy fast,5.0,,"Many people use SMRT ، its really easy to use even by Tourists ، affordable , and fast way to trasbort ."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The transit system in Singapore is amazing. It is efficient with service every couple of minutes and with mobile service even underground. I know of a city that could learn a lot from Singapore but upgrading their existing services would choosy them billions.
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,"A fantastic and impressive way to get around Singapore. Clean,safe and air conditioned. Fast,easy to use the system and to find your way around the different lines. We always buy a 3 day Tourist Pass which costs S$30 which includes a refundable S$10 deposit. The different lines cover all areas of Singapore and if advice is needed staff in the ticket offices are very helpful. Recommended."
,,Number one in Singapore,5.0,,"Definitely the best public transport I've ever been on anywhere in the world. Air-conditioned (definitely a win), easy to navigate, cheap and simple (especially with an EZ-Link card). The trains come often and the system is just very well organised. If you don't at least go on an MRT during your time in Singapore you've done something wrong!"
,,World Class Transit System - Who Needs a Car?,5.0,,"Island wide network and growing by the day the MRT is clean, on time, and safe. Have lived in Singapore for 15 years and have never needed a car!"
,,Short Walk from Cruise Terminal in Singapore for Rapid Transit,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) is a short 10 minute walk from the cruise terminal in Singapore. It's easy to find. Just follow the signs. Every sign is in English.

Once in the station for the SMRT, it was easy to read the signs for our stop. We rode the SMRT to the Singapore Botanical Gardens. You take the Red Line, beginning at the Marina South Pier station, one stop to transfer at the Marina Bay station to the Orange Line. (Marina Bay station is also the station you would get off at to go to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.) The trains are very clean and were air conditioned. We always felt safe.

The Botanical Gardens have their own stop on the Orange Line. Be aware if you decide to walk to the National Orchard Garden (highly recommended) there isn't a SMRT station nearby. There is a station under construction, though. It is recommended to see if it is open when visiting. Instead of walking all the way back to the Botanic Gardens station in the heat, we took a taxi back to the cruise ship. There is a call button that you push to let the taxis on the street know there is someone who needs a ride. Allow yourself a lot of time, as the taxis don't pass the Gardens frequently. We actually ended up picking one up that was dropping someone off."
,,Short stopover,5.0,,"Very easy to use, tickets cheap, clean, frequent trains, a very good example of how this sort of system should operate."
,,Got a 3 day tourist pass,5.0,,"You can only get a 1, 2, or 3 day tourist pass at certain stations. We got ours from the small ticket office at Chinatown station.
The pass is good value and you can use it on trains and busses. The trains were excellent and easy to navigate, just look at the map, find the colour of your line and the final station for the direction you want to go. Then it is really easy to find your train.
I would definitely use again."
,,Travelig around Singapore,5.0,,"Traveling via train in Singapore is a must! Its efficient and organize, its clean as well and well maintain the Tourist pass is a great deal also"
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Similar to Hong Kong. Clean, fast and efficient. Easy to use ticket terminals and maps. Used for a one way trip from Orchard Road to Marina Bay after clocking up 21 walking miles in last few days"
,,"Frequent, clean, efficient",5.0,,"Immaculately clean, efficient, cheap and organised. My only negative would be the near I mpossibility of buying a standard ticket with a note bigger than $5 or a credit card. My advice would be to buy an EZLink card if you are going to make more than 2-3 trips"
,,Smart Clean and easy to navigate,5.0,,"This smallish MTR network allows cheap access throughout the city . Not all stations have staffed ticket offices but the large numbers of ticket machines are multilingual and easy to use. I bought a three day tourist card and this cost $30.00 including a $10.00 returnable deposit on the card.
The cars themselves are all Air Conditioned and there is no access to the track from the platforms as on some older networks. The stations and underpasses were clean and problem free as is the majority of the public areas in this great City state."
,,Great subway,5.0,,"As good as any subway I've ever ridden anywhere in the world. I've riden over a dozen subways, this isn't the biggest but it's as clean and efficient as any!"
,,Great pibloc transport,5.0,,"Gets you there safely and quickly. Good value, compared to, say, London. Clearly marked and announced. A pleasure to ride and experience"
,,Loved the service and used it for my 6 days stay,5.0,,"It was my first time in Singapore or infact first time outside India, so was not really sure if I would be able to use public transport as I was not aware about how the system works outside India. But the MRT service in Singapore is so much structured that I ended up using it during my 6 days trip. I did not use cab on any day since MRT was so convenient and friendly."
,,Best way to get around town,5.0,,"The Singapore metro is clean, easy and convenient. Perfect for transport and a bit of cool. Most (all we tried) ticket machines didn't accept credit cards, so PÅ prepared with coins and small notes"
,,"EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAN! Beautiful infrastructure, well maintained.",4.0,,"Superb transportation ifrastructure with one exception: The ticketing and access points. Unlike the brilliant Tokyo subway which uses RFID chips, the SMRT uses ""not-so-smart"" old-fashioned mag-stripe ""swipe"" access points.

Also: we ""pre-purchased"" tickets only to discover that you cannot do this: they are only valid for the day of purchase. And it wasn't worth the hassle to go reclaim our lost money."
,,Really simple to use,4.0,,"We were a bit hesitant in faffing about with public transport when only in the city for 24 hours each way but was fast, clean, cheap and efficient and easy to use."
,,Works well for visually imparted/partially sighted,5.0,,"This subway system gives longer time to the passengers to disembark/board the train. There are doors at least along the green, the orange, the blue and the red line (those I have seen). Everyone is queuing in an orderly manner before boarding, but it seems that people stand mostly in front of the door when on the train. So if you want to get off fast, you should be near the door."
,,Excellent transport,5.0,,The best way to travel in Singapore. fast and easy. Buy a metro card and top it up.A lot of space in the metro and very frequent. You will find metro stations all over the city.
,,Best way to know the city,5.0,,"With a tourist card you can go everywhere. You can choose 1 or 3 days cards. There is wifi in the metro, that helps a lot. You can take the metro inside the airport."
,,Go anywhere SMaRT and more Environment aware,5.0,,"Go anywhere SMaRT and more Environment aware. Love the system. Hope it extends also to JB etc, good news Katong will be part of the network. Also connections to busses is well organized."
,,"The cheapest, most frequent, fastest and most efficient way to travel!",5.0,,"Beautifully air conditioned, allows your journey to be in absolute comfort. Its rare not to be able to get a seat. People are much more aware of getting up for someone else in more need of a seat than in the UK.
Best and cheapest way to travel - about a quarter of what you'd pay on the Tube."
,,AVOID THE TOURIST CARD,5.0,,"Ok so the MRT is the best way going around Singapore. It is fast, safe, cheap and comfy.

But to all the tourist out there avoid getting the tourist card if you are staying for more than one day. Instead get a normal ez-link card. Cost of 15 dollars and you can ride for 5 or 7 (can’t remember) of them. And for that money you can go really far and make several trips. You can only top it up with 10 dollars though.

You can simply not ride enough subway to make the tourist card worthwhile.

When you are leaving you can also use the remaining money to buy stuff at 7/11. And if you are feeling generous give the card to the next tourist you meet at the airport."
,,Excellent Service,5.0,,SMRT very convenient for the visitor. Information board very clear. Elevator for elderly or baby stroller available. For tourist that bring big luggage also can use the lift.
,,"Fun, efficient, clean and user-friendly",5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore we enjoy riding on the MRT. There even ""angel""-like people around who insist on helping us if we look the least bit uncertain about what we're doing."
,,"Cheap, easy and fast way of transport",5.0,,Its a transport of choice at Singapore. Singapore MRT is very well developed system. All Singaporeans follow the rule and the frequency is good all through the day. Very user friendy system. Take EZ link pass as it works cheaper than normal tickets. Only if you are 4 passangers then for a long distance (Like Singapore zoo ) its convinient to travel by taxi. (For us it was 30 min by Taxi and 1.30 hrs by MRT from little India)
,,Convenient and fast transportation choice,5.0,,"The SMRT network can reach you almost everywhere in Singapore, if you are just a visitor, you do not need to look for other transportation service."
,,Very easy to get around,5.0,,"We purchased the 2 day visitor pass for 20$. The sytem is convenient to most attractions with a little bit of walking in between. It is easy to understand the lines and where they go and where to transfer if necessary. The trains were not that crowded and most stations had shopping areas for convenience. The trains appeared to run on time and we never waited more than a few minutes for the train. The pass also gives you access to buses but we never had the need for a bus. The nicest, cleanest mass transit system we have seen!"
,,Cheap & easy transport,4.0,,Really great prices and you can get to pretty much anywhere easily and quickly. I used this during my whole trip to Singapore. The only time I didn't use it was when I got a taxi to the zoo as it was easier. I was just being lazy.
,,Efficient and cheap,4.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore , from downtown , CBD to local heartlands. One of the best subway systems in the world."
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap and super helpful staff...",5.0,,Nothing more needs to be said....! Wish Australia had the same... We were in Singapore for a week and we spent $50AUD for the two of us on transport from one end of Singapore to the other - and we even got cash back when we redeemed our cards at the end of the trip...
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Getting around is easy. Buy the Tourist pass even if you are using the service for a day or two. There is a deposit but refund is quick and easy when it is returned. Stations and routes are well marked and equipment is modern, clean and well maintained. Warning... the underground stations share space with retail stores at several stops and getting around the maze and then up to the surface on the side of the street you want, can be a bit confusing. Still, it is a great way to get around Singapore!"
,,Travel around Singapore with Ease,5.0,,"The one and only way to get yourself around Singapore is to use the fantastic MRT system. Get yourself a local pass as it is so cheap when you use it. There are other ways to pay, but this is the best. I think it costs $12 and you get $7 worth of travel you can fill it up either at the counter or at the machines.
The MRT's are very regular, very easy to use as signs are clear and easy to read. Lifts available for those with wheelchairs or buggies."
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"Everyone recommends the tourist day use pass, but unless you are doing lots of travelling not worth it, Better to get an ez link card and pay as you go. Reduced fare to as low as 83 cents for short ride. we did lots of travelling each day and the most we used was $7.00 on a day. Includes bus and MRT. MRT is clean, safe and staff very friendly and helpful."
,,Arm yourself with an EZ-Link Card,5.0,,"and the Singapore MRT map, and you are good to go. Refer to Google Maps; the directions there are pretty accurate. The MRT is clean and efficient, though at times there may be some delays. One of the cheapest ways to get around in Singapore - for the locals and tourists. :)"
,,"Fast, clean, easy to follow instructions and efficient",5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a model for other countries. It is clean, efficient, moves large numbers of people with minimum of fuss.

You can buy a EZlink card from MRT station for 12SGD. 5 $ for deposit which will return when you give the EZlink card back and 7$ balance. The ticket price is cheap. The stations are very neat, tidy and free WiFi. Well organised and wide. Remember the last train/bus will be at 11.30. Once the balance finish you can recharge from any MRT station kiosk machine. Minimum recharge is 10$."
,,World Class,5.0,,"We have been to more than 30 countries so far and this transit system is the best we have experienced so far. Very reasonably priced, the equipment is spotless and the staff see to it that it runs smoothly. Singaporean people treat this Jen with the respect it deserves. As visitors we appreciated it as we explored the city."
,,A breeze to get around the City......,5.0,,The SMRT was so easy to navigate we regretted not getting the $10.00 all day pass the day after we arrived. All signage and station details were in English and simple to get from point A to B. There is a $10 deposit on the daily pass that is fully refunded when you return the pass.
,,that work realy very good,5.0,,Waited not lomnger than 4 Minutes for a train. With a 3 Days Card it's very Cheap anf extreme helpfull. Nothing else needed.
,,World's cleanest and safest,5.0,,The Singapore subway system is easily the world's cleanest and safest. Anyone visiting Singapore should quickly become familiar with it and use it.
,,Clean fast efficient cheap whats not to like!,5.0,,"Great system very clean very organised - trains arriving all the time - probably not good for people with mobility issues as a long walk and escalator to the actual trains
Tickets about 1.50 - 2.00 dollars per journey so only about 1.00 - safe to walk around in the evenings too"
,,What a great way to get around 😁,5.0,,"Super service, great value and an awesome way to get around Singapore quickly. Service from the staff was very friendly and they are super effective"
,,MRT Rides,4.0,,Very convenient transport System with clear directions. Very safe and comfortable for families and tourists who enjoys free and easy trips across the island nation. Connections to bus rides from stations and taxi stands etc. etc...are just as easy to get to your destination in this summer country whole year round. Food outlets and atm including shopping centres are very convenient from most MRT stations.
,,MRT is great!,4.0,,No issues apart from buying tickets - you cannot buy single/cheap tickets with card or big bills - very frustrating for tourists who don't have cash when they arrive and the ATM only give 10 dollars or higher (can only buy tickets with coins or 5 dollat bills)
,,"Clean, fast cheep",5.0,,"We totally relied on the MRT system for our 3 day stay. Don’t use the tourist pass , do as the locals do and pay as you go! It’s so cheep. Only issue you can only buy single ( return) rides using cash. You can’t use payment / credit card saved us a fortune from using tourist bus or taxis"
,,"Clean , efficient and Quick",5.0,,"I purchased Subway ticket to save time because there are long queue for taxi in the most of areas in singaphore and it is faster than cars.It is easy to use,clean and no long waiting like Some routes in London and Paris Underground..The ticket very cheap It around 2 SGH for one single trip or you can take take day or three days ticket depend in youe needs."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day tourist pass and did all our sightseeing by using this. A very cheap way, spotless trains and all on time. Don't waste your money on expensive tours; its fun to do what the locals do and be part of Singapore."
,,Getting around,5.0,,"This is a fantastic and in-expensive way of getting around Singapore. You can get a travel card from the station for around $12, (ours did us for the time we were there)"
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,We purchased an EZ card each and off we went! The balance remaining on the card is shown at the turnstiles at every scan. The trains are fast and modern. The stations well signposted and easy to make your way about. Was surprised by the steepness of some of the escalators and the moving walkways at some stations
,,"Clean, Efficient and Easy to Navigate",5.0,,"A great choice to get around town. Might take a minute or two to figure out the ticket machines (unless you are a regular metro user in your home town) but otherwise not complicated at all. There are two ticket options--single ride, which is priced based on distance, and a day unlimited tourist pass. The day tourist pass is not available in all stations for purchase. For example, you can't get it in Raffles Place but can get it at the next stop which is City Hall, I believe."
,,MRT,5.0,,"My husband and I just spent 8 days in Singapore, and thanks to the SMRT System, we were able to travel all over the island with no trouble. We were staying on Orchard Rd. At the Singapore Hilton, and there was a Station just across the street. We advise buying a day pass, and using it to go everywhere. It’s safe and easy. We went to the ticket office to get our passes, and it was easy to find."
,,Using MTR is very easy,5.0,,"Singapore MTR has an excellent net of stations. MTR is fast, cheap, clean and easy to use. You get almost everywhere by MTR."
,,Nicely connected!,4.0,,"It might get a little confusing at first, due to the many lines. But after awhile, you will find the many lines too convenient for travelling all around Singapore!!"
,,Spotless efficiency,5.0,,"I have never known a public transport system to be so spotlessly clean, and to be so incredibly efficient. We bought a three day tourist pass for our stay at a cost of $20 for the travel and $10 for the cost of the card ; so a total of $30. The card deposit is said to be refundable. Yet to try it.
The only drawback is that not all stations sell the tourist pass."
,,Very Efficient and Very Clean,5.0,,"This is the best underground that we have used. Ticket machines are easy to use, the signage is really good in the stations and on the trains.
The trains are spotless clean as are the stations. Plastic seats on the trains that are easily cleaned making it more hygienic.
The tickets are very reasonably priced."

,,Singapore Transport,5.0,,"Used the Singapore Train and Bus service for 5 consecutive days. Purchased the Tourist pass, (3 Days then 2 Days) from one of the major station in City Center. Be aware that not all stations sell the tourist pass.The cost is $26 for the 3 Day pass which includes the $10 card deposit which you get back if you return the card. This pass allows you unlimited travel on the train and bus network. It suited us as where we were staying was not near a railway station so we had to catch a bus to a train station.

The train system is very extensive and you are able to get to all the major tourist attractions using the train or train/bus service and the frequency of service couldn't be faulted. Trains are driverless so they ran every few minutes on all lines and were extremely clean as there is no eating or drinking on the train/bus system"
,,The MRT system is very convenient and easy to use,5.0,,"The MRT system is very convenient and easy to use. They have a great site that allows you to get very specific direction and cost. I love the system there and we have used it many times. It is clean and well organized, and easy to use."
,,Good service!,5.0,,"Comparing to China, not as good. I think the bus systrm is much accurate to get to the places tourist want to visit, but good. Do not buy the tousist pass at the airport. It is a reap off! Buy it at the station."
,,Great value and excellent.,5.0,,"We were amazed at the value for money, efficiency, quality, non-crowded, safe, clean MRT. They should all be like this!"
,,Great way to see Singapore.,5.0,,"The funds that Singapore receives from their very high taxes on vehicles is put to very good use in their rapid transit. The system is fairly inexpensive, extremely clean and the subways/busses come very frequently. The 1, 2 or 3 day Tourist Card is a great deal. The only problem that I had was attempting to locate the maps of the bus routes since seeing the city from a bus is a great way to get a feel for the city."
,,Efficient and affordable,4.0,,"The trains are so good. Announcements are made clearly about next stop, where to change, to mind the (miniscule) gap when alighting. No person or baby carriage could ever fall between the train and platform. Trains are not for sightseeing as they seem to be mostly underground, but if you want that you can take a bus."

,,Very efficient except the payment method,4.0,,"Great service! Very regular, fast and good intercity connections. Just be sure to have small notes and coins with you before you make your way downstairs. I think the machines take anything under $10"
,,Fast and easy transport,5.0,,"We bought a MRT card at the airport for $10 ($5 non refundable deposit). Don't be fooled into buying the more expensive tourist card ($38). Airport to city hotel stop was just $1.75 and most travel was less than $1. Why waste money on cabs when this was cheap, easy to understand and could travel safely anywhere to see the attractions or out of the city."
,,Efficient,5.0,,It is quite simply the most cheapest efficient way to get around Singapore you can buy a tourist card for $10 deposit and you can have unlimited use of busses and mrt train network for $10-1 day $26-2 days or $30 dollars 3-days return your card on your last day of use and you get your $10 dollars back.clean easy to understand an absolute essential part of your Singapore experience.
,,Amazing Transport,5.0,,"This is one of the most clean and efficient subways I have seen; only Japan can match this subway system. Due to its strict regulations, which always should be followed as they have security cameras in the stations. A metro card will be your best bet and is affordable. All of the stations allow you to visit tourist areas easily. Due to rules, there is no trash and the subways are clean; unlike most American metro stations."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"Compared to many of the metro systems we’ve travelled on, this is way up there - efficient, clean and very easy to obtain tickets and find your way round."

,,So easy,5.0,,"I would recommend using public transport in Singapore it’s so easy.
We brought a 3 day tourist pass for $38 each which got us all over Singapore on all public transport day and night for the 3 days. The stations are in all the best parts of town and very well sign posted so easy to navigate. As a female traveller I felt very safe using the MRT even at night.
The trains are clean and fast and come every 2-5 minutes. The bus service especially the double decker bus is also a great way to see the city.
Just remember to follow the rules- no food and drink and NO DURIANS on the train."
,,So good and so easy!,5.0,,"The metro and buses in and around Singapore are so good and easy. The Singapore Tourist Pass is the best value if you want to get around alot. Choice of either a 1, 2 or 3 day pass, it allows you unlimited travel on the MRT, LRT and buses. You can only get it from a few stations just ask at the station closest they'll tell you which ones. There's an extra cost for the card but when you leave and take it back they give you that back."
,,Go for EZ Link card,4.0,,"Go for Ez lInk instead of purchasing per trip, and dont forget if you're a rare visitor to Singapore you can redeem back your card deposit upon your last day in SG."

,,easy to use and convenient!,5.0,,"I was spending four days in Singapore and upon arrival I got an MRT card so that I would not have to worry about figuring out individual tickets and avoid waiting in lines.
I put $50 SGD on the card (which turned out to be WAY too much). I was happily able to turn it in at the end of my trip and get the balance back in cash. I just had to show them a copy of my passport. You can do this at the same little booth where you buy the card.
Piece of cake!
The lines were easy to figure out and the trains were clean, prompt and frequent. Great signage in the stations."
,,Just the best !,5.0,,"If you are used to the Metro system in Berlin/Germany you must think that you are in heaven !
Never have seen a cleaner Metro.
No graffiti, no food , no destroyed seats!
It is such a perfect system. It is so easy to book at the machines. Clear and fast. All is so we’ll organised. I felt so ashamed and was wondering why it has been so dirty and not treated with respect in Berlin.
Go and see and test it!"

,,Singapore trains,5.0,,"A very frequent and well organised system. Signage in English is excellent. The public bathrooms are generally very clean. It’s also amazingly cheap to travel on this system. Singapore has invested heavily in public transport, both buses and trains, and it is heavily subsidised from car costs."
,,Clean and efficient,4.0,,"The train system is wonderful and easy to use as everything, including the ticket machines are in English. The only down side is that they stop at midnight so you need to be cognizant of this. Some stations are in mall areas and can be confusing."

,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"This is a great way to get around the city.
Trains are frequent and very clean. In fact the whole system of malls, walkways etc are clean and above all safe.
We bought a tourist ticket for 2 days but beware. It’s not 48 hours but 2 calendar days so watch if you buy late in the day.
Also you get a refund on the electronic ticket but a ticket supervisor said this refund would be void if you used the automatic top up machines. We got caught out on the days and we got our deposit back then just purchased a return ticket."
,,Efficient and punctual,5.0,,"Its a cheap and efficient way to explore the lenght and breadth of Singapore. But having said that, for first time travellers it may be a bit confusing ....relying only on the maps may lead you in a wrong direction!!!(happened with me on the first day and wasted much time and energy).So I suggest to ask fellow passengers the route before boarding."

,,Amazing as always,5.0,,"When I visit Singapore I buy a mass transit card and use it often. I use the trains, but the buses are also efficient and fast for those places that are not close to MRT stations. It takes a bit of practice to figure out how to get out of MRT stations since there are multiple exits, and sometimes attached underground shopping malls make it even more complicated. Just allow a few extra minutes and you'll be fine...."
,,Inexpensive and fast,4.0,,"The cheapest and easiest way to get around Singapore. The Tourist pass can be purchased at the SMRT outlets and the SMRT is very simple to navigate, the locals are super friendly and offer assistant if lost. All SMRT have food and drinks."

,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is like Switzerland with humidity: everything is neat, tidy, and runs like clockwork. The MRT (subway) will take you to pretty much anywhere you'd like to go (the Zoo being one of the notable exceptions - you have to take a bus to the zoo from the MRT stop). Get an EZ-Link card to reduce costs. Service is not 24/7, so be mindful of when the last train departs."

,,"Good, quick, clean",4.0,,This is what every city needs. Good service. Always on time. Clean and very cheap. You can get anywhere you need
,,Good and clean,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, clean and efficient. And no delays at all. For tourists you have two options – either EZ link card or tourist card for 1-3 days. My advice is to go for EZ link card as it can be used also in other attractions in Sentosa and even if you are traveling very long distances it will be challenging to spend more than 6 SGD in single day on rides (on average we spent 5 SGD per day using MRT and busses). And the best part - if it gets too hot outside, then MRT provides realaxing comfort in cool environment."
,,Ez Link or Tourist Pass,5.0,,"The Tourist Pass at a cost of $10, $16 or $20, will give you unlimited travel for 1, 2, or 3 days, bus or MRT. Perfect for a short stay.
If you are there for longer, the Ez Link card will cost $12 (a $5 fee and $7 pre loaded for travel). You can also add additional monies if required.
As we were there for more than three days, what I particularly liked about the Ez Link, was that we did not have to concentrate all our travel to the 1,2, or 3 days of the Tourist Pass, and in addition, any unused credits were refunded at the MRT ticket office at the end of our stay.
Whatever you choose, the MRT is certainly a very cost effective way to travel."
,,Seamless travel,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is very easy to use. The fares are fair. The stations are clean, safe and well sign posted.

This is no Tokyo subway system! You can travel almost everywhere in Singapore using the MRT, or connect to local buses that take you as close as possible to your destination. And it's relatively inexpensive."
,,Use this,5.0,,"I bought a Singapore Tourist card, $20 for 3 days and all of the smrt and bus journeys that you want. It is so much easier and way cheaper that going to machines and dealing with small change at every stop."
,,"Amazingly good, amazingly cheap",5.0,,"The SMRT is the only way to get around Singapore as a tourist. The trains are clean, frequent and amazingly inexpensive. There is a very comprehensive coverage of the island, the systems and ticket machines work well and if you just want to get from A to B then they are easily the best way of doing that. The air con works well and the only drawback is that they have only a few seats but most journeys are short. A very good system and much the best choice for travel in Singapore"

Fellow passengers were friendly, they stood to let my elderly father sit, and felt self in well lit clean carriages. Easy to read network maps available in pocket size and also on each station/platform wall. Buy the pass at airport or major interchange stations and obtain your deposit prior to going through immigration at the airport. Very easy and cool too!"
,,SINGAPORE RAIL TRANSIT,5.0,,"Im not the savviest traveller, but i have to say this was pretty easy to use. Once you find the platform you need your either going forward or back in direction. They are driver less trains. Its clean because there is not eating or drinking on any platforms, you can see all the way through all carriages, i felt safe at all times and if you need help just ask. They were super friendly and helpful. You'll need to buy a metro card initially and i think it was $15 dollars which was something like $7 for the ticket and the rest was credit on your card. You just keep topping it up with money, the smallest top up is $5 and you have to do this at Seven Eleven stores, otherwise you can add $10 and up at the stations. Loved it, if only all transport was that easy. I would suggest you have about $10-$15 credit if you are in Singapore for a week and plan to use it to get around."
,,Only foreigners know!,5.0,,"This is really a clean country and even the MRT is super clean. Every ride is a comfortable ride whether seated or not.

Fares are very affordable and reliable. Never breaks down for days... and if there is a short break down, transport will be immediately arranged and if late for work, one can get little notes of explanation to your employer. Not sure if they still do that but I am sure they do. Good job SMRT! People! take the MRT! it takes you all over the island in super good time and enjoy the sight along the way (some parts are underground)."

However our trains are mostly packed with no hope of getting a seat anywhere from as early as 2 hours before peak hours. If you are an elderly citizen or someone with lots of bags to carry you are going have a tough time getting a seat. No one is going to get off their seat for you, sadly! People will close their eyes or look hard into their mobile phones and totally ignore those who may need a seat."
,,Clean and efficient with exceedingly polite users!,5.0,,"Best way of getting around town. System works flawlessly (at least it did for us), while customers in general are polite in the extreme and stand very quickly to offer seats if required. If only it were like that elsewhere on metro systems!"
,,"So clean, easy and fast",5.0,,"Definitely aim to travel on the MRT system in Singapore, it’s clean, easy and fast. Fares are good value, we opted to purchase an EZlink card and use it for the duration of our stay to make the fares cheaper. You can get a refund on funds you don’t use at the end. No need for a timetable as the trains come very regularly, the longest wait we had was 4 minutes."
,,One of the best Public Transport Systems,5.0,,"With great connectivity - practical interchange system between Buses and Trains (MRT), you can reach any corner of Singapore without having to call for a cab. Quiet inexpensive mode of transportation, the MRT has different lines covering different areas of Singapore."

Spaciously designed stations and well placed displays and in train announcements and displays makes it effortless for new users.

It connects to each corner of the city (only Singapore Zoo is not directly connected) with an extensive network. The good part is that it is so easy to navigate as there are signage at every 100 meters (or even less) to guide people in the right direction. You don't have to speak to anyone. Just see and navigate.
,,Fantastic train system,5.0,,"We got an ez-link card when we landed at Changi aiport. The train network is clean, safe and very easy to use. The tap on and off was super convenient and loading more money on the cards was easy. We chose this card over the tourist pass as it could be used for sentosa express also. We just followed the signs and colours and found most attractions had what station to get off at which made planning trips out easy. Fantastic system."

It's easy to use the system. If your a tourist best to get a Singapore Tourist Pass at any station. You an get 1, 2 or 3 day passes. Our 2 day pass cost S$26, but you get S$10 deposit back when you return them at the end. They give you unlimited travel on the MRT and the buses.

Station staff are very helpful and the trains are clean and safe."
,,Go any where in Singapore,4.0,,If you want to go any where in Singapore than use the MRT. Very efficient and cost effective. Clean and frequent.
,,Great Rail Service,5.0,,We used the rail system everyday as such a cheap way to get around.Make sure you by a rail card which can top up.We used the rail to get to the Singapore Zoo.Trains are very regular so never have to wait long even on the weekends. So long as you use the rail map to plan your trip as you may need to change lines (which is very easy)you will have no problems. Platforms and trains can be very busy at times so expect to stand on the trains for part of the trip.
,,Great Value - Easy to navigate and High Tech,5.0,,"This is one of the best Mass Transit trains we have ever taken. Very safe, clean, inexpensive and easy to use.
Just purchase an Ez-link card which is $12 Singapore dollars at any MRT station. You get $7 travel dollars on card because card costs $5. You can top it up if you need to but if you are only in Singapore for a couple days then $7 will probably be enough.
You can top up the card at Kiosks located at each MRT station. Each person needs a card! You cannot share cards.
To use the card you scan at the MRT entry gate and it will show you on screen how much you have left on card. When you are finished traveling the MRT and are leaving station you scan out and it calculates the charges and removes amount from your card. Typically a ride costs 50 cents to $1.20 depending on distance traveled.

You can download maps to familiarize yourself and find your stops but it is very easy. The routes are colour coded. They also use numbering system & the name of station. Example. CC4 is Circle City route station 4. It is as it sounds. Circles the City. NS5 would be North - South line station 5 etc. Basically you just need to take the train in the correct direction but the numbers are sequential so if you know which stop you need just look at the maps where you get on the MRT. There are lots of attendants to help if you need directions.
You can get money back at any MRT counter if you still have money left on the card. Make sure you ask for the cards back. They are good for several years and you can loan them to family or friends."
,,Good modern system,4.0,,"Well priced but a number of common issues. Sometimes we felt we'd walked halfway to out destination underground, with very few travelators. And signage was awful in places. i.e. Orchard station, on a busy crossroad with no pedestrian crossing to acted as an underpass, impossible to find the right exit for the required corner even after 3 tries and asking locals!"
,,The Best Value Transport Option In Singapore,5.0,,"Basically every bus and train in Singapore is covered by this Tourist Card. It is that good you can plan your day around it. If I was to give one travelling tip it would be to book your hotel as close to an MRT station as possible, then visiting the rest of Singapore using the SMRT will be a breeze."
,,"Great, easy to use",5.0,,What an easy and cheap way to travel the city. Probably the cleanest public transport I have ever been on.
,,Best in the world?,5.0,,"The MRT May be the best transport system in the world IMO. Everything is so clear and easy to negotiate, the trains are spotless and link up so easily."
,,Very impressive MRT,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is truely the best way to travel in Singapore. It is very clean, air conditioned and has connectivity to all the attractions. We purchased standard ticket which you can recharge 6 times before every travel. However there is a card of SGD30 also available which can be purchased at Airport itself."
,,A pretty remarkable mass transit system,5.0,,If you were staying in Singapore for a couple of days get a tourist ticket. Just remember that at the end of your visit you can return your card and get $10 off. It’s really a remarkable subway system as it is air-conditioned and extremely clean.It is also faster to get from point to point is in the subway system rather than using a taxi.
,,Super efficient,5.0,,For a short stay buy a three day pass for about $30 SGD. Never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a train to get just about anywhere easily. Using the simple London Tube style map any visitor can navigate the line changes/connections very easily. Announcements are clear and multilingual.
,,Excellent Transit!,5.0,,I've taken a lot of subways in various countries but the Singapore MRT was truely the best. It is very clean and it's stations are beautiful. It is very easy to get around with and you pay according to the distance or stops to your final destination. You can use the same card up to six times (adding 6 trips) instead of paying a 10 cent deposit every time.
,,Singapore Tube wins again,4.0,,"Great system. Easy to read maps. Tanoy systems that work and you can understand (in English).
Visual aids to show you which direction the tube is going plus which side the door will open.
Cost effective transport system across Singapore.
Clean with plenty of options on how to pay for your ticket or top it up (multi lingual).
Signs everywhere to help find your way.
Only downfall I've found is trying to get around Orchard Road tube with so many exits etc.
However it embarrasses the tube system in London and Sydney."
,,Quick and efficient and pleasant!,4.0,,"This underground mass rapid transport train system works well, is clean and bright and spacious, and get’s you to your destination in super quick time. In new lines, they even have stewards posted to point you in the right direction or to help answer your questions when you appear lost. There are shops and eating places around the stations including convenience stores selling hot food."
,,The way to travel!,5.0,,The most convenient way to travel in Singapore with excellent connectivity to almost any place in Singapore. The tickets are economical and will not be very heavy on your pocket and well maintained and on time service.
,,Fantastic way to see the whole island,5.0,,"We bought an ezylink card each - put $20 on it and it lasted us fo 8 days. We traveled from Clark Quay each day to Jurong, Pasir Ris and all over the city. Found it to be a quick easy and cheap option. The first day we went to the Botanical Gardens - 4 trains and a bus - less that $5"
,,Perfect to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"Right from the point you get at Changi International Airport till flight back from Changi Airport, SMRT is the ultimate your ultimate companion.
The wide connectivity and frequency is commendable. Cleanliness and staff service is like icing in cake.
For tourists, the 3-day visitor pass is a must.
All metro stations have train maps and direction boards for easy navigation."

,,Easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Like the rest of Singapore the MRT is spotless and efficient. I used it to get around the city during my recent stay and found it easy to navigate and cheap.
,,Singapore SMRT,4.0,,Visited Singapore in Feb 2019 and found the SMRT very easy to use and cheap. It was exceptionally clean and efficient and should be held up as an example of what can be done.
,,Cheap and Easy to use,5.0,,Very good infractstrure and clean. Drinking and eating is prohibited after gate. So watch out for penalitys
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,The SMRT is clean and efficient. It's easy to use and if you can buy one ticket at a time - just punch in your start and end and an individual ticket is available. Remember to swipe going in and coming out
,,Very convenient but,4.0,,"We spent 2 days in Singapore and mainly used public transport. The network covers the key areas of the city and beyond. The stations are clean and so are the trains. However, on site, there was no visible information to understand the type of tickets most adapted to our needs. We tried a couple of ticket offices which were closed even during the day. The ticket machines only give you the option to buy single or return (the latter being no good if you’re not quite sure whether you will travel from the same stations). You can also top up a local card which we could not enquire about (since the ticket offices were closed) and didn’t bother checking online. In the end, we bought singles each time we were using SMRT. You may want to do your own online research before coming to Singapore."
,,What a brilliant public transport system,5.0,,"My wife and I did most of our travelling using the MRT system. Bought an EZ Link card for $12 ea ($5 card fee and $7 travel. Easy to reload and can be used on all public transport. without the hassle of having cash.

It is a wonderful option but it was busy in the early morning. I gave up my seat to a woman but a man jumped in instead. I am glad bad manners are not restricted to North America."
,,"Slick, silent and superb",5.0,,The MRT system in Singapore is one I am well-used to but nevertheless find it very efficient each year I visit. It is comprehensive in its coverage of the city (and wider) and is excellent value for money. Much better than taxis which can get snarled up in the heavy traffic.
,,Convenient and quick,5.0,,Clean and fresh MRT space. Modern and well cared vehicle. Easy to locate everythings thanks to smart arrangement of board sign.
,,Clean fast efficient,5.0,,This must be one of the best metro systems in the world. During the day the metro seems to run at around 4 mins between trains. Very good signposting both on the train and the stations. All trains are immaculately clean and of course graffiti clear. A very safe system with excellent cheap tourist passes S$10 deposit and S$10 per day which you can top up. These cards available at the airport and some central stations. I believe but can’t confirm also at tourist information centres and other outlets
,,Excellent transport,5.0,,"What the heck! Am I in Star Trek? Clean, efficient, on time transport. Very reasonably priced and easy way to get around. Staff are super helpful and make you feel welcome. What underground transport staff do that anywhere?? (Well actually Moscow too to be honest)."

The trains are very clean and really frequent- I never had to wait more than 3 minutes for a train."
,,Great System,4.0,,"Well priced metro for a large city, although not a large system. Paid $26 for a 2 day pass and if you hand it back you get $10 back. You needed to purchase at a ticket counter, helpful staff who are polite too.
It's an easy system to follow, very safe and clean. Every station I visited had a vast array of shops attached to it.
Ensure you swipe your pass every time you use it and you'll have no problems."
,,Easy to use and cheap,5.0,,Download one of the local Singapore apps for getting around as I found this better than google maps for getting around. Ticket machines are easy to use and tickets are cheap
,,"Brilliant, clean, efficient, cheap",5.0,,"This was a great way to get around Singapore. It's a pity the Mayor of London doesn't take a leaf out of this system. It would get cars off the road. There is no eating or drinking allowed, and it is so affordable. The most I paid for any journey was $S 1.25 (less than £1). Everything about it was excellent. The stations and trains were so clean and everyone was helpful!!. Great experience. Easy to use."
,,Efficient and rapid,4.0,,"You can learn the MRT system in few min. Staff, at different stations, always very helpful. My 3rd time in Singapore, I’m confident to be on the MRT anytime."

,,Get the Singapore Tourist Card,5.0,,Easy to get from the airport to the city centre with just one change. Fabulously clean and efficient system. Get the Tourrst Card when you arrived. I used mine to death on buses and trains. It is fantastic value.
,,a helping hand after a long walk,5.0,,we used the smrt after a day of walking around Singapore to the marina bay and gardens it was amazing so clean cheap and helpful the stations were called out also there was a map at the main entrance there were staff on who helped with the ticket machine and payment she was brilliant it is a great way to travel around the city
,,Very easy to understand!,5.0,,"I highly recommend using the SMRT. Very clean, user-friendly, uncluttered interface for getting around!"
,,"Fast, clean and always on time.",5.0,,If onlyMelbourne could have a system like Singapore’s transit train. We used it every day and found it very user friendly with clear and easy to follow maps as well as using it on an app on the iPhone. What a great service .. never late and the train was never dirty. Had good seating and lots of straps to hold if standing. All in all an excellent service
,,"Got us where we were going, but I don't recommend the tourist pass",4.0,,"I am, perhaps unfairly, comparing Singapore mass transit, to Hong Kong, which we used just the week before. Hong Kong was superior in several ways (train frequency, tourist pass, mobile app quality). That being said Singapore MRT got us everywhere we needed to go and a third party app worked well. We used the Tourist Pass, but for us it was a waste because we didn't use it enough and I was not able to get the deposit back. We would have been better off buying tickets. I tried to return the passes at the airport when we flew out for the S$10/card deposit, but discovered there is only one place at the airport they can be returned, at Terminal 2, roughly a one hour round trip from our flight at Terminal 4. So instead we came home with S$40 worth of useless cards."
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,"The MRT is one of the best transport systems in the world. Download the free app. Lines are colour coded. Most ticket vending machines don’t accept credit cards, be prepared with small note denominations, machines accept $5, $2 or $1 coins."
,,Simple and Straightforward,5.0,,"Simple, extensive, clean, frequent and inexpensive! With a 'top up' EZ card which can be topped up at machines with credit card, this takes all the hassle out of travel"
,,Easy,5.0,,"We visited Singapore for the second time in March 2019.

The MRT is very easy to navigate . Even changing trains is simple . Lines are colour coded for easy use .

The people and staff at the stations are also very helpful should you need help to navigate your way around ."
,,Rail System a breeze,5.0,,"The MRT is great. We stayed in Singapore for a week and used the train service nearly every day. We used daily tickets and found that was very cheap. Most places were about $3.50 return. The rail lines are colour coded so it is so easy. Wish something like this was available in Australia, trains are every few minutes. If not sure of anything just ask as people are very friendly."
,,Easy way to go around,5.0,,We used the MRT for our whole stay in Singapore. It's very easy and budget friendly. I don't recommend taking the day pass. Find it more expensive. We used around SGD 20 for a 3 day trip and that even includes the trip to Sentosa. Get the map on the 1st day and get guided
,,"Fast, efficient and relatively cheap was to get around Singapore",5.0,,"If you are a tourist you can get 1, 2 or 3 day MRT passes at a number of stations. If you are only intending on one trip whilst in Singapore consider taxis as they are pretty inexpensive by world standards"
,,Trip Selection simple using the Map,4.0,,MRT Stations are everywhere and easily accessible either via escalator or lift. Stations are well signed and open and airy. Trains are regular and the display indicates when the next train is due. All carriages are spotlessly clean.
,,Best MRT on South East Asia,5.0,,SMRT the best MRT on South East Asia. I think MRT Jakarta must learn from SMRT. Very clean. Very secure. I think you should add store inside.
,,Great to use,5.0,,I wish the train system in Australia was half as good as that in Singapore. Trains are always on time and they are spotlessly clean. If you miss a train then the next one is only 4 or 5 minutes away and you feel safe no matter what time you are travelling with cctv cameras everywhere. We used them everyday and found them great to use.
,,"Clean, fast and reliable",5.0,,"I've used public transport in many countries around the world, but nowhere does it run so smooth as in Singapore. Reliable, fast, clean, clear instructions and cheap."
,,"Very Clean, convenient and quick.",5.0,,The SMRT is a very modern system. It is easy to purchase tickets and use the system. The maps are prominently displayed and easy to read. The onboard signage is very good with visual displays advising where you are and good info regarding connection points.
,,Singapore 2019,4.0,,The SMRT was very efficient and a train arrived every two to three minutes so you didn’t have to wait long. You use a card that you can top up to get around on the trains and buses. The trains are very clean and and there are indicators to let you know when it arrives at your station.
,,Wonderful way to get around.,5.0,,"We love the SMRT as it is such a convenient way to travel. Buses and trains run at frequent intervals and are quite economical to use. We really like that they are so clean and safe. Our grandsons found the railway an adventure and enjoyed the lifts and elevators too, so much fun for them.
This is an easy way for tourists to get to different attractions and find their way about, an outstanding service."
,,Best way to get around. So easy and inexpensive. Clean too.,5.0,,No need to use taxi. Easy to use system with numerous stations. Ticket machine simple to use. Know which line the station you require is on. Select. Then select station from list. State number of tickets and if return. Put 10 dollar note in machine. Receive two tickets and change. Signage makes it so easy to get anywhere or change trains as required. Fast efficient service every few minutes. Automated trains and Aircon carriages.
,,The only ticket you will need,5.0,,"By far the best way to get around Singapore; easy and intuitive even for a visitor and/or monolingual English speaker. Do get a multi-use ticket from the office, they are refundable when you leave and far cheaper than getting a single use ticket every ride."
,,Easy to get around,4.0,,"The MRT is a great way to get from the airport to downtown. The fare is $2.80 on the blue line to Chinatown. It is slower than a cab, but a lot cheaper. As with everything in Singapore it is clean and well maintained."
,,WOW,5.0,,"Am so impressed with the MRT. Fast and efficient, spotless stations and carriages. Really easy cost effective way of getting around."
,,Singapore Holiday,5.0,,"SMRT is an excellent transport system. Clean, frequent trains (never waited more than about 8 minutes) and covers a all the areas we wanted to visit. It is well sign posted and there is no doubt where you are heading on the platform or hwne on board a train.

Fares are cheap, seating is limited but our grey hair almost guaranteed a seat being offered on every trip"
,,"Clean , punctual , just ideal",5.0,,"The 'tube ' in Singapore , is just so typical of the country. It works and works really well, a pleasure."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Fantastic MRT. Singapore has definitely got this right! So easy for tourists to use, and cheap. Would highly recommend anyone to use this to get around Singapore."
,,Easy enough and new,5.0,,Buying a ticket seemed the most difficult task. System is clean and new. Stations are conveniently located. Some have long tunnels.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Clean . And u can’t consume water or food . Very good . Well communication through out. Cheaper but expect to walk a lot between interchange trains like London tube systems.
,,TfL pay attention!,5.0,,"Clean, cheap, easy to buy a ticket, good info and easy to use. A quick and easy way to get around Singapore. London Underground could learn a few things...please"
,,Faultlessly efficient,5.0,,"This easy to use, efficient system is just brilliant. Clear easy to follow ticket machines, trains every five minutes or so, cheap tickets and easy to follow instructions means avoiding the choked roads is easy."
,,comfortable,5.0,,"Clean and on time. It is convenient to go anywhere, very convenient to use.Easy access to Katong and Chon Buru."
,,"Clean, Reliable, Easy to Use and Cheap",5.0,,It’s very easy to figure out the system. The average fare is around a dollar. Don’t make the mistake I made and buy an unlimited pass. Much cheaper to just buy an ordinary fare card and load it up with what you think you’ll use.
,,Mr,5.0,,"Great way to get around, so safe and clean. Such a contrast to other underground systems in the world."
,,excellent transportation,5.0,,"a lot of thanks to SMRT, travelling around Singapore is much easier. I can travel hassle free in Singapore just one top up away."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,Maybe the best mrt in the world. Trains are so regular and clean. Great instructions to help you move around.
,,Great transportation.,3.0,,It is a busy transportation. All people use this to go to work and back home. And you can’t get lost. It is very clean. I’m not surprise because they have a fine rules. Must try and have to try.
,,Rapid,4.0,,"Singapore it’s no exception when it comes to public transportion.
You can buy an unlimited 1,2 or 3 days pass. It will allow MRT, bus and Ferrie( didn’t do bus or ferry)
But it was worth 16sin$ for 2 days. Like all
Other places, we forgot to return in for 10sin$ refund. Lol
We really like the freedom of roaming on our own whenever we can, all u need it’s a map of the route and pay attention to which way it goes."
,,Quick clean efficient cheap,5.0,,"Easy to use, clean cars, run often so very little wait. Plenty of stations so never far to walk. No reason not to use MRT. Buy an EZ Link card ($5 non-refundable then add value as needed - $7 if bought at Changi) and use for buses as well. Excellent transport sytem."
,,So Convenient!,5.0,,"After two bus trips with many stops and a really long time sitting in the bus and trying to figure out bus routes we decided to try the MRT instead. Such a winner, it's easy to get around, fast and very convenient. Highly recommend it."
,,A Great Subway System,5.0,,"This was my second visit to Singapore, and the MRT is always my first choice of transportation there. Grab and taxis are good and I have used them both, but for affordability you cannot beat the MRT. I get a $10 prepaid pass, and with every entry and exit you see how much money remains on your card. It is also easy to add money to your MRT pass using a credit card. The station maps are easy to read, and if you plan your trip and know which stop is closest to your destination, transfers are easy to accomplish. Knowing your final stop and the line it is on, you simply make the proper transfer (if necessary) to get on the final line. Once at the platform, there are trains going in both directions. Walk up to the map, and the stops for the left train are displayed on the left map, and the same goes for the right. We never got lost once. The stations and trains are very clean (heavy fines for eating, drinking, smoking...and NO durian). There was safety in mind when the MRT was developed. There are no open tracks. The station has permanent doors that the train aligns to when stopped, and the station doors and train doors open simultaneously and close together as well, with a voice giving warning when the doors are closing. Occasionally there is a long subterranean walk to reach your train, but it is often a welcome air conditioned stroll opposed to the 92 degree 65% humidity environment outside."
,,Best transport system,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is been functioning since late 80’s. They are the fastest, safest way to commute across Singapore.

Kindly keep the MRT card handy as you could zip through various stations with ease. These are highly protected Zone & hence you need to keep the stations clean else you end up paying an hefty fine.

If you’re well versed with the coloured lines, you can go from one end of the Singapore to the other in no time & this is the most economical way to travel."
,,An easy way to get round Singapore in a short space of time,5.0,,If you know where you want to go and wish to get there quickly without needing to see any sights on the way this is a great way to travel. The trains are all clean and we found that they always seemed to run on time.
,,SMRT Singapore 👍👍👍👍👍,5.0,,"Fast,clean and really of a good service 👍👍👍 Easy access for all destinations and foreigner like me could understands easily wherabouts :) thanks!"
,,"Mayor DiBlasio, Governor Cuomo...",5.0,,"OMG. I live in New York City and do not take subways because they are so disgustingly dirty, often delayed and you can sometimes see rats scurrying in the tracks. I went on the MRT blue line from my hotel at Bugis stop to Chinatown and couldn’t believe how clean, efficient and easy to understand the system (signs are in English). If only N.Y. could get with the program !!"

,,"Rapid, clean, efficient",5.0,,I only used the MRT for one return journey during a two day stay but would have no hesitation in recommending it to other visitors. It’s easy to get around and everything is spotlessly clean. It’s also inexpensive.
,,Impressed,5.0,,Very easy to navigate the underground system in Singapore. Clear maps and information everywhere. Friendly staff.
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"Should get a prepaid card from the ticket office within the MRT station for three days, return the card when you leave and receive a refund."
,,very reliable,4.0,,"clean cars, easy acces and payment, running frequently until late, well connected to Changi Airport, like it should be!"
,,An easy and reliable way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"This underground system is amazing. Trains run regularly and are always on time and its great value. If you are a tourist, buy a tourist ticket and then when you no longer need the ticket go to a sales office for a partial refund."
,,One of best systems in the world,5.0,,"I first took the Singapore subway system over 25 years ago and was amazed at hoe clean and efficient it was. I am visiting Singapore now, and while it is more crowded and expansive, it is still a terrific way to get around town. The stations are clean the trains run on time, and the fares reasonable.
Having taken the NYC and London subways in the past year, I really appreciate the Singapore system."
,,Official,5.0,,Smrt I believe is same as that of other nations nothing special but yes helpful in avoiding the Singapore traffic and cheaper than the taxi.
,,Great way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"After landing at Changi airport, we chose to use SMRT almost everywhere we went. It was cheap and easy to figure out where you wanted to go. You buy a card and top it up just about most places."
,,Very efficient and reasonably Priced,4.0,,We always use the MRT it gets us from A to B in comfort and at a fair price. We have to get through the underground connections by walking sometimes past lots of shops a hazard if you have a shopper with you ha ha! Very clean and efficient and safe
,,Best Way to Get Around,4.0,,"Taxis are very cheap in Singapore and GrabCar works well , but nothing beats the MRT. It is clean , efficient and goes just about everywhere. Take a ride - you'll be impressed."
,,So easy,5.0,,MRT in Singapore is so easy to use and a great way to get around. Trains every 5-7 minutes so no need for timetables.
,,Safe and clean,5.0,,"I always use the SMRT to travel around Singapore. I mastered it on my first overseas trip and was travelling alone. I have always felt safe. The stations are amazingly clean and the service reliable. We has and impressive encounter with a staff member on our latest trip. Unable to locate the exit we needed, he accompanied us out of the station and walked us to the exit we needed."
,,So easy and value for money,5.0,,"We recently used the MRT to travel to all of the main attractions in Singapore. We brought a 3 day pass for $30 dollars , you get $10 back upon return of the card. It is such good value for money, exceptionally clean and clear as to how to get to your destinations. Trains run approx every 5 mins And everyone wanting to help if you look at all lost!!!"
,,"Convenient, fairly widespread but most importantly stroller friendly !",5.0,,"One of the best MRTs that I’ve see across all countries, it reaches most spots , every station is kid friendly and wheelchair friendly, connectivity is great inside ! You should experience the mrt if you are in Singapore"
,,Great fast way to move all around Singapore,5.0,,"Get the rechargable card to get a better price per ride as well as a fast convenient access.You literally can go anywhere in the City.Fast ,clean and always on time.Please be respectful the same way everybody is."
,,Efficient system but be sure to have small change for tickets,3.0,,"Stayed in Singapore for 3 days and used the trains for small trips. There is a card you can purchase for $20 if you are using the system more often but in our case, it wasn't warranted. To buy a ticket, be sure to have small change or notes for the ticket vending machine as it does not accept higher than $10 and it does not accept cards. There is no place to break notes and when we asked for assistance from the customer service area, all they did was point to the vending machines. We learnt to save the smaller notes for travel!"
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"Everything is in English as well as Chinese and Malay, so as long as you know what station you want to get to, it is pretty easy to figure it out. And it is cheap!!"
,,"If you want to travel through Singapore, this is the solution",5.0,,"Impressive network and coverage of the city, extremely cheap especially if you get the rechargable chipcard, very clean, many trains,... what to say? Strongly reccomanded"
,,Easy to get around.,5.0,,"Clean transport system, cheap, connection to other interchanges. Easy access on off trains. Helpful staff to give you directions."
,,clean safe cheap and easy,5.0,,"very easy to use, the most clean subway we have ever seen. a very cheap and fast way to get you from A to B"
,,Excellent way to get around quickly and cheaply,5.0,,"Even better than London’s underground - this transport system is clean, efficient and easy. Tourists can purchase discount tickets for 1 day, 2 days or 3 days - no need to worry about what correct fares are. The carriages are wider than London Underground, and so, even at peak time, didn’t feel quite so crowded as London.
Most stations are located under shopping Malls - so easy to access and convenient.
Highly recommended."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"I have been in many subways and mass transit systems in the world, and Singapore’s is by far one of the best in the world. Safe, clean, efficient and very easy to figure out! All of this and very inexpensive. Serves as an example to the res of the world."
,,Seriously no car needed in Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to use and absolutely clean and safe. Ticket machines are for totally idiots easy to use. Using every day, never wait longer than 3 minutes."
,,Very easy and very well connected.,5.0,,Almist every part of the singapore is connected with mrt. it's very easy and convenient. But it takes a long time to recharge the ticket as the machines are limited compared to the crowd.
,,Commuting is easy even for a first-time traveller.,5.0,,"If you're the kind of tourist that likes to experience how people go by on a day-to-day basis rather than taking the taxi, the SMRT is so convenient and user-friendly. Maps of the transit is available all around, and stops are placed conveniently near tourist spots and destinations. Signs are easy to follow, so getting lost among the busy crowd of natives is not a problem at all. I find it more convenient when you have a NETS card for cashless transactions. Just load it up and you are ready to go, plus it can be used in almost any public transport (except for taxis). Might I add, that you can load your card through 7-11 stores, but they charge you an additional SD$5.00. But you can also avail tickets with ease at any station."
,,Best system ever,5.0,,"We used the subway every day. Stations everywhere you need to go. Cheap, so clean, safe, fast and they even have people walking around to help passengers if need be. Easy to use and navigate. There is no eating or drinking and that's probably why it's so clean and orderly.
Highly recommended"
,,clean and cheap,5.0,,"So easy to use. Ticket machines idiot proof. Clean, reliable and cheap. Get everywhere with ease. Regular trains so little waiting time. Not too busy even rush hour."
,,Tourist pass is cheap way to see city,5.0,,"Good fixed price unlimited ticket for 24, 48 or 72 hours Only downside is limited places to buy and has to be consecutive days.. MRT is clean, reliable and felt safe Great driverless Technology"
,,Fast & Convenient,5.0,,"We travelled from Khatib Station to Little India Station. It took around 40 Mins. Smooth ride, Complete automated ticketing. The ticketing machine only accepts Cash for foreign tourists Or if you happen to buy EzLink Card."
,,Fast and Efficient,4.0,,"Very systematic, clean, and always on time! Plus the visual reminders are all over the train carriages and even at the waiting platforms."
,,"Efficient, Clean and a Great Way to Navigate Singapore",5.0,,"I mainly used the Downtown line between my hotel and all the sites I visited on this trip. The stations had lots of good signage and monitors making it easy to get to my train or exit from the station. The stations and trains were quite clean and people were polite both on the platform and in the train. The trains ran on time and I don’t recall seeing anyone making a dah for the closing doors which seemed unusual.

Fares were quite reasonable, around 1SGD and change depending on distance, but I bought the one day visitor pass for unlimited rides on the MRT, LRT and buses. It cost $20SGD which included a refundable $10SGD when I returned the card at the end. It was not sold in the ticket machines rather only at the ticketing offices. There also were 2 and 3 days passes along with senior rates."
,,most disciplined people,4.0,,the ez link card is very convinient and the mrt map was very easy to navigate. singaporeans are very disciplined and i did not feel scared to ride the mrt. a specially abled person can easily ride the mrt
,,Great way to get around and really good value,5.0,,"So easy to use and get around the city on the MRT. We bought an ez link card for $12 and that includes $7 of travel credit. So far we have taken 4 journeys, all under $1 each. Nice and clean stations and trains and the air conditioning was an added bonus. Station staff were very friendly too."
,,Clean and Fast,5.0,,Getting around Singapore on the MRT is easy even for the first time visitors. Get a tourist pass and an MRT map and if you get lost the locals people are very helpful and will give you directions. The MRT best way to get around. You can use the tourist pass on the bus system also.
,,"clean, fast and easy to negotiate",5.0,,Singapore should be very proud of this excellent facility. Get a little paper map from the ticket office or download the App - its easy to use and gets you pretty well everywhere you want to go.
,,"Safest, cleanest subway system I have ever used.",5.0,,"I have never used a subway system that was so safe and clean as the SMRT in Singapore. You don’t see tracks; just clean bright walls that protect you from any mishaps. You can’t possibly stumble onto the tracks or worse, be pushed onto the tracks that happens sometimes in the city I live.. There are people working and easily visible near the gateways to answer any questions. Normally when traveling I feel more comfortable using taxis and hop-on-hop-off busses to get around, but Singapore’s SMRT was so easy to use and more importantly SAFE, that we used it most of time to get to our destinations. And it saved us a lot money."
,,"A great, cheap way to get around",5.0,,"We bought the Singapore tourist pass, and it was so nice to hop on and off to see everything we wanted to see. Even easy to operate as a suburbanite who rarely uses public transportation."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Great for travelling and is cheap,clean, fast and easy to use. Keep the ticket and use to buy further journeys at lower fares."
,,"clean, fast and reliable",4.0,,"always on time, so clean and polite. rush hour is a little congested, but isnt that everywhere? people are considerate, the announcements are clear."
,,Very efficient and clean,5.0,,The cleanliness and efficiency is outstanding. Very good value for money and very helpful staff when you may get confused on first arrival.
,,Getting around singapore,5.0,,"For ease of use, value for money, punctuality, cleanliness and friendliness of staff the SMRT is unbeatable, the easiest way by far to explore Singapore"
,,"Efficient, clean, easy to use",4.0,,An excellent way to get around. Very easy to use - well signposted - easy to navigate. Clean. Safe. The machines to buy tickets are a bit annoying (and there can be queues for them) - but otherwise a great public transport system.
,,Affordable and Fastest Transpo in Singapore,5.0,,Stations are nearby on most tourist spots so it isn't a hassle to go back and fort. The stations and the MRT itself are clean. Most of my trips are within the 2 SGD budget which makes it affordable rather than taking the cab.
,,"Easy to use, cheap and clean",5.0,,"We planned to get a cab from the airport, but the MRT is so easy to use we just got on. It’s cheap - most journeys cost under $2 - clean, and easy to use.

The buses are also excellent - and often a quicker way than the MRT to get around."
,,"Easy to use, takes you everywhere - it's cheap, clean, safe and reliable",5.0,,"With typical Singaporean speed and efficiency, this is a fun and easy way to navigate around the entire island. Once you get your bearings and have an understanding of where this system can take you it really opens up the possibilities to see places you might otherwise miss. Take some time before you fly in to compare the rain lines to your hotspots and you'll save a lot of time and taxi money by using this awesome system. Be aware it is popular with the locals, too - so can be busy and cramped during peak business times. But there is no pushing and shoving, so don't let that put you off. And, as always, make sure you give up your seat to those who need it more."
,,"Easy, efficient & cheap way to get around Most areas of Singapore",5.0,,"Great efficient, clean, safe & cheap way to get around Singapore. If staying for more than a few days (we were in Singapore for a fortnight), purchase a Ezi-link card & top up as needed. Can purchase these at the Changi airport. Take a picture of the MRT map for reference to help with choosing the right line/train to use."
,,great and easy to use,5.0,,"We use the MRT extensively. You should get the tourist past if you are staying at least 3 days they'll it is very convenient and you can use it unlimited times they will refund you 10 singapore dolars when you return the card in any ticket station. You can take it at the airport, it is safe , clean, easy to use"
,,Easy and cheap,5.0,,We took this on our way back from Little India. We had walked all day were exhausted. Easy to use . we bought a24 hour card. Very clean and fast.
,,"Fast, clean, efficient.",5.0,,"The Singapore Metro, which was expanded rapidly the last 15 years is fast, clean, efficient and the tickets are priced reasonably. The Singapore Metro has now so many lines and transfer possibilities, that you can go almost everywhere in Singapore with the Metro. The Singapore Metro is a shining example for all other metro systems in the world."
,,Best I’ve ever used,5.0,,Spotlessly clean and cheap. Used many European and North American transit systems and no comparison. So safe too
,,Cheap and efficient!,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is fantastic. Compared to transport systems in other major cities is very reasonably priced and simple to use.
If you're there for a few days it's worth buying an ez link card that you can top up (a bit like the Octopus card in Hong Kong or the oyster card in London) and use to travel around.
But beware! Don't eat or drink on the MRT as there are pretty hefty fines if you are caught."
,,Great system,5.0,,"They really run a great system.
There is an app which gives you the whole map. You can easily figure out the correct stops and trains.
The vending machines are great. Even though we were new to Singapore, we could operate the machines easily.
People queue up very nicely. We are from India. In India people do not queue. They just huddle. Push and shove.
No pushing in Singapore. It was all orderly.
The staff at the counters were helpful. One lady came with me to the machine, got the tokens and then went back to her seat. Unimaginable in my country.
The stations were clean.
There were escalators everywhere. No probs.
It was a great experience."
,,Brilliant mode of transport,5.0,,"Really easy to use, staff really friendly & will assist with anything. Trains spotless all with air con & very safe. Each carriage tells you what direction you’re travelling, what station is next & what side the doors open at each station. All announcements in English. Very easy to use & best way to get around Singapore."
,,FIRST RATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM,5.0,,"During our cisit to Singapore we used the MRT extensively. It is very easy to use, clean, safe and above all very affordable. A great mode of transport"
,,World Class Public Transport,5.0,,I visit Singapore frequently Every time I experience smooth travel No kaos Timely service Speedy & Safe journey Other developing countries in the world Should learn
,,The best metro system in the world??,5.0,,"So easy to use - just buy the pre-charged oyster card equivalent (I think it was 12 dollars). It's easy to top up but you won't need to if you are doing short trips for a couple of days, it is so cheap. Then you just swipe in and out. The whole system is clean, fast, not overly crowded and a joy to use."
,,Efficient Clean Safe and easy to use,5.0,,"My partner and I recently used the Singapore MRT transport from Changi village to downtown, and return.
It was so easy and cheap to use. It was extremely efficient, clean, safe and easy to use.
We can thoroughly recommend it for singles, couples and families.
We would certainly use it again in the future."
,,Faultless,5.0,,"We used the MRT a couple of times. Once to get to and from Sentosa, and on another day to return from the zoo.

The first trip I had planned out but there was really no need to, the signage around the stations we used was very easy to navigate as were the ticket machines.

We bought single tickets loaded onto the paper card which you pay an initial $1 deposit for, but its worth keeping hold of as you then get the deposit back as a discount after so many journies using the same card (4th or 5th journey I think)."
,,To the future,5.0,,"You have to take this Metro system. Clean, air-conditioned and easy to get around, and rather extensive. The most interesting part is the unbelievable cleanliness and frequency of their Metros. You could probably eat off the floors of the stations or the subway floors, but you won't have time. They come every 3 - 5 minutes.

Cheap too. Get a card with some value on it instead of a single ride ticket. It costs so much less, like from $1.75 to $0.39 per trip if you get the value card. There are other options but I didn't try them."
,,Clean. Quiet. AMAZING,5.0,,"No trip to Singapore can be experienced without a few trips in the subway. It is so clean you could eat on floor (and get fined most likely for dirtying the floor). Kidding aside - no other suboin the world holds a candle to this. The design, ease (color coded), and efficiency was inspired."
,,great way to get around,5.0,,this has to be one of the best public transport systems in the world. frequent clean and cheap to use trains.
,,best tranportation,5.0,,"anywhere in Singapore, this is best transportation, fast, clean, in time schedule, effecient, very easy to refund my expied MRT card and get new card"
,,Too easy,4.0,,"Recommend buying the 3 day tourist pass for unlimited rides on train or bus for S$30 pp, with S$10 refunded when you return the pass. Clean, easy to navigate around the place."
,,What subways aspire to be,5.0,,"This is the way tubes were meant to be. Clean, efficient, and timely. Miss a train, and there will be another in just a couple of minutes. Also, there are many employees who are eager to help you out. Best of all, there is a feeling of safety here, and indeed, in all of Singapore. Definitely the cheapest way to travel."
,,A joy,5.0,,"Fast, clean, just wonderful. Very easy to use. We bought a 3 day Singapore Tourist pass for $30 unlimited use. Supposedly you can get $10 Back but not so easy. Not good hours at either Farrer Park or Changi. But still a great buy. Keep the pass as a souvenir"
,,"Efficient, convenient and good value",5.0,,"Staying just s few nights in Singapore, we bought three-day passes and made good use of them. Buses and MRT trains were clean, frequent and reliable. The routes were convenient for our needs, including our return to the airport (having taken a taxi into the city on arrival). We were able to collect the deposit refund easily when we arrived at Changi airport on our final evening. Elderly passengers (as well as those with disabilities) are prioritised for seats close to the train doors and this was widely respected and we were frequently offered seats. If only all public transport systems could be a good as Singapore's!"
,,Easy to use and clean,5.0,,"This is one of the best transit systems I've been on world wide. Clean, easy to navigate and lots of options. Figuring out the card was interesting but buying at the airport is a nice option."
,,Great Way to get Around Singapore,5.0,,"Such an easy way to sight see around Singapore. We opted for a $10 all day pass. There is a $10 deposit that is returnable. The stations are clean as are the trains. Once you grasp where you're going it gets so easy to find your way around. Even on the trains you'll find out if your going the wrong and again it's easy to rectify. It appears all so well organised. I was a bit nervous at first when i found out the trains were driverless, but overcame that very quickly. On all the escalators, everyone automatically stands on the left. Taxis are very cheap in Singapore but the train is a better and quicker way to get around.i just suggest give the MRT a go."
,,"Fast, efficient, cheap",5.0,,"Love Singapore’s MRT. Services are so frequent, there is no need for a timetable. Missed a train? No worries, there’ll be another in a few minutes.

The colour coded route maps are easy to follow, the trains are scrupulously clean, and station announcements are easily understood automated announcements in accentless English.

The service takes you almost everywhere in the island, both the more touristy bits like Orchard Road, Vivo City where you can get the cable car to Sentosa, Chinatown and also deep into the heartlands of government HDB flats where the majority of Singaporeans live.

Many stations, especially the larger interchange stations, have a shopping mall attached and it is always fun to hop off and explore and hop back on. Of course, where there are shops, there’s often a food court and restaurants as well!

Rather than buy single tickets, it’s easiest to get a reloadable stored value card and pay as you go by tapping in and out at the station gates. Tourist flat fare a day cards are good if you intend to travel A LOT in one day."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"A wonderful way to travel through Singapore. We purchased the three-day tourist pass and then added days. The SMRT is easy to navigate, incredibly clean, and air conditioned (Yay!). There are several apps to help you plan your journey."
,,Good,5.0,,The best transport if you want to go anywhere. Simple and very fast. Love it so much. Clean and comfortable
,,Best Public Transport,5.0,,I have been using Singapore Mass Rapid Transit for more than a year. Must say its extremely convenient for all age groups.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"An excellent way to get around Singapore. Fast, efficient, clean and safe. Buy a ticket from the machine and pay according to where you want to travel. Keep your ticket and add $ on to it as you travel around. Good maps and announcements in English"
,,A spotless subway!,5.0,,"A wonderful way to get around Singapore. The SMRT is easy to navigate, ticket machines have English language options, and buying tickets is easy. The communications system letting you know how soon a train will be arriving is excellent The trains are clean and relatively quiet"
,,Excellent way to move around in Singapur,5.0,,"This is a perfect way to move around Singapore, it looks like an airport terminal every single station, with AC in the stations and also inside the Trains, it is just a breeze to move from one place to another. If you are traveling too often it is worth it to get the card where you can charge more money and get better price per journey."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"The MRT was super clean, ran like clockwork and had helpful staff. We bought a 3 day pass which was great- paid by card so didn't have to worry about finding loose change all the time. I wish certain other transport organisations would take note how trains/underground ad Overground should be run."
,,So convenient and cheap,4.0,,"I have an ezy link card that I bought in 2010 when I came to SG. Used this same card on my next visit in 2014 but today (2019), got informed that my card has expired and the money inside is blocked somehow unless you renew your car for 3SGD so I renewed my card and got a balance of 52$ on it.
Got also an ezy link card for my 6years old daughter ( have to show passport to the ticket office though) and now, she can travel for free until her 7th birthday but her card ia valid only until next April 2019. Never mins as we are only staying for 4 days."
,,Easy and efficient,5.0,,The most easy way to get around Singapore. Opt for the pass if you are visiting. Easy to follow instructions. Just follow the signs and you will not be lost. Efficient and on time . Trains being present every 2-5 minutes.
,,Best rapid transit system.,5.0,,"It is the best transit system that we have seen.

Clean subway cars and stations with up to date information via signs, videos, etc. both in the stations and on the cars. And there is literally a world of shopping, eating and banking services underground in and around subway stations. Great integration to the other parts of the system such as buses plying on the streets. Multiple exits from the stations minimize needs for pedestrians to cross surface roads. It seems like one is only a few feet away from the transit system no matter where one is in the city and at Changi airport. As a result the car traffic on the streets seems to move reasonably well. The whole thing makes it possible for even tourists to very quickly get comfortable with using public transit."
,,Easy cheap travel.,5.0,,"Definately use the train system in Singapore. Easy to use ,cheap and easy access to train stations everywhere. When you catch the train from the airport you must have small notes of money to use the ticket machines. No credit card access.
The visitors travel card is a must. &10 each for 3 days unlimited travel. When you leave you can cash your travel card in at selected train stations to get your $10 back.
Fast driverless trains were approx every 3 mins so you never wait long."
,,Really easy airport connection,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to get to and from the airport with very easy changes between the different lines--usually just a walk across the platform. Trains are frequent and the tickets inexpensive at just S$2.50 one-way to/from Orchard Road, for example. Luggage is no problem since there are escalators and lifts at the stations."
,,Best Way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"This SMRT is the best for you who want to travel to Singapore with a low budget. They put sign everywhere so you will not get lost. Simple to use, clean, and well organized. They also provide lift for pregnant mom and people with disability"
,,CHEAP TOURS??,5.0,,"One thing my wife and I did was get off at a different station each night and explore the neighborhood and various sights. It's a lot cheaper than a guided bus tour.

The subways are clean, easy to negotiate and the workers are kind and professional."
,,Brilliant.... no other word for it,5.0,,"We purchased a 3 day pass for $20, with s refundable $10 deposit on top. This can be used on the underground trains and buses which are literally every 5 minutes and a fantastic way to get round Singapore"
,,Cleanest and smoothest Subway(SMRT),5.0,,The SMRT is the best way to travel as it is so inexpensive. You have to study where you are going but so easy to get around. Singapore has the best MRT and we have been to many. I would use this transport system every time I visit.
,,the way to go ... everywhere,5.0,,"Singapore MRT -you may call it Metro, or Tube, or Train in your hometown- is the MOST efficient way to move around the Smart-City /Smart Nation. It reaches everywhere! from the Airport, to business, educational, entertainment, commercial districts, fast and very cost effective (you may say cheap - The fare depends on the distance and numebr of stations traveled- . Definitelly my preferred way."
,,"Easy, cheap and quick",5.0,,Use of Ezcard makes the travelling so easy. MRT comes mostly every 5 minutes and they are so clean and easy to use. Guides for locations on the walls makes easy to find your way. We even travelled from and to airport and hotel with lot of luggage without any problems.
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit. The best i have ever been on.,5.0,,"During our stay in Singapore we immediately purchased a Three Day Tourist Pass.
It cost Thirty dollars for three days and you receive a ten dollar refund when you return the card. It gives you UNLIMITED TRAVEL ON BUSES AND TRAINS FOR THREE DAYS.
The Trains and busses are fantastic.
We used both to travel to many locations including the Bird Zoo and the Singapore Zoo.
At every station there is personnel who will tell tourists which trains to catch to any location. From the business district the train took little time to get us to the bus to go to the Bird zoo. The train staff are always willing to answer your questions and bus drivers do the same. The personnel are very polite in dealing with questions.
If you want to save money in Singapore this mode of transport is thoroughly recommended.
We were amazed at just how efficient and speedy their transport system is.
Trains and buses run regularly and are well sinned in English for tourists.
Puts ours in Australian systems to shame.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
,,Got a little lost at first but very cheap to get around,4.0,,"Used the MRT over a couple of days, and although we got a little lost at first we mastered it 8n the end. Very clean, safe and comfortable to travel around Singapore."
,,Good Public Transport System,5.0,,An overall great MRT system. It was also easy to top up the cards and the customer service is great. The person in the counter willingly helped us on our first top up experience. I do wish they had more chairs in the waiting area but nonetheless...efficient and convenient.
,,Works efficiently,4.0,,"Singapore SMRT is very safe and easy way to move around the city. All transportations have aircon (I believe) and even the subway stations are airconned. Busses also have free WiFi which I use at the moment to write this review.

TOURISTS NOTE: if you buy the 1-3 day tourist pass, what I noticed that the 3 day pass is not valid for 72hours, its valid for three days from the day you buy it. If you buy it late in the evening you have already “lost” that day. That’s what happened to me. So just to let you know it. The three day pass costs 30S$ and it has 10S$ deposit which you’ll get back when you return the card.

I used a lot of the subway and local buss 123 to Sentosa island."
,,"Excellent , efficient , clean and safe",5.0,,"The MRT is an excellent, efficient, clean and safe way of travelling around the island.
We bought an EZ card for $12 SGD and you get $7 credit , thus costing you $5 SGD as we were staying a few days so better than the tourist card .
It is also very easy to top up your card as well .

Individual fares are so cheap - it cost us 0.93 for 2 stops from Orchard Rd.
We travelled from Orchard station to Changi airport for $1.83 ! So cheap !!

The stations are clean and signs are in English . The carriages are clean as no food and drink are allowed to be consumed on board.
There is signage of the route on board and which station it is travelling to as well as an indicator to say which side to alight from.

Overall, a very convenient, efficient and cheap mode of transport to travel around the island."
,,Great way to get around Singapore,4.0,,It was really cheap and efficient. Great connections and helpful staff at stations. Would recommend it.
,,Great transportation system,5.0,,"Singapore's public transportation facilities are super. The MRT (subway) is very convenient -- especially if you can ride at non-rush-hour times, when it can get very crowded.
At many of the stations you can purchase a rechargeable MRT/bus pass, so you don't have to buy a ticket every time you ride one or the other. (There is an initial $7 nonrefundable cost for the pass)
Through the years, more and more MRT stations have been added in those areas farther from the city center. Where there is no MRT, there is usually bus service within easy walking distance.
The MRT seats are surprisingly comfortable for non-padded seats. The air conditioning works very well (sometimes I've even wished for a sweater). Smoking , eating and drinking are not allowed on the MRT or in the stations, so they stay very clean and nice.
Each station has maps which clearly show every stop for each direction, as well as a map of the entire MRT system so you can easily see where you may need to transfer.
Generally you can find a bus stop quite near the MRT entrance in case you need to transfer. The bus stops have good signs indicating which bus goes to which streets, adding to the convenience of the Singapore public transportation facilities."
,,Efficiency at its finest,5.0,,"One of the reasons we continue returning to Singapore as a platform to travel around Asia is there incredibly easy to use SMRT system. Honestly can not be happier or find it more reliable. Whether it be getting from the airport to your hotel, there’s always maps around to help you choose the best exit. Plenty of signage. Just user friendly!"
,,Excellent travel option,5.0,,If you been on the London underground forget that experience when using the Singapore system it's clean safe and a cost efficent way to get around the city
,,Super clean and efficient,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is super clean and efficient. Train passes are easy to get and top off. For EZ link passes if it is not all used, can turn in to get the balance refunded. Many routes available to all the popular destinations."
,,"Cheap, Convenient and connecting most of the places",5.0,,"Singapore MRT, one of the best METRO connecting most points of cities. Fare is cheap starting from $.80 to $2.3. Will recommend to get Ez-link card if you are travel period is more then 2 days. Although EZ-Link card cost $5 non-refundable."
,,a great way to get around,5.0,,"SMRT was quick, clean and easy to use. Can't think of an easier or cheaper way to get around town. We bought tourist passes for 2 days and just used them to get wherever we wanted to go."
,,Surprising experience and incredibly spic-and-span 😲!,5.0,,"What a surprising experience each time we took this perfectly organized transport system! Users are extremely respectful, everything runs smoothly without any stress. All the places are incredibly clean as if there’s no traffic of people, although it’s crowded, but you don’t feel the crowd ! Also extremely secured."
,,Easy to move from place to place,5.0,,Fantastic in that you can easily understand what line you should take to get to the point you are to visit.
,,Very efficient way to travel,5.0,,"We used the subway nearly exclusively to get around Singapore. A great way to travel. We purchased an Ez link card, much cheaper way to go than the Tourist Pass. We downloaded the the app to find the nearest station to where we wanted to go, and had virtually no problems. We did have a small problem topping up the EZ link but a local quickly sorted that out for us.

The subways are very clean, and sometimes you may need to walk along way to get to the nearest exit to where you want to be, but they are air conditioned so nicer than walking outside in the heat. A fantastic way to get around."
,,Very functional,5.0,,We bought a tourist pass and it seemed super good. One could easily find around and the pass also worked for bus
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"I used the SMRT for most of me and my family travel during our vacation, the prices are very cheap compared to a taxi.

Some areas are not close to the SMRT like to zoo and bird park and you will need to change trains and take the bus in these cases the trip becomes very long and tiring . But for general day to day travel it is an excellent mode of transport and offer a lot including shopping."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Trains are long and much wider than UK tube trains so hold lots of people. Network is easy to get your head round, cheap to use and the EZ-Link card the best way to pay; buy a card at any of the stations and top up with card or cash. One 5 stop journey across the city was S$0.83 so you won’t break the bank!"
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Bought a 2 day Singapore Tourist Pass for 26sgd which includes a 10sgd deposit. This gave me unlimited travel on the MRT and buses. The MRT is so easy and quick to get to anywhere you wast to go, particularly the top sites. It's the only way to get about in Singapore"
,,Very efficient and comfortable mass transit system,5.0,,The trains were frequent and clean. Signs always let you know how long the wait for the next train is. Maps are always available for the system and the area around the stop you are at.
,,So efficient,5.0,,"The easiest way to get around, the train comes every 4 mins, is super clean,organized and orderly! Really well air conditioner inside and great signage, you can’t get lost!"
,,Convenient,4.0,,"Good to travel across Singapore ! But it seems to be less efficient than similar MTRs elsewhere , like in Dubai , or Hong Kong , due to a lower frequency of the trains : you sometimes have to wait quite a while for the next train ..."
,,efficient transport,5.0,,"as always I use the mRT for my movement in Singapore, cheap and fast , secure and safe , clean and comfort ; nothing else you can expect"
,,Easy to use/well marked,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, safe,and well marked. Plenty of maps at exits. We purchased three day pass. There will be signs telling you what exit to use for particular areas. Best way to get around in hot / humid Singapore. Everything in English."
,,Singapore mrt,5.0,,Clean trains. Which leave on time and don't cost much. Tickets machines easy to operate. Overal a very pleasent experience which seem odd when talking about an undergound
,,Best connectivity service I have seen,5.0,,"SMRT is the best service a country can provide to their citizens. Amazing connectivity, cleanliness, on time service you can depend upon. One should only travel by Singapore's public transport."
,,Good way to get around,5.0,,It is very easy to use and it goes all over town. It is clean and safe. I like that everyone can feel safe in it. Please note that there are strict rules in Singapore to follow which are enforced. No food on metro.
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"Can’t say much more.....Like everything in Singapore it’s clean & tidy, well signposted, fully air conditioned and very efficient"
,,"Quick, clean and efficient",5.0,,A quick and efficient way to travel around singapore. Staff are very helpful and it's easy to figure out where you want to go and how to get there.
,,The best public transport system in the World,5.0,,"Clean, fast, safe, well sign posted and cheap. If you need to quickly get around Singapore do the MRT, but you won’t see the sights. Take a taxi for the view, but pay a price, get the MRT and walk or finish with a taxi, best of both worlds"
,,Clean & Efficient,5.0,,"Used the SMRT to get from the Changi Airport to the cruise ship terminal (Marina Bay South). It was easy to navigate the system, which included a couple of transfers. The automated ticket machines were also easy to use. Also purchased the one day tourist pass, which could only be purchased at specific stations and required a deposit, but was well worth it. The trains and stations are very clean, and the system is very efficient."
,,On time,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, cheap and on time.
Plenty of trains so barely any waiting times. Clearly marked out maps all color coded and in English.
Stations all air conditioned and most city stops connected to a mall of some sort.
best way to get around for sure"
,,Moving around Singapore,4.0,,If you are going to stay more than three days in Singapore I recommend buying a MRT pass. It will cost you 12 Sing and you will get a 7 Sing balance. It is easy to navigate specially if you use google map.
,,Some thinking and planning helps,3.0,,"The Singapore mtr system has been around for some time. Understandably, certain parts of the system are getting old and in need of renewal or better and proper maintenance; hence, the breakdowns of service from time to time. Generally, it’s still quite a relatively efficient, low cost and environment-friendly alternative to vehicles and buses. One of the caveats about the system is that it takes some good thinking and planning if one wished to save time and reach a destination in good time."
,,Good way to get around,4.0,,"The system passes close to most places you'll want to visit, is easy to navigate and mostly uncrowded. Trains not as frequent as in Hong Kong but still OK. The ticketing system is a bit cumbersome, not really designed for visitors. If you're staying any time, or likely to visit again, get an EZ-Link card so you don't have to queue for tickets. Why on earth can't you just tap a credit card, though?"
,,Reliable & caring MRT of Singapore,5.0,,"My wife & I travel by Singapore MRT very frequently. I find that the rides are very inexpensive, speedy, comfortable & reliable.
I m also very impressed by its passengers who are very courteous n caring. They also give up their seats for elderly people like my wife n me.
Bye!"
,,Very Clean and Not Crowded,4.0,,"MRT Trains in Singapore are clean and convenient to go around the city and to most of the tourist attractions, such as, Marina Bay Sands, Little India, China Town, City Hall, Raffles City, Harbor Bay Front and Suntec Shopping Center. You need Singapore dollars to buy tickets/cards at the automated kiosks. The automated kiosks is very user friendly and there is option to look for the station by name or by checking the route map. You have to use the card to enter and exit the station. For trip tickets, you have options to buy one way or round trip. If you exit on the station that it was not on the ticket, you may have to pay additional to be able to exit the station."
,,clean,4.0,,make sure you follow the rules! no food/drink!! the bag checks are a little much.... they target anyone who looks like a traveler
,,Outstanding system,5.0,,"This is, without doubt, the best underground rail system in the world.
Easy to navigate, spotlessly clean, on time and cheap when you get a tourist pass.
I'm a senior and was amazed at the number of times I was offered a seat by young and middle aged people."
,,It is so easy to get around Singapore,5.0,,Very clear maps with site maps of where you are before you leave the station and found staff only too willing to help anyone looking lost. It has been a pleasure travelling on the MRT in the air conditioned stations and trains. Even at rush hour everyone is patient and respectful and being a senior citizen was usually offered a seat
,,Excellent transportation System,5.0,,Excellent Mass rapid Transportation System in Singapore. Easy navigation in the stations. Clean and good customer service by the attendants.
,,we Need them,4.0,,"Periodic hiccup of the trains but nonetheless, one of the better systems in the world still. Singaporeans just love to complain...."
,,FAST And CLEAN..unlike NYC!,5.0,,"Wow we purchased the toursit day passes and enjoyed four days of train and bus rides all over town. The maps are easy to read and follow. The train even has a LED sign with the stops visited and those to be the next stops. Wheelchairs can easily get to the lower levels via elevators and those needing to readily travel , the moveable escalator is available. Steps for those counting are always an option."
,,Smooth travel in metro in Singapore,4.0,,"The MRT, as it is called, was quite efficient and covers all of Singapore thru its network. At first the maze may be difficult to understand but once u figure out the different coloured lines and stations thereon, it becomes very easy to navigate. The tourist pass is good and works on buses also. Only drawback of MRT is that u miss seeing the city as it moves underground."
,,A very efficient pulblic train system,5.0,,"Travelled on the train many times with cross connections and is a quick and effective means to travel and ticketing is relatively simple for tourists to use. Is well maintained as you would expect in Singapore. Do not have to be going in a single direction, so many cross connections."
,,Easy way to explore singapore,4.0,,Top choice for transportation in singapore! We love to explore the city using MRT. Very clean and tidy. They reached almost every corner of Singapore.

,,SMRT Singapore,5.0,,"Travelled today on SMRT,such good value,clean,air con,efficient will be definately travel again on this network."
,,Super cold train and impossible to buy 3 day pass at the airport in the morning,3.0,,Very well organized and clea public transport. But I minded that it was super cold in a train and impossible to buy 3 day pass at the airport in the morning before 8 AM. Also you need to pay 5 dollars for a card that you could recharge just because you have it.
,,Great economic way to get aro7nd,5.0,,Excellent transport system that makes travelling around Singapore easy and relatively cheap. Oyster style card makes buying tickets and paying for journeys straight forward. This card can also be used on local buses.

,,about as good as public transit can get!,5.0,,"Other than somewhat confusing ticketing at the kiosks (why oh why can the attendants not help out the uninitiated?), the system is a marvel. Goes everywhere, is cheap, efficient fast, clean, well signed. A model for the rest of the world."
,,Affordable and Convenient,5.0,,"MRT is one of two convenient way to get around in Singapore. Why only two? because i just consider MRT and bus as public transportation. Taxi is others xD But MRT in Singapore is great, has accurate departure time, cheap, and easy."
,,"Faster, cleaner and cheaper.",5.0,,"Singapore is mostly connected by MRT. There are new lines coming up though. If you wa t to be on time MRT is the best option. There is no train delay here. Ofcoz there are minor incidents once in a while.
Try to avoid office hours. It will be packed full. Although the frequency will be more. You can find all classes of people. Eating n drinking is strictly prohibited. The stations and trains are super clean. It is an experience you won’t want to miss."
,,"Fast, efficient and affordable way to get around Singapore.",5.0,,"Without any idea or advice on how to get around Singapore, I was able to figure out my way around the city. The trains are fast and more important - air conditioned!"
,,Tecnologia..??!! 10 passi avanti a noi!!! Technology..??!! 10 steps ahead of us !!!,5.0,,"Siamo stati in giornata a Singapore da Kuala Lumpur..
Abbiamo ""studiato"" e programmato la nostra giornata in modo tale da riuscire a vedere più cose possibili..
Avevamo già letto le recensioni super positive di questo mezzo di trasporto..e non possiamo che confermare tutto..
La metro è pulita, puntuale, super efficiente insomma in poche parole possono considerarla un fiore all'occhiello di questa città super moderna..
Abbiamo fatto il Tourist pass 1 day (disponibile anche per più di un giorno) al costo di 20 dollari di singapore a persona.., poi quando la restituite vi verranno restituiti 10 dollari (usati come deposito)..
Mezzo di trasporto super consigliato!!!

We were in Singapore in the day from Kuala Lumpur ..
We have ""studied"" and planned our day in such a way as to be able to see as many things as possible ..
We had already read the super positive reviews of this means of transport..and we can not confirm everything ..
The metro is clean, punctual, super efficient, in short, in a few words can consider it a flagship of this super modern city ..
We did the Tourist pass 1 day (also available for more than one day) at a cost of 20 dollars in Singapore per person .., then when you return it you will be returned $ 10 (used as a deposit) ..
Super transport means recommended !!!"
,,Quick and easy,5.0,,The MRT is the easiest way to get around Singapore. It is very easy to navigate and extremely cheap.
,,Easy to use and cheap,5.0,,"MRT is incredibly efficient, clean, user friendly. Give it a go... if we were at all unsure there was always someone available to ask for information."
,,Awesome connectivity,5.0,,The system connects the entire city very well. The frequency and price both are pretty good. Highly recommended.
,,Clean and comfortable travel,5.0,,The trains and stations were immaculately clean - np litter anywhere. The travellers were polite and nobody pushed or shoved to get on or leave the trains. It seems that in Singapore everyone is considerate of their fellow residents.
,,Easy Commuting,5.0,,"With networks of inter connected train ways, commuting has never been this easy compare to other. Hassles might only be on the part were you can encounter inconsiderate, racist and rude passengers."
,,Nice transit,4.0,,"Only used it twice - easy to purchace tickets (which is not the case in most metros), nice, clean, safe"
,,Uninterrupted Travelling,4.0,,May not be perfect but the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) is certainly convenient and easy for visitors to travel around the major locations of the city and places of interest in Singapore at a very affordable cost.
,,Great way to get around.,5.0,,The MRT is clean fast and really efficient. Very safe. A great way to get to all the the sights. Easy to use. Would recommend buying a card.
,,It just can't get better than this,5.0,,"The MRT is one of the best public systems in the world. It is clean (no eating or drinking allowed on the trains), efficient and very economical. It extends from the airport into almost the whole of Singapore. The EZlink card costs $12 and has a stored value of $7. Top ups in multiples of $10 and can be used on both MRT and public buses, with the inter transport fee being just 10 cents at times if the change is within 40 minutes. Eg changing from the MRT to a public bus to save some walking time to beat the rain / heat only costs 10 cents more. Signs in English and not crowded even during peak hours. Tip: remember to tap when going in and going out for both buses and MRT, else charged the whole length of the trip the vehicle is doing!"
,,"simple, modern and efficient",4.0,,the quality of the trains is excellent. the system is easy to understand and signage is clear. The purchasing of tickets is not clear and the machines are not user friendly- go and speak to aperson at the ticket booth to find out what to do and how to pay!
,,Public transport as it should be,5.0,,"Fast, efficient, frequent, spotlessly clean and extensive coverage over its 6 lines: Singapore's MRT really has it all. The UK could learn a lot from it.

We giggled at the No Durians sign on the Downtown line, but totally understood it when we saw - and smelled - durians.

We bought a 3-day pass which covered the MRT and buses, and it was worth every cent. Each pass cost $30 and when we returned them we received $10 each back. Even without the passes, tickets were cheap and easy to buy."
,,Efficient and clean.,5.0,,"Had travelled in Many MRT system in europe and other asian countries but Singapore MRT is one of the best managed system. It is clean and station platforms had constantly being improved to provide safety to commuters. Most stations have a shopping centre outside where you can get any to eat when you are out. there us very good public bus connectivity at each station. There are elevators in most stations or lifts to the inconvenient people.

Not allowed to drink or eat in the train is good most people are observing the regulations well.

People are more well mannered to allow elderly to sit at dessinated seats. Not really crowded after office hours. Good linkages to any where in the whole of singapore."
,,Very Clean and Efficient,5.0,,Its services lived up to renowned Singapore reputations for being clean and efficient. Passengers are mostly well mannered.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Cheap, fast, clean and efficient. The best way to move about Singapore. The train can take you to little India, Chinatown or the Bay Area. Easy to use and cheap as chips"
,,Payment method confusing and slow for a tourist,3.0,,"The first time I tried to take this I decided looking around for a taxi would be faster.
The second time it must have taken me at least 15 minutes to buy a ticket.
In most other cities you can either buy a ticket via credit card, or there is an obvious ATM and place to exchange for small bills in the station. And if you get confused you can go to the customer service counter and buy your ticket there.
In Singapore there appears to be a different counter or machine for most purposes, so you have to choose between purchasing a pass or buying a one-off ticket with smaller bills than you have on you right after you arrive. This is compounded by your standing in line behind other confused tourists who don't have the right change.

So long story short... take a Grab, or bring bills 5 SGD or less with you to the station.

Once you're through the payment gate the train is super convenient and easy, like in Hong Kong or Taipei."
,,Very good,5.0,,"I liked, good to travel around Singapore easy very clean fast and cheap all around the you find estastion even to sentosa Island all the fun when you finish take mrt to your hotel all stations very close"
,,"Fast, frequent, cheap and clean",5.0,,"If you are lucky enough to come to Singapore plan to use the MRT, a realy good way to travel, if you don't have a lot of luggage (if you fo take a taxi). So quick, easy and value for money. We chose not to get a tourist visa, just added money to our ticket, it is good for 6 journeys."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Got the 3 day pass with unlimited travel and used it loads! You also get $10 back when returning afterwards.
,,Love my MRT,5.0,,The best transport system. Love it. It is well designed Clean. Efficient. We are proud of it. Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
,,Hardly a 'thing to do' attraction,4.0,,It's a modern transit system with reasonable priced fares. Some passengers seemed to struggle with the transit map on how to get from A to B because you often need to change trains. Appreciated younger passengers automatically stood up for their elders irrespective of people like me more than happy to stand. We bought our tickets from the cruise terminal Harborfront station. Mega number of passengers were queueing for the one day tourist pass but for us it was cheaper and quicker to buy one return and one single ticket for our 3 journeys
,,Transport system getting better,4.0,,Transport system is getting better by the days. Thanks to efforts by the technicians and support team.
,,Convenient way to travel,5.0,,Most of tourist spots have nearby MRT station and very affordable and time saving way to travel in the country
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Convenient, cheap and easy to use. Get a card and download money as you go. Fast and clean service and efficient. Thoroughly recommend."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"If your a tourist, when you arrive in Singapore, buy the Hi Tourist SIM card from Singtel which has the card that you can use as EZ-Link pass for travel on the MRT. Costs S$18 for 7 days, and also gives you S$3 of credit for the train system (easy to top up at MRT stations with machines that take cash and cards). This is enough to get you from Changi airport to the centre of the city, which only costs S$1.78 with the card. SIM comes loaded with 100Gb of super-fast data, 500mins of calls, and 100 texts. Best value by a long way and available at the airport when you arrive or from any 7-11 store (and probably other places as well)"
,,Good transport,5.0,,"Easy to use transport system, ticket instructions in English with helpful staff.Trains clean comfortable and quick."
,,Easy way to get around,4.0,,"We purchased the prepaid cards which work in the same way as an Oyster card in London. It is an easy system to use and gets you around quickly, efficiently and cleanly. Station staff are quick to offer help if you need it."
,,Smart way to travel,5.0,,"We went everywhere using the MRT, choose a hotel close to a station and then you are set. The system is easy, clean and safe. If you’re in Singapore for a few days to a week it’s worth getting a top up card. Kids under a certain height are free, you will need their passport number to register for a card."
,,Very nice,5.0,,One of the fastest and well planned transport system. For travellers staying more than 6 or 7 days. Ezlink card is best. 5 $ non refundable fees but then they can use it in MRT and bus as well as conveyance stores too. Much easy to understand and many staff people also help to understand about routes and lines.
,,Brilliant system,5.0,,"We have been using this since the day we arrived in Singapore. This is the best way to get around. It is so easy to use and very efficient, very little waiting time between trains. I would suggest you buy a Tourist ticket on arrival at the airport. Staff are helpful too"

,,EFFICIENT PLUS REASONABLE FARE TRANSPORT SYSTEM (SMRT),5.0,,"My first experience and I love it, smooth, comfortable journey & convenient, will drive less. Really smooth & efficient platform plus good infrastructure planning including prominent visual signs showing routes and directions connecting with bus routes throughout Singapore island, making it very easy and convenience to understand for end users whether locals or foreigners to travel fast, smooth and safe within the island. Am sure all foreigners wil love it and use it, so easy, smooth, safe, good price and discover more of the island."
,,World's Best,5.0,,"During a six day stay in Singapore, I never used a taxi even once thereby saving hundreds of dollars. Thanks for SMRT, I was pleasantly whisk from place-to-place by following easy network maps and purchasing a six-day card at Changi International Airport. The cost of six days of travel in Singapore was about $18. There is no country that does better urban planning that Singapore and the SMRT is just one prominent example."
,,MRT,5.0,,Exceedingly Convenient. Frequent trains and heading to every desirable area of the city. Great way to get around the city.
,,Synchronized and Brilliant,5.0,,"You have done it. Impressed with the standards achieved.

Recommend that adverts and notices that are outdated to be removed. See announcement that are valid for 2018 in train cabins

Also, consider the high decibel sound that comes through when train exits the underground after Lavendar station going towards Kallang station.

Finally, was in cabin 1122 yesterday afternoon. A sharp continuous whistling sound seem to be coming from the aircon vents."
,,DAILY TRAVELLER,4.0,,"Sinagpore MRT is my day to day transport system. I admire who ever planned and whoever maintained this transpprt system for their great job.

Its clean.
Waiting time for next train is also fast.

,,Efficient,5.0,,"Fast, efficient and inexpensive. Great service! A great way to get around the island. Good connections to bus interchange services."
,,"Excellent system, easy to use",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a credit to the Island nation.

It’s super clean, signs & maps are easily understood and at peak times, there are assistants in the stations directing and assisting people.

We found it best value to purchase the standard card, not the Tourist Card. If you are in Singapore for a few days, that would be the best option.

Some of the underground stations are quite large, so it pays to check which exit you want to use, to avoid popping up to ground level several hundred meters from where you want to be, on the wrong side of a busy road! Again, the signs have all of the information that you want.

Some of the interchange stations require a long walk, but there’s no avoiding that.

Excellent, value for money system."
,,Excellent way to get around the city,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is so easy to use - quick, efficient, clean and on time. It is a great way to get from Changi Airport into the city provided you don't have a lot of heavy bags and your hotel is fairly close to one of the stations. For a stay of a couple of days I would recommend getting a travel card (S$5 non-refundable purchase fee) which you can then top up at any station. It allows you to travel on both trains and buses - just tap on and off at the start and end of your journey."
,,Best anywhere!,5.0,,Cleanest mass transit system on the planet! Truly efficient and inexpensive. Very easy to use throughout the city.
,,Clean & efficient,4.0,,"It gives easy access to most places. Clean and efficient. Closes around 12 am. However, there is quite a lot of walking between stops . Easy to use with clear directions"
,,Fantastic system,5.0,,"If only Australia could take note of how a public transport system should work. Congrats Singapore, a great system, easy to use, especially for travellers new to the country, fast, reliabke, clean, easy and extremely affordable, great job."
,,Reasonably fast and reliable,5.0,,"Hi All,
Singapore’s SMRT is an earth friendly transport system used by thousands daily. We may have larger expectations but SMRT in its present form is a great transportation system. It is safe, reliable and reasonably quick to travel to your local destinations. Needless to mention the economy of it in an expensive City like Singapore.
It’s reasonably comfortable for family with kids as I am quite sure someone will get up from his/her seat for your kids and elderly.
SMRT staff too are always welcoming to help. I don’t drive in Singapore, I can easily afford, but transport like SMRT makes my and my kids daily commute so convenient that we don’t want to drive. It is our contribution to a greener earth. We won’t be doing it if SMRT or SBS were not around.
So if you come to Singapore for a visit buy an SMRT card and use it for local transport. Buying a ticket each time is much more expensive.
You will experience and enjoy the multicultural Singapore in public transportation. You will also see the fashion trends of office goers if you happen to travel during office hours. But avoid peak times if you are accompanied by children. Though it’s absolutely fine but will find that trains are a bit crowded.

,,MRT - Most populous form of transport in Singapore,3.0,,"The MRT is a convenient and cheapest form of public transport in Singapore. It is fairly efficient but very crowded at peak hours. Please avoid the timings of 7am-10am on weekday mornings and 4pm - 8pm on weekday evenings. Sometimes it gets crowded from 9.30pm to 11pm due to the retail employees going back after work. Like all public train / subway services worldwide, please plan your route before so that there will be minimal time wasted getting lost or getting off at the wrong station."
,,Singapore Mrt,5.0,,"This network is really easy to use and travel is very convenient one can get a two day or three day travel pass which may be used on the buses or trains and is a cheap way to travel around Singapore to visit many of the places of interest, when you leave Singapore you hand your ticket at the train station at the airport and receive $10.00 Singapore back. you can also keep topping up your rail pass. You just proceed to one of the stations hand in your ticket and they replace it with another one."
,,In Singapore you only need SMRT pass to visit any place. Best way to travel Singapore.,5.0,,"SMRT takes you to any place in Spore... literally any. Of course provided you can walk a little.
Depending on your stay, you can take 1 day / 2 days / 3 days / 5 days pass. They are extremely affordable; gives you great flexibility & can be purchased right from Airport.
Even if you a new traveler, you can easily use SMRT. It gives you access to all Metros & Buses. With the combination of these two you can reach anywhere in Spore.
We had purchased a 3 day pass at SGD 20 (i think) & really enjoyed it. There is a deposit for the smart card for SMRT that can be returned even at the airport SMRT station & money refunded.

My advise (pls use your judgement based on your situation) - to visit Spore, you don't need any travel agent. Book flight tickets online, get your visa done, book a good hotel online for best price, buy SMRT to see Spore. As simple as that.

Have a great vacation in this beautiful country."

,,The ONLY Way to Get Around the City,5.0,,"We were able to purchase a 3 day pass for the Public Bus or the Subway, with a $10.00 refund for each ticket at the end of the 3 days. We used it mostly for getting around on the Subway. Very easy directions with color coding to find the next station/stop. We did use the bus once, during the evening. It took longer to wait for the bus though. The schedule was posted per bus number and we were able to tell when our bus would be coming. There are seats to wait for the bus, still a quicker ride with the subway. Also, the subway has escalators for every stop which is very nice if you have luggage. Japan was not as equipped and we had to haul our luggage up many, many steps at certain times after using their subway."
,,An excellent and cheap way to easily get to most tourist attractions.,5.0,,"No eating or drinking allowed, thankfully, on these very clean trains.
Very frequent and generally coordinated to allow for smooth transfers to other lines and buses

Prices are reasonably cheap and gets you everywhere from north to south to east to west. One of the best transportation system, just like Japan's."
,,Could Not be Easier,5.0,,"First, Singapore is small, so the transit is small. Very negotiable. Easy to understand.

It took me a bit to figure out the automated ticketing but there is always someone you can ask.

And like all of Singapore the subway system is very clean.

Unlike say London, NYC, Paris, Singaporeans on a subway are quiet. Very quiet. I think it is all about social graces, the common good and cultural awareness. VERY pleasant experience.

The subway and bus system is also the most inexpensive way to navigate Singapore. Where the subway stops there are buses to take you to the further outskirts of the city."
,,"Clean, clearly labelled and friendly staff and passengers",5.0,,"3 languages in PA, English, Malay and Indian, Chinese names can be seen almost everywhere. Staff very helpful, passengers as well, I asked so many people and they were all very friendly."

Buy it directly at the subway station and you will pay less: 1 day = 10 SGD / 2 days = 16 SGD / 3 days = 20 SGD plus 10 SGD for the card which will be refunded. Metro is extremely clean and safe. Without any doubt recommendable!"

,,Highly efficient and very clean,5.0,,It is (IMHO) one of the best metros in the world- easy to use and cost effective - If you are in Singapore for more that a day its worthwhile getting the 'Tourist' day pass- once you are done just hand it back and you get a S$10 refund
,,"Singapore MRT is Efficient, Clean and Good Value",5.0,,"Very easy to use transport system that feel safe and is well maintained. The trains were efficient, clean and frequent. Good alternative to on surface transport."
,,Best Train system I've seen,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is just brilliant - It's a fast, efficient service, with regular trains (every 2-4 mins on most lines), several interchange station options to help switch lines and all at a low cost. Fares generally range between $0.80 and $1.40 per trip. Only drawback is that it seems most people in town recognise that MRT IS the best way to get around, so you'll find yourself having to stand most of time, although there is regular respect given by commuters to the elderly, disabled and expectant mothers."
,,'Public' transport management profit driven,3.0,,i had travelled a fair bit. You get local news patting their own back. The best is still HK MTR if they are to compare apple with apple. Mind you MTR is even older.

,,A reliable mode of transportation,5.0,,"I stayed in Singapore for a week, and was able to get around quickly with their MRT.

,,Great transport system,5.0,,A great way for tourists to get around Singapore easily. Although can be very crowded at times and a bit annoying having to top up card on a machine rather than with a customer service person

The staff were helpful and cheerful."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"It's world class. We have used it many times and not been lost yet!

Someone helped us on our first trip telling us where to go. Later there were workers who would help us to get on the right trains if we needed to ask
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Great way to get around town, easy to use very clean and safe. The EZ link card is the way to go and very easy to use and top up."
,,"Fast efficient, cheap, easy to use and understand",5.0,,Used the singapore mass transit system the whole time we were in singapore. Just so easy to get around. I thought london underground was good but this is a whole other level.

They also have some Unlimited package for day and week."
,,Fun,5.0,,"Fun , convenient and time saving along with cost effective
And this has easy route to understand for an outsider as well so that they could use it too
Get the leaflet or brochure from the station first and understand the color lines and meeting junctions of mrt and lrt
As in u might have to use both to get the targeted location

We loved it"
,,"If you visit Singapore, its well worth going underground",5.0,,"If you visit Singapore, its well worth going at least once underground and take a train to see the efficiently, safety and cleanness of the tube."
,,MRT is excellent,5.0,,The MRT is clean and efficient and takes you pretty much almost everywhere you might want to go. It is convenient and is continually being expanded. If you are not on the MRT then the buses go all over. I have been more and more impressed with the system on each trip to Singapore.
,,Good and easy,5.0,,MRT Public Transportation is easy and good. You can buy a tourist pass for 1-3 Days 10/15/20 SGD plus 10$ deposit. But it is cheaper to buy the single rides we figured out. Everything is very clean and we never had any delays.
,,"Easy, safe, comprehensive, and inexpensive !!",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is, as you'd expect, fast, efficient, safe, reliable, plentiful, and quite inexpensive to use.
It's also quite EASY to use by tourists, and gives fast efficient access to most of Singapore's tourist hot spots, including the Cruise Terminal and Airport.
The Tourist Pass, available for 1, 2, or 3 days, and purchased in most larger MRT stations from the Ticket Office, provides tourists with unlimited access to most train and bus services, for a very reasonable price, and eliminates the need for constantly lining up for and buying single tickets for travel.
Because however the single ticket prices are so cheap anyway, you may wish to consider just how much travelling you may be doing in the period you're there, as it might still be cheaper for you to buy individual tickets, than to buy one of the Passes, especially if you're counting your travel $$.
FYI, the 3-day Tourist Pass costs $20, plus a refundable $10 deposit for the card itself, and the card's clock starts ticking from the moment you first use it, however Day 1 of the 3 days is over at midnight i.e. use it carefully to maximise its value to you!!"
,,"Intuitive, easy and well organised",5.0,,"A first couple of hours was enough to get acquainted with the MRT.
It's very well organised, beautifully engineered and accessible everywhere so much so that taxi aren't really a must. With Google maps on your smart phone, things get even easier. Totally recommend and buy an ezlink card for tourists visiting"
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"MRT signage is very clear and helpful-just be careful to pay attention to which floor your platform is on. There are only about 5 lines so that minimizes confusion. Trains run on schedule and are very clean. A great plus is most of the trains have interactive signage which indicates current and future stops as well as which side the doors will open. Very helpful.

Overall al great mass transit experience."
,,Excellent MRT,5.0,,"So easy to navigate around Singapore with the MRT but more importantly, it is so CLEAN and efficient. There are designated seats marked for the elderly/pregnant ladies etc. which is a nice touch."
,,Just as you expected of Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is super clean, quick and efficient. They linked almost to every main area and there's always places where you can go just near the MRT exit. For a cheaper option, rather than buying a single journey ticket, buying the EZ link card and refund it on the day you leaving will be a better idea."
,,easy to use,5.0,,"These MRTs are very good to use, easily understandable, time saver, accessible to all important places."
,,MRT is Brilliant and cost effective!,4.0,,"I'll admit to being a little snobby - and avoid public transport. However my wife forced me to take a ride on the MRT, and i was pleasantly surprised! It was clean and reliable! We ended up saving a fortune compared to catching a taxi/cab everywhere! If i'm ever in SG again, i would definitely use the MRT as my primary mode of transport. Do look into saver tickets and you could save alot more money."
,,More frequent and timely,4.0,,"If we have ez card, it's better to use MRT or LRT. Where it has covered almost entire Singapore. It is very cheap compare to cabs, may we can book cab once we reach nearby station. But if you want to buy ticket and travel, the line will be more and at least it will take 10 Mon. Better to use ez card."
,,pretty ice public transport,4.0,,"I went to the airport, also to China town on this, I was amazed at how few folks were using it during peak times. Clean, pretty fast, efficient, I liked it."

I recommend anyone here for a few days to use it."

,,Easy to use - recommend Singapore trains,5.0,,"We had no issues using the trains in Singapore. We were there for a week obtained an Ez-link card, available from any station. It is also valid on buses which we used to access some attractions. The card cost $12 and came with $7 value. The fares are inexpensive; there is a schedule at every station. The card can only be used if there is $3 value and it indicates a need to top up when used. The top up is at a machine at the station and is easy to use. There is a top up minimum. So it is wise to peg usage so there is no need to spend to top up when there is little chance of using the funds. However it is cheaper than taxis. The trains were clean, run constantly with little waiting. Route maps are readily available. We did many journeys changing trains a couple of times with no issues. There are times when there is considerable walking within stations with many escalators. At all stations there are lifts available for strollers wheelchairs etc. We always the local people ready to help and very courteous. Only on a few occasions did we have to stand as younger folk stood for we older folk!"

,,Smooth,4.0,,"It took us about 10 minutes to figure out how the system worked, but once we did, MRT provided smooth, efficient transport wherever we needed to go."
,,fast and efficient,5.0,,"Best and the cheapest way to travel in Singapore. Mostly on time, very clean and comfortable even for seniors and families"
,,Great mass transit system,5.0,,"The city's MRT is modern, clean, efficient, links all of the main city attractions. Ticket dispensing machines are very user friendly and Metro personnel speak English and go out of the way to assist tourist."
,,So Impressive,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT ticks all the boxes. It's clean, efficient, cheap and easy to use. It brings all of the popular Singapore tourist areas (Orchard Rd, Chinatown, little India, Marina Bay) to within easy reach regardless of where you are staying."
,,Fast reliable service,5.0,,"great service, fast and clean. You do however need to make sure you have change as they don't take credit card."
,,Convenience at its best,5.0,,Really easy to use metro system in Singapore. Extremely convenient and very well planned out all around Singapore. Transfer was easy too with connecting interchanges and large signs all around the stations.
,,One of the best travel options in Singapore,5.0,,The trains run smooth like clockwork and provide a best and cheap option to go from anywhere to anywhere in Singapore
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"I find this metro/subway system to be one of the best in the world.

Trains are well maintained and the network coverage is very comprehensive (almost the entire island). Stations are also equipped to be accessible to those on wheelchairs.

On the whole, what makes it world class is it's cleanliness and extensive coverage.

I understand that they had some breakdown issues in the earlier part of 2018 but it appears that they have fixed them."
,,I've seen this system grow.,5.0,,"I've visited Singapore about 17 times since 1995 and seen the MRT grow from one line and two branches to the current five MRT and three Light Rail lines with two more MRT lines on the way.

It is fast, cool and very efficient, after a few problems two or three years ago it is now an incredibly reliable system with a long running day - last trains now leave the City Centre at around midnight.

Using a Tourist Pass or an E-Z Card, both of which are stored journey cards will save you money and gives you incredible flexibility using MRT. LRT, Buses, Taxis and even fast food outlets!

The original East-West Line is now 30 years old but doesn't look it although its trains will be replaced by 2022."
,,Most convenient way to travel,4.0,,Singapore is freakishly expensive. Thankfully the MRT connectivity is superb and you barely need to take a taxi to get around. Very easy and affordable medium of traveling.
,,Best way to move around in SG,5.0,,"We bought 3 passes (3adults) for 5 days. It costs you 0,90SG$/a trip, quite reasonable in SG. It takes you everywhere at least for us. Cheap, convenient and very clean."
,,Easy to use. Cheap. Efficient,5.0,,"We purchased a NETS card at the station for S$12. It includes $7 of travel and $5 service fee. You will need to show your passport when you purchase.
You can top up in $10 increments at any station.
We added $10 to ours (so $22 total each) and that gave us 4 days of train travel to many different locations.
You can use the NETS card on buses and trains.
MRT is very easy to use. The trains leave every few minutes. The routes/lines are on information boards at every station. Colour coded and easy to interpret.
The trains are very clean and air conditioned.
No food or drinks allowed on the trains."
,,Let A Singaporean Guide You,5.0,,"I am Singaporean and would like to help fellow travellers tour Singapore on the cheap without tours and guides. You land at Changi Airport, the East West MRT is there. If you book a hotel beside this Line (google Singapore MRT) it will be very covenient to visit most tourist sports, example Sentosa Island where Universal Studio is (a whole day trip). Or Orchard Road for shopping. Botanical Garden is another example.
Taxis are not expensive and you can book a taxi using Grab and be picked up at the place you prefer. Starting meter fee is S$3.90. Our MRT system practically links to every important part of our country. You can book a 5 day ticket at the airport. New ones are being.
BUT, not during morning and after work, too crowded. Each stop is roughly 2 minutes. No eating or drinking or photography in the MRT Terminal. I do the same thing when I go to Hong Kong as they have just as good MTR. Those money you save can go to better neals, yum...
It is not a big problem bringing you luggage into the train compartment.
So, do a bit of research and plan, and, save yourself some money."
,,Travel made easy,5.0,,Singapore MRT is well organised and connects through different coloured lines to different areas.we can look into nap and understand how to reach our destination in no time. It connects through out the stretch of Singapore connecting all areas..works very smooth and safe at any time even for single person.you can take prepaid cards and use it for multiple travel and you can recharge at self service counters and also reimburse balance amounts counters.there arexserbice counters too.they speak English.i enjoyed seeing Singapore through MRT this time..and it's cheap..I would suggest one time atleast should travel by foot and MRT to explore Singapore .near the MET is connecting bus service area and can get taxis too if you want to travel this way.all places can be explored through MRT
,,Very Easy,5.0,,"Fast cheap and very easy, great way to get around easy to get tickets from the machines and the trains were very clean with no litter."
,,Safe and convenient,5.0,,"I have travelled a lot and used lots of metro systems in my life. I gotta say that in terms of punctuality, cleanliness and safety, Singapore is outstanding. I can only recommend taking the MRT to get around Singapore."
,,Brilliant and Easy to Navigate,5.0,,"This is one of the best we have ever travelled on. So easy to work out and English translation available. Be aware when purchasing tickets from machines it doesn’t accept $10 bills, only $5. We were caught out and a lovely local helped us with change. We also purchased a 3 day tourist pass which included the airport. The cost was $30 with a refund of $10 when your time has elapsed. We cashed it in at Changi Airport. It was a great time saver for us."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Can get crowded but it runs at regular intervals and like everything else in the city is very clean, also very cheap with the EZ Link card."
,,Best underground travel experience ever,5.0,,"The trains are on time, they are frequent, they are clean and spacious, they are wonderfully air-conditioned, part of a large network and overall exude efficiency (and cost-effectiveness) on every level. The gold standard."
,,Fantastic Transit,5.0,,"The Singapore metro system is very safe, reliable and clean. Their tourist pass is the way to go! Some stations even have information volunteers on the weekends."
,,One of the best Train system in the world,5.0,,I like the layout of this Transit system. It is clean and comfortable and there is no way that you can fall onto the rail track
,,Seamless,5.0,,The MRT is a fast and efficient service that gets you around the city in minutes. So easy to navigate and only wished that we had used it to travel to our hotel rather than use a taxi. The stations and trains are spotlessly clean and well maintained.
,,cheap and good to travel around singapore,4.0,,cheap and good to travel around Singapore but it will get crowded at 7-9am and 5pm onwards. it is convenient.
,,The best way to get round Singapore,5.0,,"We used the MRT to get everywhere we needed, including all the way out to the Zoo. It's quick, frequent, super clean and pretty cheap"
,,How easy!,5.0,,This system is very efficient and makes it very easy to get around Singapore. The staff were also very helpful and friendly.
,,Amazing system easy to use,4.0,,"Explore every corner of Singapore by using this mass rail transit. When you do so you can enjoy the people watching and feel like a local. Cheep, easy to follow and gets you to where you want to go quickly. Tip: walk to the front and watch your journey as you wind thru the illuminated tunnels like you are on a roll a-coaster"
,,Very easy to use,4.0,,The only grumble I have is that you cannot use a credit card on all ticketing machines and nominate a set amount to add to a card . You can buy day passes but not at all stations. But good clean services. And well timed. The most you will have to walk is 5 minutes to a station. There is a glitch in the system when it comes to the zoo connecting bus...needs to be more of them and drivers need to be better spoken.
,,Well connected,5.0,,I took only the SRMT to tour Singapore. There is at least one SRMT station closer to any tourist attraction so it is easy to move around. Also it is cheap and the train frequency is amazingly great. Also the direction and sign boards are marked well..so no hassle in finding the directions. Better buy an Ez link card on arrival. It cost 10SGD.
,,Great experience,5.0,,Awesome experience. Very well done and the underground subways are clean and neat. Punctual to the dot and is a must visit for everyone. You should definitely take a ride atleast for one stop to experience this.
,,Clean trains shame about the ticket machines,4.0,,"Trains are clean and modern with sliding doors at stations which make it very safe. Only complaint is the ticketing. While the price of a trip is very cheap, top up can be a nightmare. Do not try to do it at a busy station. Use a 7-11 if in doubt. We needed to top up when leaving Gardens by the Bay nearest station about 9pm. Queued for at least half an hour. There were 5 machines but a crowd of people. The staff in the ticket office were twiddling their thumbs as they did not do top ups! Minimum top up was $10 but machines only took coins and notes up to $5 so we had to get change from ticket office. You could top up by card but that would not have reduced the waiting time."
,,Good,4.0,,Tried it out when going a long way through the city when a lot of traffic. Comfortable and worked great.
,,"Like Singapore, an immaculate experience",4.0,,"Singapore isn't a huge land mass, so the tube system isn't as extensive as, say, London. Consequently t's esy to navigate, often assisted voluntarily by the charming residents of the City. A lot less grubby too. then again, it's not 140 years old. The ticket machines are bang up to date and take a little working out, but they take all sorts of notes and coinage. Excellent value and the best way to get around."
,,Easy way explore the city,5.0,,"Realiable and easy to use. Clean and safe. Buy a tourist card for 3 days or a single ticket, you can easily top up your ticket."
,,Nicest I have experienced,5.0,,"The MRT is not a great surprise, but it is brilliant. This city has its stuff together more than any I have ever been to. Whatever the opposite of places like San Francisco, Portland and Paris this is it. Incredibly well designed, spotlessly clean, frequent and timely are the descriptors I would use. I cant remember the last time I put my hands on a rail or handle on public transportation anywhere in the world and it was clean. The MRT is really first class and first world."
,,"Fast, frequent and reliable",5.0,,"Fast, frequent and reliable. We got a 2 day pass, which is excellent value and you get a $20 refund when you return it, so it's well worth it if you plan on taking a few trips.

Very easy to understand once you get your head around it.

100000000000% better than anything in the UK."
,,Amazing metro system!,5.0,,"The system and the infrastructure is really really good and modern!!
Just the whole system around the tourist pass isn’t that good. If you wanna buy it you need the ticket booth which isn’t always open...but all in all the 3 day pass I had was really good."
,,Puts London's tfl to shame,5.0,,"Really easy to understand, clean and fast service, London and most European cities need to take note."
,,Easy to Use and efficient,5.0,,easy to use and very efficient. Initially it took same getting use to but the staff were very helpful. Used a 3 day Tourist pass ($30 Singaporean) Could travel anywhere on the network and as often as we liked.
,,Convenience transport,5.0,,"Visiting any place in singapore was really convenience by MRT, fast and always on time. And with MRT top uo card our vacation would be less hassle. The card could be use for bus as well."
,,Simple and affordable to use,5.0,,"I was really impressed by Singapore’s MRT! I’m an avid user of public transport, but this is easy and friendly for those who may be a little intimidated to use public transport (particularly overseas). And it’s so quick and cheap! $15 lasted me 4 days (including to and from the airport). I bought one at the airport station ticketing office (not just a one off ticket at the self serve platform) and grabbed a map which is also very clear to follow. You can keep your card and top up within 5 years if you go back to Singapore and use the MRT again, rather than buying a new one.
And if you’re stuck, the station staff are helpful in directing you were to go."
,,"Cheap, frequent, efficient, easy, clean",5.0,,"If you are a Londoner, this knocks spots off the tube. It’s the best way to get around the major areas of Singapore. Access is easy, the stations are clean, the trains efficient.

Oh... and how much??? Super cheap compared to most European and US cities I have visited.

If you plan to use the MRT a lot, get a card from a ticket office or 7-11 as it’s easy to re-charge and beats queuing for tickets."
,,It gets you everywhere.,5.0,,The MRT network in Singapore is well connected and plan and pretty much gets you to almost every where you need to go as a tourist. I had heard that there were issues with the trains but we did not experience any issues. It is easy to navigate and a cost effective way to travel around Singapore
,,"So clean, so easy to use, so cheap",5.0,,"Spent 3 days using SMRT to get around Singapore - it was all so easy to use. Carriages are air conditioned, very clean and completely on time. This is the easy, fast way to get around Singapore"
,,Incredibly efficient and clean,5.0,,Never been in a subway that is so clean safe and in time as the singapore. Fines for carrying food are high that probably explains it!
,,Very easy to get around,5.0,,"Very easy to use and very clean! The staff speak english and are very helpful. The rapid transit has air conditional as well. Try it, very easy."
,,Easy for the GPS-imparied,5.0,,"MRT's were clean and organised, people kind and respectful. Never felt out of depth as the signage was always clear"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"We found the underground so easy to use. We bought return or single use tickets from the machine. The only thing is it does not take $10 or larger notes, but the staff will happily change your larger notes at the ticket office."
,,The only way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"So easy to use. Very clean, plenty of carriages, high frequency and always on time. We recommend getting a multi-day pass."
,,An efficient means of transport,5.0,,"Frequent trains which run regularly.
The network now covers most of the island so what's not to like.
No eating or drinking permitted so the trains are clean.
The only disadvantages, as with any underground system, is that sometimes it is a long walk between stations and obviously no good for sight-seeing."
,,Clean,5.0,,"The trains are very clean of course bring food or drinks are forbidden. Security is excellent. No cheaters, everybody pay for it . I like that. Even there is too many cameras."
,,Best and convenient,5.0,,"By far the best public transport service every. It’s cheap, connected everywhere, convenient and most of all reliable and safe. I use it always when I come to Singapore and I’m sure I’ll use it again. It’s free for kids but need to get the card, don’t worry staff there are very helpful and friendly."
,,MRT in singapore,5.0,,MRT in singapore is very comfortable and hassle free transport medium to commute. It connects almost every point to visit and reaches to destination briefly.
,,Clean & fast,5.0,,We’ve used the SMRT while visiting Singapore. It’s easy to use and very efficient. It’s safe and clean and relatively inexpensive.
,,Great way to get to and from Changi Airport,5.0,,The MRT is a great way to travel between the city and the airport if you are on a budget. We wore backpacks which made it easy to get on and off the trains. Our hotel was very close to one of the MRT stations which was a bonus. Cost is low and purchase of tickets is very simple. The station is in the Changi Airport facility. We had to do one train change to get from the centre of Singapore to the airport but the change was well sign posted and simple. Get yourself a MRT map online or have the app on your phone. This is a definite way to travel for backpackers.
,,"Clean, secure & efficient!",5.0,,"Perhaps the most clean metropolitan transport system in the world. Singaporeans really can be proud of their public trains, they run fast, they´re always on time and clean. You get fine if you eat or drink inside of them. The tickets prices are cheap!"
,,Very nice transit!,5.0,,Nice way to tour the city. The SMRT is easily accessed. If visiting consider the tourist passes. You can get from stations like Bugis which was handy for me.
,,Very clean and easy to use,4.0,,"We used the MRT over the 5 days we stayed in Singapore. Very clean and modern stations and trains. Ticket machines easy to operate just select the station you want to go to and how many tickets, easy! Good information at all of the stations to point you in the direction you want to go. Plenty of friendly staff available to offer help too. Nice break in the air conditioned trains and stations too!!
Average of $1-60 per trip, tourist 1,2 or 3 day Ezi passes available too if you are going to only travel by MRT."
,,Quick and efficient,5.0,,"Coming from South Africa where our transport system is sub par, made the MRT seem like the most amazing form of public transport we have ever seen. Waiting for a train takes about 5 minutes, they are clean and can get you just about any where in the city"
,,The Best in the World,5.0,,"SMRT is without doubt the most efficient, cleanest and organised anywhere. Very good pricing and covers most of the Island. When in Singapore make use of it."
,,just supperb,5.0,,"amaizing how it provides for the blind or any one with any disability, cleaner than many hospitals !!! and friendly to foreigners"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Efficient and inexpensive. Stations and trains are in pristine condition and scrupulously clean. Easy access to whole city.
,,Tourist Pass,5.0,,"We purchased the two day pass, $26 each with a refund of $10 at the airport. Cheap travel, easy to us, cool and very clean. We did go in the wrong direction a couple of times but no problem, just get off and cross to the opposite side to correct your journey."
,,Using MRT,5.0,,"Very easy and efficient and cheap way to travel. But a ticket (plastic card) at counter at station. I think it was around $7-$10 then add money to it.
Can reload at machines easily - min $10 reload with cash or cards. Instructions in English.
Tap on tap off through turnstiles at each station and shows you what trip cost - mostly under a dollar and shoes you balance remaining. Can venture all over Singapore very easily - so quick - colour coded - maps everywhere. A must to use for safe, easy and cheap travel"
,,Brilliant way to travel,5.0,,"So easy to figure out, buy tickets and usually a short walk from where you need to go. Remember to recycle your tickets or reuse them by adding money to the next trip,"
,,"Clean, easy, cheap and fast.",5.0,,Undoubtedly the easiest way to get around Singapore. I do suggest you checkout a YouTube video on how to use the system first as it really helps understand the travel card system. It's otherwise v straight forward.
,,SMRT-Best Way to Travel in SIN !,5.0,,"My wife & I visited Singapore for 5 days Dec 29 to-Jan 2,2019. We bought a MRT pass for SGD15 .Best investment we made. We went everywhere in its fast/spotlessly clean cars & stations..
NYE2019 was the real test of Transit efficienccy & Customer Service. Before the finish of giant Fireworks display ,we went from the convenient Marina Bay Sands Hotel station with lots of help/guidance from MRT Volunteers to our hotel on Orchard Road in less than 25 minutes. After 4 days we still had SGD 11.00 left on our transit card.Bravo SMRT!"
,,Idiots guide to Singapore MRT,4.0,,"Singapore's MRT system is super easy to use. You can purchase a ticket at the machine, or at the ticket counter. Don;t be nervous of using the ticket machines as they are actually very easy to work,.You can pay with cash or card. For card, only certain of the machine accept it so look for the sign above the machine indicating it accepts cards.

For the cash machines, be aware that the maximum note accepted is a S$5 bill. If you need change you can get this at the Info counter (no need to stand in the ticket counter queue).

Paying for your ticket is as easy as selecting which station is your destination. You can do this on the screen by choosing ""map"" or the list of stations. As most visitors won;t be familiar with the MRT map it is easier to select ""List of stations"", which is in alphabetical order. Just scroll through and select your destination. Choose one way or return, and then select the number of tickets - and then just pay the amount indicated. It really is that easy - so don;t be daunted by the machines!

Just remember to retain your card for exit at your destination (or your return journey). One thing to remember - check on the map on the wall what the end station is on the route you have chosen, as that will be how the platform is named, so you know which platform to wait on for your train. Otherwise you might find yourself heading in the opposite direction by mistake! Most hotels offer a tourist map which includes a map of the MRT - easy enough to just tear this off the main map and keep for reference so you know both end stations on the line you will be travelling on."
,,Convenient and inexpensive way to explore Singapore.,5.0,,"If you're planning to use public transport a bit while in Singapore (and why wouldn't you?), buy a travel card to tap on entering buses and train stations. You can use cash on buses, but no change is given."
,,Good option than Taxi,4.0,,The SMRT is excellent to travel around convenient and cheap.No hold up in traffic .easy to move around and quick .get a day pass more convenient.
,,Great System,5.0,,"Like many cities in Asia, SMRT has become a must have for mega cities like Singapore, we need it in Sydney :("
,,Great way to get about cheaply,5.0,,"We were only here for 2 night so purchased the two day visitor pass. The MRT is clean, efficient and reliable. We found it easy to navigate. Got some money back on the passes at the end of the two days. See more of the city by using the MRT."
,,"Vast connectivity, Low Cost, Clean and safe for kids",5.0,,"With a toddler, I had apprehensions but this is so well designed that we never felt any issue commuting through SMRT. The only drawback is travel duration but if you compare it with the price you are paying, it is like free."
,,Bring this system to England please,5.0,,"Wow, never thought I would get so excited and review a 'tube station' but really, the whole system is truly amazing, the subways were more like hotel entrances, everywhere was spotless. The great idea of waiting lanes to let others Off train first... The trains were spotless...the ticket machine were easy to follow and purchase from, and very cheap to get about. Well done Singapore for such a great service, you should be very proud....."
,,The fastest and cheapest way to roam around Singapore city,5.0,,"Each and every necessary information are displayed. Neat , clean and fast. If you are a tourist and want to see city within 2 -3 days best purchase a unlimited card from Chaangi recommends store in airport"
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,"Polite fellow riders, organised and cheap. Rides cost between 80c and $1.80. It was a great way to get around the town. Singapore has a policy that no one should live no more than five minutes walk to a station and that trains come frequently. Our ride to the airport was around $1.80"
,,One of the best system,5.0,,"Despite all the negative news the MRT has received, it is still the best in the region. No country in SE Asia has a better system than Singapore with regards to transportation.

Easy to use for locals and tourists alike, the Government of Singapore had done a magnificent job in setting up this transport system."
,,Best rail system,5.0,,"Sooo easy to use the SMRT. Don’t buy individual tickets, purchase a travel card for a small fee and load it with money. We spent about $20SG in 8 days. I believe the cards are valid for 2 years so take it home for your next trip. Collect a lines pamphlet and it will take you anywhere. Staff are very helpful should you require help."
,,"Clean, organised, reliable",5.0,,"Trains are clean and run efficiently and frequently. Network is easy to understand and so too the payment system with Ezi-link. Can be crowded, but not excessively"
,,Excellent Means of Traveling,4.0,,"The Singapore MRT tourist pass is great for visiting. It also covers bus rides. The MRT timing and connectivity are phenomenally accurate and punctual. However, they only have re-charging/purchasing facilities for Singapore Tourist Pass in very few and selected station, and that too for very limited time of the day."
,,Excellent transportation system!,5.0,,The transportation system in Singapore is excellent and easy to use. It is always on time and extremely reliable.
,,The best transport one can get,5.0,,SMRT is the best means of transport in Singapore. Get a SMRT card and travel throughout Singapore without any hassle. The fare is cheaper than any other means of transport. The MRT stations are well maintained and properly sign-marked. The staff is helpful and its convenient to change transit as there are elevators and escalators throughout.
,,Loved it!,5.0,,"I love Singapore MRT. I used it everytime when I was there and it really clean and I always got seat or if not, someone always give me their seat because I was bringing a one year old. It’s always on time, and it reached every place I wanted to visit. And also, an affordable transportation."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Clean, easy to use and extremely reasonable ticket prices. Wish lots of other MRTs would take a leaf out of their book!"
,,Reliable service,4.0,,"Overall, Singapore transit is very reliable and timely. Just recently its experiencing breakdowns but the company is doing its best to upgrade. For most of my travel, I can say its still one of the best"
,,Best train service,5.0,,There are many trains arriving in few minutes gaps and they are very clean. I always use MRT to to get to work as it is the fastest. One of the best public transports in the world.
,,Great place to cool off while getting somewhere,5.0,,"One of the world's best. Inexpensive, cool and well-ventilated, safe, frequent service. If there's a better subway/light rail in Asia, I've yet to find it"
,,Flawless,5.0,,"Travelling on the MRT couldn’t be easier. The stations are spotlessly clean (as are the trains themselves), and services are frequent.
If you’re a tourist, they’ll try to sell you a 3 day pass that gives you unlimited travel (although it doesn’t allow you to use it on the Sentosa connection). Think twice before you buy one as it will probably be a cheaper to just buy a card and top it up as you need to.
The MRT is a great way to get around Singapore quickly and cheaply, and in air conditioned trains."
,,Clean. Prompt. Chilled,5.0,,"What more can you want from a transit system. The air conditioned carriages were a little chilly in January but I’m sure they are very welcome when temperatures soar. We loved the giant fs s in the stations and link ways between stations and shopping centres. Good value, especially with the ezlink. Don’t buy tourist day passes. Just get EZLINK."
,,"Easy, straightforward, fast, clean",5.0,,"One of the best systems that I've been on - and I've been on many around the world.

Cheap; a few too many transfers needed for my taste, but each is very intuitive and easy; Everything is in English for us Americans.

A Tourist pass is available for 10SGD all day or 16 SGD for two days, but you have to pay another 10 SGD deposit and you have to go to a manned station to return the card for deposit refund. Not worth it unless you're doing several trips in a day.

For us, it worked great to get from the Crowne Plaza Changi to downtown to get on the hop on hop off bus. We could have taken the MRT to our cruise ship terminal - it gets close enough to the Marina to walk.

Highly recommend!"
,,MRT travel experience in Singapore,5.0,,"MRT in singapore is the ONE OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD Metro Train Tranport system. Timings any of the day are accurate, punctual , Neat ,convenient, customer friendly and fast. I had no difficulty at all in reaching any nook and corner of the city of Singapore and very very cheap fares."
,,"Unbelievably clean, efficient, and inexpensive. A model for all other cities to aspire to.",5.0,,"You cannot find a MRT in any city that rivals Singapore's MRT in terms of cleanliness, efficiency, and price. 'Nuff said."
,,Just perfect,5.0,,"Clean, comprehensive and fast. Efficient too! For visitors, get a tourist EZ pass and you can use it to get to most all the main sightseeing spots in Singapore! I’m so impressed with the train system."
,,Easy access to airport,5.0,,"MRT has a simple colour coded system so is easy to work out which train to take. Clean, cool and modern trains. Announcements are clear and signs at the stations are very good."
,,Value for money,5.0,,"Great to get around Singapore. It is clean, well kept, efficient & not too expensive. One can get around Singapore with the MRT."
,,Great way to travel,4.0,,"Always used the MRT to visit places in Singapore and most of the attractions are located near MRT stations.

There are people who are able to assist you if you’re have difficulty purchasing a ticket - please note that the ticketing machine only accepts coins, $2 or $5 notes anything higher it will not accept (not sure why). Credit cards can also be used as well.

There is tourist card you can purchase and you get your deposit back when you return the card."
,,Underrated system,4.0,,"The SMRT has suffered recently from bad reviews for curious breakdowns. Nonetheless it works most times and when it does not, decent free alternatives are almost immediately available. Just traveling along and stopping at various stations will usually drop you at food, shopping or just Singaporean living.

I would actually recommend the visitor to spend half a day traveling along and stopping along the MRT. Interesting spots. Try the North-East line as has interesting spots like Little India, Mustaffa Center and Punggol New Town which has a LRT system that allows you to have a view of latest HDB living in Singapore."
,,Very efficient and clean,4.0,,Used the SMRT a few times and it seemed to be very efficient . It can get busy but with some trips only costing a$1 with the day travel ticket its well worth it.
,,Very convenient. Good way to escape the heat.,4.0,,The MRT system in Singapore is a very cheap and easy way to travel. Air conditioned underground tunnels connecting stations (e.g. esplanade to city hall) are also good if you don't mind walking and would like to escape the heat. One thing to consider is that the trains can get very packed in peak hour and there aren't a lot of seats. Bear in mind that if there are a few of you travelling and going across multiple lines that a grab taxi will be faster and may work out about the same price.

,,MRT is easiest way to transit Singapore,5.0,,Have been using the MRT throughout my stay in Singapore. It is veery easy to use (by a card at the station) and tap in when entering and tap out when leaving the station. You can get to just about all the sights of Singapore for a few dollars transit. Also the top up card machines are very easy to use. I love this iron in Singapore.

,,MRT Singapore,5.0,,"Very convenient and helpful for tourist. U can buy Singapore Tourist Pass which u can also use on the bus. I bought STP package for 2 days cost $2.6 SGD ( $1 for deposit which u can refund).
The station is very nice and the technology use was amazing. For me as a tourist it's quite easy to understand.

For the refundable deposit I think it's only available in some station. Just make sure you're still in the work hour."
,,Everything a public transport should be!,5.0,,"What a great experience - swift, frequent, efficient, easy to navigate, personal attention at ticketing, scrupulously clean. Don’t hesitate - unless you want a view en route!"
,,This is how it should be done,5.0,,"I cannot tell you how great this system works I never use public transport at home but here used it all the time. its fast, cheap,clean,safe and always on time with the longest wait between trains maybe four minutes.Our goverment here needs to take a very hard look at themselves and try and stop reinventing the wheel because its already here in Singapore"
,,Puts others to shame,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, quick, reliable, easy to use etc. It really is how all metros should be - but few are."
,,"Clean, reasonable and even the errors are rapidly corrected",5.0,,"We use the MRT often in Singapore. Occasionally, one card just doesn't work. So we go to the personnel always available, tell them the situation, they telephone and the problem is resolved. Demagnetization is often a problem in the ""modern"" world and they make life easier when they just solve the problem."
,,Easily the best in the world!,5.0,,These trains are completely free of a driver and run to time precisely. All are situated underground in subways safely tucked behind glass doors and panels that line up with the train doors with precision. Easily the best way to get around Singapore with many a shopping mall directly above a station. Could easily go between shopping malls and hotels without seeing daylight if you wanted to. Very cheap to use too.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Found the rail system very accessible and easy to use. Trains run regularly and are very cheap. Only trick is to know which exit to use from the station.
,,Cheap and easy,5.0,,"As a visitor, its pretty easy to get around using the SMRT system. Go to a ticketing station, pick your station on the screen, put in the required change, and out comes a reusable ticket. Some of the trains even have screens that show station exits... a nice touch! They are also doing some system expansions so it should be even easier to get to the places you need to go in the near future."
,,Excellent way to get around,5.0,,"So easy to get around Singapore. We bought the EZ link smartcard for $12 which included $7 value on there. When you finish with your card you can get the $5 refund when you hand it back in. Lasts 5 years so kept mine for when I go back to Singapore. Mainly used the train system. Well signed with colour coded lines and very cheap to get around. Used to get on at Clarke Quay and travel one stop to Chinatown for 83 cents. Very clean transport, so easy to use. A definite must!"
,,Easy and affordable,4.0,,SMRT stations are everywhere and so easy to use. Very economical. Trains run regularly and travelling on them is very safe.

,,"So easy, no fuss.",5.0,,"This is the most affordable and easy way to get around Singapore. Trains were clean, quick and frequent. We were there for a week put $10 on a card ( similar to opal cards in Australia) and it lasted us the whole week. We went on the train everyday and I think we still had little bit left. Would recommend."
,,Access made easy,5.0,,The singapore MRT is really clean and well connected. All stations enter and exit in a Mall. The only problem being that you end up walking a lot. The people there are very health conscious and hence all tourist attractions have been designed for people to walk. We ended up walking about 15-20 kms a day. Then information system and directions are excellent and self explanatory.
,,Excellent Metro system,5.0,,"Excellent Metro system, very clean and reliable. You can get around Singapore all areas using this system. A good alternative to taxis."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,The best and cheapest way to get around and see all of the different areas of Singapore. There is a direct link to one of the cruise terminals.
,,MRT,5.0,,Metro services are excellent. All we need is a metro card. The card can be returned and the balance can be collected from any MRT ticket centers.
,,Criss cross everywhere,4.0,,Once we had some time to try the mrt we loved it. We used it from orchard road shopping district to harbourfront for 3 days. $14 to return for 4 of us. The lines are colour coded and the street signs tell u where to catch the mrt and how far away. The only problem we found is that u must have cash to get a standard tkt. This may b different if buy a different sort of pass. I did see locals using a transport card and topping up their funds via bank card. The trains were regular. The announcer spoke english and the trains seem to connect perfectly with each others timeline.
,,Super easy,5.0,,The metro system is so easy to understand and follow. All main stations enter into and exit from a mall. Very organized. Your pass can also be used on the bus route so you only have one card.
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"The MRT is on time, cheap and the best way to get around Singapore. We used the ez-link card better value for us than the tourist card. Also very safe."
,,Cleanliness,5.0,,"The interval of the trains, easily accessible, the rate, cleanliness, everything make Smrt perfect. Cheers!"
,,Practical and functional,5.0,,"We’ve used the MRT several times and found it clean and pretty easily sorted out. Each trip is charged separately, ie not a flat rate, but that’s ok. It took us just moments to figure the correct train and direction for our train. People are never in too much of a hurry to help. This is one low cost Singapore experience."
,,Spotless Impeccable Transport,5.0,,"The complete opposite of the London Underground! As you'd expect in this part of the World, spotless, clean, marble floors abound, easy to use and very efficient."
,,Clean,4.0,,"Very easy for anyone to travel around Singapore, and it is inexpensive too. Clear instruction to guide you wherever you want to go."

,,Efficiency and ease of use that defines the country.,5.0,,"We have used subways in over 30 major cites around the world and none are as clean and dependable as the SMRT. With trains running nearly every 2 minutes and clean, clean, clean seats, cars, and public places everywhere..... no graffiti or trash in sight everywhere. Special seats are painted blue, reserved right next to all doors , both sides, in every car and posted in international ideograms for the handicapped, senior citizens, pregnant women, people holding infants or small children. We noticed local riders observed this courtesy faithfully.. Oh, did I mention its cheap to ride the SMRT? very cheap!"
,,Ideal way to travel,5.0,,"If there is an MRT close to where you want to be I can not recommend it enough. It’s cheap and efficient. Oh and very, very, very clean. Unlike the u derbround in London. 😟"
,,"Quick, clean and clear",4.0,,"I can only really compare this with the London Underground which it puts to shame. Very clean, good signage which is very easy to understand( and in 4 languages), frequent and fast"
,,Slowest Transit in the world,1.0,,Horrible experience. Always jam and late. Frequent break down as well. Never able to take a seat. Always have to squeeze against smelly and dirty men.
,,The World's Best Transit Rail System,5.0,,"I have ridden on metros in many of the world's cities. THIS is the best, smoothest and cleanest. Love how the malls on Orchard Road serve as a major MRT hub. Unbelievable. Honestly, with the MRT card you can access all the tourist sites. Even the airport! No need for the hop on/ hop off buses in my opinon. Never thought I would say that for you usually learn a lot. You can easily learn much about the Singapore highlights on line. Trust me; This MRT is the way to go. Save your money and time for other things in Singapore."
,,Always clean and efficient,5.0,,"Most lines have new rolling stock, except the green line. It is easy to navigate and the links between lines are relatively efficient. Very rarely have I encountered delays, although rush hour the trains are packed despite the increased frequency"
,,Fast n good,5.0,,Possibly the best transport system. Travelled extensively n Singapore's transport system is really excellent...coverage is good!; directions are clear
,,Very handy,5.0,,"Clean, well-connected, quick, and comes very handy in going around. Isn't very expensive either. Highly recommended."
,,efficient train system,4.0,,"i actually am an expat living in singapore. it has a very clean, cheap and organized train system. it is very efficient and very convenient. travellers on a budget should buy a travel card which can be used for trains and buses to move around the island state. it also is very well connected. i does have instances fo breakdown a few time a year but that is usually handled veu pofessonally,"
,,useful for the city,4.0,,"Tourist pass required an expensive deposit but I still have it and can use it next time without making a deposit. Clean, efficient convenient. Not as useful as it maybe for the airport when carrying large luggage, requires change of train along the way"
,,Most convenient and efficient way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"SMRT is the best way to travel from one point to other in Singapore.
They have MRT as well as buses. I will recommend everyone to use this mode of travel to explore Singapore. They have day pass which you can buy on any MRT station. All stations has Ticket vending machines which accept card and cash.

Thanks

,,SMART way with SMRT,5.0,,"If you are a budget traveller in Singapore SMRT is the best way to move. Accessible from any part of the city this fast mass transport is bang on time, clean neat and user friendly."
,,Nice connectivity,5.0,,Very gud and quick to commute. We took tourist pass called stp which can be used in both the train and bus. Just for a nominal 3 day price we were able to travel several times in train and bus per day and that too long distances. Turns out very cheap and quick thn cabs
,,One of the best train transport in the world,5.0,,"The Singapore mass rapid transit is one of the best, on time, train transport in the world. It is supported by a mobile app that gives you timing and connection to bus transport."
,,Best way to travel around Singapore.,4.0,,"It is the fastest and best way to travel around Singapore. There are 4 lines now operating - green line which is East to West, red line which is North to South, Yellow line - circle line, Purple line - northeast line and Blue line - Downtown line. There is also an app available to find your nearest station and time needed to travel to your destination. Great way to travel around.."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Transportation is absolutely amazing. Very clean, very accurate and accessible. On top of that the AC is there :)"
,,Very clean and safe,5.0,,The MRT is very convenient and safe. It is important to note that there is no eating or drinking on trains. You can be fined.
,,World best Metro,5.0,,Singapore MRT system is superb. Convenient for all kinds of passengers. Best metro in asia but fair is not so cheap for budget travellers.
,,Awesome MRT,5.0,,"SMRT is the only way to travel around Singapore, its so fast and easy & great value, you can get to all the tourist sites with ease, just load & go."
,,Comfortable and Convenient,5.0,,We find it easy and affordable to travel around using the SMRT. Most attractions are accessible from the stations.
,,wonderful MRT,5.0,,"I have traveled the world and find that the Singapore MRT is among the best,first,
you can go from the airport to the city in a very clean and very efficient train.
the trains are new, and the cars are large with excellent air conditioning
many of the lines are new
the concourses are very large,,a very big space while waiting for the trains,
there are escalators and elevators at all stations so you don't have to use the stairs
there are clean,new restrooms at the stations as well
you can get most places in the city very efficiently
they are building new stations constantly
in my eyes ,it is the only way to travel in singapore"
,,Very convenient but very crowded and stuffy,3.0,,"As much as I like public transportation in Singapore, the crowd is unbearable. Recently, with the unpredictable weather journey in MRT can be quite a pain. You cant feel the aircon when the train gets crowded. With the price hike in transportation, this kind of service is really surprising. And unfortunately, there are many ppl who refused to move in and let others to enter. Either that or ppl refuse to allow ppl to alight. Go figure.
If you are not in a rush, do avoid the peak period and if you can go by bus, opt for that :)"
,,"Clean, Efficient and Safe!",5.0,,Affordable way to to get around Singapore. The trains and stations are always clean are run very efficiently. Good alternative to taxis if you have the time to spare.
,,The best,3.0,,"I have stayed in Singapore for more than 8 years. I have worked in HK Taipei India US and UK. After travelling in Metro systems at all these places, I still say that I found SG MRT to be one of the best. It is best in terms of cleanliness and passenger comfort. There were occasional delays but once in few months in nothing and the team was prompt to proviDe alternatives during such breakdown"
,,ride,5.0,,"great and comfortable ride as they provide good air conditioner. on top of that, we could view the outside as the train goes by."
,,"5Cs. Clean, Cool, Cheap, Comfortable, Comprehensive",5.0,,"When combined with buses the MRT system can get you to almost every destination in Singapore for a very reasonable price. Buy an EZ-Link card at the MRT ticket counter and then seamlessly tap into / out of MRT & Bus system. It is a good idea to plan journeys in advance to optimise the MRT/Bus combination. The trains and buses are air-conditioned.

One reason for the cleanliness is that eating and drinking are banned on the system, as is the sale of chewing gum in Singapore in general. Expect that you may be fined if you break the rules.

The trip advisor question gravitate towards describing a destination to visit rather than a transport system. So of course the MRT is suitable for families as well as singles and trips duration should depend on where you are going."
,,"Efficient, clean, safe and cheap!",5.0,,"The SMRT is the best way to get around Singapore. I even use it to get from the airport to my hotel in the city at a cost of less than $3. The trains will get you around just about all of Singapore. They run every 2 or 3 minutes so there's no lengthy wait and most of the time they are not overcrowded. They, and the stations, are always clean - no graffiti here. Definitely must be one of the best transport systems in the world."
,,"Clean, efficient and elderly friendly",5.0,,"Transport system is well organised and easy to follow on the maps. Always clean and efficient. Seats marked for elderly or pregnant women or mothers with young children. Generally this is respected by other travellers who give up their seat without being asked. One local spotted me having to stand and asked a young lady to vacate her seat for me. Very thoughtful. There is no eating or drinking on the trains. I found this a little difficult when I could have done with a drink of water with the heat and humidity that I was not used to.
Stations are clean and easy to manoevre."
,,The best public transport,5.0,,"This is the best public transport that I have used, so far. Punctual, clean and dependable. Although the local people complain of increasing crowds and falling standards, I found it the best, I have used."
,,Efficient travel,5.0,,Great way for getting aound Singapore. Safe and efficent way to get from A to B. If it has a down side you don’t see so much but they are often and reliable.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"We used it over 2days, didn’t get the tourist pass just got a single trip ticket each time. Cost $1.70 each single trip. A good tip i got from someone else review on here was that the machines do not give out change more than 4dollars so always keep your little notes/coins for the MRT machine.
So simple just choose the station you want to go to and choose now many tickets, single or return and pay and receive tickets, super easy. Once we had to change line and had to leave a station to cross over to other side and you have 15min on your ticket to tap out and tap back in without being charged."
,,Great layout,4.0,,Small country but easy to get around as almost everywhere you want to tour there will be a MRT station. Track is so much easier to comprehend if you compare to those like Japan.. :)
,,Excellent transportation system,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT system is one of the most efficient, easy-to-use transportation systems I’ve ever experienced. There’s also an app that shows your exactly where to transfer, and you can go from one side of the country to the other in no time. Definitely use it if you can!"
,,Very cheap way of seeing the city,5.0,,Get a 3 day tourist pass first thing in the morning and it will give you unlimited use of the underground system for $30 and when you return the card you will get $10 back so this is amazing for value and the system is very clean. No food or drink allowed.
,,A superb city system,4.0,,This is one of the best city systems I have come across. Very clean and polite - none of the packed trains you see in London and a good way to get around if you are good with maps.
,,Loved the MRT journey,5.0,,We traveled from Vivo City (Sentosa) to Little India - it took us about 15-20 minutes and costed only $ 2 per person. Great experience. Very clean and well managed MRT.
,,The most convenient way to get around,5.0,,"The SMRT is the most reliable and convenient way to get around the island. You can virtually get to any where on the island using this. It is clean and efficient too at very reasonable fare. If you are a tourist, you can get the tourist pass for 1, 2 or 3 days that covers multi modal transport. Well worth to get as you don't have to que up to get the tickets everytime you you want to use the SMRT. Further more the old men that looking after the que at those ticket machine are usually grumpy. (courtesy is not in their vocab) The plus point in getting the tourist pass is that you can purchase it online and collect at the Changi Airport when you arrive."
,,Best way to travel hands down!,5.0,,"This is the best way to travel around. Singapore has set up an excellent underground system to access almost everything there is to see here. Even travelling to/from the airport, I would recommend the MRT or a grab over any taxi service!"
,,easy to navigate,5.0,,"the best rail system I have used. easy to navigate, cheap clean. Just buy a pass and top up as needed, each time you use it it gives a ballance"
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,This efficient and well run mass transit is the best way to get around Singapore. Trains run every few minutes and the signage is easy to understand. Always busy but worth using.
,,Accessibility,5.0,,"You can get to just about anywhere in Singapore using the MRT. It is clean, efficient and comfortable. Just be sure to have small change with you if you are buying from the vending machines. They don't take any cash bigger than $10 from memory."
,,Excellent Changi to City Centre Option,4.0,,"Bought a EZ link card at the Changi airport kiosk (lower level between terminal 2 and 3, easy to find signage). $12s for the $5 not refundable card with $7 trip fare, cash only. Train access right at the kiosk, two stops to the Tanah Merah station and transfer at the same platform to the Tuas Link direction. 9 stops will bring you to the City Hall stop. MRT makes a very reasonably priced service into the city."
,,Really easy to use,5.0,,"If we’d known how easy it was to use we’d never have booked the sightseeing tours. You simply by a ticket and off you go, each line is named and colour coded, stations are numbered. You simply check the final destination to know which train to catch so much simpler than the London Underground. The stations are spotless, so are the trains and they are all air conditioned. It’s very inexpensive to use and has city wide coverage."
,,Excellant transport network,4.0,,Has to be the best in the world.. So well organise. Easy to use. So clean. So accessible. Always staff on hand to assist
,,very efficient,5.0,,we bought the tourist cards and used it everywhere even on the bus. so easy to get around singapore and the staff are very helpful and helped me take the correct trains
,,the best in the world...,5.0,,"No metro is comparable for efficiency, quality (and price) to Singapore MRT. The #1 in the world. With such a good public transportation, who needs a car?"
,,Very reliable in breaking down,1.0,,Never fails to break down on a daily basis. Very reliable in breaking down. Never fails to disappoint
,,fabulous cheap transit,5.0,,"The only drawback to taking the MRT is that a lot of it is underground, so you don't get to see the sites. Otherwise, it is wonderful. So clean and efficient."
,,Quick and clean,5.0,,"Good way to get anywhere in Singapore. Quick, clean and safe. Buying tickets is easy. All singes and announcements are in English."
,,Cutting Edge 21st Century Rapid Transit,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is a brilliantly-conceived and engineered system, that just keeps on growing. Five years ago, I was intrigued when I observed that during peak commute times, the speed of the escalators was increased. For this to occur without hazard to the folks on the escalator, riders who reach the top need to rapidly stride away from the escalator, because hundreds of people are jammed on the escalator behind them. A single dawdler texting on a cellphone could cause serious injuries. But that never occurred. Singaporeans can actually be trusted to understand the drill and exercise competence when whizzing up to the next level, as can all foreign visitors from all over the world. So why don’t other cities’ MRTs do this? I’ve never seen a variable-speed escalator on any other subway system.

Another example: two years ago, the SMRT was building a brand-new station right in front of my hotel, the Bencoolan Station on the Blue Line, and the entire street was a massive construction site. I was told that this particular engineering project would be rather tricky, because as they drove the line west to the next street, Bras Basah, they’d have to thread it under or between two existing lines, the Yellow and the Red; requiring adequate support for all three lines and tunnels. The whole job took them about six months, after which they opened the new station and you could use the Blue line to head direct to Chinatown. By comparison, San Francisco decided to extend one light-rail line to its own Chinatown via a tunnel; it would not cross any other line. The street involved, Stockton, was closed to vehicular traffic for that construction many years ago, and is still closed, without any progress on the construction whatsoever. Older San Franciscans do not expect to see a Chinatown Light Rail stop in their lifetime.

In short, Singapore’s MRT is no-nonsense cutting-edge 21st century transport system, as good as it gets. I also note that it is remarkably easy and inexpensive to be rapidly transported between downtown Singapore (the Raffles Hotel say) and Changi airport via the SMRT. There are some first-rate transportation systems being built nowadays in Asia—Beijing’s subway system and Malaysia’s KLIA Ekspres come immediately to mind, and Bangkok’s Skytrain is a sentimental favourite—but in my opinion, the SMRT is the best I’ve ever seen."
,,So easy,5.0,,"Don't be scared to use the MRT in Singapore it is so easy. Goes to all major attractions Botanic Gardens, Marina Bay Sands etc. Brilliant."
,,Efficient but check what you buy,4.0,,The metro system work very well and most trains are not too packed. Be carefull when you buy tickets becaus the day passes are expensive. You will need to do more than 8 trips a day to get your money back if you take a daypass so unless you want to run around like a Duracel rabbit just take a single or return ticket.
,,Great Coverage,5.0,,"We used the MRT a lot of times on top of other ways of transportation.

Very convenient and enables to access to all prime areas. Most of the hotels provide handy phones (very useful service) which is really convenient to locate the nearest MRT and follow on gps till reach there.

Entrance/Exit of MRT stations are important to follow to reach desired areas with shortest walking time.

Buying return tickets in machines at MRT stations is very convenient too. You can use the same card and upload up to 6 times.

Staffs at MRT stations are really helpful to direct, also traveling fellow passengers too.

Also would recommend to get hard copy of Singapore MRT or download the application which helps as well.

If will use the MRT intensively, better to buy and consume which is less costly rather than paying each time."
,,Great transport,5.0,,"Fast, safe, clean and easy to use for tourists. Well signed, best transport system. Singaporean people are very helpful if you require assistance."
,,Fast and easy to use,5.0,,"This system was fast , efficient and easy to use. There was good signage and helpful staff. Don’t forget smaller denomination notes if you are buying standard single or return tickets."
,,Best way around Singapore,5.0,,"I purchase an EZLink electronic pass as I frequently visit Singapore. There is a short term tourist equivalent. This allows tag on-tag off access to trains that just about cover the entire island, and interface with the comprehensive bus system. Try it out! So easy!"
,,The best transport system in the world,5.0,,"Having traveled around the world I find the MRT in Singapore to be excellent, fast and very efficient. The trains are always spotless."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,The MRT is the best way to get around most of Singapore. Purchasing an EZLink pass (available at stations and 7-11 stores ) saves you the hassle of having to buy individual tickets. Trains come every few minutes and run till quite late at night. Remember NOT to drink or eat anything on the train or inside the stations.
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,The MRT is very simple to use and also very safe and clean. The stops are all coded on colour lines and is very straight forward and the best way to get around.
,,Can’t fault it,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and so easy to use. The prices are very reasonable. The transport always arrives exactly on time. The maps are easy to read and navigate, even as someone who has just arrived. The most efficient way to travel."
,,Most efficient,5.0,,We got the 3 days pass and went all over with MTR that’s very efficient and reliable. Appreciate that all the stairs can be made by escalator. The subways are air conditioned - perfect!
,,Best transport system!,5.0,,"We took a three day tourist pass. Very well organised. We never had to wait longer then 3-4 Minutes max. Neat, clean, efficient , fast, good descriptions where to go with which line. Wish it was soo easy in Germany."
,,Great Efficient MRT,5.0,,"In Singapore for a few days and used the MRT a few times. The ticket machine is simple to understand, the signage is clear, the trains and station spotless. The best way to travel the city"
,,"Clean, cheap and efficient",5.0,,"A very convenient way to travel in from one place to another Singapore. It's clean, cheap and comfortable. The efficiency is first class. The information provided on the MRT makes it easy to use."
,,"Fast’ clean, efficient ....fabulous",5.0,,"We had excellent value from our ez-link cards and were able to cash in the unused balance. What a fantastic train service - we did so much sight seeing and got from one place to the next quickly. A cheap, clean, safe, fast, efficient, reliable service. If only we had such a system home here!"
,,MRT,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT (Tube) is about the best that I have used anywhere in the world, so clean and comfortable."
,,Best Transport System,4.0,,Singapore has one of the best transport system which is very helpful for visitors. There are two lines which almost covers complete Singapore. Most of local people use this rapid transport system.
,,Make sure you have coins or low value notes,5.0,,"Coming from Brisbane, a public transport system that consists of a cart pulled by a donkey that arrives every 10 minutes would be first class.

That being said, Singapore's SMRT system is excellent. Each station is clearly signposted above ground, with multiple entrances. The maps are clear to follow and levels are clearly labelled with colour coded lines. Ticketing machines are intuitive, however they will not give out more than $4 in change, so keep your coins and small notes to use in the machines. Keep your tickets too, as you can keep loading them for 5 or 6 journeys. Fares are relatively cheap and the trains are frequent.

Beats a donkey cart any day."
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,It's very efficient and effective. Very convenient to travel across the city. Well managed and cheap as well.
,,"Easy, quick, convenient",5.0,,SMRT is one of the easiest city train system in the World - I know what I'm talking about after visiting more then 40 countries. It is also the best option to get almost everywhere in Singapore. Surprised that there are not much foreigners in it
,,Excellent maintenance,5.0,,I traveled mostly by the MRT while in Singapore and I must say that they have one of the cleanest transport system ... I have been to Germany also but Singapore MRT and buses are exceptionally clean and well maintained. They are also on time and enough buses run on anytime to go anywhere....
,,"SMRT is a very high-quality, efficient and smart transportation system in Singapore",5.0,,"SMRT is integrated with Changi airport transportation system, makes it very simple and enjoyable trip for every tourist comes to Singapore. 1 single trip ticket can be used 6 times as long as it has balance / top up balance. For this type of ticket, we can use COINS (small denominations) and we CAN'T TOP UP over S$10 - single trip ticket is non-refundable. But for a long time / returned user, it is more convenient to use the EZ-link card and the minimum top up amount is S$10 (on the contrary to the single trip ticket) and it's refundable whenever we decide to leave Singapore and not to come back again in the near future."
,,Best way to get around!,5.0,,We were in Singapore for 6 days and had been walking or using the hop on hop off bus We decided to give the MRT a go.....it was so easy! (& fast) there’s trains running every few minutes so never have to wait long. A one way trip is $1.50 no matter where you go or if you have to change lines! From then on we used it all the time! The only draw back is you miss out on seeing the sights on the way. Highly recommend
,,Just brilliant,5.0,,"Cheap, clean, frequent, efficient. What more does anybody want? Made me jealous. So easy to get around. We used it every day. We also used it to get back to airport, cost $S5 for two instead of $S28 by taxi."
,,Great way to get around.,5.0,,"A great, efficient and punctual transport network. Cheap, clean and safe and the SMRT network covers many stations. Preferred method of travelling around Singapore."
,,The MRT was so easy and inexpensive to use.,5.0,,We stayed close to the Clarke Quay MRT station and it made our time in Singapore just so easy. You never have to wait more than five minutes for a train. We purchased cards at a vending machine (easy to do) and then we were away. As with everything in Singapore the trains and stations are super clean.
,,"Beautiful subway/train cars on the fast, efficient, inexpensive SMRT",5.0,,"The subway portion of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) looks very new. The very nice subway cars bare the Bombardier name and thus were likely produced in Canada. To effectively use the system. I downloaded a copy of the map onto my mobile phone. Alternatively, I sometimes take a photo of the mass transit systems to keep handy on my phone."
,,Good system,4.0,,"The network is marvelous but the locals are very apprehensive to give up their seats, even for the disabled."
,,Efficient and clean underground system in Singapore!,5.0,,"We used the MRT (similar to the underground in London) whilst we were staying in Singapore. It's clean, safe, modern, highly efficient, well sign posted and has access by both lift and escalators. The routes are marked in different colours, you can easily see on the map where the cross over stations are (where you can change lines). There is no food or drink on the trains (so they are clean and tidy) and a visual in each carriage to show you where you are on the map with an indicator to show you which side of the train the platform will be when it arrives into the station. All the signage is in English.

You can buy a special one day or two day pass if you are a tourist - we bought ours from the ticket office at our nearest station (Orchard). There is also shopping at a lot of the MRT stations too!"
,,The most clean and efficient public transport system we have ever used in any country!,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is amazing. It's easy to use, incredibly clean, runs on time, and a train seems to come along every five minutes. The city is well connected with plenty of undercover walkways for rainy days."
,,"Clean, efficient, easy to use",4.0,,"The Singapore MRT is easy, clean and efficient. Our only issue was making sure that we had small enough notes to use in the ticket machine. Make sure that you reuse/reload your card and each journey will be 10c cheaper."
,,BEST TRANSPORT EVER!,5.0,,"All convenient, cheap, easy access, user friendly platforms. Helpful staffs at every station. Flexible payment method."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,This is the best effective cheap and clean way to get around Singapore. It’s so easy to use and quick to get to most popular areas as a tourist.
,,World Class,5.0,,System is amazing. Miss one and another arrives in minutes. Only hassle was needing lower than $5 notes to buy single tickets.Best way to get around. We used it to get everywhere.
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,"So easy to use. We bought a day travel card for $20Singapore dollars per person, allows you to use bus and underground and travelled the city visiting Raffles hotel, Little India, Orchard Road, Little China and Marina Bay, if we had more time would've done Sky park and Botanical gardens. If you return travel passes, you get a $10 Singapore dollar refund"
,,Best and Easy for commuting the city,5.0,,The Transit system of Singapore is awesome. Easy to follow maps and easy to purchase tickets and helpful information booths. Best way to travel in Singapore to beat the peak hour traffic jams
,,"Clean, Safe, and Accessible!",5.0,,"We took the trains most places we went. It was clean, safe and affordable. The trains there go where ever you need to go in the city. It's also easy to get around and follow the map."
,,Excellent transport system MRT,5.0,,"Excellent transport system for moving around the city.
Used by all locals and tourists on daily basis.
Safe , clean and secure.
Strict rules about No eating and drinking.
User friendly.
On time and efficient.
Offices located for information at each station .
Operates till about midnight.
Train from Changi airport to various destinations.
Ticket machines for self service .
Have correct Singapore dollar currency ."
,,If only our transport system was this good!,5.0,,"Punctual, clean, reliable. What more can I say? Got from ‘A’ to ‘B’ quick as a flash.

Only one hiccup - my husband politely let others on first and found the doors close in his face. I was already on board so had to meet him at our destination as he caught the next train. Some times it doesn’t pay to be kind!

Be aware that this is not your standard train. There are only a few seats along the windows so be prepared to stand for your trip."
,,What’s not to love about the MRT,5.0,,"This is the most convenient, cleanest, easiest, transport system I experienced in both Asia and Europe. The Ezilink card system makes for economical travel around Singapore. Both myself and teenage daughter felt really safe. Felt great that after only 2 days we felt so at home travelling around and the easy MRT experience played a big part in that. We marvelled at how gorgeously decorated/ styled some of the air conditioned “subways” were. Also we think Singapore local MRT users are generally quite stylish too."
,,Not too Rapid,3.0,,"I observe the trains seem to run slow as compared to cities like Hong Kong. Although a newer system, the interchange stations for different Lines are not well planned. The walk to connect them are very far. Overall the signage can be improved by having more signs, and updated maps for some of the housing estates stations."
,,Easy and hassle free,5.0,,"It's one of the many things to must do while in Singapore. They have really maintained it well, with a vision of the growing population.

It's neat and tidy, (no food allowed on the platforms - what can be better way to keep it clean). You don't need to wait for it long (great frequency). Good connectivity, might have to walk a bit for reach the main destinations - which is not a problem as the whole Singapore is so clean and safe.

Last but not the least, it's really cheap and you just need a Ezlink card, top it up and ready to go"
,,"Easy, safe and the best way around town",5.0,,"Just like everything else in this city it runs like clockwork, is spotlessly clean and is safe. And of course it’s well signposted and easy to follow. Highly recommend using it as the main way to get around."
,,Best way to see Singapore!,5.0,,"You can get a Tourist Pass for multiple days with a $10 refundable deposit when you turn in the card. Subways were clean and ran every 3 minutes, with clearly marked routes and places to transfer - easy to navigate and fast. Really gave a local flavor. We even took the train back to the airport instead of a taxi."
,,Great Way to Travel,5.0,,"Cheap clean and on time. Fantastic footprint for access to most parts of Singapore, shops, attractions, airport and food markets.
When you buy your ticket you can recharge the cardboard ticket up to six times before it expires so it is very easy. Cheapest was to see Singapore"
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,Really easy to use. The stations and trains were spotless - and (obviously) punctual. The MRT was a joy to use. We particular liked the rechargeable tickets. Wish the London tube was like this!!!
,,The easy transportation to get around Singapore,5.0,,"For tourist, there is MRT Tourist pass. Ask the for the details from the MRT counter to know more about it. Its worthy if you are frequently traveling with public transport, else get the ezilink ."
,,Wish we had an MRT,5.0,,"This for me is the best thing about Singapore. The system just works, is always clean, efficient and in my view very cost effective public transport"
,,One of the best underground train systems in the world,5.0,,"Other than the fact that the stations are all so clean and well-designed, in usual Singapore style, the stations are safe, easy to use and the signage clear. The trains are incredibly clean and efficient as well. It’s one of the best ways to get around."
,,Very good,5.0,,"Very prompt service, maps are easy to read and understand, makes
Singapore very accessible.. however we did need to have change less than $10 to purchase our one way tickets.. this got frustrating as there were no change machines and we would have to find a service desk to get smaller change. Otherwise very happy with the MRT!"
,,"clean, fast, easy",5.0,,"the sytem is easy to use, clean, fast and safe. It is air conditioned and there is staff on standby in case you need any help. Cheap to get around"
,,efficient and clean.,5.0,,"exactly what a public service should be. It was easy to buy a ticket and loved that the doors opened exactly where indicated and there were extra saftey barriers. Despite the ""mind the gap"" warning the gap was minimal and very level."
,,The best mass transit I have every experienced,5.0,,"My wife and I got off the plane in Singapore and were immediately impressed. That continued as we took the MRT to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It was easy, we are not experts at navigating by trains but the people were very helpful. By the second day we had it down and were amazed at how easy and smooth it all worked. There is no need to have a car in Singapore as a tourist."
,,Best way to get around Singapore!,5.0,,"The MRT was fast and very efficient and all the staff we encountered were very helpful and informative. There is a $30 three day tourist ticket, but as our stay was 8 days, the staff at Fort Canning station recommended the normal card which lasts 5 years which you top up. Getting around was really easy thanks to the information boards at each station and the exits (A,B etc) were really well signed. It really saved our legs and taxi costs by using this system.
What you don't use, you can hold over till the next time you visit Singapore. We cashed ours in and you get a refund of the balance less the cost of the card ($5)."
,,Cautionary tale,4.0,,"The MRT is as fast and efficient as you would expect. It is also fantastic value with most trip costing no more than a dollar or two. It is also fully automated so there are no guards or drivers. Not many station staff either except near the gates and control room. With that level of automation, there is a surrender of control as well. We observed this one evening. The train doors were about to close and it chimed and announced ""door closing"" over the PA. A lady carrying a baby boarded just before the door slides shut. Two, three steps behind her was a rather bewildered husband/partner carrying bags and whatnot standing behind the now closed barrier. She must be a visitor as she had to ask one of the passengers if she can go back to the that station from the next stop. Obviously, she didn't have a working mobile phone so it is anyone's guess if her partner catches the next train and they will be playing tag with each other around the stations. Hope it works out for them. I suppose that's the price you pay for trusting the system completely."
,,Travel Fast and Easy in Singapore,4.0,,Travel in Singapore fast and easy. Buy a card S$12.00 containg S$5 deposit and S$7 travelling expenses. Top up the travelling expenses fund if it falls below S$3.00. Cheaper than you travel and pay on ala carte basis.
,,Good but not amazing - and beware of top up,4.0,,"I’m not sure how SMRT is number one on TripAdvisor of things to do in Singapore? Ultimately, the SMRT is a decent metro system for getting from a to b and that’s it.

Yes it’s cheap and the services are frequent, but I’ve travelled on more modern, cleaner and more interesting metro systems elsewhere (Seoul, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur...).

Many of the SMRT stations had escalators out of order - which is very annoying in such high humidity as you then have to hoof it up staircases as you sweat.

Also, you’re forced to add more credit to your travel card when you get down below $4, even though most of our trips cost only 0.87 cents. As you also have to top up with at least $10 - it meant we both wasted a lot of credit we couldn’t use as we ran out of time. Not a great system - especially for big families on a budget.

Use it to get around Singapore quickly and cheaply, but that’s it."
,,An excellent public transport system,5.0,,"We took this option multiple times while visiting various sight seeing place in Singapore. There is very good, cheap and time saving option to roam around Singapore. Travel with Ezlink / Singapore pass card would save the timing in ticket booking queue."
,,Amazing transportation,5.0,,This art of transportation is just amazing. Its clear well organized easy to find the correct connection. Access is granted via EZ MONZEE card which you can buy by any MRT station. Use it as a wallet card just put it next to the entrance it opens the here you go. You are charged once you leave the MRT area. You can increase your amount in lot of stations near to MRT. This is how a public transportation should work.
,,Best public transport in the world,5.0,,"The MRT is excellent, clean, punctual, cooling, intuitively clever, expansive, accessible, roomy, safe and easy to use."
,,What can you say,5.0,,"There is not much more to say than punctual, clean, orderly and working. The trains can get super crowded but we always got a space and even if not, you never have to wait long for the next one to come. We reached every destination easily with the SMRT and we topped up our card when needed. Best solution for us. We had to top up on our last day as there is a minimum that needs to be on the card, which was kind of annoying. The money would have been enough for the trip but as off the minimum, we had to put more money on the card which stayed unspent, should have gotten maybe a single ticket instead. But overall, working system."
,,If only other cities had the SMRT,5.0,,"For ease of use, low cost and very regular service the SMRT is a remarkable piece of public infrastructure. We used it several times each day and paid as little as 33 cents but no more than $1.23 per trip. We purchased an Ez-Link card from a local convenience store which is widely accepted across Singapore including on the SMRT. The trains and stations are clean and safe. You can get to most locations around the city with ease."
,,sg MRT is good,5.0,,"i have lived in several cities and been in singapore the past 2 years. i see my singaporean colleagues complaining about the train system here in singapore every now and then. i would like to say i am VERY impressed with this little country's system! train is always clean and nice smelling. no dirt or rubbish on the floor, friendly staff at the platform during peak hour, live updates about any train fault or delays. keep up the good job!"
,,Easy,5.0,,Cheap and easy way to get around Singapore! We never had to wait long for a train to arrive! It is amazing how clean everything is!
,,Best transport value for money,5.0,,This MRT is so very well run. So very clean. So cheap to use. It only makes good sense to use it as much as you can in Singapore.
,,Singapore transit,5.0,,Easy to navigate. Only problem is that you need exact change and need Singapore currency. Cannot use credit cards.
,,"Fast, clean, safe",5.0,,"Just buy an EZ Card at a MRT station or at the airport, pay in (Top) 10 S$ and you can enjoy using the very effective underground and bus system for around 15 rides. They bring you everywhere in Singapore in the famous Singaporean way, which means fast, clean, effective and safe for a very good price!"
,,One of the best organized public transportation systems in the world,5.0,,"Do not hesitate to use SMRT, you simply don't need a car or taxi in Singapore. Even to and from the Changi airport."
,,Simple and Fast,5.0,,Singapore has the best public transport system I have ever used. Trains come almost every 5 minutes and there are lots of staff to help you if you are lost. The Tourist Pass is a great deal if you plan to use the MRT multiple times a day.
,,A1 Way to Get Around Singapore.,5.0,,"We used the MRT train system everywhere we wanted to go in Singapore.
The way it all runs it is smooth and easy to use and get around.
Easy to hop on the underground network train and get off close to the destination you are travelling too.
The ticket system is easy to use, the stations are very clean and the trains are spotless too.
We used the MRT to crisscross the city to get to most of the major tourist spots we wanted to look at.
We found this way to travel so easy, safe and not too costly to get around Singapore.
Wish we had this where we live."
,,Outstanding public transport,5.0,,Very easy to use and the best way from Changi airport into town if you dont have too much luggage. Having a prepaid card makes it very easy.
,,Clean and quick travel,5.0,,Taxi's are cheap enough to use all the time but the MRT is certainly a quick choice during a busy rush hour in traffic... that is still very easy to navigate (if you've ever used a tube or modern railway the maps are just the same)
,,Simple,5.0,,"Simple, cheap way to travel Singapore. Ticket machines in English , accept cash or cards. Tube trains immaculate, announcements in English. Couldn't be simpler."
,,Beautiful Singapore much to do,5.0,,"We found the Mustafa centre, at Farrer Park, which we had,nt seen before . Huge and interesting , can buy almost anything there"
,,One of the best transport systems,5.0,,"Very reasonable. They have strict laws and hefty fines for eating or drinking on the trains and that's the way it should be! Spotless, efficient and reasonable."
,,Great way to get around,4.0,,"We are tourists so we bought a 3 day tourist ticket. The mrt is spotless, fast, efficient and easy to navigate. Only gripe is we arrived at the Marine South Pier by cruise ship. This station doesn't sell the tourist ticket so we had to buy two tickets to a different station as directed by one of the staff. When we got there that ticket office directed us to another station so yet another two one way tickets. Can't believe tourist tickets are not available at a tourist entry port/station. Ticket was just 20 HKD but there's a 10 HKD deposit and guess what, you can only redeem at certain stations so more single tickets to buy before we leave!"
,,If only London's transport system was this good..,5.0,,"Easy to navigate and well connected transport system, allowing fast and cool travel between locations. The trains were very clean (note no food or drink is allowed on board) and did not feel overcrowded. You can buy a visit Singapore Pass to use on the public transport, which is partially refunded if you return it to the office after the end of its use duration. This makes it easy to travel without worrying about topping up your funds. The stations were well laid out and clean, and all felt very safe, even at night."
,,3 day tourist pass,5.0,,We purchased a 3 day tourist pass that was excellent value. We used the MRT daily to travel around Singapore. The MRT is the safest and easiest commuter transport in the world.
,,"Efficient, clean, cool and cheap",5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT must be up there as one of the world’s best transportation systems. It is so clean, easy to navigate and cheap.

Hard to beat as a transport option although I’d recommend taxis if there are any more than 2 of you (as they are dirt cheap and equally clean)!"
,,Convienent travel,4.0,,"We got in to the MRT and travelled from Bugis to Little India. The ticketting was very convienent, by ticket vending machine. U can use the card for 6 more trips with top ups. Also the information for the directions are everywhere. We didnt had to ask anyone for directions"
,,Easy ... Very Easy,5.0,,Great transport system in Singapore. Easy to purchase tickets and easy to work out what to catch and where to go. Definitely our preferred choice for getting around Singapore.
,,"Clean, comfortable and convenient",5.0,,"We bought a standard ticket which we could re-use by adding up to 5 more trips, saving a few cents each time. It is worth checking out the other options, though."
,,Clean easy and efficient,5.0,,This is the only way to get around Singapore. Unbelievably clean and efficient. The lines take you anywhere you want and trains aren’t crowded.
,,Easy and best way to commute,5.0,,MRT's in Singapore is the best and the easy way to go anywhere. Its really lifeline in Singapore and its not at all crowded like india.
,,Easy and Nice - Family Considerations,4.0,,"Hello

In Singapore for a week, family of 5 adults and 2 kids.

The MRT is very nice, very well kept and a great system. Definately recommend.
Just some thoughts on getting around with a large group/family.

- If your kids are under 6, you will need to get a child pass. They ride for free, but if over 90 cms tall, they need the pass so the machine will let them through. You can only get the child pass at certain stations. So check which ones. Just have to show passport and verify their age.

- The tourist pass is a good deal, if you are going to use the MRT everyday and ride a lot to get your money's worth.
We didn't plan on using it everyday, so we just got a normal ticket. You can keep the ticket and re-use it. Just charge it up to the amount you want when you are going to ride. Note: the charging machines only take upto $5 SGD bills. I don't think they will take a ten. So you need change.
We ride trains/mass transit everyday in normal life, so getting the tickets/charging, wasn't too much of a bother. However, if you just want to go and not worry about it and will use it...then get the pass.

- We also found that with a large group (7), that the convenience of a taxi vs MRT was very good and reasonable priced. Especially when we went to the zoo. It was crowded and the shuttles were backed up. Just grabbed a taxi, and then actually took a taxi back instead of riding the MRT."
,,"Quick,easy and safe",5.0,,"Cant fault the MRT,its easy to use,easy to buy tickets,its efficient and clean and a MRT stations pretty well within walking distance to most tourist areas"
,,Best experience,5.0,,One of the best. Needs a couple of minutes to understand. I wish all were like paperless and reusable ticketing.
,,An example for the world on great transit systems.,5.0,,"Timely, modern trains, professional staff, cheap and clean. What else can you say other than well done Singapore."
,,Easy to use and cheap!,5.0,,"We traveled all over Singapore using the MTR. The trains came regularly, were always clean, as well as being cheap and easy to use."
,,"Efficient, cool, accessible",5.0,,"We used the MRT a couple of times. The ticket machines are easy to navigate and there are trains every few minutes. We were with my 72 year old Mum who was a bit challenged by some of the distances between the stations and the nearest sites, but if everyone is up for walking, I'd recommend this for all your transport."
,,So easy and cheap to get around.,5.0,,"If you want to get around Singapore the MRT is the way to go. Stations are everywhere, trains are frequent and the cost is minimal."
,,Efficient but not enough stops,4.0,,"Stops can be pretty far apart. So prepare to walk, take buses or bikes/scooters on the last mile. Very clean and regular intervals."
,,Best Network for Commuting to any part of the city,5.0,,"Get Travel EZ link card for ease of travel, or else any trip ticket can be purchased conveniently at any MRT, the network is well connected, just make sure to have a map of the MRT network downloaded to your mobile from their website, that will help a lot to undersatnd the routes."
,,The best way to get around town!,5.0,,"Great service from the ticket counters and any staff affiliated with the MRT. The trains are clean and the stations well lit and have clear directions and place names.

We ended up taking the MRT from our hotel (Marriott plaza) to the airport. We had to change train a couple of times but it was easy. Highly recommend."
,,The best,5.0,,"The only way to get around Singapore. Simple, cheap and efficient. The only thing is it’s hours. I arrived at 1.00am and the MRT didn’t open until 5.30"
,,Excellent way to travel,5.0,,"The two or three-day tourist pass is worth the cost, but it is only available from the ticket offices at specific stations. The trains are clean, safe and reliable."
,,SMRT makes travelling in Singapore easy,5.0,,"SMRT is easy to use and comfortable; for tourists best with either Singapore Tourist Card or EZ-Link-Card, which you both get at Changi Airport on MRT Level. We decided for EZ-Link Card. You get the Card for 12 Singapore $, which is 5 $ for the card and 7 $ as your credit for travelling. But you can choose a higher credit or reload your card on the ticket machines in each MRT Station (minimum 10 $) or at the ticket office in certain MRT Stations. If your travelling amount falls below 3 $ you have to reload the card.

Try and use the busses, it's easy with EZ-Link-Card."
,,Cheap and fast transportation,5.0,,"In a very expensive city like Singapore, Mrt is a blessing. Used 3 times and was very happy. At the first time it looks complex to buy tickets and getting into the right train but once understood it's very easy."
,,Inox perfection,5.0,,"Cheap fast efficient... The dream service, inox clean. What else a city can dream of? Get a hotel close to a mrt station. Get a re-chargeable card (12 sing dollars) and zip around town with subway and surface bus."
,,"Safe, easy and best way to get around town",5.0,,"We travelled all around Singapore on the MRT. Felt completely safe, easy to navigate and my 11 year old found it easy too. Purchase a card from 7 eleven and then top up as needed. Too easy!"
,,Easy way to get about pretty much most areas in Singapore,5.0,,"Very clean, very reliable and convenient. You can pretty much go to post places in Singapore. Been using MRT since the late 80s on every visit."
,,"Very efficient, affordable, and squeaky clean!",5.0,,"This transport organization brings great credit to Singapore! Trains every few minutes, clean stations, and very well run. The best way to handle payment is to get an EZ link card (buy at any station), which will cost you an non refundable S$5 plus a few bucks a day “top up”, but it will pay for itself in a couple of days if you use the system more than four or five times a day. And you can give the card away when you are done as an extra tip to your hotel staff. The bus system is great too, but a bit complicated to figure out. There is an on line journey planner, but it is certainly not user friendly for tourists. The system runs underground in the downtown area, but travels on the surface once out of the centre."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Easy to use. Great signage. Assistance on hand. Clean trains, always was able to get a seat. Cheap way to get around. One of the best mass transit systems I have used anywhere. Keep your ticket as it can be reused. No need to get a visitor pass unless you intend to do multiple trips in a day (6-8 or more)."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,"Safe and easy to navigate. We come from an area of no subways or mass transit systems, yet this was very easy to navigate. And if we needed help, there is someone to help. Very clean!"
,,Great way to get around the city,5.0,,"Great way to get around the city , quick and clean and easy to find your way around, a must for when in Singapore"
,,Ontime!,5.0,,"The train system worked very well. Bought cards as it worked out more cost effective to tour Singapore. Trains are ease to use, quick and on-time. Kids thoroughly enjoyed it."
,,What else is there?,5.0,,"Get onboard. Get a tourist pass, it’s awesome. 3 days is 30SGD, but you get 10 back when you return the card! That’s 3 days of unlimited travel and then you get money back. You need to get the pass from a ticket office which is a pain as the lines are mad long most of the time, but worth the pain for the “I can go anywhere anytime”feeling!"
,,Excellent Mode of Transportation,5.0,,"With complex network that connects many important points in Singapore, travelling around with MRT is a must!
It's super easy, very convenient, and very clean. With and EZ Link card, we can take both MRT and buses to many interesting points. Both of which equally very convenient!
No need for taxi (except for small other things) when you're in Singapore!"
,,Fantastic subway,5.0,,"Used the MRT on our recent visit to Singapore, it’s fast safe and extremely efficient, only downside we found was we couldn’t use 10 dollar notes."
,,Most efficient public transport system I have experienced,5.0,,"Clean trains, efficient, easy to navigate routes, helpful staff - even on busy New Year's Eve. We bought the 3 day day tourist pass which gave us access to all trains & buses. Fab!"
,,Best Underground in the world...,5.0,,I dont hink there is any other Place in the World that has a better system to travel underground. So easy to understand and its fast too.
,,Singapore's metro rail,4.0,,"We boarded at Rochor stn and got down at Promenade, two stations down the Downtown Line.
Very good transportation system developed for the locals. The tickets are issued through automatic ticket vending machines only in the form of a smart card which can be easily reused for 6 times, post which you get 10 cents cashback."
,,Vacation in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is very well connected through their MRTS. The entire city is very well connected. Almost all stations are underground and stations are clean. The train frequencies are pretty good to reach any part of the city.
One thing to be careful is change over from Redline, yellow line etc.."
,,Simply simple,5.0,,Best way to roam around when you are in singapore. Frequency and cleanliness in the mrt is awesome. Very accessible to and fro from all the major attractions.
,,Good system - EZ link card cost effective for us.,5.0,,"Perfect. Welcome relief coming from what we have back home. Easy to understand and lots of staff to give direction where required.

Family of 5 here for 8 days. We considered buying the Singapore tourist pass but decided upon the EZ link cards for us all. We believe it has been a more cost effective decision give we have on average gone in and out two times a day."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, reliable, great coverage. Couldn’t expect anything more from a subway system in one of the worlds large cities."
,,World Class System,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, frequent, everything you need in a transport system along with excellent stations. Really friendly and helpful station staff. Clearly a world benchmark."
,,Travelling for family outing.,3.0,,The fare is affordable. The volume of passengers is far to high for the line to cope during peak hours. Most of the time we have to stand all the way to our destination.
,,Amazing Underground Network,5.0,,"Easy to use, cheap, fast, reliable, clean and safe!!! Trains were so frequent even on New Year’s Eve! Probably the best subway in the world."
,,Easy transport to navigate,5.0,,"We found thr SMRT easy to work out from buying tickets to finding the line and train. Locals were friendly and it all ran on time, regularly and orderly. Highly recommend the tourist day pass."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Very good service. So clean and easy to use. Buy an ezlink ticket which enables you to travel without having to buy a ticket every time. You simply purchase ticket and prepay. They are very helpful at stations and they will guide you through the process. Very easy to find your way about with clear signage no chance if getting lost!
,,"Clean, Safe, Cheap and Efficient but One Major Safety Concern",3.0,,"Singapore MRT is the way to go but we learned that unlike any other Subway system we have used, the conductors will close the doors on you regardless of situation if there is a delay. The doors will close and seem to have no sensors if someone is in the way making it extremely dangerous for young kids and elderly. Our family experienced this getting off and doors slammed on my Father and hurt one of the locals. She said this is common. My Father has to get off and turn around. We saw this again shortly after our episode where someone on crutches was slow getting on needing assistance and doors slammed shut. We were going to write a letter to MRT authorities on this .....but with that still best way to get around. If not for above concern would give 5 stars."
,,Such a easy way to get around.,5.0,,"Convenient, well priced and well organised way to get around. Just make sure you have correct money when purchasing tickets."
,,best and cheap,5.0,,"Bought the card at 5SGD. used this to move around in the city. When leaving the city, I didn't have enought balance, so it was asking me for reload before entry into MRT. But the minimum amount loadable is 10 SGD that I didn't have. I only had 4 SGD which was more than enough to come to Chiang airport via MRT. Banged my head at many places, spoken with the lady at the ticket office counter telling her my propblem whether single (one time use) tickets are available; she said something I did not understand. Also asked the locals who also could not help. Finally after struggling for 45 minutes, the guard at the other end at Chinatown MRt station said ' yes you can buy a one time tiocket. It is called STANDARD ticket and showed me how to buy one using the automatic vending machines. What a relief!! Other than this experience, I loved my travels in MRT."
,,Singapore transport,5.0,,They have frequent trains to cover all the destinations in Singapore. Train is very clean and efficient.
,,amazing,5.0,,"Getting a nets flashpay card is much better value than the tourist pass. 3 day tourist pass (unlimited travel) is $20 (need to put down $10 deposit) vs nets flashpay card for $5 (non refundable) and pay as you go for trips. Trips are super cheap, for all the major tourist destinations prob cost about 80c-$1 per trip. You'll need to do 6-7 trips per day to get value from the tourist pass. Nets flashpay cards can be used on all transport and purchase and top up at MRT kiosks. This card is also widely accepted in food courts where they often don't take foreign credit cards.
Note, to get the express Zoo bus you'll need to buy a nets card anyway...doesn't work with tourist pass."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Good to commute withing city.. Mlstly all places are connected by MRT... So u can use it.. Download map and see routes.. Generally lot of changeover would b required
,,Fast efficient train system,5.0,,Bravo Singapore. You’ve succeeded in making transit transport the way to go in your beautiful city. It took us a couple of errors to figure it out but what a great efficient service. Being a tourist it got us to all the areas we wanted to see for just a few dollars. We live in BC Canada and the transit in Vancouver is so inefficient. We loved using transit during our stay.
,,MRT way to go!,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is fantastic, cheap, quick, efficient and will get you most places you wish to go. Just pickup a card and you are in business."

,,Incredibly safe and efficient,5.0,,"While taxis are abundant in Singapore, I found the SMRT to be incredibly efficient, clean and safe. Our transit system here in NYC could learn a lot from Singapore."

,,SOOOO Good,5.0,,"We had arrived on the Manchester UK flight 8.30am and we needed to get to Marina Bay Sands. we collected our luggage Wow that was fast (Manchester should go and check it out) We followed the signs to MRT down to the lower floors long walk if you have a lot of luggage but we had Rucksacks so the escalators were fine for us. We wen to the ticket office she sent us to a different office to find they only take CASH. so make sure you find an ATM before leaving the airport area. We then got our tickets about S$2.40 each. we went to the train arrived ON TIME. this train was so long i have never seen anything like it. We decided to stay on the train and not change twice as we thought we might get lost or another long walk we stayed on until DT16, about 20 mins journey but it was clean and not busy. When we got off you follow the sign for Marina Bay use exit C for the hotel as the other takes you too the gardens. Well happy with it straight into the mad house of a reception at Marina Bay."
,,A Paragon of Public Transport,5.0,,"When we checked out of our hotel on Xmas Eve 2017 it took us 1 hour to get from our hotel’s front at 313 Somerset to the other side of the Mall at… 313 Somerset, we could have walked it in less than a minute (even allowing for the crowds). This year we took the MRT from Changi Airport to the Jen Hotel at Somerset and left by the same route. From leaving the hotel, by lift to the Somerset MRT, to arriving at check-in at Changi it took us 40 minutes and cost next to nothing. The only negative was that, being overcautious with the time, we had 3 hours spare at the airport.
We are walkers and generally clock up 12-20 miles per day when we visit Singapore but some places are just too far to walk and we have found the MRT to be excellent. It ticks all the boxes for public transport, safe, reliable, clean, cheap and well located. It connects well with the bus services so that for example, getting from Orchard Road to Pulau Ubin is easy, cheap and “relatively” fast. In addition because walking often involves using main roads, there are always clean, accessible lavatories at every station along the way. One mystery - the MRT PA system repeatedly warns passengers to “Mind the Platform Gap”. What gap? Try the London Underground! Singapore knows nothing of Gaps!"
,,Best subway system,5.0,,"Clean, on time, cooling, safe... everything that you could ask for. Makes NY subway seem antiquated."
,,Important Transport Method for Tourist,5.0,,"Similar to the rail system in my hometown, the MRT in Singapore links most of the area in the country. It helps me a lot during the whole journey.

You can by tourist pass at Terminal 2 downstairs or at SMRT main station ( I bought at SMRT in Chinatown), deposit 10S for the card and get back at airport
The day pass ended before midnight not 24 hours so plan wisely
With this card you have to remember log in and out, otherwise it’ll fail your next entry, to fix the problem you need to go to the office at the train station
You can use this card to get to most tourist places except to the island by bus or metro. They don’t have bus map, you need to find out the routes at the bus stands"
,,Reliable air-conditioned public transport,5.0,,"The SMRT is a fabulous mode of transport in Singapore, it is inexpensive, efficient, air-conditioned, clean and it services the whole of the island. It was the only transport we used on our recent four day stay in Singapore travelling from the International Airport, around the city centre and neighbourhoods and out to the Botanical Gardens. I highly recommend purchasing the EZ Card for the convenience of travel and cheaper fare that the card offers."
,,A Typical Commuter,4.0,,"Being a Singaporean, I'm proud that SMRT has reduced the breakdown rate drastically and I have not met any major breakdowns recently. I wish that SMRT will continue its efforts and I'm very appreciative of the efforts that they have put in."

Using SmRT instead of travelling by taxis is a good way to visit the underground networks of shopping arcades plus navigating the crossing from one shopping centre to another without crossing the roads or traffic junction above grounds in the hot tropical sun. It is possible to stay dry and cool by avoiding the hot and humid weather in various parts of Singapore ... ie. If you are a serious window shopper, active shopper, or a foodie. Anyone else with interest in tourists attractions above ground, you will be glad to have to ""cooling period"" while in transit from one venue to another these trains as the air conditioning is a welcome relieve. However, like all major cities ... do catch SMRT during off peak hours."
,,Superb and efficient srvice,5.0,,"Our frist experience with the Singapore MRT started at the Changi airport as we decided to use it ot get to our hotel. Everything was so easy in terms of the instructions and operations. The actual trains itself are like everything else in Singapore- neat and effiicient.

A great experience indeed"
,,MRT and commuters,5.0,,"In each coach, there are some reserved seats for elderly ppl/ expecting mothers/parent with babies. Moreover, the gentle commuters offer their seats to the elderly or needy ppl. This is the best thing I hv ever experienced in Singapore. World class service at stations."

,,All day pass not needed!,3.0,,"We didn’t know what to expect and bought the 3 day Singapore Tourist pass PLUS($38) but after staying there for 5 days, I would have to say that buying a card and just adding in $10 increments would’ve been the way to go!! Each trip is calculated based on distance but for the average traveler, a few dollars would be enough for a round trip. For example from little India to the airport, the fare was $2.40 one way. And at the end you can get a refund for your unused balance."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,Super easy transit system in Singapore. Follow the colour coded signs to get around. Trains have maps and announcements of the stops on the line. MRT stations everywhere. Tourist passes are available. Good value.

The purpose is to get you from point A to point B so by definition, you want to spend the least amount of time there as possible."

,,One of the best,5.0,,"MRT is fast and affordable. Most of Singapore is covered by this Metro system. There are many interchange stations where in you can change to different lines.

So you arrive st Changi Airport tired and just want to go to your hotel. Go to MRT station and previously needdd yo pay cash at ticket machines.

This was so stupid! I and many others wrote to mrt pointing out this abnomolly and it seems they listened.

Now mrt ticket machines accept credit cards, so good news for people power.

Mrt rail is fast, reliable and convenient way to get around the city.

I have tried to use the smrt busses. But these do not seem to be as well documented as rail.

Taxi's and uber are alternatives"

Do not bother to buy an EZ link card unless you are going to be in SG for at least a month. You can purchase tickets via the ticketing counters located at every MRT machine. Difference between tickets and EZ link in $ is not even huge to make an impact."

,,Singapore MRT the best in the world,5.0,,"Well connected network, safe and very accessible stations all over Singapore. Very reliable and service on time. It was the first time ever that my teenage son experienced taking public transport and thanks to SMRT it was a very pleasant experience, my son learnt to navigate and use the tube and connect trips all on his own.

Follow the numerous signs at the stations, find the right platform and you barely wait a few minutes for the next train."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"Probably one of the best underground/train systems I’ve ever been on. Far superior than London and New York. The only thing that annoyed me was having to walk through a mall every time I wanted to get to one near orchard road or Dhoby Ghaunt. Other then that really good. Super fast, always seemed to be one in the next minute or so. Not a tone of escalators either, and very clean. Really easy to understand as well. We paid £30 for 3 days and when you return your pass you get £10 back, which we didn’t have time to do. Defiantly a good convenient cheap way to get around Singapore."

There are also station staff that readily assist you with finding where you need to go or help you purchase tickets. A standard return ticket is about 3 to 4 Singapore dollars depending on where you need to go. This standard ticket can be reused for further travel by using the top up machines for a further 6 rides. You can also purchase tourist travel cards from city hall station for one or two days that covers not only the SMRT but buses too. The stations are clean, have disability access and the trains (mostly driverless) are clean and regularly come within 5 minutes. Worth it."

It is easy to get in and out with a smart card than can be easily topped up in vending machines you find at any station. You just buy it at a ticket office before entering and then you can use it on all types of transport at Singapore. People queue very orderly following the signs on the platform floor; and people do not rush as much as at other underground’s around the world where everyone seems to,be in a hurry all,the time. This place is ultra clean because people at Singapore behave a lot, themgovernemnt bans chewing gum and also it is banned to eat at any place or,you will be caught and you will be fined.... so overall, a great experience to,move around Singapore witjoutmmuch stress, and quite many stations are,open air so,lots,of,rides are open air too, allowing you to,have a great tour of the island (Most stations outside the city centre are over ground)"

,,Easy to use,4.0,,We had a short walk from our cruise ship to the nearest station where we were able to purchase tickets. We travelled in and back out of the city as we pleased on both days that we were in port. The system is so clearly marked up it is easy to follow and everyone respects the boarding and alighting controls; no pushing and shoving as on so many underground services. Very cost effective too.
,,Slow SMRT North-South Line,2.0,,Crowded and slow SMRT North-South line. Inconsiderate Malaysian woman talking over their handphone loudly with her Malaysian Chinese accent. Noisy Singaporean girls talking loudly with their irritating Singlish.
,,Smooth and efficient running,5.0,,"The MRT is one of the better rail systems I have found, initially it can be a little confusing to understand the rail map but ince you do it's simply a matter of deciding where you want to go, as most attractions are within walking distance of an MRT station.

,,a good way to travel,5.0,,"I have been staying in Singapore for about 8 years now. The SMRT is a good way to travel within Singapore. Especially for people who do not own a car and who do not want to spend too much on a cab fare. It is pretty clean and although there have been some ""hiccups"" still I would recommend to any visitor to Singapore to try this. There are more accessible routes and mrt lines now than before so its way more convenient.
Enjoy!"

We bought 2-day passes and it cost us $16 after the refund."
,,Temperamental,2.0,,"Sometimes good, sometimes bad. Must be due to the management! How can an army general run a transport system for the public?"
,,Best transportation,5.0,,We bought a three day card and it was great.The tram is clean and quick.The signs are very clear .You don t get lost.
,,Best and cheap Singapore transport,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is the best way to travel.Even though Taxi transport is convenient and cheaper than in many Capitals the underground rail transport is the best way to travel.The trains run every two to three minutes are clean and one could travel to all part of the island costing a few cents at a time.The stations are conveniently placed and easily accessed.Singaporians are polite and very helpful to the elderly,disabled and families with children.Highly recommended."
,,I love the MRT!,5.0,,"Everyone who visits Singapore i recommend to use the MRT. It is clean, safe, timely and in all the right locations. Compared to the transit systems in other cities, it is surely the best (though HK gives it a run for its money)."

,,Impressed,5.0,,There are attendants nearby to assist with buying tickets. Around $2.50 from airport to marina bay sands. There are trains every 5 minutes. Trains are very clean and there are signs with lights indicating which stop we are at and what stop we are approaching. We had to change trains a few times but it was very easy to navigate even for someone without great sense of direction. Certainly one of the best transport systems I have tried.
,,Clean and easy to get around on,3.0,,Apart from the videos showing what to do in emergency situations that were a bit over the top getting around was easy. Well signposted. Easy to get MRT passes for short stay in Singapore.
,,Fast and cheap transport,4.0,,"SMRT is quite convenient for traveller to explore Singapore. The fee depends on the distance, will not exceed $3. Tourist Pass also available and can also use it for buses if you need to transit. Try to avoid 7am to 9am and 5pm to 8pm, this period usually very crowded. Some friendly tips: Always keep left while taking the escalator; No food or drink in the train and the station; Don't occupy the Reserved Seat (first seat on each side of the bench) unless you are qualify. Respect others to gain respect from them."
,,Cheap and fast and reliable - you don't need the Tourist Pass Plus,5.0,,"$1.87 to get to Buona Vista (further than the CBD) from Changi airport, took an hour. A friend did the same journey at the same time by taxi in traffic and paid $50. We spent eight days hopping on and off buses and trains, getting around the island, and the cost was less than $25 plus a $5 card fee that you can get back as you leave. Beware the 'Singapore Tourist Pass Plus' which includes 10 or 15% off at various places in addition to three days of travel - you'd really want to know you'd get your money's worth in discounts!"
,,Best way to get around town.,5.0,,"If you are here for a couple of days go to the booth and buy the EZ-Card, costs $12, including $7 you can use for fares. then just tap in and tap out. combine this with the Citymapper app and you can visit the ends of the island really easy!!"

,,"Well organized, safe, quick and tidy transport",5.0,,"I would recommend MRT as the matter of transport in Singapore. Speed and frequency are good, connecting to most important places, and an example of tidiness and technical operation. It is best to buy a deposit card for MRT where fees are automatically deduced from. Inner city travels can be down to cost below 1 SGD."
,,Extremely efficient and cost effective way of travelling,5.0,,"Efficient.
Cost effective.
Fast.
Comfortable .

The live screen LED map makes it so easy to understand where you are and where exactly to get off.(unlike the buses)

It would have been better if cash or coins were also accepted as some tourists may not have the time to top up the EZ link card.

We found it to be the easiest and cheapest way to get to Sentosa island when visiting universal studios. Direct MRT ride to harbour front. And then took the monorail from Vivo city to Sentosa."
,,Pretty hassel free transport within singapore.,4.0,,If only people are more kind to give up their seats for the elderly/ families with yound children. Trains arrive pretty fast and are comfy when the aircon functions well.
,,Excellent way to get around,4.0,,"Excellent way to get around, while in Singapore. Air conditioned, clean,take a tourist pass, quite reasonable."
,,Cuddly trains,4.0,,This is a good metro system that is safe and well run. It sounds boring but they have put a lot of effort in to signage. This means even the hard of thinking can easily use it.
,,A must do for those who want to save time and money,5.0,,"Effortlessly get around Singapore with ease. Peak hour......ISN'T. Fully airconditioned and all announcements are in English. I can't get the words ""Please mind the platform gap"" out of my head. HOT TIP to help: Ensure you understand the name of the terminating station on each of the coloured MRT lines which will help you chose the correct platform to embark. The colouring system is child's play to understand and familiarise yourself with the lines. Highly recommended even if you are just inquisitive about world's best railway networks. Not much to see though as majority of network is subterranean."
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"It takes a little bit of time to get use to it but we have used it for four days now to get everywhere. It is always on time, quick and very clean. There are staff who can assist you if you get lost. If you are arriving at Changi airport go to the money exchange and buy a MRT card and also get a sim for your phone. We purchased 5 MRT cards and put $7 on each a $15 sim car with 100 gig that last a week, unlimited local calls and 55 minutes of international calls.

You will become an expert at using escalators after a couple of days."

,,Around Singapore in a flash,5.0,,If you are having a few days in Singapore please buy an MRT card available at most stations. Pick up a MRT map as well. The card presents an easy way of getting around Singapore cheaply and in airconditioned comfort. Try to avoid peak times though as all carriages can be quite full.
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit Rocks!,5.0,,"The train is pleasantly cool, spacious and very smooth riding. The stations are not always as easily accessible as an older system like Tokyo Metro but nevertheless, it's a modern very nicely built system. In just a few years each line will connect making every place in Singapore easy to get to. The air conditioning is usually on high in these cars."
,,Buy a tourist pass.,5.0,,We bought 2 day tourist passes which proved to be invaluable. They are good on the MRT or buses. Sure there is a $10 purchasing fee but that is refundable at the MRT station at Changi Airport.
,,Quality travel under the ground,5.0,,"Ride was comfortable, trains were on time for the few trips I had taken. Anyone visiting Singapore and planning to travel on the metro for more than twice, consider buying a metro card for 7$ and top up of minimum 5$ available at the station. This card is valid for a longer period like 7 years if I'm correct and can be reused.

Give the ride a shot to see how it is different from other countries."
,,Simplicity,5.0,,"A wonderfully clean and organised way to travel quickly and cheaply around Singapore. Simple to use to get to just about anywhere, including Changi Airport. Extremely inexpensive and a pleasure to use."
,,"clean and easy to use, but watchout for the doorss",4.0,,"I am not one for using public transport for many reasons, however, SG MRT ticked all of those reasons in a positive way, could not fault apart from more warning is needed for tourists on how fast the doors can close and what to be looking out for when they are about to close."
,,A foodie trip along DTL,5.0,,"The new Downtown Line (blue line) MRT is very convenient. It allows commuters to connect the various lines like North East Line (NEL), East West Line (EWL), Circle Line (CCL), North South Line (NSL) to different parts of Singapore. If you are a foodie craze, there are many popular food centres along these lines where you can try different types of local dishes at less than S$8 per meal per pax."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,A very simple and effective way to get round the city. Very clean and great vlaue for money. I wisdh every city I visit in the world had such and outstanding transport system.
,,Great public transportation,5.0,,"Recommend you to buy the prepaid card. Especially if you stay they for a long period. Fair can be cheaper like 50%. Convenient and fast, waiting time may be no more than 2-3 mins. Rush hours can be crowded, check your departure time. Food and mini mart can be found at the station. Drinking on train not allow."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,"SMRT is one of the best ways to move around the city: it's on time, fast, clean, and very convenient. Make sure you get the tourist pass for 2-3 days!"
,,Clean and delightful to use; cheap too,5.0,,The MRT is everywhere a tourist is likely to want to be and is a clean safe and smooth experience. Very frequent - no timetable needed.
,,Daily trips,5.0,,"I have never seen such clean trains before coming to Singapore. As food and drinks are not allowed at the stations and on the trains, there are no food wrappers, or unwanted food thrown under the seats and hence no cockroaches! There are also no graffiti on the seats or the walls. It's a real pleasure taking the ""MRT"" in Singapore. Fast, cheap and easy to get to any town. And if you have any doubt, the staff at the stations are usually very helpful."

,,COMFORT IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT,5.0,,"We thank our authority for providing such comfort transport, the intervals of the trains are very good as one does not have to wait too long for the next one. Easily accessible to all parts of Singapore. I use the MRT to work everyday."
,,Lion Around the City,4.0,,"Like Singapore itself, the city’s metro system is clean, efficient and well-built. It provides handicapped/pram access almost without fail and when coupled with the city’s well-managed bus system, you have air-conditioned access to almost any place a tourist would need to go in the city. That said, it can get crowded on the main lines, especially during rush hour and unlike other large metropolitan areas, there seems to be less rushing about in the Lion City—there are more unmoving crowds on escalators and train car entrances than one might be used to in cities where people are rushing (and pushing) in and rushing out."
,,Smooth & efficient,3.0,,"1 of the most reliable transport in the world, well connected island wide train system without the hassle of tap out and tap in when switching from different lines, kudos!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Most reliable and convenient public transport system that I have ever seen!! Always on time, safe and secure. Cleanliness at its best."
,,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5.0,,"This is the way to get around Singapore & Quickly. Ask for an MRT pamphlet & just follow the easy to understand MRT layout. It's an inexpensive way to get all around Singapore. The MRT ""Tap On - Tap Off"" cards cost SG$10.00 (buy from 7-Eleven or at the MRT) which also includes SG$5.00 of MRT credit. Just ""Top Up"" using the MRT machines but don't let your card go below SG$3.00 & it'll get you anywhere. The transit cards also work for using on the buses too! - Awesome..."
,,Great Transport Service!!!,5.0,,Singapore has one of the best transport service. It's very easy to go around Singapore. There are also mobile applications that makes your travel to Singapore hassle free. I think the fare is also cheap considering how fantastic the transport system is.
,,Everything Vancouver's Skytrain Should Be,5.0,,"Imagine mass transit where you could eat breakfast off the floor (Singapore's MRT is squeaky clean), and no drunks, pickpockets, crackheads or other zombies. Very efficiently takes you to every corner of the city. No reason to use Hop on Top if you are a tourist, the top deck of the double deck buses that connect with every MRT stop go to the same places."
,,Good,4.0,,"Good, apart from frequent breakdowns. Good, apart from frequent breakdowns. Good, apart from frequent breakdowns."
,,One of the best Public Transports,5.0,,"Going with the MRT takes you to all main areas in Singapore. It is fast, reliable and reasonably priced. Even in rush hours we always found a place - outside of peak times we waited max 5 min for the next train."

,,"Clock up 10,000 steps and enjoy more places",5.0,,"Smart way to travel in Singapore and see more places. Singapore MRT bring you to places near where the listed places to sightsee but also to other places of interest to a traveller who want to see and experience the local lifestyle.= good walking shoes, comfortable clothings and an umbrella will do-if a shopper bring along a roller bag to avoid carrying your purchases"
,,Working trip,4.0,,Well organised. Very clean. Safe to ride on. But occasionally some of the train air con is not cold enough.

We stayed in Singapore for six weeks fall 2018.

Senior Canadian visitors k & I"
,,must use this when in singapore,5.0,,"The trains system is great, coming from a city with no underground this is the best way to get around. Get a tourist card and put lots money on it $50 as when you leave you can take it to the ticket booth and get a refund on it all."

,,"Clean, cool, cheap and easy to use",5.0,,One of the world's most efficient tube systems. The lines cover most of the island....though oddly NOT the Zoo which is still tricky to get to.
,,Easy to use once you purchase an EZ card,4.0,,"This is a convenient and cheap way of getting around Singapore.... it is clean, efficient and easy to use.

My only issue was getting an EZ card.. I didn't seem to be able to buy it from the machine, but had to go to the manned desk!"
,,very efficient,5.0,,"getting around Singapore is make very easy with this network of metro lines. We bought the 3 day tourist pass and used the heck out of it......day and night!

It was only 20 (Singapore $) but required a refundable $10 deposit for the card which was easily refunded upon surrendering it once we were finished."
,,Convenient,5.0,,The nearest stop only 2 minutes walk from my hotel.By using MRT i can go almost everywhere within short time.The coloured map also helps me to navigate easily. You better prepare small changes if you want to use cash.Max note accepted is SGD5.

,,Best MRT,5.0,,Map is clear Schedule is clear But no convinience store inside the station Buying ticket is simple just use debit or credit card Well air conditioned
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"We were lucky that the entry for Ferrar Park was right outside out hotel door. The fares were relatively cheap and we found it easy to get around. The trains ran frequently but be prepared to fight your way onto the train. There doesn’t seem to be any awareness of getting up and giving your seat to the elderly or disabled, even when sitting in the priority seats for them. I found that at odds with the respect Asians usually have for their older generation."
,,Rapid and efficient,5.0,,"Buy a 3-day SMRT pass ($20), enabling unlimited bus and underground train travel. You have to pay an additional $10 deposit which is refundable at Singapore Airport (Terminal 2) when you leave. SMRT is very easy to use. Tap in to start any journey and tap out when leaving. Unrestricted distances. Cash is not accepted on buses unless you have the exact change. 99+% of people have a pass, locals, and visitors. Take a double-decker and see the sights. If in Singapore for only a day or two, buy individual passes at the machines in all underground locations."
,,The Best,5.0,,"This is an incredibly efficient system.

We used buses and the subway each day of our stay.

Re the buses:

Bus numbers and routes are displayed at each bus stop.

Routes are available on the MRT website.

You tap your card as you enter, and as you leave.

Stops weren't announced on the buses we used, so make sure you know how many stops to your destination.

Re the subway:

You tap your transit card when entering and leaving the station.

Transit maps are posted at the entrance of each station.

Make sure you know the last stop on your line. Take the exit to that line.

Lines are listed overhead by their name (ie East West line, Downtown line etc), along with the last stop on that line.

Subway personnel were pleasant, helpful, patient.

The cars are meticulously maintained.

They arrive very 2-7 minutes.

I don't think we waited more than 5 minutes for any train.

Stops were clearly announced prior to arrival.

There are also lighted displays on the subway wall near their doors which show you where you are, as well as where the next stop is.

You can get a subway map online.

We purchased the 2-day tourist pass.

I'm not sure it was worth it from a money standpoint, but it was very nice not to have to worry about individual fares.

This was especially relevant as we took the wrong line several times.

Once finished with the card, return to receive your $10 deposit.

One way tickets were $1.50.

This system is far superior to the DC Metro. Granted, that's a very low standard.

Great, great system."

,,Excellent transport system,4.0,,"The bus and train services in Singapore are top notch. Each linking with each other. Try to use the Movit app which provides suggestions on how to get from point to point using the SMRT system. One thing - you need a small compact pram or stroller if you are travelling with a small child as larger prams aren't permitted and won't fit through the turnstiles. Hold on tight, they drive and brake pretty intensely!"

,,What could be more simple and efficient?,5.0,,"The great cities of the world have great train networks. Paris, London etc etc etc and Singapore.

,,Commuted 12 stations,5.0,,"SMRT is very clean and easy to use. I bought the regular card because of the length of my stay, but there is a 3 day tourist pass.

,,Easy,5.0,,"Used this system on a 3 day visitors ticket. We went all over the place by underground and bus. So easy to use. Clean and efficient, absolutely great."
,,Family & Kids Friendly,5.0,,We felt safe and comfortable in the whole MRT system. we could carry our 1 years child in the stroller very easily. I needed not to fold the stroller in any place inside Singapore in fact. It is very well designed for kids and family. We enjoyed the journey.
,,Why can't we have this in Australia?,5.0,,"Always on time, never misses! Paying system is also works like clock works. No mistakes. Why can't we have these paying system and transport in Australia? Why can't we have a direct rail and transport service in Melbourne?"
,,Underground transport,5.0,,"Don’t bother with taxis to get about, much better, quicker and more friendly to use the metro. Everyone is keen to help and show off about their fabulous city, so pick their brains and relax."
,,It is a metro!,4.0,,"It is a metro line in a big city! It is clean, safe, and easy to navigate. Tickets are relatively cheap. The only problem is that some of the machines only take cash. So be careful of that."
,,Shelter from the storm,5.0,,We had walked from our hotel to Marina Bay Sands but were glad of the MRT that took us to Clarke Quay where we remained in Brewerkz restaurant until the storm passed!
,,Probably the Country where you can get from the airport to the city for the cheapest price.,5.0,,"I've been to 6 out of the 7 continents in the world and I don't think you'd be able to find another country where it's cheaper and more efficient to get from the airport to the city.

Avoid peak hours though as you'll be jostling with the working crowd."
,,SINGAPORE MRT,5.0,,"The most convenient way to transit to and fro within Singapore. World class. So well networked and on time everytime everywhere.. Since taxi is quite costly, MRT works out to be a viable n most effective means of transport for tourists."
,,Clean and convenient,5.0,,The MRT is very easy to use once you figure out where to get your multi-day pass. I would definitely recommend using it to get around the city - it seems to go everywhere.
,,Best Way to Get around Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, fast, inexpensive, well sign posted, etc etc. Helpful staff at every station to point you in right direction. Simple to understand and navigate. Best way to get from point A to B in Singapore. The sort of transit system that every country wishes it had."
,,Mr,5.0,,Fantastic simple to use . mega simple and quick and mega reliable. Plz use it if you are in the city
,,Public transport to rival all else,5.0,,"If you haven’t been on the Singapore MRT then you have, I think missed an opportunity to see an unusual local icon."
,,"Quick, usable, inexpensive",5.0,,"SMRT provides a quick, clean, reliable and well organized way to commute within a dense network of stations that cover most points of interest within the city. Visitors would appreciate the excellent signalling inside the network: For instance, all terminal stations of a line are assigned unique numbers and all subway station’s exits a letter. This way, you need not memorize complex names, just follow the signs with the right number/letter.

EZLink is arguably the best way to pay for your trips if you're a visitor, unless you take the subway more than 8-10 times in a day. Each ride is around 1$S (may be more if several zones are crossed). While the card would also be accepted in many shops and restaurants, the calculations of how much you need to put are a bit tricky: First, out of the initial costs of 12$S, 5$S is the price of the card so only 7$S is left for spending. Then, recharges are minimum 10$S and you are not allowed to enter the SMRT if balance is less than 3$S. Finally, when it's time to leave Singapore, there is a way to recover unused balance, yet the procedure is rather complex and definitely not worth the couple of $S left on the card. And you can still use your balance if you’re to return to Singapore within five years."
,,Great SMRT service.,5.0,,used the bus/ underground to get around and its amazingly simple and efficient. Buses and trains are integrated maklng the service really useful and quick.
,,The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is Superb,5.0,,"The SMRT is safe and clean, with one train running after another. It is definitely the fastest and most efficient way to get around in Singapore. The signage is outstanding, making it virtually impossible to get lost on the SMRT. I use the SMRT all the time when in Singapore, and couldn't be more satisfied with it."

,,Reliable public transport,4.0,,"I now have visited Singapore on three occasions in the past 15 months and regularly used the SMRT. It is very easy to navigate the system with the colour coded lines. The trains runs about every 4 minutes, they are very clean and tidy. Only issue it that I would have preferred a system of ""oyster"" type card like Hong Kong. Single/return ticket machines causes delays."

,,"Efficient, convenient and rapid",5.0,,Super efficient and vast network. The cleanliness and maintenance certainly among the best in the world. Very commuter friendly....escalators everywhere....never needed to climb any stairs at all.
,,Sight seeing,5.0,,The SMRT is an excellent system to visit the most interested sites.It is not cheap but it worked well.
,,So easy,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is the most efficient and easy to use metro system available. The trains run every few minutes and are exceptionally clean and well marked so that foreigners can use the system with ease. You can get almost anywhere on the entire Island in a very short time. One additional thing I noticed is that Singaporeans will get up and give older people their seat when they see you get on. So polite! A one or two day tourist pass is the way to go if you want to do any sightseeing.
,,Lifeline and Breadline of Singapore,5.0,,"One of the best public transport systems in the world and yet improving every year . Its a mass lifeline , value for money and well connected network in Singapore . We can go green so easily in Singapore without any hassle . SMRT stands for Smart Mass Reliable Terrific service ."

,,Super transport system in Singapore,5.0,,"Even foreigners can use the ticket machine to purchase their ride tickets. Maximum wait time between trains seems to be under 5 minutes. Trains are automated, no driver, clean and punctual.
Easy to top up ticket value, no need for cards, just the ticket.
Highly recommended.
This is how you need to get around Singapore."
,,One of the Best,5.0,,"In-expensive, clean, fast, air conditioned and very frequent. Used it all the time. A great way to get around Singapore. Easy to use ticket machines."
,,Easy to use and extremely efficient,5.0,,"We are the in more “ mature “ less tech savvy age group yet we found this system very user friendly
Even managed to find lifts at every station ( luckily not for us but our granddaughters push chair )
It’s is clean and very fast - we rarely had to wait for trains
Other commuters were quick to assist when we were standing there with a map and they also stood up for me on the train which was s bit alarming
The cards are easy to load and it’s s very cheap and efficient way to get around"

,,So convenient,5.0,,"I would say this is one of best tube services in the world, definitely better than most European countries.
It is super clean and safe too. Very much affordable. If you a buy a three day or seven day ticket it would save a lot as you can use many modes of transport not only SMRT."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Outstanding public transport system, exceptionally clean and quiet with very helpful MRT personnel. Highly recommend as a cheap and efficient way to get around. Buy the travel card for ease of access to everything"
,,"Fast, efficient, cheap",5.0,,"It's part of the Singapore experience, easy to access and find your way around. Get yourself the normal SMRT card (reloadable), which it cheaper than the Tourist Card."
,,Soooo convinient,5.0,,"Trains always on time. Clean, cold and cheap. Ansd there is always a station nearby. Get an eztrip card if you're planning to stay for more than 2 days. You can refund excess load less 5sgd (card will be void) before you leave or spend it at 711."
,,Buy a card and ride - even from the airport.,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is brilliant - efficient, speedy and cheap. Like similar card systems in Australia and Britain, the system operates with a plastic card on which funds are loaded and topped-up. We go to Singapore yearly, so just retain our cards and we are ready to go when we get there. There is an excellent network of trains and buses, Google maps will give you best routes and transport to use and, if you are using your phone, you can download local transport apps. It is so speedy to tap on and off trains and buses. It' a great way to explore and a $10 starting deposit goes a long way."
,,Best transportation in the city,4.0,,"Very clean and sophisticated metro systems transportation. Easy to navigate to explore whole city. You can use ez link card and buy as you arrive in Changi airport or on convenience store / seven eleven or if you just do short trip for 3 day just buy STP / Singapore tourist pass that valid for limited day but have unlimited credit to use for train or busses so it’s great way to do sightseeing without thinking the remain balance.

It’s very tourist friendly and all information will get you to where you wanna go just remember to switch line red yellow or blue as according map and use Moovits app to assist you in detail to find your destination place"
,,"Efficient, Reliable, Clean & Affordable",5.0,,"The SMRT is a lesson for all countries on how to run an efficient, reliable service.

The network is clean - you are not allowed to eat or drink on the network. So carriages have no McDonald’s wrappers or drink containers littering the floor.

Graffiti and vandalism Carry stiff penalties, so carriages are clean, almost new looking. And if you do spray graffiti & leave the country, you will be extradited and punished before being banned from Singapore.

There are no left wing unions only interested in working less hours for more money. The trains here typically run autonomously. And surprise, surprise they are always on time.

Riding the SMRT network costs a fraction of the daily cost of a tube ticket for LUL. There are toilets in most stations that are spotless, and you don’t need 30p to use them."
,,Nice platform,4.0,,"The train service here is very good, but can get busy at times the carriages are very clean. You will need a map if its your first time"
,,Clean and fast,5.0,,The train system here is safe .fast. on time . driverless and very clean . The staff are very helpful and it's cheap. Very easy to get around
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Excellent transport system. Cheap, punctual,efficient and regular. Easy to navigate and plan routes. Busy at rush hour times, but that's the same wherever you are."
,,"So easy , good way to explore the city",5.0,,"Yes of course it was clean and efficient , you take that for granted , but it was so easy and fun . They have simple rules that i wish London underground would follow such as no eating or drinking , and gents arriving bare chested are refused entry . Not sure if same applies to ladies !"
,,The most easy & convenient MRT SUBWAY,5.0,,"With easy map to understand & clear explanation on board train or at station, SMRT is the most convenient & easy to understand & moderate ticket pricing. Many shops available inside the station. Even some stops are integrated with basement of a mall.

One of the best MRT SYSTEM & clean stations all over the links. Thumbs up for the management."

,,use it...clean n on time,5.0,,"very good, seen nothing like it before you can get from a-b very efficiently, but check instructions for payment of notes to use."
,,"Wow, how good can you get!",5.0,,"I use the MRT all the time and it is just the best.
I know the Singaporeans complain about it but they have no idea, they should visit Australia.
A train every couple of minutes for the MRT, in Australia I only have to wait 15mins, I used to have to wait 30mins for the the next train!"
,,This is cheapest way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"I purchased a MRT card years ago and use this every time I return to Singapore for holidays. It is quick, efficient and the stations we travelled to were clean. Never had any issues with safety."
,,"Clean, quick, easy",5.0,,"Clean, easy to navigate and fairly cheap too! Some MRT stations connect to the bus stops for easy access to other attractions like the zoo."
,,It's comfortable luxury public transport in Singapore,5.0,,"It connects length and breath of Singapore, is easy to identify the routes with map provided by the metro authority. In station everyone helping to identify and take proper desgination, the price too economical and reach other end in short time"
,,What a great experience,5.0,,"While in Singapore couple of weeks ago we travelled on the SMRT. It’s trains underground with no drivers and they are fast, economical and easy to use. The system is flawless and when purchasing your ticket after putting your travel details in it tells you the price to pay.
There is no vandalism on the trains and they are very safe, security cameras everywhere. I wish Australia would adopt this mode of transport."
,,Superb transit system. One of best in the world,5.0,,"On a recent visit to the stunning city of Singapore, we extensively used the MRT. As the city is fairly compact it is the best way to explore they city. The stations are well signposted and signs within stations are in English and it is easy to get around, Purchasing a Tourist pass, this allows unlimited travel on the MRT and local buses. Highly reccomended as it is so easy to use and find way around.

Trains are modern, air conditioned and efficient running every 5 minutes and is helpful for tourists. Also the quirky characters that are on signs on the trains and platforms add a quirky and fun touch. The best way to get around Singapore and puts many systems globally to shame in my opinion."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system is great. It if efficient, timely and safe. The different lines run all throughout the city, making travel easy."
,,Travelling round Singapore,5.0,,"The transport system is excellent. It was easy to negotiate, very reasonable and very quick. So very clean. Would recommend using this system."
,,Fast & Convenience,5.0,,Very convenience and comfortable MRT from destination A to B. Importantly the standard ticket can use infinite time as long as you reload credits.
,,Cleand and efficient,4.0,,Another great subway system. Clean new and fast. Wonderful helpful staff. Some works being carried out so a little hard to navigate in places as the signage could be better
,,Amazing Traveller,5.0,,"Firstly you must know how to transit and the train will connect you to the fastest way and saving a lot of time.The station is link to everywhere of Singapore besides residential area. Hence, the bus also very convenience to reach you there."
,,very convenient,5.0,,"Aside from the bus, this is the most convenient travel when you visit Singapore. Luckily my sister knows how to read the railway stations and we did not get lost along the way. very useful not only to the locals but also for tourist!"
,,Easiest way to get around in Singapore,4.0,,"Just get an EZ-LINK card at any MRT stations and hop onto the train, regardless the colour line! Map is easy to understand and the trains go to practically all parts of Singapore.

Top-up your EZ-LINK card if the value runs low and at the end of your trip, just get a refund on your remaining value in the EZ-LINK card."
,,easy and convenient!,4.0,,the map is simple to read and this mode is the cheapest and the best in singapore. you can go around the city with a day pass. should use this to beat the traffic in central zone specially!
,,Hasn't been anything bad in a long while...,4.0,,"The MRT system is something I have never seen before in any other place. I have seen other mass transit systems in other cities but none with the quality of Singapore's own subway. Clean and safe, expect to have a comfortable ride while traveling across Singapore, extremely efficient, the prices are more than worth it and reliability is amazing. In addition, for travelers, you will get aquatinted quickly and speed off to experiences and attractions! Of course it is recommended for the populace to take public transport because it is much better towards the environment, but the incentive to do this is huge! Take the MRT today."
,,The only way to travel in Singapore.,5.0,,"Extremely efficient and very easy to use. We purchased EZ-link cards which can be topped up and reimbursed at the end of your stay.
The system is very easy to follow but there are friendly people at the stations you can ask directions from if you get confused.

The MRT is safe to travel on with children and very clean. Honestly, it’s the only way to explore Singapore."
,,So easy to get around,5.0,,"Good value, people were so polite and finding our way around was so easy. People are always happy to help if you aren't 100% sure."
,,Very efficient and clear instructions,5.0,,"We used both the East-West and North-South lines. You can either buy cards and recharge at a lower rate or just use the machines to select you destination and get a card only for the trip. Machines are easy to use and accept notes and coins.

The trains are fast, modern, clean like any other major metros in many european countries. Clear announcements, arrivals and departures on precise times displayed on vsrious screens throughout the stations.

Charges no extra for transits. This one operates very similar to that of the Bangkok sky train. Some routes over the bridges and some underground."
,,"Perfectly organized, clean, reliable",5.0,,The Singapore MRT makes moving around the whole of Singapore very easy. It is definitely a very enjoyable and is part of the Singapore experience.
,,"Clean, comfortable, and fast!",5.0,,"Although it can be difficult to figure out which exit to use once you get to your destination, this is a good transit system. You can buy a 3 day tourist card for S$30, and when you turn it back in you get S$10 back. What a great deal! There are multiple interconnecting lines. The cars are clean. AND Singaporeans are extremely polite, and the young will offer their seats immediately to persons that look older."
,,Excellent Transport System,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore you must use the MRT.
It’s efficient, connects with all the key places and is easy to use.
The cost of travelling from Changi to the City by taxi is approx S$25 and the MRT S$1.75 but takes longer. Traveller cards are available and remain valid for 5 years.
We used the open card which we added S$25 to and after 7 days with an average of 3 trips a day we used S$12 sand got the balance refunded at the ticket desk.
The card also avoids the long queues at the ticket desks."
,,MRT fantastic,5.0,,The MRT is the cleanest and most reliable train network I have been on. The colour coded line system I fantastic. If you go to Singapore be sure to use the MRT.
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Love the MRT. Clean efficient and cheap. No pushing or shoving - it just works. TFL take note! Runs direct from Chiangi to city. Return ticket,day ticket or tourist passes available."
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"I love the metro system. It’s so clean, very convenient to get to places and very cheap. You get staff who are next to the ticket machine that guide you on where you need to go and what tickets to get and also directions.
Find it much for fun and also you avoid all the traffic if you were to take a taxi. You can get day passes that get you everywhere and works out cheaper. Definitely recommended."
,,MRT is the fastest way,5.0,,"The Traffic in Singapore is zero because of the MRT, best way to move in the city. There is a $16 dollar card that is valid for 3 days unlimited for the MRT and busses. Amazing and worth it. Some stations sell this card like the one in Chinatown and Lavender stations."
,,How public transport should be,5.0,,"I used the SMRT to get from Changi airport into Singapore. Very efficient, clean and fast into and out of town. Fares are really cheap, there is a deal for tourists that gives unlimited travel for tourists at a fixed price."
,,So clean!,5.0,,"Very efficient form of transport. Maps available to work out travel, easy to get tickets. Trains so clean, chewing gum, eating and drinking not allowed anywhere. No graffiti! Good experience."
,,Must be one of the world's best MRTs,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT was superb. It was extraordinarily clean, easy to access and trains were frequent. Charges for travel are quite low and movement between the different lines was easy."
,,Easy travel but have spare change please,4.0,,"MRT was slightly more expensive than SBS, but still relatively cheap as public transport. As foreigner, I didn't have any SGD on me, so I was hoping that I can buy one-off ticket from counter, but turns out all they do is give you change (can't use card btw), and you use the change to buy it from ticket vending machine.
Even you didn't buy the transit card, the one-off ticket you buy from machine is actually still reusable for MRT, so make sure you keep it and use it for the next one.
Other than that, the MRT was easy to use, some station like MBS was quite new and large, so make sure you know which exit to go when you are off."
,,easy and efficient,5.0,,"we had 4 days in Singapore, got the card and used the airconditioned train to all tourist spots. very efficient and cheap. most trips all over Singapore cost AUS $ .70 cents."
,,Perfect,5.0,,"We stayed on Orchard Road for 6 nights and had heard good reviews of the ‘tube’ in Singapore and so planned to use it. It is fantastic and we used it most days to get around the city. It is amazingly clean (although the whole of Singapore is ) but also runs like clockwork. We traveled at different times of day and different lines but even when busy the trains still had space to breathe unlike the UK Tube. We found the MRT a pleasure to use and noted how polite people were and how often people gave up seats for elderly , pregnant etc. We enjoyed using the MRT as part of our trip and would recommend it rather than using taxis to get around."
,,This is what a mass transit network should be like everywhere.,5.0,,"On out 3 days in Singapore we travelled extensively on the MRT. Not only is it very well organised, it is clean, cheap, efficient and truly a pleasure to use.

Virtually all the staff we very polite and helpful.

Please be aware though that if you wish to buy tickets from the machines, the maximum denomination note that the machine will take is $5 and it will take any coins. We got somewhat frustrated when our $10 note would not work but the machine did not tell us why and we had to ask at the kiosk. Get change for larger notes at the MRT kiosks."
,,Easy travel,5.0,,We got a 3 day pass. Well worth the money. Easy to get around. Clean and easy to understand. Best way to get around
,,Get the Singapore Tourist Pass,4.0,,"We strongly recommend getting The Singapore Tourist Pass but beware that getting hold of one is limited to very few MRT Stations.
It’s billed as Singapore’s Most Tourist-Friendly Way to Get Around Singapore and we’d agree to that.
You can buy a 1, 2 or 3-Day Pass and enjoy unlimited journeys within your desired travel duration on Singapore’s public transport network.
Their Metro system is easy to use and follows the London Underground colour coded system for routes which is well laid out.
Singapore’s reputation for cleanliness is evident when you travel as well which is refreshing.
You have to pay a deposit on the Card which is refundable when you return it.
We were told you needed to show your Passport to get one but they weren’t interested when we asked for one.
Goes without saying (probably) but it’s valid on Buses as well."
,,Great for exploration,5.0,,"With a Touristpass for 1, 2 or 3 Days very easy to get around the town. You get this Ticket at the Airport. Using the system is child's play. Do not be shy 😀"
,,Good for budget traveller.,4.0,,Very well connected to all major places in Singapore. Buying tickets from the machine is very easy and convenient.
,,Easy Peasy,5.0,,Great way to travel round Singapore and very cheap. Very modern service puts ours to shame. Look at day or a weekly pass it may even work out cheaper still.
,,Efficient and Warm Hearted Crews,5.0,,"One of the most efficient public transport service operator in the world. The trains system just so efficient and punctual. The signages are well established and placed at the right positions. Ticketing machine is user-friendly. Morning during the rush hours, you can hear some soothing classical music!!! One thing that touched my heart is the greetings from the crew-members who are probably grandpas or grandmas... standing near the train doors, like tracffic controller, Their smiles, their gestures... their patient... it just slowed me down to pay attention to them, when everyone else is rushing.
Thank you for your service. Keep it up."
,,Exceptional underground train service WORLD CLASS,5.0,,This incredible underground train system MASS RAPID TRANSPORT (MRT) puts the London underground system to shame. It has protective barrier systems at EVERY station making it the safest it can be - many of the trains are driverless therefore super efficient. The stations are immaculate and the colour coded train lines are easy to follow. The cheapest way to travel is purchase an MRT travel card for S$12 (this includes S$7 credit for travel ). You tap in an tap out at the start and end of your journey. I travelled for two days making about 12 uses (x6 round trips there and back ) over three days and the cost was about S$10. You can do hen get a refund of any credit you have remaining on the card when you are finished.
,,Singapore MRT and bus,5.0,,"We visited Singapore in November and were very impressed with the public transport facility. All public buses and MRT is very convenient to use. MRT stations are connected to almost all sight seeing places. I would recommend to purchase the ez-link card which is useful for bus as well as trains. For 4 days of travel around 7 SGD will be the cost per person, so do not go for tourist pass. You can withdraw remaining money from the ez-link card on your last day from any train station.
From redbus site you can book bus for Malaysia. It takes around 5 hours to reach Malaysia.

Thanks,
Shweta"
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a brilliant way to get around Singapore and a 3 day Tourist pass makes it good value too. Everywhere is spotlessly clean and cool and trains are every few minutes. As with any public transport underground system, be prepared for some long walks and queuing to exit."
,,Breakdown,2.0,,They have suspended train service on the east west line for a few months already starting 2017 and I think there have been improvements but the service suspension isn’t helping me get home
,,"Safe, fast, and efficient",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT was a bit of a respite when compared to Tokyo. There are certainly a lot less people on the MRT than the Tokyo subway.

The stations are easy to navigate with good signage. Everyone on the MRT was polite. Tickets were easy to buy via kiosks (enter your starting station and ending station and it will tell you how much to load). We also used the tourist day pas (S$20) which was fantastic. You can get S$10 back at the airport for returning your card.

Highly recommended and way cheaper than taxis/Grab. It doesn't go everywhere though so you will have to walk. MRT is air conditioned."
,,Wide network,5.0,,"The subway is the most convenient way to travel within Singapore as most places are reachable by it. There network of stations are numerous due to the multiple lines. Instructions and maps are in English, so it is easy for foreigners to use.

The stations and trains are very clean, modern and safe."
,,Well networked,5.0,,Easily can access many places fast and cheap. You have to specify your destination from google or any before reaching the station because there are lots of stations and lines that may confuse you.
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"Get a Nets card or EZ-link card so you can touch on available at most train stations. The buses carry very little change, if you don't have a card it can get confusing."
,,Runs like Swiss watch,5.0,,"As public transport goes it’s nice, clean, modern and most importantly on time. I tend to use it more than taxi while in Singapore since it’s very convenient and except for the rush hour not even crowded."
,,Brilliant!!!,5.0,,"This was a highlight of our trip for sure,so,easy, the ticketing is super easy to work out, super fast and so easy to get everywhere, if youre going to a lot of spots just get a pass , and get on and off at will, this system is so well ordered that you dont even see any staff in the subways, people just go about there business, all well organised and hassle free,Singapore is amazing and so underrated, their transport system is super fabulous!!"
,,"Fast, clean, and efficient",5.0,,"Don't be afraid of using Singapore's MRT. You will get the hang of it after the first use. It is a clean, fast, and efficient way to get around most of the city."
,,very fast but not friendly user,4.0,,so you can go everywhere in Singapore and do it very fast but all the machines to buy a ticket can drive you mad...do not accept notes bigger than 5 dollars and no credit cards as well...
,,Smooth and Easy,5.0,,The MRT in Singapore is super clean and could be as fast as taxis at rush hour or when it is raining. There is always a connection to a bus. Very similar to the MTR in Hong Kong. Well done Singapore
,,Well organised,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, spotless and completely safe this is the best rail network that I have ever been on. The network will take you any where in Singapore (including the airport). We used it regularly to get around the city. we traveled to Clarke Quay, Little India, Chinatown. It's inexpensive with most trips costing about $1.70 SGD. You buy a card (like the MYKI system in Melbourne only much more efficient) and can use these cards on all forms of public transport including buses. When you need to you can top them up by making additional deposits. Great fun and a great way to avoid the road traffic that exists throughout Singapore (especially around Orchard Road)."
,,Efficient and super easy to use,5.0,,"Great help from Staff. Purchased a couple of 2 Day tourist passes and had a great time seeing the sights of Singapore. All directions were very easy to understand. We particularly liked the instructions in the train tat completely describes the upcoming station, where the exits from the station were and the best way to exit to where you might be going. Eliminated much of the station confusion."
,,Excellent transport system. easy to get about.,5.0,,"Get the MRT top up card, this has a S$10 depoist refundable when you leave. Do not get the S$10 unlimite travel on your first day as you wont use much of it unless you are making several journeys on day one. Best to top up with card and use it as pay as you go. Take some cash with you."
,,Amazing transportation system,5.0,,"The SMRT is amazing. It's so efficient, easy to understand, clean and really affordable. If you're a tourist, I wouldn't bother buying a Tourist Pass and just purchase an EZ link card. It costs S$5 for the card which is non-refundable but you can top it up S$10 at a time and you just tap and go. There are boards in most stations with the fare details on if you want to know the cost in advance. Generally trips of 5-6 stops are less than a dollar though.

,,easy and cheap,5.0,,"buy a easylink card at the smrt cost for the card $5 we topped up to $20 used for 9 days,on buses and smrt.We have $7 left on card and is valid for 5years.When we go back we can redeem the card and get our $7 back ti is fantastic."

,,A delight to use,5.0,,"Very good value - buy a travel card for $12: $5 for the card, $7 stored value. The entry turnstile warns you when your balance is getting low. It is very, very easy to top up at one of the numerous machines.
Signage is clear, and in English. Rides vary in cost, but your balance is always shown both on the entry turnstile, and the exit.
Same card can be used on the wide-ranging bus services.
Stations are clean, well-lit and accessible (elevators everywhere!).
Station toilets are a delight - consistently clean and well maintained.
Staff members were unfailingly helpful, approaching me whenever I looked hesitant or unsure.
Platforms are sealed - it is impossible to access the tracks. Trains arrive, with carriage doors aligned to platform doors, so the only place you can go is on to the train.
As an older traveller, I was confident that even on the most crowded trains, someone would offer me a seat.
I wish the public transport system in my city was this good!"

Thank you"
,,Convenient,5.0,,"Its cheap, quick, convenient. Clean. Modern. The 3 day tourist pass is 20dollars plus 10dollar deposit"
,,Best Subway Yet!,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems is probably the best I've ever been on. It is clean, quick, and reasonably well maintained. The stations are for the most part pretty well thought out and posted with good signage to help people move from one train to another. There are a few stations that are a little more challenging due to the length of walking in between trains but if you just pay attention you will get to where you need to go. Also, there are a number of apps for your phone that will help you navigate the system and make the experience much easier. I take the MRT all over the place in Singapore and you can usually get within 500 meters of your final destination so you usually don't need to walk for more than 10 minutes after departure. If you are just visiting Singapore, don't be afraid to jump on the train system, it is quick, inexpensive, and keeps another car off of the road."
,,Best way to commute in Singapore,5.0,,"Fast, clean, not crowded, easy to understand way to commute in Singapore. Covers almost all major areas"
,,Best Metro,5.0,,"MRT near all Attractions MRT near all Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay,Botanic Gardens, Singapore Flyer, sentosa island"
,,Very Impressed Indeed!,5.0,,"My wife and I each had a Singapore Tourist Pass from our last visit in 2015. As we had topped up the balance previously rendering the cards to normal EZ-Link cards, their validity was extended until 2021.

As our hotel was located just above the MRT station, travelling on the trains was a handy and viable option for us during our Singapore vacation. The train service was prompt and efficient and wait times were negligible. The coaches were spick and span and well-maintained. We were touched by how often other younger passengers would voluntarily and graciously give up their seats for my wife and me. That we are grey-haired seniors must have been an obvious factor."
,,Very convenient,4.0,,Most MRT stations in Singapore are connected to a shopping mall so it is very easy to find.MRT can get very crowded starting from 5pm however.
,,Easy to Use - Well Signposted,5.0,,"Took the cab from the airport but after that switched to the MRT. It was very well sign posted everywhere, with signs on streets telling you how many meters in which direction to go. Machines made it very easy to get a ticket which you could pay per journey up to 6 times before getting a new ticket. We found it cheaper to do this than getting a tourist day pass. Also the returns are the cost of two singles so we always got singles in case our plans changed and we went somewhere else. Cheap, fast, clean and very easy to use."
,,A really nice mass transit system,4.0,,"We are from the country and have only gone on mass transit systems a few times. However, I would recommend that one in Singapore. One good reason is that taxi's become more expensive after 6 p.m. Like double. So the mass transit system saves you money especially on long trips. Purchasing a ticket at the machine is pretty easy and there was a SMRT person there to help. Plus the Singapore people are very helpful as well. We used it to get from the light show at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel back to our hotel. The price was only around 1.50 per ticket. Pricing depends on your start and destination, at least it did in our case. Transit lines are color coded and well marked. The trains are clean. People readily gave up their seats to elderly persons. We felt very safe during the whole journey. The trains ran frequently. I would recommend this mode of transportation."
,,Singapore MRT is the best,5.0,,We recently visited Singapore for 4 nights and purchased a 3day MRT tourist pass at Changi. Previously on our visits we have used taxis which are affordable. This time all our travel was done on train and buses which is great way to mix with the locals. All the timetables have frequent intervals and operate on time. A lot of the train stations connect directly with department stores and attractions. Would highly recommend this means of getting around Singapore.
,,I wish every place had this.,5.0,,"Clean, safe and easy to use. Covers the whole city. Used single ticket system, but tourist passes (unlimited riding) are available."
,,"Clean, easy to understand, efficient",4.0,,"The stations are easy to navigate. They are spotlessly clean (and so are the trains themselves). The trains are easy to navigate as well, because the user interface is great. I would say the only confusing thing is that the train lines are not named after their color."
,,First class transport system,5.0,,"Used the MRT system several times every day during our 8 day visit to Singapore including getting to and from the airport. Picked up a couple of EZ Link cards at the airport and did not use any taxis. The MRT is fast, cheap and efficient with good signage. There is no litter or graffiti on the trams or in and around the stations."
,,Awesomely Efficient,5.0,,"Third visit to Singapore and each time used the MRT extensively to get around all the sights including going all the way out to the war cemetery at Kranji and to the Changi museum.
Their tourist pass is exceptional value for money, regular trains which are clean and very efficient. What is of great importance is that all the stations are so well signed with colour coded lines so stress free in getting to your destination. If in any doubt always helpful staff on hand to assist."
,,Super convenient,5.0,,"You won't get lost as the signs are not misleading and not confusing. Officers on the stations are super helpful, too. I will definitely visit Singapore again!"
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, and affordable fair. They announce what time the train is arriving. Train is spacious and good for PWD. How I wish the MRT here in Philippines is as good as this."
,,Easy to use.,5.0,,I think recommend the US$14 3 day pass. This will include the bus from the airport and all public transport in Singapore unlimited. Singapore’s subway is very efficient and easy to use. Remember the pass is for calendar days.
,,Best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,Fell in love with Singapore MRT. the service and connectivity is really good. All you need is EZ card and you can roam whole Singapore. Inexpensive and best way to travel
,,Best public transport easy to follow directions,5.0,,Easy directions from airport to the city. Helpful staff. Maps are well designed. If you are a confident traveler or looking for a adventure then give it a go.
,,easy transport,5.0,,"we used the MRT to go from airport to hotel in Seranggon Road,stop at the Ferrer Park.Its easy to understand and used the card where we buy it from the counter Changi Recommed.Our family liked so much the Mrt becauce its fast way to move and no way to delays at all.MRT so clean and if you lose your way,just go and ask the staff ."
,,Airport-hotel,5.0,,I used the SMRT to go from the airport to my hotel in Orchard Rd. I liked the commute because it’s clean and a fast way to move. Definitely worth it.
,,Best Transit System,5.0,,"Easy accessibility from almost all leading hotels, Malls and Condominiums. Automated machines for taking tickets. No delays at all. Clean and swift service."
,,Simple,5.0,,"Took the MRT today and can say that it cannot be any easier. There are aids at every station so even if you cannot figure it out, someone is there to help you. The trains were clean and the noise is minimal. I recommend the MRT over a taxi since you are charged avg 25%+ during peak hours."
,,best,5.0,,its best i have ever traveled. you can go to every corner of Singapore with MRT and its very affordable.
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Easiest, cleanest train system I have yet encountered in my travels. We purchased the Tourist card for 2 days, which gave us unlimited travel on train and buses for S$16. Gets you pretty much anywhere in Singapore."
,,Best metro ever,5.0,,"It is really spacious, clean and clear! It was so quick and it is explained very well! You can buy tickets for days, we have stayed for 2 days and we bought the ticket for 2 days for $36 per adult ($10 is deposit)"
,,Very reliable,5.0,,MRT is very reliable and efficient way of transportation in Singapore. I used it more than 20 times and I have never waited more than 1-2 minutes for a train. It’s very clean and it has proper air conditioning system. Just remember that you shouldn’t eat or drink in the trains to avoid a ($500 fine!!!!).
,,An efficient mass transit system... both buses and trains,4.0,,We used the busses mainly but did also use the underground trains. The system is efficient and getting around is easy to navigate.
,,The MRT is great!,5.0,,"It’s clean, cheap, and always on time. I love it. It’s not an attraction in itself, but if you are visiting Singapore use it! You won’t be disappointed."
,,One of the most impressive MRT,5.0,,One of the most impressive MRT I have ever tried. It is super clean and really easy for tourists to get to any places in Singapore
,,Great transport,5.0,,What a great transport system. Runs on time and great value for money for tourists with the special passes.
,,Convenient and Economical,5.0,,"Based on TA Expert advice, I bought EZLink cards for the family. Card cost SGD12, with SGD5 non refundable and SGD7 value. For kids they issued a zero value card. I found its cheaper to use normal ezlink cards instead of tourist pass which costs SGD 30 for 3 days.
The got the tickets at Changi airport ticket counter located in a left side corner, near to T2 MRT station entry. I Used google maps and extensive direction boards for guidance on bus and MRT stations and routes to travel within Singapore.
I between, when the card value deteriorated, I uploaded value effortlessly in the nearby MRT station machines. Just check the card type as I had to use a different machine for my mastercard.
At the end of the trip I returned the card at airport counter and got the balance refunded in cash, along with the deactivated cards as souvenir."
,,Trips in MRT.,5.0,,The best Train system within the city. you can reach any part of Singapore by using it. always in perfect time. persons visiting Singapore must take a MRT pass which is used in train and Bus both. All stations have Map for stations/Areas etc.some MRT stations have good shopping area too.
,,user friendly for any first timer,5.0,,any first timer can easlity find the way around. relatively inexpensive to travel and undoubtedly the most convenient mode of transport.
,,Rapid transit Singapore,4.0,,Extremely economical & convenient way to get Changi Airport to town. Direct access from terminal 3. Complimentary shuttle between terminals. 25 min with one transfer across platform to my hotel. $ 2.35 S with 10 cents deposit. 3 day pass for $10 ($7.50 US) Not too crowded during lunch hr or after dark . Easy access to Orchard- Shopping districts & night spot . Safe & well kept
,,Easy to use and cheap,4.0,,"We managed to purchase a traveller pass, and also individual trip tickets from machines with no trouble and to plan trips with changes of track and find where to go with very little difficulty Staff were helpful and the trains come so often that you do not even need to worry about the timetable. (usually within 3 minutes there is another one coming)"
,,One of the most efficient and clean public transportation systems in the world,5.0,,"Singapore has one of the most efficient and clean public transportation systems in the world. The subway stations are state-of-the-art. The subways run frequently therefore are not very crowded most of the time. There are numerous bus routes and with the subways, can take one anywhere in Singapore. Finally the costs of riding public transportation are only nominal. One definitively gets value for the money."
,,Excellent means of transport,5.0,,"What a great way to get around, could travel anywhere with ease. Didn't know about purchasing a travel card and used single/return tickets which were not expensive at all."
,,Great transportation,5.0,,An inexpensive way to get around the city . A little confusing getting to the stations above ground but great underground
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"Did not take me long to work out how to use the MRT. The card called NETS flash pay cost $12.90 and you had $7 worth of travel. Very cheap travel. If you need to top up, easy to use the machines in the stations.
All stations have access to clean public toilets. The stations are very clean and there is no eating or drinking allowed in stations or on trains. They have several dark blue seats to be offered to elderly people and pregnant women or people with mobility issues. Very enjoyable trips."
,,clean and efficient,5.0,,"Take the trains they are on time, clean and safe to travel, Get a map it will help you to navigate the system much easier, very impressive"
,,Clean and easy to access metro,5.0,,"Easy to access and use way of transportation over Singapore. The metro ticket auto distributor is user friendly, and the ticket price are relatively cheap. Convenient for connecting your trips and visits in Singapore."
,,Wonderful. Cheap and with a Refund,5.0,,"Buy your visitor 2 or 3 day pass and ride a train that's exceptionally clean and driverless. It's fast underground rail at it's best. On top of the beautiful train, at the end of you using your pass. Hold onto the ticket and take it back to a SMRT office, and you will be handed back $10, making your SMRT pass vey cheap indeed."
,,Extensive reach and reasonable cost,4.0,,"If I were a tourist in Singapore, I would use the MRT because it enables one to easily access most tourist attractions in Singapore. There might be times when you need to combine the MRT with the bus, but this is usually easily done. Use Google map together with the MRT map which is available online. Google map is accurate most of the time but sometimes, it does not include MRT stations which are relatively new. The MRT website also enables you to work out the MRT route and the cost, so you know whether it's worth getting a tourist pass or to get a ticket for each trip instead. Try to avoid the peak hours and you will find that you normally can get seats if you board the end cabins of the train. It's true the trains are not so frequent during non-peak hours but the most you would wait is about 5-10 min."
,,Driverless trains and clean stations,5.0,,"Having visited many cities and tried many different city transports in my time, Singapore just has to be the best, cleanest and safest one by far. Stations and trains are just immaculate. The train lines are behind a glass wall so there is no draft from incoming/outgoing trains. Everything is signposted so well. Especially the tourist destinations. The 3 day tourist pass is a fantastic value- only 30 Singaporean dollars and you’ll get 10 back upon return of the pass. You can get it at any of the interchanging stations. Most of the trains are driverless which just adds to the great experience of the effortless travel."
,,"Quick, clean, safe and easy to use",5.0,,"A good way to navigate Singapore avoiding the heat and humidity; we got the three day tourist pass, $20 or so plus $10 deposit that you can get refunded. Not all stations sell them, check online - and the MRT app makes route planning easy."
,,Best Metro I’ve ever been on,5.0,,"The MRT is on time, clean, cheap and user friendly. At no point did I feel anything other than completely safe even in the middle of the night. It is by far the best city transport system I’ve ever been on."
,,"Efficient, but not the best",4.0,,"Singapore MRT is modern, airy, clean and vibrant. It makes your journeys comfortable as well.

But, compared to some other public transport systems in the world (viz. the London Underground), it lacks a bit.

For instance, the frequency: trains during non-peak hours may take 10 mins to arrive as opposed to max. 5-6 mins in London or some other cities. Also, the display systems in the trains sometimes display wrong information and sometimes don't even work which may confuse tourists.

As regards speed, it is a bit slower as well. Journey from central London to Heathrow takes approx. 1 hr by Tube as well as by taxi but in Singapore, time taken to travel to Changi from Orchard Road by MRT is double what the time taken by taxi is.

Connection-wise, Singapore MRT also doesn't fare good - lots of walking and some major stations like Orchard are confusing, with confusing signing. It lacks any historical connection, too, but that's not the reason why I gave Singapore MRT four bubbles out of five.

Some stations lack lift or escalators or ramps too, thus carrying baggage or for the disabled, it's a little difficult.

I am not publicising London Underground in this review, though I loved it truly. I'm just trying to point out some differences between the two systems that sadly many reviews don't mention here. SIngapore MRT is good, no doubt, but not the best.

Singapore Buses, run by 4 different companies (incl. SMRT) are better for commute - plus you get to see the city as well.

Of course, travel using Singapore MRT, it's a nice experience."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"The best way to commute to reach your destination and it's pocket friendly too.
It can be considered as one of the best metro service in the world.
The singapore metro is very well connected to all the fantastic locations in Singapore.
It is a highly recommended mode of transportation and it's family friendly too."
,,Excellent and efficient public transport system,5.0,,The MRT in Singapore is really great . If you purchase the Travellers card 2 days or 3 days it works out very cheap and convenient to use both in underground and also in buses. The trains are mostly driver less and move efficiently . The directions and signs are quite good but London metro are the benchmark . Overall excellent .
,,One of the best public transport systems,4.0,,"Clean, well ordered not pushing and shoving. One of my favourite public transit systems. And really cheap too."
,,Clean,5.0,,"The MRT is the cleanest and quiet atmosphere I’ve ever seen. There is not a rubbishy bin insight. And large fines if you eat and drink.

The trains and maps available are very easy to navigate. Because if the heat I’m guessing many people travel from MRT to shopping centre without venturing out in the heat.

The trains are driverless. Heaps of fun. Get yourself a pass and you get your $10 back when you finish"
,,"cheap, clean, easy to use",5.0,,"probably the best way to get around Singapore.
The maps are easy to navigate at the station and the ticket buying process probably the easiest I've seen anywhere. You can buy a very cheap tourist pass for 1-3 days.
You can check your progress in each carriage and it feels ridiculously safe - no one is looking at you, they are too busy looking at their phones"
,,Easy to use and clean!,5.0,,We loved using SMRT on our trip to Singapore! It is a very easy system to use that gets you all over town. The system is incredibly clean and on time. We used it all the time for the week we were here!
,,So easy and safe,4.0,,"It is really an easy way to visit Singapore. You can take a tourist pass or like me just ticket and top-up reload as needed And absorb all, it is clean,safe and rapid ! Just use it"
,,MRT is Awesome,5.0,,"My family had a lovely experience usi g MRT.
We had purchased the MRT pass at Airport itself. MRT is free for children below the age of 7. To begin we took MRT at Airport to Hotel, where in we had to actually change our train at 3 stations, but it was very easy even with Kid and Luggage.

We used MRT for most of our travel across Singapore. We had lovely experience using it."
,,The best rapid transit system in the world,5.0,,"Cheap, efficient, frequent, clean, well signed, orderly queuing. An impressive MRT that cleverly dovetails trains and buses in hubs like Bishan where I stayed. Try get to the front of a driverless train and experience what it must be like to be a driver."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,Once you get the hang of the ticketing system and how to do line connections it’s a great way to get around the city.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Great and easy to use! Do buy a three day travellers tourist card. You can cash them back in and they pay u back unused fares! Well worth it!
,,"Dependable, clean, affordable, ease of access",5.0,,It was really easy to figure out the routes of our daily travel. We depended much on the mrt for our 2 week visit. Highly recommend.
,,High performance and driverless,4.0,,"Very frequent service; great for moving round the city. All stations we saw had elevators.
Takes a long time to the airport with a change to airport shuttle
Ticketing not really suited to visitors. We each now have a pass 5 sgd and about 10sgd credit, useful only when and if we return"
,,Clean & Clear,4.0,,"This mass transportation is very useful if you a solo or duo traveller since will be cheaper comparing with online cab, all the instructions also very clear and the station itself also quite well maintained"
,,Cleanest mrt facilities!,5.0,,"Very clean, cheap transportation, easy to understand, very safe from crime, cheap ticket also.. almost got a ticket office in every stop. You can top up your card ballance by your self and the machine was very user friendly."
,,Life Saver,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is perhaps one of the best that I have seen in approx 30 countries that I have been to so far. They are efficient and trustworthy when it comes to take you froin point A to B.

I have been to this beautiful country so many times and have travelled on the MRT so much that I decided to keep a pre-loaded Card just make sure my nest travel is hassel free."
,,The best public transport,5.0,,"Singapore’s public transport continues to grow. It’s quick, very clean and efficient. It is also very cheap, the fare from the airport to downtown is less than S$2 and quicker than a taxi."
,,Nice ride thru peak hours,5.0,,"I took the MRT from meeting point to dinner
It’s a very convenient way to travel during peak off work hours between 6-7pm of the day.

It’s totally comfortable without the normal crowded compact MRT ride in other country

Lovely to try this out when in Singapore!"
,,"Wonderful mass transit! Clean, cheap and reliable!",5.0,,"Singapore's Mass Transit system is one of the very best--the best system I have used. The prices are cheap, the locations are great and it is highly reliable."
,,Easy for tourists,4.0,,"Really easy way to get around the country, especially for people who are new to Singapore and don't know their way around.
My only real complaint is that the air conditioning can be far too cold during off peak times when there are few people on the trains."
,,"Safe, easy and fast way to commute!",5.0,,"The staff at stations are very helpful, price is on an acceptable level, trains are up to date and it is a fast way to commute in Singapore!"
,,Good system for good price,5.0,,"Unless you plan to use the MRT 5 or more times in day, do not buy the Tourist Pass. Just get the single trip ticket which can be reused up to 6 times over 6 days by adding individual trips to the ticket each time and paying at the machine as you need. The low, low 10 cent cost of this ticket is refunded to you on the 3rd trip with another 10 cent discount on the 6th trip (within 6 days). The only weird part was that it only took $1, $2 and $5 bills. The system map is a bit of a maze."
,,Awesome,5.0,,"I've always found it better to travel around Singapore via the SMRT compared to buses. Don't get me wrong, the buses are waaay efficient, too! It's just that the trains are faster and estimated travel times are usually accurate if not always!"
,,Best way to get around Singapore as a tourist,5.0,,"This is the only way we get around Singapore when visiting and a lot cheaper then taxis.
Trains always come between 3-5 mins so you never have to wait long and the train network is very easy to navigate around.
Very fast, reliable and one of the cheapest in the world."
,,"Fast, Easy and Air Conditioned",5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is THE way to get around the city. Buy a pass, load it up and off you go. Not every station sells the passes but the larger ones do. Maps and directions within the stations are good. Rush hours mean crowded trains, but weekdays between 9am and 4pm are relatively uncrowded."
,,Brilliant Service,5.0,,"Would have to be one of the best public transport systems in the world. Fast, efficient , and spotlessly clean, and combined with a three day Tourist Pass is a great way to get around the Island."
,,Puts the London Tube to shame!,5.0,,Do the trains arrive on time? Yes! Are they clean? Yes! Are they cool and airy? Yes Are they noisy or crowded? No! Is there any graffiti or rubbish? No! What more can you say about it? Just a super efficient service and pleasureable experience!
,,Excellent way to get around Singapore,5.0,,My wife and I purchased 3 day tourist passes that gave access throughout the MRT network. The stations were clean and the trains ran regularly. A great way to get around Singapore.
,,Comfortable,5.0,,It's a really nice transportation that you can use in Singapore. It's easy to understand the route and the train is very fast. We don't need to wait for a long time for the train.
,,Superb way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The underground railway in Singapore is much like the London underground but the difference is plain to see. The stations and trains were immaculate inside and out. So easy to get a ticket and find your way around, I would recommend getting the App on your smart phone as this is an easy way to plan your route."
,,"Comfortable, Efficient, and Always on Time!",5.0,,"I've always found it better to travel around Singapore via the SMRT compared to buses. Don't get me wrong, the buses are waaay efficient, too! It's just that the trains are faster and estimated travel times are usually accurate if not always!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"There trains are so clean no food or drink is allowed, no graffiti. So cheap well signed you could never get lost its a credit to Singapore."
,,Great and cheap,5.0,,"Easy to get around if you have a map in hand... also get the debit card for all busses , etc . Can buy at all 7-11's"
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,"Took the M from the airport to the downtown Singapore. The system almost seems intuitive and is also well signed. This is the first Asian city that I was able to use transit exclusively to get everywhere in the city and from the airport.

The cost of fares were quite reasonable compared to many other cities. The city is very safe and if you get turned around the transit staff are actually quite helpful."
,,The Best Metro In The World!,5.0,,"You just can't say enough good things about the Singapore public transportation system. You can buy a smart card for $10 Singapore (cash) and then add to it at any metro station (credit cards accepted). The card works on all public transport. We used the buses and trains extensively and loved it. You can go anywhere for very little money. On top of that the trains and buses are immaculate! Stations are announced in three languages, including English. Even the rest rooms are clean at the stations!"
,,Quick and easy to use,4.0,,"Quick and easy access via the SMRT to Singapore's numerous areas - each with a different culture, experience and feel. Tickets were easy to get, based on a map system or simple lookup of your station, in english and other languages if needed. There are a number of coloured lines/routes to choose from, each interconnecting with the other so manoeuvring around works well. Cost was cheap cheap, trains were quick, efficient and clean. Also easily wheelchair accessible with nearby lifts. (WARNING The escalators are really fast and steep, so hold on). Only once was it crowded (rush hour) and even then we got seats. There is always someone on hand to help - one of the tickets wiped its magnetic strip, and they simply rescanned and away we went. NOTE that the stations are all close together (some only a block from each other, but on a different line) so check a street map overlayed with stations to see which will work best for you. Also there are shopping centres everywhere. you may find you need to walk from one side to the other, or underground tunnel to reach desired station or destination. If in doubt just ask someone - easy!"

They are always on time, highly efficient, safe, comfortable and very clean. The staff are very well trained and very compassionate to travelers. There are couple of apps like SG buses which make the navigation seamless and enjoyable. With the SMRT card, each commute is so cheap and affordable. I always use and prefer this mode of transport for commuting in Singapore."
,,Beat transit system!,5.0,,"I have used public transport in numerous countries and this has to be one of the best I have experienced. Very easy to navigate, super safe platforms and very clean. Wish we had spent more on the MET and less on Grab cars :-)"

,,Makes it easy to criss cross the island,5.0,,"Comfortable and quick with regular service to major points around the island. Important to have a system map and an island map to quickly understand where you need to be going. If you're going to be there for multiple days, best to get a pay as you go card that you can top up should you need to. My 5 year old wanted to keep mine (they come in many designs) for a souvenir."

,,Great Public Transportation,4.0,,"Very clean and efficient transit system. Be sure to down load the SGMRT app for your smart phone to know your route. The system is very busy it can be used offline. Make sure you have small bills to purchase tickets, they can be broken down into small bills but this adds time."
,,"Fast, reliable and cheap (for the most part)",4.0,,"If you are looking for a cost-effective way to cover large distances and travel around different parts of the city, you can't beat Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system.

Coverage has expanded rapidly over the years such that almost every area of the island is accessible. Prices are reasonable - for longer stays, be sure to purchase an EZ-Link card from any of the counters to make transport less of a hassle."
,,Singapore Mass Transport,5.0,,"Having travelled on most underground mass transport(London.New York,Moscow,Sydney) I find that Singapore Mass Transport to be far and away the best, Clean,on time,fast, and a great variety of stations. Admittedly it is the newest and would be a great plan for future undergrounds."
,,Great public transport system,5.0,,"So easy to use SMRT, clean fast and efficient service & with further major track and train improvements planned over next few years, this will be simply superb!"
,,Great value fantastic service,5.0,,I was really impressed with the transport in Singapore with nice clean stations and easy street to station access.

The tickets are very reasonably priced and the lines allow access to all the main parts of Singapore needed with ease

,,Fine,5.0,,"Not sure why this is being reviewed as a thing to do in Singapore, it’s just transportation. It’s good. It just works. Tourist pass is good, but only certain stations sell."
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"This would be the best mrt service I’ve come across, clean, efficient and cheap! If visiting Singapore don’t bother with anything else, grab a pass and it’ll take you everywhere. I even used it on my return to the airport with my bags no problem at all"
,,Fantastic train service,5.0,,"We have just spent 10 days in Singapore. We used the SMRT every day. The trains and stations are always clean and manageable. Signage is excellent. We got a seniors pass, each trip cost around 80cents max. You can get almost anywhere in Singapore by train.
You can redeem the balance from your pass at the station kiosk before you leave Singapore."
,,So easy to get around the city!,5.0,,"It is so easy to get around the city with the MRT system. I usually don't have a lot of extra down time while in Singapore, but when I do get a half day or so, I can almost always get where I need to go with the MRT - and it's very easy to use. About the only suggestion I'd make would be to have an express train from Chang Yi airport to downtown (Orchard Road) area."
,,quick and efficient mode of transportation,5.0,,"The best network of travel in Singapore, quick, reliable, efficient and inexpensive mode of travelling all over in Singapore, Very easy to understand the routes and high frequency of the trains. Highly recommended"
,,“I am not a lemming...”,5.0,,"The MRT is also known as the Singapore railway and buses. I only traveled on the train. It is cheaper to buy a pass than a daily ticket. The lines are colour coded and easy to follow.

However at peak times there is a sea of humanity traveling down the escalators and going to their various trains. Once you get in the crowd you seemed to just get dragged along.

It is hard to get used to lining up not only behind a line but also behind a poly door. The trains are air-conditioned, crowded and quick. A lot of people use the MRT. Don’t worry about trying to get a seat. A bit like winning the lottery!

Once you work out where you want to go it is a great way to travel. Mostly underground.

You can also catch the train to the Changi airport."
,,Very efficient way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"We used the MRT to go a few places during our quick trip to Singapore, and we were very happy with the service. Went from our hotel downtown to China Town, then later to the Harbour, worked well."
,,Efficient!,5.0,,"Like most things in Singapore the mass transit system is so easy to use and they operate a cashless card system that you may also use for small purchases around the city.

Trains are clean, well maintained and run on time. As you would expect in Singapore there is no eating, drinking, smoking or gum chewing permitted anywhere on the transit system."
,,Much Cheaper and convenient for travelling,5.0,,"As compare to taxi in Singapore, SMRT is more better option for travelling. There is a SMRT train in every 4-5 minutes, so its quite fast and easy for travelling. Its easy to use and comfortable for travelling from one point to another."
,,MRT efficient and clean and cheap,5.0,,"The MRT was great. Signposted clearly. There is a voice on the MRT in English to let you know the next stop. There is a clear sign on board that lights up at each stop. People are courteous. No one eats or drinks on the MRT. The locations make it easy to visit the attractions. Changing to another line is quite straightforward, lots of signs to lead you and the colour coding is simple and easy to understand, Noticed signs in Chinese, Thai? and of course, english. I must mention the cost. You can purchase an EZ-link card for $12SGD The card amount is not refundable but the extra money on the card- I think $7- is used for trips- any left at the end of your trip can be refunded at the MRT station. We could top up easily $10SGD at a time. We also used the card to pay for the Zoo shuttle from the Mandai? station.I think it was $1SGD 1 way to the zoo. Excellent value. The card is valid for 5 years so I held on to my card so I have to go back!!"
,,Mrt,4.0,,Reliable great way to travel around Singapore always on time very clean and very affordable especially compared to other mass transportation systems
,,Great product,5.0,,"The SMRT is a fantastic service in Singapore.

Many countries (including australia) could learn a lot from this service that ferries 10s of thousands around the city daily.

The value to commuters is astronomical. You would be bonkers if you didn't utilise the SMRT service whilst in Singapore.
With services going mostly every 5 to 10 minutes. Missing a train won't mean you will be 30min late like in other countries."
,,Superb service,4.0,,"As tourists, we found payment a mite difficult. The machine would not accept a $10 bill, and we had to walk to the other end of the concourse to the ticket booking office to get change. The booking office wouldn't sell us tickets, just gave us the change and asked us to use the machine."
,,EFFICIENT TRAIN,5.0,,Easy to navigate and very friendly staff. they will help you how to get to one place to another. Map has English translation so it will be easy for tourist. buy prepaid train ticket to avoid long lines during rush hour
,,Convenient travel to downtown,4.0,,"I use the SMRT to travel to downtown and find it pretty convenient. Some stations are connected via shopping mall below ground like City Hall station connects you to the Suntec expo without having to walk on ground level.
The only risk is sometimes the train will delay but you can always check on their mobile app or at the station."
,,A great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has an extensive MRT system which is by far the easiest way for visitors to get around. Trains are every few minutes and the system is easy to navigate. Get an Easy-Link card at any MRT station - you can also use the card on buses and, as payment is determined by distance travelled rather than by individual mode of transport, using a bus before or after the MRT is only a slight add on in price!"

,,Singapore MRT is a MUST,5.0,,"Yes, it is the fastest and easiest way to get around Singapore. Comfortable and clean, with clear indications and very helpful employees.

,,Daily trips on the MRT,5.0,,"I love taking the MRT everywhere because it is so convenient. One can literally go anywhere round the whole island. Some of the MRT stations are beautiful works of architecture for example, Bras Basah MRT station and Stadium MRT station. There are even art and paintings on some of the walls.

,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"As someone who have taken the mrt/subway/metro in a dozen of other countries I can conclude that Singapore Mrt is in the top 3 position in terms of realiability, efficiency, cleanliness. Although In recent years cases of train breakdown and service delay had happened quite frequently but it is understandable due to the aging train system that have been working everyday serving millions of commuters daily since 1987. I believe the train operator is looking into the issues and will solve it as soon as they can. Train breakdown and delays are not uncommon in some major cities in other countries."
,,Excellent Rapid Transport System,5.0,,A very fast and efficient way to get around Singapore. If you are a tourist you can get an unlimited pass that allows you to use the bus and train (MRT) system. The pass can be purchased from certain MRT stations. Make sure you have your passport that contains the visa given at the airport since it is only available to tourists. I believe the pass is around $13 SGD per day.

,,Travelling,5.0,,Using the MRT is so easy and convenient. Top-up card is very user friendly and easy to use. You can travel almost anywhere.
,,POOR POOR POOR,2.0,,"The Singapore MRT was initially built 30 years ago in the first Line called the East-West line linking residence in East with the industrial West.

It is sad as I compare this with my experiences in Hong Kong, Beijing, London and Bangkok.

Depending on where you land in Singapore, the train station is in Terminal 2 and all other terminal will have to take a feeder bus to terminal 2. this can take 15-20min. The train from Singapore Airport to city will take your 1.5 hours as opposed to 30-40 min in HK and 45 min in Bangkok. This is due to the train having to be changed at one station - tenah Merah - then the commuter hopping on to the normal LINE with all Singaporeans to ''crawl'' over 10-12 stations/stop to reach City. Imagine this with your luggages because the train has NO luggage area as opposed to Hong Kong and the train may already be filled depending on whether it is peak hour. However, if you can go through this - you will pay a fare about S$2 as opposed to HK$90 for a 3 stop journey in Hong Kong.

With the increase in population from 4M to the present 6M, the train system has deteriorated over the years due to a lack of repairs and maintenance and also a clear lack of funding to do this as more LINES are added to the rail network. I am told that:
a. Majority of Singapore track are above land - thus with humidity more maintenance was needed. This was regrettably not done well and we had constant breakdown.
b. The Singapore trains are 10-12 carriages and the number of train carriages have been retained for all Singapore LINES. Doors in stations are also designed around this.Because of this, the original train was designed for a population of 4m but this is now 7m.
c. The trains carriages cannot be increased due to design of stations.
d. The solution was to increase the frequency of trains. But sadly Singapore train frequency are lacking.
e. Over capacity also cause breakdowns more often.
f. Breakdown will result in greater operational cost. Elevators leading to train stations breakdown frequently and usually only repaired after 1 month as opposed to 2 days in HK and Beijing and Bkk.
g. In some trains, the air condition is seriously lacking or switch off in alternative carriages during off peak hours.

Trains are now jammed shoulder to shoulder during peak period. At interchanges - Jurong, Raffles, Doby Gaut, Bouna Vista, the crowds are humongous. Avoid peak hour - 8 to 9am and 530-8pm on weekdays.

Train connection are not as effective in Singapore because of the geographical spread of Singapore where estates are spaced out. Getting on a train will also require you to walk over long distances to reach your destination. So start your journey early and prepare to perspire in the humidity of Singapore. But please do it in off peak hours."
,,Advice to Tourists. The BEST way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"Use of public transport (buses n trains) is highly recommended for all visitors esp budget conscious travellers.

Like most subways, Singapore's MRT system is colour coded plus each line has an alpha code with each station having number ID. For example the East West line is 'EW' and Tampines Ststion's code is 'EW2'.

MRT system maps are available and easy to read.

Note - when transferring from one line to another at specific MRT stations the distance to walk can be quite long eg 1 klm. However these underground tunnel corridors are air conditioned and most have retail shops, eateries and convenience stores. An underground oasis. Some even have travelators ie moving walk ways.

All trains and buses are air conditoned - must for Singapore. Plus trains and buses are spotlessly clean. No graffiti. Fantastic!

Of course, travelling in peak times should be avoided as there are crowds. Non peak times, MRT (mass rapid transport - train) and buses are exceptional travel options.

Train carriages have few seats. They are definitely designed for mass commuter traffic. There are specific seats for older and passengers in need. People do stand / offer these seats.

In peak times, trains are every 2 minutes. In non peak, every 4-6 minutes. TV and electronic monitors around station precinct will provide timing information.

Stations have electronically controlled protection safety barriers. Underground stations are air conditioned. Above ground starions have several giant fans providing comfortable air flow while waiting.

Seating at platforms can be limited but you're not waiting for a long period between trains.

Many of Singapore's newest MRT stations are unique architectural designed. Quite extraordinary really. For example, Singapore's Stadium MRT Station is a must visit for lovers of architectural geometric symmetry.

On the newer lines, trains are driverless.

More Tips for tourists and visitors. Singapore's MRT trains and buses are a fabulous way to see Singapore. Many of the lines are above ground or only partially underground, so trains are a very low coast to get a visual perspective of Singapore. Great way to get a perspective on Singapore's 'heartland'.

The hop-on hop-off tourists buses are terrific (and way more expensive) for tourists however i also recommend the SMRT buses.

I often take a mystery bus tour. I just jump on a bus and go to the end. Alight, walk around, eat at local shops and return on a following bus. Often these 2-3 hour excursions will cost less than S$6. And if i have been lucky to get a double decker bus and even luckier still an upstairs seat at the front of the bus then i get fabulous views of the 'Garden City'.

Buy the MRT card. First time min cost of $12, with $7 in fare value. Card can then topped up at any MRT train station using cash via the many ticket machines. Ideal for visiting folk planning several days in Singapore.

Singapore MRT & Buses are a tap on / tap off service. Simple. Fares are very, very reasonable and based on distance travelled and / or express service (later applies to buses only. There are no express trains. Trains are all stops). Therefore if you connect to multiple services in the one journey, fares for the 2nd, 3rd legs (etc) are very low - often just cents.

Many of Singapore's most popular bus stops have electronic indicator boards that show bus arrival times for each bus number. Plus board indicates bus' seating capacity ie green colour means seats available, yellow means a few seats available and red means standing only.

SMRT also has a free App - SBS Transit. Easy to follow and very useful to confirm next bus arrival.

Take a MRT or bus to Changi Village or Bedok or Jurong or Woodlands (almost extreme ends of the Island). Alight and walk around the malls, the wet markets, the streets and environments. Highly Recommended.

Singapore is not just Orchard Road or Little India or Chinatown or Clarke Quay or City Hall or Raffles Hotel or Arab Street. These places are fantastic but try visiting Singapore's heartland districts too. A walk around the 'wet' markets and local hawker villages are amazing.

Recommended double decker bus routes

# 2 Kampong Bahru to Changi Village
# 168 Bedok (bus interchange station) to Woodlands
# 518 Express. Route is a loop service starting and finishing at Pasir Ris. Though you can start at any stop. This service travels along Orchard Road (from Scotts Rd - near Marriot n Hyatt hotels)
# 23 - another loop service that travels down Serangoon Rd, the heart of Little India

These routes are 20+ klms long each. More than 1 hour.

Happy travels on Singapore's world class public transport network."
,,It goes everywhere.,5.0,,Excellent system. All travel indicators easy to follow. The safety of trains and platforms is exceptional. And the cleanliness is 100 per cent.
,,"MRT - Local Connectivity for All - fast, efficient and pleasant ride !",5.0,,"To ride on MRT in our city state transport system has always been on the right track.

Any commuter can always make their own opinion, talk about it and perceive individually. I can say and put on record that we have one of the best MRT system to proud of.

Well managed, efficiently on the inter-hub connection and time management."
,,The MRT is a Must in Singapore,5.0,,"Getting around Singapore is made simple when using the MRT. We brought our tickets upon arrival at Changi and returned our cards when we left the country post a long weekend stay. We travelled to our hotel and to various attractions by MRT and had vary little difficulty navigating the different lines and changeover points. When we did appear to be poring over our MRT map, friendly Singaporeans (I think) came to our aid with suggestions."
,,Clean and efficient,4.0,,Super clean and efficient mode of transport. Avoid peak hours morning 8-10 am and evening 6-8pm to enjoy a comfortable ride.
,,Fastest way to travel,5.0,,Other than taxi and online cab. This is the utmost convenient way to travel in Singapore. Just check through google maps which is the nearest station to stop by
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,Good connection and accessibility and integrated with othet modes and enntry/ exit with inportant places and changeover facility
,,"Excellent service, amazing experience, Best way to see Singapore",4.0,,"Singapore is undoubtedly one of the best cities on only in Asia however in the World.
A well planned and well managed, one of the aspects that make it so brilliant is there public transport. With the MRT and the bus services entire Singapore is very well connected, due to which the congestion on the roads has been reduced in turn that has also saved on carbon footprints.
As a tourist to this country I would recommend that one should buy a 3 days tourist pass for 20 SGD with 10 SGD as refundable security deposit once u return the pass before leaving the country.
It is readily available at major interconnecting MRT stations, also on the Changi Airport. Moreover, you can buy fro one station and return the pass to any other station or even airport, it is not necessary to go to the same station for returning the pass and take back your SGD 10 security deposit.
With this pass u r entitled for unlimited rides on all the MRT and bus routes except the premier ones such as monorail of sentosa island, however that does not make much of a difference. You will save lot of your travelling cost however you will simultaneously need the help of Google maps to identify the MRT station for boarding and getting down to reach your destination or the bus number from your location to your destination. For travelling thru public transport, this is a basic requirement. You can also download the MRT map from their official website or get it free from the MRT customer services office on all the stations.
This is not recommended for persons who are weak in directions or not willing to walk at all, since u will have to walk or spend on taxis to reach to nearest MRT station or a bus stop.
Thumbs up for MRT."
,,Pleasant MRT rides in Singapore,4.0,,Singapore mrt network is very efficiently run and well connection with occasional technical breakdowns. Clean and well maintained. People queue up to enter train after waiting for passengers to exit
,,EASY. AFFORDABLE. Gateway to everything else.,5.0,,"If there is any place in the world where one can enjoy public transport, it has to be in Singapore. The MRT allowed us to access more areas of Singapore than our previous visits when we relied heavily on cabs and grabs. If you are just paying for a standard ticket, keep it after your first use - you can recycle it and use it 5 more times. Also happy to discover that our MRT NETS cards which we bought in 2015 still were valid after 3 years! Pretty handy if you see yourself traveling frequently to the Lion City."
,,Singapore public transportation,5.0,,Singapore has an very efficient public transportation network. Local and foreign alike the system is one of the easiest to use and navigate in the world. Tourists can purchase a pass suitable to their use and duration. The e-link card can ride on mrt and public buses. Several APPs are available for you to download to help you with where you want to go. Trains and buses are clean and not crowded except during rush hours. For tourists I suggest you avoid going out during rush hours. Maps are available on most stations and on the trains. The cost of each ride is depending on the distance you travelled.

WOW how wrong we are
What a great simple clean efficient transport system this is
Having no idea what to do all the transport staff we spoke with were incredibly helpful

,,Terrific,5.0,,I found this system to be fantastic. Easy to navigate and clear instructions given by the announcers. Maps are clear. Volunteers on some stations to guide you. I live in Australia it’s a shame our transport system isn’t this great. I would definitely travel on this system again. My only issue we were advised to buy a card called nets flash pay for our travels which was good but you can only top it up in $10.00 increments.
,,Singapores MRT is excellent!,5.0,,"One of the best in the world. The MRT is very easy to comprehend and negotiate, very regular and above all, clean! Don't eat or drink on board as there are fines."

,,Just The Best Urban Rail Service,5.0,,"We used this service about a year ago and again on our recent trip to Singapore in October 2018. Whilst we have used this service many times over the past few years, we continue to be amazed at just how efficient and effective the SMRT really is. Getting from Terminal 2 at Changi Airport to our hotel near Lavender station was faster than we could do it by taxi, and at $S4.80 for my wife and I, at a fraction of the cost of taxi travel.
We cannot recommend the SMRT highly enough - It is simply a brilliant service, and one that many other cities around the world could learn from."

,,Easy and Convenient Way to Explore Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system is an easy and convenient way to explore the Lion City. The announcements regarding routes and stations are in English in addition to the other national languages of Singapore. The electronic signs on the trains ensure that you can keep track of where you are and when your stop is coming up. Although the MRT may not reach each every nook and cranny of Singapore, it will take you to almost any place you wish to visit. The reasonably priced Singapore MRT Tourism card provides you with unlimited travel on the system for the number of days you purchase (1, 2, or 3 days). The trains were clean and relatively uncrowded except at commute times. Moreover, they ran so frequently that I would start becoming impatient after waiting just 3 or 4 minutes. Unlike BART in the San Francisco Bay Area, I felt safe traveling on the MRT even late at night. I highly recommend using the MRT when you visit Singapore."
,,Rapid transport,5.0,,"Was very scepticle about using a rail system I knew nothing about .. WRONG ... it’s fantastic .. brought the travel card, loaded some $’s on it and we were off. You can travel anywhere. Get a map of the underground rail lines, it’s colour coded for convenience, plan your trip and your off. It is fast, clean, prompt and extremely easy to get around. Peak time was a bit crushy, as thousands of locals use the MRT to commute to and from work. I walk with a stick and found most times, someone stood to allow me to sit down. Well done Singapore for a fantastic mode of transport."
,,Incredible,5.0,,What a clean and efficient service. All you need is a tourist card $20'for 3 days unlimited transport and the city is your own! Enjoy
,,Very Efficient,5.0,,"We used the SMRT on 5 occasions whilst we were in Singapore and found it very efficient. Rather than buy a re-loadable card we found that you could buy a single use ticket which could be re-loaded and used for up to 6 journeys. This was ideal for us for the number of journeys we were going to make combined with the fact that you have to pay a non refundable deposit for the re-loadable card. The single tickets do cost more but, for us, they worked out cheaper overall."
,,Easy to use and will take you anywhere in Singapore,5.0,,"Used the MRT to visit many attractions while we were staying in Singapore.It is easy to use ,inexpensive and extremely clean and it enables you to visit the tourist attractions without having to use an organised tour ,giving you as much time as you would like there .Above all ,it is very safe to use."

,,It is fast and everywhere!,4.0,,"I use it every time I am in SIngapore. The SMRT is fast, affordable and easy to use. You may need to change the lines but you will cross SIngapore frequently on your demand. Please observe that the stations and trains might be crowded at peak times and watch out for hidden steps and obstacles! Once you discover how notice them life is much easier. My wife is disabled and walks slow. We had difficulties in crashing through the crowds and using the lift (the latter was often occupied by young people)."
,,No Octopus or Opal type card.,4.0,,"As a tourist it was disappointing not to have the option of getting a Pay as you go card like the one in Hong Kong. Instead one has to get a 1, 2 or 3 day pass $ 20 , $26 or $ 30 or face the hassle of paying for every trip separately."

,,always efficient,5.0,,most well connected network that I have seen. Reduces travel time and money and energy. Singapore Tourist pass is a Great program
,,Extremely convenient form of public transport,5.0,,Travelling on the MRT is extremely convenient. The MRT connects most of the city and the trains are quite frequent. Purchase a travel card if you intend to undertake multiple journeys. It saves you the hassle of buying tickets at the machine. The only thing to keep in mind is the last MRT is anywhere between 11.30PM - 12.15AM depending on the route and the station. Check the timings carefully if you intend to stay out late.
,,"Clean,cheap,easy",5.0,,"This transport system is another example of the intelligence and thought put into so much of Singapore's environment. We used it everyday. People are there to help. It is so well run,so clear,so clean, so user friendly."

,,Connectivity at the best,5.0,,SMRT I felt always on time and well connected across the length and breadth of Beautiful Singapore. Hats off
,,Shouldn’t all public transport be like this,4.0,,"The MRT is super efficient, clean, safe and easy to use... Stations are conveniently located in most of the most popular areas and typically accessed by a cool air conditioned shampooing mall. The trains are incredibly clean - and ban eating food - they have cool air conditioning which always seems to work. Lots of other cities could learn a thing or two from the MRT!"
,,Reliable,4.0,,"A very reliable service. Always on time, and frequent as well. Clean. Fairly cheap mode of transport, considering it is Singapore. If needing to change from one line to another, just be aware that you may need to walk quite a distance."
,,A smrt way to travel.,5.0,,Clean and regular service. Singaporeans are so courteous. There are signs asking travellers to give up their seats for those in need. I'm not that old but I was often offered a seat by millennials. Unheard of in Australia.
,,Didnt even try it!,1.0,,"What kind of a review is this you may ask? Well we tried one night with the family. It was like an expedition to try and find the ticket office alone in the bowels of Somerset which is just off Orchard drive. It was so packed with people and clostrophobic, that after the automated ticket machine told me it was going to be $6.70 to go two stops and we still didn’t know how far the train was, then we had a ten minute walk from Clarke’s quay. We gave up and decided to continue with taxi transport, when we eventually found our way out we did have to wait for a taxi, it was very busy, but we then went direct to our door for 7 bucks, we stuck to taxis after that. Therefore that’s my recommendation, I’m sur the MRT may well be ok, but it strikes me you have to be very familiar with it and even then if there’s more than a couple of you taxis appear cheaper, more direct and much easier to get around in."
,,Frequent services to any part of the city,5.0,,Using the SMRT is a really good way to travel around Singapore. The air conditioning and escalators at every station help to avoid fatigue
,,Best Transportation,4.0,,"Amazingly well organized, easy to learn to go around. Try it out. You just need a basic card, add some money on it and get going. From the city to sentosa, to botanical garden to marina."
,,Amazingly clean and easy to ysr,5.0,,"If you are only in town for a few days it’s worth getting a tourist pass (STP). Impressed by how clean the underground rail is, everyone is polite and it’s all very efficient and beautifully executed. Makes for a stark comparison to other underground systems, which are moderately whiffy by comparison. Has the added bonus of air conditioning when you need to escape Singapore’s oppressive humidity."
,,Ecellent!,5.0,,This is the ONLY way to get around Singapore. It is so cheap and so easy and the trains are every so many minutes. I always felt a bit wary of public transport in other countries but this was fantastic even at night I felt very safe.
,,Excellent transit system well above U.S. and European standard,5.0,,SMRT is the best transit system I have ever experienced. Not only is the frequency of subways and busses very good (your wait the most a few minutes for the next ride) but all the vehicles and stations are niceley air-conditioned which is a blessing in hot and humid Singapore. Carriages and stations are spotless clean. The embarking and disembarking process is like in Beitain in the old days and very disciplined. The overall coverage is also great and it is easy to get to all main attractions in the city. The network plan and time tables are easy to understand and the rides are cheap on top of that. Highly recommended.
,,Excellent service !,4.0,,"Coming from the UK, we’re used to subway systems - but this is another level ! Super clean, modern and easy to understand it is probably the best way to travel around Sing - it’s certainly the cheapest ! Trains run every few minutes and very punctual."
,,Visa beware but excellent for getting around,5.0,,"One thing to note is that though this is brilliant for getting around don’t try and buy your three day tourist pass with a Visa card. They won’t touch visa at any ticket office. We ended up having to draw cash with our Visa card from atm to get tickets.
Three day pass is listed at S$20 but you have to pay S$ 10 deposit which you get back when you return it."
,,Excellent Metro system,5.0,,"This excellent Metro system will get you to most places at a very low cost. New, clean and friendly ... even effective."
,,This is the way to go in Singapore.,5.0,,"Previous visits to Singapore saw my wife and I use taxis mostly; the occasional train; and lots of walking. On our latest visit we changed all that. Some research before we left on our trip; a couple of walk-throughs in slow time once there, and within a day or two we were experts at using Singapores MRT system. It's inexpensive, it's very clean and punctual, and it's the only way to go. If you take the buses you also see so much more of the hustle and bustle of Singapore without the frustration. It's very hard to get lost. Buses and trains have information screens and verbal prompts so that at any time you know exactly where you are. We were in Singapore for eight days and only once used a taxi. The rest of the time we were travelling throughout the island on buses and trains. Here are some tips.
Before you leave for Singapore download maps and MRT maps of Singapore to familiarise yourself with the system. Once there head for the nearest MRT station and purchase an EZ-Link ticket (not the 3 day pass). EZ_Link costs just $12 at time of writing. $5 is for the card and $7 for pre-loaded credit. While you are buying your card ask for an MRT pocket guide (free). Use the EZ-Link on trains and buses of the SMRT. Each time you use it, remaining credit is displayed. As the credit declines you can top it up $10 at a time at most MRT stations.
Now for the bonus. After enjoying your travels around the beautiful island of Singapore you may have credit left on your card. No problem, simply redeem any unused credit at the MRT station for cash. We also kept the card as a memento at no charge."
,,Very clean,5.0,,This is probably the best way to get around Singapore . Hi quality service that is both clean and fast. Everyone seems to be a lot happier than on the underground back home. You defiantly notice that !
,,So easy to commute around Singapore!,5.0,,We spent a 10 day holiday in Singapore and found the MRT to be an excellent way to commute around the city and see all the sights so conveniently and economically. We got 3 day passes for $20 each and just kept renewing these as we needed them. Great!
,,Very Clean and very easy to use,5.0,,Very Clean and very easy to use. People very helpful. the 3 day pass for S$20.00 is excellent value. If your are a pioneer (old) the young are very respectful and offer you their seat
,,Super,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and covered most of the city. Frequent trains. A super way to get around Singapore. Notably better than London Underground and New York Metro. You don't have to buy a season ticket if you are only making one or two trips at a time."
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,Cheap and fast and always clean. Excellent way of getting about and quite easy to understand when you are new to the city.
,,The best city train,5.0,,Mrt Singapore is very comfy..Singapore citizen is very polite...they will give a seat to kids.. and the citizen is good manner..no body will push you inside the trsin and always in a rule when the train stop. Very safe to take this transpirt

,,very easy to use,4.0,,Very easy to use. You can visit the all city without spending a fortune on taxis. I truly reccomend it
,,Brilliant Public transport,5.0,,"We used this transport to get our way around the City today.Absolutely brilliant public transport cheap fast and easy to use.
The only down side was the amount of people in each carriage made finding a seat a challenge.Having said that, it is built to take alot of people move them around a busy city at a reasonable price.
A credit to the Government here providing services for their citizens, and the travelling public."
,,MRT,4.0,,"An Mrt that works.
Remember however that people dont squeeze to make space for others. Everyone gathers at the entrance gates making difficult for people to get in despite the fact brilliant work done by mrt people by sticking stickers asking people to move in but no one does.
Never experienced an mrt being late."
,,Reliable transportation mode,4.0,,"Reliable transportation mode.
However, cashier is more like ""do not bother me"" attitude.

Surprise, there is no window for Tourists for questions
and it will help if tourist rider(s) able to get small bills to pay for the ticket

Can't ride as early as I have planned since I don't have a small bill
to buy tickets."
,,Best way to experience Singapore - Take MRT,5.0,,Singapore MRT offers tourist pass which we found very useful to travel around. Offers connectivity to almost all tourist locations.
,,Easy and comfortable commuting experience,5.0,,"I have taken the public transport in quite few countries across the world and I can confidently say the SMRT is one of the best experiences.

,,FAST EASY CHEAP,5.0,,Quick and easy way to get around if dont have time to walk. We didnt experience any queues at the ticket booths. Clean and no beggars which is nice.
,,"Clean, efficient and promptly transportation solution",5.0,,"But a card, we will pay 5$ as a non-refundable tax, and add whatever you need for public transportation. Is a much better solution compared with one way ticket. If you don't succeed to spend all the amount we will get the difference at the airport. The card is valid 5 years, who knows? Maybe we will visit again Singapore..."
,,Super easy lots of shops inside,5.0,,"Super easy to get to, and use, metro they call it met for short, goes most places, if ur disabled most people automatically stand up, and offer you a seat, if u have a walking stick as I did, till mine broke
You get your ticket from a machine and place it down on the card reader, when you go up you place it again to let you out, inside the met they have shops and very strange vending machines! Why strange you can get a chicken parmisan, hot sandwich in 90 seconds, or a kebab hot sandwich! It tells you how long you have to wait, next door they have other vending machines, for drinks it's cost is about £1and delicious! I was shocked! Machine used mainly for workers in a hurry and on a budget and it really works.!woryh trying once anyway!"
,,Efficient and user friendly,5.0,,"Easy to navigate around, their are apps about and I used explore Singapore and it worked well for me.
The MRT is clean and cold which is great when you are sightseing.
There is also no direct access to the tracks unlike the tube which prevents jumpers, there are doors on the station which only open when the train is there.
Clean efficient and comfortable, easy to follow maps and lights which identify which station you are approaching/at.
Staff were very helpful, we were there for 2 weeks so purchased a normal EZ link card rather than the tourist card as it represented better value for money, it also gets you on the sentosa express where the tourist card doesn't.
Easy to top up at the stations or 7/11's
Felt very safe especially as a family, at one stage 2 of our children got on age 7 and 11 and the doors closed leaving us on the platform. The locals on the train on our advice stated they would assure us they got off at the next station.
The platform staff radioed ahead and they were sat with our children as we arrived 5 minutes later as we were all relieved to be reunited, the staff gave them sweets for their ordeal.
A great service to be proud of and TFL could take a leaf out of the MRT guidebook."
,,Awesome,5.0,,MRT is awesome in Singapore. Saved us hundreds of minutes and lots of money. To travel to my hotel in Scotts Road to office in Raffles Place it took us 7-9 minutes only. I liked the cleanliness and the massive network they have built underground. The shops and food courts around them tells the magnitude of planning that the whole system required. Truly commendable.
,,Cannot be beat!,5.0,,"The MRT and transit system in general is terrific. It runs on schedule, it well signed and is clean. We spent four days getting around town on the MRT and were able to visit all the highlights of the city.
You can buy a three day tourist pass and have the card re-charged for additional days if you need it.
There is a 10SGD deposit on the card that is refundable when you turn the card back to the the ticket office.
This is the best value in Singapore!"

A few leakages in the subway stations too. Lot of food options to pick up on way to the stations, within the subways. Maybe the timing could be extended to say midnight ?"
,,Excellent by all means,4.0,,"whenever we need to be accurate on time we commute in MRT, the convenience, facilities, punctuality are world-class yet the fare is considerably cheap that you need not to buy 10SGD day-pass if you don't use more than 5-6 trips a day.

The only setback is some difficulty finding elevators in some station if you need to use them ,eg. wheelchairs, strollers"

,,Efficient & Cheap,5.0,,"If all the transportation in the world is as efficient and as affordable as SMRT train, it will be great. 2m30s during peak hour and 5m during non-peak hour for the waiting time. With EZLink, a ride never cost more than $2. Environment is very clean as well."

,,"Safe, clean, and handy",5.0,,The MRT is maybe the best I have been on in the world. It is the best and most affordable option of getting around in Singapore. There is no sense if security problem or crime. The maps and directions are user friendly. A friend showed me the ropes the first time and after that it was no problem.
,,Clean,5.0,,As usual clean and easy. Quite cheap and takes you around a lot if Singapore. Very safe and I think personally children can go alone as I found it very safe.
,,Confusing for 1st time visit to Spore,3.0,,I found it quite confusing at first but understand the path after my 2nd & 3rd day of my stay. For 1st timers please please please get your map ready. You gonna need it to understand the MRT line. Which station you want to hop in & to hop out.
,,best way to travel round Singapore,5.0,,"Can't recommend the use of the SMRT highly enough as a means of getting round in Singapore. It's clean, safe, reliable and runs to time. The labelling, signage, and maps are very easy to understand and follow making for stress-free travel at very reasonable prices."
,,What a great transport system,5.0,,We bought a $10 card from the airport. Used the system to get to our hotel then around the city. Very easy to top up the card. So convenient and safe system.

,,Easy to get around,5.0,,"We took the MRT to sentosa, cheap and easy to understand. Waiting times were mimimal. Ticket machines easy to follow."
,,"MRT-Singapore, mass rapid transport. Trains.",5.0,,"As a traveller I would recommend getting a tourist pass. These are available for one, two or three days and are reasonably priced. Once you return your card you get $10 back. The trains are pretty easy to work out and come regularly. The MRT covers everywhere you could possibly want to go. You get to where you are going FAST and in air conditioned comfort. They are very clean as are the stations. Highly recommend jumping on."
,,"Clean, easy, convenient and air-conditioned!",4.0,,"This is a very convenient and easy subway system to get around in Singapore. The stations and trains are very clean and air-condiitioned. However, it is always crowded even at non-peak hours."

,,Impressive,5.0,,"Safe, cheap, fast. efficient, what more can you ask for. Can be a bit crowded during peak hours but don't be put off, join the locals, your never more than a few hundred metres from a station and close to all attractions."
,,Best I've experienced worldwide,5.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore you will use their subway system, the MRT. You'll still do some walking as many of the stations have very long tunnels linking the stations to the surface, but you'll be out of the sun and heat. You'll also usually have access to very clean public restrooms, which is a rarity for public transportation where I'm from. Someone is always on hand to answer questions about where you should go or how to get a tourist pass. I certainly recommend the multi-day passes if you're spending any amount of time visiting Singapore as you'll definitely get your money's worth. Just remember to return it before you leave for home to get your deposit back."
,,"Clean, Fast and Efficient",5.0,,"I have used underground mass transit systems in many places around the world and the Singapore MRT is in my opinion the best. It is user friendly, spotlessly clean and by far the fastest way of getting around this densely populated city.
Rarely have I waited for more than 4 minutes for a train and in peak times a train every 2 minutes is the norm. The new (2017) downtown line that includes the Fort Canning station provides even better access to the popular Clarke Quay area.
Most tourist attractions in Singapore are within a 10 minute walk of an MRT station . A three day Tourist Pass for $20 SIN gives you unlimited MRT travel and also includes travel on local bus lines. Great value!"
,,"Clean, well organized, safe!",5.0,,"One of the best transportation network in the world, for sure. Its easy to use, impossible to get lost, has friendly helpful staff, and has amazing info videos inside the trains."
,,Super Efficient,5.0,,My 3rd visit to Singapore. The MRT has to be by far the most efficient transport system i have ever seen. It makes getting around Singapore so easy. Im still learning about how it works so my only suggestion would be a leaflet full of hints for new users. But even without that its an incredible system.
,,Awesome experience,5.0,,"Seamless, secured, speed are three words in crisp about SMRT. amazed at their connectivity and frequency."

,,First class,5.0,,"The Singapore mrt is a service, that can't be matched by any other service outside Asia, the cleanliness of the stations, the punctuality of the trains, and the cost of the service, makes anything we have in the uk look ancient, a great way of getting around Singapore"
,,Get around easily!,4.0,,"A key to any location, rural, suburban or urban, is transportation, regardless if walking, skating, wheelchair, bicycle(Doublevision!), pedicab, tuk-tuk, mini- or maxi-bus, or, many times in the more densely populated areas, of mass/public transit.
The mire convenient and easy it is for the users, the better and more likely it will be used. Singapore is no exception, and had a fine system.
The ONLY downside was riding from the airport to the Bugis Station. There were NO benches or seating available in the wagon I was in; at least I could cling to the railing!"
,,Rivals Japan and Seoul,5.0,,"So easy to use, fast, clean, well signed and rapid. Transfers easy because of escalators. I was especially lucky because there was a stop right across from my Hotel, the Amoy."
,,"Swift, clean and really good price",5.0,,"Every time I come to Singapore I use the SMRT to get around,
It’s quick and very easy to use, the map system is easy to understand,
And it’s clean.

You can purchase a travel card from any of the stations, first cost is $12.00 that $5.00 for the card that you can keep until you return Again (had mine for 3 years)
And the $7.00 will get you around for a good 2 days.

And if you need to top your card up it’s simple, locate the machine , lay your
Card on the little plate, and feed your dollars into the machine, hay presto...."
,,👍👍👍,3.0,,Good mode of public transportation. Can bring you from one end to another. Just dislike it at certain areas or during peak hours though....
,,"""brilliantand easy to use""",5.0,,"if only we were able to experience a system like this in Australia however ticket and information staff leave a lot to be desired attitude wise I felt without exception they were doing us a favour talking to us ...very ambivalant,shame really as a smile would have been good."
,,Its so convinience,5.0,,You can go almost the whole Singapore with SMRT. Its really fast and convenience. If you go in really early morning a lots of station is free of charge. Try to get up early one time and go SMRT for free. I did go very early to Marina bay and catch the sunrise. Its a wonderful experience plus I travel by SMRT free in early morning timing.
,,Fast and clean,4.0,,Really good public transport. The minus 1 star is because it is not possible to pay with card for single fares.
,,Crowded but easy to navigate,3.0,,Everything is in English (helpful) and pretty straightforward in how to buy a ticket. You use a token and then you insert the token once your trip ends. Prices are prorated based on distance.
,,"Speedy, cheap and clean.",5.0,,This is the best way to travel around Singapore. Easy to locate any area on the station maps The ticket machines are simple to use.
,,A ride on a driverless train,5.0,,"The SMRT is extremely worthwhile as the driverless trains whizz around the underground safely moving millions of passengers each year. The precision of the train, the timetable, the accessibility was just wonderful to experience. I highly recommend using this on your visit to Singapore."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Juat like all the MRTs in Asia, the MRT system is clean, convenient and tourist friendly. Can get around anywhere in Singapore including all the main sites. Great and price efficient way of getting around. If time is not a main factor this is the way to get around."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Efficient and easy to use, stations located conveniently throughout the city. Very busy during peak times, but pleasant nonetheless. Don't have exact change? There are staffed information booths that will provide smaller change for your big bills."
,,The convenient way to travel,5.0,,"You will get this Explore SG card from the Singapore airport on arrival after clearing customs you can search for stalls . They give it for 10SGD which has top up of 5SGD already in it .
You can travel from BUS,MRT,LRT.. you just have to top up the card according to your travel needs and scan it at places .

Standard tickets cost more
Plus the plans they have which are daily are too costly"
,,"One of, if not the Worlds best Metro/Subway system~",5.0,,"Clean, Efficient, cost effective, on time, what more can you ask for? Singapore is known for it endless effort to become more efficient, the MRT exemplifies the spirit of Singapore's great social experiment. Well Done~!"

,,"Clean, Cool, Safe",5.0,,"This is one of the best subway systems I have seen on any continent. Buy a topoff card for 5 SGD and then add money to it for easy access to the system. This subway is spotlessly clean and I love the excellent aircon in the system and all the cars, on a typical hot day its about 70 in every subway car-thank you

Easy to understand system, clean, safe."
,,MRT review,3.0,,"Efficient mode of transport. Can improve by being more frequent even during off peak hours, and having trains travel faster during peak hours. This will decrease commuting time and increase the attractiveness of taking the trains."
,,Great system,5.0,,"So long as you aren't afraid of crowds, then this is the way to get around. If you ever wondered where everyone is in Singapore, they're under ground. Such ease of getting around, fast and clean."
,,"Perfect, One of the Best Public Transport in the World.!",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is safe, efficient, reliable and fast. More maps available and the ez-link cards work a treat. Prepaid travel cards are best to have to avoid queues at ticketing. Carriages are always cleaned and locals respectful for elderly people. Some teenagers need reminding. Always quiet as nearly everyone are looking at their mobiles and nothing else."
,,How an underground should be,5.0,,"The MRT (mass rapid transport) is very efficient and from my short experience runs on time. The underground is almost spotless and no beggars/buskers. There are doors on the platforms that only open when a train arrives so very safe. We used a pre paid card, similar to the oyster card in London I presume as it can be used on buses as well and it is fairly cheap to use. The helpfulness of the staff and indeed the locals shone through on a couple of occasions for us helping us decide the best route for our needs. Never used the system in rush hour so cannot comment on how crowded it gets at this time.

Excellent dervice"
,,Easy Frequent Fast Reasonable,4.0,,Took the MRT from our hotel to see various sights round and about. Station signs in the streets could be more prominent - they seem to be rather discreet.

,,"Convenient, efficient and rapid",5.0,,"Reach everywhere in Singapore. Easy to access, cleanliness, clear direction, informative and helpfully staff. An ideal way travel around in Singapore."
,,Super clean,5.0,,Normally I do not use mass transit in most cities. I take taxi. But in Singapore the tube is super clean and efficient. The only other compatible city is Tokyo.
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"The most convenient way of travelling in Singapore island is via SMRT.

Recently, I decided to go town via SMRT. The tube came by on time, every tube’s waiting time is around 3-4 mins depending on the time of the day. Avoid timing from 8-9.30am and 6-7.30pm, as these timing are the golden peak timing, where commuters on/off work.

It’s been a few years I took the SMRT, ever since I got a car and always drive around Singapore. I was amused when I step into the cabin. The environment is clean, and the aircon is powerful. On TOP of each door, there is a LED screen providing you informations, maps, and what’s around the area in the next station. I remembered the last time I took SMRT I don’t get to see this.

Singapore is a small island, to get to every part of the island, SMRT is the easiest route."
,,Reliable and clean!,5.0,,"Super easy to understand and move around. If you’re only visiting Singapore for a short time buy single rides; if you’re staying for more than 3 days I recommend getting a top up card. The card is available in 7-Eleven as well as MRT stations it’s around $15 and whatever you don’t use, you can get back minus the $5 card fee."

Simple ways to buy tickets (for tourist, they have 3 Days Pass, but you can also buy their EZ-Link Card with cheaper fare). Their MRT Map is so easy to be understood. If you can ace this MRT, I think you can have this kind of transportation around the world."
,,F1 weekend,5.0,,I my opinion it's the best in the word . Staff so helpful and everywhere is so clean And very cheap to travel on
,,Very easy to use highly recommend apt passes for the duration you plan to use,5.0,,Though you may have to walk to the station at starting point and your destination it is very convenient/easy to use/get around. Ticketing is all through touch screen enabled point of sale systems - very intuitive. Accepts card/cash/returns change :-). The buses don't have change concept. In fact the city buses when you get in and want to pay cash the driver will be stumped - he will calculate and ask you to put the exact change in a box - which has the needed hardware inside to recognize the amount and prints the tickets. PASS is the best way.
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,"3 day visit so bought the 3 day tourist pass. Well worth it to get around. System easy to navigate, clean and felt very safe.

,,"Clean, easy and fast",5.0,,We found this subway system totally unstressful. It was actually a pleasure compared to other countries subway systems. People are courteous too and offer seats up for those with young tired kids not just pregnant woman.
,,AMAZING MRT - CLEAN & EFFICIENT,5.0,,"In Singapore for a weeks holiday. Staying near Promenade & Esplanade MRT stations so we purchased the Singapore Travellers Card - $10 refundable deposit + $20 for three days unlimited travel on trains & buses - well worth it. We used the MRT extensively throughout our stay. It is clean, efficient and their system map for the various lines and stations is easy to understand.

,,The only method of getting around Singapore,5.0,,"Spent a week in Singapore before and after a 3 night cruise. Utilised the MRT from Changi Airport arrival to departure. Purchased a card at Changi Station which can be used on trains, buses etc. The freedom of getting to places of interest and to/from cruise terminal was great. A handy hint for those wanting to visit Marina Bay Sands and the adjacent Gardens. The closest MRT is Bayfront. The closest MRT for the Singapore Flyer is Promenade."

Purchase of cards can be done by cash or card. I instructions are in English, chinese and Malaysian.

The train system is super efficient and super clean."
,,Good,5.0,,SMRT is very simple and useful is Singapore. Clear indication of the places to go. Maybe travel card for tourist. I did not had the opportunity to use if there was.
,,Fast and practical,5.0,,"Best way to go around the city: fast, clean, organized. It says a lot about the city and how modern it is."
,,Clean and quick way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is the easiest way to get around Singapore, buy a ""local"" card for 12 Singapore dollars as they are much better value than the Tourist cards"

,,So easy to use - totally recommend,5.0,,"Can’t go wrong - the epitome of Singapore - clean reliable and perfectly thought out. Totally recommend using - so easy to get around and used to get to Marina, Chinatown, Little India and back to Orchard (ION)"
,,Tourist-friendly,5.0,,Travelling with Singapore's MRT is such a breeze. We purchased a Singapore Tourist Pass at the airport and MRT is unlimited for 3 days. What I like about it is it has lights on the station names that it hasn't passed yet. The ones it already passed has no lights so you'll really know if you've gotten on the right track or not. Air conditioning is good too.
,,Best transport system in the world,5.0,,"On our recent visit to Singapore we used the MRT everyday to get to all the tourist sites quickly, cheaply and safely. We purchased a loadable card on our first day in Singapore very cheaply and loaded $20 onto it. We used the MRT more than once a day, everyday for 5 days and still had money left over at the end. The stations can be a little difficult to navigate (as some platforms are located in different areas of the station) but the people of Singapore and station staff are so friendly and helpful. The trains themselves are frequent and clean (there's no eating or drinking allowed). I travelled with my elderly mother and everytime someone offered her a seat. I have never seen anything like this anywhere else in the world. Amazing!"
,,Buy a dsy ticket if in town for a short time,5.0,,Buy a day ticket S$10 plus a S$10 deposite on the card. Then you can top it up as required. Get your deposit back at the airport station.

,,World Best Metro!!,5.0,,"I have visited Singapore many times, over the years, and always use the SMRT as my preferred method to travel around. The system designers have addressed all aspects of efficient mass transport of people, which is comfortable and relatively inexpensive. But they also continue to make incremental improvement, in scheduling and rolling stock.

I did a stop over for a couple or nights in Singapore with my teenage daughter, which we loved. We exclusively used the SMRT to get around everywhere."
,,The best way to travel in Sing City,4.0,,Trains are always clean and stations designs are tailored to the part of town. Major attractions are well connected. Peak hours crowd from 7-9am and 5-8pm. Sometimes there are major train service interruption but they provide free bus services to nearest stations.
,,Brilliant as always,5.0,,"Fast,clean efficient. Easy to use even as. A disabled passenger. Cheap to use, easily the best way to travel in Singapore. Buy a tourist card rather than pay for each individual trip. Well worth the money."
,,The Best MRT system,5.0,,The SMRT is the best I have seen anywhere in the world. Stations are located in the best positions all around Singapore and the fares are cheap. They are continuing to build more lines and stations. I would suggest using the MRT from Chnagi to the city and return. About 2.50 each way and takes about 35 minutes on the Downtown line. You have to change at the second last stop at Expo. Follow the signs to the top of the station and it is only 5 mins to Changi airport. Trains run from 5.30 am on weekdays.
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"MRT is easy to use and navigate around Singapore. Clean stations and trains, safe and it is good value."

,,"Convenient, efficient, safe",5.0,,"The trains look, feel and sound spanking new. It’s almist always on time, with signs that tell you the expected time of arrivals. The trains arrive frequently, every couple of minutes. The routes cover almost the entire island. It’s simply a convenient, comfortable, and enjoyable way to travel around Singapore."
,,Seriously easy to use,5.0,,"This has to be one of the cleanest and easiest to use public transport systems I've been on. Travelling from the airport was simple, well signposted and quick. The signage in the carriages is fantastic."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Easily the best way to get around Singapore with clean and comfortable trains running every few minutes.

Very easy to negotiate as well, as all the lines are colour coded and signs are easily followed.

Buy a tourist ticket for unlimited travel and you can travel around Singapore very quickly and cheaply."
,,"Clean, efficient and cheap.",5.0,,The MRT is a great way to move around the city. I would rate this as the most pleasant and efficient transport system I have experienced.
,,Easy travelling,5.0,,Cheap and easy to use Must buy an EZ link card to make travel easy Very similar to MTR in Hong Kong Staff helpful at kiosks and always felt safe I wish the London Underground was as clean and safe

,,Quick stopover,5.0,,I have always enjoyed being in transit in Singapore as I have an MRT card which can take me to the centre of Singapore and back with no hassles. Super reliable!
,,Amazing System,5.0,,"This is really great, so easy to navigate and get around to anywhere you want at a cheap price. Could be more ticket machines at time though."

,,One of a kind,5.0,,These are the cleanest and the most quiet and modern trains I’ve ever seen. And they take you everywhere!
,,Easily the best way yo get around,5.0,,"Clean, quick, regular. What more can you ask for? The MRT is without doubt the best and fastest way to get to your destination in Singapore. The people (well most of them) are so polite and will offer their seat if you appear at all elderly, such a refreshing thing if your British and not used to it. Just wish there was a station down by the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel instead of walking to the nearest one at Clarke Key!"
,,Good way to get around,4.0,,"A inexpensive way to get around Singapore,once you get used to the way the system works it's an easy way to travel and if you don't mind walking you can get to see most of the sights,gardens on bay,marina bay sands,China town,saves money on taxis"
,,2 Day Tourist Pass,4.0,,For short stays get the tourist pass. For 2 days it's $16 SGD plus $10 refundable deposit. Get it at the ticket office at T2 Changi Airport. Get into city in less than 20 minutes. Staff very polite and helpful. Use MRT app to help you navigate between stations or Moovit for connecting services such as buses.
,,Tourists Pass Was Worth It,4.0,,"When we arrived to Singapore we took a risk and bought the tourist pass that would allow us full access to the SMRT system. It was the best idea we had on this trip. The SMRT system is easy to use (particularly with the tourist pass) and we were able to visit all of the sites we wanted to see.

The trains are clean, and so are the stations. The stations can be a little confusing, but there are maps posted as well as maps of each station are shown on the trains as you arrive. The only fault is how busy it can get, but that’s just a good sign that the locals are using it too. We noticed that taxis seem to be very popular in Singapore, I’m not sure why as the public transit is really good."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,Easy to get around! Workers available are very helpful. Trains are clean and timely. Loved the tourist pass. MRT was well planned out and shows a world class city!
,,The most efficient mode of transport I’ve every used,5.0,,"The MRT locations are great, they are fast, frequent, and are a great example of a well organised system.

My only complaint is not being able to purchase tickets with a card, the machines accept cash only, and only $5notes or smaller. This is painful when the ATMs are hard to find."
,,Smrt - tone down your expectations,2.0,,"The country may be a developed one but the Singapore mass transit system is nothing but ordinary. I will start with the MRT trains
1. They have unusual display issues. Sometimes they are one station behind. Its ok for the locals and they tend it to ignore it by saying , "" oh its the 500th time they have seen it..but for a tourist, its a headache.
2. The entries and exits are really frustrating sometimes. I think they forgot to look a little further in future.

3. MRT are unreliable if you hsve a close meeting schedule. Pick a taxi cos the train will stop for extra minutes at a station n you will be left with no option than to whine

Now the buses...

1. Half of them don't have a screen display that which station is approaching.
2. Some of the bus schedules are so frustrating. E.g at ang mo kio mrt station, the route 972 has 1 bus every 30 seconds due to a college there but to get route 70, sometimes it takes 25 minutes.. hard to understand this.

Take a taxi if you have to. I had never got such issue in the developed countries like Sweden or Australia. But for that matter, I find Thailand n India, also better than Singapore.

Take a Taxi ... Dont frustrate yourself"
,,A great way to travel,5.0,,"Before visiting Singapore people said make sure you try the trains and we are so glad we did . So easy to work out , quick, on time, clean and cheap. And the best thing is that they are air conditioned which is great to get you out of the heat."
,,Fast and clean,3.0,,Fast and clean but a pain in the rear to get a ticket when you're only in town briefly. The machines won't accept large bills (S$50) and the ticket counter wouldn't sell single tickets - they told me to go to a shop and break the note. That's really not what I expect in Singapore!
,,So easy,4.0,,Been to Singapore a couple of times but never used the SMRT until this trip and found it so easy to use.The staff where very helpful in advising what type of ticket or card to get for the time we where going to be in the City.The maps where easy to read and work out which line to use and which station to change to a different line.
,,The gold standard for city transport,5.0,,"Quick, ultra modern, safe, easy to use, cheap, efficient, frequent, super clean this fantastic network keeps growing and improving. No wait was more than 2 minutes. A feature was the LED screens showing station progress and carrying information and pictures on each destination. SMRT is super smart."
,,The Doors,4.0,,"This was the first time I had come across a partition and doors at a station. I only travelled one stop, but it seemed to have no problems with pressure in the ears that I got in a later journey with a similar system in London."
,,Tourist Pass,5.0,,This mtr I consider one of the best and most efficient effective ways to get around singapore. Tourist pass for 1 2 or 3 days are a must. You pay a 10 deposit on each card burreceive a refund when you return the card. Covers all the go to areas of singapore gets crowded during peak hours but still worth every cent. You wait no more than 5 minutes for a connecting train and keeps you out of the heat and hu.idity of Singapore. Look for hotel accommodations near an mtr stn .
,,Easy and quick,5.0,,"I always took taxis to central Singapore but again. A quick, clean and timely experience on the SMRT and MRT."
,,"Fast, easy and super convenient",5.0,,"We were a family of 8 on vacation and hiring 2 cabs was costing us a fortune. The SMRT was very fast, cheap, clean and convenient for us."
,,Very easy to navigate,5.0,,"We bought the ez card which included $7 of credit. Most short trips were less than a dollar. The mrt was easy to navigate, clean and well signposted. A great way to get around the city."
,,An excellent way to get around,5.0,,"Like everything in Singapore, clean and efficient. When you buy a ticket, keep it and top it up when you next ride. After a few rides you get a discount. However tickets expire after a month."
,,Great,5.0,,"Have travelled around Japan and Hong kong on rail network but Singapore also did not disappoint. The staff are friendly but make sure you only use $5 and lower in the ticket machines.
Once you have the lines figured out you are good to go. Used the MRT for most of my stay in SNG. The kids did not complain either."
,,Very clean and convenient,5.0,,We used to use MRT very often. I rather say Singalore MRT is very clean and convenient than any other countries'. For example most of all the MRT stations have Escalator to go up/down. And it is very clean as drinking and eating in the station as well as train are not allowed.
,,Convenient to beat the traffic during peak hr,3.0,,Extremely convenient especially during peak hours when there are traffic jams. Otherwise it’s faster to travel by car. Affordable ($2+ per trip) but breakdown frequently. Do check the closure timings as they differ due to maintenance / upgrading etc
,,Great sustem,5.0,,Very reliable and user friendly system. Air conditioned as well. There is a wonderful real time update provided on the status of the trains.
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,The Singapore MRT system is easy to use and the best way to get around to the places you want to see. As a tourist you can purchase a Singapore Tourist Pass from selected locations the MRT web site will give them to you. A 3 day pass will cost you $30.00 this will give you full travel on all modes of public transport in Singapore and once your 3 days are over you can add money to your car so you can continue to use the public transport system for the length of your stay.
,,Metro in Singapore,5.0,,Very good system . Suggest to get 3 days tourist card value 30$ and enjoy going round Singapore as there are number of interconnected routes most of the places can be visited by this system . Tourist card can be purchased at airport .
,,Easy and great,5.0,,We stayed on Sentosa Island and travelled everywhere from Vivo City.We are not usually train travellers but you can buy a travellers pass and travel easily anywhere.This pass also allows you to travel on their bus service as well.Really clean safe and one arriving every few minutes.Always a staff member to help out .
,,Easy clean and affordable transport,5.0,,You should definitely use the metro system in Singapore (MRT) to easily get around in a modern and clean underground.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT would have to be one of the best. Easy to use and very safe. There is clear displays within each car showing the current, and upcoming, stops. You buy a card at $12 of which $5 is a charge and $7 is for fares. The card is easily topped up in the machines."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,"MTR seems to have expanded a lot since previous visits and I found it easy to navigate, good value for money and fast and efficient. Staff were very helpful with information and advice. Great way to get around as Singapore is surprisingly not very pedestrian friendly unless you know where all the overpasses/underpasses are. Some major roads are uncrossable and lights for vehicles seem to take 3 minutes at least to allow pedestrians crossing."
,,"fantastic cheap, clean and quick way to travel",5.0,,"A fantastic cheap, clean and quick way to travel around Singapore. Ticket machines are easy to use. We used the access via Somerset Road (opposite the local Information centre)."
,,Convienient travel in Singapore,4.0,,"using the MRT in Singapore is easy and fast and reliable. Especially when you travel alone it's the best way of moving there. Relative cheap when single passenger, if travel with family, like 3-4 person might become into same price as taxi. Crowded on peak hours in the morning and afternoon. Don't run at night time"
,,Best ever public transport system.,5.0,,"If only we had this level of service, design and punctuality back in Australia. A little complex to get started but so easy after the first time. Very regular trains, every 5 mins usually, spotlessly clean and lots of English speaking attendants to ask if you need some help."
,,User Unfriendly Tourist Unfriendly,3.0,,"We went to give a try to the mrt as it is very well connected everywhere in singapore.

Ticket vending machines (15-20 minute queue) are very convenient only if the take credit cards which they weren’t.

In our case, it needed small change for tickets as it would not accept 50 Sgd notes. So we go to the information counter which directed us to a long queue for tickets.

After 30 minute queue we cane to know that they don’t sell individual tickets but passes. When asked for change they told that they don’t have change and we need to go to change machine which was also out of order.

Finally had to skip dreaming of traveling in MRT after wasting an hour on my precious holiday and took a taxi - Little expensive but easy and comfortable and NO WAITING QUEUE!!!"
,,Very quick - Highly recommend,5.0,,"Fantastic, never had an issue on the system, was very easy to understand and was very easy to get from a to b. Highly recommend."
,,Super clean and reliable!,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is legendary for its cleanliness, reliability and safety. The network has been expanded to include more tourist destinations. Taking the MRT is a very convenient, easy to navigate and relatively cheap way of exploring Singapore. This is one of the reasons why Singapore is one of top tourist destinations in the world."
,,Good Value,5.0,,The best option when visiting singapore when you have a restricted budget. SMRT will connect you to most attraction in a timely manner. Best alternative to taxi car.
,,I wish we had this in our cities,5.0,,"This is the most efficient, clean, safe tube system I have seen. You can hop on at the airport or the cruise port and go just about anywhere in Singapore you want for less than 1 US dollar for most inner city travel and 2 US dollars for remote areas in the system. The EZ-link card, mentioned by fellow reviewers, is the cheapest deal - you add as much money to the card as you need, and you can get the balance of the money back at the end of your stay! This is cheaper than buying a day pass or week pass. This pass is also good for the system's buses. The people working in the stations were very helpful and courteous. The passengers are all well-behaved - note the sign in the photo above - they are not kidding around. In addition to signs with pro-social messages for courtesy and consideration, there are also videos in stations and on the trains promoting how to react in an emergency and noting that sexual harassment will be dealt with (video shows young woman running for help and next scene is police tackling and arresting the perp). Cops are frequently visible. The tracks are inaccessible to the passengers waiting on the platforms - blocked by plexiglass barriers with sliding doors that only open when the train doors line up just right."
,,great transport system with great coverage of the city,5.0,,great transport system with great coverage of the city. Ticket price also very cheap. Best way to travel in Singapore
,,Clean and Tidy,5.0,,"The system is clean and operates in time, people are very polite if you get lost on your journeys

There is no eating or Drinking on the trains, be careful otherwise you face a heavy fine. We brought 3 days travel card which was great $27, plus you get $10 back when you have finished with the travel card.

Have safe trip and enjoy."

,,The BEST transport system ever!,5.0,,"Even during the rush hour there was always space, no jostling. It helps that the Singaporeans are very well mannered folk. The trains were always on time and always clean. Very good value for money too."
,,Efficient & cost effective,4.0,,"We boarded the train from Kranji to Lavender station and on the next day to Changi Airport. For light travelers and backpackers, this life of the transport is most efficient and cheap."
,,extremely efficient,5.0,,"buy the ezlink card for public transport gravel in Singapore. It is a card where you pre-pay money ( $5 or $10 etc whatever u want ) and every time you hop on and hop off bus or train swipe it and it deducts money automatically. It is very cheap and if you are there for 8 days and travel each day to different destinations in total you will end up spending around $18-$20 per person. You can get this cards in 7-11 stores which are open 24 hrs or any ticket counter in metro station.
Using the MRT or buses is the best option to travel in Singapore"
,,Easy to use and easy to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Travellers can obtain day passes, however, the place where one can buy are limited to certain stations and they have office hours. Wish they had auto-dispense machines so that tourists can obtain them at any time."

,,Cheap and convenient,5.0,,"Wherever you wanna go, just plan your trip before you leave your apartment or hotel. It’s much easier to travel when you have a plan. Singaporeans are always in a rush, so it’s best to avoid rush hours like 8AM or 5-6PM. I’ve insert a map of the MRT. You’re welcome :)"

,,"The best clean, safe, fast and cheap city subway we’ve used.",5.0,,"Buy and use a multi-trip travel card and the driverless train system is wonderful - London Transport clearly has a lot to learn. And people are universally courteous to tourists, even in Rush Hour. We look forward to our next few days trips."
,,Great transport system - covering pretty much everywhere,4.0,,This is a great transport system - cheap and convenient. But there are a lot of stations and you may have to change multiple times and spend a lot of time on the train to get to your destination. If you have time to spare then it is awesome.

,,Very fast can get to destination but needs improvement on environment in train,4.0,,"It is so much faster these days to get from West to East and anywhere in Singapore. However, the aircon was not cold on some days. It was very stuffy inside the train especially on the East-West green line, people were sweating. Please improve on making the travelling experience a better one by turning on the aircon inside the train."
,,Singapore efficiency at its best,5.0,,"Buy a card and top it up - we keep it in our passport and top it up each time, very fast,SAFE, cheap and efficient. Well signed and all signs in English - the best way to get around Singapore"
,,Frequent and cheap,5.0,,"Singapore mass transit is very good. The buses are integrated into the MRT fare system. I would recommend buying the same transit card the locals use unless the features of the ""tourist pass"" fit you perfectly. Ask the info desk at any MRT station for the pass that the locals use. There is a small fee for the card but it's well worth the convenience. You simply add money in S$10 increments at machines in the train stations. It takes a while to use up the money because the fares are seemingly low. The buses can be a good alternative on some routes because they're more direct than the subway. Take a few minutes to look at the various sites on the web. Riding is not 100% intuitive at first, but if you read up a bit ahead of time it will help. Also note that other online maps services are pretty good at setting up a route, but be careful about the locations of stops that are on one way streets. Sometimes they will put the ""to"" stop in the ""from"" stop location when they're on separate one way streets. The frequency on MRT lines is every 2 to 10 minutes depending on the route and time of day, so you don't really have to worry about missing a train. Buses also have good frequency compared to some US cities. 7 to 15 minute frequency is common. When you scan your transit card in and out, it's similar to Japan, but hold your card very flat on the readers and make sure it beeps. Sometimes it won't read if the card is at an angle. At bus terminals, there are designated queues with railings for passengers to wait for buses. It's important to not advance into the sidewalk until your bus is ready to load. There's a lot of traffic in the common sidewalk where passengers from all routes have to move, and the locals are quite particular about this protocol, and you'll have a better experience if you fit in and comply. On the MRT, the stops at stations are abrupt - they appear to be run by a computer, not a driver, but it's always exactly the same, but if you're not expecting it, you could lose your footing even at that slow speed, so hang on to the handrails tight until you're used to it"
,,Excellent transport service,5.0,,This is the best transport service in the world. quick and efficient and cheap. Large clean and safe stations. Once you get used to the size of the train stations it is very easy to get around
,,Easy and efficient,5.0,,Very good public transportation system in Singapore. You can get everywhere with the MRT and it is fast. Cheaper way to get around.
,,Simple to use,5.0,,"If you have ever used the Underground or Metro elsewhere in the world, this is very similar. We were only in Singapore for 3 days and wanted to get around easily. Went to one of the SMRT stations and purchased a 3 day pass. This also works on a lot of the bus's as well. Mastercard was accepted. Cost was approximately $30sd. Trains were very clean and efficient and in some of the busy stations a nice person approched us because we looked lost and offered assistance. Was told that $10sd could be refunded at the Airport when you depart if you hand the card in. BUT you must find the kiosk and do this before you enter departures. Hope this helps."
,,Magnificent,5.0,,"What a wonderful and easy to use system of transport for a major city so clean and cheap, why can't all cities have something similar"
,,Easy to use once you work it out!,4.0,,"SMRT was easy to use once you worked it out.

Asked to purchase a ticket and was told to use machine. Asked if I could have some help in using machine and told no.

Tried to purchase a ticket but machine only accepted 50c then shutdown. I went to seek assistance to which I was advised to use machine again and this shouldn’t happen.

Once I held up the queue for ticket purchases and worked out what I needed to do, I was then able to use the network quite easily.

Advice, take your time in figuring it out and then you are as good as gold!"
,,MRT,5.0,,Singapore visitor 3 day pass well worth it and is easy to use. Staff very helpful and redeeming of card easy.
,,Great Transport System,5.0,,Singapore has got the transportation system easy as easiest - the routes are color coded and easily understood. The use of escalators in all [?] stations makes for easy access and regress [a shame Sydney NSW is still in the dark ages compared to Singapore systems]. I used the iPhone app MOOVIT which also was great to get around with.
,,Great MRT,5.0,,We travelled with the MRT throughout our holiday in Singapore. Very clean and safe. Easy to go from one line to the other. Trains arrived frequently. Easy ticket system. Staff were very helpful when asked questions. Great way to tour Singapore. Will definitely use the MRT again in our next visit.
,,Great and convenient,4.0,,Nice way to get around considering a taxi will cost ya an arm and a leg! If you’re staying for 2-3 days you can get a tourist pass and get unlimited rides. We got a tourist pass for S20$ and it was good for 3 days. Paid for itself in the first 2 days!
,,Very good but....,3.0,,"We tried to take the train from the airport, The ticketing machines had some issues and the people manning the counter couldn't communicate in English.They kept pointing to the machines and we were left running back and forth. The rides were perfect though not being peak time."
,,Very efficient but crowded,4.0,,"I arrived in Singapore at 8am and took the MRT to my hotel near the Orchard stop. While I had a seat on the train out of the airport, that ended on the connecting train two stops later and I had to stand for 20 minutes until the City Hall stop. The EZ Link fare card works great. Singapore needs to add a timer that will let you know when the next train will arrive. They have the technology. I saw a bus status board at Eunos that told the arrival time for 18 different bus routes that stopped there."
,,So Easy,5.0,,"If staying in Singapore for a few days, get a top-up card load it with $10-$20 and you will find getting around Singapore a breeze. It was a $1.77 into the city from the Changi (the airport) and most trips were 0.77 each - its fast, reliable, very clean and efficient. Stations are easy to navigate!"
,,Easy to use,4.0,,"As the title suggests the MRT in Singapore is very easy to use but it is a little tricky getting used to it. The buses and trains can take you just about anywhere and are far cheaper than a taxi. The fares are very cheap but be aware that if you haven’t purchased a travel card then you can only use coins. As an example a bus fare from Orchard Rd (Orchard Hotel) to Sentosa Island will set you back around $4 ( bus route 123), The return journey is slightly cheaper but you need to get off the bus as soon as it gets to Orchard Rd which will leave you with a short ten minute walk to your start point. If you are staying 8n Singapore for a few days and intend to make use of the MRT then get one of their travel cards from any seven eleven store and the bus and train fares are nearly half. The travel cards are also much more convenient than carrying coin around in your pockets"
,,Most efficient MRT I have ever ridden!,5.0,,"The first time I went to Singapore in May of 2018, I was with my family and I have a one year old child at the time. It would be quite hard to be bringing such a young child on the train, however, when I went back in September of 2018, the MRT was the main means of transport I used when going around Singapore. I was amazed on how efficient it was and you can literally go around the entire island on this means of transportation! It is definitely cheaper than taking cabs all the time, and even during rush hours, the would bump up the trains to accomodate the additional foot traffic. I used the MRT primarily during the F1 weekend as several streets were closed so the best way to move around fast was via MRT. Make sure to purchase a reloadable tap card which is good for five years, or you could get the disposable paper one which is available from any automated terminal along the entire route of the MRT. Comparing this to the Hong Kong MTR, I would say that Singapore has the best network of trains that cover the entire island."
,,Easiest and Cheapest way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Better to have Ez link card , refill it when required . Minimum balance of 3 SGD is required to board any MRT . 5 SGD is non-refundable amount deposit at the time of purchasing the card."
,,Terrible Experience with all the failures and delays,1.0,,Compare with train service from overseas that had operated more years than Singapore. Singapore SMRT is a total disappointment with faults repeated times and always delays.
,,Must use,5.0,,"The MRT is so simple and easy to use, and amazingly cheap. Buy a rechargeable card from the MRT station or any 7Eleven. It comes with $5 preloaded, then we just topped up with $10 as we needed. Our first $15 lasted nearly 3 days.
All the trains and buses are air conditioned. And the both run so frequently. We never had to wait long to go somewhere.
I thought no this is by far the best way to get around SG. The double deck buses has great front seats upstairs, so you get to see lots of SG as you drive along."
,,I'm a convert,5.0,,"Singapore's light rail is brilliant, it was so easy to use and I can see why people have suggested having it here back in my home city."
,,Good service,4.0,,Quick easy and lots of regular trains. Had no problems buying a ticket and getting to my destination without assistance
,,MRT,5.0,,"The best way to get around the city - efficient, very user friendly and cheap. If you are for more than 1 day in Singapore, get yourself an Easylink card. It can be bought at many MRT stations. Load it with some money and you're away. Card can be used on buses too."
,,SMRT,5.0,,The best way to get around Singapore always check the begging and the end of th line so you know which way you are going.
,,The MRT is one of the BEST!,5.0,,"The cleanest, fastest most reliable way to travel around Singapore without breaking the bank!
I am in love with the MRT! Basically you can get to anywhere in Singapore using the train and it's well connected bus services. I was amazed to see that the MRT services are mostly driverless. We never had one issue or problem on the MRT and I travelled with my young children. It's an extremely cheap way to get to 90% of Singapore...the buses and taxis get you to other places but are more expensive than the MRT.
Oh...and we always felt completely safe whilst traveling through this fascinating nation!"
,,Great way to get around... but Tourist Pass a rip off,3.0,,"After struggling around other SE Asian cities, we found the Singapore MRT to be a clean, efficient wonder. No surprise there... lots of people report as much.

However, the 3-day Tourist Pass can end up being a BAD deal. It's sold for $20, plus a $10 refundable deposit. Total = $30.

But there's a catch. If you're leaving for Malaysia by bus, you could end up with no refund. That's because not all MRT stations issue refunds. If the station near where you're staying doesn't issue a refund (e.g. Little India), you have to haul your luggage to a station that does.

We were NOT INFORMED of this anomaly when we bought our passes at Bugis station.

Even more shocking: there's no refund possible at Nicoll Highway station, the one used by bus travelers, since it's the closest MRT station to the Golden Mile bus hub.

In our view, this is either extreme bureaucratic incompetence (kind of unlikely in Singapore, eh?) or a deliberate ploy to avoid paying the refund to Malaysia-bound travelers.

If that happens, then your wonderful 3-day Tourist Pass costs $30. You would have to take 5 trips a day for all three days to save any money.

In the end, we gave our passes to a Golden Mile ticket seller, who planned to collect the refund at Lavender station.

LESSON LEARNED: If you plan to leave for Malaysia by bus, DO NOT buy the Tourist Pass unless you know in advance that you can get the refund. By all means, take the MRT, but do so with individual fares."
,,"Clean, Quick, and Convenient",5.0,,This is by far the cleanest and best MRT I've ever used. Easy access points and able to travel to anywhere in Singapore. Look for underground walkways to beat the heat and humidity.
,,Best way to get around,4.0,,"A every efficient, clean subway system, rivalling any we’ve experienced around the major cities of the world. Spotless toilets at every station, regular trains, we never had to wait more than a few minutes.
The only challenge is working out the right exit from the station to get where you want to be, otherwise you can end up doing a bit of backtracking. There are street and exit maps at each station, but we had a few orientation issues on the stations linked to large malls after about 11pm as many are shuttered down for the night by then. No big deal, but worth noting.
We went with the standard rechargeable card, rather than the visitor cards, and felt we got value."
,,Great but we got lost a few times,4.0,,Traveling with small kids we got lost a few times. Trying to get to Marina Bay Sands we of course got a return ticket To Marina Bay station which is apparently is not where Marina Bay Sands is located. There are signs that tell you this after going past the ticket gate so we had to waste our return ticket going to the correct station which was annoying. The stations and trains are so clean compared to back home which was amazing to see.
,,The Best Public Transport,5.0,,"Singapore successfully to build safe, comfortable and cozy public transport. SMRT covering all Singapore Tourist Destination and train comes every 4-7 minutes till midnight (some route closing earlier you can found this information on each SMRT station). To get SMRT you just need to buy ezlink card (at ticket office $12 or 7 eleven $10) but if you have a lot place to visit better use Singapore Tourist Pass (1-3 days), just remember to bring back your card not late than 5 days from expiry date so you get your deposit fund."
,,Excellent service,5.0,,Lifeline of Singapore - Very convinient - East to get Bus MRT - Very cheap - MRT staff was also co-operative
,,Super Slick Transport,5.0,,"From arriving at the airport to getting to your accommodation or a major tourist attraction, this transport system us something to rival all others. The no food and drink policy in the stations and on the trains means the system is super clean and no noctious food odours."
,,LOVE it - so easy and simple to use,5.0,,We loved whizzing around on the MRT. We used the Tourist Pass which makes travel stress free. The only thing I would recommend is to check that you have the Tourist Pass - NOT the Tourist Pass PLUS if you want to get your card deposit at the end of your trip. I didn't realise I had been sold the wrong one which cost me $30. But the system itself is wonderful.
,,Family holiday,5.0,,"Used the train on a couple of occasions and they were super clean,super reliable and easy to work out. Very convenient way to travel in Singapore and family friendly."
,,Fast as.,5.0,,"Once you get to know what to do and whereto go, bloody great.cheap and easy, one day and you can work it out."
,,Fantastic public transport.,5.0,,"The smrt is the most efficient easy to navigate train system we have used in a long time. Cheap, clean and very reliable. The Singaporean’s know how to do major engineering projects and turn it into art."
,,"Efficient, cheap & fast",5.0,,"Easy to use, cheap as chips, ridiculously clean, never more than a 2 or 3 minute wait. Managed to get everywhere we needed to easily on public transport. Good lift access with pram at all stations."
,,Clean efficiant and a resonable price,4.0,,"I have found that the stations are well set out, well staffed and clean. The service runs well. The ticketing system is quick. It can get cramped but so does every rail network I imagine. I only have Melbourne to measure it by.......... so not much competition."
,,Always clean and interesting stations,4.0,,One of the great things about Singapore is the public transport. Easy to use and lots of stations I use the MRT as often as I can when visiting Singapore. You aren’t allowed to eat or drink in the train and so they are always clean and comfortable.
,,It has to be the best metro system in the world !,5.0,,"Yet again when I'm in Singapore , I marvel at just how good and efficient the MRT is -- frequent trains , very clean carriages and incredibly low fares ( by comparison with here in the UK )

It's just a bit disappointing that in recent years young Singaporeans no longer seem as willing to give up their seat to a Senior like me and stay too busy playing with their smartphone pre-occupied with Facebook or Twitter ; it never used to be like this !!"
,,Best Train System in the World,5.0,,"As a Singaporean living in Singapore, we always tend to complain that the trains are always crowded, breaking down far too easily and doesn't come regularly. But it is because that we have been in Singapore most of our life, we are ignorant to even complain about what I feel is the best train system in the world.

When we compare our MRT to neighbouring countries like Malaysia or Thailand or Indonesia, we are way ahead in our systems. We should be proud that our train network is one of the most accessible form of public transport in the world. Our trains cover almost every part of the island and our government is constantly building new stations and lines to bring train closer to our homes. So I do not see why there is a need for Singaporeans to complain about our train system at all."
,,Best mode of transport in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT is one of the best in Asia.... efficient, clean and convenient. Connecting most part of the island... it is also one of the cheapest and fastest way to travel while in Singapore."
,,Great,5.0,,"The only way to travel, so easy so cheap & the cleanest underground I've ever seen, it sparkles must see it to believe it."
,,Best Ever,5.0,,"IMO, Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is the standard against which I will judge all others from here on. Very efficient and Great Value. In many countries the rail system charges a premium to travel to the airport. SMRT charged us only SG$1.73 and we were 15 stops away! We had to change stations and the last train was waiting for us and didn't leave until the first train had departed, so no need to rush between trains.
We liked Singapore and the SMRT is a major reason we plan to visit again, for a longer stay."
,,Awesomeness +,5.0,,How do make a community happy? Feed them. House them. Employ them. Transport them. Singapore have the first three covered and the MRT is the finest in the world. If you're walking more than 400m then you've gone the wrong way. Dowload their app and get a transport pass. You're all set.
,,Offers a good economic way of travel,3.0,,"Try to get a MRT card for more economic travel within city on train and bus, else you will have to spend more for every ticket."
,,"Convenient, yet unreliable at times",3.0,,"Taking the MRT in Singapore can be a joy or a pain. Joy is that most places, even outside city areas are accessible via MRT. Some trains especially the downtown or circle lines are new and comfortable even for standing around. Pain is when it breaks down, causing delays when you are rushing to a location and you are stuck in the train. Some trains look very rundown and most of the trains’ air conditioning are extremely cold. It feels like in Iceland inside the train."
,,Easy to use and cheap,5.0,,Fantastic public train and bus system. Friendly station staff will help you. Buy local tickets not tourist passes its cheaper better value. Download the app to your phone its called Singapore MRT. Lift access for wheelchairs and prams.

,,Excellent,5.0,,"Fast, easy to access, cheap Easy to top up the card. And people from are very helping. You can ask the route to anyone."
,,Convenient & Cheap way to discover Singapore (off peak!),4.0,,"Singapore is well connected with the MRT. It's easy to navigate and access most places of interest. However, avoid peak periods (like 8am to 9.30am and 5pm to 8pm) where you will probably be sardined with the rest of the population getting to and from work!"
,,Fast and Cheap Transportation,5.0,,You may go places in Singapore with MRT. Its fast and cheap. Its also friendly for Stroller carrier. And for 60+ traveler . You should use this as your main transportation.

,,MRTS Singapore,5.0,,The best way to experience Singapore It connects every tourist attraction and connects you to the people and lifestyle of people .
,,SMRT - Easiest transport to travel in Singapore.,5.0,,MRT is one of the reliable major transport in Singapore that have exact timing in schedule & travel time and also the fastest way to travel between station. Most of the city country are connected with MRT and still developing new stations. SMRT also have buses that connects to rare area and payment is made with a single electronic money card.
,,Simple transportation,3.0,,Easy to use if you just want to get from point A to point B. Suffered some breakdowns recently due to years of incompetent management looking into its maintenance. Avoid peak hours if you can unless you enjoy getting squeezed. It's not as bad as rush hour in Tokyo though. Be prepared to wait some time during off-peak hours so best you plan your journey with time to spare.
,,Best mode of transport to go around Singapore,5.0,,"Ease of excess, vast network and good connectivity makes it the most reliable and affordable way to explore Singapore. User friendly system and generous helping staff makes it comfortable for first time visitors as well."
,,The fasted and efficient Trasport System,5.0,,Very efficient and economical for tourists who are visiting for 3-5 days. We took Singapore Pass for 3 days @ S$ 30 each. We could travel by bus or MRT. After completing the visit you can surrender your pass and get S$ 10 refund.
,,Piece of cake,5.0,,"Easy to get around. Fast, efficient, clean and cheap as chips. Nothing much else to say but trip advisor want at least 100 characters. 😁"
,,Great to get around,5.0,,"This is an outstanding service. It was very reliable, clean and efficient. The staff were all very helpful.

We had four traveling and got the MRT top up pass as opposed to the tourist pass.

Just remember you are getting four fares each time and a Grab may not be that much more say a few dollars.

However, a great system and useful to stay near by to an MRT stop."
,,SMRT,4.0,,Is a fast and cheap way to travel in Singapore. But of course sometime the train or tracks does break down. The SMRT officers are very good in managing the breakdowns and they do provide other means of transport to the next nearer station most of the time.
,,convenient,5.0,,I went to S'pore almost 3-4 times a year. Whenever I am in S'pore I like to use SMRT as I find it is so convenient to move around and it is not that costly... If I travel light m I shall travel via SMRT from Changi Airport down to Orchard Road to the hotel. It took 30 minutes approx to reach Plaza S'pore ...
,,Most convenient mode of travel,5.0,,"It's most convenient and cheap mode of transport . Almost every place of attraction or convenience is within walking distance. I spent less than $10 to and from the Changi airport to my place of stay. And I love the stretch of walk from Suntec City to the Orchard MRT -so many retail shops and eateries all the way, it was so pleasant. . But, avoid the peak hours unless you don't mind squeezing with school going kids and working adults."

You can use the cards on all forms of public transport.
If visiting Singapore forget taxis or Uber get on the public transport!"
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"Although there has been quite a number of breakdowns recently, Singapore's MRT system is still among the most efficient in the world, and one of the best in Southeast Asia. Compared to other MRTs in the region, the response time for emergencies as well as their protocols are just as impressive. You need to try it to believe it."

A daily or 3 day pass can be bought depends how long you are staying. Try to remember the line your using as they are colour coded depending on where your going and it gets busy. A great experience for a train service. Loved it, recomend."
,,Very efficient. Take you from and to the airport,4.0,,"Very efficient. Take you from and to the airport, for only 2.4 SGD each trip. At the city, each trip costs around 1 to 1,5 SGD.
I didnt understand why the ticket cards can be used multiple times... but no more than six; then you must dispose of it and buy a new one.
However, it closes operation too early, imo, around midnight. Stations are very clean. You will not see garbage .... neither garbage bins!
Frequency of trains is very good (2, 3 minutes,...)"
,,clean and efficient,5.0,,Once of the cleanest and most efficient services I used. Great alternative especially that your other option is Grab that can be quite unreliable.
,,Excellent safe and easy transit,5.0,,Used transit to get around city centre during day and in evening. Felt really safe and simple. We paid for single fares around S$1.50 for trips of around 6-7 stops and recharged cards for each journey. Never waited more than a minute for a train.

,,Easy. Efficient. Cheap.,4.0,,"These automated trains rival Japans for timely and efficient service.
Ticketing is straight forward and the standard ticket can be recharged for each trip. The trains are clean and except during peak times, have ample seats. All the stations we visited are serviced by elevators and escalators so seem to be completely accessible."
,,Don't get a taxi.,5.0,,"The first time I was in Singapore on business, I decided to get a taxi to avoid a possible mix-up. But that was a mistake. The airport is pretty far away from most places, so my taxi fare was almost 50 dollars. Little did I know, if I had taken the MRT, it would have been under five dollars. Later, when I did finally take the MRT, I was blown away by how tourist-friendly it actually is. The process is idiot-proof, which for me was a godsend. I must admit that I did end up wandering around Singapore lost for the good portion of that day, but at least the MRT got me in the right area!"

,,Efficient transport around the city,5.0,,"The SMRT has pretty good coverage of the city and it is my preferred mode of transport. Air conditioned carriages were kept immaculately clean and have good information display so you won't miss your station. Trains were scheduled quite frequently so waiting time was not long. If you were visiting, getting a tourist pass with specific duration of use would be a good option to save the trouble of buying ticket for each trip."

,,How public transport should be,5.0,,"Air-conditioned, regular and so clean! Everything is in English and it's easy to figure out the map too."
,,"Simple, Quick and Cheap",5.0,,"The MRT is by far the easiest way to get around Singapore, it is much easier than the London Underground. Buying tickets is easy and it is easy to top your cards up with money to allow to get around. Very clean. Be aware don't eat, drink or chew gum."
,,"Fast, clean, efficient & green!",5.0,,"Cars are pretty expensive to run in Singapore. Most people don’t need one, and here’s why .... the MRT is AMAZING!"
,,Amazing,5.0,,The SMRT system in Singapore is truly amazing. Was in Singapore for 2 weeks and it is by far the cheapest and easiest transit system I've used anywhere.
,,Best in the World,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, good coverage, with clear information. Travelled the World many times over, but no-one beats the MRT.

On this trip, got the EZ Link card and topped up periodically; they’re good for 5 years so it saves lots of individual ticket buying and they work on MRT and buses."
,,Excellent and easty,4.0,,"We traveled around with city on the MART, It is easy to understand and perfectly clean. All the cars are air conditioned as well as the entire walking areas. If you come from NYC, Chicago, Paris or any other large city with a ‘subway’’, this one will be a breeze."
,,Very clean and you can really go places,5.0,,"We purchased the 3 day Tourist Passes for SD$30 (which incl a $10 deposit), this gave us unlimited travel and boy did we use it. We renewed the card for our second 3 day period with no problems. We could have reclaimed our deposits but kept the cards as souvenirs (as we have with every travel card we've ever bought). The trains were timely and clean. Getting around is easy thanks to a well informed transit map."
,,Go anywhere quick and easy and cheap.,5.0,,Singapore MRT is frequent and very clean and well maintained. Stations are handy to everywhere you would need to go. Airport connection is exceptional. The system should run later. It stops at midnight making it challenging if you intend to stay out late. It also does not start until 06:00 so forget about early flights at Changi.
,,Always an amazing travel experience,5.0,,"We love the mrt system, use it every visit to Singapore. We bought the ezlink cards a few visits ago and top up each visit. Too easy! Extensions to the system are underway. The artwork at some stations is fantastic!"
,,Even Better Than It Used To Be,5.0,,"Strange to review a public transport system but having lived in Singapore 25 years ago when there was only the north-south and east-west lines it is wonderful to see how many new lines have been installed across the island.
Better still is the quality if the service, the speed and frequency and also for those people who are interested, the quality of the ride in the new lines.
Not too sure if it’s a permanent feature but they also have attendants at some of the busier stations to guide you to the correct train service. Fantastic!! Now that is what a public transport service should be like. Very impressed."
,,Brilliant,4.0,,"Clean, safe, smart, easy to navigate and quick service. Exactly what you need when travelling round this hot and humid city"
,,Excellent efficient transport,5.0,,"The MRT system is one of the best public transport systems I have experienced around the world.

Staff at the stations were always helpful and friendly."

no need for any taxi to go anywhere except to come and go to the airport with luggage
better avoid the morning and evening office rush hours on the MRT
get an EZ Link prepaid card at any MRT station to pay for your fare

,,24 hour tip to save $’s,5.0,,"A safe and economical way to travel throughout the city. Very convenient, clean, safe and easy to navigate. No long waits in between trains.

If you’re only in Singapore for 24 hours, purchase a single ticket and retain for up to 6 future trips as each trip receives a discount. Just hold the card on the reader each time to top up. Very economical."
,,Super easy to get atound,5.0,,This transit system moves around the city and is really easy to navigate. The rates seem reasonable too!
,,Efficient but getting worse,4.0,,"The Mass Rapid Transit is quite efficient. However, it is very crowded during peak hours (7-9AM and 6-8PM) and you might have difficulty boarding and alighting. Also, breakdowns are more frequent these days so be sure to check the status of the line/s that you would like to travel with."
,,Easy Access,5.0,,"Travelled on it several times in September 2018. The rail system and stations are easy to access and very clean. Obtaining tickets is very simple and easy to understand, with very helpful if needed. In my opinion the best way to travel around Singapore."

,,Probably the best metropolitan transportation system int he world,5.0,,"In my opinion this city-state’s public transportation system is comparable to a few toppest major cities such as Tokyo, Seoul, Hongkong, London, etc. Super-fast, super-clean, super-convineint, just super-everything"
,,Efficient and clean - buy a tourist pass for best value,5.0,,"A tourist pass for use on bus, MRT and LRT was the best option for us. The underground system (MRT) was very clean, fast and efficient. Your pass card can also give you a refund when you hand back the card. A standard ticket has a 10 cent deposit on it to encourage continued use - after three uses you get a 10 cent refund and after 6 trips you get a 10 cent discount."
,,Excellent public transport,5.0,,"The train system in Singapore is excellent. You do not need to hire a car as between the trains and the buses which are also excellent you can get everywhere you need to using a single pass.

The tra8ns are frequent and changes lines is easy, we used the MRT everyday we were in Singapore including to and from the Grand Prix."

For your short stay just purchase the single trip ticket which you can use up to 6 times and they will give you a small refund at your 6th purchase (discount) . For a longer stay you can get your pass at the mrt office in the station. Cheap and easy, just look at the map in the machine and and touch away...."
,,The only way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,Do yourself a favour and pick up an ez-link card or Singapore tourist pass. So cheap to get around (you can go from one end of the country to the other for $3.80 return) and always a nice feeling when you escape the heat and humidity of the street for the airconditioned comfort of the stations and trains. The stations have wifi access which is great for killing time (although you never have to wait very long for the next train). One word of warning...the ez-link cards will not allow you to enter a station with less than $3 on the card(even if the trip is only 77c)
,,Simple and effective,4.0,,The system goes by colored lines throughout the city. Pick a station and pay the price for single or round way. You use the ticket to go in and out of the station. Nice air-conditioned and clean. Good way to go around.
,,Great transport system,5.0,,"A fantastic transport system, cheap and easy to use. Get a multi day pass to make it easy. The rail system is big with direct access to Changi Airport which is a huge bonus. The monorail to Sentosa is also a good transport system, can be a bit overcrowded in busy times but overall good"

,,"Simple, inexpensive and efficient",5.0,,We spent 8 Days in Singapore recently. We toured the city on the MRT. It’s very easy to use with excellent signage and directions. Once you get the hang of it it’s wonderful. If only Melbourne had a system half as good.
,,Efficient,5.0,,A very good transport system. Inexpensive. Good signage and real time information like next stop and exit information.
,,Quick and easy way to get around (and not too expensive),4.0,,Very clean and easy way of transport in Singapore. The only caveat is that the network is not really extended so you might have to combine MRT with some walking to reach your destination.
,,Accessible to most areas in the country,5.0,,East directory and ticketing. Cheap fare facilitates all citizens. Carts are mostly clean and passengers are well behaved.
,,Very efficient public transport.,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for more than three days and need mobility, the MRT is simply the easiest way to travel. Get an EZ-Link pass and you are good to go on any MRT route and all bus routes. One of the best mass rapid transit in the world."

,,Efficient transport,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to travel around Singapore. Cheap and easy to get to where you want to go. We don't buy the tourist card, but just get the one that locals use daily as we come to Singapore often as this is more convenient. The trains come at very regular intervals and are clean."
,,Explorer,5.0,,"I seems a bit complicated at the begining as is a big chain of lines, however it is easy to use with the MRT and above the ground public transport. Fast efficient, cover all your needs and cheap"
,,Very clean and efficient,5.0,,"The transit system is very clean, on time and a bit crowded and expensive. Still I would prefer it over traveling via a taxi."
,,Very efficient and easy to use,5.0,,"Got around Singapore all by using the SMRT. There are tourist passes that you can purchase, but as I wasn't staying very long, I just purchased single passes, which worked well. The single ride cards require a 10cent deposit, which you get back if you reuse the card multiple of times.

Easy to use and affordable way to travel around Singapore. All the sights and visits were mostly feasible through this mode of transport.

Getting to/from the airport was also done with a breeze and economically."
,,Fast and convenient,5.0,,"The SMRT is very easy to navigate and is very safe, on-time, quiet and comfortable. I always feel at ease when I take the trains in Singapore. People are very courteous and quiet- even though most everyone is on a device doing something. Also make sure that you don’t eat or drink on the train as you may get stared at or even fined."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Purchase the visitor pass or ezlink reload card for seamless travel. Maps are clear, good connectivity among all the lines. Best way to travel around."

,,Worth experiencing,4.0,,"The SMRT keeps Singapore going. Its wonderful how they have the entire city bound with stations below every mall and attraction, well almost. They are well maintained and also an experience - although the number of frequent stoppages could annoy you a bit,"
,,Underground world,5.0,,So impressed with the transport in Singapore. Getting around after one day like a pro. Cheap efficient clean and something I wish OZ had. There are hardly any cars on the roads which are also great. Only thing I felt like most Singaporean’s spend their lives underground. After today even though I saw so much I spent lots of time with them in middle earth.
,,So easy....and cheap!,5.0,,"With the exception of the zoo, the MRT gets you everywhere easily & for just a few cents a ride. You never have to wait for more than a couple of minutes for a train & can almost always get a seat if you want one. One of the best rail systems we’ve encountered anywhere in the world."
,,No durians!,5.0,,"Seriously the cleanest metro system in the entire world. So clean you can eat off the floor. Never late, and always pleasantly air-conditioned. Don't forget to photograph the ""no durians"" sign!"
,,"Fast, Clean, Cheap and Reliable",5.0,,"A great experience on the MRP. Easy to get tickets, locate the platform, running all the time. Very clean, plenty of seats and price was exceptional. Safe and a great way to get around Singapore."
,,Couldn't be any easier to get around,5.0,,"After reading so many good reviews on TripAdvisor regarding Singapore's SMRT, we decided to use it to get around. Every place we wanted to visit (including Sentosa Island) was accessible by mass transit, (either by bus or train). It's clean, convenient, efficient and really really inexpensive. We spent about $20 each for the week we were there on transit.

My only complaint (minor though it is), is that the bus stations have teeny tiny numbers on their station signs, so unless you had a telescope, you really had to be on top of it to see what number it was. But that's just a minor complaint.

We used the site gothere.sg ALL THE TIME, and the app got us from Point A to Point B, flawlessly. Some of the bus routes were diverted because of the F1 race, but the bus drivers were always very patient in telling us how to continue our trip around their detours.

It's a great way to see Singapore and a great way to visit with the people. Highly recommended"
,,Fast & Efficient transport,5.0,,"A good network of train connections throughout Singapore. Fast and efficient transport at a fair price. Clean stations and railcars, so typical for Singapore."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,"Easy to use and plenty of stations. Keep the ticket and buy return ticket if you have a plan, often long lines in rush times."
,,"Efficient, clean and economical.",5.0,,"I traveled with my sister and we bought an EZ-link card at Changi Airport. It cost $12 with $5 of this being non-refundable. From Changi Airport to Fort Canning cost $1.75. There is a tourist pass which I think costs $10 but I think the EZ-link card even with $5 non-refunable is better value. The card can also be used on the buses.
The MRT is easy to use with announcements for each station."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"In comparison to the London Underground, the MRT system is a total dream. Easy to navigate, cheap and spotlessly clean"
,,Very well connected,5.0,,"The signs are so easy to follow. This is a wonderful MRT system, easy to travel to most popular places in Singapore"
,,Very Convenient,5.0,,Really Good mode of transport and very convenient. It is clear why they use public transport as oppose to having their own vehicle.

,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Cheap, fast, clean, frequent, comprehensive. Amongst the best city transport systems I've used. Easiest way to get around Singapore."
,,Best way,5.0,,Just use it cheap and easy. Grab an ezy pass around 12 dollars. Most rides will cost around 80cents plus grab a map to work out which line you will need very simple and all stations are air conditioned
,,"Easy to navigate, cheap fares",5.0,,"I took the MRT to/from Changi Airport, and rode trains and buses for 5 days. There is a tourist pass you can purchase ($30 for 3 days), however the service desk staff advised that this wouldn't be necessary, and I was confidently persuaded to purchase a pass with the same amount loaded. Not only was this enough, but on return on my last trip, any remaining fare was promptly refunded. The trains are very clean (and durian free!), air conditioned, and run within minutes of each other, so there is never a significant wait for the next one. The only challenge is at certain interchanges, there is quite a walk between lines, so be wary if you are traveling with heavy bags, or have accommodation close to the Downtown/East-West lines if you're traveling between the airport."
,,Easy to use and affordable,5.0,,Easy and great way to explore Singapore. Prices are very good too. You will find a lot of hidden gems in the MRT stations.
,,Fast and cheap,5.0,,Great way to get around the city. A/C within all the MRT. Very accessible. Easy to catch the buses as well.
,,SO CLEAN AND SO NICE,5.0,,"Wow okay, so I lived in New York for a few years and let me tell you the Singapore metro is seriously amazing. It’s so clean, so organized, and the stations & trains are air conditioned and there’s cellphone service on them."
,,Clean and easy to use,5.0,,"Very clean and easy to use , just bay a card at airport cost 10 dollar with 5 dollar to use, cheap to use"
,,Simply brilliant,5.0,,"Stayed in Singapore over the F1 weekend so as you can imagine, the city was pretty busy. Despite this, the MRT system coped really well. From leaving the F1 to the hotel took about 20 minutes. MRT stations are ideally situated and just, well work really well. From the airport to anywhere in the city it is so easy. Every city should take a look at this transit system. Clean, fast and very easy to use."
,,Getting around in Singapore,5.0,,"What an excellent transit system. Whether you're traveling by bus, train, walking, taxi or a combination of all you will never get lost. Upon arrival simply purchase a SIM data card and you will have 24/7 access to all the travel venues. Such a great, clean, efficient system they have developed. Open Google map or download the My Transport app. Can't beat it."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Just use, cheap visitor deals with refund on card once used. This is probably one of the best underground systems ever! It's a no brainer!"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Clean, tidy and efficient. My husband is disabled and we never needed to ask for help as it was politely offered and nothing was too much trouble. The doors on the platforms make the stations so much safer than those in the UK. It was also incredibly cheap."
,,good,5.0,,very good and easy system to use first ride or two takes time to get use to it but very easy to get around and cheap
,,SMRT is just great,5.0,,If you think you need to have a car in Singapore I just recommend you to think twice. There are so many metro lines and busses that you get everywhere in an adequate time as well as for very reasonable price.
,,The most efficient way to see the sights of Singapore,5.0,,"Without a doubt the MRT is one of the best public transport systems in the world.

All the major sight seeing attractions have an MRT station either under them or within a very short walking distance and even the stations underground are cool and air conditioned.

Our first trip to Singapore and worked out the MRT in a few minutes, everything is colour coded and numbered.

We purchased a 3 day tourist pass for $30 ($10 refunded when you return the card) and then just $20 per 3 days to top up. There are cheaper options for 1 or 2 days also.

Everything about it is so efficient and clean, love how the consumption of food and drinks are banned on here also.

The underground stations are so clean and easy to get around, the basic rule applies here also, when on an escalator keep left unless you are on the move walking up the steps with it.

Well worth it over the local taxi system and highly recommend it as the means of travel.

We had made prior transfer arrangements from the airport but next time we will just use the MRT at the airport."
,,Quick and easy,5.0,,"The MRT is easy to use and quick to get around. Trains every 2 to 4 minutes. Good signage no pushing and shoving designated seats for elderly etc. We used it from the airport into our accom and everyday until we went back to the airport. Cost us $20 each for the whole time we were there, 7 days. Got a ezicard which you top up when it tells you to. Awesome."
,,SMRT the easy way to travel,5.0,,"Using the MRT is simple, fares are not expensive, you even get a discount for adding trips to your initial ticket purchase.
Some journeys can be a little crowded at peak times - but where in the world isn't it.
Service is frequent and on time, facilities are like any where else in SG clean and respected."
,,Very good service,5.0,,"So easy to get around the city, fast, efficient, cheap and easy to use every city should have one. although can get very crowded."
,,Easy To Use,5.0,,Don't be afraid of using public transport in Singapore. Must say they are all over it and it would have to be the easiest way to travel around and inexpensive. Grab a tourist pass and travel all day. I was worried about trying this but it runs so well. Staff are so helpful and speak english so community is no problem. Australia could learn a lot from this public transport system
,,Geat transport system,4.0,,"This is the best transport system in singapore, you can go around anywhere easily using mrt. Just buy the prepaid card (12 sgd got 7 sgt credit)."
,,Best Public Transport in the World?,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a joy to use. Clean, (and I mean immaculately clean), safe, quiet, convenient, efficient, fast and cheap. There are no guards or even drivers. But there are subtlety dressed staff who magically appear whenever you need help."
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap transport",5.0,,"I just had 5 days in Singapore, and had 11 trips, so with transfers probably 20 different train trips. Every single one was efficient and I had no problems.There are seats for the elderly which were adhered to.
The signage is excellent, and the ticket machines are easy to understand.
On the normal 6 trip ticket you can not load a value on it, but you need to buy each trip as you do it, except for a return trip.
The ticket machine gives up to $4 change, which means you can’t put a $10 note in it, but $5 is fine for a $1.20 fare etc.
so ensure you always have small notes ( or coins ).
Many stations also list the nearby attractions and which exit to take which is a big help for tourists.
The new Downtown line has opened up many new stations making it convenient to go almost anywhere by MRT now rather than bus.
It’s a wonderful service."
,,World class,5.0,,"It doesn’t get much better than this. Singapore MRT is world class, compared to any other subway I have visited"
,,Cheap clean safe,5.0,,What a wonderful way to see Singapore. Its simple and cheap to use. We went to Changi airport for S$2.50 each ! Staff were always extremely helpful as were the locals

,,easy to use,5.0,,very easy to use clear signs numbered platforms did a whole day from kranji cemetery to changi prison local cans real close cheap easy way to get around info counter they all spoke English very well super clean and always gave the elderly a seat
,,Helpful to go everywhere,5.0,,"MRT is helpful for tourists to go somewhere. MRT stations exist near most of all famous and popular places for tourist. MRT trains brought me everywhere I would like to go. I bought three day tourist pass at Changi by $30 including $10 deposit after I arrived. It's not cheep, but was convenient for me during Formula One weekend."
,,Best train system I have been on,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is easy to use and get around to the sights of Singapore. We used it on our 3 day trip to visit various locations.
,,Excellent public transportation,5.0,,"Very clean, cheap, regular services, easy to use. English everywhere so you can buy tickets easily and work our which train to get on and off. Air conditioned so a great way to get around in the heat of Singapore."
,,The sign above the door shows you where you are going,5.0,,"Driverless (mostly) the signs above the doors show you which side to exit, the screen shows you which station you are approaching and you get pictures of the shops near-by and maps of the station. Such a well planned system."
,,very easy to use,5.0,,"I try to utilize the transit system whereever I go and Singapore was no different. You have to buy a MRT card initially and then you put a certain amount of money on the card. As time goes by and you utilize the card, you will have to put more money on the card. You are charged for the distance travelled, there is no one set fee for a MRT ride. The MRT is clean, efficient and timely-Digital boards tell you when your train is coming and there are arrow grids on the floor where people going into the train stand so people exiting can do so quickly and efficiently. There is no litter and at certain stations, there are people there who can assist if you are lost or are unsure as to which train to take. I loved it."
,,E.X.C.E.L.L.E.N.T,5.0,,"A great experience indeed! The service was great. It was clean and comfortable. Easy to navigate, and even if you're in doubt you can just ask the staff, they'd be happy to help you out.

Just in case you haven't been aware of this. The standard ticket can be used for a max of 6 trips. SGD 0.10 will be added to the total value when you but the ticket at the 1st time, will be returned back to you on your 3rd trip, and on the 6th trip you will get a SGD 0.10 discount! If you found yourself with some unused credit in your standard ticket, just go to the small office at every station and ask for a refund. They will give you the leftover credit in cash as long as it is within 3 days since the purchase date.

Happy travelling peeps! :)"
,,easy to use,5.0,,"used this for travelling to Grand Prix, was easy to find cheap for tickets and staff always helpfull. All ticket machines were easy to use and all in english would recommend if site seeing."
,,"Easy, clean, reliable, cheap!",5.0,,"The easiest public transport system ever! You can buy a tourist pass for a few days, or a standard card that you can top up as needed from the counter at the station.

It’s so easy to use, and you feel so safe. It’s clean, reliable and such a simple way to travel around Singapore. The exits are clearly signed, and most main MRT stations seem to have some shopping /food mall attached."
,,Fast clean trains and service,5.0,,"Used the trains during the GP weekend - as the streets were blocked off for the GP.

The MRT was the fast and inexpensive way to travel using the equivalent to an Oyster card. I found the staff very courteous in explaining the routes and the fare costs and destinations. On one trip to the bird park, I needed to ask the station staff to direct me to the bus - again very helpful.

The MRT is a great asset for visitors to Singapore.

,,Easy to use,5.0,,"The MRT system is very easy to use and so convenient. The map is a familiar style and easy to read. MRT staff at stations were helpful,friendly and polite. The whole system is very clean."
,,So easy to use ...,5.0,,"Easy, fast, clean, cheap .. amazing way to get around the city, would recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore"
,,Superb Cheap Clean Easy to use System,5.0,,We brought a travel card which gives access to MRT and Bus services. MRT is spotlessly clean and easy to use. Dont forget to stand at the front of the MRT to see this driver less system at its best whizzing under the city while looking out the front of the train will make the price of the ticket worth while.
,,Fantastic system,5.0,,The MRT is really cheap way of getting around Simgapore. It's also really easy to use and very clean. If you're staying for a while I recommend buying the EZ Link card as the cost of each trip is cheaper than paying for a standard return. I reckon you only have to make 3-4 return trips to recoup the 5$ it cost to buy the card. Well worth it.
,,excellent,5.0,,Easy to use system for purchase of tickets. We used the system for 5 days and all were on time. Females were very helpful and courteous regarding seats.
,,Easy and effective,5.0,,"Easy and affective way of travelling. Much more spacious than London tubes. I brought a 3 day tourist pass for $30 which gives you unlimited travel for the duration and is worth it if your spending your days site seeing around Singapore. The doors stay open for 1min. I’m from London and our tube doors stay open for 30 seconds for people to get on so you have much more time and don’t need to run! But if you have a long journey to take, it’s worth knowing that you need to add on a minute between stops on top of your travel time if your going somewhere in a rush!"
,,MRT visitors pass,4.0,,"We opted to buy a 3 day visitors pass after using the MRT a couple of times and finding it hard to upload the ticket as you can only do it using small notes and change. The visitors card was so much easier. Unlimited travel for 3 days from the day of activation. It ends on midnight on the third day you use it. $30 but you get $10 back once you return the card as a deposit.

Great value although be warned you can only buy from certain stations. Chinatown being one not sure of the other locations but the ticket booths will let you know which. We specifically asked if we could return to any station and was told we could so we went ahead and bought it, they give you a booklet with a map and information of where you can buy and it states it can be return at any station. However we couldn’t get a ticket man to return ours at our local station on the last night. He refused and said only Chinatown or airport. So we now have two Singapore visitors cards worth $20 in our suit case.

The trains run smoothly on time and the cleanest ever. No eating or drinking is allowed. Not even a sip of water and everyone abides by this locals, tourists and employees. The maps are easy to read and navigate."
,,Easiest Way to Get Around,5.0,,"The MRT is the quickest, cheapest, and most convenient way to get around Singapore. Like the London Tube, the MRT is easy when you've figured out how it works. And that's simpler than the Tube.
The trains are fast and frequent (every 3-4 min) and connect to most places, including Changi Airport.
You may have to stand, but not for long.
If you do need help, the staff and security people are very friendly and helpful.
Give it a go"
,,EVERYTHING WORKS WELL IN SINGAPORE AND SO DOES THIS.,4.0,,Boring but terribly reliable and reasonable value. Comfortable enough but distances and times are not great so the real advantage is there are few que's
,,Very convenient and affordable,5.0,,"It is very neat and clean. Well connected to important places, not expensive at all (cheapest way to travel) and not crowded."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Super fast, reliable, cheap, frequent - so many positives. We never waited more than about 4 minutes at any station. Much better than railways in Australia!"
,,Bloody Brilliant!,5.0,,"Can't talk too highly of this system - avoid the tourist 3 day pass and get a regular card and top up as you go. We used the system to get all around Singapore. its clean , fast, timely and reliable. Staff are super helpful."
,,Singapore’s MRT,5.0,,"I was nervous to try the public transport and when I did I was so impressed how easy, inexpensive and fast it was to use. I was also thoroughly impressed with the consideration the Singapore MRT users were to the elderly and needy. Thank you Singapore!!!"
,,"Clean, efficient, safe",5.0,,"Singapore gives you the choice to buy a tourist pass or the ‘ez link’. We went for the latter since we were going to be in Singapore for a week. The card costs $S12 but that covers a $5 deposit for the card and pre- loaded fare of $7. You get charged by the distance you travel. We found it easy and cheap, but then we are used to London travel. We did a lot of travelling before we had to reload our cards. Every time we went underground we found relief from the heat of Singapore and found getting around fast and easy. There is always someone around to help if you get lost."
,,Best commute option,5.0,,If in Singapore you want to travel MRT is the best. It's quick and economical. Entire city is very well connected by MRT Just take the map and follow the lines one can then easily commute.
,,getting arround couldnt be easier,5.0,,"Bought a 3 day pass for the MRT which is completely safe to use and easy to follow. We found each location we searched for very easily,"
,,SMRT - Cheap and easy,5.0,,It was easy to buy a reloadable ticket - S$12 which included S$7 in fares. Able to reload in S$10 lots. Biggest surprize was that most trips undertaken only deducted 77cents per trip.
,,"A bit confusing, but timely",3.0,,"It does look confusing a bit and not all the employees are very helpful either. Some of them i felt were downright rude when I wanted to find my way around. But i did find a few good service personnel and they did make my life and trip easy. The single trip ticket can be used multiple times.

Just know were to go and key in your location at any kiosk in the station and it shows the price and you receive a ticket.

Coming from a tourist hub like Dubai, i did expect better service and coordination from the MRT staff, but this seems to be aimed more at the convenience of the residents than tourists."
,,Easy and Economical to use - Reminds me of the London Tube,5.0,,"Quick, Cheap, Easy way to get around Singapore. Very similar to the London tube, not as crowded though! Give it a try - you will be glad you did!!"
,,"Fast,Cheap and Efficient",5.0,,Best way to travel round Singapore. Trains come approximately every 2 minutes. But prepare to walk a long way inside the stations.
,,Only Way To Travel In Singapore,5.0,,"Super clean, reliable and efficient. Trains run regularly and on time. There are maps everywhere throughout the system and the ticket booths are easy to use, but don't accept any note higher than a 5SD. You can top up your card or pay for single journey, when you swipe your card the machine will tell you your credit. If you need help staff speak good English and are keen to help. Most stations have many shops inside. There is free wifi throughout the system."
,,Moving with MeRT,5.0,,The Mass Rapid Transit System in Singapore operates with efficiency and cleanliness. Simple to navigate and easy to find stations.
,,The only way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,Do yourself a favour and get a ezlink card. So cheap to get around. A word of warning..the ezlink cards will not allow you to enter the station with less than $3 on the card(even if the trip is only 77c)
,,Reliable and convenient,4.0,,"I enjoy the MRT for getting around the city and for commuting. Compared to other cities and countries, it is simple to find your way around the network, pricing is reasonable and trains depart regularly and usually run on schedule."
,,Use the SMRT while in Singapore,5.0,,"When in Sigapore use the local train system. You can buy day passes or weekly passes. Or just buy a standard ticket and top it up. The trains are clean and safe, the network is easy to follow. Be prepared for crowds if you travel at peak times. A lot less expensive than catching cabs all over the city.

Bad cats of Brissy"
,,The best in the world,5.0,,"Traveled extensively across the world travel systems, and this underground is light years ahead on London especially.
Very wide trains- driverless, informative, clean, also they fine anyone with food on there-$1000 Very very secure even late at night, CCTV on the trains inside.
A great experience"
,,International quality travel,5.0,,"The Travel in SMRT is amazing the trains are clean , pleasant and punctual. They are relatively less crowded even in the peak hours. A must and best way to travel in Singapore."
,,Snooth,5.0,,"Extremely efficient, super cheap and clean. Staff are very friendly and the trains run regularly. Forget the cabs and traffic jams, give it a whirl!"
,,"Efficient, Clean & Safe",5.0,,"This is the best way to travel around Singapore. There are four major lines, along with some smaller ones, that will take you most anywhere you desire to go. All the major attractions and places of interest will have a MRT (or LRT) station nearby. You can buy a time limited pass (2 or 3 day) or a card to pay as you go which is rechargable. Everything runs efficiently on a succinct schedule. If you happen to just miss the metro you want, the wait will be short until the next one arrives. They are air conditioned and stop at convenient locations such as China Town, Little India, Marina Bay, Botanical Gardens, etc... to make your visit enjoyable without the hassle to find parking. You can easily transfer between the major lines at intersecting hubs. People are respectful and give their seat to elder or handicapped individuals. No eating or drinking is allowed in the metro cars. Yes, there are rush hour times when it can be crowded, but it's not overwhelming. Multi-lingual signs and maps are posted everywhere along with occasional info centers or agents to help you. We used the MRT system for our two week stay and only had a positive experience. Other major cities would do well to learn and implement such an efficient, clean and safe transportation system as Singapore has, then the world would be a better place."
,,Excellent Service,5.0,,"This is one of the cleanest, safest subway systems I have ever used. Other countries should take notes on how to operate a more efficient underground that people feel comfortable riding."
,,"Frequent, Spotlessly clean and Safe",5.0,,Get a three day 'Tourist Pass' plastic card for $S 20+$S 10 deposit (refunded after or on the expiry day) and travel system (island wide) anytime day or night and that includes the frequent bus services that reach less accessible places and attractions. One day passes are available too. There is no eating or drinking allowed on the trains thus all are spotlessly clean and safe as everyone is courteous to each other. The stations are well staffed with knowledgeable and friendly staff. Every underground/transit system in the world should aspire to be like this.
,,Only way to travel the island,5.0,,"Cheap, easily accessible, clean. You never have to worry about security on the MRT, and many of the stations are underground and air conditioned."
,,Still good,4.0,,"This is our second time in Singapore, and though this time we stayed on Sentosa, we still used the SMRT a lot. It's easy, reliable and gets you almost anywhere."
,,"Brilliant, couldn't fault it",5.0,,"What can I say other than well lit, modern, reliable, frequent, safe, clean and cheap. The London Underground and Paris Metro should take lessons."
,,Hey LUL take a look at how good it can be,5.0,,"The MRT system is modern, simple to use, spotlessly clean, quick, on time, and well lit. The “next station” display/announcement system on the trains is very clear. Travel is also very cheap and their version on the Oyster card is as simple to use and to top up as ours is. The MRT is a great way to travel."
,,Simple and easy to use,4.0,,"2.90SGD from the airport to the centre of the city in about 20 minutes-probably faster than a taxi.
The MRT is efficient and simple to use and takes you to most of the city. A day pass is much cheaper if you are using it very much."
,,WOW!,5.0,,"The MRT is fantastic. On time, all the time. Immaculately clean. Good staff. Clean signage - easy to navigate. Easy to use ticketing. Could do with more ticketing machines though."
,,Efficient and clean,4.0,,Singapore's subway is modern. It is very clean and efficient. I believe we paid around $5 for our day pass. It is a good way to get around to the must see in Singapore but you may want to plan a little on a map in advance.
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"SMRT is the heart of Singapore travelers. It's easy to find, great connections between metro and bus, and cheaper than any other mode. Very clean and comfortable."
,,Great and easy way to travel,5.0,,"Wow such an easy way to travel, so easy to get about. Easy to use prepaid cards and super clean trains."
,,Awesome Service,5.0,,"Fantastic service, quick, easy to navigate, clean, great signage. Would highly recommended to any traveller."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Clean efficent and value for money. Great way of getting quickly and safely around the city. Auto tocket machines work well but check the rules on cash needed
,,Tourist friendly commute in Singapore,5.0,,"An excellent service, found better, newer and modern as compared with London's underground, also called tube. Good connections and value for money."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Best ever public transport i have ever been on. Cheapest too. Waited no more than 3-5 minutes for a train, and 5 - 6 minutes for a bus. Remarkablehow they are so efficient. The rest of the world could learn alot on public transport from Singapore."
,,Straightforward and cheap too!,4.0,,"It's a fast, cheap and convenient way to get around Singapore. If you use the public system in the UK, you'll be able to easily navigate their metro. They have it coloured like the UK. The red line, yellow line which is also called central line, purple line and blue line. We took the metro from city hall to china town after watching the F1 grand prix in Singapore. One return journey cost 1.60 SKD. They also use a card similar to oyester card. However as a tourist you can buy a card which takes 10cent deposit and you can use the cars for up to a maximum of 6 trips. Easy and convenient way to travel as taxis can be quite expensive. Having used the taxi a couple of times as there is a 3.90 SKD instant charge if you flag down a taxi so we decided to use the metro after using the taxi. There are maps all over the station. There is also a security check point where you can be called randomly for a bag search."
,,The only way to get around,5.0,,This most efficient (and clean) metro service will take you to all the key sights during your stay. If you buy a three day pass it's definitely value for money and it can be purchased from the station at the airport.
,,Best Public Transport,5.0,,"Surprisingly cheap and incredibly efficient, hands down the best way to get around Singapore. The best public transport system I've ever used"
,,Clean and convenient!,5.0,,I love taking Singapore train. It is cheap and convenient to go places. I like the fact that the riders or most of the people are very respectable and disciplined. Always falling in line and waiting for the others to get out of the train before boarding. What a very good example to others. I hope other nationality will be inspired by how the Singaporeans are so disciplined.
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"SMRT is the cleanest, most reliable, comfortable, user friendly transport service I have ever travelled on. It's the way to go getting around Singapore."
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,The MRT was a great way to get around Singapore. The auto traffic like any large city is a nightmare. The MRT was clean and fast and inexpensive. The only way to get around town.
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"The MRT is great. Easy to use, not expensive, clean and safe. Highly recommended for visitors. Australia could take some lessons in how to do mass transport...."
,,Best Transportation system,5.0,,I feel home every time I go to singapore cos MRT system is so convenient and efficient. Taxies are expensive in singapore and best way to travel around is MRT. If you are tourist get a tourist pass depending on the says you stay. This can be taken from Changi Airport station. It’s very cost effective and you get unlimited journeys. And you don’t need to waste your time standing in the queues to purchase tickets. Get a MRT map and this will guide you to all the places you need. Enjoy
,,Reliable and affordable form of transport,4.0,,Been rather impressed with the punctuality/reliability of the SMRT trains especially on the Circle Line and Downtown Line.
,,A week in Singapore 🇸🇬,4.0,,This was our main mode of transportation while in Singapore. Its very convenient and reliable. We managed to move from Tanjong Pagar to so many other stations with ease. Will definitely use it again.
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is very efficient, clean and easy to navigate. A great way to get around Singapore. The trains leave in short frequencies so one never waits long and you can get quite quickly from one end of Singapore to the other. The MRT stops cover all major areas of interest for tourists, like MBS, Orchard etc."
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,"I visited some of Singapore's landmarks through SMRT. It's fast, efficient, and clean. You're also informed of the time when the next train will arrive. I also tried riding it to the airport bringing a huge luggage, I thought I'll have a hard time, but it was a breeze. Instead of spending S$12 taking a cab, it only cost me less than S$2."
,,Best in the World,5.0,,"There are cheaper options but the Singapore Tourism Card is really convenient and allows you seamless use of the Singapore public transport system, and with trains every 2 - 5 mins you get to were you want to go fast."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Singapore MRT is the best way to get around Singapore. Trains come every few minutes so you never have to wait long.
,,"Amazing, efficient and cheap",5.0,,"First trip to Singapore in May 2018 and a little bit daunted about how to get around. Turned out to be an absolute breeze. We stayed at the Carlton Hotel opposite the Raffles Centre which has 2 MRT stations underneath it and another a few minutes walk along Victoria Parade. The MRT is unmanned with automatic trains turning up every 5 minutes to the air conditioned platforms. It's is quick, clean, comfortable and most trips cost less than SGD$2.00 each way. Virtually everywhere is covered by the MRT with our only bus connection being to the Singapore Zoo which is a shuttle service every 15 minutes from right outside an MRT station. Absoutely amazing. Australia and I suspect much of the rest of the world could learn a lot from a system like this. I recommend that tourists get the reloadable cards which are available from airports and selected MRT stations through you can pay by the trip via machines. Only small criticism is that although all the signs are in English it can still be a little confusion when changing trains. However if you miss a train it's only a couple of minutes til the next one - relax and enjoy the experience!"
,,the ever efficient rapid transit system,5.0,,"one of the best in the world, always on time and super efficient. this is a model system that many other cities strive towards."
,,Does the job!,5.0,,"Clean. modern, on time, frequent, and cheap...what more could you ask for from a MRT system? Oh and stations are great and easy to navigate"
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Very easy to figure out and very inexpensive. If you will be in Singapore more than a couple of days take the time to learn the system as it will allow you to see much more on your visit.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Once we discovered that the train station (Espanade) was right next to our hotel (Marina Mandarin), we used it daily. Before we arrived, we had read about the MRT but were unsure exactly what it was and how easy it was to use.

We were in Singapore for 4 nights and the cheapest option is to pay for a travel card, which from memory cost 10 - 12 SGD, however, housed within the charge is an admin fee. However, as your travel is discounted because you use the card, you will make the admin fee back, so it is cheaper. You can then load the cards at the station if you need to add more funds, although the minimum was 10 SGD. One downside is that although we had some credit on the cards, when it got below a few dollars, we were prevented from travelling, I presume because, if taking a longer journey, the credit on the card would not cover this. We were told that we can get refunds on any credit left over from any station, but we ended up just bringing the cards home as a sort of souvenir, although, I believe they make be valid for a few years should we visit again.

Singapore needs to promote the MRT a little better and make it clearer for tourists as it is very efficient, clean, cheap and easy to use!"
,,Efficient,5.0,,Efficient and logical as always. My first choice in travel when I am in Singapore. Now the network is comprehensive and covers lot of locations. SMRT App will help people as well.
,,very useful,5.0,,the way it functions is very clear and well thoughtful. you even can get refund for tickets not used completely.
,,The best way to travel.,5.0,,I have used taxis’s and Uber to get around Singapore but the MRT is by far the bestway to get around. The trains are clean and fully air conditioned. Also 4G connectivity. Stations are also clean and well staffed. The signage is simple so navigating to the different parts of town is easy. Purchase a NETS Card for $12 and you get $7 credit put in the card. You can top the card up at stations when you need more credit. It’s much cheaper than buying single trips. Cost is $0.77 for most city centre trips and less than $2 from the airport to the Centre of town. Much cheaper than a taxi and probably quicker due to traffic. Uber approx $20 but will depend on the time of day and traffic.
,,Efficient,5.0,,I ride this train daily. It is the most efficient and very commuter friendly. I would not mind riding the train especially SMRT
,,Couldn't Be Easier,5.0,,"Skip the taxi and take the MRT instead. When I arrived at the airport, I was a clueless foreigner and had to meet a business contact near the Ion Orchard mall. I heard from a co-worker that if I had taken a taxi, it would have cost me $35. I thought the MRT would be confusing, but it really couldn't be easier - and it only cost me about $4. The ticketing kiosks are easy to navigate, and the color-coded lines make it impossible to get lost or confused. Like everything else in Singapore, the process is very friendly to English speakers, and even as an American, I can tell you that it is much, much simpler than subway lines in major cities. After using the MRT to see the whole city, I have never witnessed a delay. It is incredibly fast and efficient, and only costs a bit of pocket change."
,,Convenient way to get around.,5.0,,"The MRT system has been a saviour for me, being able to get around the city with such ease and very cheaply has ment i can visit all the places on my list. Trains and stations are super clean and easy to navigate around. Trains are very frequent less than a 5 minute wait every time."

,,An exciting experience,5.0,,"This transportation really helpful, fast, and easy to understand. It's a memorable experience for a first timer like me."
,,Efficient but crowded,4.0,,"MRT's are the fastest and cheapest way to get ard Singapore. But avoid peak periods. Will be crowded. And everyone reading this, it would be good to observe some social etiquette while travelling. Reduce noise levels and talking loudly. We are all responsible."
,,Clean and Comfortable Public Transportation,5.0,,"Singapore's train system is a reasonably efficient way to get from one part of the island to another.

The network has come a long way since starting in 1987 and there sufficient stations to ensure one can usually take the train to one's destination in air-conditioned comfort, without traffic jam hassles and for no more than $2.50.

While there is the infrequent breakdown and peak hours can get pretty crowded, the trains generally run frequently and quickly enough.

No eating or drinking is allowed on trains and in stations which has helped keep both very clean and pleasant."
,,Singapore Underground transport,5.0,,Probably one of the better mass transit systems in the world. Clean and well maintained. Ride in air condition comfort in this tropical island. With the spread of net work in the past couple of years and more to follow the whole island is well connected to all the places of interest. Well marked / indicated and ideal for tourist.
,,Easy way to travel,5.0,,"As a person that would normally catch a taxi when visiting Singapore I have now converted to the MRT. from the ease of ticket purchasing to the clean trains, it is the only way to travel for me now."
,,The fastest and cheapest way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"SMRT is one of the best train services that I have experienced so far.

,,Best public transport,5.0,,"Best ,fast,clean transport and very safe We got the three day tourist pass and use it day and night best way to travel we even got the train to go to the airport ."
,,One of the best if not the best city rail systems I've experienced!,5.0,,"Put simply the MRT is easily the best way to get around anywhere in Singapore. Totally understandable system and comprehensive in coverage, we managed to cover many of the sights of Singapore in 2 days easily. Trains every 5 minutes means the whole system is turn up and go.

And of course it all appears totally modern clean and Singapore efficient. For those like me and the many small boys I joined you can go to the front of train and pretend to be the driver as the driverless trains make their way through the tunnels"
,,Best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,Transportation is cheaper than a lot of places. It covers the island in all directions. A vending machine issues tickets in many languages and is easy to use with coins and cash. We loaded one trip at a time to allow for changes as we traveled around.

,,Tourist pass,4.0,,"We bought the tourist pass for $30SGD each. The $30 includes a $10 refund once the card is returned after expiry. It includes unlimited travel on the train, bus and light rail for 3 days. The train is easy to use and reliable. The bus is also easy. Google maps helped us plan the best routes to get from A to B. We also appreciated that Singapore is a nice walking city, and did so at times too."
,,So Easy and Efficient,5.0,,Most countries could learn a thing or two about this amazing transport system. So clean. 100% efficient. Very cheap and easy to use. Download CityMapper on your phone! Also amazing to help guide you through public transport in Singapore!

,,Easy to use and mega clean subway system,5.0,,"On arrival I knew my hotel was off centre so I would need to use the transit system. I am not always confident on these things in different countries so was a bit worried. Initially I got stuck with the ticket machines! The credit card reader did not take my card and I only had $10 and that was rejected. I think they take a maximum of $5. I gave up and went to a ticket office and a helpful girl told me about the 3 day tourist pass for $30. You pay $40 but get $10 back in return of card. Once I had that she helped me with my route and I found it fairly easy to get to the correct platform and could change train lines too quite easily to reach where I wanted to go. Trains are spotless, big and open carriages. I felt very safe and even though busy at times never felt overwhelmed or uncomfortable. For me I usually used part of the purple North East line and the blue Downtown. If I can do it anybody can!"
,,Reliable and really easy to use,5.0,,"When in Singapore feel free to use the SMRT transportation system as often as possible. I do recommend the double decked buses (no need to pay extra for tours) and the metro system.

They've added so much more stations now so it'll practically get you anywhere in Singapore. Must say they've much more efficient than a lot of other Metros in this world."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"The trains are almost always on time, clean, and not smelly. THe only downside is that they don't run in the night time."

,,"Use it! To easy to use, so efficient, so reliable",5.0,,"Where ever you come from: Use the MRT! Hard to find a better, easier to use, safer and more reliable system anywhere in the world"
,,An excellent way to travel around the city !!,5.0,,"We started our 4 day stay in Singapore by taking the MRT from Changi to our hotel near Bugis junction. Ticketing was simple provided you have small notes $2/$5 or coins and fares are cheap. However two short trips are required before you can connect with either the Downtown line (Blue) or the East/West line (Green) which take to the most popular hotel areas. We subsequently used the MRT most days without problems - efficient, clean and just what we would expect in modern Singapore."
,,Great Transportation system,5.0,,"Was in Singapore for vacay and found the MRT to be very convenient, cost efficient and easy to use. I highly recommend visitors to use the MRT to get around."
,,Very efficient system,4.0,,"The MRT is quite efficient, though there are a few places it doesn't cover well - for example, East Coast Park. Unfortunately, the MRT doesn't offer day passes unlike many cities."

,,Singapore’s MRT,5.0,,"While I was in Singapore I have used the MRT daily. The trains a very clean, frequency is great, about every 4 minutes on all lines. There are plenty of stations, and it is inexpensive. I purchased a Tourist Card for three days which cost at the time S$30 and you get S$ 10 back if you return the card. By the way the trains are driverless, fully automatic."
,,Well-connected and on time,5.0,,"As per the common perception of Singapore, even the trains are perfect, running on time and well-maintained. An extremely useful and economical way of traveling in Singapore- highly recommend it."
,,Nice experience,4.0,,This public transport system is very nice. People are also pretty helpful and guide new people like me
,,Amazing,5.0,,Really easy to use and runs with perfection. We felt completely at ease using this service. It was something like 10 dollars for a full day pass to use as many times as you like. Remember no food or drink in the stations or the trains unless you want a 500 dollar fine. Obviously this means it is spotlessly clean.
,,Just excellent,5.0,,It is simply the best and cheapest public transport in the world. Don't waste your money on a taxi. You can reuse your ticket up to 6 times. Just remember cash. They don't take credit card at all the stations.
,,Best of Class,5.0,,"Have used subway systems all over the world, including NYC (shudder), Moscow, London, Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong... I think the Singapore system may be the best, beating out Hong Kong. Clean, very easy to use, very well signed."
,,Very convenient mode of travel when in SIN,5.0,,Book a hotel close to a MRT when travelling to SIngapore. The MRT system here has many lines connecting to all places. Very cheap and convenient. saves time and money too.

,,Excellent train service,5.0,,"Easy to use train service, you can get pretty much anywhere. Clean (you get fined if you eat or drink)"
,,Best way to see the Country,5.0,,"The MRT is the best option to get to your destination no matter where it is. I say that because we stayed in the outskirt yet visited almost all the main attractions in Singapore using the this mode of transportation.

If you’re staying a week, better purchase the pass that’s good for a week, if not get the daily card but do not throw it away. Re-use it because you will get a 10cents Singapore money refund on your 6th ride.

If you get lost, fear not, anyone there can help you, or just look up the map which is visible in all stations or you can look at the tv just overhead where the track is, they will flash the route or direction it is going so you will not be lost.

They also are very friendly to elderly, cause they have a designated place for them, if not, someone will always offer a seat for the senior citizens like my mom, which is why she is so impressed.

Sorry I don’t have any photos on the MRT."
,,Well connected,5.0,,"The MRT was located very close to our hotel, it was very clean, took a bit of time to figure out the self ticket kiosk but managed some how. Make sure to read the signs for the different lines and follow them accordingly so that u don;t end of getting lost. Its another experience in itself, kids enjoyed their ride."
,,Worth thew trips,5.0,,"Just to see how a railway system can be run efficiently, effectively and comfortably is an eye opener. Lots for our railway mangers to learn and implement!"
,,Public Transportation around Singapore,3.0,,"One of the easy way to go around Singapore, but don't expect high speed with this.
A budget and cost saving way travelling around SG other than public buses.
It can take you to almost every where in SG even to the major tourist attractions.
Just grab a map in the airport or at the SMRT station, it will shows u the direction and the colour line that u need to take to get u around.

There is however, a small downside of this...
Frequency of breaking down will be expected especially during rainy day.
The speed of the train may also be slower in wet weather.

Avoid super peak hours in the morning from 7am to 9am and evening about 5.30pm to 8pm... especially interchange station. the crowd can be crazy..."
,,Best form of transport in Singapore.,5.0,,"For getting around quickly in very clean well maintained underground trains, this is the way. 3day visitor pass $20 plus $10 deposit on the card. Great complex and very regular service."
,,Clean fast efficient easy,5.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore outside of taxis. Clean, safe , air conditioned and very efficient. Found it easy to navigate and to buy tickets."
,,Incredible well connected and easy to understand,5.0,,"You can get anywhere you want in Singapore. There are Service Centers in every station, no way to loose!"
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,Singapore should be justifiably proud of their SMTR. Ver very clean and safe many stations in the right locations. Easy to use and follow
,,A super duper fast experience,5.0,,During my recent Singapore trip we opted for MRT journey over taxi and bus as we found it more convenient and comfortable too.. it’s easy to reach all the major local excursions and also easy to change the line if u understand all the signs and know where to go exactly just follow the line changing signs ... they have made it very simple and so easy that anyone can use it without any problem even if a tourist .. we purchased Singapore pass which gave us unlimited travel in train bus and LRTS .. this pass is more cheap and makes sense too.. MRT.. it’s clean from inside and people are well behaved too and offers seats to you as well as the needy.. which is like the best thing.. plus if u r stuck anywhere then u can go to the information counter where they will help u in terms of giving u right direction for your destination with a map also they help a lot to tourist.. they r very helpful and good people as I experienced..
,,good,5.0,,good experience but sometime it late than bus coz. it's not direct so you make sure bus first. clean !
,,"Amazing ! Fast, clean, affordable",5.0,,"We had reservations of using the SMRT as we are under a time schedule however when we got to the airport we were feeling a little adventurous and thought let’s go for it!

So glad we did! At first we were a bit confused but a local man saw the confusion on my face and explained where to go and what to do ( thank you kind man).

We got a 3 day tourist pass which has cost us $30 but you get $10 back when you return your card at the end of it.

Very quick, immaculate, air conditioned and there is plenty of space.

I grew up in northern England where the train transport is very slow, expensive and unclean and I have just spent some time living in Sydney so this is a nice surprise for me!"
,,Limited,3.0,,"It didn't go where I needed to go. It's very limited in scope compared with metro systems in other major cities, London, Paris, or Hong Kong."
,,Singapore Public Transport MRT,5.0,,This is the most common transport in SG beside buses and taxi. It's is fully air conditioning and you could download an aps or collect a map from the station control. Tourist there are day pass kindly check with the ticket counter for more information. If you just want to enjoy a single trip you can buy from the automated ticket machine. For frequent trip you are advise to buy an adult/child tickets which allow you to travel in both MRT and buses too.
,,So quiet...,5.0,,SMRT makes travel around this lovely city quick and easy...and after time in China the major draw was the near-complete lack of crowds.
,,"Great service, quick transport, easy to plan trips & cheap",5.0,,"MRT stations are everywhere in Singapore. Transport is really cheap, quick and clean. Felt very safe and using the Ez Link card access was quick and so simple. Great service and great price."
,,MRT not recommended for the people in a family of 4 or more.,3.0,,"If you are in Singapore with a family of 4 or more better to get into taxi (local red or blue or grab through app). Of course you will be saving a lot of valuable time.

It's really difficult to reach station east/west and crazy to be in line for tickets."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"We were encouraged to try the SMRT by a member of our hotel staff. We had been lucky enough to visit Singapore before and now wanted to enjoy it at a more leisurely pace. Our 3 day ticket cost 20 SGD ( currently around £12 ) they also charge an extra 10 SGD deposit which is refundable when you return your used card. Like everywhere in Singapore, the SMRT is spotlessly clean and very safe. It's easy to use and will have you whizzing around like a local in no time at all. Most major attractions are situated very near SMRT stations."
,,"Fast, clean and efficient",5.0,,"Easy to navigate the MRT system with clear signs in English. Stations are modern, clean and orderly. If you are going to be in Singapore for a few days get a Singapore Tourist pass for unlimited travel which will save you from having to find cash for each trip. Trains are frequent and go to all the tourist locations which makes is getting around so much more pleasant than having to walk long distances in the heat."

,,Convenience public transportation,5.0,,"SMRT has a lot of station so its easy to reach, the ticketing machine easy to use, cheap fare, clean, safe and fast"
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,I visit Singapore often and just love to use the SMRT to get around the city. As long as you don’t have to take it during peak hours it’s the best way to get around. During the peak hours the trains do get very crowded so you end up having to stand and wait more but at all other times it’s very comfortable. The cost is very reasonable and you can travel all over Singapore as there are several different lines you can catch. Once you get used to it you can easily figure out the transferring from one train to the next.
,,Easiest public transport system,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is very efficient and easy to follow, while there are sometimes random delays, the government has been doing rapid upgrades to the lines to prevent these. Cheapest (besides bus) and fastest way to get around. Most major attractions are also connected by the train."
,,Rapid Transportation,5.0,,One thing I am amazed about Singapore is how fast and convenient moving around the city-state is. Definitely saves time for tourists like me.
,,Expanded now so good connections,5.0,,Best to buy a top up card rather than individual journeys to get best value. Highly affordable way if getting around with an airport station too. Services most of the main attractions although I dont think nlthe zoo as there is no station nearby
,,Great mode of transport,5.0,,"Quick, efficient and cheap way to travel. The service is most efficiently run. It connects with all the tourist attractions and eating places you should visit while in Singapore."
,,What public transport should be,4.0,,"If you are a tourist staying for 3 or more nights it is well worth taking the plunge and use the MRT. With a $30 tourist pass (note there is. $10 refund when you return the card before you leave) you get three days of travel anywhere on the bus and train system. Most major attractions can be accessed from the MRT. Once you get your head around how it works you will appreciate just how good it is. The trains are spotless, frequent and reliable. The bus services are just as efficient. Once you take the plunge you will wonder how taxis survive."
,,Travelling made easy in Singapore,4.0,,"Cheap and the fastest way to travel in Singapore is MRT. You can purchase a one-time ticket or for a week and with clear directions and helpful staff at the stations, traveling becomes a breeze. The connectivity to most parts of Singapore especially the tourist attractions makes life convenient. A must travel mode of transportation when in Singapore."
,,No doubt best connectivity,5.0,,"Well on time, clean and quite safe always runs till late night almost 12, perfect rides, escalators and walkways always working no issues"
,,A great way to see Singapore,5.0,,"A 3 day pass cost 30 Singapore dollars with 10 dollars refunded on return of the ticket. The MRT is extremely easy to use, no problems at all in finding destinations, interchanges etc. People follows the signs for entry and seating. Similarly buses are covered and are clean and regular."
,,Simple cheap and easy,5.0,,"Great way to get around, you can buy a card and load it up $12 of which $7 is travel. or you can buy ticket on a trip by trip basis, single or return. Super easy and very very safe."
,,PANCTUAL SCHEDUL,5.0,,"Very easy travell entire singapore by MRT. Maps are easy to read and aunderstand, no need any asistant asking. just show your MZ Card, you could explore singapore in very efficient time"
,,Fast and reasonable,5.0,,"Used the MTR and found really good kust make sure you have S$5 notes and under as machines will not take anything bigger. Fast, efficient and reasonable. Wish we'd used it earlier and bought a daily pass bit we'll know for next time."

,,Easy way to travel,4.0,,"Economical and efficient. The Singapore transit system is world class, quick and cheap. Trains run continuously to all destinations. Stations are modern and clean, or in the process of being brought up to standard."
,,Buy an EZ Link Card and access the city (almost also valid for wheelchair passengers),5.0,,"The public transport in Singapore is just perfect. It is clean, safe and you can get to every spot you want to see. When traveling together with our disabled friend we realized that also most of the MRT stations are wheelchair accessible. However please check in advance which entrance is equipped with a lift / an elevator. Station Raffles Place has only ONE entrance with a lift and it takes you nearly an hour to get there from another entrance as you can't cross the roads overground. (!)

Furthermore all staff is very helpful if they see somebody in a wheelchair."
,,"Clean, safe, efficient",5.0,,"It's clean, safe and efficient-the best way to get around Singapore, from the airport to Woodlands, and all places in-between."
,,EASY TO USE,5.0,,"Once you work out how to use the ticket machine, ask at the Passenger Services booth, it is simple and fast way to get around the City."

,,Very Effecient,5.0,,"Very fast and efficient. Signs are written in English, Bahasa and Mandarin so it is very easy to find your way."
,,SMRT,5.0,,It is really worth taking the time to work the system out. We became lost the first time we used however that opened us up to another area of Singapore. Then we realised just how easy the whole process is.

,,"Great system, and really clean",5.0,,"This system is great, and it really clean and easy to work out where you need to go to. We used the Tourist Passes, and they worked really well. Only used the bus once for the zoo."
,,Best transport system ever used,5.0,,"Punctual, tidy, modern, clean, spacious. It is also cheap to use. I would recommend getting an EZ-Link card. This can be pre-loaded. We were in Singapore for 5 days and bought one for ease of use. Excellent"
,,Great,4.0,,So cheap and always on time. You can literally go anywhere and the travel cards makes things so much easier.
,,Train or Taxi,5.0,,"Needed to get back to my hotel from downtown. The MRT staff go above and beyond with help and information they provide, very professional. It was so easy to catch a train, from picking your station to printing the ticket, then directions to the correct platform. After this experience I would feel Comfortable catching a train from the airport into Tiong Bahru station."

,,Superb Network and Simple to Navigate,5.0,,"Every time I experience this quality of interconnected transport systems I dispatched at the U.K. disjointed networks and Glasgow Airport in particular. 50 min after stepping onto a train to Expo, change onto Downtown Line and we’re in the heart of Chinatown and all for 2.40 Singapore Dollar. We used the SMRT to take in all the sights on our list. Clean, steak, efficient and simple to use. Remember to keep your card and reuse it the allotted times. I never bought a return or day pass only singles and between 4 and 10 dollar a day. What a transport system."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,So easy to get around Singapore using this system of travel; all directions are well signposted and the cost is very reasonable. No problems with missing stops as announcements are made throughout your journey as well as electronic signs advising the next station. We purchased a travel card that allowed us to travel on both the MRT and buses.
,,First class public transport,5.0,,"Our travel card had expired, so they transfer the balance across with a charge of $3 to a new card, this has long expiry 2026, very convenient."
,,Fast and comfortable,4.0,,"i love to use this transportation. It fasts, clean and comfortable. Although in certain times, it full of passengers, but i still like it. because we can go from a to b in no time."
,,Excellent rail system,5.0,,"Fast and efficient rail service, passes are inexpensive. We travelled around half the city for a less than $3. Australia should take note of the Asian Rail Network."

,,SINGAPORE PUBLIC TRANSPORT,4.0,,"As a Singaporean, I am proud of my country's public transport, the SMRT and buses. Most drivers are courteous enough to greet when we board the bus. Therefore, I always thank most drivers for driving us safely to most part of Singapore. All public transports in Singapore are driven by meticulous drivers and always on time. Environment is clean and lights are bright. Costs are affordable. After travelling almost more than half the world, I feel I am blessed to be a Singaporean. May all tourists visiting Singapore enjoy themselves."
,,easy to use and cheap,5.0,,buy the day fare because it is less expensive than buying each trip. Trains are clean and come every few minutes. The lines are also very simple unlike in tokyo or hong kong.
,,Brilliant system!!,5.0,,"Cheap (some trips cost us 0.77 cents), reliable, really clean and speedy. We bought the EZ link cards from the 7 Eleven shop in the metro station. Cost $10 each and had $5 credit on it ($5 was a non refundable deposit for the card itself). Minimum top up is $10 and the machine we found would only take $2, $5 and $10 but no coins. You have to top up when you have less than $3 on your card.

Also, at Changi airport, the machines wouldn’t take $50 which was the smallest denomination we had. Luckily a SMRT employee was standing at the machines helping people and gave us change for our single fares ($2.30 pp from Changi to Kallang)."
,,MRT Singapore Is....,5.0,,"Clean, comfortable, safe, cheap, .... you must try when you are visit to singapore and Indonesia must have it ...."
,,Easy to commute,4.0,,The SMRT is connected with other train system so that you can go wherever you want in Singapore. The fee is reasonable. What I like most of this SMRT is- it's connected with the shopping malls. You can also use the underpass if you do not wish to walk in the open air. There are plenty of shops in the underpass. The SMRT is very spacious.

,,Great transport system,5.0,,"The Singapore underground is great, trains are really frequent and we had no problems getting to where we wanted to go. It felt really safe and even when busy nobody pushed or shoved. You might get shouted at to stand on the left on the escalators but follow the rules and it’s fine!"
,,Ticket machine chaos,3.0,,"The Singapore metro is clean, efficient and easy to travel around. Only complaint is ticket machines, too few, complicated and lots of restrictions eg cash only & only certain note denominations. First i thought it was me, but often found long queues and locals struggling!."
,,"Efficient, clean and cheap but a taxi is much faster",4.0,,"We used the Mass Transit to travel from Changi Airport into the city. It took nearly an hour whereas a taxi would have taken 20min. It was cheap though- $4.80 for the two of us (not each, that was the total price). It was safe and clean."
,,So slow,1.0,,"Crowded, noisy, timing was bad, fares just keep rising. To be honest, it's safer to walk and cheaped to get a grab."
,,"Clean, excellent service! So different than European public transport",5.0,,"With all the different lines in Singapore the MRT map might look a little frightening, but once you get the hack of it, it is quite easy. And in case you don't know how to get somewhere, there is always a concierge to guide you. All people speak English in Singapore, so you won't get lost. Once you buy your ticket, you go to the line and once inside the MRT, OMG I was so surprised by its cleanness, its organisation and the respect people have for each other. Next time I go to Singapore I will use the MRT again as it is so easy to travel around the city."

,,Excellent,5.0,,"Excellent, clean, always on time, more stop are being added, so eventually the whole island will be connected. Very very inexpensive.

,,one of the bests,4.0,,"one of the best subway systems in the world.

The subway arrives everywhere and the only complicated thing, the first time, is buying the tickets."
,,Wish we had this in Sydney,5.0,,"Nothing short of amazing. Efficient, air conditioned and cheap to use. The only gripe ( a very small one) is that Tourist passes are not available from every station."
,,The Lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,"In my week long stay in Singapore, I must have used SMRT almost 20+ times for both business and leisure travel. It’s always on time, pretty clean.

,,A+ for the Singapore Mass Transit System,5.0,,"Getting around Singapore is easily facilitated by its public transport system. It a gem of Singapore. It is clean, orderly system with good signs that can be followed by anyone. It is very friendly to handicapped persons as well with lifts that helps navigating the system. We found it convenient and easily accessed from our hotel. It saved us a lot on transport expense around places of interest. We purchased an ecard which can be used on both buses and train. We only paid half of the regular fare every time. Case in point was our trip to Sentosa Island. We were going to buy a tour package but decided to do it on our own. Lo and behold, we saved a few hundred dollars between the 5 of us. Transport in the island was free as well, once you have paid a one time fare. Really cool. The eCard can be used for 5 years and balance on the card was refundable upon departure. What a great deal overall."
,,So easy to use and so cheap,5.0,,"The MRT is the best way to get around Singapore. A lot of the MRT stations are also shopping malls. We bought an EZY-Link card from the Tourist Information Centre, which is a bit like our Go Card in Brisbane. It cost $10 Singapore dollars from the tourist information centre and that includes $5 credit. The card is good for four years. You can top up at machines located in hotels and MRT stations with a minimum top up of $10 or go to a 7/11 store and you can top up for a minimum of $5. When you swipe on, it will charge you 70 cents minimum and the cost of the journey. Two stops cost me 77 cents and a journey of about eight stations consisting of two line change overs cost me 97 cents. We traveled the system for two days and only spent $5.02. Easier than the London Tube and a lot cheaper."
,,Nice service but sometimes causes delays,3.0,,One of the best train I've had so far. The train service is very efficient but sometimes you will experience some delays due to train fault.

,,Phenomenal Subway,5.0,,Easy to navigate. Inexpensive. Bright. Clean. Efficient. Stations near all the main attractions. A model system.
,,convenient but with flaws,3.0,,"The service is nice when it's raining or just hot outside. Though the conveniences provided, the metro sometimes comes to a stop rough and it takes a long time to transfer at some stations. Also, the price is relatively high. one stop can be 0.7 SGD in cost. Some signs can be improved in order to guide tourists to the right exit for their desired destinations. These are some points that I hope SMRT can have their hands on. Then it would surely be the best metro.
The route time is sometimes difficult for a newcomer to understand as the route planning is not very good..."
,,One of the best system in the world,4.0,,"I have used the bus & MRT both and it’s very convenient for even for tourists,easy to access and economical"
,,Excellent transportation system,5.0,,"A family of 4, purchased tickets that you can load money to, the trains are at hige frequncy, very clean trains and stations, Everything is very clearly marked.
On the end of our visit we returnd our cards to service center at the station near our hotel, and got refund for the remaining value.
Great train system!"
,,"Fast, Clean, Efficient",5.0,,"We used the MRT a number of times during our visit to Singapore. The system is very easy to use, and once you have purchased your ticket for your first trip, don't discard it, as it can be topped up again (very easily) for your next trip.
The carriages are neat and clean, more so than those in New York or Paris. And they run efficiently, punctually and quickly.

,,Efficient and gret value,5.0,,"The SMRT is a great way to get around Singapore, its very easy to use and the tickets are not expensive. If you're going to be using it alot, it's a good idea to get an easylink card which can just be topped up and used whenever. The card costs $12 which includes $7 credit and $5 refundable deposit. It just saves time on buying tickets."
,,Best,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is best , always on time and very clean .
My day to day commute. Tickets are reasonable and staff on stations are very interested in helping with any situation. Singapore is a congested city , although they have taxis - Uber etc every where But traffic is nasty some times in rush hour so best option is MRT because it covers most of the area.
Keep it up MRT.
Love Singapore"
,,The 3 day tourist pass is a must,5.0,,"The train system is excellent - trains arrive regularly so no waiting and will take you anywhere - the whole system is clean efficient and friendly,as well as excellent value. We always use public transport when travelling and this has to be one of the best"
,,Easy to get around -,5.0,,We opted to get an Ezi-link card to use on the Metro & buses while we were in Singapore. The card saves the hassle of buying a single ticket every time and can be used on all public transport. The transport services were easy to follow and the subways clean.
,,Great network and easy to use.,5.0,,"Very easy to use, much cheaper than the taxi system. Signage not very good, could find yourself walking right past an entrance. Quick and effective!"
,,Not fully informed,3.0,,As a tourist brought a three day pass. Could not buy before 12md.at the station we were located at. This meant we had lost a half day of use. The three days are midnight to midnight not from time of first use. Paid for three only got 2.5
,,Convenient and easy,5.0,,"Travelled so many countries public transport, this is the easiest to go about. With comfortable and clean trains from Airport to City to residential."
,,"Amazing, beats Melbourne 500 fold!!",5.0,,This transport was excellent and very easy to use. We went everywhere using MRT. Trains come every 4 mins so you don't have to worry about rushing to get your train. We couldn't rate this higher compared to Melbourne. You can pretty much get anywhere using the MRT. We bought an ezycard i think it was called for $10 which had $5 credit on it i think.
,,"Wow , Wow & Wow",5.0,,"No need to spend money on taxi, p,ease use MRT. Takes you everywhere & most of the times you find a seat to sit down. I was with my son who is 5 years old and he was given a free pass. Just had to produce an id. Highly Highly recommended."
,,SG MRT,5.0,,"Positives: Clean, reliable, air conditioned Negatives: Crammed during rush hours. Can be a bit slow because they don’t have express trains."
,,Efficient service,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is very easy to use and is extremly clean, with fines for drinking and eating in the trains. There is an option in certain stations to get a tourist pass for up to three days from the ticket counter. The trains arrive every 2 to 3 mins and are much cheaper to travel by than a taxi for sightseeing around Singapore."
,,"Convenient, clean, and efficient",4.0,,This is the best way to get around Singapore's district fast. We got the reloadable tap cards for the MRT/bus at Changi airport. Initially we had a hard time looking for one of the platforms going to Sentosa. Note that when you tap into the wrong platform you need to tap out to get out - a mistake cost almost two SG dollars.
,,One of the Best public transportation in the world,4.0,,If you want to commute across the island without getting stuck in traffic go for the MRT. The system is ageing but still one of the best public transportation systems in the world. Almost all of the island is connected end to end.

,,2018 trip,5.0,,very inexpensive way to check out singapore. i got the card and loaded it with s$30 which lasted all week. use google maps to find out the mrt location closest to your destination so you won't have to second guess which exit to take. taking a screen shots of the streets surrounding the station will help your orientation as well.
,,Visitings,3.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is one of most convenient means of transportation. The fare is slightly higher than bus fare but cheaper than taxi. There are north and south bound train, east and west bound train. There is circle line train and downtown line train. Those traveling on north /south can transfer to east /west line or vice versa. All the lines passengers can transfer to any other lines at interchange stations. Passengers can travel north, south, east and west at their convenience."
,,Efficiency first,5.0,,"The ideal way if Your stay in Singapore Will be short.
You Can take it directly fm Changi Airport (green line) / change to blue line at The next station ""Expo"" / get off at ""Batyfront"" if You intend to visit Marina Bay area.
Everything clean, vagons not so crowded (also during peak times), timely arrival, cheap peices."
,,Efficient and Convenient Transportation System,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a very good and convenient transportation system. You can always find a station nearby the tourist site within 20 minutes of walk. It's convenient that you can purchase the ticket from the ticketing machine with different languages available for people from different countries. Although there are six main MRT lines, it's easy to understand and you will not have problem to swap between lines because many clear signboards will show you the way. Each station is clean and tidy with pretty big space inside. There are not many ticketing machines in the station, you should be aware to reserve more time to purchase the ticket if you will take the train in some center stations during the rush hours."
,,"Clean, efficient, could do with better maps",4.0,,"The maps assume some prior knowledge of Singapore as lines seemed to be named after their end destination - so you have to know the end destination of the line before getting on a train or deciding on a platform....HOWEVER, staff and passers-by are more than happy to help out a lost looking tourist - From that point of view, Singapore is very courteous and tourist friendly and I got around on the metro quickly.
It's very easy to buy and top up cards, all automated. Simple.

What's really cool is that 4G works in the tunnels!"
,,Much maligned transport mode by local,4.0,,"Although it has been getting a lot of bad press over the breakdown it is still very efficient, affordable , clean and comfortable mode of transport for visitors. The signage are clear and the local are very willing to assist."
,,Great form of transport,5.0,,The SMRT is modern and efficient be sure to buy a Singapore Tourist Pass. Underground Railways around the world could learn a lot from the Singaporeans..
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transport. SMRT,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day ticket for $30 and did a 30 trips
We also got $10 back when we hand the card back
A bargain to move around the city
It did take a while to get used to finding the correct train and to make the changes To the different lines
The trains are very clean and safe and air con is excellent
Recommend this great option to move around"
,,"Very clean, convenient, inexpensive way to get around Singapore",5.0,,"Very convenient way to travel from airport to city center, and also to get around the city. Clean, Efficient, just all around great city with great subway system."

,,Clean Safe Cheap Efficient,5.0,,Your first choice to travel almost anywhere in Singapore. Buy an ezlink card at the station or 711. Get the tourist version if you are only staying a few days. Many stations are shopping malls in their own right or link to them. To me the MRT is a major tourist attraction in it's own right. Take a day to travel one of the long lines end to end and get off whenever you spot something interesting.
,,A very convenient form of transport ...,5.0,,"On a recent trip to Singapore, we decided to experience the SMRT ... just to see how it compares to metropolitan rail systems in Australia.
We were very pleased to say that it was very efficient, very clean throughout and very easy-to use.
It is a great way to get around if you have somewhere specifically to go, or just a good way to get from point A to point B."
,,Best public transport system!,5.0,,Trains are immaculate. The timetables are easy to read. The trains were on time. No foods allowed on the trains....makes such a difference to the cleanliness....well done Singapore! I don't even like trains....but I would use yours again!
,,Cheap and On-Time Way To Travel - Wheelchair and Stroller Friendly,5.0,,Singapore is constantly expanding their MRT by building more lines and stations. The focus is to connect each and every place so that people can get to places conveniently. Trains run very frequently and you do not have to wait too long. I love it that every Singapore MRT station is built with the thought for those on a wheelchair or family with strollers - Lifts are accessible and stress-free. The cost of riding the MRT is very affordable. Get an EZlink card for quick access rather than queuing up to buy a ticket at the machine each time.
,,confusing to use,3.0,,"Not the best experience. Signage was not adequate. ticketing machines were always packed with lines, which was really annoying. Obviously more needed at key stations. To go from airport to marina, was on/off 4 times, with a baby this not great. Lack of seating also an issue, too much standing room."
,,Cheapest way to travel.,5.0,,Very efficient and clean. Signage is clear and once on the train location indicators leave no doubt as to where you are in the system.
,,August visit,5.0,,Excellent and perfect way to get around and explore Singapore including all the attractions outside the city centre such as the zoo and the war memorial cemetery at Kranji

,,Easy and smooth transport system,5.0,,"Such a great transport system- so much better and more efficient than Perth, and Australia for that matter.
Punctual trains, clean trains and stations and easy to maneuver with all the signage .
I also really like the signage on the floor so passengers know where to line up and passengers exiting can do so easily.
Only thing is getting lifts with our strollers meant we were always walking much further than other passengers and often it took much longer as so many People want to use the lifts.
Also the toilets were a little grubby and it wasn't the nicest place to change our toddler but we appreciate that you at least have those facilities.
We purchased our tickets at the Clarke Quay MRT and the service people there were very helpful and friendly.
I also recommend the Citymapper app- it tells you everything you need to know about which line to take, how many stops before your stop and how many minutes until the next train."
,,Very much like the Delhi metro,5.0,,"You can take tickets from the ticket vending counter using the interactive map. Remember to carry coins and small denomination notes, (ask for change from your hotel). All you have to do is remember the last station on the line both sides.The routes are colour coded just like that in the delhi metro and announcement are made in English as well."
,,Best public transport system in the world is in Singapore!,5.0,,"Singapore Government couple of decades ago decided to implement strategy to reduce private cars and increase facility for public transport. Today it is probably the best and well covered public transport system in the world. By 2025, one will find public transport within 500m of anywhere you stand in Singapore!
Visitors should use only public transport and feel the local life."
,,A Good Example of what Public Transportation Should be like.,5.0,,"Using Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit is the most convenient way to move around and look around the city.

,,One of the best transport system I have used,4.0,,"Singapore is famous for it's signs, cleanliness and world class transport system, MRT is also a part of that transport, Singapore is connected via Air, Sea, Road and Railway (from Malaysia) so at the time of entering into singapore from these mediums, u would see MRT stations present and u can use MRT to reach to your destinations, u can use single ticket (once u get ticket at counter it would be 10SGD loaded) after that u can top up from counter or kiosk, Singapore MRT does fails to run some times (this has happened in recent years) but Singapore MRT staff always ready to help during this crisis. They work round the clock to keep this system up and running. One must use MRT in their Singapore trip. I was new to Singapore but because of signs to follow I started using very next day without asking anyone's help..."
,,Neat and clean,5.0,,"One of the best convenient mode of travel in Singapore. SMRT is exceptionally clean and tidy. Always on time as much as I experienced.

,,"Clean, safe, quick, reliable and comprehensive network",5.0,,"A relatively, cheap and quick way to make your way around Singapore.

We bought the EZ-link card from the local mrt train station ticket booth. You can then load amounts onto the card via the automated ticket machines located at all mrt stations.

Never had to wait long for a train and all stations have good air con. As with any train station, best to avoid at commuter rush hour."
,,Highly efficient and cheap transport,5.0,,"The SMRT system is world class. Buy a travel card in any MRT station or 7/11 store and top up with money ($30 is more than enough to meet daily travel needs for a month), download any app with details of the local bus service timetables and route planner ( I use City mapper), and travel anywhere in the island at very little cost. As a professional planner from the UK, I cant praise tjis transport system highly enough - cheap, efficient and comprehensive public transport services available 24 hours a day. And with wifi. Lets not forget the great artwork in the very clean, rubbish free MRT stations too. This is hiw to do public transoprt well. Fabulous."
,,"Time efficient and budget friendly, but not always comfortable",4.0,,"MRT is a great way of getting around Singapore while avoiding the traffic, but it can get very crowded during the peak hour.

,,Traveling in Singapore for a reasonable price,5.0,,"Very well organised public transport system, clean wagons and a quite reliable service. Trains run from all 2 minutes in the main hours up to every 6 minutes at less popular times.
Although occasional break downs happen, the over all reliability is quite high. SMRT usually provides bus service for this particular situation."
,,Cleaniess,5.0,,"Smrt did something that impressed me, I was travelling and a passenger spilled the coffee in the train floor and make a stain all over, I was thinking of telling the train operator about it when I alight, but after 2 station stops, in came a train supervisor with a cleaner and very quickly they clean up the mess and alight the next stop ! I’m truly amazed how efficient these people are."
,,"SUPER EFFICIENT, SUPER CLEAN, SUPER!!",5.0,,"What can I say puts the UK underground to shame, it’s clean, the trains run on time.

There are staff available when you need help. There are maps and signs to assist passengers as well. Topping up your EZ link card is easy as 1-2-3. Just remember to follow rules and you'll be on your way! :)"
,,Good ride for less money,5.0,,"Most rapid transit systems throughout the world have their ups and downs and usually not the best buy. However, the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) is worth the money and a big change from other Asian transit systems (and so much better than those in the U.S.)."

Brought tears my unexpected eyes which is saying something! A real highlight of our Singapore / Bintan trip

,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Like most things in Singapore the mrt is clean and efficient. When it is busy it is very busy, but the air con makes up for it.
As a tourist, the best way around is to get a tourist pass which is great value. You can buy at most, but not all, stations. Then you just tap in and out (and also the buses).
There are also helpful (mostly) ladies on most platforms to help if you get confused or lost!
Remember at the end to claim back your card deposit at the airport *before* you go through security/immigration to your gates."
,,MRT,5.0,,"The MRT was easy to navigate and wait time was no more than four minutes in the city and 15 minutes in the suburbs. Younger people readily gave up their seat for me, if they saw me standing.
Fares are low and discounts offered when topping up tickets. Staff are there if you need help.
Trains are very clean - no eating or drinking allowed and definitely NO Durians!
Be prepared to do a lot of walking when changing trains or getting to street level."
,,Very Efficient,5.0,,"Very easy and efficient system to travel around Singapore. The network gets you to most tourist attractions around the city.

We used the ezylink card and topped up a few times during our stay, minimum top up is $10.

There are a few apps that can be downloaded to your phone to plan your journeys.

Trains are clean, cool and always on time and run every few minutes so you’re not waiting long at all.

The only frustrating issue you will encounter at times is the number of people without manners that try to enter the trains when people are still exiting. After a few days you learn to just bump them out of the way."
,,Best metro ever...,5.0,,"It's amazing what the have done, not just a metro, but a hole underground mall. Stuff was excellent also."
,,easy to navigate,5.0,,Easy access to all places in singapore .The lines are color coded so there is no way to get lost .the trains are faster than buses .Each area has only one Station . The Ez link card can be purchased at the information center and used on both trains and buses . We used the purple lines a lot .
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Singapore’s mrt is so easy to use to get around, we brought a ezi link card and off we went. All lines are colour coded which makes it so much easier.
I downloaded an app called gothere.sg, entered details of where I wanted to go and it told me how to get there by the mrt, how much it would cost also how long it would take.
Fantastic service, very clean and very reliable.
Well done Singapore for getting your public transport right, Australia should take a leaf out of your book."
,,So Easy to Use,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 3 days. We purchased a 3-
day Pass from the Information Kiosk at one of the main stations. It cost $20 and we got $10 back on returning the card back to an Information Kiosk . This covered us for unlimited 3 days of travel on the trains and buses. The trains are so easy to use and marked very clearly. The trains are all electronic and say the station out loud as approaching, it would be very diffiuclt to get lost on their train system as it is very user friendly plus great value."
,,stroller friendly access,5.0,,Singapore is one of the few places in the world that I can see lifts in every stations. They do look after families with disabilities or babies. I didn’t have any problem taking my stroller with me travelling with SMRT.
,,MRT AMAZING!,5.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for 11 nights. We caught a taxi once - and that was to the Zoo because it is not so accessible by the MRT. Other than that we were never off the MRT system. We travelled every one of the 5 different lines, as well some of the light rail. We went to almost the extent of each line. The line that was above the ground the most was the Green Line - or the East West Line.

We bought a card called an EZ Link card it cost $12 - which was $5 deposit and gave you an initial $7 worth of travel. Top up is at any MRT and it is very easy to use - if you are familiar with an Opal card you will have no trouble with this card. $10 is the minimum top up and the cost of the trips is ridiculously cheap. There is even an website that tells you what the cost of a journey is so you can calculate whether you might have enough on your card. You cannot have less than $3 balance to take on your next journey. In 11 days and travelling it every day more than once sometimes and using more than one line often - we topped up twice so initial outlay $12 and two $10 top ups $32 for one person. We found it so convenient we caught it both to and from the airport.

What an amazing system I wish we had something nearly as good as it here in Sydney. The stations are spotless. There is never one speck of rubbish to be seen - the stations are all tiles, marble, stainless steel and glass, There are lifts on every station and the staff are outstanding in wanting to help you. Signage is great and the journeys are quick and you can usually get a seat. Some of the trains do not have many seats but the journeys to and from places are usually short so it is of no consequence. My advice to travellers - use the MRT - you will be pleasantly surprised."
,,Fast and effective city transport,5.0,,It may seem daunting but once you get used to the busy transit lines the train system is so smart and easy to use. All stations have helpful staff as well.
,,MRT,5.0,,"Definitely worth being in top 10 Loved the system Cleanliness Organised, i was 3 days in Singapore Used MRT EACH DAY Covered lot of places"

,,Mrt,4.0,,"MRT in Singapore, Singapore is pass moder, small country. And mrt is one of that. It’s very clean, much respect to human being, always on time."
,,Very on time and reliable public transportation,5.0,,Mrt singapore is very on time. But this time i saw for the first time the mrt that didn't stop perfectly so the mrt door can not open. The mrt was going back and forth many times to stoped at the perfect point so the door gate can open.
,,Most convenient,5.0,,Singapore MRT is the most efficient way to get around in Singapore. Also it is most cheaper than using cabs to get around. It also takes right inside of Changi airport.
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,Excellent express transport system.only need is the map.then anyone could go around singapore easily and without any delay.no raffic. need to buy ez link pass or tickets with top up.
,,Cheap and easy to use,5.0,,"Great experience. Buy a travel card and travel hassle free.Very efficient service (never waited more that three minutes at connections), and very cheap also: in two visits we paid less than a one-way trip to the airport in Rome (including two return trips from the airport to the city centre)"
,,Highly Recommend,5.0,,"Easy to follow map, trains are air conditioned and cheap fare.

One way tickets cost $1.40 and you can use the same card to top up.

Wouldn’t recommend to buy the $20 unlimited tourist card especially if you are a group of 4 or more and will use the train extensively."
,,Not like the MRTs back home,5.0,,"Coming from the glorious country of the Philippines (yes, that was sarcasm), I've come to get used to an ever dependable (this is also sarcasm) MRT system which break at least once a day, leaks and sometimes leaves train cars behind because of faulty couplings. The Singapore MRT just blew the Philippines out of the water so much that the latter is now becoming one with the dry earth. Acquiring tickets is easy and automated, the waiting areas are clean, there are very clear labels on which train is going where and the trains themselves are fast. Going through several stations took less than 10 minutes, where it would take at least 3 times or more of that time in the Philippines."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is extremely convenient, easy, clean, and prompt. Definitely my favorite way to get around. I bought a three day tourist pass (which also works on buses) and it worked really well."
,,Easy and pocket friendly room around,5.0,,"Suggest to buy a card, easy and efficient way to room around the city, very well maintained and clean transport facility"
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,We used the tourist three day pass for a handle free and relatively cheap method to get around to many attractions and sites of Singapore. Easy system to use and never too crowded.

,,You can never get lost in Singapore!,5.0,,"So impressed with the MRT system of the country that you would never ever need any other mode of transport if you are visiting Singapore for the purpose of tourism. MRT stations are located near all major attractions. With self-explanatory signs, clear directions & complete automation, we saved a lot on our travel cost by only relying on MRT."
,,Great!,5.0,,"Cheap and easy, go travel by public transport! Easy to buy a card, either the tourist one or by separate fairs. It is cheaper to buy a card for 15$, then do all loose fairs, it safes you in the end."
,,Every city should have one!,5.0,,"Easy to use, so efficient, and inexpensive, too! The trains and stations are so clean and safe. As with everything in Singapore- pretty impressive!"
,,"Clean, efficient, spacious (composting to most) What's not to like?",5.0,,"Most short trips costing 1.50 or thereabouts: surely government is subsidising, where other societies need to learn!"
,,Reliable and clean,5.0,,"The whole MRT in Singapore is reliable and clean, be aware that it is mostly automated but it's not working during all night."
,,getting about singapore,4.0,,we found ourselves stranded at the end of a city tour. The conductor directed us to the mrt and fortunately we had some s$ and found the trip was really quick and cheap. Luckily we knew which station we needed to get off at after having been lost under Orchard rd the night before.
,,A cheap way to get around in Singapore,5.0,,"The metro system is clean, cheap and safe. Make sure you finish your evening journey before the service closes down a little after midnight though (one night we were running late and the train stopped in the middle of the suburban hinterland and we had to catch a taxi back into downtown Singapore). You may have to stand up if you board at peak hour. However, if you are elderly or have disabilities, the locals will stand up and give you a seat."
,,Great way to get around Singapore cheaply,5.0,,A little confusing at first but doesn't take long to get the hang of how it works. Just a little intimidating at first
,,Quick Clean Efficient,5.0,,A great way to connect up with CBD - not necessarily designed to be anything other than CBD centric - it does do a great job of connecting you well into the city
,,The best in the world,5.0,,"The SMRT is smart, clean, effective and cheap. What else? I regularly use metro in big cities like London, Paris, Milan and Rome... this is the best experience I have had. I suggest to buy the card."
,,Singapore Tourist pass,4.0,,"advisable to take Singapore tourist pass.
its cost only 10 dollars per day or 16 dollars for 2 days and you can travel all around Singapore by mrt and bus except to Sentosa island, and it cost 1 dollar only to Sentosa. back from there is free. no additional cost

put the right shoes!"
,,Fast efficiant,5.0,,"Everyone was so helpful, so fast to get around and clean , no rubbish. Loved it, also a cheap way to get around the city"
,,Breakdowns,1.0,,Rate of BREAKDOWNS is SHAMEFUL considering age of the trains. Rides are NOT comfortable. Cabins are NOISY. Sound-proofing is practically NIL. Only plus point is its CLEANLINESS!
,,"If you are in Singapore for the first time also, use this",5.0,,"Very well planned MRT. Get the SMRT map and then you are good to go. It is pretty clear and is easily understandable. Also, wait for others to get out of the train before you get in."

,,Good to get around,4.0,,"The MRT is great to get around the island with good interchanges with buses. The only issue we had was the East-West line was closing early for works, which left us stranded after the night safari."
,,Nothing exceptional,3.0,,"Not the fastest, not the most frequent and always crowded. Suffers a few breakdowns and delays lately. On the positive side, it’s clean and the staffs are always present and ready to help."
,,So Easy,5.0,,"The SMRT system is first class; so easy, quick, inexpensive with frequent stations everywhere makes getting around Singapore a breeze.

,,Clean,5.0,,"Very very clean well laid out and safe just can't belief how clean the entire system was, tickets easy to buy at each station and not very expensive"
,,Exceptional,5.0,,One of the flawless systems I have experienced in Singapore is the MRT! Completely user friendly from the time you get into the station and buy the tickets on the machine to getting onto the train and reaching your destination. You don’t have to ask anybody for any assistance. I used this service through out my stay in Singapore to travel to all my destinations. A cost effective and time saver. Big to Singapore MRT!
,,Great way to travel around,5.0,,"The most cost effective way to travel around the city,probably the cleanest subway system on the planet,everything is well organised"

And yes, the trains are really clean :)"
,,Great easy way to get round,5.0,,"Great easy way to get round - staff generally very helpful, cheap and quick! We were in Singapore for 3 days and just used an EZ-card - easy to purchase at the airport station."
,,Easy and fast way to explore singapore,5.0,,How fantastic is the MRT. So cheap and super efficient. A train every 3 minutes. The easy way to explore Singapore. It’s clean easy to navigate. Highly recommend getting your MRT card as Changi airport And using for your stay in Singapore.

,,"Convenient, cheap and user friendly",5.0,,"Efficient and easy to use to get around the island. Best to get a card and top up when needed. The air conditioning tends to be strong so be prepared with some cover as being a hot tropical country, people tend to dress down and get caught in the coolness of the trains."
,,Wow !,5.0,,"Without a doubt the best train system i have come across. Cheap, extremely clean and always on time. So easy to get around the city ! Fantastic."
,,Best way to get around the island !!,5.0,,"It is so easy to get around Singapore with SMRT. Although it may take a bit of time to get familiar with the different train lines and the connectivity points, this is still one of the fastest way to get around. Download the MyTransport.SG application and it will help you to get the most out of the SMRT transport system .... including which bus to take from which train station and the arrival times too.

The trains are clean and comfortable (when it is not too crowded) and the frequency very good. The fare card top up machines are easy to use too. The toilets at the stations are usually quite clean too."
,,Quick and Cheap,5.0,,"Easy way to get about, spend a little time working out what to do though but this is true of any metro system. Fares very reasonable. Stations and trains clean and tidy and felt safe."
,,comprehensive,5.0,,"though I drive, I almost always use the bus and MRT over the weekend. they do get the complaints for the breakdown occasionally, but really which country transport do not?? perhaps in the way they handle it lol

but have to say the train networks is very comprehensive...the frequency is really good..the cabins are very clean...and they integrated well with the bus network too...can't comment on the fares, but touch wood I'm lucky not to kanna any breakdown before though have slowness...good transport system once you get the hang of it."
,,"Clean, fast, efficient",5.0,,"I don’t have much to say other than this is probably the best subway system I have used (living near NYC and Sydney, traveling to Boston, London, Paris, Budapest, etc.) It is very clean and straight forward. The only thing (with every new city subway system) is learning how to use it the first time. You go to a ticket machine, pay by which station you are going to, and then tap to swipe in and out of each station. I could not figure out how to add more than one trip at a time or pay by card (only takes up to $5 notes), but maybe there is a way. All the directions for where to go are very clear, not like getting lost on an express train in the wrong direction in NYC. Very cost efficient too."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"We were here for 3 days and purchased the 3 day tourist pass, it’s unlimited journeys on the mrt and it’s fantastic. All the main places you would go are off one of the stops whether it’s china town, the airport or marina bay it’s so easy.

It’s well signposted and runs accurately."
,,Quick & Easy to use,5.0,,"Once you have sorted the ticket from the ticket machine the rest is a breeze. Lines are colour coded, check the map for the stop to where you require, then head down the escalator to the correct level. Stand outside the painted lines, wait for passengers to leave train then hop on. It’s fun to look back and see the train how much it bends as it goes along the track. Keep left on escalator if your standing stil, or walk up the right side if your in a hurry - well organised, Aussies could learn from this?"
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"Great system, clean and safe and very reasonably priced. Will always use it on future visits. The only negative is that when you buy a ticket with cash the machines do not take $10 notes"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Don't hesitate to use it. Super efficient, very little delay between trains, clean, younger people stand to let oldies sit and really very easy to use. I bought a 3 day tourist pass for $20 plus $10 deposit and probably used it 3/4 times a day for that time. Took it back on last night and got the deposit back. Great service"
,,Singapore tourist pass,5.0,,"What a deal!
We were only in Singapore for a day so bought a one day pass for $10
Two and three day passes also available
MRT is fast , clean and efficient
A fully refundable $10 deposit is given at end of your use
Unbelievable value !!!"

,,"It just works, as it should.",5.0,,Very regular service on any line we've been on. Trains and stations always spotlessly clean. Ticketing system quite reasonable. Almost on a par with the best in Europe.
,,Excellent way of travel around Singapore,4.0,,"An excellent way of travelling around Singapore, Very convenient and easy to use transit system which is extremely clean and tidy and efficient. I obtained a valued added card and was in Singapore for 8 days and all my travel, including to and from the airport and all my sightseeing and tourist activities didn't cost me more than S$40 for the whole time I was there. For example I travelled from Novena to Changi Airport $2.75 and took about 45 mins."
,,Perfectly organized,5.0,,We found public transport in Singapore to be very well thought-out and very good value for money. Would be very pleased if the concepts used there would be applied in many large cities all over the world. The only issue: At some stations (e.g. Bayfront) there were too few ticket machines.
,,Good transportation,5.0,,This is a great and cheaper way to get around Singapore. It’s a better alternative to taxis. You can inquire at the passenger service stations when you’re lost. I also recommend downloading and offline map
,,Singapore MRT System,5.0,,"While the taxi service in Singapore is very good the best and cheapest method of travel is using the MRT System. The first thing to do when entering the MRT Station is to purchase an E-Z-Link Smart Card this will allow you to travel on the MRT System. To get to your destination first look at the colour of the station line you are at, there are six different colored MRT lines. It is possible the you may need to change lines to get to your destination. Note the station that you need to exit and listen for the station name to be called out on the public address system in the train. Exit and change to a different colored line and hopefully this will get you to your destination. First time using the MRT will feel a bit strange but after only one trip you will be and expert it is so simple and easy to use and the cost of travel is very cheap."
,,fantastic rail system,5.0,,such a great railway system which is all underground and so easy to use trains come every couple of minutes and you can travel everywhere around the city so cheaply and its so safe
,,Best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"Traveling around Singapore is so easy and convenient way to get round, also very cheap travel. The signs are easy to follow and you don't have to wait long for the MRT. Busses are more confusing to get around so get your MRT tickets now.,"
,,Most integrated public transport,5.0,,"The best way for me as a solo traveler to go around Singapore, pay attention to the map and what color line of ur destination. All just great!"
,,The best MRT system,5.0,,"The subway stations are accesses from all main highways and you can purchased the two or three days tourist paass for the MRT on most of the location including the ticket vending machines in the subway locations. Once you in the train, you next station is displayed above the door with red LED light so you will know the station before the train approaches. All the trains and the MRT have A/C and it gives you relief from the outside heat.You can always seek the help from the train station employee in the booth if you so desire. However, taxi is faster and takes you directly to your location faster than the MRT."
,,"Clean, Efficient and extremely affordable",5.0,,Trains and stations are extremely clean and very efficient. Absolutely the best way to get around in Singapore.
,,World Class,5.0,,"Loved travelling on the MRT everywhere in Singapore. Clean, cheap, easy to use and it helps to use a top up card that you can keep with you instead of loose change."
,,"Aging mass rapid system, crowded and facing frequent breakdown",2.0,,"Aging mass rapid system, crowded and facing frequent breakdowns. However, it is still the only mass rapid rail system here. I would advise you to learn to use the public bus systems to complement your daily commute."
,,Second to None,5.0,,Cannot fault the MRT network. Always spotlessly clean. Very easy to make your way around the city. Well signposted & very thoughtful signs within the trains to consider your fellow travellers. Sydney could definitely learn ALOT from them!
,,Easy to use and clean!,5.0,,Singapore MRT has got to be the easiest metro ever. We found it very self explanatory to buy tickets and find the right platform. All the trains are clean and even though they get busy people are never pushy.
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"This underground system is all you really need to get around and about in Singapore. It's AC'd, frequent, clean and comprehensive. I believe it charges by the distance, but I'm not entirely sure since I used the 3 days Singapore tourist pass. Highly recommend the tourist pass if you'll be in Singapore for 2-3 days. No eating and drinking allowed on the train. This train system is very comparable to the train system in Barcelona, which imo, is one of the best in the world. I wish Chicago's EL is as frequent and clean as the MRT."
,,Easy travel,4.0,,"I have always dreamt of getting lost on a bus or train in a foreign country but there is no concerns here in Singapore as the MRT is great and there is always someone around to help if you have any doubt s. The train system is very safe,often crowded but very inexpensive and each destination is highlighted in the carriage so missing your stop is hard to do. I think this is a great way to have a good look at the sites."
,,Efficient,4.0,,Efficient and very reasonably priced. Carriages get very crowded and not many seats. Gets you very clsoe to most destinations.
,,Fast and frequent,5.0,,"Clean, fast, frequent, inexpensive, safe - what more do you need from a metro system?

And locals seem to be behind ""Stand Up Stacey"" and her friends who promote ""graciousness on public transport"" - so do try to fit in!

As most people here suggest, do buy a card unless you're only planning a couple of journeys. The downside is that the minimum top-up is $10."
,,Exceptional,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT runs frequently and efficiently. The carriages are spotless, the cost is very reasonable and there is plenty of signage."
,,VERY GOOD,5.0,,A very good service some stations difficult to find modern very clean dont use at peak times a lot of staff around to guide you if you get lost all english speaking.
,,Who could knock this,5.0,,"We bought tourist passes and used this brilliant system throughout our stay. Singapore has built a world class mass transit system that’s reliable, convenient, regular and safe. Other countries should look here for an example of how to build a good transit system."
,,"Fast, Secure and Clean",5.0,,"Fast service, Secure environment and Clean stations and vehicles. The best form to move in the city :)"
,,Mrt,5.0,,"What can I say, easy to use, safe, air conditioned whatever time day or night. Oh forgot clean. Puts other cities to shame."
,,Fantastic system,5.0,,"A fantastic way to travel. It's clean, cheap and trains are very regular. We bought an Ezy pass, which can be topped up, and lasts for 5 years. Perfect for when we go to Singapore again."
,,Can’t do without it!,5.0,,Very convenient and easy-to use. I’d recommend that you buy a card if traveling vs the short-term use ones. These can be had at the airport (and be sure to ask for an MRT map).
,,"Very safe, clean and easy.",5.0,,"Absolutely use this with kids. Amazing service. Super clean, efficient, and so easy to use. Just remember not to eat or drink on the MRT, and absolutely no chewing gum. MRT will take you near to most major attractions, but not all."
,,Great transport system,5.0,,This is Very fast and extremely clean This is Very easy to use and cheap Be careful not to eat or drink whilst on the system as HEFTY fines apply
,,Amazing Metro,5.0,,"This is the cleanest metro you'll find anywhere in the world. Most places you'd like to visit in Singapore are accessible by metro, perhaps with the exception of the Zoo."

,,Clean and Convenient,5.0,,"Very clean and well connected. There is a 3 day unlimited pass for SGD 28, can be used to reach all the attractions."
,,We nailed it !,4.0,,My husband and I who are more mature travellers were in Singapore for five days and as the MRT station was almost right outside our hotel doors thought we would give it a go. Coming from a small rural NZ town we hadn’t had a lot to do with public transport so after a short lesson from the concierge at our hotel we headed off. The system is very well sign posted and the stations and trains very clean. The couple of times we were a little unsure there always seemed either staff or a friendly local to point us in the right direction. We even managed to be the one to help another younger than us traveller who had got caught and had no mobile phone. It is a very cheep and efficient way of getting around Singapore. Weekends the trains do get congested with locals out shopping and on their weekend outings.
,,Automated underground efficient and fast.,5.0,,Get a tourist pass which go from 1 to 3 days. The $10 ticket fee is refundable within 2 days of expiry. The trains run every 4 minutes so wait time is nominal. Get a map so you know when to change lines.
,,Daily usage of MRT,3.0,,"Breakdown after breakdown With the renewal of infrasture, early closure and later operation hours during the weekends bring inconveniences to all. Let us be patience and think of the future benefits that an update system brings."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Just buy ezcardNf go anywhere. Eady to travel. Not as good as hk, but excellent . Ezcard you can buy at any station for 7 sgd."
,,clean safe efficient,5.0,,I have observed children riding the metro for school and other activities. You would never see children on any of the major subways in the US unattended. There are many stations entry points and exits so no need to worry if you miss your stop you are never very far from your destination.
,,EZ CARD で快適移動！,5.0,,"東京では、当たり前のように外国人観光客の皆さんは、Suicaを使っています。 ということで、私たち日本人観光客も、シンガポールでは、EZ CARD 使いましょう！ チャージも簡単、乗り降りは、Suica同様のタッチで、楽々移動、しかも安い！ In Tokyo District, many foreign tourists use SUICA, convenient multi-use train card. So why don’t you use EZ CARD in Singapore? Very convenient and easy to use, including charge; TOP-UP! Have a nice day in SG with EZ CARD!"
,,Best public transport in the world!,5.0,,"Efficient, clean, organize... Singapore public transport has all you need to make your experience smooth and easy! Highly recommended if you have to move around in the city, simply buy a pre-paid card and you can use it also from and to the airport."

I was astonished to see such technology, and it is cheaper than moving through taxi, and faster than a bus! I highly recommend using the MRT! I felt VERY safe and it was SUPER clean!"
,,Clean and convenient,5.0,,"I can’t speak highly enough of the MRT! The system is super easy to use from buying a ticket to boarding the correct train.
We have just spent a week in Singapore and used the MRT every day to access different suburbs across the city. The ticket machines are easy to use... we chose single trips each time which were around S$1.30-S$1.80, or an all day unlimited tourist ticket is S$10.00.
*the machines only accept S$5 notes or lower.
The carriages are always spotless... probably due to the fact that eating, drinking and smoking are prohibited. Trains arrive on each line at intervals of 5-6 minutes."
,,The best ever public transport system.,5.0,,No doubt about the above statement. SMRT makes your journey so predictable and comfortable. No complaints whatsoever
,,Clean and Safe,5.0,,"Very clean and always felt safe, even as a woman traveling alone. Easy to use, well staffed. You can purchase one card that works on the MTR and the bus system."
,,Smooth,5.0,,Clean..on time... inexpensive..what more do you need from a public transport system...maps easy to follow and top up machines easy to follow for non residents..
,,Super easy to use,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT is not only safe and super clean, but also by far the easiest and most efficient way to get through the town - our teenage kids found their way on their own after the first day."
,,"Super efficient, clean, reasonably priced and air-conditioned train system",5.0,,Makes sightseeing in Singapore a breeze. We hardly used Grab / taxis. If you stay central there is usually 2 or 3 stations in the vicinity of the hotel. Recommend
,,Wonderfully efficient!,5.0,,So easy to use and easy to travel! This was the most clean and efficient way to travel! Everything was clean and clearly marked! Great service!!!
,,Easy and convenient,4.0,,Well connected. Ease of use. Safe and tidy. Underground eateries and shops make it eve better. When travelling with family...costs the same as a taxi...GRAB is cheaper and more convenient.

,,Easy,5.0,,The transport system in Singapore is so easy and wonderful to use! It has air con which is a complete must in the heat! Also there are signs everywhere so it’s easy to follow where it’s going but to also not miss your stop

,,EASIER TO TRAVEL THAN IN INDIA,5.0,,"I guess my title reveals the entire story. You do not have to stare at name boards which are in a language which you don't understand, illegible, stained or dirty. All you need to do is get into the station check on the kiosk for your destination and get going. We have to learn from Singapore about the importance of sign boards and route maps at public places. You are not lost and my wife was able to travel freely without having to seek directions any where.

,,Very affordable method of travelling from the airport to the city,5.0,,"As the title says, I used a train to get to the city, the staff were helpful, and I bought my ticket through the ticketing machine, which was featured in English. It was efficient, the other passengers were not a threat and I was able to find my hotel once getting off Bugis station."
,,"Good and efficient, but it's not an attraction",4.0,,"It's an efficient transport system that works well, but not the sort of thing you would make an effort to visit!"
,,Efficient MRT,5.0,,One of the best MRT and very efficient. It is clean and cost effective. The coverage is excellent. Singapore tourist pass gives unlimited access and convenience.
,,MRT,5.0,,"Straightforward and easy to use. Trains are clean, directions are fairly clear but people are helpful if a little confused. May have to walk, use the bus or cab for some of the places after coming off the MRT. It really is convenient and at least brings you most of the way."

,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The MRT in singapore is absolutely brilliant, it's so easy to get around and really inexpensive you may have to change trains a couple of times to get where you want to go but really thats not an issue. Much easier to use than I expected now it's all I use now to get around"

,,Great transport system,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is great. Very easy to use and very affordable. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Air conditioned and comfortable trains. So super clean and efficient.
,,One of the best out there,5.0,,"As far as my personal experience goes, I would rate SMRT amongst the best out there. Trains generally come within several minutes. I think 4 minutes is the maximum I ever waited.

I have heard some complaints from people about the recent breakdown etc but I personally haven't experienced it myself."
,,The best public transport!,5.0,,"Clean, fast, cheap! You can go everywhere, even to the airport for just some dollars, the service is fast and so easy to understand. I loved it."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The MRT is clean, efficient and very cheap! It was our prime mode of transport when visiting Singapore. Get the ez link card and top it up as required."
,,Now this is a real transport system,5.0,,Getting around Singapore with the MRT is just so easy. It was out first visit and we found it extremely simple. The trains come every few minutes. We have many trips when we didn’t wait for the train to arrive as it just pulled into the station. The busses are everywhere as well. The tourist pass is a must.
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"Won't say it's the best but it definitely ranks among top 30 in the world for public transport. It breaks down sometimes during peak hours which affect many working adults and students. Considering that it's the main mode of transport to almost 80% of Singaporeans the breakdown rate is quite impactful. But if you were to compare to some other country for e.g. India it's actually faster, cleaner and better in every aspect."
,,World Class,5.0,,"I have not been to this country in 20 years. The transit system which used to be great is even better now. More stops which makes sight seeing super convenient just using the transit system.

Buy an Ezlink card or tourist card and get set to tour Singapore on your own."
,,"Effective network, though some signage could be better",4.0,,"Effective network, though some signage could be better, leading us to let 3 trains go on our first trip before we understood the method of indicating the route."
,,Traveling around Singapore the SMaRT way.,4.0,,"From Changi Airport Terminal 2 you can go to just about anywhere in Singapore by MRT. Trains are clean, fast and efficient, and there are quite a few exchange terminals where you can transfer to another train. Many stations have Bus terminals nearby, and all have bus stops nearby. Miss your stop? NO problem. Just get off at the next stop, cross the platform to a train headed the other direction, and go back (except for some exchange stations where you may have to go up or down a level to get on a train going back."
,,Smrt,3.0,,No crowd control. Commuters are not properly educated. Priority seats are always filled up by non priority people
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,Recently stayed 4 nights in Singapore and purchased the visitor's 3 days pass which gives you unlimited MRT and Bus travel (some exceptions) for the 3 days. Singapore's MRT is fantastic.
,,"Excellent, reliable subway system -- wish they had more off-hour service",5.0,,"I've taken mass transit all over the planet, and this is one of the best rides I've experiences. It is cheap, fast, clean, and reliable (I expect it is heavily subsidized by the government). The network looks a bit haphazard and there are often several different ways to get from A to B, and it's not clear which is the ""right"" one, but that's not necessarily a problem. The EZLink stored-value cards get you cheaper fares and they work on the buses too. I have gone to Singapore for about 10 days per year for 8 straight years, and my original EZLink card is still working fine. My only real criticism is the hours of operation: they shut down before midnight and don't start up that early in the morning. I recently took the first train of the day to the airport -- it departed a downtown station around 6am and was already crowded."
,,Very efficient and spolessly clean,5.0,,We only travelled one day but found it efficient. Staff were helpful. It was spotless. London could learn a lot from Singapore.
,,Underground as it should be,5.0,,If you gave the folks responsible for London’s Underground a blank design canvas and an unlimited budget they would come up with the Singapore MRT. Enough said.
,,The Main Public Transport in Singapore,3.0,,"This is the main transport in Singapore.

It's simple to understand operate and use by anyone who visits the country. A well thought of and executed infrastructure which is the basic lifeline of the country.
Hats off to the planners."
,,Safe and speedy,5.0,,We took SMRT when arriving from the airport. Very speedy and safe way to get around SG. If take SMRT more than just a few times think about getting an EZ card from the beginning. It pays back quickly and can be used also in many taxis...
,,"reliable, efficiency, clean and one of the cheapest in the world",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is just like Singapore ... practical, efficient, reliable. It is very competitive with other mass transit systems in the world. Just a great way to go around the city."

,,Clean and irganized,5.0,,"Highly impressed by this train system. It’s so organized. Better than Toronto’s subway systems.

There are 2 types of machines at the station. One to print out a ticket that can be used up to 6 times and another with the more permanent plastic card.
To order a ride you follow the instructions in the screen. It tells you the price. For the up-to-6 rides card you can only pay cash.
The visa machine part can only be used for the permanent plastic ride cards.
There are workers around that are very helpful. As soon as they seen you looking lost or off, they come help you and guide you to where you want to go.

The trains come every 4mins and every 2mins depending on the lines.
They are spacious and clean since you aren’t allowed to eat or drink in public places.
Fast and safe and easy to use. Used it all the time in the 3 days we were there.
Would highly recommend- even with packs on our backs, it was easy and convenient to use."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Wish children rode for free, but the ticket machines were easy to operate and their website had a handy fare calculator you could use in conjunction with Google maps to find out how much trips cost in advance. Scrupulously clean and safe."
,,Great transportation!,5.0,,"The SMRT is some of the best in the world. It is CLEAN, COOL and runs efficiently and on time. I wish San Fransisco (THE BART) could take some notes!"
,,The Mrt experience,4.0,,"Fast and clean, always punctual and close to the most important spots. Only issue, closing early and really need to be careful about drinking and eating, huge fines are behind the corner..."

We had a 9 day stay in Singapore and purchased a card at the station and added $20 top up to our card. Over the 9 day period we spent approx $15 on transport including jumping on the buses. Tip - grab the SMRT map and get to know the city, the best way to know which line to get is to find the final destination of the train as this is how you work out which train to jump on."
,,Convenient & Efficient Transport,5.0,,"Singapore's subway brings you to all parts of Singapore. There are stations at or near all major attractions and shopping centres. Direction signs are clearly marked and there are maps at every station showing the different stops. Service staff are also on hand to provide necessary information.
Just purchase an EZ Link card and top it up with the amount you may need for your trip. You can use this card for both subway and buses. The cards are refundable at the end of your trip. Hope this is useful. Enjoy."
,,Singapore public transport,5.0,,I have used both the MRT and buses regularly. I have travelled extensively and no other country has comparable or better public transit.

,,Good public transport,5.0,,"Mrt is a good way to move around the Singapore, metro is clean, crowd is good, officials are helping. But the only concern is that, you need to keep the change handy. As ticket vending machines do not accept bigger currency then 5 dollar."

,,Excellent public transportation,5.0,,"Excellent public transportation my country should have, clean, on time, cheap, easy to access and close to delicious foods"
,,Very efficient!,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for a little less than a week, and we navigated the city using an app called Moovit. The said app told us which trains and buses to take, and gave us real time updates on when the trains and buses would arrive and depart. Because the SMRT is so efficient, it arrives and departs on time, and rarely experiences technical/operational difficulties (if at all). Definitely something to try if you're there. No need to take a Grab with this system in place.

Note: Their commute system mostly utilize the MRT card, which you must purchase separately for 5SGD (it doesn't come with consumable load). When you load the card, minimum amount must be 10SGD, and the trains will ask you to reload when your card is at ~3SGD load."

Overall, besides the usual peak prriods during pre- n after-office hours, the rides r generally on time, not crowded n comfortable.

It is very efficient to move around to favourite tourists attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park, Changi International Airport, Sentosa Island,etc.

These rides r comparable to any in Hkg SAR,London n Paris.

Enjoy the conveniences, cleanliness n safety in these rides."

,,Remember to use the public transport card!,4.0,,"In Singapore, you can reach almost anywhere, all attractions in Singapore can also be reach by the public transport. No food or drinks or smoking is allowed in the premise, which makes it clean!

There is this transport card in Singapore called the ""EZ Link"". Basically you need to have this card or you may be paying more than double for your transport. It clocks and charge for a total journey between bus and train, which gives a better discount from using cash.

Avoid peak hours as it could be crazy squeezing with the working professional."
,,Economical and easy to use,5.0,,"Clean, fast and covers most of the city. Lots of helpful staff for visitors trying to find their way around the city."

,,A Singapore experience.,5.0,,"Besides food, mock up tourist attractions, and it's cross culture, cosmopolitan uniqueness, one of the must try in Singapore is it's MRT. Mass Rapid Transit.
It may not have yet achieve it's target of reaching all corners of Singapore, it has covered the majority if not all the tourist attractions.
If you do not know anyone with a car in Singapore, get on its public transport especially the MRT. It is not too crowded even during rush hours. Google the eateries just within walking distance of its stations. You will find aplenty.
All the train and stations are air-conditioned, and there are provisions of priority seats for elderlies, pregnant ladies, and people who need to sit. Some of the stations are linked with shopping malls and activity centers and attractions.
The fares are reasonable, and indeed a good way to go around Singapore.
You can get a refund for your fare smart card if you still have a balance in it. (Card plus balance)
Do not forget to ask for a MRT map from any station, or download one from the Apps.
Enjoy your way around Singapore."

,,I dont know why this have to be reviewed,4.0,,"As a tourist in sg, i will never cease to be amazed by how organized your rail system works. Although i have a very low benchmark as i came from ph, having visited japan at least once in the past, i can say that i prefer sg mrt more.. probably because it is more tourist friendly/accessible and because of its newer aesthetics.

Overall, keep up the good work and i hope my country emulates it."

,,Very efficient and clean,5.0,,Great way to travel around Singapore in air-conditioned trains. Very clean... cheap way of travel to see everything
,,Modern / Efficient Frequent / Clean,5.0,,Singapore puts many other cities to shame. Predictable and frequent trains. They even advise which how packed each train car is so you can best position yourself. Only two complaints is the limited number of vending machines for single-return tickets. It's a little bit of a process. And the trains wait too long at each station (first world problems).
,,Excellent transport system in Singapore!,5.0,,"It´s really an efficient transport system, easy to use and very convenient if you want to move around in Singapore"

,,So easy to use,5.0,,"London Underground could learn a thing or two from SMRT. As a London commuter I spend a lot of time on the underground and feel I am able to pass comment on other countries underground systems. This system is efficient with lots of little extras that make commuting easy. Signs tell you which way the train is travelling, which doors are going to open and which stop is next. I also loved the cartoon characters which guided commuters how to behave. ""Bag down Benny"", Hush, hush Hannah"" and ""Sit down Stacey"", can't see it working at 8am on the central line but I can live in hope :)"
,,Singapore travel,5.0,,MRT is in Singapore is known for its best operations. Connectivity and punctuality are the key Driver which helps the visitors to move around the city easily. Keep up the good work SMRT.

,,Great way to get round Singapore,4.0,,"Extremely clean, cheap, efficient way to see Singapore. Average cost per single journey is about SING 1.50. Buy your ticket at the machine but most machines only seem to take up to a maximum of $5 notes and coins. The machine would not accept anything over $5. The lines do not cover all of Singapore and are not that well connected but we found we could navigate to most locations. Highly recommended."

,,Mode of transportation,4.0,,"Taking the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) will cut down travel time especially if traveling during off peak hours ( peak hours are morning 7-930, evening 530-8). Buy an EZ link card for $5 and top up another $10 which will be deducted as fares for rides. The fare deducted is less then the amount paid for a single trip ticket ( bought at the machine). Hence it’s more cost efficient and it saves you the trouble of queuing to get tickets for every ride. The amount you saved on the rides will cover the cost of the card deposit , with the added convenience."

,,Easy,5.0,,"I was on my own and found this system so easy to use. The trains are very clean, air conditioned and look brand new. The stations are the same.

The train and stations are so very clean (you can not eat on either). There is plenty of standing room and seats, people are really friendly. There are maps at every station and on the trains that you can not miss your stop. One of the easiest way to get around Singapore. Can not rave about this any more - absolutely must use when your in Singapore."

,,Easy,4.0,,"If you buy the ez-link card at the station and put some extra money on it, it is quite easy to use it getting on and off the train. There is also an app for it but it looks like you have to live in Singapore to get access through the app."

,,Cleanest Subway System in the World,5.0,,"I've ridden subways extensivy in NYC, Tokyo, Greece, London, Paris, Germany, etc, and can confidently say Singapore's MRT is the cleanest.

,,HIGHLY EFFICIENT,5.0,,"This is the best transport to take so long as the places to go in Singapore are within walking distance from the MRT stations. As foreigners to Singapore, I find the staff there are extremely helpful."
,,Singapore tourist pass is all you need to go around ....,5.0,,"Frequency is too good and always on time. If you follow metro, you can get around almost all the major attractions of Singapore in two days. Really efficient service. Get a singapore pass as soon as you land in Singapore and then enjoy the ride. You can get the deposit back when you return the card. Too good and cheap as compared to any other means of transport in Singapore. Very clean stations..."

,,Amazing rail system,5.0,,"Got a bit lost. A helpful local lady took us down to the SMRT station and left us with the station master. After explaining our situation to the station master, she let us go in without a ticket. We traveled to the next station and exited. The staff at the exit station were already aware of our plight and let us exit without a ticket."

Get aquatinted with the area you go to and Check which exit (A,B, C, etc ) to use, to make sure to end up the right place. If you are 3-4 people the taxi might be cheaper inside the city (taxi center - airport 57$)"
,,Really efficient,5.0,,"The MRT is an excellent and cheap way to get around Singapore, including to and from Changi Airport. Very fast, clean and regular services. Recommend purchasing an EZ-Link card (SGD$5 non-refundable) so you can load up your card with cash and then tap on and off for your rides.

,,"Timely, clean, fast and easy",5.0,,"With locality and route maps posted clearly at every station and a route map with 'next station' indicator by every door in every carriage this is the easiest public transport I've seen so far. Trains are frequent, clean and fast. The need for cars and taxis is virtually eliminated unless you have heavy luggage."

,,Eazy way to travell,5.0,,MRT is the eaziest way to travel all over the Singapore. Its fast and save your money when compare to Singapore taxi service. If you gonna stay two days or more its better to take Singapore tour pass to travel on MRT
,,Excellent and effective transport system.,4.0,,"A very efficient transport system when moving around Singapore. This is a very well signposted system, both within the stations and in the vicinity outside, including coloured signs relevant to each line, and indicators in the trains themselves. The longest we had to wait in 4 days of travel was 4 minutes - So much better than we have to endure in Sydney! The only downside was having to wait 40 mins at Bugis station ticket office for our 3 day pass on our first day. After this travelling was an easy and effective way of getting from one place to another."
,,Outstanding rail service,4.0,,"The SMRT sure leads the way, world wide, as to how public transport should be expected to run. So easy, to obtain tickets, read the different routes, and if you miss a train another is on its way. Easy from the airport to where ever you need to go to. Seems 100% safe"
,,Great transportation service,5.0,,"No delays and or whatsoever, it gave me such an ease to actually go around Singapore without any hassle. Very clean although there were so many people that use it."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"We love the MRT here. It’s cheap (compared to taxi and grab), it’s fast, it’s clean, and it goes to almost every main tourist location. It’s easy to use as long as you get an Ez Link card!"
,,Fast and clean,5.0,,"Fast, clean and reliable. The SMRT is the cheapest and best way to discover the city. Trains run every few minutes so if you miss one you only have to wait a couple of minutes for the next tom arrive. Easy to navigate your way around, even to and from the airport."
,,efficient on time clean,5.0,,prepurchase a travel card that can be topped up every trip onlly S$2 very organised easy to find your way around and plenty of the public will offer to help if needed
,,Fast and easy and very cheap,4.0,,"Excellent and very clean stations, fast and easy to use and ridiculously cheap. Getting around SG is so easy with public transport."
,,SMRT is very clean frequent and reliable.,5.0,,"This is the best form of transport in Singapore. It's accessible, affordable and trains are very frequent."
,,Best way to get around!,5.0,,"Extremely safe and great, punctual service. This is definitely the best way to get around Singapore - and it is cheap compared to other cities such as Paris or London!"
,,Efficient and clean,5.0,,"Making travelling in Singapore a joy in itself. Fast, frequent and convenient. Extensive coverage and super clean"
,,One of the best in singapore,4.0,,"As we know japan is very punctual in mrf, I suggest even a tourist should experience met in singapore for its on time running and technology at its best, whether ticketing or platform maintainence or time interval between trains or buses."
,,The best transportation in Asia,5.0,,One of the best and most powerful public transportation I have ever experienced. Well done Singapore Govt.
,,Superb system,5.0,,"This is the best public transport system I've ever seen! Easy, clean, cheap and only a few minutes between trains."
,,"Easy l, efficient and fast, and very cheap!",5.0,,"Suggest buying the card for S$7 which gives you $5worth of travel. It’s a tap on tap off system and works on all public transport. The MRT doesn’t go everywhere but is extensive and is growing.

Importantly it’s airconditioned and while busy, not yet as packed as some other Asian cities.

Also very reliable. Just suggest if travelling for business, wear comfy shoes for the commute. As there is a bit of walking - in air conditioned tunnels."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Excellent public transport system. Purchase a multiple use card for best value. Underground malls are modern and easily fill any waiting time.
,,Wonderful Mass Transit in Singapore,5.0,,"This transit system is very reliable and comfortable, even for visiting many places for sight seeing. For some sections it runs above the ground so that you will enjoy seeing many buildings and landscapes in Singapore. Young people commonly yield their seats to elderly people, which was very nice to us."
,,"Perfectly on time, perfectly clean - even the Swiss get jealous :-)",5.0,,"Ok I am Swiss and I am used to punctuality (after all we are the epicenter of watches) and cleanliness. But the standard of the SMRT astonished even me. At every station you have a helpful person to assist you with your questions. You could probably eat from the floor, it is that clean and the network is very good and efficient. Respect !"
,,Super efficient and clean,5.0,,If you are staying longer than a day then use the Tourist Pass. You are bound to get lost and the cost of trips add up. Having these free was super helpful.
,,Great,5.0,,"If not going by taxi to see the sights
Take this rail Its clean and its safe easy to work out where to get on and off get a pass for the number of days you are there IRS well worth the money
You will enjoy your time here.
Call in to rafflels for a g@t
And see the sights"
,,Much easier to navigate than London Underground.,5.0,,"We are used to travelling on London Underground so did not think twice about using the MRT. Everything about the system is much simpler, tickets can be purchased using an interactive map which is really easy to use, even my technophobic husband found it simple. Journeys are cheap but you can save if you top up the same ticket. The trains also use technology to inform you the route, which station you are approaching and which side of the train you have to leave from. Dhouby Ghaut seemed to be the central station, we changed trains here on many of our journeys. The colour coded lines are clear, similar to many other cities.
On the one occasion we got a bit confused about where we were going a couple of local people offered to assist."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,We were in Singapore for 1 week so getting the card was well worth it. This metro is way better than the subway system in any USA city.
,,Fantastic rail system,5.0,,Singapore’s rail system is fantastic! There’s only a few minutes between trains and it’s defentky priced
,,Singapore MRT (under ground and above ground train),4.0,,"Its very fast and clean mode of transport in Singapore. Only Stations you need to care about is changing one line to another line, you need to follow the signage carefully. You have any difficulties to find way you can approach the station staff usually located at the ticket counter."
,,Way to Go,5.0,,"By far, this is the ONLY way to go see Singapore. Very reliable transport to get you about the city and suburbs, we found the SMRT the most economical way to get about various attractions around Singapore. The train system was clean and on time, as was the buses. The taxi system was efficient with friendly drivers who acted as tourist guides as well. The best way to see Singapore."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,It's easy and convenient to use. Me being a tourist didn't find any problem whatsoever to travel to different locations and change different trains for different routes. Every station has details of the station and route map. Ez card is easy to use
,,"Easy, clean, efficient",5.0,,"We travelled by MRT most of our stay in Singapore, the system is quick, efficient and clean. You can get to pretty much anywhere in a short amount of time and ease of use. It took us a few rides to remember the line we needed next time but if you forget there was plenty of info boards or service counters around. Best of all in the city it's underground so a lot cooler than walking the streets. Fares are cheap too - get a Singapore pass and receive a refund for the card and any money you didn't use whilst on you stay! Great transport system!!"
,,Professional,4.0,,The integrated system (Underground trains + bus) allows to cover all the town in a reasonable time; there is also the possibility to leave Singapore for Malaysia simply taking the bus.
,,Best Way To Get Around Singapore!,5.0,,"SMRT is the best way to get around Singapore. Cheap, efficient,and reliable! One can pick up a pass at the airport, and you are good to go! You can also always top up your care once it gets done to around $2.50."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Even in ""rush hour"" a very clean and efficient service, so cheap too ! Travelled from City Hall to Newton (return)"
,,SMRT so easy to use,5.0,,"Best way to travel around Singapore so easy, clean and quick. Staff really helpful. Best thing is it’s so cheap."
,,World Class,5.0,,"One of the best transport systems - clean, no graffiti or rubbish. Very people friendly. Definitely a well planned and respected transport system - grab a tourist pass and use it!!"
,,The best way to get from A to B (or anywhere else),5.0,,"By an EZLink card for $12 at the first MRT station you use. Top it up at a ticket machine when you need to - there's a You Tube video to show you how and get a refund at the end of your trip for any unused credit. The MRT is clean, safe and the quickest way to get to most places in Singapore. It doesn't go all the way to the Zoo or the Bird Park so you'll have to get a bus or a taxi for the last leg but otherwise it's excellent. Access on almost every station is by escalator or by lift and the maps and signage are excellent. Just remember not to eat or drink while on the MRT or in the stations!"
,,"Clean, functional and prompt",5.0,,"And their driverless trains are 'state of the art'
A convenient and inexpensive way to get around town; sadly of course , you have to forego the sights and sounds above ground, but as a way of getting to work or from A to B, this is an enviable solution"
,,From Robertson Quay to the Bay and return,4.0,,"We use SMRT whenever we are in Singapore as it’s reliable, on time, clean, cheap and quick. Minor hitch with the return train this trip but there was frequent information provided to keep passengers updated. Overall much better than our public transport in Brisbane, Australia."
,,"Clean, but crowded",3.0,,"Very clean, pleasant ride if somewhat crowded. Rather well known in the past for breakdowns and delays but I’ve never experienced them myself and the number of incidents seemed to have dropped sharply. Overall a great way to get around."
,,"Clean, fast and efficient",5.0,,The subway covers most of Singapore. Warning!!! : you are not allowed to eat or drink (even your own bottled water) inside the train. (This is how they keep it so clean!)
,,Another Family Trip to Singapore,4.0,,"We always choose MRT as local transportation in Singapore, from Changi to our staying hotel at Orchard we take this mass transportation. Its very easy to use this transportation to go anywhere in singapore."
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"Once you understand how to use ticketing system it is a great way to get around. We purchased a 10c card which we just added trips to, so you only have to pay as you use. All transactions are done at an ""ATM"", but they are pretty self explanatory. The only challenge was having cash to pay for the tickets. Train stations are very organised and trains came very frequently. Because train stations intersect, no destination is hard to get to, even the airport."
,,"Extensive Network, Fast, Clean, Inexpensive",5.0,,"We used SMRT several times while we were in Singapore, including a trip from Changi in to our hotel the first day.

A very extensive network covers almost everywhere you'd like to go.

Frequent trains. Fast. Clean. Relatively Inexpensive.

One con: At some of the connecting stations there is a bit of a hike between lines."
,,Great public transport!,5.0,,"I wish the other cities in the world got a public transport like this! These lines are near the most important places, you can reach everything with it! Fast, precise, and it comes oftenly. Singapore Pass is great if you are staying there for a few days."
,,Good service,4.0,,Singapore offers very good MRT service. The network of MRT can reach many corners of this city state. Only one complaint though: the speed of the escalators is too fast. Perhaps Singapore is still a very young country so it does not matter now. Give it another twenty years I would predict that their MRT has to slow down the moving speed of the escators.
,,Superb - Really set´s a high standard,5.0,,"It´s reliable, fast, very clean and safe !! We are travelling to Singapore and around quite often. MRT is our first choice getting around Singapore unless we are carrying a lot of luggage or are going to some more ""remote"" locations in Singapore.
In many large cities in Europe or the US you might not feel comfortable to use the subway or tram at certain times of day.
Singapore MRT brings you to all its stations fast and safe at any time!"
,,What an underground experience!,5.0,,"My wife and I booked the 3 day Singapore Tourist Pass at Changi Airport - well worth the money, if you are staying for a few days. The SMRT system is clean, fast, efficient and user friendly. Getting to and from the stations by escalators, lifts and stairs was easy. There are plenty of signs and directional arrows - with each of the lines in a colour code. Stations were clean, with glass barriers between the platform and the rail line - with trains stopping exactly by each of the platform doors, making entry / exit straight forward. The trains were modern, with maps and lights indicating the next station & which side of the carriage for exit. A/C on the trains enabled passengers to cool down after temperatures above ground were a hot and sticky 31 degrees. The SMRT serves the 5 million plus residents of Singapore and visitors really well and we would most certainly use it on our next visit."
,,easy to get around,5.0,,"We used MRT to get around Singapore for a week. This has to be the best public Transport we have ever used. Clean, efficient and on time. Locals are a great help if you need advice or help"
,,Train System is extremely to use,5.0,,The trains are extremely easy to navigate and use to get around. Prices are extremely cheap also. Extremely diligent with time and trains are extremely clean with no rubbish or graffitti
,,Reliable mass transportation,5.0,,"Precise and punctual time schedule. Well-integrated transportation in the city, very clean and effective sign system."
,,Get a Tourist Pass!! Simplify your time in Singapore,5.0,,"Traveling on the MRT is easy, fast and the trains / stations are clean. If you are only making few trips you may want to just pay as you go, but the 1,2 & 3 day passes eliminate the need to keep purchasing tickets are are not expensive.

You will be charged an additional 50 cents to purchase the card with a credit card and the $10 deposit will be refunded in cash."
,,"Great, clean and comfortable Train system.",5.0,,"The train system was safe, clean and overall comfortable. It got us where we needed to go in the city quite well."
,,Just okay,3.0,,Not sure why people been raving so much about their mrt since I found it just okay. Mrt in korea is much better imo. Don’t know what their ac arrangement is but damn it’s not cool enough.
,,Stop over holiday.,5.0,,"MRT very easy to use, very cheap, quick. Once you work out the ticket machine, which is easy to use, put in destination, one way or return, tells you price and you get your ticket. Watch what others do to get through barrier..similar to others in the world
Very well sign posted. Only problem is finding correct way out...make sure you have an idea of street names you want and where to go on leaving MRT. Got lost getting off a couple of times but people helpful. Great to get around."
,,Superb Experience,5.0,,"We traveled to Singapore in June 2018 for a vacation & were staying in Little India, we used MRT on daily basis to travel,its very well connected across the city,the stations are neat & clean,most of them are connected to malls,there are elevators available for kids & old people,the staff is also very helpful.
The frequency of trains is every 4 minutes & the trains are stroller friendly.
Its the fastest & best mode of transport in Singapore & would highly recommend it."
,,Fast clean and efficient,5.0,,"What can I say. Once we mastered the tickets, you must have small notes, plain sailing! Easy routes across town. Escalators and so clean. Fines for smoking or eating!!"
,,Great transport system,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is a great train service. It is very clean and safe and easy to get around on. Map of trains is very easy to follow and buying a ticket is simple.
,,Very Convenient,5.0,,Its very convenient but very crowded. Easy to access and kids friendly. I would highly recommend to use MRT.
,,Best subway ever used,5.0,,"Very clean, safe and efficient, we used the subway system with extended family me,beers ranging in age from 9 to 70 easily. You do need to pre-purchase a card and when you have done that, the minimum top up is $10 at a time, but you can get the balance back at the airport when you leave."
,,Great rail system,5.0,,The Singapore rail system is very clean & organized. We purchased the 3 day tourist ticket for $30 ($10 will be refunded upon return of the ticket). Each train line is colour coded and it’s easy to work out which line to get on.
,,"Fast, clean, efficient",5.0,,"If you've been on the Tube in London, this is similar but much cleaner. We found that we were able to get within a few minutes walk of all the major attractions and it was 10-30 minutes to get just about anywhere. The 3 day Tourist Pass was an excellent value giving us unlimited rides for the 3 days. Crowds could be somewhat heavy at peak times, but tons of trains meant there was never really an issue with being packed in too tight."
,,Get There On Time,5.0,,"Singapore is a small island. With an efficient transport system like the MRT, there is no reason to be late. My recent trip from Kent Ridge to Bugis by MRT was simply blissful. Timing was easy to plan. I was on time for my appointment at Gateway. No headaches about looking for parking lots and parking charges. Traveling in aircon comfort and pleasantly clean train means I got there feeling fresh and alert for my meeting. Will definitely use the MRT again to get to my meetings."
,,COMFORTABLE RIDE,5.0,,"We (2 persons) had to travel from Simei to Chua Chu Kang. Options available were Normal Taxi, Grabshare, Grabhitch and SMRT.

We preferred to travel by SMRT to have a first hand experience.

The Coaches were meticulously maintained, The air-conditioning system was very good. The announcement System and the Visual Display of past, current, next and subsequent stations was very good.

As it was off-peak hour, the rush was not that much, both of us could easily get a seat.

We had to change over from EW line to NS line at Jurong East. The change-over was very smooth. As our Coach entered the Platform of Jurong East, another MRT of the NS line entered the opposite Platform. What a synchronisation !!!

The level of train and the platform were exactly the same. Gap between the train and the platform was the minimum, but still there were constant announcements to mind the platform gap."
,,How can a metro system be this good?,5.0,,"Every metro I’ve been on pretty much sucks. But this one blew me away about how amazing it was, the trains are always on time, clean, spacious, not many ads inside, has easy information and great ticket prices. Gets you anywhere. If only all other metro systems were this good."
,,Spotless and efficient MRT,5.0,,If only London could match the Singapore MRT! Beautifully clean with friendly and helpful staff on hand to help even the most inexperienced of travellers! So easy to get around the city in air conditioned comfort.
,,very convenient and easy to use,4.0,,"We love walking no matter where we go. However sometimes it is a little to far or hot or raining and you can do no better than use the MRT. Very easy to use, inexpensive and frequent. Just at the station we used the escalator was very fast so had to watch it the first time we used it."
,,Very versatile / convenient mode of transport,5.0,,MRT is very good and convenient source of movement all over Singapore. It covers all routes and is very well maintained for cleanliness and punctuality.
,,Avoid peak hours,4.0,,Train rides in Singapore is definitely convenient putting aside the random break down occasionally. The train cabins are clean and free of trash. Consider spacious I would say. Enjoy my rides
,,My SMRT card expired!,5.0,,After 4 or so years of use on holidays my SMRT card expired with $12 credit on it. If this happens to you go to Orchard Station where there is a small office in which they can issue a new card (costs $2) and transfer the credit for you. Helpful info if you have lots of credit on the card or are a tight fisted miserable fella like myself :)
,,Get a tourist pass,5.0,,"The MRT is easy to use, clean and extremely regular. Get a 1,2 or 3 day pass and then you don’t have to worry about purchasing tickets every day. Highly recommend the MRT for any length of stay in Singapore."
,,Rivals Any Other Metro in Any Other Country!,5.0,,"Clean, safe, easy to follow, and gets you anywhere - the Singapore MRT is clearly a result of the country's careful urban planning. Purchase the one (two and three) - day passes for only $10/per day - it's a great deal. We were able to get anywhere we wanted!"
,,Best public transport ever used!,5.0,,"Visited as a tourist, got a three day pass for $20 best investment ever. Very clean and safe. Easy to use and reliable. Staff eager to help as are the locals when they spot your tourist pass!
Didn’t use this going to and from the airport but heard that service was good too."
,,What a way to travel,5.0,,"MRT is the way to travel.
So fast, so clean and so easy to get around.
We were so impressed with the politeness of people when getting on and off the MRT.
The MRT is a fast way to travel around Singapore wish we had a system like this in Australia."
,,Reliable,5.0,,"Reliable, affordable mass transit system. Better than the NYC subway which I use back at home. Not sure why this has made it onto the activity list on TripAdvisor. It is not an activity, it is just a way to get around."
,,SMRT Review,5.0,,"It is easy to go around Singapore using the SMRT. It is fast, safe, and easy to navigate. If you are having an extended stay, instead of using the Tourist pass, avail the reloadable cards, it is far more convenient if you are staying for more than three days."
,,Good enough,4.0,,"Singapore's MRT is decent tough it could be better (that could be said of any transit system worldwide). On our first visit to Singapore we walked everywhere, this visit we took a few rides on the MRT. The stations are pretty sterile and the ticket machines are not visitor-friendly. We couldn't easily figure out the total amount we wanted to put in partly because the charge, like many systems, varies depending on your destination. Since we were only going to use it for one day we opted for the ticket that has a 0.10 SGD surcharge that is applied back on your third ride. The distances between stations can be lengthy and some stations that are near one another are on different lines, so they do interconnect but not in a direct way. The NYC system has similar stations that interconnect in that manner but I prefer the NYC subway because it stops more frequently (less distance between stations) and there is only one price you pay as long as you stay within the zone. Of course Singapore's MRT is much, much cleaner. We asked the transit station attendant if we could catch the MRT from the Marina South Pier station to Changi International Airport and she said no, take a taxi. Interestingly the map appears to show that one could take the metro to the airport from the cruise terminal station. It would entail pulling your luggage a good one-quarter mile and some station changes. Having now taken taxis to the airport on weekends the taxis are quick. Of course there is a cost difference. As an example the MRT fare was listed at 2.50 SGD from Marina South Pier station to Changi International Airport but would take about 1 hour. The taxi fare was 32 SGD (for 2 people) before tips but took maybe 20-25 minutes. So you need to weigh out cost versus convenience and time."
,,Great for getting about,5.0,,"I used the SMRT throughout my visit, I would recommend getting a prepaid card and adding another 10 SD to it, this should cover you for a week. You can always top-up if needed. The remaining balance is displayed every time you use it. This helps you to avoid queues for tickets.

The train network is great for getting around Singapore, but with each station having many exists you can easily get lost when you leave a station."
,,Used it always,4.0,,"Stayed for a month is Singapore, found it very easy to to understand, and fares much cheaper then we expected. Very clean and on time, never had to wait to long for it."
,,Amazing!,5.0,,Singapore MRT was so efficient and so cheap! The map was very easy to read for visitors to Singapore.
,,Easy Travel,5.0,,Buy a E card for $20 ( includes $5 deposit) and you have $15 on your card which you can top up . Card is good for 4 years so what you do not use you can use on your next trip. $15 goes a long way. In 10 days did not need to top up and used Buses and trains daily and also used it to go to Sentosa by train
,,It's near perfect as far as city transit trains go,5.0,,"I've already said the MRT is near perfect, so I will only point out the areas that I would look at for improvement.

I had a difficult time sorting out what ticket to buy the very first time we landed in Singapore. Now that I'm familiar with the system, I get it. I think they didn't thoroughly think through the visitors experience as much as the daily users experience. There is a daily pass that is offered to visitors, but even the staff will steer you away from it if it doesn't make sense given your plans.

The maps are fantastic, but they are not on the trains. It would be so helpful to have the complete train maps in the trains! Maps are available only at the place you've purchased your ticket. Once you've left the ticket pass through areas to head down or up to your train, you will not see another map. Yes, these are avail on the web or on paper (wasteful), but it would be helpful if the trains map we're onboard the trains.

The red line (Orchard line) is jerky at the stop, so hold on until it really, really stops.

Many stops run beneath a shopping center, which is pretty convenient as there's usually a grocer in these malls.

The trains run on time, and are clean and predictable.

You'll notice odd advertisements in the train stations: bleeding terror victims promoting an agency or perhaps instilling fear (maybe both) or childish cartoons that attempt to teach the population how to be well behaved. Just be thankful for the jewelry ads or the like, which are a welcome relief."
,,Every capital city in the world need this system,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is absolutely fantastic. Easy to work your way around the system. Trains, platforms and concourse areas are extremely clean. Trains run frequently. All stations are accessible by Escalators or Lifts."
,,MRT,5.0,,Such a great public transport system very easy to use and very clean. You can top up your ticket at any time. If I can do it anyone can.
,,Hassle Free and super safe transport,5.0,,No need for car or taxi until appr. 11 pm if you want to go to most popular venues. Absolutely safe and well organized ( English speaking helpers at nearly Evette station at hot spots) it is one reason I like to discover this city.
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"Fast & efficient. I got a feeling that there is almost always a train in next 4 minutes. Friendly people give seats to those that need them more - friendliness is encouraged with posters all over the SMRT network! If you want to buy a 3 day tourist card, be prepared to wait in a queue and try not to get too nervous (as the tourists might lack the abovementioned trait:-)"
,,MRT for the win,5.0,,"Sure, the metro system is one that runs in the heart of every Metropolitan city, but Singapore gets it so right with it's public transport that it has in itself become a tourist attraction. Connecting the major parts of the city. The MRT stations are gorgeous and the staff so very helpful."
,,Singapore's MRT system,4.0,,"Singapore has one of the best Rapid Transit systems in the world. Although the network is not as extensive as HKG or TYO, Singapore's MRT system is Fast, efficient, clean and state of the art! Most lines are now 'Driverless', which means, these lines are fully underground. All visitors to Singapore must experience this mode of transport."
,,Using the SMRT to travel,5.0,,"It’s undercover and out of the weather, you should plan ahead and check what stations you are going to before you buy your ticket. Cheaper than taxi for one person. Clean and safe, the map is generally easy to follow."
,,convenient,4.0,,"It is extremely convenient to take an MRT to everywhere. They run often.
The reason they can't get 5star from me is because they stop services around 23:40 , quite early for a service that does not even hae drivers. Also the stops that you must go writes only at the platforms that you must take. It would be easier for the non locals if the stops would write in beginning of the escelators so we would know better which escalator to take."
,,3 day vist,5.0,,"One of the best ways to get around Singapore. Very inexpensive, quick, and once you have sorted out what the colours mean it is a great way to travel on the cleanest trains you will ever be in."
,,"cheap, efficient, on time",5.0,,Can't really complain about the SMRT system. It's the easiest and cheapest way to get around Singapore!
,,Comfortable reliable safe means of daily commute,5.0,,"Reliable, safe, clean and comfortable with sufficient coverage of the city state. The service is amongst the best public transport systems in Asia."
,,Excellent and Convenient,5.0,,"I can say proudly that Singapore is one of the most convenient country with train. Every small part of Singapore have train nowadays, still growing. It has made us singaporean so convenient to travel around Everyday. Thanks SMRT!"
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Singapore subway system MRT is one of the most clean and efficient systems in the world. Please note there is no eating or drinking on the platform or trains. With the government investing in subway the footprint is continuing to expand so you can get most places now underground
,,One of the best subway systems in the world.,5.0,,"I've ridden the BART, the ""L"", NY Subway, Boston's T and the Washington Metro and Singapore's MRT is by far the best. Clean, safe and an affordable way of getting around the island."
,,Great! But be careful with escalators for seniors and little ones,5.0,,"The subway system is great! It’s fast, clean, and did I mention clean?! The only drawback (which is still a winning point for healthy young folks), is the speed of the escalator. Since it’s about four floors down, the escalator makes up the slack by going at a fast soeed( id day about 3-4x of the escalator speed at the mall or say the Toronto subway escalators in Canada). My mother in law actually couldn’t maintain balance on one of the times (our last time) using the escalator and my father in law fell at the bottom while looking back at my mother in law . Some really nice passerby’s helped us to get him up. We have learned our lesson the hard way- started using the elevator since then. We also travelled with our two year old who loves escalators but we didn’t dare to let him use the escalators at the subway system due to the speed!

Also love that their single tickets are reusable! On the third reused trip u get 10 cents off and another 10-20 cents on the sixth trip! It can be re-used a total of six times. Promotes being environmental!"
,,Good mode of tranportation,3.0,,Its good mode of transportation for tourists. Don't think I will call it as tourist attraction. They need to improve especially running the late services. Directions to the station should be sign posted more than what they have on display.
,,Amazing subway system,5.0,,"Clean, well-orgaznied, efficient, and affordable in an amazing network of lines and stations all over the island. Such a great way to get around. Getting to the airport was also a piece of cake even though you have to change trains. One of the best in the world!"
,,A well run public transit system,5.0,,"Singapore shines with its public transport and city planners from Australia could learn a lot about how to run an effective public transport system which is well patronised because it is good. Frequent services is a good start, large stations, clean and with no beggars hassling you at the entrance ways. Inexpensive and easy to navigate."
,,MRT,3.0,,"The fastest and greatest way to get around Singapore CBD either along the orchard road or little bit off the cityb limits.
Saves you the taxi fare around the city. Get yourself a MRT day pass or if you are staying for a week or so, buy a MRT ticket so you can even use it on the bus rides"
,,Best train service I have regularly used,5.0,,"people rave over Japan railways however Singapore's is better because it is less crowded, only requires one card and mostly doesn't breakdown. Of course Japan has a bigger area to cover but the multiple companies running the trains destroys the ease."
,,Smooth operator,5.0,,"Use the MRT when in Singapore. It is safe, clean and cheap and with a huge net, so you can reach a lot of places without having to walk too long."
,,Excellent way to get around,5.0,,We used the mrt several times and found it easy. Trains run constantly and on time. Fairs are cheap.
,,A valuable tip for visitors staying more than a few days in Singapore,5.0,,"Visitors to Singapore are told about the 1/2/3 day all you can travel tourist passes. However, I suggest that you consider purchasing a typical mass transit pass that locals purchase. You can add as much $on want on it, and any unused amount can be refunded at any metro station or at the airport. We found this extremely cost effective because we ended up paying for only trips we made rather than just paying a lump sum. Also, doing so you will not be losing $ if you decide to take a day off from traveling/sight seeing."
,,"Wow, what a system!",5.0,,"It has taken us just a few minutes to navigate just about anywhere, figure out the price and get on the MRT. I read about the history and it took the government quite a while to design and implement this system -- but it is incredible that they have done it and that it is so efficient, clean and well designed.

We come from Australia and it certainly is a different story at home."
,,More British than the London Underground,5.0,,"We purchased a 3 day Singapore Tourist Pass at Changi on arrival. Very, very easy to navigate your way around. Very efficient, safe, clean and well organised. Everything in English. . ""Mind the Platform Gap"""
,,so easy to get around,5.0,,"It’s so easy to get around Singapore on the MRT. We got a 3 day tourist pass, which meant we had unlimited travel for the 3 days. If you return your cards at the end you will receive $10 refund for every card returned. I downloaded a MRT app, but found I really didn’t need it. The signs at each station make it easy to find the right platform. Trains arrive within a few minutes and on the trains there is signage for the next stations as well as the announcements. We will definitely get MRT cards again."
,,World class,5.0,,You'd never get lost as long as you know how to read and ask questions. Cool. 😎 People are generally helpful.
,,Efficient. Clean and safe!,5.0,,"The MRT is a safe and fast wasbto traverse the city . Tourist cards for a few days travel are easily obtained at major stations . This enables you to ‘tag on and off’ like the locals so you do have to queue for a ticket each ride. Money left on the card is refunded at the end of you stay if you take it back to a major station.
Be warned . Some walks underground are extremely long and not suitable for those that have leg or knee problems. The plus side to these walks through the underground is that they are mostly full of shops and food outlets so it’s another adventure
I allowed my 13 year old to use the train system alone as it is so very safe.
Follow their signs and obey their courtesy ‘rules ‘ and it’s a pleasant ride for all"
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"It's cheap, quick and so easy to use. Give it a go and you won't go back to sitting in traffic in taxis.
Check out the day tickets for unlimited day travel. $20 (Singapore) but you get $10 back once you return the card at any station ticket office.
Very handy if you want to see lots of places around the city in a day."

We found the MRT easy to use.
You can buy passes for 1, 2,or 3 days.
Train stations are easy to find and navigate around. Staff at the stations were helpful. We were able to visit a lot of places using the MRT."
,,Great means of transport & effcient,5.0,,"Great option for moving around Singapore easily. If staying for a number of days would advise getting a 1 - 5 day all-in pass card, as waster far too much time buying (or re-loading) card for seperate journeys. Can get very busy and crowded in peak periods, but no rush as a train comes approx. every 4 minutes. If go in the worong direct, just get off an next stop and walk across platform (30 meters) and jump on correct train going in the right direction. All lines colour coded and very easy to master."
,,The best!,5.0,,Use it to go everywhere! Shopping malls at every station. Abundant Aircon! I wish I lived here. Never need to drive. Buy the MRT card and get the SMRT app; it’s developed for the Sing MRT. Other apps are okay.

,,Very efficient and clean,5.0,,"Their trains are so efficient, even if it was rush hour, it didn't feel like a sardine can. I didn't smell any weird odors either, it was very clean. It was easy to understand the routes and the best way to get around the city"
,,Wish every city was like this,5.0,,Very easy to use. Very cheap way to get around. And yes very clean. The locals probably don’t know how lucky they are....
,,No words to describe,5.0,,"The best way to express is to experience it yourself. The metro stations, maps, ticketing counters, platforms & the metros/ buses - you can’t find a flaw. The app- ‘go there’- further aids in search and short listing. Hats off!!"
,,Easy way to travel,5.0,,"So easy and efficient - the trains run constantly every 5 mins, they are so clean too. Easy ticketing at a couple of S$ a trip. Google maps a great help in working out where to go and what Line to get. Unless you are...More"

,,Excellent way to get around!,5.0,,"Coming from Australia (our trains are horrid to get around on), this was an easy and cheap way to get around Singapore. They offer a $20 tourist travel card at the airport, best way to avoid lines and topping up a Metro card."
,,Why would you travel any other way?,5.0,,"The MRT is incredibly efficient, fast and cheap! Go anywhere in Singapore without queueing or waiting longer than ~2 mins for the next train to arrive. It's clean, feels safe, is quick and easy. Highly recommend."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Very efficient way to travel in the city. System of single tickets is relatively simple and there no queues at the machines.
,,Easy to use and cheap,5.0,,Explore the city with a tourist pass on the MRT. Easy to use and inexpensive. Covers a huge area. Also includes airport transfers. Highly recommended.
,,An efficient system,5.0,,"Well run efficient, easy to use underground train system. The underground stations (well the ones we visited) have full height platform barrier walls with openings where the train doors open and shut, thus stopping anyone from failing onto tracks."
,,Accessible and comfortable Ride!,5.0,,"The Singapore mass rapid transport system connects to most parts of Singapore and is definitely the fastest and cheapest way of reaching your destination.

Even if it does not bring you directly to your destination, you can still connect via a bus to your destination.

Very cheap and accessible, a transport that is indispensable whether you are a tourist, local that is travelling around Singapore for business or leisure."
,,Convenient and super easy to use,5.0,,"Make sure you use public transport, it’s easy to use, visitor friendly, super clean, cheap and as with all things in Singapore ridiculously efficient!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,We recently used MRT for traveling everywhere in Singapore on our 3 day visit. We purchased the Singapore tourist pass for 3 days at $20. This was really convenient for us. Single ticket is also possible for one time use. But make sure you have exact denomination of notes/coins to put in the machine.
,,Clean mrt,5.0,,"With the good directions not make us confution. Very clean, friendly for oldman, pregnant and disabilities."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,The MRT was very easy to use in Singapore. Very clean and efficient. We used it to get us to the Sentosa Express.
,,Very Good Transport System,4.0,,"Use it. Cheap - clean - efficient - airconditioned - extensive connectivity. A modern first class transport syste,"
,,Best Metro,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT would be the best metro system in the world that I have travelled so far. Efficient, regular, clean and cheap it allows commuters easy access to everywhere. The driverless train schedule are frequent, I never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a train and the connections are easy with colour coded lines. MRT offer competitive day/2 days passes which enables anyone to travel seamlessly and with ease."
,,The best way to get around,4.0,,"The mrt in Singapore is fantastic! So easy, quick. The only downside is lots of walking and getting around with a pram/wheelchair can be limiting. Definitely catered for but you feel penalised. Love using the mrt with my parents and toddler needing a pram. On the mrt itself there are lots of seats unless in peak hour. Sometimes the bus is better as there is less walking involved. Often they can drop you right in front of your hotel or destination. You can see a lot more too."
,,Great system!,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, affordable, easy to understand. As long as you avoid commute times, best way to get around town."
,,MRT in Singapore,5.0,,"It's a great way to get around Singapore quickly. You need to study the route before you travel and then when using the MRT it will be easier. It is colour coded, so you can follow the North/South line, Circle Line, etc. Peak hour travel 8-9 am and 5-7 pm is to be avoided as carriages are crowded.

However, If travelling in a group, it may be cheaper/easier to catch a taxi as they are relatively cheap in Singapore. Under $10 gets you to most places within the CBD and local attractions."
,,"Cheap, efficient and quick",5.0,,"A great way to get around the city. Some stations have you walking a long way underground, so it pays to look at the maps which show where the station is actually located!"
,,Quick and easy,5.0,,"We really found it convenient, quick, easy and very affordable. We could even get the deposit for our cards back, not sure this is true in many counties."
,,Very riliable,4.0,,"Very nice and reliable, and the cost is also very fine, you can connect to the whole Singapore very easily and fast"
,,"Like the Underground but cleaner, brighter and cheaper!",5.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore. Cheap, clean and fast. Even in peak times seems less crowded than other transit systems. The advantages of being a new system show."
,,Best in the world,5.0,,"Travel around Singapore, all the main suburbs and sights or to and from the airport is so easy and affordable with the SMRT. We purchased a visitor pass when we arrived at the airport, but not being familiar with the SMRT system we were a bit nervous and elected to catch a taxi from the airport to our accommodation. After spending a week in Singapore and extensively and exclusively using the buses and SMRT we wish on hindsight we had used these first up to get us from the airport to Holland Village where we were staying. Much cheaper than a taxi! We certainly used the SMRT again when we left to get to the airport. Revommend you you just buy a day pass or three day pass rather than the visitors pass, because it works out cheaper because you get a refund when you return your card, which you don't with the visitors card. It is so easy to follow the directions both at the train and bus stations and also on the bus and trains. We would strongly recommend you first download the ""gothere.sg"" app to your mobile phone as soon as you arrive at Singapore Airport as this will assist you even more. Simply insert your current location and the address of where you want to go and the app comes up with a range of transport choices that include bus, train, car and taxi, including the time and fare estimates and the bus numbers and train stations to board and alight from. The SMRT has about three main lines. The North-South (which includes getting you to and from the airport, the East-West and the Circle line. These all interconnect and it is extremely easy to transfer between lines. The trains are immaculate and are spacious. Inside each carriage there are a number of display boards that show exactly where the train is at the moment and which stop is next. There are also voice announcements at each station. The trains are fully automatic without drivers and it is quite an experience to stand at the front and view the train as it rushes along the tracks and through the tunnels. The transport is incredibly fast and frequent (every few minutes), so don't worry if you arrive at a station just in time to see your train departing, because there will be another one along in a few minutes. There is plenty of room if you have suitcases and all the stations are well equipped with lifts, escalators and stairs. The cost is typically less than a tenth of the cost by taxi.
This is the best transport system we have seen in our worldly travels. Congratulations Singapore."
,,Perfect way to get around,5.0,,"Reliable, frequent, clean service that took as all over to within walking distance of our chosen site."
,,This is one of teh best transport systems anywhere,5.0,,"Regular service, clean and so easy to use. Either grab a 1-, 2- or 3- day pass or simply get a EZ-card with some credit and go anywhere."
,,Right on time.,5.0,,The most reliable mass transport system that I have ever ridden. Trains were clean and spacious. I love the accuracy of time.
,,Superb,5.0,,"The MRT is a very clean, most efficient and easy to use method of getting around the entire island of Singapore."
,,Excellent way to get around,5.0,,"We used this alot, you can collect a card ( believe its called EZLink) from the airport which you can top up with cash to use on the SMRT and buses, though we only ever used this system...its easy to navigate and super clean and tidy (I don’t navigate well but I would be very happy to use the SMRT again) the card was such a handy thing to have."
,,Best way to get around Singapore!,5.0,,"So easy to get around with the MRT. Wish we had better public transportation in the US like this. You can pretty much go anywhere in Singapore with the MRT. Easy to follow and find your destination. Once you get the hang of it, you'll know exactly which lines to use to go to certain places. I highly recommend getting the Singapore Tourist Pass for a 1, 2 or 3 day unlimited rides. It's worth it!"
,,Great travelling experience,5.0,,"Extremely comfortable, efficient and fast to move around in the city. Air conditioned and spanking new coaches. Great travelling experience!"
,,Clean clean MRT,5.0,,"The MRT was an increadibly unique experience. Every train was so clean that they seemed completely new. We never waited for longer than 4 mins per train and it was a quick commute. It was a great way to stay out of the heat. Travelers beware, if your balance gets below $3.00 you will have to top up a minimum of $10.00. The plus side of this is that you can spend your money at 7/11 or other convenience stores."
,,efficient,5.0,,"so easy to use, very clean. No need to catch a Taxi in Singapore, just be aware that the ticket machines don't take credit card, or take notes higher than S $10-00."
,,Modern and clean MRT,5.0,,"Caught the MRT a few times. Great, Quick and clean- use a card to tap on and tap off like Sydney's Opal card. So clean...."
,,Excellent way to see Singapore,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day pass for 30 Singapore dollars and you get a refund of 10 when you return it. An excellent way to get round singapore, very clean, easy to follow and regular trains. Easy to get MRT from airport to city no need for expensive transfers. I would recommend you travel far and get away from the tourists. For example punggol and go to cony island, Changi village and get boat to Paula Ubin. You can also use your pass on buses. I assure you, it is easy you will not get lost in Singapore. If you are cruising there is an MRT 10 minutes from port. Good luck."
,,"Its a train, it's a tram...no it's amazing",5.0,,"There's 18,000 reviews to discuss Singapore's train system and 80% love it and i don't believe the rest. It has plenty to love but the overwhelming feeling is ""why can't we have this?"" So apart from value, efficiency , cleanliness , safety and reliability here's what i like. I like to watch the people going about their business with energy but yet politeness. They are hot and busy too but are friendly. They smile and are helpful. The kids give up seats to older people and tourists and nobody pushes. The stations match the trains and are everywhere. I've been here 20 times and it was amazing in the 80's. It's only got better ..."
,,Convenient,4.0,,"It's quite easy and convenient to take the MRT as the main traffic tool when traveling in Singapore, especially the price cost not expensive."
,,SMRT.,5.0,,"This has to be the most advanced railway system anywhere in the world, with driverless trains always on time and very safe.The fares are also very inexpensive, we used an ez link card to pay for the journeys taken.Also there is no possibility of getting on to the rail tracks with the platforms having closed doors which only open with the train doors, everyone boards and exits the train in an orderly manner."
,,model rapid transportation,4.0,,"if only my home country can adopt what SG has for public transport, life would be much better. they say if a nation has an efficient transport system, it will reflect how developed its economy is. SG is definitely up there, along with the EU countries with the metro and subway trains.

you won’t get lost as long as you focus on where you’re going. it’s easy, fast, cheap and most convenient."
,,"Super convenient, cheap and easy",5.0,,"Do travel by MRT. Buy EZ Link card and yiiu are on roll. You can use it for bus as well as MRT. Singapore is so well connected by MRT , that you does not really need a taxi. Directions are absolutely clear, help is available at all stations and you can virtually travel in 20 dollars for whole week"
,,with smrt u can save sume bucks,5.0,,its systematic on time and takes u to all corners of singapore onlhe zorong bird park i had to take the cab as the station was too far
,,"So convenient, so easy",5.0,,"We were advised to buy a Tourist pass for our MRT travels. We paid $26 each, which gave 2 full days of unlimited travel on the entire system. We only used the trains, but it covers buses too. Once you have worked out which direction your train is going it is easy to follow the system and get about . . . and the trains are air-conditioned which is a blessing. Just be prepared for some long walks if changing lines etc. And sometimes getting out of the station is a bit confusing for beginners - read up on where you are going, they will usually indicate which exit you should take from the station ;-)
At the end of the 2nd day, we returned the cards for a $10 refund each - Nice!"
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"Without doubt, THE cleanest and safest underground I have ever been on.

The stations are bright and clean, even in rush hour they are manageable with ease.

The rules are simple: stand to the side and let those disembarking off down the middle, then get on! Simple and it works...

Easy to understand and even late at night there was no underlying atmosphere. Just brilliant.

London, NewYork - take note."
,,"Simple, straightforward and economical",5.0,,"Singapore MRT is really easy to use, and for a tourist it will get you to most places you need to get to. It is also not as expansive as London or Melbourne trains. You can download the app which has all the stations and transfer stations. There is no timing for train but it's frequent - 2-3 mins interval. Lots helpful staff too. It's safe, you can use it at night even for solo female travellers. I'm from SG so I know :)"
,,Best mass transit in SE Asia,5.0,,"The MET Singapore is hands down the best mass transit system in SE ASIA. If you are a frequent traveler their like I am, get the 7-11 transit option. You can't sell it or get a refund, also excellent for cross town e-money purchases. I load with 100.00 and never worry when in need of transit. Pack of smokes or a beverage. Card valid for 5 years. Also usable on all forms of public transportation. Not sure about taxis and grab / uber through"
,,"A safe, cheap and very efficient way of travelling in Singapore",5.0,,"The MRT stations are easily accessible, well sign posted for visitors and it is easy to purchase tickets for your trip.

,,Super efficient and Clean,5.0,,"Singapore Metro is easy to use, well marked routes, ticket vending machines are self-explanatory, and once you buy a ticket, the same ticket can be ""topped off"" for future rides, There's a 10c incentive to reuse the same ticket.
Stations and trains are very clean and well maintained."
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,Got the 3 day Tourist Pass- great way to get around Singapore- very easy to navigate your way around. Travelers very courteous- often offered a seat when it was busy.
,,trip singapore with train pass and hop on hop off,5.0,,"Have used SMRT while touring Singapore. I have covered most tourist attractions by choosing one day (24 hours) hop on hop off city tour pass bought for SGD 24 and train pass bought for SGD 12. The SMRT is fast and economic way to reach various attraction points by choosing the nearest stations. The train service is very frequent and at most stations the bus stations are near by. Being Singapore, have no doubt about cleanliness and time maintenance. The best part of using train pass used in SMRT is the balance can be collected back before you leave Singapore."
,,Train always break down,1.0,,"Peak hour traffic is horrible, even the normal hours is still packed. Worst rail transport I've taken. It breaks down very often compared to third world countries they have better rail system than this!"
,,Singapore's MRT was just Brilliant!!,5.0,,"Our experience of the Singapore MRT was fantastic. It was simple to use, simple to understand, no hold ups, no breakdowns, on time and oh so cheap. Their verbal notifications of upcoming stations was complimented with the carriage wall LEDs so if you didn't understand the language or hear the message, you simply had to look at the lights to know exactly where you were.
It also connected seamlessly with their bus routes and terminals."
,,Night time the train very slow,1.0,,I am regularly take mrt. I was disappointed last three days at night bcz the train very slow and took 33minutes to reach boon lay from outram park but in route maps they show 23minutes.

,,Simply the best in the world,5.0,,"I have been traveled to most of the European metro transits and some of the Asian ones but yet to see an efficient one like that in Singapore.SMRT stands apart with their super clean trains & stations, friendly staffs, helpful signboards and well-organized timings.Take a map from any station and roam easy..5 stars"
,,Clean,5.0,,Clean. Efficient . High connectivity . Easy navigation . Reliable . Detailed . Safe . Civilised crowd
,,Service always breakdown,1.0,,"Cleanliness yes. First class country but the trains is always breakdown. Please learn from Japan, Hk, China. And they do not take customer feedback seriously. Take Grab better."
,,MRT = Efficiency Plus,5.0,,Singapore's MRT is very clean efficient and impressive it covers the bulk of the island and light rail is used to fill in any gaps. as most travellers would expect Orchard Rd is expensive and caters primarily for tourists. Catch a train and explore Singapore while heading out to the Plazas that the locals go to. You'll get bargins and see more of the island.
,,"clean, efficient",5.0,,"the nearest stop was by the hotel, which made getting around easy peasy.. well designed as its easy to figure out where to go.."
,,simply great,5.0,,"we used the SMRT - all the time we there, we found it cheap, reliable & clean, we found that everyone was helpful & the staff were always curtis.
We did not purchase the TOURIST TICKET - we purchased that the locals buy, it was cheaper & does not expire in a couple of days, we found it the most economical way to travel around Singapore."
,,Very easy to get around,4.0,,"We suggest you get an "" ez card"" can add money onto the card very easily. Cheap trips. And when you are leaving Singapore they will credit any money on the card back to your account. We have had no trouble getting around.. very easy and very efficient."

,,Best way to explore and commute in Singapore,5.0,,"We used SMRT during our 1 week stay in Singapore. It was convenient, inexpensive and easy to use. Being punctual it was extremely reliable. The trains and buses are very clean. Some buses (newer double decker buses) even have USB chargers for smart phones and tablets.

We used the tourist pass which were reasonably priced and are the best option for tourists."
,,So clean,5.0,,Very very easy to use and highly efficient. Didn't experience anywhere near the hectic crowding of the London metro during our weeks travel. Travelling with a buggy was also no issue. The lifts are at every station so no stair lifting. The ticket machines are very easy to use but you do need relatively small change as they only give up to 4 dollars change back. Otherwise you may be best buying a 3 day ticket which is very much worth the vue for even minimal travel from day to day.
,,Comfortable Transportation,5.0,,"Comfortable transportation which covered the whole area of Singapore.They have an educative character such as ‘Stand up Stacey, Give way Glenda, Move in Martin, etc’."
,,The best metro in the world?,5.0,,"Our first three days in Singapore saw us taking taxis everywhere, which is also cheap transport v UK rates, when most other things in Singapore are far more costly! However, once we discovered MRT, we couldn't believe the cleanliness, beautiful stations and sheer efficiency of the system and it is such excellent value for money. The average far was S$1.30 which is less than £1."
,,An excellent way to travel round Singapore,5.0,,"We travelled all over Singapore using the MRT system.

It is spotlessly clean and incredibly safe. People are well mannered and we were surprised and pleased to find youngsters immediately getting up to give us their seats.

There is no eating or drinking on the trains which makes them so much cleaner than our Underground trains in London. We should take a tip from Singapore.

The signage is clear and whilst on the train you can watch a map which lights up as the train reaches each station.

People are very helpful and polite and we had no problems finding our way around.

We went from one end of the train system to the others and it was fast and comfortable."
,,Easy for a Tourist go get around Singapore,5.0,,"Love this subway. If you are a tourist make sure you get the tourist pass. They have them for 1, 2 or 3 days. We got the 3 day pass. Sure made it easy to get around Singapore, everywhere from the Central Business District, China Town, Little India, Clark's quay, the Marina Bay, etc.

Clean, fast, easy to use.

Two Thumbs up!"

,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,"Tourist to Singapore who are planning to explore the City by their own & have no pre arrangement should in first place MUST purchase SINGAPORE TOURIST PASS. This Pass allows passengers to use unlimited rides on MRT, LRT & Buses. These pass are available for 1, 2 & 3 days, can be extended further. Would suggest to purchase it at Airport.

Do not think much how to travel, change stations in between etc instead head up to information desk & ask for travel guide to your destination. They will happily provide which has all info how to reach to your destination (refer to the pictures attached for reference).

Public transport are well maintained & clean services are quite frequent takes to your destinations just like that."
,,SMRT Good service,5.0,,"The fare is reasonable cheap. The aircon is strong. The MRT is clean and on time. People are polite and follow rules, no pushing at all."
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"travel in a budget? take public transport. In Singapore, they have done it right, maybe still second compared to Japan :p
The trains are very clean, but please don't sit on the floor, it's blocking others. During peak hours, the train can be very crowded.
If you have friends in Singapore, try to borrow an EZ link card from them. It will be cheaper than buying single trip tickets. Or you can try the tourist EZ link card (The Singapore Tourist Pass) that's valid for a certain number of days. There will be a deposit for the card but you can get it back when you return the card.

You will also need the right transport planning tool because it can get confusing with all the connections and bus routes. Try an app called Moovit"
,,Mr,1.0,,Bad during peak hrs fm 8-9am & 6-7pm- crowded and commuters pretty selfish not moving inwards above all things which is also noisy and stuffy; practically smelling people BO during these hours
,,"Cheap, fast and easy to navigate",5.0,,Definitely the best way to get around - we did not wait longer than 4 minutes and signposting was clear and easy to follow.
,,Easy to Navigate,5.0,,The SMRT is easy to navigate and has an extensive system throughout the city. Also the staff is very friendly and accommodating in offering assistance!
,,Super clean & easy,5.0,,Best way we found to whizz around Singapore & be happy happy as you step onto the platform! Get one of the pocket maps to refer to & consider the tourist pass to save having to add single trips onto your metro card. So clean & easy to use. Some really helpful & friendly staff abound.
,,Best public transport,4.0,,"Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is Singapore best transport to move around Singapore, fast, clean, most convenient, with AC and with rebate as well if you take the buses together. I love SG MRT."
,,Best way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore mrt is the Best Mode to Travel there
It is simply wonderful and the connectivity is great
Changing routes and lines is simple child’s play
It is super convenient if yo I have aged people or small infants in a stroller
It is made taht the ultra rich also can travel it’s that comfortable
It offers wifi as well
Travelling by the mrt is safe and economic too"
,,Travel,5.0,,The mrt is clean and efficient. Buying tickets is easy. Many labels at the station to inform about landscapes. Love the smooth ride.
,,Visting Places of Interest and Travelling in Singapore,5.0,,It is the cheapest and faster way to travel and visit all the places of interest in Singapore. it also allows to mingle and see the people of many races and religion while taking the MRT train.
,,"Clean, On time and Efficient",5.0,,"Very extensive subway system covering all areas of Singapore in a very efficient manner. Easy to navigate, spotlessly clean and totally safe method of transiting to all areas of the city. My only criticism is the lack of staff available if you do need some guidance."
,,"Clean, less breakdowns will be good",3.0,,The transport is really convenient and not confusing. Probably day passes for travellers could be made available at ticket offices or ticketing machines.
,,Excellent way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"This is such a great way to get around Singapore. I purchased a 3 day tourist pass for $30 which I used all the time. It is all aiirconditioned,clean and always on time the trains are mostly standing room but the Singapore people are so friendly. They get up and offer their seat (I am an older person). I purchased an extra day for $20and the day I left I handed the card back and received a refund of $20. Win all round"
,,"Have MRT, Will Trave!",5.0,,"This is one the best & easiest way to travel around Singapore in a DAY on the go! Just breeze through in & out with the various colour lines - Red (North South Line), Green (East West Line), Purple (North East Line), Blue (Downtown Line), & Yellow (Circle Line). Its inter-connected with all the major bus-stations & taxis stands. Step out in any stations to recky. You can't go wrong. You would have see the whole of Singapore.

Enjoy!!! Have MRT, Will Travel!!!"
,,Stressful,1.0,,I would give zero stars if I could. A spat of delayed rides due to 'technical difficulties'. Very rude commuters who will jostle for the few seats on the trains. Most unpleasant way to get around.
,,"Clean, efficient and family friendly",5.0,,"Travellers can rely on the MRT for getting about in Singapore. We used it day and night with children and it was easy to navigate and get around to see most touristy sights.
Make sure you purchase the travel cards for all - even children. we were initially advised at the airport to buy child passes separately but as our stay was more than three days it cost us much more.
It’s is safe, clean and very efficient. Australians will come home wondering why our own PT system can’t be the same."
,,Smooth ride,5.0,,"We have used the service on a number of occasions and have been very happy with the experience.
Cleanliness, punctuality, frequency are the hallmarks. The number of connections and the interchangeability between the services also was extremely convenient for us.
I would certainly recommend to all travellers"
,,Easiest mode of public transport,4.0,,"Fast ,convenient and clean. Easily accessible to many places of attraction in Singapore . Try to avoid peak hour to avoid scary crowds of people travelling to work or back home!"
,,Train journey,4.0,,I have been taking MRT since donkey years ago. Nowadays I take bought the EWL (as usual very crowded) and the DTL. There are very few delays and waiting time has been reduced.
,,Commuting Made Easy,5.0,,Visiting the various hotspots in Singapore are made easy as the train systems are well connected with the bus systems. There are some attractions within walking distances from the train stations and some with connecting bus services after alighting from the train.
,,best travel system in world,5.0,,"I just love the SMRT , as you will get it on every where in Singapure and its works most of busy hours."
,,"Easy, efficient and great value",5.0,,"The SMRT is cheap, easy to use, the trains are very regular, even at off-peak periods, and the stations are well sign posted making it easy to find your way around. Moving between trains and buses is seamless and this makes it possible to get most places in Singapore that a tourist would want to go without any significant challenge."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"Forget taxis, the MRT is so easy and cheap it will get you just about anywhere a tourist will need to get to. Well done Singapore."
,,"Well run, expected",4.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is easy to get around to different places. The Security /Police was kind and helpful. During Peak hours, they could run more trains, we were pushed aside by several workers who were in a hurry to get home. Singapore is our favorite city, quite modern, and very clean.Equally well kept and maintained are the MRT Trains, and the Stations."
,,If only all were like this ....,4.0,,"Singapore’s MRT is great. It is clean, it runs on time, it’s affordable and generally it is easy to operate.

If you are going to be using it a lot during your stay check out the alternative ways to getting a ticket as buying a daily ticket gets old very fast.

As with all metro type services remember to factor in a longer time to travel than you might otherwise think as you can easily find yourself crossing lines and that adds to the journey. Dhoby Ghaut seems to have all the lines cross over here and this is one BIG station. Getting off one train and finding the other train takes a bit of time but all in all the MRT is great."
,,Excellent public transport,5.0,,"Singapores PT system is world best. It's really affordable and gets yoy pretty much everywhere. The trains run every couple of minutes and buses are pretty regular, too. So you never have to wait long even if you are traveling late. It's safe and clean. Would certainly recommend to anyone travelling in Singapore to travel on PT and buy an EZY link card."
,,Timely and easy to use,5.0,,"The SMRT is super easy to use. Buy an EZ-link card and top up with credit, then tap on and off at the stations as you pass the gates. The trips are relatively cheap, often <$1 and I used it as the main form of transport during my 9 day holiday in Singapore. The trip from the airport to hotel was like S$2.50pp.

The lines are colour-coded and changing lines was a breeze. The trains are also very frequent and timely"
,,Clean enviroment and cabin.,4.0,,"Usually stable in operation, except recent replacing of signal system caused some disruption to commuter who work late and unable to use this service."
,,Local grumbles are not well founded,5.0,,"Singaporeans like to cherry pick those instances during peak/rush hours when there are slight malfunctions and delays, but for most expats/tourists in Singapore accustomed to their own crumbling and ancient systems and infrastructure back home, it's hard to know what all the fuss is about. Overall, it's a clean, affordable and functional system. One complaint, which isn't really a complaint, might be that riding the rails in Singapore is a rather dull and lifeless experience: there is very little in the way of art in or along the station platforms and the capitalist brokers force you to walk through a lot of shopping areas to actually get to the trains... you'll also find no buskers, nor that many people (if any) having a conversation, but you will see plenty of cartoonish renditions of characters like ""Bag Down Benny"" and other admonitions of how one should act and behave on the trains. So plug in like the locals, keep your head down and enjoy the mostly very smooth ride. Oh, yes, it pretty much goes everywhere you would want to on the Red Dot and connects up very well with the bus system, which is even better!!"
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,1.0,,"Condition of trains ill-maintained, lots of delays, slow train intervals leading to overcrowding on platforms and in trains. Overall not a pleasant ride especially during peak hours. Heard some of the trains are more than 30 years old and not yet replaced."
,,Singapore's SMRT System,3.0,,Generally reliable and well connected to most parts of the island. However the system is overcrowded during morning and evening rush hours. This is typical of urban centres.
,,"EZ Link, easy to use, clean",5.0,,"We always use SMRT when we visit Singapore. It's fast and tourist friendly. We use EZ Link, so we don't need to buy the ticket everytime we use SMRT. The train is always clean, since eating and drinking are not allowed here."
,,Easy & Clean,5.0,,"We used the SMRT for the whole time we visited Singapore. We started with the tourist pass which is great value for money and then just topped that up (you also get the price of the tourist pass refunded when you return the card). Super easy to navigate the system, very good signage and clean and organised stations."
,,Train,4.0,,The MRT is a clean and efficient service. You can easily get a train from the airport to the city. You can buy a day pass from the MRT at the airport.
,,The best underground around!,5.0,,"This system is so easy to navigate, incredibly clean, efficient and safe. The 3-day tourist pass is good value if you want to see a lot in a short time"
,,Brian Arnold,5.0,,Such a great city with its rapid rail Quick service and can get to almost everywhere you wish.very reasonable prices clean and tidy as well.
,,What an amazing public transport system.,5.0,,"Reliable, inexpensive, and safe. This is by far the cleanest and most respected train system that I have travelled on. I cannot rate it high enough."
,,Local travel,3.0,,I take the train almost everyday. It is convenient but too crowd. If can avoid then avoid these timing 8-10am and 5-9pm
,,Easy and Convenient To Use,4.0,,The journey was pleasant and quick but a little crowded. One observation is that the reserved seats are occupied by able bodied passengers. Hope these people will have the courtesy to offer their seats to those deserved passengers when they come on board the train.
,,"Fast, efficient and clean",5.0,,"The frequency of the SMRT trains is really good and efficient. The stops are conveniently located and makes travelling all the more convenient. The system is easy to use and navigation in a piece of cake. The cost of travel is also low and very reasonably priced. EZ-Link cards can be used on the trains and also buses. Also, cleanliness in the train is usually spotlessly clean, and note you can't eat or drink on the trains."
,,MTR,5.0,,We caught MTRs for five days and it was a easy access to catch MTRS.It was a easy instruction to follow colours where we wanted to go .Ticket keep for five times to top up with more rides .It is easy to see suburbs light to show us where it is .
,,One of the best,5.0,,"It's sometimes a bit crowded but it's super realible transport system! You says that you need a car to go around SG, just take this one and you'll find yourself self in an amazing trip"
,,Efficient,5.0,,The MRT is extremely easy to use. If you are visiting it is worthwhile buying a two or three day pass. Three day pass is 20SD with a 10SD deposit. Fast and efficient
,,A cheaper way to get around Singapore,4.0,,Singapore is a small country and basically the cheapest way to get around Singapore with comfort etc. But avoid weekdays morning peak & evening peak hours. (7-9am) & (5.30-8pm). Do expect some breakdowns On & OFF ....
,,MRT,5.0,,"Clean, quick, convenient. There are also helpful staff at all stations. Can be crowded during morning and evening rush hour."
,,Role model for public transportation,4.0,,Well planned and best maintained public transportation system. It is far comfortable than traveling by personal vehicle.
,,Clean and efficient (but bring walking shoes),5.0,,"Singaporeans should generally be very proud about the mass-transit rail system that exists in the country and will only grow in the coming years as new stations are opened and new lines are brought into service. Although the system has experienced significant faults over the past few years, I believe these are growing pains that will be resolved in due course. I also believe that SMRT is better than most other systems around the world both in terms of cleanliness, speed, cost and comfort.

That said, some of the interconnections between train lines can be require quite a significant walk, which can be a bit troublesome if you're trying to avoid breaking into a sweat while away from the office or shepherding a family around the city. For women in high heels, I would certainly suggest they consider taking another mode of transportation (such as the public bus, taxi or Grab) if they're not keen to walk potentially a kilometre to transit between lines. Even if you're not transiting between lines, the walk from the above ground entrance to the actual train can be hundreds of meters.

Overall, I would highly recommend using the SMRT if your starting point and destination are close to a train line. As traffic continues to be a problem in many parts of Singapore, the SMRT is usually the most efficient way to reach a destination despite the potential rush hour crowds."
,,Experience over SMRT service in Singapore,5.0,,It is a user-friendly network system which I can get to my place easily even as my first ride over it. It provides a clean and silent condition which pleased every passenger.
,,Train spotting,5.0,,This is one of the most clean and impressive train systems I've been on. It is easy to use and so cheap - a pleasure to use.
,,Easy to use,4.0,,I take SMRT to work every single day. It is very convenient and very clear indications. Good Work. Highly recommended.
,,it's okay,3.0,,"just pray for no breakdown because it can get really frustrating with the huge crowd especially during peak hours. otherwise, it is okay."
,,Reliable but no so efficient,3.0,,"Its more than 30 yrs. Singapore MRT has been started and I'm experiencing it for last 10 years. From a global outlook, Singapore is always known for creating new standard in excellence and service delivery. However, in recent past MRT system is not effeciently performing the way expect it to perform. Delay due to frequent congestion and signalling issues made the MRT system inefficient during peak hours."
,,Great way to get around Singapore on the cheap.,5.0,,78 cent ride from Sommerset to Bugis. Cheap at ten times the price. The MRT is easy to navigate and if you do get a little bamboozled the locals or officials are happy to help you.
,,It gets you around,3.0,,It is consider one of the best and value for money transport. It gets you around for sure and to most places and attractions.
,,Efficient,5.0,,"The SMRT is very easy to use, has convenient located stations and very reasonably priced. No problem making your way to your required destination."
,,Best MRT system I've ever used,5.0,,"It's quick, cheap, accessible, reliable, clean and air conditioned. What's not to like? The network continues to expand and cover more and more of island. Can't wait for it to arrive in Siglap where we live."
,,Giving up seats to those in need,3.0,,"MRT service and cleanliness etc were good but In a crowded MRT with my 18 mth old child on Sunday around noon, nobody seemed to be ready to give up the priority seats. I approached a young lady and asked politely, she said “no”, even when she saw me holding my child. The lady next to her was reluctant but finally stood up so that I could sit down. Both ladies seemed and sounded like foreigners. Nevertheless, giving up seats to those in need is universal courtesy and people should be more caring and understanding."
,,Unreliable mode of transport,1.0,,Always breakdown and the fee is forever raising. Avoid if possible. Peak hours it's super packed with people.
,,Transport system,5.0,,"Best transport system that i have seen across manynof Asia markets. Efficient, Safety and importantly well maintained MRT.."
,,Maintenance,5.0,,"It has been known of the need if maintenance every weekend. However, why are there no verification and details citing the completion of this matter? Surely it cannot be forever."
,,Best public transportation I have used,4.0,,Very good and reliable system Can get you anywhere you want to go and very affordable Can get busy at peek times I recommend the moovit app if you are new to Singapore
,,SMRT,2.0,,"Clean and comfortable subway. Conveiently located. However, the frequency of breakdowns need to improve."
,,Brilliant system,5.0,,"The tourist card is a great idea. Just be aware that it is not available at all stations at all hours. Only some ticket offices are open for the whole day.
The trains a spotlessly clean and very frequent. The stations are clean and safe. The system is very user friendly."
,,Great transportation in Singapore,5.0,,Singapore has in my view the best transportation system i have experience. Easy go use and the EZ-link cards can also be used at buses in Singapore. Much better and cheaper than taxi's.
,,Inexpensive and easy to use,5.0,,"It takes time to learn how to use the system, but once you do, it gets easy. We've used the MRT to travel to and from Changi airport. I definitely recommend."
,,"Quick, convenient and easy to navigate.",5.0,,"Quick, convenient and easy to navigate. We were in Singapore for 3 days and took full advantage of the SMRT System. Note - if you want the bus/train combo card, you need to go to certain stations to purchase the physical card itself."
,,Best public transport ever!,5.0,,"Never encountered such efficient, pristine and easy to use public transport. Everything is clearly marked but if you do need assistance, the staff are always on hand to help. Most of all its REALLY CLEAN :)"
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"One amongst the best Metro system in the World. Easy to navigate, efficient, clean and on time. NS and EW lines meet at City centre. Many sub lines connect Interior parts. Must try for fun as well as use to add to your Green Quotient"
,,Quick and on time,5.0,,The MRT in Singapore is highly efficient and works on time. Mostly the trains come every few minutes. The only problem is that they don’t run at late night.
,,Slow. Ventilation inside the train not good,3.0,,Mrt go in low speed. It tools almost 1 hour from north to south station. Ventilation system no good.
,,Too easy,5.0,,Simple to get anywhere if you can read a map. Don't get the tourist cards if you're going to be longer than a day or two - the standard EZ cards are cheaper overall.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Great , works . Loved it !! Once you get the hang on the route it is very easy to navigate. I was not to sure on the first day, but the staff at the MRT station will help you with the ticket and explain how everything works."
,,getting around sinapore,5.0,,"Taxis are fine but as in most busy city's traffic is a problem, so use the MRT . So easy to understand , cheap to use and gets you where you want to be. ."
,,Clean Fast and Reliable,5.0,,Used the three day pass and it was a super way to get around the city. Clean fast and reliable and very well sign posted. There is an APP that works well for you to plan your trips.
,,Easy and very useful,5.0,,"The SMRT is very simple to use and ultra clean; I never imagined that it could be possible! In addition, there are tickets for a period of 3 days at an exceptional price of SGD 20.00 (metro and bus)."
,,Easy to use and cheap,5.0,,The MRT is world class. There are many stations so that you are never far away from one. The stations are spotless with great amenities. The ticketing system is simple and very cost effective. All lines are colour coded and so easy to follow.
,,efficient and easy to use,5.0,,"Very easy to use. Only had to read the instruction once to be able to buy a single trip or top up the ez-link card from the machine.
Also very cheap. From Changi Airport to City Hall MRT only cost 1,69 SGD (if I'm not mistaken)."
,,Great way to travel around Singapoer,5.0,,"Get the tourist pass card, 30 dollars for 3 days and 10 back when you return it. Great system, is on several levels, very quick, underground is cool and some stations are like a mini city underground with shops, eating places etc."
,,World Class,5.0,,"First off topped up my smart card, so easy via teller machine (try the USA where only 2 machines per station, and machines broken or useless). Caught the downtown line (blue) and the terminals are new, clean and modern (again try Hollywood subway, new, dirty, and roof leaks when it rains). The train was spotless and also driverless which means softer starting and stopping, instead of the continual jerking on the East West ( green line). Looking out the front window was also interesting, all new and clean (again thinking of NY with tracks strewn with garbage - talk of developing a train to clean the tracks but no mention of not getting the grubs to not throw rubbish in the first place -weird). Of course Singaporeans with self pride and authorities with clear expectations and the will to exercise makes for a very stress free public transport system. Quite a large system now since my last visit."
,,Easiest tracks to navigate.,5.0,,As compared to many countries with multiple big cities. Sg train maps are one of the easiest. Of course the city is small but it is well connected. All routes n exits etc are clearly marked. Although the trains can be slow and breakdown once in a while. I would still say it is so easy to read the map n get ard.
,,You would be silly not to use the MRT,5.0,,"The MRT is one of the best train systems you could ever use. It is safe, clean and very easy to use. The staff are great and the ticketing is easy. We used the card that we reloaded as needed- great decision. Help is easy to get from the support staff in the ticketing booths. In summary the best way to get around Singapore. And by the way it Airconditioning is always a nice touch"
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Love love love the MRT.
We had been to Singapore 3 years ago and first used the MRT. We were told then that the tickets were good for 5 years. So we took them with us on this trip and checked they were okay to use. They were and still had money on them.
The system is so easy to use. The trains are on time, clean & announce the next stop and have displays in the carriage that light up the next stop and where you’ve been so that you know you’re on the right one.
If going to Singapore or staying there this is definitely the way to get around. As I said the trains are clean, use to use and it’s a cheap way to get around. On this trip I think we spent a maximum of $5 over 3 or 4 days."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,We love the train system in Singapore. It connects you from one point to another without hqving a hard time. You just be guided on the exit signages for the places you want to visit.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"The only way to get around Singapore. Well priced, clean , never very busy ( even during rush hour) always regular trains . Best subway I have ever used , well done Singapore leading the way in the world with this for sure"
,,Very easy travel,5.0,,"If you need to get around Singapore quickly and without any fuss, it is very easy to use the MRT. If you need help their is always someone in the stations to help you out. Not expensive and very clean"
,,The Beloved MRT,5.0,,"Singapore encourages the public to use public transport rather than private vehicles. The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) or Singapore MRT (SMRT) is the principal mode of transport and shares that facility with the buses. The MRT trains are efficient, punctual and frequent. Because the system was built relatively recently it encounters very few shutdowns. The trains are very punctual. The coaches are modern, neat and clean.

The well-planned stations are automated. It is easy to find the trains to any destination from the touch-screen diagram and the map. Good signboards direct the passenger to the right platform. Even for an outsider, on a brief visit, like me, it is easy to navigate and reach the destination safely.

The system is not complete yet. More and more underground tunnels connecting underserved areas are being added.

Environment-conscious passenger gets a pleasant kick when seeing the ticket. It is reusable and gets a reward of a few cents on reusing."
,,The best,5.0,,"I really admire this transportation system. It is really reliable, and there's notification how long you should wait. The cart itself very clean and comfortable. The route reach across Singapore. The station itself very clean with clear directions."
,,Easy to use and very efficient,5.0,,"Can't be better... Autonomous, on time, efficient and easy to use. The information system in the stations is pretty good and easy to understand, on signs and on screens. The same you can see inside the trains. Of course, stations, trains, etc. are very clean. I enjoyed all rides there."
,,Has to be best in the world,5.0,,"Incredibly intuitive and east to use. Seemed daunting at first but once use to colour system and finding maps on station really easy. Stations are located close to all attractions. Purchase the 3 day tourist pass and it alleviates all ticket purchase concerns.
Best thing is the courtesy of passengers. We felt safe at all times in very clean graffiti free carriages. Elderly are almost always guaranteed seats.
If slightly disoriented you can always find attendants to guide.
Cannot recommend it highly enough. Oh and the air conditioning."
,,Easiest and cheapest way to commute in Singapore,5.0,,"Easiest and cheapest way to commute in Singapore. Do download their app which guides you as to which line to be taken, which direction, which interchange, etc."
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,"This would put every other city to shame. Well signed, easy to read maps on the walls everywhere, fast, efficient and extremely clean."
,,Sincerity,5.0,,"My colleague left his phone on the Bus 103 while alighting just one station ahead of Serangoon Interchange. When we realised he left his phone on the bus, we moved to the information/help desk. It was already there. They just asked us the number which we provided for them to call through their number and swiftly handed over to us. Kudos to them."
,,Clean. Efficient. Accessible. Brilliant.,5.0,,"Way more impressive and cleaner than that of New York’s subway. Definitely.

The first few trips were confusing but eventually we got a hang of it. It literally takes you to anywhere in the city. I love hay it’s clean!

We felt very safe, more safer than NY’s subway...way safer."
,,You must use the SMRT!,5.0,,"Even if you don't need to go anywhere, take a trip anyway, this is the most impressive rail system worldwide!"
,,Silly payment system,2.0,,"The trains work but for some reason you have to buy every ticket separately and can only use cash to pay for them. Plus only notes of $5 or smaller work. With a family of 5 this is absurdly awkward. Very dated payment system, which is a shame for such a modern transit network."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Very efficient system. Easy to follow too. Though I still had to ask a few locals which stops work best for the sites I wanted to get to. Easy on the pocket too
,,Oustanding service,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore makes getting around Singapore safely and promptly. All the stations are large and airy and there is always someone to assist you in case you can't figure out which train to get on, etc. The fares are reasonable. Don't spend money on expensive taxis, take the MRT!"
,,The Singapore MRT used to be a GREAT way to get to places in Singapore,3.0,,"15 Years ago the Singapore MRT System was the best! Over the last 10 years or so, attention to detail and maintenance has deteriorated significantly. It is still the best way to get to locations in Singapore, however the dependability of the system has dropped stranding commuters in long lines awaiting buses to make up for the train delays, The once smooth, comfortable ride has also deteriorated to where it is no better than any other train I have been on. The ride is now full of bouncing and rocking back and forth, rails out of alignment causing the train cars to jerk right and left instead of the train wheels rolling smoothly from station to station. The air conditioning used to be 100% dependable and now in various train cars the air conditioning is not operating or sometimes barely cool at all!"
,,"Clean, Cheap and fantastic frequency",5.0,,"Bought the pass and it was just a lovely experience. If you are staying in Singapore, do not waste your money in taxis just use MRT instead."
,,Easy to use with clear maps,4.0,,Very easy to get around. Clean and efficient. Friendly and helpful staff. Cheap to use buy a prepaid ticket then keep topping it up as you travel
,,Always on time,5.0,,I can not get over how well the MRT operates. Stations very very clean as are the trains. An easy way to get about when you get the ticketing down pat
,,Efficient!,5.0,,The system is easy to navigate with color-coded areas. The stations and subways were extremely clean and cool. An efficient way to travel the city.
,,Metro mirrors Singapore,4.0,,"The metro mirrors everything good about Singapore. It is clean, safe, easy to follow the lines and people are very helpful. There is also coverage for mobiles on the trains, which can be very useful. You can also get weekly tickets which offer huge discounts. You should definitely try the metro - it’s easy Peasy!!"
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,"Went to visit a friend in suburbs of Singapore via Grab and came back into city center through the MRT. Once found the station, it was pretty easy to navigate. Although aone of the automatic machines were not working so it didn't take my cc nor cash. Once gotten to a machine that works, everything is in English & you just tap the destination & it calcultes your rate. Make sure to check the map in case you need transfer. Hop onto the correct platform & get to your destination."
,,Fast and good.,4.0,,The most effective way to move but is not so clean. Don't take touristic pass if you want to move only two or lesser time's per day.
,,The best and cheapest way around town,5.0,,"Really easy to use and very cheap - I buy tickets as I need them rather than any tourist deals but it is simple to use, clean, fast and very cheap."
,,Superb connectivity!,5.0,,"Superb connectivity! Neat and clean and always on time! best option to get around in Singapore, cheaper than taxis and buses too!"
,,Brilliant way of getting around the city and beyond!,5.0,,"I used SMRT on the first day of our holiday as we had to get to Sun City Mall to collect our tickets for the hop on hop off bus! We were hoping to purchase the Tourist Pass Plus but found only certain places and stations sold them!!

We got a single tickets to our destination which cost about $1.70 each and then other half found if we added to the ticket x 6 times we got 10% off. It was sorry easy to add a journey to our ticket each time we went to use it that it worked out cheaper than buying a Tourist Pass Plus which only lasts for 3 consecutive days.

The MRT is so easy to use and trains run every 3 mins or so. Make sure you don't stand in front of the doors when waiting to alight the train but stand to the sides in the marked lines. We found other commuters to be very courteous as they would move seats so that other half and I could sit together. The trains are very clean and rules must be obeyed such as no smoking, eating, drinking or putting bags on chairs.

Excellent way to get around and really easy to use. Just make sure you have plenty of change for the ticket machine. Maximum notes they take are $5."
,,Incredibly efficient system,5.0,,"Both MRT and bus system are excellent. You can get around anywhere in the city. I ventured to many places with the transit card and got to experience the city. I never took a taxi. I even took the bus to the airport on my last day from the city center and had a glimpse at areas of SGP that visitors normally would not go to.... the neighborhoods, schools, etc."
,,Excellent mass transport system,5.0,,The train was perfectly on time. Very easy for even first timers to travel with ease. Loved the discipline of all the passengers.
,,Do not hesitate to use this transport,5.0,,"efficient, civilised and you could eat off the floor (almost). Some of the lines are elevated and give great views of the city."
,,You don't need a car in Singapore. Here's why.,5.0,,"The MRT system is inexpensive and easy to navigate. Tickets are good on both trains and buses. The system is sparkling clean. It has signs in four languages -- English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil. I never waited more than four minutes for a train. Don't hesitate to ask the transit workers for help. They are incredibly knowledgeable about the city. My pro tip: Be careful when you get on the Circle line to be sure you're not going in the wrong direction."
,,Easy to use,4.0,,"A bit sad i thought to write a review on a tube system, but actually its so good I decided to join other travellers in recognsiing how easy the system is to use. People are so friendly and helpful in Singapore. I gaurantee that if you struggle, someone will stop to help. Its cheap - really cheap, they re use their tickets to be ecologically savvy and like everywhere it is absolutely spotless . Free toilets everywhere"
,,Great transport MRT,5.0,,"We only spent 2 days in Singapore, but found the best and cheapest way to get around the city and see the sights is the MRT. We also caught the MRT to the airport when we left Singapore, if you don't know what train to catch ask at information desk."
,,Simply Efficient,5.0,,"Having travelled by public transport in lot of places, we must agree that Singapore MRT is the BEST. Clean trains, ample space, friendly & considerate crowd, and always on time. Very efficient staff who manage an excellent public transport system. Simply love it!"
,,The Best,5.0,,The extended network made it so easy to commute. I wish I could say the same for Bkk. I especially like the option to buy a round trip pass. Perfect.
,,Well networked and flawless!,5.0,,We didn't buy the pass as we felt the MRT tickets were quite cheap and we did use the Taxi a lot. But if you're planning to use the MRT a alot the pass is a good idea.
,,Good way to get about,4.0,,"We used the MRT and buses. Good network. Follow the train map to see the connections (also apps). Good way to travel to and from Changi Airport. Reliable, clean buses and trains. Some double-decker buses so get a view for sightseeing. Easy to top up credit on plastic card (remember to tap on and off). Very reasonably price transport system."
,,Not that good anymore!,4.0,,"I love singapore and this is my 8th visit the country. I first try the subway here all the way back to 2010, the train was super fast and smooth, awesome. I went for the subway again on my last visit to Singapore in Jun 2018, the train still fast, but the noise is terrible, I hear big noise last for at least some second, scary. It happen at every station , hope they maintain it well"
,,MRT,4.0,,Best way to travel in Singapore! Easy to interchange and get to main attractions. Very clean and safe!
,,FLA SG H1 19,4.0,,"It’s easy cheap and fast transportation. If you haven’t try before few things you have to know: when you use escalator make sure you are on the left side if you just want to stay there, the right side is for ones who want to walk through. Follow the color line according to your destination. Better buy a card or you can use paper card to pay for the transportation.
All the signs and direction are very easy to understand and to follow, even for one who hasn’t ride MRT before."
,,"If only , Sydney",5.0,,"The MRT system is super convenient and very easy to use for international travels. Everything is clearly marked and if you're unsure there's also someone around to ask.
Frequency and speed of the MRT is excellent Peak times 2-5 mins , off peak 5-7 mins.
Everything and everywhere is clean and tidy.
Only wished we had a transport system like this in Sydney."
,,Crowded during peak times,4.0,,Easy to understand and interchange between the different lines. Avoid travelling during peak hours for a more comfortable journey. Free travel early in the mornings.
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Needless to say..one of the best public transportation. Clean, organised, world class, can be a bit confusing for first timer.."
,,"Easy, On-Time, Affordable",5.0,,"The best way to navigate around Singapore is on foot. However, if you are weary of walking and the heat, the MRT system is a great option. Trains and busses are easy to find, maps and station information is available, and its very affordable. Don't take taxi's - use MRT."
,,Best in the world,5.0,,"SMRT is the best way to see Singapore by public transport. Trains on time. Clean trains, purchasing tickets even a child can do it, so simple but if not sure help is very close by. Trains air conditioned. You can see Singapore all by public transport, The only way to travel l say."
,,Very Efficient,5.0,,"We did not wait more than 5 min for any train. They could have been air conditioned, but every ride was 77 cents within the center of the city."
,,"Brilliant. Quick, clean, efficient and cheap. The best way to travel round Singapore.",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system must be one of the world's best metros. It's clean, comfortable, frequent and efficient. Fares seem quite cheap, even more so for a tourist if you purchase a Singapore Pass which provides unlimited travel for 1, 2 or 3 days. The MRT is definitely the best way to travel around Singapore."
,,The most optimun use of technology.,5.0,,Travel in cable cars and monorail was very comfortable. Waiting time is reasonable and the LEDs flash it all the time so that you know when to expect the next service.
,,So easy and cheap to take advantage of.,5.0,,"Very clean, efficient, easy to navigate with excellent directions / maps and with all announcements in English"
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,"In Singapore you can get the MRT from the airport, then use it during your visit to reach all the other places you wish to go. The maps are clear, precise and easy to use. I found it an advantage to have the cool of the air conditioner for the duration of my journeys .... it breaks up the times of dealing with the humidity that is Singapore"
,,attractive public transport system.,5.0,,Singapore MRT or Mass Rapid Transit is one one of the most efficient and reliable public transport system in the world. I really love to travel in that. Every time I visit Singapore I used to travel in that. To every nook and corner of Singapore we can travel in MRT. During peak ours it increases its frequency and it is great. Anyway it is a dependable system of transport in Singapore.
,,Cheap and Cheerful,5.0,,Efficient and clean. And relatively cheap too...each trip is only US$1.10 compared to eg London’s Underground $2.50 or the New York subway $2.30. Some of the new stations are also beautifully architected. Proud of our systems despite the occasional hiccups.
,,Fast and Convenient,5.0,,"Waiting time of around 2-3 mins, fast and convenient. Would recommend using the EZ Link card which will make MRT and bus ride more convenient. The signs are very easy to understand, most key shopping areas and places to visit in Singapore have a near MRT station to connect you."
,,Very good & very cheap,5.0,,"Great way to get around, various passes we just paid for a travel pass and topped up when needed, any access can be claimed back at the end of your stay. It was just like an oyster card at home paid so much for card and then the travel, last 5 years so give to someone else maybe."
,,"Safe, easy and inexpensive",5.0,,"Bought a three day tourist pass at the airport. It cost S$ 30 but S$10 is refundable when you return the ticket. Using this system is easy, the trains are frequent and spotlessly clean. Don't be put off using it from the airport on your first day, you do have to make a change but it is simply a short walk across a platform. Use this system, you will not fail to be impressed and will go home enviously wondering why your home city could not have something similar."
,,So efficient,5.0,,"Best way to get around, if your'e staying a few days get a EZway travel card. Clean as a whistle & everyone is civil. If you miss a train don't worry, here's another one.
Great signage to mean you get out the right exit for your visit first time"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Easy way to get around Singapore. Inexpensive and clean. Station personnel are friendly and helpful.
,,Best I have ever seen,5.0,,The MRT system is excellent and very safe. We used it every day and of course sometimes we also used taxi but the metro is faster if you are going someplace very close to a stop.
,,So easy. Takes you anywhere in Singapore.,5.0,,"This is definitely the way to travel in Singapore. We had many hours to fill after our cruise ship arrived early in Singapore and our flight was late at night.
We checked our bags into the early check in at the airport and headed to the MTR.
We caught the train to Chinatown where we did some souvenir shopping, then into Bugis Street and then back to the airport in plenty of time for our flight.
The service is very reliable."
,,Efficient!,5.0,,Extremely easy to work out. On time. Clear instructions. Clean. Very efficient way to travel. Impressed!
,,Very easy mode of transport,5.0,,"We recently visited Singapore and mostly used the MRT to get around. It’s very easy to navigate, extremely clean and very good value. You purchase a travel card for 5 Singapore dollars and then top it up as you go along. The average journey was costing us 1 dollar a trip. Easy way to see the city sights."
,,Best in the World,5.0,,"It’s what makes Singapore vibrant the MRT makes getting places easy, swift and cheap. The efficiency, cleanliness and modern trains are the very best there is."
,,Ease of Travel,5.0,,"Liberally use the MRT, but a day pass or week pass if you're planning to stay longer.... Its the best & fastest way to get around town... no waiting for Taxis etc, esp during peak hoyr or when it rains, when you have loooooong waits for a cab !"
,,Easy Peasy,5.0,,"Simple, clean, efficient, cheap. That about sums it up. The stations are well marked, well located and the lines are easy to follow."
,,Almost can go anywhere,5.0,,"Easy access, the routes are considered very very complete to all the tourist spot u can think of. Buy ezylink card for convenience and cheaper fare!"
,,Good but carefull,5.0,,"Very good high tech transportation system for getting around Singapore. Clear signs and in english everywhere. The trains have sings even showing what side the door opens. Few seats but I guess its built for carrying as many standing travellers as possible.
Be aware tha drinking even water of chewing gum will result in penality of 500 SG dollar. There are civilians controlling this so dont take any chances, not even outside the train inside the station itselg its allowed. This is a city with strict laws and rules.
And in case you buy a tourist pass, remember to give it back to office to get a refund of 10 dollar SG."
,,"Yes, easy",5.0,,"SMRT (trains and buses) are so easy. You get a magnetic ""contactless"" card, charge it up, and just tap when entering/boarding or exiting/deboarding the bus. It's cheap, you don't have to figure out how much it costs. Some of the contactless cards that are valid on the SMRT (e.g. the NETS card) are electronic purses that can also be used for purchases.

Get the free Citymapper app : it tells you about your connection options, how long it takes, and can pull up local maps. You do need data though."
,,Easy & Efficient but bring small $ notes,5.0,,"The MRT is very clean, safe and reliable and a recommended way of getting around Singapore to tourist areas quickly.

We had 2 days in Singapore so opted for the 'Standard Ticket' and just topped it up as required. It's advertised as ""used on MRT and LRT rides for both single and return trips. It can be used up to six times within 30 days from the date of purchase.The purchase price includes a deposit of 10 cents and this is automatically refunded on the travel fare of the third trip. A user also enjoys a 10-cent discount on the sixth trip.""

The trip from Changi airport to the city was $2.80/adult with one change to the city line - a good option to have a look around after flying in. Trips in the city area were $1.40 which were loaded before we traveled.

The only problem we had was the machine at the airport only accepted cash and only gave a maximum of $4 in change so using a $10 note wasn't a good option - so bring $5 notes if you can - especially as we landed around 5:30am and no MRT staff were available to help with change"
,,Very Impressive,5.0,,"Super trains, beautifully interlinked, even helpers on the platform to check you know where you are going. Excellent value with the 2 day tourist card. Absolutely model system, easy to use (and Air conditioned to boot)"
,,Safe and comfortable.,5.0,,"We had to catch the next flight to Melbourne on our return and an adjoining flight there to Malaysia, KL. too, so it was a blessing that we did not have to walk to the gates, or even travel on the travelator. This rapid transit is such a good idea because it saves time and energy."
,,Best way to Travel,5.0,,We used the SMRT several times - easy to access tickets & best way to get around Singapore. All of the Lines intermesh & the trains are clean & usually plenty of seating.
,,Eeeasy,5.0,,"This is the only way to get around. Easy, safe, cheap, lots of stops all over, clean, even the security guards are friendly and helpful towards lost tourists"
,,Mtr,5.0,,So easy to use.Every two minutes most impressed.Maps were very clear.Stayed near Dhouby Ghaut so central to every line
,,Nice but could be better,3.0,,"Some of the train carriages are excellent in terms of on board graphics and presentation. A bit of an overload of oral information whilst the trains are in motion. Sign posting outside the MRT stations could do with a more prominent display. Directional street signs say, 50 metres or so, pointing to the nearest MRT station would be helpful."
,,MRT,5.0,,"The best gift that singapore government has given to the city, MRT is well connected to the city and reaches every corner."
,,Very Efficient,5.0,,"Such a quick, easy and cheap way to get around Singapore whilst seeing the sights. On arrival to the station we were unsure of how to use the ticket machine, straight away a service guard helped us to purchase our tickets. The trains are so quick, clean and always on time."
,,Efficient and Easy to Use,4.0,,"Easy and quick way to travel around Singapore, especially with the new lines like Circle Line/ Downtown Line opened."
,,Excellent network,5.0,,We used the MRT extensively during our stay in Singapore and found it to be a very cheap and efficient way to travel.
,,Super efficient and easy to use,5.0,,"This is an efficient way to move around Singapore. We used three different lines while we were there. The signage is very easy to understand. There are a lot of escalators up and down connecting the platforms and lines. It was a little disorientating to pop up (like a rabbit) out of the system and to get our bearings, esp when I'm used to using the sun and sky for having an idea of the direction! On Orchard Road, between Somerset and Dhoby Ghout, even though it was a walk in the heat and humidity, I thought it was easier than winding our way down down down, then up up up at the other end. But that was only for one station distance. I'd definitely use the MRT for more than one stop away. The system is fast, clean and if you get the three day visitor pass, you can hop on hop off bus and train anywhere, anytime. I can tell you that we were also very impressed with the efficiency of the buses and the helpfulness of the drivers. All the information you need is at the bus stop and with a little googling, you will have an idea of which bus stop you need to go to, or just wing it and walk along looking at the maps they have displayed til you find the one you want!"
,,Easy way to travel,5.0,,"We had a six week holiday in Singapore, used the SMRT for all our journeys.The trains and buses are clean and the tickets are reasonably priced.You can buy a travel card and load it with the amount you think you will need for your stay, every time you swipe on and off a bus or train the swipe machine displays the amount of credit you have left.The trains run over most of the island, only the city area is underground, the buses travel just about every where, and both run very frequently.A big bonus for us Oldies is, the young people will give up their seat if you need it.Singapore SMRT is the best mass transport we have ever used."
,,Really easy,5.0,,"Easy to use and cheap we got a tourist pass for 3 days unlimited travel no mrt,lrt and bus so clean and cool and well laid out"
,,The best transit system ever,5.0,,The mrt is clean runs on time cheap to travel on and you would not want for a better service .The link from the airport to the rest of the city is so easy and quick .All trains have maps to show stops and verbal announcements and all stations have clear signage which is easy to follow .One tip I would give any traveller is go for the ez link card not the tourist pass as this offers much better value .
,,"Easy, safe (like everything in Singapore) and clean - Worth it !!",5.0,,"Got a 10-day MRT card along with a local SIM card arriving at Changi and used the MRT every time I could. AirCon, easy to navigate, safe, comfortable - what else could you ask for of a transit system. Took many buses as well as the actual trains. Get the Citymapper App and all you need to do is chose your trip and follow directions - literally !!"
,,MRT is the way to move in Singapore,5.0,,"Once you get yourself familiar with the MRT system in Singapore, its the easiest way to move in the town and most of the time faster than a cab.
The tricky thing though is taking the correct exit, but there are a handful of signs pointing the way for you.
MRT is also very cheap and trains have AC."
,,Affordable and easy!,5.0,,This is super efficient way of travelling almost anywhere in Singapore if you are prepared to walk a bit. Most importantly I found it much easier to travel then I had perceived. Its economical compared to Taxi. Recommended.
,,Tourist passes make this a great way to get around.,4.0,,"Get a three day tourist pass and away you go. This really is a simple, convenient way to get to most of Singapore's main attractions."
,,Very cost-effective way to get around Singapore.,4.0,,"I cannot believe how well-priced the tickets are. The only 'problem' with them being so cheap is, the ticket machine would only accept certain (low) denominations and because our 2 tickets were so cheap and I only had a $20 note, it wouldn't allow me to purchase as it would have given me more than $15 change. So, I had to buy 3 tickets at an astronomical cost of like $6 something all together - haha. Was very easy getting from Changi to our hotel and also back again the following day. Wonderful service."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,A great way to get around Singapore. The stations and trains are super clean and. There are people to help you navigate if the many signs confuse you.
,,Well Connected,4.0,,"Connected towards most part of the Singapore. Absolutely neat and clean. While travelling, one of the passengers spilled water bottle, at the very next station the cleaner came and cleared the spillage.
Would suggest that you make a travel card and while leaving the country, can deposit back in the automats and bet the security back"
,,Excellent With One Reservation,5.0,,"Three day tourist passes cost only $12 for this fantastic transport system! All the trains ran frequently and connected well, including taking in Changi Airport. ""Waits"" of over 3 minutes were unusual. The trains and stations were all super clean and felt absolutely safe.

HOWEVER my tourist pass (though not my companion's) failed to work when I got on a bus on day two. I told the bus driver that it was valid but just failing to scan but he wanted me to pay again! So we got off the bus and walked to the nearest MRT train station, which was about 5 minutes away. THEN we found that only selected MRT ticket offices handled tourist passes, so then had to walk for a further 20 minutes or so to a station that dealt with them. After a somewhat lengthy phone call by the clerk was made, I was given a replacement ticket. Singapore MRT, please take notice and rectify the problems with your system that this review highlights..."
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"I purchased 3 day pass from MRT station at the Changi airport.

Travelling in MRT is so easy and comfortable that I didn't spent even a single penny in taxis.

Simply go for MRT wthout any second thought in mind. Don't forget to return the card while leaving Singapore to get the deposit back. You can return the card in Airport itself or in any other MRT station.

Smart Mass Rapid Transit :)"
,,Fast way to get around,5.0,,The MRT system is well structured and easy to get around with. You once buy a card which you keep reloading depending on your trips. All machines take cash and cards.
,,What a great way to see Singapore in such a short time!,5.0,,"We purchased our three day Singapore tourist pass at Bugis station, the lady in the booth was very helpful and gave us great advice on how to top up at the vending machines at each station and where to return our card to receive our $10 refund at the end of our stay. The Tourist Pass gave us unlimited travel for 3 days on trains and buses. This was fantastic!
The MRT is easily one of the best ways to get around Singapore in three days. All trains are spotlessly clean, with good air conditioning and very punctual. Grab yourself a map of the stations and once you understand the lines (each has a different colour) it becomes easy.
One suggestion: Bugis Station only takes MasterCard so having cash simplified things."
,,Moving around Singapore,5.0,,"useing the MRT was safe, fast and enjoyable, was easy to read board to find what train we had to take, locals on train always asked if we wanted a seat if there were non available, Buses were a little more problematic, had to sway buses, but in saying that the drivers were alway helpfull with what bus we should catch"
,,Great Public Transport,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, convenient. Heard there have been breakdowns but few and far between. Get a system map from the information counter and plan your trip. It's a breeze. Need I say more!"
,,Amazing public transportation!,5.0,,"Singapore hands down has the easiest and efficient public transportation out of any city I have been to! For the MRT all you have to do is buy a MRT card at any one of the station, it’s an initial $7 SGD but you get $5 to start to ride, and then you can top up at any station whenever you need to add more money!

It’s a pay for distance type travel card so you tap in to enter the station (it will tell you how much is left on your card) and tap out at the stop you are exiting and it tells you how much the ride cost. The MRT card also works for all of the public buses with the same system tap on and off and cost is by distance. Every once in a while you may get free rides or reduced prices.

The MRT will bring you right near any possible location on the island that you could possibly want to get to, and they are constantly expanding and adding new lines! All of the trains are very clean as they have no food or drink rules on the trains.

The only sad thing about the MRT is that all lines stop running around midnight every night and then start back up around 5 or 6am. This is for maintenance, so I guess we can’t complain."
,,Smrt,5.0,,"Convenient if u stay on atleast one the route and ready to take a walk In case of change in route and with infants and kids below 5 yrs,mrt can be avoided.buy the ez link card only if you plan to use the mrt and bus extensively.i stayed for 6 days and to c maximum places and not waste time I preferred taxis.if at leisure then mrt and bus are definitely a good option as they are economical and convenient."
,,"Clean, efficient, frequent",5.0,,"It works great! We used it everyday for a week. People are always polite, ticket staff are helpful, the trains run at less than 5 minute intervals and are very clean. The MRT stations are also well scattered around Singapore so you can visit most places using it alone."
,,the best i've ever experienced,5.0,,What can I say? have you ever stressed over the railway transport before visiting a country? well worry not when you visit this top notch transportation system. Use in conjunction with the Citymapper app and you'll be a pro traveller on day one!!
,,well managed public transport,5.0,,"Very efficient and economical. single trip making traveling around Singapore very easy, efficient and economical"
,,Best public transport I have ever used,5.0,,"We really enjoyed using the MRT in Singapore. Very efficient and economical. You can jump onto a bus after a train trip or vice versa and the whole thing is regarded as a single trip making traveling around Singapore very easy, efficient and economical"
,,The best thing I love from Singapore!,5.0,,"I feel safe. I feel accompanied. I can't even say through words about how I really love SMRT. This is the best way to wander around Singapore. It is cheap, it is easy, and it's wonderful. their schedule is on time and organized and I even wasn't worried that I would get lost in my first arrival to Singapore. I LOVE SMRT!"
,,Best way to transit Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is easily one of the best way too get around Singapore. As a tourist I used the Tourist Pass which gave me unlimited travel for 3 days and then I could recharge the card. This is available at the main stations. Bugis station has a dedicated manned booth by the eastern line.

Once you understand the end destination numbers so you get on the right line and platform it is so easy. I ended up taking a group of 10 colleagues around the city on the MRT and they were all converted from using cabs to the MRT. Lots of information an all stations.

Suggest having cash as cards were problematic for small trip ticket purchases.

Electronic self serve booths in multiple languages."
,,good way to get around the city,5.0,,We bought a tourist ticket that gave us unlimited travel. Stations clearly marked and easy to connect to other lines
,,Height of convenience but has a risk,4.0,,"Very organized network covering the length and breadth of Singapore. Frequency of trains is very high and hence very less waiting time. MRT card makes it extra convenient. However, my mother got stuck in the automatic doors and it didn't open automatically (as it's mentioned in the videos played in the train). She had to be manually pushed inside the compartment. A point to be kept in mind if traveling with kids or elderly people"
,,Smooth and convenient,4.0,,"Going around the Lion City with SMRT is very convenient and hassle free. It has access to most tourist attractions and saves you on taking a cab, well if you're not in a hurry. It also provides you a tour of the cityscape."
,,Fantastic rail system,5.0,,My husband and I have just returned from Singapore and were absolutely amazed at the MRT in Singapore. If only we had something like this in Australia. Fast and spotless. We spent a lot of time riding the trains and had a ball. And very reasonably priced too. It was an eye-opener to see young women on the trains late at night in complete safety. You just wouldn't do that in Australia as it is quite unsafe.
,,Travel in comfort,5.0,,It was my virgin trip on downtown line since it was open on 27 December 2016. I boarded the train at the Promenade station and it only took about 20mins to reach Beauty World station. Totally comfortable.
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"We used the SMRT every day, purchase a card from the kiosk at the station and get hold of their map. You can get pretty much everywhere using a combination of the SMRT and buses."
,,"Efficient, fast and clean",5.0,,A absolute pleasure using the train system to travel around. A train arrives almost every 3 or 4 minutes. The BEST way to get around Singapore. Buy the tourist pass for hassle free travelling on all modes of travel.
,,"Cheap, effective and very clean, best way to get around",5.0,,"fantastic way to get around, as good as London's tube and far cleaner once you have worked out how to read the maps you can be off. If your in town more then two or three days or plan on coming back to Singapore get yourself a prepaid card rather than paper tickets you use six times as the trips cost just over half the price 0.77c for three stations. The basic card is $12 which includes $7.00 of travel and you need to top up in $10 increments but money lasts FIVE years so if you plan on returning soon take them home but remember to bring them back. The network is pretty extensive, not as good as London but above tickets also work on the bus and its easy to spot the MRT logo showing where bus stops and stations are. In the bigger stations with interchanges pay attention to where you want to come put on the surface, especially at night, Chinatown in particular caught us out before I figured things out but from then on was easy enough, just know what attraction you after, or street name its on and check signs inside station for directions to appropriate exit. The only issue you might find early on is staff to ask questions of, smaller stations unmanned but not an issue later which is why I guess they don't think they need many. Its not eat off the floor spotless but is very clean & modern with very frequent trains and never that crowded, at least for us in Late June."
,,Efficient Service,5.0,,Very efficient service at a reasonable price. We as tourists found it easy to follow and get around the island.
,,unbelievable,5.0,,"Last year i visited singapore with my girlfriend and organized our entire experience using the SMRT as our only mode of transport and boy were we pleasantly surprised at cleanliness, speed and beauty of the greatest subway system ive yet to experience, and i can't imagine anywhere being able to up the standard from singapore."
,,"Think the Tube, except perfect!",5.0,,"The best way to travel around Singapore. Fron the airport to Sentosa Island, this is the cheapest and most efficient way to travel. Genius! The dream version of London's Tube network."
,,Love it!,5.0,,"Very convenient,cheap & fast. Easy to use even for travellers like us. At few stations we used, there was a staff to assist us.
Taxi in Singapore is not expensive even with a extra charge from the airport but the peak time traffic is a pain, so we chose to use MRT and we are very happy!"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Tourist card is $10 per day for an adult with a $10 deposit per card. Makes life for stopovers very easy. MRT is simple to use, recommend downloading the app for trip planning."
,,brilliant and easy to use,5.0,,"we went everywhere on the MRT. Never been to Singapore before, but so easy to use and cheap. Everything is in English. Great for travellers"
,,Cheap and easy,5.0,,"The MRT is quick, easy to use, cheap and clean. Puts most other underground’s to shame. Cars are modern, large and spacious....just beware you cannot eat or drink in the stations or on the trains, that’s why It’s so clean and other major cities could learn from this!!!! If your here for a few days rather than the tourist card recommend an ez link card, $12 and you get $7 on your card, cheaper than the tourist card if your here for a few days and easy to top up."
,,I only wish we had a train system like this,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is nothing short of amazing.Cheap, clean and on time.If you miss a train there is another in around 2 minutes.The stations are very well signed and if that fails there is always some one you can ask.Some times the journey to get to the train once in the station can be a bit of a distance but there are escalators every where so it doesn't take too long.
Just a tip: if you are running out of credit and only have a short time left in SNG you can do a S$5 top up at 711 where as the machine at the station has a minimum of S$10
DO NOT DRINK OR EAT IN THE MRT STATIONS. FINE $500"
,,Impressed,4.0,,"Singapores MRT transport, is quick, efficient, clean and cheap. I was very impressed with facilities for the disabled, there are boarding points on all trains for wheelchair users and excellent use of Braille for the visually impaired. We made good use of the transport system during our stay in Singapore."
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"As a tourist this was a great way to get around, someone always on a platform to help, little maps with great directions, cheap and pretty easy, the cleanest trains and stations ever to be seen"
,,Great way to get around for tourists,5.0,,"Definitely a good thing in Singapore, a lot better and clean compared to the ones at home in Perth, Australia.
It can be a cheap way to get around depending on how many people you are with. If you only take one trip there and back a day go and buy the ez link card, not a unlimited tourist pass.
Very easy to work out where to go and always frequent travels."
,,to get to the places of attraction around singapore,3.0,,easily travel around Singapore and get to the places of interest and cheap way to travel around besides driving.
,,"Often crowded, sometimes delayed",3.0,,The train is very crowded at almost all times of the day. Avoid especially peak hours when people are going to work or going home or out after work. Always plan extra time in case of delay. Staff are generally friendly and helpful.
,,MRT staff not interested in feedback !,2.0,,"Bukit Panjang MRT station has a newly opened walking linkway recently. On the day of the opening there were some staff standing around to give info. As my 83 year old handicap mother uses the walkway to reach the main entrance, I feedback to the staff that there should be a travellator along the long tunnel to assist the elderly. Moreover, throughout the entire passage only 2 small and short benches were there. I suggested that they should put in at least 1 more bench as the walkway is rather long and the elderly needs to make intermitten rest stops. Moreover, there was no handrail with only a short one, nearing the Mrt gate. There was only 1 toilet next to 711 store (often dirty) located outside the MRT gate but none on the other end.
When I spoke to the MRT station staff, they say they are not in charge and ask me to feedback to the staff standing around. In turn the staff just nodded her head and were more interested in chatting with their friends walking by. They then ask me to write to MRT if ! want.

Such poor service and obviously staff are not interested in feedback. No wonder there is so many frequent breakdowns with such indifferent work attitudes !"
,,smrt experience,5.0,,"Singapore MRT, is an excellent way to travel around singapore. I would advice to purchase the EZ link for multiple use, hiwever,do remember to top up. it is cheaper as compare to single journey. In addition you may use the Ez link card for buses as well. If you are travelling from airport to the city. The SMRT have a stop from Changi airport terminal 2. From changi airport to tana mera station then alight and transfer to another train going to the city.
you may ask for a map of the mrt station from the train counter for easier navigation. Overall SMRT is convenient way to travel around singapore."
,,I WISH...........,5.0,,"I wish We had this service in Melbourne, clean trains, no graffiti, no mess or rubbish, fast reliable service, considerate to other people passengers, puts our ""civilised"" train system to shame.....go take a look Victorian railways, and learn how a service should be run...."
,,Keep hopping,5.0,,"This is an excellent transportation, so convenient and friendly, people so kind and helpful, with the support of the guide that is too friendly too, easy to cope with the signs and chaep if you secure the tourist pass."
,,Best,5.0,,"Despite the grouses of locals, it is about the best, cleanest, and the least crowded Mass Rapid Systems I have used. Off the top of my head I have used these in many cities in Asia and in Europe. Some cities like Shanghai, London etc may have denser coverage but Singapore is less crowded due to its higher frequencies and lower ridership. As for fares I think it is cheaper then in London, but then I have not really compare nor have the statistics."
,,Best way of travel in Singapore,5.0,,The SMRT way of travel in Singapore is inexpensive easy way to travel around . Travellers are always shown courtesy on the train and if needing any directions the people of Singapore are always on hand to assist.The cleanliness is exceptional and destinations are speedily arrived at.
,,Comfy....,5.0,,"So far, I can say that this is the best Mrt that I have used in all the countries I’ve been. We bought tourist pass which allows us to ride unlimited for 3 days. On time, reliable, clean, comfortable, spacious and they have helpful and kind officers/personnel in each stations to help visitors/tourists."
,,Local transport,5.0,,Very efficient and convenient method of city transport Recommended.. Good network Can use for all...
,,Easy and reliable,5.0,,"The MRT is easy to use and it’s worth getting the tap in tap out card with a sensible amount of credit on it. Fares are very cheap and reduce off peak.

Most facilities are stations are accessible

The system is integrated with the bus network

You tap in and out on the MRT gates and tap in on buses. You do not need to tap out on the bus but it is preferred you do to inform passenger patterns for planning purposes

Unlike I think anywhere else you stand on the LEFT on escalators and moving walkways. You will get told off if you do otherwise by Singaporeans but usually politely

All mobile networks work without difficulty on all premises and trains even when underground

A few points of interest:

Each line has a name but don’t take them too literally: this like everything gets abbreviated so North South becomes NS. Each station also has a number unique to each line which is combined to give a simple code NS25 for example

The Circle line is presently an Ark as incomplete albeit substantially built

The Downtown line is unique in looping around and over itself

All trains are air conditioned and completely automated."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Absolutely great way to get around Singapore, cheap fares and frequent fast trains. Plan your route, select your destination, buy your tickets at the machine and off you go, any issues ask the local people always very helpful."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,Once you work out how to get a ticket (cheap as) it is easy to navigate where you need to go. Very clean and well signed. A voice over on the train so you know where you are along with easy to read digital display. Great way to travel around Singapore.

,,Best public transport,5.0,,"A country where you don’t need a transport of your own is Definitely Singapore. Every place is connected with the SMRT! All you need is a card and you have to top it up ad and when you travel. You’ll have to walk a little or take a bus after you get on and off sometimes depending on the place you travel. People are well mannered and wait for the next train if it’s too crowded. The frequency of the trains are super quick! You have atms, shops and food in the stations."
,,easy to use straight off the plane,4.0,,"This is an idiot proof transit system, good even for the most exhausted travellers.
The trains and stations are ridiculously clean (I'm from Paris), people respect the signs and give up their seats to the elderly.
Rides are cheap, my only complaint is the stations can be quite far apart, so you need to be relatively organised when deciding how to go to your destination."
,,best way to travel,5.0,,"best way to travel around singapore, cheap, use pass for more cheaper travel, stops everywhere, covers all of singapore, safe, clean and sound."
,,Very Efficient and Clean,5.0,,"Coming from India, I was a bit to take public transport. Bit, Singapore's public transport is quite different. It is convenient, safe, clean and fast. You just need to purchase a Ez link card in any of the MRT stations or Seven stores and you are good to go. The connectivity in the south singapore is quite good. If you have Google maps, it is quite easy to navigate throughout the Singapore. MRT is much cheaper than taxi. The fare is only calculated from starting to end point irrespective of your transfers, even in bus. Just avoid eating or drinking in MRT as it is an offence. Just try to utilise this transport in Singapore instead of costly taxis as it is perfectly safe."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"We used the SMRT the whole time we were there, it was always clean and on time. Only downside is that the AC was too cold at times."
,,Track maintenance (Red Line),4.0,,Last train at 11pm due to maintenance. Train stopped at AMK. SMRT has provided shuttle bus service and clear announcements for this disruption. Kudos to all staff for their hard work and efficiency in providing a smooth transition to keep the inconveniences to a minimum.
,,We had trouble with ticket machine. A full refund was given.,5.0,,great way to get around singapore.The trains are very clean and run on time. They have signs and announcements for the next station your coming into. Definitely you wont miss your stop.
,,Amazing transport system,5.0,,We used this system on our stopover in Singapore last week. It is the best I have ever used and so easy.
,,Favorite part of Singapore,5.0,,"Subway here is amazing. So clean, so easy to understand. Do note you can only use cash for the single use tickets, and the machines take small bills only. You can have the agent break the bills for you."
,,Without a Hitch,5.0,,SMRT is a fantastic public transport system. Everything seems to work like clockwork. The longest wait was 4 minutes. If it’s great now what will it be when upgrades are complete?
,,Why every city is not like MET Singapore?,5.0,,Amazing only one word amazing from airport to orchard to the office to the substations to your exit terminal wow what a great thinking of human brain for making MRT LOVE THE PROPER ARRANGEMENT
,,Affordable easy and quick,5.0,,"Amazingly efficient transport system . EZ-link card is definitely the way to go.Frequent trains mean you never have to wait too long , comfortable carriages"
,,Modern stations. Antiquated methods of payment.,3.0,,"Although the mass transit system is modern and clean, it didn't seem significantly better than other systems I have used. I didn't stay long enough to get an EZ pass so I bought each ticket as and when I needed it. You have to pay for tickets by cash not card or phone; and even then you can only use $2 or $5 notes, but the minimum you can withdraw from an ATM is $10 or $50. Again, for one of the most advanced metro systems I'm amazed that contactless isn't an option."
,,Easy to navigate and convenient,5.0,,We used the MRT a couple of times. If you plan on doing a lot of sightseeing and you are an individual or couple it is probably worth buying the tourist pass. We walked a lot as the hotel was not that close to an MRT station and there were four of us so as cost effective to get a taxi. We also did a lot of walking.
,,Got an EZ Link Card instead of a Tourist Pass,5.0,,"The SMRT is efficient, clean and safe for traveling around Singapore. We bought the EZ Link Card instead of a tourist pass (which was good for 3 days of travel). This was better for us as we were in Singapore for 6 days. We topped up the EZ Link card when the balance was low, and cashed in the balance on the card after 6 days. This worked out cheaper than the Tourist Card even with the $10 refunded on the Tourist Card."
,,Duplicate this system in my City,5.0,,Good connections anywhere you want to go. The system is easy to use and find your way. Clean and efficient. One doesn't need to ever take a taxi with the SMRT network. Well done. Great connection to the airport as well.
,,"Clean, safe and so easy to use",5.0,,"We used the Singapore MRT while on a recent cruise visit - we were impressed how easy it was to use! We bought single tickets from the vending machine (instructions in English) for $1.70. The trains and stations were spotless clean, no litter, graffiti or vandalism and we felt very safe using the system. Some of these stations are huge and have multiple exits but we managed very well this time."
,,Very efficient,3.0,,The use of the MRT is easy and fast and can even be seen as fun. The prices are cheap and you get to were you want to be in two ticks.
,,Easy & Convenient,5.0,,"Very quick transport. Easy to navigate. Clean trains. Cheap fares. The stations and trains are air conditioned, which is a welcome relief."
,,Easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Took several trips on the SMRT while in Singapore. Very easy to navigate and it takes you to many parts of the City.
,,Cold,1.0,,"Aircon is always too cold and windy, especially in the new cars. Don’t understand the rationale for this as this is bad for the company’s bottom line and promotes the diffusion of germs."
,,breath in to make space,5.0,,"efficient and Very very busy, very clean, make sure you're not eating on the train or you are in big trouble"
,,Very well organised,4.0,,The system is well organised and one can travel any where in the city using this. It is also pretty cost effective compared to taxis
,,Very Convenient,5.0,,"A very well managed, organised and convenient way to get around Singapore if you love to commute and explore like a backpacker. The MRT and LRT are exceptionally well transportation services, which can be availed by one and all.
So, if you are planning to visit the beautiful country, do avail the SMRT (MRT and LRT) services, buy a SMRT card, which can be used both for the metro and buses, easy to top up and once you're returning any deposit on the SMRT card can be refunded at the airport - just visit the MRT kiosk.
Do download the Nestia app from Playstore, which can be used effectively for MRT/ LRT routes, timings etc.
Happy touring"
,,How transport should be!,5.0,,"I was out at Kranji and needed to get back to Pasir Ris and decided I would try the MRT just to compare it with the much maligned public transport in NZ. The first thing to impress was the fact there are barriers which a) prevent people getting on the tracks and b) let people know exactly where the doors will open. I had a brief wait for my train to Jurong East and got to check out some different parts of the island through the four starts on the way. The explanation of what side to get off the train to get the connection going in my direction was also pretty simple. I had a one minute wait for the connecting train which was rather full and meant I had to stand most of the way into the city. The bonus of this was the fact I had an unimpeded view out the windows so, again, could enjoy the view and a different perspective of the island. I didn't spot another European on the MRT, which I put down to the cheapness of the taxis (it had only cost me $23 to get to Kranji) but I would recommend the MRT as a brilliant way to get around and see a little more. It was also a helpful lesson in pronunciation of some of the different areas! Once I got to the Pasir Ris station it was really simple to find the departure place for my bus and line up and wait for the next one to come along. The tag on-tag off system is also simple, easy and super cheap. This is how public transport should be!"
,,Clean efficient way of getting around,4.0,,"Efficient, clean, on time. The best and cheapest way (although not that cheap) to get around in Singapore. Easy to find and plenty of stations. Train cards are clean and user friendly. The double doors before entering inpressed me - no risk of people on rails !"
,,Best public transportation I've ever had!,5.0,,"It's not a surprise Singapore MRT is the best public transportation I've had in my life. Fast, punctual, and clean! Every station name is written clearly so we don't get confuse and lost.

Top-up machine has various language to choose. I remember there are English & Chinese. You can top-up the card with cash minimal SGD10."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"One of the best public transport system in the world...the network is wide, the precision is worth applauding...though Singapore is a very small country and maintenance is comparatively easier to many countries in Europe & Asia, yet, the high error free daily operations makes the SMRT stand out from the rest. Very rare disruptions, great frequency, safe and hassle free travels.

Highly recommended...
TIP - Tourists' should try MRT ... its well connected to allmost all places, faster and economical compared to taxis. The friendly MRT staffs at each station needs special mention."
,,MRT,5.0,,"This is the best was to travel. You can get a pass but you will have to pay a deposit which will be returned back to you. The price travelling by MRT is inexpensive, fast and awesome."

One of the best way to explore the city beside bus.
If you come often to Singapore, I recommend to purchase the ezlink card for more convenience which can use for MRT and buses as well."
,,"Clean, Efficient & Good Value",5.0,,"The best mode of transportation in Singapore for tourists especially with the Singapore tourist pass (i.e. cash card which you may top up at the vending machine at each station). It is much cheaper to have the tourist pass than purchasing individual standard ticket (single or return). The trains are spotlessly clean, with good air conditioning and efficiently punctual."
,,Best Way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"I am amazed by the connectivity that the MRT offers in Singapore. For tourists, there is a Singapore Tourist Pass available valid for 3 days at 20 SG$. And that probably would be the only money one would need to spend to Travel in Singapore for 3 days if you are using MRT. Simply awesome and highly recommended for travel within Singapore"
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"a quick ,safe , cool way to get around Singapore , you can buy a one, two or three day pass which covers the MRT and buses. Trains leave every few min . you just need to decide which line you want to be on its all clearly signed when to change to various other lines."
,,Excellent and easy,5.0,,Excellent way to travel in Singapore buy a ticket and you can get anywhere super smooth system never long to wait between trains
,,Excellent system,5.0,,The transport system in Singapore is an excellent way to get around purchased a card that could be topped up at station and during our two week stay did not spend more than $30 this included busses as well . One of the only places in the world I have visited where never felt intimidated or unsure about using at various times of day or night . Best way to get around a very traffic laden city

,,Efficient Land Transport,5.0,,Very cheap but dependable multi-modal transport system. Network is well planned. Almost every part of the City is connected to MRT. Quite user friendly. It's the best way to go around Singapore while is a vacation trip.
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,The Singapore MRT system is world class. Easy to use and very clean. Paying is a breeze with the EZ Link card.
,,Last train,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is very good, it’s clean and safe. We found ourselves having to get the last train as we lost track of time. As a result we were told by very helpful staff to catch train and pay at our alighting station. A good and easy way to get around Singapore especially due to humidity above ground!"
,,Convenient and reliable,5.0,,The MRT system is super convenient and trains arrive every 3-4 minutes. Just look at the map layout and you will get the idea within 5 minutes. Google maps also helps as well and will also let you know where to exchange trains if you're lost.
,,"Efficient, Clean and Easy to Use",5.0,,"The MRT is an efficient, clean and easy method to get around the city. Different lines take you to different destinations; however, the various train lines are fairly easy to navigate at each connecting station as there are different levels for each of the different color lines."
,,Very civilised.,5.0,,"We used a day pass. Everything was so easy. Passengers offered their seats as if it was the norm, which we guess it was."
,,Excellent Transport system,5.0,,Excellent transportation system. All MRT time table always match with the bus time table. No reason you need to drive your own car. The best part is the local always give away their sitting for the elderly.
,,Most convenient transportation in Singapore,5.0,,Very convenient and affordable transportation in Singapore. You can reach your destination on time.. as Long as there’s no train failure.. but then when there’s a train failure they also never fail to notify all the passengers ahead of time... kuddos to Singapore’s railway system it always amazes my family and friends when they came here for holidays
,,"Great, convenient, cheap transport option",5.0,,"When we arrived in Singapore we were not familiar with the MRT system yet. We asked an information centre on the best way to the zoo, and they told us about how convenient MRT would be for our stay in Singapore. We purchased one of the ez-link cards, and pretty much used it every day during our stay. The stations are conveniently located throughout the city, and if the train station is too far, there is usually a bus you can catch to get even closer, all on the same ez-link.
We really think it's worth purchasing an ez-link card, it's very affordable and is a valuable travel tool to get around Singapore."
,,No need for a car,5.0,,Getting around on the MRT in Singapore is so easy. You will need anEZ card which will cost around $15 singapore dollars including some top up
,,Bay Front Station -- No sign board prompt,3.0,,"No sign board to prompt the direction , while entering into the gate , and l was standing in front of two going downward escallator ... Such a busy raiway station , and there are something can be done better."

,,"Cool, efficient public transport system",4.0,,"This has to be one of the best modes of public transport and comparable to the best anywhere in the world. Staff are stationed at strategic places to help out commuters. Maps in various points inside and outside the stations and in the trains. You can get to most places of interest in Singapore on the MRT, some needing a short bus connection.

Can get rather noisy and crowded at peak times. But it does get you where you want to go."
,,SMRT,4.0,,I travel around with MRT. Overall it is good and pleasant. Do not try it during peak hours 8am-9:30am. 6pm - 7pm. It will be squeezing through with many people using it too.
,,great transportation!,5.0,,"very cheap, fast, and easy to understand. make sure you understand which line you need to take and the route the train will move to so you don't take wrong lines. take the farthest doors while boarding the train (the front or back compartment) so you can always have a seat rather than taking the middle ones where most people will go in through. doors open only for 1 min, or around 2-3mins in interchange stations."
,,A great way to get around,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, trains anly minutes apart. Well signed and easy to use for international visitors. Trains are air conditioned."
,,A great way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"Frequency and speed the MRT is a great way to get around Singapore. With an expanding network, sparkling clean stations and helpful staff there are not many places you cannot reach in the city nation. Sentosa, Haw Par Villa and Kranji are a few places we visited in our last trip. As we visit Singapore about every 18 months or so and always pack out MRT cards!"
,,Excellent Public Transport,5.0,,"I have traveled in many countries and never have had the same experience as Singapore MRT. They are convenient, reliable and so affordable. I would pick taking trains over Taxi's all the time as no traffic jams and cheap too!"
,,Use the mass MRT!,5.0,,"Sure you can get a ""Grab"" or taxi anywhere in the city and easier than most. But if you want to experience the real Singapore and see the locals take the MRT. The lines are easy to learn and you can get a multi-day tourist pass for $20-$30. You will never see a cleaner mass transit. People are nice and follow the rules, what a concept! :)"
,,Most comfortable way to travel,4.0,,"As soon as you land at Singapore airport take a MRT pass which is cheap & allows you to use the train service for 5 days and connects every location, you can also download the SIN map which will guide you to all connecting stations where you can change to reach your destination . There are malls above the stations . The best place to visit is expo station which has a mall opposite & prices of products are really inexpensive . It’s one station before the airport & a good place to do final shopping before leaving Singapore . Taxis are expensive in Singapore"
,,How to get around in Singapore,5.0,,First time in Singapore and we first took the mrt from airport to our hotel in the downtown core. All the information is in English as well as local languages. The ticket machines are SO intuitive ( although we missed the bit about return tickets meant return on the same day). And the system allows you to reuse your paper ticket which helps to eliminate waste paper. Oh. And so cheap! 2.40 from airport to downtown Singapore. Why would you travel any other way?
,,not the best train system in SG,3.0,,"first class country but not the first class transport system many singaporeans would feel. signal faults are erratic, but you could still count on it if you want to get to places most of the time"
,,More than efficient and cheap,5.0,,"Great way to get about Singapore, we bought a three day pass (30SGD) (10SGD) refunded after use) which is good for buses as well as the underground"
,,Easily manoeuvred,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is excellent. Clean, frequently scheduled, easy to access. At some stations staffed desks with helpful people. Make sure that you have a supply of smaller notes ($5s or $2s) to purchase tickets, as the ticket machines don't accept $10s and above."
,,SMRT,3.0,,"Always crowded, need to stand. Announcement usually have hiccups. Very frequent trips, every 3-5 mins. Too many people, noisy. Should educate people not to talk too loudly."
,,Very convenient!,4.0,,"One of the cheapest and the most convenient method of transportation to explore around Singapore. There are many lines and stations leading to a lot of the most famous attractions in SG. For example,Bugis,Chinatown,Little India etc."
,,The best and easiest way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"If you are staying in Singapore for more than a few days I recommend getting a “EZ” card. It’s a couple of S$ cheaper to purchase from a Tourist information centre. You easily top it up with credit at the machines within the stations. You can also use it on the also excellent bus system. The whole transport system is integrated, efficient, very clean, easy to use AND cheap. At the end of your trip you can get your credit refunded or it will last for 5 years. Plan your journeys with any of the free mobile apps available."
,,On the train,5.0,,"Have visited Singapore nearly 7 times and am always impressed with the MRT performance. Reasonably priced, efficient and clean. No matter where you are in Singapore there always seems to be a station nearby."
,,Good train service on time,5.0,,I travelled from Novena to Orchad in the MRT was good experience. People are not that disciplined as Japan as they do not wait till until you get off from the train. But you should try this
,,Good but brokedown often,3.0,,Convenient to travel around the city using using MRT. Only drawback is that it constant breakdown and delay are too common.
,,efficient cheap transport,4.0,,"best way to transfer in singapore. but if your rout has long walk from MRT, you can always try the bus. the MRT is clean, fast, reliable."
,,"Clean, spacious & reliable",4.0,,"As you would expect in Singapore, the subway system is extremely well designed, & efficient, all the signs are in English, which is fantastic. . Its all fairly new (relative to London & most other cities), the stations & concourses are like airports: spacious & free flowing, Even at rush hour, the carriages are wide enough to feel uncrowded. And it is SO CHEAP. A journey will cost under a quid (can’t remember exactly) ..Get yourself a travel card, & stick a few S$ on it. You’ll go far!
There’s no eating or drinking allowed, there is No litter at all, no smoking, & everyone is polite.

The only tiny issue I had was that I wish the station platform signs showed ‘North/Sounth/etc bound’ , as, sometimes, it was hard to know which train was going where if you were in a rush, & didn’t have time to look up where that particular train was terminating.
And it doesn’t go to Sentosa. Tut.
All in all, a fantastic way to get about."
,,Easiest way to get around SG,5.0,,"MRT is a great way to get around in Singapore. It’s efficient and reasonably priced based on the distance you travel. Good interchanging capabilities to hop on another line. Better to get an ezlink card that would save you monies as compared to buying tickets each time. Certain contactless cards are also accepted at the gantry but better to check before you plan your travel.

Please note that eating or drinking inside the MRT is prohibited so please hyderate yourself well before you travel."
,,Easy Transport,5.0,,"This has to be one of the MRTs to use and get around Singapore.
The trains are quick, on time and people move on and off very quickly.
We purchased a card for the length of time we were there, much cheaper than buying one daily.
Very easy to top up."
,,Love Singapore MRT,5.0,,Every time I go to Singapore I love to travel in their MRT. It's so cheap and convenient and it takes you to all the important points in Singapore. Great for tourists.
,,great service,5.0,,It is a really great experience they are on time all the time. It is easy to get around from a to b and it is chep
,,Perfect,5.0,,"The MRT is the perfect way to travel all over Singapore. Always on time, always clean, always safe. Very easy to navigate your way through each station and an easy map to see exactly where you are going. Friendly and helpful staff on all stations."
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"I can rate it as one of the best public transports available in world.

Name the place on map and you can see some connectivity.

Best part is bus and train billings are linked if you are SMRT,ez link, nets card user. So if you are travelling from point A to D by using bus then train and again bus, still u will have to pay fair for full journey. Like taking only 1 bus end to end.

Mrt is faster while buses will show you Singapore :)"
,,Well linked and still adding on more stations,4.0,,Well connected. Trying to be a less Car Driven Society. The Governtment is trying their best to make the stations well linked. Making millions travel daily. Hope we will have less breakdowns. I still prefer to hold on to my Cars.
,,Wow!,5.0,,I am very pleased to experience one of the most comprehensive and modern railway system in this part of the world and still they are to construct more over and under Singapore. Highly rated five stars for me.
,,well linked and clean,4.0,,"Singapore MRT transport thousands of commuters daily. You can get near to many tourist places. Friendly service crew and clean environment. Although services has been intermittent of recent years, it hasnt fail as badly. if you are not relying on it to get to work early in the morning or attending an important appointment you cant missed in your life, it is the best way and most affordable to get around the city for sure."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (Subway),3.0,,"Generally, its quite an efficient public transport system. However, due to the growing population with foreign immigrants and the previous lack of maintenance has taken a toll at the system. As a result, cases of breakdown become common occurrences. Hopefully, with the recent effort to catch up on the maintenance and bug-fixing, the problem can be eventually resolved."
,,Travel like the Breeze,5.0,,"With Singapore's efficient MRT , it is easy to reach any destination with comfort. The trains are so clean and well maintained. Do not eat or drink in the MRTs which is strictly prohibited and liable for hefty fine.
First time users, do not be scared or anxious. There are sign boards and maps everywhere to guide you , that, there is no need to ask directions from anyone. Use the ""gothere.sg"" website which provides you the exact route to your destination. You require nothing else !
As for the tickets , you can purchase them at the self-operating kiosks which are available in all MRT stations.
If you are a tourist and need to use the MRTs very often in a day, i would recommend purchasing EZ-link card. The card can be purchased at changi airport itself for 10$ . Note the following :

1. 5$ out of the 10 , is the price of the card, which cannot be refunded. The remaining 5$ can be used for travelling.

2. When your card value is below 5$ , you are given a warning to recharge , when you scan the card.

3.If your card value is 3$ or below , you will not be allowed to use the MRT.

4. The card can be recharged at 7-11 shops , and the kiosks in all MRT stations. The minimum recharge value is 10$."
,,"Very efficient, value for money",5.0,,"Singapore SMRT is the back bone of SG for people commuting. Networks very well with Bus as the bus interchanges are placed next to MRT stations for the last mile connectivity together with LRT connections. Safe and comfortable rides, to almost any part, on time.

Super clean (Do not drink / or eat on stations / on board SMRT), there can be a fine too. Easy connectivity between various lines - Circle line connecting to all other lines. fully accesscible for physically challenged or with heavy luggage (though not recommended) connecting the airport with main city and business areas"
,,SPEEDY SERVICE,5.0,,excellent way to negotiate Singapore. Services are frequent and there are many stations conveniently placed.
,,Brilliant system,5.0,,"Australia could learn alot from this country in many different ways. The public transport system is magnificent. The trains and busses will take you literally anywhere you could possibly want to go and if lost there is always someone willing help you.

,,Fingers crossed for a smooth ride,2.0,,"In Singapore, there are two main networks of public transports, namely the trains and the buses. Both does the job well on most days and complements each other to complete one’s journey in the shortest time possible.
Most train rides are generally smooth and gets me from point A to B without hassle. The newer driverless trains are pretty entertaining as you stand at the front of the cabin watching the train transverse along the rails automatically.
However, the train systems, both old and new, breaks down so often in recent years, it had caused major disruptions and inconvenience to all commuters.
I personally preferred the reliability of the buses these days. With the help of Google maps, I am able to alight closer to my destination at the designated bus stop."

Most waiting areas were air conditioned and inside the train there were several seats reserved for the elderly, disabled or pregnant ladies. Being an elderly person but still able to stand in the train, I have been tapped on the shoulder several times by people who wanted to give up their seat for me. At the doors of the train, lines were painted on the floor to designate where people who wanted to enter the train can stand to let passengers leaving the train room to exit the tram. Quite a pleasant experience"

,,"Modern, Clean and Efficient",4.0,,"Singapore's Mass Rapid Transport (SMRT) is a modern, clean and efficient system.

It is a great example of how good a transit system can be - and many cities would do well to take a leaf out of Singapore's system.

The stations are very clean. They take pride in cleanliness. The trains run on time. All the signs are clear to read and understand. The metro system is air conditioned. There is orderliness in passengers entering and exiting coaches. The carriages are air conditioned.

I went with my wife and young daughter. we bought a tourist travel pass valid for three days. This gave us unlimited travel on the metro and bus system for three days. Each pass costs 30 Singapore Dollars (including a deposit) - but when you return it you get your deposit back. It is valid for travel from the city centre to the airport.

The whole metro system is easy to use. If you have any difficulty there are staff to assist you."
,,A lot of Cities around the world could learn a lot from the SMRT,5.0,,"By far the best transport system I have ever used in any country. Cheap, efficient and without a doubt one of the safest ways to travel. Once you have your SMRT card you can travel by the MRT and bus anywhere you want to go.

,,Time to upgrade,3.0,,Smell of burning while traveling in the East-West line from Clementi to Paya Lebar station. The a/c is not strong as not sure if environment friendly as to keep at 25 degree despite weather is so humid and overcrowded. Hopefully the management find time to review and improve...
,,Cheap transport in singapore,5.0,,"Easiest way to get around to most places in Singapore. Cheap as chips, we got a three day tourist pass for thirty Singapore dollars, got ten dollars back when we handed the pass back. All MRT and bus travel on the one pass.

,,Being extended,5.0,,"It already covers most of the island but is being extended in preparation for banning private cars. The soil is being used to make more land to build T5 at Changi. Love the thinking.
Clean (of course), safe frequent and easy to use. You need a good reason to splash on taxis."
,,"Efficient, safe and cost effective",5.0,,"We used the MRT on a daily basis during our stay in Singapore.

We found the system easy to navigate and really efficient. At any time, we didn't need to wait for any more than 4 minutes for our train to arrive.

There are several ticketing options available, but as we were on a short stay we used the Standard Tickets. Even though these are issued on a vinyl protected card, they are able to be reloaded for 6 trips. Instructions on ticketing machines are clear and easy to follow and if you run into difficulties there is a customer service booth close to ticket machines.

The stations are well signposted and clean. I would recommend that you make a note of which street you want to exit onto as there are several exits, but all are signposted.

The MRT is a great transport system and as a tool for getting to where you need to be in Singapore it is invaluable."

,,SMRT (Singapore Military Running Trains),1.0,,"Singaporeans from all walks of life who like to take public transport because cars are for rich people have come out to advice SMRT.

This after SMRT’s managing director of trains and ex-Republic of Singapore Air Force officer Lee Ling Wee admitted the train operator cannot deal with massive train disruptions on its own.

In response, one helpful Singaporean, Kee Zho Peng, said he empathises with SMRT and can only think of one solution that will be win-win for all: “SMRT so poor thing. Only capable of collecting revenue and making profits but not deal with problems.”

“Therefore, it is quite clear that the Singapore Armed Forces must take over SMRT. This is because there are already so many military men within SMRT’s ranks, the transition will be smooth.”

Another Singaporean said this bodes well with the calls from all quarters to nationalise the transport rail network in the first place.

One local, Boh Hua Qia, said: “This will then cause the train system to function with some efficiency as there is plenty of redundancy within the SAF, with all these men who are training for war all the time but always living in peace, which means they are not living up to their fullest potential while still collecting salary.”

“Furthermore, SMRT can still keep its current acronym: Singapore Military Regime Transit.”

“So convenient.”"
,,Very efficient and easy to navigate,5.0,,"This is a great way to see some of the major sights in S’pore. I was here for a couple of days and so I got a day pass and covered the Botanical Gardens, Raffles Place, Gardens by the Bay and other sights. Even a child can navigate the system because it is so simple and color coded. Very clean and fun to ride."
,,Runs like clock work,5.0,,"SMRT is the perfect and cheapest way to get around Singapore. The rail destination are colour coordinated and the trains run on time every 3min. I wish Melbourne trains ran this efficient and cheap, this would fix our traffic havoc."
,,MRT review,5.0,,"Really good transit system. The hotels, bus stops and attractions are near the MRT station. Train frequency is very good. Very polite passenger service staff. Toilets are decent and free of cost. Orchard, Bay Front and Harbour Front MRT stations have exit to Mall. Buy EZ link card from the air port as it is the cheapest way of paying for MRT and bus tickets. The top up for this card has to be done via the ticket machine which is present at every MRT, minimum 10 SGD top up. One can pay using 10 SGD notes only. This card is valid for 5 years. Cost of the card is 5 SGD."
,,Long waiting times,2.0,,The trains arrive after a long wait. There were many people and was so crowded. Not a nice experience as a tourist.
,,Travel Singapore way !!,4.0,,We took an EEz pass from the airport itself. One time payment for three days of unlimited travel in MRT and bus. The MRT conviently connects the most frequented tourist places in Singapore. China town little india are easily accessible. Good and economical way to see Singapore local way.
,,MASS RAPID TRANSIT (MRT) OF SINGAPORE,4.0,,"The mass rapid transit rail system is one of the best transport methods in Singapore. the trains are well airconditioned, clean and maintain punctuality. the announcement and information pertaining to the arrival and direction of trains are well maintained and even a newcomer can travel as he likes since maps are found placed at appropriate locations within stations and entry and exit points. few seats are allotted for senior citizens and invalid travellers. most of the time the trains are well patronised."

,,Great Trip to the Airport,5.0,,"We decided after spending a couple of days in Singapore and using the SMRT that we would take it to the airport for our return flight back to Australia. We had a station just outside our hotel so that made it very easy and it was great. All the stations have lifts so no problem with your bags, the trains are wide inside so very easy to have your bag with you as you don't block the isle and everywhere is very well signed. You changed once and then when you get to the airport you arrive at terminal 2 but is was so easy to navigate to terminal 3 and it cost us $2.50 each which would have been cheaper if we had bought a SMRT card."
,,Convenient and Fast,5.0,,"Travel with MRT is very convenient and fast. You will never get lost if u know the station name, just follow the direction board or you can ask the officer. If you are travellers (who afraid to get lost) better purchase Singapore Touris Pass (1d=$10, 2d=$16, 3d=$20, also deposit $10/card which will return to you when you return back the card). With the card, you can also take unlimited Bus, LRT and MRT services (except few special rides)."
,,Great value for a tourist,5.0,,"We used a 3 day tourist pass. It was great value for getting around on trains and buses and saved us a lot of walking. Very regular services, clean and safe."
,,Makes Australia City Rail look like its in the dark ages,5.0,,"Awesome, coming from Australia where rail service is late, and just damm difficult, this was a breeze, organised, ontime and easy to navigate.

Dont use taxis in Singapore use the rail system (infact we were ripped off in a taxi by $30 - from the airport, wont happen again)

Needless to say clean and safe. woot woot!"

,,Nice metro,4.0,,Took metro to go to bugis street from little india. However the metro was a bit distant but still it was very convenient and cost effective. The best part was one can put currency inside the machine and enter the destination and the remaining balance comes automatically. Very much like delhi metro so it was easy to understand
,,Modern comfortable cool,5.0,,This is the way to get around Singapore. Restrictions on car use on what is a crowded island are balanced by a world class public trans[port system. Just don't take any durian on board!

Modern, rapid, clean, cost effective and could be a model for any modern city.
Easy to access for all. Have experienced a number of cities train systems and this is as good as it gets.
Highly recommended"
,,Idiot proof,5.0,,The service is so clean and efficient it makes me angry to be from London. It's super easy to use once you have your top up card and announcements are in English. We found this the best way to travel around the city and to and from the airport. For example a taxi from the airport to raffles place was $18 where the metro was $2.50
,,Connects perfectly to most areas,5.0,,I must say the system is effectively connected in Singapore and they are having more stations / stops coming up. Great for travelling around the island. Easy to understand the signs. And map system is quite well explained. Except that some of the older trains don’t have a lighted LED map in the cabins to tell you which direction the train is heading towards. It would be best if all the cabins were upgraded to tell you direction it’s heading towards and which side of the door is opening.
,,Cheap and clean,4.0,,Excellent way to get round the city for a very modest price. Get a tourist pass from customer service but only certain stations sell them...Changi airport is one.

Bus ride in city in upper deck kids will enjoy."
,,Singapore family holiday,5.0,,"When it comes to the MRT all I can say is simply use it!
Clean, Fast, efficient, relatively cheap!
We were there for 10 days so the advertised tourist pass was ‘expensive’, we simply bought an EZlink card at one of the MRT stations. These are $7 (which includes $2 credit) that can be charged via credit card and used across Rail (MRT), Bus and also on the Santosa Express (monorail)"
,,Easy Peasy,5.0,,"Easy to use, efficient, and clean. The air conditioning was not very even, but at least there is air conditioning. The MRT card can also be used for the bus so if you're going to use the bus make sure you always have some money on your card for that."
,,Cheap and efficient travel,4.0,,"MRT is very good and put some cities underground system to shame. Cheap, efficient, clean and on time; what more can you ask for?"

,,Excellent,5.0,,"This would have to be the most efficient transport system, easy to navigate and safe to use. Most impressive of all was the regularity of the trains, had no more than a few minutes wait. It was the quickest and cheapest to get around. Invest in a MRT card to log on and off it’s well worth the money"
,,Super easy to use and get around,5.0,,"We only used the SMRT once during our trip (travelling from Orchard Road to Marina Bay Sands).

It was very easy to buy tickets and find our way to the platform. The speaker on the train was very clear and easy to understand and we knew which station to disembark at. It is also very safe.

We would have used it more if we had the need to."
,,fast!,5.0,,"Fast and convinient! Affordable mode of transportation, maps and directions are really helpful. Cheers."

Try and find that on other countries buses.We are seniors when we get on the underground trains and they are full there is a rush from younger people to give us there seats,it does not happen in our country. We also like to travel by public transport if you get lost the Singapore people always come and help you"
,,Fast brilliant system.,5.0,,This train system is absolutely brilliant. The trains are fast and smooth and the line system is quite easy to work out. Stations are very clean which is probably because there is no eating or shops at the stations. When you go down the escalators to the platform it is easy to find which side you should be going as it is all marked at the track edge which is covered in so no one can fall. The train doors aligns perfectly with the platform ones. Tourists can get a 2-3 day ticket which is unlimited and if returned you get a $ 10.00 refund.
,,Great transportation,5.0,,"If you would like to visit Singapore, i would highly recomend MRT as transportation. their MRT is tourist friendly. With map everywhere, you can find map in all MRT station. The map is easy to read and have clear direction.

From North-South (red) line to East-West (green) line to Downtown line to Circle line. It is the best public transport for tourists as it stops in almost most of the places of interest. So you can literally go to Merlion Park, Chinatown, Little India, Garden by the Bay, Botanical Garden, Thian Hock Keng Temple, Parliment Buikding, etc. Not to forget to Harbourfront where you can then change to Sentosa. It surely breaks the road traffic jam during peak hour. Its covenient and economy way of travelling too. Most importantly you get to see the livelihood of this Garden City."

We had no problems at all, other than figuring out which exit to use at each station!"
,,Easy to Navigate,5.0,,"Clean, reliable easy to navigate public transport system. Clear signage. Felt very safe. Trains every 3 to 5 minutes."
,,Easy,5.0,,"My experience on the MRT was an easy one.
I’m a solo traveller and adventurous, when I got stuck or confused with directions, people and staff helped.
The line is colour coded, so all I needed to remember was which colour line to take.
The fare was cheap, used same ticket to and from my destination.
There is NO smoking which is a huge bonus to myself, in fact no food or drink, even water, is allowed.
Can’t wait to venture out some more next visit."
,,Cheap efficient travel,5.0,,"This type of transport should be mandatory in every country. Fantastic!

Simply click on the map, select where you would like to travel to, add number if tickets you require and then pay and the machine prints the tickets. So simple to use.

Mrt is clean, air conditioned and has seating if required.

You can top up the ticket to use again and again or you can purchase one that lasts 24hrs, 48hrs with unlimited travel."
,,5/5,5.0,,"Just superb. Almost whole of singapore covered.
Only thing for visitors is i think it works out cheaper if you buy the $5 Ez link card and then top up. eg - it will mostly cost 77 cents to travel few stations, but $ 1.50 if you buy single ticket. It adds up if you plan to stay a few days in singapore.
Only you can only top up minimum of $SGD $10 if the card value decreases below $3.
So on my penultimate day, my card had only $2.75, thus next day i bought single ticket to come to airport ($2.75). My partner had $3.15 on penultimate day so could use EZ link for next day to airport without buying other tickets.
Otherwise excellent lift and escalator facilities. Public Toilets are clean and plentiful."
,,Cheap and convenient,4.0,,"As a resident of Singapore, I can attest the great convenience, reliability and low price of Singapore's MRT system. It is very quick and efficient, and not to mention, air-conditioned! There are many stations, especially in near the city, so tourists can easily find their way around, and it is very well-connected. Trains come around every 4 minutes so it is great and the wait is not too long. Wonderful experience!

Try to avoid peak hours though as there will be many office workers."
,,First Time in Singapore,4.0,,First time for us here in Singapore and we decided to take the train from the Airport into the city. Since we have arrived we have been taking the train and I must say it is great. It is easy to find Your way around and it is cheaper than taxis.
,,Brilliant - London Underground is poor in comparison,5.0,,Tourists can purchase a pass which allows them unlimited access to the MRT network. All trains are air-conditioned.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Trains run all the time the most we waited for any train was about 4 minutes.
Trains are maintained well and very clean and the air conditioning is wonderful.
The cost is so cheap and often takes less time than a taxi.
An excellent and affordable way to get any where you need to go in Singapore."
,,An efficient public transport system,5.0,,"There are few places you cannot reach, using the SMRT. It is efficient and tickets are relatively cheap.

Like any underground train system, you must plan the route and buy a ticket. You are charged a 10c deposit on the ticket, so reload your card and save.

Loved the SMRT"
,,Excellent way to get around,4.0,,"This was an excellent way to get around Singapore. We purchased a 3 day Tourist Pass at a cost of $20 + $10 deposit each. We didn’t think this was good value for money as is cheaper to pay as you go, but the Pass is more convenient. The system is very easy to use, clean, frequent and always on time. And we particularly liked the electronic display on the train which lit up at each station as you approached it."
,,Fast and cheap transportation,5.0,,"Clean, fast, cheap, but quite confusing for first timers. Just learn the lines color and last station. Many signs that help you inside the station"
,,Forget about wasting your money on a tourist pass,5.0,,The MRT is so cheap don’t waste your money on the tourist pass just pay the 77c or 1.39 for a good length trip In 3 days of travel using the mrt as go to transport we used $12
,,Singapore by rail,5.0,,Reasonably easy to use and always staff around to ask or check if you're heading in the right direction. One tip is to have smaller amounts of currency like $2 or $5 notes as machines only dispense limited amounts of change. The usual cost is $1.50 - $1.80 per single trio.
,,Easy and clean,5.0,,"Amongst the countries I have been to Singapore would have to be my favorite when it comes to MRT system. Always reliable, clean and on point. You dont have to solve a maze like train system unlike in Japan and you dont have to deal with bums sleeping in stations like in NY. Very easy to navigate and the stations are practically within walking stations. I am so in love with their train system here"
,,MRT travel,5.0,,Excellent safe and cheap. A great way to get around Singapore. Just make sure you have coins or low notes as the automatic machines will only give a maximum of $4 change.
,,Great way of getting around quickly,4.0,,"The SMRT is straightforward and easy to use. Best way is to go to the electronic map, identify where you want to go, press that destination and ""voila"", you know which line to take."
,,Great sevice and great value,5.0,,"We purchased out travel pass at the airport and then topped it up once for our three days in Singapore, we traveled all over the place for less then $15.00 and we thought this was great value and very easy."
,,"THE BEST METRO IN QUALITY, EFFICIENCE, EASY TO USE AND SO CLEAN !",5.0,,"I stayed in Singapore 8 nights in May 2018. I had the opportunity to use the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit on several occasions. I should say that after having used the metro of London, Paris, Barcelona and Moscow, this one is really THE BEST ONE I ever saw !!! It is without drivers (all automated), efficient, large cabin, in very good condition, clean, many staffs are available to help and assist if needful, maps are clear and easy to read and understand even for tourists. Bravo ! Generally speaking, pay for what you use ! You choose on the TV map by finger to which station you want to go to, choose 1 or 2 ways, then credit your ticket (can be used 6 times, by recharging it on the manchine, very simple and easy). o not buy a full day ticket or 3 days full because you will not use the metro enough for what you paid. Usually, I was paying between 3-4 Singapore Dollars for a 2 way tickets, depending on how far I was going of course.
I will add some photos for you to see how it looks like.

otterboris"
,,Very impressive,5.0,,"Very easy to navigate, helpful attendants, economical, clean,and fast. If only we had this at home! No food or drink allowed on the station or in the train. Multiple journey passes available....good if you are staying a few days."
,,Benchmark metro system,5.0,,We were using Fort Canning (newly minted station on Downtown line) as a base to explore near and far corners of the island. The whole experience as an MRT user was fantastic. The EZ link stored value card is super convenient.
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"MRT is the best way to get around Singapore. Clean, easy to use and cheaper than using taxis. One of the best underground systems that I have ever used."
,,Excellent network,4.0,,Singapore MRT is one of the best covering the entire city. If you’re a tourist get a Ezlink or NETS card from one of the counters and keep on topping as per your usage. The same card is valid on public transport buses as well. The only drawback of the card is the 5 SGD non refundable amount associated with it.
,,Very efficient,5.0,,Our hotel hoice was made because of the proximity to the MRT.We bought our tickets and planned our adventures around the MRT system.There is almost nowhere you need to go that can't be reached easily.Buying the card was easy and topups are just as easy at any station.Signage within the stations make finding the correct exit simple.The trains themselves are very clean.Plus the train services are very frequent-often less than 5 minutes apart at peak times.
,,Amazing way to get around,5.0,,Really quick and fast transportation. it is also really cool to be on the train with so many people heading to work and to do their daily tasks. There are many stops so you can go basically anywhere around Singapore!
,,Best way to cris-cross Singapore on your own !,5.0,,"During our 6 days stay at SGP, we extensivly travelled by MRT. We had taken the 3 day tourist pass / ticket. It is the best way to cover Singapore attractions on your own. Even if you are visiting singapore with any trip organizer, do spare one day to travel in SGP on your own using MRT. And if you are with kidssss....they enjoy the MRT by standing at the front of the train (driving !!!). Also the 4 language announcements , you will love to hear them often , especially the one ""Berhati hati di ruang platform ! ""......"
,,Easy to use and understand,5.0,,Well mrt in Singapore are really easy to use. Just study the map n ull be all right. The only thing is that you need to look at saveral destination on the map to know which direction the train is moving towards. Other than that you can basically go everywhere with its mrt system
,,GREAT AND EASY!,5.0,,Very clean. Super easy to use and navigate. Very safe and goes to all major attractions around Singapore
,,been on better,3.0,,slightly confusing to work out where to get off with the english and chinese languages . the trains are very clean and quiet
,,Cheapest way to travel across the city.,4.0,,"Very cheap price for ticket especially if u get a tourist pass. But sometimes it is faster to take a taxi, like grab, but two or three times price would be higher for the taxi. Lets say to get from marina south pier to harbourfront i spent 10 minutes in car, but 20 in mrt cause of three lane changes."
,,MRT best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,My friend and I used the MRT whilst we were in Singapore. It only cost us $20 each for 6 days travel using both trains and buses. Very easy to navigate and very safe and clean. We also met and talked to some locals which is always a bonus. The MRT is fantastic and definitely gets my tick of approval.
,,Excellent,5.0,,The MRT seems to be everywhere you want to go or get back from so is extremely convenient. It is also cheap at about $1.50 for most of the rides we took within the city area. You can keep your ticket and reuse it saving 10c on the next four trips if so inclined. Because there are multiple exits it’s wise to figure out which one you need to take to get closest to your destination as you might end up some distance away. If your feet like mine had taken a bit of hammering during the day it’s also wise to take the lift to the ticket concourse (or conversely down to the platform) rather than escalators. Sometimes there are a mind boggling seven levels! Wise to carry an MRT map with you but plenty of location maps around. An excellent way to get around.
,,Public transports passengers,4.0,,Good and well-organised organization. Good information is given at all stations. Fast and efficient.
,,Very Helpful Service,5.0,,"We used SMRT when we traveled from Changi Airport to Marina bay. It was very useful and convenient. When you travel it is must to follow the manners like no eating, drinking inside a train or at a station."
,,Easy travel,5.0,,The trains in Singapore are excellent and cheap The staff helpful and friendly. The trains are spotlessas as are the stations.. I had no trouble using the trains In Singapore.
,,No need for a car in Singapore,5.0,,"The public transportation system is excellent, organized and cheap compared to other modes in transportations in one of the most expensive cities in the world. You can almost reach any attraction in singapore using the metro alone, so no much need of a car here."
,,Fast and comfortable,5.0,,"Very good way to travel around Singapur. A little bit expensive, but fast, comfortable and effective. Intuitive signs and explanations, worth noting order and cleanliness."
,,So efficient and clean,5.0,,"Coming from London this transit system is a miracle. It’s clean, air conditioned, runs on time and doesn’t deafen you on board. There are clean toilets in all the stations and at some stations people are actually paid to smile and wave at you from the platform!!"
,,Efficient and Excellent,5.0,,"Singapore is very well connected with the MRT. The fares are reasonable, very efficient and very convenient."
,,Efficient and Clean,5.0,,"Coming from Chicago, this is amazing. Clean fast always on time and does not smell like piss. You are not allowed to drink or eat on it - at first I thought that was crazy then quickly realized it’s genius. It actually smells good. There are no homeless people sleeping and peeing on it. Its wonderful. My friends live here without a car and use it all the time. It’s great."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Simply the most efficient underground system I have experienced. spotlessly clean and orderly with no pushing and shoving
,,Perfect transport in the city,5.0,,"Very very impressive, very frequent, extremely cheap and you can get anywhere. You need to get an EZ card to use it"
,,Very comfortable!,5.0,,"Easy to travel within Singapore. quick, clean, easy to use. I suggest buying a EZ-link ticket (which is also good on buses and 7-11)."
,,Bad,1.0,,Expensive fares but can’t even provide proper air conditioning and ventilation in a packed train. Would not be surprised if anyone actually faints.
,,Best way to travel Singapore,5.0,,"Quick, clean, easy to use. I suggest buying a full day or multi day pass (which is also good on buses)."
,,Great and easy to use,5.0,,staff around at the ticket machine to help and all clearly signed. If you're a group/family it may work out cheaper in a taxi for shorter journeys though
,,Efficient mode of transportation but unfriendly passenger service at the counter,2.0,,"The train system looks a bit complicated with 5 serving lines and connection with the Light Rail Transit. However, each line is denoted by specific colour. Passengers will easily identified the lines and interchange stations without difficulty. As a tourist, I bought the standard ticket for both single and return trips. It was said that it could be used up to six times within 30 days from the date of purchase. Unfortunately it failed to work after fourth trip. Tried the three available ticketing machines to add trips but to no avail. I approached the passenger service counter for assistance. The advice was ""you have to continue your transaction at the machine"". I tried to explain the situation and difficulty encountered but the staff insisted that I had to resolve the problem by myself. This customer service was entirely unacceptable. Eventually, I bought another fresh ticket. It wasted me a lot of time and effort."
,,3 Day Unlimited travel for SG$20 is incredible!,5.0,,"We completely depended on MRT during our 10 days stay in Singapore and it was incredible. I used London Underground and Paris Metro, while they are respectable and efficient, Singapore MRT being a newly developed project was impeccable. All stations are completely air-conditioned and are a joy to transit. You must get the $30 pass for 3 days unlimited travel in the MRT and on buses, when you go back and return the pass after the 4th day, you will be given back $10."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"Excellent!well connected with bus services. Quite reasonably priced.Clean stations, Well equipped and nice staff."
,,Best transport system I’ve ever used,5.0,,"In my experience, Singapore’s MRT is one of the best transport systems in the world. A wide net of driverless underground trains that runs with high frequency and superb punctuality.

Both, stations and trains are very clean, comfortable, and refreshingly cool (Singaporeans really know how to do air conditioning).

The fares are also very cheap, particularly when compared to public transport in say England.

The best way pay for SMRT is to buy and EZ-link contactless card that can be used on trains and buses.

There are tourist EZ-link cards available that offer unlimited travel for a period of time: 1, 2 or 3 days. Not all unlimited cards are equal though and you may prefer to buy the standard tourist card at $30 for 3 days (which includes a refundable $10 deposit). Other resellers sell ‘plus’ cards at $38 and no refundable deposit making travel more expensive so it pays go do your research. Once the unlimited travel period expires, the unlimited cards may be topped up with funds like a regular EZ-link card."
,,Masses attracted,5.0,,Thai nice city comes up to us in so many ways really Small but disciplined and fortnight with everyone trying to help you
,,Effective metro system,5.0,,"Pretty faultless really. The stations are clean, well-presented, typically modern and each carriages is nicely air-conditioned.

All the time we were in Singapore, the system ran on time, even arriving earlier than predicted. We especially like the electric maps flashing up your location on the boards inside the cars.

Highly reliable and dependable service."
,,Fantastic Service,5.0,,"Very easy to use - touch screen ticket purchase by map, reusable tickets. Great value for money, a real asset and credit to Singapore."
,,Excellent Mode of Transport,5.0,,"One of the best modes of Singapore is SMRT which covers the length n breadth of Singapore...MRT Stations are very well maintained with adequate signboards..Trains come bang on time& during peak hours the services are every 2-3 minutes..No eating is permitted in MRTs..Buy a NETS Card & you can use it on Trains, Buses & for local shopping also..Never seen such an efficient Rail n Bus Services anywhere.."
,,Great public transport option,5.0,,"We only used the MRT a couple of times but we found it very easy to use, extremely cheap and highly efficient. We will definitely use it for all local travel if we visit again"
,,"Cheap, fast, efficient",5.0,,"Not more to say but a brilliant system. What all other city’s should aspire to provide. Driverless trains so no moaning drivers going on strike like London tube. Cheap, efficient and easy to understand"
,,Poor Direction,3.0,,From the new downtown line interchange to east line if ticket buy for destination will need to scan out and walk to another station. No clear direct that it has to scan out and scan in within 15 minutes causing panic for travellers. Not all staffs aware of the procedure.
,,efficient,5.0,,"clean, modern, efficient, practical, easy to access and easy to get around SG, easy access to food and markets, grocery stores, shopping malls"
,,Fast reliable service,5.0,,"I visited for four days. Instead of going for the tourist card, I purchased the standard S$5 non-refundable card and added another S$15. Excess credit can be refunded at T2, and this worked out a cheaper option than the tourist card."
,,SMART SMRT,4.0,,"It is my third trip to Singapore with my family
My brother in law is a citizen here so each time we visit him it’s like a home town to us and we make it a point to travel by metro rail
The safety features the neatness and the punctuality makes it one of the worlds best transportation services"
,,"Quick, efficient and easy to locate",5.0,,"Such a well organised, affordable and efficient system with clean carriages and easy to use swipe cards to access and use the trains."
,,MRT is Practically wise,4.0,,We are on a budget travel for a day seminar. So we took MRT from Changi Airport to Becoolen which our hotel is located- To Vivo City going to Sentosa by Monorail and back to Changi. We spent SG trip tremendously satisfying!
,,One of the best!,5.0,,"One of the easiest metros in the world. Very well planned, smooth flow and good quality and maintained equipment. Very punctual too."
,,OK,4.0,,"A little bit of guesswork when buying a ticket from the automated tellers. Also, they only accept small bills. Clean, safe, efficient, no complaints."
,,Overall it's gd,4.0,,"If u are a tourist and prefer to experience Singapore via public transportation, the Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) is the best way to go.

It has different lines which connects to almost all parts of Singapore; travelling time taking maximum 1hr.

If u like shopping, u can drop down at Orchard, Dhoby Ghaut, Somerset or City Hall via the North-South Line.
If u prefer to head to the neighbourhood; pick an estate along the North-South, East-West, Circle Line or even Downtown, and u are on the way to explore the other sides of Singapore.

Buy yr pass over at the Ticketing Counter, situated inside the major MRT stations. If u are staying longer than 4days, use the ezlink card for easy access via bus & mrt. The value can be topped-up n u can reuse the card, the nxt time u fly down to Si gapore. Definitely cheaper than taxi or pte-hire cars; and faster than using the public busses.

Although news hasnt been all gd abt the MRT systems, the organisation is really putting effort to improve. Thus the journey via MRT is still the best."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Great way to get around and as cheap as chips. Very easy to understand the routes and usually trains depart about every 5 mins.
,,WOW! - A world class model for the world to emulate,5.0,,"Where do I start? Started only in 1987, the fully automated Circle, Downtown and NE lines are now the world's longest fully automated metro network in a city/state smaller than New York City. The metro lines are clean, safe, well lit and so easy to navigate. The airport to downtown is an easy ride with a couple of changes. To get to my stops - Little India, Botanic Gardens, Marina Bay and Night Safari (Khatib) was a breeze except for for the NIght Safari where an additional Shuttle is needed. Pick up an EZ link card at the airport, load it, travel and get your deposit when you leave. The only thing is all the stops do not have the name of the main attraction at that stop. You need to do a little research, but for the ease, cost and convenience, I find it hard to beat. Well done SMRT!"
,,Super efficient electric train beats driving a car,5.0,,Singapores world class mass rapid transit is a wonderful place to rub elbows with local Singaporeans and tourists alike. It connects with the bus system very effectively to take you anywhere you want. It does take longer than a taxi or Uber but you cannot beat the value as I rode all over the island one day for less than five dollars. If you are traveling on a budget I seriously recommend investing $15 in an MRT card and you’re set for both buses and train service
,,great way to get around,5.0,,"Spent 3 days in Singapore for the first time. We got to know their metro system with ease...Lines are colour coded and trains have no drivers!

Cheap to get around .... stations are large, well lit , and very clean and safe.
Highly recommend to use....escalators and lifts everywhere."
,,Seamless,5.0,,The best transportation system. We got the tourist 3 day pass and it was worth it! Not all the stations sell them so check online first.
,,A fabulous train network,5.0,,The Singapore MRT has to surely be one of the best train networks in the world. Its a fantastic service that spans large parts of the island.
,,Clean and cheap,5.0,,"A clean, quite and cheap way to travel. With little cost you can travel almost anywhere in Singapore."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"The MRT was our primary mode of transportation in Singapore. In fact it is used by most of the tourists and why not! It is cheap, saves team and serves well. We had to buy an MRT card of S$12, which came with a pre-loaded balance of S$7. The rest is the cost of the card. The fares were pretty reasonable when we visited. We stayed near Chinatown and for less than a couple of dollars we could reach the Marina Bay Area. Per our observation, one can reach the last from the first stop in just 45 minutes of time. The MRT is always on time and quite clean and organised. It’s a no brainer. No point throwing money on taxis unless one has a lot of money to burn. The card can also be used to travel in buses. Go for it!"
,,Safe convenient and fast,5.0,,It's the most convenient way to travel in Singapore. We used this extensively. $12 card with $7 travel value can be taken in start which can be topped up. Same can be used in busses as well
,,Efficient clean professional punctual,5.0,,Best way around Singapore and not very expensive. Just have a Ez-link card and top up as required. You can get a refund of the remaining balance at the end of your stay and retain the card for keepsakes!

,,So convenient!,5.0,,"Although we had hired a driver for our trip, we spent a day taking the SMRT. Very convenient. Great city planning."
,,Navigating Singapore’s Underground,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is really different to anything that I’ve seen before. The trains come in behind a wall and double doors open up for you to get on the train. Like Melbourne trains they have one continuous carriage with heaps of standing room. Learning something new about using public transport to get around every time I travel away from Sydney. I often Google directions and then take the transport option to work out closest stations, whether to the walk or bus to my destination. Ticket machines are easy to use and are at every station. You can buy multi day passes or single and return tickets. For the ticket machine you need coins and $5 notes or you can use a credit card. There are handy maps available everywhere and the staff always seem to be on hand and are really helpful. One you know the colour of your line you just need to know the direction of your travel so usually the stations at either end of the line. Trains come every few minutes so no need for a timetable."
,,Cheap and easy access to aiport,4.0,,Very comfortable and accurate time of arrival and departure of the mrt. Waiting time is less than 4mins Need to arrange schedule to avaoid many peoples during peak time especially working hours day time.
,,London Eat your Heart Out,5.0,,"I've never seen a underground system so well run, trains ( British Made ) Spotlessly clean, run on time, and my wife said she would not hesitate to travel alone,"
,,"Cheap, clean and easy",5.0,,"Super cheap and easy to navigate. lots of stops. Like the rest of the city, extremely clean. AC was nice on a hot May day"
,,The best there is,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is fast, clean and a very comprehensive network. It’s the best way to get around in the city and there are so many lines. If the MRT won’t get you to where you need to go a bus will. It’s rare that I need to take a taxi in Singapore. Irs super cheap too, which isn’t something that you often hear said in this part of the world."
,,Easy orientation and handling,4.0,,"Really easy to navigate yourself through the city. Lots of explanations everywhere and ticket machine is easy to operate. Timing is good, accessibility too. But we tried to not use it during peak times in the morning or afternoon."
,,Clean as a whistle,5.0,,Great train ride to Zoo. Singapores MRT is fairly easy to use and such a joy to ride in clean comfort.
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,Recently spent four days in Singapore used the MRT on a tourist pass .$30 with $10 card refund . Spotlessly clean easy to use air conditioned . Great way to move around Singapore .
,,Probably the finest,5.0,,"Been to around 30 countries, but Singapore always amazes. It is incredible a to what this country has achieved in such a short span of time. And SMRT is a testimony to the excellence that Singapore has achieved."
,,Making a difference,5.0,,"Singapore amass Rapid Transit (speed train) is making a difference in easing mov meant of people in Singapore. It covers all corners of the country, and is timely, very clean and quiet. Occasionally it may be crowded during peak hours but one would feel very comfortable. It is also very highly subsidized, and where it doesn't get you to the doorstep, the buses or private taxis will do."
,,Best Metropolitan Subway System in the World,5.0,,"Clean, fast, reliable - just perfect. No where in the world you will experience such a top level of lightrail city service. Combines with the great bus system or by now all the rental bikes, no need for an own car."
,,Wonderful system,5.0,,"We bought the one-day tourist pass (turn it in when you're done and get 10SG back) and used it to start exploring the city. It's easy to navigate, trains and stations are clean."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Just returned from a 7 day stay in Singapore. Purchased the MRT card in the 7 Eleven (don’t buy the tourist one but the normal one that the locals use). For 7 days we put $20 on the card and we never used it all. The journeys are very cheap starting at $0.77 and even a fairly long journey will probably not cost anymore than $1.80. The MRT is easy to use, the stations are practically everywhere and they are very safe and clean. Just check on the map at the station which way you are heading it’s pretty easy. You can also use your card on the Buses too but the MRT is way quicker."
,,"Easy, fast, inexpensive",5.0,,Very easy to use & goes everywhere. Nice and cool on the trains too. Be careful and don't eat or drink while riding. Buy a ticket at the machine & if you don't have enough fare pay as you exit
,,Clean and so easy to get around!,5.0,,The trains are so spotless that one could practically eat off the floors. Everything is well marked. It's so easy to get around on the MRT.
,,Very Useful,4.0,,"If it’s your first time to Singapore then you have to use the MRT. It’s very convenient in going around the city and a nice alternative to taking the bus. The stations are well airconditioned and nost of the staff are very helpful and can speak basic english. The railway transit can take some time to get used to but once you figure out the system, you’ll find that it’s very convenient."
,,Very efficient and best way to get around SG,5.0,,"The best and convenient way to get around Singapore. Very easy to navigate with colour coded track lines on the maps and clear signs and indicators. Best way to get around Singapore, very clean and there is usually hawker centre/shops at the stations."
,,Wow,5.0,,Easy and cheap. A must do when visiting Singapore. The Hippo bus is good but MRT more cost effective.
,,Easy transport,5.0,,"Singapore has one of the best transport system in the world. Very on time, neat and easy access, even during rush hour. As a tourist, I don't have a hard time travelling with the train."
,,Connectivity & Waiting Time,5.0,,"I was highly impressed by MRT system, connects to every corner of Singapore with literally very low waiting time & reasonable cost."
,,Getting around on the MRT was a great experience .,5.0,,"We bought a 2 day travel card ,had to que up for awhile due to a heap of European tourists .You can buy a card for 3 days ,these are available from major stations & airport and you will need to return to where purchased to obtain the refund for the card . The escalators are the fastest I have been on so be careful. The stations in the city are deep under ground and often come out in the most amazing places like shopping centres and food halls. We used the card to travel on the buses as well and just enjoyed seeing other parts of the old city above ground."
,,Way to go around Singapore.,5.0,,This mass transit is very easy to go around town with and cost is very low. Staff is very helpful in giving directions and helping with the purchase of tickets.
,,Metro Service Singapore,5.0,,"Had a very short trip today, train frequency was awesome and cleanliness in this area is unbelievable."
,,Perfect Public Transport,5.0,,"Nothing to say. Typical Singapore. Clean, on time and the best way to travel except walking. You can't get around easier."

,,Very efficient,5.0,,"The trains are fast, efficient, reliable, and clean. Underground feels safe and clean. All very easy"
,,Fast and cheap.,5.0,,We purchased a three day Tourist pass which was valid on the MRT and the bus system within the city. Just clock on and clock off. Go anywhere you wish.
,,Most efficient,5.0,,Very comfortable and accessible transportation that will enable you to reach city center as well as other parts
,,Wish Melbourne had the same system!,5.0,,"Absolutely brilliant transport system in Singapore. Buy your travel cards, look at the wall maps and take off anywhere. Efficient, reliable and very clean"
,,What can be more comfortable than MRT!,5.0,,The MRT in singapore is as good as any where else in the world. Fastest and the cheapest means of transport. Just loved it!
,,Boy could Australia take a lesson!,5.0,,"OMG! How good is the transport in Singapore??? We were fortunate to be staying with friends so they lent us some spare travel cards they keep for guests. We just topped up prior to departure. We were in Singapore for 7 days and travelled everyday, multiple trips, buses and trains, and used approx. $20 each. Our most expensive trip was $1.70. And because we travelled as often as we did daily we received discounts! he many public transport operators in Australia could learn a thing a two. Quick, quiet, efficient. Never waited longer than 6 minutes! Totally awesome. Work it out before you leave home. Download the apps and away you go!"
,,Very efficent form of travel,5.0,,"Travelled on the MRT when in Singapore last week. Very efficient, easy to use. Go to the map on the wall and work out which line you want to take then go to the ticket machine and it was very easy to use. There is a staff member wandering around if you do need help. Very fast and clean and very well signposted so we didn't have any problems finding which line to use."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Our experience with MRT was great. The transportation is efficient, on time and pretty easy to go around with. The train is very clean too and we relied a lot on MRT during our trip in Singapore."
,,The easiest and the best method to travel in Singapore,4.0,,"Despite protests from family members we somehow boarded the MRT ... and rest was absolute beauty. The comfort, the signboards and announcements made all apprehensions disappear and all were looking forward for the next travel."
,,Best transport,5.0,,"It is so convenient to travel by SMRT in Singapore. You can explore the whole Singapore easily. Excellent service, clean and safe cabin."
,,Amazing service,5.0,,"This time we wanted to explore Singapore on our own. SMRT was of great help. We could move around very easily. Services were swift, on time not much crowded. Even during rush hour we could travel easily. Everything was so properly displayed, we need not ask anyone about anything.

We used tourist pass, it was very useful. We could use it for bus service also."
,,Go for it!,5.0,,"The MRT is smart, incredibly user friendly, clean, safe, efficient, and a credit to Singapore as a whole. Trains every 8 minutes or so, fares are something like 4/5 Sing Dollars return for most journeys. Grab a little map at the station, and the whole of Singapore opens up, for fast, cheap, comfortable travel. Just go for it!"
,,A great way to get around,5.0,,Taxis are cheap in Singapore but the MRT is probably the best way to get around. The services are reliable and run like clockwork. We did not have to wait more than 5 minutes for any train - more often than not the wait was only 1 or 2 minutes. A 3 day pass for tourists costs $30 for unlimited MRT and bus transport and you get back $10 deposit on the card. Trains are exceptionally clean but can get crowded at peak hour.
,,Helpful innovations,4.0,,"5 years ago they used lights to track of your trip. Now they have screens to show the next station and track your trip as well. These are helpful innovations to help tourist go around Singapore. As usual, the trains were clean and orderly, though you may not want to get a ride during rush hours to avoid the cramped trains. Though the trips are short and you stay inside the trains for a short period only, it would be hard if you just came from shopping and carry a load of shopping bags with you."
,,Getting fast around whole city,5.0,,"Subway is one of the best I've ever riden. Gets you from one side of town to another so fast, even during rush hour. Stations spread in most important spots of the city, so no need to walk too far if you are in hurry."
,,Speedy,4.0,,"Always can relied on MRT speed and efficiency. Used the North East line and Circle line frequently. Generally, pleased with the orderliness of commuters"
,,impressive,5.0,,taxi and grab is really expensive in singapore especially at night but metro is awesome. cheap. roaming around using the metro itself is an adventure. spotting my next place to visit and use the metro to get their. wonderful. its clean. fast and on time

People are very friendly ….. even elderly male passengers will offer seat to much younger female passengers. Very impressed!!"

,,easy convenient option for getting around,5.0,,easy convenient option for getting around. There are lots of places to see and the SMRT is one way to get there!
,,Superb,5.0,,"Other countries take note... THIS IS HOW IT’S DONE!

clean, easy to navigate and gets everywhere.

Choose from either the tourist ticket, which is S$30 (10 refundable) or get the standard ticket that can be added to each time, which we did, so don’t throw away the ticket, as you get refunds on the 3rd and 6th trip ( 6th trip is maximum you can do ) Cheap, easy and affordable."
,,An efficient mass transit system in Singapore,5.0,,Fast clean and efficient. Too bad there are not many stations as the system is much iriented towards car and bus.
,,Super Public Transport,5.0,,"When in Singapore use the MRT, no taxi required. It can take you from any point to any point in minimum time and price."
,,Best and cheapest way of getting round Singapore!,5.0,,"Unless you're travelling in groups, the MRT is your best bet at getting around Singapore. Its very easy to understand, and if you need help, there are help desks at every station."
,,Travelling with comfort,5.0,,Every trip has a budget and MRT does a great job of subsidizing your travelling cost and also gives you speedy access as it is quite well connected.
,,Super clean metro!,5.0,,So clean and efficient! Also a very friendly staff to assist in your adventures! Very reasonable rates and service throughout the whole city.
,,Almost Flawless with one jarring fault,5.0,,"I had heard about the Singaporean MRT system from several friends and on first impression it is fast, clean, very regular, and very cheap. We bought the Ezy Link card at the airport and had to top it up a few times during our 2 day/3 night stay, which is all very easy and straightforward. If you've used Metro systems in other big cities like Tokyo, Paris or New York, it's all very familiar. Perhaps our only complaint was that unfortunately we weren't able to use it to get back to the airport on our final day... with an 8AM flight, the earliest train would only have gotten us to the airport with an hour to spare which we felt was cutting it a bit fine given we weren't familiar with the Airport at the time so we begrudgingly caught a taxi. I would have thought in a big city like Singapore that the Metro would run 24*7, but I guess you can't have everything!"
,,Safe and comfortable travel,5.0,,"Safe, cheap and comfortable travel. Very clear instruction given in all the stations. Trains are pretty clean"
,,So easy to use and cheap compared to taxis,5.0,,I’d recommend using the mrt to get around it is cheap and so easy to use. Average ticket cost for one way is s$1.50 . I used it to go everywhere and it was great
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"Easy to use efficient underground system and buses. Bought a 3 day pass for about $10 a day, but it is so cheap I didn't need to spend that much. Went to all of the sights without a glitch."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Great public transport system , very clean , safe day and night . Get a 3 day tourist travel card for unlimited travel ."
,,Fantastic public transport,5.0,,"We went from Vivo shopping centre to China Town and Bugis Street. Easy to use, clean and quick. No long wait periods. Cheap transport, the staff at the train stations were great."
,,best way to commute,5.0,,if you are solo or couple. its the best to commute. its easy and fast. exits and entry are at the major shopping centers
,,Wonderful and Cheap!,5.0,,"We took MRT from Changi Airport to Bugis MRT Station. We bought the refillable MRT card at the airport. The staff are friendly and helpful. The trains are modern, nice, and clean. The signs are clear and easy to understand. The fares are cheap. It costs about $1.75 from the airport. We took MRT to attractions in Singapore. The buses are also good."
,,Changi Airport to city by SMRT,5.0,,"Easy to commute by, frequent schedules, great connectivity but just make sure to have more change in currency coins for your tickets if you dont have a monthly pass as the ticket vending machine only accepts small change currencies."
,,Convenient and Reliable,5.0,,"I am always amazed at Singapore’s MRT. Very convenient and reliable. You can use a single reloadable card for both the MRT and the bus. And if you take the bus within 30 minutes of hopping off the train, the bus fare is free. The SMRT can take you anywhere in Singapore and gives you a glimpse of the city, downtown and the suburbs. This is my preferred transport when I am in Singapore. It makes me feel connected to the people and makes me feel like one of the locals."
,,Daily travel!,5.0,,I enjoy daily travelling in MRT because it is on time and clean. It is spread across length & breadth of singapore so easy to travel using mrt
,,Comfortable and rapid espcially in rush hours,5.0,,The best thing about it is the help disk that has very helpful officers. It is also extended to almost every place in Singapore. You only need a good explanation of its map from the officer at the help disk and you will be using it as locals.
,,Convenience,5.0,,One card that works on all metro and bus routes and also monorail...... Convenience at the best..... Recommended is downloading metro and bus routes
,,Efficient and reliable.,5.0,,"A much preferred way of going around town. It is efficient, reliable and economical. Comfortable but could get really crowded during rush hour. Easy to use because English is included as a medium in all announcements and instruction. EZ link card helps a lot and top up machines are accessible in all stations. Highly recommend it with the bus system instead of taking taxi."
,,Amazing. Excellent.,5.0,,Singapore have an amazing SMRT system - making it so easy to get around the city very easily. Unlike Tokyo (which is quite complex) the SMRT is easy to master. Absolutely the best way to get around.
,,Convenience,5.0,,"已经参观了新加坡几次，但第一次乘坐地铁，因为酒店距离世博会和世博会非常近，所以在早上乘坐出租车很困难。 所以我第一次尝试了，接下来的几天我总是坐Metro。
一旦你认识到电台对谷歌地图的意义，许多线路。 它几乎可以到达新加坡的任何地方。 地理位置上新加坡没有那么大，所以地铁非常方便地到达各个角落。 有些车站有重叠，所以你必须考虑采取哪条线路更近，因为大多数线路在城市内以不同的方向盘旋。 你会知道你什么时候看到路线图。
一旦你捕捉并理解地图，你将采取最佳路线到达目的地。
Visited Singapore couple times already, but first time to take Metro as the hotel is so close to it between and also the EXPO, it's quite difficult to get Taxi during the morning time. So i tried my first time, and the following days i always take Metro.
Many lines, once you recognized the meaning of the station vs the Google map. It almost access to everywhere in Singapore. Geographically Singapore is not so big, so metro is very convenience to access every corners. Some of the stations has overlapped, so you have to consider to take which line will be closer, as most of the lines are circling inside the city with different directions. You will know when you see the route maps.
Once you catch and understand the map, you will take the best route to get to your destination."
,,Very good,5.0,,So easy to go around in Singapore with MRT. We can use EZ link card to pay MRT ticket. We can also use the card for busses and convenience store
,,Great way to et around Singapore,5.0,,Fast cheap and efficient. We had no trouble navigating the system and used it to travel to and from the airport with no fuss
,,One of the best,5.0,,It is well connected and user friendly. Easy access through out the route. The bus terminals are also very accessible.
,,No need to rate this service - It is immaculate,5.0,,"On dot, spic and span, helpful co-passengers, plenty of sign boards and easy to understand guidelines. Small city still we need to appreciate the comforts they provide"
,,Highly efficient,5.0,,"Very easy to use transport system. Clean, seats and standing available. I would advise that if you are a tourist that you buy a tourist pass so you can just ""tap and go""."
,,Save yourself from Asian taxi drivers,4.0,,Singapore SMRT can take you just about anywhere in Singapore in clean air condition comfort. Top up a tap and go card with $20 and you would be lucky to send $5-6 a day zipping around Singapore. If you have to walk more than 250mtrs to a station or wait more than 5mins for a train would might be entitled to have a little complain... just a little one! Beats the taxis hands down
,,Timely and cost effective,5.0,,"Excellent coverage. Just figure out the interchange stations, and you will be able to go to almost all parts of Singapore. The frequency of the trains is just amazing and full marks to the safety and neatness."
,,Great way to get around in Singapore,5.0,,"Get a Ezi card and put ten dollars on the card. This is the best way to around town. You can catch Trains or buses with your card. Just tap on and off.

Once you work out where you are going, it’s very easy to get there using the SMRT. Our hotel was 5mins from Somerset Station, so we went on the subway as much as possible. We had to top up our cards a couple of times, but when it cost 77cents to get to most places, we really didn’t care if you went a little way or not."
,,Ageing system,2.0,,"Reliability has been a serious issue in today's Singapore MRT and it's very apparent. Delay is normal. It can be due to larger volume of passenger the system has not catered for during design stage, i.e. platform of existing stations cannot be extended. Carriage train car has stained flooring, spoiled air con, spoiled lighting, loud track noise, malfunction route indicator that are common and can be experienced everyday.
The system could be world class 20 years ago but continuous substandard maintenance and poor management from top level has relegated the system to an very average transport system. It will take much more effort to restore this broken system to the past glory now."
,,great transport,5.0,,"took train to Sedona, efficient rail system. Train on time and good ticketing system. Staff were friendly and helpful"
,,Great system,5.0,,"We have been to Singapore several times & always use the MRT to get around. It is so easy to use, efficient, minimal waiting time for trains & cost efficient. I wish we had a system like this here."
,,One of the Best Transport Systems I've Encountered,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is by far one of the best public transport systems I've encountered on my travels. It was quick and easy to use, very clean and took us everywhere we wanted to go with ease. We also felt very safe travelling here. They have a 1, 2 or 3 day tourist pass which is the way to go if you intend to use the MRT during your stay. You do get a refund of $10 if you return the pass once you're finished."
,,Smooth and budget friendly,4.0,,"Fit the visitors this MRT is the cheapest and quickest mode of the otherwise expensive mode of transport in Singapore.
It has many lines and people must take the snapshot of the lines it has to avoid last minute hassle. It's almost full and you may rarely find place to seat - but people are very very generous to offer you seat if you are a lady, pregnant, carrying a child or OLD. So do not worry."
,,THE BEST,5.0,,"Singapore is blessed with fantastic MRT. Like so many things, you only know how good it is when you see what other cities have. So many Singaporeans should see what others have and they would tank the government every day.
Clean
Cheap
Efficient
Extensive
One more reason why this Singapore is such a great city to live in"
,,Always breakdown,1.0,,The management needs seriously review of the entire system and service it regularly to prevent often breakdown during morning peak hours to work.
,,Public transport,5.0,,"No better way to get around the island cheaply, efficiently, and in comfort. The trains are clean and air-conditioned."
,,"Clean, efficient, and comfortable.",5.0,,"I ride the Boston T every day, this is so much nicer. It is clean, stations are incredibly well maintained. The signs tell you where to get off (which side-useful on a crowded train). Well lit, no delays. This is how it should be! Definitely standard setting. Remember to ""tap out"" on the way out too, charged by distance not flat fee. Same for buses."
,,Cleanest public transport ever!,5.0,,Good coverage easy to navigate. Best way to get around Singapore. Very reasonably priced. Buy an MRT card and load 10$ on to it (a minimum of 3 is required at all times)
,,Easy and Efficient,5.0,,"Excellent transport system with easy to follow instructions on how to get around station and to get to the trains. No delays and no massive queues, although we did not travel at peak time. Maps are available to check where you are and whats close by.
Once in the train each stop is easily detected overhead with led light signs.
We would thoroughly recommend using this system as it saves a lot of time and it's reliable."
,,Best rail system ever,5.0,,"Forget the Metro, this is the best rail system ever. Colour coded and so easy to figure out where to go and how to get there. It is cheap, fast and very clean. Even very safe to travel alone on at night"

,,Efficient transport,5.0,,Very efficient mass transport system. Easy to access and reasonably priced. Worthwhile to get hold of the passes or tourist pass as the trips are cheaper than if you buy individual tickets. The trains come quite frequently.

,,If only we had the SMRT in Australia,5.0,,"Clean, reliable, cheap, easy to follow maps and they're probably going where (or very close) to where you want to be. The underground network also has a myriad of shops and eateries - it's where the locals eat."
,,Easy to use.,5.0,,"As a large family travelling around, this was the most cost effective way for us. Once we had purchased our tourist pass from Chinatown, we were on and off all trip. Very easy to navigate and not busy at all."
,,What a transport system should be.,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, comprehensive. Cheap as (at least compared with others). Awesome. The number of 5* reviews says it all."
,,Efficient transport system,4.0,,Easy to go around. Se an ezlink for access. Easy to reload stored values. Clean stations. Safe and sound. I recommend this transportation system. Not so crowded during rush hours.
,,The best mode of transportation while in Singapore,5.0,,Could not have been better ... Takes you anywhere and everywhere ... Very very comfortable... The shortest and cheapest way of commuting within Singapore...
,,Wonderful Ride,5.0,,The SMRT is a massive transit with interconnections throughout most of Singapore. Just read and follow the signs and you will exit right where you need to go. So amazed that it stops at Changi airport and you can go directly to the airport terminal you need to be in.
,,Very organized,4.0,,"We got around the city mostly by MRT. At first, we bought the EZ link cards, but looking back, it would have been better to get the standard ticket and just pay for the trips as we go along. However, the standard tickets cannot be used on the buses, which we used twice. Either way, the trains are very on time and the subway system is very organized. However, there were occasions when there are individuals who would sit on the floor of the MRT or those who did not give up their seat for those who needed it more and there are some (unavoidable) rowdy individuals as well that made the ride quite irritating. The lines are a little disorganized, wherein, people do not really like to wait in line, rather, they would cut in while going up the escalator. Otherwise, the MRT system made our trip much easier."
,,Trip on The MRT. MASS RAPID TRANSIT.,5.0,,"Singapore 's underground and sometimes above ground train service is generally very good. It carries thousands daily, usually on time. However it is not always perfect and will break down on occasions. However busses will be provide to help commuters. I have never encountered a breakdown."
,,Excellent,5.0,,SMRT is very neat and tidy. The stations are well connected and once the passengers understand the red/yellow/green lines it would be very easy.
,,Brilliant network,5.0,,"The transport is so well maintained and systematic. Everywhere there is transit with bus, and even steamer. Neat and clean, automatically driven trains and automatic doors in platform. Very fast and eases traffic congestion."
,,An average metro but with good connectivity,4.0,,Buy ezlink card and zip through Singapore in MRT and buses. All maintained well but nothing to call out as great. Its a great means to move around and cut costs plus travel time.
,,Super Convenient,5.0,,"In Singapore MRT are really convenient, you can go anywhere you want.. The fee is reasonable, not expensive. Even from Changi to Marina Bay Sand."
,,Easy transport to interpret,5.0,,Easy to interpret. Easy to use. Never got lost. A good network that takes you to all the interesting corners of a Singapore. Great value for money. Trains are frequent - never more than 4 min wait.
,,So Easy,5.0,,"This subway system is super easy to use. There are various ticket types but we a 3 day pass for convenience. Check the maps posted everywhere & explore the island. Also, they are spotless"

,,"Clean, cheap, efficient and easy to get around on.",2.0,,"Really cheap way of getting around Singapore - plenty of staff and locals around to help if you need direction. Trains are on time, clean and cool and a really fantastic way of getting out amongst locals in their day to day lives."
,,Great option to travel to destinations quickly,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to travel around Singapore - reasonable and fast as well as very clean. There is a good network that take you to shopping centres, attractions etc. Beats travelling in taxis and getting stuck in traffic as well as getting ripped off by some of the dishonest taxi drivers!"

,,So convenient!,5.0,,"It is a very convenient system all over singapore: the buses and the MRT. The MRT stations are very good, you will always find lifts for carrying baby strollers/ wheelchairs. If you have a baby/toddler/preschooler with you, there is no problem at all!"
,,The most efficient mode of transportation in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is easily the most efficient and inexpensive mode of commute in town. It covers the length and breadth of the city taking you almost everywhere you need to go. The trains are clean and are almost always on schedule. They also run at frequent intervals so the wait time is generally only about 2-5 mins. There are also clear markings on the seats for the disabled and elderly as well as signs and a board for the upcoming stations.

The commute is also inexpensive. There are three kinds of tickets.
1. Standard ticket - As the name suggests, a one time ticket for a single one way journey. Costs anywhere between 0.5 - 3.5 SGD depending on the distance.

2. EZ-link card - The most popular among locals in Singapore. It costs 12 SGD upfront to purchase the card (5 SGD admin fee and 7 SGD card value) and can be used to use the SMRT as many times as you want. It helps to avoid standing at ticketing queues and you can top up the card at the numerous machines available at each station. The price is about 25% less than the price of a standard ticket. as an added advantage, also works in buses.

3. Singapore tourist pass - A popular option among tourist staying in Singapore upto 5 days. The tourist pass is available in 3 variants.
* A one day pass is available at 10 SGD.
* A two day pass is available at 15 SGD.
* A three day pass is available at 20 SGD.
The tourist pass can be used to travel Singapore for the duration of the pass without having to pay anything else. There is also a 10 SGD refundable deposit to be paid upfront that can be claimed within 5 days of the expiration of the pass. The only disadvantage of the tourist pass is that it can be purchased only at certain stations. The problem exists when redeeming the deposit. Unless you're leaving Singapore via the airport (where the pass is sold), you should check the list of places where it is sold so you can plan to redeem the pass before leaving.

All in all, if you're travelling to Singapore, SMRT should by all means be your preferred mode of transport. It is a cut above the rest in every sense."
,,Good network it covers all over Singapore,3.0,,Met is the best and cheapest way for transportation in Singapore. They are a bit confusing but mostly people are helpful in showing correct direction
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"The transport system is terrific! We purchased a Singapore Tourist Pass for 3 days for $20 with a $10 refundable deposit. This gave us 3 days of unlimited travel on trains and buses. The trains all run every 5 minutes. There are different lines and the maps easily show you routes and stations. We were able to navigate our way around easily and if we weren't sure about something, we asked a station attendant who were always more than willing to help."
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,"All public transport, as well as taxis ,is cheap in Singapore. MRT is clean and quick as well .Everything is clearly signposted, maps easy to follow and the purchase of tickets easy. Trains are air conditioned and clean. There are information desks if you need help."
,,Amazing - public transport can be a positive experience,5.0,,"Singapore MRT system is a text book example of a problem bloc transportation system that works. So many other major cities should study what Singapore has done and copy it back home. It runs smoothly , covers the greater Singapore area, cars a clean and safe and to add icing to the cake; it’s cheap ! I am a huge fan !!"
,,Excellent service in Singapore Transport,5.0,,"Public transportation is amazing in Singapore. Subway and buses are clean, comfortable, on time service. Very good and cheap option to use in Singapore for locals, tourist and business travels."
,,"Clean, frequent pleasurable way to travel.",5.0,,"Using prepaid cards made for easy transit of the city in pristine trains. Signage excellent, so getting lost very unlikely! Cheap too and safe."
,,MRT is not well organized for transfers,2.0,,the SMRT is not convenient for people who need to transfer to different line . You have to go upstairs and walk quite far away to change to your needed line . this is not efficient compared to Hong Kong or Taipei system
,,My preferred metro globally,5.0,,"It is the best metro I have ever taken. It is clean, easy to understand, efficient. It is even easy to buy tickets from the machine"
,,Amazing system,5.0,,"We bought Tourist Passes and travelled to Punggol on the MRT. We caught the light rail for one circuit of part of that amazing region. After lunch in a cafe in Waterway Plaza (right next to the station) we went by bus to see more of the surrounding country. Another train ride and we were back to our hotel.

This amazing service is a great way to see out of the way places in Singapore."
,,fast and efficient,4.0,,"this is a very good way to get around Singapore I recommend getting a tourist pass for either 1 ,2 or 3 day pass which you can hop on and off the buses mrt and light rail for as much as you want They cost $10 $16 and $ 20 with a $10 deposit which is refunded when you return the card but you can only buy them at certain stations so check it out first
If you don't get a pass then be warned you need change as they don't take any notes over $2"
,,"Quick, easy & inexpensive way to travel to most parts of Singapore.",4.0,,"I always choose to stay in a hotel close to a MRT. station to be able to travel to any part of the island. I have an ez-link card which enables me to travel on buses as well as MRT. The stations have ticket & recharge machines, maps & directions, all handily placed & directions in & exits out. If in doubt ask a local they are all very polite, friendly & helpful. Certain seats are reserved for elderly, infirm, pregnant,& very young. Passengers will often give up their seats for someone more deserving. The system is very clean & tidy,fast & efficient. No food or is allowed on the train & there are no toilets on the trains or in the operating system, although toilets are in most stations before entering past the ticket machines. Tip... carry a map of MRT. with you to help with directions & interchanges."
,,Great Service,5.0,,Singapore Metro is spread all over and is timely and well maintained... It is covering practically all location
,,fast and faster,5.0,,"Wonderful ride to wherever! We used the SMRT to go just about everywhere. The staff are just so helpful if you get a bit mixed up and a couple of times we took the wrong train but enjoyed the trip and saw a different destination to what we intended. Staff soon sorted us out and saw us aboard the train where we intending to take. Nie and clean, fast and cool...wish we had same in Perth WA."
,,Unbelievable public transport system!,5.0,,"We decided to take a train from Changi International Airport to our hotel and boy oh boy, what a great trip in itself!
We had to make 2 changes and take 3 trains in total. We 1st went from Changi to Tanah Merah, where as soon as we got off the train and crossed to the next platform, a train was waiting to take us to City Hall, where agin, we changed platforms and got on a train that was waiting and we then made our way to Orchard. The travel and trasit was seamless, very clean and very quick. No waiting time whatsoever! we did the return trip to the airport in the morning as we were leaving during peak hour and apparently the road traffic can get a bit heavy. The travel back to the airport was the same, apart from maybe a 3 minute wait at Tanah Merah.
The cost of the return trip for 2 adults and a little one aged 4 cost us........wait for it........about $10aud! Compare this to a taxi that could have cost us $40aud each way!
As the SMRT is so vast I would recommend anyone in Singapore to give this a go.
The carriages are clean, open and the rides are pretty quick.
People saw that we were heaving a heavy case and were willing to give up seats for not only me carrying the case, but for my wife and daughter also, Well played to the travelling public of Singapore, well played."
,,Easy to use,4.0,,I love trains and the family found it easy. Can buy a ticket that recharges 6 times and saves 10 c. A pain changing trains with a pram ( finding lifts) but no different than any other major city. We took the red line around the island and into the ‘suburbs’ for $3.40. Easy to navigate.
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,Used the MRT to most places in Singapore. Trains are clean and on schedule. Easy to navigate yourself in the stations which is great for 1st time users of the MRT

,,Efficient clean and inexpensive way to travel round Singapore.,5.0,,We bought a 2 day tourist pass and used the subway a lot. Nice and cool with air conditioning. The only slight snag is you can only buy tourist tickets at certain stations.If we were staying longer we would have bought a longer duration pass.

We were impressed at the cleanliness on all the trains, the local passengers were great they helped us with information and always polite, many other countries could learn a lot from this country. We loved the respect that we observed from the people they treated everyone with such humility, which is rare in this day and age. Would highly recommend travelling on the SMRT."
,,Excellent Mass Transport,5.0,,Singapore has an excellent mass transport system so I gotta try it. The system is easy to learn. Pricey compared to our country's mass transport. Very reliable and comfortable journey. While on the train I also enjoyed the view of Singapore.

,,Tourist Pass is GR8,5.0,,"We got unlimited use of bus & MRT for 3 days for $30S with $5S refunded when we returned the card. Bus was right in front of IBIS Bencoolen, MRT station 1.5 block away and a major hub (forgot the name) a 10 min walk. We went to Marina Sands, Chinatown,
Garden by the Bay lights one night, and more. Some time, we just rode the bus to the end and got another to see various areas of the city.
Wish we had good public transport in areas around San Diego!"
,,Super transit,5.0,,I took the transit to a location I had business at and the price 1.40 SGD on each bus. It's cheaper if you buy a pass for longer stays. I was at my location in no time. The buses are super clean double decker buses and run constantly throughout the day. No long waits. Great value and fast transit.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,We are both in our 70s and found the use of the MRT easy. The amount of local that were so happy to assist when were looking a tad bewildered was amazing.
,,Easy riding,5.0,,"Easy riding all over the city. Purchase a card, add credit and away you go! Quick, efficient transport."
,,Super efficient getting about in Singapore,5.0,,"Love this transport system. Trains are spotless ontime safe and efficient. Had pre-paid transport from our cruise ship to the airport so did the early check-in (BA first class is open all day. Some airlines offer same facility for Business Class). Otherwise use the excellent left luggage facility. Then we hopped back on the train straight back to Clarke Quay for a walk and lunch before train back to Changi. All for a couple of Singapore dollars. Superb value. Local commuters, by the way, are immensely helpful if you’re not sure where to jump off. Such an easy way to navigate the City."
,,"Well connected, easy to navigate, excellent ticket office services",5.0,,Very good metro and bus system which is very well connected. Very easy to understand the maps and navigate. The stations are very user friendly

,,Quick travel,5.0,,"It never ceases to amaze me when we go to Singapore how advanced their public transport is. The MRT, is quick & easy to use. We don’t bother with Taxis any more"
,,Great way to get around the island,4.0,,"SMRT is the smart way to move around Singapore especially if you buy their daily tourist tickets. Sure, it can get crowded at times but people are generally polite and the trains themselves are clean and punctual."
,,My lifeline...,5.0,,It was truly my lifeline for the days that I stayed in Singapore. Cheaper and faster with many lines to help to get to your desired place without any hassle.
,,Crowded,4.0,,SMRT is very good if you want to get from one place to another quickly. It is very crowded and not preferable during peak hours.
,,Well organised MRT,4.0,,"Singapore mrt is well organised system, which is heart of singapore. Very safe . Well maintained . Very timely, but some of Mrt lacking toilet facalities."
,,"Rated ""Transport of Choice for the Budget Traveler"" 2 years in a row!",5.0,,"I'm the one who rated it for that. I'm the budget traveler. And I just happened to come here two years in a row. (o_o) Did I make up a fake award? Yes. Does this train deserve to receive this fake award based on how quickly and inexpensively it brings you to your destination? Absolutely. Have you stopped reading the review at this point? Probably. Regardless, I still plan on awarding this train more fake awards for their classy service. Too bad I wasn't able to bring my durians aboard."
,,Inexpensive way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,Inexpensive way to get around Singapore. You can pick it up at the airport and get anywhere in the entire city. Lines are color coded and easy to follow. All signs are in English (a plus if that's your language). Fares are reasonable. All the stations are safe and so very clean!!! No gum or food allowed.
,,Metro bliss singapore,5.0,,Best connectivity in singapore well connected with malls atleast one of its exit....well guided maps at every station with ticket vending machines. One can buy travel pass and explore entire singapore. .
,,Well connected,5.0,,Fast and convenient. Well connected most of the places in Singapore. A fair bit of walking still needed transferring between lines tho.
,,SMRT,5.0,,Best Transport system in the world. So convenient and easy ans good frequency of buses. Neat and clean and easy accessible across the city.
,,EZ-link may not be a good value,3.0,,"I was in Singapore for a week, so I got a regular EZ-innk pass. It cost SG$12,, with value of SG$7 for rides plus SG$5 for a nonrefundable deposit.

The advantage is that rides are cheaper with the pass, as little as 77 cents, compared to the minimum $1.50 for a single cash ride.

The disadvantage is that you need at least $3 to start a ride, so it would not let me on when I onlyu had $2.50 left. It would not let me add less than $10. Since I only had one more day and only needed two more rides, I opted to buy individual rides.

There is a 1/2/3-day Tourist Pass, but I was attending meetings and only needed it for a few trips a day, so this did not seem economical."
,,It’s MASS and it’s RAPID,5.0,,"I’ve never seen a better, quicker, more efficient & well named transport service anywhere in the world. It’s cheap ($10/day), spotless and most stations are within a shopping centre...maybe that’s not so good 😐"
,,Don't hesitate to use the MRT,5.0,,"The Singapore subway system is the cleanest, safest, and most efficient system I have seen. This is the way to get around Singapore. The only minor glitch I encountered is that the attendant from whom I purchased two three-day Singapore MRT ""Tourist Passes"" for S$60 could not break a S$100 bill and wanted to charge me a surcharge for using a credit card -- I thought it was pretty ridiculous to not have S$40 in change and then to want to charge extra for credit. But that was a minor annoyance in an otherwise excellent value and incredibly efficient way to get around the city."
,,easy travel,5.0,,"excellent means of travelling around Singapore. Easy to follow maps, simple ticketing system and clear signage. Quick and straightforward with helpful staff on hand to provide advice if needed."
,,Probably the best underground train network,5.0,,"This might be the best underground train network in city. Connects to almost everywhere, that too underground. No need to worry about hot and humid weather. Not crowded at all even during peak hours (when I compare that to being crowded in India)"
,,"Good System, Could Use Some Better Maintenance",4.0,,"First of all, compared to transit systems in my home country USA), the MRT is phenomenal and with the expansion plans currently underway, it will be even better in the future. Still, with all the good, there are some maintenance issues that need to be addressed. The North South (Red) line is plagued by slow trains north of Toa Payoh). The car in which we rode on the Northeast (Purple) line had very bad squealing brakes. Stations aren’t quite as clean as before. And more escalators are closed off for repair for longer times, something I almost never saw in previous visits. Still, when combined with the bus system, there ar3 very few places in Singapore where you can’t take public transit within a few hundred feet."
,,"Clean, Air Con, Cheap, Easy 🚊",5.0,,"Very easy to use, plenty of maps around the stations. You need small bills or coins to purchase your ticket, anything bigger than $5 the machines won’t take. You need to scan your ticket to enter and the exit the station, so hold on to it! The stations are all very clean, no trash cans around. Bathrooms are very clean and easily available. There is no drinking or eating on the trains. The train platforms and the trains are all air conditioned which makes it very pleasant while waiting for your train. Much nicer than waiting for a bus outside in the Singapore heat and sun! I would highly recommend using the metro!"
,,Excellent way to travel and move about,4.0,,"MRT is amazing and excellent way to travel around in Singapore and it does not matter whether you are a foreigner or local. There are different lines and many different stations and all are really clearly signposted and the whole system is incredibly easy to use.
When wandering around Singapore even i am a local but have been out of the country the for past 10 years, I was never far away from an MRT station. There is also a great airport link. The way to travel is to obtain a EZ card that works on both the buses too. The MRT is incredibly well organised and all kept immaculately clean and tidy. There are people around who will willingly assist should you require it. This system ensures swift transport between places at a very affordable (cheap) price. For me it was a superb way to travelㄡ"
,,Tour Around Singapore,5.0,,"MRT service is extraordinary, you can get Singapore traveller pass for 1,2 and 3 days of unlimited travel in train and buses."
,,How to buy a ticket,5.0,,"Not the easiest thing as most ticket booths don’t sell tickets

There is a multi trip card you can use six times but you charge it individually.

Importantly you need coins or small notes-even$10 is too big a note. This was the reason we couldn’t get the machine to work after various attempts to get help one if the staff gave us 5x$2 and that worked

You choose the destination and load up the card then reload it for the next journey when your coming back - it gets quicker to use after the first few times.

The single trip is fine for a few trips but if your going to do more trips buy the tap on and off electronic card."
,,One of the best MRT,4.0,,Singapore MRT sets an example on how public transport system has to be planned. Signboards to ticketing everything is easy. Kudos !!
,,An excellent way to travel...,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT is amazing. There are different lines and many different stations but all are really clearly signposted and the whole system is incredibly easy to use.
When wandering around Singapore I found I was never far away from an MRT station. There is also a great airport link.
The way to travel is to obtain a card (this can be done at any station) and load some money onto it. The card is then swiped onto the machines as you enter and exit each station. These machines inform you how much money you have left. Top up is easy, should it be required. These cards work on the buses too.
The MRT is incredibly well organised and all kept immaculately clean and tidy. There are people around who will willingly assist should you require it. This system ensures swift transport between places at a very affordable (cheap) price. For me it was a superb way to travel and see the city."
,,Get a EZ link card to save money,5.0,,If you want to explore Singapore by bus or MRT then I highly recommend you to get a EZ link. You can get them in convenience store at the station if the counter is closed. A one way ticket if you just buy would cost 1.40 but if you use the card then it is 0.77 only. The card cost 5 dollar but it is totally worth it.
,,Haw Par Villa to Harbour front – 8 minutes,5.0,,"This journey has only 3 train stations in-between & they are Pasir Panjang, Labrador Park & Telok Blangah. It is a driverless train but there is always an SMRT attendant present inside. Just outside the train station is a bus stop on one side & Tiger Balm Gardens on the other side of the entrance. It was once upon a time was popular tourist attraction. Harbour front is a last stop & from there you can go to Sentosa island or Vivo City shopping mall or get connected to North East Line."
,,"QUICK, CHEAP TRANSPORT",5.0,,"Great way to get around. We went from the harbor area to Gardens by the Bay and then to Chinatown and back. We were helped with ""topping up"" the cost of the ticket on the return. The trains are very clean as are the stations and there is a lot of information to assist visitors, as well as agents you are also helpful."
,,Better than the Britain,5.0,,"If anyone wants to complain about the trains here they should try the London underground. The trains are cool, quiet, clean and definitely not smelly. You don't see huge dusty patches of track when waiting for the train and all doors are numbered so you can even arrange to meet people on the train instead of the station. Rides are very affordable."
,,Frustrating,3.0,,"On the whole there is a lot to like about the Singapore metro, but it is not all plain sailing.
1 At Changi we queued for 10 mins only to find that the office was not a ticket office!! But no notice saying that until at window.
2 Then found that there were only 2 general purpose ticket machines to service all the people just arriving."
,,Singapore Rail System,5.0,,"Absolutely great rail system, only ever wait a few minutes, so clean and takes you all over Singapore."

,,"Orderly, clean, efficient",5.0,,We bought a 3-day tourist pass for $30 ($10 is refunded when you return the pass). It’s an easy way to get around Singapore.
,,Easy and quick,5.0,,Our family of four easily and cheaply travelled around Singapore for a week using MRT. Children were aged 10 & 17. Stairs and turnstiles would be more difficult for families with prams.
,,Super efficient,5.0,,I visited Singapore with my family including my aged grandmother. She was wheelchair bound but we were completely relaxed as Singapore is a barrier free country. People are extremely sensitive for physically disabled people. The MRT was no different. We found elevators and ramps almost everywhere. The MRT stations were very conveniently located and easily approachable. Very efficient system of the city. Also the tickets were very reasonably-priced.
,,Perhaps the best in the world,5.0,,This service is excellent and very easy to use. The stations and trains are the cleanest I have seen anywhere in the world. You don't need an electronic app to use it either. The straightforward paper map is more than adequate..
,,Great way to see Singapore,5.0,,Very easy and cheap to use. Made use of metro on a recent 4 day stop over in singapore. Did the complete loop travelling out to country just for something to do. Puts australia s rail system to shame

,,Save money,5.0,,Travelling by mrt saves a lot of money and time as city gets pretty packed during rush hours.Taxis can get pretty expensive .Mrt can be used to get to the city from the airport too.Very easy to make an EZLink card
,,Ground transportation at its best,5.0,,"SMRT is one of the better ground transportation system in the world in terms of safety, punctuality ( although Singaporeans high expectations think this can be improved), comfort and affordability. Easy to buy a pass from automated machines at train stations and top up as required enables one to use the train and bus as required to move around the whole of Singapore. Network is well developed and continually expanding which gives passengers more choice. Has become my preferred mode of transportation during short and long stays ."
,,Fast and Easy,5.0,,"The SMRT was just the easiest way to travel well signed, clean, fast, regular, and with the tourist pass for 3 days unlimited travel it made things so much easier."
,,SMRT Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and not expensive with wonderful air conditioning. Has recently been extended with the addition of a new line and gives good coverage of the city."
,,Singapore fast transit,5.0,,Spent a couple of days here and as we had been positioned on the outskirts we found the transit system a boon. It's a quick efficient way of getting around.
,,Promenade to botanic gardens,5.0,,"Easy, clean fast and inexpensive. It puts some other Mrt to shame, be careful of your exit, often they have 4 exits, which can span hundreds of meters, check your exit or return letter before climbing the stairs."
,,cool adventure,5.0,,"it,s cheap its fun and it gets you around easily with out any fuss staff are helpful and we had no issuses that we'srnt fun we did get on the wrong train but that gave us a bonus 30 mins off sorting out where we were so that was fun"

,,Better than London metro.,5.0,,"I was in loved by London tubs until I visited Singapore. Every station it`s closed by glass walls and stainless steel, very clean and smelling great.

,,Mr,5.0,,"Have taken the MRT throughout my time (55 days) in Singapore and for me it’s really hard to beat. Heard complaints about this train system from locals, but honestly it’s a great form of transport. Especially when you come from somewhere that could really do with it!

Novena to Clark Key was very strategic get forward and the cheapest way for me to get there, unless I walked or used a bike"
,,MRT - at par Excellent,5.0,,"A very good transport system. Easy to use and best connectivity to all places.

Buy easy link card at airport MRT its only 7 singapore dollars. And you can top up it and use it. Finally refund the balance unused amount at airport MRT before boarding your flight.

Note: small stations will not issue easy link card. So better buy at airport MRT."

You can buy ticket on the vending machines. Make sure you have cash (coins and 2$ bills) with since the Credit Cards are not always working

,,Easy as chips,5.0,,"Must say Singapore's underground MRT system is good and easy to use.

I bought the $16 two day option at Changi airport (ticket office down stairs near station entrance at T2).

From there on you basically choose where you want to go and swipe your card and away you go.

Signage and announcements are excellent, trains clean and functional.

Stations easy to navigate and the system covers a wide area within Singapore."

Riders wait in a queue and don’t board until departing passengers exit the subway car. A visitor should buy a tourist pass which gives you unlimited use of public transportation. The system is easy to navigate. It’s a symbol of Singapore’s legendary efficiency."
,,Fast and Efficent,5.0,,"The SMRT would rate as one of the best people moving systems in the world. It works and is cheap, it is simple to use and the trains run to all key locations. Why use taxis when the SMRT is available.

Other than it being morning commute for the locals, the train system was good, and cheap. I would def not mind using it again."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"MRT:
Singapore's MRT system is fast and usually reliable with occasional exceptions. One can easily travel around just with the MRT alone without needing to take the bus that may be a little confusing, especially for tourist.
Stations are kept clean and are either air-conditioned or well ventilated with huge fans.
Waiting time for trains almost never exceed 10minutes. During peek hours, they can be as frequent as every 2 minutes.
Journeys are usually 2-3 minutes between each station.
Each station and all trains have reference maps easily available for reference purposes. Some stations even have counters that provide free paper maps.
Stations are always wheelchair friendly with lifts available.
Although having multiple train lines may be confusing, they are all colour coded for easy identification. Also, unlike some other countries, changing lines in the MRT don't require a different ticket / card / payment form.

Payment:
Options for tickets for the MRT include the Ez-link card, and the one-time tickets. Both can be bought at every MRT station. For travelers, the Ez-link card would be a better option. Base price would be SGD $12. The card would be $5 (not refundable deposit) and with $7 credit. Top ups can be done at again, any MRT stations.
Ez-link cards would save time needing to queue up / go to the automated machines each time to buy a one-time ticket. Also, with an ez-link card, transiting between buses and trains would be a brisk, and will also be at a discounted price (within 45mins i think).
Also, many convenient stalls, supermarkets etc, accept ez-link card payments. It is fast and fuss-free!

Wi-Fi:
This is available at most MRT stations. Connection can be done easily with registration."
,,Excellent Transport System,5.0,,"I wish we had this transport system in my home town!! It was a pleasure to travel on this system. The trains were alway on time and the stations so clean, together with cheap travel. The travel instructions in the stations are clear and there was always someone to help you if you were unsure. Don't be afraid to use this system. Enjoy the experience."
,,"Clean, efficient and affordable",5.0,,"One of the world’s best metro systems. First choice for getting around the city, particularly for visiting major attractions. Busy downtown on Sundays. Escalators: stand on the left! Platforms: queue where they queue!"
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,This was our second visit to Singapore as we were there for 2 weeks decided to get the EZ link cards for the family the card works on all public transport except for the monorail to Sentosa.The MRT in Singapore is Fantastic clean and efficient very stroller friendly as there were lifts everywhere it is the cheapest and easiest way to get around. A lot of tourists get scared during rush hours especially if your with children but if you just wait 5 mins there is always another train with less passengers. We saved so much by opting for the MRT this time there is a 5 dollar non refundable fee but even then it’s a lot cheaper than taxis.

,,Clean rains,4.0,,Very clean trains and very frequent. People will let you it if you are elderly or have young children in a pram.
,,Very disappointing,3.0,,"I was setting off ( 7:15am ) to take the MRT from Dhoby Gaut station to Harbour front on wed 11th April 2018 to get on the Aeroline at 8am at Harbour front .
When I rushed down the escalator , before the doors closed on the train , the two guards who were waiting with the doors open decided to shut the doors when they saw me within 10 feet .
I thought it was so unfair and anti social .
What followed was a nightmare. The next train supposed to be arriving in 2 mins didn’t arrive . Crowds got bigger . Announcement was made late . After 15 mins of waiting , I gave up and tried taking a taxi - guess what - no taxis to be seen at 7:30 am . My patience and time was running out .
Tried bus and the driver takes my money and tells me 5 mins later ( only after my questioning him ) that I won’t there till half an hours at least . More frustration !!
Another passenger kindly advised me to hop off the bus and get into another bus that goes direct to the harbour front which I did in good faith only to find out that the Aeroline bus took off without me.
Then I book another ticket ( pay full fare again )
And was told by Aeroline “we don’t take credit cards “ So time running out for next available bus Leaving 8:30 am.
Was told yo get cash from ATM WHICH WAS DOWNSTAIRS . I rush down and back and make the payment and finally get into the bus.
What I cannot understand :
The MRT staff could have let me into the train but used no common sense ( some of us are older and less athletic to run faster than “ an antelope “ I beg to add !
Please use empathy - some of us are tourists —NOT SINGAPORE CITIZENS !!!
Tourists wish to come back BUT THIS UNUSUAL INCIDENCE WAS NOT BACKED UP BY ADVICE TO PASSENGERS TO FIND A QUICK ALTERNATE SOLUTION TO GET TO OUR DESTINATIONS.
IT was Robotic in many ways and one wonders how robots will run a system ( esp when humans don’t have proactive instincts !! )
Singapore you are a very organised beautiful country but please try to be more humane !
I know this is a rare occasion all the same so much could have been avoided .
I am a pensioner 70 yrs old and rushed around like a lunatic to Spend money in a wasteful manner !"
,,Awesome connectivity,5.0,,It was a wonderful experience to travel in SMRT . Frequency is very high and it covers most of the tourist destinations. Thumbs up to SMRT 👍🏻
,,Cheap & Good,5.0,,Cooling aircon helps to combat t extreme hot weather in Singapore. Efficient and fast at Low cost price. Just the kind of transport I am looking for!
,,This Transit train as set the standard world wide for cleanliness,5.0,,To the people of Singapore this is a credit to your city that you and its visitors can set such a high standard of super clean stations and trans its a credit to this city. Other countries take note
,,Good metro service,5.0,,"wonderful experience, well connected with all over Singapore. one needs to study the net work before boarding the metro"
,,MRT,5.0,,"The best service I've experienced so far! Not only were all trains on time, clean and not jam packed, this transport system was easy to navigate and so inexpensive! The workers on gates were so nice and willing to help with anything. The gentleman at Bras Basah was great help and also just lovely to chat to."
,,"Yes!!! By all means,, do it!",5.0,,"Getting around in Singapore is REALLY easy.
Not only are there usually plenty of cabs and ""Grabs"" *Singapore's version of Uber.
The MRT is one of the world's best subway

PROS: It's clean maybe due to the HUGE fine you'll get if they catch you eating or
drinking on it.
It's quick, we never waited longer than a few minutes, and it was on time.
It's almost understood for people to give up their seats for the elderly and
pregnant.
It's cheap, we went from midtown to downtown for a dollar.
It's also quiet, cuz everyone's just looking at their phones.

CONS: at rush hours,, it's crowded

TIP: if you're going to ride it more than once,,. Spend $5.00 for the reuseable card and fill it up with what you think you will use during your stay.. It'll save you time."
,,Excellant way to get about,5.0,,Very clean very efficient and very cheap way to get around the city. Staff very helpful guiding your way to places you wish to visit
,,Clean and cheap,5.0,,"excellent way to get around the city - very cheap to use (you can top up your cards with required trips at stations), and very e easy to use also - all well sign posted, and very clean for a busy city"
,,So very easy to navigate!,5.0,,"The cleanest mass transportation I have ever been on! Very easy and fun to navigate. Having shown my 11 yr old daughter how to do it, she was ""in charge"" for the rest of the week of our MRT travels. She even showed my brother (who lives there) a few short cuts!"
,,Not too bad,3.0,,"Seldom take the MRT nowadays. Used it the whole of last week along the East-West line during peak timings of 8+ in the morning and 5+ in the afternoon. Not too bad and there were enough trains to take the load, except for a couple of days where I had to wait for more than 2 trains to get on.

Overall, it was still alright despite the recent train failures in the past year. But I noticed the quality and make of the new trains are not up to mark, especially the flooring which popped up in many train carriages."
,,There Is No Better,5.0,,"At minimum, use the MRT to be inspired how a community can keep subways free from litter and noise. The rides were peaceful and efficient. The air-conditioning is welcome after walking in the heat and humidity."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, safe and so convenient for getting around Singapore. If you not from here, it is an easy system to navigate with color coding and everything is in English. Make sure to stand in the red areas when waiting for the train, ensuring you keep the green area clear for riders to exit the train. And always offer the seat designated for elderly, pregnant, disabled or moms with kids seat if they board after you. It shows good manners to all."
,,Exceptional,5.0,,"You know It's good when they have a number right there to lodge any kind of complaint. It is always on time, efficient and as with other things in Singapore, neat and clean."
,,Janine 50,5.0,,Absolutely fabulous travel network Spotlessly clean Directions of lines superb Puts the underground in London to shame
,,Very efficient,5.0,,The system works well and is really cheap. Full air conditioning also helps given the weather in Singapore. We only got standard tickets which you need to top up every time you use it but if you only plan a few journeys it will be more cost effective than getting a tourist pass for a few days. I love the messages that are the same as everywhere else but here are communicated through the use of cute characters like the one in the photo.
,,Singapore MRT ezpay pass is Awesome 👏🏼,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT, metro, light rail and bus system is top notch. Buy the ezlink pass for unlimited rides. It’s reloadable. Best value for travel throughout Singapore. Run from 8am to 11:30pm everyday."

It is very easy to use and inexpensive. All stations are labeled in English, and announcements are made of upcoming stations. Easy quick way to get from airport to my hotel after long flight."
,,Super clean and organized,5.0,,... though takes pretty long from place to place. Took a short spin on east-west line and back. standees are in 3 rows ll facing sae direction. and the riders don't like to deviate. i accidentally stood sort of crooked and a passenger twitched and coughed at me till i figured it out and re-arranged. Still fun to try.
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"Pleasantly surprised how simple and easy to use. You can get to anywhere to Singapore using the lrt/mrt combo. All signs are in 3 languages (english, chinese and malaysian). There's 2 pricing. One if you have. Refillable card and the other is normal ticket. The refillable card is 50% off the fare but you have to purchase the card. It will depend on your length of stay and frequency of use that will determine savings. Enjoy."
,,Efficiency personified,5.0,,"Trains are very regular, super clean and safe to use. So efficient and speedy, getting you almost anywhere in Singapore so cheap too."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"If only other places had an MRT like this on. Clean, modern, on time, safe. Puts the London Underground to shame"
,,"Easy to use, clean, efficient and good value",5.0,,"I used the MRT for the first time during my short stay in Singapore, and it did sing-a-pour with rain, apart from a few breaks in the weather. It was really easy to use, and buying a ticket was extremely simple, although only accept cash. Still, it's very cheap, and people are always very keen to help if you ask. A great experience to anyone wanting to get around the tourist attractions in a quick visit to the city."
,,Very comfortable,4.0,,"Riding SMRT is very easy. Routes are clearly marked and trains run very frequent. Using a tourist pass was very comfortable. Getting the pass was not so easy (a long queue at the airport kiosk, slow administrative process)."

,,Wonderful cool way to get around,5.0,,"What a cheap, cool and efficient way to get around singapore. Looks a bit daunting to start but easy after a few trips. A fair bit of walking to get to the right train but escalators and lifts can ease the pain. Locals are very friendly and helpful, even offering up seats. Very safe and locals are very polite."
,,On tour with the McLintons again,5.0,,"This is the best public transport I have ever been, quick efficient clean, so easy to get around Singapore. Love it"
,,"Good frequency, Neat and Tidy",5.0,,"Very well organized and the map is easily readable even by kids. Tourists can opt for an unlimited 1/2/3 day pass. If you don't like to walk a lot, you can opt for cabs and that will work best in some cases, if you are a family of 3 or 4"
,,Best public transportation I have seen,5.0,,This was one of the best public transportation I have ever seen. I didn't think of taxi or public bus when I was there. Even I travelled back from a place at 10.45 pm and reached at 11:30 pm. This clearly indicates that it runs in odd hours. (Please check the timings with front office staffs in MRT. They are really cool and helpful)Thanks MRT for making the public transportation a hassle free.

,,great way to see the city,4.0,,"inexpensive was to go ride through the city. The train has many lines but all of the places we vsiitied, raffles, marina bay has direct access from the stations. Recommend the tourist 2 day pass"
,,One of the best in the world !!,5.0,,The cleanliness and timeliness of service is appreciable.. there have been some issues in the past which need to be looked into especially for peak travellers .. but in general I feel it is one of the best in the world which is why the high expectations I presume..
,,Best in the world,5.0,,If you are visiting singapore this system could not be easier use small dollar notes to buy a card and load it up tap it to go in and tap out it’s very cheap and it works on the bus as well
,,Clean and fast!,4.0,,Metro is vey well conected with all part of the city. It is very clean and climated. One line go to airport Changi.
,,Very good transport system,4.0,,Yes it is a excellent transport system but is a little bit of a fast pace trying to identify your route and getting your tickets. Once you have it sorted then your away with efficient speed and ease of traveling through out the city
,,Fantastic way to get a around Singapore,5.0,,"We loved the MRT to travel around Singapore. Buy a card and add value as you need it, credit refundable when you leave. The trains are spotless and unless you are travelling at Peak you will usually get a seat.

Fares are incredibly cheap and trains are frequent."
,,Super fast and easy to use,4.0,,For a complete novice with kids this was an easy and fun way to get around with excellent maps to show where to go. we didn't know there was no eating in the stations until a kind local told us so some signage about this would have been good!
,,Efficient transport system,5.0,,"Used the MRT to get around Singapore as station was virtually beneath our hotel. Very clean stations and trains, fast and efficient, and pricing surprisingly inexpensive. An example of how effective such mass transport systems should be."
,,Beware: Smelly and old trains,1.0,,"When you take the North-South line, the trains can be old and have an awful and terribly unpleasant smell. Beware of entering trains with dirty floor, it can be such an unpleasant experience that it makes you want to exit almost immediately."
,,for travel all arround singapore,5.0,,"you can traveling arround using this one with affordable price ,
must know you route for your convenience. clean station and clean train also .
for 1st timer buying ticket feom machine will be a bit hustle , just read carefully what appears in the vending ticket machine"
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, good pricing - very like system in Hong Kong but less busy. Easy to use / get around. Felt very safe too."
,,An excellent way to get around,5.0,,"One of the best rapid transit systems in the world. Clean, fresh and very, very safe. The ticketing system is a little complicated with getting a refund for your deposit and there doesn't seem to be a ticket that gives you unlimited travel. ."
,,"Best MRT in the world ,and I have seen many of them.",5.0,,So many locations and such a short wait between trains. Amazing. Cost is low. Just get yourself a card and add some value. Easy to get at most MRT stations or 7/11 convenience stores.
,,Very efficient and on time,5.0,,"The train system of Singapore is one of the most efficient train system in the whole world. I'm happy that I get to experience this! Some tourists would prefer to hail a cab or book a Grab car but what I did while in SG is to experience their train system and bus system. At first glance, their railways are a bit intimidating. All you need to do is to memorize which stations and platforms the changing happens - if you need to go to the Blue line, and you're in Green line, where can you transfer lines? Those kind of things. Their trains are automated so it departs and arrives on time. Minimum top up for the reloadable transit card is $10 SGD and the single journey is around $0.77 SGD for each trip."
,,great system,4.0,,"Couldn't be an easier way around the Island. Cheap and efficient way to get where you need to go. Singapore is a great walking City, but can get very hot! The subway is a cool and goes everywhere."
,,Awensome,5.0,,"Great, tecnologically advanced. Great ticket system. Clean, fast. Easy to understand. At last the underground that all big city want have. SMRT the best i try"
,,One of best train in asia,4.0,,Been in singapore for four times and i regret the first time im in SG... roaming around riding a taxi... you can feel SG fully when youre riding its rail transit... moving around is faster.. you can be at a certain place in the nick of time... like staying in bugis area to universal studio in just a few minutes....SG mass rail transit is the best!!
,,all aboard,5.0,,what a great rail network....fast...efficient...clean...cheap...and you miss one train....hey no problem another one is about 4 mins away...and what really freaked me out...no driver...yep driverless....basically you can stand at the front off the train at a huge window and watch this thing hurtle along...well done Singapore well done !!
,,Best train service in the entire world,5.0,,"The most amazing train services in the entire world. Very neat and comfortable.
You arent allowed to eat/drink once you tap in and hence its best to make sure you eat/drink whatever you want to before you tap in and get riding esp if your journey is long."
,,very convenient and clean,5.0,,"convenient , clean , perfect way to visit the city , buy Ez link card at the airport , very easy to use"
,,Reliable and take you where you want to go,5.0,,"Get the Tourist Pass, it is cheaper and you can get the price of the card refunded at the end of your stay in Singapore. Just don't leave it to get the refund at the airport if you are travelling by taxi otherwise you'll have to get out of the airport all the way to the nearest station to get your refund. If you are travelling by taxi to the airport, get your refund close to your hotel before leaving."
,,The Best,5.0,,"Doubt if you could find a better, more efficient public transport system anywhere else. Extremely easy to locate stations and bus halts. Easy to find your way around the stations."
,,"Clean, Cheap and On Time",4.0,,Was good 30 years ago and in 2018 its just as good. always clean. Prompt arrival times. Easy access to everywhere!
,,By far the best public transport ever used,5.0,,The mrt is the quickest and easiest way to get around singapore. It is cost effective and real easy to navigate. I downloaded a smrt map onto my phone to help.
,,Reliable and great value,5.0,,Unless you intent to hop on and off trains and buses all day in which case get a tourist pass for up to 3 days otherwise it is cheaper to get the EZ pass. The charged travel cost for each journey seems much cheaper than per trip and unless you are at one of a handful of stations you cannot get a tourist pass......
,,Best way of transport ever experienced,4.0,,Singapore MRT is the most convenient metro i have ever used. It connects all the parts of Singapore and the map available at all stations is so user friendly that anyone visiting first time can follow it and can reach their destination. Only concern is that the visitor passes/ refunds are available at only major stations.
,,Metro,5.0,,"metro is close by and very easy to use with attendants close by to offer assistance if required, well signposted"
,,Best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,I enjoyed travelling and moving around Singapore with their MRT. It is very comfortable and accessible.
,,Excellent transport system,3.0,,"Very good underground system to get around the city. Air conditioned, very clean and safe. Colour coded route map makes it easy to follow. Do it, much cheaper than Taxis."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Once you figure out that you need cash to buy a ticket, the subway is very easy to use. It is attached to many underground shopping and dining areas so when it is raining, you can duck into and still keep walking toward your destination. Many stores are open late night if you need something"
,,The ez-link card is all you need,5.0,,"The easiest way to get around Singapore hassle free. We used our ez-link cards from our previous trip to Singapore 3 years ago. You can buy new cards at 7 eleven stores for 10S$, 5S$ for the card & 5S$ stored value. You can top up your cards at 7 eleven (min top up 5S$) or MRT ticket machine at the station (min top up 10S$). Please note 7-eleven will charge an extra 50 cents for every transaction. You must have at least 3 S$ stored value on your card to start a trip. The ez-link will save you a lot of time during your visit as you will not have to buy a ticket for each trip & you can use on the bus as well, only swipe your card over the scanner at the gate. Be careful on how much you top up your card as unlike the Octopus card in Hong Kong you cannot get a refund. The new DT line is a lifesaver to get to & from the airport if your hotel is near a DT station
all you have to do is transfer at the expo station from the EW line, first stop."
,,The cleanest mass transit ever !,5.0,,"Very efficient and clean. If a tourist, get the tourist pass so you can do the MRT and the bus. As of April 19, 2018 it was the equivalent of 10USD per day."
,,Clean and efficient.,5.0,,"A cheap and easy way to get around Singapore. Once we figured out how to read the MRT map, we loved using it."
,,Best way to and from airport!,5.0,,"Do not take taxi from airport when this beautiful transit are available!

We arrived in middle of the day and have only heard from TripAdvisor to use this one so we tried our self.

So to be more clear than the other I’ll try my best to explain this.
First when you arrive to the boot to buy the ticket a lady (old) came up to us and asked if we wanted to change money, because we only had higher money and my first tough was He’ll Na! But she just stood there with her fanipack so at the end we trusted her and let here change them and it worked out, then if your ther for a week buy the week card or 10rides.

So if your going to the center from airport you need to change 2lines and the first change is only 3stops from the airport.

And when you changing the line make sure not to walk out from the gate because then you’ll pay 1 more time.

If your not sure ask any kind person because mostly of them are very kind.

Let me know if you want me to visit something else in Singapore.

,,Rapid service,5.0,,So easy to travel by the mrt transport system in singa pore a nd cheap .very convenient within whole of the country.
,,Can't leave home without it,4.0,,"Considering the trouble of buying a car and getting/paying for parking in Singapore, SMRT is the best alternative - it is efficient, affordable, convenient - and covering most of the Island's strategic locales. You only need to carry one card for different lines, and can be used on all public buses too.

Downtime is rare. If any, the Management response is expedient via mobile, web and on-site display. Furthermore, the affected area will be accorded free bus service for the entire downtime."
,,without drivers mrt cool,4.0,,singapore nice and small city then need good style mrt plan have 5 different color and you can look which place to go and choice your board
,,Public Transport is World Class and Cheap,4.0,,When in Singapore you can use the MRT which connects you to all the important roads and malls along the route. F&B joints are easy to find and have variety of foods. Shopping too can be done but is mostly expensive.
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Worth getting 3 day tourist pass. 20 dollars Singapore plus 10 dollars for the card which is refundable when you return the card.
Brilliant way to get around Singapore. Trains and stations are bright and clean, and trains are very frequent.
Our grandson loved standing at the front and enjoying the view that the driver would get if there was one.
Virtually everywhere that we went was only a few minutes walk from a station."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Easy to navigate and cheap as chips. Clean and goes pretty much everywhere. Be prepared and get a map and know which station is the end of the line on the line you need to get off at...
,,Clean and efficient,4.0,,A very convenient way to travel around Singapore. At the moment building a new line and dome signage could be better but it is difficult to counter balance the disruption. When completed will certainly improve the system. Very clean .
,,An amazing asset for the city,5.0,,A very high quality train in service and carriages. Covers most parts of Singapore Island with very cheap tickets. Like the safety doors on each station that only open when the train is stationery
,,Fast and Easy,5.0,,"3 minutes is the longest we waited for a train. Its simple and cheap. As we had 2 weeks in Singapore, we bought an EZ Link card and topped it up when needed."
,,"cutting edge, model transportation system",5.0,,"Our hotel was steps away from a station, so we jumped in first day there to try it out. The system is clean, easy to understand, efficient, and safe. Older gentlemen wait by the ticket stand to jump in and help out (in perfect English) to explain anything you need to know — which made it all so very easy!"
,,Best public transport!,5.0,,"MRT is amazing - so clean, safe, cheap and easy to use! Put $10 on travel card a week ago and used daily all over island on trains and buses. Fantastic 🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠"
,,Subway in Singapore,5.0,,The Subway system is very organized and goes every where in Singapore. We bought a 3 day tourist pass and used it to go every where. you can use the bus system as well.
,,"Simple, yet effective!",5.0,,"Clean, air conditioned and mobile phone signal. What more could you want! There are also amusing posters highlighting some of ""manners"" that people should try to adhere to e.g. ""Stand Up Stacey"" to give up your seat to those more needy which was pretty cool. Personally, the best way to pay would be using an EZ card which you can obtain at the counter in each station, and what is cool is that the cards have different designs based on what is current (I got an Avengers card due to the upcoming film). Also compared to other cities i have been to, the travel price is definitely very reasonable!

If you need to travel around Singapore, then the MRT is definitely the way to go!"
,,Excellent network,5.0,,"Modern , clean and efficient and easy to navigate around the quite extensive network. Friendly staff - the few we saw. Best way to travel around Singapore.

One niggle - long wait at busy times to get ticket from machines. They have a system of card top up - which we couldn't get right - so we bought a return ticket each time we used the MRT. If you wanted to hop on and hop off during the day this would be tiresome! Even people who I assumed were locals, were having problems, as they too were trying to top up but ended up having to purchase tickets. London Underground system may have its's faults - but Oyster Top up is not one of them!!"
,,Very efficient and quick,5.0,,"Love the MRT to get around. There are very regular, on time and clean trains. With a Singapore Tourist Pass it is also great value."

,,"Efficient, cheap and easy way to get around Singapore",5.0,,"This is the easiest way to get around Singapore, the staff are very friendly and helpful if you need help but the system is well signed and very easy to navigate."
,,cheap and efficient,5.0,,The MRT is amazing! Only minutes between trains and the stations are so modern. And so cheap as well!
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,The metro system is very well managed and efficient. Ticketing is too hassle free and promotes paper saving. The security is well behaved and make sure everyone is following same
,,The easiest and cheapest way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"No need for Uber or taxis. Invest 10-15 mins planning your day. Head out into the streets of Singapore and you will quickly be guided by street signs to the closest station. Purchase your card and you are ready to go. None of my trips were more than a dollar. The trains are spotless, on time, in my case they ran every 5 mins. A great experience."
,,Brilliant public transport system,5.0,,"We travelled to Singapore in April and were regular uses of the SMRT. The system is extremely efficient and easy to navigate once you get used to the various lines, as well as ticketing. We recommend getting a Tourist pass that allows unlimited trips over 1,2 or 3 days with the 3 day pass costing 20 SGD. The pass itself is an extra 10 SGD which is refundable at the end of your stay. Brilliant initiative and others cities/countries should take a leaf out of their book."
,,So efficient,5.0,,"One of the most efficient subway systems in the world. It reaches almost the entire city. Each train — and each transit area — is so clean and organized well. I’ve taken the mrt/subway in Kuala Lumpur, NYC, and Singapore — Singapore is by far the best."

,,An incredible experience,5.0,,"The Singapore mass rapid transport system would have to be among the best transit systems in the world. Fast, very efficient, clean and totally safe. Can be a little confusing at times but plenty of staff to assist and fellow passengers friendly and helpfull. All stations in the central areas are underground but trains come to the surface in outer areas Must try at least once just for the experience"
,,So clean and efficient,5.0,,"This puts our London Underground to shame! Everywhere is so clean, no food and drinks allowed on the MRT and people are fined heavily for dropping litter....and that works! Driverless trains with safety doors at each station. So easy to get around. Buy a Tourist Pass ticket if here for 3 days if more get an EZ Link ticket."
,,Easy to move with MRT,5.0,,Very easy to understand and travel with MRT.A quick and cheap way to move around.Smooth rides and very clean trains.
,,A little difficult to understand at first but extremely useful,4.0,,"clean, seems safe, worth taking the time to get to know how to use it. Helpful passengers were a great boon"
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"If you are a tourist travelling to Singapore on a budget, then the MRT is the thing for you. Given the cabs out there in Singapore can be quite expensive, it makes sense to just buy a MRT card and keep recharging it. Dont take thd tourist pass, it would usually turn out to be more expensive. The MRT cover most parts of the city across various lines. Its convinient and efficient."
,,"Fast, easy, cheap",5.0,,"If you arrive by air, be sure to go to the MRT station in the airport basement. If you're only around for up to 3 days, get the tourist MRT / bus pass. Otherwise get the EZ-Link card and 'top up' in any MRT station. Minimum top up is $10. For now they're still accepting cash, but they plan on making the top up machines just for credit / debit cards. Then you just tap in to take a trip (bus or MRT) & tap out as you hop off. If you're leaving by air, return to the EZ-Link booth & get unused money and your $5 deposit back! Fares are insane! Depending on the time of day you might travel 7 stations for 9 cents or the same distance for $1.20. Remember to behave like a Singaporean: 1) on escalators stand to the left if you don't want to walk up / down & 2) give up your seat for: elderly, injured, pregnant or someone with an infant, 3) don't eat or drink other than water in the station or on the bus or MRT, 4) be very careful to toss your rubbish in the bin. A bonus! Lots of MRT stations have public toilets. I had some really fun chats with locals on the MRT & buses. The great social leveller! Virtually all MRT stations have snack food places; $1.50 to $2 snacks like bao, curry puffs, veg fritters, etc. Yummy & fun to try something new."
,,Tourists should take this subway trains,5.0,,"Exploring singapore using public transport is easy like ABC. Get a ezylink card with stored value to tap in and out subway trains n all buses. Card cost $7, add in whatever values u want. 1 way trip dont cost more than $2. N u should only be travelling around the city so not going to need much. Buying 1 time tix going to cost double the price. Not worth it. Straight forward, clean and fast (n safe of course). If in doubt just ask. Singaporeans may look unfriendly but no, our minds r just too preoccupied with things."
,,a very reputable way of transport!,5.0,,"the MRT is my favorite mode of trasport. with about 141 stations and 5 lines, The MRT stretches almost every where in singapore. you can go to sentosa via the MRT and the sentosa express train, or the airport on East west line. the trains are also clean, and nic the stations are have good signage too! make sure you take a ride on the MRT!"
,,AMAZING!,5.0,,"The MRT is the best way to go around Singapore. We never had the need to UBER/Grab or taxi. It is so easy to get the hang of it and if you need help. there are always people around you can ask for help. There are MRT stations near every important or touristy place you might want to check out. We even took the MRT from the airport which was great and had to walk only a block to get to our hotel. The part of it all, is that it is the cheapest way to get around a city that is a little bit expensive. Would defenitely recomend. I bought and EZ card and charged it with more money as I needed but it is also easy to purchase one way ticket fares."
,,Clean safe and sufficient.,5.0,,"Does the job - fast, quick and safe. Very easy to navigate as a visitor to the city. No.issyes at day or night."
,,Just amazing,5.0,,Took the MRT card and explored Singapore to the core. The rates are reasonable and you can reach every nook and corner of Singapore in quick time. The instructions/directions are very well displayed every where and you can change into the different lines with great ease. Even the announcement inside the MRT is done in 4 languages including Tamil. Mist of the stations have interchange and are located adjacent to shopping mall. The inter connectivity with LRT is superb and you can hop into any bus and use the same card. The stations are neat and tidy. The recharge can be done easily at the teller machines located in the stations.
,,OMG,5.0,,"Incredible. Clean, punctual, cheap and everywhere. Easy to use and find the way about. Can't fault it!"
,,Excellent transportation,5.0,,We were recommended the Tourist Pass in a Travel Magazine and I would recommend doing this. A three day pass was $20 plus $10 deposit well worth it for the amount of travelling we did during our three days. The network is easy to understand and the trains are efficient and pristine.
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,Travelled on the smrt and found the experience great. Very clear instructions and progressive updates on location makes it easy to use and get to places with a minimum of fuss.
,,Well connected and cheap,5.0,,"The SMRT is well connected, well planned, fast, on time and best way to commute. Trans every 5 minutes."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,My wife and I bought a 3 day pass on the MRT and used it every day. Once you have a map of the system it is a really good way to avoid all the traffic and get around in Singapore. The trains are clean and fast and run very frequently and we strongly recommend using.
,,This must be one of the world's most efficient safe transport systems.,5.0,,"The MRT is an efficient, safe and clean train systems that I have ever seen. The system is cheap and the staff that I encountered were knowledgeable and eager to help. Our government could learn a thing or two about efficient, effective and safe train systems from the Singaporean MRT. The MRT has trains every 5 minutes and a simple ticketing system. It takes a short time to get use to the train system and you will be using it like a local within a few hours. All trains are clean and air conditioned. Thoroughly recommended....."
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"The MRT network in Singapore is an excellent means of easy and convenient transportation. The expanding network with addition of new lines makes it more effective for quick travel across Singapore. The seamless connections with the bus network, with the use of a single Ezlink card, provides almost door to door reach ! Kudos to the Singapore govt for focused development of the public transport system, including covered sidewalks being put in place now !"
,,The best public transport anywhere!,5.0,,"If you are visiting Singapore, do yourself a favour and travel by MRT. Buy your card at any station and tap on & off to get around Singapore. MRT Maps are at each station or download a copy for ease of getting around. Citymapper is the best app to download, it will map the route via Train or bus step by step. Get around and see Singapore this way. VERY VERY cheap and efficient transportation"
,,"Efficient, clean and safe",5.0,,"The MRT works. Buy an easy link card if you are staying more than a couple of days, this will cost $12SD to purchase and then it can be topped up if required."
,,Easy Way to Get Around Singapore,5.0,,"This transport system has to be one of the, if not the, best systems in the world. Its easy to use, clean, air-conditioned, affordable and gets you to most places. Its a must when visiting Singapore!!"
,,Excellent way to get a round,5.0,,"So clean and so efficient,not overcrowded like our underground,once you get the hang of it it’s the best way to travel. Even a short journey in Singapore heat it is best to use army and not exspense"
,,Best means of transport in Singapore,5.0,,"MRT is the best and cheapest means of communication in Singapore. Very well connected to almost all places in Singapore. Very well maintained pods and stations. Train frequency is amazingly good. Passenger service counter at each station is very much approachable and very friendly. They are equipped with all the informations. Buy a 3 day pass at SGD 30 of which SGD 10 is refunded once the smart card is returned. So for SGD 20 you can commute from one place to another for any number of times for three days (without any limitations) and this also includes transfers/travels using bus.
Most MRT stations have very good and full fledged malls and shopping centre.. besides this each such station have ATM machines and small shops offering food on go. MRT stations have elevators and escalators also. These stations have special pathways for blind passengers who can help themself. Each stations have route maps (very easy and simple) installed along with fare details. Ticket counters are ample and completely automated. So you don't have to be dependent on human interventions. Donot opt for UBER, TAXI, CABS and other private hires when in Singapore. MRTs are the best."
,,Efficient Way To See Singapore,5.0,,"We were lucky that our hotel Oasia was directly above (MRT), so could get a lift from the floor of our hotel. Getting tickets was straight forward. We got individual tickets as we were only using for one day to visit Marina Bay & The Skypark. If you are visiting longer its recommended to buy a 'Tourist Pass' which gives you unlimited rides on public transport ie basic bus services, MRT, LRT trains. Choose between 1 day $10, 2 day $16, or 3 day $20. So nice to have trains on time & appear so spacious. Definitely recommended mode of transport for site seeing."
,,Efficient and convenient,5.0,,"You can use the train to visit tourist spots such as Chinatown, Marina Bay Sands, and Orchard Road.

There are lots of signboards to guide you through the pathways.

SGD10 can last you for three days or more, depending on how often you switch train lines and/or bus."
,,Easy and Cheap,5.0,,"How i wish we have this kind of system, it's simply so easy and cheap to travel. Who need taxi or Uber? Bought a 3 days pass and well worth the money. It's super clean too. 5 stars rating!"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Easy to use and very efficient way to get around this city. It's a big busy place but you can get to places quickly and easily using the system. Buy a pass. Which can be topped up every three days. It includes buses as well. Saves buying individual tickets
,,Good cheap way to travel,5.0,,Far cheaper than taxis. You have to take your time to ensure you are going to be travelling in the right direction once you found your line. Make sure you have small change to pay. The staff were very helpful when needed.
,,Hard to fault,5.0,,"We have used this magnificent rail transport system every time we visited Singapore. There seems to be an underground station on every street corner but they are very much everywhere and easily accessible.

We were worried the first time we used it but the coloured route lines allow you to easily follow where you need to be.

This is no fuss and extremely convenient. I wish we had a train system as good as this."
,,Public transportation in Singapore is great and easy,5.0,,I found traveling in Singapore whether with the public transportation or taxi was a breeze and just fantastic!
,,spoilt spoilt spoilt,3.0,,sometimes they are spoilt. but we know the staffs have done their best. keep up the good work. let's pray it wont happen always
,,Brilliant mode of transport!!,5.0,,Very easy to go places. Helpful and polite staff at counters. Reasonable pricing and no traffic jams!
,,Very efficient and great way to get around,5.0,,"One of the best underground transportation systems I've ever used. All the tracks are closed off in the stations by moving glass partitions for safety. Cars and stations are air conditioned and a limited number of seats are available for disabled, elderly, and general riders during low ridership."
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,Would highly recommend purchasing the tourist pass. So affordable. Easy to use. Clean stations. Always on time.
,,Cost effective option for airport to hotel,5.0,,"My group of 5 persons arrived at Changi Airport about 10.00 PM, but it was possible to reach hotel in downtown by MRT. Beginning with buying Tourist Pass (3-days) and went on to train from the Changi Station, then switched to East-West (Green) Line at Tanah Merah. From the green line, I switched to North-South at City Hall Station to reach my hotel at Novena Station, by just walking across platform. It will cost $60 per trip for 5-persons- taxi, or $120 for round trip. With 3-Day Tourist Pass, it costs $5x38 or $190 for airport round trip and unlimited ride of MRT and Bus for 5 persons for 3 full days."
,,Reliable,4.0,,"MRT is my most favorite public transport in Singapore. I even use it for a short distance like from Orchard to Somerset vice versa hehehe.. affordable, clean, easy to understand maps, and the fare can easily paid by the card, sometimes i buy the tourist pass for staying more than a day cause it’ll save a lot."
,,Efficient Service,5.0,,The Train Services in Singapore is already very good in comparison to her neighbouring states. There may be occasional hiccups but overall I am still satisfied.
,,Easy way to see Singapore,5.0,,"After taking a $17 taxi ride from airport to our hotel we looked at the tourist buses and the mrt as a way of seeing as much of Singapore as we could in 2 days. The tourist buses will take you to all the attractions but are too expensive at $60 each for 2 days. We decided on the 2 day tourist pass which lets you use the MRT and the local buses. The downside is you can only purchase from certain stations and there is a $10 deposit which you can only get back from the same stations. Next time I go I will purchase from the airport station and get as near to my hotel as possible then take a taxi. The MRT itself is very modern, clean and efficient. All stations have lifts as well as elevators and the system is very easy to use. As throughout Singapore english is spoken and on all signage.
By far the best transport system I have ever used."
,,Wish we had the same in NZ,5.0,,Loved the SMRT system - absolutely brilliant. So safe and clean and highly efficient. We had a bit of a laugh at the banned items and their associated signs. Seems like Durian are rated as high as flammable goods with a $5000 fine if taken on the trains! This train system is a credit to Singapore.
,,Good way of getting around,5.0,,"Easy to use as lifts everywhere especially as we had two strollers, well signposted, clean and trains come very regularly so not much waiting around. Yet to sit in a delay and have been using the mrt for last 3 days."
,,Really like it,5.0,,"I really like the singapore mass rapid transit. Its really usefull for me who have to travel singapore in a short time. With singapore mass rapid, you can easily travel singapore with short time. This transportation also way more economical than the other transportation. Mrt also can reduce the traffic. So, I really like it"
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"Used this amazing underground system. Efficient, spotlessly clean and so easy to use. Top up your card and you're ready to go. Couldn't be easier."
,,Very efficiently run and always on time,5.0,,"We used the MRT every day during our 3 day visit, only cost us around $1.50 per single trip which is amazing value. Can be busy at certain times but we always found plenty of space when we used it. Best way to travel around Singapore"
,,The best one in the world,5.0,,"Cheap, efficient and allowing you to get to every attraction of the island. However, I didn’t like the ticketing machines changing their mind when offering you a single or return trip be default, depending on the destination. Anyway any single trip ticket price above 2 dollars should attract your attention to check whether you buy a single or return trip!"
,,the worst MRT I’ve ever taken,1.0,,"SMRT 紅線跟綠線總是在誤點、系統總是在維修、前方列車總是出狀況、trains can’t go smoothly every day, such a shame in a developed country 希望SMRT在未來能改善系統的穩定性，讓乘客的搭乘過程更順暢"
,,Fantastic way to get around,5.0,,"Whenever we visit Singapore we use the MRT to get around. Easy to use, cheap, clean, plenty of stations to access the trains."
,,Set your watch by the timetables,5.0,,Travel in off peak times is best far less crowds. Buy an EZ-link ticket for $10 and get rides included. I had a very old (8years) and the credit was transferred to the new one. It's good for 5 years so keep for your return trip
,,Perfect. As efficient as it gets,5.0,,"The ONLY way, the cheapest way, the fastest way around the Island. Easy to use to the point its idiot proof."
,,Very efficient,4.0,,Just get the Ezy ticket and start travelling - easy to use. Just load up and off you go. Plenty of MRT maps in the stations. You can buy Ezy tickets at many shops like 7/11s. Just watch out though as the trains seem to stop at stations and you may have to transfer.
,,Very convenient,5.0,,Easy to follow with the SMRT app. Download it and enter your location from and to and it will tell u how to get there. Train system is really easy to follow.
,,This has to be the best transport system I've been on,5.0,,"The ticket office is so helpful. Purchased a $30 - 3 day pass to use the train and bus as many times as we wanted. When that expired we got another 3 day pass, then received a $10 refund at the end. All our excursions were done via bus and train, Zoo, Bay Gardens, Night Safari, Shopping and more shopping etc. It wasn't hard to find someone who knew exactly which train or bus to catch and they arrived every 7mins. Very convenient and friendly commuters too. I didn't feel unsafe at all."
,,Most Reliable and convenient public transport,5.0,,The best way to commute is to avail MRT which takes you to all the tourist places. Its easy and safe and time saving. Easy on pockets as well.
,,Great,5.0,,"Efficient and easy to use. Very convenient. Can get crowded after the office hours, otherwise very smooth journey alwasys"

,,Fantastic travel system!,5.0,,We found this the easiest and cheapest way to travel around Singapore. Very easy to use and navigate! Super clean too

,,Best Metro System,5.0,,"Best transit system i've ever used. so clean, efficient and most importantly cheap! Made me resent paying the prices I do at home."
,,Efficient & Clean,5.0,,We used the MRT to go and see some of the attractions. I couldn’t believe how spotless they are and so easy to use. No noise or pushing and shoving e everyone in orderly manner.
,,often faulty,1.0,,this mass rapid transit is seriously a headache if you are a working adult in singapore who takes train to work everyday.

,,Singapore train system,5.0,,"A great way to get around quickly one you get it figured out. One ticket can be reloaded for six times. We went everywhere by train. Just a tip Sundays is really a challenge as everyone seems to be on the trains and it gets really busy and crowed.
It is a really reasonable way to get around and see just about all of Singapore."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Fast and easy to use. Good connection times. Cheap. Clean. Efficient. Even buying tickets from the machine was easy.
,,fast and convinient,5.0,,It's a very fast service and there's a lot of places to sit. Usually people will not get nauseated because it is very swift. Also very simple to find your way around with the several maps they have around.
,,Not one for public transport - but this is so efficiant!,5.0,,"As above, I am not a fan of public transport, however the Singapore smrt is so efficient it is very hard to fault... also very cheap.

I would advise not to buy the tourist pass but purchase a card as it will be cheaper and you can hold on and reuse if you return."
,,"Not really a tourist attraction, but a good way to get around",5.0,,"It is very easy to work out, with a cost of about $1.40 SD to get anywhere on a single trip. You need small denominations (less than $5 or coins), otherwise go to the info desk and they'll change your larger bills into smaller ones."
,,Clean and simple,5.0,,"The MRT is extremely easy to use, all you have to do is scan your card ( we got a tourist pass that you can just top up once it runs out) when you enter the station and each station is clearly marked so you know where you're going. The actual trains themselves are so much cleaner than the ones in the UK and they have a lot of standing room as well, which is helpful during busy periods.
Overall, very satisfied at the train system in Singapore, would definitely use it again."
,,"Efficient, fast SMRT",5.0,,"Great connections all through Singapore and Changi airport. Clean, on time and effective means of transportation."
,,Why is it even on TripAdvisor ?,4.0,,"Can't believe public transport is ranked N°1 thing to do in SG

But hey, here's my opinion :

+ clean
+ fast
+ safe

- sometimes you can wait up to 9 min for a train
- lesser and lesser seating options (next step are seats that they can raise on peak hour (what the hell))
- not enough stations
- prices are going to raise
- monthly plans are not interesting
- not enough seats (did I mention the seating option already?)
- a lot of areas in Singapore are not covered
- No MRT after midnight, even on week ends (while London/Barcelona/etc open all night lines)"
,,Friendly and helpful staff,5.0,,We were sort of lost on our way home and a staff must have noticed us because we were approached and assistance was immediately offered.
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,We have been visiting Singapore for 5 days and have used MRT all around the city. Trains go very frequently. Longest we waited on a weekend was 3 to 4 minutes. Don't buy a tourist pass at the airport. We bought a MRT card from 7 eleven and put another $10 on it to give us $15 in total and that lasted us 4 days and we used the trains lots. Tip: if going to Sentosa catch train to Sentosa station then catch free monorail to and from
,,Taking local tranaport,5.0,,While this was exciting and fairly easy to negotiate I would recommend other means if available. We had about an hour wait as we had just missed the previous bus and it was standing room only when it arrived
,,Best transport system,5.0,,"Its actually the best transport system which i think every country should copy. Very clean, very efficient, on time, very safe, rapid and above all very affordable."
,,Clean and good,4.0,,Very clean and good. Sometimes long queue for purchasing ticket. Comfortable and well connected system.
,,The Singapore tourist pass is convenient to use but difficult to buy and return to get your deposit back.,1.0,,You have to buy at a ticket office. Our hotel was near Novena where the ticket office was never open. We had to buy a standard ticket and travel to Orchard. At Orchard the queue was long and very slow moving to buy the pass. We waited say 20 minutes. The ticket office is only open 8am to 8 pm. Then to get your deposit back you have to find a ticket office open. Then how do you get back to your hotel? All in all it cost me far too much money and time. Not recommended.
,,"efficient, economical, world class",5.0,,"A very efficient system that gets you around Singapore - and at economical prices too. One of the best systems in the world...clean trains, good signage, very short wait times, economical prices."
,,"Clean, fast and easy",5.0,,"We wanted to try the Singapore mass transit as much because we had heard so much about it as because we wanted to get somewhere, but we were definitely able to find our way once we got directions to the nearest station. The system is easy to buy tickets for and navigate, though you have to pay attention because there are a lot of ways to go. Great way to get around the city."
,,efficient MRT,5.0,,Very efficient and easy to navigate system! Best way to travel in Singapore. Convenient interchange with buses was also available.
,,Super easy to use,5.0,,Good coverage of city. Easy to use. Very good ticket vending machines with clear instructions and map.
,,Very clean and cheap to get around,5.0,,"Clean and modern transport system. Fares are cheap; purchased a transit card at the airport and topped up a few times during stay. Fares were cheap compared to European cities such as London.
There are less interchanges than other metro systems so a little planning is required to work out most efficient journey. Circle line is a little confusing as currently not joined up as a circle."
,,efficient and clean,5.0,,"Having your own car is not necessary in Singapore because of the excellent public mass transit system. Both the MRTs and buses are efficient, clean, on-time, and supplied with airconditioning -- a must-have in the hot and humid weather. The price is also cheaper compared to Europe and North America. What's more, MRT stations are surrounded by shops, eateries, and even malls so eating and shopping becomes even more convenient!"
,,One of the best public transport options,5.0,,"We really liked Singapore's MRT network. We bought our ezlink cards from the Changi airport MRT station. Each card costs $12 SGD ($5 non-refundable fees plus an initial load of $7 SGD) and is valid for 5 years(I believe). We managed to save a lot on Taxi fare by taking the MRT instead. The only downside is you have to walk a fair bit, and some interchanges are huge, you have to change platforms which can be a bit confusing for first time travellers, but there are directions to guide you. Good thing is the MRTs run quite frequently so never had to worry if we missed one. Overall it was a really good experience travelling by MRT."
,,Excellent value,5.0,,"If you need to get around Singapore in a hurry get on the MRT. The stations are clean, the trains are clean and the network is well documented. We used the tourist tickets which gave unlimited travel on the underground and buses. It made life easy but beware the tourist ticket starts at midnight on the day you buy it. So if you buy late in the day you don’t get good value."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,"Cheap, super efficient and easy to use. Helpful staff. Worth buying a ticket for a few days if you are staying longer in Singapore."
,,Awesome service!,5.0,,"Do not hesitate in using the MRT as a transportation to basically everywhere in Singapore. It is affordable, comfortable, safe and clean. Service is very adequate and will fulfill all of your transportation needs while in this beautiful city.
Tip: acquire a travel card at the airport. It costs 10 SGD plus the credit you may want to buy. Add credit as needed or if you will be traveling constantly you may want to consider the tourist card which allows you to travel everywhere for 3 days. At the end of your stay, just go back to the airport and return it to have your 10SGD back with you."
,,Easy and so clean,5.0,,"Wow i have to say this transport system is brilliant. Trains are immaculately clean, spacious and with fabulous air conditioning. We bought return tickets which cost Singapore Dollar3.80 which was incredibly cheap. The tickets can be reused and recharged up to 6 times with discount on the latter trip (s?) if you use them........puts the London Tube system to shame....simply brilliant!"
,,A Great way to get around,5.0,,"We were very impressed with the efficiency , cleanliness, price and frequency of the MRT in Singapore a great way to get to just about anywhere in the city ."
,,Clean reliable and economical transportation,5.0,,"Trains are always on time, clean and comfortable. The entry and exit spaces well marked and no one pushing to get on before you get off. Many other countries could learn from this example"
,,Were all the subway/metro systems like this,5.0,,"Clean, quiet, air conditioned. Trains all equipped with signs and audio systems to announce current stop and next station. Stations also spotless and well marked. But there are lots of escalators and sometimes long walks in the stations."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,The SMRT is an example for the rest of the world. This is what great public transportation should be. It's one of the best ways to get around Singapore efficiently and economically. Great job SMRT.
,,No aircon. Filthy cabin. Overcrowded.,1.0,,No aircon. Filthy cabin. Overcrowded for north South line and east West line. The red and green line mrt are old and aircon not working. And often down due to signal fault and train fault. AVOID Singapore MRT
,,So easy to use,5.0,,so easy to get around the city on this. I got the tourist pass which $30 dollars for 3 days unlimited travel on all MRT services which you get $10 back after the 3 days
,,Excellent Transport system,5.0,,"My first encounter with the Singapore MRT was truly amazing. In my humble opinion all countries should visit this and model their system on this one. Easy purchase of tickets, easy on and off at stations and FAST. Loved every bit of it and makes getting around Singapore a breeze. Maybe Taxis are worried about Uber, they will be worried about the MRT."
,,I don't like public transport....,5.0,,"But I have never used the SMRT before.

Wow, it is sparkling clean, on time, easy to access plus with the announcements and highlighted maps in each compartment, really difficult to get lost.

The staff at stations were helpful when I had difficulty buying my first ticket, when I was not quite sure how to top up my ticket the first time and when I asked which would be the best way to get to a destination.

Besides walking, SMRT is the most efficient and cost effective way to get around Singapore. Would not hesitate to recommend SMRT to anyone visiting Singapore."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Excellent transport. Efficient, cheap and extremely clean. We used taxis only twice in Singapore. Lifts everywhere as well."
,,One of the best systems,5.0,,"Clean, affordable, efficient, easy to use and punctual, what more could you ask for (and also cool!)

Tip: unless you are going to make several journeys, or particularly long ones, the tourist pass works out more expensive. Better option I found is to add credit and you get the discounted rate. Works out around $1 for most local single fares."
,,Singapore’s MRT,5.0,,The MRT is cheap and easy to use once you’ve tried. You can either by a stored value card (cost $5) or buy a single trip ticket that you can reuse up to 5 more times. Reuse gives you a 10c discount per trip. A return trip would be 2 trips. Travel cost us around $1.30 up to $1.80. The MRT run driverless trains and we didn’t have to wait any more than about 1-4 mins.

Well worth the 10 Singapore dollars from Orchard To Admiralty
,,So easy to get around,5.0,,"Saw a short video on how easy to get around on my so gave it a go.

One tip: If you're going to the light show at Gardens on the Bay (and you should), buy your return ticket on your way to the Gardens. The line after is huge."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Use to use and find directions. Very clean and quiet to get around Singapore. Get a pass at any station and tap in and out to get to your location.
,,Excellent transportation at a very reasonable price,5.0,,"Singapore has an excellent transportation system. As a tourist, Metro (MRT) brings very convenient transportation services, they are frequent and reliable. Payment is also very easy once you get the card (ez-link).

Buses also work fine allowing a view of the city on ground but there are slow (frequent stops and many traffic lights)."

,,Amazing experience !!!,5.0,,"I had taken a lot of feedback and research before homing on to the means of transport to commute in Singapore. The ultimate answer was MRT. And boy it lived upto its reputation. Almost every part of singapore is conveniently connected to MRT and the balance are further connected by buses and taxis. We got our smart card on the first day which came for SGD 12 per card of which SGD 5 is non refundable. We had booked the hotel next to the MRT station and kept the MRT map always ready in the pocket. Took MRT rides to almost every place- Bugis, Chinatown, Little India, merlion park to name a few. Thorough our 7 days stay we commuted by MRT and buses. Disciplined singaporeans further male you comfprtable and at home. Hats off to singapore for having such an amazing and convenient public transport which an outsider can also utilise like a local."
,,Excellent and efficient!,5.0,,Use the Metro in Singapore- it's fast and efficient. Buy a reloadable card which is valid for 5 years and load as you require.

,,Awesome!,5.0,,One of the best that i know... Very economical and safe. We had an infant and could manage his pram easily everywhere...
,,"Marvellous Infrastructure, Woeful Process",3.0,,"We were in Singapore for only a couple of days and only used the underground. The stations and trains are state-of-the-art and for locals with their passes or tourists staying for longer the access appears seamless, but for us requiring to pay as we travelled....nightmare. It takes ages to navigate your way through the automated ticket issue points and invariably there are anything from short to enormous queues. Often located in airless parts of the stations, this can be an ordeal. They have staff in former ticket booths whose only job it appears to be is to point to the automated ticket points. You need small denominations of cash and return tickets are a no-no as you seem to have to return within a certain period, ergo the same process at the start of each journey. On our first journey we thought we'd buy a multi-journey card....and they weren't available at our station (Rochor) Eh???!!!!!! What's the point of having such a marvellous railway and such a hopeless means of access to it? The touch sensitivity of the screens means we often hit the wrong station and had to start the whole process again. Surely the brains that can come up with such amazing infrastructure can think of a better process??"
,,Convenient,5.0,,"If you are a smart traveler you can definitely go places using the SMRT. A tourist card for 3 days costs 30S$ out of which 10S$ are refundable when u return the card. It can be used for trains or buses. Most malls are connected to the SMRT and we took the light rail to malls close to the attractions we wanted to visit and then took a taxi to the attraction.
Just plan in advance and allow time for transit. Some days we started late and just getting there took forever. Though we did save a lot of money.
Also of course if you are a family of four it might make more sense to get a taxi as you will be spending a lot on individual cards."
,,Never waited more than 5 minutes,5.0,,Singapore has excellent transport facilities The trainlines interchange so it is a matter of getting off and go to another platform to continue where ever you want to go.
,,Excellent Network,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT already has a massive network. It seems that, on one visit, I think ""Why isn't there an MRT line to here?"" and, on the next visit, there is. Just need a line to Changi village now."
,,"Great connectivity, almost to all places across Singapore",5.0,,"Almost connected to all places across Singapore, similar to the one in Bangkok. But I feel the planning of the city is awesome. And it is comfortable, reliable and one can depend on it without any worries."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,It is one of the easiest to learn and be familiar system of mass transportation in Asia. There are only a few routs separated by colors and all in English .
,,Great inter-connected public transport,4.0,,"Singapore's main public transport, the MRT has no doubt is well interconnected to the country's main attractions. Most of the time, the timing of the train is accurate and it doesn't take long for you to wait. There are many ticket counters which let you purchase tickets without hassle"

,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"We took the SMRT one time only, but it was super easy to use. There was an assistant at the machines to advise regarding payment and which line we needed for our destination. For cash payments it accepts only certain denominations, but there is a cashier if you need change. We stayed at Hotel Mi and the Bencoolen Station is a few steps away."
,,SMRT,4.0,,"Try to take the black,red and grey coloured train instead of the white and red coloured train, if you are not rushing for time, as the black, red and grey coloured train has a better air-conditioning system and not as noisy."
,,"Quick, clean, very efficient easy to use.",5.0,,"The hardest part was buying a ticket, the rest of the process was easy just like the tube in London but cleaner, bigger and more organised."

,,Great service for tourists,5.0,,"We got the 3 day tourist pass at Bugis MRT which allows 3 day’s unlimited travel. We topped up again for a further 3 day’s! The services are efficient, clean and friendly. The signs are posted in local languages as well as English. It is all so self explanatory that if you can read you are ready to go! Do not hesitate to use this service."
,,Punctual and Rider Friendly,5.0,,"The best public trabspo i have experienced by far. Clean, safe and more than enough carriages that can accommodate commuters. It gets crowded but not like in Japan."
,,A Bit Below Expectation,4.0,,"The MRT itself is very good but i found the systems around it are little lacking. The system is very well laid out with great sinage that make it easy to work out how to get where you're going and even customer service kiosks if you do get in trouble. The issue i have is the single trips tickets are cash only and we went to buy the tourist pass (which i recommend as the best option for tourists as it offers unlimited travel for SG$10 per day) only to find the ticket office didn't open until 12pm, not exactly useful for tourists. Ticketing aside i found it a very good and affordable way to get around. I would recommend trying to prepurchase the tourist pass at Changi as i believe the day starts after your first tap so you can buy it a head of time."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"Prob one of the best, easiest, clean and efficient underground systems I’ve ever used (and I’ve used a lot!)"
,,Efficient transport,5.0,,Clean cheap and quick method of travel aroind Singapore. I would recommend buying a day travel card so you don't have to recharge your card.

,,Surely some mistake,3.0,,"I have no idea why the MRT features in the top 10 things to do in Singapore. Are my fellow reviewers so devoid of imagination that they cannot find anything else to do in Singapore?
OK so it gets you around the city as you would expect. On time, frequent trains, air conditioned and reasonably priced. But no credit cards ? No $50 bills ? This is the city of the future ... ?"
,,Lots of use,4.0,,We used the MRT daily and enjoyed how clean and efficient the system is. Disabled accessible and very safe to maneuver around. Unfortunately it does not have enough seats in waiting areas which proved challenging. We have managed to see most of the island using public transport and hotel shuttle service for minimal cost
,,So convenient to travel around Singapore,4.0,,"For someone who does not go to Singapore very often, the SMRT is a very easy way to travel around the city state. The maps are easy to read so it is not difficult to navigate around the city. One has to be ready to walk quite a distance when transferring between lines. Otherwise, the transit is efficient and clean. People are orderly except for tourists who forget to stay at the left side on escalators."
,,"Clean, fast and easy way to get round",5.0,,"We found this to be the best way to get around - its easy. The trains and stations are very clean. Trains are frequent.

,,The best of the worst,2.0,,"SMRT manages NSL, EWL, CL & TEL of mrt network. The lines are okay but of late, it always break down with thousand and one reasons, and nothing is their fault.
Going around to places in Singapore with MRT is convenient but with the break down and inconsistent timing, making the travel a problem.
There are many gaps to improve in term of the human touch, schedule, smooth travelling, good pricing, etc..."
,,MRT is a world class transit system.,5.0,,"We have used the SMRT the last two trips when we want to travel during peak traffic times.
We arrived quickly and avoided the heat of the street level transit choices.
The system has customer service agents to assist and provide change to operate the automated ticketing system machines. Made it simple and fast.
The stations are well lit and and have a feeling of safety to me as a traveler.
Maps are easy to understand and accurate on routing and transfers."
,,"Good, fast, easy and safe",4.0,,The SMRT is safe and cleen. you can not fall to the tunnel because it is closed. Pretty simple to understand. The train frequency is excellent. They are quick and efficient. 2 minorities: You miss the view outside. you can't pay with 50 S$ bill.
,,Cheap and tourist friendly,5.0,,"MRT is really great, covering all major attractions in Singapore. Also its cheaper, better buy a card which you can keep on refilling. Colour coding helps to easily find the stations. Better keep a snapshot of route for easy reference"
,,Efficient way to get aroung,5.0,,"We used the SMRT to visit Singapore and it was the best in all our travels. Many new and modern stations, very clean and easy to get around."
,,Super!,5.0,,"Super clean, super easy, super speedy! The best way to get around Singapore and all the main attractions in Singapore have a MRT locates nearby."
,,Amazing Service!,5.0,,"As first time travelers to Singapore, my husband, myself and our two teenage children found getting around the city on the MRT was a breeze!

As soon as we arrived at Changi Airport, we each got ourselves an EZ-Link card. We were easily able to tap-on and tap-off all public transport. We found the buses quite confusing, but the MRT was so convenient, straightforward and simple to understand.

The trains were clean, fast and came every two minutes or so. Every time you got down to the platform, a train seemed to pull right up!

This is the best and most efficient train service I’ve seen anywhere in the world. It is truly a traveler’s dream!

Use nothing but MRT when getting around Singapore."
,,Great transfer with cheap price,5.0,,"When we arrived airport, we bought a card with price 10$ Sig to go to our hotel in China Town, we got introduction by staff at airport - they were friendly and helpful. Second day we visited other places by MRT, it was fast and easy to take. Much cheaper than taxi. Highly recommend to use MRT when you visit Singapore"
,,The best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is very comfortable way to travel, there is maps at every station next to the ticket machines, and MRT workers to accist you. Fast, easy, clean and air conditioned."
,,WOW unbelievable SMRT,5.0,,"This transport was one of many well supported ways to get around Singapore, Clean, Fast, User friendly and fare was a good price. leaves Australia way behind"
,,So easy to get around,5.0,,"If your visiting Singapore take advantage of the tourist travel cards available at the airport information desk. We bought a 3 day pass and you get unlimited travel on all public transport. Navigating the subway stops is half the fun.
NOTE: you cannot use these cards to travel to Sentosa island."
,,Travel of MRT,5.0,,"We took the MRT to the airport to pick up friends. Upon arrival of the station the MRT man went out of his way to help us get the correct route to the airport, how long it would take and the necessary transfers. The stations are very clean, and also very artistic as you pass through on the good directions offered. You will feel very safe."
,,You’ve got to be brain dead not to master this system..,5.0,,"I say you’ve got to be ‘brain dead” but I suppose that really only applies if you have a good knowledge of English, as the entire system is geared to that language; not Chinese, not Malay, not Tamil but English.

There is no doubt in my mind that it is the cleanest, quickest, best ordered and most efficient subway system in the world. As with everything, whatever the Singapore government sets out to do, it achieves.

The signposting - not only to the various subway station platforms, but also to the myrid of exits at busy junctions such as Orchard Road or Dhoby Ghat - are extremely well signposted and all you have to do is follow your nose.

Inside the carriages there is an ongoing commentary as to which station you have arrived at, which station you have left, which will be the next station, and how long it will take you to reach it. There is also a map on the wall with little flashing lights which lights up as you arrive at the station so you can’t possibly make a mistake as to which way you are travelling - or, if you do, you will find it out very quickly.!

On top of that, there is also a light which indicates which side of the carriage you will alight. Really, you couldn’t ask any more from a great well run efficient system!

I know it can be a bit intimidating entering a foreign countries subway system, particularly for the elderly, but take heart and walk down and go to the tourist ticket counter to purchase a one, two or three day pass and just enjoy the city.

The one issue I would point out - the escalators are slightly quicker than the ones you would be experiencing in a shopping mall or plaza, so be careful to jump on the right step at the right time, particularly if you are carrying a suitcase!

Oh yes- one last thing ; when you go up or down the escalators, and you don’t want to speed it up, stick to the left so other people come past you on the right.

Enjoy! Best and cheapest way to see Spore!"
,,Singapore Easy to Use Train System,5.0,,"We used the train system to get to many attractions.

The initial confusion quickly turned to confidence. The visitors cards allows you to use the system with a $10 refund once you have finished with the card.

The system itself is very efficient and we never waited more than two minutes for a train. Trains are so clean with plenty of room but don’t be surprised to find there is no driver the trains are automated and drive themselves.

Great way to see Singapore on limited time ."
,,"Excellent, Inexpensive and Easy to Use",5.0,,"SMRT busses and trains are excellent options to move around Singapore. Much cheaper than Uber or taxis. Very easy to use. Buy a Tourist Pass which will give you unlimited access to all types of transport for up to three days for about S$6.70 per day. Additional days can be added if necessary.
A particularly good way to get a feel for the city is to take one of the double decker busses (doesn’t really matter which one) and sit in the seats at the very front of the upper deck. You’ll get very good views of the city sights."
,,Extremely efficient subway system,5.0,,"Clean and efficient, the subway here is fast and consistently reliable. Don’t even think about eating or drinking or taking out candy or gum anywhere in the system. There are cameras everywhere and very high fees for any infringement at all. People line up in an organized fashion to get in and everyone is very polite. Very well marked in stations and in trains."
,,Great train system,5.0,,"I’m no train afficanado but this is one of the best underground train networks I’ve used.

It’s clean, efficient, the trains are more spacious than most underground ones, it has mobile coverage and Wi-fi.

It’s easy to find your way around as well.

If only they were all like this."
,,"Fast, clean, efficient, easy to navigate",5.0,,"Great train system. So easy to navigate. Super clean trains and minimal wait time between trains. Get yourself a MRT ez-link card, put a minimum $10 on it and just tap on and off at the gates. Super easy way for us tourists to get around in air conditioned comfort! Wish Melbourne would lift its game and have a system like Singapore."
,,One of the best underground MRT services I have used,5.0,,"Brilliant service from all we came in contact with, the system runs so efficient you wonder who is controlling it, trains are only a max of 5 minutes from each other, no need to rush, the entering and exiting the train is so well planned it is hard to fault, very positive experience."
,,Very clean,5.0,,This is by far the cleanest rapid transit I have been on. The cars are large and well lit. The maps are easy to read and the announcements are easy to hear over the speaker system.

,,"Punctual, organized and good maintenance.",5.0,,"How I wish we had something like this in my country!!!! The SMRT is cheap, fast and easy to use, accessible for everybody."
,,You can't get lost,5.0,,"There's map and guidance in every station. Also staff and visitor service area before you enter, that could help you. I used tourist card for unlimited ride in 3 days. Don't forget to avoid rush hour"

,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"MRT is the best and cheapest and fastest way of getting around the city. The driverless trains are a hoot, very well maintained and exceptionally cheap and reliable"
,,MRT Of Singapore is the best way to commute,5.0,,"MRT of Singapore is one if the cheapest way to commute around the city, however all the stations are underground so city view is missing. I got the MRT card for SGD Dollars 10, and got it loaded for 10 dollars extra. After a 4 day back to bacl usage my card still had 2 dollars. I covered Universal studios as well which costs sgd 4 dollars. The best way to use MRT is install an application of MRT map of Singapore so that you know where to go, without asking anyone. Secondly apart from MRT one can use the BUS option as well which gives a comfortable journey around the city along with a city view. Double deccar Buses where one can sit on the 2nd floor and enjoy the view. Note: MRT Passes is valid for local buses as well. Bus routes is easily accessible from Google maps and select travel by bus option from the top.
Have a safe and a happy trip."
,,Perfect in every way,5.0,,"If visiting Singapore or one , two or three days on a stopover one of you first jobs is to go to a station and buy a tourist pass. Ours for 3 days was $20 and a deposit of $10 for the card . For that you get unlimited travel of the Singapore ( tube). This tube is almost perfect no drivers so it runs like a train set so everything runs like clockwork. Maximum wait times a few minutes. Very simple to understand. It runs just below the surface so not a huge number of escalators to go down normally one or two. The whole system air conditioned. Perfectly clean and safe. In the heat you will use it more than you think."
,,Fabulous underground trains,5.0,,Used the train a lot and services most of Singapore. Buy a pass for 2 to 5 days is best way to go. also get the small plan of the network is very handy
,,Visitor friendly,5.0,,"This system is extensive, very clean and easy to navigate. Recommend getting a 3 day tourist card if you are planning to move around the city a lot during your stay."
,,Singapore's amazing train system,5.0,,"We used the train every day we were staying in Singapore. Trains are clean, on time, frequent. It was a very unique experience to be on a ""driverless"" train. There are customer service staff at most of the larger stations to help visitors purchase single use tickets or a pass which can be recharged. Totally the best way to get around in Singapore."
,,Amazing Transportation System,5.0,,"The singapore MRT is one the fastest way to go through the city, it is 3 times cheaper than the cabs . The only downside is that even if you want to go to a near location ,the charge is same as to go to a farther distance"
,,Don't miss the SMRT,5.0,,"Its cheap and easy. You get a travel card from vending machine according to route and persons. Use the card to enter the SMRT station. The routes are colour coded so wait by the red, green, orange or purple lined stations. A train for your route come every 5 or so minutes. The announcements are in English so it makes sure you catch the right one.
I simply loved this ride, it cut my journey from an hour to few minutes."
,,Very organized and well maintained,5.0,,We bought ticket for one week and traveled very frequently for 5 days. You must spend sometime to understand the route plan. Whole city is covered with SMRT and it is very affordable and convenient. There are self service kiosk available as well if you want to refill. Very neat and clean and well maintained. Overall i had a wonderful experience.
,,Use it and buy an EZLink card.,5.0,,"The card can be purchased at the airport or any 7-11. Cost is $10 at these locations which includes a $5 charge that is basically the cost of convenience although the charge for your trips is less using the card than buying from a machine for point to point trips. It can also be used on the bus system. You can top off at machines in $10 increments using SGD or credit cards. Card is good for 5 years so if you come back it is still valid. The system is like no other. So reasonable in cost, fast and makes it simple for a tourist to get around without getting flustered."
,,So efficient!,5.0,,"Best , cheap and easiest way to get around Singapore. It's very easy to follow with good signage and announcement s. We travelled many times at rush hour and no one pushed and shoved ,no one was ill mannered or loud. We bought the ez link card and just topped it up. Cheaper than the tourist 3 day card."

,,"Slick and efficient, but remember some cash",4.0,,"Easy to use, very clean, on-time underground service. The city can be navigated with simplicity.

Ticket machines are very easy to use in multi-language.

For single use tickets you must have cash (max. denomination of $10) to pay, for e-link Card credit / debit card top-ups can be performed.

Doesn’t have the character of the London Underground but what it lacks in that aspect it more than makes up for in cleanliness, personal space and efficiency.

A good way to navigate the city. To link to Sentosa get off at Harbour Front and transfer by foot to the Sentosa Express Monorail (separate ticket required) or you can walk via the covered boardwalk."
,,"Speedy, Cost Effective, Comfortable and Passenger Friendly",5.0,,"SMRT criss crosses the entire city: east-west as well as north-south by several lines like green, red, yellow. It connects airport with the city and touches almost every corner. The bus service is also coordinated with SMRT. The lines move underground as well as overground. The resultant sound is too negligible to cause any problems to people and environment. The SMRT deals with myriads of passengers daily. They take special care of the senior citizens. The time management and traffic discipline are commendable. The SMRT officials at different points and counters are courteous and helpful."
,,outstanding!,5.0,,"Clean, convenient, easy to navigate. Save yourself time and money and use the MRT. It's a great subway system."
,,Why does Australia do public transport so badly??,5.0,,"How refreshing to go into a foreign country and work out their public transport system in about 2 minutes when I still haven't been able to do that in Brisbane, my state capital. Once you get into the Singapore CBD talk to an MRT employee, get a card and go. Absolutely brilliant.."
,,Fast and efficient way to traverse Singapore,4.0,,"The system is very well organised. The signages are good and the announcements are quite crips and clear. Make sure you plan your journey by familiarising the route and stations to change over to the different lines. The fares are cheap and the coaches clean
(courtesy of steep fines). Only drawback is the long lines of people waiting to buy their tickets at the few ticketing machines (as evidenced on a Saturday night at the MRT station by the Marina Sands)."
,,This was great and convenient,5.0,,I liked to travel and maximum city journey I did through SMRT. This is well connected with Sentosa and Universal.
,,Only way to travel!!!!,5.0,,OMG!! Best experience ever ... we have become SMRT junkies.... very well signposted and super cheap... should be in every capital city!!!!
,,So easy,5.0,,"If you want economical and convenient, this is the way to get around. For the tourist it is simple enough to grasp and is near the hotels and all major attractions."
,,"Reliable, fast, clean and cheap",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is easy to use and well priced. Purchase an MRT card from any station at a machine. The card itself costs $5 and it is then yours to keep and top up to use on trains and buses. There are also single use tickets available for purchase, but it is far more economical to get the card. Maps are located in each station and it is easy to interchange between the different colored lines."
,,"Clean, cheap and efficient",5.0,,"I love Singapore's MRT. Oh the joy of timely, speedy, air conditioned and cheap travel. The network keeps expanding so getting Singapore by MRT is getting even easier."
,,What an excellent way to travel!,5.0,,"We don't have an MRT system where we live, and we are not used to traveling this way. The Singapore MRT system is so easily laid out and organized. It's very efficient, clean and dependable, let alone how reasonably priced this way of travel is...."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,Excellent fast services by bus and train to everywhere. The ideal way to get around Singapore. The tourist travel card is fantastic value.
,,Best way to commute,5.0,,Singapore MRT is the easiest and cheapest way to commute between places. I went for the three days tourist pass which costs S$38 in which one can travel to anywhere in Singapore unlimited times not only in SMRT but LRT and Buses as well. This pass also helps avoiding the long queues at ticketing counters.
,,Best transport facility,5.0,,20 $ ..3 days unlimited travel on trains and buses..what else can we ask for..we went to jurong and Night safari through subway and bus all females and it was absolutely safe and convenient..Singapore tourism is superbly supported by Mrt no need of cabs..
,,"Excellent, effective, efficient!",5.0,,"I paid 38 Singapore dollars for a 3 day unlimited tourist pass to use public transport in Singapore including the MRT.

The MRT is clean, and the service is incredibly streamline. Everything is well organised and there is no chaos like you would experience with the London tubes for example.

People wait at the sides of the door ways for people to clearly get off and on to the train. There are priority seats which I witnessed an elderly person hush a younger person off so do stay clear of those seats and let them be used for their desired audience.

The carriages are clean and spacious. The great thing I found is that the voice over is also in English which is really helpful. The train lines also light up to show you what stop you are at and what stop is next. It also lights up to show what side the doors will be opening.

This is a very simple, clear, organised travel solution which i have found impressive and easy to navigate without much thought and attention to the routes!

You have to experience it! Puts our London Underground to much shame!"
,,easy,5.0,,"Great way to get around. Easy ,cheap and fast. Lot's of different stops so you should never be to far away from one."
,,Nice & easy,5.0,,"Very nice & easy way to get around singapore ..
You can just get a map of the different lines ..
Locate your nearest station ..
Then it’s easy to figure out how to reach where ..

You can either get a card for the different public transports in singapore that you recharge ..
I wasn’t staying for a long time so I just bought a ticket whenever I was riding ..
The ticket you buy from a machine ..
You just choose the station name you’re heading out to .. it then tells you the price and you pay either cash or credit card ..
Don’t throw the ticket away though..
You can recharge it up to 5 or 6 times ..

It is wheelchair accessible"
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,Best transport system I have ever seen. Tourist can buy the 3 day tourist pass and it will allowed to travel unlimited times in 3 days.
,,The Singapore metro is excellent,5.0,,"the Singapore metro is excellent, you practically move with it all over the city. Many stations connect to malls and buildings. The price is great. One tip for arriving by plane is to take the subway, the station is connected to the airport."
,,Inexpensive and convenient,5.0,,"Singapore has an excellent MRT system which every tourist just has to use. Most rides come for about 2 dollars and equivalent distance by taxi would be 10 to 12 dollars at least. The EZ link card is a good investment. The card costs $12 - $5 for the card and $7 which can be used for travel on the MRT or by bus. However, you need to top-up when the value goes below $3 and the lowest top-up value is $10. The card is valid for 5 years and any money remaining in the card can be refunded even at the airport. The cost of the card ($5) cannot be refunded."
,,Excellent mode of public transport,5.0,,"Singapore is an excellent example of civilians using the public transport effectively. you wouldn't need your own car, you have public transport like SMRT everywhere. Every 4 minutes there is a train. Great system."
,,Why pay for a taxi?,5.0,,"In a taxi u can pay $50.00 to get from the airport to, say, orchard road. Why do that when u can ride MRT and pay $2.40. Takes a few minutes to figure it out, then u will say ""why did i ever use taxis?? Efficient and fast!"
,,Great Transport,4.0,,"We visited Singapore for a quick 2 day visit. This is a great way of getting from the airport to the city and a quick way of getting around. Cheap, ontime and safe. Would highly recommend"
,,Wish we had found it earlier,5.0,,"Once we discovered how easy it was to get around Singapore on the SMRT we wished we had found it sooner. Really easy to navigate. It is all air conditioned and covers all the major areas in Singapore. We even considered using it to get to the airport but our cases were so large we thought better of it. We went from Orchard City to the Botanic Gardens, to China Town, Clarke Quay and back to the hotel. So simple and a joy compared to the London Tubes."
,,Metro ride in Singapore,5.0,,"The travel with Metro is very convenient,easy & comfortable.The station staff is also very helpful,otherwise every where the directions of exit along with the nearby market is mentioned.The routes of up & down trains are clearly displayed."
,,Exceptionally Good,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is Singapore 's lifeline- The veins through which the human flood flows to keep the city's heart pumping.

The frequency is maximum of 6-7 minutes and the trains are rarely delayed.

Spacious seats and air conditioned, eating is strictly not allowed on the train and is subject to penalty.

Every compartment has a route map and the in- train announcements are in multiple languages which is helpful.

The connectivity is the best feature with most of the city conveniently serviced. Rates are affordable and there are malls and convenience stores, even markets adjacent to MRT stations making shopping easy.

A 6/5 service."
,,"Convenient, Efficient, Effective",5.0,,"What you could ask for more? Singapore has the most convenient, effective and efficient public transport and we called it MRT. They have a very helpful and friendly staff that work with their heart. They might improve the cleanliness on their MRT toilets on certain area. Keep up the good works! Thanks SMRT!"
,,Easy n affordable,5.0,,This was my first visit abroad where I travelled by myself n not guided by anyone... Singapore is the safest country I believe even of you're a gal n travelling alone.. We took the mrt card as soon as we reached Changi International Airport and travelled throughout via mrt n best part is that mrt card can also be used for the buses.. it's quiet safe n comfortable to travel by mrt Dan by taxi since its damn expensive
,,"clean, safe and fast",5.0,,"Clean, safe and fast. Economical. Clear directions. friendly people and staff. Frequent trains. Good connections. Hardly use the cab."
,,So quick and easy.,5.0,,The cost of travel in Singapore is so inexpensive. Clean comfortable and easy to follow routes enable you to get quickly around the places of interest in the city. Wish all public transport in big cities was this agreeable to travel on.
,,Fantastic subway!,5.0,,Buy a value card for ten sgd and travel with ease around Singapore. Clean and safe transportation from all connections.
,,Top notch,5.0,,I love the public transport system in Singapore. It just WORKS. As an Australian (and a Brisbanite) a train coming every 4 minutes is amazing !!!! Well done Singapore !
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"It was easy to use and find where you need to go, especially if your going from the airport. It was fast and clean trains. Takes you to all the places you want to go."
,,"Easy, not expensive, fast and convenient - SMRT",5.0,,"Clean, easy, safe, inexpensive, fast and enjoyable method of transport. SMRT staff was very helpful in guiding me how to book tickets at the kiosk and will tell you the easiest and fastest route from one place to another"
,,"efficient, clean and fast",5.0,,"loved the metro travel... so clean, fast and cheap.. u need to get a ez-link card and then keep topping it up at the station kiosks. we bought our cards from the changi recommends counter at the airport and then cancelled them b4 leaving Singapore and got back whatever money was in it.. so thats a good deal... But u dont need it for small kids those below 100cm. the metro is super fast and there are priority seats for mothers with young chuildren, pregnant, handicapped etc.. and ppl and so kind and forthcoming to give up the seats for the same too.. we took the metro all around Singapore.. didnt miss the traffic in taxi rides one bit :).."
,,So efficient and easy to use,5.0,,"This is a great way to get around Singapore attractions if you don’t like tours.
We got an ez-link card because the tourist passes are limited to a number of days that didn’t suit us. We used it from the airport, 3 days sightseeing, and back to the airport on the 5th day. In total it cost $17 which is fantastic value. We also used it on buses.
The MRT itself is very clean, efficient and mostly not crowded. Every station has multiple exits so it pays to check which exit is closest to where you are visiting. There are local maps showing all exits at every station if you don’t have a map app. Interchanges were mostly coordinated so there are no long waits between trains and when we went to the Jurong Bird Park the train was coordinated with the bus
There is no issue understanding where you are as everything is in English as well as other languages"
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"Very accessible, easy to use and reliable. Also great value with a pre-purchased EZ-Link stored value card. We were able to go anywhere we wanted to at any time at low cost. Excellent!"
,,Just perfect,5.0,,Easy access to the sightseeing of Dingapoe. You dont need to ask anyone.Just hold the MRT map and follow the instructions in it and the arrows in the station.You can buy ezlink card which is much cheaper than to pay for every ride.
,,Highly efficient,4.0,,"We had just arrived in Singapore and checked in to our hotel. Very keen to explore during our limited time, the light show at Marina Bay Sands was recommended. To get there we had to take the SMRT. It was as easy and efficient and an amazing experience. The trains are spotless and the subway fully airconditioned. Coming from a country with no public transport, we found it very easy to use and even travel further to Newton Food Centre and back again. When we were unsure, there were staff to help who were extremely friendly and efficient. The best way to travel in Singapore."
,,Amazing,4.0,,"The SMRT is easily accessible, clean and safe. We use it all the time when in Singapore. It is a bit expensive, however it’s better than taking a taxi."
,,It’s the best!,5.0,,"Ultra modern and not too confusing. I’m sure it gets crowded but I haven’t experienced that. People in Singapore have great manners though so even when it gets crowded people behave themselves. Trains are comfortable, quiet, and you never have to wait too long. This is how to do mass transit RIGHT!"
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,Getting around using Smrt is really easy. You can get anywhere using the transport system. Highly recommend using to find your way around.
,,Clean and reliable,4.0,,I was impressed by how clean and well maintain is the system. People respect indications and the service is punctual
,,Easy to get around,4.0,,"The signs are in English and easy to read. Relatively clean, and can get very crowded during rush hour."
,,"Very clean, but awkward to buy tickets",4.0,,"This has got to be the cleanest subway in the world. 10/10 on this front.
However we found it awkward to buy a ticket. The machine didn’t accept cards or notes above a certain value. The help desk wasn’t able to give us change so we had to get change from a food kiosk.
As soon as we had the tickets it was super efficient."
,,Travel on the Island,5.0,,"The underground train is called the MRT. It has 5 main lines 3 of which are stantard directional North/South, East/West and North/East. The other 2 lines one of which crosses the other lines this is the Circle Line the other the Downtown Line is sort of a North/East line that covers the areas the areas the main 3 lines don't. Tickets can be purchased at any station and if you purchase a Top Up ticket you can add as much credit as you require. The cost to travel on one line from one end to the other less than SGD 3. Peak hrs are busy this is 7 - 10 am and 5- 6pm. Trains are usually every 4-5 mins and 2-3mins in peak hr. Handicap and strollers friendly, lifts and escalators and no height diff between platform and train. Dedicated locations on train for wheel chairs and seats for seniors and pregnant women. People will give their seats to elderly or parents with babies and toddlers. Trains run 6am - 12 midnight. Trains are super clean and air conditioned. Stations usually located under shopping centres or entrances of locations e.g. Botanic Gardens. All trains end up at bus depots. Only way to travel."
,,Clean and easy to use,5.0,,Singapore mass transit is clean and easy to use. If you have questions there is staff a available to help. Definitely the way to travel around the city.
,,Singapore Metro System,5.0,,"Very clean, no sign of litter anywhere, either on trains or in stations. Very easy to use and relatively cheap system, e.g. From the Promanade to the Botanical Gardens 3.50 return. Trains and stations are clearly labelled and trains are frequent and punctual. Ticket purchase from machines is simple and in many languages including English. Change is given from machines when tickets are bought, tickets can be topped up, up to 6 times for a discount. Overall, a very pleasant experience and locals very willing to provide advise if asked."

,,clean and easily navigable,5.0,,"Singapore boasts one of the world's best transport system and today I learnt why. So clean and well maintained. I only used it twice but loved it. Don't spend in cabs if you have a knack to learn about city, go use their public transport"
,,Fantastic transport,5.0,,"Fast to move around Singapore. Safe, clean on time, and reasonablly priced. I recommend to everyone."
,,very comfortable,5.0,,I have experienced metro in many countries but was definitely very impressed by Singapore's MRT.The service is absolutely comfortable with frequent trains with almost no waiting time.There wasnt a huge crowd on the the trains so comfortable seating is possible.I was a bit skeptical about using MRT from Changi Airport to my hotel because of luggage but I could comfortably travel wthout any difficulty even with my luggage.Thanks to Singapore MRT.

,,Fast and reliable,5.0,,"We have used the north-south line and the north-east line. Passes are very affordable. Trains are clean, convenient, fast and reliable. What more can you ask for?"
,,Best way to go,5.0,,"A very efficient way to go almost everywhere in singapore nice clean fast train and subway also the cheapest way to go.
A grab taxi from the gardens to our hotel was $13S at night and the mrt cost $3.20 for both of us and took same time it would have by taxi."
,,Excellent system,5.0,,"Excellent rapid rail transit system. Extensive network; modern, fast, frequent trains. Very cheap fares. Vital for large population movement."
,,Cheap and easy to use.,5.0,,We used the MRT to get just about everywhere. We refilled our tickets based on price of round trips we did. Fairly intuitive and inexpensive.
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,So easy to use and navigate. Safe form of transport. Can go anywhere. A must to experience when in Singapore
,,Well oiled machine,5.0,,The MRT in Singapore is clean efficient and well linked. It is well used but not overcrowded. One of the most efficiently run networks I have used anywhere in the world.
,,Still a reliable mode of public transport,4.0,,"Having experienced the public transport infrastructure in other countries, I am still very grateful for SMRT. There are plenty of stations all over the island that can be easily connected. There are also regular train services during off-peak hours so you never have to wait more than 8 minutes. Be prepared to squeeze a little during rush hour, but if everyone is gracious enough it's not a problem at all."
,,Good connectivity across the city!,5.0,,"All you need for using this is a smart card (which also works in buses and some taxis) and a map to know your route! The MRT has stops at most tourist places such as Marina Bay, city centre, etc. and it is usually not very crowded. The frequency is rather good and usually connects to the bus stops as well! Since Taxis are expensive, its good to use this transport while in Singapore."
,,Good one to escape Singapore traffic,4.0,,"Planned well in some areas, in some areas connectivity is not that great. If u wanna escape traffic u have to opt this. Overall good one with clean trains"
,,Best way to reach every place in Singapore.,5.0,,On every MRT station you will find a clearly explained about the rote. You may ask at the information desk and you'll get a competent answer. The use of the MRT is perfect organized. Best way to discover Singapore.
,,The most effective and economic means of transport in Singapore,4.0,,SMRT with city bus service could be availed in a single Tourist Pass and it is economic and helps in avoiding ques for tickets. The complete network is well organised and facilitates a traveler to travel safely and securely on time.
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Easy and clean, I still give Japan number one, but this is clean and easy to nevigate, we bought a 3 day pass, for 30 dollars , unlimited rides, and when you return card you get 10.00 back, well worth it, then looking for change to buy tickets, swipe and go, wooo hoooo"
,,Fast,5.0,,"The Singapore rail system so easy to use we had 4 days in Singapore so we got a 3 days rail pass went everywhere using the rail , so clean , no graffiti, not many seats on trains but it's so quick u really don't need to sit , the escalators at the station are very quick and lots of ppl using don't stop walking we would definitely use the system again and remember to take your card back they give u $10 if u return the card."
,,Ok if you aren’t in a rush,4.0,,"This is grand for getting about the city if you aren’t in a rush. As you aren’t allowed to eat or drink on board(DONT AS YOU GET FINED) it’s impeccably clean and runs like clockwork. We took this a lot and as my title suggests if you are out for a leisurely dander with no fixed time you are grand however it does take a while to get anywhere. We booked the tiger brewery tour for 1 o’clock and left at 11.15 thinking we had plenty of time to go approx ten miles - we ended up being 5 mins late even with getting a taxi from the joo koon stop.
Very reasonably priced tho in comparison to the London Underground so would use again if no fixed time."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"The fastest and easiest way to get around the island, similar system to the London Underground but with fewer lines, the whole experience was very friendly and efficient"
,,Using the MRT with ease & certainty........,4.0,,"I take the MRT regularly. Have read many reviews about unclear issues regarding using the MRT & has seen/assisted many tourists as well.

Just hope the following clarifications will be helpful in clearing these common doubts & uncertainties.

1. Although a tourist pass may seems a good deal, it may not be the best or cheapest, unless one travels extensively within that period ( but fares are cheap)

Better to buy an EZ link card (stored value card), which almost all locals are using. It cost $12 ($7 value & $5 for the card). It last for 5 years but non-refundable). You get huge fare discounts if connecting to a bus after an MRT ride or vice versa(within a period- think it's within an hour ).

Just top up the value at ticket machine when low. Fares using EZ link card are discounted ( compared to single tickets). One will get back the $5 cost very quickly with the discounts.

An EZ linkcard also save lots of time & hassles queuing for single tickets everytime. Just tap & go. That simple & fast.

EZ link cards are available at all ticket counters found in most major stations, esp in city areas.
Can be used for buses too.

2. Many tourists tried slotting in $10 bills for single tickets purchase. The notes keep coming out. Note only $2 & $5 notes are accepted for single ticket purchases. But you can use $10 or $50 for EZ link card top ups.

3. Every MRT station has lifts & escalators. Just look for the lifts location signs above.

4. When using escalators, always stand on the left side. Right is for overtaking for those who needs to go fast.

5. All stations & trains are fully air-conditioned. Read some reviews which wrongly mentioned not all are.

6. There are usually more than 1 way to go to any destinations. Get a free pocket size MRT map from any passenger service counter or download an MRT map.

Some apps do the work for you - it chooses the fastest routes or least transfers routes by just keying in the destinations ( eg Singapore MRT app). See photos.

Or look through your next day schedules & do a little study to determine the shortest routes. Saves alot of 'unnecessary' long traveling time by taking the longer ( wrong) way and extra fares cost.

7. Fare cards are electronically programmed. Did see tourists unable to enter or exit barriers due faulty cards. Just go to the passenger service counter. They will reset your card.

8. If one taps the farecard & decided to come out from same station for whatsoever reasons, minimum fare will still be charged.
If unsure, just go to the passenger service counter to ask first(accessible inside & outside the fare stations)."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,Simple easy to use and great value well worth getting this sorted before you do anything else It does combine with good bus transport
,,SMRT experience.,4.0,,"Took MRT instead of taxi for the experience and it was rewarding, as when automated ticket vending machine didn't fork out ticket,we approached the staff at the nereby office and without any questions refunded .70 SGD which we asked. Surely appreciated."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,What a wonderful transport system this is. The stations are so clean and so easy to use. Tickets are simple to buy- put in your destination and a map shows you where it is and how much to pay. The trains are on time and glide into the station to perfectly stop at the doors on the platform. Driverless trains. A very smooth ride.
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,"The MRT was very fast, reliable, trains every 7 minutes. You can purchase a tourist 3 day pass for $20 which was great to get around."
,,MRT,4.0,,always clean and comfortable travel. Easy to move about Singapore as major shopping areas have mrt stations.
,,Best Mode of Travel,4.0,,"Great way to travel fast through the city. The metro avoids traffic, is easy to navigate and is very reliable. I would advise you to buy the tourist pass card, which allows you unlimited trips on the city busses and the metro for up to 3 days."
,,Singapore's pride and glory!,5.0,,Will get you most of the places that a tourist needs to get to. Clean and efficient and staff are ready to assist tourists and locals with any service related questions.
,,Trip from cable car to Orchard Road,5.0,,The MRT is the cleanest metro system I have used the tickets can be purchased in the stations and are sold by zone we payed 3 Singapore dollars for a ticket from the bay up-to Orchard road.
,,Efficient,5.0,,"So quick ,clean ,easy to use ,great visitors pass ,best way to get round Singapore,felt safe ,plenty of trains"
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"Loved travelling around Singapore on the MRT, its easy, clean and efficient. Love how you load the exact amount of the cost of the trip on your ticket so no wasted money left at the end of your visit to Singapore. The most we waited for a train was 4 minutes ......"
,,Tickets,4.0,,Love the SMRT. However had a problem with the ticketing. As a tourist ATM gives S50's. The machines won't take foreign credit cards and the service agents won't give small change. We only had a S10 note to buy tickets and had to give a good arguement to get some change. In spite of that the travel with it is great.
,,Excellent system,5.0,,No problems getting around Singapore on this tube system. Easy to buy tickets at the self service machines (just follow the instructions) Beautifully clean and efficient service. : )
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"We loved it because it was easy to find your way to your destination. Clearly sighs posted. Ticket vending machines easy to use. The trains themselves are spotlessly clean and comfortable.
Perfectly safe to use. Singaporeans always helpful if you are not sure, so just ask if you have problems. Also cheap. You can buy a card for more trips if you wish."
,,Annoying tickets,4.0,,"I loved the MRT in Singapore; very fast and it comes very often, The one thing that I felt was lacking was the tickets. Many people told us we could get a Tourist pass but we knew that we wouldnt be using the MRT that much. So we ended up just getting standard tickets and refilling them at every station. This was a very slow and annoying process. ALSO those ticket machines only take S$5 and $2 notes. they also take coins. No credit card availability for US credit cards . Overall, great system"
,,Amazing way to travel!,5.0,,"Spent 5 days in Singapore, the underground system is second to none! Totally efficient, clean, plenty of space, highly organized, very easy to follow, helpful and pleasant staff when required, able to move freely in the cool and above all reasonably priced and the saver deals were freely offered. Simply the best way to travel when in Singapore!"
,,Awesome value,5.0,,"This is a system that is as good as the one we're used to from Switzerland. Actually, only cleaner... This is a great way to get around Singapore. Safe, easy and affordable! The staff could be a tad bit friendlier, but all in all it's just a great system in place in a great city!"
,,An afternoon trip from Fort Canning to Bayfront,5.0,,"Brilliant experience, clean and efficient and not expensive. Signage easy to follow though only a modest facility for change at the ticket machines."
,,One of the best and most efficient transport systems in the world,5.0,,"The title says it all. The contradiction is that to stay great they expand non-stoping, turning the city into a very large construction site. But hey, the result is great."
,,Probably the best transport system in the world,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, clean, air conditioned and on time! Clean toilets at all stations too along with lifts, stairs and escalators. No other transport needed to get around the city. Also cheap"
,,Efficient and clean,5.0,,Great transportation to get you round Singapore and very reasonable. Very clean and they are great at helping you with directions if you need help. Much faster than driving.
,,great way to get around,5.0,,A great way to get almost anywhere in the country. Directions are very clear and easy to follow. Get the travel card. It can be used on both the buses and trains
,,One of the best metro in the world,5.0,,"How easy. Safe. Reliable. On time. Reaching all destinations. And affordable.
People are nice and considerate
No garbage and clean trains.

Two examples. Train stations are secured by glass fence and doors. Nobody can fall. Be pushed on the tracks. Nobody can step and get lost items. And no gargGe on tracks. Hence no delayes due to fire like in NYC.

Second: reliable Wifi all the time. Everywhere. How cool is that ?"
,,So easy,5.0,,"Navigation was easy - so clean as no food is allowed and of course there is the ""no chewing gum in Singapore"" thing. Loved the way the map lit up on the station you were coming up to so you knew where you were. Much cheaper than a taxi!"
,,Easy and Efficient,5.0,,It is so easy to travel on the MRT. The maps and stations are clear. Announcements on the trains are also clear and connections are easy. Just a bit of walk in some stations but nothing difficult.
,,great Way to get around,5.0,,"Used the MRT for our way to get to Clarke's Quay. It was fast, efficient and safe. What a great transit system. The staff helped us find our way as this was our first time to use this transit system. Just look for the Service counters or approach one of the ticket vending machines and there was a helpful person there ready to get you to where you wished to go. I wish that there were more of this kind of service on other cities transit lines. Singapore MRT knows how to do it!!"
,,It works!,5.0,,"If you are from the UK (or most other countries, I suspect) a public transport system that works and is safe etc is a marvel in itself! But it really does work and it's pretty cheap even for longer distances. Tourists can get almost anywhere on it and it is pretty easy to use. Unless you are going to make a LOT of journeys (>5 per day) the tourist day passes are probably not good value for money."
,,Wonderfully efficient and user friendly,5.0,,"This service has grown significantly and continues to expand over the years. Easy to use, inexpensive, clean, comfortable and timely is how I would describe it. The growing network makes getting to and fro a real treat and connects anyone to the whole of Singapore. The MRT Stations are disabled and wheelchair friendly and that will even put the London Tube to shame. I have never ceased to be amazed by the MRT."
,,Best transportation mode in SG,5.0,,Best way to travel within SG city. It’s even more easy if you pick up an ez-link card. The same card can be used in the SBS transit buses too. Top up of card is very easy and so is using the MRT.
,,Cheap and Convenient Mode of Transport,5.0,,"One of the best INFRASTRUCTURE in Singapore is its Mass Rapid Transit , there are 4 Underground Metro Lines , one above the other which connects you to anywhere in Singapore.

We use this to travel to Gardens by the bay from Orchard road somerset station as every mall has underground metro station which you can use to travel anywhere in Singapore. Plus it is really cheap and convenient if you compare with taxis.

A must experience for every traveler to Singapore."
,,Great way to get around in Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT is efficient, clean & a great way to get around, avoiding traffic. The stations often have toilets & have clear maps of the station & network, recommend using.

We have been visiting Singapore annually for several years & got an EZ-Link card, same as what residents use. We put some $ on & used on the SMRT & bus, good for 5 years. More info available on the EZ-Link website. If you are a regular visitor, this may be a better option than the Tourist cards."
,,Really efficient,5.0,,What a great way to get around the City. The MRT is clean quick and efficiently run. Covering the whole island by train or bus you buy a card and top up as you need to. Similar to the Oyster card in London.
,,They Do It Well,4.0,,"It is clean, well signed, easy to use for foreigners and runs on schedule with frequent service and lines to get you all over Singapore. It is nearly as good as the japan system."
,,Why do u need Cab,4.0,,It's fast & may take u to almost any attractions in Singapore. It's just the interconnecting line is just too confusing. People in MRT r really sensetive towards seat offerings.
,,Great on time service,5.0,,"So cheap and easy to get around Singapore, we just paid as we went using the same card. Service ran every 4 mins didn’t have to wait long, and clean."
,,Easiest way to get around,5.0,,"The MTR is excellent, clean and very punctual. Easy to use with the tourist cards and the quickest way from A to B in Singapore. It was a treat to use and experience how clean stations and trains can be if everyone took a little more care"
,,Efficient and clean,5.0,,"Experienced a very efficient transport system with quick turnaround of trains. Clean stations, including toilets."
,,Great Way to Get Around,5.0,,"During our recent visit to Singapore we used the MRT to go from the cruise terminal to our hotel and to the airport. Since all the MRT stations have elevators it is possible to take your suitcases with you.

The last time I went to Singapore, I used the tourist pass but it was not available for sale where the ship docked. Instead we used the single tickets, as they can be bought at all the MRT stations at the machines. I found that using the single tickets was cheaper than the pass anyway.

It is very economical and convenient to use the MRT system as the system works very well."
,,Ease of use,5.0,,"We used the rail system and I think it is one of the easiest to use anywhere in the world.Very clean, fast and reliable and cost effective,if staying in Singapore this is one of the best ways to get around,and staff are very helpful to guide you around."
,,Efficient and Easy to use,4.0,,"For first timers, this is a very convenient way to get around the city centre. However, there may be long walks for transfers from one line to another. On this visit we preferred to use the bus system and that also proved very efficient with the only inconvenience of the bus stops not providing the air conditioning provided in the MRT system."
,,The best travel service by far,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is by far the best travel service. The trains are all on time, well located, very cheap to use around town and clean. Other cities should really take notes from Singapore's MRT... very easy to use as well."
,,convient and cheap,5.0,,easy and inexpensive pay per ride system - you book some credits on the ezlink card and little fare is deducted when leaving the station area
,,"Clean, organised, regular and easy to get",5.0,,"We bought a $7 card and then topped it up during our six day stay in Singapore. The travel around the city was cheap, pleasant, perfectly clean compartments, safe and all round excellent way to travel around the city."
,,Efficient subway system,4.0,,"The MRT subway system is very efficient, fast, well organized and not expansive. It goes to most places of interest in Singapore , with the exception of the Zoo."
,,So Simple,5.0,,"Such an easy way to get around. Struggled slightly to start trying to buy tickets from the machine, took a while to figure out what we needed and then it wouldn't take our brand new notes so had to go get change. There was a very helpful assistant who showed us what to do.
The actual transit system was extremely easy to understand and use. Naturally comparing it to the London Underground I found it so much better and less crowded."
,,Very convenient transport,5.0,,"I purchased easy link card at Changi airport to use in MRT (Singapore metro), remember they accept cash Singapore dollars only. Later payment for top up in card can be done by credit card or online also. Very safe and convenient to travel and same card will be used in bus also."
,,Easy navigation.,1.0,,"In a recent visit to Singapore, we used their train system and found it o be extremely easy to understand and get to our desired location within minutes. Also, the personnel were very helpful whenever we needed directions or assistance obtaining tickets."
,,Unreliable,1.0,,Breaks down often n they will close early. Getting to their shuttle buses are mediocre at best. You have take a long trip to get their shuttle.
,,World best city transfer,5.0,,"Such an amazing transfer through the city..just 10 mins walkable from Amy place.. I strongly recommend Singapore 6-7 days visit, you really enjoy."
,,Great way to get around - try to avoid Orchard interchange though,5.0,,Great way to get around Singapore. It’s all linked up to major tourist areas. Cost effective as well. Try to avoid orchard interchange if you can - it’s just a massive underground maze!!!
,,Efficient and effective,5.0,,"I have spent 2 days so far riding the MRT. With a 3 day tourist pass covering trains and buses, it is easy and cheap to get about. A map helps, and take time to read the signage."
,,Easy to use cheap and clean,5.0,,Recommend using the mrt it is pretty cheap easy to get to places and station staff are helpful if your not sure and the trains are clean and safe great way to get around Singapore
,,Really difficult to buy tickets!,3.0,,"The SMTR is a great way to get around and not expensive. The only issue is buying a ticket in the first place. You have to use a machine which is touch screen and very slow and on a couple of occasions, the touch screen really didn't work. At Lavender there were 4 members of staff in the booth but not one of them was able to sell tickets...so we waited in line for 15 minutes instead. The machines also only give you change up to the value of Sing $ 4 which is also not great. Sort out the buying of tickets and this will be excellent!"
,,"Convenient, easy to use and reasonably priced",5.0,,"We purchased the EZ-Link card for $12 and added another $10 to the card. All the tourist sights we wanted to we next to MRT stations. Fellow passengers were very helpful and friendly. During rush hour times when the cars were standing room only, many people offered theirs seats, even women. Wow, that says a lot about Singaporean people respecting elders!"
,,CLEAN!,5.0,,Cleanest transit system I have ever been on. Always on time...just remember no eating or drinking in the stations or on the train!! Easy to use and get around. Can buy a 3 day tourist pass.
,,Takes you where you want to go,5.0,,"An immaculate, like much of the city, mass transit system that works well in a busy, crowded city. Easy to navigate from all corners. Orchard Road to Marina Bay Sands and the astounding Gardens by the Bay."
,,Great Way to Get Around,4.0,,"I have just spent 2 months in Singapore and the MRT was a great way to get around. It is very clean and super efficient although I did get stuck on it once when it broke down. The station signage and directions are very good. Changing from one train to another is very easy so all the lines work well together. Some tips. Try and stay away from rush hours because the trains are packed. If you are staying a while, get yourself a prepaid card. The MRT puts out a systems map. Get a copy as it can be very useful it is very useful. The MRT also connects very well with the bus syste. Be prepared to stand. Lasting impression of the MRT is that 90% of the passengers will be on a cell phone and never look up or make eye contact."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"we used the train during our trip to Singapore. It is very convenient, it is clean and air condition. The directions on the maps are easy to follow as well. There are generally people at the MRT stations who can help with questions. I would point out two things:

1. There are passes available for 1 day (SGD 10), 2 days (SGD 16) and 3 days. These expire at midnight. Depending on travel plans may be cheaper than individual tickets.

2. Last train is around 11:30 PM so plan accordingly!"
,,Super easy to use,5.0,,"Clean, frequent, efficient and cheap. Whats not to love about the mtr?, maps of the system are easily available and very user friendly"
,,A very good transport system,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is the most important transport system of the country. It connects every part of the country very well and makes travel very easy for local people as well as tourists. We had taken the 3 day pass so that we could use it to go anywhere instead of buying a ticket every time. In that way it was more convenient as well as cost effective.
,,Easy ride,5.0,,Singapore transit is very easy to get through and get around the city. It is clean and the wait time is anywhere from 1-4 minutes. I like that their MRT are connect to shopping areas so you really don't have to get out in the heat of the day if you don't need to. It also priced very reasonable and will take to right into Changi Airport.
,,MRT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET AROUND SINGAPORE,5.0,,"By an MRT card and put about $20 on it. This should be enough to get you around Singapore for days. If you run low, just recharge it at one of the stations. The MRT will get you within walking distance of pretty much anywhere you want to go."
,,Great way to get around Singapore,4.0,,We easily visited each of the sites we planned using the MRT. The carriages are clean and services run regularly so there is not much waiting on the train.
,,Very efficient,5.0,,The system is very efficient and travel to all corner of the country. It is very clean and people are very cautious especially to senior citizens

,,Very good system,4.0,,A very helpful MRT system..good maintenance..good staff..very clean..good aircon.. Unfortunately there's some maintenance qt the elevator..but it's only at bugis station..
,,Fantastic for getting around,5.0,,Get a tourist pass it's great for unlimited travel. You can only get them from certain stations though so check their website. For getting your deposit back consider the opening times of the offices as the one at the airport does not open until 8 and we'd forgotten to check! Lost us money
,,The Way to Transit Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is very easy to navigate and will get you within a short walk of most anything you want to do.

Go to one of the booths and purchase a transit card. Then swipe it as you enter and again as you exit any train. The screen on the turnstile will tell you the balance on your card each timeyou use it."
,,Super easy to travel!,5.0,,"We decided to take the public transport instead of relying on taxis. Even with 2 young kids on tow, navigation through the MRTs and the buses were super easy and efficient. The kids learnt how to read the railway maps and understand how to count the number of bustops on between our destinations. Major tourist places reachable via public transport. A good way to blend in with the locals and understand their culture."
,,You Must Use,5.0,,So simple and easy to use - low cost - Spotlessly clean - Great direction details all the time -very frequent
,,A brilliant way to travel,5.0,,"What a joy to travel such a clean, efficient and cheap metro system. The local travellers where do helpful and polite. We purchased a travel card on our arrival and used it to whizz all over the island."
,,Dependable and Clean,5.0,,"I've visited many countries with a rail system and this one is one of the best ive experienced. It was clean , on time and easy to navigate. The cars themselves were also huge. I felt very safe traveling and never seemed lost. It's cheap and my recommended way to travel in Singapore"
,,EZ LINK CARD,5.0,,Was there 7 days. Took EZ Card and loaded 40 sgd on it. Transports is much cheaper if you have ez card comaped to singel tickets.
,,Very easy and convenient to use,4.0,,"Although Singapore is not that big but getting from one place to another quickly can be achieved by using MRT services. There services are very punctual, neat and clean and very easy to use. If you are a tourist and want to explore more of Singapore then will definitely recommend this.

I had stayed in UK for 6 odd years and have used tube services over there also. But this is far better.
I would have given 5 stars but deducted one due to only reason of charge of S$ 5.00 (non-refundable) for EZ-Link card. Being a tourist, that matters for me."
,,So easy to get around,5.0,,Took a trip from orchard road stop to Sentosa island and was an absolute breeze to navigate. Cost of a return ticket on $3.70 sg and very easy to work out which way to go and what stations to change at. Colour code system is very easy for tourists to understand and purchasing tickets was a breeze. Plenty of friendly staff to ask if unsure and one of the most clean public transportation systems I’ve ever been on.
,,Too Good,5.0,,"Easy, Pocket friendly,Fast. It is one of the most convenient way to travel in Singapore. Thumbs Up !!!"
,,Excellent public transportation,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is inexpensive, efficient and comfortable. You can go to Changi Airport from downtown and avoid the traffice."
,,Weekend in Singapore,5.0,,God traveling and god info. Qckly to city center and easy to find in the city. Chep way to go round in the city.
,,Convenient,5.0,,It is frequent and punctual. So far we never face service interruption. We can go to most places that we needed to go just by MRT.
,,Easy to use and very efficient,4.0,,Clean and tidy. Very easy to use the MRT to get to my meetings. Never had any issues. The system is very efficient and one of the best in the world.
,,The most immaculate MRT ever,5.0,,"Hard to believe that mass rapid transport could for the heart of such an extraordinary place. It is immaculate, beautifully designed and staffed by the most amazingly helpful staff. An example to all similar services across the world it makes the London Underground look rather sad and scruffy. It is also amazingly cheap."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,"We used the SMRT for one day while in Singapore. It was easy to use, well signposted, clean and safe. It was also very inexpensive and purchasing the tickets from machines was very straightforward. Recommend as a good way to travel around Singapore."
,,Superb transport system,5.0,,"Most of the places can be accessed using the MRT. Very convenient locations. One tip is, when you buy the card if there is money left over at the end, you can use it at a 7-11 store."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,A maximum wait of 3 minutes for the next train. What's not to like when the network covers most tourist areas and one can travel across town in around 15 minutes.
,,Excellent connectivity,4.0,,SMRT is such a blessing to the city to travel around with great comfort and convenience. Covers the entire city and mostly underground upto -3 levels. One metro pass can be recharged and used upto 6 journeys. Only drawback the 3 day pass is available at selected stations only and since most of the lines are underground you cannot really explore the city while traveling.
,,No 1,1.0,,At being consistently inconsistent in the schedule ... plus ridiculous maintenance regime ... that affecting everyone ... just transfer their methods to the lifts ... surrender to others if they cannot do it ...
,,Out and about in Singapore,5.0,,"Public transport is the best way to getting around in Singapore. We had 5 full days there and used the MRT and buses everywhere, total cost S$27. This included trips to and from the airport 4 times. If you have the Ezlink card, fares are cheaper than paying cash on board buses. Get card at MRT station. Initial cost of S$12 which included a non-refundable S$5 deposit for card. So we topped up the minimum of S$10 twice to cover our whole stay and still have balance of S$7 each when we left. We did not opt for the 3-day card recommended for tourists as we were there for 5 days. Easy to follow signs and help from friendly Singaporeans!"
,,Best Public Transport System,5.0,,"We had a great time exploring Singapore using the MRT. The system is easy to use, super clean and safe, cheap and quick. Will definitely use the MRT the next time we're in Singapore."
,,World class.,5.0,,"A great example of the Singapore stereotype. Clean, efficient, reliable and easy to use. From ticketing machines to the trains everything just works. Signage is helpful and easy to understand."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, just go down to a station nearby, use the touch screen of a ticket machine to get a ticket. The hardest part is to know which exit to take as each station opens to numerous streets.
It is crowded but Singaporeans are polite and the city is very safe."
,,Very Efficient and Cheap – Perfect way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"We spent a few days in Singapore on route from Australia to the UK.

Living in the UK, we tend to regard the London Underground as one of the best in the world – it's not, it's getting better (really it was awful before, no air conditioning, no mobile signal, out of date trains, expensive, unreliable etc), but you have to look at something like the SMRT to see how far it has to go.

It's rapid, it's efficient and it's incredibly cheap (less that £1 Sterling for most journeys), or even less if you buy 2 Day Travel card or similar. Just compare that to London !

Singapore is really too hot and humid to walk far, and the SMRT is a great way to get about (especially if you don't want to go from (air conditioned) shopping mall to shopping mall, which is often the suggested way to avoid the heat outside)."
,,excellent mass transit; very helpful staff,5.0,,One of the best mass transit systems in the world. The pride of Singapore. The trains run on time; the stations are clean and clean restrooms abound. Easy to get around and helpful staff if you need.
,,Modern MRT,5.0,,Timely and modern MRT. There are options to buy one time pass and also you can recharge the pass and use it in bus or MRT.
,,Getting around,5.0,,"Bought the 3 day tourist card. 20 sgd.
Supper easy to use. Can get thoughout the city very quickly

Air conditioned so makes for a break from the heat.
All stations have washrooms that are very clean.
Easy to use system with maps available everywhere.
Staff on hand at each stop to answer questions.
Leaves directly from airport."
,,Smart City with Smart Public Transport,3.0,,"The SMRT or the Singapore Metro, is one of the many public transport facilities available in Singapore.
It connects most of the popular places in Singapore and there are around 3 different color codes for the lines.
the Check in or the Ticket experience was nice. Automated machines help you choose and buy the ticket for you in Minutes.
then just proceed to your station/Platform with the help of many direction boards placed. and there you are - into the metro,
Very Easy, very convenient.

One thing is that this metro is no different from any other metro service in India or Europe.:)"
,,One of the best public transport systems I've used,5.0,,"The cost of using this system is so cheap you have to wonder how they manage to do this. We spent less than 10 dollars over 3 days for two people and we traveled everywhere on this. It was so clean (didn't see a single piece of litter), air-conditioned (which given the temperature outside was very welcome) and ran on time. It was also helped by the fact the people here are so polite, waiting for travelers to align before moving to enter the carriages, offering seats to other travelers."
,,Great System,5.0,,"A very inexpensive system to use to get around Singapore. The stations are spotlessly clean and ticket machines easy to use. The locals are always happy to help with how to use the system, and have people dedicated to help travellers at the more busier stations such as airport and port and some city stations. Highly recommend."
,,This is a great way to get around.,5.0,,MRT is a great and quick way to get around. If you buy the EZ-Link pass you can travel on the buses as well. If you are more than 2 people you might want to check if a cab is more economical and convenient for shorter distances.
,,Only way to travel,5.0,,"Taxis are cheap, but the cost of MRT is amazing with only 2 - 3 minute wait for a train at any time."
,,Fabulous transport system,5.0,,"We had a 3 day pass and it was more than worth it. We found there system so easy to use, it got us around Singapore easily. I must say, I have never been on so many escalators in my life, it was a fun experience."
,,Amazing system,5.0,,"This would have to be the most amazing transport system I've been on. Fast, efficient, clean, couldn't ask for more. If you are going to stay longer than 2 days I would recommend to get a pass."
,,Cheap and exceedingly efficient,5.0,,"Trains and stations were spacious, extremely clean and tidy. Trips were very cheap and it remembered if you went out and took a bus trip, so it could calculate total distance instead of multiple trips. This meant you got a greater discount on the total trip. Really easy to top up cards that you use to tag on and off each bus or train. Trains come every few minutes so you don't need to plan your trip around any train times. Also you can use the same card on the little LRT lines up north in Punggol and Bukit Pajong. So efficient. Great signage as well."
,,The best MRT!,5.0,,"Used the MRT extensively during our 10 day stay in Singapore. The MRT system is easy to navigate, clean, safe, punctual and cheap!! Each station has a touch screen tv which tells you location and which line to use to reach a destination. You can also use the top up machines to add money to your card, very smart. The majority of trains are driverless, they run every few minutes from each station. The best and quickest way to travel around Singapore."
,,Fast and reliable way to get around,5.0,,"The fastest and the easiest way to get around Singapore. Most attractions are connected by the MRT, though you may have to walk a little bit from the stations. The trains and stations are so clean, I failed to find a single piece of trash. Bought a 3 day tourist pass for 20$ and used it to the max. There are multiple exits at the stations, so be sure you take the right one. There are boards and maps to help you. A metro app will be really handy to chalk out your route. As far as the passenger load, I never found the trains jam packed when in peak hours."
,,The underground Rail System.,5.0,,"We used the rail system every day, we our selfs got a 3 day Tourist Pass & when we had used the three day pass, we went to the Ticket Office & just topped to extend its use. It's a brilliant system to travel around, the points of interest"
,,Super efficient to use,5.0,,Well connected all over the city and very efficient to use. Take the card and load some money to make the most of it.
,,Great transport to use!,5.0,,"This transport linked the majority of Singapore. I had the pass and could go where ever I fancied. Each stop i got off at was a new adventure. Amazing transport, busy at rush hour though. I felt safe and used this in the evenings on my own and had no issues."
,,2 Day pass,5.0,,"Tousist 2 day pass well worth the cost. nice air con trains, like nothing i’ve experienced before. can by very busy in rush hours."
,,They say they have be most updated systems but I am afraid they are not,2.0,,I took the MRT from Sentosa to Lavender and didn't complete it to due to some maintenance work. So they offered me a shuttle which is superb. But the thing I don't like it was they were not able to process my refund for the metro which I never used.
,,The ideal way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore is very easy to get around and having the tourist pass for 3 days is the best option. It's easy, clean and fast to get around. Whenever I go on city breaks I also use their metro system and the SMRT is probably the best yet, reasonably priced, so simple and easy to get around and most of all it's clean and air conditioned!"
,,Easy,5.0,,Easy to use. Good value and that’s when the taxis aren’t exactly expensive. More extension work going on round the city as well
,,Clean fast and friendly,5.0,,Do yourself a favour and get a tourist pass. 3 days all mediums of transport $20 The trains are clean fast and cool. Easy to navigate with excellent signage
,,So easy to use and beats the busy traffic.,5.0,,"The MRT is very clean, quick and easy to navigate. The system is extensive and we found it too k us to most places we wanted to visit. Also is was very inexpensive to use."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transport (SMRT).,5.0,,"This transport system is one of the best I have used anywhere. Very good way to get around in a very humid city, always on time and extremely clean, nothing like London's underground! Plenty of very convenient stations close to everything both cultural and varied eating places."
,,great way to travel,5.0,,We loved travelling on the MRT It was so clean on the trains and at the stations. ticket machines easy to use. plenty of lifts and escalators. Reasonably priced.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The MRT network is the fastest, convenient and cheapest way to get around. The trains are very safe and run every 7 minuets anywhere you need to go. All trains are spotlessly clean and the network is very simple to use and timetables are easy to understand for first timers to Singapore. You need to purchase an MRT card from customer services located at all stations, load the amount of credit you wish and away you go. If you have experienced the antiquated and ridiculous system in Melbourne then you’re in for a great experience in Singapore."
,,Train service at it's best.,5.0,,"It's been a while since my wife and I have used the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT), so on our recent trip to Singapore we decided to use the train service on a Sunday. Why Sunday ? Because my wife is a regular church goer, and she was told to visit a church called ""Novena Church"" So we took the MRT from Orchard (MRT) located below the Shaw Centre or Isetan Building on Orchard Road. The station was spotless, and ticket we purchased from an electronic vending machine which cost all of $1.40 one way per person to Novena MRT station. The church was about 100 metres of the station on the same side of the road. I know I have digressed a bit but had to mention the church.
All in all the journey by MRT was good both ways, and the trains very clean and on time. I would recommend visitors to Singapore to use the MRT."
,,Convenient Public Transport,5.0,,Singapore has the best public transport and thanks to MRT for it's huge network. I believe every place in SG has a MRT. I even went to my hotel from Airport via MRT.
,,"A well clean, organize and systematic MRT",5.0,,"Very clean, easy, helpful staff and systematic transportation. Easy to travel, well clear signs and can take it to or from Changi airport. Buy Ezlink prepaid card for easy travel and save money also"
,,Good and Comfortable,4.0,,"- For a small city like Singapore, SMRT gives a good alternative to the buses.
- Best way is to have the travel card (our Singapore friends gave us the cards for our use) and top it up at the station. The minimum top up is Ten Singapore Dollars and each trip costs about a Dollar plus.
- I was disappointed that even many youngsters do not offer their seats in the train to those carrying small children. (unlike in London and other places where they offer seats immediately to elderly and those carrying small children)
-The station , trains etc are clean as expected.
-Signage is good and few shops , ATMS etc are also available inside the station."
,,Clean and Easy to Navigate,5.0,,I chose not to get the Singapore tourist pass as I hadn’t planned to travel that much. I got a regular metro card ($7 deposit refundable) and put $15 credit on it. I went on 4x 45 minute journies and about 6 x 5 minute journeys and it cost about $10 so I’m glad I didn’t go for the Singapore pass option. It would have cost me more. You can see the balance on each use and the 45 minute metro journey was $2 which I thought was very good. I used google maps to find my way around but also followed routes recommended by trip advisor users. The metro maps are easy to follow. The route map is lit up over each door so you know exactly where you are. theres even an indication as to which side the doors will open
,,fantastic train system,5.0,,"cheap and very easy to get around. Immaculate, clean, and air conditioned. we got the local EZ card for $5 then got a refund of any balance at the airport on departure."
,,Super easy to use & cheap,5.0,,"Such a well planned transport system. We brought a ticket to universal studios & got a complementary MRT recharge card - $10 initial top up. This was ample for us.
So clean, frequent & everyone is polite
Will always stay near an MRT station when holidaying here - so easy!"
,,Trains comes every few mins,4.0,,"On a normal weekday, there were trains coming on every few mins. It was still quite crowded probably due to school holidays. Staff were seen directing traffic and asking passengers to move to carriages with less people. Some people did try to give up their seats for my girls."
,,MRT,5.0,,Singapore MRT service ia excellent. The tourist pass provided is very useful to travel about. Staff at MRT very helpful except a few who are ever so willing to show you the correct line. We enjoyed travelling in MRT.

,,Very understandable and easy to travel even for a first time traveller!,5.0,,"MRT has exceeded expectations for me, a first time traveler to Singapore with family, as the signs and instructions are very clear and displayed everywhere in the stations. You could travel all around Singapore's major attractions only via MRT as I did, just search in google map and it shows you which train to board and where to alight. Very happy to have completed my Singapore trip successfully, MRT playing a crucial role in it."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"While traffic can be tedious at times, the SMRT is the most efficient way to get anywhere in Singapore. Most importantly, it is extremely clean and always feels perfectly safe, no matter which station or time of the day."
,,unreliable faulty,1.0,,unreliable faulty but reasonably comfortable.....needs to improve maintenance ...........can be crowded in peak hours..
,,cheap and very friendly,4.0,,I used the MRT for most of my trip in Singapore.As I stayed at Jurong west I always took the bus to Boon lay from where I used to catch the train.Obtaining the MRT card requires minimum 10sgd (which is filled in the card) and the card can be refilled at the stations.Train stops on a regular basis in most cases I didn't had to wait longer than five minutes.However during peak hours the train gets crowdy.
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Easy, fast, clean and cheap!!
Easy to buy a ticket - just select your destination in the ticket machine and for about $1.60 you can head off!
We never once got lost -well signed and easy to get around. Don’t bother with taxis to the airport - for $2.40 we went from city hall to airport in about 20-30 mins and we were dropped off right inside the airport !!!"
,,Perfect,5.0,,"Like everything in Singapore this works perfectly! Always on time, high frequency every 4 minutes, cheap, clean, safe. What else? The system is easy to understand!"
,,Excellent way to travel,5.0,,Singapore has the most efficient and cleanest metro I have ever been on . The metros are on time and it’s so cheap compared to the uk they have people at the ticket machines to help you they even give you discount if you travel more than six times .

,,If only I could give 6 stars,5.0,,"Everything is so understandable, signs, map, routes... the train very clean, except one thing which is not really clear : when we asked someone at ticketing, they speak english but with accent, not really clear but after some talks,its understandable, not a big deal"
,,Great for tourists,5.0,,"Most subways/metro systems can be quite daunting for tourists but Singapore has managed to make a wonderfully simple and efficient transit system that most other cities should copy.
Apart from ease of understanding, it is clean, safe and compared to London cheap.
If in Singapore for a few days get yourselves a tourist pass."

Many trains and buses leaving every few minutes. Singapore’s public transport is fabulous.
,,"Quick, Clean and Great Value.",5.0,,"Singapore is easy to get around using a combination of the SMRT and taxis (use Grab, much cheaper.) We had a rechargeable card and paid as we used it, which was the best value for us, paying about $1.50 per journey. The machines seem to work quite well and take the polymer notes without problem and give change.

The trains are quick, frequent and spotlessly clean, and also benefit from air conditioning. I guess they can get crowded but we always managed to get seats when we travelled. It's a comprehensive network too, and ideal for sightseeing."

,,Easy transport,5.0,,"I loved this. It was made easy by having a three day free pass so if we made a mistake and got off at the wrong station we just needed to wait a few minutes for the next train. Clear, quick and fuss free. A great way to meet the locals."

,,Easy to use,5.0,,"The smrt is very easy to use, and there are always someone to help you to purchase the tickets. All the staff are very friendly. I have never seen such clean trains, and it is very easy to navigate :)"
,,So Easy!!,5.0,,"MRT is incredibly easy to use! No degree required! Great signs, easy to follow directions and stops just about everywhere! Only downside is that it is underground so you don't get to see anything between stops."
,,For free and easy tourist - the best way together around in Singapore,4.0,,"As a Singaporean I am very proud of my country's Mass Rapid Transport System. (We may have some breakdowns and delays as expected of any type of transport.) Singapore has a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) rail system consisting of 5 lines and also a system of bus routes throughout the island. For those visiting Singapore on free and easy, taking the public transport is the best way to move around Singapore. For tourist there is the Singapore Tourist Pass (STP) - a special ez-card that offers unlimited travel on MRT trains and public buses. A 1-Day pass costs S$28; A 3-Day pass S$38. You can buy the STP from Changi Airport, and in town you can get it at all the MRT passengers counters and at 7-evelen stores. Choose the number of day pass you require and hop on to buses and trains just by tapping the card. The MRT lines covers all urban areas and major tourist attractions, with buses running parallel routes. The trains runs underground for some routes and outside The Central business districts it runs over head and provide you a sight of the many housing estates - both public and private. Pick up a map of the 5 lines and study the routes. Most Singaporeans will be most willing to assist if you approach them for route assistances. If you happen to ask a person and get a blank look it may be that that person isn't a regular public transport rider - just approach another person. Wishing you a pleasant trip to Singapore."
,,Very good,5.0,,"On time, clean, fast, and cover all the area in Singapore. If you buy a tourist pass, this will be a big plus since you can use it unlimited per day."
,,"Most Convenient Transit, with the lowest fare",5.0,,"Have been living in Singapore for over 3 years now and I admit the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is the most convenient way to get wherever you want to in Singapore coupled with buses. Fares are really low and the rides are frequent. Just expect that during rush hours, you may need to stand in long queues."
,,Daily commute,3.0,,Not reliable...not consistent..not on time.. does not keep to the same speed daily..always has delays.
,,Best way to move in Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and broad. If you are travelling Singapore for a short time, you can buy single tickets according to your destination or either buy a card for 10 dolars (plus 10 deposit refunded) for 24 hs unlimited access to it."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,The ticket vending machine was a little complicated but once figured out was easy to use. Signs were easy to follow and even though some walking was involved when changing routes it was not difficult.
,,Always great,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore many times over the years, it’s always a joy. This time we brought the kids on their first trip. Using the MRT is always convenient, easy and the stations and trains are clean. We love the MRT and the kids loved using it too. Tap on tap off card makes it so easy. Such an extensive service all over Singapore. Looking forward to our next visit in Feb 2019, and riding on the newly opened line. The best public transit system in the world."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,If u need to go any where u can use MRT. If u use use 2 times in the day it is better to buy a 3 days pass tourist ticket . U can buy a single trip and charg in every trip .

,,"Fast, Punctual & Clean",5.0,,"Oh I wish sydney took a leaf out of their book!
Really easy to use. Tap on/tap off card system.
Buy a card at the start of your trip. There is an app showing the map of the different lines. Very easy & cheap way to get around.
They don’t allow eating or drinking so that helps keep it clean.
Definitely the way to get around. You will do a bit of walking though so not for the immobile."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"The Singapore MTR is really easy to use in order to get around and is quite cheap. However, there are not many machines to buy tickets from often resulting in long queues. Also, the machines don’t except Singapore notes of $10 or over. Investigate other ticket options if you plan to use it for more than a few journeys in order to beat the queues."
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,We were in Singapore for 4 days and purchased a 3 day visitors card. This enabled us to get on and off the SMRT as many times as we liked. It is very easy to follow where you want to go to on the trains and they are very clean.
,,Congested and frequent faulty train.,2.0,,Everytime I take the train i have the fear it will break down. Few occasions the train has break down due to some fault and delays. Seems it occurs in a monthly basis. Also the train is often crowded and no place to sit.

,,"efficient, fast and air conditioned",5.0,,The MRT works and works well. Just do your homework and work out which street you need to exit to - look for exit signs when leaving to reach the right street
,,Excellent public transport system,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is one of the best systems in the world. Clearly, it is planned for local residents to get around their city, but without too much effort visitors will find it very useful, quick and cheap. My only complaint is the tourist pass which is a rip-off, as you pay as much for the plastic card as you do in fares, and the expiry term is short. If you are only going to be there for a couple of days, buy normal tickets at the vending machines in all the stations. If you are going to be there for a week or more, or if you will return soon, buy the same EZ link common stored value ticket (credit card sized) as the locals use. As a peripatetic visitor to Singapore I have one and the value is stored in the card for several months."
,,Fantastic service,5.0,,We are not big users of Australian public transport so generally go for Uber but this service was exceptional- easy to read maps - super efficient - didn’t need to wait more than a few minutes. You’ve got to get on it.
,,Singapore transport.,5.0,,"The SMRT is very efficient and clean, it is also very fast and inexpensive, especially if you purchase the Singapore Tourist Pass ( it also includes travel on the buses).

,,Best Public Transportation,5.0,,"A public transportation that widely used by all Singaporean and foreigners. Comfort, cheap, and very punctual. You can almost reach to all Singapore area by using this transportation. It's cheaper than to use taxi."
,,Train travel,5.0,,Fast safe efficent service by trains to anywhere you want to go in Singapore very cost effective pass available great way to get around very clean friendly service
,,Affordable transport option in Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT's reach improves each time I visit Singapore. The trains are regular around every 5- 6 minutes at peak. Stations are clean and air-conditioned. While you might whiz underneath the city and miss the views in some areas, you do get there quickly.
As the network expands more of Singapore is available to access via the train."
,,Safe an efficient,5.0,,If you are to visit many attractions this the way to do it. A 3 day pass costs 20SD this gives you access to both bus and rail
,,Good choice for transportation,5.0,,"The SMRT is very easy to take and reach many places in Singapore. There are so many signs of the way, you’ll not lost except if you forget to get off. Every stations have screen time that show when will the MRT come."
,,Great service,5.0,,Clean effluent and reasonably priced. Expanding continuously to provide more lines and stations overall the country.
,,Never Get Lost,5.0,,"How easy is this - colour coded for each rail line - you could never get lost so easy to get from one destination to another - very well orgainsed with signage & audio announcements
Sydney we need this
Excellent service - even when combined with the buses
Big well done - will certainly be using it in the future"
,,One of the best!,5.0,,"Nice way to get around town, easier than taxi's fighting all the traffic. There are a lot of lines that will get you just about anywhere you want to go. Nice clean subways, great ride!"
,,Very efficent,4.0,,"Very clean. Trains arrive often. Easy to work out where you need to go. We couldn't work out where to buy the tourist passes but its quite cheap even if you buy normal tickets. Be mindful of going thtough more gates than you need to, it seemed like we were getting charged per gate at on stage. Ticketing can be a bit confusing but there was generally someone near by to help. Take small notes or coins as a lot of the ticket machines don't give much change."
,,A great way to travel around Singapore for very little money,5.0,,We paid S$5 dollars loaded with S$7 for use on the MRT/LRT and buses. The card is not refundable but can be reloaded (S$10) at stations. It is probably the quickest way to get around unless you want to flag down taxis. The trains come around every 4 minutes and we used them to go everywhere. I think we ended up paying about S$20 dollars each for our 5 days in Singapore.
,,Simple to use,5.0,,"Regular, efficient, spotless trains and stations with the added bonus of air conditioning! Friendly staff willing to offer help and advice when needed"
,,"Clean, fast and easy to use.",5.0,,"We have been very impressed with the service provided by MRT during our visit to Singapore.

From the outset we purchased a normal passenger pass at S$10 of which 3 is for the card and 7 was pre pair fare. Some journeys worked out at less than 50p per person. We purchased our card at the station nearest to our hotel.

Clean air conditioned stations and trains which are fully automated. The first time you look towards the front and see a window, the track infront and no driver does make you think.

You cannot get around Singapore without using this fast efficient rail service so invest in the card and travel cheap."
,,Excellent form of tranportation,5.0,,"A very efficient and cheap way of getting around Singapore. Trains are exceptionally clean. Finding the correct train is easy and signs are very clear. The MRT links well to buses, so reaching any corner of Singapore is easy. The ticket machines are easy to use."
,,Brilliant transport system.,5.0,,"Runs like clockwork, clean, efficient, it takes you around the city without you feeling cramped or stressed. Buy a rover ticket for however many days you wish to travel which is excellent value for money."
,,Take note TFL,5.0,,"Having travelled on the London Underground just over a year ago, I couldn't believe the difference. The SMRT trains ran on time, were quiet, clean and cheap. What else is there to say really. A good way to get around Singapore."
,,Simply the best in the world.,5.0,,"Simply purchase the tourist card. The subways are the nice, clean, orderly, and likely the safest in the world. Like all subways, the maps and lines are color-coded but in Singapore the signage is very prominent and the ends of the lines are designated with a letter, ""A"", ""B"",etc. which eliminates uncertainty. People are helpful and orderly and yes English is superb. On several occasions we were offered assistance without our request. Spot ON.
It is very easy to get the card at the airport and travel anywhere in the city.
The card costs $10/day (calendar day, not 24hr day) and there is a $10 fee for the card itself which is refunded when the used card is returned."
,,Easy travevelling,5.0,,"We were very impressed with the whole system. It was easy to get anywhere and quickly. We were advised to buy a tourist ticket but it is for 2 or 3 continuous days. If you fail to use your ticket one day ,through sickness, going on a tour or sheer sightseeing fatigue, you cannot transfer that to another day. A better alternative is to buy an EZ-LINK card for S$12. That is S$5 non refundable cost of card and S$7 travel money. They can be recharged at any time, Min S$10 but individual journeys cost almost half than individual fares or visitors pass. Over 4 or 5 days you will make up the S$5 cost. At the end of your stay you can go to any station and get back any money left on the card.
Reluctantly I have to admit that it is better than the London Underground.
We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a train and people actually offered me their seat if I was forced to stand. I am 72.
I love Singapore and I love the MRT."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"No problems getting a ""travel card"" or adding value to it. System very efficient, clean and well ""signposted"". Compared to London, very cheap; MTR also links in well with bus service, on which you can use your travel card. Thoroughly recommended"
,,best subway I've ever ridden on.,5.0,,"trains are quick and clean, signs are very clear and apparent to let you know which line/ train to get on and off at. Some locals complain that it takes too long but they have been spoiled with such a good subway that anything more than 2 minutes is terrible for them."
,,Very easy to use and very quick.,5.0,,I purchased a 3 day visitor travel pass for the SMRT and buses for only S$38 (£20). It was excellent value for money as used the trains lots of times and the bus back from the Botanical Gardens too. Extremely clean and safe to use.
,,Best system round,5.0,,"We found we got an mrt card which was $15 of which there was a non refundable of $10 tap and go you top it up with $10 a time with no time limit so better than tourist card and we got the remaining credit back as a refund at the station. The system itself was cheap, clean, fast and easy to navigate. We downloaded the Mrt app my transport.sg a great app that helped a lot in planning which trains to get. Trains ran about every 4 min best way to get about Singapore"
,,Buy a tourist pass and enjoy,5.0,,We bought 3day tourist pass for all Singapore transport . Wonderful system Easy to use and if you are confused there is always a friendly person to help you. Clean efficient and fast. We also took a trip around Singapore to the north and west to see it. Well done .

,,Convenient and cheap to move around,5.0,,Convenient and cheap mode of transport to move around esp in city area. Most linked to shopping mall.
,,Best bus transit system,5.0,,"You can make a few days multiple use tourist passes which also work for the buses. The system is too good and beautifully managed. I guess best in the world. Stops are there almost in every big mall or near them. Making passes is so easy, one can make them bu themselves through kiosks situated at the stations."
,,Best transport system I’ve been on,5.0,,"Just spent a couple of days in transit in Singapore and started off by catching the MRT from airport to hotel! Very easy to follow signs it will get u all around Singapore so fast, easy and cheaply! Would recommend just for the experience"
,,Easy way to get about,5.0,,Its not always obvious where the stations are but get a free map when you first go into one. The travel zones are clearly marked on the ticket machines and its very easy to navigate using the map. The trains are immaculate and you can walk the entire length as there are no internal doors. The signage is excellent showing which side the door opens and announcements are in English. Excellent cheap way to get around Singapore.
,,"Only used it once, very cheap and clean",5.0,,"We had heard that it was good so went out of our way to use it. Sadly only once. It was quick, cheap and very clean. Excellent."
,,Efficient and reasonably priced,5.0,,"The network of lines and stations are comprehensive and cover most tourist attractions.
It's clean, modern and very reasonably priced. There are no peak or off peak ticket prices and the trains come at regular intervals. If you're a tourist, the close proximity between some of the stations might add to your journey time rather significantly.
I have noticed that passengers tend to stand on the left hand side of the escalator, so that those who are in a hurry, overtake on the right."
,,Best way to move around Singapore.,5.0,,One of the best and clean MRT's. Quick connectivities to any place. MRT map or Google map directions is a must.

,,Best transport ststem,5.0,,"This has to be the best mass transit system I have used. Frequent, clean, cool trains. Friendly, helpful staff. Cheap and easy to use and Criss crosses the city. So, so, so much better than Sydney trains in Australia. If Sydney is serious about public transport they should come to Singapore and see how to do it."

,,Don't buy a Tourist Pass,5.0,,"Tourist pass is way over priced, make sure you buy an EzyLink card, load it with money instead. I stayed 5 days and used $10 in total. Used MRT for everything. When I left at the airport I returned the card and they refunded my money that was left on the card."

,,Efficient & Clean,5.0,,"We were only in Singapore for 3 days, but we were so impressed with their underground train system. Like many aspects of Singapore in general, the SMRT is spotlessly clean, efficient and on time. The carriages and platforms are air conditioned and so spacious. We didn't once feel unsafe either. It is without doubt the best way to get around the city. We bought a 3 day tourist pass and it was well worth it for our visit."

,,"Clean, efficient and air-conditioned!",5.0,,"Travelling by MRT is the most efficient way of getting to most of the tourist attractions of Singapore. We were staying with family towards the north western edge of the city and were delighted that the Downtown line has opened stations further out that way so that during this visit, taking the MRT was possible as well as the bus. The public transportation system is incredibly well structured and very very cheap. From Chiangi airport over to the east to where we were staying, a journey of an hour and 15mins, we had to pay only Sing.$2.50 each as a single trip. (This compares to a fare of $30-40 for a taxi). Our transport cards were loaned to us so had to be left behind but you need to get one of these cards as soon as possible and then top it up (Sing.$10 minimum top up), The cards enable you to travel by MRT or bus and you get charged proportionately for the distance covered. If you have used the London Underground then using the SMRT will be easy with changing from one line to another simple. What we enjoyed most was the clear signing and the announcements on the trains being both audio and visual. Also most welcome was the air-conditioning as soon as you walk into the stations. We used the MRT for 2 weeks and did not have any problems or delays in getting to where we wanted to go."
,,Travel flawless,5.0,,"Get the MRT PASS in any station. Deposit of S$5 non refundable. BUT: you will find your way without problems. All stations are clearly signed, each line has an own floor to board on to. The most passages take between S$ 0,77 and S 0,87. Only a couple of longer rides cost S$ 1,07 and the longest trip we took(to the airport) cost S$ 1,77. Forget about the taxi take the MRT. Your MRT card is valid for 5 years. Your kid can find the way and all stations underground are airconditioned. All trains are!!"

,,"Cleanest, Safest, Most Efficient MRT Across Few Countries",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system beats out Japan, Washington, D.C. (and NY), and Germany. Quite sure it is one of the best MRT's if not the best in the world. Every station has multiple CCTVs, information booths, MRT top-up kiosks, MRT maps, vending machines, eating and drinking establishments, and bus stops immediately outside the MRT entrance/exit. The Downtown Line is quite new so in addition to all MRT's being clean, the DL is exceptionally clean. Cars are always clean and climate controlled. They are also wide, and hence, spacious.

If you are visiting Singapore, I highly recommend giving the MRT a go. Friends of ours just visited and were all too happy and comfortable using the MRT. Very convenient and budget friendly."

Stay left, keep moving and don’t block the flow of traffic
Be considerate of others, and follow the rules
Wish other countries could follow suit
It’s $5 to buy the pass from any 7-Eleven store and top ups of minimum $10. Great value overall for a clean, fast and highly efficient system."
,,Clean but reliability needs to be improved,4.0,,"Being local, I have taken the train thousands of times. The mrt grid is expanding and have expanded by multiple times since the first time I ve taken it 25 years ago.
Having said that, we have been having reliability issues as we upgraded the train systems. Trust that this will be resolved soon for all of us to enjoy seamless public transport"
,,Riding with the Mass,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT services may not be the newest in the world but they are constantly upgrading to provide better services for locals & visitors.

All lines are easily connected via interchanges & unlike other parts of the world, you do not need to walk too far to change to another line. Even so, connections are not winding here & there.

Fares are relatively reasonable & you may consider getting an EZ Link card even for short term usage.

The MRT system is an convenient way to travel around Singapore to check out parts of its heritage & culture."
,,Generally Good Public Transport,4.0,,"Despite all of the bad blood thrown against SMRT recently, the MRT is still a good public transport.

Here are my thoughts:
EWL - This is easily the most important MRT line of all since you get to access several key locations when you take this MRT line.
It is usually crowded on rush hr, but it is still manageable.
This is the longest line and second oldest MRT line in Singapore.
This is where you start your Singapore journey as well, since Changi Airport is accessible via this MRT line.

NSL - The most vulnerable MRT line. When you heard of breakdowns, it is usually within this MRT line.
Not surprisingly, this is the oldest MRT line and the first MRT station happens to be Toa Payoh.

NEL - I should have dubbed this the ""Tourist MRT"" line because it runs through several tourist spots (Harbourfront, Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Dhoby Ghaut).
The trains are usually not packed even at peak hours, but it can still get a lot of commuters every now and then.

CCL - The least crowded of all train lines.
If you want to explore ""very local"" Singapore, this is the MRT line that you should take.
This MRT line runs through some tourist areas (Singapore Botanic Gdns, Harbourfront) and key locations (NUH, Haw Par Villa, Labrador Pk, Old Airport Rd Food Ctr).
By 2025, the ""circle"" is expected to be completed and will directly link Harbourfront and Marina Bay.

DTL - As the name implies, this line will run thought the Downtown area.
Starting from Bukit Panjang and ending at Expo.
Also, it has the newest MRT line to date.
This serves as an alternative for the EWL as some locations in the east are now more accessible thanks to this MRT line.
If you want to explore Bukit Timah and the northwest areas, you can also take this line.

LRT - You will only ride this if you are going to.live in Sengkang and Pubggol for a very long time."
,,Convenient train service,3.0,,SMRT operate fleet of train and bus services linking most parts of Singapore. Tourist pass available @ SGD38 for 3 days or SGD28 for 1 day. This can be used on all basic bus services and trains (LRT and MRT).
,,World class,5.0,,Singapore's Mass Rapid Transport service is probably the best in the world. You can reach every part of the city with ease using either bus or train. The train and bus stations are about a mere 5min walk from almost every part of the city.
,,Barely (2nd tier) acceptable,3.0,,"Despite the chest pounding propaganda compaign, the level of on time services and the frequency of breakdown prove that the MRT operation is nothing to be proud about.
I am not sure if the planners are ignorant or just incapable, but most of the platforms are either too big or too narrow. Worst, you will expect breakdowns and delays are becoming a common experience due to the lack of proper maintenance during the days of the “colored hair Cleopatra” CEO."
,,Underground train,5.0,,"The best in my experience. I have used London tube for a Long time and used to dread the delays and engineering works.
Life is like a clockwork if you use SMRT. With SMRT, we don’t need cars in Singapore it’s so good. Hope they can maintain it this way."
,,Efficient and easy to navigate,5.0,,"As expected, MRT is easy, fast and comfortable. It is the best way to travel. We also took the bus so we could see streets driving past Little India."
,,The best underground railway system we have ever travelled on.,5.0,,"We used this transit system in February 2018 but have also previously used it 6 years ago. It really puts the London Underground and Paris Metro systems to shame as the stations are spotlessly clean and air conditioned and the purchase of tickets is extremely easy from the ticket machines at the stations. Every time you go through a ticket barrier, a display shows how much credit you have on the ticket and the tickets can be topped up if you decide to go to other destinations. There are no open platforms, so it is physically impossible to fall onto the track. Instead there is a series of glass doors on each platform and when the train comes its doors line up with the doors on the platform. We found that using the MRT was a very pleasant experience and, especially on our previous visit to Singapore, it made it possible to visit many of the sites we wanted to see both easily and cheaply."
,,Easy to Ride,5.0,,During our stay we learned how to navigate the MRT. It was easy & well signed in english. Very clean. We used it extensively the last 2 days.
,,Super fast and efficient,4.0,,Super efficient and easy to navigate. Can’t understand why you cannot pay with a foreign credit card when buying tickets.
,,Easy to use and convenient,5.0,,We used the MRT and the service and ease of use this rail system makes it wonderful to use. Great way to move around in Singapore.
,,"#1 Simple, Convenient, Cheap",5.0,,"Air conditioned for those that struggle with the heat. Bring something if the cold bothers you, it can be chilly. Singapore is not complete unless you ride the public transportation. So convenient. So simple. Easy way to get around and add a walk to see all the local surrounding areas at each stop."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,We used the metro to get round the city and it was easy to buy tickets and to use. You can use your ticket more than once by loading more money onto this.
,,Simply the best,5.0,,"Second to none; every interchange has a shopping centre; clean, efficient, air conditioned at entrance and on all trains; brilliant. You could not be confused if you tried"
,,Great and clean,5.0,,"Singapore MTR network is clean, well functioning, on time, fast and at affordable price. During rush hours, it is much faster then taking a cab. The only problem, it doesn't reach every place in Singapore, and I didn't find bus transfer service to be convenient."
,,Bad bad bad,2.0,,"I hv never seen such bad service provider in an advanced country. Trains are slow and not on time, or rather no prefixed scheduled. I hope the authority will beef up he service standard."
,,MRT,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to get around Singapore. Very efficient, with stops conveniently located throughout the city. Clean, safe and easily accesses. There are often MRT guides available when purchasing tickets to assist you with using the system who are knowledgeable and friendly"
,,Good Facilities and service,4.0,,"The SMRT is a very comprehensive rail network spanning across Singapore & connecting all major towns & housing estates.
The SMRT is accessible to the elderly and to those with disabilities. All stations are now barrier-free and with lifts access to the various floors, making it convenient for everyone in need."
,,Overcrowded,3.0,,"Travelling in Singapore Mass Rapid Transit for me is either a hit or miss experience. Trains can get very crowded especially during office hours. Screeching noises could be heard consistently along the tracks. Waiting time varies between 2 to 4 minutes unless there is a signaling fault which can range between a couple of minutes to hours. Staff are generally helpful at counters and payment for Day passes for tourist is located at certain stations only e.g(City Hall,Lavender) Feel free to Travel the North,South Lines (Red lines) or East to West Lines (Green Lines) and Purple Lines for the North Eastern part of Singapore.Overall experience,could be done better especially when there is less interruptions of service"
,,Go anywhere without getting lost,5.0,,"As a tiny island state you might imagine Singapore is easy to find your way around in. Well YES and NO. The bus network is inscrutable and many bus drivers are surly mainland Chinese who speak no English - so good luck with asking directions (although it must be said that Singaporeans themselves are normally helpful and patient in giving directions).

The SMRT is the way to go, popping up here and there and then burrowing underground again. The maps are clear and detailed, there is usually a station within 10 minutes' walking distance (and it must be noted that Sing is one of the GREAT walking cities of Asia, except for mid-day when you'll fry) and most tourist and commercial destinations are indexed with the nearest station. Be sure and grab a couple of the free tourist maps when you come out of the Airport.

The last SMRT from Changi is just before midnight - but that will only get you as far as Tanah Merah. From there you'll either have to take a taxi [quite expensive, particularly at that hour] or hoof it.

I've taken the SMRT to the very end several times to see what the outlying parts of Zinger are like. Alphaville. Sterile, same-same and kind of dreary. But who am I to say. When I took the East-West Line to Joo Koon, the final station, the neighborhood looked so plain and boring (and pretty much like the rest of high-rise apt Sing) I didn't even leave the station. Just turned around and got back on the train headed the other direction.

You'll often find the SMRT gets you from 'A' to 'B' quicker than a taxicab, particularly at rush hour."
,,Service,3.0,,"Always having troubles. Signal faults frequent. Anyway, it still the most convenience transport mode when you travelling in Singapore."
,,ultimate transport,5.0,,"The minute you get down at the airport you can take the SMRT to ant destination around and in Singapore,kindly buy the SMRT card at the Airport you can load any amount and the card is valid for a lifetime and you can load cash at any SMRT station with ease"
,,new system that should be more reliable than it is,3.0,,"have used it extensively over the last 10-11 years and it used to be a pleasure to use, with clean trains and platforms, reasonable prices and a good network. more recently, however, it has been fraught with too many breakdowns, obvious lack of maintenance, poor management at a senior level and a Minister overseeing operations that seems unfit for the job...............but still keeps his S$millions annual salary"
,,Easy,5.0,,"This is the easiest and cleanest underground rail system I have every travelled on. You purchase your ticket at the station machine in Singapore dollars to the destination you require, change is given, and then just follow the clear signs. If you wish to go to another place you just top up your existing ticket and receive a discount - this can be done multiple times. You can purchase an all day ticket for everywhere at a very reasonable price. There are plenty of maps available to plan your visit. Many stations are right in the heart of shopping malls.
The trains are spotless with the next stop lit up on a map, announced in English and a display saying which side to get out at the station. We did not seem to wait any longer than 2minutes for a train and we spent almost 3 days using them to see the city. All the stations we stopped at had Guest services . We used them twice - the assistants spoke good English and gave very good instructions on the best way to get to our destination.
This is by far the easiest way and most economic way to travel in Singapore and I highly recommend it."
,,Good mode of transport,4.0,,It's a cheap way to travel. Hope they improve fast and get the trains operating effectively as they once were.
,,Garden,5.0,,Its a beautiful place and worth the money you pay. There are two main attractions. Flower dome and cloud forest. Flower dome is a treat for your eyes.flowers of various colours and types with different decorations can be seen. Cloud forest makes u feel like u r in a real forest. Waterfall at the entrance is magnificent too. But keep a track before going because somedays either of the one remains closed for maintainance.
,,The only way to get around Singapore!,5.0,,"This unbelievably efficient, clean, cheap transport is the best way to get around Singapore.
Just $2.50 from the airport to Downtown Singapore in about 30 mins. You do need to change trains once but its just across the platform and so it's no hassle at all.

We bought a tourist pass for $20 for 3 days unlimited use on buses and trains and made excellent use of it. If the train doesn't go where you want there will be a bus nearby.
The only thing they could improve is to have the tourist passes available at more stations or via vending machines at all times. We had to pay to go from one station to another to buy the pass because they only sell them from the ticket offices which are open limited hours.
Also offering a 7 days tourist pass would have been good for us."
,,Never let you down,5.0,,"Thank you to downtown line my way from work to home is alot more easier! station is less crowded, clean and nice!"
,,Great public transportation in Singapore,5.0,,"Great system - clean, reliable and very convenient ! Great value for money. On a permanent improvement. Good connection to buses and taxis"
,,Unpredictable Journies,3.0,,"The waiting time for trains during peak hours is considerably short with each train about 2-3 mins apart. Most of the local attractions in Singapore can be visited with the MRT network. However, train delay and breakdowns are quite common these few years and visitors should be wary when planning to head to the airport. Nonetheless, there are 4 different MRT lines with Interchanges."
,,"Clean, comfortable, timely",5.0,,"I am a local so I take the MRT frequently. There are many lines operated by different operators for specific destinations. The trains and stations are clean and comfortable and easily accessible. Recently there have been some disruptions as the providers and authorities have gradually implemented improvements to the infra structure. Most of the time travel is comfortable, timely, inexpensive and easy. When in doubt ask the station staff."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"Very fast, convenient, clean and affordable. Makes it easy t access any part of the country although it does get a bit crowded during peak hours."
,,Despite the negative press is world class,5.0,,Easy to travel and decipher through . Slower now as trains are expected in 1 min at peak and 3 to 5 mins off peak. Comfortable ride for the fare charged. Takes longer than someone driving for sure but the price difference will effectiveliv stop any adventure.
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transif,5.0,,A quick and efficient way to get around. It was easy to negotiate with helpful attendants. Very clean.
,,Train cabin,4.0,,"Overcrowded during peak hours. Seats in cabins of East West line are too narrow, and cannot even accommodate a medium size person."
,,Always be on standby,3.0,,"it will fail anytime , so always give ample time for your appointments, so that you won't end up rushing
while public shuttle will be on ready mode should the MRT system fail, u still have to beat the crowd if incidents occurred during peak hours!
Other than that it is clean and safe to use!"
,,Best city train system in the world.,5.0,,"This is the best way to get around Singapore. Efficient, clean,on time and very helpful and polite staff. The tourist pass is the way to go."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Probably the best under ground system in the world. Granted it has the advantage of being built in the 21st century, but they have got it right! Frequent, clean, clear signing, driverless (it works!), safe, cheap. Well done!!"
,,Clean and efficient public transit,5.0,,"OMG! What a great way to get around Singapore. You really DO NOT need a car in Singapore. I thought NYC was efficient. Best system in the world that I have so far experienced. The cleanliness and how respectful the people are makes this a great system. I had Tokyo's system at #1. Now my experience with Singapore beats Tokyo. Not that Tokyo is bad, I just preferred Singapore."
,,Efficient but breakdowns increasing,4.0,,"Singapore metro network is very efficient and helpful to travel around the city in a cost efficient manner. However, daily commuters do see an increase in breakdowns"
,,"Customer service ""in the box"", nothing more",2.0,,"Nice, clean and efficient transport system. Lost the human element.
All top ups on prepaid card have to be done through top-up machines. also minimum amount is $10 (no more $5. Formerly station masters also do step in to help to update one's card.
My child happened to need to top up her card. She had only $5 in hand. She could not use the machines. Stationed personnel refused to help her. As a parent, I had to leave my work place to travel all the way to the station to meet her and helped.
Asked my child what happened. She said the station personnel refused to help her., The personnel just said No, cannot help. I went to the person again to clarify. Again the same clinical response. - No don't do top up anymore, cannot help. The person even tried to teach me about parenting and giving my child enough money in the future.
Clinical efficient service without the human face. ""Not my problem"" syndrome. Wow! I am impressed with what SMRT is now. Run like an army."
,,Holiday,5.0,,Fast clean haste free transport.The metro was the best.You don't have to ask or enquire any thing just have a map and you can bbe on your own.
,,Best way to go,4.0,,Why would a value conscious traveller go any other way Daily tickets receive discounts for multiple trips Get you where you want to go fast and effective Easy for travellers to use
,,Efficient,5.0,,"The MRT system in Singapore has got to one of the best in the world.
Its not only efficient its reliable , clean and fast.
The train take you all over the Island with new stations opening all of the time it is soo convient.
Its easy to follow the lines and the stations and stops have plenty of signage to help you get almost everywhere.
Its also a cheap way to travel but at times it can get busy but an amazing system."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Singapore MRT is the most efficient cost effective way to get around Singapore's attractions shopping malls restaurants etc the trains are clean very quick efficient cheap and easy to use suggest you purchase a tourist card which can be used on train's buses etc
,,Convenient,5.0,,"I love the MRT system in Singapore - very convenient and cheap. Buy a card - it's cheaper ($12 with $7 credit included). Most rides cost less than $1, depending on the journey obviously. Great transport system - one of the best in the world."
,,Airport to Cruise Port (Marina South Pier) Transfer — it was fabulous,5.0,,"- the MRT system is very easy to use, with clear maps/stations/options and English announcements for every stop. The trip takes about 50 minutes, but plan for at least an hour (one-way) to travel between the airport and the Marina South Pier MRT station
- The airport has clear train/MRT signs after you leave baggage claim. It appears both trains at the airport are short transfers to the main lines, and both terminate at the main line transfer point, but if you want to be certain, ask the passenger service attendant at the desk by the ticket gates. They were very helpful and could speak English. Also, the ticket agent who sold one-day passes could speak English (you purchase one-day passes at a separate window next to the escalators)
- At the port, there is a covered sidewalk from the ship terminals to the MRT station so bad weather can be mitigated and rolling luggage is easy to move. The distance between the MRT station and the cruise terminal is probably 600 meters, so plan accordingly. The weather is very warm year round, so your travel cloths might be too hot/heavy during this long walk. Layers would be more practical so you can add/remove as needed.
- the trains are safe and luggage friendly, but make sure you are able to carry and move all your luggage. You will have to transfer to another platform/train a couple of times to get from the airport to the port (or vice-versa), but elevators or escalators exist if the platforms are on different levels, and the train locations are very well marked. It is best to print out a system map to keep with you while you ride to determine the best route for your travels. Once on the train, the stops are clearly posted inside the train above all train doors so you can keep track of your progress and location.
- One way or return (two-way) trip purchases are only available to purchase at a kiosk (or possibly at a passenger service desk), but you are not able to purchase single fare tickets at the desk where you buy daily passes (the office where you purchase one, two, or three day passes).
- Both the airport and the Marina South Pier stations have passenger service desks where you can turn in your MRT transportation card to get your deposit fee back. At the time of this review a one way fare between the airport and port costs $2.50 (Singapore dollars) plus $0.10 ticket fee, per person at the kiosk. The one day travel pass cost $10 (Singapore dollars) plus a $10 refundable deposit if you return the card at a passenger service desk (not all stations have a passenger service desk, but both the airport and the Marina South Pier stations had passenger service desks to return cards for a deposit refund).
– Side note: The deposit refund is in Singapore dollars, so you now have local money. If you want to spend it before you leave, the Ferry terminal next door to the Marina South Pier MRT station had a few small market tents/shops with a decent selection of various merchandise, from food to souvenirs. It was quick and easy.
- A BIG glitch in our day occurred at the ship. We purchased a one-day travel pass so we could get to the ship early (around 11 am), check-in and drop our bags off, then go see Singapore for hours with our travel pass. We got to the ship, dropped off our luggage and checked in, but were informed had to clear immigration as we boarded the ship and would NOT be permitted to leave the ship once we boarded. So we had to haul our backpacks and small bag around town and didn’t get to explore Singapore as much as we hoped. Even if we had not gone anywhere else, one of us would have needed to walk back to the MRT station to turn in our passes/cards to get our deposit back, so take this into account before you decide to get a full day transportation pass instead of a one-way ticket."
,,Very organized and Clean!,5.0,,The Train system connects with the buses. The train is very clean and orderly. Singaporeans are generally polite and courteous.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Very nice metro system. Biggest pet peeve would be that the ticket machine doesn't take larger bills unless the purchase is larger, so don't expect to break a $20 on a single ticket."
,,Well organized metro system,5.0,,"The metro system was organized to be your home in a 20 minutes.very clean stations and trains,government did a perfect job for keeping everywhere clean.perfect dicipline"
,,"Excellent, efficient and clean!",5.0,,"The metro system or the SMRT was very convenient, efficient and economical way to travel around Singapore. The metro and the buses were very clean. I purchased the NETS FlashPay card from the airport and topped this up as and when I needed to use both the metro and the buses."
,,"Love, love, love the MRT",5.0,,"Singapore MRT – We took a taxi at S$30 from the airport to our accommodation and then found the following day we could take the MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) or the Tube to us Brits, for just S$2.50 each literally from door to door. It is incredible with a train on each of the lines – ours was the Circle line – running every 3 – 5 minutes. Amazingly clean, superbly smooth and on time. Brilliant connections to other lines and therefore incredibly easy to get anywhere. The concourses were amazing with little shops in some of them including a dentist at the Holland Village stop. What I loved the most was the ticketing options, so easy to use, and I mean really easy, in different languages and the ability to re-use your “used” ticket up to 6 times just by “adding a ride” and this saves printing and wasting paper and to boot gives you a 10 cent discount or refund when you re-use. Now that’s what I call innovation. Overall love the MRT to bits and it was one of my favourite parts of Singapore."
,,Great travel,5.0,,"We were recommended to use the SMRT and we were pleased we did. The trains were very smart and instructions at the stations were very clear. We travelled to Chinatown and the gardens wgere the new large Hotel i, all for a very reasonable sum."
,,"Fast, Safe and clean",5.0,,"SMRT is fast, safe and clean. The only thing they could improve would be to have more ticketing machines on the Tourist hotspots to avoid waiting queues. They have a lot of staff to help tourists to buy tickets or find their direction."
,,Clean and east travel,5.0,,"Amazingly for just over £1, we travelled 10 stops towards China Town from the Botanic Gardens and the ticket allowed us to travel up to 6 times within the 30 days of purchase. Don't know anywhere else that you can travel so cheaply. It is all to do with the heavy car tax that car owners have to pay."
,,Such an easy way to get round,5.0,,We had a prepayment card - it was really easy to use and a great way of getting round especially given the heat. Excellent air conditioning and free wifi. Did loads of trips and it wasn't too expensive.
,,Super easy; impeccably clean,5.0,,"Safe, clean, well-labeled and easy to read/understand. If you are going many places in one day, pick up a one or two-day visitors pass (the one day pass was S$20 with a S$10 refund.)"
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"MRT is easy to use and air conditioned. It’s fairly inexpensive.
We did have problems with our cards working two or three times, so we could not enter ok. In all instances, we had to go to the customer service booth to correct the problem, and then the cards worked fine. You need to use your card for the entrance and exit, so don’t let get rid of it during your journey."
,,Tourist Pass a must,5.0,,"The MRT is so clean & efficient, it gets you everywhere you could want to as a tourist.
We grabbed a tourist pass for 3 days at $30 each with $10 returned when the card is handed back.
We used it to get to the airport as well, much cheaper than a taxi or Uber and you can hand the card in at the airport.
Tips
-Get a tourist map with the MRT map on it.
-Once at your destination find a locality map which will give you your bearings in the area.
-Use it to get to and from the airport"
,,Reliable,5.0,,"Congratulations to the staff who run the MRT. It’s reliable, punctual, cool, clean, accessible and good value. It’s a superb system for getting around Singapore. We found staff at Mattar particularly helpful on the first day of this recent visit."
,,a convenient mode of travel !,3.0,,"This is a modern and efficient mass transit system in Singapore which I always enjoy taking. One of the conveniences I enjoy is adding money to my card which I can use elsewhere for purchasing food at 7-11, etc. The SMRT is temperature controlled to an ideal temperature regardless of how hot it is outside. Also, I find clean and modern restrooms at many of the SMRT stops which is not the case at so many other modern cities. The only thing I wish is that the SMRT was more comprehensive, for example the SMRT does not go to the Katong area of Singapore which I find inconvenient and I therefore must take a bus. Otherwise, this would be a perfect mode of travel in Singapore all the time !"
,,Fantastic way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"We are in Singapore for a few months and we are making great use of our rail card - paid 5 SGD for travel card initially then you can just top up when needed - great MRT efficient, clean, frequent and above all air con - just such a good way to get around Singapore - I believe you can also use on buses."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Spent 3 days in Singapore and made the mistake of not using the MRT first day. So easy to use , cheap clean and efficient. Be prepared to walk long distances when you get underground but well worth it"
,,Clean and Safe!,5.0,,"In Singapore, they ""Mind their Ps and Qs"" as grandma would say. The result for a tourist, is a clean, quiet mode of transport that is safe any train you take.
Buying a ticket is easy since the machine allows you to pinpoint your destination on the map and tells the exact cost. Choosing Engish is simple and most signs are written in English as well.
Don't plan to eat or drink on the train....fines are clearly marked. In fact, though I didn't see a fine, no one was talking on the phone. Texting-yes Talking-no.
No litter, bright trains and stations."
,,Clean and fast,5.0,,You can walk quite large distances in air conditioned underground tunnels- A godsend in hot weather. Well worth buying inclusive tickets.
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,"Super easy to use to get around Singapore, including Changi Airport. Big tip for those visiting Gardens by the Bay at night: buy a return ticket from your originating station, as the ticket queues are super-long after the light and sound show ends."
,,Easy to use transport system,4.0,,"Ticket machines do not accept foreign debit cards and cash must be low denomination notes only, so make sure you have low dollar notest. Lots of staff on hand to help if needed but this is one of the easiest transport systems to use."
,,Excellent public transport system with good tourist pass system,5.0,,"We used passes obtainable from the airport,Chinatown or other main stations for two days - great value and great way to get around on clean efficient system. Passes can also be used on the buses."
,,Best of the best,5.0,,"Always on time, clean, fast and easy to use. I think Singapores mrt is the worlds best public transportation system."
,,Well worth it,5.0,,"Getting a tourist pass was not easy. Get it at Airport 1st. Once you have it, Singapore is easy to get around on MRT or bus. Well worth it."
,,Modern metro and kind singaporans,5.0,,It was really easy to have ride with smrt together with my young kids. Cummuters usually offer their place for elderlies and families with young kids. Enjoyed metro and bus services with 3 days singapore tourist pass.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"This is excellent solution for transportation around Singapore. It is fast, it is cheap, very easy to understand where to jump in and jump out, safe and goes almost everywhere in the city."
,,"clean, fast and efficient ride home",5.0,,The MRT is very clean and fast and can reach a destination in 10 minutes time! Have never been caught in a breakdown and there are helpful staff and directions there.
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"From the Changi airport to all of our transportation in Singapore, we really enjoyed the SMRT. Very clean and easy to use, all the informations are clear and accurate. The agents are very gentle and caring that you get the right infos. We bought a travel card, the rates are really cheap compared to other big cities. The card is good for 5 to 7 years and you can get a refund if you don't need it anymore. Don't pay for taxis if you are low budget, the SMRT goes everywhere in the city, is reliable and cool!"
,,Always Clean & Reliable,5.0,,"Highly recommend using SMRT for tourists, not only it’s so efficient, but so clean & I never seen other countries’ Rapid Transit so efficient & easy to understand (compare to Japan or New York), Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is super easy to travel with, clear instructions everywhere!!"
,,"Cheap, easy and safe",5.0,,"Like everything else in Singapore this is spotlessly clean and efficient. English signs and announcements mean it’s easy to get around. Load up. Pre paid card and it’s cheaper and so much easier than to keep buying a ticket. You may have to catch a bus sometimes too and the card works for that too.
Very easy to use."
,,great transport system,5.0,,"Great transport system, fast, easy to understand, cheap fares, clean stations and trains, modern, safe."
,,Good - but can be confusing,4.0,,"There is a fairly extensive underground system - especially in the city centre. It is air-conditioned,clean, modern and also cheap.
However, the network has several lines that intersect each other and it is not easy to work out the best route. The direction of travel is indicated by the last station on the service rather than ""Northbound"" etc. Also there are multiple exits to some city-centre stations - check which one you want (local maps are provided on the walls)"
,,"Clean, modern and cheap",4.0,,"Getting to most of the points of interest around the centre of Singapore quickly and cheaply is done via the SMRT.
The network is fairly easy to use and changing lines is straightforward. Trains run very frequently and during the day we were here the carriages while fairly full at times, were by no means overcrowded and wait times for the next train rarely seemed to be more than 5 minutes...and often much less"
,,"Wonderful, quick, clean and prompt",5.0,,Excellent service - good price - links virtually everywhere you'd want to go. Get the $5 ticket (none refundable) which has $7 credit - I made the mistake of topping this up with another $10 but really couldn't use it all. You need one per person - you cannot share them. The outstanding thing is the provision of public toilets - they are everywhere - all beautifully clean and treated with respect by the population. The trains are never too packed and the people are all respectful and clean! Not like London!!
,,Seamless Travel Option,4.0,,"After living in Beijing for a year I have become accustomed to quick subway rides and easy navigation, however Singapore's transit system is up there with the best. All the stations I saw were well maintained, and travel time between them was quick as well. Very well organized"
,,Easy peasy,5.0,,Great way to get around Singapore...easy to understand and use...very clean and also great value👍🏼
,,"Clean, modern & easy to use",5.0,,"Don't be intimidated if you haven't used it before. It if a great way to get around Singapore. Clean, bright, easy to use and comfortable."
,,"Easy to use, clean and trouble free - use it!",5.0,,They do this sort of thing so well in the Far East - easy accessible transport and at a reasonable price.
,,Even we conquered it!,5.0,,"We were apprehensive about using the MRT in Singapore but realised we needed to conquer it to get the most of our visit. First up we purchased a three day pass to unlimited trips by train and bus around this vibrant city from the Changi airport booth, Next we studied a map of the various lines and viola! We got lost.. joking. Straight to city hall where we were staying. Just follow the colour of the line ( or lines) you need to get too or where your going... easy... . After a few bear wrong bf direction misses... we conquered it! Yeah"
,,"Clean, efficient and good value",5.0,,Bought a 3 day travel card which is good value. There is a $10 returnable deposit so remember to return the card. If you don't then leave it in your room as a tip for the maid. Metro is excellent. All signs in English and good colour coding for priority seats. Clear maps and frequent service to all major areas. be careful to check your location for pedestrian exit as it is not always obvious which exit you need.
,,Terrific transport system,5.0,,"Getting about the city is essential using this system. So well organised and clearly signed for visitors, very inexpensive and very frequent trains. Cannot recommend this highly enough."
,,So much smoother than back home,5.0,,"We caught a train multiple times whilst in Singapore and every time it was great. Very affordable, easy to work out where to go, clean and fast."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Jump on board one of the easiest systems to use in the world. It's cheap and very reliable. 1 ticket can be topped up 6 times give a 10% discount each time. As quick and definitely cheaper than the local taxis
,,great way to travel,3.0,,"amazing experience ,plenty food optiions.three storeys of food desserts specially cendol n kachang.shopping good but bugis street cheaper"
,,In singapore mostly use this MRT transport,5.0,,Its cheaper than taxi of course..comfy because everything has sign..the information is adequate so you can not get lost.. clean train and it easy to access with people with wheelchair or stroller..
,,4 day stay prior to cruise,5.0,,"This offers a cheap,easy way of getting round Singapore.Very clean and efficient.You never have to wait very long for trains."
,,"Efficient and effective, the public transport every city should have.",5.0,,"Moving in Singapore by cab can be annoying (although easy)... now, if you are willing to move with the crowd I really recommend you to get in the SMRT, get a card for you to recharge every now and then and hop in/out wherever/whenever you want.

Now... I think trip advisor has this item in the wrong category... is not something you HAVE to do, is something that you will eventually do. The train stations and subway system is interesting but the stations aren't marvellous in construction or gorgeous. Is a pretty functional system. Moving with this system is far cheaper than taking a cab everywhere and (as a tourist) it covers most of the attractions you will want to visit in Singapore.

If you are coming for a day and you will be travelling to several places (we are pretty quick and walk a lot, yet we only used three or four stations) is far cheaper to buy the single day ticket. If you are planning on staying more than one day, or won't be getting out of the station that much (or case) is better to get the MRT card and recharge as you use it as you go instead of buying single day tickets for every day.

The entire system is well organised, they communicate in several languages and the onboard system is very informative, you won't get lost.

Enjoy your stay :)"
,,"Excellent, convenient, clean and easy to use transit system",5.0,,"Why drive when the Singapore Mass Transit system is so easy to use and goes everywhere? We were in Singapore for a wedding and our hosts gave us prepaid EZ transit cards which allowed us to explore the island nation while they were busy with wedding preparations. Tourist passes offer unlimited travel on the metro and buses; one can buy 1-day, 2-day and 3-day passes."
,,I ALWAYS USE MRT EVERYDAY,5.0,,needless to say it is the best public transport ever. no delays no anything and always on time. very convenient from place to place too.
,,Beter than driving in this lovely city,5.0,,"Apart from a taxi on our arrival we travelled throughout the city on the MRT, it was clean, comfortable and easy to navigate. With an ez-link preloaded card is very cheap, it can get crowded though."
,,getting round Singapore,4.0,,this is a fast clean efficient and cheap travel around Singapore sometime difficult finding stations or was that just me?
,,Very Convenient,5.0,,"SG MRT is so convenient. I had a ticket which I bought for 35 SG$, and refunded the remaining amount. all my DIY tours were smooth and fast. Aircon and escalators working perfectly. Look everywhere and it is very clean."
,,Amazing service,5.0,,Very reliable and fast service. You can get it in almost every 6 minutes. In general I waited only 1-2 minute in average. So it was very good experience.
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"We used public transport everywhere. Very easy to get around and understand, Cheap too. The buses and trains are very clean and arrive every 5 minutes."
,,clean and fast tranport!,5.0,,"Clean, organized, and easy to navigate!!! Love to see that there are no doors in between cars and really impressed with the signs and efficiency of travel."
,,"Safe, easy, efficient, fast",5.0,,"We had no experience using the MRT, however it is so well sign posted you can't go wrong. There are easy to use ticket machines and also staff on hand to assist. Incredibly clean, safe and efficient transport for very little cost. A fabulous way to get around"
,,Great system,5.0,,"A wonderful prompt and quick transport system, it was very easy to navigate even in a wheelchair, although it gets very full at tim es there was always a space"
,,Clean and Freindly,4.0,,"Trains are clean and people are alert to give up seats for elderly and frail. This is good for the riding, however some stations have extensive walks to get to the train or to change lines at designated ""interchange"" stations. This a negative for the system."
,,Amazing..,5.0,,One of the best and sophisticated transport system in the world. Travellers friendly and very convenient.
,,Fantastic Value 3 day pass,5.0,,"You can reach anywhere on the MRT- the system has expanded hugely in the last 15 years. Each station seems to include a huge underground shopping mall, so you need to keep your eyes open to the find the entrance to the station! We bought three-day tourist passes for $20 (plus a returnable £10 deposit for the eCard) which worked brilliantly. You can also access the Red buses with the pass. The only point I would mention is that the cards are not 24hour based, they run from early morning to late at night so if you buy your card and start to use it in, say, in the afternoon you will lose half a day, so get organised to start early to obtain full use. You can top up the card at the end of 3 days if you wish. These tourist pass cards can only be purchased at major stations at the ticket office, not a ticket machine.

What a civilised way to see Singapore, and you avoid the traffic jams sitting in a taxi . . . ."
,,You can't buy ticket with card!,4.0,,IT is bit tricky to start at Changi. You need cash to buy ticket! So strange in such HDC! This is inconvinient. So after customs start to look for ATM or money exchange. They are not directly on the way.
,,EXCELLENT,5.0,,"So good, easy to get around Singapore and no matter where you are, a station is close by. Tourist passes make it easy to travel as you don't need to buy a ticket everytime you get on or off and with 1. 2 or 3 day passes, there is something for everyone"
,,Life Line of Singapore,4.0,,The SMRTS is really the life line of the City that connects almost all places of the town. It is cheap and convenient if compared to the taxi. With passage of time it has grown very crowded. You may not find place to sit or courtesy of travelers to offer seat to senior citizen. Colour coding helps you to identify your train platfom. There are passes for persons living for longer duration.
,,Excellent system,5.0,,Brill used it a lot to get round. Easy accessibility easy to find all English.... Great system use it don't do taxis great transport clean and tidy Lots f walkways
,,Beautiful Singapore,5.0,,"WE stay in Singapore for Seven days, but we use Singapore Mass Transit last three days. I wish we know how cool and cheap it was to use Transit. Very convenient to get in and get off at any location. I wish India can do these, so you don't have to relay on Disown-est CAB and Rickshaw Drivers."
,,Not the most user friendly from the airport ...,4.0,,"First, I am a mass transit junkie. One of my goals is to ride every system in the world before I die. Now, having said that, I found the MRT a bit tough to navigate and not very intuitive upon our arrival at the airport. Here's the scenario:

a) We didn't have Singapore dollars, so we went to an ATM machine at the airport. It gave me two $50.00 bills. I was a bit chagrined at the high denominations of the bills. But, what was one to do?

b) Once we arrived at the MRT ticket machine, we were even more chagrined to discover the credit card payment possibility didn't work. (We were told they don't usually work?!) and that the machine didn't accept anything greater than a five dollar bill.

c) Although it wasn't visible from where we were wringing our hands, there was an info/customer care booth. In Bangkok, that's where we bought our tickets, but here, I guess, it wasn't possible. He gave us change, and sent us back to the machines.

d) More standing in lines. But, with a five dollar bill, I was able to buy two inbound tickets to Bugis. Here's a helpful hint: you need to press on the screen first to create a map, and then to press on your stop. It will calculate your fare that way. You can also type in your stop's name, but spelling might be a challenge since many of the stops are obscure to an outside visitor.

e) Once on the train, don't relax too much ... because you'll be only going two stops. Then you have to make the decision to get off the train by the left side or right side. If you're going to city center, you will want to go left (like most everyone else.) Cross the tracks and wait for the next inbound train.

f) Once on the East-West line, you can make changes to other lines. The map if relatively clear. We arrived on a Sunday in the early evening, and the train was relatively empty.

g) Upon getting off the train, I saw a large sign advertising one day, two day and three day tourist tickets. Having that at the airport might be handy. If it was there, I missed it entirely.
I agree with other reviewers, though, ... the price for a ticket to go a great distance was right! Like the rest of Singapore, it was clean and safe, too.

Enjoy!"
,,Best Metro/Subway/Underground Ever,5.0,,"We visited Singapore before, after and during an extended cruise. The MRT is fabulous. We went everywhere using the MRT. When our cruise ship returned to Singapore twice during our time onboard we just got off the ship and visited sites using the MRT and returned to the ship easily to re-board. We went to the Botanic Gardens and National Orchid Garden from the ship and to Krangi War Cemetery. On our last night in Singapore we went to the light show at the Gardens by the Bay and the light show at the Marina Sands Hotel using the MRT. Clean, safe, cool and fast. Easy to use automatic ticket machines which accept only $5 and $2 Singapore dollar notes and all coins. There is a staffed kiosk to change larger bills. Be sure to re-use your ticket, it is good for 6 uses and gives you a 10 cent discount for re-use."
,,Confusing and not disabled friendly showing it's age,2.0,,"The problem having all your transport infrastructure built or modernised in one go is that one day the whole thing will look dated and this is the case. The signage is confusing in the extreme and really visitor unfriendly, the price is fine but unless you have specific destinations the trains are old fashioned and have no windows to look out at the front or back, not like KL where they are automated and almost like a theme park ride for coppers."
,,D Clayton,5.0,,Easy to use but you need money less than 10 dollar notes to pay cash.Download app to make it even simpler
,,Efficient and relatively cheap. You can't find any rubbish bins in MRT stations,4.0,,"My favourite mode of moving around whenever I am in Singapore. It is relatively cheap in a super expensive city and fairly efficient. More convenient to move around if you have the Ezlink card.

If you are wondering where are the rubbish bins in the stations, you might be surprised to know none are available. You are expected to bring back your wastes home/hotel for disposal. SMRT took away all rubbish bins for security reasons few years back."
,,Superb Connectivity! On time,5.0,,"Something to learn from Singapore..
Superb Connectivity with covering almost all places to make it economical to tourist and citizens.utmost seats reserved for old people, pregnant women and women with child.All compartment with proper signage.One cannot get lost in this city..All signages are well put at allpointsafter few meters. Appreciate the Govt .It is indeed for Masses..It is Rapid!!"
,,A Pleasure to use,5.0,,"Frequent clean trains, never too crowded, clear maps & signage. Reasonably priced and easy to use, the Singapore MRT is difficult to fault."
,,Best,5.0,,"clear Map and good connections, easy to get wherever no matter where you are. Thank you Nicoll Highway stations staff, you are so nice and helpful"
,,"Super safe, clean, efficient",5.0,,"The MRT is super efficient, we let the kids go back to our friends home by themselves without thinking twice."
,,Excellent public transportation system,5.0,,Cheat & Best public transportation system in singapore. The best part of singapore is to have such an excellent public transportation system which is reachable to each & every corner of singapore. Also singapore tourist pass made our trip a very hassle free
,,Best Means of Transportation.,5.0,,"Best means of transportation...What could I ask for, free from traffic, accessible from one place to another (even connected to the airport) and add the discipline implemented in this place.... it's a WOW!"
,,Possibly the best public transport available.,5.0,,"The network is increasing in size all the time, but the common factor is the low price, high frequency of trains and the cleanliness. Using an EZ-Link card, entry and exit to stations is easy, as is topping up the card with cash or credit card at the self service machines.

The MRT links well with the bus network, and if you use a combination of both to get to your destination, the value is even better as the journey is priced as a single entity. It is possible to use a bus after the MRT, and the bus to cost nothing or maybe 10/20 cents.

It can get very busy and require standing, but usually not for long."
,,Nice and clean ride around Singapore,5.0,,"Always on time, but if there is a problem they keep you informed and do all they can to get back on track. Always clean and riders are very respectful of each other."
,,"Highly efficient, comfoertable and affordable",4.0,,"One of the best and most efficient MRTs in the world. Singapore public transport consists of MRT and buses. Both serve the entire island and are seen as safe, punctual, cost effective and comfortable. Excellent signages and maps guide tourists and resident with ease. Buy ezlink card at any station and use it on MRT, buses and some commercial places. Refill the card at conveniently located machines. Very good connectivity to Changi Airport. Would strongly recommend to tourists for safe public transportation. So it is advisable to see how far an MRT station is from your hotel, while planning your trip. The new Downtown line (Blue line) is super smooth ride (incidentally, it is driverless)"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Very easy to use and very efficient. Excellent value for money , a journey costing 3.40$ on the MRT was 15$ by taxi"
,,"Clean, efficient, and convenient",5.0,,"The MRT is a fast and convenient way to get around almost the entirety of Singapore. Fares are very low too, which is good because Singapore is one of the most expensive places in the world for a great many things. The stations and cars are spotless, and the whole system is very safe. I recommend getting an EZlink card over a tourist pass, you’ll probably come out ahead."
,,Clean and cleaner,5.0,,The cleanest and best organizes Mass Rapid Transit that we have ever experienced. No food or drink aloud. Worked perfectly for us.
,,Great transport from airport to cruise port.,5.0,,"We flew into terminal 1 of Singapore’s airport. Got the sky train to terminal 3 then followed the signs to the SMRT. There was a very helpful lady standing by the ticket machine who changed my $10 for 2 $5 for the machine and helped me to get the right tickets.

I had printed the directions off before leaving home and some helpful chaps pointed us in the riight direction. I change and a few stops later we got off at marine pier."
,,No more transport better than this,5.0,,"Clean, neat and wonderful mode of transport. Enjoyed every time I used it for travel. Employees are biggest asset here. They are always there to help and guide you."
,,Efficient travel,5.0,,"Having time to spare in Singapore before flying home we decided to visit the Marine Bay Area. Not certain if we could use transport or taxi we sought advice from the hotel staff. Try the SMRT, it's not far from here. So we walked to Fort Canning where we found the station. Fort Canning station is very. Clean & cool. It's also very. Efficient. Trains seem to run every few minutes. Tickets are also very reasonable."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Not really sure this counts as a thing to do. It’s more of a way to get to something you want to do!

Having said that if you avoid the peak rush hours, the MRT is a really pleasant experience. There are loads more stations now which means you get to drop off closer to where you want to go.

Get an EZ link pass and put some money in it. It works out much cheaper than single rides.

Trains don’t run through the night."
,,This system is so efficient and cheap.,5.0,,The trains run so often that you barely wait 5 minutes. You can buy a card to pre load with credit. The journey from the airport cost just over 2 Singapore dollars to city centre but most journeys around the city and to the Waterfront cost around 70-80 cents. The subways are very clean and well lit and directions and information are plentiful.
,,Spotlessly clean,5.0,,"A taxi driver described Singapore as Switzerland without the snow. Good description of the train system which is efficient, on time, fast, inexpensive and clean. The system is extensive too and soon will cover the entire island."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best way to get around Singapore.
It is fast, cheap and very easy. The cars are clean and so is the system. This is the way to go and everything is color codes to make it easy to change trains and get to where you want to go."
,,Worlds Best,5.0,,"Fast, clean, convenient and on time, this MTR works and covers the best of Singapore. It’s cheap and just the thing to do."
,,"Clean, speedy, effortless way to get around Singapore",5.0,,A good tip is to buy a tourist day or multiple day tick. The nework covers all areas and is one of the quickest ways to get around.
,,"Excellent - better, faster and cheaper than cabs",5.0,,Used the MRT most days during our stay it was fast and reliable with stations located close to all major points of interest.
,,Brilliant!!!,5.0,,"We used the MRT the entire duration of our trip. It is quick, cheap and easy to use! You can get a temporary card and top it up. Fares are almost half price compared to one way prices."
,,Most efficient,5.0,,"As tourists we purchased MRT passes this is the most ideal and convenient way to travel all across Singapore , the MRT is well connected and most efficient, You can also use the MRT CARD for purchases at the seven eleven shops"
,,"Clean, affordable & efficient way to go around Singapore",5.0,,One of the best public transportation systems in the world. The stations and the trains are always clean and comfortable. The fare is affordable and it really is the best & easiest way to go around Singapore.
,,No Stress Travel,5.0,,"Efficient and clean(food/drink banned).This is a great way to get unlimited travel around Singapore. A very reasonable 1, 2 or 3 day tourist pass is the best option. These aren't available for purchase at every station though. Can even use this to get back to the airport.. Also use on buses. When purchasing regular tickets you need notes $5 or less as no change given for large ones which makes the pass even more desirable."
,,Great system,5.0,,"This is an example of how public transport should be. Spotlessly clean, frequent and reasonably priced. Helpful staff on hand to advise."
,,After a while is a good system,4.0,,"First time we used it, we always asked people how to get from one place to others. After few times is really easy to use. The idea with the color for the 'lane' is good"
,,So Clean,5.0,,"One of the cleanest mass transit systems I've ever used or seen. Timely, organized, reliable. Everything you want in public transit."
,,Clean & efficient,5.0,,"Spotlessly clean, with a regular service from the airport to the city. We used the metro both on arrival & departure. Both trains & buses are air conditioned, comfortable & reliable. Public transport in Singapore is first class!"
,,"One of the best, if not the best",5.0,,"For me is the best transportation system (I have been to Dubai and Hong Kong). Extremely clean of course, it is Singapore after all!, and on schedule. If traveling on a budget, you do not need a car or Uber... MRT is efficient."
,,Good way to get around town,3.0,,"Nice clean and efficient way to get around the city. The route MAPS take a bit of deciphering and getting used to. Buying a ticket may mean a very very long wait in line, and at some MRT stops it can be very very busy."
,,"Cheap, clean and frequent",5.0,,SMRT is fantastic. It’s really easy to use and a great way of getting around. There’s a $5 non refundable fee for the pre pay card but the fares are cheap and the system appears to fun very smoothly
,,Very clean and efficient,5.0,,Very cheap clean and efficient. If your there longer than 3 days I recommend an ez card (UK version of oyster)
,,Mrt,1.0,,Just like London underground so cheap to use get to places in mins buy a weekly pass and just top up when needed
,,Easy Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is great. My husband and I spent the day today travelling around from South Beach to little India to Orchard Road and back without getting lost once. It was reasonably priced, spent a total of $9.00. We were very impressed, it was clean, I mean very clean. Several people stopped and offered help when they saw us looking at the map but here we didn't need it, unlike in Paris this summer lol! Although the people there were as friendly to offer help, here we didn't need it."
,,The Tourist Pass is amazing value,5.0,,"The MTR is absolutely the best way to get around in Singapore. It is really easy to use, goes everywhere, with trains every 2/3 minutes, and of course is spotlessly clean.

The Tourist Pass is especially good value. We used our 3 day 20SGD pass many times each day, far cheaper than buying individual tickets. Just a little problematic to reclaim the 10SGD deposit on the smart cards, as the tickets offices selling them are few, and some not open all day."
,,"convenient, cheap and easy to use",5.0,,"the system is modern and clean, with frequent trains and easy connections to buses. You can either get a card for SD5, and fill with money (this is what we did) or get their tourist pass, which can be purchased for 1,2, or 3 days. There is a SD10 deposit required for this, but it is returned to you when you return the card. The best place to buy this is at the MRT stations themselves (there are about a dozen stations where this can be purchased and returned). Check the times that the box office is open to buy the pass (for example Orchard is open from 8am to 9pm. You need cash to buy it from an MRT station. The information is all available at the MRT website. There are other locations where you can purchase the tourist pass, but they add a surcharge."
,,Incredible transport system.,5.0,,We enjoyed the Singapore MRT once again. Fast clean trains to every point of the island. Helpful and informed staff are at your service.
,,Great Public Transport,5.0,,"One of the things I love about Singapore is its public transport. MRT is very clean (cos no one is allowed to have food and drinks on the MRT), arrives every 5 mins, so don't worry if you miss one and don't force the door to open when it's closing cos the system is driverless system. You can get around so easily with the MRT."
,,Efficient and perfect,5.0,,"Good connectivity, the lifeline of Singapore. Perfect connections with a mix of trains and buses. Very economical."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,The best way to move around Singapore is using the MRT. Easy to use and not very expensive if you buy the day passes.
,,Phase 1,5.0,,Used every day great to ride on clean punctual and no rubbish on the train. Easy to navigate we were very impressed with the MRT. Tickets are easily obtained like an oyster card
,,Very Easy for a Foreigner,5.0,,"Taking the MRT is a very cheap way of transport in Singapore, and very easy if you can read English. There is ample signage, making navigation in the stations and finding proper connections a breeze."
,,The cleanest and fastest subway I have ever experenced....,5.0,,"Clean, easy to use, English instructions everywhere. Just know that you cannot use a $10 bill. Only $5 or $2 or coin or a card. Many times in the MRT we witnessed young people offering their seats to older persons or women. It was wonderful. It is quiet and the wait for a train is never long. Even travelling the MRT at 3am we felt safe."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"Safe, clean, air conditioned and cheap. You can get all over most of Singapore using the MRT. Well worth a go!"
,,Fast but got stuck for awhile,3.0,,The trains here are generally fast and on time but sometimes it just stalls for awhile mid journey. The staff did not mentioned if it was a fault or not. Might be better to get a cab if you are aiming to reach somewhere by a certain time.
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is highly recommended. Coverage is broad, and it’s great value, as well as easy to navigate."
,,Definitely one of the most efficient transit systems in the world!,4.0,,"Travelling by taxi or privately rented cars can be quite expensive when you are in Singapore. The best way to move around the city without spending too much money and wasting time and without sacrificing comfort, is by taking the MRT. This transit system opened in 1987 continues to offer both locals and visitors the best way to move from one place to another within the city limits. It presently has 12 lines, identifiable by colors on the map. It connects you to bus lines, train lines, boat or ship lines and, of course, to the airport. I always take the MRT every time I visit Singapore. It's the easiest way to reach tourist destinations. Depending on how long you intend to stay in the city, I would suggest that you avail of the Singapore Tourist Pass which entitles you to take train and bus lines for an unlimited period of time (a day or 2 days or even 3 days, costing SG$10, SG$16 or SG$20, respectively). In this way you can save a bit and avoid the queue. The trains are clean and well-maintained, thanks to the discipline of Singaporeans and the prohibition to eat, drink or smoke or take any smelly foods on board. Thumbs up!"
,,A great way to get around the city,5.0,,"With a short visit to the City, I found the SMRT a wonderful way to get around all at a budget price. Excellent transportation service, with friendly staff to help."
,,The best transit system I have been to,5.0,,"I have been through couple of transit systems but must say SMRT is so far the best. If you want to navigate through Singapore, SMRT will take you to the maximum places. Plus the lines intersect at many places so you have an option to always find the shortest path to a palce through the web. The trains are driverless and still one of the safest in the world. You can use the SMRT card for the public buses as well as the SMRT cabs too."
,,Easy & cheap to use,5.0,,"Plenty of stations throughout the city & more planned, which makes it a walking distance to most hotels. Very easy access even for wheelchair uses with lifts at every station. This system is so cheap to use too."
,,Cheap and easy mode of transport,4.0,,Travelled from Bayfront station to Clarke quay. Cheap travel option as compared to local taxis or uber. Fast and efficient.
,,"CONVENIENT, CLEAN & CHEAP",5.0,,"The best way to get around Singapore and also very cheap. Maps are easy to read and follow by the numbers and colours and great value too. One of the cleanest subways , you never have to wait long for a train either."
,,Excellent way to get around the city.,5.0,,We took the subway from our hotel to Chinatown for a walking tour. The ticket booths were easy to follow and the people working there were very helpful in finding your train. Really well executed.
,,Very easy to use !,5.0,,"When you don't have network for ""grab"" !!! Simple and easy network. SMRT goes to all main tourist and popular places. frequency is ok. but not late in the evening !!!"
,,Unreliable transportation system,1.0,,This company is well known to provide u reliable transportation system. Frequent unschedule outage. If you need a transport for critical. Suggest you use bus or taxi.
,,One of the best MRT's around,5.0,,Singapore's MRT is one of the best and cleanest and most efficient MRT's I have experienced. We will often use it because it is inexpensive and takes you to all the main places where you'd want to visit and is very much cheaper than taking a taxi and less complicated than going by bus.
,,Excellent Convenient Reliable & Cleanest,5.0,,"Singapore MRT(Metro Network) is spread across the island, its very convenient , well connected to bus stops, frequent and timely service. Until 11:30 to 12 midnight easily accessible.
The train announcements are prompt and helpful always. Rules and policies are so good and strict that people dont eat drink or make a noise in metros. No push and rush by people, its the best and cost effective way to commute as well. Make a metro pass and it will work for both metro and bus services in Singapore. If you instead buy a ticket, you get to reap some benefit on recharging the same tickets 3rd and 6th time on your usage of the same ticket. But the metro pass is the most economical and easy.
I don't miss owning a car :)"
,,Crown Jewel,5.0,,"The Singapore Metro has to be the crown jewel of the city! It is excellent, the best I have travelled on. New, clean and modestly priced at around $1,50 per journey. Driverless trains whisk you speedily around a wide network of lines covering the whole of the city, and its not finished yet with another three years of expansion planned or in progress apparently. If you want to explore Singapore then this is the way to do it! Forget the rest. Brilliant!"
,,MRT to Marina Bay,4.0,,Station was clean. Friendly staff giving us direction and how to purchase ticket. The train arrived timely .
,,"Clean,fast, and organized",5.0,,"Absolutely no one can get lost on this system. Clear signs, maps at every stop and personnel that are friendly and helpful. Since I spend months at a time here, I buy a card that has a prepaid amount on it that is swiped as you enter and exit. Card works on the clean busses as well. I often spend the day riding around seeing neighborhoods and eating interesting food or going to local markets. Singapore is the safest place I have ever been so nowhere is off limits."
,,The MRT system is actually quite convenient,4.0,,"Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) system is actually operated by SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit. Depending on which transit system it is compared to, you will get different views on the Singapore MRT’s service, reliability and convenience. Despite its occasional train delays, the MRT system is actually quite convenient, with the expanding network covering the city state including Changi Airport. If you are making multiple trips, it’s often cheaper to buy a stored value card from TransitLink or if you are a tourist, a day pass (or 3-day pass). The stored value card allows you to transfer to public buses (and vice versa) to complete your trip at an incremental amount (ie. not full boarding charge) if transfer conditions are met (eg. transfer done within time limit, etc)."
,,Cleanest subway,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day tourist pass, that gave us unlimited rides on the subway and buses.At the end of the 3rd day we returned the pass and was refunded 10.00. The subway system was easy to navigate, and there was always someone, ready to help, if needed"
,,Good public transport system,4.0,,"The mrt system is very good and cover almost every corner in singapore. However, last minute connectivity is being managed by bus or cab. There might be reason for not extending the mrt system till very end of any tourist spot which I am not aware of. But definately any tourist can utilise a mix of mrt and bus to visit any tourist attraction in Singapore."

,,Be a Local,5.0,,"Being in a foreign country, we must try to be a local and experience their daily activities.MRT is the best way to travel and tour the city. All we need is just a single card that we could use either on mrt and buses."

,,Best transportation system,5.0,,"We took 2 EZ Card from the Airport. They have tourist passes. Easy to find, convenient, comfortable, fast, and cheap. The system has trains every few minutes and it was clean throughout. The staff were very helpful."
,,Left my Durians at home!!,4.0,,"So fantastic and easy.
DO NOT buy the passes they sell at the airport offering unlimited transport access for 3 days for $38 - typical MRT trips cost $.77 per trip! Not sure how you could get to $38 value in 3 days.
instead buy a card for $12 at stations, there is a non-refundable $5 cost but then you have $7 credit to start with. First three bus stops after you get off a train are also included in that train segment cost.

Despite that though, we were required to top up the value on the card when we got down to $2.75 - even though we only had one more cheap trip before we left. Minimum top-up on machines nes was $10. Not to worry - all is refundable (other than the $5 cost of the card.)

Really easy and people stopped to help us when we looked lost."
,,Best connected MRT system,5.0,,Singapore MRT is very efficient and you don’t have to walk more than 300 mtr to find a MRT station. Ticket price is also cheap.
,,Singapore’s SMRT is very efficient,5.0,,"I’ve always been impressed by Singapore’s commuting system, it is really fast and efficient, I only need a few minutes to wait for the next train. Just a few hiccups sometimes but I still think Singapore is doing a great job. Their approach of providing free bus rides when there are disruptions is quite impressive. Please keep up the good work."

,,Best transportation system,5.0,,"I am an Indonesian, where we don't have any advanced and integrated train system here.
And so far I've tried singapore and Thailand's MRT. And what can i say, singapore mrt is very efficient. Esp for single traveller. It cost close to nothing compare to taxi. For tourists, it's very easy to use the mrt. There are signs everywhere."
,,Love it !,5.0,,Great way to get around ! Very easy to use. I recommend getting an ezlink card. Easy to fill and use !
,,Gr8 transport system,5.0,,"The MRT could not be better ... the only way to get around , we bought a 3 day unlimited pass from the airport $30 ($10 refund if you return the card)... caught it into town into our accommodation, easy, then used it all the time .... the signage, maps etc are super easy to understand, the stations & trains are really clean & trains are often ✔️ - also luv the emojis for subway etiquette"
,,Easy,4.0,,Travelling by train in Singapore is very easy!! There is a station close by to any destination you want to get to. All colour coded.
,,Best mass transit experienced so far!,5.0,,"Ticket purchasing was easy, with maps clearly showing the various routes, each designated by a different color. Special seating is there for those handicapped, pregnant, or otherwise needing special se"
,,Mrt recommend,5.0,,"Only felt brave enough to use on our last day, wish we had used much earlier! If you come from a country where you have these systems, it will be a breeze. We don't in nz so wasn't new to us. Found a kiosk where a mam gave us really good instructions and was super easy! A taxi that cost us $12nz cost $3.60nz for us both to do the same route!"
,,Not difficult to use and not expensive,5.0,,"We avoided riding during rush-hours, so we did not encounter serious crowds. Ticketing could be done at machines or at a wicket with a person at the stations we visited. We had no trouble figuring out how to get from A to B, but you must take the time to study the system map."
,,Driverless - and without a guard !,5.0,,Spotless and cheap as chips - particularly if you use a Singapore Tourist Pass. Its by far the quickest and easiest way to get around about three quarters of the island.
,,Mass transit at it's best,5.0,,"The Singapore mass transit system is a study in efficiency. We purchased a limited use card and took several trips to a variety of locations around Singapore. The sinage was easy to understand, the system has trains every few minutes and it was clean throughout. The staff were very helpful and offered assistance before we asked. (we must have looked like tourists) Singapore is a wonderful multicultural city that is clean, safe and filled with excellent attractions."
,,"Clean, Efficient and Good value",5.0,,"Wow, never seen such a clean system. Never waited more than 4 minutes for a train. Queuing system worked really well, all it took were diagrams on the floor. London could learn a lot. Had a 2 day tourist pass, very good value for money"
,,"Convenient, fast, clean, cheap.",5.0,,"For me SMRT is the perfect option to visit different places in Singapore. It is reliable, convenient, fast, clean and cheap. A two-day pass is 16 Singaporean Dollars. Decent price for a perfect system."
,,Very systematic and organized,5.0,,"The MRT is the most efficient and safest way to get around Singapore. The network has been designed very systematically and it is very easy to get around using the MRT even for first time tourists. And just in case of confusion getting your tickets, feel free to seek guidance from the staff's in the kiosk at every MRT station. The MRT staff's are a very happy and helpful lot always more than willing to guide tourists and local alike. The tickets are reasonable priced and if you plan to travel excessively on the MRT they have Tourist passes available as well."
,,Easy-to-use mass transit system,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system is very easy to use. The maps are clear, the signage is good, and the ticket kiosks are understandable. The stations tend to have entrances in shopping malls, which makes it easy to pick up supplies if needed."
,,"Efficient, clean, great value.",5.0,,"Really easy to use, super efficient. Tourist travel pass great value and easy to top up. Easy access from the airport."
,,Terrific Transportation,5.0,,"Affordable, clean, safe, and easy to navigate. You can get anywhere in Singapore using the MRT. No need for rental car or even taxi."
,,"So cheap, so clean and easy to use",5.0,,"We bought a 3 day pass for the MRT from the airport as we weren't sure what to expect. Because of this we decided to get ourselves to our hotel using the MRT. People were very helpful if they saw you looking at maps and asking you where you wanted to go to. Having said that once we got out of the airport and had time to look more carefully, everywhere was signposted clearly as long as you knew where you were aiming for. We used our ticket 4 - 6 times a day going from one place to another very easily and quickly. So it gave us the chance to cover most of Singapore. Everywhere was spotless. On our way back to the airport our pass had run out so we bought a separate ticket which cost us all of €2.50!"
,,Always break down,1.0,,Always break down n and let people wait without and refund when the sld ask people is rushing to work... They should do something about it..
,,MRT,5.0,,"Superb service - clean, safe very very fast. Much better value than taxies Get a tourist ticket and ride ride ride!"
,,Very convenient,5.0,,Compare to other countries. So far singapore mrt is very convenient. Although there are some delays but its still understandable.
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"We travelled at all times of the day and always were impressed by the cleanliness and efficiencyl.
The metro and London underground could learn a lot from them.
Travel was cheap and in every carriage there are designated seating for older people (my husband and me included) and people with disabilities which are immediately given up by the very friendly local.
Maps are easy to follow"
,,Best metro system,5.0,,Singapore metro (known as mrt) connects entire Singapore with this getting around is easy through this . The transportation is cheap and quick .
,,Try the LRT,5.0,,The mrt is a quick and efficient way to move around Singapore. If you want to try something different then the LRT is the way to go. The two lines serve the housing estates at the far end of the main MRT line. They take you in a loop through the estates and as they are automated you can view your journey through the front window. It's an interesting perspective on how the townships are set up. If you want something new to do and off the beaten track this is it
,,Best Way to Travel,5.0,,"Easy to use and cheap transport system which covers the city. We normally take a taxi from the airport to city but tried MRT this time as there is a station at the airport and near our hotel. It took a bit longer but saved money and another experience
Forgot to mention very clean and safe."
,,Efficiency plus,5.0,,A great cheap way to get around. Wasn't disappointed in their Public Transport system. We used both the trains and buses on a pass.
,,Convenient and Easy to use,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) is probably the fastest way to zip around the city. The extensive rail network means that most of Singapore's key attractions are within walking distance from an MRT station. You can buy tickets for single trips, but if you intend to use the MRT and basic bus services frequently during your visit, you can buy a Singapore Tourist Pass. The special EZ link stored value will allow you unlimited travel for one day, two days or three days. The cards can be bought at Changi Airport and select MRT stations."
,,Very efficient way to get around,5.0,,"On our travels, we always like to use either local transport or foot, once you get your head around your location you are set. Agree with other reviews, efficient, clean, well signed and people around to help with your query. Fast service going to many areas with easy connections. Pass lasted for 3 days and we handed it in at the airport for a $10 refund. Highly recommend, and wish we had this system in Australia, as it makes ours look so pathetic"
,,A must,4.0,,"This is a clean safe and regular system. Station are easy to find and access, I mistook a platform for a concourse area it is so clean. Signage and maps are clear and easy to understand."
,,Puts London to shame,5.0,,"Got tourist pass which cost £3.50 a day or thereabouts. System is clean, safe, cheap. Tubes even have air conditioning. Great way to get around Singapore when you get used to it. Signs excellent and always staff about to put you in the right direction."
,,Excellent commute. But def not a tourist attraction in itself,5.0,,It's just a subway. But it's good enough for me to take it everyday so... just hope it doesn't break down while you're traveling
,,Fantastic System,5.0,,"What perfection! Could not ask for a better system. Highly efficient and very clear signage in english. As an Australian, this absolutely makes the Sydney train system look really really pathetic."
,,Wow,5.0,,"This is one of the best metros that I have ever used. It is clean, efficient, clearly marked, and reasonable. A 3 day unlimited pass is about $15 USD. There are cheaper places like Buenos Aires but the service is not as good. The trains are large, bright and clean. Airport to center Singapore in about 45 min for $3.75....not bad."
,,Oh Man what can I say,2.0,,Love to feel like a Sardine? Always overcrowded in peak time many times delayed especially the red line
,,"Cheap, massively efficient",5.0,,The MTR has only got better int he last 20 years. A world leader in mass transit. Cant think of another city that does it better.
,,Subway in Singapore: SMRT,5.0,,"Clean and efficient. The announcer says ""Happy happy platform"" when announcing the upcoming stop. There are staff within the stations to help tourists figure out how to use the system."
,,The best cleanest timliest public transit in the world,5.0,,"We used all aspects of the public transport system and were blown away with the efficiency, cleanliness and polite manners of the passengers. Singapore is easy to get around, an awesome place to travel!"
,,Easy way to travel,5.0,,A cheap and easy way to navigate the city. Just make sure you have small notes or change for the ticket machines.
,,Great way to get around,4.0,,If you are fed up with heavy traffic this is a great way to get around Singapore. The carriages are spacious and very clean and travel to most parts of the city. There are different routes but the maps in the station are very easy to understand and getting a ticket from the machine was easy. Definitely beats sitting in traffic.
,,breakdowns,1.0,,The trains schedule will usually be a mess during peak hours and faults is a daily basis kind of thing...other than that is okay except for those mentioned.
,,Clean and easy to get around,5.0,,Buy an EZ link card and put some money on it and getting around is a breeze. Great service to use Quick and easy and safe
,,Brilliant,5.0,,So clean and quiet with map which shows where you are on the line. AND completely automatic. Most impressive.
,,"Excellent way to get around Singapore,",5.0,,We bought two day passes which permits unlimited rides on all public transportation. We were able to visit all of the primary tourist sites this way. The Singapore subway system is really great.
,,My favourite trasport in Singapore,5.0,,"For some it may not convenient to make long walk to SMRT stations, however I love this transport method due to it is very little chance we get lost. All signage is very clear. GPS signal is not always accurate in Singapore and we experience some miss-leading direction upon using GPS on our phone. Tips, remember the directions of our train to avoid jump on a wrong direction."
,,Clean,5.0,,"The SMRT is super clean but you are not allowed to eat or drink anything. I had a bottle of water and accidentally took a drink, I didn't get in trouble but it could have been a $500.00 fine. If you are going to be using the subway, you should get to a station where you can get a reloadable card instead of using the temporary cards (those can be reloaded 6 times) because the discount on the reloadable plastic SMRT cards give you a much better discount than the temporary cards you get if buy them as you travel. We were not able to use our VISA cards from the United States, we had to take cash out of the ATM and make sure we had small bills to pay (because we didn't use the reloadable card and paid as we went)."
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Easy, convenience, cheap and super easy to get around. When one is travelling in Singapore, using MRT is the best option."
,,So far so good,4.0,,The trip between Harbourfront to chagi was good. There's a staff near the ticketing machine who helped us with the top up. Great job
,,Clean and easy to maneuver!,5.0,,"The SMRT was a great way to get around Singapore. The trains are super clean and air conditioned, which is great in the heat. There are maps of the different lines in each station, so it's really easy to figure out. And the trains run super quickly, so even if you just miss your train, another one will be only a few minutes away."
,,Easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,We always use the MRT when visiting Singapore. We find it a reliable and inexpensive way to travel around the city and the carriages are always clean and the platform staff friendly and helpful.
,,Well managed system,5.0,,Just loved travelling by the train service. From the time of buying tickets to boarding everything is so fast and easy. One of the most economical mode of transport in singapore.
,,Very easy to use.,5.0,,"This is what mrt should be. Schedules are met, train cars are clean and how i really wished that something like this exists in my country."
,,Efficient and Frequent - Clean Too,5.0,,"Trains run about every 3 minutes during rush hour and every 5-6 minutes at other times. Very clean with great signage. Visitors should get the EZ Link Card proving access to the MRT and most busses. Cost is 20 SGD for three days. An additional 10SGD deposit is required but refunded upon turn in. (Only accepts Master Card or cash.). In two trips, the only place we couldn’t get to easily on the MRT was the Zoo - had to cab it."
,,Very easy system to understand and use,5.0,,Once again i was very impressed with the ease of getting around the system and its use. We never have a problem using the MRT.
,,Efficient and affordable!,5.0,,"Their MRT is efficient and a cost effective way to get around. As a tourist, you are better off buying the 2 or 3 day pass. It just makes it worry free. Just makre sure you return it at the end of your trip to get your $10 refund. If you cannot return it to the MRT office in one fo the stops near your hotel, then you can do so at Changi airport before checking in for your flight!"
,,Impressived,5.0,,Extremely impressed with how easy the train werr to use in singapore. The staff were helpful. The reusable tickets are a great idea
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Brilliant way of getting round Singapore. Cheap, reliable, clean, safe, air conditioned. Runs early morning until late in the evening. It’s nearly always busy, but the air conditioning helps greatly.

You will need an EZ-link card (S$12) or Singapore Tourist Pass (S$10 - S$20 depending on how long you’re staying). You can also buy single tickets, but the card is so much easier.

There’s no eating or drinking (including water, and durians!) on Singapore public transport, so watch out for this."
,,Maps on net out of date or just wrinfg,3.0,,It's a nerve racking experience even for the most frequent fliers but it's the lack of adequate signage which makes it hard to get round with lines not even on some maps others I assume just guess.
,,The best transport in the world,5.0,,"We were in Singapore 2004 and were amazed by this awesome transportation and still are. It is so ease, clean and fast, don't even need other transport here."
,,"Clean, simple and inexpensive",5.0,,"Get that EZ link card asap. You may also opt for the tourist card that offers unlimited travel for 1-3 days. But, if your stay is beyond that, EZ link is the way to go. There is a reason there is no lines at MRT ticket machines - Everyone is using EZ link!"
,,Efficient clean transport system,5.0,,"Very good, clean and easy to use. It is just a small place compared to other city transit systems, but very good nonetheless."
,,Extremely efficient,5.0,,"One of the best in the world. Very convenient,clean , cool & very helpful captains.the connection between MRT & busses etc is very easy"
,,The only way to travel around Singapore!,5.0,,"Loved using the SMRT. We downloaded the app, planned our trips, got a tourist card and off we went! We never had any trouble finding our way. It’s organized, clean, and easy to use. The only trouble is you don’t get much of a view of the city as you travel around."
,,Outstanding!,5.0,,"The best way to travel around Singapore, it offers a frequent service to all parts of the city, other countries could learn from them, it is clean and very efficient."
,,Inexpensive way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is an inexpensive way to travel throughout the city.

You can easily get to most places within the city for just a couple of Singapore dollars. It’s clean, punctual and pretty easy to use.

We would use the MRT next time in Singapore."
,,A ride by itself,5.0,,"The cleanest, most efficient, subway system in the world. Riding it is, by itself, an experience. Just watch your chewing gum, it is strictly prohibited."
,,Can’t beat 77 cents work each morning,5.0,,"And that’s 27 cents before 7.30am. Sure, it’s efficiency has dropped in recent years but it’s still dependable, reliable and highly cost effective."
,,The most effective mass transport system in the world.,5.0,,"We travelled either by underground or bus to visit the attractions of Singapore. Trains leave at least every 5 minutes for the respective destinations. We also went by bus from our hotel to the ""Gardens on the Bay"", which was also an enjoyable trip. The trains and busses are super-clean and one is not allowed to either eat or drink on board. It is quite cheap if you buy a ticket for an extended period."
,,Makes our tube seem a bit old fashioned,5.0,,Bought the 3 day tourist pass and used it extensively. Trains are clean and easy to use and the information onboard would be great to have onm London tubes
,,Wow magical,5.0,,Love the rapid transport with driverless drivers on the in. Everyone is polite and waits behind the lines till doors open once train tops and air conditioning is fantastic so cool really appreciated. Use a card as we do here for transport and very cheap. Train lines are underground and easy to catch trains and only wait a few minutes between train arrivals. Definitely recommend the trains .
,,Efficient and affordable,5.0,,"The whole network is very easy to understand so I could easily get from point A to point B. Just grab a card at any metro station (not bus stops) and then recharge it if you run out of credit (minimum recharge is 10 $). Whenever you enter a stop or bus, you will be shown how much money you have left when you validate the card. Also we had some ladies help us recharge at the machines, so no way to get lost in the process.
All the buses and metro cars I've been into were very quiet and clean. Definitely the best way to get around Singapore."
,,Clean and very well serviced,5.0,,"You have a station at almost every place you wanna go, both metro and bus. Maps are everywhere, hours are well respected and all indications are where you would need them to be. Thumbs up to their staff : so nice and helpful for any request -they are also quick and efficient in any request."
,,Inexperienced with mass transit but it took me legitimately one train ride to figure out the whole system,5.0,,"Honestly, I live in Detroit and our mass transit is awful so I am very inexperienced with it. Singapore’s is absolutely incredible. It took us one train ride to figure out how everything worked and it works seamlessly. Zero delays, everything is labeled very easily and it’s rather quick. If you are a tourist in Singapore, do yourself a favor and right when you get to the airport buy the tourist pass. It costs between $20 and $30 but they refund $10 when you return the cards back. You legit can get anywhere you want in the city just by subway but the tourist pass allows you to make use of the bus system as well. We only used the subway because the subway got us close enough to anywhere we wanted to go where walking wasn’t an issue. Also, it’s a beautiful city/state so walking is rather enjoyable as well."
,,Easy transportation method,5.0,,"Easy, fast and safe metro to use in Singapore. Cheap as well, everything is also in English and every car has a map telling where next. Extra points for the funny cards!"
,,Singapore transport,4.0,,Used the MRT regularly for 3 days. Was incredibly efficient and clean. Recommend if touring Singapore that you buy the 2 day tourist ticket as is much more economical if using a lot. Station staff also very helpful
,,Very helpful,5.0,,"Its an easy transportation, we could go around the city with this. But its very crowded at morning and dusk in the weekdays. So you couldn't sit. Its clean, fast, and organized."
,,Very organized and structured!,5.0,,"Its even better than subway in America. I have respect for Singaporean. They can be a bit cold and unfriendly (rarely smile) but they actually are very considerate and helpful when asked for help. The MRT also direct, easy and efficient to ride on even for a first timer. Not to mention its very clean!"
,,SMRT,5.0,,Great and convenient takes you to all the main attractions. Fares from 77 cents Best way of getting around l!
,,Very good,4.0,,Once you get the hang of it it's fantastic. Very very cheap and easy to get around. Would highly recommend it to tourists. Safe and clean.
,,Wonderful cheap way to see the city,5.0,,"So simple to use, always clean and efficient! Very cheap for tourists with a special ticket! Loved it!"
,,Great way to get around the city - go underground and use the MRT,5.0,,"Easy to buy a card that you can then top up - similar to London's Oyster card. Great service, cool on the MRT too. Trains clean. Easy to find your way around."
,,Smooth trip but confusing ticketing,3.0,,"We wanted to travel just a few stops, found an SMRT station and tried to work out how to get a ticket - enquiry desk said ""use the machine"" ... we did and were given two tokens that looked just like the donation tokens in Tesco!!
No one told us what to do with them as it looked as though you should put them into something ... but eventually at the gate someone helped us and all we had to do was present the disc to the machine!!
Beware and give yourself time to find out"
,,Very convinience subway,5.0,,"The Mass Rapid Transit, or MRT, is a rapid transit system forming the major component of the railway system in Singapore, spanning most of the city-state. The earliest section of the MRT, between Toa Payoh and Yio Chu Kang, opened on 7 November 1987. The network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the public transport system in Singapore, with an average daily ridership of 3.031 million in 2015 (including the Light Rail Transit (LRT)), approximately 78% of the bus network's 3.891 million in the same period.

The MRT network encompasses 199.6 kilometres (124.0 mi) of route, with 119 stations in operation, on standard gauge. The fully automated Circle, Downtown and North East Lines form the longest fully automated metro network in the world.[3][4] The lines are built by the Land Transport Authority, a statutory board of the Government of Singapore, which allocates operating concessions to the profit-based corporations, SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit. These operators also run bus and taxi services, thus facilitating full integration of public transport services. The MRT is complemented by a small number of local LRT networks in Bukit Panjang, Sengkang and Punggol that link MRT stations with HDB public housing estates."
,,A Pleasant Mode of Transport,5.0,,"This underground system is clean and very easy to use as the signs are in English. The carriages are spacious and the overhead route is easy to follow. The tickets are cheap but one snag we found was that some ticket machines do not take $10 notes and unless you are aware of this,the machine just spits it out and you spend time putting it in various ways to see if it will accept it!"
,,Reliable except at night,5.0,,"Reliable and accessible. Well connected to most places and its growing rapidly so that eventually most population clusters will be within walking distance of an MRT. Trouble is the service is not available at night and most lines close at 11.30. So keep your phone handy to Grab or Uber home. Or sit back for a long wait if you want to get a night bus, but that's another story."
,,A nice ride ...,5.0,,"We live near a city with a subway system....and in comparison the system in Singapore is better organized, easier to follow as a non-local, full of helpful sineage, very clean, inexpensive and also full of helpful workers to direct you in a most pleasant fashion if you even look lost for a few seconds. Great and very organized way to get around Singapore. Hard to beat in terms of mass transit systems I have experienced."
,,Amazing underground metro train!!!!,5.0,,MRT is a must visit when u r in singapore...it is very clean and nice ..very spacious also...fare is also cheap compared to taxis.....they also give a pass for tourists which is cheaper than individual tickets......plz keep in mind that drinking and eating is prohibited and is a crime in MRT As per law in singapore......chewing gum is also banned......
,,Excellent subway and buses,5.0,,"I come from NYC and Singapore’s transit system puts ours to shame. It is clean, new, efficient. I even loved their “give up your seat” campaign for kindness to other travelers!"
,,Great MRT - connections excellent and so clean,5.0,,"Singapore has got it right! MRT connections are great and also tie in with the bus service near to the stations. Carriages are immaculate - eating and drinking prohibited. Travellers are encouraged to be respectful to those who needed a seat. Frequently noticed younger people standing up for the elderly. The signage is good both on the train and in the station. Even at weekends, there are so many trains! The UK should learn from this!"
,,Easy,5.0,,"Just went for a joy ride really and was super easy, ticket machines easy to operate (need change) clean and fast was great to see public transport done so well"
,,Excellent Mode of Transport,4.0,,"An excellent way to travel. Convenient, clean, fast, excellent directions and cheap. Useful to choose a hotel in walking distance of an MRT Station"
,,Best way to get around!,5.0,,"Don’t use anything else! These trains are on time, efficient and easily accessible and not expensive. The only way to travel around a very busy city!"
,,Outstanding,5.0,,"The MRT is as good as it gets. Spotlessly clean, safe and efficient. It covers Singapore and never had to wait more than a few minutes for a train. Definitely, a great way to get around"
,,The MRT is a great easy way to get all-around Singapore.,5.0,,"Make sure you have Singapore currency when riding on the MRT, that you have five Singapore dollars or less in cash as that is the largest about the ticket box excepts. They do not except credit cards."
,,"Efficient, Affordable. Clean",5.0,,"Primarily used the underground service with Singapore Mass Transit. The stations, platform, and the subway trains are clean. The system is user friendly. My family and I used it to get to all the tourist attractions that we visited. Granted my benchmark is very low coming from the US where the public transport is inefficient and the infrastructure is dated in most big cities and, non-existent in the suburbs and medium to smaller size cities."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Visited many places using the MRT. Very cheap and quick. Busy in rush hour, but not overly crowded. Staff are helpful and friendly. You will need cash for the ticket machines. Credit cards don't seem to work."
,,Perfect service,5.0,,"The best way to travel in singapore, very clean, fast, not so crowded and easy to use! Machines do not accept credit cards."
,,user friendly,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Transit (underground!) is the most disabled user friendlyI have come across - lift access throughout and good wide walkways to accommodate wheelchairs. Also, as with just about all of Singapore, meticulously clean - no litter even though there are no litter bins!"
,,Clean,4.0,,"Very clean and convenient. It is connected to almost every mall in town and point of interest.
Passengers(locals, well I assume they are) have their eyes on their mobile phones all the time. You'll be amazed, well, at least I was. Even when they were entering or leaving the train, they didn't bother to pause their videos or games.
If you're taking the MRT a lot, you can get an EZlink card, that'll save you money and time. Make sure you have your card topped up in less crowded stations, or else you'll have to be in a long queue, because the machines were very limited."
,,"Hazzle free travelling, brill",5.0,,"Such an easy , hazzle free way of getting around all over Singapore, really reasonable & so easily accessible for everyone 👍🏻😊"
,,Efficient and affordable,5.0,,The MRT system in Singapore is very efficient and affordable way of getting around. We were able to get to all our locations with minimal hassle. We used the Singapore MRT LRT offline iPhone app to help us navigate through the MRT
,,Quick travel,5.0,,"The SMRT is the best I’ve seen so far even better than London’s, it’s cheap easy to navigate quick and has trains coming going connecting every few minutes each way as well as clean. People very helpful to assist when seen your in a bit of a dilemma. Really no need for taxis or expensive transfers."
,,Other cities take note...,5.0,,"This has got to be the most efficient transport system around and it is inexpensive and easy to use. The trains are clean with clear signage, a PA system that is distortion free and it makes getting around Singapore so easy.
The ticket machines are easy to use and there are several languages to choose from and they give change. Beware of some of the escalators as they do seem rather quicker than most! Platforms and entrance halls are spacious and clean and even late at night, we felt perfectly safe.
There are no traffics jams and the Singapore MRT represents the gold standard of this type of transport system."
,,Too easy,5.0,,"First time taking the MRT and found it an extremely easy, cheap and efficient way to get around Singapore. Tell the ticket machine where you want to go and it does everything else.
Have a plan in place to be quick though, Singaporeans don't like to wait =)"
,,Brilliant! A very efficient system.,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) is great. There are underground stations at virtually any place in Singapore that a tourist is likely to visit. The stations are clean, air conditioned and modern. The trains are frequent, fast and immaculate. I have used the London Underground, the N.Y. subway, the Hong Kong MTR and the Paris Metro Singapore beats them all. The fares are cheap the passengers considerate and the travelcard is also used on the extensive bus network.

There are new lines under construction which are due for completion in 2020 so the network will soon be even better."
,,Perfect mass transportation in Singapore,5.0,,"It's easy, user friendly and great connectivity are very helpful for travellers who want to go around any destination in the city efficiently."
,,Superb,5.0,,"The system is very easy to use and squeaky clean and safe as most places are in Singapore, except for Little India."
,,Easy to navigate,4.0,,"Cheap, clean, easy to navigate what more can you want. One of the best underground systems I have been on. Penalty for smoking is 1000 dollars, for dropping litter 500 dollars, wonderful."
,,Excellent Transport System,5.0,,"When in Singapore I always use the MRT, its fast, easy to navigate and very cheap. I think I topped my card up with $10 and it lasted a week with some left on it."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Been using it several times now everytime I visit sg! Works great and cheap if ure alone, but if ure visiting with more than 2 people I recommend u to just take the cab, it will be cheaper!"
,,Fabulous,5.0,,It's just perfect - how public transport should be. The world should use Singapore as an example of how to run a public transport system.
,,Great Connectivity,5.0,,"On Time, Very Good Connectivity, Hassel free Travel. Connects to all tourist destinations. MRT stops are not far away from anywhere, just walking distance away. 10-15 mins max"
,,So easy to navigate,5.0,,"Travelled by train from Botanic Garden and then to the airport. Clear signage everywhere, cost minimal."
,,New card system less convenient,3.0,,"The MRT is an efficient way to see Singapore. However it used to work on a plastic card system you could buy at the stations and top up and also get money back when you put the card back in. Now you have to buy paper tickets for certain legs. I think the old system was better for tourists. There is a card you can buy and top up from 7/11 etc. If you want but no refund on unised credit.
Some of the station toilets are very dirty also with no paper."
,,Unreliable service,2.0,,"Most of the time rack breakdown and delay, unreliable service. No maintenance for Long term, signalling fault, flooded in tunnel and unresponsive management."
,,SMRT in SG,5.0,,"SG have a great public transportation, firts come on nov 2017 with my mom I'm going everywhere by MRT.

But last visit this february with my friends, I took bus too.

My experience using this public transportation so Happy. Fast, clean, clear and sharp. But my thoughts when I need transit and going to another line, sometimes walk too far away (just because I am too lazy for walk wkwkwkwkk)."
,,Ease of travel,5.0,,Perfect way of getting around Singapore using a Tourist pass (3 day pass costs S$30 with a S$10 refund if used card is returned within 5 days of ending) obtainable from most MTR stations. Easy to use if you remember what entrance you used (from A to F) for when you return. Remember the lines to use as they are denoted by two letters (North East line - NE; North South line - NS; Downtown line - DT) and it is very easy. Everywhere are escalators. And hang on tight as they move off like a jet taking off!
,,Efficient and clean - of course.,5.0,,We used the MRTS during the day outside peak hours and found it to be an excellent way of getting about.
,,The MRT is the ONLY way to go!,5.0,,"The MRT station map is a breeze to read and the train youwill take you anywhere you want to go. It's fun to ride and be with the locals. There is no food or drink allowed so the trains are extremely clean! We bought a three day ticket which included rides on the city buses (also clean, safe, and easy to use) and on the end of the third day, we got $10 back each as a refund. We have only paid $20 for the three day ticket, so we thought that was a WONDERFUL deal. The only downside is you have to use Singapore dollar to purchase the tickets. Only certain MRT stations accept credit cards, but the stations we visited only took cash. However, if you are staying in Singapore, even if only for a few days, you'll want to find a money changer and get some Singapore dollars. The best money changers are located in the malls."
,,Great way to get arround,5.0,,Good transportation. Cash only need 5 dollar bills or less. Helpful employees. Electronic scan cards to get on and off.
,,"Very cheap, very clean, very efficient",5.0,,"Excellent travel option in Singapore. If you're there for a while get a travel pass or an EZlink card. Very cheap, efficient and extremely easy to use"
,,The best way to explore Singapore,4.0,,"MRT is always my fave transportation exploring Singapore.
Everytime I visited Singapore either for business or pleasure, using MRT is a very affordable transportation, quick and almost with no time waiting in every major stations I ever been.
Although once in a while, especially in a not so hot afternoon I chose to walk around rather using MRT, usually I chose it for a transportation back to my accomodation after a tiring day.
Once I tried to walk from Orchard to Marina Bay and Esplanade, I checked in google map it was about 5KM, and about 5-6 MTR stations, it was a really joyful walk looking around the scenery and all stuffs."
,,Travel by SMRT In Singapore,5.0,,"I purchased a SMRT card for travel on bus, and MRT. what a City to travel around in with the smart card, and the friendly and efficient way the staff conduct this attraction ra specially for senior citizens, majority of people speak English and are happy to assist. A great way to enjoy your stay in this City/Country. Very safe and friendly"
,,MRT 👍👍👍,5.0,,"We purchased a 3 day pass and were able to use with a double side by side stroller
Very clean, easy to use, I downloaded an app that helped plan a day ahead what train line or bus I needed to use
Great mode of transport around singapore"
,,Rapid,5.0,,"You take the bus if you’re not in a hurry and want to see something. If not, take the most accurate and cleanest way of transport Singapore has to offer."

,,Gurcharan Sachdeva,5.0,,It is always a pleasure and a blessing to have SMRT close to you. Thanks you Singapore and the team at SMRT to constantly satisfy the customers and maintain such high standards consistently
,,Avoid peak hours,4.0,,"The train tracks are undergoing some repair works now.Avoid morning and evening peak hours if you can. Trains do cover most major tourist maps. Convenient way to get around the island for food,fun or just see how the islanders live."
,,Try if time is no concern,3.0,,This mode of transport varies widely in the service levels and meeting expectations. It can arrive and reach destination promptly or be delayed for reasons that can be acceptable or simply incredible. So try if time to reach destination is not important at all.
,,Excellent service!,5.0,,Excellent service! Easy to travel around and see all the beautiful sightseeing places! The SMRT is cheap and easy to use.
,,Fast and clean,4.0,,The network is complete. You can take MRT to most of the places in Singapore. Use EZlink card can bring you the most cost efficient on you travel.
,,Clean & Efficient,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, clean and orderly! Stayed between 3 stations, able to get around with ease. Runs smoothly and efficient. Felt safe at all times."
,,"Efficient, Clean and Safe",5.0,,The title really says it all. Has to be the cleanest transit in the world. The rules are a little draconian but it makes for a clean and safe system. Would not hesitate to recommend. A lot of it seems air conditioned which makes it more comfortable in this humid climate.
,,the best way to move around Singapore,5.0,,we purchased a two day 'tourist card' and had unlimited travel. Services are punctual and clean. Maps and signs are easy to understand.
,,Christmas,5.0,,Omg this public transport is fantastic and cheap. Very easy to get around and use. A lot of other countries could learn a lot from t Singapore’s public transportation.
,,Clean,5.0,,OMG! This is the cleanest public transit that I've ever seen! It's very efficient and clean! You are not allow to eat or drink on the MRT! The people on the train are very polite and courteous!

,,Amazing Way to get to all the places in Singapore,5.0,,Purchase a ticket at the kiosk for S$15 which gives you S$7 to use for your journeys. Easy to follow maps/directions. Exceptionally clean. Ease of access to all areas of Singapore with less hassle.
,,always reliable and very affordable!,5.0,,"Singapore public transport is one of the best in the world! And the SMRT is very reliable and easily affordable, It covers almost if not all parts of Singapore. It is very clean and runs timely and very very rarely do you hear of any breakdowns."
,,"Clean, Safe",5.0,,Spent two weeks at a friend's condo. This system is the best we've been on. Very simply to follow. Would recommend their transportation system to the most novice traveler.
,,Needs improvement,2.0,,Decades of non-maintainance has led to this train system being unreliable. Trains break down on a regular basis unlike more than a decade ago during Singapore heydays.
,,Expo,5.0,,"The means of transport are sooo efficient and clean. Everything works perfectly. It's not allowed to eat, to drink..so respect their rules. They deserve it."
,,weigh getting the tourist pass,4.0,,"We were in Singapore 6 days and bought the 3 day tourist pass twice. I probably would not do it again.

First it is a process to get.Only a few stations sell it and not at all hours.
Second you have to buy the pass AND the card it goes on -$10 extra. Returning the card has a short window and is very hard to do.

Third it works out to $10 a day for the 3 day pass and more for 1 or 2 day. you need about 4 trips a day to break even. single trips or if there for a few days get a regilar card and load it with what you need."
,,My MRT rides,5.0,,Easy connectivity. We rode all the way to Jurong East. Love how timing were very accurate for each journey and it is easier to plan our time.
,,Everyone is willing to help,5.0,,"We went from Chinatown as we could get a direct train to the Marina Bay Sands complex but was faced with a ticket machine no help desk or ticket office. However there are plenty of people working here who speak English & the machine is also in English but it only takes notes no larger than 5 or coins. Announcements are made on the train or you can follow the signs. Very easy to use, clean & efficient."
,,Cheap and easy to use,5.0,,Not much else to say. Cheap. Fast. Simple. Clean. Used it to get all around the city quickly and efficiently
,,Be conscious of Priority seating!,4.0,,"Each train section has 2 priority seats on each end, with icons of old, pregnant, handicapped or injured people.

It is fine to sit if there are none of the above, but recommended to offer the seat to somebody that needs it more than you.

Just a note for travellers to watch out for these people boarding along your journey :)

Easy and quick service to self purchase tickets, good to have loose change like coins or 2-10 dollars notes for quick purchase."
,,The Best Subway System in the World,5.0,,"Nothing really comes close. Clean, easy to navigate, dirt cheap,every other city wishes they had Singapore's metro system."
,,Spotlessly clean,4.0,,"I have travelled by underground train in many places in the world but this is different. Modern and absolutely spotless. No graffiti, no litter.
The trains run efficiently. The ticket machines are easy to use and are in four languages including English. Fares are relatively cheap.

The system is safe and monitored by abundant CCTV and a host of inspectors."
,,Information about the Singapore Tourist Pass (STP),5.0,,"First of all: we loved it - fast, clean, convenient, inexpensive

What is it about: pay once and travel as much as you like using the SMRT (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit)

Types of passes: there is the STP (the public version) and the STP+ (the commercial version). The STP+ is more expensive and includes some vouchers from restaurants or museums which didn't make sense to us.

Where to buy the STP: only at selected stations (see photo)

What does it cost: 1/2/3 days at $10/16/20 plus a deposit fee of $10

About the deposit fee: you get the $10 back if you return the card (see photo for locations)

How to use it: check in at the train station where you start (by pressing the card to the receiver of the gate), change trains as often as you want, and check out at your destination

Safe travel!"
,,Good connections to Singapore attractions,4.0,,"The SMRT has good connections to all of singapore's main attractions. While Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo are not located near a metro station, there is good bus connectivity."
,,MRT,4.0,,Pretty vast area are covered and sometimes can be a better option than taxis now that Spore have some traffic congestion.
,,"Easy to navigate, frequent services",5.0,,"We bought EZEPass cards for our few days in Singaopre - well worth doing as it simplifies the use of tube trains and buses. Services are frequent, trains and stations clean. It's easy totop up the card at machines on the station. Unused credit on the card can be reclaimed at any MRT station at the end of your trip,less a $5 admin charge. Visitors need a passport to buy and return the card. Remember to touch the card to the screen when entering and leaving a bus."
,,Efficient and reasonably priced way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"I purchased a tourist pass - was SGD38, about £20 and this provided me with 3 days of travel around Singapore on the MTR, trams and buses. It was easy to navigate where I wanted to go to, the MTR's were air conditioned which was nice and everywhere was spotlessly clean."
,,cheap and easy to get around,5.0,,Hubby & I had so much fun finding our way round we literally travelled everywhere using the train system or the bus
,,Experience MRT,5.0,,Good Network across the city on time connects to almost all place in singapore A must Experience if you visit Singapore
,,Fantastic transport,5.0,,"Cheap, easy to use. Reliable and fast way to get around Singapore. Runs on time, strict rules. No eating or drinking on board."
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"So easy to use and good value. Lots of pricing options too. Clean and spacious. Simple map to follow. On using ticket machine, just know your stop and you tap the screen and bingo!!! Easy"
,,Very good transport system.,4.0,,"Travelled from Devor to Little india. I think they charge around $1.7 for a ticket. Train station is good, easy sign boards and staff are helpful to people who are new. I think it is better to travel by MRT to avoid traffic and cost economic."
,,Best transport in Singapore,5.0,,"I am a repeat visitor for Singapore since our son lives here. This subway system is well used and very transparent in its use. We usually get a rechargeable MRT card and top it up once the funds run low. The MRT will bring you almost everywhere but there are places that you need to hail a taxi, which is quite reasonable here in Singapore. Please do heed the warning of No Eating (chewing gum) or drinking, No Durian and No Smoking etc, because Singapore is a “Fine” city (^_^). The peak commuting hours should be avoided because the slightly higher fare and the very crowded trains. The MRT card is also valid for the busses and some public swimming pools."
,,Airport to city centre.,5.0,,Absolutely perfect. Our trip was one quick change at the Expo station - as everybody has to - and we were straight into town.
,,My favorite thing about Singapore,5.0,,"This was the best thing that made our travel through the city really enjoyable. Clean, easy to navigate, extremely helpful staff at the stations, on-time service and reasonable prices, even when you do not buy tourist passes - were the notable features of the MRT.
Most of the MRT stations were easy to access from wherever you are and many of the stations link to malls. It's the most-efficient mode of transport in Singapore (and other such cities e.g. London, Hong Kong etc.)"
,,FAST AND EASY,5.0,,Best mode of transportation in Singapore ! Easy to access ticketing system and hassle free travel across the city. Would recommend taking three day pass.
,,Very efficient and easy to use,5.0,,"Very good system of transport, only problem is trying to buy a Tourist discount ticket, why don't they sell them at every air port terminal, and why do they make you join a queue with 50 people in at the MRT station at Terminal 2 to get your S$10 deposit back.
Suggest you get your ticket deposit back in town and save /0 min queue."
,,Fantastix,5.0,,We haven't used train services in any country before. This train system was easy to use and very efficient.
,,Reliable transport,5.0,,"Singapore, has easy, reliable and affordable transport systems in place. The MRT (similar to London Tube system), is clean, regular and easy to use.

You are encouraged not to eat or drink snacks, on the platform and trains and this helps to keep everything clean. Tickets are easy to acquire and staff at all stations are helpful and friendly if you have any problems.

I did not at any time, feel uncomfortable or unsafe while travelling whether alone or with my husband."
,,Quick and cheap way to get round Singapore,4.0,,We decided to try the SMRT as road traffic was heavy and slow so taxi was not a good option. We were surprised at how easy it was to use. Tickets have to be bought from ticket machines but these are touch screen and very user friendly with everything in English. There are manned booths for advice or to get change although the ticket machines take credit cards. The route maps are clear and similar in style to London Underground maps. The SMRT is heavily used by the Singapore public so expect a bustling experience and at the stations with multiple lines it can be a bit confusing. Staff and local people are all very helpful and friendly so don’t be afraid to ask if you are unsure as to whether you are going north or south! Trains are frequent and quick and air conditioned. We enjoyed the experience and would certainly use it again to get round Singapore.
,,One of the best mass transit systems,5.0,,Singapore is one of the best places to visit in Asia because of thr MRT. It is very easy to commute from one place to the other. The trains are big and can fit strollers. All train stations have an elevator that are only being used by the elderly or those with strollers. There are apps or even googlemaps can be used to know how to get to your next destination.
,,"Clean, efficient way to travel",4.0,,"We took the subway to visit some people in the suburbs, The stops are very clearly marked, the trains and stations spotless and no traffic to contend with. I'd definitely recommend taking the subway."
,,SMRT is fantastic for visiting Singapore,5.0,,Get a tourist pass and explore Singapore with ease. The MRT is fantastic in every way. It accesses a large area with all of the lines and is clean and easy to navigate.
,,"Very fast, efficient and easy to use",5.0,,"The tannoys speak in four different languages - hopefully one of them works for you! It was very cheap, efficient and easy to use as an outsider. But I'm from London and I am used to an underground transit system."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, on time...who can ask for more ! Everything runs like clockwork and the ticketing staff are incredibly helpful. Many of the stations link to malls and have stall, shops and eateries. What is there not to like...well done Singapore MRT."
,,"Reliable, fast, economical",5.0,,"When travelling I always find myself comparing the train system to Singapore's, and (at least unless there is a breakdown) Singapore's MRT is with the top players, efficient, economical and reliable."
,,Super transport system,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and inexpensive: a great way for travellers to see Singapore's many and varied sights!"
,,The best transportation!,4.0,,"I used mrt many times when i was there. It was great. You wont lose, the information is so detail. Nice!"
,,"Efficient, Easy and Cost Effective",5.0,,"Fantastic, convenient, cheap way to travel. Don't buy a Tourist Day Pass though as they cost $10/ day. Purchase a hard plastic ticket like the locals use (it costs about $14 but comes with $8 credit) and you can just top it up as you need to. Much, MUCH cheaper than $10 per day. We took it all the way to Changi airport from Clarke Quay and it only cost us $1.70c. Much cheaper than any other form of transport. Convenient too."
,,See more of Singapore,5.0,,"After our hop on bus tickets expired, we had to get back to our hotel. We saw a SMRT entry and went down. Once inside, we had to learn where we were going, what it would cost, and use a debit card to Singapore dollars.
All could be done in the station, and the locals were offering to help, to buy tickets for us. After we got tickets, the ride was easy. Since Singapore is one city, the SMRT is a great way to get around."
,,The best subway I've been on,5.0,,"This subway is fast, clean, and safe. I never had a time where I couldn't ask a worker a question and they always knew the answer. My son who is 6 got to ride unlimited for free as well."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,We bought a three day tourist pass and used the SMRT for nearly every journey we did. The trains are immaculate and very timely. The three day pass was sooooooo cheap.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Fab&speedy,cheap way to access sights..grab an ezylink card on arrival at airport&MRT pocket map&enjoy the aircon/clean trains"
,,Great system,5.0,,"Very efficient system, used it from airport and getting around. Very easy too use ticket machines, cheap, clean and safe."
,,You can navigate yourself,5.0,,Very easy and efficient service. You can navigate yourself around the entire city. Great connections. Its a shame a city like Sydney could not provide a fraction of this service!
,,Best way to get around,4.0,,Whilst on a 2 day stopover in Singapore we found this the best way to get around this interesting city. Each line is clearly labelled and the signage is easy to follow. Trains are modern and clean and very frequent during the day and late into the evening. Fares are very reasonable with an all day hop on off ticket just 10 SD.
,,Excellent Public Transport and cheap for Tourist,5.0,,"One of the great public transport i have ever used in my life, as well as impressed for the money to spend, only in 30 Sing Dollar for 3 days!! Love to use it again in life!!"
,,fabulous!,5.0,,"Easy, Clean, On time and cheap - get the ezylink card and every trip will cost only 97c-1.97. Must do."
,,Whisk away,5.0,,Having travelled on London Underground this is in a different league. Clean and friendly and SO good for disabled travellers. A lift at every station and toilets too. Fabulous - it really makes a trip to Singapore sing !
,,Preferred method to get around,4.0,,Was easy with helpful station staff. Once we understood the set up was easy and very affordable. Great
,,Beware the ticket office queue,4.0,,"SMRT is the best and most efficient underground system I have had the pleasure of using. However, if you have to queue to buy the visitor pass (which is good value if you go the 2 day option) beware - you are likely to have to queue just as long for the refund of the $10 deposit. Patience is definitely required!"
,,Good system,4.0,,"This is a good modern system.For tourists, buying tickets can be a slight drag as you need the correct cash, which the station office can provide."
,,It's fast,5.0,,I love the SMRT!! It arrived in actual schedule and i can go anywhere with it so i love to use it whenever i go to singapore
,,Cheaper way to getting around Singapore,5.0,,"If you never go you will never know how easy to use the MRT or SMRT...as an example first time when i try MRT , because of a high uber/grab fare,i looked for at Google maps to understand the line I've to use..just underground,buy tickets,ride a clean, spacious,fast one of the best metro of the world for 20 minutes and saved S$40...woh...It was amazing for me.. within almost the same time an uber or grab needed..oh...we got seat also..from that time i was a fan of the MRT in Singapore..."
,,Excellent Transport System,5.0,,"I may have commented on the MRT before but it is hard to beat this system as it moves people effortlessly in Singapore. It is cheap, signage is clear and not confusing,both stations and carriages are clean, this the model for other global cities to emulate."
,,cool and fast,5.0,,mrt in singapore is the best thing its anything happen to me and my family.so convience and very much no waiting.easy to go any corner in singapore even airport.
,,"Works like a dream, but don't forget the buses!",5.0,,"The MTR is an example of how other cities' mass transit systems should work. It's efficient, clean and well organised. I particularly loved the cleanliness of the stations and trains - no gooey food containers in corners or people eating and drinking in the stations. And I noticed younger passengers offering seats to the elderly and physically impaired. If you have time, take the trains to their termini and see how well the urban residential area is planned. You'll notice green apartment buildings with grass on the rooves and plants cascading down, and green relaxation areas in between. Amazing!"
,,"Super Clean, Easy and Fast!",5.0,,I love SMRT and all public transportation in Singapore. Very cheap and easy to understand. Good jobs Singapore!
,,One of the best transport system in the World.,5.0,,"Amazing rail system,Cheap and quick to get around Singapore. On time , clean and good service. Used to get around Singapore and did not cost much for the two weeks.once you understand the routes it’s easy to fallow and get to your destination."
,,Fantastuc,5.0,,"Best public transport I’ve ever used, so easy to navigate, so fast and so cheap. I used this every day and wouldn’t travel around Singapore any other way. Recommend getting an ez link card if going longer than 2 days"
,,Great network,5.0,,"Singapore is one of those places where you don't need a car as the transport system is so good you can have a relaxing holiday & still see almost everything. On the odd occasion you want to do something different without the train its not such a big deal then to grab a cab. We always get the pre paid swipe cards that you can top up during your stay as they offer huge discounts on all rail travel rather than buying single trip tickets. It is well patronised as it is very efficient, convenient & good value that has stood the test of time."
,,fast and clear,5.0,,"read the map, they can take you anywhere in singapore, its clean, its fast and its safe, even if you travelling with stroller or whellchair"
,,Super Quick,4.0,,"Timings were quick, smooth ride, very cheap way of getting around in Singapore, not much assistance from staff, was abit confusing for someone using for first time so to be able to locate a staff member on a platform could have helped abit, otherwise great transport option"
,,Definitely use this,5.0,,"I would recommend any body going to Singapore to definitely use the underground. It is inexpensive and the best way to get around. An easy card ticket is worth getting if you are there more than 2or 3 days as it is like an Oyster card and can be topped up and the card lasts 5 years incase you return. The visitors ticket is good if you are going to use the railways a lot in a day otherwise you do not use the amount for the day. The underground stations are another world with restaurants, snack bars, bakeries and much much more, the bigger the station the more it offers. The stations are very clean as our the trains and the lines are easy to follow."
,,world class metro,5.0,,the MRT in Singapore is undoubtedly one of the best in the world.The service is excellent and frequency of trains is very good.Cleanliness in compartments is very good.All major attractions can be covered easily by MRT.We did not use taxis at all and saw all the attractions by travelling in MRT.
,,Frequent and safe public transport,4.0,,"The MRTTrains are frequent so there is no need for timetable as the next train will arrive at the station within 15 minutes if you missed the previous train. Most trains are usually full particularly in those lines going to busy Orchard shopping area. There is however, plenty of standing room in these airconditioned trains. The entry and exit doors into and out of the the trains to the platform is secured until the trains arrived into the station. Purchasing a ticket or a a frequent user card is automated and easy to topped up."
,,Average,3.0,,"We took the SMRT only twice, it was ok, just nondescript! There wasn’t so many place to sit and stop at 11.00! Just don’t waste your time to try it and grab a Cheap GRAB!"
,,Travelling in Singapore,5.0,,Excellent service...best way to travel fro tourists....get a card issued and keep loading as per the need...signboards are excellent and very user friendly
,,Easy to use and navigate,5.0,,"Easy to use, navigate and inexpensive, we used this on our visit to Singapore to get around over longer distances. It was easy, clean and to time and the doors stopped exactly where they said they would - really clever and smart. Def give it as go."
,,Maintenance needed,3.0,,The MRT has had some breakdowns recently. However steps are being taken to improve the maintenance and reliability.
,,Wow,5.0,,"The mrt is an amazing transport system. It makes any Swiss timepiece look like a snail on a go slower mode. The stations are pristine and immaculately clean, there's cctv on every corner of the whole place. Absolutely no graffiti or sense of self expression. The mrt can be likened to Singapore itself i.e. everything's got to work anything which goes against the system is subdued. Everybody and everything must comply with the non democratic, freedom of speech suppressing Singaporean mrt system of government.
Use the mrt for your own good and never go the wrong way or you might be punished by the masters of the mrt."
,,alway reliable and offordable,5.0,,I always enjoy the public transport in Singapore given it is reliable and inexpensive. This trip we purchased a travel card which for $5 has a 5 year life. We found this to be much easier to top up and travel with rather than buying individual tickets each trip. We also found the cost of trips reduced significantly using the card.
,,Very efficient,5.0,,This is a very comprehensive system connecting with most of Singapore. The stations and trains are very clean. The timetable is very good with very little waiting time.
,,Great Way To Travel,5.0,,We took the SMRT from the airport to our downtown Hotel. The SMRT is very easy use. It is a very clean and safe way to move around. The cost was reasonable.
,,Very fast and well connected,5.0,,"Its very fast and well connected. You can reach every corner of singapore island using it. Very convenient, fast and cheap to travel in one of the most expensive cities in the world"
,,East West Line,4.0,,"Easy to get around, super easy to navigate, top notch compared to other big cities, one of the few reasonably priced things in Singapore."
,,Fast and clean,5.0,,"Very clean and efficient metro rail system. Easy to navigate and get all over the city. While they do not sell day or weeklong passes, it is economical to buy a S$12 card and refill it as many times as needed."
,,Simply the best,5.0,,The MRT would be one of the best transit systems in the world it is certainly the cleanest They run on time and make getting around SG so easy get the plastic card and just tap on & tap off.

,,Easy use,5.0,,Fantastic to use Very easy to Understand Helpful staff and information booths can get a tourist pass and return card For Deposit when leaving the city
,,Can't beat this,5.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore
Bus timetables are convoluted to those who are not locals.
The MRT lines are mapped simply and are colour coded making them easy to read.
Trains are fast with minimal waiting times, a few minutes at the most, clean, air conditioned and well maintained.
Getting anywhere in Singapore is a breeze.
Fares are inexpensive and you can save more by getting a multi trip pass which can be topped up again and lasts 3 years. So if you're intending on going back at some point it's really worthwhile.Tickets can be bought from a ticket office however the vending machines are also very easy to use, simply select your stop from an alphabetical list and pay with cash or your card. Just a word of warning - change tends to come out in some coins which will accumulate in your wallet!
All stops are covered with the MRT - those on the tourist trail as well as the outer reaches of the city."
,,Cheap and fast mode,5.0,,Cheap and fast mode of transportation with high efficiency. High standards. No eating drinking is allowed. Easily understand and you can go through anywhere right from the airport to Marina Bay or to other parts of the city
,,Best transportation,5.0,,"Ive been to other asian countries. Singapore has the best, cleanest, easiest to navigate railway system. With free wifi too."
,,"Fast, clean, reliable and easy to navigate.",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT must be one of the best in the world, if not the best.
The stations are immaculate as are the trains themselves. No litter, no graffiti, and beautifully airconditioned.
There's plenty of signage around and navigatng your way around the city is so simple."
,,This is an incredible servce that may be the best in Asia!,5.0,,"Punctual, cost-effective, electronic and making travel around Singapore an easy task. Very strict rules regarding the consumption of food and drink you may wish to be aware of to avoid significant fines. No drinking or eating on platforms of trains of a 500 SGD fine. Do so at your own risk!
The rules make the platforms and trains very clean. In fact, the whole city is clean with minimal littering and is the reason that Singapore may be oft referred to as a ""fine"" city! After traveling around Singapore for a week, I feel that their trains rival Japan! Watch for the size of the money you have as the machines will spit out denominations that are too large and may have you wondering what is going on! Take a ""zinger"" (ID tag with retracting cord) to add an extra level of convenience with the train tickets you can recharge and easily reuse. If only we had trains like this at home!"
,,Good experience,5.0,,We used MRT several times without issue. The ticket machines are easy to use. They didn’t seem to take credit cards ( at least the ones we used didn’t). The train cars are clean and station directions were clear. A very good value.
,,A Pleasure to Ride,5.0,,"In my world travels, I'd rate this among the cleanest, well maintained, and comfortable subway systems. Ride it.....you won't be disappointed. I bought a three-day pass that made things extremely easy."
,,Best way to travel around,5.0,,"A convenient and economical mode of transport and to get to know the local culture.

Many tourist attractions are inter-connected to the MRT.

Get a store value card and start getting around Singapore ..

Zip from Little India to Chinatown, Sentosa or any other destination within a day.."
,,Short Holiday,4.0,,"SMRT are clean and convenient. They have stations almost everywhere especially shopping centers, tourist spots and food courts."
,,Efficient!,5.0,,"Very efficient and easy to work out. If staying for a few days, buy a SMRT Travel Card that saves time and money that you can top up and then receive a refund on the unused funds at the end of your trip.
Carriages were always clean."
,,Buy tickets in bulk with coins if possible.,4.0,,"Clean and easy to navigate and the trains are quiet. Ticketing takes time so I suggest you buy several singles rather than one at a time. You need to buy for a specific journey not a zone so the automated machines need a member of staff to help tourists make sense. Saves you 10cents per ticket if you buy 6 at a time. You do need to have money in small denominations as the machines do not give change. It’s not expensive. We popped into a 7-11 store to exchange our high value notes before travelling.
Trains run reasonably frequently and the station exits are marked clearly."
,,Good value for money,5.0,,"Obtain a 3 day tourist pass at airport station for $30, $10 deposit returned on surrender. Very modern driverless metro ,goes everywhere. Like Singapore very clean and effective."
,,Best way to get about Singapore as a tourist,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 11 days & found the MRT the most convenient, quick & cost effective way to get around Singapore, including getting to the airport at the end of our stay.
It is so clean, air conditioned & very frequent. It can get busy at times but you always feel safe & everyone is pretty courteous.
The transit maps our easy to read & understand where to change lines etc. Everything is clearly sign-posted so you never get lost. Even if you do it's never going to be stressful, just treat it as an adventure & discover a new location of this very diverse city.
In preference to the tourist cards we bought the locally used EZ-Link card & topped it up at ATMs as needed. Any outstanding credit could be reimbursed at station ticketing booths, including the one at the airport."
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,"The trains is easy to get around, following the coloured lines & changing points. The trains is very clean and they have the lights showing each stop, that way you dont have to worry about getting lost!"
,,I wish we had a system like this in the States.,5.0,,State of the art transportation-easy to use and frequent service. Ultra clean and SAFE. I used the MRT system multiple times during my recent visit. The ride from the airport to my hotel in Chinatown was about $2. What a bargain. Get a pass card at the station and load it up.
,,Excellent Intercity Low cost commutation option.,5.0,,We used both SMRT metro train and buses extensively during our Singapore trip. It was very convenient & cost effective. We took help of maps to find right train & buses and didn’t find any issue in commuting. Would recommend tourists to explore this option instead of expensive private taxis.
,,Very efficient,4.0,,Such an efficient service and quite cheap. Easy to get around. Clean and quick - maybe easier than using Uber.
,,Effective transport system,5.0,,"My only criticism is that it is now very difficult for visitors to top up a normal travel card (EZLink card) as most top up machines no longer accept cash, and don't accept credit cards apart from one specific to the EZLink card. This means that the cards have to be topped up at a booking office which can result in considerable delays. Apart from that, the MRT is a safe, effective and fast way of getting around."
,,The best I've experienced in the world,5.0,,"While the Singaporeans love complaining about the odd delay, in terms of comfort, safety, connectivity and speed to destination SMRT beats any place in the world. In terms of schedule, I would rank it second behind only Japan."
,,A Very Impressive Undetgroind Transit System,5.0,,"Singapore's rapid transit system is very impressive, clean efficient, and safe.

It is very reasonably priced and even cheaper with the purchase of a multi use card.
It is driverless and all automatic. We didn't find it over crowded and it has a very extensive network which suited us.

You are kept informed of timings and the frequency of service is fine."
,,Incredible,5.0,,"I was amazed with MRT in Singapore. All lines some how link, so clean you’d think it was a brand new train. The people are friendly and there is reserved seating for the elderly, women and parents with a pram. The train runs on schedule and you have to be quick the doors don’t close on you!"
,,Easy & quick to get around,5.0,,"Cheap , clean, easy to get around and so on time. You will only have to wait minutes. Easy way to get around this city"
,,superb and efficient,5.0,,"we enjoy our experience and getting around by using tourist pass for 3 days. with $20, we can get unlimited ride of mrt, lrt and buses. it's really worth it. waiting time is about 2-3 minutes. very comprehensive and efficient transportation. Trains and buses are clean, spacious, good information & signage for the first timer in taking MRT. and they also offer free wifi at all mrt station which is good. but please expect to do lot of walking and taking stairs especially when there's a need to exchange MRT line."
,,Fast and crowded,4.0,,"Trains are quite frequent and pretty modern. They are usually pretty crowded. Station stops are announced prior to arrival. Cost is reasonable. If your going to ride a lot then consider a 1, 2 or 3 day pass. It's good for all public transportation and is quite reasonable."
,,Excellent system,5.0,,"My only criticism is that credit cards don’t work. You need coins and bills of 5 Spd or less. Otherwise, clear and well marked in three languages."
,,Wow.,5.0,,"Never have I travelled on such an efficient, spotless and excellent transport service. Australia rail should look at this system. No food, no graffiti and SAFE."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"The best way to travel on the island. Beware, though, that during peak times and week-ends, it can get very crowded.
Clean, cool (sometimes too cold!) and safe.
One of the best public transport system in the world I have used.
One little note for people coming to Singapore for the first time: in transfer stations, such as Dhoby Ghaut, prepare to walk a lot when changing lines."
,,Seamless travel,5.0,,What a great rapid transit system. Clean and on time every time. Station helpers are there to assist you if needed. User friendly.
,,"Fantastic Infrastructure, and very punctual",5.0,,"Learn your way around the MRT, and the whole island becomes accessible. Very clean, punctual trains - a lesson in how transport systems should work. Well done!"
,,Easy Peasy,5.0,,"Singapore's SMRT is one of the easiest transit systems we've ever used and I don't say this lightly as we've used transit systems all over the world. At major stops there are information kiosks with real live people who speak English to direct you, though tickets are bought at a machine which is also user friendly. You choose your destination and the ticket price is shown. The machine even gives change. The most delightful aspect of Singapore's SMRT are the stops themselves which often reflect the neighbourhood you are visiting. For instance, Little India, welcomes you with giant elephant sculptures. You're immediately immersed in the area. Though busy and few seats on the trains young people will often get up and give their seats to the elderly or women with children. The seats are color coded and some are reserved for handicapped people."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"As an international traveller, we found the service very easy to navigate your way through. Trains run very frequent so they were not overcrowded. When you are required to change lines, some required a bit of a work but all are well signed."
,,"Easy, cheap, safe and convenient mode of travelling",5.0,,"1. Travelled mostly with the mrt during my short trip in Singapore.
2. Used the Nets card, which worked out slightly cheaper than normal fares.
3. The service is available from changi terminal 2. You can use free shuttle bus service from terminal 4 to T2.
4. Mrt fare charges are relatively cheaper compared to taxi.
5. Felt very safe travelling alone. The stations and rail cars are very clean at all times.
6. Route directions are clear and easy to follow."
,,Nice,5.0,,It was ny firts time to use the public trabsportation in singapore. MRT. Very fast and i enjoy the trip
,,Happy kids... just be careful on escalators,4.0,,"Happy kids... fun experience... but be careful as the escalators run quite fast.. it seemed that the deeper you go in the station, the faster it is :)"
,,Convenient Commuting,5.0,,"The MRT as they call it, is a highly convenient fast and cheaper mode of transport connecting to whole of island. The stations are all quite modern with ease of travel even for elderly and wheel chair bound traveler. Enough space inside the coach with specially marked seating places for elderly people and pregnant mom's. Eatables are not allowed inside the coach which people follow in true spirit. Proper announcement of approaching station in english and lights indicating the platform location to exit. It also has route map of specific line together with total route map of MRT."
,,Best Way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"We bought a 3-day tickets for S$30 each and after 3 days use, we retuned the tickets to get a S$10 deposit back. So the price was very reasonable and convenient for city traveling. The train stations were clean, safe, and the trains were always on time."
,,efficient and fast,5.0,,Relatively cheap and extremely efficient system. The tourist pass is a good deal only if several trips are done in 1-3 days. Getting a card with the nonrefundable deposit might be a better deal. It is strange that the pass can be bought only at certain stations. I hope that SMRT will wise up and the pass will be sold at every station.
,,Amazing transport system,5.0,,If you are in Singapore forget taking the taxi..enjoy convenient and cheap transport all over singapore. So simple easy to understand. Just not advisable if you are travelling with old people as the walks can get quite long.
,,Cheap and easy to use,5.0,,"Easy to use, from ticket machines, to helpful staff to easy to read maps. Fast and efficient trains."
,,Such an efficient way to get around,5.0,,We definitely got our money's worth from our 3 day Singapore Tourist Pass! Cost was S$20 plus a S$10 refundable deposit.
,,Good Ride if there is no fault / maintenance,4.0,,Provided the train is not faulty. Else the ride with SMRT should be fun. It brings you to many places in Singapore.
,,well maintained place,4.0,,Only issue about SMRT is it’s not well connected to jurong bird park and singapore zoo.Other than that u have to use this system cos it’s cheaper and fast.But i recommend during ur stay u have to try road transport also as it will help u better understanding about roads and i can see places around while it’s not possible in SMRT. so do spend some mny for buses and taxis. Almost most metro stations are connected to shopping malls. so do gonto shopping after exiting frm metro.
,,Unbeatable!,5.0,,"Singapore is the template for how a well run public transport system should be- efficient, good value and clean"
,,MRT in Singapore,5.0,,"Very affordable, reliable and clean. It is easy to work out where to go and staff quickly offer assistance when you are buying tickets or deciding on the best route to take if you’re not sure."
,,"Clean, fast, efficient",5.0,,"An excellent metro system. Over the past 2 years, they have added several new lines that provide even more direct service to many parts of town. The fares are inexpensive, less than S$2 for one way travel to most locations around town. The facilities are very clean, well lighted, and the trains are clean and comfortable. Folks actually line up where indicated to make embarkation and debarkation fast and efficient. They actually have clean restrooms in several of the stations, and during peak hours, staff are stationed at the ticket machines to help tourists with their ticketing, including providing change. A totally unexpected and satisfying metro experience."
,,"Easy, clean and usually efficient",4.0,,"I take the train MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) often. I prefer to travel by train or bus because there’s no discussion about what route to take, no hidden costs, and the fare is about one tenth of the price of a taxi. Train stops are well marked and wait time is generally very good. However, there have been breakdowns lately and trains are very busy during rush hour . Tourists should avoid traveling by train during rush hour (8-9 a.m./5-6:30 pm) if possible."
,,User-friendly and cheap!,5.0,,Don't be afraid to use the MRT to get around Singapore. It is fast and economical. There is a lot of signage and people who will help you navigate and purchase your tickets.
,,Best transport system in the world,5.0,,"Having moved and loved overseas, it is always a treat to return to Singapore. The MRT makes travelling around Singapore so easy and economical. Most of the station are disabled friendly and their staff are helpful. Approach them when you think you are displaced and they will lead you to the right line."
,,World class transport system - get the tourist pass,5.0,,"Have been to Singapore many times , first time in 1981 watched the MRT being developed in the 90s into what it is now a world class transport system.

We get the three day tourist pass which includes some buses as well as the MRT. Costs $30 for 3 days but you get $10 back when you return the card so $20 for travel on MRT and buses for 3 days seems pretty good to me.

An example of using the MRT and buses is going to the Zoo the pass covers both modes of transport.

Taxis are cheap and there are plentiful we did use them but MRT is the way to go for most travel."
,,convenient and quickest way to travel around,5.0,,"The train system is great and conveniently located is the underground and easy to use and get to attractions, you can buy a travel card top up to use for some days of the traveling, you can save rather than having to bye a single train ticket. if not sure about journey or travel card how much to top up you can ask the customer service people available at every station which are extremely helpful and told me around how much i would need for the amount of days i was staying and i purchased the card and had the top up done with them. it was enough. plus the card is valid for 5 years from purchase date."
,,Cleanest mrt ever,5.0,,This is the cleanest mrt i have ever seen. Very convenient. On time. Can take you anywhere you want in the city in no time. Can be crowded during peak hours (morning and end of afternoon weekdays).
,,Transport at ease,5.0,,"The well connected Singapore public transport connects the city well and all the worker, office goer travel primarily by this smart rapid transport system. Singapore metro is one of the best connected and services are very smooth very frequent. This is the life blood for commuting in Singapore. I am very pleased to travel in the metro and also witnessed the disciplined approach of Travellers during boarding and alighting from the coaches. The ticket dispensing machines are also pretty accurate and add to the ease. The safety of the passengers are also taken care off Very well to avoid any hazards. The ride is a great experience..."
,,The best way to get around...,5.0,,Easy to navigate and very cheap way of travel. There are also officers stationed to help and are most friendly. we paid +-R1000 for Airport to Hotel MI through private transfer however approx R100 for our return via the MRT. and has free WIFI

,,Singapore MRT can't be topped,5.0,,"When ever we are in Singapore we use the MRT in 95 % of transport. It's easy, cheap, clean and fast. From Airport to the city, fore siteseeing in Sentosa or Gardens by the Bay!"
,,SO EASY,5.0,,"The MRT beats any undergroud sytem including london and new york, trains are not noisy and clean and the stations are so well signposted"
,,Travel for business and leisure,5.0,,All the train stations are well connected. Major business districts and shopping malls are linked to the stations. Clear and easy to read signages. There are always staff around to answer all your queries. Safe and clean trains.
,,Brillant,5.0,,"MRT is the easiest way to travel around singapore.
We got a 3 day tourist pass which cost $20 with a $10 returnable deposit, this gives you unlimited travel on all MRT trains and also standard buses, it saves you quite a bit of money buying single use tickets and saves you time queing to buy them, the ques get very long at rush hour.
The system is so easy to use we didnt get lost once, the stations and trains are so clean and always rang to time."
,,Singapore public transport,5.0,,"Singapore public transport includes MRT (train),bus.both are convenient.there is an App to find out bus route and arriving time. You can download for free.The app is Nestie. MRT waiting time is about 3 minutes in peak hour and 5 ~7 minutes in off peak hour. It is the most convenient transport around the country. Ticket is sold on machine located in all stations. If you take connection from MRT to bus, there is a big discount , like few cents,but it is not applicable for single card.there is tourist card, you have to check on line for more detail."
,,"Very good, but sometimes quicker to walk....",4.0,,"It is a very good system, but the layout of Singapore and its small size, for most tourists you are probably better off walking, It takes time get down and up again and find your right exit to the street you want.........On one occasion we got the wrong exit and after two minutes walking in the wrong direction we were back at our hotel. So just use it for the longer rides and keeping out of the rain."
,,Day on SMRT,3.0,,Very crowded & can be quite unreliable during peak period. Good & reliable only during non peak period.
,,Excellent Transport System,5.0,,"The benefit of the MRT system is that you can travel both on the underground trains and buses with the same ticket. The ticket kiosks are easy to navigate and use. Just remember to buy a ticket for longer stays at larger stations. The system works the same as in Sweden, where the end destination is indicate on the maps and information displays. Very easy to use, efficient, on-time and very clean and safe.
Singapore has an excellent police force, and relatively crime free. We traveled late at night and did not feel uneasy at all. We used the MRT for 2 weeks - the entire duration of our stay. You can buy a temporary ticket for your first ride. All kiosks accept credit cards."
,,"Clean, safe, efficient, automated, easy to use",5.0,,"Good way to get around. There is staff to help you , especially important for your first time purchasing tickets . The people who helped us spoke English"
,,great subway that covers the city efficiently,5.0,,You can get pretty much anywhere on the subway. It is easy to use and easy to navigate. Not a lot of seating but fast and efficient.
,,efficient system,5.0,,"You can easily get to anywhere in the city by MRT. I had never seen other subway system like this, clean, efficient and punctual."
,,Singapore public transport,5.0,,"The MRT and bus service in Singapore are one of the best public transportation systems in the world. An extremely clean, reliable, punctual, reasonably priced, and easy-to-use infrastructure makes it possible to go everywhere including airport transfers using public transport."
,,Convienient mode of transportation,3.0,,"SMRT Trains are convenient and are able to bring you anywhere in Singapore. Most of the MRT stations in Singapore are linked to residential areas or shopping areas or a combination of both. Some stations have shops within the station premises as well, an example would be at Bugis MRT. There are of course some controversial issues surrounding the train system in Singapore though, such as the constant breakdowns that happen every so often or the fact that the trains will be packed like sardines once peak hour hits. All in all, travel safe and enjoy the ride!"
,,The best way to travel,5.0,,"It has good connectivity, it is clean and fast means of travel, specially if you are alone or two pleple."
,,"Modern, Clean and Efficient",5.0,,"The Singapore ""MRT"" system has the advantage of being built relatively recently. A bit unfair to compare to places like London which has just reached 150 years old !

That said, it meets what you would expect of a modern transit system. The trains are big. Stations are long. So one can normally squeeze in ( except for some stations in peak hours ). In fact to promote off peak travel the government subsidises some travel routes if you complete your journey before 645am (check).

Not all of Singapore is accesible by MRT although there has been a huge investment in additional lines, trains and stations in recent years. Not great if you are a driver due to construction sites.

Some useful info for visitors on a budget is that the MRT goes all the way to the airport. Would probably take about 40-45 minutes from the city centre.

My final ""like"" about the MRT is that, with the exception an issue, the trains pretty much come every 5 minutes and delivery to your destination is pretty much guaranteed. For long distances they are better than buses but buses have a more extensive reach than the trains.

Oh almost forgot. Very good access. Lifts to station platforms. No high step onto the train. So good for the elderly and those pushing strollers."
,,SMRT,4.0,,The easier way to get around SIngapore. Dropoff at different stops and try out the different local food
,,Used to be good,3.0,,"If you have been following the news, there had been a lot of disruptions and delays in our previously trusted transport system. What you heard on the news were the major events. If you used the service frequently you would have experienced events that did not appear on the news. The other day I was changing line from circle line to east west line at Buona Vista MRT. It was a rainy day and there were delays in the trains and the platform was jam packed with people and each train that came in was almost full so only a few passengers could squeeze in. I only managed to board the fifth train after being squeezed for a long time on the platform."
,,Exceptional,5.0,,Well the mrv is easy to use and the staff very helpful if you get stuck. Stations and trains are very clean and safe. Trains are driverless fast and frequent. Glass doors on platforms make the whole system safe. Prices are very cheap and if you reuse your return ticket you get a daily discount up to five times
,,"Quick, cheap and super efficient",4.0,,"Very easy to travel around Singapore via the MRT. You purchase and pre-load a plastic card that you tap to enter and exit the MRT. We found it much cheaper to actually just purchase the EZ link card (you pay and get a deposit back) rather than purchasing the tourist travel card. Trains are every few minutes, you barely have to wait between trains. The only downside is you're not allowed to eat on the trains/platforms which can be a bit hard when you've got a busy day with the kids and they want snacks."
,,Best way for a traveller to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, safe, fast, good value for money. Stations located within a reasonable walking distance from most major sites."
,,Fast efficient convenient safe,5.0,,Singapore is well known for her law and order. Their transport network is fast and efficient. Able to bring us from one location to another with quickly and at affordable prices 😊👍
,,Easy to take but buying tickets is a process,4.0,,So Singapore is quite small and it is really easy to move around the city with the SMRT (subway). You can get unlimited passes for 24 to 48 hours however we didn’t do it because we didn’t think we would travel around as much. So he had bought single use tickets every time we traveled. You save 10 cents if you continue to use your pass and refill it however the lines for buying tickets can get really long especially if you are at MBS or near Sentosa Island.
,,Should serve as an example to many cities,5.0,,"Excellent, clean, efficient, frequent service, people have the (organised) discipline to let passengers off before boarding trains - overall excellent!"
,,best and cheapest mean of transport around the city!,5.0,,"being deprived of quality transportation systems in my country, finding a clean well organised and efficient mean of transport add more JOY to my vacation. their underground is even cleaner and organised than germany. very easy to use. singaporeans themselves are helpful and will try to help u. moreover there are elderly staff everywhere to aid u if needed be sure to buy a SINGAPORE TOURIST PASS which gives u unlimited rides (purchased from main stops like orchard road or china town or even changing airport) n enjoy hopping around the city! NOTE: u get refunded 10 sgd when u return the pass."
,,SMRT,5.0,,Amazing and smooth running transport system. Well signposted and very helpful staff. Good variety food shops.
,,Amazingly Efficient!,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 10 days on holidays as a family of 4 in mid January 2018. We used the rail and bus system for the entire stay, electing not to use taxi's or the Hop On Hop Off system to any great extent. Singapore's public transport system is light years ahead of Australia's in every sense. CHEAP ($20 for unlimited use for 3 days). CLEAN (did not spot 1 piece of rubbish the entire stay). PUNCTUAL (trains depart on most routes every few minutes) EASY (even the most disoriented person can navigate their transport systems with little confusion. EXTENSIVE NETWORK ( we visited all 3 Zoos, Bird Park, Clarke Quay, Marina Bay Sands, Sentosa, Little China and India, Gardens By The Bay and the numerous shopping Malls).
If your a 1st time visitor and your in Singapore for a few days + then purchase a Hop On Hop Off pass for 24hrs to orientate yourself and listen to a bit of history as you travel to the various tourist areas, then go to 1 of the MRT stations that sell the Tourist Pass. It costs $10 for 1 day, $16 2 days or $20 3 days with a $10 refundable deposit on return of the card after expiry.
Just too Easy."
,,Great transportation system....,5.0,,".....best organized, unmatched value by any means. True example how a public transport system should work. Please operators from EU get there in touch and learn how to offer a great functioning and valuable system!"
,,Only way to go,5.0,,We regularly visit Singapore & we always use the MRT: Clean : Comfortable: Value for money : It is the best way to travel around.
,,Why haven't we got this transport system?????,5.0,,"OMG, how easy is it to get around Singapore. The train system along with the bus (EzyLink) is amazing. So easy to understand where you need to go or are going...super clean....super efficient.....and inexpensive. We bought our EziLink card the first day in Singapore and used it to get around in general as well as go to the races, to the zoo and to the Tiger beer factory tour."
,,Fast and Furious,5.0,,Unlike the movie Fast and Furioud thou but it is convenient with all user-friendly facilities for even the Disabled.....Handicapped..can easily travel on their own....you won't get lost!
,,Fantastic system,5.0,,"What a great and easy way to get around Singapore. Very easy to use and always helpful staff or people to help you use the system.
Trains and stations are amazing. Could teach Australia what a great system it is. Never had to wait more than 4 mins for a train."
,,Very efficient means of transport,5.0,,This is a very convenient and efficient means of transportation. The journey is very smooth and its very safe
,,The Best,5.0,,"Definitely the top ranked subway system I have ever used. Clean, well marked in both English and Chinese, and very cheap. We got the three day tourist card for $30, which comes with unlimited rides. A bargain and a great way to explore Singapore with their extensive network."
,,Singapore MRT.,5.0,,"The three major lines comprise the Singapore MRT, which cover all the city. The underground trains are efficient and run to time. One word of warning! All tickets have to be purchased from the ticket machines, and they will only take small $2 bills. Equip yourself with enough, or coins."
,,"Reliable, comfortable, and cheap public transportation",4.0,,Best way to travel around the city. A trip will cost around $1-2 SGD and will get you nearly anywhere in the city
,,Could not be better,5.0,,"Could not be better - easy, quick.

Some hints -
* A tourist pass is promoted the cheapest you get works out to S$10 per day. We did a lot of travel and could not work out how you could spend $10 in a day.
* over 9 days we had a normal / Ez-link card and Spent $33 (on travel exudes the $5? purchase fee) or an average of $3.60 per day (the card is for MRT, Buses and some other items like the Zoo Bus and the Sentosa Train)
* work out where you need to get to and check the transfers at the station network maps
* Most things to visit will note the nearest MRT and also the Exit to use the Exits are A B C D etc. Knowing the exit to take will make things easier.
* we had one experience where I got on but my partner was a bit slow and the doors closed, we had agreed that it that occurred the person on the train wold get off at the next station and the person that missed the train use the same door - there are all numbered.

Very affordable and great system."
,,One of the best in the world...,5.0,,Very comfortable and easily understandable system even for the first timer in Singapore.. most of the stations open in Malls and make it very different from metros in other countries.
,,Efficient and cheap,5.0,,This service is easy to navigate and understand. It is a cheap service and gets you to a large number of locations and connects to other public transport.
,,Readily Accessible,4.0,,"If you need to get around Singapore, the mass rapid transit is an easy option. It is a very economical option and is very easy to navigate. Safe, secure, clean and easy to use."
,,Does not get better than this system,5.0,,"Cheap, clean, efficient and a regular service along with stations linked to all parts of the city. What more could a train traveller ask for."
,,Fast Efficient,5.0,,The underground rail system is fast and efficient and represents good value. There are stops at every major residential and retail district in Singapore.
,,Excellently connected to all places where you would want to go !!,5.0,,the 3 tourist pass is the go for while in Singapore allows you take unlimited rides of SMRT buses and trains
,,fast/efficient,5.0,,"Very clean, fast, efficient MRT for reasonable prices. The information booth is very helpful for people who have not used the system before."
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"So much better than other city metro systems around the world. Cheap, efficient, clean and safe, with helpful staff for the unsure traveller. The whole experience catches the essence of Singapore, a modern and efficient place that makes you wish things were like this ""back home"". The SMRT opens up virtually all of the island and has lots of subtle differences to make travelling a joy."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"We started our visit to Singapore with a trip on one of the hop on hop off buses to get our bearings and then spent the next 5 days going everywhere - day and night - on the MRT. It is excellent value for money, safe, reliable and the signage & information on the MRT and at each station is phenomenal! You could not possibly get lost. The Singapore rail system puts others to shame!!"
,,So good,4.0,,"Clean, fast and modern. Love the service provided inside the train. You can checked which exit you want to go to before you get off the train. Took an hour long journey from Woodlands to Harbour front for less than SIN $2."
,,The very best way to get around,5.0,,"Easy to navigate. Spotlessly clean. Frequent and regular service. Well signposted in English. Spoil yourself and get a tourist pass for $ 20 for 3days. Take the worry out of how much $ or having to line up for tickets at busy times. Just swipe your way through the gates and get onboard. My only complaint is that the pass goes from the midnight before we first use our pass so we only get 2.5 days use out of a 3 day pass.
All staff on the stations were very helpful when needed."
,,Great transport system,5.0,,"Impressed with the vacating of a seat for seniors by everyone , without exception and ready assistance with destination information."
,,"Clean, quiet and cheap",5.0,,A great way to travel around Singapore. Extremely clean compared to other similar methods of transport around the World.
,,A cheap and efficient system,5.0,,You can travel widely in Singapore for very little on this modern and very efficient underground system
,,"SMRT is modern, clean, great and a lifesaver",5.0,,We took our airport hotel shuttle to Bugis Street. It is about 12 miles away. The driver didn't have any details about a pickup for the return. We couldn't use Uber because we didn't have wifi. We went to the Bugis Street train station. The electronic ticket machine was not easy to understand and we didn't have change. Amazingly the station attendant didn't have change either. Finally we got tickets using my credit card. The train gave us a great view of this huge modern city. We took the train back to the airport near our hotel and hopped on the hotel's shuggle. We did have to wait nearly an hour though.
,,Fastest and Comfortable travelling mode,5.0,,"Lifeline of Singapore, the best part it's not overcrowded and reach to almost all the major tourist points in Singapore.
There is an expansion going on.
The ticket prices doesn't burn your pockets.
For tourists there is a one/two/three day pass depending on your travelling and stay. The maximum is 30 Singapore dollars for 3 days out of which 10 dollars is refundable. Unlimited times travel.
Cons.... It is available on few MRT stations and on a selected time and after it's expiry you are given two more days to return it.
Ez link card is a general card for daily commuter for 15 dollars out of which 5 dollars are fixed cost of a card and are non refundable, rest amount you could use for travelling or if left could be refunded.
Pros...... Easily available and could be charged on all the stations, the charges are very low.
Could be used in buses too that's the bonus looking for reasonable travel within Singapore."
,,Great success getting around,5.0,,"Every line is coloured, and named .This was the easiest way to get around and cheap. We got a visitor pass. You could use it on the buses also. Example we paid 20$ for three days, they take a deposit of 10$ but you get that back. The best thing is you can travel anywhere and any direction in the city,
Singapore People are so helpful, just ask don't be scared"
,,Efficient - Cheap,5.0,,Very reliable and frequent. For a few dollars you can get around the city. Easy to use and clean. Probably not great for long trips
,,Fast and comfortable,5.0,,We often take this train to go any places in Singapore.It is very smart and comfortsble.This is the smartest train system on the world.Singapore is famous because partly of this train system.
,,A reliable and cheap form of transport,5.0,,If you buy a tourist pass for the MRT you can travel all day for very little money. The system will take you basically everywhere and is so clean and air conditioned also. Some of the trains are driverless and it is great to look out the front as you travel. If you are older (like us) you will find other travellers giving up their seats for you. So friendly.
,,2 day pass should have purchased 3 day,3.0,,"We bought the 2 day pass on Monday at noon. Were told at time of purchase that pass was good for 24 hours from time of activation. So, thought it would be good on Weds morning at 6am.
Pass was not valid on Weds morning as it is a daily pass not a 24 hour pass. So, had to pay for the cab back to the airport on Weds morn.
Clean easy to use metro system, but bad advice from the downtown office that sold us our daily (not 24 hour) pass."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,There are many countries that could learn from SMRT on how to operate a metro system. It can be packed at times and I would avoid the rush hours. There are also certain stops which can be confusing regarding finding the correct exit. Buy the top-up card.
,,Very Clean and Frequent,5.0,,"Buy the tourist pass when you arrive. It is not available at all stations. We got our from Farrer Park station but I think it is available from Bugis as well. That is the best way to travel on the public transport otherwise you are paying a fare each time you travel
$20 plus $10 deposit (refunded at the airport) for a three day pass"
,,great service,5.0,,"Very good service..clean, beautiful look, very economy to all type of people's.nice experience.tourists must use this transport to know about this good service."
,,Excellent transportation system,5.0,,"Excellent, great value for money, easy to understand routing system, exceptionally clean station's and train's, reliable. Need I say more."
,,Useful cheap transport,4.0,,"Great, clean but crowded in the rush hours . Fast cheap transport to reach all most everywhere. Most of attractions and shopping centres can be reached by SMRT.
If you are staying more than 3 days it’s better to purchase the Ez-link card and top it up by the machine or at the counter. If you want 7 11 can top it up but will charge you 50 cent extra."
,,Life line of Singapore ..,5.0,,In Singapore you do not need cabs which are quite costly .. Just use the MRT .. The subs are connected to almost every nook and corner of the city including all the tourists spots .. Well maintained .. Neat n Clean and the costs are reasonable too ..
,,Worth using cheap and easy to navigate!,4.0,,"We stayed for 2 weeks and used it for almost all our travel. We bought ezilink cards which is what the locals have and topped it up as we needed to. This is the cheapest, cleanest, easiest and most efficient way to move around Singapore."
,,Best way to travel around in SIngapore,5.0,,Singapore is very well connected with MRT network. A new MRT station is constructed every 2 months in Singapore. Getting an SMRT Tourist pass for travellers is very recommended and best option available according to me. You can save on a lot of money as well as time since you won't standing and waiting in queue for getting tickets.
,,Very clean and reliable,5.0,,"We owe a lot for this service, for the very good timetable and cleanliness, while we explore the city and surrounding area."
,,Among the best,5.0,,"I have experienced some mass transport system at some countries, Singapore is among the best but there will always be room for improvement"
,,One of the best,5.0,,"This is an excellent, punctual, clean and efficient system with good clear announcements and signs in several languages. It is also inexpensive, hence the fact that pollution in Singapore is low compared to most cities (and far less than most Asian cities), because few people use cars. MRT card makes things super easy and the majority of stations and walkways are air conditioned to deal with Singapore's heat / humidity. Well done Singapore!"
,,Great cheap way to get around,5.0,,The clean effective way to get around Singapore Cheap fares and superb trains always on time There are a number of lines reaching all parts of the region
,,World class public transport.,5.0,,"The hotel we stayed in was so close to a MRT station that we didn't even have to go out in the rain as there are covered walkways. Everywhere is accessible by train and bus. We chose not to buy a rechargeable ticket as there was a non refundable deposit of $5 so, instead, we used a single use ticket. However, this name was confusing since you can top it up at the machine up to a maximum of 3 return journeys before it expires. The machines take cash only, coins and $2 or $5 notes. Although this is a more expensive way of buying your rides the most we paid was $3.60 for a return journey.
As others have pointed out, the trains are spotlessly clean (no eating, drinking or smoking allowed), frequent and reliable. The system must be the envy of the world."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Absolutely fantastic, easy to use, cheap, clean and very efficient. We were able to see so much of Singapore in one day with a day pass. Well done Singapore, more cities should follow your example of a great transport network, safe, clean, cheap, wonderful."
,,Perfect way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"Best way to travel around Singapore, air conditioned efficient transport. Buy a tourist pass this makes it easy to get trains anywhere."
,,Best way to get around town,4.0,,"The train is the best way to get around town! Cheap, clean and reliable!! Only downside is that it stops working at 12 midnight and resumes at 6 or 7 am."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"Used MRT to get to football friendly at the national stadium. Absolutely seamless. Ticketing was simple, MRT maps and guides everywhere, cheap and efficient."
,,Really clean and efficient,5.0,,"By far, the best way to go around the city, amazingly clean. Much better service than our Montreal public transportation."
,,MRT is great,5.0,,"Super fast, service every 2-4mins. Communication onboard is excellent. Very difficult to get lost here"
,,Perfect,5.0,,"Always on time,easy, simple, clean and secure. It covers most of the city. You can top up your paper ticket six times at any station before needing to get another fresh one. Perfect."
,,The best way to see Singapore,5.0,,"This MRT has to be the envy of the world. So clean, spacious and efficient with frequent services and shopping malls underground. This has to be the cheapest and quickest way to get around the city and wider island. $26 per day and you get $10 refund if you return your expired ticket within 5 days. How good is that??"
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"I love using MRT in Singapore. Always on time, never a delay and there are new lines coming in in the next years. Perfect!"
,,A traveller’s gift,5.0,,"Any decent public transport system is a traveller’s gift. Singapore’s mass transport system is clean, quiet, easy to decipher, inexpensive, airconditioned, and takes you within walking reach of pretty much anywhere you might want to go. Don’t hesitate - get on board"
,,"Fast, Quick and Easy",5.0,,"Any person can access these with machine operated vendors and easy access. The machine will give out change for the balance, so no worries."
,,The most efficient way to get around and from the airport,5.0,,Travellers do not use the MRT enough. Considering the traffic to and from the airport the total travel time is not so different but for a fraction of the cost and also predictable if you need to be at the airport on time. If you are there for a few days get the 3 day pass it's well worth it and great value.
,,Very convenient!,5.0,,Always on time and never crowded even if it is rush hour. It is quite a walk though if you need to transfer lines. Better check your final destination because some lines are confusing (esp yellow line!)!
,,"Easy, cheap, simple.",5.0,,"By far best way to get around Singapore. Cheaper than taxis and Uber/Grab, everything from the stations to the trains and nice and clean, and it covers most of the city. Would definitely recommend."
,,One of the best transport systems in the world!,5.0,,"I have visited Singapore a few times over last 2 years. The SMRT is the lifeline of Singapore. It is very easy to use, very reasonably priced and the connectivity and frequency are amazing. You don’t have to watch for timetable as there is always a train every few minutes. Just goto the platform and wait. Paying fair with the MRT cards is simple. You can buy a card st any MRT station and add money to it via various automated machines.

Many shopping and dining facilities are also available in and around the stations. The maze of tunnels underground is just amazing. Makes you wonder why US can’t do this. Just an excellent system!"
,,Well Connectec for Easibiltiy,4.0,,"Being a small country , this infrastructure has make travelling for tourist easy without ever need to rely on taxis for any part of the country. It connect to almost all tourist places with short walk ."
,,Excellent and On Time!,5.0,,Very easy to get around on the system. There is some walking on station changes. Be sure to respect local customs when traveling on the trains if from the US. Very inexpensive. You almost don't need to purchase the tourist pass. If you travel only 2-3 times a day paying by use may be best!
,,Easy and cheap way to explore Singapore,5.0,,Get a MRT card an top it with money. Easy and cheap way to travel in Singapore. Very clean and secure.
,,Easy and inexpensive,5.0,,"Stayed at Marriott Tang Plaza and Orchard stop was right at hotel, so I used the metro often. It is easy to navigate and gets one to, or at least close to, most of the tourist spots."
,,Great service,4.0,,This is a great and economical way to get around Singapore. For $4 per person you can get from the airport to Marina Bay Gardens. Brilliant service. Clean. On time.
,,Love the MRT,5.0,,"Free of graffiti & rubbish, orderly, reliable, cheap, and extremely regular this is the #1 option for my family to travel. I couldn't find this to be any easier...ticketing etc. I did not bother with a tourist card, just bought standard tickets and paid as I went. The actual ticket can be re-used up to six trips...you just add the fare each time you use it. It cost $2.50 from Changi Airport to Fort Canning.

Also, I recommend the very front of the train, as there is no driver but just a large front window to view your travels through the tunnels. It is like being on a roller coaster ride."
,,Very cheap and easy,5.0,,Used the MRT a few times on two trips to Singapore. The instructions for use are clear on the ticket machines and everything was clean. Trains always on time.
,,Spanning the Entire City - State,5.0,,"I didn't know, Changi Airport Subway Stop has been rated 10 out of 15 most beautiful Subway Stops in the World. WOW it sure is nice. The entire MRT is elevated or Underground. Mobile phone is available in every part of the network. Underground Stations and Trains themselves are air-conditioned. The carriages VERY CLEAN and the ride comfortable. Most of the line are open throughout the night. The Trains arrive at the stations in frequent intervals as such, no long waits. Fares very reasonable. Ticketing is a breeze with Ticket KIOSK, and a Customer Service Booth in every station to assist travelers. A quick, great, safe way to travel while in Singapore."
,,Clean and frequent service,5.0,,"Similar to DC, buy a card for $5 and add value to it. Most trips we took were $0.75-1.30, so very economical.. Buses are.included and are $1.40. Any unused value can be refunded at the airport station (or others) prior to leaving the city. Trains run about every 5 min. Buses about every 15. Easy access to/from airport nd cruise terminal."
,,"Fantastic service, a godsend to get around wth no stress",5.0,,"Very efficient, clean and organised service. Tourist card available and cost of card is refunded at some stations including the airport one. Loved it!"
,,Awesome!,5.0,,Clean and fast! Singapore's subway system is probably the best way to get around the city cheap. The train itself is big enough and doesn't feel cramped up (not sure on rush hours though). Since Singapore in general is a very clean place it's no surprise the subway is too.
,,Great method of transport,5.0,,Buy a ticket and then top it up like a UK Oyster card. Very efficient and prompt service. Loved the cartoon hashtags#!
,,Congratulations Singapore on your public transport!!!,5.0,,Fantastic! Efficient! Reliable! Priced so that everyone can access getting around. Was so impressed with how easily you can get around to any part of Singapore using the MRT/LRT or bus. The MRT especially is impressive. It only cost me S$1.88 to get from Changi Airport to our accomodation nearly 15kms away. Just blew me away!
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,4.0,,"I am incredibly impressed by their system. It is fairly comprehensive, covers most of Singapore, the frequency of trains is exceptional and it not expensive. In fact, it is the cheapest and fastest way to travel around Singapore. I bought the EasyLink card and topped it up as and when I needed to. You can also buy a card with unlimited travel for 1, 2 or 3 days but this works out far more expensive. There are signs everywhere in case you don't wish to download the app they have. All officials are very polite helpful and guide one a lot. I do wish they would have more workers on platforms at more touristy places[Raffles Place for eg] to help us with directions.

I was at Marina Bay with 200, 000 other people on the 31st. After bringing in the NY we all trooped to the underground. Seeing the large mass of people jam packed, and remembering what the hotel concierge , and SMRT officials had told me, i thought i would have to wait fro more than an hour at the platform to get a train. But even with the massive crowds, I got onto the 2nd train which wasn't overly crowded. it took the longest time to reach the platform while walking through the mall because they had barricaded a lot of passages for crowd control i guess but there were security personnel and other officials reminding everyone to keep calm and not push. I've been on trains in India and London and boy, those are something!

You can use the MRT to and from the airport which is much cheaper and very convenient too."
,,A great system,4.0,,We used to live here and always used the MRT. A great system if you can handle the lack of manners with entering and exiting.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Fastest way to get around and as cheap ad chips. Busses everywhere and very regular. Goes everywhere and comfortable.
,,Convenient,5.0,,"Ride in confidence as this system is exceedingly clean, safe, and very convenient--easy to use as well."
,,Most convenient Way to travel in Singapore,4.0,,"It is very cheap compared to taxis. So I would say try your best to select MRT as much as possible. If you are a traveler, they have a smart card for visitors for like 10 Dollars per day. Since Singapore is a small country it is possible to go most of the popular places by MRT."
,,Excellent system and extremely good value for tourists! Easy to navigate and always people there to help you.,5.0,,Travelled all over the city any time of day or night and always felt safe and secure. People to help you buy tickets and often to help you plan the most efficient route. Buses run absolutely on schedule! To the minute!
,,Awesome,5.0,,Great way to get around the city as well as a very inexpensive way to see Singapore. We rode the MRT around simply to see different areas of Singaore.
,,Easy way to get around,5.0,,We were in Singapore for 3 days and used a mixture of taxis and the MRT system. My preference for anyone with no mobility issues is the MRT hands down. Fast easy to use and very cheap.
,,"cheap, fast and convenient",5.0,,"It is one of the best mass rapid transit systems in the world and it delivers fast, reliable and cheap service, what more can you ask for?"
,,An easy and cheap way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"Aside from my first shuttle ride from the airport to the hotel, I did all of my travelling in Singapore via the MRT and it couldn't have been easier or more convenient. All routes were well marked and easy to understand, announcements in the stations and on the trains were clear and concise and, best of all, it was inexpensive.

The trains can be busy and you'll more than likely have to stand if you're riding during busy hours but it still felt safe."
,,Easy to navigate and cheap form of transport,5.0,,"As we stayed close to a MRT station we used this to get around the city and go to various tourist attractions. Tourists can purchase a card to use for 1 to 3 days the latter only costing $S10 which enables unlimited travel. It is a clean, efficient mode of transport with locals giving up a seat for the elderly. We waited a maximum of 5 minutes but mostly only a couple of minutes for a train."
,,"Great, clean and efficient",5.0,,"Works well, got a 1 day tourist pass from the airport. Quick and efficient ... would always use as a way to get around"
,,Good and easy to use for tourism,5.0,,"I come here too many times and use MRT , cheap prices and faster than bus when you need to go someplace I love singapore"
,,"Clean, cheap, easy",5.0,,"Compared to the Tube in London, the MRT is just as easy to navigate and three times cleaner. You can recharge your paper ticket six times at any station before needing to get another fresh one. Ticket machines are easy to use, although they generally don’t give out more that $4 in change, so you will need a selection of smaller notes and coins to top up for individual journeys. The only way to get lost is to not read any of the signs."
,,Fast,5.0,,Best way to travel in Singapore. Cheap and quick. No big queues were there and trains come in like every 10 minutes. Not a big deal if one got missed.
,,Convenient,3.0,,It is very convenient for hang around especially taxi system is not working well in Singapore. However the train is also busy all the time. Be prepared.
,,FANTASTIC,5.0,,What a fantastic and easy to use train system. Extraordinarily clean stations and trains with cheap fares. The trains run every few minutes. The MRT sets the benchmark for all metro train services throughout the world.
,,Give it a go,4.0,,"I highly recommend the MRT - our hotel had a station opposite. It tended to cost about $1.50 per ride. The tickets are reusable and each time you reuse them you get a 10c discount. You have to use a machine to buy tickets and it is cheaper to pay cash - there is a helper person floating around if you have troubles with the machine.
Most of the stations have a shopping mall above them so it is a great way to go shopping.
The trains ate clean and they seem to come about every 4 minutes"
,,Very clean,4.0,,Wht a lovely surprise to find how clean and efficient the MRT was. It was very easy to use and there was help available if you needed it. Would highly recommend thrying this service.
,,MRT,4.0,,If took us a few trips to get the hang of it but it was worth it. We got the 3 day pass and used it a lot. We traveled all over the island and it was a lot cheaper than getting taxis. Helpful staff.
,,"Quick, clean and easy!",5.0,,Don’t hesitate to use the MRT when in Singapore. It is so simple to use as the lines are all colour coded and it’s easy to swap lines where needed. Consider no other way to get from the airport to the city as it’s cheap and quick.
,,"Reliable, quick, easy to navigate, cheap.",5.0,,"I just spent a week in Singapore and travelled everywhere on the MRT. I initially bought a 3 day tourist pass for $30, then refunded the $10 deposit and bought another one. Yes it's a bit of a nuisance not being able to add to the 3 day pass and the staff at the MRT stations only work at one speed-dead slow, but that's the way it is.
Some of the stations are extensive and you can walk for very long distances, (it reminds me of Seoul), so make allowances if you are following a timetable or are not too fit and able. The trains mainly leave every 4 minutes, so you don't really need to. As with the rest of Singpore, everyone is very compliant and I saw no poor behaviour. On one journey a woman in her 30's gave up her seat for my partner who is not that old but was looking tired after a long day sight-seeing!
Tip-some of the station offices have some odd opening and closing times, such as only open at weekends and one hour dinner breaks 16:45 - 17:45, so check if you need to buy or refund a travel card."
,,"Clean, Spacious and Easy",5.0,,"The MRT was a very good experience it was clean and had plenty of room so didn't feel as claustrophobic as most underground trains and it was easy to navigate.
The only downfall was how you buy your tickets: by queuing up at machines to buy a ticket which would only take cash not card payments."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"Clean, reliable, frequent, great information and instructions, cost effective, goes just about everywhere. What else do you want in mass transit? Bus system is also very good - frequent, clean and affordable."
,,Great value for money,5.0,,"We paid s$30 each for a three day pass to use both the subway and buses. It's a bargain and you get ten dollars back as a deposit on the plastic card too.
The underground system is well set out, trains are wide with plenty of room. Stations invariably have shopping malls attached and the underground maps are clear to follow. The buses tend to be linked to the MRT stations too.
The trains run on time and you are kept well informed whilst both waiting in the station and whilst on the trains too.
One thing that struck us was the cleanliness of the stations and carriages.
We felt very safe on the system, the ticketing methods certainly seem to keep people from freeloading too."
,,The only way to get around,5.0,,"It’s cheap fast and frequent. What more can you say! Don’t expect to always fit in the first train that comes in peak hours though. But people form orderly queues and the next train is along in a couple of minutes so it doesn’t seem to matter. Trains are built for standing with few seats so don’t expect to sit either. Study the map of the system. You may have to change lines to get where you’re going but once again, that usually works smoothly."
,,Easy to Navigate,5.0,,The MRT is brilliant and was an adventure in itself for the children. We certainly got use out of the 3 day tourist passes and would highly recommend.
,,Very efficient and clean,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day tourist pass for the mass transit for S$30 which we will get S$10 back when we turn the card back in. The card is good on buses and subway routes. I was impressed with how clean the subway area is and how modern it looks. It is well used by thousands of people a day. I've never seen such cleanliness for mass transit. There are signs against food/drinks on the subway as well with a S$500 fine (US $375), smoking is a $750 US fine!!!
The trains are well lit and on time!"
,,Very convenient with many sations islanwide.,5.0,,"If you are a light traveler with not much knowledge and first visit of the city.
You should try visiting the island with this train system, it have many stops all around the island, from left to right, north to south, all are covered.
Travel with MRT to knwo the city is a great experience and convenient.
Enjoy it..."
,,Reliable Services,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT was fast & reliable. Their stations were clean and have enough information. It's very easy to find ways and places, even for first timer. Even quite expensive, we always user MRT rather than bus when in Singapore"
,,Still the best way to get around,4.0,,"Ok, the locals like to give it stick, but the MRT is still the best way to get around. It's cheap, convenient and frequent - you will rarely have to wait more than 4 minutes for a train.

Stations are clean, comfortable and safe, and have staff to help.

Get an ezlink card at any station which you can also use on a bus to go to places the train doesn't.

A tip: the top up machines at stations don't always like overseas credit cards so have a $10 or $20 note to recharge."
,,Family visit to Singapore and how to get around,5.0,,"You can't beat the MRT in Singapore. Clean, efficient, fast, well signed, easy to use. So much better than getting around by taxi, that is when you can find one in Singapore!"

,,One of world's best,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is among world class of public transportation. Safe, clean, reliable, fast, uncomplicated, and oh very much affordable. We even took this option for traveling to farther establishments such as the airport and Malaysian border, and it is very much what I had described earlier."
,,Life line of Singapore,5.0,,Metro is life line of Singapore . Most cheap and Time saver journey in Singapore is the best option in Singapore. Metro is the popular safely travel service in singapore.
,,Incredibly clean & well organised,5.0,,"It's well worth getting the tourist card for the duration of your stay, just remember, to get your deposit back, you need to return it within 3 days of expiry. Nobody told us, so we lost out when we tried to return them after spending time away from Singapore & coming back 2 weeks after.
All MRT stations we went to were meticulously clean, so were the carriages, no bad smells either. We didn't experience any malfunction & were brought from A to B in rapid time. Best way to get about the city, really."
,,Easy,5.0,,Easy but not the fastest way to get around Singapore and easy to buy tickets if you have cash under $5 bills.
,,"Fast, efficient, clean and relatively cheap",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT really is the best way to get around the city, especially if you buy a $12 travel card that can be topped up, or a tourist card that is available from certain stations only (including KLIA and Chinatown), which will give you unlimited travel for one, two or three days.Services are frequent and the trains are, as you might expect, clean and of a high standard. You can get to most of the city's attractions by using the SMRT. Announcements and signage are also in English, so it's an easy system to use. Highly recommended."
,,Zoom Around In Style,4.0,,Possibly the best Mass Rapid Transit System i the world - get yourself a smart card and a map and you can go places in Singapore. Perfect travel - point to pint.
,,Cheap good travel,5.0,,The MRT system is excellent. Quick and very safe. it has an extensive network that covers most of Singapore including the airport.
,,Fantastic way to explore singapore,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is fantastic. It is clean and safe. Most efficient train network I have experienced. Trains run on time and arrive every few minutes. The network covers most of Singapore. It's an inexpensive, easy to use service. It's a must do for travelling through Singapore."
,,By Far Easiest Way to Get About,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is one of the best subway systems I've ever experienced. It is comparatively cheap, and stops and lines are very clearly marked. Even with no prior experience of the city, we had no problem getting around. It can get pretty crowded, as this is the main form of transport for much of the population."
,,Public Transport,3.0,,"The easier way to travel around singapore. Almost all attractions and seesight are connected with smrt.

The bus and the train are very clean.. score 10/10 for its cleanliness.. double thumb...

Take a note, red line is the most crowded train especially at rush-hour.. better avoid take this line... alternative you can take a bus..

You can try gothere.sg website to help you saving time when travel around singapore. The website can inform us which best ride to take (bus or train) to save time."
,,"Finally, public transit that just makes sense",5.0,,"Clean, efficient and affordable. We used MRT our whole visit - you simply tap in before getting on and tap put as you exit the destination station. You're only charged a small fee based on the distance travelled. Links up with the bus system, works very well and is clean. Even in the rush hour it never felt like a chore. One of the best public transit systems I've experienced in my extensive travels."
,,Cleanest MRT ever,5.0,,"Have been coming to Singapore for many years and the MRT is always my choice of travel around the city, it’s nice, clean & safe and easy to use."
,,Fantastic network,5.0,,This is the best way to move around It is so cheap.And so clean We caught the train everywhere. It was so easy. The transit system is very frequent as well. Loved it
,,It's called SMRT because it is.,5.0,,Comprehensive and easy to navigate. Open all hours. Low low prices. Clean. Fast. Regular. They are connected to a gazillion shopping centres. Accessible.
,,The Trains are good to reach but connectivity to all places is pretty low.,3.0,,"Taxis and Trains are at the same cost, so if you travel by MRT with a family of 4 and by taxi the cost comes to same amount. I would rate the MRT as expensive compared to other countries and the Taxi services out in Singapore. The advantage of Taxi is you get to travel from Point to Point and save on time."
,,Easy Transport,5.0,,"WE found this the easiest way to get around Singapore as well as cheapest, very easy signs to follow and if your not sure theres people on hand that direct you Id give this a 10 out of 10"
,,I love it!,5.0,,"Best way to get around. We used Singapore tourist card for 3 days then topped up the card after that. 10x cheaper than home in New Zealand. Super fast way to travel, very safe & clean."
,,Easiest and Inexpensive Mode of Transport to Travel around Singapore,4.0,,"If you want to travel around Singapore especially to city centers/major hubs, travelling by MRT trains are the easiest and inexpensive mode of transport.

The trains are clean - no eating and drinking in trains and train stations. There are 6 carriages per train service and you can enter any one of the carriages - they are safe and there are police patrol at various times of the day.

Staff managing Singapore's public transportation (trains and buses) are generally very helpful and polite and they are able to guide you accordingly on where to alight or which exit to use if you are unsure. Most are able to communicate in English.

There are tourist pass that can be used for not only trains but other public modes of transportation.

Public transport in Singapore are basically as efficient and very user-friendly."
,,Cheap and frequent,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is one of the best we've used in terms of frequency and so cheap and clean. We never had to wait more than 3 minutes for a train and it took us to everywhere on our list with some trips costing as little as 71 cents! $17 was what we had on our card for four days of travel (we used it a lot) and we've still got some credit left. We only had one unhelpful staff member- a girl at the Chinatown ticket office - all the other staff were very friendly and happy to assist us with our enquiries (how to top up card, which way to go etc.). Saved us a lot of time an money than using taxis - especially on the congested roads at Christmas."
,,Its very easy to use the Mass Transit,5.0,,Singapore can be a bit crazy if your not used to the other side of the road driving from the United States. Its very easy to jump on SMRT and get where your going.
,,Best way to get to your destination,5.0,,"Walking is the best way to see the sites, but the train is the best to cover that distance; particularly at the end of your long day of sight seeing. The system is functions similar to the Seoul subway system, it is clean, and safe.

You can buy a card and load up or you can re-use a fare ticket up to six times in a 30 day visit; this could save you the $5 hit. The pay fare station did seem a bit complicated but you will learn as you work through it. Leave some time when first using the system to orientate yourself with the pay stations. We had a person help-us at the pay station, I think they were official, friendly and helpful all the same.

The system has a naming convention and a numbering system. It seemed that the naming convention is the one used on the platform, know the next-station in your route to know what side of the platform to stand on.

Enjoy your visit!"
,,Easy commuting in Singapore,5.0,,"Very pocket friendly. If you are not in group, this is best way to commute in Singapore. All stations have self service ticket counters and maps to help you plan your trip."
,,One of the best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"MRT is one of the best transportation you fully utilize in Singapore, from the time you get out of the airport to your last day on the way to the airport. The many stops are greatly designed to let you reach your destination at ease. From shopping malls to main attractions, they will be right outside the MRT station. Don’t be afraid to use them, it is cheaper, more convenient, and Singaporean are friendly to ask directions from. Fully utilized them!!! (But do avoid peak hours, in the morning and evening, when people are trying to get to and get off work)"
,,The Best Public Transportation Ever!,5.0,,"I bought an Ezelink card and its convenient since I can use that for MRT, LRT, Sentosa Express and Public Bus! You can buy the card for SGD 12 where the card have SGD 7 in it for you to spend for the transportation. The other option is buy a tourist card."
,,So efficient and safe,5.0,,"We used this system to get around Singapore for 5 days and never had any issues. Lots of signage, clean restrooms and available personnel for any questions. Get an EZ card and it’s a minimum of $10 to top off but you get refunded the balance when you turn it in."
,,Puts the pleasure in Transit,5.0,,"Forget about the gorey image you have of subways and transportation, SMRT was quick, efficient, clean and convenient. If you follow my recommendation on Oasia hotel, you can access SMRT within 2 minutes."
,,Best transportation,5.0,,"If you want to transport all across Singapore with not-so-expensive budget, you may use SMRT. They have stations in almost every best spot in Singapore."
,,SMRT,4.0,,Highly recommend purchasing a 1/2/3 day Singapore Tourist Pass STP...this will entitle you to travel the underground unlimited for the desired period.. Efficient Clean and precise English depicted throughout the underground One of the best rapid underground I've travel on
,,Cheapest mode of transportation,5.0,,This connect the length and breadth of Singapore in shortest possible time and cheapest mode of travel
,,Very efficient and clean,4.0,,This is one of the world's best metro systems. It is clean and efficient and can get you just about anywhere you want to go.
,,love the public transport in Singapore,5.0,,"We lived here for 3 years, and are always excited to get our SMRT cards and head out on the MRT or the bus to get around town. Clean, safe, and air-conditioned, simple to use, what more could one ask for?"
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"We bought a 2 day pass, which let us discover Singapore at our pace. Great value and as you would expect trains clean and comfortable - avoid rush hours."
,,Transport,4.0,,This is not really an attraction but more of a way to get around Singapore. Very efficient and good connection with the exception of certain areas North and East of Singapore which are only reachable by bus.
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,Very clean and roomy which is great when busy. Easy to use. Buy a card that you can top up when needed.
,,"Clean, fast, efficient",5.0,,Bought the 2 day unlimited pass for $26 pp but it includes a $10 refund upon return of the card. The Asians truly understand mass movement of people! Stations are clean and air conditioned and people act in an orderly fashion at all times. Trains are also clean and efficient. Very good way to travel around the city.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"This is cheap, it goes every where in Singapore & is busy. We have always used cabs, but no more. It is central to where we stay in Singapore in Bencoolen Street."
,,"Constantly being upgraded, extended and new lines created",5.0,,"Modern, efficient (despite the protestations of local residents) standard gauge transport system.
Well designed universally clean and easy to use. Compared to other countries systems, this is both very good value and meets the needs of both local and visitor.
There are a number of ticketing options available - but we found these quite confusing, although they form a part of a truly integrated transport system - the Mass Rapid Transit .
The system which dates from 1987 is constantly being upgraded, extended and new lines created."
,,"Required to get around, get the PASS!",5.0,,"I would highly recommend using this while in Singapore. You can get up to a (3) day pass from what I recall and you can get a portion of your money back ($10) if you return your card even without the receipt. So it has unlimited uses for the days you use it. DO NOT FORGET THIS: it is from midnight to midnight, so if you start using the card at 8am do NOT expect it to be used until 8am the following day."
,,A great way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"I was advised by relatives to get a 24 hour tourist pass , a great idea and cost effective. The unused units can be refunded at the ticket office. We saw a fair bit of the city using the SMRT."
,,Ultra effecient,5.0,,Used this a lot. Very clean. Felt safe travelling on it. Can get extremely busy at popular tourist destinations. Very easy to navigate around.
,,Very very efficient at a great price point,4.0,,"When in Singapore, we tend to take the very efficient MRT trains and buses everywhere. The MRT train carriages are air conditioned and always very clean and the frequency makes this a no brainer for point to point travel. Missed a train? Never mind, another will be here within 3 to 6 minutes. No timetables needed.

You can’t get lost either. Grab an MRT map with colour coded lines and numbered stops. Platforms and directions in stations are very clearly marked. On board, announcements of approaching stations are clear and there are also visual signboards in each carriage, so it’s easy to navigate.

But be warned that there’s no real peak or off peak periods of travel. It’s often standing room only. Think of very clean, shiny sardine cans on steroids.

Tip: it’s a cashless system, so you must buy a stored value MRT card. If you’re not I’m Singapore for long, you can either buy a tourist card or a local card. Local cards cost $12, made up of $5 non refundable card cost and $7 stored value. Minimum top up is $10 and the cards are valid for 5 years.

Also, remember it’s a tap-on and tap-off system. On the trains, you must tap off to exit the stations, so there’s no chance of forgetting. On buses, if you forget to tap off, the maximum fare is charged."
,,Clean fast and efficient,4.0,,"We used the MRT to get into town from Changi Airport. Two things to note about this. First, if like us you want to purchase one of the tourist all day cards, the little office on the MRT station below terminal 2 does not open until 8.00am in the morning. We flew in at 6.30am and were stranded for the best part of an hour and quite a que built up behind us in this time. I would view thtis as short sighted management as clearly there is demand for longer hours at the airport. By the time we caught the train in we were slap bang in rush hour. Beware very full packed trains between 8.00am and 9.00am heading into town. Can't fault the service in any other way. Now we are in town and hopping on and off the trains and buses its a fantastic way to get around and see Singapore"
,,Great value,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day MRT pass. Was well used with 5 in our family. Very efficient service, plenty of transport available"
,,Easy fast,5.0,,You can navigate with ease from one point to another. Clean cool easy fast. And signs are totally easy to sort out
,,Marvellous transport system,5.0,,"Amazing trasport system in city
Very well managed
Well designed
Clean
Cheap
Well equipped
Safe

We enjoyed full 14 days in Singapore without mrt u can't imagine to see the city

It's pass is valid for train for bus and for some taxi also

I feel nothing batter connected trasport system is in run anywhere in world"
,,Convenient but more stations required,4.0,,"Excellent for getting around singapore. Much more cheaper than using a taxi. DONOT buy the tourist ticket as it works out way more expensive. Make sure you buy the EZ LINK card and just top up as you need to.

According to press, one new station is being built every 2 months and by 2030 there should be enough stations all over the entire city."
,,Gets you around Singapore so easily,5.0,,"With an extensive network around Singapore that is still growing every year, the MRT is easily the best option for getting around Singapore. Far, far cheaper than a taxi and possibly faster too depending on your destination.

Changing lines is easy so you can get to any place with relative ease. They run very frequently, stations are well marked and maps are everywhere in stations and on trains. The trains and stations are kept in excellent condition."
,,Easy to use - but allow time for changes,5.0,,"The system is very easy to use, everything is in English. Plenty of staff on hand.

The stations are massive so allow time to change.

We bought an EZ link card at Changi and kept topping it up, so much easier than buying tickets at the stations."
,,Simple and cheap,5.0,,Buy the tourist card - good value and you get your deposit back! It was easy enough to orchestrate too.
,,Metro!,4.0,,The best resource for all travels in singapore city! The connectivity is not that great but walkers will find it as the best mode of transport!
,,"Once you get it, you won't stop using it!",5.0,,"Efficient, clean, fast - and once you have stood looking bewildered and getting advice and help from locals (lah!) - you will love it."
,,A MODEL TRANSPORT SYSTEM,5.0,,"Once we discovered that our hotel was near an MRT station...off we went!
We decided to purchase a 2 day tourist pass, and after a number of inquiries, found that these could be purchased at the Passenger Service Centre at Chinatown.

Positive: We zapped all over Singapore with ease...the MRT took us to all the places we wanted to visit...and it goes to Changi Airport

Negative: We purchased our pass, and used it at 2 pm in the afternoon. We assumed in would be valid for two days from that time...but it wasn't. It expired at midnight on the next day. We had to purchase single journey fares after that.

I took us no time at all to become familiar with the system, and we found that nearly all venues/shopping centres/attractions state which MRT station is closest to them online and in brochures.

We were very impressed with the platform staff who so willingly gave us directions. The minute we stopped and looked lost someone seemed to approach us!"
,,Effective and efficient,5.0,,It comes very handy from the ticketing system to the terminal and stops management. I could say the most effective transportation in south east asia
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to use and navigate. Cheap. Best to get a ezlink pass. These can be obtained from ticket booths. Card cost is $7 and you get $5 already credited so the total cost to you is $12. At most machines, and there are plenty around, you can top up as required.

It is very clean and safe. Your ezlink pass can also be used on buses and taxi's. So, it is certainly worth getting one of these for ease of getting around."
,,The driverless routes,4.0,,"The SBS Transit MRT’s and LRT’s are all driverless, however the MRT’s are underground, so there,s no point of windows at the front. But the fact that they are clean and tidy makes it a good thing to do."
,,New Year Visit,5.0,,Fantastic system and extremely easy to use and fantastic value for money we used a taxi on arrival and although it was great after a long fight the SMRT is a mear 2.20sgd compared to the 35sgd for a taxi to Marina Bay.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Easy system to use, self explanatory. Prices are low, unbelievably clean. Get from one place to another in minutes, much faster than a taxi service."
,,Is SMRT really that bad???,4.0,,"There have been recent problems of MRT multiple breakdowns over the recent years and many travellers have been frustrated and blaming everybody from the culture to the management to the government and practically anybody related to SMRT.

The SMRT was completed in the late 1980s and have served Singaporeans and visitors for about 3 decades. There were no major incident all these years except for an accident of a front-to-back collision between two trains at Clementi station on 5 August 1993 until the most recent Joo Koon collision in Nov 2017. In a recent rail reliability figures provided by the Land Transport Authority, they reported one disruption per 158,000 train-km travelled for the entire MRT network here in the first six months of 2017. In fact, the annual report indicated that Mean Kilometer Between Failure for delays lasting longer than 5 minutes on the NSEWL improved from 65,000km in 2012 to 140,000km to 2015. SMRT do strive to improve their operational efficiencies and quality.

While we cannot say SMRT is perfect or excellent, I am generally pleased with the transport service. I do not intend to criticise the SMRT here as it is a issue for another place and time.

As a regular traveller using public transport, the usual KPIs like punctuality, cleanliness, safety, service staff quality etc have been good in my opinion. There is also no major reports of passengers complaints in newspapers all these years. I appreciate the convenience of setting up retail shops around each station as it gives commuters an added service from F&B to selling general goods to even apparel.

Lets just be happy that we have a world class clean and efficient subway transport that is better than the run-down New York or London. Just my 2 cents worth. Happy Commuting!!!"
,,World's Best Train System !,5.0,,"As a Railway worker myself, I like to experience what it's like to travel on trains in other countries, and I have to say that Singapore has the best train system of any country I have ever been to. (only Hong Kong comes close)
For such a small and densely populated place, the train system of Singapore runs like clockwork, is cheap, and also very clean."
,,Efficient and reliable,5.0,,"We purchased the 3-day pass and were able to use it on the MRT and buses. The MRT was clean, well lighted, efficient, and runs frequently and on time."
,,Excellent travel option @ affordable price,5.0,,"daily pass of 10 sing $, travel all around the island. excellent maps available at all access point."
,,wow,5.0,,"what a wonderful transit system. It surely puts many transit system here in Us to shame. well organized easy to use, tourist friendly.Cheep . loved using and experience it."
,,Great system,5.0,,"I am not sure I count this as a thing to do in Singapore but I did use it to get around. It is extremely easy to use and get around. It is very affordable. I tired to get a tourist pass as it was recommended but the stop near my hotel did not sell them - good to know that not all stops sell them. However, the staff working at the station were very helpful and told me where I could get one. Instead I just decided to buy individual rides when I needed them which worked out just fine for my needs. I like that you put in your destination and only pay what that trip costs - not wasting money or having to guess how much you need.

Very clean as well! Easy to use - just use the maps."
,,Super reliable but incredibly busy,4.0,,"It is extremely rare for their SMRT system to be late AT ALL. Which helps with the crowds at peak periods. You know that if this train is super busy, there is usually one that arrives (~maximum) 10 minutes time."
,,MRT Aman,5.0,,"Last week i was visited Singapore for holiday with my mom & using MRT for transportation. We purchased STP for SGD 38 that can be used within 3 days.
MRT is very safe, i found a lot of women who wear skirt, tanktop or shorts in MRT and nothing happens to them. But i think it's cheaper to use grab/taxi if you are travelling with 2 or more person because you can share the cost."
,,Superb,5.0,,"Clean, very reliable and highly professional Service. Fantastic, never waited more than 5 minutes to be moved on. Well done MRT Singapore."
,,way to go for public transport,5.0,,It was so easy to buy a tourist pass and roam around in train and bus across Singapore. It is such an economical proposition when you by a 3 day card. No hassles and round the clock service even to remote places. Kudos to LTA.
,,Excellent mean of transportation...,5.0,,"Singapore has very good and efficient public transportation. Travelling by SMRT is definitely one of the best ways to move around in the city state, right from the airport and more economical to get a season pass..."
,,Fast and easy to use,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is one of the best of the world. Very clean, fast, always on time, safe, ... I love using it."
,,MRT great way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,We paid SGD2.50 each to travel from the airport to Chinatown. Then SGD1.70 each to travel to Bugis. Its so easy! You need to purchase your single use ticket at the self service machine so you'll need $5 in notes or coins. If you need change you can go to the Passenger Help Desk.
,,Great Value and Fast,5.0,,"Get the tourist travel pass and ensure you return the card at the airport - that way transport costs you very little whether by bus or MRT. Great, safe and clean family transport option."
,,Best way to transport,5.0,,Fastest and best way to travel in Singapore specially during peak hours as traffic otherwise is unpredictable.
,,Efficiency at its highest,5.0,,The best way to travel around Singapore and instructions on how to use the lines are amazingly simple and the prices cheap as dirt Well done Singapore Well done MRT You nailed this for the tourists as well
,,Problemfree but close early,4.0,,"Great option for transportation, only caveat is the opening hours. Its closed in the night. If you plan to be out really late, you have to find another option."
,,Perfect,5.0,,"There are many ways to move around in Singapore. This time though I sort of fell in love with the SMRT bus and subway services. In part because a mayor stop was just outside my hotel in Orchard Rd.. But beyond this I was impressed with the reliability, frequency and cleanliness of all the vehicles I used. Adding to that is a technological standard that combines well both effectiveness and consumer friendliness. Can‘t wait to get on the road again with SMRT. P.s. at home I usually try to avoid riding public busses..."
,,A day at work,5.0,,"The Singapore SMRT is one of the world's most efficient and expanding rapid transport system. I take the train to work almost everyday and for weekend trips across the city. For those who are tourists you can choose to get 3 day tourist pass for unlimited travel for 20 sgd.
Given that the waiting time is about 5 min there is no hassle in queuing up for taxis."
,,Crowded,4.0,,"Singapore is rated one of the 3 most expensive cities in the world to live in. The other 2 cities are New York and London.
Almost everything is expensive and that includes transport. Therefore buses & MRT would be a cheaper mean of transportation.

The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is almost always so crowded. Unless you start the journey at the very beginning of the line, it is almost impossible to get seats. Especially if the destination is going into the city center."
,,Singapore Holiday,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT has to be one of the best transport services I have traveled on. I had an EZ card which I topped up when I arrived at Changi, quick transport into City Hall - about 20 minutes including the change at Tanah Merah.......hopped on and off the train for the 10 days I was there and the trips were so quick and efficient."
,,Always on time!,5.0,,I've had to ride the mrt for a few weeks to another office across Singapore. The trains come often and stations are close to where you want to go. It can get crowded during rush hour but that is normal for a large city. I'm just happy I don't have to commute everyday!
,,Easy and effecient,5.0,,"So easy and efficient that you'll be wanting your own MRT. Just go, no need to look at a schedule, it's running very frequently."

,,Marvellous transport service,5.0,,Well...this is the best & interesting transport service that u could hv here at singapore..efficient & fast
,,Just like any other MRT nothing special,3.0,,"Just like any other metro train one takes any where else intact our country has better, found the MRT taking way more time than a taxi as a mode of transport plus the added walking time !"
,,"Efficient, economical way to see Singapore",5.0,,"The MRT system is amazing, most of the underground stations are like a city in itself. Cheap and efficient way to get around, we bought the 3 day tourist pass and it enabled us to unlimited rides on trains and buses. What a way to travel from end to end. Clean and quite easy to navigate, if you ever get lost, the friendly staff are always on hand to help. The underground stations goes on and on, deep int9 the earth just like a huge city in itself."
,,Excellent mode of transportation to see Singapore,5.0,,"Well connected and with an easylink pass (buy the passes from the MRT station and not seven eleven as you get a better deal), the best way to travel and look around the entire Singapore City! Download the moovit app for the MRT station details and the train service and MRT+Bus connectivity."
,,The easiest and cleanest way of travelling!,5.0,,"No food or beverage allowed in the platform or train, so it was absolutely clean! Ac-ed and cool. For tourists, I would highly recommend the Tourist pass. It was WAY MORE economical and can be used on all busses and trains."
,,Go all around the city,5.0,,This mode of transport is just the best. It is affordable and takes you virtually anywhere in the city. The stations are located in the centre of all of the main attractions. We even visited family in the suburbs with no problem. It is super fast. Top notch way to travel safely.
,,Best transport system in the world,5.0,,You can literally go anywhere by train. It is so easy to navigate your way around. This was a brilliant way to travel for our family
,,Local Travel,5.0,,"Excellent travel service by the government for all local + tourist, very economically priced with great time to time service, has multi option to choose from as your requirement"
,,Excellent service with very less waiting time,5.0,,"The ticketing facility, specially for the visitors is excellent and very user-friendly. The cleanliness is impressive. The frequency of service is a wow..."
,,Clean and Quick,4.0,,The only mode of transport for most Singaporeans and linked to plenty destinations in SG. Very convenient.
,,Take the metro in Singapore....clean and easy,5.0,,"This is a wonderful way to get around - we took the two day Tourist Pass with a refund when you return it - $16 for 2 days plus a $10 deposit. East to get around, clean, fast and fun. Easy to get to downtown from the airport in about 30 minutes. Walked between stops and got back on again. Great way to explore."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Clean and easy to use to get around Singapore. Compared to other places the service was cheap very few people on board
,,"Easy to use, clean and safe",5.0,,"We used the MRT a number of times during our trip and found it to be excellent value for money, spotlessly clean and easy to use."
,,"Efficient, clean, fast, cheap, secure Underground",5.0,,"This is one of the most modern and well kept public transport systems on the planet ! Many stations are climatized and absolutely tidy. Security all over and direct access to shopping malls, hotels, public buildings.
Plus, it is really cheap - fares are quite low.
This is _the_ way to move around in Singapore, besides Taxis."
,,Saviour to all your travel troubles,5.0,,"Me and my husband were on a pocket-check tour of Singapore. To go around, cabs were getting quite expensive and we decided to look for more economic ways to get around. The buses were an option, they are well connected and are available in number, the problem however, is they do not give you change, which over a number of days can take a slight hit on your pocket. That is when MRT came to our rescue.
One of the stations was very close to our hotel, so we decided to take a ride. Highly economical and highly safe. There is always ample room to stand etc. and the crowd is decent. Even if you are travelling late at night, it is 100% safe.
I would suggest you buy the smart card, if you are there for more than 3 days and expect to do all your travel using it. You can get it for S$12 per person, which gives you a credit of S$7. Seems like a lot when you loose S$5, but it makes your travel super duper convenient. It is valid for 5 years, so if you plan on travelling again, this is your best bet. Or you can hand it over to a friend or family member visiting in the coming years.
I would definitely recommend using the MRT.
Also, in case you know where your hotel is and know of the closest MRT, hop onto one and get there. We were not very sure of the MRT station, so we took a cab to the hotel when we landed. The cab cost us S$22 and on our way back to the airport, we took the MRT and it cost us less than S$1.8 per person."
,,Lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,"Reliable, Clean, Safe, On Time, Coverage, Easy, Convenient are few adjectives which goes absolutely well with SMRT. It is the best way to explore the city. SMRT takes you to every corner of the city. It takes you as close as Vivo Mall for Sentosa island, from where you can enter the island on a monorail. It operates till 11:30PM usually. The SMRT station and trains are amazingly clean. You can get a SMRT card from any station at 15$ cost. 5$ is the card cost and you get a credit of 10$ in your card. Once, the balance reaches below 3$, then you need to recharge the card on multiple of 10. If you are in Singapore for a week or so, then I would suggest you to get a normal card. It comes with a validity of around 10 years. Once you have the card, then it is just a matter of swipe in and out from stations. The leftover credits can also be used for purchases from stores like 7/11. They apply variable pricing for your trips. You will be charged more in peak time. But, still, it would be quite affordable and time saving. Just grab a map, and you can reach anywhere in Singapore using SMRT"
,,Very user friendly for visitors,5.0,,Gosh it is nice to come to a country where the trains work so well! We suggest all visitors eat an EZ link card where most rides are only 77c
,,"Clean, modern, quick",5.0,,"We loved getting around Singapore this way. The stations and trains were so clean and safe, we explore much of Singapore this way and stayed cool! Tickets are cheap and easy to buy."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Easy to use , clean , super efficiency and in expensive. All very close to attractions Use the MRT every time"
,,SMRT Christmas 2017,5.0,,"The MRT is very easy system to use and travel is very cheap. The trains and stations are in a very clean state and customer service was good. We used the Standard Ticket type and found it easy to use and even when we had peak timing at the Bayfront station, the line move quickly. Getting in from Changi airport was easy and the trains were frequent."
,,Amazing Efficiency,5.0,,"Singapore's public transport is the gold standard. Timely, clean, effective and efficient. With an extensive network that leaves nowhere out of reach, travelling is a breeze. Fantastic."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Very clean and convenient mode of transportation. connects many tourist attractions. easy to use and cheap too.
,,Most Convenient and comfortable.,4.0,,"Easy, comfortable, cheap and best technology. Use it and follow the theme of Public transport of Land Transport Authority Singapore."
,,Complicated,2.0,,"With the older lines running just north to south and east to west, it seemed to function as it needed. But as the system aged it gets plagued with problems and a system architecture that boggles your mind, u’ll be sure to either get stuck or take the wrong train. It’s not a user friendly system like in countries with a well established underground network."
,,Impressed with SMRT,5.0,,Took the SMRT a few times while visiting Sigapore with family. It was a lot cheaper than taking cabs . The train stations were very impressive because they were very clean and organized and they were very accessible from a lot of the places we went to. It was also easy to buy tickets and easy to get through the stations.
,,"Take note world, this is how it should be done.",5.0,,"Let's just start with affordability. $2.50 from the airport to the centre of the city.
Then let's consider cleanliness. No rubbish, graffiti, shredded seats or scratched windows.
Then we should look at reliability. The trains came regularly and when there was a problem on the line, the customers were informed.

Makes Queensland Rail look like a joke.

Pat yourselves on the back Singapore MRT, you are world class. I would have trouble picking a winner between you and the Hong Kong service.

What could you do to improve? Well, perhaps either change machines as there is a limit on the denomination of banknotes that can be used on the self-service machines or the ability to top up those 10 trip travel cards with a credit card."
,,Excellent,5.0,,The MRT in Singapore is spotlessly clean and easy to use. I am not used to taking public transportation so I was a bit reluctant. It was convenient to many attractions and people were extremely kind to offer assistance.
,,Torist pass,5.0,,Easy to use. Bought tourist passes from Bugis station as was within walking distance from where we were staying. Had a bus stop right outside our hotel. Easy to use. Hand card back in & get $10SG back.
,,Sydney come and learn,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is just fabulous. Super clean, on time every few minutes, safe air conditioned, friendly staff. Get round the city in comfort quickly. Easy to navigate"
,,So easy!,5.0,,MRT is great. Kids can follow the map & be in charge of getting you places. Time is convenient when sometimes taxis take a while.
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,The Singapore SMRT is such a fast and convenient way to get around the city. We bought the tourist pass and found it an excellent way to see all of the sites with most attractions being located close to a station.
,,easy even for the first timer,5.0,,"the directory is clear and accessible all over the stations.
for the first timer, smrt is easy to access, and for me, I prefer the tourist pass which you can buy at the aiport counter, with this pass you can enjoy the mrt, lrt, and bus.
one thing to notice, you have to ensure the exit to the closest to your destination"
,,Best Public Transport,5.0,,"So way to use, so easy to get around. Simply efficient and stunning infrastructure for travellers to get around."
,,Very useful,5.0,,"Is of great help to travel around. Would be worth if you did some research online to plan the travel. The only problem is very few stations let you buy / return the tourist card but that includes Changi Airport MRT so that is good. If you have a fair bit of travel, worth the money . Sometimes if it is just one destination and back, for a family of four, it may be equally cheap in cab or Uber."
,,Give yourself 30mins buffering time during peak hours,3.0,,"Crowded & Longer waiting time during peak hours. Avoid busy morning from 6:30am-9am 5:30pm-7:30pm However, the interior designs are eye catching sometimes. May spot your favourite movie posters. Tactiles are inconvenient for the visually impaired. The new mrt trains pose difficulties to them as well."
,,"Fast, easy and cheap way to get around",5.0,,"The SMRT train system is very easy to use and inexpensive. The maps are helpful. It can be a bit crowded, but then, so is every train system in every city. The trains are clean and efficient."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Such a pleasure to use. Very clean, affordable and user friendly. Best transport system I have used so far."
,,MRT,5.0,,"great way to get around and not hard to workout, fast and regular, recommend getting EZLink card from MRT station and can be topped up with $10 lots used my mine for 7 days and cost around $30"
,,An excellent system for exploring.,5.0,,"This MRT system has grown to be very comprehensive, efficient and punctual. Station staff are helpful.

I've been riding the trains here since the 80s and the cleanliness of stations and trains has not declined. There is an active expansion of the system and moving around Singapore is so easy.

Naturally crowded at times but seems to cope with the crowds. Trains are driverless."
,,True efficiency,5.0,,"Cheap must use .Sugggest to get Ezlink card-cost initial $12S for $5S for card and $7S for train.Cost per trip is less than $2 unless off to Sentosa Island-$4.If need be, easily top up with cash or credit card-instruction is easy-only 3steps process.Signage before entry and routes are everywhere.Very good signage."
,,MRT trips,4.0,,"Clean & wide walking space
Escalators & staircases in all stations
No dustbins available to prevent terrorist Attack incidence
But don’t have money changer in each stations though
Don’t have toilet inside the MRT so if you are urgent, have to alight from the station & find the nearby toilets.

I Guess it’s for safety purpose but indeed inconvenience if really in need."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,Very easy to get around. Buy a eze ticket at the train station and you can use this on the bus too. Some of the stations are on two levels but the maps are easy to follow and plenty of people to ask for directions. Trains very clean no eating allowed on eith trainions or on the stations. Much much cheaper than the London Underground. Trains also frequent. Wld recommend this way to see Singapore.
,,Runs like clockwork,4.0,,"In my earlier trips to Singapore, I would always get a taxi, but being directionally challenged, I opted to use the SMRT and was pleasantly surprised by its efficiency and the fact that shuttling between the purple line and yellow line trains, not forgetting the downtown trains, was not as daunting as anticipated. Everything runs to schedulw and I always managed to get a seat. The Singaporean accent of the announcer was confusing at times, though - pronounced destinations wth English names rather unclearly."
,,Very Efficient Transportation,5.0,,Excellent means of transportation. Highly reliable. Even thou you need to transfer from one line to another its very convenient to passengers.
,,Super clean and punctual,5.0,,"Used the MRT whilst visiting family in SG. Clean, easy to use and very cheap. Stations are spotless with working clean washrooms. Trains punctual and escalators and lifts all work faultlessly."
,,Rapid transit,5.0,,"It is a very easy to follow system. It can take you anywhere quick, the trains and stations are modern, clean and no graffiti.
The ticket machines are easy to follow, the fares are reasonable, just have small notes or change as they only give maximum $4 change."
,,Best MRT experience ever,5.0,,"I learnt wats an MRT here ages ago, before these were introduced in India. The trains and stations are always kept clean. The directions and name boards are clear and effective. The staff are always around to help when needed."
,,Best MRT in Asia,5.0,,The MRt here is so modern and professional! Always on time and clean ! You can go around the country by MRT ! It’s easy to take a MRT station ! I love to travel and would like to stay here forever Love singapore
,,Best Public Transport,5.0,,"You don't need to hire a car or use taxis. Very efficient , clean and cheap . We paid for tickets as we went along. No need to rush for your train, theres one running about every 5 mins. Easy to understand and clearly marked maps. Do be prepared to do plenty of walking as sometimes the actual trains is far underground and far in the actual subway. Only tricky part is working out which exit to take ! Most of the stops take you straight into a shopping centre."
,,The quickest way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"If you are looking to not spend a lot on taxis in Singapore then MRT is your saviour. It connects every nook and corner of Singapore and most stations have bus stops also right next to the exits.
You can get a tourist pass for $20 for 3 days. Else the ticket that you buy can be used 6 times with small discounts on your 3rd and 6th trips. The ticket will need to be recharged for these trips through the automatic machines at each station."
,,Best of all,5.0,,If you want to travel less expensive this is the way. You can google the station you have to get down. Take a travel card so you pay less than the regular ticket for a ride. Easy to travel.
,,Quick and easy way to get around.,4.0,,"There are numerous stations and the trains come quite frequently. The ticket machines are easy to use as well. Depending on how long you are here, there are a few ticketing options. It is very cheap fora metro as well."
,,From the Gardens by the Bay to Chinatown,5.0,,"Easy system to use. Buying tickets from the machine, everything was in English. Only error we made was exiting from the wrong exit when we arrived at Chinatown, maps on the walls were outside the ticket barriers."
,,Very fast and conveinient,5.0,,"Very fast and convenient transport service, accurate timetable. Very clean Trains and the stations. Very easy connections from all stations."
,,Only way of getting around Singapore,5.0,,"Didn’t use a taxi or bus once in my 4 night stay in singapore. The SMRT covers everywhere you will want to go to. It is frequent, fast, clean and very cheap."
,,Fastest and cheapest way to get around the city,5.0,,Everything is nice and clean. Nothing negative to say. Very helpfull staff. It would be nice to have that in New York USA.
,,Bad!,1.0,,Lousy transportation. Taking a bus could hv reached earlier than taking mrt these days. Absurd fare with lousy services.
,,Convenient and easy to find your way around,4.0,,"The MRT system in Singapore is really good. If you are here for a short rip , say around 3-5 days, it is best to get a tourist card. If you are staying here for longer or if you are planning to revisit singapore frequently, buy yourself a NETS/EZlink card that is available at all ticketing counters in the stations. Download the MRT map and you are set to go. The MRT connects you to most tourist destinations and it is cheaper if you are travelling solo or as a couple. There are maps and announcements on all trains, and wheel chair accessible. What is best is that you could connect to different lines without exiting the stations (it saves you from rain and sun ). The staff and security are very friendly and they may be able to guide you to the destination. All MRT stations will have a bus stop and taxi stop just outside . so i find it the best way to get around even if it doesnt connect me to the destination directly, i go to the nearest MRT and take a bus from there, saves money . You use the same card for all MRT and Buses and even in taxis . If you are travelling between multiple stops at a stretch on the same day, the charges are lower."
,,Great connectivity throughout Singapore,5.0,,"Punctuality, ease of travel, cleanliness, connectivity (both in terms of travel and Wifi) define Singapore MRTS"
,,So easy on the MRT,5.0,,"Needing to use the MRT, the system is so efficient. Buying a ticket, catching a train, if only it was so clean, cheap and efficient at home, it would be great. Here the trains are clean, it is easy to understand where you are with the on board automated system, the trains are clean and it is a great way to get around and see Singapore."

,,Very helpful staff,5.0,,"The MRT is well organised and staff are extremely friendly. The staff at Rochor MRT was very friendly and assisted us in providing all details on what kinds of ticket exist and how to buy tickets.
The stations are all neatly maintained with escalators in all places"
,,Easy to navigate,4.0,,MRT is one of the fastest and cheapest way to get around the city. Buy the EZ Link card for easy access and download the “gothere.sg” app to help you figure out which train/station to take.
,,SMRT is the best,5.0,,"When I'm little, I used to spend my vacation in singapore, strolling around the city with taxi But now I enjoy SMRT! You could go anywhere, anytime and still feel safe If you afraid get lost, don't worry the SMRT map is everywhere or just...More"
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,My daughter and I enjoyed riding on the SMRT due to its ease of use. After getting clear instructions from our Hotel concierge we found it easy to purchase tickets form the machine and then travel to our various destinations. It saved so much time...More
,,Transport,5.0,,Best public transport I have ever used. MSo clean and well organised. Need more rubbish bins around. Melbourne Australia could certainly learn alot.

,,Easy to use,5.0,,"With the many stops available it is an easy way to get you to all the hot spots in the city and it is easy to use. It is safe, clean and highly efficient."
,,nil,4.0,,easy access. amenities nearby. can be a bit overcrowded during certain time..be sure to travel during off peak periods as the fee is lesser
,,Efficient and cheap,4.0,,A few recent incidents highlighted the odd risk of breakdowns on the MRT but it is simply the best way to travel cheaply and quickly to most parts of Singapore.
,,Excellent,4.0,,We only used once as we have v limited experience using this type of transport Fast cheap and like clock work..... just need to do more homework on using it better!
,,"Efficient, reliable, affordable, clean, safe transport",5.0,,"Public transport especially the train system in Singapore was excellent. Trains were on time, safe, efficient and reliable. The stations were also clean and well maintained. We even took the train to the airport with kids and luggage with ease. Another highlight about Singapore’s public...More"
,,The easiest and cheapest transport,4.0,,"So easy to get around and understand how the maps work. Very helpful staff everywhere and easy to pay and go on/off. Buy nets card and top up, 12 dollar card you get 7 dollar ride and top up from there but you cant use the last 3 dollars on it since it will show ""to little amount to ride"". Avoid 5pm to 7pm, too crowded."
,,Best thing of our trip,5.0,,"Really!!! it was SMRT who let us enjoy each and every moment of the trip.

Because of SMRT and facilities, I was able to see & reach every beautiful place of Singapore. Its Tourist Pass facility let us enjoy our trip and reach every place without even thinking of getting it recharged, just need to get the tourist pass depending on your desire, one day, two or three day and can travel in metro's any number of times in a day.

Right from the airport to our hotel and from hotel to every place like Little India, Singapore Zoo, Sentosa Island, we were able to reach the destination without any hassles.

Really Helped a lot in saving our money, which we could have given in taxis."
,,Clean and All Connected,4.0,,"One of the best mass transportation that you can count in Singapore. Clean, precise also connected to all places."
,,Cleanest & Best In The World,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is without a doubt the cleanest & best in the world. We actually enjoy using this very cheap, fast, reliable & safe train system. When in Singapore this is the easiest way to move around & explore all parts of the city."
,,Take a leaf out of this book World!,5.0,,"Undoubtedly the best MRT system ever.

Grab a visitor pass for your stay and experience how easy it is to get from one place to another without the traffic jams or the taxi meter ticking over.

We frequent Singapore and I was a little hesitant on my first visits but after much coaching from my beloved, I am now hooked. The only time we cab is if we are going to a restaurant a little out of the way or we are all dressed up and don't want the humidity to detract from our good looks .

Whether in a walking tunnel/platform switching between lines or in the rail cab, it's all air-conditioned."
,,Excellent public system,5.0,,"it is fast, frequent service. You can use it everywhere in Singapore. And it was very cheap to use, it cost me less than 3 Singaporean Dollars for a trip from Changi Airport to Chinatown. Everything automatic, so it is ontime."
,,Cool & Convenient!,4.0,,"Superb way to get around Singapore! It is cool, convenient and simple! Honestly the best way to see as much of Singapore as possible!"
,,Dont spend on taxis,5.0,,Buy a MRT card and use it. Very efficient and timely transport. After few rides you get a hang of it. If a small number of people best way to travel cheap.
,,Well laid out,5.0,,A convenient way to get around the city. Well laid out and the routes cover most of the places that a traveler would like to go to. It is the cheapest way to move from place to place and the trains keep to the schedule.
,,Efficient transport service,5.0,,"As I've experienced in the past, travelling from one place to another In Singapore is almost effortless riding the trains - or for that matter, the buses as well, but especially the trains.

Staff on the stations are helpful and maps displaying station stops also assist tremendously - and this time in Singapore,I have encountered a couple of extremely helpful bus drivers as well."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Singapore metro is safe clean reliable and easy to use as an English speaking tourist. Buy a 1, 2 or 3 day travel card and remember that you get $10 when you return the card!"
,,On Time!!,5.0,,I love riding MRT because on time and very clean. near MRT there always nice place to eat and do a little shopping
,,Clean and efficent,5.0,,The very best subway system I have traveled on. With a modicum of research you can use it from the airport to any area of greater Singapore
,,The best way around Singapore,5.0,,We loved using the MRT. It was easy to navigate but in doubt there was always staff to assist. It is cheap to get around and the trains were very frequent and clean.. We have sometimes just got on the MRT and got off at a stop outside the city and wandered around a local residential area to get a better idea of the true Singapore. Its fun and interesting to do.
,,Breakdown,3.0,,"In view of the recent breakdowns and also the service maintenance schedule, SMRT Trains are still considered reliable"
,,"Clean, convenient, efficient",5.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore, the MRT is one of the world's best. Suggest you buy a pass for multiple trips during your stay."
,,"Extensive, inexpensive and air conditioned",4.0,,"We used this a lot, although there are still pockets not fully served. Word of caution: the escalators are fast! Be prepared to step on and off very quickly."
,,HHmmm,4.0,,Hhmmm i would say Singapore's MRT is clean and efficient. However there are breakdowns and delays every now and then. Love the simple map design that helps user to find their destination.
,,"Clean, Safe, Efficient and Cheap",5.0,,"Without a doubt Singapore's MRT system is the best way to get around the city. You never have a long wait - you have more of a wait in the queue at the ticket machines (at busy stops or in rush hours). It's so easy to navigate, cheap, clean, safe and efficient it actually becomes fun. Always our 1st choice of transport."
,,"efficient, clean and affordable",4.0,,"For the tourist visiting singapore, you can buy a pass.I bought a 3 days pass for 30$ (it's 20$ +10 $ deposit) allowing me to go everywhere unlimited. There's a special booth where you can get it, (there was one in lavender station, and one in city hall station). But I guess the best is to ask at the counter inside any station what is the closest place where you can buy one ! Nice trip to you!"
,,The only way to move aroubd,5.0,,Buy yourself a travel card it costs $12 and included $7 travel then you can access busses and MTR. You will only pay the fare for your journey and can top it up anytime. A standard ticket costs $2 and you can only use it once and then top it up with journeys which will end up costing more. You can surrender the card and have the deposit refunded so it’s the cheapest way to ride the MTR. Which is the most efficient transport system I have seen.
,,"Fast , clean, efficient rail system",5.0,,Immaculate Rail system that is symbolic of Singapore’s efficiency and cleanliness. A train arrives at most city stations every 3-5 minutes. Only short distances to cover between many stations and the Elink stored value travel cards work effectively. Most trips cost around $SG1 so you get great value for your tourist dollar.
,,A great way to visit Singapore,4.0,,MRT in Singapore is a useful and affordable way to visit the city. Safe clean are the keywords t I describe public transportation in Singapore.
,,Traveling during off-pick hours,4.0,,"Got the chance to travel from east to west on old line, and then from east to north on the new line within one day. Cabins were half filled and aircon in cabin that I traveled was strong. Ride was smooth. Passengers well behaved and quietly playing with cell phone. Outside quite scenic and green whenever train above ground. Pleasant leisurely rides when not crowded!"
,,Do not eat or drink,5.0,,Really grate idea to forbidden food and drinks which makes it one of the cleanest metro I've ever seen.
,,World standard,5.0,,"The MRT is fantastic and cheap way to get around Singapore. Immaculate, on time most of the time, convenient."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"This has to be the best way to get around Singapore, cheap, clean and air conditioned. Just remember to only stand on the left while on the escalator."
,,Holiday by MRT,4.0,,"Enjoyable journey by enjoying togetherness with cheap and safe rates. Children happy on the ride MRT, can be recommended for your trip to the fore .."
,,Very Congested,2.0,,"No doubt the Singapore MRT (subway) system is more efficient than car transportation in terms of getting around the tourist/downtown area. During peak hours, it can even be quicker than taking a taxi. The route system is quite extensive and you can get to most tourist attractions in Singapore using the subway. It's also clean, safe and relatively inexpensive. On the negative side, however, be prepared for an extremely congested ride and to be packed in like sardines, especially during rush hour periods. Another negative is that special discounted fares are only available to Singapore citizens unlike in the UK or Canada, where discounted fares for children and senior citizens are open to everyone including tourists. Despite the negatives, I would recommend using the MRT subway rather than taking the taxi to do your sightseeing."
,,Works Like Clockwork. East to use,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a great way to see this amazing City.
Easy to Use especially from The Airport to Orchard Road where our Hotel was situated.
Be mindful of changing from the Red line to Green etc as it can be challenging if you not used to using this type of transport daily.

A very cost effective way to get from the Airport to your Hotel, although travelling on the train with large/many bags and children may be a challenge."
,,Best public transport system I know,5.0,,Hands down SMRT is one of the best public transport systems in the world. I have always been impressed by every improvements they made. Love the campaigns at stations and transit walks. I can get to almost every place in Singapore only by relying on SMRT.
,,This is how city travel should be,5.0,,"Brilliant, clean, reliable service. Gives a feeling of absolute security and all at very reasonable cost. We have been regular visitors for six years and the network has expanded considerably in that time. Expansion continues. Only downside is the smartphone. Years ago the young were always ready to offer a seat to the elderly or infirm. Now they just get lost in their screen and ignore them."
,,Easiest way to travel in Singapore,4.0,,"The MRT is one of the cheapest way to travel in Singapore. The MRT network is extensive, from Changi Airport to most parts of Singapore. The fare is quite affordable too, I think its less than SGD $2 from the airport to the city."
,,A great way to move about and know the local culture,4.0,,"Despite all the complaints, the MRT is still a great way to move about. It gets crowded during high peak hours. That’s why they invested in a mass people mover right? The ride is still quite comfortable and very affordable"
,,Best mrt,5.0,,I havent seen any thing of this sort ever...best network of trains and buses...all places interconnected...with directions all over the places...mrt passes for tourists...
,,Murder On The MRT Express,3.0,,"The once crowning achievement of Singapore,the underground MRT service is showing its age. Not in the rolling stock which remains pristine but in the all to frequent stoppages, delays and breakdowns not to mention awful overcrowding in peak times. Trust me, stuck in a carriage arm pit to arm pit with hundreds of fellow travellers on the morning commute is not pleasant and an increasingly frequent occurrence of late as evidenced by travellers on social media. In short it can be murder!"
,,The place to go to where it is everything and everybody else's fault.,3.0,,"A place to visit and possibly work in for deep cultural issues, but it was hardly a moving experience."
,,Excellent System,5.0,,"The subway line is extremely easy to use and figure out. On top of that, the areas are also very clean, orderly, and does not smell of urine like other subways in other countries. I think I will probably take the train from the airport when I depart since it is quite easy to use."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"After driving for a long time, it was refreshing to take the MRT, it is clean, comfortable enough, safe, and will get you from A to B faster then a car, plus you cannot beat the price. Peak hours of course can be busy, however still a whole lot better then other cities in the world. Some people complain when there is the rare case of a breakdown, but have to say that this is always handled very professionally and frankly other countries I lived in did a whole lot worse. Traveling non peak hour is best when you are able to do that. Cost is even lower. Defenitely a well run system and worth using."
,,Easy way to get arouond,5.0,,Had no trouble with the service. Easy to find which station to go to and ticket purchase and many top up machines.
,,Currently undergoing upgrading,3.0,,"Thirty year old system, built in the hope of making the country ""car-lite"". Years of severe neglect and ""deep seated cultural issues"" within the organisation has made breakdowns a near weekly occurrence.

After several embarrassing multi-day outages, they are pulling up their boots and embarking on a massive undertaking to make it great again. It's still useable, but have a plan B. Think London or New York... not Switzerland, Japan, Hong Kong."
,,Excellent,5.0,,The best way to move around the island. One of the best Metro I've ever been to. It's quite cheap and you can use the same card to other stuff like the bus or even getting into a local swimming pool. Cool ya!
,,Best public transport ever,5.0,,SMRT is very informative about schedule. The maintenance also superb. Never disappointed me. Really really best public transport.
,,Singapore MRT a great way to get around,5.0,,"Travelling by MRT from Changi Airport to downtown stations is not hard. You will have to change 1 or 2 lines depending on where you are staying. It is cheap, clean, fast, efficient and also feels safe. You can follow stations via an electronic display and also announcements in English. You can pay by trip through choosing the station endpoint and it will show how much to put into the machine. It is in English too. You can also obtain day passes and multiday passes but they are not always available at every station. Major ones like Chinatown have manned kiosks where you can get such passes."
,,Efficient,4.0,,It's easy and all the lines are connected at multiple transit stations. Would be great if this could be connected with bus routes to specific locations too using one time payment because I almost lose both my legs walking. wish the bus routes are clearer.
,,Singapore's SMRT train,5.0,,"Singapore subway line is the most efficient and competent mode of transportation in Singapore. It is time, safe and super clean train. It goes practically all locations, both urban and suburbs. Anywhere in Singapore is never too far . It is just SMRT + or - a 10 min walk and most oftenly you need not walk. Yes, you are right, this is best around the region. I am super satisfied and thankful to the team who mend the station, train and its network. Certainly a delight to travel in Singapore!"
,,Easy & great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a quick, clean & easy way to get around Singapore for sightseeing the city. All the Interchange Points are clearly marked & lots of signage at the stations to help travelers navigate to next connecting line.

I would recommend Travellers to avoid peak periods when workers are using the system to get To & From work, as the trains & stations can get very congested.

It's a very economical way to travel around Singapore City"
,,A wonderful system,5.0,,"It's clean, both trains and stations, the trains are very frequent and punctual and it is excellent value. There seems to be an MRT station pretty much near everywhere you want to be. Excellent."
,,"Affordable, World class, Super efficient",5.0,,"Like everything else in Singapore, the MRT is ever new and vibrant. Efficient and on the dot, I prefer going by MRT and saving my cab fare these days. Even lost my handbag with money and documents in it, maybe three months ago. I just had to notify the Staff in the Customer Care counter , he immediately alerted his colleagues and lo! My bag was traced in two stations next to mine.
I have no words to thank them. He said I was lucky to have found it, but somehow my faith in SMRT and the people of Sg was very strong , I knew I would find it."
,,"Fast, clean & efficient",5.0,,"Once you get the hang of which line you need to be on and in which direction, it's sooo simple. Most stations are near, or short walking distance, to most of the major attractions and areas.
Clean and efficient for sure. We bought tickets as we needed them but if you plan to use the MRT for getting around buy a pass or bulk tickets and save money."
,,Good underground system,4.0,,Clean efficient and well worth using. Also cheaper and quicker than using a taxi. Took a bit of time to understand the map though.
,,Great way to travel around,5.0,,"Very easy and cheap (especially off-peak) way to get to where you need to go in Singapore (including to/from Changi Airport). Clean, safe, and you never have to wait long for the next train to arrive."
,,My son first ride,5.0,,He enjoyed it as many as other kids enjoyed their first ride. He was scared at first to sit alone but after 2 stations (after red hill) he enjoyed the scenery.
,,Super convenient,4.0,,"Don't go for 7am,12pm and 6-7pm,it will be super crowded. But it really makes your life easier and train comes around 5 min."
,,Convenient Cost effective and easy,4.0,,Singapore MRT is the most Convenient Cost effective and easy transport mode in the country. Where ever you want to go around the country you can use this service. Only negative on this is no service mid night to 5am.
,,The best in the world,5.0,,"Standard price tickets for 5 of us were more expensive than taking a taxi, but we used a couple of times and it was fantastic."
,,Smrt train ride,5.0,,Very convenient especially going to the city as parking is expensive. The mrt has access to all the shopping centre. The fare is cheap. For tourist with luggage lifts are available every level very friendly. Signage is very clear. Very easy to navigate. Very straightforward.
,,Great public transport,5.0,,"Best public transport system I have come across. Everything is very well set out, cheap and easy to understand."
,,Smooth sailing to airport!,4.0,,"Using new Downtown East line from MacPherson station to Expo, then change to Green Line to Changi airport."
,,Shameful SMRT! Most Unreliable transportation system in Singapore,2.0,,"The year 2017 has been very chaotic for SMRT facing failure after failure, train faults, train accidents (although few but unheard of in a country known by many for its efficiency), constant delays of up to few hours for the commuters...
Taking the train used to be convenient and fast. It is a pity as the network is now providing a good coverage, the stations are clean and safe but the trains are just too unreliable.
I would not advise taking it if you have important meetings until Singapore government, SMRT and LTA fix their issues for good, which may take another year.
Although buses are provided as an alternative, the disruption and inconvenience to passengers is tremendous. Bad service and poor foresight from the government that did not anticipate the growth of its population taking public transportation and the traffic flow well enough when it developed its train network. And now angry commuters have to pay the price for those mistakes. Hopefully measures and fixes are starting to show and situation will improve in 2018."
,,We were visiting family in Singapore,5.0,,The MRT system in Singapore is second to none for speed and safety. It is worth getting an MRT card and travelling around rather than taxis.
,,Quality deterioting,2.0,,The transport authority has been looking at the hiccups suffered by smrt. Opening hours are affected by longer maintenance times allocated to improve the train rides. Train are a farcry from achieving standards of Japan. Affordable transport but dont expect timely travelling time.
,,Quick and cheap,5.0,,"SMRT is a public service transport covering undergrounds and buses, even additional taxis. The Review will be on the public part. There is a lot of complaining from the locals, but announcement systems in multiple languages, timed arrival times and easy access are a real treat to many tourist. Buy an card (can be topped up at the station), and walk in. For a few cents, travel through singapore and with the newer blue and orange line, undergrounds bring you around...if not stopping at the place you like to visit, there is probably a bus going. The people working at the stations are very helpful and can give you tips on best connections and travel times (if you do not download one of the apps that can tell you the same). Mostly on time, safe (both stations and the travel itself) and friendly service are great for especially travelers on a budget."
,,Singapore Metro,5.0,,"Extremely well done! The stations are very clean and well laid out. It is very easy to navigate around the City using the MET. It is also very inexpensive to use. If you are staying for a few days, highly recommend purchasing a multi use pass. Over all less expensive and not have to purchase one way tickets each time you travel."
,,Transport,3.0,,Easy way to get around in Singapore especially during peak hours . Of course it be good if there is shelter to bus stands.
,,"affordable, clean, efficient",5.0,,"SMRT is one of the best metro rail systems we have used, it is very efficient and regular. The cleanliness on the trains and in the stations is exemplary, it is a pleasure to travel. There are stations everywhere, wherever you need to be, and it is very affordable."
,,Particularly good value for money - if you are a retiree !,5.0,,"Clean , on time and runs efficiently - this is afterall Singapore and her MRT system is all of that and more .

For retirees ( 55 and above) walking to and from the stations has the added bonus of easing our health conscience since we get to exercise .

Best of all , being retirees , the fares are low ..

So now we can be a tourist in our own country ..just follow the MRT - hop on and hop off !"
,,Average-level MRT ride,3.0,,"It used to be something we were very proud of - the MRT being a reliable, clean, safe, inexpensive & pleasant way to get around Singapore. This is not the case now. Rides during off-peak periods can be quite pleasant; not so during peak periods. The frequency of train disruptions has also tarnished its reputation as a reliable mode of transport. Esp when it is touted as a mass transit in a developed country; obviously, commuter expectations are high. A lot of sustained improvement in train reliability is needed to restore public confidence in the MRT."
,,Lack of maintenance.,1.0,,"Breaks down every other day. Signal faults, track faults, etc... Tons of excuses...sigh.... Adding to the overcrowding peak hours, I'd try to avoid taking it...."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"Smrt is very accessible to all the places you want to visit, attractions, Parks and museum. Its value for money. Most of the stations are Link to the mall."
,,One of the best in the world!,5.0,,"Fast, Efficient, Inexpensive, Frequent and regular Clean Safe Reliable What’s not to like? It’s simply great and I take it all the time. The only improvement would be more capacity. Trains tend to be very full most of the time and especially during rush hour."
,,The Best,5.0,,"By far, the best transit system in the world. With the expansions coming online, you can access almost anywhere in Singapore by train. Very convenient & bus connections are a snap."
,,"Cheap, fast and reliable.",5.0,,"The best transport system I have ever experienced, trains every few minutes for peanuts. Very easy to use, very clean. Perfect"
,,Convenient Travelling,4.0,,SMRT is fast to get to your destination. If you miss the train its fine you do not have to wait long as the next one will come within 5 minutes. Its inexpensive compared to the subway in other countries.
,,Not bad,3.0,,Mrt stopped a few times but journey was pretty fast .The aircon was faulty and was really warm for me and my Family
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Having been in a lot of public transport systems (Boston, NYC, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul, Beijing, etc.), Singapore sets the bar for everyone else.

It’s not just the trains but also the bus system. Make sure to use Google Maps or various official apps to see when the next bus is coming - quite accurate.

If here for more than a couple days, absolutely get a card and load it.

If nothing else, it’s even a cheap way to ride out to Jurong East and further to see the ‘heartland’. There’s a good roti prata shop at Pioneer if get that far.

It’s a good thing too given how expensive cars are here."
,,"Clean, on-time and inexpensive",5.0,,"I've traveled around the world and have experienced mass transit in many countries. Singapore is clearly at the top of the list. Convenient, Clean, Safe and Always On-Time! Between the trains and buses there are few places on the island that you cannot reach. And if there is one you can easily find a cab. No need for a car here!!"
,,Best transit system of the world,5.0,,Singapore has best transport system in the world. The direction are clear. Instructions are given in English and Chinese. Stations are well equipped to handle special needs.

,,Fast and comfortable,5.0,,It may be the best train systems on the world.We always take this train when we visit any places in Singapore because it is cheap and comfortable.The underground is a different world of Singapore.We really like to use this service.
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"The MRT routes are well planned as one can reach anywhere in Singapore via SMRT. The train comes on time and I barely wait for more than 5 minutes for the next train to come. Since I'm bringing an elder, there is always someone giving up seat for her."
,,Took the Train to and From Airport,5.0,,"The train was easy to access from the Changi airport, just follow the signs. We got cash from the ATM so we had local money to buy tickets. They seem to have employees at the airport location that assist you with using the tickets machines. Guess they know most of the visitors are first timers. The schedule is very easy to understand and of course we were not the only ones boarding with luggage."
,,Absolutely fantastic experience on MRT. Especially with the new downtown line which brings you to Little India fast.,5.0,,"Singapore SMRT is one of the world's best. Most developed countries, particularly the US, could learn a lesson or two from Singapore. System is very efficient, clean and affordable. The elevators all work and the signs are very clear. Hats off to the SMRT. I enjoy visiting Singapore and taking the SMRT. Heard they are building two more lines underground. Not sure how they do it but the whole system is incredible."
,,Best in the world ???,5.0,,"Have used the MRT on many occasions on previous trips to Singapore as it is inexpensive, clean (very), reliable and virtually takes you anywhere that you may want to be or visit in Singapore.
Once you get a hang of it, it is so easy to use and the staff are both friendly and helpful.
If only Brisbane had a similar service !"
,,Great work,5.0,,"I really cannot complain about the MRT here because for me Singapore MRT is the best so far (compared to Australia and Japan). Thank you SMRT, keep up the good work!"
,,Transport for London and UK government could learn a lot.,5.0,,Travelling off peak is much cheaper and one can see why it is so useful in getting around town. The new on board displays even show one how to exit the stations. If you want people to use public transport this is the way to do it. Inexpensive but efficient.
,,Clean Easy Fast,5.0,,Simply the best way to get around Singapore. Totally impressed with the MTR system .. even during Peak hour ... my one grumble ... people who stand on the 'walkalator' and escalator ... seriously ... you can't walk a few steps Singapore???
,,Only cash!!!,3.0,,"The subway system works pretty well. My only concern is related to the fact that standard tickets can only be bought from the vending machines that only take cash (neither credit or debit cards are accepted). I found this unbelievable and very inconvenient for foreign travelers, this never happened to me."
,,FAST,5.0,,Singapore smrt is a really reliable and cost saving transport system. One can reach the main attractions very easily on time.
,,Easy to use!!!,5.0,,Easy way to get around Singapore. Clean and quick. We used the Singapore tourist pass to get on and off MRT and buses to see all the sights.

,,Brilliant transport option,5.0,,"Just the easiest way to get around Singapore! Used it from changi airport to bugis with bags and was easy! Very quick, very cheap, very clean, and rarely have to wait more than a few minutes for the next train.
Other capital cities could learn a thing or two from the Singapore MRT system!"
,,SMRT,5.0,,"Singapore tube system is fantastic,quick,on time, super clean and easy to use. we had visitor tickets which make it even easier as once bought you dont need cash for tickets.
I felt totally safe and the people are very courteous instantly giving my wife a seat because she uses a walking stick.
Everybody obeys the no smoking no eating and drinking rules and it was a pleasure to travel."
,,Excellent and cheap,5.0,,"A very efficient and clean ad safe pubic transit system. We used to go to many places often interchanging with buses and trains, the staff are very helpful and always help with a smile. All buses and trains were very clean and on time. Great service."
,,Great transport.,5.0,,Easy and inexpensive to use with the added bonus of some excellent restaurants and shopping experiences.
,,SMRT,5.0,,"Lately,the smrt kept breaking down but luckly I did not get caught by the smrt.But usually the smrt is fast.You can reach your destination very fast.If you are disabled or you have a baby stroller the smrt provides a place for you."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"This probably ranks as o e do the most efficient Mass Rapid Transistor systems in the world. Well-maintained, on time and clean."
,,So Easy,5.0,,"This really is a simple system to use and if you get stuck people will help you. I was impressed with a young guy who asked someone to stand when he saw I was using a cane. Trains are frequent and on-time. They are clean and give good information about upcoming stations etc. Best way to travel around Singapore. Buy tourist pass for 1 day ($10S), 2 ($16s) etc. each day renews at 12pm. Allows you on buses as well- unlimited use. Or you can pay as you go."
,,Easy to use,4.0,,"Used a number of times, easy to use and so cheap. Always on time, clean and staff very obliging and friendly."
,,So easy,5.0,,Cleanest and easiest to use underground ever been on. Everything in English so buying tickets so easy and lines easy to understand and cheap and quick
,,Grat way to travel,5.0,,A cheap efficient and safe way to travel in Singapore. Got us close to most places we needed to get to.
,,Very easy to use.,4.0,,"I explored the wider areas around central Singapore with the 3 day tourist pass. As the the tube travels through stations, the stops light up on the wall maps so that you always know where you are. An electronic display illustrates the layout of each station as the tube approaches so you can easily find your exit."
,,Beats virtually any other system in the world,4.0,,"Entropy is taking effect with signal failures, train cancellations, failures of doors to line up BUT still one of the best ways to get around the island. The cashless system is fantastic. Well signed, good islandwide system. Even their buses are a pleasure to use (except the number 36 which is always overloaded)"
,,The best transportation,5.0,,"Everytime i go i will choose to take smrt, easy for me to get everywhere without lost my way. So many old and new route make me easy to go everywhere. Love it so much."

,,Reliable and Fast,5.0,,"I don't think you will find a more efficient and easy subway system anywhere in the world. It's easy to use and most lines have trains running every 3 to 5 minutes.
However, be prepared to do some walking. Some stations require you to walk quite a way to transfer from one line to another."
,,"Quick, easy and airconditioned!",5.0,,"We were amazed at how well-run, clean, easy and COOL the mrt is in Singapore, we went everywhere on it, quickly and easily, and would highly recommend it! We used the tourist pass (we got ours from Chinatown station ticket office), it cost $30 each for 3 days of unlimited travel, and you get $10 back when you return the card. Or you can pay as you go, or get an E-Z card and add money to that. The routes are well-sign posted and easy to follow, and the voice on the train (wishing you ""go happy happy as you board the platform"" was lovely to hear! I travelled on my own at times and felt very safe and comfortable, not something I can always say in Perth! Australia could take some pointers from the Singaporean people on how to do things well, in my opinion. Wonderful service."
,,Good and clean,4.0,,Great MRT experience throughout my visit in Singapore. So far no bad experience. Trains were clean and proper. The most spacious trains I've ever taken compared to trains in other countries.

,,The best subway service in the world,5.0,,The trains are very clean and smells fresh. The routes are very simple that even first-timers are going to find it very easy to ride. The frequency of the departure is very good given that each departures are only 2-5 minutes away from the other on every route.

,,Easy to use!,5.0,,"I was a visitor to Singapore and used the MRT daily to make my journeys. I was given a map from an information point and used a loaded card to pay for my journeys. It was simple. Every station is clearly signposted and named and the map was simple to read. I've used similar systems in New York, London and Japan and this has been by far the most easy to use. It was clean and even when it was crowded during peak times, it was never too hot. People regularly gave up their seats for the elderly or those with children, and it was just an all round pleasant way to travel."
,,"Cheap, clean, Omni present",5.0,,"Goes where you need to go. Clean, comes every few minutes. Very inexpensive. Could be a little faster."
,,"Easy, Fast and Efficient",5.0,,Takes you everywhere fast and easy. Totally recommend :) It is new and very easy to understand. You don't need to worry about transportation in Singapore!
,,Local transpore,4.0,,"Like all underground, tube in other part of the world.
A very local public transportation system.
Notable is the not eating(I can understand) and no drinking (what?) rules. But well Japan have a not phone taking rule so I assume this is not so bad. Train time lost to Taiwan n Japan, especially recent year of fail management.
But cleaniness and service are still the top compare with most country (UK, US n Eu can just give up in this ranking haha)"
,,Fast and reliable,5.0,,"Mostly right on time, cheap, easy to understand the map. And may officers to ask if you get lost. Toilets are everywhere too. And many shops that sell foods and drinks along the way. Also lifts for elderly. What a friendly MRT for senior residents."
,,Brilliant connectivity !,4.0,,Just get an MRT card and you are sorted for traveling around Singapore !! The connectivity is brilliant and one can visit all major attractions of the city . Its also the fastest mode of transportation around the city . If you're a tourist this is the best mode of transport for you too .there are maps of local area also for better sense of direction .
,,Tourists: Get a tourist pass at an MRT station.,5.0,,"The Singapore mass transit system is perhaps the best I have used in the world. Clean, efficient, spacious, easy to use. Makes getting round the great city of Singapore really simple.

For tourists I can very much recommend getting a tourist pass. These are 1-3 day passes that get you unlimited travel for the duration of the pass. If you are coming into Singapore from Changi Airport there is a kiosk where you can buy one at the MRT station in T2."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"I'm definitely jealous of the SMRT system in Singapore. It's super efficient, accessible and reliable. It's easy to understand and the maps aren't confusing! Best way to get around Singapore!"
,,MRT makes visiting Singapore's ICONIC sights easy!,4.0,,"Singapore's MRT is efficient, clean, safe and trains are always arriving. ALL major sights can be easily reached using the MRT.
For visitors, there are two ways to use the MRT - either buy a day pass or regular visitors to Singapore can pay a deposit and obtain a pass which can be topped up with cash as needed. The deposit will be refunded once the pass is returned to the KIOSK in most terminals.
MRT is more efficient, faster and cheaper than Taxis."
,,One of the best,5.0,,Singapore MRT system is probably one of the easiest to understand. You can get an MRT map in the stations and even download their mrt map on your phone.
,,Wish such systems exist everywhere,5.0,,WOW...What a great creation & connection created by Singaporeans. It was great not only for locals but to all tourists as well. Travelling has been made so simple by MRTs
,,A Very Efficient System,5.0,,"It is a very efficient, clean and well organised service. Obviously crowded during rush hour time, but as a tourist do not always need to go then. As we visit Singapore a lot to see family we use a refillable eCard. There are just great as they work on the buses as well."
,,Fantastic system,5.0,,"I wish we had a system as good as this in Australia. The MRT was fast, easy to use and absolutely pristine. No signs of vandalism or misbehaviour. When we first arrived we weren`t sure about using the MRT to travel but after the first day we purchased 3 day tourist cards and used the system almost exclusively to maximise the amount of time we could spend visiting places. Highly recommended"
,,Efficient clean superb,5.0,,Even in rush hour it felt calm although busy. The trains all came on time on all the lines through the one week I was there. If only all city metros were as clean efficient and cheap.
,,Have to use the SMRT to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"My son first impression was that Singapore is exactly like in Hong Kong, including the MRT. We decided to purchase the $5 eazy value store card than the 3 days tourist card. We also found out that it is cheaper by using the eazy value store card than purchase a single ticket each time for each journey. Singapore is so small and my son did a 3 km walk back to our hotel one morning after clubbing. He enjoyed the 4.00 am walk and we felt safe that he was in Singapore."
,,MRT Travel,5.0,,"MRT is fast, efficient and user friendly. The map is fairly easy, there are also apps which make it easy to figure out your route. Flows well, very organised."
,,Efficient transport system,5.0,,"Rail service is excellent, easy to understand, good service, stations and trains are very clean. Did not succeed in paying with my credit card and the machines only accept small bills."
,,Easiest and cheapest way to roam around singapore,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is very much user friendly.
Tourist friendly travel cards (for unlimited use for 1-3 days) can be purchased at airport counters.These cards are even applicable for bus services.
Another way is to purchase MRT/Ez card at the MRT station in the basement of changi airport and top up based on requirement.
The instructions and maps are well displayed in all MRT stations and within the metro trains.
Kudos to Singapore government for their work in further increasing MRT network throughout the country."
,,Vacation,5.0,,"Still one of the most efficient way to go around Singapore.
Suggestion...perhaps a picture display of where the location / station is situated because some people might be difficult to digest the places if they don't had visual on exit and in the train (aside of the station name)..all sign is mostly usefull for locals."
,,If you don’t like walking the only way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"It’s modern it’s clean, it feels safe and it’s cheap. It’s like London’s underground but 10 times better for short journeys.
Walking is probably better but the heat and humidity make the MRT a very good alternative for moving around Singapore especially if you are avoiding the afternoon thunderstorms.

Make sure you have change the machines wont take anything above 5s$"
,,Efficient and good value,5.0,,"The SMRT is a clean and efficient way to travel around Singapore. You may need to switch lines occasionally but the regular services mean this is not an issue. We supplemented SMRT with occasional taxi and bus, but were glad to use the service"
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"The rail service was excellent. Although it didn't travel at night, it was by far the most effective mode of transportation."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"They come often, are easy to navigate, and have great signage when you get to the station. Super clean."
,,Great system,4.0,,Used their rail system everyday we were there. Extremely efficient and relatively easy to navigate. Friendly locals usually willing to help if confused.

,,Excellent train service,5.0,,"Although we had used the train before and knew its quality, it was good to see it had not changed. Great frequency, clean and economic to use. We only had to make a few trips on one day so we bought individual trip tickets rather than the day ticket."
,,Travelling make easy,4.0,,"Best way for tourists to visit and travel around our county. Easy to understand map, English speaking staff on duty to help. If you plan to stay here for a few days and to travel around the country on public transport, it will be best to get a stored value card which allow access on trains and buses"
,,One of teh best train systems in the world,5.0,,"Very clean and easy to use, plus secure. A great system that covers the entire island. Just note that it is not 24 hour and closes for a few hours after midnight."
,,Easy For Dummies,5.0,,I came to Singapore for 10 days and chose to ride a lot on the MRT. My hostal was close to the Northeast Line. I rode to somewhere every day without any screwups. You can buy the card for all busses and the MRT in any Seven Eleven but you must be at least 18 years old. Ha! There is no eating or drinking in the cars or anywhere in the tubes. This is the logical and direct way to have a CLEAN system. I loved the air conditioning. Help was always near if I had a question. You want to go to the Botanic Gardens? The entrance is less than 50 feet from the end of the MRT exit. The MRT was a big positive for my happiness with my trip to Singapore.
,,MRT,5.0,,The best and the cheapest way to travel in Singapore is through mrt. Once u buy a card n add 10 sgd minimum u can travel within singapore without anybody’s help. The same card can be used even in bus too. The app of mrt is offline n can be used anywhere after downloading it. It is great fun to travel on mrt with locals. No eating n drinking water even in the stations r in the train. U feel so much independent to travel in there. Enjoy the rides.
,,Quick and simple way to access Singapore,5.0,,"This is by far the easiest way to get around Singapore get the MRT map from your hotel and your away, buy the Singapore EZ card it lasts forever so you can use it when you come back to Singapore, it has a small user fee but its still better than the tourist travel card which is only valid for the amount of days you put on it, the MRT is cheap travel so the tourist card will have balance which expires which you will lose ?"
,,Be careful,3.0,,"Comfortable and clean, with professional staff. However, take note of the frequent breakdowns which have been happening recently."
,,"Easy, Efficient and Cheap way to travel",5.0,,Certainly one of the best public transport systems in the world. The SMRT is very useful in connecting parts of Singapore. It is also very efficient and a cheap way to travel compared to taking a private vehicle. The stations are very clean and can be used by literally anyone.
,,"easy to use, friendly and helpful staff at every station to help you out",5.0,,"We took Downtown Line (blue line) between the airport and Bayfront (direct access to Gardens by the Bay). It is really easy to use the system: just go to any ticket machines and their friendly staff will guide you through the ticket purchasing process. They also give you maps and tell you how to get around.
Great fast way if you are in a hurry :) The blue line is underground (I am not sure about the others), so if you want to see the city, choose something else."
,,A great way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"To get around Singapore, quickly and cheaply, the train is the only way to go. Ticketing is easy and helpful vending machines make it OK for people of most major language groups. The signage is good, not only to get in and out, but to find the right platform. Sometimes the walk when changing trains is a bit long but OK. The fact that there is a wall along the platform with sliding doors that open exactly where the train door is, makes it very safe to enter and leave the carriage. Try it and you'll like it."
,,Fast economical travel in Singapore,4.0,,"I used the SMRT (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit) extensively during my stay in Singapore. The trains are always on schedule, and changes at junctions are synchronized so you don't have to wait to transfer to another line.
While cabs can be stuck in traffic during rush-hour, trains are an effective way to reach your destination rapidly.
If you plan to be there a few days, you may want to consider getting a re-useable pre-paid card. It will be cheaper and saves time in having to purchase a ticket for each journey."
,,Can British Transport Admins Come and Check This Out?,5.0,,"Best way to get around. £3.60 return pp from the north of the city centre to the cable car station right at the southern tip. Quick, clean, efficient: fantastic."
,,Easy way to travel Singapore,5.0,,"Simple to use, cheap to ride, this is the best way to get around Singapore. It is great to be in a city that, due to its size, have embraced public transport. The best thing is this transport system is efficient, quick and clean. If you do not know what your doing a person at the station or a local is always willing to help."
,,easy and efficient,5.0,,We found the MRT very easy to use and so clean and efficient. I beleive they are adding stations to it so should reach more places eventually. Great for getting a feel of the city.
,,Great easy travel,5.0,,Getting around Singapore city was so easy on the MRT. we managed to go through a number of standard tickets which were very easy to buy and add trips - you just need change ( they do not give more than $4 of change) very clean and easy to follow directions
,,Singapore rail system,5.0,,"Easy to use, cheap 3 day singapore pass only $20 for unlimited travel on trains and buses. Excellent way to travel around the city."
,,exceptional!,5.0,,"wow wow wow.
the pricing, cleanliness, staff and quality of transport were pure pleasure. We were surprised at the ease of finding our travel destinations, ticketing process and ability to have ease of access.
We totally enjoyed our experiences on the MRT and highly recommend it as a way to get around the city."
,,Clean and reliable way to get around,4.0,,"Clean, safe and reliable way to get around Singapore, it is now has a comprehensive network which covers pretty much all of Singapore. A trip from Changi airport to downtown costs only S$ 2.50, a significant saving as compared to a taxi. Multiple use cards are available from S$12 which can be topped up as required, and which also give discounted journeys (30% ??)."
,,Smart Transportation,5.0,,"If you want to travel around Singapore with the quickest, fast, relatively safe, reliable and cheap transportation, then SMRT is the right choice. SMRT covered almost all point in Singapore connecting or exit point. The only disadvantage is that you can't memorize Singapore's road because all the time you go underground but that is alright if your transportation makes you more comfortable, effective and efficient."
,,Not sure why this makes Trip Advisor?,5.0,,"Singaporeans consistently complain about their SMRT but to be honest, it is clean, not too overcrowded and almost always runs on time. While not perfect, compared to other transport services worldwide SMRT is bliss."
,,Super efficient!,5.0,,"Get a 1, 2 or 3 day pass and enjoy moving in Singapore! It's cheap and easy! We had strollers and there were elevators in every station. Also toilets are very nice and clean."

,,SO SMART!!!,5.0,,"The train system in Singapore is impressive It is very clean, organized and the trip price varies depending on your route which makes sense. There is no eating, drinking or gum chewing allowed."
,,"Friendly, Fast and Fun",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is very user friendly. Purchase an EZ Link card for $5 then add credit to the card. I added $17 which lasted me two weeks with some credit still on the card! Trips are very cheap usually between $0:77 and $1.87! Awesome! Signage is very clear and there is a great App for working out your trips. For such a small island there are a lot of MRT stations. MRT from the Marina Bay Sands to Changi Airport is only $1.69. Give it a go, you won’t regret it :)"
,,Pleasure to travel,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a pleasure to travel... very good directions, help of marshals where ever needed,well kept schedules ... all positives"
,,Easy cheap travel,5.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore. We bought tickets as needed from machines following colour coded line maps. Easy, but should have chosen 3 day pass and travelled whenever and wherever we wanted. Would have been more cost effective for us, but still cheap. Ask for help so you get the right choice for you. Often a person can help you at the ticket machines or at the information counters. Once u get the hang of it, very convenient to get around Singapore. Trains on time, quick, clean and cheap. No eating on trains and no graffiti. Wish we had this in Melbourne Victoria!"
,,Child Friendly,5.0,,SMRT is very convenient. Stroller accessibility is amazing. You can definitely travel with your toddler just using the SMRT. The timeliness and cleanliness of the trains is just truly fascinating.
,,Easy way to get around,5.0,,"Best to get an EZ link card and use for buses and train, this card lasts 5 years and is better than a tourist pass."
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"Love travelling in Singapore on this great service - clean, reliable, quick, easily signed incl English and reasonably priced.

We bought the 2 day Tourist Pass for $26 with $10 refunded when ticket handed back fr unlimited travel. A shame though that the tickets can't be bought at all stations, nor returned for your deposit - we had to buy a ticket to get to a station to buy the 2 day ticket.

Multiple train lines that cover most of the city, with numerous connection points to allow you to change lines wth ease.

The stations can be large & a bit of travelling from one line to another but the overhead signs make it fairly simple to use. Escalators are available, with many elevators also. Noted that the gaps between the platform and the trian is small, expecially where designated for 'wheelchairs'."
,,Great public transport,5.0,,"Safe, efficient, clean, and easy to navigate around the city and beyond. We used the 3 day Singapore Tourist Pass (order online and pick up from Changi Airport after you pass through customs). Would like to mention how helpful the Singaporeans are if it appears you aren't quite sure of which line to catch."
,,Very Efficient System.,5.0,,"Well run easy to navigate. Convenient, goes everywhere (except zoo). Reasonably priced. Even can take it from airport. Also good to ask which exit will get where you need to go, since exits on a stop can be spaced far apart."
,,The only way to travel around the city,5.0,,"Clean, air conditioned, on time, driverless and easy way to cheaply travel around the city. Transport For London please visit and learn!"
,,The quickest and most convenient mode of travel,5.0,,"We have used the MRT all the time in Singapore by using the Singapore Tourist Pass. It was a really bold choice, with convenient, reliable & fast travel mode coupled with bus services. Very well organized, guided directions with route maps and transit locations; very useful as tourist."
,,Just what's needed to get around,5.0,,"I bought a 3 day tourist pass for $30, with a $10 refund when handing back the card. This really is the best way of getting around. The trains are roomy and easily let you know which stops are coming up, and also with good maps inside the carriage."
,,Easily THE best MRT system I've been on,4.0,,"It seems weird to review a transport system, but, like others on here, I just feel that I should have my say...

I try to avoid the MRT systems in places like Guangzhou, Hong Kong, even the London Underground, they're just so overcrowded, even though they are arguably faster than other modes of transport to get around.

However, not being familiar with bus routes and the geography of Singapore, we had to bite the bullet and take the MRT... What a pleasant surprise that turned out to be.

It was NEVER crowded, and we travelled both peak and off-peak. I overheard one couple talking about how crowded the carriage was. WHAT? We were all freely able to move around, without bumping into someone else, in Guangzhou, you're usually face deep breathing in someone's armpit fumes. The lack of crowding was just glorious, both on the trains and on the platforms.

Also, the MRT was THE cleanest trains I have been on. Then again, Singapore was eerily clean in general. Best of all? It was cheap, a like for like journey here on my local system (Metro - Nexus Tyne and Wear) would cost £4.60, in Singapore, it was approximately, less than half that.

Clean, cheap, fast, and no overcrowding. This is how MRT's are meant to be."
,,Good connectivity,5.0,,Please look at the signboards for stations at bus stations if you are outsider like me .Very good internal connectivity
,,"Clean, safe, on-time and very good value",5.0,,"I arranged to meet with Chinese friends that I hadn't seen for nearly 30 years, in Chinatown on the day I flew in from London. After a 13 hour flight, great with Singapore Airlines, I washed and brushed up in the Village Hotel, then plunged straight in to the public transport system here. Firstly catching a no.29 from Changi village, disembarking at Tampines Central bus station, then a short covered walk to the entrance, someway down, to the Downtown line on the Mass Railway Transport (MRT). The experience was frankly awesome, with fast, punctual, clean and safe trains which everyday carry several Singaporean millions to work, schools, shops and play, back and forth without any incident or nonsense. I was astonished to see there were no drivers, no guards and no bother, with each Bombadier-designed and built train controlled electronically. Passengers embarked and disembarked without any problem, and each carriage was open to view, without internal doors, allowing for visual supervision from one end of the train to the other. On time, and at the appointed hour, I emerged to make my rendevous, whilst reminded of the years of strikes and strife on Southern Rail over the discussions with the rail unions over taking just the guards with their little whistles off the commuter trains into London, let alone the drivers! Boy have we got something to learn!"
,,Super clean and very extensive,5.0,,Get the plastic travelcard if staying 4 or more days. Very inexpensive so only put on S$10. The aids are super helpful so ask...sometimes the shortest route is not the quickest. Felt very safe at all times of the day/night.
,,"Efficient, cheap, easy to use system",4.0,,"Didn’t bother buying the 2 day pass which seemed not to be good value if all you wanted to do is pop on and off for short trips at 1 dollar 40 cents a time. Never waited more than a couple of minutes for a train, fast, clean, excellent, puts the London tube to shame."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Reliable,fast and economical ! Can be very busy at times and the stations are huge and can be a bit confusing if in a hurry but persevere it's worth it . Loved the hustle and bustle of it . A must try if visiting Singapore"
,,Clean and easy to use,5.0,,Clean and easy to use. Air conditioned and very well kept up. Even buying tickets was easy. (Just don't try to use a S$10 bill - have small change or coins for purchase)
,,Very efficient and good.,5.0,,The Singapore MRTS is very good. Though the lines were less in comparison to Delhi MRTS. The quality of trains and the punctuality of the trains were on the dot. The best part being the connectivity to all the shopping areas of singapore through this MRTS. Must use in SPR>
,,Zooming buggies,5.0,,Singapore mrt are excellent. That have been built keeping breadth and length of Singapore in mind.Also engineering marvel. Driver less trains. The frequency of trains. Size of station and moving platforms at station fasten the travel between trains. Malls and shops in station are excellent.
,,Nice communication by SMRT,5.0,,Very convenient n cheap means of communication in Singapore .. Almost every route are well connected by smrt n much cheaper n convenient than the bus n taxi🙂
,,Not so fantastic.,2.0,,Ride on the train almost every week. The ride is getting from bad to worst. Train is super crowded. Need to wait for a few trains before I can board.
,,Best system to date,5.0,,"This system is by far the most efficient, clean and cost effektive I have travelhed on. Recommend the 3 day pass for short term visitirs in Singapore."
,,Clean and big,4.0,,SMRT is a good way to explore the city. You can reach almost anywhere by entering a station and check the map of all the lines which are colour coded. The best way is to buy a Tourist Pass which lasts for three days for $30 ( get $10 back if return within 5 days after expired). Then you can travel on SMRT and bus and some train and ferry like the locals by tapping the card. If you use the pass 4 or more times a day it is better and cheaper than buying tickets from the machine every time. All except 1 or 2 stations are very big and you have to walk quite a distance when changing lines. Therefore you will find almost all passengers are young people. The signages are very good and clear and everywhere. We had no problem finding our destination even it was the first time we were there. Moreover the Singapore people are very helpful. One young lady stopped when we asked the way and used her phone to help us. All in all it was a very pleasant experience to explore the city with SMRT. I highly recommend it.
,,excellent,5.0,,If you go to Singapore the most useful transit mean is smrt.Very obvious map and easy to use and access stations and also cheap in comparison to taxi
,,Very easy to use and convenient,4.0,,"I travelled on the MRT from Chinatown to Bay front and found it very easy to get around. the most difficult was working the ticket machine, but thankfully someone was on hand to help. It is very clean and safe and I had no fears about travelling on my own. When I reached my destination it was well marked out to find the Gardens by the Bay. It was also inexpensive. A good way to get around Singapore."
,,BART - San Francisco Should Take Lessons,4.0,,"Well run system, among the best in the world. Trains run often, are clean, relatively quiet and well laid out. Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is due to congestion and the apparent inability to buy a multi day or multi trip pass at the machines--one has to line up at a counter."
,,Who needs a car (or even Uber) when train system is this good,5.0,,"Suffice to say Singapore's SMRT network is the very best way to navigate Singapore. Going to all edges of this truly cosmopolitan town AND with lines that criss/cross so you don't have to venture all the way into CBD if you don't need/want to, it truly is the best public transport we've ever been in globally!"
,,wheelchair accessible public transport,5.0,,I use a power wheelchair and found the SMRT very wheelchair friendly with lifts and very minimal gap between the train and the platform at most stations.
,,Systematic and friendly staffs,5.0,,"You can actually get around the whole kf singapore city by just using the smrt. Its very convenient and systematic. They have different exits so make sure you read the signs carefully or else you can just any of the friendly staffs there to assist you. They are really helpful. The smrt is very near to all the tourist attraction and dont forget to get your tourist card at the counter for smoother rides. They have 1,2 and 3 days pass which is unlimited rides and you can use it for train and bus."
,,Easy Travel,5.0,,"Travelled on the SMART, easy to purchase tickets very clean and quick to get about the city. Purchased a day trip ticket allowing us to hop on and off and the end of the use hand ticket back and get $10 refund."
,,World's greatest subway?,5.0,,"The subway in Singapore must surely be the greatest in the world. Completely clean, no grafitti, nothing of what usually makes a subway unpleasant. You can not eat or drink here. The trains are very modern. People behave nicely. The trains run on time. A great, and cheap, way to get around town."
,,"Efficient, Clean & Safe Public Transportation",5.0,,"We took the train from Changi International airport in Singapore to our hotel near downtown upon our arrival. We were very impressed with how simple it was to navigate our route using the transit map.

This is a great way to get around Singapore. The trains & stations are clean, safe and highly efficient."
,,Cheap Convenient Efficient Comfortable,4.0,,"The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system connects travellers to most part of the island. Visitors can but a Singapore Tourist Pass which is a special ez-link card that allows them to travel on buses and the MRT system and get a refunded on any used value when they leave.
MRT stations are usually linked to transport hubs and/or shopping malls and can get you close enough so that any destination is at most an inexpensive cab ride away, and often within walking distance.
If you are visiting Singapore for the first time, spend a few minutes familiarising yourself with the MRT system and you'd save a lot of time and money."
,,Best Travel Option,5.0,,This metro network allows for travel all around Singapore at local process. The Cards have a $1 deposit that is returned when the card is. Use google to check for the closest station be fore you leave and be prepared to change lines.

,,Functional and clean,5.0,,Used the metro frequently while in Singapore. It is cheap and easy way to go around. Stations are accessible for people with disabilities. There were never big crowds.
,,Smooth ride from west to east – 01 Dec 2017,3.0,,"Took the ride from Clementi to Changi Airport. Thank goodness it was a smooth ride as I had decide to catch the train before the morning worker's rush, which always seem to cause breakdowns due to signal faults."
,,Metro,5.0,,"So easy to get around Singapore on the metro and reasonable prices for the trips, the information is in English as well and the map easy to follow, really clean too."

I am very grateful for escalators and lifts in every station. The stations are clean as no food or drinks are allowed. Avoid the rush hour if you’re not prepared to squeeze into crowded trains."
,,Slow.....,3.0,,"Immaculate clean, but far too slow for the distances. I live in Hong Kong and the MTR there is a lot faster and equally as clean. I think punblic transit in Singapore is overated."
,,Awesome way to travel,5.0,,"Cheap, easy to use and reliable. If you are a tourist and will be travelling a lot buy a tourist ticket and dont forget to give it back before you go to get your $10 deposit back."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Bought a tourist pass at the airport and used this the whole time. At the end of our stay, we returned the plastic pass and were refunded the$10 for this and also the balance remaining on the card as we had to top up beyond the 3 day pass.
The trains are all beautifully clean and run efficiently and often. A great way to get around Singapore."
,,Incredible!,5.0,,This system is amazing. All I can say is I wish the Victorian authorities responsible for public transport would go and have a look at the SMRT to see what can be achieved.
,,SMRT Convenient,3.0,,"We found the new Expo/Bukit Panjang route very convenient, covers interchanging to/fro Changi airport easily from Bayfront. It covers Chinatown, Bugis, Botanical Garden etc etc.

Thumb up ! We traveled to stations Waterloo; Bedok; Tampines; Dakota (old airport road hawkers centre); Somerset (Crystal palace paragon) & many other stations etc for foodies hunting."
,,Very easy and very safe,5.0,,"It's an absolute breeze to get around on the MRT here in Singapore. The cost is very low and it's almost always on time. Be aware, if you're a foreigner, that being on the phone or eating / drinking is a faux pas."
,,"Cheap, convenient and clean",5.0,,"The very first time we took it, the signs were confusing, but we soon got the hang of it. Visitors can get a 3-day unlimited pass for $30 of which $10 will be refunded, though we forgot to get the refund at the MRT station at the airport. Not sure MRT is convenient to get to and from the airport though!"
,,Coolest Way Around Singers,5.0,,"I use the MRT extensively when in Singapore. It’s my favourite mode of transport, safe, clean, very efficient and reasonably priced. Not taking anything away from the other forms of public transport in Singapore, all excellent, the MRT is definitely the best way to get around the city-state whether you are a tourist, local or a regular visitor like me, alone or with my family. Most places of note are in walking distance from the stations, some are right above or within the building. The network is mostly underground keeping you out of the heat and humidity but a few lines run above ground in the outer areas of Singapore, such as part of the track to and from Changi Airport. You have to remember this is a mass transit system so there are moments when it does get crowded. So if you can plan your travel either side of the morning and evening peak periods or in between you’ll do fine. The system runs currently on 5 lines and will expanded to 6 in the not too distant future, making coverage of Singapore nearly complete. The MRT uses a check-in, check-out system. Buy tickets and reloadable cards at TransitLink Ticket offices at major stations or from vending machines. As I’m in Singapore frequently I use the EZ-link card and reload/top-up when necessary. These cards last 5 years and can be used for the MRT and the other forms of public transport: buses and light rail (LRT). Tourists depending on how long they stay have two options, they can purchase a Singapore Tourist Pass (STP) for 1, 2 and 3 days, or purchase the Singapore Tourist Pass Plus (STP+) valid for 1 and 3 days. Both cards activate from first use. The difference between them? The STP has a $10 deposit, refundable if the card is returned within 5 days after day of purchase. The STP+ has no deposit. The other major difference, the STP+ includes special deals and promotions at food and beverage outlets and attractions. Both can be used as normal EZ-link cards after expiry. For info on the STP/STP + visit the Singapore Tourist Pass website and for the EZ-link card at the EZ-link website. Cards can also be bought at a few other places including 7-Eleven stores, but do check the websites to be sure of locations for the tourist passes."

We also used the SMRT to travel locally. The trains come frequently, are clean and air conditioned and inexpensive. Of course, like everywhere the trains can be crowded at peak hour."
,,"Comprehensive System, Excellent Communication, Immaculately Clean",5.0,,"This is one of the most modern subway systems in the world.

,,Some of the route is being replaced by bus,3.0,,"A very good transportation mode. A much simpler one than one in japan, fast and reliable. The difference is it is hard to find any officer that could help you, lack of sign, and the officers kind of rude. Very rude.
When we got to bayfront station, the train track that we would like to ride somehow not operated at that time and being replaced by bus. We found no officer to gave us explanation or what else, just a sign to found the bus. We didn't know the bus' route, so we got off as near as possible from our hotel which is around 2km."
,,"Clean, easy to use subway, even for tourists",5.0,,"For tourists that want to get around, this is a user friendly commuter system that can get you just about to all the major tourists sites. My suggestion would be to get the tourist pass which also gives you access to the bus system which is equally easy to use. Between the two (subway and bus) you can see everything in Singapore. Another benefit is that many of the stations open directly into malls and are also connected to main hotels in the downtown area. It rains a lot in Singapore and the way they have it built, it is fully covered at most spots when you disembark so you do not have to worry about getting soaked in the rain. If you do the tourist pass, they will keep a $10 per card deposit until you return the card so keep this in mind. You can also take it straight to the airport which is a benefit if you are traveling light. The system is very easy to use, is exceptionally clean, and has no homeless panhandlers in it which is a plus. A woman/female would feel very comfortable traveling on it alone at night or during the day."
,,Connecting the most popular places to visit in Singapore,5.0,,Love the MRT because it is connecting the most popular places to visit in Singapore and as a tourist we can avail of the SG tourist pass which is so affordable
,,"Easy, inexpensive, clean, safe way to get around",4.0,,"I was able to master the MRT very quickly. When I had an issue there were attendants available to assist. An average round trip was just a few dollars. Trains run frequently and are consistent. There are four major lines that are color coded. You can get most places by mapping out the colors. It does get crowded but it is civilized and manageable. As a solo woman traveler, I felt safe and comfortable. I appreciated the cleanliness of the system. Reminder: no eating or drinking on the MRT."
,,Speed & Effiency,5.0,,"What a great way to get around , very user friendly , Clean & Quick on a 3 day visitors pass , well worth it .
Not being a regular commuter or a city dweller I found this easy to use and very efficient , A lot of cities could learn from this system.
Do check when the last train home is especially if you want to get home from the Casino late."
,,Just good,5.0,,"As with everything in Singapore, the Metro works with great efficiency. Take a good look at the overall map and work out which lines you need to be on and where to change, then look at the furthest point of the line and follow the signs there. All colour coded and you really can't go wrong. I am 72 but look younger and am fit but a young lady offerred me her seat which was gratefully declined. What nice people and a good system"
,,Extremely efficient,5.0,,Great way to travel and so easy and clean. Extremely well organised service- loved using whilst on holiday there.
,,One of the best,5.0,,What is there to say about the SMRT? It's great; gets you where you want to go pretty fast and cheaply. Plus the stations are air conditioned so you can cool off.
,,Cleanest system ever,5.0,,"I have recently been on buisness in Singapore and this is one of the cleanest and most efficient transport systems I have been on for a very long time. We were issued with MRT card which act just like an Oyster card and can be used on busses or the MRT. The trains are frequent and air conditioned.

Top tip people do not eat on the metro and it is considered rude to do so."
,,"Clean, good access even with mobility challenges",5.0,,"One member of our party had to ride in a wheelchair due to knee+ankle injuries. There was access both by ramps and lifts. There was also marking on the ground where the train came in some cases so you could wait there and then there was the place for the wheel chair. In other cases there was the space against the wall. The area and trains were clean likely too becuase NO eating and drinking on the trains. The trains were reliable, coming every few minutes, even at night. Directions were signposted. We traveled on the east west line and north south. It is a much cheaper way to get about if you bus can get to a staion. We this by bus. We also had to use taxis a few times and those cost about double compared to going by bus and train. It does get busy during rush hours as is expected."
,,"Clean, and the good way to explore singapore !",4.0,,"This is my first time visit Singapore, i really expect big from this city, and try the SMRT is a good choice to explore singapore."
,,Cheap & efficient,5.0,,"Purchased a 3 day pass and whizzed around the city with ease. The stations are clean and well signposted and the trains frequent. For the most part, the trains are not overly packed but as you would expect there are fluctuations when folk are commuting. In train announcements are helpful as are the indicators showing exit doors."
,,The best 🚇,5.0,,"The cleanest, fastest,cheapest, safest way of transport în Singapore. A 10 days pass costs 15 $ and you can go anywhere with it."
,,Superb!,5.0,,"MRT became of my second favorite way to get around in Singapore. I mastered the bus system which is easy to do and remarkably rewarding, in that you can do sightseeing on a bus that you can't do on the subway.

I bought the three day pass for $30 which enabled me to take either bus or MRT plus a lot of savings on tourist attractions. At the end of those three days you can turn your card back in for a $10 refund. $20 to get around easily in Singapore is not too shabby!

MRT is clean, safe, and not too terribly crowded. One tip I learned is to either get on a subway at the very beginning or the very end of the train for extra room and space. This applies to moving luggage as well.

Practically everybody speaks English and striking up a conversation on the subway is a good way to make good memories."
,,Essential,3.0,,Essential public transport in Singapore. Clean & well maintained. Recent breakdowns has caused quite alot of unhappiness but generally breakdowns are not frequent. Many shops & malls in each station.
,,extension of the BLUE LINE has just opened,5.0,,"The MRT is great value for money and easy to use. It's spotlessly clean and there are lots of staff and volunteers at all stations to provide assistance. My tip is to buy a tourist ticket that covers all MRT and bus travel, easy to top up if needed and you get a refund on what you don't use."
,,"Clean, safe and fast",5.0,,"A great way to nip about town, easy to use, friendly staff and locals. Get a map online, job done, easy peasy."
,,"Clean, safe, reliable, the only way to travel in Singapore",5.0,,"The SMRT is the way to travel when visiting Singapore. It is safe, clean, reliable and cheap. We were only in Singapore for the weekend and purchased a three day Tourist Pass which cost $20 with a $10 refundable deposit for the card. We purchased the ticket at the airport when we arrived and didn’t need to pay any more money for travelling on the SMRT and buses the whole weekend. This included to and from the airport, travelling out to the Zoo and back and also Sentosa Island Universal Studios. Like all tubes try and avoid rush hours as it does get busy but follow the rules and wait on the green lines if possible. Please note no eating or DRINKING in the stations or on-board trains."
,,Way to go!,5.0,,"What a great method of transport. We used it many times each day.It is cheap, clean and trains come by every few minutes. We were able to cover the whole of the touristy sights easily using this method."
,,"Easy Ride, Clear Instructions",4.0,,"Highly recommend that you select your destination before hop on the train. Once you are in the right station. You will find each direction indicated by arrow direction and name of each stopped station. Stations are clean, friendly info server, and most importantly local residents are approachable and friendly. Have a fun ride."
,,Very efficient and easy to use,5.0,,"I'm a great mass transit fan but was hesitant to ""go solo"" in an Asian system without any local languages. No worries: Instructions are in English as well as the local languages, and each station has very helpful maps showing where the various exits deposit one on the surface streets. I've traveled all over the world, and this is perhaps the best metro system I've seen."
,,Excellent train service,5.0,,"When traveling from one place to another in Singapore, I will always take the MRT. This train service is very convenient for everyone. With additional to the opening of the new downtown line stage 3, there are more places you can visit in Singapore via this train transit. MRT will usually be very crowded during the peak hours everyday. Although recently in the pass few days there are many break downs that happened, but MRT service is still a good choice for me."
,,Let google maps be with you!,5.0,,"Google maps! Fantastic transport system using a card top up that is completely linked to google maps. If you know a place, road or building the app will tell you which train/bus to get and where to get it, fantastic and no need to use taxis at all."

,,Cheap and fast transport,5.0,,Cheap and fast way to get around Singapore. Although best to avoid during peak periods. Easy to purchase tickets using the machines provided.
,,Best in the world,5.0,,"I use it 5 days a week to get to and from work. It is reliable, reasonably comfortable, clean and like all mrt systems gets crowded during the rush hours. It is great value for money to get around."

,,Cheap convenient option,5.0,,Great transport system. Wish I had got the travel pass the first day. Bought 3 day tourist pass which gave me unlimited travel. Got to explore so many different areas of Singapore. Next time will get pass again
,,Gets You Anywhere for Next to Nothing,5.0,,The MRT will take you from one side of the Island to the other for a pittance. The trains are clean and efficient. It is easy to get a pass and to refill it - hard to image spending more than $20 travelling everywhere in a week.The Singapore Taxis are also cheap and clean but traffic can get a little silly at times so it is worthwhile staying underground.
,,WOW!!,5.0,,"Coming from Australia, it’s not often we are spoilt with public transport but SMRT is world class !! I’ve experienced the Tube in London , & Metro in Paris , and SMRT is miles ahead!! VERY easy to navigate and understand. SUPER CLEAN!
I really recommend getting the tourist pass which gives unlimited rides for a set number of days ( 3 days for $20! ) its invaluable!!"
,,Testing out the MRT,4.0,,"We walked from the JW Marriott to the Marina Bay Area across the Helix Bridge. Not bad even in the 90’s, can stop at shops and malls along the way. Easy to navigate the MRT once you get the hang of it. Had an issue paying with Credit Card. So clean and reliable."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,It too us a day to learn how it works but once you master it its easy the trains move so fast but the sad thing their isn't enough seating for the elderly and places for the wheelchairs bound. They take you to the centre of the city close to the malls which is great and the malls whilst walking to them are awesome
,,Very Convenient and Efficient.,5.0,,The SMRT is such a convenient way to see Singapore. The three day pass for SGD 20 allows unlimited travel by MRT and bus and is very good for tourists.
,,Quickest way to get about,5.0,,"Great service on the MRT, never waited more than 4 minutes for a train. The E-Z link card is the most convenient way to pay for fares and is so cheap."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,4.0,,Cheapest and most efficient way to go around Singapore if you are travelling solo or as a couple. Pretty much 90 percent of Singapore is connected by SMRT. Buy ezlink card to avoid long queues to buy single journey tickets.
,,The best!,5.0,,"I have a love/ hate relationship with transportation, just like everyone else. When it's clean, fast, and reliable then I love it! And that's exactly what the Singapore MRT was like. We did get a little lost sometimes but that's because of our terrible map reading skills haha. Definitly worth a ride."
,,Efficient Transport System,5.0,,"Makes getting around Singapore by foot easy, once you Work it out. Buy the Transit card and put no more than $10 on it to start. That lasted us a week, using it daily to see the sights. Trains every couple of minutes. Crowded at peak times! Top up as you need it."

,,Exactly what you want.,4.0,,"The MRT is a fantastic transport system. The trains are spotlessly clean, safe, its reliable and punctual. As a tourist it is a great way to see the city at your own leisure. It is very cheap to travel on. All stations have AC and a lot of the stations are either adjacent to shopping malls, undercover walk ways or within a few minutes walk from tourist attractions. You can get to the airport from the city as well."
,,So easy,5.0,,We got ourselves the transit card the first day. As we were there for 9 days it was perfect. No problems cashing in the balance at the end of our journey. They system is easy to understand and everyone is helpful if you do get lost. Best way of getting around Singapore.

The buses lines are also inexpensive and well organised.
Taxi is also available and cheap.
All three are safe."
,,Fast. Coins.,5.0,,"Super clean, super fast, and well maintained, it's quick, cheap, and worth it. However, bring coins - the brand new bills I used were often rejected, and credit is difficult as well. But, for total area and speed, this was one of my favorite train systems on three continents.

9/10 - coins suck."
,,Easy System & A Huge Benefit in the Heat!,5.0,,"The system is easy to use, you can get a tourist pass for one, two or three days and it saves messing about, failing that just get a ticket each time you travel and it's easy enough. There's maps all over and the staff are helpful. Well worth using to save your feet in the heat!"
,,Very good organised,5.0,,"In the 5 days we were in Singapore, we traveled 4 days with this subway system.
It is very organised and prices are good compared with taxi's.
Just get a map of the whole system and find your way around.
Singapore people are very helpfull and if they see you looking at the map, they will explane where you have to go."
,,Great,5.0,,Used it on a daily base when we stayed a few nights in Singapore thanks to volcano mount agung........
,,Easy way to scoot around Singapore,5.0,,"Using the MRT system is an easy way to scoot around Singapore. As a tourist, you can buy a 1-day, 3-day pass too. Quite economical to ride around Singapore."

,,"Wide netowrk, very convinient",5.0,,It is the cheapest and fastest way to get around in Singapore. Do get a prepaid card to save time at booking counters.
,,Fascinating Mass Rapid Transportation System,5.0,,"A no. of lines crisscrossing the entire length and breadth of Singapore. All trains are driverless, computer controlled and run on schedule. The combination of MRT and buses, with an added facility of a common payment card, makes the travel, effortless and enjoyable"
,,Clean and Fast,5.0,,"The MRT is one of the most convenient transit lines that I have ever been on. This always clean, always accessible mode of transportation is definitely great to use, because of the efficiency and the cheap price."
,,BEST SUBWAY Services ..,5.0,,Like the mumbai trains the MRT is the life line of SIngapore ... amazingly connected to almost every nook an d corner of the city .. Decently priced .. They are well maintained and deserves lots of accolades for the timings too .. BEST
,,Ever dependable SMRT,5.0,,Every every I see marked changes which always amazes me. The Singapore Metro now seems to reach almost all places of Singapore and as usual very dependable and efficient.

Recommend to buy the three day tourist pass. Ticket offices are located only on a few stations so check them out in ahead."
,,Absolutely brilliant!,5.0,,"MRT is a great experience and here’s why:
1. It’s cheap. Don’t get a tourist card but a $12 card (2017) and top up. It was never more than $1.50 a trip - even 40 minutes away!
2. It’s regular. Trains run very regularly and are so clean. Don’t drink or eat on stations or trains as there is a $500 fine.
3. They are safe. You can’t access the tracks as there are doors that open only when the train is in place.
4. Easy to navigate. Great signage and illuminated stops on the train show you where you are and where you’re going.

Overall a brilliant experience."
,,Connects the City,5.0,,Our 3 day stay in Singapore was heavily dependent on MRT and it never disappointed. Always on time. Fast. Have many interconnecting stations to reach any part of the city without paying separately.
,,Very well organised,5.0,,"There are occasional 'blips' but this is well organised overall and so much cheaper than the London Underground. You buy your tickets from a machine, and if you top up the same ticket 6 times you get a discount. It is so clean and safe and there are excellent instructions and signs everywhere, with staff happy to help."
,,So easy to use and immaculate!,5.0,,"The SMT is so easy to use, buy a card to recharge and options for 1-3 day passes or a card if you are staying longer. Very reasonable cost per trip and the cleanest subway you will find. Covers stops at all the main city points and great to be out of the sun and heat!"
,,My train of bad thoughts,1.0,,"Sometimes the journey is smooth. Most of the time, its packed to the brim and the waiting time is unpredictable. Occasionally it breaks down. I have had enough, would avoid unless necessary or desperate."
,,"SO EASY, CONVENIENT AND AFFORDABLE",5.0,,"If you can get around London, Hong Kong, Rome, you can certainly get around Singapore. The trains are SO clean, just like the ones in Tokyo. The map on the wall is so easy to understand and the fare is right there. There is a counter in every station so don't worry if you are unsure or lost (which is impossible)."
,,"Comfortable, quick, and affordable",4.0,,"The mass rapid transit system is getting a lot of bad press recently with frequent service breakdowns on its main lines. This is a big problem for a well-used public transport system and, so far, there are suggestions of systemic failure in management.
That said, it's a great system for tourists who are not on a timeline. It is easy to navigate and, most of the time, you travel in relative comfort at an affordable price. And this despite the existence of taxis, Grab, and Uber.
It is also particularly useful in inclement weather or when it is just too darn hot.
If you want a slower ride but want to see more of the streetscape, catch a bus.
All buses are air-conditioned and the top deck of double decker ones give a great view.
Between train and bus you can get to pretty much most places of interest on the island.
Just avoid peak hours and weekends. Although trains are very frequent, almost all are crowded. Locals tell of being unable to get on two or three or more. Maybe they need those white gloved pushers that they use in Tokyo.
I've travelled on about 20 different public transit systems and would say this is not the best but it's not the worst either.
Ticketing machines are easy to work out and use. A stored value card is the way to go if you are going to make several trips over several days.
Not all stations have a ticket office and some have shorter hours than others."
,,Absolutely brilliant.,5.0,,We visit Singapore often and always use the trains. Extremely efficient transport system in fact we have an ezlink card which we just top up every visit & I think it last for 10 yrs before renewal.
,,Know where you are going,5.0,,Used it for the Marina Bay Sands Hotel from Chinatown. Saved a walk. Clean and fast- cheap price. In English and Malay

,,efficient and clean,5.0,,"the MRT system is so much better than what we have here in the UK.
the trains are driverless and spotlessy clean, run on time and while we were in Singapore we never experienced any problems with the MRT.
you buy a card from the ticket office within the station and top it up likean Oyster card.
the journeys are cheap as well and you can use them on the buses as well.
for a weeks travel we used around $50 dollars each and was well worth it."
,,Clean regular trains and easy to use,5.0,,The best way to get around. Get an EaZ-link card it is more convenient to get around. Top up at the stations. Maps available so plan the end station on the line you want to go on. Follow very good directions. and detailed station posters. Always staff on hand to help you. Computer monitoring to tell you when next train due.
,,Good convenient mode of transport,5.0,,"Contrary to what most locals would say, the Singapore train transport system is very good for travelling around. Train rides cost at maximum two dollars plus, hence is really an affordable option to go around."
,,best in the world,5.0,,"When in Singapore the best way to get around is by a tourist pass . 3 days cost $30 and you get $10 back when you return your card. The MRT. incredibly clean and efficient..trains every 2-3 minutes..i was given a little map with my pass to help navigate where to change trains, but there are maps everywhere. It is all electronic..no driver, no guards, so if you take your time getting onto the train(like my son did) you get left on the platform when the doors shut. Luckily at the next stop there was a train going back the other way so i could go back to get him and my wife only had to endure 5 minutes of panic. It is a very easy and cheap way to get around."
,,Super clean mass transit subway - very convenient!,5.0,,"The SMRT is easy to navigate, fairly inexpensive, super clean and easy to use. The cars are clean and very frequent. We never waited more than about 4 minutes for a car. We used multiple times over 6 days and were very impressed by this system. Also, the stations are clean and easy to navigate. Probably the best subway system we have seen!"
,,Easy and best way to get round,5.0,,"We stayed in Singapore recently for 2 nights and used the MRT to get around. We found it to be very easy to use and navigate our way round and there are of course stations in all the places you need to be.

It is immaculately clean and all air conditioned which is not like the UK!

Just one recommendation when you buy you tickets in the station make sure you have small bills in you like S$2 or coins as the machines don’t seem to like bigger values. Also try and found out if when you have completed your last journey if you can recycle your ticket for a S$1 refund as we were told this is the case after we had left all to try and keep it clean."
,,"So quick, clean and easy to use",5.0,,"Loved the MRT. We felt safe and it was so easy to use. The direction of MRT and next stop was clear, ticketing was easy, all passengers were kind and polite and it was so quiet and clean! Puts Australia’s rail system to shame"

,,travelled by SMRT,4.0,,"friendly SMRT , will travel again . one can travel with comfort and at lesser cost . In bus if you dont have the smart card drop required currency in the drop box in the bus"
,,Really easy to use,5.0,,"We found the MRT excellent for getting around Singapore. Very easy to use, well signposted and very clean. We never waited more that 5 mins for a train. We were only there for a couple of days so we just paid for individual tickets but would be worth buying a multiple day pass if you are there for a few days. It would also save time in the stations. We were near Orchard station so we were only a few stops down to City Hall station, which is close to Raffles and the old side of Marina Bay. Took us about 30mins in total to get there from leaving our hotel. Also felt very safe."
,,"Nice, Clean and Very Hospitable Riders",5.0,,This rail system is clean and the stops are clearly announced and well laid out. What is more amazing are the gestures of kindness from seniors giving up their seats for older riders. Such an amazing act of kindness. It made the ride that much more memorable.

,,Lisa,5.0,,"Best advice around this time of year for tourists till after New Year learn to use the MRT..

Got the ticket from 7eleven and walked to the station next to us. After a short while walking through the tunnels we found the right place.

Everything is marked clearly and it is easy to find the right route to reach your destination. Places are clean and of the stations feel comfortably cool compared to the heat on the streets.+++"
,,It is clean,3.0,,easily access to places as there are multiple lines and you do not have to wait for too long.Each interval is around 5 mins wait or less! It is also more convenient compared to bus.
,,Very clean and safe,4.0,,"You can eat on the floor in this subway system. Extremely clean, new, and very safe. The only complaint is it is quite slow. So we often chose a taxi over the subway as they were pretty cheap too."
,,The London Underground can learn from Singapore,5.0,,By the far the cleanest train system I have travelled on. Train tickets are cheap and you can purchase up to 6 journeys on the one ticket which are slightly discounted after your first journey. The system is easy to follow and use
,,Positive experience helpful staff,4.0,,"There is plenty of negative reports about the MRT right now in terms of times, delays and blame attributions to various parties. However, my experience was that apart from one train was slow and waited in each station in the evening because of a train ahead the rest of the journeys were excellent. I felt safe and comfortable, the facilities are clean and travellers are polite and quiet, no shouting or talking loudly on phones as you see in some countries including Australia. I wonder if people know just how annoying such behaviour is for other travellers. Very good price and helpful staff."
,,Easy to use and very clean,5.0,,Travelled on mrt with one change over. Used ticket machine and cash. Went from city hall station to harbourfront (sentosa) for $3.30 return. Well sign posted and very easy to use.
,,Wish NYC has a transit system like the Singapore MRT!,5.0,,"I️ fell in love with Singapore Mass Rapid Transit! I️ truly wish NYC has a transit system as clean, efficient, organized, punctual, cost-effective, safe, nice, etc as Singapore MRT but I know it’s never going to happen. For all tourist, absolutely use the MRT as it’s easy to navigate and super cheap. You will figure it out and it’s highly recommended. Easier than Uber, Grab and Taxi."
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"Its by far the best way to get around the city. If you have a travel map and the MRT rout, you can buy a ticket for 2 or 3 days and hop on and off as you please. There is not much waiting as the MRT runs efficiently at all times."
,,Easy access throughout the city,4.0,,"It's very safe and easy to use. I purchase the tourist tickets for 2 days. It can use for some buses too. You can purchase at SIN airport. They opens at 8am so go there after. You have to deposit money for the card (about $10) but when you return The card, they will give you back The deposit
The trains come like almost every 5 min so it doesnt hurt even you miss the train. Very convenient."
,,The best transportation in Singapore for Tourist,5.0,,"I bought STP for 2 day in here, and I can use unlimited for 2 day. I can go anywhere in Singapore by MRT. So easy, clean, on time, and comfortable. If you come to Singapore, you just need MRT to go anywhere."
,,Mrt train,5.0,,Fantastic train system you can catch mrt to all tourist places get a netcard (same as a multirider in perth) costs $5 recharge in $10 lots but only costs around 80cents a ride get a map and follow the coloured lines to destinations if unsure ask at the info boothes very helpfull people love there public transport system better than taxis there are a lot of signs to follow to show you where to go
,,Used to be reliable ... not anymore,2.0,,"The MRT system could be depended on to take you on time from one place to another. Not anymore. When you get on board a train, there is always the stress of never knowing whether you will get to your destination on time or be late. It’s a mess right now. The authorities promise solutions and a return to efficient management. Hopefully this will happen soon."
,,Excellent transport links,5.0,,"Spotlessly clean, No food or drink allowed. Younger people give us their seats for older folk, which was a novelty for us, as you don't get that in the UK any more. Very cheap to travel and regular services, every few minutes. Buy an MRT travel card to save time and top up when required."
,,"Timely, clean, safe",5.0,,"Whats not to like about the MRT. Every time i have used the system its always been on time, always clean and always safe.
I have read there have been a few issues lately but I have nothing bad to say about the public transport system.
2 thumbs up"
,,Don't use while peak hours,3.0,,The mrt systems are very cheap and fast in singapore but when it's peak hours don't get on the train rather spend time in a place or chilling than on a filled train
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Absolutely brilliant way to get around. We got a two day visitor pas for $16 each and we certainly got our money's worth.
Gets you from A to B in no time at all and very easy to use. Everywhere is clearly marked. Wouldn't travel any other way"
,,Amazing,4.0,,"Amazing connectivity , True way to explore singapore really amazing. Truly if you want to enjoy local ride them SMRT is the right choice"
,,Singapore SMRT,5.0,,Fantastic way to get around Singapore.Modern underground transport system.Very well signposted efficient clean and inexpensive.
,,"Clean, efficient, well priced",5.0,,"A good system, trains and stations are clean, trains are efficient. We felt very safe. Journeys are well priced and, importantly for tourists, very helpful platform staff to get you to where you need to go."
,,Brilliant system,5.0,,"Bought ourselves a top up card, cheaper than a tourist one day pass. Totally new and efficient, all stations we visited had both lifts and escalators. Puts London’s tube system to shame"
,,The best of the world's subways,5.0,,"It is a pleasure to travel around Singapore in the underground rail system. I have always admired the London underground, but the SMRT eclipses London's tube."
,,Getting around Singapore for the traveller on a budget!,4.0,,"I am a big fan of using public transport as a way of saving money and seeing as much as I can. The SMRT is a super efficient and cost-effective means of getting around Singapore. It is easy to navigate and understand, and the staff are more than happy to assist. Trains run regularly, and are spacious and clean. The stations are easy to get around through, and have access to connecting bus services as well as nearby food and shops. Plan your trip before you leave using Google Maps - which will show you the train line to use, and what station to hop off at. That way it's a matter of getting on the right train. Enjoy!"
,,Excellent as always.,5.0,,"Having been to Singapore many times, and returned again recently, I can highly recommend Singapore's public transport, both train and bus. It is easy to use,cheap, safe and very efficient so we rarely have the need for taxis, even travelling by train between the airport and hotels. If we are on the train with cases at busy times we get in the very end of the first or last carriage to try and keep our cases from causing an obstruction. There are lifts (elevators) in the stations to make it easier with cases, strollers, wheelchairs etc."
,,Tourist pass so easy to use,5.0,,Great travel system it was so easy to get around the longest wait was 3 minutes. And really great priced if you get the travel pass or just a ticket. The staff are super friendly and helpful.
,,Public Transport easy to use,4.0,,We liked using metro and buses in Singapore. They are easy to use and you can reach all the important areas.
,,"Easy to use, clean, safe, reliable",5.0,,"The MRT is just so fast, so easy, so convenient that I use it rather than a taxi (everywhere else in the world I would always take a taxi instead). The graphic displays in the trains make it so easy to find the right stop, and the prices are cheap. Fantastic public transport!!!"
,,New experience,5.0,,I just amaze with that. Really in my hometown there is no train. I enjoy my ride with my friends and the thing I very in love with is their punctuality.
,,Superb,5.0,,"Can not recommend the system highly enough, clean,efficient trains and stations and really easy to get around 26SD, FOR A 2 DAY PASS, NO RESTRICTIONS, hand your card back and get 10SD refund, a real bargain"
,,"Clean, fast and reliable",5.0,,"Ok so it isn’t as lightning fast as the MTR in Hong Kong, but the service is very convenient.

For tourists travelling to Singapore, it’s fairly intuitive to follow the route diagrams, most of the stations are attached to malls, so you’re in air conditioning most of the time, and it’s clean with the trains running fairly regularly.

Interestingly, the Singaporeans MRT users I observed seem to think it's acceptable for children to take precedence on seating ahead of full paying customers and the elderly. It will be interesting to see the results in a few years’ time, of these overindulged entitled children."
,,Great value,5.0,,This is the best way to get around Singapore. Trains run on time and are very clean. They offer fantastic value especially if you purchase an EZ card or visitors pass both of which give you travel on the trains and buses. Check Singapore’s transport web site for details.
,,Easy and reliable,4.0,,"The MRT is a great way to get around Singapore. Choose your destination from the ticket machine and you'll be issued with a cardboard ticket. Swipe it at the gate and board the train. You can reuse the ticket - just add more value at the ticket machine. Trains are very frequent and reliable, with a digital board indicating the waiting time to the next one."
,,General,5.0,,Thanks main attraction of transport in Singapore is that train and bus the weekend of two types MRT and LRT which covers entire singaapore this transport facility well mentioned it worth to travelling and tourist attraction especially for Indians
,,"Clean, efficient, fast and easy",5.0,,"The MRT system in Singapore is an easy and great way to get around town. It is exceptionally clean and very efficient. It is an especially great respite from the heat and humidity. I bought the 3 day unlimited pass for $20 SGD (plus a $10 refundable rental fee - which is a bit of a schlep to get back as you have to make sure to go to one of the ticket offices while they are open to get it back). That aside, it really was a good value as a solo traveller. For more than two people, I would definitely evaluate how much you would use it as taxis could end up being cheaper if you only want to get to a couple of places. Plus, most tourist places really aren't that far apart so walking is pretty easy (as long as you can handle the humidity and it isn't raining)."
,,WOW!!!!! What a Buzz,5.0,,"The MRT is absolutely amazing!!!! From driverless trains roaring through the subway, to the cleanliness and efficiency, and the ease of use - it's absolutely amazing. It's well worth while taking the time and trouble to get a map and to work out what routes you're going to take - as this will help you change from the 'downtown"" line, to the Blue line etc. However, there's no real problem as Singaporeans are so darned polite and helpful that they'll point you in the correct direction with no worries!!! Being disables, I found it so easy to use the MRT especially as there are reserved seats for people with disabilities just inside each door - and the Singaporeans always ensure that a seat is available if you are elderly and/or in need.

What a system - Australis has a lot to learn!!!!!!!"
,,A daily habit,5.0,,"Singapore MRTS is a very good transport mode available in Singapore and very relaxing too. Though it is a very amazing ride , it gets easier travelling"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Always on-time, easy to use. Now there's the new blue line-Downtown. Making it much easier to get to interesting places."
,,Downtown trains are automated,5.0,,"I looked 3 times. The trains on downtown line are automated. They run by themselves. You would not know that there is no driver if you did see it. All procedures are super smooth.

The service level of all employees we met were excellent.

I strongly recommend to allow to purchase the tourist pass at more stations. We had to spend money and 1 hour to find a place that sells tourist passes for SMRT. This was very inconvenient."
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT system has to be one of the best and most efficient in the world. Relatively cheap , easy to navigate & clean ."
,,Easiest & cheap way to get around Singapore,5.0,,We purchased tickets from one of the station. Staff was very helpful explaining everything and even told us don’t forget to collect the balance when done. We travelled on SMRT everyday when we were there. System is very clean and kept clean.
,,Efficient and quick,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is really quick if you want to get from point A to point B quickly. It is faster than public buses and cheaper than taxis. The MRT offers the best of both worlds. If you’re commuting in Singapore, the MRT is a must-use"
,,Cheap and easy,5.0,,"New, fast and superclean trains. The easiest way to og from place to Place in Singapore. But a prepaid card if staying for more than a couple days."
,,prompt,5.0,,easy to access and understand the routes. Connects all the major points and hence convenient to travel
,,On time train.fast.,4.0,,"It s a comfortable public transport. Fast and on time. But as I travel with my kids, walking from the station gate to train is a little bit far for them."
,,Convenient & Cheap,5.0,,I took SMRT twice during my first visit to Singapore and I must say it is extremely convenient and considering Taxi fares you can call it economical as well. Though it is crowded during peak hours it is understandable because it is very effective and has great network.
,,Super efficient and affordable,5.0,,"I travelled all over Singapore through the Singapore MRT and it was a great experience for my entire family including my aged parents who could easily adapt to this efficient transportation. My special compliments to the staff, as we witnessed, first hand the efficient and smooth handling of passengers during a temporary disruption of services, wherein the passengers were smoothly handled and moved to buses. Amazing coordination and smooth conduct sans any chaos. Great work guys.. lots to learn from you all."
,,Best Transportation in the world!,5.0,,"It's so easy, safe, fast and cozy to commute from one place to anothers in singapore by mrt, the map is easy to read, they put helpull staff in several ticket machine to help tourist who still confused with the map or ticket machine and they teach them patiently to read the map"
,,Easy and convenient,5.0,,"Get from one place to the next can not be easier. The instructions on the train is very clear and straight forward, so you can’t really get lost. By use one of those smrt card makes travel cheaper, but problem I had while I was using is we can’t enter the train station with the card balance below 2:45."
,,Wow!,5.0,,"Safety plus!. So different to what I am used to. This should be in every country. You cannot gain access to the track at all. It's all sealed off with doors. The doors open when the train arrives. Safety, trains every 2 minutes. What more could you ask for. The transport system in Singapore is amazing."
,,great way to get around,4.0,,"System keeps expanding, new section of the downtown line just opened. Trips are cheap, especially with an ez-link card. Can be pretty crowded at rush hour. Some stations are big and transfers can take quite a bit of walking. It's kind of annoying that the system requires you to add value to your card when it drops below a few dollars no matter how little you intend to spend on trips."
,,Probably the best system in the world,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, easy to use and cheap - what more could you ask for.

It's obvious a lot of thought has gone into the system and it shows - did not see any trouble or problems or large amounts of people - the system just seemed to work!"
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,"Not much to be said, it is swift, clean, prompt, cheap and so convenient. oh yes, aircon :) numerous lines cover the entire state and you never have to wait long for the next train.get a multi-day pass and go and discover!"
,,Easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"These trains are so good. Clean, punctual and the Singaporeans are so courteous to older people offering their seats. Cost is minimal as well."
,,"as the name says it, it is rapid!",5.0,,"Using frequent public transportation in SG can be expensive but visitors can buy the Singapore Tourist Pass ( at the airport or some subway stations) to have unlimited rides (including buses) for 1, 2 or 3 days.

It allowed us to visit multiple attractions and discover the city.

Al stations we saw had public toilets, lifts (elevators) and wifi access on the platforms.

The wagons are wide with A/C and we never saw any delays."
,,A well established system,5.0,,"This is sooooo easy. When you get the hang of MRT you really don't need any other form of transport to take you around Singapore. There's a station close by to all the tourist attractions in Singapore with just of only 5-10 mins of walking distance. Sometimes the trains get crowded in the peak hours but still you can manage to get about without any hassle. A very fast and efficient system to travel and I would recommend to anyone who plans to travel on a budget trip to Singapore.
There is a ez-link card for tourists (tourist pass) which gives unlimited travel.
1 day - SGD 10,
2 days - SGD 16
3 days - SGD 20
with a SGD 10 refundable deposit for each pass. This is so worth it if you plan to travel a lot. However you will not get this tourist pass in all stations (terminal 2 of Changi Airport, Bugis station, Raffels place and City Hall are some of the places you get this). However if you ask any station they will give you information on where you can collect and get the refund after the end of the trip. Everyone we spoke to was helpful and we got around quite easily."
,,Efficient and Simple to use,5.0,,We used the MRT extensively on our holiday. Clean and extremely efficient we travelled all over Singapore with ease
,,First class travel for all passengers,5.0,,"I know very well the subways of cities like London and New York. They are in a different league from Singapore's MRT system. The only parallel I know might be Hong Kong's MTR System which also invests heavily in expansion and automation. Singapore's service, like the country itself, thinks far ahead to provide an ever-expanding network of routes and high-quality trains. Locals may sometimes complain, as locals do, but to a visitor, the Singapore MRT is first class."
,,Great public transport system,5.0,,"This public transport system is so well run - many other cities should take notice & copy, or at the very least improve towards the excellent standard of this system."
,,"Clean, Efficient, Affordable",4.0,,"My fiancee and I visited Singapore for a long weekend in October, 2017. We took mostly taxis when we would venture off of Sentosa Island where we stayed, but there was a few times when taxis were difficult to hail, or when taxis would start charging absurdly high rates for ""peak times."" In those times, we decided to try taking the Mass Rapid Transit.

As an American, I don't use public transportation much when I am at home, though I have used it plenty across Europe and Asia. I found the SMRT to be one of the easiest systems I have ever used. It took a few minutes to figure out the routes and which lines we needed to ride to get us to our desired destinations, but once the light bulb clicked, navigating the system was nearly effortless. A kid could figure out this system. It's also remarkably clean and at no time did I ever feel uncomfortable or threatened by the people riding. Singapore has harsh penalties for violating their laws, so crime is very, VERY low. Security on the SMRT is not an issue.

If you're just looking for a one-way trip or two, pay for each trip individually. If you are looking to make multiple trips around the city, look for the fare pass (I forget the official name for it) that allows unlimited daily, weekly, or monthly trips. You will save money that way.

Get out and see Singapore! It's a beautiful country and a beautiful city. If you can't afford or are having a hard time hailing a taxi and you want to get around town, the SMRT is your friend!"
,,Simple to use,5.0,,We usualy use public transport if available and in SG it was EASY. We bought a ticket at the airport and refill it once. You should pay attantion though: Mind the platform gap :) They are repeating this note at EACH stop. It is still deep inside my head.
,,Probably the best transport system I have ever used!,5.0,,"Not only is underground transport system very easy to use, it has to be the cleanest transport system I have ever used. It makes getting around the beautiful city of Singapore super easy. Would highly recommend."
,,train travel,5.0,,"The Singapore SMRT is a world class transport system it is also very clean and efficient, reliable and on time. Cost is very good with a trip from Changi Airport to Marina Bay Hotel Area costing S$1:95 Each Way A taxi for the same trip is S$25-S$35 each way."
,,3 Day Tourist Pass - Brilliant!,4.0,,"A lot of effort has gone into provided an efficient public transport system in order to reduce traffic congestion. We used the MRT extensively and would not have been able to see what we did without it. Once you master the colour-coded routes, it is not difficult to get about. Connecting trains and buses is also fairly straight forward.

Just keep in mind that this is a mass transit service and seats at peak times are at a premium."
,,Leading the world,5.0,,"Wow! Fantastic! Clean, efficient, regular and access is easy. We negotiated it with suitcases to the airport and had no problems. We nearly always got a seat. The locals treat the trains with respect. Having a no food and drink policy keeps the place tidy. One gripe is that everyone is head down on their mobile phones, not a lot of talking going on."
,,very good system,5.0,,"the system is clean, easy to use and with a good price level. many cities could learn something here"
,,Extremely efficient,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is quick, clean, efficient, easy to use and very good value for money. One of the best ways, if not the best, to get around Singapore. Love the top up cards that give you a small discount every time you re-use them."

,,"Fast, efficient and very cheap",5.0,,"MRT is the best way to move around Singapore. Very very cheap, announcements in 3 or 4 languages. There is a train every 3 - 5 minutes and the connections are convenient. The stations have good directional signs which makes it easy to find your way around. Clean."
,,very good ride,5.0,,fast travel economical safe comfortable station with escalators clean good amenities land and underground
,,Probably the best underground anywhere.,5.0,,This is immaculately clean and efficient and totally safe. A pleasure to travel on. The stations are well signposted and the system is easy to follow. Ticketing is easy.
,,Easy way to get around,4.0,,"We purchased the Tourist ticket for 3 days. Getting around without issues.Very clean and safe.
Only 4 stars because you need to return the tourist card after usage within a few days to get the deposit for the card back. Did not work for us due to our travel route."
,,An extremely efficient system,5.0,,This is an extremely efficient system which I made use of via the Singapore Tourist Pass which costs $10 per day plus a returnable $10 deposit. It was invaluable in helping me get to see many places quickly throughout Singapore.
,,"Easy to use, exceptionally clean",5.0,,"Several different lines cross many, but not areas of Singapore linking most of the key tourist attractions. Buy a card as this makes travel very cheap and you can also use it on the busses.
Air conditioned, clean stations and trains make this a great way to travel."
,,Cheap and easy transport,5.0,,"So easy and inexpensive to get around and see the city. Very quick, it doesn’t take too long to get used to it all :)"
,,Lousy System,1.0,,Always breaks down during peak hour. Try googling SMRT breakdown and you will find various news on it. Stupid people running the system
,,Best MRT,5.0,,SMRT is one of the best Public Transport System - possibly across the globe and they are further improving it.
,,Best way to roam Singapore,5.0,,"If you are planning to roam Singapore alone, this is the best method. There are lots of stations, and several lines connected together. Very easy and cheap to use."
,,Best Train System,5.0,,"So easy to use and made travelling around Singapore so simple.Purchased an Ezi Link ticket which we topped up.Could not believe how clean these trains and stations were. Puts our Aussie system to shame. The most we waited for any train was seven minutes.
We even opted for the MRT from our city accommodation to the airport."
,,World Class System,5.0,,"Love the EZ-link card. Together with Google Maps, and SMRT app, I got around with ease, used buses to get to places in between SMRT stops. Only time the card did not work was my fault - need training to tap the card lol."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Is easy and accessible... Is linked to almost all part of Singapore ... MRT station is linked to alot of shopping centre, signage are everywhere. U won't get lost"
,,Very clean and efficient,5.0,,"I was surprised to see the MRT as being one of the 'things to do' in Singapore. Despite ferrying tons of people around every day it's clean, spacious, on time and good value."
,,Train service always breaks down,1.0,,Was stuck in the train station for 30 minutes. The delays are becoming as frequent as once a day. A real sorry state of affairs
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"The MRT is Easy to use, its very clean and safe. A quick way to move around Singapore. great experience in peak hour"
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Cheap, efficient, easy. Don’t buy the tourist pass, it is better value to buy the reloadable card and return it for the deposit refund when done"
,,Three day tourist pass,5.0,,"Purchased a three day tourist pass at the airport for $20 + $10 deposit, the MRT is very well organised and easy to understand which made it easy to navigate around Singapore. It covers most of the city and made getting to places hassle free. You will need to stand at busy times but people are courteous and the stations are very clean. Try to book accommodation near a MRT station so you can go direct from the airport."
,,Awesome,4.0,,"Easy to use, clean and you can go to any place you want with this transport system. From airport to our hotel, from hotel to Bugis Street, from hotel to Marina Bay, from our hotel to everywhere!"
,,Great transport system get a EZ link card,5.0,,"I was staying 27km away from the airport
Walked off the plane through border control downstairs to the train ticket office
Because I was staying more than a few days didn’t think $10 unlimited travel pass would be worth it, so bought their travel card which costs $12 loaded already with $7 to use, traveled over a hour on the train and 20 mins on my bus to my destination all for $1.70. About a British pound or just over a dollar, great public transport system, easy to use and great value for money, can’t recommend it enough"
,,Best facility,5.0,,"The most organized, well maintained and easy to use facility which helps us a oot to travel almost anywhere in Singapore. Highly recommended."
,,Highly accessible,5.0,,Seems all exits have escalators up and down. Very good for commuters and tourists with suitcases. Very clean everywhere. Just need some time to understand how the tickets work.

,,Cheap and Massive system,5.0,,"My first time to Singapore, but were already impressive with their SMRT. It is cheap and very convenient. The good part is they keep improving and expanding their system so that it benefits both the local and the tourist.

Like their city, the trains are well maintain and clean, perhaps this is due to their strict rules and penalties. Everyone is polite and well behavior, they respect the seniors and those people who needs a seat.

Overall, I am really impressive with the SMRT."
,,So good,5.0,,We got a three day pass for this which made life so much easier as you just get on an off as you please. The map is set out great. And the trains were like every 3 or so mins..i would travel this way rather than book tours. Do things at your own pace.
,,EASY,5.0,,"No matter how long you are staying in Singapore 1day, 3days or 5... get yourself a tourist pass to use the rail... it made getting around this beautiful city soo easy and it's decently priced!! The trains run super frequently as well... the maximum time we waited for a train was 3 minutes :)."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,First time for us in Singapore and we found the MRT system so easy to use. We were so impressed with how clean and efficient it was and it is a clear five star experience in our opinion.
,,Singapore mrt,5.0,,"The easiest way to get around Singapore without a doubt. On time very clean and inexpensive. Tourists can buy a 1,2 or 3 day unlimited pass with a refund given when expired."
,,Absolutely the way to go,5.0,,Busses and trains were great. Clean and on time. The cheapest easy way to travel in Singapore. Not expensive. You can top up your pass card easily at train stations.
,,"Clean, fast, super organised. You dont need taxis -goes almost anywhere",5.0,,"Got a tourist pass for the days we stayed. $s26 each with $10 refund when handed back. Fantastic underground network goes almost anywhere you will need to go. Its very easy to navigate and use. Fast and efficient. Love the fully enclosed tunnel at the station with stainless steel frame, glass panels and glass doors that open and close for train access and egress. No chance of falling or being pushed onto tracks. 100% safe unlike our underground in perth, what there is of it."
,,Tourist Pass Is Awesome,5.0,,We spent 3 days in Singapore and used the SMRT a lot. Purchased a 3 day tourist card that allowed us unlimited rides during our stay. We took it everywhere. Safe and clean rail system. Would definitely recommend!

,,"Awesome System and so, so Clean",5.0,,This is a great system to help you get around Singapore. The environment is modern and clean and information clear and accessible. Get a NEST. Card for easy travel (like Oyster in London)
,,Fantastic transport service,5.0,,"Not sure why this is on trip advisor as its not an attraction itself, just a fantastic, clean, efficient transport system! Probably the best i've been on in the world and very good value for money."
,,Excellent Service,5.0,,Very Quick and easy service to the city from airport. Not much expensive and clean and tidy train which is ontime usually
,,Rudeness at it's worst.,1.0,,"I am 70 years old, my wife is 69 and uses a walking aid, and yet the "" priority"" seats on the MRT, which are supposed to be for the elderly, pregnant women, people with young kids or disabled folk are usually occupied by young able bodied persons who pretend to be sleeping. The concept of queuing is not observed by all Singaporeans. They block the train doors and can become quite aggressive if asked to move. I think that the MRT is fine if you are in a hurry and are young and able-bodied, but the buses are more civilised if you don't mind a longer journey. Not all Singaporeans ignore the priority seating, and some really good at offering their seat to the needy, but the ignorant ones give others a bad name."
,,Superb transport system,5.0,,"The best way to move around in Singapore. Punctual, clean and inexpensive. Most stations in the city limit have connections to the malls. Many routes and inter-connection making it easier to move to many direction of Singapore."
,,Best way to get quickly around Singapore,5.0,,Very easy to use quick efficient economical way to get around Singapore. You can buy a 3 day unlimited use tourist card from several central stations ( not all) I’ve bought mine always at Chinatown station. Some stations are huge but the signage is great . You could alternatively buy a normal travel card & top it up. There’s free clean toilets in all main stations ( possibly all but I’m just not sure) Just do it & for my London friends Singapore escalators you stand on the LEFT not the right as you do in London Underground .Highly recommend using the MRT to get around.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"One of the best public transport systems in the world. Great connectivity, affordable and user friendly."
,,Clean,5.0,,Just wow! Every other city underground system should learn how to it. No litter. Very clean. Very safe

,,A lesson to other cities on how to do public transport,5.0,,"Cheap, frequent, clean, safe, comprehensive and easy for the traveller to navigate. Minor gripe, a rapid Airport link to the centre and it would be superlative rather than just plain excellent"
,,Best Public Transport System for a Tourist in Singapore,5.0,,"With a 3 day Tourist MRT Card (Available at Changi Airport and select MRT stations for SGD 20+ Refundable SGD10 Deposit), MRT makes the commute in Singapore convenient at a very reasonable price. All the major tourist spots can be reached with ease.. Excellent Experience.."

,,Holiday,5.0,,"Well we did the MRT
Thing got our top up card never would you ever see such an awsome thing sooooo cheap we went heaps places on bus train s & taxi bum boat used taxis also so so clean people help very easy to follow were you want tongo"
,,Absolutely Amazing!,5.0,,"This is the first time I’ve reviewed a subway system as a tourist attraction, but it thoroughly deserves to be treated as such. There was a new station round the corner from our hotel and it had been planned on a grand scale with four sequential escalators taking us down to the platforms (surprisingly cool) and the fast, efficient and driverless trains. There appeared to be a queueing system to board trains at peak times and twice Other travellers stood up to offer this elderly gentleman their seat."
,,"Punctual, Clean & Good",5.0,,This is a very smart way of getting around Singapore. The fare is very reasonable (considering how expensive Singapore is) and very punctual and reliable too. Each wagon is kept in a spick-and-span manner and very user friendly too. It will bring you to majority of the tourist point in Singapore.
,,Simple,5.0,,"Easy to use public transport Extremely clean, rapid and cheap Once you've mastered the ""lines"" there will be no stopping you"
,,Singapore Long Weekend,5.0,,The Mass Transit system is world class. Easy to figure out how to get to around and very clean and efficient.
,,Great way getting around,3.0,,A good transport system for tourist to be easily getting around yet expect to have breakdown as Smrt is famous for it. Typically avoid peak hours like 6pm - 7pm which is the peak period for train services and breakdown timing.
,,So easy,5.0,,"Buy a prepaid card with US $ 12 ( deposit $ 5 and $ 7 to use) that you can use for many days to get around Singapore. Download Singapore MRT app before you go. China town, Little India and many many places. There is NO bad food in Singapore so enjoy your stay."
,,Convenient,5.0,,"Essential part of ones stay in Singapore. It is synced with Google Maps. So one does not have to worry about knowing where to board which train. Don't need to carry the Old Maps for navigation.

However, entry and exit would entail a lot of walking.

EZ-Link card is issued at price if 12 SGD with 05 SGD of non refundable amount. Minimum recharge is of 10 SGD in kiosks available in every amount. The balance amount in the card can be redeemed on return of card."
,,wide and clean,5.0,,"Much wider compared with Japanese train.Most passengers are friendly, they give their seats to our little kids, even they're not sitting the reserved seat.
The staff of train station helped us a lot, they explained the train details and advised us which train is for us to take.
Very good experience in Singapore."
,,The way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to use, very affordable way to bring you anywhere in Singapore within walking distance. A multi-day pass is 10 S$ (incl. 5 S$ fare value) and can be easily topped at all MRT stations."
,,Excellent Easy way To Get Around,5.0,,"The MRT is fantastic. Easy to learn to use. Nice and air conditioned when it’s so hot and humid out. The maps of the area when you exit the station are super helpful. You always wonder which way to go when you get off a subway but their coded maps and labeled exits (A, B, C, etc) makes it real easy to not feel lost: we just did single trip pays and it worked fine; it’s very cheap to ride like 1.40 to 2sd is all."
,,Fast and Efficient. Shame it stops at Midnight,4.0,,"My family and I enjoyed using the MRT subway to get around Singapore. Once you have bought your prepaid card it is very fast and efficient getting in and out. The lines are colour coded and it is very easy to find the best route from a to b using the maps in the stations (or the mini version in your pocket)

The most tricky part is figuring out which exit to use so that you emerge in the right street!

There were a few occasions when I needed to travel after midnight and the trains were no longer running. This is the only negative I have."
,,Great way to get around.,5.0,,"The metro is brilliant, so easy and clean. If you plan to use it a lot get a tourist pass, but be aware you have to claim your 10 dollars back before 9 pm if you are leaving early next day."
,,Perfect for getting about,4.0,,"Easy to use and runs like a clock... buy a ticket at machine chose your destination, insert coins and you are away... take a pocket full of coins as machines wont take notes greater than 5sgd on most fares....

Colour coordinated and simple to follow... only issue is coming out of station... find site map and chose exit before proceeding to far... guatentee if you dont youll come upto street at wrong point....

Safe simple and fast.... perfect way to travel..."
,,Redefined the meaning of convenience!,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is definitely a cheap, fast and convenient way of traveling around this island nation. The trains are clean, the stations are easily accessible via its multiple entrances, and the frequency of the trains is second to none. The connectivity is astounding, with virtually all attractions here within a short walk from the MRT. The MRT system is truly the blood vessel of this developed nation."
,,Easiest way to get around town,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is the best way to get around. It's easy to use, especially if you buy a pass. You can then use the metro and buses to reach a variety of places. If you have trouble finding a metro, they typically are located in the basement of major malls. Sometimes the signage isn't posted on the street; just ask a friendly local and you'll get directions."
,,"Easy, easy, easy......",5.0,,"The SMRT is easy to use, easy to navigate, easy to get around the city and suburbs. Purchased a $20 (+10 refundable ticket deposit), this gave us unlimited use on the trains and buses for 3 days (you could also get 1 and 2 day passes). We used it every day to get to sites and then at nights to get to different places for dinner. After the card has expired you can return it to the station for a $10 refund. Excellent value and well worth it. Highly recommended."
,,Effective and clean transport.,5.0,,"Use this for your local transport, even to and from the airport. Great low-cost alternative to sightseeing buses. Seems they run every 2-3 mins, no waiting."
,,A great way to travel,5.0,,"The first day I rode the subway, I was with a Singapore native. She taught me how to read the subway map, and we transferred multiple times through our course of sightseeing on Day #1. After that introduction, I was on my own and found it to be a very user friendly system. I purchased lunch one day from a small subway restaurant, and it was delicious and extremely reasonable. The trains are extremely clean and the service is efficient. It's a great way to travel throughout the city!"
,,Convenient and Cheap,5.0,,"The MRT is one of the best way to get around Singapore on a budget, private taxis may get you to your destination faster but costs a bomb!
MRT takes slightly longer but the routes are very easy to understand, all platforms and trains are clearly marked and color coded as per the lines you have to take.
There’s a MRT app available which you can use too and then there’s always google to know which is the nearest MRT station to the place you wanna go to. Normally all tourist attractions have nearest public conveyance stations mentioned on their website so do check it out.

If you are planning to use the MRT for you travel then keep extra time in hand , get a MRT map, do some research and plan your routes, you shouldn’t have much of a problem getting around to any place."
,,Poor maintenance and frequent breakdown,1.0,,"With current spates of noshow and breakdown in mrt, tourists are discouraged to take the train, especially rushing for airport departure. Train services are very unreliable due to poor management of train operator and staff sabotages."
,,Impressive,5.0,,"What an impressive system!
As a tourist, it can be nerve-racking to attempt using public transport however the MRT was pretty easy once you understood the basics. So clean, efficient, affordable, reliable and quick.
Why waste your money on taxis in Singapore when you can use the MRT!"
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,Very fast and frequent service. Nicely managed No food and drinks allowed. Full use of technology. Locals are blessed to have it.
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap. Best way to get around Singapore",5.0,,"I have been a regular business visitor to Singapore for the past 10 years and always relied on taxis for getting around.
Today I decided to use the MRT during rush hour and what a great pleasure it was to use.
The trains are very clean and frequent, the pricing incredibly cheap. It was easy to get around, even when I had two changes to make.
At one station I was looking a little lost and from nowhere a security guard appeared and led me to where I needed to be.
The behaviour of the passengers on the train was exemplary, making the whole thing a stress free experience."
,,The cleanest and most efficient MRT,5.0,,"The SMRT is as good as it can get, convenient, efficient, cost effective and very safe means of seeing this lovely City."
,,Easy!,5.0,,"This transit system was very easy to navigate. I had never been to Singapore before and I had no problems reading the system amps and figuring out where to go and how to get there, even when I had to change trains.
It is much easier to get the refillable card as opposed to buying an individual ticket for each trip. All of the main attractions are connected to a stop so it makes it very convenient!"
,,Cheap way to get around.,5.0,,"The MRT can get you to where ever you need to go, and it is very clean and cheap. I was there for over three weeks and I think it cost me a total of $18.00 and we used it almost every day I was there."
,,"Its still super clean, efficient and cheap",5.0,,"Nearly 2 years on from my original review the MRT remains, super clean, efficient and cheap. Get yourself an easy link card, top it up with some cash and away you go, no need for change, tap and go. For less than a taxi fare from Changi Airport into the city you can have all you transport for a week covered, including the MRT journey from the Airport. Changi is on a spur of the green line, you do have to change but its a simple cross the platform change."
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,"The SMRT is reliable, frequent, and inexpensive. It can be very crowded during commuting times, but it’s hands down the best way to get around Singapore."
,,Mass Rapid Transit Sing,5.0,,The trains are very clean and the system is very efficient. If you miss one train another is not far away. An in-expensive way to get around.
,,Transport,5.0,,"The SMRT. Is the most easy way to get around in Singapore ,it is an excellent rail system always on time and is easy to navigate ,it’s also very safe and extremely clean ."
,,Easiest Way to get around in SG,5.0,,"Once you have a transport pass you and charge some amount on it you can tap in an out most of the public transport in Singapore, yes even the Taxi. For Tourist best I would say. Avoid the rush hours in the Morning and be aware that the MRT does not operate 24hrs. For Night you need to look out for Night Buses.

I use this transport every day :)"
,,Efficient and quick way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Used MRT extensively for 7 days I was in Singapore. Used EZ Link card. Except during peak times in few routes, the MRT isn't crowded most of times so you can travel peacefully."
,,Quick Cheap and Easy,5.0,,"The only way to travel in Singapore - i have never felt so safe on public transport in my life!! and if you miss one, dont worry another is only a couple of minutes behind"
,,"fast, good value and so easy",4.0,,Singapore is a relatively small island and so travel should be quick and it definitely was. Get a card (admin of $5) and away you go. It is very busy at peak times. All the tourist sites are maybe 1 or 2 stations away from the suburbs. Do not shy away - go for it!
,,An example to other city planners,5.0,,"The MRT system is well laid out and so easy for a tourist to get to grips to. There are maps everywhere, stations have escalators and lifts, the ticket machines / card top-up machines are easy to use and the stations are so large and clean too!

Trains are clean and have plenty of space (and seats, unless it's peak time). They start up with a jerk and brake quite hard too, so hold on but they move fairly fast and get you to your destination quickly. Ample warning when the doors are closing too.

Of coursed, this is also helped by how orderly the Singaporeans have become, and appreciate the videos in the train that promote social niceties such as giving up your seat for those who need it more, keeping your bags on the floor to increase space, etc..."
,,Amazing Transit System,5.0,,"It's funny speaking to some of my family living in Singapore, they complain that the transit system isn't very good. But compared to Vancouver, it is an incredible transit system.

It is punctual, clean and reaches to many parts of interest in the city. Great bus connections from all stations."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Buy a tourist pass for the public transport system available at most train stations and airport it has a ten dollar deposit , you get that back when you hand it back in.The SMRT system has stations at most if not all the attractions and you can use the buses as well."
,,So Efficient,5.0,,"On our recent trip to Singapore our family of five found the MRT amazing for getting around. We used it every day. We bought the regular ticket (not the tourist one) and paid as little as 77 cents for quite long off peak journeys. The roads in the city are totally clogged all the time and taxis would have been prohibitive. At peak times the trains are incredibly full (so if you don't like crowds, better to travel at off peak times) but if one is totally full the next is only minutes away. We mainly used the North/South and Downtown lines, although we did travel out of the city to the zoo and other places and used a combination of trains and buses on those trips. We were in Singapore for ten days and the total cost of our trips was somewhere around $35 each.Coming from Christchurch, New Zealand we were not familiar with light rail but soon learnt our way around. Some of the stations are huge, with many levels, but if you get lost any staff member is only too willing to set you on the right track. GIVE IT A GO."
,,Practical,5.0,,"We can go anywhere using this SMRT. Very cheap, rapidly and the card can be used also for the bus. There are many SMRT in singapore & I love to use it....👍"
,,Mrt singapore,5.0,,Amazing transport system. Bought a transit pass from 7/11. $10 which included $5 transport. Easy to top up at stations.
,,SMRT,5.0,,"It is very effective kind of transport in Singapore. Clean, fast and cheap. You can go from one point to other one easily."
,,Mrt,5.0,,"First thing we do is buy a 3 days tourist card Cost in total 30 S$ , (you get back 10 dollar) A great way to go around the city for almost no cost"
,,Good Transport System,4.0,,"Having 6 lines,the MRT is a major transport system and spanning the entire city state. It's very convenient way to access to any places or attractions in Singapore, and is very clean,fast and punctually."
,,Always on time!,4.0,,"The greatest thing about this transport system is their time management. If i could suggest, unlimited time for the card with certain deposit fund will increase public awareness of using the card instead of standard ones. (As the current card needs to be extended after some years)"
,,Simple and cheap with a top up card,5.0,,Made our stay in Singapore much more relaxing because both the Metro and the buses were simple to use and went everywhere we could have wanted. Great value and so simple to use with a top up card for several days.
,,"Convenient, good value",5.0,,"Extensive network. Easy to use, clean, air conditioned. A great way to get around the city. Easy to purchase tickets too."
,,Very convenient,5.0,,I usually taxi in Singapore but this time used the MRT and found quite easy. They take a deposit of 10 cent and you can use it up to 6 time and then being reimbursed.
,,Worth to try the MRT system once....,4.0,,Can be a little confusing .... Thankfully we were with our friends that insist we try the MRT System once.
,,World class Public Transport,4.0,,"Singaporeans take the SMRT for granted as they are used to high availability of no errors and delays in their day to day life. SMART is in a class of its own when compared to any competing operation in other world cities. The cleanliness and the thought process for comfort are unparalleled in comparison to first world countries and are light years ahead when compared with the transport systems in Asia. Yes they have some maintenance concerns coming up now with delays and errors creeping in but as they say, Form is temporary but class is permanent."
,,Incredible efficient train network,5.0,,"I often visit Singapore to see family from have no hesitation using the mrt. It is cheap, efficient and trains are very frequent. Additional lines are always being added as well making the network far reaching"
,,Fantastic service,5.0,,"The public transport system is amazing. Clean, punctual, orderly, regular, no car needed!
Buy a transit pass and top it up as required. They make it so easy. Get a map to work out your directions - I got on going in the wrong direction a few times but easy to get off at the next stop and turn around, as there are such regular services. Check about your train availability after midnight, as it stops!
Fares are very affordable."
,,When is it working?,2.0,,"Many a times it just failed. Considering that Singapore is world class standard in most stuff, this system puts to shame. Excuses has been made for the frequent breakdowns by the company and government officials. The trains are overly crowded on peak periods but not frequent enough in off peak period. When will they ever improve?"
,,Reliable?,5.0,,"Undoubtedly Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is one of the world best transportation means, reliable, efficient and affordable. Cabins are clean. Air circulation is well accommodated. The infrastructure of train lines cover is well built to reach most major city points. Needless to say it is crowded during rush hours but one still can easily manage to get into the train to reach one's desired destination."
,,"Always dependable, always available, always pleasant",5.0,,"Yes, it may at peak times be packed, but the ease of travel provided, the consistency and dependability of the service, the cleanliness of the coaches, the politeness and considerateness of one's fellow travelers combine to make this my favorite, above those in any other city."
,,good transport system,5.0,,We had an mrt station just around the corner from our hotel from which we could access all the main attractions within 15/20 min. The stations and trains are clean and comfortable with air con and a pleasure to travel on.
,,Excellent,5.0,,The mrt is very nice.people really follow the rules.no smoking or even eating in the mrt.the direction in each station is really clear and the officer is really friendly any helpful.can't wait to return!two thumbs up!
,,Clean and super efficient,5.0,,"This is the way to get around when visiting Singapore.
Relatively cheap way to travel and stations at all the major sites.
Trains are very clean and the aircon is amazing.
Always on time and availability is guaranteed.
The best in it’s class in the world."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,The train are easy to use . If you are not sure how to use the machines to buy a ticket go to the counter as they all speak English and buy a ticket from there. They are very helpful and give you a map to get around . The machines have English so you put that in first press on map which give you in alphabetical order were you want to go then how many tickets the price comes up next you put in your coins or notes and it spits out your ticket with the change if you need it . The trains inside tell you your destination and when to change lines to another line
,,Amazing Easy,5.0,,This is a very easy method of getting around the city. As expected the system map and ticketing procedure is extremely straightforward and logical. There are plenty of helpful staff at each station to assist with issues you might have. Sometimes the entry to stations are not well signed and can be hard to find. Cheap and brilliant way to get from A to B stress free.
,,Singapore city train,4.0,,"Usually quite efficient and on time. Avoid during office hours, super packed back to back. Most stations are located near shopping centres or local attractions."
,,Nice subway with lots of limitations to get the tourist pass or pay with Card,3.0,,"The subway is fast and reliable, however, I was expecting much more from a 1st world subway, hence my rating.

You can't pay with credit card in the ticket machines (in some places there are no ATM around you, good luck with that).
Staff (airport, Chinatown, Clarke quay and a few other stations) are rude and not interested in helping you.
Tourist pass is provided by another company so you can't buy it everywhere but (Airport and Chinatown.. I think somewhere else but not sure where). In Chinatown station the ticket office has a staff shift change which means you might have to wait 30-45 mins for someone to show up (I think it is around 12:30 when they change). We had a problem with the card, in another office, and we had to buy a normal ticket to come back Chinatown station to sort out the issue because the other offices are not responsible for the tourist pass. And remember to return it when you are back to the airport or you will lose the refund.

other than that, super clean, fast and amazing A/C"
,,Train Availability,1.0,,"Similar to the public telecommunication (99.999% up time) business, public transportation availability is crucial to the public. I propose MRT train availability benchmark be set at least 99.9% up time."
,,when you're travelling light and solo,4.0,,"The cheapest option to explore the S city, when you're travelling light & solo then choose no other. Kids commute free with the SMRT special pass, grab it at the designated station, you only need show your kid(s) passport."
,,Lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,This is one of the best managed Train system I ever found in the world. Hats off to the authorities to keep it running hassle free.
,,So easy to get around and get the tourist pass,5.0,,"There are new stops that have opened making it even easier to get to SMRT. I was staying in Clark Quay and often took the Fort Canning station. So new and clean. Went to Botanical Gardens, Chinatown, Downtown, Little India, Kompang Glam, etc. plus you can get unlimited rides of MRT and buses using the tourist pass. Pick 1-3 days of use. Highly recommend."
,,MRT way to go!,4.0,,"Great way to go it’s very cheap, super easy, fast and trains are always in time. Great way to get around the busy city."
,,The only way to get around Singapore!,5.0,,"When my husband and I visited Singapore for a holiday, and not a stop over, around two years ago, we became slightly acquainted with the SMRT public transport system and realised how inexpensive, clean, fast and frequent the trains were. We didn’t try the bus services as we thought the trains were going to be challenge enough!

Once you get the hang of which station you need to start from and where you want to go everything else is even easier!

We returned this September and the 3 day travel pass is currently $30 and you get $10 back when you hand in your card at the end! If you need it longer, you can extend for another 3 days at a time. We caught the bus from Singapore Zoo to the SMRT hub at Ang Mo Kio to take in some shopping and have lunch. Places we wouldn’t normally know to visit yet we had a great time and met some lovely local people in the process. We even caught the train to the airport with all our baggage and it was so easy!"
,,MRT is not efficient enough,2.0,,"I used to take the MRT because is fast and saved time. These days I will try not to take the train especially during peak hours. The North South Line is the most unreliable, most of the time is delayed and very crowded and seems the air condition is not cold enough therefore sometime is stuffy.

Now with the new system which have more information though, but with spelling mistake of the road/place e.g. Thye Hua Kwan Hospital.

MRT should be more efficient as it is an important mode of transportation in Singapore."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"The SMRT in Singapore is affordable and easy to use as a tourist. It is also extremely efficient, never having to wait more than a few minutes for the next train."
,,The coolest & quickest way to get around,5.0,,"I use the MRT every time I visit Singapore. Other than for Changi Airport transfers where it is inconvenient with luggage, the MRT is fast, clean, safe and normally reliable. My local contacts tell me that it suffers delays but that has never been my experience."
,,Very Good,4.0,,I found using the SMRT much easier than I thought it would be. The trains are very clean and the information is very user friendly. It makes getting round Singapore quick although you do miss out on seeing many of the sights this way.
,,Great way to explore Singapore,4.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore, MRT very frequent and lots of stops. Fairly cheap for trips but if there for several days then can purchase a tourist pass to get around of MRT and Buses."
,,Easiest way to get around,5.0,,"This without a doubt is the best way to get around singapore, we were first time users of any subway system and couldn't believe how easy it was all you need is the mrt map and a idea of where you want to go and its get on and go the cost is very cheap you can pay day to day but its best to get a permanent card put on how much you want and redeem the remaining balance at the airport when you leave brilliant singapore you got this so right"
,,Best way of transport,5.0,,"The best way of transportation and probably my most used while living there for 2 years. Busses are great but I️ always seemed to get on the wrong one. The SMRT is clean, reliable, fast and located everywhere to get u to where you want to go. Tickets are cheap, probably $0.80-$1.30 depending where u want to go."
,,Very orderly and easy to use,5.0,,"The MRT and bus service in Singapore is excellent. We paid for a 3 day tourist pass and got $10 back for each ticket/card at the end, which we did at the airport. Everything was on time. There are maps everywhere that are easy to follow. Everything seemed clean. Staff and people in general are on hand and keen to help."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Locals complained a lot about the system but first hand experience I have is favourable. It is clean, effjcient, safe and reliable. Visitots can feel at ease to use it."
,,Much Maligned But Needs Time to Settle,4.0,,"Twenty years or so ago when the subway system opened to much acclaim, the trains operated quite smoothly. Over the years with poorer QC standards and inevitable wear and tear - all of which seemed to snowball at once, breakdowns became more frequent and recently, some tracks were flooded due to poor maintenance of pumps.

For the average Singaporean, hey have to ‘grin and bear’ it. The bus system is overcrowded and the trains are a necessity.

Whither the future? With the amount of resources already pumped in and allocated, there is no going back.

I’m convinced that proper oversight will sort out the problems though it may take years more than months. The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit System has to learn from their mistakes, get the proper people in at the top and move forward with alacrity."
,,Convenient to travel but crowded,3.0,,"MRT covers most of the areas in Singapore. The train fares are reasonably priced compared to taxis. However, most times the trains are packed so comfort should not be considered when taking the MRT. Otherwise, it still serves the passengers decently well with exception of train faults and breakdowns which could potentially increase travel time by an unknown amount."
,,Train in Singapore,4.0,,Pro: cheap and inexpensive way to get around Singapore. Almost all places of interest generally has a station close by Cons: avoid peak hours.
,,"Easy, convinient and easy to hang around",5.0,,"Daily commute option for most of the Singaporean as well as tourist. It connects most of the tourists attractions as well as neighborhoods areas - shopping mall, local favorites food center, government office and center business destrict.

You can purchase single trip tickets in more expensive form like most of the places and countries or multiple entry ticket in card form, credit control by depends how much you top up and remaining credit will be showing each time you tap in and out from the station gantry.

Come and experience this most convinient travel option if you travel in Singapore."
,,Fabulous rail and bus system,5.0,,"Very easy system to work out as its all colour coded ..blue line, purple line and so on. Trains are so clean. Your travel card is for trains and buses and you can get another type which included taxis. It's really a great system and very regular trains. We hardly had to wait longer than 5 minutes. Give it a go!"
,,Good & Bad,2.0,,"have been breaking down frequently due to stupid reasons given by the ministers. definitely clean. easy to use, easily accessible, can get you to wherever you want in Singapore. Quite expensive, one ride (regardless of distance or amount of stops) cost at least around S$0.77. More stops/longer distance, more expensive. sometimes taking uber/grab (with promo), is cheaper."
,,To work place,4.0,,Pleasant and smooth ride. Cooling on a hot day. It takes a faster ride than the bus especially when you are in a hurry. That's all I can say.
,,Uncertainty,1.0,,"Trains have been breaking down so frequently that I was so happy when I alight at my destination.
Too crowded, trip was not comfortable.
Crowd control is almost non existence.
Staff looks like they are chatting more than helping out to control the crowd. Many foreigners who do not observe local culture n practices created some in convenience and unpleasantness occasionally.
Would either stay home or take uber the next time."
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Very efficient and convenient to use. Always on time and provides access to most parts of Singapore. Best to get a prepaid card for daily use.
,,Best way to commute in Singapore,5.0,,"We visited Singapore for a week and took a Tourist pass(Valid for 3 days) for $30 ($10 is refunded when the pass is returned) and it was total worth it as we could take both MRT as well as buses there with this one pass. The MRT stations and the trains are extremely clean, safe and easy to use."
,,"Fast, efficient, immaculately clean",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system transports people quickly and cheaply all over the island. The system is efficient, carriages are modern, air-conditioned and regular with trains depart ing every 4 minutes. The Singapore Day pass for tourists is useful at $20. The card includes a $10 refundable deposit and unlimited travel for the day. Can be used on the buses as well as on the MRT. Top quality service that is well patronised."
,,Easiest way to move around in Singapore,4.0,,MRT system is on par with Hong Kong and Japan. Connection with Shopping malls and eateries are good.
,,Travelling by Singapore Metro,4.0,,Singapore MRT is very convenient way of going places and quite comfortable. Directions are eay to follow. Buying a weekly MRT ticket or a MRT card is useful. Amount deducted in 1 $ for every trip starting from any place to any other place.
,,Singapore travel,1.0,,"My first time travelling around the city of Singapore .
I must say I was so impressed by the infrastructure around the city.
Using the MRT was easy and you can access anywhere you need to go using it.
The MRT is simple but purchasing your pass you can use the trains and buses all around Singapore .
Good luck on your travels"
,,So easy to use and so clean,5.0,,"The MRT system in Singapore is one of the best ways to get around the city.
It's faster than taking a bus to get to some areas.
We took the MRT from the national stadium to marina bay station, it's a short walk to the station from the stadium,
But it is one of the easiest ways to get back.
Some MRT stations have shops and food courts which are very convenient.
Stay in line to get in!
You could buy a one two or three day pass if you are taking multiple trips"
,,Clean and cheap transportation,4.0,,like the usual MRTs around the world. A very cheap travel option considering the peak hour traffic on roads and the expensive taxis. Usually very crowded around the rush hours.
,,Best way to get around the city,4.0,,"The MRT is reasonable, clean, on time and has excellent signage. It's easy to navigate and hits many of the tourist stops. Its the best way to get around the city."
,,Singapore Transportation Aystem.,5.0,,"Clean, safe and efficient train and bus system. This is the easiest and best way to get around Singapore!"
,,excellent transport system,5.0,,"High frequency, clean and safe. Improvements to cover all areas of Singapore in progress. Green line can be extremely busy."
,,Singapore MRT for ease of train system,5.0,,"Thank you Singapore MRT for your ease of train system and allowing a tourist (me!) to easily understand your system.

I was easily able to understand the MRT station to my visit to Singapore and learn where I was able to hop on and off and transfer to another coloured MRT line. Even using the pay station to get a ticket was easy to use."
,,Unreliable when you most need it,1.0,,"Approximate Mean distance travelled before distruption:

Taipei: 810,000 km.
Hong Kong: 370,000 km
Singapore: 180,000 km

Not impressive considering when Singapore likes to compare with the best. Recently the rail tunnels flooded which resulted in a major suspension of Service. That’s shocking & unheard of in modern times. If one has a choice, I would avoid this mode of transport in fear of drowning or electrocution!

Singaporeans have been complaining for more than 10 years; yet Management seems to have great difficulty resolving their numerous disruptions with monotonous regularity. They have repeatly reassured commuters, but has Fallen on deaf ears as there has been no meaningful improvement; where the Asian benchmarks of MRT efficiency way excel Singapore’s track record by multiple folds.

It’s shameful for a country that prides itself as one of the worlds most efficient countries."
,,The Worse System,1.0,,Every day train breaks down or delay. The system is really sucks. Singapore is a small country. The number of cars has to be low. Yet the only MRT system is Singapore is so lousy.
,,Convenient and safe,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is one of the best public transportation system in the world. Be it travel, work or leisure, everything is very well connected across Singapore, thanks to the MRT!"
,,Easy and very accessible transport,4.0,,"Very accessible and convenient transport. With new lines added, it’s make almost more easier commuters to move around. Remember to avoid office hours, 7-9am and 5-7pm it’s crowded. Enjoy the train ride."
,,Take only if you have time to spare,2.0,,Train system is good and brings you to most parts of Singapore. However try to refrain from taking it if you are rushing to the airport/ferry as the train may delay/breakdown. Take only if you have extra time to spare. Set off early is always a better choice as its better to be early than not to even reach at all.....
,,clean .. convenient .. reasonably priced.. but very crowded during peak periods and difficult to get seats ..,4.0,,"Generally clean as no food and drinks are allowed.
Fan are installed in most stations to keep the area well ventilated.
conveniently located which can bring u to different parts of singapore .. and most of the attractions ..
fastest transport if there is jam on the road ..
family with strollers or wheelchairs is easier if taking a train comparing to buses or car..

improvement of the trains and system is always ongoing..
even had a whatsapp number to report any fault or feedbacks.

Peak hours are crowded and not easy to squeeze in at some of the stations.. if possible avoid bringing kids out during the peak hours..

however due to old tracks ..Train breaks down avg once to twice a month .."
,,MRT is a breeze!,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is an excellent way to get around Singapore. It is cheap, clean, safe and efficient, with an extensive network that is ever expanding. If you are in Singapore for a week or more, get an EZ link card and you can use this on both the trains and the buses. Just remember to tap off when you leave a bus, otherwise it will charge you the maximum fare. The card can also be used for the light rail from Vivo City to Sentosa."
,,A great network that keeps growing,4.0,,Singapore's public transport network is one of the best - in the region but most probably also on international scale. The combination of feeder busses and SMRT stations across the nation allows to get nearly everywhere without individual transport - conveniently. And the network keeps growing.
,,"Reliable, cheap, clean and easy to use",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is very easy to use. It's still expanding, but now already covers most areas you want to visit.
Best is to buy a cash card at the station or any 7-11 in the city. Add value is also easy. At the 7-11 (cost S$ 0,50) or at the train station.
To use the card just check in and check out at the gates."
,,3 day tourist card,5.0,,"At S$30 each this is good value and convenient. Any unused value is refunded as well as the S$10 deposit on the card. Was disappointed that Visa cards not accepted, MasterCard or cash only."
,,Convenient with Singapore Tourist Pass,5.0,,"I bought a Singapore Tourist Pass Plus before arriving Singapore and exchanged the pass at Changi Airport. The pass covers all the public transportations, such as buses and MRT trains. I used the train to go everywhere in Singapore; it has stops at all major tourist spots, such as Chinatown, Marina Bay, Bayfront, City Center, Bugis, etc.

The pass is great. US$27.95 (S$38) comes with unlimited public transportation access and an half-hour guided tour at the Kampang Glam area. Highly recommend!"
,,"Extensive, reasonable and easy to use",5.0,,"The MRT or underground systems is pretty extensive and very cheap to use. Its clean, and well maintained. and the trains run frequently. we used the MRT for most of our journeys during our stay. But do follow the local customs, the priority seats are meant for the elderly , pregnant or parents with very young children. Its disturbing to see foreigners, seating on such seats and not offering them up for those in need. The fit locals avoid seating on them even during busy periods."
,,Good way to get round,5.0,,"We visited Singapore for 6 days and got a card (like an Oyster card) which cost 5$ and can be easily topped up in any station.
The MRT is easy to use, extremely clean and safe.
This is by far the most civilised train system I ever used."
,,It's CLEAN,4.0,,More or less it's a copy of London Tube. But cleanliness is prize worthy. 2-3 days pass is recommended for visitors. You will get 10 Singapore Dollar back on return of pass!!
,,Excellent means of Commute,5.0,,"MRT is Signapore can be describes as excellent means of Commute, easy for access, fabulous connectivity throughout the city and money saver. I will suggest always travel by MRT as it is not only money saving but time saving and comfortable too."
,,Best Metro,4.0,,"Singapore

SMRT most efficient and inexpensive

538444548

Probably the best Metro/ Train Service in the World
My honest opinion

Ranking based on efficiency and cost
1. SMRT (Singapore)
2. Eurorail
3. Scnf
4. Taiwan Metro
5. Japan Metro
6. London Underground

best way to travel around singapore!
anywhere, anytime until midnight

For as low as $1.80 per way.
Most of the time - its on time,
less time consuming and reliable"
,,Simply the best,5.0,,"SG MRT is clean, efficient, on time and one of the best transit systems I have ever used.

Wide carriages with comfortable seating also provide great comfort.

I bought a 3 day visitor pass that included unlimited bus and MRT travel. Well worth the cost of you plan to move about the city for dining, shopping and sightseeing."
,,Easy and fast transportation,5.0,,"Easy and fast transportation throughout the city, also safe to travel during all times of the day. Easy wayfinding in all the stations"
,,quickest and cheapest way to commute,5.0,,"The SMRT is a well managed mass rapid public transportation.You 'll have no problems in finding the nearest station from whichever hotel you are staying. The stations and trains are clean, made possible by the highly disciplined Singaporeans. Definitely the cheapest, fast, fastest and safest way to commute around the island. Recommended to travellers - why pay taxi and driven by mostly unfriendly drivers"
,,"Efficient, Clean and Disciplined",5.0,,"Amongst all the underground transportation systems that I have used so far, I found the Singapore MRT to be the best. Directions are very well written, platforms are clean and people using it are disciplined.
The trains seem to be new, announcements are clear and people at the ticket counter, extremely helpful.
Kudos!!"
,,SMRT,5.0,,"Singapore has the best subway in the world. The service is World-class. The subways are clean, wide and prompt. It reaches lots of destinations and major parts of the republic."
,,Great MTR,5.0,,"The MTR in Singapore is fairly easy to navigate. I used a two day tourist card for 26 SGD and you get 10 back if you return it. Returning it can be difficult because most ticket offices close well before midnight. The only place to return it after say 9:00 pm is the Red Line information booth. Card starts the fist time you use it and expires at midnight the following day. ( not the best deal if you buy it late in the day ). The card can be used on busses as well.
If you have used the MRT in other Asian countries you will find this easier and cleaner."
,,Brilliant and spotless,5.0,,"I had a short time on Singapore to do everything I wanted. The SMRT allowed me to do everything I wanted! There routes were easy to figure out. Even better, every station had employees who were both knowledgeable and kind. It's really amazing that every one of the people I interacted with was so professional and attentive. Further, the place was stunningly clean. I was able to get from the Marina Sands Hotel complex to the airport with only one change at Expo, and for only 2.40 SGD! I'm adding two pictures of the station nearest the Marina Sands Hotel."
,,"Easy, Efficient and Clean",5.0,,"While visiting Singapore, I would highly recommend getting their Ezlink card (which you can top up) and taking full advantage of their public transport. You can easily get around the city, head to the airport and we always seemed to find a seat. Travel Tip: You will need to maintain a $3 minimum on your card. But, at the end of your trip, after you scan out at the airport MRT, you can get a refund on any balance remaining at the MRT booth."
,,Spotless,4.0,,"The most spotless underground rail system I’ve ever travelled on. Very fast and efficient. Only downside is that it still doesn’t operate with Bank card style turnstiles to access the trains. So in rush hour or after an event, the queues for the ticket machines are horrendous if you haven’t been able to plan your trip in advance. This really surprised me for somewhere as Uber efficient as Singapore."
,,Trains Always On Time.,5.0,,"We used the trains a number of times finding them clean and easy to use. Sometimes found exiting at right exit not as easy as expected, but that could have been struggling with sense of direction (seemed different to in Australia)"
,,Clean and efficient,4.0,,"It was never busy in the train itself when we traveled. The ticketing system seems easy but for a tourist it is not that friendly. There are passes that can be bought only at certain stations and it will cost a non-refundable S$5. Other choice are the one time rides that need to bee topped up every time you travel, one by one. Such a ticket can be used six times, after three and six times you get 10 cents rebate. There are long queues at the ticket machines."
,,Easy-peasy getting about system,5.0,,"If it's the MRT or bus, getting about in Singapore is generally very easy. The MRT especially is VERY good indeed."
,,"""Brilliant""",5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is so easy to use, and cheap. It is so efficient, everything works well. The best thing is it is extremely clean and well maintained and no graffiti (coming from a country full of it you really notice it)."
,,Really easy to use - even if you have no idea on public transport or rarely use it,5.0,,"We found this the best way to travel everywhere. Really easy to use. In English as well. Buy a Smart card and load money onto it. You just tap on and off at train lines and buses. It will save you money as well.
We got the Singapore Tourist Pass Plus card and it comes with bonus to use within the city. Like eateries, places of interest. You need to make your money on it. We didn't get full use of it.

We opted for a pass at the train station, than kept topping it up when required. This was the best value for money for us! Also you can get an app on your phone that will give best advise on how to get places and timetables and what is nearest to you. It was a life saver for us."
,,Easy way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"Ticket machines are easy to use, just type in the name of the station and it will give you a fare.

The tickets are reloadable and you pay a 10c fee, which you get back on your third trip.

Trains are clean and efficient. The travellers are courteous and offer their seats to tnose who need it more."
,,Great value travel,4.0,,Frequent services make it easy to travel around Singapore. Easy to use with London Tube Map style. Tickets can be purchased from machines at each station. Not overly expensive either.
,,Time and cost Efficient mode of transport,5.0,,"This is the fastest way of getting from point a to point b, if one doesn't mind walking and transferring rides. No traffic and right on the dot as the screen will announce arrival time and minutes of waiting.
I noticed however that Singaporeans don't really yield their seats to the elderly nor those with babies. Too bad as all signages are up to remind them to share it to someone who needs it more"
,,Very efficient service.,5.0,,Trains are only very crowded only during peak hours. Most of the time it is very pleasant. Fares are very affordable. They have very clean interiors. Signs are very well placed and most stations have F&B.
,,Smrt,4.0,,The train was punctual and was clean with smooth ride was given a seat as I am disabled with walk stick had a pleasant trip with air conditioning would recommend to the average person as it is cheap
,,Use it!,5.0,,Best and cheapest way to get around Singapore! The stations and trains are air conditioned and astonishingly all passengers behave very well (also during rush hour).
,,The best way to travel within the city,5.0,,Singapore MRT is by far the best I have ever experienced. It made travelling within the city cheap and very easy. Its very fast and one doesn't need to wait very long for the trains. I just loved Singapore MRT
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,"I used the MRT over a period of three days and found it very easy to navigate. The lines are all colour coded and it covers all of the tourist areas like Clarke Quay, Chinatown, Little India etc."
,,good way to get around,4.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore, especially in the main city areas. If you have to go out of town take a taxi as trains are limited and it will take an hour."
,,Mass Rapid Transport,4.0,,"MRT is a good way to travel in Singapore it is cost effective and one need not know all the roads to each a place. One needs to take a smart card and keep topping it up. Taxis are expensive, and Singapore is well connected with MRT. You just need to check the stations where you would want to take the connecting MRTs to your destination"
,,Terrible!,1.0,,Kept stopping and later broke down! Due to the stupid flooding system! This shouldnt be a “top attraction” in singapore!
,,A MUST to do,5.0,,Gardens by the bay are a must see thing to do and especially go to the night light show it is beautiful. It was $23 pp to enter the 2 domes which is not expensive when you see the beautiful flowers and cloud dome
,,Best!,5.0,,"Best MRT that I have used so far. Very frequent, clean, safe and fast. The station network is also very robust! So simple and easy to commute across the Singapore."
,,A delight to ride,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, on time, easy to use!! Wish all the rapid transits everywhere were just like Singapore’s. A 10 out of 10 in my book! Kudos to the people that run it!!"
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"This is by far the best service I have ever used underground. Trains every two minutes. Sparkling new I think they are British as the builder is Alstom!
No eating or drinking on board allowed, so clean. Fast efficient on time automated no driver. Announcements in English."
,,First timers MTR,5.0,,"Wow, what a transport system. Very clean trains, very open carriages with minimal seating (elderly, disables, pregnant are given use of seating) everyone else stands up. Can see from on end to other end of 6 carriage train, no carriage doors, walk the length of the train with ease. No eating, drinking permitted. Stations edges are protected be glass partitions to railway safety.
Train pulls up exactly where station door are located, both train and station doors open almost together, station gap is no more than 20cms, so you can wheel a stroller or wheel chair straight off the train, with no safety issues.
Very impressed, would love this system in Australia."
,,"Cheap, efficient, clean",5.0,,"I would recommend buying the 2 or 3 day tourists pass if you plan on using the MRT frequently. You can get practically anywhere on the MRT and trains were always frequent, miles better than the London Underground!"
,,A transport system that works,5.0,,"The trains are very clean, run on time and if you miss one, you don't have to wait long for the next to arrive. Fares are cheap, skip the 1,2, or 3 day Singapore Tourist Pass and buy an EZ-Link card instead for better value."
,,One of the best MRT systems in the world,5.0,,"The SMRT is brilliant and cheap. You need to buy a touch card and load value onto it initially but after that it is touch on and touch off on the MRT and all buses.

Combine that with the How2Go app and you get real time advice on the quickest way between anything in Singapore."
,,Very easy and fasfer,5.0,,"MRT is very good transportation in singapore to go to diffeerent places at downtown and sentosa city just go one of mrt station get the ticket find the time table you will get anywhere you want in the city,you can used the ticket to jump in bus as well the stuff work there are helpfull ,very clean ,not allow drinking and eating inside the train ,each station you will find restaurant and mall or food court ,and good thing is open until the mall are closed"
,,Most convenient and efficient transport system,5.0,,"I used MRT in my first visit to Singapore and fell in love with the way it's designed. For a completely stranger like us, the travel was with ease and we became part of it as if we're using it for ages. The daily pass of 10$ was quite handy and we used it in MRT and buses alike. The navigation is simple, staff is very cordial and yes the escalators too are real real fast:) enjoyed being part of the flow that use this daily.
Many of the station do not shoot up / mask into the skyline, they are single story and gel with the neighnouring shop line/ landscape.

10/10 to the team that conceived this infrastructure and ofcourse the team which built it !"
,,Amazing public transportation system!!!,5.0,,Blown away by the orderly attitudes of these locals. Left me in complete envy and awe of house much pride Singaporeans have for their country. Not a single sign of graffiti. Like the rest of the city it was spotless.
,,Efficient and well thought of & planned transport system,5.0,,"From the airport to the tourist spots, to the shopping malls, to your home. This is how interconnected the mass rapid system in Singapore is. At one point, I think there will be around 6 train lines situated one on top of the other. If you want to transfer to another line, there are stations which you can do so without the hassles and you will not also be exposed to direct sunlight.

The minds behind this transport system in Singapore is really good. Not to mention that the cost aren't that expensive as well."
,,Only way to get around,5.0,,"We bought a travel card ( not the TOURIST one) at the airport. Easy to travel to hotel, just get a map, or ask fellow travellers or locals, everyone helpful.
Trains & buses are clean, reliable, safe & run frequently.
We were in Singapore for 8 days, only used public transport & we covered a lot of the city, even a trip to Changi Village & both to & from the Airport. We spent just under $25 each on our travel card."
,,"Clean, cheap and fast",4.0,,"Cooler than walking, cheaper than the bus and faster than a taxi! Stations all over the city and extending all round the island."
,,Great and Fast way to Travel throughout Singapore,5.0,,"Great way to explore Singapore, normally you have MRT station near all the tourist places and to the local markets as well. You will have to buy the card which will be valid for the MRT, Bus and even on the monorail on Sentosa. When we were there, offer was available, we got the cards for SGD 12 with a balance of SGD 7."
,,Reach almost all populated area at Singapore,5.0,,"One of things that I always miss from Singapore is it's MRT. Super comfort, convenience, fast, neat and orderly. It reach almost all populated area at Singapore.

On my first time to Singapore I got a STP (Singapore Tourist Pass) that cost me S$30 (the initial S$10 will be returned when you return back the STP). But now I bought the Ezlink card, The card cost me S$12 (S$7 balance). And luckily This year SMRT just has it's 30th birthday and issued limited edition 30th SMRT. :)

The only drawback of SMRT is you have to walk a quite long track to reach the vehicle when you just have to wait busses to come to you. :)"
,,Great transport system,5.0,,"Stayed very close to Farrar Park station. MRT was brilliant to use, quick, clean. Made it so easy to get around Singapore. Used the tourist pass which worked well."
,,"Quick, Cheap, Efficient",5.0,,This is the easiest way to commute around Singapore. It is a very frequent service and we never waited longer than a few minutes.
,,WOW,5.0,,"Quiet, clean, convenient, modern, safe, air conditioned, frequent, WiFi, inexpensive, and easy to use. Everything a transit system should be. An example to the world."
,,Very convenient and fast,5.0,,We used the MRT to go most places. They are much better than the buses and much cheaper. Highly recommend using it if you have time to travel locally
,,"Fantastic, cheap safe clean, efficient.",5.0,,What a brilliant way to travel in this fantastic country. Like the London Underground but much better.
,,Great system.,5.0,,"Fast, cheap, clean, easy to understand; what more can I say. No problem topping up your card and easy to transfer to other lines to get where you want to go."
,,An excellent way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Buy an EZ-card from the booth before the first trip. About $20 credit will get you around easily for a few days.
,,fast and efficient way to get about,5.0,,The MRT is fabulous. Trains running every few minutes and we used the MRT everyday. Easy changeover at stations if you need to change lines. The trains are clean and they were always prompt. Cheap easy transport to most places.
,,A great way to get around Singapore,4.0,,My two daughters and I travelled on the MRT and found it very quick and very easy to use. The trains came often so we didn't have to wait too long.
,,Even better than London Transport,5.0,,"A clean, efficient and well run metro. Other city metro systems could learn a thing or two with well air conditioned carriages, a moving illuminted station indicator and telling you which side of the carriage the exit will be.
The Tourist passes are an excellent buy for those intending yo use the dystem extensively."
,,Only way to travel,5.0,,Great way to travel to the many highlights that Singapore has to offer. Fares are cheap and service is quick.
,,Amazing metro experience,4.0,,I hesitate to travel alone here in India and it takes few years to convince me to travel alone. But here I had traveled alone as the process is streamlined and had my best friend who trained me for 3 days. For me it was an achievement to travel alone taking different lines to change the location and travel without anyone helping. Hats off to the smrt team of Singapore....
,,Convenient,5.0,,"I love MRT; it is fast, convenient and easy. I can almost go everywhere in Singapore with MRT. It is very good value for budget travel."
,,Diwali visit,5.0,,excellent experience. very easy to use SMRT even for the outsiders. well maintained & clean. Only sad part is that we had to leave behind 5$ per head because they did not take back the MRT card.
,,Nothing but the best,5.0,,"Awesome is the word. Extremely well connected, super service at about 3-4 minutes of interval and above a very comfortable ride (completely air-conditioned). You just need to have the MRT map with you and you can straight away map the route you want to go to (have attached the MRT Map along with). There are various stations where in you can change lines and thus move from one end of the Singapore to the other.
The best part of the MRT is that they are seriously well connected to the Bus Services (what they call as Interchanges) and also the roads besides the MRT Stations. All have escalators, so no need to lug yourself up those hundred stairs. Some MRT stations are deep in to the belly of the earth and thus those escalators are extremely needed.
A word of caution though the escalators at MRT are quite fast, well they need to be as some are quite long (perhaps 4-6 storeys high). So be careful to hop in and hop off the MRT escalators.
Otherwise I would say, the MRT and the Bus service were the highlight of our trip to Singapore."
,,So Handy,5.0,,"Its well worth buying a pass. This service is one of the best we've experienced. Trains run very frequently, are clean and seemed very safe. The system is still being expanded"
,,Convenient Travelling in Singapore,5.0,,"If you are travelling in Singapore make sure to use the MRT. During my stay I used this to go to Marina Bay and Orchard Road from Sarangoon Road. The trains are not crowded.Instructions are shown in every station. Some times you will have to get transfered to another train from the train you are travelling ,to reach the desired destination"
,,Best Metro Ever,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is the cleanest and most efficient metro I have ever used.

The prices are very affordable, especially considering Singapore doesn't seem very cheap to me.

Services are frequent and a great network of lines make getting around the city effortless.

Navigating the stations is very simple as well because everything is very clearly signposted.

Like any metro system, I'm sure this has its faults. If you were to ride it often enough I'm sure you'd experience some issues and delays, but as a visitor to the city, the SMRT made our time there much better, and we got more of it because we spent less time finding our way around and more time where we wanted to be."
,,"Fast, cheap and convenient",5.0,,"This is a fantastic transport system. The longest wait we had was maybe 6 minutes...on average about 3 minutes. The system is fast, clean and cheap."
,,"Clean, fast without crowds",5.0,,"You can’t say too much about it. It’s clean, fast and don’t forget something like jacket once you’re not cold resistant."
,,The Best!,5.0,,"I've been a commuter on world subways for years: New York, San Francisco, Washington DC, Tokyo, Hong Kong, London, Paris.........

Without question, Singapore has the best! Best in dependability, best in design and comfort, best in convenience, best in security! All great, not just good!

Lastly, the price is good value, too!"
,,"Excellent, cheap and efficient",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is cheap and efficient. You can buy the Public transport card at the station and use it for the bus and MRT and the trains are clean, air conditioned and run on time usually every 15mins."
,,Quick and cheap,5.0,,"If you need to get about in Singapore you can’t go past the MRT, quick, efficient and easily navigated and very cheap."
,,"Great connectivity, cheap, fast and easy.",5.0,,"SMRT is by far the best means of public transport I have seen. It's completely automated and most of the trains are also driverless.
Ticket booking is very easy at the computerized ticket booths. Just tap the destination on the on-screen map and it calculates the fare and generates the card. You can pay either by cash or card.
If you are planning to use the SMRT extensively, then, you can purchase at EZ-Link card which is available at the information desks. It is basically a prepaid card which you can top up and use multiple times to save the hassle of removing new tickets every time.
Also, be sure to obey the rules as there are heavy fines otherwise. Consumption of food and beverages is strictly not allowed once inside the train.

TIP: Always stand to the left side while using the escalators and leave space on the right for people in hurry. This is sincerely obeyed by everyone using the SMRT."
,,Singapore made simple,5.0,,"Very clean and efficient system Outlets from stations go in every direction ,many areas undergroundyou can coverwithout crossing a road.Very cheap ticketing all machine instructions in English..We could learn a lot from these guys"

,,Singapore MRT (Train),5.0,,"OMG!!! What a fabulous train system. We used this extensively for 5 days while staying in Singapore. So easy to use and cheap for travellers $30 for 3 days unlimited use to anywhere and when you return the pass you get $10 back. Very clean, air conditioning, safe, English signs and speaking and attendants to help you everywhere. All underground so nice and cool out of the heat. There is a train every 2-4 minutes, never waited any longer only encountered crowds once at peak time. So many stations for all attractions, shopping centres and hotels. I cannot recommend this enough 10/10. Note only certain stations have the 3 day pass so make sure you check online first"
,,Very reliable and convenient,5.0,,The SMRT is very reliable and convenient that you need not take the cab when going to most tourist spots. I believe they are building more stations so that means better accessibility! I love Singapore's SMRT!
,,"Easy, clean and cheap.",5.0,,"The SMRT is one of the most organized train systems in modern cities. You don't have to worry about your money as this is a really cheap way to get around. You can reach every part of the city easily. But be aware, that you shouldn't drink nor eat in the trains, or you get a fine."
,,On time always,5.0,,its real easy to travel in MRT in Singapore....we traveled once but experience was really good.....may be nest time we will travel more by MRT
,,Easy & Cheap transport in Singapore,4.0,,Do a little excercise. Buy the Easy link. Take SMRT where ever you go in Singapore. Its really easy and entertain.
,,Easily accessible and connects all major locations,4.0,,The best way to travel while you are in Singapore .It is reasonable and connects all major attractions .You have to buy the tickets from the kiosks located at each station wherein you can pay through cash currency and coins.Good thing is that we also didn't find it crowded and was convenient to travel
,,No need for taxis,5.0,,"Spotlessly clean, safe, easy to use and cheap. Can get you anywhere in the city in minutes. Do try it."
,,One of the best transit systems in the world,5.0,,"It’s easy to get around Singapore using the SMRT. Transferring between lines is often as simple as walking across the platform.
You can get to most Singapore tourist spots on it. Tapping on and off is easy and you really can’t forget to do it. There are various payment methods - smart cards or buying tickets at the station machines.
The carriages are clean and there is plenty of room.
There is a display in each carriage so you can keep track of where you are and when your stop comes up. Plus there are audio announcements. Great for tourists!
It’s a great way to get from the airport to your hotel for much cheaper than a shuttle or taxi."
,,Handy to get around,5.0,,"Used this the whole time we were in Singapore, so easy to use, air conditioned which is a bonus because of the humidity in Singapore. Plenty of help from staff if needed, maps in stations easy to follow to allow you to plan your routes"
,,Frequent delays on a near weekly basis,2.0,,The smrt has been plagued with multiple track faults and signalling systems issues. Do expect to buffer additional travelling time if taking this transport in the morning or evening (peak hours)
,,Best and most economical way of going around Singapore,4.0,,This is the lifeline of the Singapore populations. It's the most economical way of going around once you get the hang of it. As tourists we are most inclined to take the taxi as it's readily available and point to point - but they are way more expensive. In fact the MRT is also the faster option as u don't face any traffic jam. The stations are huge and the first time may seem a little unnerving to tourists - in fact we were struggling to find a way out as there are so many exits. But once u know your way around it's definitely the best option. However it may be a bit crowded in peak office hours which tourists may not like.
,,Very comfortable means of travel within singapore,5.0,,SMRT in Singapore is the best way to commute anywhere. It is well connected via the different routes with 4 options and is pretty fast and very afordable
,,"Inexpensive, very clean, air conditioned and very safe.",5.0,,"Best underground system we have been on anywhere in the world. Went once during the rush hour, but there was no pushing, shoving or queue jumping! Singaporeans are very polite and well behaved."
,,Easiest way to travel!,5.0,,"Make sure you buy a card if you plan to use public transport in Singapore.
Then life is easy.
i found the metro easier than buses and the map is very helpful. If you know the station you have to get off at then you just need to follow the map.
Even if you have to do multiple train changes its still easy and even as a tourist its easy to figure out.
Why take expensive cabs when the public transport is so easily accessible. Just make sure that you figure out which direction the metro is going in before you get on as that can be a little tricky."
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"Probably the easiest subway system that I have ever used anywhere. So easy and so cheap!! Definitely use if coming from the airport, it cost us $5 as opposed to an expensive taxi."
,,"Fabulous, clean, efficient and cheap.",5.0,,"Easy to buy tickets, the stations, trains and service were superb. Immaculately clean, and a pleasure to use, very well signposted."
,,Very very efficient,5.0,,"Most efficient metro I have ever experienced. Tickets can be very easily booked through kiosks. Very friendly staffs to guide you, train frequency in many numbers. 1000% clean. This is how any public transport should be in any country."
,,Local transport.,5.0,,"Economical and to the minute punctual. It's reliable, economical and very fast mode of transport. Never over crowded . People are courteous to elderly and offer their seat."
,,Bread and Butter,5.0,,"The SMRT services in Singapore ia spotless. It connects to every nook and corner of this beautiful city and once u get the map in your head, travelling within the city will be a cakewalk."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT and the SMRT are fast, clean, efficient, very regular and so cheap! Best way to get around Singapore."
,,This is all you need,4.0,,Having arrived at the airport y need to go to Terminal 2 and then down to the Light Rail station - buy a Singapore visit card for the number of days required and then off y go -it's cheap you even get the 10 dollars back when y return the card at the end -you can get everywhere and it cost about EURO 10 PER DAY BUT THAT IS FOR UNLIMITED TRAVEL
,,Brilliant service!,5.0,,"I'm not a fan if underground trains but my husband likes to sample local transportation when we are abroad. So i agreed to give it a go. I have to say this is the cleanest, most organised train system i have been on and we spent most if our week hopping on and off. It was easy, very cheap, trains were immaculate and the Singaporeans were so polite. People were allowed to exit the trains before others attempted to get on - you wouldn't get that in european cities! It was a frequent service and kept to time perfectly. Not all of Singapore is connected but a new line was opening this month and the network was being extended too. It felt very safe and i would have happily used it alone. Well done Singapore - great service!"
,,Simply the best !!!,4.0,,"Used the SMRT for all my transfers during my five day stay.
New & clean with English signage which is a plus for me.
Loved the Aircondition throughout the terminals and trains.
Would have loved my SMRT experience even more IF trains didn't stop at midnight and needing to start my return around eleven each evening towards my hotel."
,,Great,5.0,,"it has connectivity all accross whether by MRT , Buses & LRT but they have connected to almost every part of singapore and during my travel i only used these as a mode of transport its so good.."
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"Trains in Singapore are easy to comprehend, not complicated, and very convenient. They are usually connected in to a mall and bus terminals. Very easy to navigate"
,,Fast. Effective. Cheap.,5.0,,"Not much to say about Singapore's MRT other than that it is a fast, reliable system that covers most of the major hubs. We rode it almost daily on various lines to numerous destinations and never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes. The trains and stations, although sometimes crowded, are extremely clean, and everything is incredibly well sign-posted, making navigation easy for just about anyone. Tickets are easily purchased for a low cost at ticket machines with numerous staff on hand to help if necessary."
,,So easy to navigate this rail system,5.0,,The SMRT is so simple to use that travelling around Singapore is a total breeze. We were informed by a local guide that the government wants less cars on the roads and more people using the SMRT that's why there will be more lines and stations added to the system in the future.
,,One of the world's best,5.0,,"There cannot be many better MRTs anywhere in the world, certainly that I have seen.
The trains are spotless, very frequent, and smooth running.
There is no food or drink allowed on board and they are very quiet, as literally everyone is on their mobile phones etc.. (the age we live in I guess, nobody speaks)
They are currently constructing a new coastal line from the airport to the city, which will further add to the marvellous transportation links already in place.
Dead cheap too."
,,1000 people in a que,3.0,,"Unless mistaken this is very limited in routes and when busy cannot cope.... our first attempt saw us getting a Taxi out of Sentosa - yes it was end of day but the que to leave the theme park was 45 minutes long. Our next visit to the SEA Aquarium finished mid day and only a 5 minute wait to board. It was no quicker than the shuttle at Stansted Airport, clean, packed, and no pleasure although it done what it said on the tin!"
,,Highly efficient,5.0,,We actually caught the MRT from Changi airport to our hotel at Clarke Quay and never had an issue. It was well signed and very clean and always on time.
,,Easy and cheap,5.0,,Used the mrt to the airport from little india very cheap and quick So easy even with big cases one change at bugis and then one platform change for changi airport
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Easy to use, clean and really cheap. Used this mode of transport all over Singapore to get around. So easy, would recommend getting a key card pass."
,,wonderful way to get around,5.0,,"the Singapore Mrt is fantastic,unbelievably clean,cheap,easy to use and so efficient,if you have any queries the staff are ultra helpful"
,,Only way to travel,5.0,,"Fantastic system so easy to use. Takes you everywhere you want to go, some walking when transferring between lines, but all air conditioned.
Love the way people stand to the side and let others exit before they enter, such good manners.
Every time when it was crowded people stood up to offer their seats, maybe they are kind, maybe I just look old lol.
I paid as I went and didn’t get a card, machines easy to use."
,,Surprised More Westerners Don't Use The Service,5.0,,"On my recent trip to Asia I frequently used the efficient, clean, safe underground subway (Metro) systems in cities throughout China, Seoul (South Korea), and in Singapore. In each country I was surprised how few tourists seemed to be using the trains compared to the numbers walking the streets above ground. Maybe they have safety fears, or worry that signs etc. will only be in a foreign language? Or maybe they just explore a few main streets, and don't have the time or inclination to explore a little further afield. Personally, I have found the Metro systems in all 3 countries mentioned, to be incredibly convenient and easy to use (yes everything is in English). The subways in China, Seoul, and Singapore are spotlessly clean and incredibly safe. They are ideal when it is stinking hot above ground, or pouring with rain.

This is not a criticism, but the Metro in Singapore is more expensive and the trains are not quite as frequent as in China or Seoul, but I presume that it is because there is a smaller population to use the system. My advice when in Singapore is to use the Singapore metro trains as they are a quick and easy way to get from one end of Orchard Rd to the other (and then maybe walk back), or out to China town, the Zoo, the Botanical Gardens, or somewhere else. It is a great system."
,,"Very efficient, very cheap and very clean",4.0,,"We used the SMRT throughout our stay in Singapore and it puts all other underground systems I have been on to shame. Very clean, always on time and incredibly good value. I can’t imagine why you wouldn’t use it."
,,So efficient - no taxi travel necessary,5.0,,We bought the cards last time and just topped them up when we arrived in Singapore this time. It is just so cheap and so efficient to travel this way that we don't even consider taxis. We use the MRT from the airport to the hotel and return as there's plenty of room in the carriages for our bags.
,,Frequent train breakdowns,1.0,,"During my 3 days business trip to Singapore, I encounter not one, not two but three train breakdowns. Locals has complained on the frequency of the breakdown as well. I switched to Uber and barely reached my meetings on time. Avoid the trains at all cost if time is of the essence."
,,convenience,5.0,,"arrival on time, cleaness, organize. remind me train in Japan. No good, no drink other wise you pay fine."
,,MRT-Singapore,4.0,,"The most convenient way to get around in Singapore. Quite economical in my opinion, just get a MRT card and you can top it up with a minimum of SGD10 at any of the kiosks at the stations. You can also get a Tourist MRT pass that is valid for 3 days & costs SGD30 at some specific MRT stations."
,,Take this for Faster Ride,4.0,,"Singapore MRT is very good, especiall for a tourist like me. it is connected to the airport do I don't have to worry about what should I take to go to the city center. Don't take it within rushh hour as it is very very crowded by people going for and coming from office."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Well maintained, well organized, clean and comfort. The cheap way to have backpackers way around Singapore."
,,It is so convenient !,5.0,,This MRT is a cool one to go around in Singapore and enjoy all your time and get back where ever you are there u can find an MRT just walkable distance all u need is an MRT card or one day pass just top up and go around so simple user friendly ! Well maintained - easy notifications to know where u are and what is your next station all well organised ... plz use this MRT- transportation method for your local experience.
,,MRT is SMaRT,5.0,,"The smartest way to travel whilst in Singapore. Smarter than a taxi, cheaper too.

If you get a hotel in Singapore making sure it's in a prime location for the MRT is key.
the MRT can get you from the airport to bugis mall which is in a hugely popular part of town that's close to lots of things to see and do.

Its a super quick and easy service to use and boards are at every station to show routes.

Easy to use
Quick
Go all over the town, prime locations such as little India, little China, downtown, bugis mall and the airport."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,The best way around Singapore! Cheap and easy to use. We have an EZ Link card and just top up which makes travel a breeze
,,"Efficient, clean",4.0,,"Used this a couple of times, amazed at how cool and clean it is. There is a whole city of shops and walkways to and from various MRT points underground! Still find the apps for the MRT a little confusing though. Easier to simply use google maps to figure out which line to take when"
,,Friendly and helpful driver,5.0,,"Took a bus in front of Grand Mercure Roxy in Singapore to church in Upper East Coast road. Wasn't sure which stop to alight as the bus doesn't ply that road but a parallel road. The driver was so kind to stop us at the correct stop. Signalled us with a friendly smile.
Keep it up SMRT"
,,Best way to see the city,5.0,,"For $1-2 a trip, linking you to any part of the city the Singapore MRT was fabulous.
We decided to use MRT to get to the airport for our departure - having a fixed travel time not influenced by traffic (about 45min in total door to door) that was air-conditioned and so, so easy and cheap was wonderful!"
,,Numerous trips on the MRT,5.0,,"Fabulous. What a treat, having become used to the dirty, litter strewn underground in London. Unlike the London Underground the stations and trains are spotless - and relatively inexpensive. The consumption of food or drink is prohibited, and fines are issued for those that flout the rules. It may sound draconian, but not seeing someone chomping into a Big Mac, and slurping a soda, and dumping the waste on the floor is worth it. Tickets may be recharged up to six times, simply by placing the card on a machine reader, and inserting the required cash. Simple and environmentally sound. Trains run punctually, and platform staff are actually eager to help. Transport for London should come here for a lesson..... recommended to get around."
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"With the map in hand and the rechargeable card you feel you belong to the place :D
It was just so convenient, and the staff was helpful in case you needed to switch between the clearly demarcated lines.
The 6 lines cover the entire country pretty nicely."
,,Easy Transport,5.0,,Getting around Singapore is really easy thanks to their excellent transport services that also include the underground and bus services. Just buy the Pass and use it to commute around Singapore with ease.
,,"Clean, fast and very useful",5.0,,If you're a tourist get a tourist pass from the ticket counters or information desk it cost 30 Singapore dollars for three days depending on what time of day you get the pass for unlimited travel on the busses and trains. It's very clean and very fast.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Be sure to save your card and reuse it. after 6 trips you get money back. Easy system just like other cities. color coded and SUPER CLEAN! Fast way to get around.
,,"Unreliable, Too Crowded, Trains don't come often enough, network not developed",1.0,,"Unreliable compared to systems in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Way too packed with people packed so close together you feel like you could be inseminated by another man on your way to work. The subway train is very poor, very few stations and lines compared to NYC, London, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo. It seems that the government doesn't have the funds to build a better developed network before they began importing huge numbers of immigrants and foreign workers. If you look at the whole MRT map and if you've been to the cities I listed above, you know what I'm talking about! This is an undeveloped city pretending and bragging to be more developed than it is."
,,Extremely efficient,5.0,,"The SMRT is very efficient, frequent trains and user friendly and inexpensive. Easy for travelling around Singapore"
,,Easy,4.0,,What a easy way to get around Singapore on the buses or the trains. You can buy a day pass or just go to the machines and punch in where you want to go
,,Love it,5.0,,"Makes life so easy to go around Singapore. One of the reasons want to come back in Singapore. Clean, accessible, cheap."
,,Fast and convenient,5.0,,Singapore is known for its well spread train net work MRT. It is very convenient and it is easy to find your way to any part if Singapore. From the airport to the city as well as to most tourist places the MRT connects the length and breadth of the city. The stations are also very well located and there are elevators for the differently abled as well as escalators to save you time and effort in reaching your destinations. We travelled to all the places and were impressed by the MRT
,,Perfect Connection,5.0,,"When you are in Singapore you need this kind of transportation to get from one point to another part of the town. Cheap and quick. When you are for a longer time in Singapore buy a card. Upgrade this when its empty with 10 SGD. You can use this card for Bus, Metro and Cabs. Very nice !!"
,,Tourist Pass for 3 days or less. EZ-Link Card for longer visits,5.0,,"The SMRT system was great.

Everywhere we wanted to go was a quick 1 or 2 train ride away. We never waited more than a few minutes for a train.

The Tourist Pass is great with unlimited travel on the MRT and bus system for a small per day fee. The 3 day pass is only $20.
BUT
- you can only buy the passes at a limited number of stations that have Ticket Offices
- the ticket offices don't open until 10:00 so if you arrive on an early flight you have a dilemma of waiting for the office to open or getting on with your holiday
- the pass requires a $10 deposit that can only be redeemed at a Ticket Office with the same location and hours restrictions.

The alternative is the EZ-Link card that costs $5 and can be topped up and any station.

We were in Singapore for 6 days and did the 3 day Tourist Pass twice. Looking back we would have been better off saving all the time spent on getting and returning the cards and just got a EZ-Link and paid for each ride. With most rides costing about $1 I don't think it would have have cost much more in total than the Tourist Pass."
,,What a pleasant way to travel,5.0,,"Once the way the train system and the ticket machines are mastered it’s a pleasure to travel on the SMRT
We would like to have paid for a 3 day pass and topped up as need but this option seemed to be unavailable... clean, quiet, excellent overhead announcements
Recommended"
,,Getting Around,5.0,,"The MRT is simply fantastic. Cheap, very safe, very clean and easy to follow. I've been to Singapore 3 times and rarely bother with taxis as this service is excellent."
,,Only way to get around,4.0,,"Once you work out where you need to go and the select the correct line colour, buying a ticket is easy, there is plenty of people around to help if needed. The platforms are all colour coded and well sign posted. If the train doesn’t go all the way to where you need to go, there usually is a bus stop at the station and or taxis available."
,,Only way to travel,5.0,,"So clean, easy to use and reliable apart from Uber this is the only way (in my opinion) to get around, staff are available and so very helpful to the dumb traveller like myself."
,,easy,5.0,,"Nothing to it, it is one of the easiest mass transit system in the world. Everything is well indicated, in multiple languages so that everyone understands. It's the best way to get around in Singapore."
,,Well Connected,5.0,,"Very well connected and covers almost all locations. Reasonably priced, clean, well maintained and very convenient mode of transport for all."
,,First Class Safe Service,5.0,,This is an excellent example of how Mass Rapid Transport should be handled. Excellent modern facility for very reasonable prices covering the not only the city centre but the surrounding areas.
,,Nice trains. Good connectivity,5.0,,"It was used for Boonbay station. Train from Lavender came with good vacant space.
Clean and precise services with excellent timings.
Stations were also good with shopping and eateries.
Must purchase 1-3 days pass as per requirements. 10 sgd to 30sGD.
Useful at multiple modes and multiple times"

They are expanding the system so make sure you have a update map."
,,Great value tourist card,5.0,,We took a 3 day tourist pass for 30 singapore dollars which included a 10 dollar deposit on the card. Worked out at under £4 per day for unlimited use of MRT and local buses. MRT is super efficient and perfectly clean. No comparison to others I have used such as London and Paris
,,Best transportation in the town,5.0,,"We did buy 3days travel ticket which allows you to travel anywhere in town with this card. SMRT is quick, easiest way to get from the airport and travel in the city as well. Very clean. Metro runs till midnight."
,,Singapore underground,5.0,,"The underground was very well laid out and clean and tidy, as expected in Singapore. Using a tourist pass was very reasonable price wise, $20 for three day pass and $10 refund when you returned the card at completion of your trip.
Very easy and quick to get around. Interesting that we were told by our taxi driver from the airport not to use taxis as the public transport system was so good. He was right and we could get to the Zoo and Changi museum very easily."
,,Metro,5.0,,"So easy to use the metro & very accessible stations on most busy streets & super clean
When you first arrive in Singapore find your nearest metro station this will save you a lot of time. We only bought single tickets which you can obtain at machines in the metro most only accept 2 & 5 dollar bills & your change is returned. The station maps are easy to read but the staff are very helpful if you have any questions about your journey & every station we went to was immaculately clean & that also includes the trains no litter anywhere. If your only visiting Singapore for a couple of days the metro will save you a lot of time & is inexpensive to use"

Buy a one or a two day pass and this makes the journeys so simple. Very easy to transfer lines and the information on the platforms or on the trains are very clear."
,,So amazing!,5.0,,"First time in Singapore and I am a huge fan of the MRT already. So easy to use. Take the time to buy the 1, 2, or 3 day passes for tourists. Super easy to use. Be adventurous and try it out. You’ll be happy you did"
,,Very reliable,4.0,,"Worth getting an ez-link card if used frequently. The daily tickets can only be bought with cash with the largest note of $5. Navigation is very easy with clear maps and signage. The service runs very frequently, even at night, and a delay usually lasts a minute or two if the train ahead is being caught up. The trains and stations are clean and modern. The way all public commuting should be."
,,Very clean and quick,5.0,,"The LRT and MRT of Singapore is a very good and cheap way to get around. We had no problem in navigating from and to the airport from our hotel, and getting around Singapore. Tourist Passes worked out very well"
,,The Best Way to Get Around Singapore,5.0,,"This has to be the best way to get around Singapore. The trains and stations are so clean, the staff are really helpful.

,,easy to get around,4.0,,clean and efficient as with most of singapore the MRT is a great way to get around - better if you start with the help and guidance of a local expat ! but nonetheless took me where I needed to get to
,,Wonderful system,4.0,,"Just shows what you can do if you design a system from scratch and only want the best.

Wonderfully clean and efficient. So many extensions planned to areas where there is currently no demand, answer, there will be!

However be prepared, system isn't infallible.

This week they've just opened a new extension to one of the lines and it didn't go smoothly."
,,Awesome MRT,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore be sure to pick up a tourist MRT card which gives you unlimited use of the MRT and buses for a specific period of time.

Singaporeans are very friendly and helpful, anyone looking slightly unsure will have multiple offers of help from locals."

After ready other reviews decided to buy a 2 day EZ tourist ticket. $26 pp but you get $10 back when you return the card. You can purchase these at main MRT stations. This gives you unlimited travel. Use internet and station maps to find nearest MRT station to the attraction. System maps and signage in stations are easy to follow. Like everything in Singapore it is clean and safe. signs and announcements are in English.
,,Cheapest Way to Get Around Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT ( underground train system) would rate the highest class of this type of transport in the world. The trains are extremely clean and safe as each station has a glass barrier between the platform and rail tracks. The cost also is very cheap, we bought a 3 day travel card for $20 which can be used on trains and buses everywhere.
There is a charge of $10 for the card but is refundable at the end of the 3 days.
The only downside is that at curtain times of the day the trains can be over crowed so plan your trips out of peak time."
,,Take the MRT!,5.0,,"The metro in Singapore (MRT) is among the best I know. It is fast, fully automated, very very clean, and cheap."
,,Smooth ride but unreliable.,2.0,,"The singapore MRT is very unreliable, not only due to the breakdowns but also the way they fix the breakdowns. SMRT is trying new a new signalling system, but why in the world does it need to be done during the day time when the rush hour is at its peak?

But to be fare the mrt itself is comfortable and fast."
,,Tourist pass was great- system Easy and cost effective,5.0,,"We used the MRT the entire time we were in Singapore over four days. Easy to navigate. Always immaculately clean.
Tourist pass was good value especially when you receive $10 back to return the card- worked out <$10 per day!
Also used it on the bus when we needed it."
,,Super mrt,5.0,,"MRT is the most convenient and most economical way of transport in Singapore. it is well connected to all tourist places. You can download the map on net. Basically it's diveded into 4 lines( as is ours central, western etc). You just have to understand which line MRT you have to pick and when to cross over into another,this you will understand very well ,once you study the map. It takes little more time to travel by MRT than by car,but it's way cheaper and therefore still the best option for traveling in Singapore"
,,Good way to explore Singapore,5.0,,Mrt is easy very easy and exceptionally clean. Never seen a metro this clean before . Very save and easy to use.

,,Good connectivity,4.0,,"Efficient system for transportion. Though some signages can be confusing as happened with us at harbour front mrt to orchard.
Though the reserved seats for ladies with children or senuors were comfortably occupied by youngsters who were not even courteous enough to vacate for us since had a kid with me."

,,Singapore travel,5.0,,"The MRT is city wide and inexpensive. Trains are very very regular, clean and safe.
This is a safe and reliable transport system that caters to all needs. Trains from Changi airport are regular, inexpensive and cater for travellers with baggage.
Getting around Singapore by MRT is easy and well sign posted."
,,What great public transport,5.0,,This would have to be the best and most affordable public transport system I have ever used it the would. We just purchased a travel card for $10 that started with $3 credit on it that you could top up when required. The fares were very cheap at 77 cents for a short trip. The most we were charged was $1.46 that was a 35min trip on the SMRT to Sembawang. We highly recommend it for travel around Singapore.
,,"Great, convenient, cost effective",5.0,,"Well maintained, well connected, easy to navigate, take a tourist pass for 1/2/3 days as per your requirement. Which also can be used in buses."
,,"Clean, efficient, hassle free",5.0,,"One of the best Subways/Metros/Underground systems I've ever come across. Clean, extremely well sign posted, clear and concise instructions on the ticket machines, and immaculate trains that appear every couple of minutes. Would that other countries would follow suit."
,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,"The Singapore system is very clean and efficient. May be I have a jaded mind having worked and used NYC Transit for years. Anyway, the system is well laid out and easy to navigate. I highly recommend buying the unlimited pass. The System does have a lot of cameras, meaning, follow no littering, eating and drinking otherwise there will be major fines. I guess this should be followed even if there are no camera's. The one knock, if that is, we weren't sure if you can drink water even when you are very thirsty. Finally, they do ask for SGD10 deposit for the card, so make sure to return last day, so you get the money back."
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"We use MRT a lot throughout our stay,really easy to use and to get about around Singapore.Very clean and always on time!.Try to avoid the rush hour as gets really busy,managed to get a seat most of the time apart from rush hour,very good service."
,,world no. 1 - breakdown rates,1.0,,one of the most UNRELIABLE public transport in the world with very frequent faults ! roots of the problems : managed by a bunch of retired military generals including the CEO (drawing million dollars annual salary) who are clueless of running public transport systems.
,,I'm going to miss this the most,5.0,,"The cleanest, cheapest most reliable transit system I've been on get around quickly and anywhere. I put$20 SG on my card and after a week off multiple trips I'm yet to use$5 SG"
,,Cheap and reliable,5.0,,"Took the mrt to Bugis. Buying of the ticket was so easy and simple.. besides there was a gentleman at the machine helping out those who were not too familiar with the machine.

The station was very clean and very easy to use so was the trains interior. Ticket prices were very good and train were very efficient always.

The regularity of the services and the assistance provided by staff for visitors is exceptional.

,,No better way to explore the city,5.0,,"During our 5 days stay in Singapore, only once did we take a taxi that is from airport to the hotel. Like the backpackers trip that we do, the very ext morning we picked up the map and with a bit of help from the hotel staff reached the bus stop to find the nearest metro station, Rest was just fun.The first bus trip and the metro trip to the botanical garden were made on cash and by a one way ticket. The customer Assistant at the Botanical garden station introduced us to the e z link cards which we got immediately. He was patient and caring and explained in detail how its important to tap in and tap out after every bus or metro journey so as so save the money and avoid unnecessary charges incurring.
For three of us we spent around 80 S$ in all and we explored all the destinations without any difficulty. A special mention and gratitude to the Customer Assistants who made our trips hassle free."

,,"Best way to enjoy Singapore is with the locals and cheaply, rapidly find your way aroudn the Island",5.0,,"Got an MRT card as soon as arrived with $20SGD...was here for a week and used it everyday and still had money left on the card. So affordable if you don't mind being a tad squeezed during peak hour...you can plan days out and go to most places on the Island. Wish our city, Perth had such a system!"
,,Efficient service and extensive network,5.0,,"Singapore’s MRT is clean, efficient, well connected and a comfortable way to get around the island away from the heat. Pricing is reasonable. The older north south line has broken down in the past and requires regular maintenance but compared to other systems in the world this is still very good."

,,Singapore Transport System,5.0,,There isn’t a better transport anywhere or of better value. New sections have recently been opened. Easy to use. Tourist cards can be bought to cope with very short visits to Singapore. Well worth buying the tourist card
,,Easy once you know how!!,4.0,,"We recently visited Singapore and this was our for of transport. We found the MRT a little tricky at the start working out the directions of the trains but once we had used it a couple of times, it became easy.
The kids loved riding the train,when the train was full people were very kind and gave up their seats for the children.
It was clean and plenty of room, even when busy.
Generally the trains ran every few minutes so the wait wasn't that long. Young children can get a free MRT card with ID. There are many top up stations for your card and it is very cheap.
The MRT card gets you on the buses and the trains and then Sentosa express in Vivocity station."
,,Singapore metro easy mode of transport,4.0,,"If you are a couple them metro is the cheapest mode of transport in Singapore,around 1dollar ticket you can go to most of the places in Singapore.If you take taxi minimum fare Starts with 3.50 dollars .For sentosa,universal studios little India,mustafa mall,orchard road mrt is there and also if you wanna visit Marina bay sands hotel bayfront metro station is underground of the hotel.So pick mrt if you are couple and if you are family then taxi would also be convenient and economical."
,,The best way to travel around Singapore,4.0,,"With a very effective and safe service, the SMRT subway is undoubtedly the fastest way to travel in Singapore."
,,"Exreamely Timely, Clean & TOP Quality - Beats London",4.0,,".. Really safe, on time, clean, Neat & tidy .. Professional in every sense .. Best Connected in our routes"
,,Best Mode of Transportation,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is the best way to move from one place to another. It is extremely quick, easy to navigate and covers most of the places in Singapore. They have different types of cards/passes available for tourists which is quite helpful. 1/2/3 days pass for SGD 10/16/20 respectively is the most effective choice for travelers."
,,World Class,4.0,,This is a world class mass transport system. Ticketing was very easy to operate with touch screens in English. Very frequent trains for all stops. Very quick but quiet.
,,Comfi,5.0,,"The best way to travel around Singapore. Very clean, very efficient, very fast, very easy to use, very friendly and helpful staff, and very convenient even at rush hours."
,,A fantastic way to get around Singapore cheap,5.0,,"It was a simple process to organise our MRT ticket card, the guys at the stations are very helpful with the range of options to suit the length of your stay, we were in Singapore for 6 days so we bought a ticket for $27, this includes a card that lasts up to 5 years and $20 of credit, so plenty of credit for the week. The stations are all very easy to get to and the network fully colour coded for ease of use, most stations are only 5 min on the MRT and the trains very comfortable and clean, the stations are orderly and well sign posted. For the $12.5 we spent travelling every day for the week, it was a bargain, it was approx .77c per trip of 2-3 stations, we managed to go to every sector of Singapore including the most outer reached areas close to the Malaysian border were a lot of the locals live. You will not go wrong investing in a MRT travel card during your visit."
,,clean and efficient,5.0,,"We have been to more than 60 countries and SMRT in one of the cleanest we have ever seen. Second most efficient would be the MRT in Hong Kong. Very cost effective and easy to navigate. Get the app for you smart phone, it is an added bonus."
,,Nice way to travel,4.0,,"Connectivity is awesome. And there are various options available for travellers - like the MRT card (for regulars)

And for tourists like us:
EZ Link - Card (This is a paper ticket, rechargeable upto 6 trips. Note: It is only rechargeable when the balance goes to zero.)
EZ Link - Tourist Pass (This is an electronic smart card - 1, 2, 3 day available depending on your requirement. Unlimited usage.)

The connectivity is great and you can travel across Singapore easily using this.

Point to note: Unlike Delhi Metro - people don't make space for you to stand if the metro is available. It is strange, since they make space for you to sit if you need. But if you are outside on the station and they are inside the train and standing on the door, they will not move aside or inside to let you in even if there is space to stand. Maybe they are not used to the crowd inside trains. :P

We also let it be and took the next train which came in. Frequency is good and the next one was empty for sure. :)"
,,The Best,5.0,,"This is the way to get around Singapore, you never wait more than 4 mins for a train, most trips are less than a dollar. It's clean, clean, clean."

,,So easy,5.0,,"The MRT is so easy to use, and has a station nearby to practically anywhere you want to go. They also offer tourist passes of varying lengths, that allow you to have unlimited use of MRT and buses. Definitely worth it and very cost effective."
,,Very comfortable transportation,5.0,,"I love traveling in singapore with smrt. Its very comfortable, a lot of route stop by and dont have to wait too long. And it will be a new 13 stops on downline (blue) start at 21 october'17"
,,"It's expensive, it's slow, it stalls, it floods",1.0,,"What can I say! It's expensive, it is slow, it stalls very oftern, now its flooded. Arrogance of the Singaporean government putting themselves on the pedestal thinking they are above the rest. The world has changed."
,,"Excellent transport system, tourist can buy a 1/23 day pass.",5.0,,"Excellent transport system, tourist can buy a 1/23 day pass which can be used both SMRT and buses. Well connected."
,,"I don't really have to say much, do I?!",5.0,,Singapore's MRT system is simply excellent and organized. You can trust that using the MRT will get you to your destination within the time frame that you have set up.
,,Travel made so easy,5.0,,"This was a great option for getting around. The stations are everywhere. Easy ticketing, and very friendly staff will assist you at any station if you are uncertain about anything. And it is only minutes between trains, so no big deal if you miss one."
,,The best by far,4.0,,"Awesome! It's quick, timely and relatively easy to find. It's constantly being upgraded with stations close to many tourists spots. Who needs uber when you got SMRT."
,,"Go anywhere anytime, quick & efficient",5.0,,We used the MRT everyday and at night to get to all the attractions -we also used the connecting buses to get to The Bird Park and Zoo
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,"The best and most practical way to move around Singapore is by using the MRT.
We bought a 3 day tourist pass and used it for getting to sentosa, Zoo, Orchard St and many more areas. Would highly recommend it and for $30 we defiantly got our money's worth."
,,Easy and affordable way to travel,5.0,,The SMRT service is easy to understand. If you're stuck or feeling confuse the staff are wonderful people who will help no matter how buzy the time of day or night. Very affordable way to get around and see Singapore.

,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Clean, safe, good value and a great way to get around and about Singapore. Air conditioned so really pleasant and necessary."
,,Great System,5.0,,Such an easy way to get about and very inexpensive. I was worried that it would be difficult but not confusing at all.
,,Cheap and easy,5.0,,"I was only in Singapore for a day, but for the whole day I paid $10 to get on any train or bus I wanted. Cheap, easy & fast - lift your game Australia!"
,,SMRT - The Best Of The Best,5.0,,"We have used metro rail systems in many locations around the world, and perhaps with the exception of Tokyo, there is no better metro rail service we know of. The trains run to schedule to the minute, are frequent, cheap to use, are spotlessly clean and run on a well designed network to take you wherever you want to go. There simply is no better way to travel around Singapore. The ability to purchase MRT tickets with credit cards on the ticketing machines would be an improvement, as they are cash only - make sure you have some $5 notes before joining the queue at the ticketing machines."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Best way to travel in Singapore. No eating and drinking. No litter. Paternalistic signs about being a considerate traveller - but they seem to work. Great value tourist pass. Highly recommended. Easy to use and gets you to most tourist destinations.
,,Love the MRT,5.0,,"This is one of the best Underground Systems that I have ever used. The stations are immaculate and clean - as are the trains themselves. Maps are easy to follow. The best way to see all the tourist sights. Buy a Tourist pass for 1 day, 2 days or 3 days, for unlimited trips on the MRT or the bus. These can be bought at ""selected"" MRT stations."
,,So easy,4.0,,"Getting around Singapore is extremely easy - bus-train - you just follow the color coding
Get the Elink pass and it covers bus/train/monorail
To go from China town to Clarke Quay $0.77 - the card expires in a few years so can keep and top up in next trip
Or just hand it back to get the balance
It is really so easy
Trains run every 4 min by the looks of it and is well signed to move around in the stations and of course all very clean"
,,Just Fantastic,5.0,,"I just love this system
It is underground going all round the actual city
Regular , clean and great
We bought a tourist 3 day pass from any train station ticket counter
It was $30 for 3 days and you can travel as much as you want on the MRT or public busses.
The you get a $10 refund when you leave If you take the ticket back"
,,Great way to get around,4.0,,"We use the MRT to get around Singapore. It is expanding more this year. By the time it is all done there won’t be a place you can’t get to. Quick, clean and reliable. Also nicely air conditioned."
,,Best. Transport. Ever.,5.0,,Why can't every underground system be like this? Why do I have to use any other transport system ever again?
,,Very well organized transit system,5.0,,"Very impressive transit system. Tickets are easy to buy at the kiosks. Some stations have tourist passes you can purchase for 1, 2 or 3 days, but there's a 10 dollar rental charge for the pass that you will receive when you return it after the term is over. Very clean trams and very efficient. Please note that you will need to use your ticket when you go into the train area to take your train, and upon exiting the station when your ride is over."
,,MRT,5.0,,"it is best transport system in singapore , you can go anywhere , there are more than 5 lines which are connected which each other, best system."
,,"Reliable, efficient and easy to navigate",5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) is efficient, clean, fast and very easy to navigate. My English-speaking mother and I were able to master the MRT within a day, and felt comfortable relying on it as a mode of transport within Singapore. It covers the major tourist attractions, comes regularly and is cost-effective."
,,Singapore Eye,5.0,,This is a must when you visit Singapore. We went on during the day but wished we had have gone at night as the view would have been something out of this world. You can then go and visit the Gardens by the Bay (just down the road) which is fantastic at night and also during the day.
,,Easy and functional,5.0,,Very efficient and best way of travelling - so easy to get to major attractions like the Botanical Gardens and other priorities.
,,Your ticket to ride! Most efficient way to get around,5.0,,"Tip: if you are planning on visiting Singapore for than a day, make sure you get each member of your party an MRT tourist pass at the airport after you arrive at any of the Changi Recommends counters. Those extra few minutes will save you a lot of time and money cos this pass gives you unlimited rides on all Mass Rapid Transit train as well as on all basic bus services. It's simply the best Tourist pass in the world! A 3 day unlimited pass for S$20 (about US$15) is a real steal! And if you miss getting it at the airport you can still get it at selected stations (google Singapore MRT Tourist pass). It's a real time saver - believe me the lines to get individual tickets for a single ride at the machine can get really long and sometime frustrating as folks figure out what to do. O also definitely get an MRT map for each member of your party or download one on your phones. With your pass and map, the options to get around Singapore is almost limitless and fun.

That said the MRT is THE best, most efficient and most economical way to get around and it's really not complicated at all. The trains are punctual and fast, the stations are clean and safe. After just a couple of rides, you will feel like an expert! Additionally a lot of the major stations are situated below or near major shopping malls and attractions so there are lots to see just walking out. If you need directions just stop and ask any station attendant, they are friendly and love to help."
,,"Easy, flexible, fast, cheap, comfortable...",5.0,,"Even if the taxi are cheap in Singapore, the MRT is very clean, cheap, comfortable, easy to access, the trains are driving very frequently, the informative boards are very helpful and easy understandable; there is almost always a station closed to a sight seeing. Definitely besides taxi the cheapest and most comfortable way to explore the city."
,,Easiest way to travel,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) was very helpful for us to travel all around the Singapore, its clean fast and cheap. we got our EZ link card which was useful to travel in SMRT as well in Bus."
,,"Perfect connection, ticketing system to improve",4.0,,"A very complete coverage of the city best places.
Very clean and well organized. Dedicated app useful for defining itinerary.
Weird the ticketing system, not so comfortable for tourists having the temporary card (valid for just 6 tracks and ...how to redeem the 10 cents?), must charge for the exact itinerary everytime, ...practically always in queue to the machine,"
,,System that works,5.0,,We used the MRT for the first time and found it extremely efficient and easy to use. We had to make changes from one line to another to get to Jurong Bird Park from Clarke Quay and return with ease.
,,Best Singapore transportation,5.0,,"This is the best transportation in singapore. Clean comfort and fast. The destination map are very helfpull, inside the MRT announcement for every station are very clear. Traveller just need to buy the EZ-link card in the convenient store (like 7eleven and others) or at the singapore tourit pass counter at the Changi airport."
,,Convenient and easy to navigate,5.0,,"This by far is the friendliest rail system I have tried. Very convenient and the rates are also fine. From airport to anywhere I intended to go, I just hopped on the train."
,,Fast and well managed,4.0,,"One of the most efficient transportation in the world. MRT is the nerve of Singapore which connects most of the places. And still building new lines and station, which is truly impressive"
,,faster way to get around,5.0,,"Tickets ate easy to buy on machines you can reload your first ticket so save 10c a time
Trains are frequent, spotless and marked in different colours like the underground
Announcements on the train tell you the next station
Staff on the station are helpful if you are on the wrong platform!
And like the underground if you get on the wrong train you just get off and head back the way you came
As to price one station cost $2.60 return"
,,Way to go MRT,5.0,,"I wanted to experience real travel rather than opt for the easy taxi option, and challenge myself to see if I could do it. I had to get from Changi to Marina Bay Sands, and did the research at home before I left. Armed with a rail network map and station numbers/names, I managed a 2 stop 3 train journey using spare coins. Buy your ticket from a vending machine for a single pass, or get a day/week pass from the ticket counter. Hardest thing was trying to ensure the train you boarded was going the right direction. Trains were clean, new and smooth, locals were helpful."
,,"Clean, fast and cheap",5.0,,A smart way to travel through this huge city. The trains come in time and are very clean (as it is in Singapore). Airco working. Very well organised!
,,Best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,Our first trip to Singapore and we discovered how easy and affordable the train system is. Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Singapore to use the trains. We purchased a 3 day pass and we'll and truly got our money's worth.
,,"Fast, timely, easy.",5.0,,"Taxis are easy too. But the metro is an excellent way to get lost and explore parts of the city you won't see with a taxi. Wandering and walking takes you to places you don't normally see and the metro is the best way to go far. It's easy - just buy a pass, charge it via cash or credit. Then just hop on a train or bus. Don't forget to check out when getting off the bus. Other than that have fun. It's one of the best public systems out there."
,,Getting around,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is really easy to use. You require a reloadable Marvel card ( tap on/ tap off). The lines are colour coded. There are maps at each station showing direction of travel and clear directions to help locate the appropriate platform ( sometimes 1 level under another). Trains are frequent, clean, quiet and litter free. ( very packed, depending on time of travel!) No one was making loud phone calls ( earphones and microphones close to their mouths) . Progress of the train was both displayed and announced, along with the side of the upcoming platform.
We travelled around the trains and buses for a week for about $20. Any money remaining on the card can be claimed back at Changi( or at train stations. You do not get the $5 card fee back)
Train travellers are very disciplined, both in obeying station signs re boarding trains, whilst allowing those getting off to exit first, as well as escalators, on which those standing still, do so on the left hand side.
Signs requesting elements of courtesy to make travel easier for everyone use quirky imaginative characters, which request, rather than demand."
,,Breakdowns & Delays,3.0,,Too many frequent breakdown and delay nowadays. Become really unreliable at times. Sometimes the breakdown and delay are at peak hour which are very bad when people commuting home/going work.
,,Near Perfect,5.0,,"The trains come every few minutes, spotless,safe and air conditioned the fares are roughly 77 cents anywhere. Can buy multi pass which allowes you to use buses. Have to pay $5 non refundable deposit on MRT card, When the balance drops to $2 it won't allow you to use it so you have to top it up, they also charge a fee to top up. If you have credit left on it you can cash it in when you leave Singapore at any station or at the Airport. It can get hot and humid in Singapore and it is a relief when you cannot walk far, it's best to use the trains. I was wrapped in how efficient their transport system is."
,,Stand up Stacey!,5.0,,"Great system. Very easy to navigate around. Clean. Even at rush hour not too busy. Most fun thing, for us, was the helpful guidance signs - see photos. As far as social control and nanny state goes, at least they made us smile!"
,,Nice fast and clean,5.0,,"A really easy way to travel around in Singapore. Just buy a prepaid card and it can start, drive with bus and underground in the hole city. Everything is clean and I feel me all the time save. The prices are top very cheap"
,,Really Cheap Way To Get Around Singapore,5.0,,"Struggled initially to work out routes etc but that's to be expected in a different country.

They do a 3 day pass for 30 Singapore Dollars that gave you free travel all around Singapore on the MRT and the buses and certain trains.

The tube trains are spotless and spacious.

Excellent system would recommend it to anyone even with children"
,,FRIENDLY SMRT,5.0,,Choosing MRT getting round Singapore is a really good choice both money wise and time saving. Easy access to each and every important places and many more tourist attractions in Singapore. You can buy ez link prepaid cards at MRT stations or top up them very easily which needs to tap at the stations to pay toll. Singapore owns one of the most sophisticated MRT services in the world.
,,"Simple, cheap, best way to travel through Singapore",5.0,,Its a convenient way to travel through Singapore. It is very easy to buy a ticket as you can select the station via map.
,,Above Average Metro System,3.0,,"Clean and polite, and above average relative to most Asian cities (and AMAZING compared to the British Underground). Would rank it above Seoul and Shenzhen, but below Tokyo and Hong Kong."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"The MRT is clean, user friendly and quick. It covers an extensive area of Singapore and is relatively cheap. There are season tickets, one, two or three day passes as well as other packages for tented stays. The stations are clean and well signed with staff available if you need assistance. The information given on the trains at each stop is clear and helpful."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Inexpensive, clean, reliable, cool. Can't fault it at all. Easily the least expensive way to get into the city from the airport ($2.50)."
,,Such an easy system,5.0,,"I'm from perth Australia - our trains are just a nightmare. The MRT is not - very cheap, simple to use and safe. The best way to get around."
,,Punctual and Clean!,5.0,,anyone visiting Singapore should definitely opt for the Singapore MRT. It is very easy to navigate and the trains and buses are always on time.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Children ride unattended to and from school (like, elementary ages). This is safe. Clean. ""amazing"" (I hate that word, but it applies!) - nothing like what is in the US. You can get anywhere - the majority of residents do not have cars, and no need!"
,,SUPER EFFICIENT AND EXCELLENT VALUE,5.0,,"Our hotel - One Farrer- linked in easily to the MRT so we decided to use a 3-day tourist pass. What an excellent, super efficient transport system which was trouble free to use and proved excellent value...just SG$ 20 for 3 days ( when card is returned to collect deposit). At no stage did we need to wait longer than 4mins for the next train and the cleanliness of the entire system puts other city MRTs to shame !
Despite torrential rainfall at times, the city gave extensive shelter both above ground and of course when underground, so we couldn't recommend the MRT more highly."
,,Efficient and Affordable,5.0,,It's so easy to go around the many community centers and tourist attractions through the SMRT. It's one of the best in the world and I can't see any bad points. The staff who run it are all polite.
,,Clean safe and very helpful,4.0,,We spent entire day on buses and train and found everyone to be friendly and helpful. Senior discounts are only for LOCALS which is discriminatory against tourists.... very clean and safe.
,,One of best subway systems in world,5.0,,"Quick, easy and gets you to all tourist locations. I use daily for getting to work and many dining sites. Often compared to Hong Kong, but I find Singapore has better range of destinations than HK by far."
,,Easy to use - recommended form of transport,4.0,,"During our time we used this method (with buses).
If I wanted to keep it short and sweet I would say, ""Easy, fast and cheap!""

I am not a train person at all! Even in my home country I couldn't remember when I used the train last, but even for someone like myself I found it relatively easy to understand (being honest I did get on the train going the opposite way sometimes - but hey still the right line at least and the next train doesn't take too long)
The best part is it stops at most of the major tourist areas ✨

Note: you need to buy a card and top it up with money to use the train system (not expensive). At the end of the trip you can return it and get your money back or keep it as a momento like I did"
,,Expensive better to take taxi,2.0,,"A bit of a shame that SMRT is not properly connected to major tourist attractions. You have to make a few transfers and also combine with bus. You end up wasting lot of time. Also, it is not a cheap option specially if you are 4 or more people, most of the time you will find taxi efficient both in terms of money and time.

A city that claims to be very well planned and organised should at least have an SMRT track which connects all tourist attractions. Otherwise, in its current avatar its a bit of a let down for tourists."
,,"Efficient as long as no stoppages, a contradiction I know....",3.0,,"The MRT, as it is called, is relatively efficient only so long as there are no stoppages.
Stoppages are common starting from a few years ago and is probably a reflection of the age of the system that has been in use since 1987 although there are new lines being added every year(s).
However as it is now so heavily utilised (or over utilized, dare I suggest!), the trains now truly reek of ""stench of public transport"" (a comment first coined by an expatriate fund manager whose comment was not kindly taken and who was then forced to take up self-exile in Perth, Australia. But, although impolite to say it while being a guest in the country, what he said is now not untrue, unfortunately for himself then and for the MRT now. For this reason and for the really packed-sardine conditions during peak hours and moderate peak hours (Yes, it can be sardine-packed even during moderate peak hours), I prefer to use the buses!
Another pet peeve of mine is that of commuters carrying back-pack being inconsiderate by swinging their bodies around or squeezing past you and leaving scratch marks on your body and your clothing!! Why can't these people carry the bags in front as a front-pack whilst in the trains???"
,,Excellent Public Transport,5.0,,One of the best public transport in the world. MRT connects you to almost every part of Singapore and the fares are very reasonable.
,,Zip along underground,5.0,,"The MRT is fast efficient and cheap, I used it every day for 5 days and spent less than $10. Maps are everywhere but easiest to download the app.
Would benefit from a trip planner function though like the Melbourne system.
Everything is colour coded and easy to follow."
,,Fast transfer,5.0,,"No need to pay a Taxi to move from one place to another, fallowing MRT maps is cheaper.
However you can't see the city view, But there are Bus in the stations that you can seat on second deck for a perfect tour and cheaper than the touristic Bus."
,,Mass & Rapid as the name says,5.0,,"Easiest and the fastest way to travel around Singapore. Need a travel pass which can be used with buses as well. If you're a traveler who is planning on taking only 2-3 rides, don't buy the pass for $12 which has a $5 deposit. If you're not, then you should definitely buy a pass which will save you a lot instead of buying tickets for each ride.

Trains will be available very frequent and they only charge for the distance no matter how many trains you took or the path you traveled within 2 hours. Very efficient.

You cannot drink or eat in trains and don't bring flammable materials and ""Duriyan""! They will fine you! Reserved seats are available for those who needed! Trains have dedicated spaces for wheel chairs!"
,,Integrated Transportation,5.0,,MRT in Singapore is very good. It is connected to BRT and LRT as well. What makes it great is unlimited trip by using Singapore Tourist Pass Card.
,,Easy to use and efficient,4.0,,"I used the MRT quite a bit during my stay - as transport from the airport and to get me around the city. I found it easy to use and trains left frequently. I got the Singapore tourist card, which gave me unlimited use of trains and buses for 2 days (you can get 1-, 2-, and 3-day cards). I don't know how this would have compared cost-wise to getting a normal card and topping up, but I appreciated the flexibility the card offered me."
,,Best train service in the world,5.0,,"The mts is an awesome service.

We paid 12sgd for our travel card which included 7sgd worth of travel. This almost lasted a week.

Even easy to use to and from the airport is only a couple of sgd dollars.

We used it to travel to the Singapore zoo and the jurong bird park and it was a 30min train ride and then a bus - 20 mins to the night zoo and 10mins to bird park.

We were very impressed with the cleanliness on trains and stations and the punctuality of the service.

You cannot eat or drink anywhere on the stations or trains."
,,crowded but quite safe transport,4.0,,"During our visit to Singapore last September, we used the MRT several times. It is cheap and avoids the road bottlenecks that are quite frequent in Sinpagore in spite of the ERP!
Though there are special seats for old persons and preggy ladies right on the side of the MRT entrances, however also younger people occupie these seats and rarely samoone stands up to give the seat to those who need it.
Hence be prepared to stand in the trains and ypu can reach your destination fast."
,,Easy and fast,5.0,,Wonderful transit system - easy to figure out how to go. I never was lost in my wandering and was surprised at the lovely locations I ended up in when I walked out of a station.
,,Depends on the hours.,4.0,,"If u take the ride after 6pm onwards there will be no seat at all. Best to take the mrt is at 9am-6pm to avoid crowd but still u can always stand, strictly no food and drinks is allowed, thats is why smrt is always clean, you wont get lost just grab a map, follow the colors and the name of the stations, sometimes there is a train breakdown but its not all the time , its just time consuming if youre rushing.

Easy to get anywhere, my favourite is the circle line fast and efficient"
,,Train system is getting old,2.0,,"It used to serve the people well for the past 10-20 years but there have been lots if breakdown and delay causing much disruption to it's passengers, passengers who depend on a reliable train system for day to day life. I hope the different upgrading and replacement will bring back that once reliable train system to the people."
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Well connected, must carry a map so that you do not get lost in the network. Fast and quite efficient."
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,"Took the MRT from City Hall, Swissotel at Stamford to Changi Airport and it was not only a smooth ride, it was fast and efficient."
,,Value for money & highly recommended,5.0,,Singapore have the most efficient transpo in the world... they have trains in every corner... its very fast from point to point. Ezlink is very cheap & affordable... if you got child get a child concession for tourist... get it smrt passanger service they are very helpful show your child passport... cheers!
,,Convenient and efficient transport,5.0,,"Travelled to and from the airport and to Santosa island easily.
We did not wait longer than 5 minutes for a train even when we had to change lines. The trains as well as the stations are kept clean and secured.
Train rates are much cheaper than taxis."
,,Very convenient!!!,5.0,,Could not ask for improvements. Indeed Singapore has the best transportation in the world - easy to follow.
,,Great Transport,5.0,,Very easy to get around on the underground trains. And it is airconditioned! If you are there for a few days you can get travel passes which are unlimited travel for however many days you buy. Worked out to be quite cheap.
,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,"Singapore has one of the most cleanest and efficient MRT compared to other countries eg. London, Paris and New York. The stations and trains are very clean. We had a 5 month old baby with us and we no issues about dust or unhygienic environment unlike systems in other countries.

We took the train from Plaza Singapura to Orchard Road. The only problem we had was the connection from Plaza Singapura was rather complicated. We had to walk a long way and go up and down 2 elevators to get to our platform. I reckon Plaza Singapura was a main connection and had so many lines passing through it that’s why train platforms were on many different level.

Overall I highly recommend using Singapore’s MRT as a quick and convenient way to get around the island."
,,Amazing transport service,5.0,,You can't go past using the MRT. Fantastic way to get around Singapore. Everyone is always willing to give up their seats for the elderly or parents with young children. Lots of signage to find your way around really easy.
,,Magic,5.0,,The MRT is clean efficient and vrry rffective. We bought Toutist Travel Passes. Cost 30 Singapore Dollars for 3 dsys unlomited travel on the umderground and buses. Everyone we spoke to was helpful. There were clear direction and the trains and buses arrived on time every time
,,Best Metro Ever,5.0,,"Excellent service, very easy to use and 100% clean, you wouldn't believe how clean it is. Best i've ever seen."
,,Clean and efficient,4.0,,"During a recent stay in Singapore I used the MRT to get around the city. It's very easy to use, safe, clean, cheap and efficient."
,,The best transport system by far,5.0,,"If in Singapore for a few days or just a stop-over use the transport system, its easy, cheap and if you get stuck just look at a railway map in every station, look at the signs everywhere, or asked. My husband and I just can’t believe how easy, and friendly everybody is to help out, tickets can be topped up everywhere. The trains are so clean that when people drop something they pick it up, there are big fines for littering, so remember that. The driverless train are fast and are right on time to the second. It great to see people not sit in the elderly persons sits or stand and offer their sits to their elders. Trains in Australia should run this well. I think both of us would die of shock if that ever happened. Here in Singapore not one person is out of work, the more you work, the more you get paid. A great system for a great city. Try it you will enjoy it."
,,Get a daypass,5.0,,"The SMRT is fast, efficient, clean and comfortable. When visiting Singapore, get a 1-2-or 3 day pass. Note the price includes a card deposit of SD10,- that you het back when you nring back the card. The prices are therefor less than what you initially have to pay.
I ised the 2 day pass to randomly ride the MRT around town and got to see Singapore in a few hours. Get off anywhere or change trains whenever you want."
,,Driverless,4.0,,"We only tried the MRT a couple of times, but were surprised to see that the trains are driverless. It was rather deserted, perhaps our line was not busy at that time of the day, but busses appear to be more efficient in getting you closer to your destination and offer a bit of sightseeing in the process."
,,MRT Ride,5.0,,"If you are traveller then, kids under 7 year old can get free card, Please take your passport to Ticketing office. This card issuing facility is available only at few MRT stations."
,,Tourist card?,5.0,,"Bought a 'top up card' rather than a tourist day card - think it works out cheaper as we needed to use taxis from airport, to the zoo, .... for convenience and time saving."
,,SMART SMRT!,5.0,,Highly recommend. 87cents on most routes. Driverless trains. Spotless and safe. Must do and so practical to get around.
,,High recommended,5.0,,"Fast, driverless, easy to use, super cheap and safe. I had no problems to use public transporte in Singapore."
,,Great Transport,5.0,,"We have been to Singapore well over 30 times since we first visited in 1978 with our children. We have seen many changes and the MRT has been the best improvement over the years. It is quick, rapid and takes you anywhere you want to go."
,,Easy to use,4.0,,I bought a tourist pass for 2 days (can get different number of days). Easy to get around but there may be a walk if you change lines at some stations. Very clean and frequent services.
,,Singapore you have a awesome MRT,5.0,,"The best thing about the MRT is its on time you can go just about anywhere and its cheap. My wife and I got a Singapore tourist card after the second day there after one of the MRT customer service ladies told us it was the way to go and man was she right.
Ten dollars for the card (which you get back) we got our $20 for two cards at the airport as we were leaving. Max of three days you can load on the card each time and away you go on any bus or train or the under ground train easy as.
What we will do next time we go to Singapore is get the green line from the airport to another line to our motel is air cond fast and super easy.
We took each line and went to the very end of the line go out and walked around in the non tourist areas had a beer at Farjar with people that didn't speak English.Also we got out at every stop in the 12 days we were there The MRT must of made zero money out of us as we killed our cards LOL
If you love train type stuff you have to go one the grey lines they are just so cool

and remember ""We are happy happy you on platform"" if you don't hear that 100 times you haven't used the MRT much LOL"
,,One of the best,4.0,,The MRT system is quick and efficient. The stations are organized and clean with plenty of maps and signs for the confused tourist. Downside is that the ticket machines were cranky and can get frustrating to use for the first time.
,,Efficient and functional,5.0,,If you've been in London or Paris you will feel home soon after got in the MRT. One more detail is cleaner than anyother subway I saw in my life. From Changi Airport to Jurong West is 1 hour!
,,"Easy, efficient way to get around.",5.0,,"Wish we had transport like this in all Australian cities! Take a few rides to master but easy, cheap and efficient way to travel everywhere in Singapore. We let our teenager travel and navigate himself - it is safe and easy.
BEWARE - make sure you have return tickets or EZlink cards with money on them if catching MRT from Gardens by the Bay (Bayfront CE1 on the circle line) - only 2 machines at each end with huge queues at night."
,,Easy...,5.0,,"A cheap and convenient way to navigate your way around Singapore. Trains are spotless, and frequent.... it’s so easy to use too."
,,A very reliable and cheap way to travel arnd singapore,4.0,,"Always been a fan of public transport of singapore especially the mrt. Stations well signage. Tickets machine plenty and friendly user if u can read english. Staffs were helpful at most times. Most stations have lifts for Those handicapped, elderly, women and children even strollers. Trains were clean, air conditioned. Busy during certain hours understandbly."
,,"Safe, simple to use and clean",5.0,,"No doubt, best way to get around Singapore. Stations are clearly marked and staff are very helpful. Tickets a bit pricey but the service and convenience is excellent."
,,Easy enough,5.0,,"Once you get a hang of it, it's easy to operate. They've got 5 routes - east to west, north to south, circle, downtown and a random north west one. What confused us is that there's stop names, but also numbers - so e.g. SN22, SN23 etc. You can purchase tickets in the stations by picking your end stop and it'll calculate the cost based on the zones. Both our journeys included central and were S$1.9 each. Beware though that the machine only gives back up to S$4 and might not accept card, so have some smaller currency on hand. The train itself is clean (less seating areas than in other major cities) and spacious and it's easy to understand where you are and where to get off."
,,"On time, neat and good frequency",4.0,,Most convenient way to travel around places in Singapore. Almost all sites in Singapore have a MRT stop near by
,,Best I've Been On,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is to exceptionally easy to use. It's fast, clean and very efficient. We live in Singapore and see no reason to buy a car with mass transit like this."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"The MRT system is excellent. We purchased 2 and 3 day tourist passes, which let you on the subway and buses unlimited times. The subway is clean, fast and safe, and very easy to follow. Our MRT station was below the Fairmont Singapore which was super."
,,Super efficient and cheap,4.0,,The mrt is a great way to get around. The stations are well laid out and maps are easily available. The cars platforms and stations are clean and well kept. Easy as !
,,Holiday,5.0,,Great transport system and easy to use. Would recommend getting a Tourist Pass to save messing about with ticket machines.
,,Fantastic Transport System.,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system is fabulous. It is clean, incredibly reliable, air conditioned and trains run every couple of minutes.
If you are a tourist invest in a Singapore Tourist Pass; available in 1, 2 or 3 day passes. It is the equivalent of a Myki or Opal card here in Australia. That way you do not have to purchase individual tickets and travel costs are capped daily.
Hand your card back in within 5 days of purchase for a $10 SD refund."
,,Efficient and easy!,5.0,,The Singapore MRT system is probably the easiest to navigate subway system I've ever used in a big city. It's clean and safe. I hear a few complaints here and there from people about it breaking down but I've never experienced that myself. My 15 yo son rides it back and forth to school everyday and uses it on the weekend to meet up with his friends. I highly recommend it if you are visiting Singapore. The only thing that is a bit annoying is that the automated machines only allow you to use certain credit cards (a couple of local banks) to load money or buy the MRT card. You have to go to a device desk usually or get cash from the ATM and then use it at the machine.
,,Excellent coverage at amazing prices,4.0,,The coverage of MRT is superb. Very close and convenient stops and well connected. Prices too are quite competitive. Must use for all transport needs
,,Inexpensive way to get around !,5.0,,"Clean stations, great connections, comfortable trains. The only downside is that it's completely underground so there are no views .."
,,Best way of in city travels,5.0,,We bought two EZ LINK cards at airport with 20SGD credit in each and during our 5 days stay in singapore that was enough.
,,Highly affordable and very reliable,5.0,,"This was the highlight of our singapore tour. in an expensive city like singapore cabs can make a big hole in the pocket. MRT is very affordable and is connected to the length and breadth of the city.
It gives you the experience of being in singapore and travelling like most singaporeans do
A 2 day tourist pass will cost 40 dollars for unlimited rides."
,,MRT rides are scary,1.0,,Prayers and a heart of steel required given the frequency of break downs. Worried that the train would break down every time I am on it!
,,comfortable travel.,4.0,,It was easy to move with Metro having clear details of stoppages stations marked on gate screen. I feel as if I am traveling in Delhi Metro.
,,Best MRT,5.0,,Easy to use and well connected to all parts of the city. I found the MRT to be the best mode for travel in Singapore.
,,One of the best global metros,5.0,,"The SMRT is one of the best Metros in the world. It is cheap, regular, safe, clean, reliable and frequent.
It gets exceptionally crowded during the morning and evening rush hours, but outside these times is quite comfortable and is a fast way to get around the city.
Most stations have multiple exits from long underground passages, so be careful to select the correct station exit, which are all clearly labeled."
,,Easy way to travel,5.0,,"Let the train take the strain out of the long distance between tourist highlights Easy to use and very efficient, clean and tidy"
,,How Underground Travels Should Be.,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, organised, fairly priced, air conditioned. Singapore’s MRT system puts others to shame. Sustainable tickets system and passenger etiquette explained its simply the nicest transportation system in the world in my view.

Having been in London before arriving in Singapore, the MRT is miles better than the London Underground."
,,Time is very precise,5.0,,"Public transport is the cheapest way to travel in Singapore but make sure you are back before 12am and make sure you keep your glass shoes. Anyway, GrabCar and UBER are alternate options."
,,How public transport should work,5.0,,"Fast and convenient. After 2 days we were experts at changing lines to get to our final destination. You can buy tickets from the machine for every trip, but buying an EZ link card at a 7 Eleven and topping it up with a credit card is the way to go (it also works for the Sentosa Monorail).

The aircon is not as good as Bangkok, but it is acceptable.

And when something goes wrong, staff are friendly and helpful. Not like in Melbourne!"
,,"Fast, clean and inexpensive",5.0,,We are using the MRT quite a lot. Singapore is too hot to walk much but the MRT is fast and cool and really well connected all over the city. And so inexpensive compared to other world class transit systems.
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Great underground system and an easy way to explore the city when the heat and humidity gets too much for you.

The trains we used were always on time and spotlessly clean. The whole system was safe and easy to use with lots of staff on hand if you need any help.

One point to remember is don't throw away your ticket after 1st use. If you top them up at the ticket machines you get money off the next ticket! Great idea."
,,Train ride,3.0,,"Lately, the mrt system here in Singapore is far from reliable, especially the North South bound. I recently took a ride from Kranji to Jurong East Interchange after my day trip to Johore Central.
The train stopped on its tracks abruptly upon reaching the last stop and the delay was 10 minutes, not sure if that was due to delays at the station or another signalling fault."
,,Slow and stuffy trains,3.0,,Trains were expectionally hot on EW line! Slow and stopping every now and then. Wasting a lot of time! Must plan to go out earlier now as trains are always stopping in between causing everyone to be late
,,Perfect system,5.0,,"Clean, safe, easy, efficient... everything in Singapore works perfectly. I wish my country copy at least one of their practices!"
,,Easy way to go anywhere in Singapore,5.0,,"It's easy to go anywhere with this MRT. The train is very clean and comfortable and it seems all follow the rules. Schedules are also on time. We enjoying going to Bugis, Orchard, Sommerset, and many places with this MRT. The staff at the card purchase place is also helpfull. Beside taxi, this transportation is the best choices."
,,gtg from bad to worst...,5.0,,travel speed on the trains is gtg slower... try the DTL lines which are newer than the green color one.
,,Superb Service,5.0,,One day we might actually have something like this in Sydney - but just how long is it going to take?
,,Highly recommend travel by MRT,5.0,,"The MRT system is excellent, once you get your head around it, very clean & efficient, we didn't always know which exit to take but i expect you can google if you know where you want to go."
,,The cleanest train in the world,5.0,,"The trains in Singapore are unbelievably nice. You could eat off the floor in the coaches I was in. Plus, people are very polite and they seem to get you where you need to go. Overall, a thumbs up for the train."
,,Travel,3.0,,Use this as the main transport to travel around singapore. Easily and accessible to anywhere. But have a backup plan for incase of break down
,,10/10 for this MRT system,5.0,,"One of the things I will remember forever and this public transport system is iconic for other countries to follow ... flawless connectivity from one station to another... most of the stations are well connected and quickly reachable .

Travellers can buy 20 SGD pass for 3 Days for unlimited usage ...

Superbly managed and state of are stations ...

One should experience this ..."
,,Simple transport system,4.0,,Very easy system to get into being a tourist in the city. Buying tickets at the machine is very simple. I downloaded an app for my phone which works offline so does not need data or phone connection once downloaded and you put in wheee you are and where you want to go and tells you what lines to get and hownong it takes etc. Veryy very handy
,,Smooth riding,4.0,,Still the same clean and always on time better then taking taxi or driving a car cheap and reliableS
,,Great ride,4.0,,Clean and efficient is the words coming to my mind. All the signs are clearly posted. You can hide away from the heat here. Get a oyster type card and use it for five years
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,We went around Singapore City usning the SMRT so fast and very cheap.From the airport to our hotel.For almost 2 weeks holiday in Singapore we travel by MRT. Fast and efficient transpo.
,,Number one mode of public transportation in Singapore,4.0,,"This is a very swift, cheap and efficient way to travel throughout Singapore. Lots of stations, high frequency. Can, of course, be very busy during rush hours."
,,"Efficient, cheap, convenient",5.0,,"Much much better than the underground in London. I realise that London could never do this now anyway, but it was so clean and generally uncrowded. I missed the buskers though. This would never be allowed in Singapore along with no eating or drinking on the trains. No one talks , they just use mobiles or watch films on their phones !, ! No one makes eye contact in case they have to speak to you. I did see one person actually reading a book."
,,"Clean, Cheap, Clockwork - Easy to Navigate",5.0,,"So impressed out how easy the system was to use. Figure our where you are where you want to go plug it into the screen buy a ticket go to the platform wait a couple of minutes. A great subway arrives enclosed behind sliding doors, courteous people wait to let people out, you get on. All respect for the elderly, children and pregnant ladies. The voice announcements keep you informed. If you are lucky to get a seat and can see yourself if the curved windows opposite look at yourself... So funny like the magic mirrors at a theme park. Great system and easy for the tourist."
,,Great connectivity,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore for atleast a week, highly recommend you use MRT.
Its clean, has great connectivity, instructions and directions to changes lines are very clear.
There are some good shops down in the MRT stations for you to pick a quick bite (p.s. don't eat during the ride though)

I would recommend getting Ez link card instead of the tourist pass (cost of which is 5 dollar non-refundable fee), as it is very convenient and available at all stations unlike tourist pass, can be recharged using your VISA or MasterCard.

As a tourist, you will mostly use circle line, north-east line and downtown line, all of which are very well connected.

Tip: if you are taking a ticket (equivalent of token in India), sometimes there are vending machines that will not accept anything other than coins or 2 dollar notes, so keep it handy too. Also you can buy these tickets only using cash. The tickets can be bought only using vending machines."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"I cannot express how good public transport is in Singapore, the trains run about every 4 mins super clean young people get up for older people, everyone waits for people to get off before getting in easy to use subway running north south,and east west.the transport system in Sydney could learn a lot from this system well done Singapore"
,,Please can we have one of these in Melbourne?!!,5.0,,"Clean, fast, efficient, safe, constant, cheap and goes everywhere. What else can you say or ask for. Oh, the helpful staff - got that as well. One of the best in the world, if not the best."
,,Good transportation,5.0,,"Good transport,clean,fast,cheap,on time and easy to find the station. Make it easier to visit a beautiful places in singapore."
,,"Excellent, easy service.",5.0,,Very cheap and easy way of getting around. Highly recommend using this. We were a bit confused at first but a lovely lady was on hand to assist the tourists and helped us. In actual fact it was really easy to use.
,,Amazing Transit System,5.0,,"One of, if not, the best transit systems in the world. Multiple language announcements including English. On time, efficient, and incredibly clean. The NYC transit system could learn a thing or two from Singapore's SMRT. It was fantastic!"
,,Easy to connect,5.0,,The MRT system is a very easy way to connect you with the main tourist attractions around the city. The trains are clean and the network easy to explore.
,,Fantastic transport,5.0,,The SMRT is the most efficient low-cost way in which to get around the city and to / from the airport. It is extremely clean too and very safe.
,,fastest & cheapest mean of transport to rome around singapore,5.0,,fastest & cheapest mean of transport to rome around singapore. Good connectivity. Peaceful journey. Arrives within no time.
,,Very clean and easy to use!,4.0,,"The TTC needs to take lessons. These trains are clean and well organized.

We bought the Singapore Tourist card at Orchard station. It can also be purchased at the airport and a few other stations. This makes it very easy to get around without worrying about refilling a card

The subway was easy to use. There were only a few times we got confused and someone was able to help point us in the right direction

You can get a refund for the card of $10 at the airport MRT station. No forms or questions - very quick."
,,My experience with Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT),4.0,,"I find that SMRT is a very effective and efficient transport system to visit most places of interest in Singapore Island. You don't have to wait too long to catch the next train if you miss the earlier one. It is so convenient to travel from the airport to most part of the city and the charges are reasonable. One notable feature of the SMRT stations is that you travel from one interchange to another without having to get out of the station! Most of the stations especially within the city center and major areas, you can easily find shopping malls, restaurants and food courts. Sometimes, you can walk comfortably from one place to another underground or within shopping complexes without experiencing the hot and humid weather outside. I find it fascinating to travel to different stations and experience the different and unique environment around each station and its places of interest. Bravo to the Singapore government for its well planned mass transport system!"
,,Fantastic connectivity,5.0,,Clean and mostly on time and extensive network . Eating ..drinking is banned like all other metros in the world but here u will face stiff fines
,,Excellent System,5.0,,"After living in England for 5 years and riding their Tube system, I can honestly say the SMRT is luxurious, efficient and should be replicated in other countries. Amazed by how often the trains arrive and depart. The lines are easy to figure out and the stations are immaculate. The SMRT certainly made getting around and exploring a pleasure."
,,SMRT is the standard others need to match,5.0,,"Australia needs to start this system of transport and sell all the land taken up with tracks to help pay for it - yes it'll take half a lifetime to do it, but the clock will stop one day if we don't. Singapore can be proud of their achievement in such a short time."
,,Use the smrt!,5.0,,"Efficient, clean, safe and air conditioned- a great way to travel around singapore. Stations were spotlessly clean, no graffiti and staff very helpful. Really easy to navigate. If you are arriving at the airport you can use this to get to your hotel in town. It cost us $2.40 each. There is an app you can download which helps with trip planning. On board peopke are quiet and courteous. I don't think we purchased the best ticket type so make sure you research on the forums before you go. We were only there 3 days so weren't too fussed. Why can't all transport systems be like this? We did catch taxis too, but on reflection the subway was faster..."
,,Unreliability of NS and EW MRT lines,2.0,,"Expect breakdowns/delays/track fault/signalling fault on a daily basis especially during the mornibg and evening rush hours.

SMRT does not provide prompt updates anymore due to frequent faults and breakdowns.

SMRT does not have adequate and effective contingencies and alternative plans in crowd control and human traffic re-direction during train breakdowns and train faults."
,,Absolutely brilliant!!,5.0,,"No drivers, no timetable. Easy to follow routes and well signed. Awesome experience. Recommend use of the MRT to/from airport."
,,"Easy, cheap & fast",5.0,,"Singapore has a very well controlled transit system. Clean, cheap and fast. All over the city. Short intervals."
,,It's a train Jim ...but what a train!,5.0,,"Modern, clean, quiet, cool and generally reliable, especially if the maintenance dollars are kept up. The MRT is probably the best way to get around Singapore - at least until you work out how the buses work. Cheap, clean and quiet."
,,the route so clear. very accessible for wheelchair & baby stroller.,5.0,,the route so clear. very accessible for wheelchair & baby stroller. I think its the cheapest way to going around Singapore beside walking.
,,Unreliable train system,1.0,,EWL (green) & NSL (red) lines broke down few times every week. You are better off taking taxi or grab/uber as more of transportation
,,"Fast, efficent and clean",5.0,,The MRT is a wonderful affordable and reliable way to travel around the island and is always clean. The great placement of stations around the island makes travel easy to anywhere in Singapore.
,,Fastest Cheapest way around Singapore,5.0,,"If you are a regular visitor to Singapore then purchase an ezlink card from the help full staff before passing through the gates of their SMRT system normally a $5.00 deposit plus a load of 10.00 will do this lasts us for ages as the trips are inexpensive.
This card will also cover their bus system as well."
,,Train service needs improving,3.0,,"The frequent breakdown of MRT service is becoming the norm rather than exception. Causing huge inconveniece to commuters.

When there are no disruptions in services, the frequency of train service is also disappointing. In addition to that , the stop that the train takes at every station is frustratingly long.

Alot of improvements are really needed."
,,Daily Encounter with SMRT,2.0,,"It’s one of the few public transportation modes that we enjoy. Of late, there are delays and slower services, all in the name of “testing signals”, “tracks replacements”.
Well, just call it plain delay as our service is getting old, no excuses please! Also, asking commuters to plan ahead is as good as telling us to leave Home earlier.
One thing can can help us for commuters to be civil minded and MOVE into the center of the cars instead of hogging around the doors. If you do not need to travel during rush hours, stay home!"
,,Fantastic rail system,5.0,,Travelled with 2 young children a number of times and found the train to be clean and easy to navigate even with a massive double stroller. Great way to get around Singapore
,,Poor rating,1.0,,"Frequent breakdowns of late. Very crowded during peak hours. Do not expect to get in on 1st attempt. Need to queue. Daily stop and starts especially at the station stops with doors opening and closing for no reason.
This is all acceptable if only the govt would accept responsibility. Instead they throw satistics at the people saying how much they have improved over the years per km and how they have quoted people's survey on how satisfied they are with the MRT!
SMRT still making millions every year. Govt proposing a car-lite society but they all drive cars and never take public transport."
,,Safe and so easy way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Probably one of the safest, cleanest and easiest metro in the World! Singapore is one the the safest city in the world, and its metro as well: it is not only safe, but also very clean, cheap and easy to use it. Special cards for 1-2-3 days as tourists."
,,Best way to and from the Airport,5.0,,"We used the SMRT to get to and from our hotel on Orchard Road and the Airport. The trains are clean, quick and convenient. The system was easy to navigate for a tourist and is inexpensive. There's really no reason not to take the train from the airport to get to downtown.
The cars are spacious so even with our luggage space was not an issue- even when the cars were reasonably full."
,,"On time, clean, efficient and cheap underground mass rapid transit",5.0,,"Singapore's mrt network is easy tu use, efficient and on time. Like in other big cities in the world, rush hour morning and late afternoon are the most frenetic times at the mrt stations. Sometimes the carriages are full and it is diffucult to get on but eventually you manage to get on. Arriving about every 4 minutes it is an excellent service. Carriages are clean with food and drink banned in both the station and on the train. With new lines being developed and more stations being created the mrt service takes you quickly to most places on the island. Need to butyan mrt card at the airport, buy a one day or whatever card you need then collect refund on card when you leave."
,,Excellent and Cheap mode of Travel within Singapore.,5.0,,"MRT and it's network is an efficient, clean, safe and cheap mode of transport in singapore. The punctuality is well known. Every attraction/location is so well connected, one never needs to worry about taxi/cabs. Even the bus network is very well connected. Also the directions and maps are very accurate, no need of any training."
,,Extreme logistics,5.0,,"Surely the most efficient people mover ever. To get around Singapore by MRT is easy, quick, safe, enjoyable. Trains arrive about every 3 minutes, directions are easy to follow and the cost is really low.

,,"Good, can be better",3.0,,"Used to be really good and efficient, however SMRT is starting to break down frequently and increasing price at the same time. This affects working adults especially during peak.

Having posters of how hardworking staffs are does not help, it is a problem with the top management."

Regularity, Speed, price and Efficiency are beyond reproach."

,,SMRT THE MIST EFFICIENT WAY TO MOVE ABOUT SINGAPORE,5.0,,"The SMRT is possibly the most efficient way to move around Singapore. By getting a stored-valued card it's also faster and avoid queues.

If you are familiar with the underpass network about the various SMRT Stations' exits you would also be able to get to your destinations easily and enjoy cooler air-conditioned routes avoiding the fairly hot summer weather (or the occasionally stormy downpours) along the main roads outside the SMRTS.

The SMRTS connect to most major Visitors' key destinations, Malls and sections of Singapore. It's convenient! Enjoy your ride!!"

,,Singapore subway is what other cities dream of having,5.0,,"It's impeccably clean, meticulously organized, trains run every few minutes and go practically everywhere. New York wishes it was like this. Once we took one subway I gave up Uber and taxis and travelled exclusively by subway. Half the stations smelled like baking pastries, stations were air conditioned retreat from heat. Less intimidating than Japanese trains at rush hour. Super easy to use and tourists can get cheap passes at airport."
,,Mass Rapid Transport,5.0,,This is a fantastic system. You cannot fault it. The trains are regular they are very clean and everyone is very polite
,,Easy way to trip between destinations,5.0,,"We got the 3 day Tourist Pass which was perfect for our travel. Costs $30 and you get a $10 refund when you return the card.

Per card a 10 SGD deposit.."
,,Great network making it easy to see the Island,5.0,,"Cheap way to get around. If there are more than three of you, it can often be cheaper to catch a cab - and sometimes more time efficient as there is sometime a bit of a walk between platforms for trains. It is a very easy to use system; the ticket machines are super easy; and the system maps very informative. When you get to the different stations there is plenty of signage to help you decide which exit you need to take. I love the system and use it whenever in Singapore."
,,Awesome! No other form of transportation needed!,5.0,,"We arrived to the Singapore airport and purchased and EasyLink pass for S$12. Highly recommended. The EasyLink pass supported our transportation needs for 3 days without reloading. We simply swiped the pass at each station gate and were off to our destination.

The MRT provide fast and easy to use transportation to nearly every place in the city. MRT stations are plentiful and easy to find. Whether your destination is the Orchard district (shopping), Little India, Chinatown, financial district, Gardens by the Bay, National Orchid Garden or any other destination, there is an MRT option available to easily and affordably reach your destination.

There are plenty of maps which are easy to read. MRT cars are clean with ample seating and courtesy reminders for passengers (e.g. reminders to offer seats to those who need them etc..). Over head announcements are offered in English as well as native languages. Finally, the train speed is fast, with high frequency of trains - so you never wait long to board your train."

,,very nice and economic public transport,5.0,,"showing the 4 yrs old passport we got MRT card with no payment which is valid for bus and train across singapore without any cost (except sentosa monorail), which was so useful
MRT connectivity is good for within city, else taxis hailed on road are good.
got everyone MRT flashpay cards for sgd12 each, which had 7$ cash amount
the flashpay can be loaded at several machines on stations, which can be used to pay on most taxis (this incurs a fixed 30c charge compared to 10% with credit cards) - the only catch is that you cannot withdraw from the flashpay card until you surrender/invaidate it at ticket booth on station, which are not open 24 hours
also many eateries or shops will not accept this flashpay, most mall shops do.
most of the shopping areas - Bugis, chinatown and Little India are well connected by MRT.
be prepared for a lot of walking on some stations, as it gets confusing which exit to take to go out or to change to another line, but if you are without luggage, its straightforward as signs are self-sufficient"
,,MRT is amazing,5.0,,"Who'd have thought you could write a review about public transport and be so positive, living close to London we are used to hot, cramped, smelly and often late underground journeys, the MRT is the complete opposite, wonderfully clean, easy to navigate around and very rarely crowded. Get yourself one of the cards the pre-load it with SD$ then just tap in and out. Very cheap and very safe.
make sure you try the you visit the city."
,,Clean and Safe,5.0,,"Reliable, affordable and easy to use. Clean, safe and Air Conditioned. Would highly recommend giving it a try."

,,"Quick, clean and cheap",5.0,,Use the MRT to get to different parts of the city. Get card from any station. On 10 day visit I used MRT everyday to get to tourist attractions and only paid £6 in charges. Trains are clean. Not allowed to eat or drink on train.

,,Easy to use public transportation.,5.0,,"The MRT In Singapore will get you pretty much anywhere you need to go. It is clean, efficient, inexpensive and simple to figure out. You can buy a tourist pass for unlimited use for 1-3 days at most stations. I wouldn't travel around Singapore any other way!"

,,Very effecient,5.0,,"Very efficient and connects you to major buildings. Fully air conditioned. Ticket machines works all the time. For a free and easy two day visit, an EZ card is not necessary. SingTel tourist sim good for a week is only 15 sgd which can be purchased at the airport."
,,we went to use MRT,2.0,,We went to use MRT but we could not find any one to help us it wasn't until we where about to leave that we found out about a visitor transport card
,,Excellent network,5.0,,"Every station has multiple entrances and exit, so you need to be careful about that as exiting from a wrong entrance will make you walk extra. Some of these have car park as well as taxi and bus bay, so very convenient. Inside metro should follow the colour coding for your destination. Malay, English, Tamil and Mandarin are used for announcements inside the metro. It's fully underground and sentosa island is fully mono rail. The vending machine gives ticket and there is no person issuing ticket. The machine unfortunately takes only upto 5 dollars, so you need to carry change. You can choose no of passengers and return ticket too. For access inside the bay you need to swipe the card and turnstile shows the balance too. One in and one out is allowed for one way, if it is a return ticket you can use it one more time in the same stations. If you go to another station and swipe the turnstile won't work. It's not crowded and services are there 12 in the night and starts again at 5 in the morning."
,,Way to travel,5.0,,"Easy to use. Clean and comfortable, air conditioned. Can easily access most of the city. Recommend getting an EZ link card."
,,Extremely Efficient,5.0,,The MRT runs like clockwork and is a joy to travel on. I wish that the Australian trains would run as well.
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"Quick, on time, cheap and super convenient. There are subways and stations everywhere. Trains are always packed but the journeys are so short it doesn't matter."
,,Safe and reliable,5.0,,"The SMRT is safe, easy to use and reliable, which is all we want as tourists. By the end of our trip we were using this rather than Uber or taxis."
,,Prompt clean transport,5.0,,"We used the buses quite a lot from near our hotel. They ran regular, were very clean, and most drivers were very helpful. You do need the correct fare as no change is given. We caught the 125 from outside our hotel and it took us all the way to the main centre on Sentosa. We stayed for the Wings of Time Show and when we came out the bus was waiting just up the steps from the show. Could not ask for better public transport. They stop near the MTRs too which is just as easy to use."
,,Travelling to work,3.0,,"SMRT is trying their best to upgrade their trains but they do still stalled and stopped at certain stations and making me late for work.

So do leave early for your appointment or meeting as you may never know when you will be delayed.

However when the train is running smoothly, you will be always be on time. So hope this will be soon enough as the trains are getting more crowded each day."
,,Fast and save,5.0,,"The SMRT is our choice going around in Singapore. It's very fast, affordable even in peak-time. If you miss one the next train will follow soon. You're always save."
,,Mind the gap....,4.0,,"Have been to Singapore quite a number of times and become quite accustomed to using the MRT.

A terrific service and provides great and convenient access throughout Singapore, with the interchange system working very efficiently once you become accustomed to it.

But a tip for wheelchair travelers. The gap between the train carriages and platform does vary in width. This can be minimized by ensuring that as often as practicable you board at the wheelchair nominated door to board the train.

On a couple of occasions I didn't and paid the price when my front wheels slid into the gap between train and platform, a cause for some mild panic amongst commuters, but always someone handy and willing to lend a quick hand to rectify the situation.

The ticketing system is relatively easy to use and daily and/or tourist passes are recommended for economy. The system itself seems to have expanded by an additional branch line each trip we have made and work to continue this is ongoing.

Staff and locals are both keen to assist tourists getting about."
,,Best subway system ever!,5.0,,"Clean, prompt, comfortable--truly one of the best rapid transit systems in the world. The signage is excellent and clear. Plus, they have tourist passes! Never had to wait long for a train! Touring Singapore was a breeze using MRT."
,,Constant breakdowns and delays!,1.0,,"Avoid peak hours as it is packed and imagine having to wait in between stations when there is a signal fault in a very crowded cabin. Before you travel on the subway, make sure you have downloaded apps that offer updates of breakdowns."
,,Very efficient and clean,5.0,,This is one of the best in the world. Very efficient and trains come quickly. People always willing to stand for families with children.
,,Great place to visit,5.0,,Lots to go and see. We loved the Botanical Gardens especially at night. The train system is fantastic and very clean.
,,Singapore mass rapid transit...,5.0,,Singapore mass rapid transit is the name of the metro service which is spread all over the city. New and new line sare getting added into the circuit which makes it easy for the travellers to have easily access all the places ag affordable rates. We can take smart cards from the airport and recharge it and can access metro and bus services across the city. Different mobile apps are available which makes it easy for the travellers to take the metro. Metro are timed so frequently and lots of people are using it so that at the peak hours it's very difficult even to get into a metro. Altogether it's a good option for the travellers in singapore
,,"Ok, and better than most..",3.0,,"So, The Transit is mostly reliable..And pretty clean...They could have done a lot more with it..But hey, no complaints, at least they have one...I am spoiled by the shear art, timelines, cleanliness, and efficiency of Dubai public transit... Singapore is an amazing city-country, and with it going for so many Innovations, like Chingi Airport...Which is my fave in the world, I go there just to enjoy..The City transit works good enough, reaches everywhere you need to be..I will add the busses are pretty awesome, and the Bus drivers and Taxis as well are just AWESOME...Sorry, In Singapore, I prefer the Bus and a REAL TAXI."
,,Soooo clean and tidy,4.0,,"All the stations in Singapore are so clean and immaculate. Even the system of getting on and off a train is soo orderly. The staff are always soo helpfull.
The only problem is getting off the station onto the roads. There is no traffic light so have to use the underpass to cross roads which can take upto a good hour as it is soo confusing. They really need to add traffic lights."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,I love navigating transit systems on holiday! This was an easy system to understand and navigate. They don't take credit cards at the kiosk so you need Singapore dollars.
,,Best Public Transport Ever. Period.,5.0,,"Singapore MRT system is one of the best public transports I have ever travelled on. It outweighs the London Underground and New York Subway. It is the cleanest place ever, partly through the strict ruling on drinks and food on the MRT which I think is a brilliant idea.

It is also a very safe and affordable form of transport to move around the city. One of my favourite little quips about the MRT is the ""Thoughtful Family"" who are animated characters to remind you to put your bags down and offer seats to older people.

,,Great,5.0,,Really clean and fast. Didn't wait too long for a train at any time. Cheap tickets. For very busy. Efficient

,,Quick and easy way to get around,4.0,,Easy to use. Well signposted and having been familiar with the Hong Kong MTR it was easy to navigate. Also very reasonable price wise. Very clean too
,,"Easy to navigate, clean and reliable",5.0,,"We find the MRT so easy and convenient to use. We buy the standard ticket and recharge it (you can recharge and use the card for 6 individual trips before needing to buy a new card). The trains run regularly. We've never waited more than two minutes. They are clean. You cannot purchase the standard ticket from the ticket office. You have to use the vending machine that only accepts coins, a note under $5 in value or a range of credit cards. The ticket office will exchange a note for coins though. We found it easiest to search the alphabetical destination station list on the kiosk."
,,Esay Transportation,4.0,,"In Singapore, Taxi are expensive to go anywhere! MRT is very comfortable transportation in Singapore. It's Cheap. If you take MRT for long distance, you'll cost abt 3$ for Standard Ticket."
,,Always nice and helpful to use MRT in Singapore,4.0,,"We need to change expired card with a new one for $3, then we get new card available until 2025. Easy map to follow, and station that can be reach even when it is raining."
,,MRT ticket type,5.0,,"The mrt is cheap to use so buying a tourist pass may not be cheapest.
I paid $12 yesterday to get $7 travel. That gave me 4 trips and there's plenty left to get to airport today. And it's rechargeable.

Equivalent tourist pass is 2 day at $26 with $10 refundable."
,,"Super cepat, super nyaman, super canggih!",5.0,,"This public transportation is one of the reason why i love singapore! I do fall in love with MRT since the first time i used this public transportation. Kemana mana cepet gak kena macet, super comfy. Love so much!"
,,Best subway I've ever used,5.0,,Clean. Fast. Inexpensive. Easy to use. Used subways in almost every developed country on the planet and this one is the best I have seen.
,,"Cheap, quick and clean",5.0,,If you are going to use this service more than half a dozen times it is cheaper to buy a card. We got the $12 deal that is $5 for the card and $7 for credit. Keep in mind that you can only top up a minimum of $10 at a time and will stop working if you reach under $3 credit. Credit can be used at some shops including the pharmacy at the airport (no minimum).
,,World class transport,5.0,,"Clean modern trains & stations. I bought the 3 day (S$20 + S$10 refundable deposit) Tourist pass and can confirm that it starts on the first day of just and not the day of purchase date as other have. I also extended the Tourist pass for a further 2 day. Ticket office to return card and get back S$10 deposit is straight forward and is located as you arrive at Changi airport MRT station.
Signage is mainly British."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"Use the MRT. It is very easy and you can get to all attractions with ease. Cheap as well. Use the maps and know where you want to go first. Approach the ticket booth, type in via either the map ( touch the station you want to go to) or via the station you want to go to. Machines only take $5 and under in cash, so make sure you have plenty of small change or you can use a debit card. Super fast, easy to use and follow maps, clean, air conditioned. Just follow the locals or ask at counters if you need directions. If I could do it!! You will have no problem."
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,The MRT is cheap and easy to use. Just be aware that single tickets are cheap (about SGD2 per ride) so you may not use enough to justify the SGD10 day pass. You can buy a reloadable single ticket for 10c and then add up to 5 more trips (for a small discount). Only buy the day pass if you will make a lot of trips or travel a long way!
,,Stopover,5.0,,"Did a few trips on mrt, mainly Chinatown and little India. A guide indicated mrt not that reliable but we found no problems , on time and not too busy when off peak. Easy to work out tickets and which lines to catch"
,,Very organized,5.0,,Very organized and high tech system. Stations are extremely clean. Trains are on time. User friendly with too many staff available to help you.
,,Easy to get around for those not used to public transportation,4.0,,"Very easy to follow signs in all stations. Quick and easy purchase of 6 trip card which is ideal for a short stay - easy to add one trip at a time if you don't want to commit to adding a lot of value to the MRT reusable card.

The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because some station signs were not clear to those unfamiliar with the MRT system. Most of our experience was so intuitive but certain stations created confusion. Fortunately, we asked for help when the signs were confusing. :)

Great way to get around though and will be my go-to when I return to Singapore."
,,Great metro,5.0,,They have customer support personnel who speak English available to assist with every step of the process.
,,Very safe!! Get the tourist two or three day pass,5.0,,its super convenient and remember to give the card back to get your 10 dollars backs that is used as a hold.

,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,As a tourist go to the nearest Singapore train stain office and buy a tourist pass for the amount of days you want to use the system (buses and train) and get a multi use ticket - best value. The cost includes a $10 deposit which you can get back at the end of your stay or at the airport. Definitely the best way to see Singapore. If you have time get a train ride to the end of the line and go back to the city by bus - great way to see the local sites.
,,Good Service,4.0,,It was really economical to travel in Metro Service rather than taking a cabs which will cost you some huge bills
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Transport system is excellent. Easy to use and very affordable. The best way to travel around the city.

,,Always on time,5.0,,The SMRT works perfectly and helps you to commute a lot! Please read the map for the exact need. The signage also really helpful.
,,Efficient but a pain to pay,4.0,,"Very clean and efficient service. Trains arrived very frequently. Inside the train, it is very spacious. Would definitely recommend people to use this form of transport to move abouts in singapore.

The only drawback is : form of payment. Even top up, we can only pay cash. If you need a receipt, the machine cannot issue one for you. You need to go to customer service for a handwritten receipt."

Trains run really frequently so no time wasted waiting for trains. Easy to get on and off at relevant stations. Modern cleanand will take you to all the main attractions. If you are staying for longer than 6 days would probably be worth purchasing a tourist pass which covers all train and bus travel for various amounts of days.
,,"Best, cheapest, fastest & safest way to travel",5.0,,"The SMRT is the way a metro system should be done.

The driverless network is incredibly well connected, clean, safe and importantly for tourists - well signed, making it super easy to navigate.

We bought an EZ card as we were here for 6 days, and topped it up as needed. The best bit is that you can return it at the end of your stay and get back any unused credit you may still have on the card.

Beat the heat and traffic and enjoy a safe, clean and comfortable way of exploring Singapore!"
,,excellent public transport service,5.0,,"There are day, 2day and 3day tourist passes, but if you're going to be more days, the smrt card it would be your best friend, because of the difference os the smrt card ride against the ticket cost ride. 12SGD, 5 of them is the card price the rest it's money to spend. In 6 rides prices, you'll recover the money spent of the card value."
,,Amazing trains,5.0,,"Buy a smart ticket at 7 / 11. Trains a clean, frequent, we never waited more than 4 minutes. They will take you most places you need to go as a tourist. We loved them. A big well done to the Singapore Gov."

It is really efficient too. During our 2nd visit in Mar 2016, we had a toddler with us but it wasnt a problem. All of the stations we went to had properly woring lifts so bringing a stroller was a non-issue."

,,"Very easy, good value",4.0,,"It is very easy to use. $1.50 or so for a trip, depending on where you are going. $2.50 from the airport to Orchard Road with one change. Definitely my choice for transit in Singapore."
,,The Best Way to Get Around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT Lines are the way to travel around Singapore. The system covers much of the island and for those parts not, there is bus connection; it truly gets you around. The service is cost effective, as you can buy travel cards for tourists that let you get on and off the trains and buses as frequently as you want.

However, I think it is important to emphasize the feeling of safety. The stations have detailed maps of the lines, as well as the areas in which you get off in, in addition to information desks. The lines are underneath the city and tend to merged into other buildings, so it can be a bit confusing actually locating the station."
,,best way to do Singapore,5.0,,"Affordable, clean and quick way of transport. easy to upload your pass. Good wayfinding in the sations"

,,Most effective transport system in the world.,5.0,,"I am amazed how effective and efficient SMRT platform is. It's very easy to go around Singapore using public transportation because of its layout that will very much cover almost all areas around Singapore. Every tourist spot/attraction has a nearby SMRT station. There are a lot of cctv in every station so you'll feel safe to travel even in nigh time. Its is also easy to travel with strollers/wheelchairs using SMRT.

PS: Instead of availing the ""tourist pass"", just go for the regular top-up of your EZ link cards. It's cheaper that way, you'll just consume per your usage. :)"

,,"Good, clean, cheap and efficient",4.0,,"We travellelled from Sentosa Island to our hotel in Bugis. We had to make one change. The service was first class. A lady stood next to the ticket machine and helped us to buy our tickets. The signage was clear, and the trains were busy, but not overcrowded. The price was under 4 dollars for two people, which compared with around 20 dollars for the taxi. An excellent, value for money system."

,,Cheap and reliable transport,4.0,,"We used the MRT extensively on a recent trip to Singapore and it can't be beaten for cost and convenience. Stations and trains were always clean and tidy. Staff were happy to help. If you stood looking at a map for any more than 30 seconds someone would come up and offer advice.
The only downside, a small one, was some stations were that big and complex you had to have your wits about you getting in and out from ground level. All good signage but important to be aware.
Google maps invaluable for public transport, put in your destination and it will calculate which bus/train to use, connections and times."
,,"Fast, well connected and comfortable",5.0,,SMRT is a life line for students and people who cant travel by taxi everyday. This is fast and very well connected to all parts of the city.
,,One of the best transportation in the world,5.0,,"As a Singaporean im proud to say Singapore has tge best mode of transportation which makes travelling easier around the tiny island.
The Mass Rapid Transit was launched in the late 80s and now covers every end part of Singapore and doorsteps to prominent places of interest.
There are lines namely the East-West (GREEN), North-South (RED), Circle Line (YELLOW), North East (PURPLE) and the latest is the Downtown lines (BLUE). You can also purchase a singke trip tickets at the ticketing machines. Its cheap to travel by getting a 1, 2 or 3 day cards which are useable for trains n buses.
There are many signages which shows u the directions and EXITS.
Each station has control centre for any enquiries too with friendly staff.
If you in the heartlands where many Singaporeans live, they have Light Transit Trains.
Very clean and neat. Remember No Eating No Drinking No Smoking in trains and station areas.
Its good to use public transport like the MRTs to move around my beautiful city SINGAPORE. Cheers"
,,"""Super"" Mass Rapid Transit!",5.0,,"Overall, very easy to follow. Although, exiting underground areas can be a bit confusing and tricky at times. Despite this, the system is fast, efficient and offers some relief from the unrelenting humidity. Tourist pass was great value for money if you need to use the system a lot. Single trip ticket was as cheap as chips and easy to purchase too. We also received a refund on each Tourist Pass card when we returned it after it expired. Hats off to this system!"
,,Still The Best Way To Get Around Singapore,4.0,,"The MRT system has come a long way since I first arrived in Singapore in 1991. In those days it consisted of only two lines: the north-south ('red line') and the east-west ('green line'). Now there are various lines covering large parts of Singapore, with a further line (the Thomson line) currently under construction.

All of this means that getting around Singapore these days is a breeze. Due to its popularity, though, the trains can get very crowded, especially during rush hour peak periods and when travelling to or from popular destinations, such as Orchard Road, for instance. Users have also been plagued by a spate of breakdowns on the 'old', original two lines, which are now starting to show their age after a number of years in service.

This notwithstanding, the MRT is definitely the smart choice for visitors who wish to visit their selected destinations in Singapore. If you are staying for more than a day or so, it is wiser to buy an Easylink card, which is a stored-value card, rather than buy a one-time use ticket each time you travel. This will save you time whilst travelling, as with the card you just need to tap in and tap out when you arrive at and leave your station. The stored value on the card can also be topped-up, when it starts to run low.

The trains and stations are always spotlessly clean and so provide a pleasant environment in which to travel."
,,Efficient and cheap,4.0,,"Although taxi travel is cheap in Singapore, the MRT is well worth looking into. Very clean, well signposted."
,,on time every time.,5.0,,"safe, cheap, reliable and clean transport. Singapore has got this right. This is a safe and economical way to travel anywhere in Singapore."
,,As expected,5.0,,"The MRT is everything you expect of transportation in modern world Asia, clean, efficient, spacious and full access to internet and phone connection. Even on the cities busiest weekend the trains weren't busy, the platforms weren't over crowded and the trains ran frequently. Saying all of this though, the longer you are in the city the more you realise you can walk to most places and as a tourist I would suggest you do, you see more that way."
,,Great turist transport pass unlimited or S$2 trip,5.0,,"So tourist pass is 1 day $S10 two day S$18 or three day S$20 and a $10 deposit on card refundable
So use this pass see everything its clean safe and reliable the transport system makes anything in western world look sad , the people are very polite escalators stand on the left stand on the right and your walking fast past others .
its very prompt and lot trains but dont take long journey at 11:30 pm it stops at 12pm the pass is great on Bus as well .

,,Helpfully to transfer on time but long way to walk,4.0,,"From the hotel that we stay last time, to the nearest MRT station, we have to walk at least 20 mins. That's why i call it is really long way to walk. But after reach and use this MRT i can say, it was really helpfull.
For the direction it was easily to understand.
Never decide to exit from the station if u're not yet so sure about the destination u will visit. Because it was more enjoyable to walk inside the tunnel than to walk directly and get the sun rays.
Maps are easily to understand. One condition that make uneasy, when trying to top up the ezlink, that must be minimum 10 sing dollar."
,,Singapore's underground system,5.0,,"Very easy to use and ideal for getting around the city, especially at night. Fares are cheap, ticket machines easy to use and all in English so nothing to worry about here!"
,,Best subway ever,5.0,,"I've travelled the world but this MRT system is so easy to use, spotlessly clean and efficient I wish all cities could take note!"

In the train, guideline about all destinations is very clear and modern. It is clean as well.
From 8 to 9am and 5pm, it's quite crowded"
,,VERY ORGANISED AND VERY CLEAN BUT HAVE SMALL NOTES HANDY,5.0,,The best way to get around Singapore. Get a Standard Ticket and top it up for each trip you take. However even though the ticket machines might have a credit card facility don't be surprised if it doesn't work. So keep small notes and dollar coins handy to use in the machines.
,,Reliable clean public transport,4.0,,"Found the train system to be reliable and clean. It is divided into a small number of lines that intersect. For the tourist it covers all the main tourist attractions though you may have to change lines. For example we stayed near Little India which was 3 different trains, the airport line, the east west line and the downtown line. Was easy to navigate and cheap to ride. $2.80 SGD from the airport to Little India."
,,Great Transport System,5.0,,Best way to get around Singapore. We went with our small Grandchildren with prays. Easy system to use well sign posted the trains are very clean AND people are polite and helpful. Also very cheap.
,,"Cheap, clean, reliable and simply the best way to get around",5.0,,"Spent 6 days in Singapore. Bought the SMRT card on day one for S$5 (not refundable), with S$7 loaded. I added S$10 and then did all my travelling for the 6 days and still had S$6 left. Means I travelled around the city at will for 6 days for less than 6 pounds Sterling or US$ 8. The cheapest and best value thing in the country"
,,MRT amazing experience in Singapore,5.0,,"compared to Hong Kong MRT is more lively, people talk and engage with each other. The train routes are easy to follow. I was able to go around in the first day oof arrival and whenever I got lost, there were friendly staff to lend me a hand. I truly enjoyed the beautiful paintings and murals on the MRT wall. very poignant and inspiring artwork !"
,,Terrible,1.0,,"Constant breakdowns, frequent overcrowding. I have to take this mode of transport to work every morning, there are many occasions when I can't board, 3 trains in a row (usually around 7.30am). Was told to not be so picky about location when searching a job, which I heeded. Now, my HR thinks of me as a tardy person despite my efforts. It's not just going to work, even coming back home is a pain. Missing 2-3 trains in a row is commonplace around 6.45om , especially when you're transferring back to the NS line (red line) towards Jurong East. Would recommend you to take bus instead if not for the longer travelling time."
,,Love the Transport in Singapore,5.0,,"As I live in Melbourne Australia, All I can say, is the MRT is sensational compared to transport at Home.

Oh, a tip, if your a tourist, coming to the City from the Airport in the evening, just buy a one way ticket for $2.40. We bought the three day Tourist pass which starts not he day you buy it. So was not worth it for the first day. (not a major issue, it was more convenient to buy the free day tourist pass immediately at the airport, but if on a budget, something to consider,)"
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"This is one of the best underground services I have ever used. Stations are all fully equipped with maps which are super easy to read and understand. There are people on hand who don't hesitate to ask if they can help if you look at all unsure!

Was surprised these were driverless trains but they are super smooth and have exact timings. There is a train every 5 minutes from nearly every station.

What really impressed me was how spotlessly clean the stations and the trains are. Puts British Transport to shame!"
,,A gem of a transit system,5.0,,Down load their app and travelling the island is a breeze. In the app just give your location and place you want to go and app will give you which train station to go where to change and which bus to hop on.if train run late buses become free. Terrific
,,Efficient as usual,5.0,,"Not much to add, the cheapest, quickest way to get from 'A to B'. Buy a card and the fares are half the cost of a single ticket."
,,So Ez with your Ez link card,5.0,,"Clean, easy and well signposted. Had difficulty getting card from 7eleven so bought from MRT . Such an easy and cheap way to get a family of 4 around to all the sites."
,,Perfect was to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The easiest way to get around Singapore. The MRT stations are clean and well signed. It is easy to transfer to different lines to get to your destination. MRT trains arrive at the station at 3-5 min intervals. Tourists can easily purchase a 1,2 or 3 day pass. The 3 day pass cost approx S$30 and of that S$10 is refundable when you return the pass to the ticket office. The MRT covers most of the Island with another line coming on line in Oct 2017 and another is being constructed due to open in 2021."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,Super efficient and really cheap. Trains are every few minutes on most lines and its an easy system to navigate.
,,"Easy, clean, affordable!",5.0,,"Easy to get around on this clean and rapid subway system. Trains to downtown run every few minutes, and everything is very clean and organized. Get a tourist pass -- one, two, or three days, with a refundable $10 deposit. You can get one at down at ticket office just by MRT entrance in terminal two at Changi. Great carefree way to explore the city!"
,,GREAT TRANSPORT SYSTEM,4.0,,"Cheap & easy to use. I will always stay in a hotel near a MRT if I can from now on, as it was so easy, quick & frequent."
,,Amazing system,5.0,,"Coming from Sydney its not hard to beat its transport system but Singapore is incredible. On time, clean, easy to understand (even for a tourist), completely wheelchair accessible. Really really good! I know the locals think it has issues (and maybe it does) but they haven't been to Sydney..great you can buy a standard ticket and top it up for a short 3 day trip. Cannot complain about the staff service either!"
,,World's Best,5.0,,"Facilities are clean and modern. We felt safe. We found the staff to be very helpful. Overhead moniters work and they are correct. Kiosks are user friendly. I cannot say enough about how pleasant the environment is. If you shy away from the tube or subway in other cities, give Singapore's system a try."
,,"Clean, tidy, fast and often",5.0,,The best way to get round the town. Puts many metros to shame with just how tidy and cheap it is. Purchase an EZ link card as this is the easiest way to pay for fares on SMRT and buses
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Grab a map, sort out your day & use the trains. We found it so easy to get around & to where we needed to be very quickly. You will probably have to swap lines but here re trains every 2-3 mins"
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"We stayed near the Harbour front and used the NE line, the ticket machine was always busy, so best get a tourist pass. Once you have worked out how to get your ticket the rest & getting around is very simple. Cheap, fast, clean travel. Download the MRT app, saves carring a map around, again very easy to use."
,,Very easy to use and get around,5.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for a week, and used the MRT every day to get around. Unbelievably good value, always on time, air conditioned, and very clean.

,,Easy peasy,5.0,,"Easy, efficient, clean, toilets (imagine that on the Underground), cheap, fast, friendly staff (imagine that on the Underground). Once again these Asian countries put us to shame."
,,Fast-Efficient-Clean,5.0,,"We are not used to public transport let alone something like the Singapore MRT.
There seems to be stations everywhere.It's easy to work out and cheap to use.We have never been on a train that went this fast or was kept as clean as the ones we saw in Singapore.
Highly recommend that visitors give it a go."
,,Great way to get around the city,4.0,,"Very efficient and affordable way to get around the city, trains run frequently but may be crowded depending on the time of day and location - as is the same in other big cities. You can buy either single/return tickets, tourist passes or ezlink cards, which you can top up as necessary. At the end of your visit to Singapore you can get the balance of your card refunded at the airport, but you won't be able to use the same card if you make another visit at a later time."
,,Great underground system,5.0,,"We got a three day tourist pass which gives you unlimited use of the MRT. You can get anywhere in the city very easily thanks to regular trains, easy to understand maps and easy to follow signs!!"

,,Joy ride in MRT Singapore,4.0,,"M a citizen & resident of Singapore in Jelebu/ Bukit Panjang District. I Mostly drive to places occasionally take MRT (Mass Rapid Transit ) & LRT ( Light Rail Transit ). MRT carries pplp to & from big major station to another ( district to district) also / then later connected to LRT ( travel short distance) which carries pplp to their Neighbourhood. Both use card with value of almost $2 - $3 each travel or per trip ( going is 1 trip, returning is 1 trip) & can be topup its value at the staff counter or ticket machine. MRT & LRT are easily connected to adjacent bus main station called Bus interchange & Mall complex. MRT & LRT are best way to travel or best mean of transport to see real Singapore city & its people at street level, meeting pplp in the streets, visit Heartland Mall or district Shopping Mall. Within Most district has all amenities such as mall that houses like Postal Service, Bowling place, Movie theatre, library, foods courts/cafes, restaurants fast foods, indoor playground or park, education Centres and more shops . .. it is a new exciting way & educational way of sightseeing besides the traditional tourist usual visit to Singapore national places of interest & main attraction. If you decide to carry on board the MRT train a big bulky luggage or bag pls be ready & prepared to let the security pplp check open them. Singapore is very multi racial multi religious nation & very peaceful we live harmoniously. Take the MRT from 1 end ( station A) to the other end ( station Z) and venture around take pictures see how we live & interact with each other. Just keep in mind never eat, drink or smoke or carry stinking fruit durian upon entering the station area or into the train- the fine between $500 -$1000 ( in other public transport too like taxi, bus). Meanwhile Do not litter in Singapore or else pay fines. keep your rubbish & discard if find any bin. Generally just follow the rules & regulations while using or travel by MRT u will be ok. Anyway my Favourite MRT station stop point are Causeway Point , Bugis, Orchard, Little India, Paya Lebar , Chinatown etc."
,,Great public transport,5.0,,Very easy to use and the 3 day tourist pass was well worth the money. If you are a visitor don't buy a standard ticket from the machines go to a tourist pass office and pay the little bit extra upfront. You'll find yourself using the MRT for most of your travel around Singapore
,,So efficient,5.0,,Feels weird to review a transport system but worth a trip just to experience clean and efficient public transport.
,,Reliable transportation,5.0,,"You can reach almost everywhere with MRT to explore Singapore. Get the map at Changi and you can go to all tourist destination without get lost. It is easy and efficient.

No food n drink inside. Some stations are integrated with malls. Some stations are simple one. If that is connecting station usually be busy. Walking long enough to one train to another connecting train station. Make sure we use comfortable shoes.

Try to go to Dhoby Ghaut to get the biggest n busy environment of MRT. Sometimes stations has their unique interior reflecting the surrounding."
,,Easy and efficient,4.0,,Buses and trains are the a great way to get around singapore. They are pretty reliable during the off peak hours which is when I use them the most to run errands and to get to classes or places I need to be. Totally save some me the hassle of having to find parking and light on the pocket too as I don't have to incur petrol or parking charges! Added bonus -- walking clocks up steps!
,,Use this for transport! So easy,5.0,,Easy to get a visitor's pass at reasonable price from mrt station. From there you have unlimited use of train and the mrt busses. I navigated through Singapore this way. Easiest way to travel by far and it can get you all over the island. Train is prompt and clean.
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,"Don't be afraid of the public transport.

It is very clean, safe and reliable.

Trains run every 5-8 minutes at the platforms.

It is quite cheap to use. From the airport to the CBD area it costs about $3 instead of the $30+ in a cab and takes the same amount of time."
,,"CHEAP,RELIABLE AND EASY TO USE.",5.0,,A great way to get around the city. You can purchase tourists passes at the airport. Maps of the network are provided or you can print off website.
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"Its very clean and cheap. Ticket machines are intuitive. Best that you get the EZ card and not the tourist daily pass. Circle line can be confusing, trains do not end at the same station every time so pay attention to the boards and to the map of where younwant to go. Allow for decent ammount of travel time, some stations are big and although signed can get confusing on the way out especially if you end up in a mall like Plaza Singapura."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is the best way to get around the city. Even though cabs/Uber are readily available, unless you're short on time, the MRT is the absolute best way to travel within Singapore."
,,Very simple and convenient,5.0,,Easy to figure out and very inexpensive. Like 1 dollar across the city. All staff were very helpful.
,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,Great air conditioned transport system. If you are staying for a few days or more make sure you buy the top up card from any station ticket office for $12.

,,Getting out and about,4.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is very efficient, clean and inexpensive. Visitors can also get a 1-day, 2-day or 3-day pass with unlimited use. The carriages are clean, spacious and not too crowded. Definitely it's a good way to go out and about in Singapore."
,,Speedy Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is the easiest and fastest way to get around in Singapore. It's cheap too! The Singapore MRT is very impressive and leaves the tubes in London and the Paris Metro for dead! We bought a $12 EZ-Link travel card with $7 stored value. Just top it up as needed. With an EZ-Link card you can use the MRT, LRT and buses to easily get around Singapore."
,,MRT in Singapore,5.0,,"You can reach all over Singapore just using this MRT. I suggest you to buy an advanced multiple ticket, its easier, you don't have to buy a ticket everytime you want to use MRT. A little bit confusing at the beginning for a first time user, but it's easy if you already master it. Don't forget to ask for a map in the ticketing office."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Got a 3 day Pass while i was in Singapore and very much worth very penny what i paid for it.

Singapore is so well connected with its MRT lines which makes getting around super easy. Not to mention its no food and drinks policy on the MRT makes it one of the cleanest trains i have traveled on."
,,But a metro card and load money on it rather than getting single use tickets.,5.0,,"The fare on a metro card is half that of a single use ticket and there is no standing in line every time. The card us $12 and that includes a card and $7 worth of usable money. We added $10 to it and used $17 worth of rides in 4 days. If there is value left, the clerks will issue a refund with offices open till midnight in most of the stops. Clean, fast, safe, well organized. Saves a ton of money over a taxi."
,,Fast efficient,5.0,,Easy to use. Fast and efficient And very clean Makes getting around the city cheap and easy Finding the entrances can be tricky
,,"Convenient, clean and very efficient",5.0,,"SMRT system takes you most of the places, once you get a gang of it, it's simple and very cheap. I enjoyed riding MRT."
,,Efficient reasonably priced and like the rest of Singapore strangely quiet,5.0,,This is a great way to get around in Singapore. Everything works well. It is clean and easy to navigate your way around. Everyone behaves themselves very well and it is cheap. What's not to like. As with everywhere else in Singapore it is also a surprisingly quiet and calm experience. It's as though the sound has been turned down compared to everywhere else
,,Clean and Orderly,4.0,,"This visit marked the first time I'd used the Singapore metro, and I found it very easy to use. Tickets within the central zone at peak are around $S1.70 and as a tourist you can get a pass valid for a day for the entire system for $S10 (but you need to buy this at specific station offices after 9 am). You will naturally follow the guidelines and your fellow travelers in boarding and going on the escalators in an orderly fashion--it's a marvelous demonstration of how this particular society functions. A great way to get around town (and out of the rain, though very busy during rush hour)."
,,"Safe, convenient, well priced",5.0,,"Safe and efficient what more can you ask for? Oh yeah - clean, good value, convenient. Female travelling alone? Not a problem!"
,,A blueprint for the worlds mass transit systems,5.0,,"Without a doubt the best way to see 90% of Singapore and all of its attractions. Tip. Purchase a 3 day visitor pass for $30 and just renew it if you're staying longer. You can purchase them from any of the main MRT stations and staff are very helpful. Don't be wary about trying this system it is so easy and loads of instructions on stations and inside the trains a light on the map shows you where you are with announcements at every station. If you are elderly or infirm people offer you their seats, even the youngsters."
,,Most useful,5.0,,This is the most useful form of transportation in Singapore. Very large coverage and still maintain well. The feeder bus system compliments it very well. But please get the travel card as it saves you a lot of time and it really helps you to do a lot of running around.
,,Fast and clean,5.0,,"Interesting to take the Tourist Pass, but be careful and DO NOT BUY the Singapore Tourist Pass Plus, sold by Changi Recommends, as the card is not reimbursed, and the price difference is theoretically compensated by a valueless excursion"
,,MRT is not as fast as MTR,3.0,,"I like Hong Kong MTR, London Underground and Seoul Metro because I love to get to my destination as fast as possible and hate traffic jam. However, SMRT is not that fast. To me its speed is more like Paris Metro. For the same destination, it takes me 30 min in good traffic costs me 55 minutes by SMRT, not including the walking time to and from the MRT station."
,,Best and Cheapest Way Around...,5.0,,"Have used the MRT on numerous occasions on my trips here. The ticketing system is fairly intuitive, instructions are clear and in English/ other main languages of Singapore.

Maps are located very liberally and even first timers will be able to navigate around the interchanges fairly easily. Signage are clear and are also in English.

Train condition is very acceptable and clean (visitors please remember food/drinks are not allowed to be consumed on board, as with most countries). Family friendly at most, if not all stations, with elevator access for strollers and wheelchairs.

By far, most cost efficient way to the airport too although you need to budget 45-60 travel time if you're coming from the City."
,,Quick and cheap,5.0,,"We took the MRT around Singapore and found that it was quick and cheap. The directions to get any where were easy.
The only downside is the sheer size of some of the stations and not knowing where you will be when you exit to street level."
,,Great,5.0,,"Very clean, efficient, easy to use and find your way around. Prices are very low. We bought a top up card so we didn't have to queue for tickets. Makes it so easy."
,,Dropped my EZlinkmdebit card on the downtown line train and it was found by staff!,5.0,,Very honest and helpful staff. I am impressed that I could still retrieve my ezlink debit card at the last station of downtown line as staff actually found and returned it promptly to the station control.
,,Convenient and efficient,5.0,,This is one of the cheapest and most efficient ways to move around Singapore with helpful customer service and well signposted directions and maps. It links you to most of the local attractions
,,Fast and efficient travel,5.0,,Trains run every few minutes and are always on time. They are quick and cheap and when it is raining are definitely the best option as taxis are difficult to find (I waited for 40 minutes in a long que recentlyi).
,,Best Transport Method in Singapore,5.0,,"Having been in Singapore before we knew that the rail system was good. This time as our hotel had a station underneath we were able to access all lines easily. WE used the rail syatem to go almost everywhere as it has many lines and interchanging to another line was easy. The whole system is color coded, information is always being put in front of you in the form of voice and screens. My best advice is always know the last station on the line as you go to catch a train you are directed to the platform by advising the last station on the line Once on the platform there are ample sighs showing your station and all those beforre it."
,,Affordable and Easy transport in Singapore,5.0,,I guess my title has tell a lot. And I bet everyone who has visited Singapore agree that smrt is very convinient to go around Singapore
,,Awesome transport system.,5.0,,As a visitor travelling to Singapore the MRT is an easy to use and fast way of transport. We were amazed at the cleanliness and speed of transport from station to station. Prices are cheap also
,,Utterly convenient to travel,5.0,,"To be honest, the mrt is superb and I personally feel i can go anywhere with it in Singapore. Accessibility at its best."
,,Why doesn't Sydney Australia have this,5.0,,I'm very impressed and it is very clean and reliable. I am amazed to find the transit is all automatic no driver. easy to get around and fast too.
,,"Clean, Cheap and Efficient",5.0,,Couldn't fault the SMRT. Staff were very helpful in all stations. Trains are clean and run on time. Easy to get around places. Highly recommended.
,,Convenient transport,5.0,,This is a very convenient way of going around the city. It is very clean and aircon is functioning well. The trains are frequent and on time.
,,I am a regular traveller of SMRT and it's amazing,4.0,,SMRT is an excellent transportation system . Mostly you won't see any delays and trains are on time. Completely air conditioned. You have to be careful choosing your travel time as it's quite crowded during morning and evening peak hours and they provide app which gives info on train routes and to give You notifications in case of any issue with train delays. Overall very well maintained. During recent days there are delays in train timings due to the upgrading of the signalling system but I hope it's just a temporary problem which will be addressed soon.
,,Awesome transport with some work on the wifi,4.0,,"Being in singapore since I was born,it was a great way to travel to one place to an another,well there's some things I need to improve especially Wifi which they have the wireless SGX,it did not work when I travel to an interchange which they disconnect and they also disconnect when I travel the train which make me wish they have wifi in the trains,the interchange way need to be shorter,try to travel in non peak hours"
,,My preferred Mode of Travel,4.0,,"I use Singapore's public transportation system often. Trains and buses here are affordable and convenient, and cost a fraction of what taxis cost. The downside is that public transportation tends to be very busy during rush hour and there have been some breakdowns lately."
,,Clean and safe,5.0,,"We used the MRT multiple times during our stay. It is very easy to buy a ticket from the machine, then you use it like an Oyster card in London and just top it up as needed. The trains themselves are very clean and air conditioned which was a welcome break from the heat."
,,Efficient & Fast !!,5.0,,"Its fast, Reliable, on time & cheap on fare. I am regular user, But I advice to look for alternative options like bus or taxi on heavy raining day. Best place to hop in is right in front or in last, Over all 9.5/10."
,,Fast Clean Easy,4.0,,"Wow
Wish we had this at home...
Not a lot of substations but enough to get you around the main points of the city...
Stayed on Orchard got the MRT from there
City Hall did Raffles
Clarke Quay first boat and Clarke
Used Marina to stop by tye beautiful and luxurious Marina Bays...
China Town
Switched lines to do little India

Silly $10 refund per card that was too hard to do...

Well sign posted everywhere we went...

Brilliant"
,,Easy as!!!,5.0,,Compared to the Underground or the Metro this is by far the easiest cleanest most basic user friendly system I've ever used .. cheap too and stops at all the places you might want to go 😏
,,Quick and effective inexpensive Transport,3.0,,"We have been here almost a week now and using public transport has been amazing.
Quick and inexpensive. Easy to figure out and we have made our way around Singapore very easily with no confusion. We have purchased the tourist pass the only down fall is the passes are 3 days max and you can only purchase from certain stations."
,,Great timing,4.0,,It is a very easy way to travel around. The timing is great. Cleanliness has improved a lot. A bit crowded at peak hours.
,,Very good,4.0,,Singapore mass rapid transit is a very good service and very cheap. Singapore Taxi service is very expensive. I suggest for all type of traveler can use this service . This service is link with every where in Singapore you want to vist. This service is link with all the shopping mall and attractive places.
,,Easy To Use & Great Value for Money,5.0,,"Bought the 3 day Visitors Pass for $SG 20 each and used it a lot during our stay, especially to get out to the Changi Museum. We'll signposted; great trains; good coverage. Other cities could take note."
,,More area to improvement,3.0,,Singapore is small country MRT is the mode of transport(buses also) available which can lead to most area.
,,Fantastic transport,5.0,,"We recently holidayed in Singapore for our first time. We were told prior, that the MRT was an easy, cheap & fast way to get around, so decided to give it a go. We used the MRT daily, as it was just so easy. The routes are all colour coded and can get you to anywhere in Singapore. You can't really go wrong & if you did the staff within the stations are very helpful. Multi-trip tickets start at around $10SD. I would highly recommend using the MRT"
,,Easy to navigate but not sure if the EZ link card is a good deal,4.0,,"Read a bunch of reviews on the tourist card vs the EZ link card and decided that since we wouldn't be using it a lot as Uber is easy there, it would be a better value to get the Easy link. It's a $5 deposit and $7 for travel so it's $12 to get the card. The MRT is easy to navigate and so accessible to all sights and attractions in Singapore. Didn't really pay attention to how much each ride cost but we had to top up on the second day after only using it for 4 journey's because as soon as you go below $3 it won't let you enter the gates. Then when we were finished using the cards we went to get our refund but what they don't tell you is that the $5 is non refundable unlike the oyster card in London so you might as well leave a little on the card but ask for the rest of the balance so that the next time you find yourself in that city you just top up and keep going and don't lose $5."
,,Clean & Speedy,5.0,,"Our hotel was 200 metres from the station Clake Quay, easy to get a ticket from machine, trains are very regular, & being a senior they have seats for older people & the younger people give up there seats for us on a number times, no drinking or eating on trains."
,,"Clean and as the name would suggest,fast!",5.0,,A lot cleaner than the London Underground that I'm used to! Easy to use. We got a Singapore pass which allowed us on the busses and MRT for $30 for 3 days. We will get $10 back when we return the cards.
,,One of the best transport system I have seen,5.0,,"This was one of the best thing i experienced in SIN, all the key /landmarks are connected through the MRT ( ex- China town, Little India, Merlion, Senthosa), it was very easy & cost effective to travel through this and very convenient.specially if you have bigger group. compared to taxi its cheaper.easy to learn through the map & the officials are in each locations are very helpful."
,,Clean and convenient,4.0,,Had a ride on the SMRT from Esplanade to Somerset today. Had to change from The Central line at Dhoby Ghaut to North East line to Somerset. It was all smooth and very convenient. Haven't done this trip for a Long while but the ride and services seemed more seamless and clean. I can see SMRT signs more than previously (last travelled on MRT was 3 years ago)! Go SMRT!
,,MOST CONVENIENT AND SPEEDY WAY TO TRAVEL IN SINGAPORE,4.0,,"So well connected in Singapore If you take the SMRT you do not have to get caught up in traffic jams and innumerable signals and the trouble of waiting for cabs during peak hours. SMRT makes a world of difference in commuting in singapore. fast, clean and well connected, its the ideal way to travel when you are in singapore."
,,Efficient!,5.0,,Efficient is what you would use to describe SMRT. Probably one of the best in Asia it is cost effective and not as crowded as some other Asian cities.
,,Little bit overrated,3.0,,"I was having high expectations from SMRT

This is better than most of the countries but it is not very much impressive.

Weather is Hot and humid in Singapore but the bus stops are not air conditioned at all. In dubai they have air conditioned bus stops and all the walk ways on metro station. I personally didn't feel it very impressive since entrances to the train stations were sweaty and bus stops were hot. Moreover you cannot reach everywhere with this unlike the general impression. To go a lot of places better and quick way is to go by taxi instead of wasting lot of time on public transport.

I got this singapore tourist pass which cost like 10 dollars per day and a refundable deposits of 10 dollars. But I used it only two times in my three days because of nt being so comfortable.

I suggest you make a calculation of taxi fare to all the places you visit and then compare total with this daily pass cost, especially if you are two or more than two. I am sure visiting all notable sights for two persons will cost less than this pass.

Uber runs some promotions check them and use them. In my case, I signed up with new sim I had i purchased there and I got two rides for discount of 8 dollars each. Use these for airport transfers. Also there was a promo where they were giving discount of 3 on each ride. So it costs less than using public transport. However be careful while mentioning pick up location since drivers quickly go away and it will cost you cancellation fee."
,,Great Transport System,5.0,,We were staying at the Stamford Hotel for 10 days. The hotel is located above City Hall station making access around Singapore very easy. Trains were every 3-4 minutes and very clean. One slight gripe is the rush hour where trains were packed but I suppose no worse than any other major city.
,,Very convenient transport,5.0,,"Great connecting transportation, very fast and perfect for regular commute.. very clean and has reserved seats for disabled n old citizens, eating and drinking is not allowed in smrt"
,,"Cheap, clean and efficient travel in Singapore",5.0,,"This is a really good way to get around Singapore. You need to be prepared to walk a bit to and from stations, depending on where you want to go.
It is a lot cheaper than taxis and generally gets you close to most destinations Island wide."
,,Wow,5.0,,"Train system is a wow. Very easy to navigate, efficient, clean and cheap. Best mode of transpo to roam SG."
,,Best in world ...,5.0,,"This is the best MRT , underground i have ever used , clean is a understatement , spotless is the word, fast on time ..."
,,Convenient,5.0,,We used the MRT quite a bit over the long weekend we were in Singapore. Stops are clearly marked and within a close walk of most places. Very clean and comfortable. The staff at the gates was very helpful and willing to answer questions.
,,So easy,5.0,,"Easy, clean and cheap way to get around the city. Directions are clear. Not sure what else to say to get to the word limit"
,,Very easy to get around!,5.0,,"The MRT is so cheap and convenient so it is worth using it instead of getting taxis everywhere.

Only bad thing is that you have to pay a $5 non refundable deposit on the MRT card which may not be worth it as you can only use it in Singapore."
,,5 flights of stairs,1.0,,"Beware, clean and easy transit until you try to exit and the escalators aren't working - 5 flights of stairs later ........."
,,Aging MRT,3.0,,Be prepared for frequent stops and service interruptions especially during peak hours. carriages were often cram packed with passengers
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,The MRT is fabulous to get around if you are a tourist you can buy 1 to 3 day pass 1 day is $20 2 day $25 3 day $30 and you get back $10 when you hand back your card after it expires it's very good value and is so efficient
,,Loved this so much,5.0,,Loved the trains came every 5 mins. Loved they were clean. Loved no one crowded. Just loved them so much as it was easy to get around singapore this way.
,,Easy transport,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is so cheep my biggest fare was $1.7 and that was a long trip most are in the 70 cent mark . Trains run every few mins . But for this price don't expect a seat unless your older or invalid. I use the mrt all the time and fully recommend it . Download the MRT app and use it to work out your rout and which interchanges to use
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Easy to use and fun. They even have cartoon characters to tell you of better etiquettes when using the MRT, Stand up Stacy, Move in Martin, hush hush Hannah to name a few. I wish they had a service that worked till late ie 1-2 am"
,,Efficient and Systematic,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system is one of the best in the world in terms of efficiency and cleanliness, including distance per station.

A major part of the highly populated areas are accessible by one or two MRT stations and this makes it very convenient for locals, as well as tourists.

On regular hours, trains come by every 3-4 minutes, making waiting time almost a non-issue with commuters. Biggest draw for me is the price. Compared to other major subway systems like Tokyo, London and Hong Kong, subway rides are priced competitively.

MRT cards can be purchased from the train master located at each MRT station. Minimum price is 12SGD, including the card price and a minimum load. Top up services are available either manually thru the train master or thru vending machines.

It's always a pleasure to ride the SMRT, except during occasional train breakdowns when queues can become a hassle."
,,Clean punctual and great ... bit slower than HK MTR though,4.0,,always love all infra of singapore including MRT which is a hallmark of its great modern infrastructure. Great staff too. the only small thing i can think of (being from HK) is that it cud be a bit faster in its frequency and travel times. HK MTRmanages to be bit more efficient in that
,,"Clean, efficient, easy ticketing and it goes everywhere! in Singapore",5.0,,"Clean, efficient, easy ticketing and it goes everywhere! in Singapore. One of the best in the world."
,,"Clean, crowded, convenient",3.0,,"Air-conditioned, relatively affordable and with good connectivity. Massive disruptions occur now and then but don't usually last more than a couple of hours - penny wise, pound foolish planning."
,,Great transportation,5.0,,"Clean, fast, nice intruction to location. I was here 2012, I thoung my ez link card expire very surprice still can used."
,,Easy and Cheap,5.0,,The MRT makes it very easy to travel around. If you get an MRT card your trips will cost less than buying tickets for each trip separately. The minimum top up for those cards is 10 dollars. So if its the final leg of your trip and you need to travel in the MRT one way tickets are available.
,,Everyday traveller,4.0,,"I travel with MRT almost every day and it is also my first experience traveling in MRT every work day. It is fun, reliable and clean. There are occasions that it is running delayed but overall experience has been smooth"
,,"Awesome, easy transit system",5.0,,"So simple! Went to the station nearest our hotel, bought a 2 day pass. Hopped on and off as we pleased to get around Singapore, and at the end returned our passes for a refund of the pass card (not the fare amount loaded) cost. Brilliant!"
,,You won't believe it,5.0,,"Cheap, clean, fast, perfect. Real alternative of driving. It made all my prejudice of mass transportation vanish. Exemplary."
,,Convenient mode of transport.,4.0,,"Clean and user friendly to young and old. Accessible to prams and wheelchairs due to presence of lifts and escalators. However, due to recent upgrading works etc there has been disruptions to the service."
,,A train every 4 minutes - what's not to love?,5.0,,"The trains are clean, quiet - talking on mobiles is discouraged - and come regularly. We found the train system easy to use and easy to work out how to get around. We can't imagine Singapore before their train system was opened - great service."

,,best net work of metros connecting Singapore,5.0,,"One of the best metro line that I have seen coonecting allmost major part of city. Fully a/c and well connected. Clean on time, lovely information. transit points"
,,A marvel of Singapore,5.0,,"Now here is something done right - the MRT is an absolute blessing to get around Singapore with interconnecting buses and subways, is to navigate ... and cheap.

If you are visiting for a day or two enquire about getting a visitors tap on & off pass."
,,Fabulous cheap way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"The trains are efficient, clean and ""user friendly"" -- pretty easy to figure out how to find your way even when multiple transfers are required. Lots of posted and electronic signs, clear announcements (I'm used to the garbled messages of NY subway!), and trains run every few minutes. This rates amongst the best public transport system I've used."
,,great transport,5.0,,"easy after a couple of journeys & got the hang of it _ ask for a map if not given one, cheap & a good way to get around & for longer journeys eg. took it to harbour front then 2 cable cars to sentosa beaches easy!"

,,Delight to travel so much like the London experience .,5.0,,Apart from the fact that MRT is not well connected to the East Coast residential area but it is one of the MOST organised mode of travel. The staff is so polite and helpful . Loved my travels
,,Excellent,5.0,,You mostly cant skip SMRT experience if you use public transport in Singapore. If not its a must do. Same as tube or any other metro but very good staff trained with tourists.
,,Easy to use.,5.0,,You can get any where you want and save money. The subway system is easy to use and trains arrive every feww mins so the waits is not very long.
,,Great Transport System!,5.0,,Very cheap and very efficient! The whole system covers Singapore and almost door to door service in many popular destinations.
,,Best and easiest public transport ever,5.0,,"The MRT was one of the most efficient, easy to use and cleanest train systems we've used so far. We bought a 3 day tourist pass that gave us unlimited travel - and it was so easy. More efficient than the London tube or Paris metro. Would highly recommend"
,,It just works,5.0,,Quickest way to travel longer distances around the City in air-conditioned trains. Can be a bit of walking below street level. Tip: most ticket machines will not take notes of more than $5. Very civilised with passengers in orderly queues
,,"Cheap, Fast and best",5.0,,"I travel most of the time by SMRT and found complete value for money, i recommend use more and more SMRT instead of taxi."
,,Cheap and easy,4.0,,"This is the easiest and cheapest way to get around Singapore. The stations are conveniently located, well signposted and easy to get to. The stations themselves are spotless as are the trains. Make sure you return your ticket to get the 1 dollar refund at the end. The only down side is the queues at the ticket machines especially on the weekend."
,,How to get around,5.0,,The Singapore rail system is a very good way to get around without any problems. It works on time and is very easy to use with lots of information on the trains and at the station. If you get any problems just ask a staff member and they answer with knowledge and professional attitude to put it simply it's very hard to go wrong
,,I wish I had this at home,5.0,,"Virtually anywhere around Singapore with trains every 5-10 minutes. Clean, fast, efficient and not in the least expensive Just need a pre-paid card, £10.00 will last weeks and can also be used on the buses"
,,Moving around Singapore easily,4.0,,"The MRT makes Singapore one of the best connected cities. It brings us to most of the major attractions in Singapore, within walking distance. It is clean as commuters are not allowed to consume food or beverages inside the MRT. During peak hours, it could be crowded but the frequency of the train is high.

For tickets:
1. It is good to check out the Ezlink cards available for tourists when you arrive at the Changi Airport. It entitles you discounts to enter some popular tourist attractions like ""Garden at the Bay"".
2. Alternatively, you consider getting the stored value Ezlink card (like the locals), which is available at the MRT stations. You can top-up with money to travel around.

The advantage of getting an Ezlink card is the convenience. It can be used on both buses and MRT, and even entry to Sentosa. It is definitely much cheaper when compared to paying by cash or buses or getting single trip tickets.

Breakdowns/ delays:
In recent years, there are some major breakdowns of the train system. Occasionally, there are delays. However, free bus services are made almost immediately available to help transfer commuters from one station to another.

If caught in such a situation, one can either take the free bus service, or make alternative arrangement with the public bus transport, or call a cab.
- Be prepared if there is intent to call for private hired cars (e.g. Grab) as prices could jet-up many times higher than the usual 'due to sudden high demand' of cab services. So, go for public taxis instead (at the taxi stands). Each MRT station comes with a taxi stand after one exits from the MRT station. It's very convenient.
- To take public transport, it would be good to download the local transport app like bus@sg (check this info in the Singapore Tourism Board website)."
,,Good cheap transport,5.0,,We learnt how to use the MRT and found it a great way of getting around. Very cheap and fast. The stations are very clean and if you get lost there is always a staff member who can help you and explain the system to you. Most of our trips cost no more than $1.67 per train ride. The card you get can be refunded at the end of your holiday if you do not use it. The train is very clean and the school children get up from there seat to let you sit down. That was awesome.
,,Singapore mass rapid transport!!,2.0,,I would like to advise traveler not to take the Singapore MRT.. unless you are really on a tight budget and have a lot of time to spare.. because the mrt system in Singapore is very faulty and it break down on a daily basis... it will not affect the whole route but will you spend your holidays stuck in a train tube? Or rather spend abit more and explore this beautiful country! Have a nice holiday!
,,London Tube could learn so much from SMRT,5.0,,"Clean, fast and safe way to get around. Cool and interesting. Loos in most stations we went through."
,,the Metro,5.0,,One of the best modes of transports in singapore.well connects all most every place.clean and well maintained.Use the nets card for low charges.
,,Clean,5.0,,Quick to use to cover a large distance. Can be used with a stroller and so clean. Easily accessible via elevator.
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is clean, efficient and easy to use. There are several lines which cover most of the city. It is also great value for money."
,,Way to dependably travel safely and with ease.,5.0,,"I lived and worked in Singapore for 7 years. This was my primary travel mode - all over the island. Singapore locals do complain when there are failures, but these in my experience were very, very rare. If visiting, my advice is to buy a card that can be used on bus and metro. Simply tap on and off on both, add money as required on machines at MRT stations. This is cheaper than buying individual trip tickets. Phone apps are available that provide info on next buses, trains etc. Is there a better system anywhere else? Not that I know of."
,,Well connected and well maintained MRT.,4.0,,You can buy card and use both in SMRT and Bus... it is very well connected for the last mile. Very economical too.
,,Great underground system and very cheep,5.0,,Great way of getting around!!! It's by far the cheapest way of getting to see the city's attractions and not expensive as a lot of things in Singapore are ! Very clean and speedy service 👌
,,Very good,5.0,,Great way to travel in Singapore. Had no trouble using the transit and not so expensive. Was very clean. Very impressed
,,Very Efficient Public transport,5.0,,One reason commuting in Singapore is a very positive experience is that their train and bus are not only cheap but are also very efficient and covers majority of the tourist destinations and major malls.
,,Make this your priority.,5.0,,"Easy to use and cheap as chips this is the best way to travel around Singapore. Get a multi day pass or simply buy a card and top it up with funds like in Sydney or Melbourne. I bought an unlimited pass for 3 days that allowed unlimited travel on the subway, trains and buses. You can go all day."
,,Clean and efficient BUT,3.0,,"Singapore's MRT system was legendary when it first started. Clean, modern and efficient, it put older metros to shame. With a no chewing gum ban in place, trains and stations are still spotless.
However in recent years, the networks break down with alarming frequency. They are trying to deal with the breakdowns best as they can with more frequent service and better maintenance but it's still touch and go. For Singaporeans used to a zero tolerance level on breakdowns, we find such breakdowns irritating and time consuming.
Visitors can and should take the train. Maybe be not at peak times and hope for the best."
,,Great Public Transport,5.0,,"I have lived in Singapore for more than 3 years and never have thought to buy a car because of public transport. now i have moved to another country where first thing i needed to do was get license.
I am very thankful to Singapore Government for such great transport."
,,A fast and cool way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Singapore can be hot and humid most days but when you use the MRT you may mistaken that you are in some temperate country :)
,,It doesnt get better than this,5.0,,"I am always so impressed of Singapore's public transportation system. It works highly efficiently and its very affordable. The coverage in this island state is pretty good, and the trains are clean and come in reasonably good frequencies, especially in rush hour. The bus system is also fantastic with great connectivity around the city."
,,Useful public transportation in Singapore.,5.0,,"If any one asking me what is the most interesting thing in Singapore, my answer will be MRT system. There are some reasons supported my own idea. First is frendly environment. Second is cost. Third is user friendly."
,,Worlds best,5.0,,"Every time we visit Singapore we can't believe how fantastic the MRT system is. Impeccably clean, well organised and easy to naviagate. It puts Australia's train system to shame.

Make sure you take your child's passport if you want to obtain the free child's travel pass."
,,one of the best public transportation in the world,5.0,,"this is one of the things i love about singapore, its mass rapid transit, its clean, on time, you wont get lost, you can practically go anywhere in singapore using smrt. if you're a tourist and plan to travel a lot in singapore better get the smrt tourist pass, its cheaper and has options of how many days"
,,"To give an honest rating, its good but not as good as it was before",3.0,,"SMRT is improving but there are still breakdowns which will eventually be lesser as the new trains are coming online. Cleanliness is subjective, the old trains are not as clean but the new ones are pretty up to standards.
We look forward to the days where major breakdowns is kept to a minimum and everyone have a good trip.
Just one thing is that the planners think small when it comes to building new train systems. Think bigger... as we have more commuters and commuters are getting fatter in size. Not just local but foreigners also."
,,Still one of the most reliable transport networks in Singapore,5.0,,"Even though there are breakdowns now and then and they even seem to be getting more frequent, the MRT is still one of the most reliable transportation in Singapore. It's stress-free when I really just want to get from Point A to Point B, without worrying about having to keep my eyes on the road if I drive, or standing firm and not falling down if I take a bus. With the increase in stations and routes, there's almost nowhere you can't reach easily with the MRT. Compared to driving, it's relatively affordable, too. ;)"
,,Well conecting to most place of interest,4.0,,"It's easy & well connecting to most place of interest, malls, etc. Well connecting from airport with reasonable price."
,,clean and very fast,5.0,,clean and very fast! very cheap ticket is a good way to travel around the singapore! WE TAKE IT a lot of time!
,,Mass transit so much better than so many other places,4.0,,"People here in Singapore complain about Singapore mass transit a lot, but I for one think it's great. You only have to spend time in most other locations with far worse transit systems to really appreciate what we have here. Trains and buses run very regularly and cover most anywhere in Singapore that anyone would care to go. The only reason I didn't give it the maximum rating here is there HAVE been a lot of train breakdowns lately. I do believe, however, that these will soon stop occurring as they update some of the aging infrastructure and fine-tune the signalling system.
Also though, things could get less convenient for some people (especially tourists) in the future if the present plans to make it a completely cashless system actually come to pass."
,,Unreliable,2.0,,"As a people transportation service, the SMRT started well for many years. However, over the past 6-12 months, the number of problems cropping up is transitioning rider expectations from sympathetic to frustration. It gets really on everyone's nerves especially during peak hours and has affected employees, employers, families and even school children who were made late for their examinations. The excuses are becoming unacceptable.

I sincerely hope they find the root cause quickly and fix it."
,,Cleanest and safest mass transit system,5.0,,"The SMRT is the cleanest and safest mass transit system when compared with those in Tokyo, New York, Paris, Hong Kong, Beijing, and even in Seoul which is relatively clean. Reserved seats for the elderly, pregnant ladies, children are usually available for the needy. Foreign tourists just need to learn when to avoid the crowds during the rush hours on weekdays. And most of the subway trains cease operations after midnight."
,,First World Countries and Third World Transport,2.0,,"Very disappointed that the regular breakdowns and disruption of services, which always happen during the peak period, resulting in great inconvenices to the member of the public. Connecting services provide by bus is chaotic resulting in even great frustration to the commuters, esp. during the wet weather. Can't even compare to Hong Kong MTR. Same old excuse and poor maintenance and QA done on the purchase of such equipment."
,,Get there fast.......,5.0,,"Clean, fast and efficient public transport. The best way to get around. in Singapore. The underground - marvellous and the buses were clean, the drivers friendly. We used them as you would tourist buses."
,,"Simple, fast, cheap and effective.",5.0,,"It's definite must use in Singapore. It's very simpl, it's relatively fast (unless EW line breaks down :) ), it's cheap and it's super effective! Enjoy."
,,Upgrading work in progress,3.0,,Recently there are upgrading work in progress thus train might be delay or signalling fault. Be patient and be safe.
,,Excellent,5.0,,Great service - on time - smooth - clean. Very enjoyable ride. But don't eat or litter or else there will be a fine.
,,One of the most Efficient in the World,4.0,,"I use the SMRT virtually everyday to and from work and I have to say it really is a very easy ,economical and enjoyable way to get around Singapore .
All the stations are well air-conditioned and comfortable and the trains run every few minutes so waiting time is minimal .
Compared to other underground systems in the world this is probably the safest and most efficiently run
If you are in Singapore I would strongly recommend using the SMRT"
,,Easy to travel around Singapore,4.0,,"The transport system in Singapore is good, compare to many countries all over the world. It is easy to access anywhere in Singapore since it is a small red dot. Train timings are usually on-time and frequent."
,,Good connectivity for the city,4.0,,SMRT provides good connectivity for Singapore. Frequency is good during peak and off-peak hours. Breakdowns have increased particularly on the NS line recently.
,,Tourist pass for MRT rides?,3.0,,"For some reasons, there is little or promotional information for tourists when they do a few days-visit in Singapore. Little is known that they could buy 1-day or a few days' pass at selected train stations if they choose to commute by train covering the places of interest in Singapore. Check this out in Chinatown MRT"
,,Amazing service to travel all over Singapore for a very reasonable cost,5.0,,Used this while our holiday in Singapore. It is perhaps one of the best MRT systems in the world (perhaps after Hong Kong). This is very beautifully connected to all the major Bus stops so interchange is very easy and simple. Strict rules are in place so no one can eat or drink (SGD 500/- fine) which is a great thing. Really helpful for traveling in comfort and at a very reasonable cost. Connects all the major sightseeing points.
,,Clean and punctual,5.0,,It is so much better than TFL in London. Just buy disposable 6 trip pass and top up from GTM machines. It's very well connected and quite easy to use.
,,Convenient,4.0,,Extremely convenient Each station is attached to at least one shopping mall A bit shaky with frequent emergency breaks
,,So quick and easy!,5.0,,"The SMRT system in Singapore is super cheap and so easy! It can get you anywhere in the city in no time! Buy the card, it is worth it!"
,,A clean and cheap way to travel,5.0,,"This is the best 'tube' travel that I know. Clean, comfortable and cheaply-priced. the MRT network grows each time I visit Singapore."
,,I don't think any city in the world has a better transit system,5.0,,"I've travelled transit systems throughout the world in the various cities in the 70 countries that I have visited. While there may be some transit systems that come close, there certainly is no system that is better"
,,Worth making use of this facility,5.0,,clean and easy to use plenty space to move around Not over crowded very inexpensive Not particualry fast rolling stock but nice to travel in cooler atmosphere than walk in humid conditions above
,,"Efficient, speedy and squeaky clean MRT network...",5.0,,"It's hard to add anything more informative to the already exhaustive reviews for Singapore's excellent MRT (mass rapid transit) system. As somebody who lives in NYC I am flabbergasted every single time I visit Asia of just what it means to run a proper mass transit... Every time I return back to NYC, I weep, literally, when riding our subways...

Even more cleaner and efficient than Hong Kong's MTR (mass transit railway) and that says something.

Get the tourist card at the Changi airport station, you can return it and get back the S$10 deposit plus whatever you have left on it. I found it cheaper to just load it up rather than getting unlimited 3-day pass, esp. if you stay downtown or near the Marina Bay area, everything is so close that you end up walking or just taking a few stops here and there, costing you less than a dollar a trip. I'd get unlimited card only, if I was planning daily far-out excursions, or really using the system all the time rather than exploring the city on foot.

AMAZING!!!"
,,Nice,4.0,,This transport system is really good and simple to understand and to travel.The train are frequent and on time.Most of the places can be reached through metro .
,,Way to go !!,5.0,,"What a fantasy transport system ! Clean , efficient , cheap friendly helpful staff . Wasn't sure about getting a non refundable card instead of a $20. 3 day pass but it worked out cheaper , and we still have money on for our trip here next year !"
,,The Best service in the world!,5.0,,"There really isn't much to say about this service. Its cheap, its on time, its super clean and is so easy to use. The only thing that you need to watch out for as a tourist is, given the heat you need to stay hydrated but DO NOT drink anything on the MRT as you can be fined. I find this crazy but thats the laws there. There is even an app that is free to download with the MRT map so you can get around the city easy."
,,"cheap transportation, on time and accessibility",5.0,,"when I visit Singapore, I'm using MRT to strolling around Singapore. its easy to find, cheap, on time but so crowded when you go with this in very morning or in afternoon. but it's great transportation."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Efficient, clean, easy to navigate and safe. Our longest wait for a train was about 4 mins. Ticket machines easy to use with a little practise."
,,Good fasilities,4.0,,"Good, quickly and easy transport to go to another places, but we must meet a lot of people in the morning time and afternoon time"
,,Super efficient Mass rail system,5.0,,"The MTR in SIN should be the benchmark by which all metro systems around the world should be standardized to,"
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,"We have used the MRT many time, always easy to use with the EZ Link card. Nice and cool and they appear to be building new lines all of the time. Very convenient"
,,Simple and efficient,4.0,,"Came to Singapore for 6 days and bought a set of tourist travel cards for the family, sack costs $38 but you'll get $10 refund if you return it within 5 days. You can use it for bus/subways for unlimited travel for 3 days which turned out to be so convenient and cheap without having to look for loose change everything."
,,SMRT stupid proof,5.0,,"I am not a great public transport user but the SMRT is stupid proof, colour coded. Need bigger signs that the ticket machine doesn't take $10 notes if fare is under $5"
,,Very convenient but can be confusing,4.0,,"We visited Singapore for a week and used a mix of transportation modes, with buses being the most convenient choice. We purchased EZ Link cards which provided access to buses and MRT. While it was easy to figure out that we needed to scan the card upon entry of the bus, we missed the step to scan the cards when exiting the bus. This resulted in getting over charged and so we quickly ran out of funds. Also, we couldn't use another person's card other than our own to complete the entire journey in case the funds ran too low. And when we finally got to a station to refill the cards, the minimum amount of $10 per card was more than what we needed for the rest of the trip so it was wasted money. I have to admit it was a learning curve issue on my part. But it didn't appear those info were readily available to tourists."
,,MRT - Mass Rapid Transport,5.0,,"When I look on trip advisor before we went to Singapore I was surprised to see this rated second of things to do while you stay. Now I've used it I would say it should be first. We managed to buy a ticket at the airport one way into Orchard road to our accommodation for about $2. The next day we found the Singapore information centre the lay there suggested we get a NETS Flash Pay as we stayed for a week. Same as what locals used. The card was about $3 to buy and we loaded it with $10 and half way through the week added another $10. We travel everywhere near and far on the MRT and loved it. CLEAN, FAST & CHEEP. What more could you want."
,,Excellent public transportation system- tips: 1. purchase a pre-paid EZ Link card; 2. Check the extent of the network,5.0,,"This is a great way to see Singapore- its a very economical, efficient, safe and clean service, which, with its broad network, can take you to many Singapore attractions.

Talking with other visitors, it is well worth familiarising yourself with the extent of the train network: it can take you to more places than you may expect.

Also, be sure to purchase an EZ Link prepaid card, which will save you money, as well as making your journeys easier."
,,"Clean,efficient cheap",5.0,,"Best public transport I've encountered in a long time. Very easy to navigate the tourist six times ticket works well. So clean no sticky split food here, very organised around embarking and disembarking. Reasonable prices for a first world transport system."
,,"Easy to use, air conditioned and cheap",5.0,,"Not much to say, its a train after all, although its probably the best version of this type of transport I have experienced anywhere in the world."
,,Super clean MRT,5.0,,I enjoyed my ride with the SMRT. It was very clean compared to other MRTs seen around the globe and you never felt unsafe. Trains have been on time and the connection is quite good and much faster than driving by car.
,,Great way to get round the city,5.0,,"This is a great way to get round the city and probably the cheapest metro system anywhere in the world it cost less than 2SGD to get from the airport to our hotel, and the trains were air conditioned and very clean"
,,Great transportation,4.0,,"I love travelling by SMRT while I am in Singapore, very convenience, easy way to go around, tourist site and shopping mall. Fast and clean, air conditioned, always On Time."
,,Cleanest mass transit I've ever encountered.,5.0,,"Singapore definitely knows how to maintain the cleanliness and efficiency of their city and that extends to their mass transit (MRT) as well. They have pretty rigid rules as far as what is allowed and not allowed (fyi....if you're visiting Singapore - it is against the law to chew gum!) For example, you are not allowed to carry Durian (that stinky, spiny fruit common to Southeast Asia) onto the MRT. And, the mass transit authority even goes as far as marking the subway platform with footprints of where you should stand when waiting for an approaching train, so that you're not blocking people trying to get off. And, amazingly people listen!"
,,Smrt bus service,5.0,,We traveling with smrt and mrt in Singapore its a government transport services with too much facilities
,,Cheap as chips and easy to use.,5.0,,Can we take this home? Great transport system. Really well run with lots of trains. Travel instructions easy to read and cheap. SGD 2.80 to get from airport to city!! Only advice have small change on you to buy tickets in auto pay boxes.
,,Good,4.0,,Useful. Inexpensive. Comfortable. At times crowded. In a big city this enables moving relatively easily and quickly. Avoid traffic but the map isn't as good as Hong Kong.
,,Easy rider,4.0,,This system is comprehensive and easy to use. It will get you to almost anywhere in Singapore. It also well lit and very clean.
,,Excellent and easy,5.0,,Highly recommend using the SMRT. It's cheap and extremely easy to use. If you keep your ticket you can use it for 6 trips with a 10c discount on the third and 10c refund on the sixth. If you are in Singapore for more than a stopover then you may find it more beneficial to get a travel card.
,,"Fast, sharp and cheap",5.0,,"Do not doubt about it!!! The best way to move round Singapore. The net is wide and you can reach almost every zone of the city.
Take the Ez-Link card, you´ll save money and it's easy to get and use.

,,Efficient Transport,5.0,,"If you want to get around in Singapore and don't have a car, this is one of the best ways to do it. A tourist pass will allow you to get on the trains and bus network and it does not cost you an arm and a leg. The signs are in English as well and there's lots of information counters around. The trains are clean, air conditioned and pretty much on time. Gets a bit crowded during peak times but its an easy way to get around."

,,you don't need a car,5.0,,in singapore to go from one place to another you don't need a car. the transit system is so strong that it takes you to each corner of singapore. amazing.
,,Best in the world,5.0,,Singapore's mass transit system is so easy to navigate!!! It is impeccably clean. There are stops within easy walking distance from everywhere I wanted to go (I did have to transfer to a bus to get to and from the zoo but that also was VERY easy).
,,Well coordinated | Easy to use and follow signs,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is the best compare to HongKong MRT. There were lots of signages to follow and guaranteed you will never be lost! I purchased the 3 day Tourist Pass and it's unlimited use for 3 consecutive days. ( you have to use it consecutively otherwise, unlimited use will expire if you skip a day)
The people are well disciplined and the train itself always comes on time. The whole MRT is well cleaned and maintained."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Trying the subway in a foreign country can be a little scary. Being from the US I can say it was a breeze.
,,Way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,So easy to get around Singapore. Bought a three day pass. Great value for money. Never have to wait for more than a few minutes
,,Easy and cheap,5.0,,MRT in singapore is the best way to get around. It is very easy to use and cheap... Just get your self a card that costs 5 Singapore Dollar and then top up as you travel. I stayed there 5 nights and travelled around everywhere and only topped up for 15 SGD.
,,A Must to see Singapore at ease BUT not at peak times!,5.0,,The MRT is so efficient and well run. Guards stay at the entrance to the doors to usher you in..and at times ensure that everyone gets pushed in lol!!! Get a free map and go early or late to the places you wish to visit. The MRT is cheap..efficient and it goes to the airport with very little hassle of changing trains. Some blogs say it is complicated to travel on the MRT/SMRT to and from the airport! Rubbish!! two changes maximum and very cheap and comfortable.
,,"Clean, Punctual and Easy to Use.",5.0,,"We travelled via Singapore Mass Rapid Transit to the Singapore Botanic Gardens on our first day in Singapore. The station was easy to find, easy to use and so nice and clean. It was a great experience in how things 'can' be done properly."
,,Easy to use and cheap,5.0,,"The MRT is the best we have seen, just buy a ezy card and top up as required, trips are cheap like $0.77 or $2 depending on how far, off peak is the way to go. so we used only $20 for 2 weeks"
,,So efficient & well run.,5.0,,"Traveling on the train is a great experience, it is well organised and efficient, a train seem to run every few minutes.
Being oldish people, there were seat on the train that people gave to us to sit down.
It is best to buy a Tourist Pass at the airport or at the rail station, you can cash in the ticket at the end of you travel for a refund. Then you can tap on & off instead of having t have the correct money for the train & Buss.
In all a great experience."
,,Love IT !,4.0,,"Always the best way to get around this magic city. Good time keeping, clean and well signposted. What more can one want."
,,excellent efficient transport system!,5.0,,"On our local Aussie friend advice we took the bus to the gardens and was so impressed with the cleanliness, efficiency and service offered by the transport system. Airconditioned, new, on time, and comfortable...couldn't ask for more. And a system we could understand, simply using a touch card on and off. Great!!"
,,Brilliant transport system,5.0,,"Brilliant and inexpensive way of getting round Singapore. I used it and the bus to go from Outral Park to the Changi Museum, at a cost of $1.60 (instead of paying $60 for the same service from a tour provider). Lonely Planet guide toi Singapore is great here, since it goves all transport options."
,,A fast way to travel,5.0,,"As with the buses, this is a great at to get around. Very clean and cool with the air conditioning. It can get busy during peak times."
,,why no garbage cans?,3.0,,Eating/Drinking is not allowed on the MRT hence why there are no garbage cans throughout the subway. I understand keeping the city clean.. but its really a headache if you do have any trash.
,,Singapore is the best due to SMRT!,5.0,,"Usually I would taxi and occasional MRT for maneuvering this island. This time we bought 3-day pass and managed to make use of the ticket. We got on and off MRT and once the bus. But not sure if the pass was valid to SMRT taxi. The pass was especially economical as we went to any destination by subway. Convenience, accuracy and speed became the drive for using the pass. Next time planning to go with my teenager!"
,,Daunting but help is available,5.0,,"Cheap, easy and a fast way to travel around Singapore. We had help from MRT staff on our first trip on how to select and pay for tickets from Gardens on the Bay back to Orchard Road which cost $1.60 vs $18 for a taxi. Do not forget to consult the map to identify the nearest MRT and then plot your course on the MRT system map. We also used the 105 bus to and 106 bus from the botanical gardens to Orchard Road but you need to have the exact fare and ask the driver to alert you when to get off. Was this helpful?"
,,get about,5.0,,"The train system is amazing, we bought an MRT card for $12 which gave us $7 of travel (you can top up this card at any time either at a kiosk or machine and the card last for 5 years) You can travel almost forever on this amount. There are four different lines which takes you to almost every part of Singapore and all the stations inter connect so you don't have to keep looking for the right station. If you should have credit on you card at the end of your holiday, just go to a ticket kiosk and they will reimburse you. Try it, it is brilliant!!"
,,Can't go wrong,5.0,,"Not really too much to say here other thank it is a great, cheap and frequent way to get around Singapore. It is also very well signed and easy to navigate."
,,Best MRT in the world?,5.0,,"We are 65 year old reasonably fit Aussies of Chinese decent. Could not believe that we were offered seats on almost every peak hour journey that we took. So clean, so safe, so easy, so cheap and so efficient. Interesting anecdotal experience which was disappointing, was that the young Singapore Indians and Singapore Malays would stand up for us more than the Singaporeans of Chinese decent."
,,Best transport in the world,5.0,,"Singaporeans know how to do public transport. So clean, modern & fast. A train every few minutes- everyone is so polite. Well lit, easy to navigate. Funny posters about manners when on the train. One carriage had a loungeroom motif- curtains and rugs- we had a good giggle. Get a transit card and load it- it costs $5 each but each trip is about 50% off from buying a single ticket. Plus they are a cute souvenir."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We put $22 on a mrt card and went everywhere for ten days and still had $5 left at the end of our stay. We never used taxis and went to Chinatown, gardens by the Bay twice , little India, boon tat area , Clarke quay, Sentosa island , orchard road, the list goes on . Three minutes was the longest we had to wait for a train fantastic. They arrived clean. The commuters were respectful and we wouldn't hesitate on recommending this mode of transport for getting around"
,,Fast and Efficient,5.0,,"Clean, fast, well organised are the words that come to mind when using Singapores MRT. Easy to access, well thought out with clear direction for passengers.

,,very convenient,5.0,,"if you are a tourist and plan to go around a lot, i recommend that you get the tourist pass. it costs $20 for three days, which is really worth it in my opinion. YOu'll have to pay a $10 deposit upfront but u will get back the deposit upon returning the card."
,,easy wat to travel,5.0,,"We (hubby & I) had 3 days in Singapore, so the fastest and easiest way to get around was by using the MRT. Just buy tickets from the machine in the wall, use ticket to get through the turnstyle, board train. So easy. We stayed in a hotel away from the centre, and only 2 blocks from the station. So it was the most sensible mode of transport. So clean and efficient."
,,The Change to the MRT,4.0,,"The MRT is quite cool. The East West Line was extended from Joo Koon to Tuas Plaza in 18 June 2017. We are waiting for the MRT - new signalling system to arrive into the North South Line.

Very soon, it will be the Downtown Line for all! This is to recommend that, SMRT will join TripAdvisor."

,,Perfection!,5.0,,"We are from Toronto and the MRT is HEAVEN compared to the TTC. It's clean, very organized. Trains are air conditioned and easy to navigate.

The fare is a little expensive. We made the mistake of purchasing a $16 weekend tourist pass when we should have just bought the EZ-link card and put $10 on it.

This is the best way to get around. Would recommend it for everyone. Just don't forget that there is no eating or drinking on the MRT."

,,Best and Smartest way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"The first time I visited Singapore, I was silly and took a taxi into the city. It wasn't until I was already there that I found out the SMRT was just downstairs in the Airport and stops are almost everywhere you would want to go in Singapore. The transport is excellently clean and so regular it is hard to believe. It is very inexpensive and the only way to get around. I couldn't recommend it more. My tip is to buy a card and top it up when needed."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,The usual reliable train system takes you to most places with reasonable prices . Of late there were breakdowns but a longer wait is all you need to do. Alternative travel plans need to be considered
,,cheap and efficient way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"On my previous trips to Singapore, I mainly used taxies. they were difficult to find, relatively expensive and sometime a bit unreliable. However, this time I used MRT and can't talk high enough. Its a great way to travel in Singapore. Very efficient, cheap and very reliable. Staff at MRT stop are very friendly and helpful. Even my little daughter could work the map out very easily and was a great way to keep her entertained as well... Highly recommend it to anyone!"
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"A super efficient subway system, that can easil get you anywhere in a short time. Very clean and punctual."
,,Excellent way to explore the city,5.0,,"My son and I arrived at Changi Airport at 6.30am and once through customs we decided since it was quite we would tackle the SMRT (subway train) to get into the city. The first minor hick up change for the ticket machine as the machine does not take notes over $5 so make sure u have plenty of small notes on you. Now the system is all colour coded so it is very easy to follow the system to your destination .. To into the city we had to change after about three stops , once again not a problem . We were extra lucky as we were staying at the V Lavender hotel and the train stops directly beneath it, there is an elevator that takes you to the hotel. Once you purchase a ticket u can reuse it 6 times giving u a 10cent discount on the third and 6th trip. We found. The SMRT was the best way to explore the city espy in the hot humidity of the day, we got to most places within easy walking distance but try to avoid the trains from 5.30pm till about 7.30 rush her everyone coming home from work. It's cheap and punctual."
,,Clean and punctual,5.0,,Excellent efficient service. The carriages are clean and fomfortable and the traibs are on time. Great job!
,,Excellent system,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is so easy and very similar to the London underground. We got a 3 day Singapore Tourist pass each which was SGD 30 ($20 plus $10 refundable deposit) and this enabled us unlimited MRT and bus travel. Perfect for seeing all the sights!. We found it extremely clean with no grafitti and very simple to use.
,,Top efficient infrastructure - the best wau to move around,5.0,,The MRT is a top efficient and clean infrastructure. It is the ideal way two travel inside the city and to/from the airport. Travelling time between key touristic spots are short. The staff is helpful and information displayed very clear. Just use it.
,,"Clean, efficient safe",5.0,,"Very clean subway as you’d expect from Singapore. Can get very crowded during morning and evening rush hour. Trains seem to arrive at least every 5 minutes so you won’t be waiting long.
Like many big city train stations they include extensive underground passageways and most are connected to malls where you can shop or eat.
Connects you to many major attractions and places to eat. Chinatown, little India, downtown, etc.

Get the SG Railways app to help you figure out how to get from point A to point B.

If there for more than a few days, buy an EZ link card to make it easier to travel by MRT."
,,Fast and punctual,4.0,,Can be named as the cheapest and fastest way to travel through the city without any hassle whatsoever. Highly recommended.
,,Cheapest & convenient to transport in Singapore,5.0,,"If u go to Singapore & want to save cost for transportation, u only need to buy an EZ-link card and use for MRT! The service is nice, on time and convenient for me. The mrt station is everywhere & if u go to work early, don't forget to take some newspapers at the station on way to board the train :)"
,,TFL come and take notes on how to run a transport system!,5.0,,Everything mass transport isn't in the UK. Its clean it runs on time its cheap its easy to use its not over crowded if the UK want people to use public transport they should go to Singapore to learn how its done!
,,A choice to move around.,4.0,,"Clean, comfortable, & easy to understand the train map & routes (the easiest and almost as easy as in Malaysia). SMRT covers most of attractions in Singapore. If you are planning for 'no-hastle-trip', don't forget to buy the tourist pass (costs SGD20 for 3-day-pass). If you want to try a single trip ticket, you can buy it from the machine which located in every stations (they are easy too). Either way, the on-charge staffs are always ready and helpful to clear your confusion."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"This is the best way to get around, fast, clean and reliable. Use the Tourist card and reload as necessary, the cards last for some years so keep for the next visit! Signs all in English and if you have used the London Underground, the maps are easy to follow. The stations are incredibly free of litter ( and grafitti) which is amazing as there are not that many rubbish bins around."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The mrt in Singapore is fantastic,always on time,clean,the staff are friendly,it's puts my transport system in Queensland to shame"
,,Too much room for improvement,1.0,,"It used to be that when Singapore was mentioned, a couple of things would come immediately to mind - safe, clean and green, world-class airport, fast and efficient transport system. These days, I'm not sure the latter holds much truth anymore. The frequency and regularity with which our MRT trains break down has become a huge embarrassment and created huge inconvenience to commuters. Peak hour travel is extremely unpleasant with trains being so crowded. Huge improvements needed."
,,so easy to get around,5.0,,Easy and cheap to get around - get a map from the change booth which is easier then on your phone etc.... Great if your hotel is walking distance from a station - Trains go to/from the Airoport.
,,Fast efficient & clean,5.0,,Great service running very regularly. Even if you are here for short time it is better to buy the EZ-Link card out right rather than the 3 day tourist pass unless you plan to be catching 10+ trains per day
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"This is one of the best transport systems in the world, easy, simple and well priced. There are a variety of cards you can buy and will receive a refund when you hand it in as you leave. The system is efficient, clean and safe, MRT stations are very easy to access, never very long to wait and the announcements along with the directory in the train are also excellent. Purchase a card at the station"
,,Best and reliable mode of public transport in Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT was very cheap, efficient and reliable way in getting us around Singapore. The frequency between train arrivals was great and in most cases less than 4 minutes. We found there was no need to rush into an already packed train. Tip: The least packed train carriages are usually furher away from the staircases and elevators."
,,Good idea with room for improvement,4.0,,The pass is a bargain for travel by train but was let down by the availability on buses. We got on 3 different bus routes and found they didnt support the use of the pass. This was a contradiction to the claim that the pass is good for all basic bus services in the pocket guide.
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"This is the best way to get around if your are a tourist. Services run very frequently, its clean, its quick and it goes almost everywhere. If you are interested in seeing the gardens, the sky rider, orchard street or going to any of the tourist hotspots the MRT will take you there."
,,Easy going,5.0,,You can travel throughout Singapore very smooth and cheap with the MRT. They're clean and safe. You have all kind off cards to choose off!
,,Only way to get around,5.0,,"As always, it's quick, cheap & stations near everything you need to visit. Tip. If your only going to one place and return to start, look at return ticket price. I found it cheaper than getting the Day Pass."
,,"Clean, safe, regular",5.0,,"I love the SMRT in Singapore, if only all metro systems could be more like it.
You wait a short while, a train comes, people allow passengers off before embarking, easy to navigate, no fuss and not too crowded either.
Great for getting around Singapore with an EZ link card, everyday travel made simple."
,,Crowded but Convenient,5.0,,This includes both the Metro Trains & the Buses A Pass of the MRT & a Map of the City & u can reach any corner of Singapore. The trains & Buses are on time with electronic Displays Cannot Eat/Drint in the MRT
,,Perfect for getting around Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, safe, fast. Buy the tourist pass - it's definitely worth it at 20 dollars (30 then a 10 refund)"
,,Very convenient,5.0,,Best option to get around Singapore quickly. We bought a tourist card that covered us for the 3 days we were there. Trains are clean and run on time. Very easy to find your way around - everything is mapped/signed well
,,Travel all over Singapore with ease,5.0,,"The MRT is quick, efficient and great value. You can travel all over Singapore easily. Everything is so well signposted, staff in ticket offices speak English well and are very helpful."
,,20SGD for a 3 day tourist pass,5.0,,20SGD is all what it takes to fully go around Singapore using this world class MRT. You can use the 20SGD tourist pass on the public bus too.
,,Unreliable,1.0,,"Always breakdown there in the morning. Almost every week or every other week , there will be train breakdowns due to signal fault, track fault. Not reliable to take train at all. You want to be late for work for school, I highly recommend take Singapore train."
,,Phenomenal,5.0,,"Quick, clean, efficient and wheelchair friendly. Can be crowded. Sometimes the bus might be more direct and faster."
,,Salute!,5.0,,So convenient! Going all around Singapore is so easy and comfortable. Saves a lot of time and money specially when you have the e-z card. Loaded.. all you hv to do is swipe your card and ride away.
,,So well organised and clean,5.0,,MRT is so easy to use and clean. Services run very frequently so there is no waiting around and even though thousands use the service it doesn't seem cramped even in peak hour. Some of the stations are huge and there is a fair amount of walking but they are all well signed. It's also really cheap using a tourist pass you get unlimited travel and you can choose the number of days you need. Great system!
,,A convenient affordable form of transport,5.0,,"The MRT makes life easier for travellers as you can easily go around the city quickly. The trains are frequent and well coordinated. All you need is a pass and a map, both of which are easily available at every station."
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore'sMRT is the best. Trips are inexpensive, buy a 3-day pass or a pay-as-you-go tourist pass which you can top up if you need to. You even get unspent $$ refunded (apart from the $5 cost of the ticket itself). Trains run regularly and on time, they're clean and full of information so you cant get lost. Every carriage has electronic displays to tell you where you are, what line you're on and where you can change trains to go somewhere else. Staff are available on stations but you wont need them because the system is pretty much foolproof."
,,One of the best,5.0,,Clean efficient cheap public transport what every major metropolis should have. Easy to find your way around using the color coded lines
,,Cheap way to get around,4.0,,We used the MRT to get to and from the zoo (with short taxi rides also needed). It's a great way to travel and see how the natives do it. For anyone on a tight budget it's a must and the MRT covers a wide area so it will get you most places you need to go.
,,Clean and fast subway.,4.0,,"Clean and fast subway. There are a lot of people at work time. More than four travelers recommend taxi, Über or Grab."
,,"clean, efficient and user-friendly",4.0,,"Most tourist spots are reached by MRT. The MRT system is user-friendly. You won't get lost even it's your first time to explore the city. One problem is, the travel card itself is non-refundable, you can only withdraw the money in the card."
,,Amazing transport system,5.0,,"Easy & fast to get around, bought 3 day tourist pass & renewed it twice, very cheap way to travel & easy once you worked out the interchange stations. We travelled from Clarke Quay to Airport day we were leaving with 2 changes & cost $2.50 each took about an hour so approx twice as long as by car but at a fraction of the cost, when we arrived it cost $26 for cab from airport to accomodation."
,,If only all the metro's in the World were like Singapore,5.0,,"Its crazy that on Trip Advisor Singapore SMRT is number 2 in things to do.

I can not think of another system in the World where this would be the case but there is good reason for this - Singapore SMRT is truly the best public transport system and is a great show piece of how to make mass public transport work. It is also so clean.

On returning to UK and taking the London underground, yes you have the nostalgia and the history but boy do I miss the MRT - until we ride again !!"
,,Clean and fast subway system,4.0,,"Have small bills when obtaining tickets. Credit cards can be used for more expensive trips. Subway cars are clean, comfortable and best of all air conditioned."
,,Cheap way to beat the heat and get around,5.0,,"We bought four NETS cards at the local MRT station on our first day in Singapore, $12 each including $7 of travel. Every bus trip that we took was 77c each, so we used the bus about 8 times in our trip and didn't need to reload the cards. Great value. Note that children 7 and older or taller than 120 cm (4 feet) pay full adult fare."
,,Quickest mode of transport in singapore,5.0,,The MRT is cheapest and quickest mode of transportation in Singapore. It is smooth and very efficient. It does gets crowded during peak hours.
,,It's very good,5.0,,"The card is S$5 and non refundable the minimum amount you can put in the card is S$7. You can save more if you buy the stored card coz the price for every trip is less on stored card compare to not stored card. Theres train station all over the city, it depends on where you will go. There's map and the direction is written in English. Inside of the train there's monitor that show the location of the train and the next station so you will not be lost. It's passenger friendly. There's reserve seats for pregnant, disabled, children and older adults. It's accessible to all."
,,Very Intuitive and Easy to Use,5.0,,"The SMRT is super easy to figure out, even if it's your first time. It's clean and very cheap and takes you nearly everywhere you could possibly want to go."
,,Best Transportation in Singapore,4.0,,"Efficient, clean, cheap. I would use all the words of praise to SMRT.
However, I thought SMRT has a defect. It's self-help ticketing for the standard ticket. I don't know how to add trips for multiple tickets so that I have to add trips one by one. That's pretty slow and complicated. The line is pretty long at many stations which only have one or two GTM.
I guess there's a way to add trips for multiple tickets but nobody told us and the system didn't mention that."
,,So Easy,5.0,,Simply get an EZI Card available at the Changi Airport train station and away you go on both trains and buses. A great way to see more of Singapore than just Orchard Road.
,,"Clean, cheap and efficient",5.0,,Compared to other metro systems across the world this one is excellent. Many locals will complain about delays and busy trains during rush hour but nothing compared to for example London and NYC. It recently has been extended with the downtown line and further extensions are planned in the coming years
,,Great public transport system,5.0,,We used this every day to get around and it's great. Buses and subway are very easy to use and very cheap.
,,Convenient and clean,5.0,,Very clean and easy to navigate and most rides are quite inexpensive. Stations are conveniently located. If your group is more than 5 person might be cheaper to take an Uber.
,,"Efficient, affordable, clean",5.0,,"The MRT is definitely one of the best options to get around Singapore. A majority of the tourist are within walking distance of the stations which can be helpful during those hot days. It is very easy to navigate as the directions are provided in English and detailed maps are provided throughout the stations. The trains are frequent so you are never left waiting for long. The entrances are labelled clearly so you are aware of which exit to take for specific attractions. It is really hard to get lost. You can buy the MRT at the airport and respective stations and easily top up at the ticket offices or booths available throughout. The stations are very clean and there are clear signs that prohibit smoking and food and drink.

The Singapore Tourist Pass is also available for tourists visiting offering unlimited rides on the public buses, MRT and LRT during the time period allocated. There are cards for 1, 2 and 3 day passes for S$10, S$16 and S$20 respectively. The card is subject to a S$10 rental deposit which is refunded if returned within 5 days."
,,Cheap reliable and AIR-CON,5.0,,"Having lived in London and had to endure the underground system this was a god send and a testament to what a good quality metro should be.

Cheap relatively to UK and reliable but also tourist friendly along with air conditioning throughout. It was a pleasure to use the system and quite enjoyable actually."
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,"This is by far the best way to travel around this city. Clean, fast and affordable. Very easy to use as well, but staff available if you need advice. Collect the network map when you purchase your card."
,,Lifeline of Singapore!!!!!,5.0,,"If you are in singapore for tourism, MRT will help you seeing places at cheap rides. MRT will help you budget your visit and the saved money can be spent otherwise. 1 or 2 rides will make you familier with the routes and stations, so it become easy and economical."
,,Very informative,5.0,,You have to see the direction sign which ever you wanna go. Integrated railway and easy to catch is plus point for tourist. Also you can choose between single ticket pass or mrt card (can be top up in every ticket machine along the mrt station).
,,Zoom,5.0,,"Clean. Quick. Reliable. Cheap. Avoid the expensive taxis and get everywhere you want to go by train. The system is world class, with stations so conveniently placed at key points, you don't need any other form of transport. Well played Singapore. Well played."
,,To avoid at peak hours - Consistent delays!,3.0,,"I have not been taking the MRT much the last few years as my current workplace is off the train line. I have been reading in the news and was also told our MRT has been consistently delayed during peak hours. I don't believe as I was used to it being very efficient and reliable before, not until I experience a bad delay myself. As a for-warning, AVOID it at peak hours!! You will NOT enjoy the delay with the crowd."
,,The best Underground travel,5.0,,"Fast, regular, spacious, clean, accessible, numerous, connected. Singapore has the best underground."
,,Smart Modern Rapid Trains!,5.0,,"The SMRT is easily accessible, cheap, safe and a very efficient way to move around Singapore. Get a map and enjoy the fantastic service."

,,Great system of travel for a Tourist,5.0,,"I love the Singapore MRT...

It goes everywhere I need to go as a Tourist and/or a Business traveler. I am so comfortable with the system that I even use it to get to hotel from airport.

The entire complex is very clean. Good efficient service, with good supporting facilities such as elevators, escalators, ticketing machines and counters, and great efficient support staff.

Very organized and methodical, with well disciplined people as co-travel mates.

The best MRT system I've experienced."
,,An easier and faster way of commuting,5.0,,SMRT is the best and the way it is handled. Easier to commute and entire city is well connected. So whichever place you want to visit you will be easily able to go. We bought the MRT cards as soon as we landed at the airport on 15th and they costed 12 SGD per person with a balance of 7SGD. It really helped and made our daily commute to sites much easier and hassle free.
,,Nice way to travel,4.0,,Clean nice way to travel especially to the airport. Ask advice at the counter will get you to your destination.
,,Easy to Go Metro,5.0,,The cleanest metro system in the world. New lines will make it more convenient. Easy to use and frequent trains.
,,Great,4.0,,"On time, reasonably priced, comfortable and clean. Stations are clean and tidy just like everything in Singapore. But sometimes staffs might be rude"
,,A very efficient MRT system,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is very efficient and very well connected. Being a small city, all the central areas are very well connected. The trains are clean and the stations have all the facilities."
,,World Class,5.0,,"Singapore metro is the best. It is really cheap, fast, efficient, clean, and puctual. It goes almost everywhere in singapore."
,,Best MRT,4.0,,"One of the best mrt...clean , fast , frequent and comfortable..never eat or drink inside the mrt or train (it is offence)."
,,This is the way to travel,5.0,,"So clean compared to London. So easy to use, the maps are simple, the ticket machines work, and the trains are on time. Air conditioned luxury without having to pay a premium."
,,It Just Works!,5.0,,"Clean, tidy, well-lit, SAFE, inexpensive, frequent trains, (mostly) orderly passengers. Everything you expect from Singapore. An example for all other cities."
,,No longer a world-class transport system,2.0,,"Prior to 2011, Singapore was able to boast that it had a great transport system in SMRT. Then a major breakdown happened that year. Fast forward to 2017, the problem still has not been solved. In fact it has gone from bad to worse. Breakdowns and delays have continued unabated (in fact they have been increasing) since then. Reasons given are usually either track fault or signalling system problem.

Even on a non-breakdown days, the speed has atrociously slowed down as well. A friend who commutes from Woodlands to Raffles Place everyday to work now takes about 60-75 mins compared to 40 mins pre-2011 breakdown. And this happens very frequently for the past few years. True that they put ""please allow more time for a more comfortable journey"" on each of their journey time board. But giving AT LEAST 50 percent more time sounds rather ridiculous, especially if you have to commute every single day.

Just for the past 2 days, there are already 2 breakdowns (yesterday evening and this morning), both during peak hours, leaving many, many passengers stranded with the fares of Uber and Grab skyrocketed and it took very long just to get a cab.

On another note, since 2011, SMRT also started to implement ""seatless cabins"". This supposedly was created to give more space. From a surface it may sound it would help, but one look at those seatless area, you will know that it does not. Nobody would stand THAT close to another passenger (practically you have to stand face to face within a couple of centimetres), trust me, even when it is packed. (I am talking about face to face, not side by side). And during non-peak hours, you will see this seatless area is practically vacated, making it an even more useless space.

I used to have high hopes that SMRT will pick itself up, but after nearly 7 years of continuous breakdowns, disruptions, delays, and making rather useless decisions such as building those seatless cabins, but yet keep increasing its fares, I think it would take a miracle for them to be back to what it once was. A rather huge one, too."
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap",5.0,,"I ride the MRT when I have time and the contrast with, say, New York or London is marked.
Trains are on time, very clean, filled with respectful citizens who really do not need irritating cartoons to remind them to give up their seat or put their bag down at peak times.
I also love the anti Terror infomercials shown at the stations. They are so hammy."
,,Excellent from the very beginning....,5.0,,"In 2017 SMRT has completed 30 years of operations, it is one of the best in the world. Best part being their frequency and connectivity. You get 2-3 minimum options through various lines to reach different locations. Just excellent, neat and clean, adequate signage, numerous washrooms, stations are just marvelous with most of them having malls."
,,Clean and affordable,5.0,,"This is one of the better Metro systems in the world. It is clean and litter free and is very, very cheap to use. It has plenty of networks that continue to grow. Use this to zip about the city."
,,Underground Surprise,4.0,,"Maps made traveling easy, loved the color codes system lines. Ticket machines had English availability which made transactions easy."
,,Cool - Dont eat or drink there,4.0,,very easy to use you need to buy a card (5 $) and to charge it. you pay for every segment according to the distance easy to use. there is a map and people are friendly. many stations will take you almost anywhere
,,Great,5.0,,"Great public transport system. As good as any place in the world. Efficient , Safe & clean as well pretty. Highly recommended for travel"
,,Convinience!!!,5.0,,Awesome connectivity. Just google from where and destination and the mrt transports you in the most efficient way. Children can travel safely and independently. On time and accurate. Clean and tidy. Great experience.
,,Reliable at times but not 100%,3.0,,"Due to lots of testing ongoing during peak n non peak hours. My ranking on its accuracy and punctual drop from 4 to 2.5 out of 5.

Now it's getting very crowded even around 10pm from town back to north area. To make it worst, the route have shorter routes so it's important to read which station will the train terminate ie Yishun, Ang Mo Kio or Yio Chu Kang. It's a nightmare for me when I try to read the monitor that located next to track but only 1 monitor with advertisements screening on it (it's the same display to check when next train arrive and where it end. I find they shd improve especially when we try not queue in the centre cabins (6cabins w total 16doors) when the escalators or lift is.

As long as it doesn't have any technical fault (standard announcement), then it will still be a smooth ride to anywhere around Singapore. It's not a bumpy ride like buses. If the aircon is working, not as chiller cold like some buses. Sometime also cheaper and faster in term of fare and time. It won't have delay from traffic jams unless either train is down. Good to know that when it's down, there are free connecting buses. Question will whether are u able to board as a bus take only a fix numbers of passengers but 1 train with 6 cabins can easily take a few hundreds of passengers at a go during peak hour."
,,the best way to travel,5.0,,it is very fast and quick. and very cheap. it has access to everywhere. very good transportation. many people and tourist travel by MRT.
,,"Clean,efficient,cheap",5.0,,"Purchased a ezlink card from 7 eleven. You can load further $ on at MRT stations. We have been in Singapore for a week travelling all over on MRT and have only used SG $13 each.This has been our only way of transport, other than walking. Easy to plan our journey with all linking train lines written up at station and on trains. Would highly recommend."
,,Perfect,5.0,,Every budget tourist should buy MRT cards. They take you to almost all the major tourist atractions. MRT cards work for buses also.
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Efficient, fast and cheap. It doesn't take long to get used to the system and then it was the most cost effective way to travel around. Future expansion underway will open up further areas."
,,Good,5.0,,Very reliable. On occasion breaks down however overall still good. Very easy to navigate. Recommended to take
,,Most convenient transport,4.0,,"Covers almost all sector of singapore widely. Easily available& accesible for all. Disabled support availavle too. Try to avoid peak time 7am to 9am & afternoon peak 5:30 ro 7:30
It doesnt work all night.. i know it dishearting..Last train leave source station around 11:15 pm.
1st train around 5:30 am. So if planning for late parties , plan accordingly. Currently smrt has 5 lines. Green , yellow, red, purple & blue."
,,Efficient way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,"Very efficient way of getting around Singapore. Inexpensive, reliable, high frequency, very clean stations and trains, and very clear signaling of where you're going plus at each stations, big boards will guide you to your best exit for the sight or destination you're seeking. If you expect quite a number of rides on MRT, go to the information desk at each station and ask for advice on how to optimize your rides. There are different card systems available."
,,Quick to our hotel,5.0,,We arrived in the afternoon at changi. After pick up already looked where we need to depart. Very easy and clean metro system of Singapore
,,Clean easy affordable and 'on time',5.0,,"We were actually going to catch a cab from the Singapore Flyer back to our hotel, but there was a huge que, it was steaming hot and there were no cabs, so, we started walking and came across a bus stop, it was so easy to find which bus we wanted, as luck would have it, the bus came within 3 minutes of us arriving, the friendly driver assured us we were on the right bus, even letting us know exactly where to get off, practically right outside our hotel! It was fast, clean ,efficient, cheap as chips and definitely the way to commute around Singapore, practically every city in the world could learn a thing or two from Singapores MRT!"
,,Great inexpensive way to travel,4.0,,Grab a travel card from the MRT station and go!! Can be used on buses as well. We bought ours and then found out that there was a tourist option available as well. Trips around the city are cheap with most being about $1. Maps are also available but you obviously need to know which station is closest to where you are going. Minimum load amount is $10. Station platforms are pretty well marked and after the first couple of trips we had no issues finding our way around.
,,Excellent Singapore Tourist Pass,5.0,,What is called efficiency is equal to MRT in Singapore. Perfect timing and amazing indications for any kind of directions.
,,Transport as it should be.,5.0,,"One of the best features of travel is its flexability, rail (MRT) bus and even taxis can all be covered with the sqame ticket. So clean, efficient and modern, it is a travellers delight. Loved every minute."
,,Eventually we preferred the bus over the subway,3.0,,"From reading tripadvisor and other sources, my expectation was that we would use the MRT frequently every day to go between different sightseeing stops and home (Fraser Suites). Eventually, we mostly took the bus and the taxi - and this was not just due to Fraser Suites being 15 walking minutes away from the next MRT station. In most situations going from one place to another, Google maps told us the fastest way to go is by bus: the ""good"" routes rarely included a piece of MRT, but always bus routes! And sometimes the auto route was so much faster that we in fact took the taxi (which is fairly cheap in Singapore compared to other big cities). Conclusion: MRT is a fair means of transport for longer distances, but as a sightseeing tourist you should not expect too much of it."
,,Clean and easy to use,5.0,,"Get your visitors pass for 1, 2, or 3 days from the ticket window and don't forget to turn your card back in when done to get your $10 SGD deposit back."
,,A lesson to the World on how to move people,5.0,,"Spotlessly clean, incredibly efficient, fast, easy to navigate. A lesson to so many other cities on how to run a people transport system. If you are a visitor get the one, two or three day pass. Saves money and it's so easy just to walk through the turnstiles instead of trying to work out which ticket to buy."
,,"Quick, cheap & efficient",5.0,,"We utilised the MRT to explore Singapore. It is easy to navigate, cheap and efficient. Very clean too."
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,This is the cheapest way to travel in Singapore. They have tourist pass for 1day/2day/3day which we can use it for trains and buses.
,,Very clean and easy,5.0,,"The MRT system is very customer friendly, but when you buy a standard ticket you can only pay with cash and not with credit card."
,,On our way home,4.0,,Very efficient transport system trains every 3 -5 mins air conditioning carriages. Just a little note the ticket machines only take up to $2 notes an coins they do not accept $5 notes
,,Clean & Efficient,5.0,,"We been in Singapore for 1 week. Moving around is made so easy by the MRT & the connecting bus services. Its hassle free, clean and disciplined in a sense that everyone Qs up. Give their seats away for elderly and parents with infants."
,,Very Easy To Use,4.0,,"The Singapore MRT is very easy to use, and incredible well priced. Off-peak prices are around S$0.80 per adult to most of the inner city areas, so you won't need a huge amount of cash to get around the city. The trains come by every 5-odd minutes, so you're never really waiting. Its a great, clean, efficient system."
,,Easy to use system,5.0,,The Singapore MRT system is so user friendly. We purchased a card at the airport and just topped up as we needed. There were staff members to assist you at the machines. It was such an efficient way to travel around Singapore and took us to all the tourist spots in Singapore. Well done Singapore! On our last day we returned to the airport and were able to go to the customer service desk who refunded the monies on the card very easily.
,,So easy to get to everywhere in Singapore,5.0,,"Plan your trip nicely and this SMRT is very fast in getting you everywhere. Clean, convenient and it's not too crowd. A tip: ignore the rude staff at the EZLink sell counter."
,,"Fast, efficient, clean with helpful staff",5.0,,This is a great option travelling to and from busy traffic areas such as Orchard Rd where it is superior in terms of convenience compared to a taxi. The counter staff were helpful in volunteering and explaining our day pass options and the network itself was easy to navigate and cost effective.
,,One of the highly recommended transport service in Singapore,4.0,,"Its highly recommend to use SMRT service in Singapore as its easy to travel and connects all major cities and attractions.
If you are a tourist you can obtain a tourist pass and enjoy the travelling for a cheaper daily rate based on your stay. for 3 days its just $$D 20 for unlimited rides."
,,On fleek,5.0,,"Mass rapid transport blew me away. At first I was skeptical. Why was a travel system the number 2 attraction in Singapore according to TripAdvisor? Quickly I came to appreciate the wonders of this system. Driverless trains exist in Singapore. People form orderly lines without being asked. I saw only one piece of rubbish and waited a total time of about 6 minutes for trains across three days. The system maps will also give you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside if you look long enough at them, particularly if you find one of the rare geographically accurate maps. Particular highlights included the subtle colour coding system of train decor matching the line colour, the mysteriously uncapitalised 'one north' (why?), the lights showing you which side to exit, and the station called 'Cashew'."
,,Work,2.0,,"Would like the management to consider doing the maintenance at least once a week and in the mid-night. The delay problems have been very often nowadays throughout the lines. This most happened during morning, peak period. Please do something about it."
,,Extremely Efficient,4.0,,"The mrtro system in Singapore is absolutely excellent. The fares are inexpensive, the trains are fast and reliable and frequent. Stations are clean and safe. It has a huge population, Singapore, but though the trains were often very busy, there always seemed to be a comfortable amount of room - I guess because services are so frequent.
It is an excellent eay to get around the city and absolutely everywhere seems to be linked by it. Singapore is so hot and humid and busy with traffic that travelling by air conditioned MRT is a total no-brainer."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,The cheapest and easiest way to travel round Singapore. Need to purchase card upfront then load value as needed. Train maps visible on trains and in stations. Can also use card on buses which crisscross the city
,,The best way to travel around in Singapore,5.0,,It's the best way to travel around in Singapore. But a tourist pass. And enjoy unlimited travel around the country. It's clean. Totally safe even in the night and even when alone. On CCTV surveillance all the time. Very economical. Frequency is very good too.
,,Easy and efficient,4.0,,We were given EZ-link cards by a friend so on arrival at Changi airport and then the MRT station we only had to top up the cards. Very easy system to use and at each station there were signs telling you which exit to use for different destinations. Also a cheap way to get around.
,,Broke down several times monthly,1.0,,SMRT get it together. It's such a disgrace that a public transport can't be reliable. This is Singapore and i felt like i am living in a third world country when i'm in the train.
,,Very impressed,5.0,,Great service so clean and fast an d efficient transport. You can buy a one or two day travel pass and can use it as many times as you like. Its a quick way of getting around
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"This is a great way to get from the Singapore airport to the city or just getting from a to b, fast, easy and non expensive and also very clean. There are ticket offices or staff walking around who are very helpful. Well done Singapore !"
,,Very convenient,5.0,,We used MRT for a lot of journeys during our 4 day stay in Singapore. Tickets are easy to purchase and very economical. Frequency of trains is quick and trains as expected are clean and have air cons. Eating and drinking is not allowed hence the clean trains. They have priority seating for children and senior citizens which I found immensely useful. People were also kind enough to give up their seats when they spotted my folks and my LO. Announcements are made in English along with other languages so navigating your way through the underground is really simple and easy.
,,Efficient,4.0,,Using the SMRT is a great way to get from the airport where there's a stop into the city without the expense of a taxi. The signage is good and the announcements are clear. The only disadvantages are no early morning hours and on weekends and holidays the trains can be quite crowded.
,,MRT,5.0,,Took the MRT from Chinatown to Clark Quay and from Orchard area to the Fullerton Hotel area. Worked great. Very affordable and easy to use.
,,No Fear transport,5.0,,"What a pleasure, clean (no eating on actually station or cart) and logical, with help desks and payment stations easily accessible. Great place to grab breakfast or snack, just finish eating befire paystation as no eating allowed after that. We got a standard card at tge airport as we arrived, preloaded with money and toped up later on our visit....."
,,Easy train system,4.0,,"I find the train system in Singapore very easy and efficient to use. It is always on time, very clean, like the train stations and the maps and signs around directing you are very easy to follow. One of the better ways to travel around Singapore"
,,Excellent service!,5.0,,"We bought the Tourist Pass for 26 singapore dollars for 2 days - return your pass at the end of your visit and receive 10 dollars deposit back. Excellent in every way! We never waited more than 3 minutes for a train. They are clean, fast, easy to navigate and stations are well located for all tourist attractions. Highly recommend!"
,,just do it,5.0,,this system works!! one thing you must know as a tourist; use small bills when you pay at the machine and take a daypass!!!
,,Clean,4.0,,Very clean and efficient to change trains. Only problem is seats reserved for elderly and mothers with babies were mostly occupied by young people and who pretend to be asleep.
,,Mrt eazy,5.0,,This good for near the place helper traveler want you want nice th place n love it the best foreverm
,,cheap efficient and so clean,5.0,,We used the MRT system almost every day - so easy to work out route by using the maps displayed. Even travelled on it to get to the Zoo from downtown although you did have to take a bus at the end as well but a fairly long way and only cost about $2. In 6 days we spent about $8 each. There are also information booths at most of the stations and we only ever had to wait about 5 minutes for a train.
,,"Fast, efficient and cheap",5.0,,"This was our 1st time in Singapore and we were initially a little nervous of the SMRT. That nervousness evaporated after our 1st trip. There are lots of staff around who can guide you to the right platform if you are unsure. Simply tap you metro card as you enter each station and then tap when you leave a station. You even get a read out of how much credit you have left on the card. We used the trains (and a few public buses) on 5 days and it cost us less than $10 each in total. The carriages are driverless and run every few minutes. There are recorded announcements in English of where you are, what the next stop is, when you have to swap to a different line and the various routes eg NS (North/South, Circle etc are all colour coded. Great value and a definite to get around Singapore"
,,Flying Singapore visit,5.0,,"One of the worlds best way to get around any city. Quick, efficient and very very clean. Just what you would expect from Singapore; a joy to use"
,,It works!,5.0,,Dead easy and cheap way to exploring this wonderfully city. Absolutely spotlessly clean.. took us a while to work out journey pricing but easy once you know how. staff are super helpful.
,,Great way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"Cheap, easy and convenient way to get around Singapore. Noisy when underground. Does not run after midnight."
,,Mass transportation that works,4.0,,... for a reasonable price. The only problems are transiting from one line to another takes minutes and long food walks at some stations
,,Most efficient way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore in general is super organized and you would not expect anything else from Singapore MRT. The MRT would be by one of the cheapest way of getting around town; you could walk or race an oBike. During rush hour it would also be the fastest way of getting around. At non peak hours you can save a lot of time if you take a taxi but it will cost you many times more. One notable exception when it comes to convenience is the transfer from the airport; while there is an MRT station at CHANGI is not that easy to get to the city as you will have to change trains.

Other than that, strongly recommend using the MRT when in Singapore.
To make it easy to navigate consider downloading an app such as Moovit to navigate around the city and use the MRT

Enjoy"
,,User friendly,5.0,,"The SMRT as it's known as is the best mode of transportation in Singapore,one needs to buy a flash pay card which is valid for the trains and the buses.
I found it very user friendly and the fastest way to get around in the rush hours.The card costs 5 Singapore $ and the prices are calculated accordingly to the timings."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"Great, sprawling network, efficient, clean and comfortably air conditioned. The staff is very helpful. Remember, NO FOOD OR DRINKS ALLOWED. This has kept the network clean and bug-free (just look at the mess commuters make in the London Underground and Paris Metro!)."
,,Easiest and best way to get around,5.0,,"First thing you need to do on arrival in Singapore is get an MRT card (S$5:00 for the card + S$7 travel total S$12) which allows multiple entries if your are staying for a few days and intend to use the MRT. If not you can also get a single day ticket.
The MRT system will take you to all the major tourist points."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Fast, efficient, easy to understand. One of the best public transport systems there is. Beats Australian public transport by huge length"
,,Rapid,5.0,,"Efficient, on time and fast. Easy to get around. Cheap mode of transport. Interchange lines are easy to identity by the color."
,,"Easy to use, cheap and efficient",5.0,,"Cheapest way to get around Singapore. MRT is so easy to use and cheap i.e. our most expensive trip cost $2.70 per trip! One thing tourists should remember, the ticket machine likes small change so make sure you are prepared."
,,Smooth & reliable,5.0,,"Smooth, reliable, frequent, clean, well-priced. All words that do not go together often when describing public transport. Singapore has got this absolutely spot on!"
,,"Very efficient, very affordable",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT must be one of the best in the world. Wide coverage (being extended), fast, cheap, clean.

The best ticket arrangement for a visitor is the EZ card which costs $12 of which $5 is for the card and $7 for fares. Be warned though that when the stored value gets down to a certain point ($2?) the card doesn't work and has to be topped up (a minimum of $10. This is a nuisance if your'e coming to the end of your visit and won't need another $10 worth of fares.

It is possible to get a refund on the unused balance of the card but we found it more convenient just to purchase a journey ticket with cash.

The MRT doesn't service everwhere a visitor might want to go but taxis are plentiful and cheap by international standards"
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"Best way of transportation , can access every part of the county. Not expensive compared to taxi. Very clean. You can get3 days pass if you planned to use train more frequently. If not one time tickets also available ."

,,Best transport,5.0,,"We got around singapore for 3 days without taxis. It is so efficient, clean and easy to use. I was amazed at how safe it felt to ride these trains. And it is the best way to get to all the tourist destinations. Research the MRT website so you get a good understanding of how it works and what lines go where. It will help when you start off. Also Research THE SINGAPORE TOURIST PASS for the MRT. We paid $20 for a 3 day pass with unlimited travel. We brought ours at the airport, but there are other places in singapore to buy them"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Can't say much more than Easy to use, well signposted, cheap & clean. Tickets were easy to purchase."

,,Best Mode of Transport in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is the best way to travel around. Super efficient and very punctual! When it says, 'The train will arrive in 3 minutes'; it will in fact arrive in 3 minuets!"
,,Daily Commute,3.0,,"As a local we often complain about the frequent breakdown; resulting in additional time taken/required for your journey. In my opinion the NSL has the most problem - track fault, train fault, you name it. And moat frustrating is when the train stalls during the peak hours.

For short distances and/or tourists definitely a good way to travel getting from one point to another.

Just hope this train issues will be fixed soon."
,,Subway excellence,5.0,,"How do you review a train ride or service? Compare it to any others you have been on.

Number 1 is that we travelled on the MRT constantly while in Singapore. Clean trains, great tech with auto doors on the platforms, safe and well serviced by staff.

We used the Singapore Tourist Pass cards at $30 for 3 days unlimited use. Refill / replace the card for $20, and get $10 deposit returned when handing back the card. All up $40 each for 6 days of tripping on trains and buses.

Recommended for any Singapore tourist."
,,"Quick, easy to navigate, cheap",5.0,,"The best way to get around the city and so quick! Tickets are affordable - about $1.50 one way. Like all of Singapore it's clean, well maintained and feels safe. As a young solo traveler I felt totally at ease and comfortable."
,,Super Easy,5.0,,"Super Easy to use and get around on. Trains are neat and clean. Recommend the tourist pass, all inclusive travel for a number of days, made it so easy to get around"
,,Easy and quick,5.0,,"Very clean and easy to understand system, so it’s a good alternative to taxi, grab, Uber, and so on..."
,,Great Public Transport,4.0,,"The little bit we experienced recently was great. Trains were on time. Everything from the platforms, stairs and passages leading to trains, the floors and walls, were clean. The MRT staff we encountered was very friendly and helpful towards tourists. The notice boards and the board/sign inside the train indicating stations and direction and so on is very useful. Although here and there an update is necessary."
,,Fast way,5.0,,A good way to get around fast. The train was clean. Staffs are friendly too. We use it everyday when we stayed here for a week.
,,Good,4.0,,"Singapore MRT system is good to travel around the city but if you want to see city view, bus tour is better. Nevertheless, traveling with MRT is saving time. Note that sometime service breakdown unexpected ."
,,Great travelo,5.0,,"what a brilliant system to travel on. get a pass for teh time you are there, you get a deposit refunded on the cards so endes up being very affordable and train everythwhere in Singapore -"
,,SMRT - A Great Asset,5.0,,"I am a frequent visitor to Singapore and rate the SMRT as one of the best services of its kind anywhere I have been and that includes, UK, Europe, USA, Australia and New Zealand. It's great value. I had credit on my old transit card transferred to a new card on arrival. Very practical way of getting around and minimal waiting for a unit to arrive. Great stuff."
,,Best way to travel SG,5.0,,"Very Reliable, convenient and cheap way to travel Singapore. Secured, PWD and Child friendly and has very short interval of trains coming. Just be aware on staying too long at the stations or else you'll be tagged as overstay ($2 deduction on EZ link). Fine for eating/drinking at the stations and inside the train cost S$500."
,,Very quick easy to get around Singapore,5.0,,The train systems are very quick and easy to get around Singapore and trains come every couple of minutes so you don't wait around to long.
,,So Easy to Use,5.0,,This is the way to get around Singapore. So easy to use and reasonably priced. Colour coded maps and frequent service everywhere. The multi day ticket for visitors was perfect for us
,,Best in the world!,5.0,,"It is Somclean, easy to use and very safe. My teenage boys explored Singapore on their own using the SMRT."
,,excellent,5.0,,"no need to describe how it really helps for commuting in singapore..
it connect almost every places need to go in singapore
from ferry terminal, airport, and ofcourse many other places in singapore

permanent (5 years) card / one time pass, can be purchased near the gate"
,,Take a tour of the suburbs nearest to Changi airport,5.0,,"If you are in transit (2-4 hours) in Singapore, why not venture into the nearest suburb and experience how we Singaporeans live?

Food and drinks are super affordable. For example, board the train at Changi airport, and alight at Tanah Merah (all trains to and from airport stop here). Just cross the platform and take another train into town direction or Pasir Ris direction. Alight at suburbs such as Bedok or Simei where you enjoy local hawker or coffeeshop food (no air con, hence cheaper). The journey will take about 10-20 minutes (depends on waiting time).

Imagine a bowl of noodles for sgd3-4, fresh watermelon juice for sgd2 or less, and a haircut for sgd8. Or, buy a bag of tropical fruits such as longans or rambutans and savour them outdoors? And, try the local authentic nanyang coffee for about sgd1.20 (instead of the exorbitantly priced coffee at Yakun or Starbucks). You can't find these prices and mingling-with-the-locals experience if you had ventured into the city (or concrete jungle). Take the train and start your adventure!"
,,Great system,5.0,,"Very convenient way around Singapore. The fare is distance based and very affordable with many lines criss cross around the city. Trains are driverless and the doors are open and close at specific points on the platform.

Very clean but is crowded at peak times which can go to around 8-9pm at night.

Covers the whole city ad very clean."
,,Easily the best subway system I've ever experienced!,5.0,,"Clean, organized, effective and easy to navigate. The SMRT is probably close to being a perfect subway system. A joy to experience! Make sure you travel using the SMRT while visiting Singapore!"
,,Best around,5.0,,It is so easy if you are from overseas or local got on the MRT at the airport got of and walked a few hundred metres to our hotel all for a few dollars cant beat it
,,Efficient!,5.0,,"The SMRT is fantastic; cheap, efficient, simple to use. Why use uber when you can have such a comprehensive network available to use. Cannot encourage you hard enough to give it a try, you will not regret it!"
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"Would use this instead of the bus and taxi. Very convenient and easy to understand, and cheap too. Topup of S$20.00 for the whole week stay was more than enough."
,,It was as convenient as ever!,5.0,,"Take this option if you've got a few extra minutes available, it's totally worth it! Cheap, fast, convenient and yes eco-friendly too."
,,Super way to travel,5.0,,How all countries should run there transport systems - clean and punctual and get to most parts of the city.
,,One of the bests in South East Asia,4.0,,"It is under the ground and every station is well connected with the adjacent area through a great number of conveniently placed exits. Taxi in Singapore is not cheap. So unless you are traveling in group, MRT is the cheapest way to travel.

Tips: If you have 2 or more people traveling with you, try Grab instead - cheaper than taxi and more convenient than MRT."
,,"""Dummy's Guide"" not needed",4.0,,"The trip was to check it out for use by convention goers to the Marina Bay and Suntec Hubs. Getting to the required locations from the Airport, hotels around the city and shopping areas and tourist attractions was easy. Signposting was so good that it was not really necessary to ask the many helpful attendants present for the best routes. On the few occasions we had to make enquiries we were answered politely and instructions were very helpful. A guide for Dummys on usage of this MRT is not likely to sell well as it is quite unnecessary."
,,Excellence,5.0,,"The transit system in Singapore is excellent. Reasonably priced, clean, safe and convenient, you can't wrong with it"
,,"One of the Best, great connectivity & clean Mass Rapid Transit system in the world",5.0,,"If you have travelled to other cities in the world Singapore MRT system is definitely at the top.
So clean, fast, conducive, so safe and it bring us to almost everywhere within the island. Yes it breaks down every now and then. So what! It happens in most other transport systems in the world. Only thing is its not reported. What's is important is whenever there is a breakdown there is immediate alternative support in the form of providing buses to ensure you get somewhere.
So yes go experience our top notch transport system in the Little Red Dot."
,,Daily commute,4.0,,"Daily commute is very relative to what your individual perspective is and what your point of comparison is. At the end of the day in my view it's about timeliness, reliability and clean trains (and to certain extend level of 'crowdiness'). Having lived in New York, London, Tokyo and Washington DC, SMRT rates very well on T, R and C. At peak hour it can be quite crowded making the trip a bit uncomfortable but by no means unbearable.

For visitors don't expect friendly service at the counter nor helpful SMRT staff assisting you to navigate the system (but then this is Singapore - not necessarily know for its friendliness). However common sense is all that is required and it's very intuitive."
,,Best means to get around Singapore and soon to Malaysia,5.0,,"Quick , comfortable , affordable , clean transport around Singapore
Ample, clear signages near and inside MRT stations. In case of doubt or require assistance, approach any of the friendly staff or the many Singaporeans and people of Singapore and necessary assistance would be rendered.
No traffic jams, occasional breakdowns with free shuttle bus rides made available
Security officers at the ticketing area , CCTV survellance , armed Police officers making arounds vigilantly , First aid trained Station staff ensuring passengers' safety
There are connecting pathway routes to places of attraction, shopping malls, major roads, food outlets. Transportation could not get better than this, in Singapore at least
Efficient, Safe, Comfortable, Easy"
,,The Best Public Transport,5.0,,"I usually drive but am determined to take advantage of the MRT whenever it makes sense. Some recent experience reminded me how much I've missed out on: super efficient, clean and cheap public transport. The station maybe crowded at times but it's cool enough and super clean (it's first class compared to train stations in Australia, UK and US). You never really have to wait too long for the next train. With more and more MRT stations coming up it would definitely be my go to transport when I no longer drive."
,,Very convenient and cheap mode of travel,5.0,,Good connectivity. It has stops near most of the tourist attractions. Easy to buy the tickets. The stations have signages throughout to guide the travel and ease their journey. Superb experience
,,Efficient,5.0,,"If you have used a subway system before then you should have no trouble using it. There people to help if you need it. It is very clean, fast and quick way of getting around city."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,"The SMRT comprises the trains' and the buses'. The efficacy has been praised by many foreigners and Singaporeans. It is prompt, fast, frequent and affordable with travelling comfort of air conditioning. The crowds are controlled by frequent shuttling. A comfortable, convenient and excellent way to travel."
,,Very clean and easy to use,5.0,,The MRT covers the city centre with several coloured routes. Trains are very regular and it's easy to switch lines at stations. You can't eat or drink on the trains and as a result most still look like new. Get a Tourist Pass and you get $10 Back when you return the card at the end of the 2 or 3 day period.
,,"Clean, quiet and comfortable but unreliable",3.0,,"The MRT network is expanding fast. It is a nice way to get from place to place. It is clean due to Cleaners but also rules around eating on trains. Also, gums are not common in Singapore. Compared to European trains, this is very clean, and the ride is fast and comfortable. Everyone is on their mobile devices, so it's relatively quiet, but not as quiet as japan's as people still talk sometimes on their phones.

It is however, getting unreliable and breakdowns happen more frequently now. Despite the government claiming that stats have shown breakdowns are less frequent, me and many others feel otherwise. The mobile network on trains is also unreliable, and some areas have no connection.

There is also a culture of people keeping to themselves, so if you see someone you like on the train, don't start chatting. It can get awkward.

Some stations (eg Raffles Place) are not disabled or stroller friendly as some exits have lots of staircases which is difficult to get through."
,,MRT,4.0,,It is improving. the public should give it a chance to ractify some teething problems.The staff work very hard to ensure a safe and pleasant trip.
,,For lack of a choice,2.0,,"Run by some people who exist in a different reality. Disruptions occur each week, stranding the rush hour crowd"
,,Very efficient and clean service.,4.0,,"For S$4.90, took a return trip from Changi airport into the city (China Town) and back. Only thing travellers need to know is that you can only buy the ticket in cash from a ticket machine, and with a maximum of $10 notes."
,,Quick and easy,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is one of the easiest train systems I've used. They have stops everywhere and are still expanding. Peak times are busy and very cramped, but that's to be expected. Sometimes there are delays in the mornings, but typically it is quick and easy to use."
,,Time to take the 'R' out!,1.0,,"There is nothing RAPID about this system. Trains come at long intervals and are almost always packed. The speed or lack of, which the trains travel at is a laughable. Stations in the tourist belt are kept clean and cool, but those out in the sticks are often filthy, run down with minimum air conditioning even in the searing tropical heat. Please take a good look and LEARN from the excellent public transport in Hong Kong.....Fast, efficient, clean and reliable....now that's what I call 'world class public transport system'!!"
,,Best Subway experience,5.0,,"This is the cleanest, safest subway train I have ever experienced. You could probably eat off the seats. It was very easy to follow the stops and maps. They even had a worker to help you near the entrance to the train."
,,Dream transportation,5.0,,"This transport is a haven for any traveler. It is cheap, fast, convenient, little waiting time and safe. A bit crowded during rush hours.,"
,,Such a great way to experience Singapore,5.0,,"We traveled every where via the MRT as it is so easy to use. It's efficient, orderly, no rushing crowds and spotlessly clean. Maps clearly define all stops."
,,The best !,5.0,,Cheapest and quickest way to get around the City. Always on time and never seems to let passengers down.
,,Absolutely rapid,5.0,,"When it comes to transport, the SMRT is so easy to use and cheap for what it offers. Dependant on how long you are staying in Singapore and how much travel you intend to do by SMRT ,there are many options and savings to be had as some link with the tourist attractions."
,,Super Connectivity.. Very afordable,5.0,,"Took the Singapore tourist pass for 3 days. Got access to Bus, Metro with this card. All attractions are very well connected by Bus & Metro. No need for a taxi at all"
,,Most courteous people,5.0,,"As a resident of singapore for the past 6 years , we have enjoyed the superb utility of MRT and its service and it did strike me when I did get to experience the tube in U.K. We take things for granted .

Singapore MRT is more courteous , on time , efficient , cheap , excellent connections and clear in instructions.With an MRT card any part of the country can be reached with minimal fuss and effort . All mode of transport are air conditioned and all mrt stations too. Best of all it is considered as a continuation of your travel irrespective of which mode you choose to utilise . ( except taxis ).
Coming back to the heading.
Recently I had an experience of an tourist family taking home the full row and were having a great laugh and making fun of the locals in a loud voice . It can certainly Be considered as rude. As I understand the language they were speaking , thought of intervening. In the mean time one of the other passenger in the train politely reminded the tourists on the importance of diversity and inclusion the basic fundamentals on which singapore is built . The best part is he put it in a way which did not hurt the family and did pass the message along .

I did feel proud to be part of the singapore system .

The only way you can feel the hospitality and he welcome news is when you make a ride . Enjoy it ."

,,Very convenient,5.0,,Very convenient and easy to access. Very reasonably priced compared to taxis. Easy to follow maps. Visitors should buy the 3 day pass which is value for money.
,,very convenient,5.0,,We bought the tourist pass for 20 SGD per head. It was valid for 3 days and could be used in any SMRT and selected bus services. I t was a very good deal. The SMRTs are very convienient to travel and the sight seeing places are located near to many SMRTs.
,,bloody awesome,5.0,,This is one of the best MRT systems I have been on easy to use very clean and cheap as chips if your planning on a trip to Singapore buy your card at the airport station on arrival.
,,Just the best way of getting around !,5.0,,"Not cheap and cheerful, but very affordable, very efficient, clean, bright, cool and reliable. The best way to get around most of Singapore."
,,Best mode of transport to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Without doubt the MRT is the best mode of transport in Singapore (taxis are not far behind, but are not a quick) we were in Singapore for 7 days re-charged our old EZ-Link cards with $20 credit , we used the MRT several time each day and after 7 days we both had between $7-8 credit left, it is so convenient, it’s always on time, it’s easy to use and navigate your way in and around the multi-level stations."
,,Singapore at its best,5.0,,"Truly a remarkable feat of human development, not the Sands or the Garden by the bay, the Flyer or Merlion. Singapore is best defined by its AMAZING MRT. Very well connected and very punctual (minor glitches but nothing major). Overall very efficient and you dont need a car if you live in Singapore."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Very well signed. If I can get to a destination any one can. Don't go when it is rush hour, but go and experience it. Good for long distances."
,,One of the Best in the World,5.0,,Singapore MRT is one of the most convenient and simple public transport I have experienced so far. Best is to buy a card and get it recharged with the amount that you would be spending. You will have to deposit SG 5 which is non refundable but you can use rest of the money . Each trip costs less then 1SG and 90% of the attractions are accessible via MRT
,,The BEST inb teh world in my humble opinion.,5.0,,"Staff were without parallel in terms of helpfulness and the locals are just so well mannered and easy to get along with. We used the MRT every day for two weeks,. I cannot fault it at all."
,,the best way to get around,4.0,,"the best way to get to most of Singapore . Cheap , efficient and clean . Easy to understand how it all works ."
,,One of the easiest and best rail systems to travel on whilst in Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT is both fast , efficient , costs are minimal and it is so easy to negotiate any travel to most parts of Singapore
Just find a station , a ticket machine , hit where you want to go , the price comes up and you put in your money.
Trains come and go every f minutes , a fast , efficient , clean and tell you when and where the next stop is.
Too easy, almost impossible to get lost , however , make sure you have lots of small change"
,,Amazing SMRT,5.0,,"Fast, convenient mass transit. Affordable. Best means of transportation in going around Singapore. From my hotel icould go straight to Sentosa via Harborfront Station using the same card. Shopping is easy throug this train, i could go toVivo City, then to Raffles and straight to Bugis Junction."
,,Cleanest subway on earth,5.0,,"Found the whole system beautifully maintained, working exceptionally well, with fantastic signage that was easy to read. There were helpful people to guide us to the right stop—we stopped to look at a map and someone stepped up right away to make sure we knew where we were going. Great. So easy and sooooo cheap!"
,,Really easy to use,5.0,,"MRT is a million times better than Australian train systems. So easy to navigate, really cheap. Everything is written in English so no trouble finding which trains go where with really clear maps. Trains come every 5 minutes or less so you never even need to check what time the train is, just show up and your train will be there in 5 mins or less. I think the longest we waited was 4 minutes which is amazing. Can get crowded and seating is very limited so need to stand most of the time. Best chance of finding a seat is to ride in the end carriage instead of the middle of the train. Get an EZ Link card (similar to a go-card in AUS) to preload currency onto the card and just scan as your enter and leave train stations. Super easy to use."
,,ON TIME ALL THE TIME,5.0,,When every we are in Singapore we use the MRT to explore the city and surrounds. Travel off peak to receive discounted prices.
,,Good but ageing,3.0,,Singapore public transport is definitely one of the best around the region but the MRT has suffered quite a few breakdowns in the recent years. The best possible tip I could give is to avoid peak hours as it has a tendency to breakdown at those timings.
,,The vending machine is so inconvenient,2.0,,"The ticket machine is super slow, super inconvenient, and you have to keep the ticket to use it for six times! There are also insufficient signs in the stations so you often can't find the closest exit to your destination."
,,Best way to get round Singapore,5.0,,This easy to use fast clean transport system is perfect way to visit the sites of Singapore. In conjunction with Singapore tourist card that gives you unlimited travel for amount of days issued is great value. It's also allows you to bypass ticket queues and with a $10 refund for card return is great value
,,Such great public transport,5.0,,"The route maps and visual signs are so clear, there is nothing one can miss. The punctuality is something to experience too. Driver less trains...Fantastic!!!"
,,using the MRT,5.0,,terrific way to get around the city. cheap and reliable. however if you want to go to out of the way places - expect a walk. the singapore government is forever extending the system.
,,Not all location is stroller friendly.,3.0,,Service is ok. They able to maintain the good operation even the station look 'old' and classic. Lift available from platform to the ticket concourse floor BUT most of the location only provide escalators and stairs to exit the station. Hard for us with baby stroller.
,,Easy,5.0,,The plan is to have 8 out of 10 people not to walk more than 10 mins to a train...this means the mrt system works well. Takes you most places quickly and easily. It is cheap and easy to follow though some more cross over a will be welcome. Ticketing is excellent except at the airport. Overall a great public system.
,,"Efficient transport system, cheap as well",4.0,,"The MRT system in Singapore is great. I take it everyday and it rarely breaks down. The trains come roughly every 4-5 minutes during off-peak hours and 2-4 minutes during peak hours. The train carriages are clean and they are pretty fast as well!

The system is easy to use and the different parts of Singapore are very accessible! There are many maps in the stations and in the trains themselves if you need directions. You could also ask the staff for assistance.

The rides are cheap too. A 40min~ journey during peak hour costs me less than $1. Great transport system, one of the best in Asia/the world :D"
,,Fast track,5.0,,Just did one small stretch on the Singapore Metro. Was a breeze and very reasonable. Got from one place to our destination very fast. Picking up tickets was fairly easy. Enjoyed the experience.
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,"Really easy to get around the various lines (colour coded to make it easier) and like all of Singapore, every station is exceptionally clean. Most expensive part is not even the MRT, the Sentosa Express is approx. $4 per adult for a short ride ( which is a combination of the monorail pass and the admission to Sentosa Island)."
,,Fast and easy to use..,4.0,,"If you're about to go around Singapore, then you must try their public transportation esp their MRT. It's fast, clean, easy access and goes to the places across Singapore. Be it suburbs, shopping area, commercials centers or others this MRT will take you there.

Very cheap way to get around Singapore, no hassles, very clean and safe to use at night."
,,Too Easy - Get on the MRT!,5.0,,"Travel in SIngapore is cheap and the MRT is the cheapest of the options.
Getting a card is the hardest part but we found the guy at the ticket desk really helpful.
Then it's simply a matter of deciding where you'd like to go and going for it.
When we arrived in Singapore we took a taxi from the airport into town and when we leave we will be taking the train.
Great value - super clean and really great option."

,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"As my title says, it's a great way to get around.
It took us about 20 mins to work out where/how to buy the tickets plus how the system worked, but after that it was a piece of cake to use.

,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"One of my favorite parts of the trip...taking the MRT! So easy and convenient, no problems navigating the lines. The only way to get around in my opinion. Taking it to the airport was a breeze as well. Opens up right in the terminal."
,,Subway in Singapore is perfect for transportation,5.0,,"As in most cities with a modern subway, it is a very efficient and cheap way of going around the city. Recommended"
,,Fast and clean,4.0,,Very clean and seems new. People from Singapore do give their places for older people and that's always a good signal. Sometimes crowded but not the same as Japan that's for sure.
,,Slow but frequent trains,4.0,,"The trains r using 3rd rail technology. Which mean the top speed is limited. The train is always full during the rush hours, so for tourist with big luggages please try avoid this time. The fare is okay. There are toilet outside the station but not all stations r attached with rest room"
,,One of the best,5.0,,"We have travelled on various MRT's around the world and up until now China has been our favourite but this MRT is an absolute dream. Extremely easy to navigate, regular air conditioned trains and so clean and tidy. Great way to travel around the city."
,,Singapore public transport is amazing.,5.0,,Singapore public transport is amazing. Including MRT SMRT and all other transport. Just buy 3 day tourist pass and then ride as much as you wish.
,,This is amazing!,5.0,,"Everyone on this system were so helpful to two elderly tourists - the whole system is amazing, with spotless stations and concourses, everything air conditioned (Sydney railways could take note of how to air condition underground stations effectively!) and all the journeys were easy to navigate, pleasant and inexpensive. We had to negotiate two different lines to reach our destination and there was always a staff member to help point us in the right direction. AND there were seats to sit on while waiting the few minutes for the next train to arrive - again, Sydney rail staff, please take note!"
,,Best mode of transport in Singapore,5.0,,While in Singapore the best way to move about is via SMRT. It is well linked and supported by the feeder bus if there is no SMRT station at certain places. The ride is pleasant and fast and you get to enjoy the scenery of the city. The fare is reasonable. However you need to plan your trip during the peak hours as the volume of people is huge and you may not be able to get in the train.
,,Not too Expensive yet very Efficiency,5.0,,"The MRT card can be used for both train and bus (for 4 days traveling I bought about $30 card and can travel to most of the places :D) Very convenient and on time !
From the airport you can take the East-West line to get to the city, I believe this is the cheapest way.
Note that both buses and trains will stop after 11h30 so you should pay attention to it. The taxi here is way more expensive and have many types of extra fees."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,we explored all around Singapore using the driver less trains. they are all wheel chair friendly and very efficient and reasonably priced. one downside is the ticketing machines which are very slow. it may be worth considering a daily pass.

,,Still expanding,4.0,,"More stops are still being built. Supposedly should all be done by 2018? The metro runs well and on time. A little confusing at first, but easy to grasp and get to and from places. Have a 1-3 day pass for tourists."
,,transport,5.0,,"bought a 2 day pass for $16sg well worth the money,easy system to navigate ,commuter friendly,best way ti get around"

,,"Clean, and on time",5.0,,Great experience. Highly recommended! Signage in trains and on stations is clear and helpful staff present at stations make this a clear choice of public transport
,,Tourist pass,5.0,,"A great way to get around Singapore, but do the calculations. 3 days will set you back $30 (with $10 deposit refund). Travel is cheap, with short trips around $1. You can also use it to get to Malaysia."
,,Easy,4.0,,"The Singapore MRT is one of the easiest and most organised MRT. The prices are ok (around 1,40 SD), depends on how many kilometer. No trains after 12 PM. That is a bit annoying, because the busses also stop their service."
,,Cool and efficient,5.0,,"Simple, easy to use with excellent air conditioning! Would spent my entire trip to Singapore on here to escape the heat."
,,Used it every day!,5.0,,"The MRT makes getting around Singapore a breeze! Every few minutes a clean, AC train arrives. No pushing it shoving, as everyone is so well behaved. We chose to buy single tickets each journey, and only had to wait more than a minute once to...More"
,,"Fast, cheap and efficient public transport",5.0,,"Probably one of the best public transportation systems in the world. Fast, efficient and clean. You can purchase a visitor pass or just use single/return tickets like I did. It can get very busy during peak times. But then the trains run every 2 minutes...More"
,,Easy transport to my hotel,5.0,,It was very straightforward travelling from the airport to my hotel. I bought a pre- paid card( not the tourist one).
,,The best out there,5.0,,"I've been to several major cities, but I don't think that any of them has had a public transport that was so clean, safe and cheap at the same time. When you chose your hotel, make sure you stay near an MRT-station. That gives you fast and safe access to almost the whole city."
,,Convenience,5.0,,"The SMRT is the most convenient way of transport in singapore. It is cheap, convenient, comfortable and quick. It can get you to any part in singapore. Best way to travel."

,,The best way to roam around Singapore,5.0,,"Fast, Cheap and Best way to roam around the Singapore city. Easy to use even for foreign tourists. Buy a card for 10 cents use it for 3 times, You will get 10 Cents refund. Use it for 6 times, you will get additional 10 cents. Use 6 times in total and throw away the card."
,,Spotless and efficient,5.0,,Makes London's Underground look really grubby. Trains turn up on time and are squeaky clean. Good system that covers every area a tourist might want. Wheelchair accessible. Have coins handy for machines. Offices in stations only seem to deal with longer duration tickets.
,,Great way to get around,4.0,,3 day passes are great value. Very easy to work out which trains to catch and the pass comes with a guide. Escalators are very fast moving which is an issue if travelling with older people. Also very busy during peak periods. A fair bit of walking when changing trains.
,,Convenient!,5.0,,"Used this mode of transport and was impressed. You did not have to wait for too long before one comes along and it is very clean,well signposted and cheap as well. Very convenient and clean as well."
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"This is the most reasonable way to travel around the island. You can buy a visitor pass at several of the train stations, Changi International airport is one and also China town. You can buy a pass for two days three days etc, you will have to pay a $10.00 Singapore deposit which will be given back to you when you return the card. Be aware that if paying by card you will need to use MasterCard as they do not accept Visa."

It's fast, ultra clean, efficient, cheap and adequate covering most of Singapore.
There are more than adequate signs and staff to help you out and maps are strategically placed.
Must try once in Singapore."
,,Best public Transport in Singapore,5.0,,Fast/clean and economical. I suggest using Singapore City Pass which gives you unlimited rides for 1/2/3 days. Otherwise you can easily get tickets (Return also) from station ticketing machine. Watch the map. Stations are announced within coaches. Let the passengers De-board first. Approach each train by diagonally marked yellow arrows in the floor.
,,Systematic & Clean,5.0,,"One of the reason I love Singapore. Beat the traffic, and use the MRT. It is efficient and timely, and connect to almost anywhere a tourist would go. The no-eating policy also meant that the train is kept clean from crumbs and such."
,,It's what public transport should be,5.0,,"Travelled around Singapore using the SMRT and what a delight
Cheap , efficient and clean. No matter what time of day, you don't wait long.
People being courteous all the time is something in this country is the norm, not the law. I am not too old but was offered a seat regularly.

My hotel gave me s $5 transit card and it's amazing how far you travel on that. I would not get 2 small trips back in perth with that"
,,Easy and Cheap,5.0,,Easy and cheap to use even for a couple of older people like us just off the plane. Clean and safe too I'm told.
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Great way to get about the city. Would recommend buying a travel card, either the usual type or a tourist card, but for latter be aware only sold at some stations. Buy at the airport. Trains are very clean, regular and modern."
,,Dont get caught in ticketing confusion,4.0,,"Great system but we were directed by staff to buy cash tickets and these machines are very pedantic in that they will refuse a transaction where they have to give you >$3 change.... Stand there in the queue, search the map for the station, select tucket, stick money in.... Then find it refuses that money because of the change limit. Go to ticket window, stand in queue, get told they can't help you go to passenger services. Stand in queue, get cash changed to lower denomination... Go to ticket machine, stand in queue etc. Altogether we had more time standing in queues than our journeys took. All this and we would have got the tourist card if someone had told us at the beginning!

Sigh."
,,"Clean, efficient,speedy but don't eat or drink on the move!",5.0,,The best way to travel in Singapore. A sparkling clean transport system. Super safe and easy to navigate. Modern & efficient.
,,Best transportation in Asia,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is new, neat, clean, well done, all the best. Easy to go, well instructed with maps and routes indicated in and out of the trains. Lines cover almost everywhere which makes it so comfortable to travel. Best thing: super low cost. From airport to center just costs 3 Singapore $."
,,Awesome way to see Singapore,4.0,,"Quick and easy way to explore! We were walking a lot in the beginning of our trip until we discovered how simple it was to get around using the MRT!

All lines and platforms are denoted by colour and letter - eg. Downtown line (blue) on Platform D for Chinatown.

Ticketing is very simple, there are machines that allow you to use cash and also credit card. Most trips $1.60 one way.

Definitely need to take the MRT at least once while you're here. There are lots of staff around if you need help :)"
,,easy and cheap way to see singapore,5.0,,"from the trip from the airport to the short excursions around the city, this was an incredibly cheap and easy was to see almost everything. One snag of course we needed cash rather than a card. You can get tourist cards of course and temp day cards as well."
,,Wow happened underground,5.0,,It's the best treat an underground can have. I usually scared to the unknown places and very easy to lost the direction and google map is my only friend in abroad. I have decided not to take any form of transportation except cabs. But to my surprise I have downloaded the mrt map and enjoyed every moment of it. If u think u r smart whatever ur excuse is use mrt period. The directions and Color comings are great along with the mrt app. Only thing is the office time business...but where that is absent!!
,,Reliable and often,5.0,,"Great subway station that runs often. Purchase a mrt card so it's easier to go in and out. If you need to refill your card, you will have to pay cash at the counter."
,,Best and cheapest way to get around,5.0,,"The efficiency of the mrt is legendary to say the least. It was great to have a feel of it ourselves when we visited the country for a short duration.
You really don't need any guidance if you need to get around. If you still do, get ready to be overwhelmed by the interest and courteousness shown by the staff.
Both the metro and bus service use the same card. There are apps available to tell you when is the next bus coming and even tells you how crowded they are!
A great asset if you need to see more and spend less. Of course, it consumes a bit extra time, but I think it's worth the bucks you save as compared to the taxi rides."
,,awesome,5.0,,"a huge congratulations for Singapore government for having a convenient ride to all destinations . you may want to buy the NETS card and reload . since you may use it to buy and pay a lot of things . find a map and set a place to go . you may change ur lines and easily access to all station . feel amazes with their service .

i will never forget the dobbhy ghaut station!"
,,The best way to travel,5.0,,"The first time we visited Singapore we very tentatively used the MRT. Wow, we love it. I urge you to really take your time, read the signs around you, you then wont get lost. It shows you the colour of the route, the name, and has arrows pointing you in the right direction. The trains come within minutes of each other. If in doubt we ask someone to point us in the right direction. It also works out a pretty cheap, quick and easy way of traveling around Singapore. We only take taxis from and to the airport now as its easier with our luggage."
,,"Fast, efficient and cheap <3 MRT",5.0,,"The MRT is super simple and easy to manage. Frequent, clean trains make catching the MRT a breeze. Discount rates for early travel."
,,"Well organised, reliable, clean",5.0,,Very well organised and reliable transportation... and yet very cheap. It is possible to use it to and from the airport.
,,Easy to use but not cheap for a group of 4,3.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is similar to the mtr of Hong Kong with very clear indication and easy to find the way for even tourists. However, if you travel in a group of 4, it would be better for you to take a taxi to save both your time and money. There are no children tickets, so kids taller than 90 cm need to get standard ticket like adult."
,,Why can't all trains be like this?,5.0,,"Super fast, efficient and platforms are altars connected to shopping. You can get around the entire island for pennies. Even someone not very tech savy can folloe"
,,Great,5.0,,"Fast, efficient and clean couldn't ask for any easier way to get around the city buy the tourist pass..."
,,Very fast and practical,4.0,,Very fast and practical metro. No need to wait for more then 5 min. Everything is easy and simply for a newcomer. You can get anywhere you want
,,Convenient although needs more top up machines,4.0,,"Great way to get around singapore, some attractions you will need to continue the journey by bus from the metro but this is not difficult or expensive.
We did our first day by taxi and the we did the same journey again by metro the next day and it was a 1/4 of the cost (does take slightly longer but worth it if you want to keep costs down)."
,,Fast and easy to commute,5.0,,The MRT is a great option to commute in Singapore. It reaches most of the key attractions. Buy the Tourist pass of 1 to 3 days to enjoy unlimited rides of MRT and Buses. It is very helpful and convenient. You save money and time.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,Make sure you buy the local transport card and not the tourist pass Local is so much cheaper Was quite upset that ticket offices were not offering tourists the local card option
,,Reliable Transport,4.0,,I have always used SMRT for my transportation in the city. It is a reliable and affordable transport network covering the main shopping areas and all areas throughout the city. You get a discount if you continue the service from train to buses. Payments and services are convenient with the ez card.
,,Great and clean,5.0,,The transit is great and also very clean like he rest of Singapore. Also easy to read transit paths.
,,"Very efficient,time-saving,fastest mode of transport",5.0,,"This the fastest, cheapest and the most easiest way to travel in Singapore I would call it the life lines of Singapore city . if it takes about10 dollars and 20 mins drive in Singapore mrt would cost you 1.50 dollors and half that time.and It's is cheap and very efficient . Also most stations have multiple exits for the roads as well as exits directly connecting to malls and landmarks. It way take a couple of times to figure out routes as there are 3/ 4 different routes but the colour system and announcements as well as self ticketing system with maps option with cash payments is very easy to figure out for tourists and non locals as well."
,,Great network but far too crowded,3.0,,"We frequently visit Singapore due to family commitments. The MRT is a fantastic system and something the Singaporeans can be proud of, However, with each visit we have noticed it has become unbearably overcrowded to the point that we avoid it and either take a taxi or if time is of no concern, we take the bus. It's a shame it has come to this and I hope they sort this out soon."
,,MRT-WCT feel like flying,5.0,,"The world class transport, using millions of people every day, the impression is the clear identification of all the station with light and sound, also the cleanliness of the stations fantastic. The quality target to reach with out any delay with high frequency number of trips will cover the island wide. Also the blind / physically challenged / elders / senior citizens can be reached and out of the MRT with out any stress. i never seen that any other metros. Also the safety doors near the track for all the station is very very good."
,,Efficient and simple,5.0,,"This has to be the cleanest, easy to use and cheapest option of Mass Rapid Transport I have ever experienced! Traveling across the city is way more easier than ever. Stations have maps that show all the routes and stops. Connects most parts of the city with ease."
,,"Convenient, easy and safe",5.0,,"Traveling with SMRT is good and fast. Get a ticket from the machine and you are all set. The system will automatically charge the correct price and let you know when to top up. The trains and stations are clean, and you feel completely safe."

,,Super convenient and Cost effective,5.0,,"- We purchased ezlink card from Changi Airport for MRT and Buses.
- It covers almost every place in Singapore.
- Just pick up the MRT map and get around anywhere you want to go.
- MRT is very cost effective but if there are say 4 of you then take a taxi.
- We took MRT all the times during our last trip to Singapore."
,,Most easiest and Quickest way to travel,5.0,,MRT is so easy in Singapore. From the airport it self you can take the MRT and travel through out Singapore. trains comes within 1 to 5 minutes time. If you are tourist then i recommend the tourist pass which is there fore 1 day 2 days and 3 days which allows unlimited rides.
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Buy a SMRT card for $12 which has $7 credit on it and top up as required. Best way to travel. Used it frequently during our 3 day stop over.
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"We found the SMRT so easy to use and navigate, they offer a tourist pass we purchased a three day pass which allowed us to use all of the train and bus network- stations are so easy to find and once there the directions provided are so easy and staff always willing to assist- they offer a cash back for the card once returned also."
,,Well connected and affordable,5.0,,"The trains are very well connected. The map is essential, but very simple to understand. Also considering Singapore weather, it's a great option for travel as all the trains are air conditioned. Very affordable, I think the maximum we ever paid was $2.20 for the longest trip during peek hours. The stations are very clean and safe, we took train at 12:30 on a weekday and didn't feel unsafe at any point. I would recommend getting a $5 MRT card and u can keep refilling it. The card is valid for 5 years and the remaining balance can be refunded to you at the end of your holiday."
,,Great for travelling!,5.0,,"Really clean transport, fast transit times and a simple line system means that this is a great way to get around the city. Prices are modest, but station is nicely laid out and easy to move around. Would recommend using if you want to explore the city!"
,,MRT includes Buses,5.0,,"I love walking, and there are plenty of places in Singapore that you can walk to and walk around, but with high humidity and warm weather and a need to maximise time the public transport system in Singapore is a must use. It is clean, efficient and easy to use.
Just purchase an ezecard at the MRT station or at a 7eleven or tourist centre. We paid $12 and that includes $7 fare credit. Each ride costs between 80c to $1.87. If you hop on a train, change to a bus and then get on another train it all counts as one fare if the transition takes less than 15 minutes, and with trains coming every couple of minutes that is easy to do. In over two weeks I probably spent $30 max on transport. I would recommend getting a bus at some stage as you can sit upstairs in a/c and get a good view of all the different areas such as Little India, Chinatown etc."
,,Train it everywhere,5.0,,"I can't recommend singapore train system enough; it's fast, efficient and very cheap - and covers everywhere you possibly want to go in the city.

If you buy the top up card; you can use this on the bus system as well. Use your goggle maps to tell you where and when you need to be ready - but this is certainly the way to go!"
,,"Fast, clean and cost efficient travel",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system is fast, clean and cheap. The multiple lines will take you to most popular spots. Stations have maps that show all the routes and stops, so easy to navigate and often much quicker and more convenient than buses or taxis"
,,Cheap & efficient,5.0,,"Easy to read English signs on all maps, platforms and announcements on the trains. Easy to use purchasing machines where you just press which station you want and it calculates the fare. Or buy a travel card that you get your fares cheaper with - I'd suggest this is you going to use buses & trains frequently.
Easy to know when you station is coming up as it's displayed in the train.

When on platforms trying to enter/exit stations they are well signposted to which street etc"
,,Easy! Clean! Cheap! Goes everywhere!,5.0,,"This has to be the cleanest, easy to use and cheapest option of Mass Rapid Transport I have ever experienced! We had 2 weeks in Singapore and used the same system as the locals (rather than the 3 day tourist pass) The system is so easy to use - it goes everywhere you could possibly wish. It's ultra fast and sooo clean! Also as with most things Singaporean everyone is so helpful and polite! Fantastic! We used the MRT constantly throughout the 2 weeks and it cost us $30 each or the entire trip! Use it!"
,,"Clean, safe, convenient",5.0,,"The only way to travel with family. So very impressed with the system from travel card purchase, network coverage, regular timing and the actual ride."
,,Very fast travel,5.0,,Traveling across the city is way more easier than ever. The trains are super clean and fast. The train system is easy to understand
,,Efficient,4.0,,Very efficient way to travel around. Ticketing and ease of travel make it a great way to get around the many attractions. less busy than the Bangkok MRT but as efficient. However if you are very fit and don't mind the humidity you can walk to mosh places.
,,World Class Transportation,5.0,,"The best way to visit most of Singapore's sights & sounds. Very clean, efficient and fairly priced. We really rely on the subway a lot going to various places."

Just a CARD .. tap and get the PPP sound and you can sit and enjoy the cooler air in and enjoy the ride and you will not get lost ... because all station before STOP .. you can hear a sweet voice by telling you your arrival station ... haha .. and as i say before easy like ABC or 123 ..... right ! enjoy the ride and have fun in Singapore ......
,,Good transportation system,5.0,,"It is a common tool for people to take the MRT. The interchange are named as Cityhall, Raffles Place. Other 'Subway' lines are at different stations.

It is cheap and convenient to take a train to the city from the airport if you are coming here for holidays. Unless you coming as a group, a taxi will make more sense.

Trains map are easily found on website and readable. Lines are not too complex to digest. Follow the colour lines, you will not go wrong"
,,"Clean, efficient and very cheep",4.0,,A great watly to get round the city. $12 gets you a card with $7 credit so you don't need to worry about getting exact tickets.
,,Very Convenient to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is very efficient, fast and punctual and the most preferred mode of travel in Singapore. The best way to buy tickets is actually by buying the ezelink cards which can be recharged and encashed back after your stay in Singapore."
,,"To move in Singapore is easy and fast, a rechargeable card is suggested",5.0,,"The public transport in Singapore are fast and cheap, SMRT is cheap and it can bring you to the most interesting attractions, you would not need neither to get a taxi.

,,It's so easy.,5.0,,"We spent 9 days in Singapore staying near Clarke Quay MRT station.
An MRT employee recommended an EZ-Link card as the most suitable for our stay.
It is a reloadable card. Initial cost $12 with $7 loaded credit. Any remaining credit can be redeemed when finished with the card.
We used the MRT every day. It is clean, easy to use and understand with frequent services all day.
Very busy at peak hours but frequent services reduced the problem.
The Stations are massive and all we used had escalators.
We did find some of the stations a bit difficult to find but there was always someone willing to give directions."
,,Best Transport Service I have ever been,5.0,,"One of the Best Transport Services. You can purchase an rechargeable card as a ticket for long time usage or buy a ticket at any MRT station, then recharge it for the ticket price. The Trains are clean and are on time. Well organized stations provide the best to passengers."
,,Buy Tourist card,4.0,,Tourist card cost is 20 USD and 10 USD is deposit(refundable). used in Metro as well as bus. Valid for 3 days but it is good
,,Just works well,5.0,,"We used the MRT system a lot over in Singapore and found it seemless and easy to use.
Follow the map to see which line you need to be on and/or where you need to transfer, go to the ticket machine, select your end point then put the $ in the machine.
Easy.
Just use coins or notes between 10c and $5.
Stations are clean, all have toilets (but remember to collect toilet paper BEFORE you go into cubicle), and many central ones have malls."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,I was apprehensive at first but this is the best way to get around town.. google helps find the correct bus to your destination and correct bus. The drivers were friendly and buses were kept clean.
,,Efficient and affordable,5.0,,"So easy to use, very affordable. Handy app to plan journeys. Very clean and tidy. Never waited more than 10 minutes for any bus. Easy way to get around the city, been here almost 2 weeks and still have $15 on ez-pass despite catching buses everyday to attractions."
,,Great value,5.0,,"If you are used to London tube prices you will love the MRT $10 Singapore for tourist ticket. (About £5.60) its clean and tidy friendly staff. The only odd thing was we wanted a tourist ticket at Farrer station which you get from customer services, but it didn't open until 12:00"
,,"Quick, easy, cheap and organised",5.0,,Once you know where you want to go this was so easy. It was really quick and so well organised and clean. The security staff are more than willing to help you buy tickets from the machine. Would definitely use again
,,Amazing and cheap and reliable,5.0,,"Today, as our hotel reneged on breakfast, we decided to grab a train somewhere new, jump off and find a cheap breakfast. As always, we thought of the train, they're so clean and reliable and refreshingly cool after walking up a sweat. They are the cheapest we've caught anywhere in the world, and so easy to follow. Be prepared to walk, there's plenty of steps between the street and the train but they're amazing."
,,Can be better,2.0,,"Most of the time breakdown, technical problem. It stops at a station for longer than expected. If you are not in a rush that's fine."
,,Just awesome,5.0,,Cannot be complimentary about the system and the helpful staff at the ticket purchasing booths were absolutely awesome. Well done really made life easy for some novice travelers to your wonderful city
,,Great way to get about,5.0,,Fast and easy way travel and get around . Like most things in Singapore clean and efficient . Tourist pass great if doing a lot on hopping on and off other wise single trip card the way to go. Very safe for single travellers and lots of helpful people if you get lost

,,The Best Public Transportation,5.0,,We use public transport every where we go and the MRT is by far the best we've ever seen. We live in Chicago and they can definitely learn a thing or two from this system in every way!!!
,,The only way to travel round Singapore,5.0,,"I'm a hesitant traveller and if I can grips with the SMRT then anyone can!
The system was easy to understand; if you can follow the London Underground you can follow this...and the experience was MUCH better than TfL. Trains were super-rapid in frequency, the stations are wonderfully clean, light and spacious, and the whole thing feels modern, efficient and well-cared for.
Tickets are super-cheap too. Keep your ticket and reuse, by adding more money, which reduces the price of second and third tickets by 10 cents or so. We were not there long enough for a three day pass, but I'd go for this on subsequent visits as this came highly recommended. We only queued once for tickets, at a very busy period; apart from that there were plenty of machines and all v easy to understand and use. Instructions in English available. Follow the rules about not eating and drinking!"
,,Clean and easy to use,5.0,,It is so clear pointed where to go and do transit that there is no chance to get lost. It is clean and comfort.
,,So impressive!,5.0,,"The MRT is such an impressive transport system. We easily got to the gardens by the bay, Chinatown, the zoo(connecting bus), and the shops. Get a prepaid pass so you don't have to fuss with a ticket every time you travel."
,,Cool and fast,4.0,,Don't hesitate to buy an ez link card and top up as you go. This is much cheaper than the $30 three day pass. For two days moving around we spent $8 each. Buses are fantastic and covered by the pass -highly recommend you check with your concierge the best way to get to your destination -MRT or bus as it can save some walking.
,,It saves money and time.,4.0,,"Even though I haven't used this most of the time , I really recommend this. It will save you money as well as time. During office hours try avoiding the taxis. Use MRT instead. Tickets can be purchased from the ticket vending machines. But the ticket vending machines are not convenient as Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok."
,,Can there be an easier way to travel?,5.0,,"Get your ez-link card at the airport or 7-eleven, and off you go! It's cheap, easy to navigate and quick. Even cheaper with off-peak prices after 9am. Top up is available at all stations."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,Had a one day visitor travel pass - saves buying tickets for each trip and very easy to get our deposit back at Changi Airport next morning. The MRT is easy to understand and like everything in Singapore very clean - a great way to travel around
,,World-Class System,5.0,,"Quick, convenient, super clean and does the job it says it does. Inexpensive compared to other systems but delivers so much more than many that I have experienced. The stations are relatively close to each other since SG is a small nation and the majority of stations are well connected to other parts of town that may be slightly further from an MRT station."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"Definitely the best way to travel in Singapore. Fast and efficient. We got tourist travel cards, available from all the major train stations (intersections), it was $30 each with a $10 refundable deposit. It lasted 3 days which was ample for the sightseeing we did."
,,So clean!!,5.0,,"Very simple to use the kiosk to get your tickets, stations and cars are very clean. Cheap and fun way to get around Singapore."
,,"Easy to use, Lots of trains, lots of lines,",4.0,,"We got the 3 day tourist pass. Extremely convenient. Highly recommend. The trains are spaced closely together, so you don't have to wait very long. Trains and stations are clean and safe."
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is easy to use. The stations and trains are very clean and travel is fast and efficient. On a future visit, I would look into getting a tourist pass. On this trip, we purchased single trip tickets. The fares were based on the destination but were easy enough to purchase."
,,"quick, convenient and inexpensive",5.0,,"easy access to the stations, just make sure you carry a route map with you although there are maps on the trains, signage within the stations is a little confusing (I found this common throughout Singapore) but staff are helpful"
,,Best way to get around town.,5.0,,"Easy to use and fast. The staff (and passengers) are very helpful if you are not sure what train to take.

We bought two passes at the airport and used them several times a day. In most cases the trains were not crowded.

They are clean, safe and efficient."
,,EASY,4.0,,There are maps of trains and bus routes. Just follow the colour and line to your destination. Can be crowded at the beginning and end of office hours but not too bad. You can cover the city with ease and also get to outer regions too!
,,Great way to get around cheaply,4.0,,Excellent and easy to navigate mass transit system.When i was unsure of how to use the system there were help counters where i could ask.I used the system to visit tourist attractions without any problem. Then i took the system to my final destination the airport which is easy to get to and since the airport is the last destination on the route there is no room for error.
,,Most efficient way to travel especially for tourists,4.0,,"Singapore MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) system is well connected throughout the island. Journey from Changi Airport to city will take on 35mins. The trains are clean and well ventilated. While most tourist attractions are accessible by MRT, do note there are no MRT near places like the Zoo, and the Bird Park. If your are a tourist, do avoid traveling during peak hours which can be really crowded. Some MRT lines are currently doing some extensively system testing until 4th quarter of 2017. So there has been frequent breakdowns which causes delays. Do factor in delays especially if you are heading to the airport to catch a flight."
,,Dependable mostly and expanding,5.0,,"Dependable most of the time, except there's been a lot of headlines about it breaking down. Crowded at peak hours, standing room space only. Avoid peak hours if you're not in a hurry. Good for watching people."
,,Cheap Fast Quick,5.0,,No need for taxis in Singapore. At least every 5 minutes Stayed near City Hall Station each trip cost only $1.40. Cheaper to buy a single ticket that can be used six times
,,What a great transit system MRT,5.0,,"A not so well kept secret for tourist in Singapore is to take the MRT mass transit system for anywhere you need to go. It is an amazing system that covers almost all of Singapore at a very low price. My wife an I wanted to go to Little India an was about to take a taxi; the gentleman running the taxi stop told us to simple go down the stairs and get on the MRT an we would be their in 10 min. for about $1.50 each way. He was right the system is easy to use, color coded and many of the stations are simply names ie; Little India. Also if you come in into the cruise terminal don't catch a cab the MRT station is only about 100 feet away an you walk to it under a covered parking lot."
,,Awesome MRT,5.0,,Such a wonderful and organised MRT. Best mode of transport if you are in Singapore. Its so well connected to all the places and can be reached easily. The interchange at junctions are very simple and anyone would be able to find the correct route easily although there are help counters for assisting. great service!
,,Excellent system,5.0,,Best way to get around Singapore. Very easy to use and visitor pass good value for money. Gets quite packed at peak times as you would expect.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"The Singaporean MRT system is fantastic and will get you around to pretty much anywhere on the Island.

It's nice and cool, quick and never too packed. There are obviously peak times at rush hour but it's not as crazy as London or NYC.

You can use the gothere.sg lite app to help you figure out how to get where you want to be."
,,Too many breakdowns!!!!,2.0,,"When the system was built in 1986, ride was smooth, pleasant and on time. Now it is often crowded, stiflingly hot with too many breakdowns as a dependable form of travel."
,,Great way to get around the city,4.0,,"We got our tourist pass on arrival at Changi and negotiated our way to our hotel using both train and bus. Great value for money and easy to use. Aircon too!
Our only issue was queuing to get our tourist pass (happened last visit as well)."
,,Super affordable transportation!,5.0,,"Not the fastest transportation I've ever been on, but it did the job and got me from point A to point B."
,,Fabulous and cheap for tourists,5.0,,"Tourists can buy a Singapore Tourist Pass for either one, two or three days, which entitles the tourist to unlimited travel on all public transport, Great way to get around, MRT stations are everywhere and well signposted. Many have escalators and lifts to make getting to the various platform levels easily. Staff are everywhere and often go to assist tourists who look a bit confused. I wish they had such a good public transport system in Australia."
,,Tourist on the go,5.0,,"Train was clean and well maintain,the entire place is clean,staff are doing a good job! Best train i've been too"
,,Good Metro and Service,4.0,,The Metro of Singapore was quite nice as it had very nice exterior and interiors and also a v v decent staff. The people were also very good whom we travelled with as the helped us(tourist) a lot while changing the stations. The train was smooth but not as much as our own Delhi Metro(V Smooth). Seats were very comfortable and we enjoyed the journey and also it connects whole Singapore which is a plus point for the travellers. The ticket was quite cheap which wasnt a hurdle at all.
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,4.0,,The subway is definitely the best way to get around road traffic. Tickets are cheap trains are in perfect condition and on time.
,,Super effecient,5.0,,"Not really an attraction but in 'future world' this is what all metro's/tube stations will be like.. clean, sweet smelling, organised, safe, punctual, quiet in rush hour and air conned.. basically take the central line in London at 6pm on a hot Monday and then imagine the complete opposite and you've got this MRT down to a tee... enjoy"
,,"Wow, what an awesome public transport service.",5.0,,"Cheapest thing in Singapore, easy to use, tickets are easy to purchase, everyone speaks English. Such a polite culture, noone is rude, there's no rubbish, the stops are clearly visable with navigation over the load speaker. Best way to travel in Singapore!"
,,Great service,5.0,,"A must try for any first timer. Very easy to move around. If you buy ezlink card (cost 5S$ each), this can be used across mrt and bus services. Not only that, your money spent on train gets carried forward for bus journey (or converse), if continuing your journey, thereby saving you money."
,,Super Efficient,5.0,,Deciding to use the 3 day passes for tourist which can be used for MRT as well as buses was the best decision i took for my trip - super convenient and cost effective
,,Smooth & Efficient Transport,5.0,,"It covers almost every place on the island and is much cheaper and efficient that even getting a taxi or an uber. They even provide attractive student, monthly and tourist passes that helps you save a lot if you are a frequent traveller"
,,Good coverage but too much walking,4.0,,It has good coverage across Singapore but at changing stations we faced a lot of problems specifically to older citizens. I will compare to Delhi.. trust me Delhi metro will get 9 out of 10 while mrt will get 7.
,,Check out ticket options,5.0,,"Loved the transit but queuing for tickets was a pain. You only get change max of 4usd at the auto machine and you are not allowed to buy from the booth.
Used the pay as you go and you can only add trips not money. You can add a return trip.
To travel like in uk with oyster you need to purchase a different card. It's 12 sgd and I think 5 was credit the remainder for the card which was non refundable.
The trip from the airport to little India was 2.40 sgd one way. We got an uber back which was 14 sgd."
,,The best Train in the world,5.0,,I've visited & use many train service in many countries & cities. MRT singapore is the best. Clean train & right schedule. For toursit use tourst pass. You can use MRT train & bus many times with no extra charge anymore.
,,Fast. Cheap. Efficient.,5.0,,Don't let the underground put you off. It is the fastest and cheapest way to get around Singapore. You put money on a ticket and then on the way out insert the ticket and the gate automatically removes the amount of money for that trip. Easy peasy. It's how the locals do it. Otherwise you will spend a lot of precious vacation time sitting in traffic above ground.
,,"The Singapore Metro is clean, quick and convenient",5.0,,"We were fortunate to be staying a short walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT but the stations are so conveniently located for both the visitor and resident that none is better than another,"
,,Seamless travel,5.0,,"This should be your go-to option for travel in Singapore. Simple, spotlessly clean, on time, predictable. Very easy to get around and the airconditioning makes it a great experience."
,,Easy to use and really clean,4.0,,"Our family used the MRT several times in Singapore and found the system very good overall. We simply brought tickets for what we needed as we went and this worked well. It enabled us to travel economically around Singapore and everything was really clean and well maintained.

The only time we had a problem was at the Marina Bay Bayfront stop when after going to Gardens by the Bay and trying to get home, there was only 2 machines in operation and a queue that took about 40 minutes to get through just to buy your tickets. Once on the train, all good however, this was the only frustration."
,,excellent MRT,5.0,,"its wonderfully constructed covering whole of Singapore, clean and reliable. all of the MRT is underground and even the interchange stations are very well laid out for transiting."
,,How easy!,5.0,,"Got everywhere we needed to go quickly and efficiently. Bought 3 day tourist pass with unlimited bus and rail trips. Only $20 + $10 deposit which you get back. Clean, modern and assessible although be prepared for a walk between connecting lines."
,,Visitors Can Use This Oprio,5.0,,We were back in Singapore and found out about the 3 day visitors pass for the transport system. Great idea. $30.00 dollars for 3 days unlimited use of trains and buses. You get 10.00 refunded when you return the card. This meant we got all around Singapore with no hassles. Highly recommend this as an option.
,,Under ground rail,5.0,,Best way to travel around Singapore very fast service which can have you to any area that you wish tpo go to and cheap
,,Reliable!,5.0,,"Covering large parts of Singapore it is an awesome way to get around. Timely, clean and quick! The prices are good, but avoid it during rush hour."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,Getting a ticket from self serve kiosk is easy and signage great. Clean and seemingly always on time
,,Lousy Transport System,1.0,,"Please stop calling Singapore mass rapid transit as the best or amazing transport due it keep breaking down giving inconvenience to commuters. It's like abusing the term ""world class transport system""."
,,singapore mrt very easy to travel,5.0,,"i have travelled in mrt three times during my stay in singapore,,very convenient and neat clean .well managed"
,,Best way to get around!,5.0,,"Easy, cheap and fast. It might take a look or two on the map to figure out which MRT to take, but once you get the hang of it its super easy. I do recommend this over Taxi.

Just pick a MRT-stop and exit and see whats there, Singapore is packed with different thing, shops and restaurant. Take a chance and see what you discover."
,,nice!,5.0,,"Singapore transport is famous good, clean, and orderly. Easy to access. affordable prices. Train line maps can be easily understood."
,,The SMRT is easy to use - especially cost effective for tourists.,5.0,,"Have been using the SMRT for past six years or so....most stations are close to shopping and a number of major tourist attractions.

Check your tourist map for the line to where you want to go.

Purchasing an EZ-link card for longer visits is cost effective and is just tap on/tap off at stations.

Safety and customer care is a SMRT priority - stations regularly change posters - I saw these today, making me laugh - look where you are going!"
,,Travelling by MRT,5.0,,A pleasant experience: so far I have not experienced breakdowns. Keep it up! The staff are helpful and quite pleasant too!
,,User friendly rail service,5.0,,"Clean,safe (traveled on it often over the years and never encountered any type of problem),extremely easy to access different routes and stations if not actually under tourist attractions then very close to them. Get a travel card and use for buses as well, air conditioned and excellent cheap way to sight see on the top front seat of a double decker. Cards easy topped up at stations. Its also extremely cheap."
,,World Class Transport System,5.0,,"The world class transport system is worth a mention. Friendly people on board, and plenty of space to stand. However, please be aware of the ""world-class service"" that comes along, which includes ""track fault or signal fault"". It will happen at the times you least want it to. They want you to stay in the cabins for longer periods of time to enjoy the facilities, sometimes 10mins, sometimes 50mins. Occasionally you might enjoy the benefits of a sauna, without actually going to one. It's a gamble. Otherwise, it is always world class."
,,Amazing transport system,5.0,,"This must be the cleanest and most reliable underground in the world and have the most helpful staff ever!

At our first station we were a little unsure of where to go and what ticket to buy. The lady in the ticket office was amazing, she spent time with us to explain the ticketing system, advised the best value ticket, highlighted the best stops for our visit and gave us some great advice."
,,So good to experience your trip in Singapore,5.0,,"MRT with 05 lines that could bring you to most of interesting places in Singapore inclusive of Clak Quay, Marina, Orchard road, little India, China Town. No need to take taxi to visit, just take a short walking to go down the MRT station and It transfer you to go any places that you want to visit"
,,Efficient and Effective transport,4.0,,great to cover the distances but if there are say 4 of you then take a taxi as it's about the same price and much more point tompont
,,Crowded,5.0,,SMRT is really a wonder to be built in Singapore. Half of Singapore travels in SMRT. Nice job done by the team. Peak hours are chaos and crowded with people. Worth a ride for its charm
,,CONVENIENT!,5.0,,"I had the 3 days tourist pass so most of the time, if I transfer from one place to another, I always take the train. It is very convenient and covers the city pretty well."
,,"Efficient, modern",4.0,,"Whenever I would google my destination, for some reason, the SMRT did not often come up as an option. Perhaps the places we were going were too far from the stations and the buses offered a better route. But there was one time we did ride and wished that we had done it more. It had what the buses were not: clear about the stops, air-conditioned."
,,"Clean, Efficient & Convenient",5.0,,We took advantage of this complete metro system during our entire stay in the city. Extremely clean and super easy to get around the city!
,,Great way to get around.,4.0,,"The SMRT is a cheap, clean and very efficient way of travelling around Singapore. Like most similar train systems, it takes a bit of effort to get your bearings, to avoid heading in the wrong direction, but I found the staff in the information booths to be very helpful."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,A must for getting around Singapore quickly and efficiently. Prices are very reasonable and with a tourist travel card can be used in conjunction with buses. Any unused money can easily be reclaimed.
,,Holidays,5.0,,"I LURVE Singapore!! :) The MRT is Awesome - great timing, inexpensive, workable, good signage, clean."
,,Efficient as always,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is typically our preferred mode of transport when in Singapore on holiday. Efficient, just like the rest of Singapore."
,,Fun Rides,5.0,,"When you are in Singapore, don't spend your precious dollars on taxi, instead take the SMRT and experience great travel."
,,One of the Best,5.0,,"If only all underground metro train systems could be like this. Relatively inexpensive, clean, air conditioned and efficient. Easy to use with clear maps and signs both at stations and on trains. No food or drink allowed and plastic seats - as opposed to the bacteria and bug infected unhygienic cloth seats on the London Underground."
,,On time,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) is the most popular transportation in Singapore, because this is the fastest way to go anywhere. You may also go to Sentosa Island by using this transport, but you need to stop at Vivo City Mall (Walk or Skytrain)."
,,Very efficient way of transporting people into and out of the city,5.0,,used the SMRT quite a few times. easy to use and very fast and efficient. It is a very quick way to get about Singapore
,,Smooth rides,5.0,,Not crowded at all compared to other cities. Was able to take fairly large bags during off-hours without any trouble from airport to hotel and back. Friendly staff.
,,Wish Sydney trains are the same,5.0,,"We took MRT all the times during our last trip to Singapore and love them. So cheap and reliable. We never scared to miss a train as they are so frequent. The only thing is when we need to change train to different line, the walk can be quite exhausting as the train station is so big."
,,"Simple, Clean and Efficient",5.0,,"Great transit system in this city - we headed to the City Hall station and grabbed 2 tourist passes. For 3 days it cost us $30 per pass - unlimited travel. Before we departed we returned the cards and received $10 per card back - so really it only cost us $20 per card. This system is so easy to use - the signage is in English, the maps are easy to read and navigate to quickly get you around the city. Our wait time was extremely minimal at each station and the stations are so clean. I would definitely use this system again. Great value for money with the Tourist Passes!"
,,Efficient and easy to access,4.0,,"This was a cheap and easy to access transport system. Safe, clean and on time, the trains were the best option for getting around Singapore."
,,"Fast, clean, simple and easy",5.0,,"We bought tourist passes for 3 days during our stay - well worth it. The metro lines are clear and easy to navigate, fast & clean as well.

Lack of trash bins on the stations was a bit off-putting, since trashing is a violation in the city (and you shouldn't eat or drink in MTR), we ended up carrying our trash for some time..."
,,Cleanest transport ever,5.0,,I took the MRT with my 7 yrs old daughter for the 10 days we were staying in Singapore. The transport is super clean (even the public toilets!!) and reliable and cheap. We loved it!
,,Very Good transportation,5.0,,"SMRT is same as Delhi, Mumbai or any other metro city's Metro. But yes it is not that much crowded as we found them in India. Tickets can be bought via vending machines at very cheapest rate. People are very helping to guide you the route and interchanging Metro.
But here also you have to wall a lot while interchange.
Else MRT connectivity to markets and other transportations are very good like bus taxi etc."
,,Excellent System,5.0,,"Greta public transport system easy to use, every 4 minutes for a train, best one I have used. Very efficient and the three day tourist pass is good value."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,A three day 20$ tourist pass is really good value for money. This system takes you everywhere quickly and easily.? There's always a high frequency of trains and the system is straightforward to navigate.
,,Convenient & Affordable way to travel around Singapore,4.0,,"Since the first line - North South line was opened in 1987, it has since added East West Line, Northeast Line, Circle line and Downtown line and more stations/lines are still under construction. There are also 3 LRT line connected to the MRT lines. Every MRT station is well connected with public buses, many of them are also bus interchanges, and connected to shopping malls.

As a Singaporean staying & working in Singapore, I rely on MRT everyday to get around. It is generally more predictable compare to buses which might get stuck in the traffic. However, there had been more breakdowns in recent years due to the aging tracks and lack of focus on maintenance as it is privately owned, and focus more on revenue generating rather than providing services of public good. Fortunately, the Singapore government realised the problems, and had taken steps to rectify the problems including taking ownership of the trains & track, but it will take a while to fix the problems.

Despite these, it is generally very reliable and affordable public transport compared to many other places. The stations and trains are very clean and safe with signboards & announcements in English, Chinese, Malay and sometimes Tamil. All trains are air-conditioned which can get really cold sometimes. All stations are also disabled friendly with passengers lifts available. It is also connected to Changi Airport, providing convenience to tourists. It is not unusual to see fully armed uniformed police officer patrolling the stations and trains, so do not be alarmed.

You can buy the EZ link card, a stored value cash card for travelling along MRT & public buses & use on taxis. It is also acceptable in some stores such as McDonald. There are also travelers pass, which you can get it from the ticket counter. If you are the early bird and want to check out the city areas, tap out of some selected stations in central areas before weekday 7.30am, and you will enjoy a free ride.

I would advice all travelers to avoid traveling on MRT during peak hours, especially if you have big luggage, as the trains are packed and can be very difficult to get in and out. Peak hours are usually between 7-9.30am, 5-8pm during weekdays."
,,Clean and fast,5.0,,Very clean.very fast. Every 2 minutes. All good. The signs are very informative.air condition was good
,,Fast Clean and Air Conditioned,5.0,,"One of the Best Metros I have ever used. Friendly staff, fast and very clean. One of the few places where I actually enjoy taking public transport."
,,Easy transport,5.0,,"Modern Cost effective,easy way to explore Singapore, found most tourists locations near a station and if not bus can be used to get you there. All trains and buses I found were air conditioned cleaner than clean, and local users polite and friendly."
,,A Model Transit System!,5.0,,"ATA's first experience with the Singapore MRT was in 1993! But even back then Singapore was sporting an early version of touch screen ticketing while the rest of the world was still discovering fire! Over the years the island nation has constantly updated and upgraded it's facilities and ticketing technology in order to offer an excellent form of transport that is easy to use.

The Metro has switched from plastic tickets to reusable paper tickets. Each disposable cardboard card can be reused/recharged up to six times. For visitors staying more than just a few days it is recommended to get a reusable passcard that you can charge up and then cash out of when you leave.

The SMRT is extensive and there are still more lines being built. If one combines the SMRT with the bus system there is really no place you can't get to in Singapore using public transit."
,,Small local currency and advantage to travel from Changi to city.,4.0,,ATM at Changi airport supply 50 or 100 Sing dollars. The SMRT ticket machines at Changi do not accept such high value. But at the ticket barrier at the SMRT entrance the person did supply change to smaller notes suitable for the ticket machines. You just had to wait for that person to open his desk.
,,"Cheap, very easy and convenient!",5.0,,Super easy to catch and is a cheap way to commute. It goes everywhere in the city and there's a lot of sign posts so you know when and where you need to be with trains every couple of minutes.
,,Way to go,5.0,,The MRT in Singapore is fantastic. As soon as you get to your station go to the information box and buy a card costs $12.00....$7.00 for the card and $5.00 for travel. When your card gets low you can top it up with more money at any of the machines at the station. You then tap on and tap off same as here. Trains arrive within a few minutes of one departing. The longest I ever had to wait was 8 minutes when there was a problem on the line. They are very clean and fast. Most of the trains line up with the doors on the platform with coloured lines showing you where to stand on either side allowing people to get off easily. In the city all the glass panels go from the ceiling to the floor to prevent anyone trying to commit suicide. The other thing I found unreal was there is no driver....all operated remotely. The majority of the trains start running at 5.30am and stop at midnight. Can highly recommend as very cheap transport.
,,Good for travel,3.0,,"Singapore Mrt is a good way to travel , train frequency are very good but little too crowed during weekend time. It's a best way to travel around"
,,Have seen better systems.....,3.0,,"The trains themselves are fantastic, clean safe and appear to run on time, getting a ticket to get on the system seems not so easy for the tourist who doesn't know way around system. Make sure you have small change $5 and under to feed the machine....the machines are slow and sometimes the lines are terribly long.....maybe we didn't have the in know of how to do better.....most times more simple to just get a cab!"
,,Best in class Transit!,5.0,,"Have been living here for the past dozen plus years. I am car lover and back in India I used to go for long drives but after coming to Singapore while initially I felt that I cannot afford a car but thanks to mass transit system I never felt the need to own a car. 90% of our commute time is using the public transport only. Well connected and highly predictable. Many a times during peak hour mass transit rails are more predictable than a taxi ride!
Sometimes I wonder why still people ride cars!"
,,Model transport system,5.0,,Have stayed in Singapore numerous times and used the SMRT system each time. Easy to manoeuvre and understand. Staff always friendly and helpful. Cheap and reliable....when in Singapore use the SMRT.
,,Great way to move in the city,5.0,,"Clean,efficient,safe,easy to use cost effective...First world transportation service. With stops in the main tourist areas including the airport, Marina bay and the cruise ship terminal."
,,So easy and cheap,5.0,,Easy to negotiate and cheap. A really good local experience. We had no trouble using this system even though it was our first time in Singapore.
,,Clean efficient system,4.0,,"Easy to work out, regular trains on time. Very clean, staff happy to help and offer directions. Only fault would be ticket machines don't take more than a five dollar note."
,,MRTs are the best way to get around,5.0,,The Singapore MRT system is one of the best and it connects the whole island city. It's clean and efficient and best way to travel in Singapore
,,Crowded yet efficient,4.0,,"Coming from Delhi, I've experience in using the metro. Besides I traveled through all mediums while in Singapore,be it bus,metro,Uber cab,local taxi, trolleys,cable cars or on foot. All the experiences were good. MRT has stations all across Singapore,one was near our hotel too, so we gave it a try, it was a pleasant experience as people were very disciplined. To buy tickets,it was automated and people liked standing in queue unlike the situation in india,however I would say the infrastructure of Delhi metro is better than that of MRT, however the ways were convenient to understand and things were comfortable in MRT."
,,"Break down, train fault, signaling fault, delay at most of the peak hour",1.0,,"Singapore mass rapid train (MRT) used to be a very reliable, easy to use and clean. But it was in the past and after upgrading the system, the service is horrible. The trains are very slow, breakdown or delay due to either train fault or signaling fault or both. The worst thing is most of those problems happen at peak hour. It becomes an untrustworthy service. Could not rely on MRT. Please be prepare to waste minimum 20 or 30 mins of your time if you choose to travel with MRT as higher chance that you would be one of them stuck in train fault. They used to be cheap but the fare is kept increasing but there is no improvement in service which is not reliable at all."
,,Excellent. don't take a cab.,5.0,,"Take the MRT. Don't take cabs or ubers, The MRT will get you anywhere downtown at a fraction of the cost."
,,Always on time,5.0,,"This is one of the most reliable train services we have ever used. Trains are always on time, safe and very clean. We used it to move around Singapore during our 6 months stay. Can easily connect with the bus system and use the same card. Very well identified stops and maps in all stations."
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"The MRT system in Singapore is easy to use, inexpensive, and an easy way to travel to all the main areas around Singapore."
,,"Clean, efficient and convenient.",5.0,,"The MRT in one of the best in the world. It is clean, convenient and not too expensive. It is the best way to travel to avoid traffic and their lines are extensive. We went all over city on the MRT."
,,Does the job!,4.0,,Got me around Singapore just fine and failed me only once when it caused me to miss my flight. Although that was mostly my fault.
,,Improvement MRT,3.0,,"Took many years of MRT, better improvement but often have signalling fault and power fault when Tua Links is newly released, often midnight power fault when i got home and delayed for 20 mins and even the next day morning, were travelling to workplace also delayed 10 mins, Try to do improvement during midnight for better for getting complaint from whole residents."
,,Easy,5.0,,The SMRT is very easy to use and cheap. People were very nice that we met on the train. Easy to buy tickets.
,,clean and cool and easy to use.,5.0,,"The subway system of Singapore is an experience in itself. It is so user friendly and what I also liked was the beautiful posters they have for guiding passengers on etiquette. Also, the staff are extremely friendly and available to guide you to your destination."
,,Cheap and efficient means of travel,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to travel around Singapore. The system is easy to navigate and the trains are frequent, clean and comfortable. We found our fellow passengers to be pleasant and polite. When trains were crowded younger passengers very willingly offered seats to those who were older."
,,Perfect,5.0,,"Just perfect way of travelling around. Modern, clean, well described. On time and very good value for money."
,,Beautiful system!,5.0,,"Well priced transportation throughout the City. Clean, safe, and efficient, always a joy to ride. Stations are well kept and tickets easily purchased once you get the hang of it."
,,Singapore MRT Very Good But Can Improve,4.0,,"The Singapore MRT subway trains are always expanding their lines further and further out into Singapore's suburbs. The lines are color-coded with fairly clear system maps and good neighborhood maps at each station.
There are a couple of things which are surprising for a place which values efficiency and practicality as Singapore does. The ticket machines are very slow. And at many stations it is not clearly enough marked which platform to board the train for which direction. This is frustrating especially when you're running to catch a train that's already at the platform and you can't tell if it's the one you want or not.
Some of the train advertisements are pretty amusing. Like the ad for fertility with spermatazoa painted all over the floor of the car!! Very surprising for conserataive Singapore! Lol"
,,Train or taxi?,5.0,,"We used the MRT in Singapore a few times and whilst we going it very efficient, for our party of four a taxi was usually a cheaper and more convenient option."
,,Efficiency,5.0,,"Getting around Singapore is so easy because of their train system. They are clean, fast, efficient, easy to use and on time. Importantly for tourists they take you to most of the usual attractions. The MRT has a free app that can be downloaded. It is very useful when first arriving in Singapore to purchase an EZ Link card which can be used on trains and buses. They can purchased at the airport or many other outlets. Check out their website for more information."
,,Prone to breakdowns,1.0,,"Almost every other week or month, there will be train breakdowns due to signal fault, track fault, sleeper fault etc. There is no end to reliability problems and maintenance is done on a piecemeal basis. If you really need to rush for an important appointment, I would urge you not to take the MRT train as you never know when it will actually break down."
,,Transport at its best...,5.0,,"On time, accessible, and commuter-friendly. Really seperates Singapore to all other southeast asian countries. Well developed, planned and best serves the public. Access to entire singapore is not an issue by using this rail transit. Am sure anyone who will try would agree."
,,Superb,5.0,,"You can't ask for anything better, it is reliable, fast, very clean and has air con. Most return journeys are about $3 to $5 dollars which is really good."
,,Very User Friendly,5.0,,"We purchased the 3 day Singapore Tourist pass. The Singapore Tourist pass allowed us unlimited access to the MRT trains and buses. The trains ran frequently, signage is plentiful, and there is always and agent available to help point you in the right direction. At times, you might get turned around if you are not paying attention as there are several different exits at each of the stations that will put you either close or far away from your destination. Prior to leaving, I downloaded the MRT app which helped to map our days, although the agents in the ticket booth were more than ready to help when needed."
,,Getting around,5.0,,We purchased a 3 day tourist pass. The coloured system was easy to follow. We went everywhere we wanted with ease. The only way to get around Singapore
,,Best way to travel in crowded Spore,4.0,,"With over 5 million population in a small island, MRT will be the best option to get your way around.
The lines are connected throughout the island and you can almost get to everywhere by taking the MRT.
Travel price is affordable and the train arrives on time in a regular schedule. Waiting time is short but be prepared to expect almost full capacity each time the train arrives.
For Tourists, there are packages offered, check with the friendly station staff. Pls note, no eating or drinking in train."
,,Not reliable,2.0,,Breaks down frequently.There is only one line going in one direction. The management should consider a dual line for a route with high volume. If it is always a track fault then that means that part of the track should be replaced.
,,So efficient,5.0,,"The MRT is so Singapore & such a treat. It can take you most places quickly, efficiently & cheaply. A great way to get around with minimum fuss."
,,"Clean, cheap and well organized",5.0,,"Once you get oriented, it is very easy to use de subway system. One can move anywhere in Singapure using the subway. And it is cheap."
,,Break down all the time,1.0,,Seriously Singapore mrt cannot make it . Always break down during peak hour . Always signalling fault . Have no trust in the mrt system .
,,Train fault,1.0,,Almost daily signal fault and causes inconvenience to commuters especially during morning and evening peak hours.
,,Easy to get around,4.0,,"Other than having to wait in line to load up your ticket (yes - your ticket can be used 6 times), this is a pretty good transit system. Its easy enough to hop on the bus or train and get around the city."
,,Never stops :),5.0,,I am in love with MRT just so amazing so fast and easy I have been using it for a while with an app its all easy
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit is convenient, safe, comfortable, clean and economically the best way to get around the city. It is also a cool respite from the mid day heat."
,,Cheap and best,5.0,,The best way to move around with timely transportation... easy to understand and cheap mode of clean and swift transport
,,Too crowded,3.0,,"For such a small city I feel the MRT is too crowded even is not in rush hour. Especially the green old line. But it is clean & cold. No toilet facilities,only certain stations."
,,"MRT IS CLEAN, COLOURFUL & MAGNETIC",4.0,,Travel is hassle free. However beware of delay glitch. Just study the colours of the route and you will have a pleasant trip. Easy to navigate and you can also check with the information counter in all the stations. Last travel time is usually before 12am. So take note of that. One bonus is you can also travel from the airport to the city area and other parts of Singapore.
,,Impossible to get lost if you can read,5.0,,"I do so wish someone from my home town would visit Singapore and learn how to signpost directions for commuters. If you can read, you'll not get lost on the MRT. Yes, it gets very busy at times (well, it is THE main transport for millions of commuters daily) and you can sometimes be cramped in to a train car, but it is as good a public transport system as you'll find in any multi-million people city anywhere in the world, and the trains run every 3 or 4 minutes during the day. Brilliant! . . . However, if you want a more interesting ride, go streetside and catch one of the very regular, new, quiet buses--you see more of Singapore as you're traveling about :)"
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,i have been to Singapore with my 2 sisters and our friend. SMRT took us to great place in singapore. with clearly map in all station made easier for us to reached any place we would visit. i wish my country would have this kind of MRT soonest :-)
,,Really impressed with the MRT,5.0,,Great way to get around Singapore and cheap. Very fast and efficient entry and exit. Australian public transport could learn a thing or two.
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Clean, cheap and efficient way to get around Singapore without any hassles. A fine example of how to run a mass rapid transport system in any city that relies on its transport network for locals and tourist alike."
,,works well,4.0,,Simple and easy to navigate as long as you look at the map. Clean and punctual. take a tourist ticket and then jump on and off
,,Safe and Reliable mode of transport.,5.0,,"When we visit Singapore to look around for foods, tourist attractions and entertainment, the choice of transport is the SMRT. With a valued added card, we travel to any places of choice in a safe and reliable network. Direction guides, train maps are very clear and friendly easy even for the elderly. Avoid the peak hours, your trips will be pleasant and enjoyable. If you the adventuerous, this mrt train brings you from the Singapore airport to your hotel conveniently in air-conditioned comfort."
,,Famous transportation in Singapore,4.0,,"For travelers who are in Singapore, you all must to try this public transportation. Very famous and most used in Singapore. There are 5 lines, those are East Weat Line, North South Line, North East Line, Circle Line, and Downtown Line. Dhoby Ghaut is the biggest station. The train is clean because the passengers musn't eat and drink on board MRT."
,,Worst Mode of Transportation in Singapore,2.0,,"Packed like sardines in a can, frequent breakdowns for the past few months, rising transportation costs... in one word, Unreliable!"
,,Love the MRT - cheap & easy to use,5.0,,"My preferred transport when getting around Singapore ... so clean with many options and many destinations. Each stop has a really well laid out map and timetable. Each stop name relates to where it is stopping so no guessing you are at the correct stop. My big tip - before you do anything get a pass from the local corner stores (that are everywhere) plus you can top up there as well. Saves having to carry coins, as change is not given"
,,Perfect and fast to reach any place in Singapore,5.0,,"Efficient,fast and the easiest way to get round in Singapore, better than any other transportation. It's cheap , very save and clean . Now actually everywhere is an elevator for disabled people and clean toilets. Nothing to complain about"
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"I live in Singapore and have heard of the breakdowns but have never really been impacted by them. With the trains and buses it is very reasonable. Best to buy a card and add value than buying individual tickets. I am confused by those who feel it is overrated. I have used systems in Japan, Germany, US(a joke), Thailand, etc. I think it is great and easy to navigate. I have had a large number of friends come from other parts of the world and find it easy to help them to get places and to explain the system. It is safe, clean and convenient. Yes you can always use a taxi but it is much cheaper and easier to use."
,,Singapore SMRT Travels,5.0,,"Purchase the tourist MRT card when you arrive at the airport,at the MRT station.Cheaper and convenient way to travel in Singapore to various tourist attractions places.Avoid the morning and evening rush hours if you are carrying big luggages."
,,First Class,5.0,,"-Buy the Tourist pass 1.2 or 3 day pass its well worth it, but this can only be bought at certain stations.
-you can go anywhere on the MRT
-Raffles Bay Quay station walkway looks like an hotel lobby.
-there are clean toilet facilities available at all MTR
-some MTR's even have travelators."
,,Horrible slowdown of SMRT train during peak hour for the East-West train,1.0,,Experienced horrible slowdown during peak hour for the East West bound train yesterday. Took me additional 1/2 hour to travel home. Very frequent breakdowns of MRT trains recently making travelling very frustrating.
,,"Night Visit to Kings Park, Perth",5.0,,Thoroughly enjoyed the park in a night visit. This is much better than a day visit because of the resplendent lights perfectly colouring up the city.
,,"Fast, cheap and easy",5.0,,We didn't have to wait longer than 4 minutes for an MRT and during peak hour they are 3 mind apart. Very clean but be prepared to be a sardine when it's busy! The metro stations are clean and well lit.
,,I could eat on this floor,4.0,,"OMG-- the cleanest subway you'll ever see in your entire life. That is worth a trip just to see it. The subway is easy to operate and cheap, much cheaper than a taxi."
,,Mrt ride,1.0,,"Took the train and it was packed even during non peak hours as the frequency was less. Broke down after 3 stations and was stuck in the train without any announcement for 20 minutes, air conditioning was minimal and was stuffy.
Moving off, it was so jerky I almost fell.
Take at your own risk."
,,Smooth and efficient.,5.0,,"Always on time, get a pass and top it up. Travel outside peak hours and you can travel all week. A fantastic system, combined with the bus service. Get the SBS Transit app and you'll know when the next bus / train is due, makes travelling so easy!!"
,,Efficient and not confusing!,5.0,,"At first, all the ticket-business and getting around is quite confusing, but after a couple of trips, it gets easier. I used the Singapore Tourist Pass so that I wouldn't have to worry about my card value all the time and it was worth it for my 4-day trip. Exits are a little bit confusing, but maybe that's just me."
,,Well organised and connected,5.0,,"Its Singapore after all and the MRT timely, well connected, organized and clean. During my trip I mainly used the MRT for my transit needs and I has no issues. The staff very helpful."
,,Our Smrt.,5.0,,"Our Smrt. Clean, smart n safe. Takes you from Orchard Road to
Ulu and back again. Seamlessly.

Smrt is an underground transport network. One doesn't visit it as part of sight seeing but uses it to go places, cheap n free from hassle.

Hence tripadvisor template for Smrt doesn't really work.

Smrt is the means to an end. Not an end itself. Where I m concerned."
,,So efficient,5.0,,The MRT system in Singapore works like a dream. This is as good as Japan or better. So much better than our home town of Sydney.
,,Easy way to around!s,4.0,,"Going your way with the SMRT is easy, fast, affordable and convenience! regretfully they cover not all places, so sometime you need to walk a little and enter a shopping center to get acces."
,,Just love the MRT,5.0,,Living In Indonesia - a highlight of any Singapore visit is the MRT. Fantastic mode of travel. Cheap and efficient.
,,Cheap and Good,5.0,,"Singapore MRT system runs directly from Changi International Airport to City Centre and beyond. There are mainly the EW Line, NS Line, Circle Line and Downtown Line. Travel made easy and cheaper by using a store value card which one card buy from any ticketing counter at any train station. You got rebate to connect only any public buses."
,,Excellent public transport,5.0,,"Easier than the Paris Metro. Trains run every 3 minutes, they are clean, comfortable and cheap. They put Sydney to shame"
,,great service,5.0,,"Great service, so easy to get from A to B, and joins up with bus services. Always some where to get food in transfer depots. Multi pass allows bus transport also ."
,,So effective and easy to use,5.0,,"Was trying to get taxi back to hotel around 8.30pm, could not find a taxi. We gave up and went on MRT, so easy and quick"
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,Great air conditioned travel environment. We stayed in part of city quite a way from station so probably didn't use it as much as could have done.
,,SMRT Service needs to improve on reliability and punctuality.,3.0,,"A convenient way to travel in Singapore but lately too many delays and breakdowns, it is almost a daily affairs. You may wish to try out using the Public Bus ."
,,Our lifeline in Singapore,5.0,,"Quite efficient and effective way to travel in Singapore. All you need to do is carry a good MRT map. Sometimes, there are alternative routes and might be difficult to choose the shortest / fastest route."
,,Very convenient!,4.0,,"Taxi service in Singapore is very expensive. Even a short journey never costs you less than 12-14 S$. MRT, in this regard, is very convenient as well as cost effective. The city is small and well connected to all metro stations."
,,Convenience at its best!,4.0,,"While Singapore is best known for its superbly efficient public transport system of buses, and of cabs that are very economical and available at the snap of a finger, one's experience of Singapore remains incomplete without traveling by the MRT. Totally convenient, enjoyable and a pain free mode of travel, the Singapore MRT should be made part of any itinerary if one wants to truly see every part of Singapore!!!"
,,Problematic,3.0,,"Although the MRT system is generally easy to use and is not too expensive for travelling within the island state, the system is highly problematic and breakdowns are as frequent as you are changing clothes. One would indeed have to be lucky not to be involved in travelling during breakdown time."
,,Easily the most overrated transport system in the world.,2.0,,"For a fair comparison, you look no further to other first-world nations: Japan, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany etc

One important factor to remember is that though similar in global stature, these other nations are hundreds of times larger than that of Singapore, in terms of land mass. And yet, out of the few i've used as examples, only the London Underground(the tube), breaks down more often than that of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system. Breakdowns happen often and are common, which would be fine and understandable, if not for the fact that there's pretty much a yearly increase in cost per trip, for passengers, alongside the standards and service of the SMRT going down with each year.

Japan has their bullet train that defies gravity and travels at a ridiculously rapid speed so as to get passengers to their stops as quick as possible. Switzerland have trains that are clean, just like their cities(don't even get me started on the comparisons of the ""Cleanest country/countries in the world"" because Singapore would definitely not feature at the very Top.

The SMRT would be considered a great transportation system were the fares much lower. The comparison has to be made according to the distance travelled, service provided and the income of the individuals utilising it on a daily basis. It is considered a 'Public-Transport' but isn't completely publicly owned and charge fares that aren't very 'public' that see an increase nearly every year, with standards not being improved or maintained."
,,"CHEAP, EFFICIENT AND CLEAN",5.0,,"This is the best way to get around Singapore.
The system is very efficent, cheap and like all Singapore,clean.
It is very easy to navigate, just follow your tourist map, and you can access all there is to see in Singapore.
Purchase a card and then add $ value to it. Short trips only cost 77c."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,"The train system in Singapore was FANTASTIC. It was easy to navigate. Maps and signs were written in English and other languages. It was easy to load/top off the train card. It was very very clean. The loading and unloading was easy to follow with arrows painted on the floor.
I would highly recommend using the SMRT train system while in Singapore."
,,Daily commute,5.0,,"The cleanest underground network I've been on. Miles better than Paris or London or NY. Tokyo Beats it slightly as they are punctional as well.

Mrt map is clear and logical. Stations have a similar platform layout for up down and lifts between levels. MyTransport app for route planning is very accurate."
,,Singapore MRT system,4.0,,"This must be of the most efficient public transport/mass transit systems that exist. Over the six years that we have been in Singapore, new lines have been added, and more are coming into service as I write (I'm guessing by the end of this year). Unlike Paris or Tokyo, where there are often very long walks between different lines at the same underground station, the distances between the lines are fairly short, most involving going up and down lifts and escalators. The whole system is almost unbelievably clean, largely because no food or drink is allowed, and the public has internalised this, and has also been trained not to litter. It is also extremely cheap -- one buys prepaid cards at MRT stations or 7/11s, and taps in and taps out (the same card can be used on the buses which also have tap-in/tap-out machines). We have lived here quite easily without a car because of the efficiency of the MRT system."
,,MRT,1.0,,Constant breakdown and unpredictable stoppage making trip a hassle. Announcement made but till now no improvement and it's getting worst each day.. travel at ur own risk..
,,Best city commuting service,5.0,,It is the most effecient commuting system in thw world that I have seen. Not very happy with the new coaches though and green line is getting delays quiet often these days.
,,Easy way around Singapore,5.0,,"Easy and quick way around Singapore. Very clean and modern. No rubbish, plastic scratches or graffiti. Station staff very helpful and will come help if you look lost! Best way to use is to get yourself a tourist pass from a MRT station. Not every station sells them, however a 5/10 min ride will get you to one that does. $20 plus a $10 deposit will give you unlimited rides on the MRT and buses for three days. There are one and two day passes available as well ( $10 and $15 plus deposit). You can get your $10 deposit back at the MRT station at Changi airport. If you feel brave you could use the MRT to get from airport to your hotel and back. Tourist passes are available at the airport MRT station."
,,Simple and Efficient,4.0,,"The MRT in Singapore covers almost every inch of the island and will take you to most of the major attractions. The crowd usually isn't too bad, barring the peak hours of 7-10am and 6-8pm where the working adults head to and from work. The MRT is extremely clean and all passengers are advised not to eat or drink within its premises, unless you wish to risk receiving a hefty monetary fine. Train intervals are relatively regular at about 5-7mins, and although train breakdowns are rare, they have been happening with increasing frequency in recent years. With this train system, one can travel from end to end of Singapore within 1.5hours, barring any train disruption."
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,"We visited Singapore for 10 days for a holiday. With some trepidation we bought our MRT cards. However by day 2 we were experts! We could not believe how easy it is to get around Singapore on the MRT. Trains run every 6 minutes and are never late. Everything is well sign posted and everything in several languages including English. And in such comparison to some other countries, the stations and trains are so clean and air conditioned. It is a truly efficient and cheap way to travel. You have to put a minimum of $10 on your card, but a short trip in the city only costs 77 cents."
,,Easy to use and gets you almost everywhere you need to!,4.0,,"Love the Mass Rapid Transit System of Singapore. It is easy to use, it stops at all tourist attractions and even in the heartlands if you want to see what a normal life look like outside of Orchard Road. You get things for so much cheaper in the heartlands too! Best way to get around. It is reliable and frequent. You never need a car when moving around Singapore."
,,Expect delays for the next few months,3.0,,"Due to testing of new system, gotta factor in additional 15min travelling time. Especially during peak period."
,,Best way to move within Singapore,4.0,,Quick and efficient. you can take it to all most every the tourist points. But sometimes the trains and some stations in downtown are expected packed during peak hours
,,Worlds best underground railway,5.0,,"We have used the SMRT many times over many years and always have found it to be proficient, punctual, clean and easy for tourists to use. We rate the SMRT as the best underground railway system of all the cities we have visited."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT),5.0,,"Easy to remember by colours Red for NSL, Blue for DTL, Yellow for CCL, Purple for NEL, Green for EWL and Brown for TL (U/C). All major lines run into the city and suburbs of Singapore easy connected via interchanges and bus networks. Only EWL runs to the Airport."
,,Always spoilt,2.0,,Keep spoilt keep test keep say train ahead is not moving and stuffs. 1 month confirm 1 time so up to you to plan your route. Becareful. Everyday is a worry day if you take trains
,,Best rapid transport,5.0,,"On dot arrival of trains on time, extremely well connected across island. Best mode to reach anyplace within island on-time. All MRT stations are connected with bus stops too.."
,,Christina Ang,4.0,,"Train is clean and service is prompt. However, observed 2 commuters eating on train on different journeys."
,,Clean public transport but totally unreliable and unpredictable like traffic jam,1.0,,"Avoid peak rush hours but if you like to enjoy the ride in a clean public transport, take it during non peak, get a nice seat and enjoy the views and heartland of Singapore"
,,Avoid north-south line and East-west line,3.0,,"These two mrt lines are built earlier and more prone to breakdown. Also, a large catchment of population live along these two lines and the trains are usually crowded. If possible try to commute using the Circle line, North-east line and downtown line. These three lines are newer and less crowded.

If u encounter any trouble and need to provide feedback to the train operator, there is a whatsapp number to solicit feedbacks."
,,Love it. Clean and (generally) reliable.,5.0,,"Good to link with a transport app so you can choose best MRT/bus options. Recommend Citymapper app available for free. If you are around for more than a few trips, get an EZ Link card."
,,New Train on NS Line,4.0,,"On the 8th July, after the 2017 National Parade Dress Rehearsal , I took the train from City Hall and was pleasantly surprised at the live updated panel of each station.
At the coming station,pictures of prominent landmarks were shown and information on which exits to take for nearby places.
This has definitely bring the travel experience to a higher level; information goes the extra mile to help tourists and others who are new to the destinations.

Well done, keep up the excellent service."
,,MRT ride,4.0,,Didn't break down while I was on the train. Broke down a couple of stops after I alighted. Lucky me.
,,transport,5.0,,by far the easiest way to get around singapore so easy to go anywhere and also the cheapest way to travel
,,The transport isn't rapid anymore,1.0,,"The red and green lines, run by smrt, are constantly down nowadays. Further, they have a new automatic signaling system that seems to not detect humans, so the train door closes even when people are stuck at the door. If you must use the train, please stick to down town line, circle line or north east line."
,,As good as Mass Transit gets.,5.0,,"I've spent many years Living in London, New York and Sydney to name a few. Not to mention hundreds of visits to other world class cities. But Singapore takes the prize for the most efficient, cheapest, safest and cleanest transit I've experienced. Oh, I forgot punctual.
The trains are driverless and run every 4 minutes on the dot. So no point rushing for a train theres another in 3 minutes and 59 seconds anyway. The entire subway system from top to bottom of Singapore is absolutely spotless, and that includes everywhere even behind the fire extinguishers is totally dust free.
For business commuters its free before 8am, then jumps to a tiny $1.15 per trip.
Ok, the bad news-you can't drink, eat, spit, fight or rob anyone on the train but thats a good thing. And I've heard local complain that 3 trains broke down in the last 7 months causing a 6 minute delay. Thats a daily occurrence in most cities.
The have added an additional 60 new trains and open several new stations all on the same day last year!
I think the New York Subway and London Underground engineers should come and take a look. Someone got it right."
,,Slow but efficient,3.0,,"MRT is really the heart line of Singapore connecting pretty much all corners. Stations are clean. Card system is extremely efficient. Even though I felt as if it's World's slowest metro railway, I could not complain since it's super efficient. Felt safe as well."
,,SMRt,5.0,,"Best Train system I've experienced. Rains run on time and frequently, very unusual for trains to be any longer than 6 minutes apart and peak times every 2 minutes. Trains are spotless, passengers are courteous and helpful and on a hot day the air con carriages provide relief from the heat. Well done Singapore"
,,Zip around cheaply,4.0,,"Most locals don't have many good things to say about their metro. But I'm not one of them.
The system is 30 years old but looks pretty brand new. The stations are clean and cheery. The trains are always clean, both inside and out.
During rush hours, they turn up every 2 minutes. They are never packed like in Tokyo. People refuse to be packed.
Ok, they do break down every now and then, especially during the current period when they testing out a new signalling system. It's angst for commuters indeed. But we should just bear with it.
And it's cheap. US$2 can take you anywhere throughout the island. That's the max to pay. And includes free transfer to buses using the same credit card-like ticket."
,,"Clean, quick, safe",5.0,,"These trains were quick, safe and exceptionally clean! I loved the fact that trains came every five minutes so that even if you missed your train, the stations provided comfortable sitting areas to wait. the trains always had room for the hundreds that boarded. sometimes a bit squishy but still nice."
,,"Safe, clean and convenient",5.0,,"If you're from most US cities, you will find the MRT a startling contrast from the mass transport you know at home. It is clean, people are courteous (though many are glued to their phones) and you feel safe all the time. The directions in the cars and in the station are clear and very helpful (and in English).

You use a fare card, and you can buy them at the airport from the same shops where you buy SIM cards, or at the major MRT stations. You can add more money to your card balance by machine at any station, or with a human clerk at major stations.

There is no reason not to use this great way to get around Singapore."
,,Usually reliable but signal testing during Peak hours is a pain in the....,3.0,,"I took the first train between Toa Payoh station and Yio Chu Kang station back in Nov 1987 and have seen it grow in terms of both network coverage and ridership.

Generally, it is a fast, reliable and relatively cheap method to get around in Singapore especially if you are a tourist but the recent peak hour signalling test has probably left a sour taste with many.

It still a long way to go to matching (sorry) Hong Kong's MTR in terms of comfort, reliability."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Once you get the hang of the various lines it is very simple to use. Best way to be mobile and avoid the traffic. Recommended more so because of the long wait for taxis in singapore
,,Efficient,3.0,,"As efficient as you would expect any other metro.

Staff are as rude as anywhere else in Singapore and Malaysia. But thats a topic in itself.

Avoid talking or asking for help. Read as many maps and guides as you can before taking your family through the city."
,,Trains are just good fun,5.0,,When you come from a place that doesn't have manu trains then going on a fast system like this is awesome
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,"In our opinion, this is one of the best and easiest ways to get around the city. So clean, convenient and reasonably priced. Good security measures with doors on the platforms which open when the train arrives. Investigate the multiple day passes - it seems expensive but you do get your deposit back which you can claim at lots of their offices or like we did, at Changi airport on our way out."
,,Transport at its best,5.0,,SMRT is the quickest and fastest way to explore Singapore. Tourists can purchase day passes that allow you to travel anywhere on the vast network. More stations continue to come online opening up more places to visit and explore.
,,Cheap and easy way to get out and about,5.0,,"We were staying close to the Clarke Quay MRT station and used the MRT every day to visit the sights and areas ( except for the zoo and night safari)

The lines and signs are so easy to follow that interchange was so easy. The trains came regularly, on time and we're clean and quiet.

I wish we had a system as good as this at home in Brisbane."
,,Clean and fast,4.0,,One of the most good mrt in world. Hop in and hop off. Easy access. Sign everywhere in english. Just follow the color of sign or ask the officer and you are good to go
,,Hats off to the Singapore MRT,5.0,,"We have used the rapid transit systems in several countries but have yet to come across any that is more efficient than the Singapore MRT. True, even with city maps, we often lose our way to the station, but once there, it is a pleasure to queue up with other orderly riders. Like other systems, SMRT riders are so busily using their iPhones that giving up one's seat to the elderly is a thing of the past. One cannot say enough about the shopping and eateries in and around the stations. Another big plus is the presence of friendly MRT staff to answer riders' inquiries. One unfortunate loss is the welcome we used to get at the immigration station; hope it is because the officers are over worked rather than a change of policy,"
,,Gardens By The Bay,5.0,,Well worth the trip out to take a look and tour the two enclosures. A very well maintained and set out garden.
,,Excellent way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Went sightseeing on my own for a few hours on a Friday evening as I was informed that Fridays after work can prove tricky to get a taxi. MRT was brilliant - very frequent service, very clean and excellent customer service (when I needed help to find out where to buy my ticket)."
,,Great system. Tips included.,5.0,,"Used over 5 days. Even from airport.

Very smooth running. Frequent trains. Recommend to get the app.

Husband is a great navigator. I just follow him. He makes everything look easy but seriously he said it's great.

Cheap too. Got cards at the airport upon arrival. Don't get the use as much as you like for set price. We can't figure how one could possibly use the equivalent in credit within the timeframe (either it was $28 or $38 can't recall). We figured out we wouldn't have used it, you'd have to ride the trains all day but hey we're no experts and depends where you're going I suppose.

Hot tip: not only can you top them up with credit, you can use them as a pay method at 7 eleven (probably other places too). So any remaining balance can be used to purchase goods, we got beverages at the airport.

Very happy."
,,A transport system that so many countries could learn from,5.0,,This was a great experience. It's easy to get from one place to another. You can buy your travel card and it deducts the price for you. This is the cleanest underground I have ever been on. You are not allowed to drink or eat ...... which is why is soooooo clean and a pleasure to travel on.
,,It's lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,Just lovely and super professional staff. Amazing instructions and sign boards. Really rapid and on time.
,,Cheap and convenient!,5.0,,Rode this transit a few times to get around the city. Was very easy to navigate and was super clean.
,,"Spotless, efficient, cool, and on time.",5.0,,"It's a great city system for a traveler. Inexpensive, and asy to use and navigate, we saved many hot, humid steps at the end of a busy day. Highly recommended."
,,"Excellent, clean and safe",5.0,,"Once we got one or two journeys done it was quite easy to get about, just take a minute to look at the plenty maps in the stations to make sure you get the right train, all tracks are colour coordinated and tell you what direction they are going in,just get a card at the kiosk and put about $10-$20 dollars on it, that should last a week at least."
,,The best mode of transport with full AC!,5.0,,"We were shopping along Orchard, Dhoby Ghaut and Vivocity. We never even sweat at all as we are always in AC area (ie. MRT Station, Malls & etc). Singapore MRT is one of the safest, cleanest and fastest mode of transport to travel with. From my home Mount Sophia to ION Orchard, only took me 15 min total journey, and cost me only SGD. 0.77/trip per pax.

Well just bare in mind, if you are travelling more than 4 pax, you may want to choose an alternative way to take Grab / Uber, as the price difference won't be too much, and you do not need to walk too far, in addition you get to alight directly at the buildings lobby.

Have a safe trip!"
,,Very Efficient Mass Transport...,5.0,,"When my family and I visited Singapore we manage to move around to the different places from our hotel using only the SMRT, even coming and going to Changi Airport. A very economical and effecient way of travelling ..."
,,The best way to transfer from place to place when in SG,5.0,,"This is the WAY to move from place A to place B. All the traisn are new, clean, accuarte and safe. The signs and guidings are the top of the metros in capitol cities I have visited. This is probably the best metro I have ever used!

I recommend that you buy a ez-link card. It can be topped up, when getting empty. The best thing for a tourist is that if you have extras in your card when leaving the country, you can get everything back when you ask. Just ask from MRT customer service. They will charge for the card itself 2 SGD, but that is peanuts.
I propose that all the european mangers running and operating metro should visit SG just to see how metro can be arranged. This is a benchmark!"
,,"Clean, Safe and Inexpensive Rapid Transit System",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT (SMRT) is an extensive rail network that covers most of the city-state and ties in nicely to an integrated bus system, all air conditioned and impeccably clean. What I like best are the many maps that in the stations to help the traveler decide how to get to his or her destination. Another aspect of the SMRT and larger transportation system is an app one can get free which enables the traveler a way to plot his or her trip to their intended end point. The quality of the SMRT infrastructure are the sleek and well maintained. There are signs which inform the traveler when the trains will arrive. Lines are color coded and everything is well marked helping tourists from getting lost and disoriented.The SMRT is a facility that provides residents and travelers an inexpensive, clean and super safe facility that compliments the Singapore tourist product."
,,High Standard and Clean,5.0,,Really wonder about the service and discipline of the people. And really good Maintenance and standards.
,,Very fast,5.0,,"Train comes every 5 mins! Very efficient, reliable and affordable! Try to travel avoid peak hours as you will get a discount fare if you are using an EZ link card"
,,So easy to use.,5.0,,"We recently visited Singapore & used the SMRT to access all of the tourist spots & local places. We purchased a tourist card at the Orchard Station which had to be paid in cash. It cost us S$20 for 3 days per person and an additional $10 deposit which we got back when the tourist card was returned.

The SMRT was so easy to used. There are maps & signs everywhere which makes it easy to navigate. Trains are frequently arriving & leaving so there is very little waiting. At times the train is really full and we had to stand but this isn't difficult & you are rarely standing for long as at times we had to catch 3 trains to reach our destination. Regardless, trips are fast & efficient. There are escalators everywhere to fasten the process.

Our week of travelling in Singapore consisted of the bus (also included on the tourist card), the SMRT & walking. You can access all of Singapore (including the airport) using these modes of transport. If you plan to use the SMRT, I recommend a good pair of walking shoes."
,,Easy and surprisingly cheap to use,5.0,,"Quick, clean and efficient. Easy to understand the metro map and to buy tickets. Goes close to most places you want especially good to get to and from the airport."
,,"MRT , an easy way to get around Singapore",4.0,,Easy to use and cheap. Very clean trains and instructions are both in English and Chinese. Great way to get around the city and beyond.
,,Clean and convenient,5.0,,"One of the best public transit systems in the world. Very reasonably priced, too. Subways can get crowded. Buses are less so and are quite relaxing."
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Travelling on MRT could not be easier. Stations and trains all immaculately clean. So many trains running, never have to wait more that 5 minutes. Great way to get to outer suburbs of Singapore to enjoy a quieter pace of life than the inner city"
,,Way to go!,5.0,,"MRT is such an efficient and convenient mode if transport. Singapore is continuing to build numerous new stations, extending an already well planned and extensively established transport medium.
Prices are cheap (fair) and easy to work out.
If on holiday, buy a Visitor pass at the Vistors centre (Orchard Rd Somerset), as this is a better value way, rather than buying as you go. Be aware stations don't take S$10 or higher value when buying tickets, however the Customer Service ticket booth can provide you change."
,,Good coverage of Singapore but be prepared for intermittent problems,4.0,,"The SMRT is an inexpensive, quick and reliable transport system to get to numerous parts of Singapore, including the airport, hotels, shopping centres, etc. Of late however there have been intermittent delays on the North South line so look for updates on your smartphone if it is critical for you to be on time."
,,"Clean, safe and easy",5.0,,"Simplest way to get around Singapore. The system of coloured lines is easy to navigate, the trains run all over the city, the pass is easy to purchase and cheap to use, the trains are punctual,run long hours and are clean and safe."
,,Always excellent,5.0,,Compared to most underground systems globally it is always efficient; clean' on time and well managed
,,Excellent Transport System,5.0,,Magnificent train system. Spotlessly clean and so safe. Super efficient. There is always a staff member to help if you have any questions.
,,Great & easy to use,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a well planned network, which is very easy to use. Wherever you are, it very easy to locate a station entrance nearby. Ticketing is easy but some machines only accept small denomination notes for short journeys. Entry and exit is very convenient and having escalators at almost all points. Signage is excellent and so that an unfamiliar person can easily travel."
,,Best way to see Singapore if you are fit,5.0,,"The best way to see Singapore by tourist would be MRT. Better to buy a tourist pass or card as you can preload it and don't need to buy a ticket every time.

Almost the whole of Singapore is connected well and there are trains every 5 minutes so no waiting time too.If you read the map properly you don't need any guidance and can commute from one point to another easily.

You also don't face the traffic problem and reach places quite fast.

The only issue is they charge a fee of $5 for the pass which is non refundable. You can keep the pass for a long time but for visitors visiting Singapore just once the card fees are a waste. Also when you en cash the balance money from the card when you are leaving the country they take the card back."
,,Very convenient if you plan on walking a lot,5.0,,"Very convenient if you plan on walking a lot, as a tourist, you don't need to buy a travel card. Easy to use, it's an experience you don't want to miss"
,,Good way of getting around,5.0,,"Trains are great, stations also good. Been to SIN many times, save some taxi money and get around on the MRT!"
,,"Great, user friendly",5.0,,"The system has only 6 lines, which are clearly marked by colors. The stations have names and numbers, makes it easy to navigate.
Stations have clear and simple signage.
Trains and stations are very clean; food and beverages are not allowed.
Signage on the trains is also very clear regarding the navigation and even what side of the train the door will open next."
,,"Cheap, fast, efficient and clean",5.0,,"To put it simply, it is one of the best performing public transport system in the world. Living in Singapore for over a year now, using it almost daily and except slight hiccups caused by human error there have never been major outage, at least on my route"
,,Its okay,3.0,,"For tourists who don't buy the day or week ticket, buying single tickets is a PITA. Machines don't take CC or $10 bills so you have to line up at the kiosk, which works at the speed of molasses in the winter. They give you change and then you need to go back in line at the machine to buy your tickets.
The trains themselves are clean and modern. But Uber is as cheap as the MTR if you are a family or a group of 3. So it is not really worth it"
,,Best transport system in the world!,5.0,,We got a card and could travel anywhere on the trains. The maps became easy to memorise after a few days and the cost to travel anywhere is minimal. Trains ran every few minutes. Most trains are full at peak times and you generally stand up. The underground networks were easy to navigate with multiple entry and exit points. Intuitive system that seems to run so well with the minimum of staff. They have my vote for the best transport system in the world.
,,A for effort.,4.0,,"It's got it's up and downs but overall a good system. Afterall, it's public transport and it's just trying to cope with the new masses of people in Singapore.

I just wish that they would make the Aircon stronger. Not necessarily colder, just have more ventilation fan blowing."
,,What they say is true,4.0,,"fast, efficient, clean, easy, etc etc. Everything a small mass transit system is expected to be but often isn't. Take a minute to study how the system works and then jump on."
,,Really nice and convenient,5.0,,"Spend 4 days in Singapore and used transit extensively. The tickets are not too expensive. A big plus, you use the same ticket seamlessly between the 2 subway companies."
,,Unreliable,1.0,,"packed to the gills. if you enjoy paying high ticket prices, stuffy aircon, stuck for hours, go have a ride."
,,Best transport system in the world,5.0,,We had an MRT card each and travelled all over the city for 4 days. Very cheap and definitely the way to go if you want to get around quickly. Trains come every 5 mins so hardly any waiting around. All air conditioned and comfortable. Crowded at peak hours but it goes so fast you aren't on it for long.
,,Singapore holiday,5.0,,We decided to brave the SMRT and found it very cheap and user friendly. Even with changing trains. You can purchase reusable tickets or an ez link card that you can use on buses as well.
,,MRT is convenient and reach to every place in Singapore,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is very good, organized, comfortable and timely in operation. MRT is an important transportation there and can reach / pass almost everywhere in Singapore. For the new visitors there is quite easy and understand in using the MRT facility is due to the plan at each station."
,,Easy and good value,5.0,,"You can easily purchase a reusable card with your first single trip, and top it up as required from the station vending machines. Average trips around centre of town $2. Frequent services, well sign posted and extremely clean.
Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
,,excellent service!!,5.0,,singapore mass rapid transit was excellent experience. good service.any one can go all attractions by this service.
,,"Outstanding Transit System, these people have got it figured out!!",5.0,,The MRT coupled with the bus system HAS to be one of the finest in the world. You can get almost anywhere you want/need to be quickly w/o worrying about the traffic on the surface roads. Signage is good and frequency is very good!
,,Great MRT,5.0,,"We stayed at my friends place in Serangoon Central in Singapore for a few days and we were very close to MRT. We find that their MRT are excellent. We were able to go to Sentosa Resort, Marina Bay sands, China town and other places using MRT. What I notice is that there is always mall at the MRT, so shopping is very convenient here. Its fast but crowded.
All in all, very organize."
,,One word superb !! well connected and Rapid !!,5.0,,MRT is a bliss in singapore to travel anywhere its well connected and easy to go anywhere. Maintained quite well and stations are awesome and trains always on time
,,Cheap Way of getting round the city,5.0,,"We used the MRT most days to get round the city. The SIN MRT App was really good to plan journeys.

When we arrived we bought an EZLink card from the MRT station at the airport. it was $12 $5 for the card (non refundable) $7 credit. We then just topped it up as and when we needed it. This was much better value than a tourist card.

The trains ran every few minutes so we never waited long, it was clean and easy to use."
,,It just works,5.0,,"Cant fault it... east to use and navigate, easy to pay for, meticulously clean and reasonably priced"
,,"Clean, reliable and cheap",4.0,,"I purchased an EZtrip card which cost $12 ($5 for card plus $7 credit for travel). The card can then be topped up with credit as needed but $7 will get you to a lot of places. The trains are clean, regular and the system is very user friendly."
,,FAIRLY GOOD,4.0,,I'm only talking about the trains; I don't care for buses.I like the SMRT; it's fairly easy to use. Slower than I would like but decent. I wish they had late night and early morning service. The really cool thing is that they go to the airport but they don't open early enough to get you to an early flight.
,,Very cheap and easy to understand,5.0,,"Definitely worth buying a pass. Only stayed for 4 days but the pass made travelling so much easier. (Can be used on busses too). Very easy to understand, hard to get lost. Lots of people around to ask for help if needed. Very quick, clean and cheap."
,,Excellent way to see Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is safe, clean and a great way to see all the sights of Singapore. It is reliable and comes every few minutes. Best of all it is so cheap. Airport to Clark Quay for around SG$1.90"
,,One of the best,4.0,,"SMRT is one of the best in delivery public train at reasonable cost. My only complain is the 1 day pass, why does it end at midnite? Why not 24 hours like the european system? We pay for 24 hours and should get accordingly."
,,World class,5.0,,"Public transport in Singapore is fast, clean, safe & reliable. Easy to use. Buy a card & tap on & off. Trips are as cheap as 77cents. Most trains are 2-7 minutes intervals ."
,,Tourist pass is a saviour !!,5.0,,this is the cheapest and fastest mode!!! take the tourist pass for $S30(10 is refunded at surrender)...the city is well connected by the MRT web..easy to use as the map is very helpful..tuk shops within the stations are convenient
,,Sensational!,5.0,,"Absolutely brilliant! Cheap, efficient, reliable, clean, well maintained - everything an MRT system should be. Would highly recommend it. Very well signed and easy to navigate even for a first-timer.

We bought a 3 day tourist pass for $20 which allowed unlimited travel on buses and MRT but I hindsight probably would've been better just buying and loading up a regular EZ-link card as fares are so cheap."
,,Informative and easy to use for tourists,5.0,,"If you came to Singapore.. Don't be afraid on how to go to place to place.. You can take MRT.. It connects you to everywhere you want... But you have to save your energy because you have to walk.. From one station to another station..

They have map Everywhere.. Also sign board and information on the train.. So you won't get lost...

Just prepare your coin or max 10 $singapore.. To buy the ticket...
Your single ticket can be used for 6x times...

The train is comfortable... Clean and cool.. Don't forget don not eat and smoke on the train.. Is prohibited...

The train also connect you to the airport..

Enjoy the trip..."
,,Strange that this is considered an 'attraction' but it is the best way to travel around Singapore,4.0,,"The MRT is an easy and cheap way to get around Singapore, the route map is really clear and easy to follow (signage in the stations is exceptional, you won't get confused/lost). The system is usually very efficient, it is air-conditioned, clean (due to the no eating and drinking on trains or in stations rule, which is a brilliant rule), it goes right across the City to most destinations that you would want... (you will need to get the odd taxi/bus at the moment to get to some destinations) and for those destinations that it doesn't reach yet - it is being updated with new stations and routes."
,,"Clean, on time, straightforward...",5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is super clean, cheap, offers frequent services and is fairly straightforward to navigate. Definitely a great option for getting around Singapore."
,,Highly efficient way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is an extremely easy and very inexpensive method of travel around Singapore. Most trains come in under 5 minutes and everything is very clean. If you are not used to crowds, the MRT can become crowded during peak hour (6 to 7pm)"

,,SINGAPORE MRT,5.0,,"Best and cheapest mode of transportation in and around singapore. if anybody gives a proper thought for 15 mts he can understand the total route and methods of singapore metro in minutes.And the best part is it is connected to changi airport also.There are 4 main line yellow, purple,red,green.All the sightseeing points are on yellow line.Once you alight the train there's a map drawn above each door which anybody can understand easily. So no need of wasting money on taxi. Same way the bus transportation is also very easy. one has to download the HOW2GO app when in singapore. This app immediately helps us to travel in a very very easy language."
,,transport facilitate the poeple,5.0,,"one of thing that i like from singapore is the transportation which they have.
there are SMRT and city bus that so comfortable to board.
it has many access to tourism places and shoping places.

If this isn't enough the three day unlimited travel tourist pass makes it a breeze to use. Of course you can walk between the attractions but the heat makes this a bit uncomfortable. Cabs can be somewhat time consuming but the SMRT is ever reliable,
If you plan on spending a few days in Singapore get the SMRT tourist pass and have an enjoyable and hassle free trip/"
,,So easy to get around!,5.0,,"Singapore is so easy to get around. Thanks to the amazing MRT. It just goes everywhere and a station near anywhere you would want to go. The carriage are clean and passengers are courteous. Next time, I might buy the proximity card thing."
,,The best way to get around,5.0,,My wife and i purchased a three day pass for $30 each. You get $10:back on the card. The MRT is the easiest way to get around Singapore. Highly recommended
,,Best Transport System,5.0,,This transport system is the best I have used in 8 countries - it stands out by far. Very Clean Quick Responsible priced
,,Very neat and timely,5.0,,Metro is linking all the important locations. Routes are clearly mentioned and ticket vending machine is very easy to operate. Information desk is easy to approach and very supportive.
,,Very convenient and simple to navigate,5.0,,Forget how all the ingrates call this a 'third world' system. Every metro has its breakdowns and Singapore's MRT is one of the best in the world. They are very easy to navigate as there aren't many stations in little Singapore and all you have to do is purchase an ez-link card to get around every nook and cranny in Singapore.
,,"Cheap, efficient , clean and great value",5.0,,"Get the Singapore Tourist Pass for one, two or three days. Unlimited travel on MRT & buses. The system is colored coded and stations are numbered . Everything is highlighted on the train at each stop when on board."
,,Great transport system,5.0,,The MRT is a great transport system that gets people around efficiently. Easy to use once you get the hang of it and gets you to just about all the tourist attractions.
,,Convenient,5.0,,Singapore MRT is a great convenience to everyday commute. Travelling through MRT was a great experience !
,,easy to use,4.0,,"easy to use easy to get around convenient and not that expensive

you have to buy tickets and if unsure you can ask the staff who are friendly to help

its busy but you get to travel like a true local and its gets you out of the heat

recommend using this if you wish to see a few different places"
,,A means to an end,3.0,,"Some cities have transport systems which are themselves iconic or a reason to visit (think of the Tube in London as a classic example, but there are others around the world). The Singapore MRT isn't one of these.
What it is, though, is very efficient - although it can be crowded or delayed at times - and blessedly airconditioned in a very hot climate. Additionally, the stiff fines for eating, drinking or littering in the stations (we're talking several hundred dollars) make it a very clean transport system as well.

There are certain areas of the island - notoriously the east - which aren't well-served by the MRT at the time of writing, but even this will change as new stations and lines are commissioned. Singapore is scarily efficient at planning transport, and if one visits after a couple of years, everything's even easier to get to."
,,Simple and well planned,5.0,,"The MRT is the lifeline of Singapore for most of the people use it as a means of transport.The officials at the MRT are very helpful one of them told us to buy the easy link card and told us how to use and top it up.
Since we were staying at hotel Destination 700 beach road the nearest MRT was Nicole highway.
This is a very reasonable affordable and easy means of transport.
Things to remember do not eat or drink in the MRT for heavy fines are imposed .
Do not carry flameable goods otherwise a fine of 5000sing dollars will be imposed.Please be patient while boarding let the people disembark and then board it."
,,Super easy to use and cheap,5.0,,"An incredibly user friendly, cheap, and clean way to get around Singapore. Think you can get a special visitors pass just ask at ticket booth and they will help. Kids under 7 travel free but will need a ticket of their own if over a certain height just ask at the booth but you will need to show them a copy of their birth certificate. They were happy with a photo from our phone for this."
,,So easy...,5.0,,"A city with vision shows what a mass transit system should be. Cheap, convenient and simple to figure out. And the cleanest transit system I've ever seen. Signage is easy to understand and they are very clear at impressing courtesy on its patrons. Quite possibly the best transit system I've ever experienced."
,,Super easy,5.0,,"Singapores MRT is very easy to use and passenger services are always there to entertain your questions. Tips for tourist, best to get a Singapore tourist pass card valid for 3, 2 or 1 day unlimited use for bus, mrt and lrt. You'll save a lot more time rather than lining up getting a train ticket and looking how much the fare is from one place to another."
,,Train ride,5.0,,"Just hopped on the MRT and went wherever it took me. Fansinati g to get out of the city and see where a lot of the people live. It is also very good for getting around inner Singapore, it's cool, fast and efficient."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,The mrt is the way to get around in Singapore! Really easy and fast just like the underground in London only a whole lot cleaner and safer!
,,Excellent way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"The tourist pass is not available at all stations so first thing to do is to get to one that does. You can then ride anywhere and everywhere depending on how long you pass lasts. The cars are air-conditioned. clean and often cramped. Very seldom did we sit and not once did younger people offer us their seats, which was on one of the ""must do"" pictograms on the coach walls."
,,The very best transportation,5.0,,"Very informative If you want to stay long, I suggest to buy MRT card so u don't need to refill all the time"
,,Superb,5.0,,"Best way to travel in spore!! Easy n comfortable! Efficient!! It's not expensive , it's clean ! Great connections!!"
,,Singapore is very easy to navigate.,5.0,,Easy fast and affordable option to navigate the city . We used this and taxis to get around - can't remember if we tried Uber.
,,Clean and cheap.,5.0,,MRT very clearly detailed and easy to use to travel virtually anywhere around Singapore but note changing from one line to another may require some walking so if you have trouble with walking take note.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"We used the MRT during our visit to hop between the different areas.

All signage is in English and it is easy to find your way around.

We purchased a $12 card which worked like an Oyster card. Journey costs are minimal.

Although taxis are cheap
The MRT is a good alternative and easy to use."
,,One of most effective MRT system I had ever experienced! Great jobs!,4.0,,"Just few lines, but will take you to most of the interesting spots in Singapore Island.
Enjoy the ride, the fee is really reasonable. Enjoy them. End of line, it is famous and well-planned Singapore famous public housing project (Pungool line), Worth the try, seeing Modern Harbor front, then also have a chance to know their recent housing achievement."
,,Hassle free,5.0,,I traveled in Singapore SMRT quite a few times during my visit. Number 1 - it's quite economical number 2 - it's quite easy and convenient for even foreign tourists. Tickets can be bought either from the windows or auto machines. As a tourist one should avoid travelling in peak office hours as it's almost impossible to find seats during those times.
,,Perfect Way to Travel in Singapore on tight budget,4.0,,"SMRT is the best solution while traveling in Singapore that you don't need to spend lots of fortune on transportation to get move. I love how they manage and show the route info that feels not confusing for those who use SMRT for the first time. SMRT is also very convenience because some of the stations are integrated with malls or community places. It's a big achievement in cutting down transportations cost by using SMRT.

However, SMRT should not be distrupted in some parts because it's vital transportation for locals and tourists.

Recently on Wed, 28/06/17 around 17.00, I was trying to going back to my hotel in Chinatown from Jurong East via Outram Park. Suddenly, there was an info that East-West Line service was distrupted. I couldn't catch a train from Jurong East to Outram Park as the packs of commuters were stranded in the Jurong East station."
,,Easy to travel by smrt,5.0,,Buying tickets and travelling in SMRT is very easy and hassle free. They have very user friendly automatic ticket dispensers and have many language options. They are super fast and have very wide coverage.
,,Efficient,5.0,,Very convenient and efficient . Make sure to pick a hotel close to an mtr station for which this station will be the gateway to the whole of Singapore. They don't charge for children under a certain age.
,,"Easy to use, inexpensive.",5.0,,"The staff at the station were very helpful to the foreigner who had no idea where she was going! He gave me very clear instructions and the rest was easy. The voice over tells you very clearly which is the current stop and then which is the next one and then just in case you missed it, there is also a very clear digital sign which shows you which station you are stopped at and which one you are approaching. Well done MRT!"
,,Zwoosh - you are there,5.0,,"Singapore metro is very convenient and fast way to get around town. Depending on destination you may have to walk once you get out. (Botanical gardens could have a little more public transport taking to account fair distance to orchid gardens and humid conditions). Once you get a ticket and learn to navigate line changes you will explore Singapore in no time at all. It may be a little crowded at peak times but the locals show a fine example, simply join the crowds!"
,,Only smooth in certain timing,1.0,,"Take the train only after 10am and before 5pm on weekdays. The rest of the timing will be a nightmare when using this transport, especially the red and green lines.

Terrible stopping system was being deployed recently, every stop seem like an emergency brake, passenger must be careful."
,,Excellent Connection,5.0,,"SMRT goes every where in the city and runs throughout the day. Lot of interchanging stations ensure that even if you forget your destination, you are not late and will reach in time. If visiting Singapore, SMRT should be used, in my opinion over taxi service for sight seeing and even going to Sentosa also as it goes till Harbour Station and from there take Free Shuttle Service for Sentosa. Make sure, if you are visiting Singapore for 5-6 days, to get a SMRT Pass made to save on travel."
,,Very convenient even for a tourist like us..,5.0,,"MRT reaches across the country. The schedule is very on time, the cleanliness is amazing, the signs are very clear in every station as well as inside the MRT. Two thumbs up for the Singapore government"
,,Simples,5.0,,"Does not take long to get the hang of this, clean and fast, go anywhere network. Inside screen tells you where next stop is. Pay for ticket cash or card, swipe on entry to station and when exiting."
,,One if the best publi transport systems,5.0,,Simply the best and ever improving. If you have ever used public transport in any developing nation it would take you minutes to figure out the MRTs in Singapore. The fastest and most valuable for money means of transport..The connectivity to airport is awesome and I used it extensively during my 5 day stay in Singapore..
,,Extremely clean and reliable.,5.0,,The SMRT is by far the cleanest I have seen or traveled on in my travels around the world. A pleasure to travel this way!
,,Fastest and the most efficient way to travel in Singapore!,5.0,,"Any place I travel to I like to walk a lot as one explores the city better that way. And that's exactly what I do when I'm in Singapore. But then there are places which are a little too far to go walking, then the brilliant SMRT comes to your rescue.

Singapore is an expensive place, and so are their taxis. But the SMRT is cheap, efficient and most definitely the fastest way to travel. It's very clean and comfortable and you'll always find space if you're a solo traveler. And Singaporeans are nice people so you can just strike a conversation with anyone.

Take SMRT. Have fun!"
,,The best in South East Asia,5.0,,"I might give thumbs up to Singaporean Government for conceiving MRT at the first place. Apart from the excellent transportation system Singapore has built, Singapore MRT definitely gives me and the family an inspiration of how developed countries do all the thinking and execution."
,,Faultless!,5.0,,"Easy and efficient..simple to navigate your way around maps and buying tickets. Fast, clean and cheap way to travel around Singapore."
,,So easy,5.0,,"Australia could really learn a thing or two about competent public transport. The MRT is designed so that if you miss a train, you only wait another 3 minutes for the next one. There is no ability to jump on the tracks (like idiots in Oz do) as there are glass doors that open with the train doors. There are specific rules of conduct regarding the use of the MRT that everyone follows. I was blown away by the generosity of the locals telling us to sit down with a small child - this seldom happens in Aus. During peak hours where there are literally hundreds of thousands of people using the system, everything flows so smoothly and the system just simply works. A similar distance from Roma St to South bank for example, in Aus, per adult is around $3.50. In Singapore, that distance is 0.77. We used it non stop for a week and spent about $40 all up. We would have gone broke in BNE if we used the train service there over that distance. The maps are really easy to follow and we did not once have any issues."
,,Indeed a Mass Rapid Transport,5.0,,"Having traveled most of the metro city in the world, I found Singapore's transport infrastructure to be the best,economical and well networked and integrated as well."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,"Clean, easy to use and cheap. Make sure you have $5SD or less to buy tickets as the machine does not accept larger notes"
,,Best system ever,5.0,,"Amazing transport system. Cheap, efficient, fast and has stations at nearly all the attraction and malls. Good signage and helpful locals makes getting anywhere simple. Ask your hotel for the Singapore concierge Map which is brilliant for planning travel on the MRT system."
,,All Transit Should Be This Way!,5.0,,"Cleanest mass rapid transit transportation I've ever experienced. It's a cinch to get to where you are going. No pushing, no shoving, no bodies smashed like sardines."
,,Fastest way to travel in singapore,5.0,,I bought a tourist pass and traveled in Singapore using MRT and buses. But MRT's are the greatest mode of travel with ease and quickly. It was my first experience but it's not hard to understand the system and the maps. MRT maps are displayed in MRT stations and also in the train. So you never get lost. Announcements are made in the train when arriving a station and where you should change to another line. Get this experience as it is one of the best mode of transport in Singapore.
,,very good,5.0,,"people are very helpful and kind. its very clean , very comfortable for solo travellers . very safe ."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"So easy, cheap, fast and clean. Although taxis are cheap, some will still try to get you to visit a shop first. Use this and get to where you want to go."
,,great train,5.0,,"a really good way to see the city, you can buy a $20 pass for 2 days which is really good value. train are fast and tidy"
,,Easy to Navigate,5.0,,I have used it many times and recently I was in an area I was unfamiliar with. Truthfully I was lost however I just walked about 600mtrs and picked up a sign pointing me to the MRT. It was one of the newly added links and as usual once on the station the directions of the whole network is easy to read. Navigation made easy for idiots.
,,Clean but super crowded,3.0,,Avoid rush hour - mornings and evening. Otherwise it is a great and relatively cheap way to get around. Trains and stations are clean to an extent you need to travel to Japan to experience better/cleaner trains - I rank Japan higher though.
,,The best transportation for me so far,5.0,,"We travel with 2 young children and 3 elderly. The routes are easy to understand, train is clean, fast, always have somebody stand up give seats to elderly and young children."
,,A tourist stop...trip in itself,5.0,,"Extremely clean and modern

Well greased operating machinery unique to Singapore style

As a tourist, it is an indispensable way to get to see the city, it being a tourist stop too, and a nice way to beat the heat too with its air-conditioned trains and take a breather en-route to your next destination (when not peak hours)

Accessibility for physically challenged

However, lately affected with regular delays, alas, frequently during rush hours, as it upgrades and expands its network"
,,beware the breakdown,3.0,,"efficient but recently keeps breaking down. even so, still sort of works. better than most other countries though."
,,Top railway.,5.0,,There are several lines crisscrossing Singapore and they are very clean and efficient. No food or drinks are allowed on the services. You can use the MRT to reach just about all activities and shopping malls.
,,"Efficient, green, clean and on-time!",5.0,,"Wonderful commute daily in Singapore with the SMRT! No paper tickets sold or used, you must purchase a card and load them with credits. Cheap transportation with efficient stations and processes. Always on-time and grants access to almost all of Singapore! I use the SMRT all the time. Cheap and easy to use."
,,"Easy , Fast and Efficient",5.0,,"One of the best ways to travel in and across the City of Singapore is to use their MRT . With their efficient services, and widespread connections between the different lines , one does not save only the money spent but saves the time too while traveling large distances."
,,So slick....,5.0,,"Good value, loads of trains and totally air conditioned. Worth spending the odd half hour on the MRT just to cool down. Lots of staff around to help you but it's a simple system with a very clear map. Much cheaper than a taxi."
,,The best MRT / subway system in the world,5.0,,"This is by far the safest, cleanest and most organised public transport / subway system in the world. It is extremely cheap to use and the trains and platforms are all air conditioned and trains run precisely to schedule. Being underground they also help give respite to the heat and humidity. The ezylink card is easy to purchase from a MRT station office and lasts for years and is easily topped up when your balance gets low.
Station entry points and line changeovers are well sign posted both on and off the train. Staff and locals are friendly and helpful if you need any assistance and also people on the train are generally highly respectful and orderly. Recommended as the best option to get around Singapore (far better than taxis) and you also get a feel for the local way of life."
,,If can avoid morning and evening peak hours,4.0,,"Best way to get around Singapore as it is cheap for longer distance. If there are 4 person in the party and you want to travel short distance, just use grab/uber"
,,The best,5.0,,It is a very convenient mode of transportation in Singapore. They are always clear with the rules and regulations. It is also very clean.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Originally we planned to use the hop on hop off bus to see Singapore in the limited time we had until we discovered the tourist pass available for the public buses and trains. Instead of paying the higher price it was $10 for unlimited travel for one day and $16 for two days. You do have to pay a $10 deposit for your card but get that back by returning it to a MRT station ticket office. You do have to plan a bit more carefully but you can use it at night which is not an option on the hop on hop off bus. The trains and buses are clean and run regularly and the locals on board are especially helpful. A much cheaper option.
,,"Reliable, cheap, fast and clean",5.0,,"Why would you travel any other way in Singapore? At about $1.50 for a short trip it unbelievable value. Easy to use, and everyone is so helpful if you need some advice along the way"
,,"Haha, you're going to be taking one.",3.0,,"In terms of lines to use: Downtown Circle North-South (new carriages!) North-east East-West. Either way, they're public transport- going to be used by everyone, so might as well see how it is! Pretty cheap compared to other cities too, and comparatively clean."
,,"Clean, organised, efficient and easy to use",5.0,,"I travelled alone to Singapore for the first time. I wasn't confident I was going to be able to work out how to use it to get around. I was pleasantly surprised by its ease of use. I got a 3 day tourist pass but I'm not certain if I would recommend it. It's convenient but I needed to buy a ticket to get to a station that issued the pass ( not all do). Whilst I used it a couple of things need to be kept in mind. Firstly, by the time I found the station to buy it at it was 2pm. The first day of use starts once purchased/used so therefor my first days use started with the first train I caught after that. So effectively it was a two and a bit day pass. Secondly, they say you can get a $10 deposit refund at the end. But, I never got round to doing that because I think it would have involved using up time I'd rather be spending seeing other things and I imagine many tourist don't. The MRT itself was very well organise and easy to use. Trains were clean and regular. You are not allowed to eat or drink at stations or on trains."
,,Serves most city places and very convenient,5.0,,"Other than peak hours rides are comfortable, convenient and takes you to most places including the airport. If you are on vacation and have time to spare always worth a try....so as to beat the regular car traffic."
,,Best way to travel in singapore,5.0,,"Public transport in Singapore whether it's bus or train is just awesome. Very convenient and affordable . We used it a number of times.

Small tip: if you are a family of 3 or 4 and your destination requires you to change bus or train consider taking a taxi ."
,,delhi wali feel,5.0,,"MRT is a very good option to travel in singapore. but as it is fully underground there is a lot to walk to catch one metro to another... if a group is travelling please preffer taxi ( grab , uber etc) but for solo traveller MRT is the best mode to travel everywhere in singapore"
,,Cheap and easy way to travel.,5.0,,"I love the Singapore MRT, it is cheap and easy to use. Train times are great and seemingly always on time. With a map of the stations moving around is a simple process. Some research is needed to workout which station is the one for some places of interest but the information / passenger service offices will help you along the way.
Travel cards can be purchased at 7-11's and the tap on tap off system in easy.
If you haven't tried it, give it a go."
,,The best in the world,5.0,,"This is such an efficient and easy to use system. We visit Singapore each year and keep our ezylink card from year to year. Clean, safe and cheap, we love it for exploring all that Singapoe has to offer. Every year we find a new extension and places we can explore
We were here on the public holiday for hari raya and eid elfitri this year and the trains just came thick and fast, responding to the increased demands. Congrats to Singapore for such an efficient, userfriendly system of transport. No need for a car, unless of course its a Mercedes or BMW lol"
,,Super Fast !!!,5.0,,Ride ourselves with the SMRT the whole singapore stay. So fast and Affordable. Very polite staffs. Also the whole station is clean. So reliable.
,,"Reliable, cool and cheap",5.0,,"Whilst taxis are relatively inexpensive in Singapore: the SMRT is even cheaper and very reliable. It is particularly useful for any trips from the airport to the city.

Beware of rush hours were finding a place to stand may be a struggle ... ordinarily don't expect a seat"
,,Confusion!!!,3.0,,Found it very confusing catching a train from Jurong back to downtown.The system of ending services and bouncing between stations caused us abit of grief. In saying that we are new to it so probably just us.Very Affordable and fast (Coming from Melbourne)
,,Below average,3.0,,"there's only a few lines, so easy to read the map. However, unlike other countries, the train ride is shaky and with constant screeching sounds, the crowd is rather diverse so it's very noisy and boisterous .. people here seem to lack manners and would rush in at every station instead of waiting for others to get out .. seems reliability is an issue given the local news"
,,You cant beat it......,5.0,,"Getting around Singapore is easy, fast and cheap as chips. Anyone can use this Rail system without getting confused. If look lost and confused so many locals will ask if you need a hand.
Sometimes I have waited two or three minutes for a train. I dont even use the rail network in Perth. Compare to the MRT in Singapore the trains in Perth are like horse and buggy. The MRT is clean, fully air conditioned and fast.
When in Singapore dont go past this experience. It shows off what all rail systems should be."
,,Great value,5.0,,Travelled everywhere on this - cheap and clean. Buy a tourist card we travelled for 8 days on MTR and buses and only spent $12.
,,One Of The Best In The World,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is simply of the best in the world. It is CLEAN, reliable and a great value for money, and takes you just about everywhere you need to go. With the new tracks they are now building it will get even better in the future. It is a great way to get around a great city."
,,Inexpensive travel,5.0,,If using MRT invest in a card. $22.00 upfront which gives you $7.00 to use. Reduces the cost of trip by half. $10.00 top up at a time. MRT go to all locations and new station to open soon at Fort Canning Park. We used it to go to all locations during our stay
,,The best way to move around the city,5.0,,"Fast, clean (no eating or drinking allowed on trains or stations) and convenient. It pays off to get yourself an EZlink card that can be topped up - fares are lower than when you buy a single-journey ticket. It's hard to get lost too, there are maps everywhere."
,,Easy,5.0,,"If you know where you are going to, can read and understand their routes then you are good to go. Was barely 3 hours in Singapore and we rode one with connecting trips and did not get lost."
,,Could be better,3.0,,"If you're planning to explore Singapore, learning how to take SMRT is a must. Head to any of the station and ask for tourist pass to get discounts and unlimited rides."
,,Smrt is best,5.0,,Mrt and buses are good mode of transport and sg transport is the best if u visiting Singapore u no need take more taxi just use mrt u can reach all u r destination very easily
,,Safe and easy,5.0,,"Buy a three-day pass, making sure to return the card at the end - you'll get the deposit back. And if you choose a hotel on the green line, getting to it from Changi airport will be a breeze."
,,Amazingly fast travel!!!,3.0,,1 station to another one takes up to 2 mins only! It is much faster than most cars in Singapore. Great to travel!!!
,,"Almost like our Metro in Delhi, but very fast",5.0,,"It shows that they care for environment, our standard paper ticket was also capable of re-use and we got discounts on 3rd & 6th use."
,,Excellent,5.0,,Used this extensively. Very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I would recommend to use this to get the feel of Singapore. The MRT premises and the trains are very clean.
,,Brilliant and easy,5.0,,"This is about my fifth trip to Singapore and the first opportunity to use the MRT ... SO easy to get anywhere you need to go, quickly and on time. Unlike trains back hone, no graffiti, people are courtoeus to each other and the whole system ran like clockwork. MRT staff were helpful as were the locals if we looked remotely confused! Would like to be able to buy a day pass, but didn't seem to exist, but happy to be corrected here. Why catch a cab when this goes everywhere and cheaply, too."
,,Best Subway,4.0,,"The Singapore SMRT is far superior to others in the world, especially the London Tube or the New York subway."
,,"So easy to use, AC, and inexpensive",5.0,,One of the best city metros - with clear instructions and clean. AMEX not accepted. Many English speakers so easy to ask for assistance. Be prepared to have your large bags searched for security reasons by the metro authorities. You'll need to open the bag for them - please be patient and kind.
,,Amazing public transport ....,5.0,,"We loved travelling by train around Singapore .... we all go Ezylink cards and spent our entire holiday travelling by train. Never had a problem,"
,,Don't be afraid to use it,5.0,,We waited till our last day to use the MRT. We had time and figured if we got lost it was OK. It was very easy to use and remarkably clean like the rest of the city. We spent a lot of money on cab fares that we didn't have to.
,,easy map to read,5.0,,just love it. gets you anywhere. map easily understood for tourist. staff friendly. air conditioned.
,,Once you can get a card it is good,3.0,,"Be sure to have cash, otherwise you can not get a ticket or a the tap on card with a credit card! A bit silly that they don't take credit cards."
,,Easy and cheap mode of travel,5.0,,"Buy a MRT card and travel through mrt. Its easy and do carry a map, avoid asking people or you might be misguided. If the amount in the MRT card is left, you can get the refund."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,A must see when in Singapore. Words can not describe this amazing place. The gardens from the world are a sight to see and the huge indoor waterfall in cloud forrest is unbelievable.
,,Best public transport,5.0,,"In Singapore mrt is best public transport, generally its clean. Just that during peak hour its not easy to get a seat"
,,ZOOM IN AND ZOOM OUT,5.0,,"The Best way to see Singapore is to travel by MRT.One can cover around 80% of the attractions by using the MRT.It is the cheapest and MRT Currency cards can be used for travelling by Bus also.Whether you are lone traveller or a group,it is just right for everyone.There are ample instructions which makes it easy to reach your destination."
,,Clean and efficient.,5.0,,"Sydney/London you can learn a thing or two. Extreamly clean, no graffiti or rubbish. Orderly system for getting on/off. Easy to navigate and very cheap."
,,Very efficient and clean,5.0,,Works incredibly well and the helpfulness of both locals and staff is excellent. The cost is extremely low and the value is high.
,,"This is a great way of getting around, I wish Australia had something like this",5.0,,"What a great way of getting around Singapore, we bought the 2 day tourist tickets and traveled as far as the Malaysian border on the service.
It is very quick to get around on and once you get the hang of it you can get from anywhere to anywhere quicker by going from one line to another.
Circle line stays underground, but others do come above ground once they leave the city.
If you are a tourist, don't get on at peak hours as it is the main form of transport.
Changing lines is easy and can save you quite a bit of travel time.
If you buy a MRT pass you can get to just about everywhere on the island"
,,Best Visioned Metro Thinking in the World,5.0,,"Singapore is perhaps the only country, or city-state, in the world to ""Put the Automobile in it's Place!""
Through an ingenious system of cross subsidies, the government makes driving a personal automobile a stupid thing to do, but if you want to be stupid you are paying very heavy taxes and fees to fund the construction of the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit, which provides safe, clean, convenient and fast movement across the city, in which all modes of transport (walking, cycling, car parks, buses and taxies) are well integrated into this wonderful system."
,,EASY PEASY!,5.0,,"This is for me, the easiest mode of transportation else where. And also very affordable. They also offer you tourist pass (for tourist, hence the name) that you can travel unlimited to any point with just a cheap amount!"
,,Best train map ever,5.0,,User friendly system. Friendly staffs. Maps easily understood. Best thing to get around. Its comfy thanks to the air conditioned.

,,Thumbs up!,5.0,,"I've always admired the transportation system in Singapore. Efficient, on time, clean, safe and reliable. The automated system allows you to see when the next train and bus is arriving. This includes several apps which is most of the time accurate."
,,"Perfectly working mass transit, what more do you need?",5.0,,"Everything was clean, on time, clearly instructed, cheap and easy to access and use. Great mass transit system."
,,Best train service ever,5.0,,so easy to use. helpful staff. cheap as cheap. maps are easy to use too. train arrives every 5 minutes.
,,"Dependable, reliable and economical",5.0,,Best way to travel in Singapore. It is really economical and dependable transport system. One of the best transport system in the world. I know many will agree with me. Avoid peak hours.
,,Easy to use/ so clean,5.0,,"So easy to use. Get tickets from machine by just entering destination stop. Most trips we took in Singapore city cost $1.50. Even Clarke quay to airport only $2.50. Wheelchair and pram accessible lifts in all stations we used. No eating or drink on the train $500 fine. Platform and toilets very clean. Plenty of shops leading to or out of most stations. I get the feeling one could max out their credit card on the way to some stations, lol"
,,Easy way to travel the city,4.0,,"As a visitor, the ease of getting around a large city is essential to enjoying what it has to offer. The SMRT system is well laid out, offer's multi-day unlimited visitor passes and is clean. With the card, a map and a bit of knowledge of what we wanted to see, we were pro's in not time."
,,Huge but yet more time consuming sometimes to someplaces,3.0,,"Huge. On time. Clean. Efficient.
But still there was huge scope for improvement.
Foe example if you want to go to Jurong bird park from Nicole station, you will have to travel by three trains and take a bus too.
Take a cab instead. Saves you an hour."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Great MRT system. Cheap, easy to use. Didn't have to wait more than five minutes once. Well done Singapore."
,,Simply Superb,5.0,,"So very easy to navigate. Though travelling by MRT definitely takes more time than taking a cab, it's really quite comfortable. However, if you have to change lines, then be prepared to walk a bit."
,,Excellent Transport Facility,5.0,,"Easy to use.. excellent transport facility through out Singapore. comparatively cheap. Neat and clean stations with good facility. Its very easy to travel, if you have the MRT Map, which is available in all MRT Counters.."
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Excellent, clean, reliable and super easy to use. World class service and one of the best mass transit services I have ever used."
,,"Easy, fast, clean and cheap",5.0,,The MRT is similar to Hong Kong. Easy to navigate. Definitely the cheapest way to travel around Singapore (apart from walking).
,,Reasonable and comfortable.,5.0,,Very convenient and cheap to travel with very good connectivity across the city. The maps are easily available.
,,Probably the best transport system in the world,5.0,,"This transport puts London's tube to shame! This is the most convenient, accessible, cheap and user friendly MRT I have ever encountered. If only all cities could be like this!"
,,Good network but yet to become first class,3.0,,It was a good setup for small island city however due to dated signal system it is now under going upgrade to bring it towards a better system. Extensive line of coverage is in the plan to cover the city island as public transport free system for each household to access the point of public transport within 400m. Given some time the system will be much better than now.
,,Singapore's MRT,5.0,,"Love to travel on the MRT as it is cheap, efficient and convenient. It will not be crowded if you travel during off peak hours. The cabins are clean and the journey is smooth and not jerky."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Everyone should use this user friendly way to get around Singapore. Signs are in English, trains very clean and very quick."
,,Can be improved,3.0,,"May be HK MTR and JAPAN MRT/Train system are so massive compared to Singapore, I find Singapore MRT though new and modern, it is still relatively limited. Not that many entrances/exits for each line, it is not as user friendly. You really need to walk quite a distance to get to MRT. Some stations too like Orchard is really small since it is such a popular stop. Clean and rather safe though since most of the stations have partitions to block you from the tracks. Only stations away from the city have open areas to the tracks."
,,"Cheapest, simplest, THE BEST!",5.0,,"You need only two things to enjoy this amazing infrastructure!

1. Gotheresg app
2. Singapore MRT map app

If you have these two apps your life will be much easy and can travel hassle free through out SG!

Kudos to SG government for creating and maintaining such an amazing infrstructure."
,,Transport,5.0,,Easy to use. Can buy a 3days tourist csrd for S $30 which S$10 is refunded at end when uou return card - you have grace of a few days to return card. Colour coded and the station staff very helpful. All lines are inter-connected.
,,"Been using SMRT for many years, it only gets better (though more crowded)",5.0,,"If you are a visitor to Singapore, don't be afraid to use public transit. It's clean, easy to use, reliable and cheap. No downside. It puts ALL public transit I have ridden in the US to complete shame. Tickets can be purchased at any MRT station using cash or credit card (including primitive US credit cards). All trains and buses are air conditioned, as are underground MRT stations. Signage in stations and on platforms is incredibly clear and includes information about the arrival of the next train. Ride it and be impressed!"
,,Great,5.0,,"Clean, cheap, punctual, safe, modern and quick! What more needs be said? As an ex pat Aussie living in Singapore the SMRT is something Singaporeans can be justly proud of."
,,The SMRT is fantastic. The best way to get around the city.,5.0,,"The SMRT is so clean and punctual, it puts London to shame! As a traveller you feel very safe. Signage is good and information is easy to find. Very inexpensive too."
,,Good Transit Line,4.0,,"Like HongKong, Singapore pretty much depends on their MRT as the cheaper and faster mode of transportation around the city. It's also oretty clean and efficient with their schedules. Although some carts would seem smaller and others feel newer, the dependability of the timing is consistent. I suggest you grab an MRT card which was SGD15 and load up at least SGD10 to get around. It can also be used in the Bus system which is pretty efficient. There are maps in the stations and small screens inside the trains to let you know where you are and what next station is coming. There will be some stations where you would need to really walk to and connecting directions may be somewhat confusing so take advantage of the exit signs and try to really map out your itineraries and stations before taking the MRT."
,,Easy and fast way to travel around the city,5.0,,"During our 10 days stay, we bought ourselves a EZ-Link card for 12 SGD and received 7 SGD inside the card to use. When you are done, you can return the card to any MRT service counters and you will get back the value of money left on the card.
*You must have at least 3 SGD on the card at ALL times*

If you are not planning to stay in Singapore for over 5 days then you can get a tourist EZ-Link card for 24 SDG (I think)."
,,EASY TO GET AROUND,4.0,,This is my 3rd visit to Singapore and we used the MRT to get around the city. Very easy to ride. All the subway are color coded. Even my kids know their way around the MRT. Price very.
,,Just love Singapore,5.0,,"Great city, so much diversity, stunning architecture spanning centuries old to ultra modern. Very efficient transport, great places to eat, diverse precincts offering Arb, Chinese, Indian & Malay cultures & food. Love this city! Been here many times over past 10 years......"
,,Best Transport System in Asia,5.0,,This is my daily transit mode. I love the professionalism and excellent support which the SMRT Staff provides. You can use the passes to save and also you have automated ticket machines to pay through cards. The frequency of trains is also good.
,,"A very efficient, clean well run system",4.0,,"I was very impressed by the MRT system, it was clean, efficient and on time.
As a tourist you can purchase a tourist travel pass which works out to about S$10 per day unlimited travel, it is well worth looking into. The station staff are very pleasant and helpful.
Compared to our Metro system at home there is no comparison."
,,Great way to get around.,5.0,,"I always use the SMRT when in Singapore, get a EZ card at the station and you can top up when needed. The system is clean and runs on time, I also use it on the buses which I use often too. During peak hours it is very busy and the trains are crowded. A very inexpensive way of getting around Singapore and it is air conditioned!"
,,Makes getting around easy,5.0,,"I put S$20 on a prepaid card and it lasted me 5 days. Clean, efficient, timely and very cheap. Changi airport to Orchard Rd S$1.72"
,,Excellent cpnnectivity,5.0,,"We used MRT extensively during our visit, it is fast, convenient, efficient and well connected and cheap."
,,Love the MRT,5.0,,"The MRT is always on time, clean, safe, runs everywhere I want to go and with a Tourist Pass, super cheap and convenient. Great to mix with the locals who are always friendly to speak to and offer suggestions about what sights to see."
,,Excellent service,5.0,,"Singapore Mrt, i'd say is a boon not only for the residents but more for tourists.All the attractions are so well connected, that one doesnt have to look thw other way.
Its also very child friendly, more so the people riding are child friendly always offering their seats to young children.

We had a fantastic time riding on it!"
,,Brilliant way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT is the easiest way to get about to places in Singapore. If you feel a bit lost the staff at the Service Desk in most stations are very helpful and you are given a map of road links and where to get on and off to your destination. The rails run very quickly with short spurts of waiting time. There are seats for people who are elderly, disabled and for expectant mum and mothers with small children. The carriages do get congested some times depending what line you are travelling on but if you ask for the seats reserved for those I have mentioned above many locals I found, very polite and will give up their seat. The carriages are very clean and for each station there is an announcement where the rail will stop. Best way is to purchase a SMRT card that you can top up when needed. As you go through the card machines tapping your card after travel it will show how much you have left on your card."
,,Simply amazing,5.0,,Couldn't fault the system best train system I've been on. Never have to wait long and is very clean. Very well priced as well.
,,"Organised, clean and spacious!",5.0,,The SMRTS is great! If staying for less than 3 days I would suggest buying the metro pass. It is a good deal and you can get a 10sd once you return your card.
,,"Clean, efficient. Low priced. Tourist pass!",5.0,,"Many lines, so you can get to many places including the airport!

In some MRT stations you will find extensive competition for small but excellent restaurants. Woodlands station is an example - over a dozen great small restaurants and bakeries, coffee shops, not a single dumpy food outlet in the entire lot!

Getting a tourist pass is a great idea, but unfortunately these are NOT available at all MRT stations. So depending upon where you arrive you may have to travel to another MRT station (with a special wicket for tourist passes) to purchase the tourist ticket. Also be aware that there is a $10 deposit and you need to return it in person to the same type of tourist wicket. NOT open at 6 am!"
,,Excellent Way to Get Around Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT is clean, easy to navigate, reasonably priced, friendly - what more can I say? We were in Singapore fro 5 days and used MRT exclusively to get around, even to the airport for our departure. The stations are well located, the signage is clear. Highly recommend it."
,,Excellent trasport system,5.0,,"An excellent transport system is one of the main strenght of this very modern city. Trains are clean and fast, you get wait just 4/5 minutes between a train and other one."
,,wow!!!!,5.0,,"So easy and available to use throughout the city. I wish something like this existed in LA. It was clean, simple, easy to use and affordable."
,,Worth every penny.,4.0,,"Buy a 1,2 or 3 day pass as per your requirement as soon as you land. We were very unfortunate that we couldn't buy the 3 day tourist pass at the Changi Airport as the ticketing counter was shut so we had to pay the fare to Bugis and buy the tourist pass there. This was shocking as most people entering Singapore would prefer buying the tourist pass at the airport itself. Apart from this it was a pleasure using the MRT. When you buy the MRT pass you are eligible to travel on the MRT as well as the buses till the pass is valid. Everything is self explanatory but in case you need help just visit the customer service counter or use google maps to know which line to take and in which direction. Its a no brainer if you are using google maps. I recommend everyone travelling to Singapore to use this super efficient and neat and clean public transport to fully explore the city."
,,The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit.,4.0,,"The cheapest and most convenient way of moving yourself around in Singapore is by the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT). 99% of the stations and their trains are so clean, without trash aound at all. This system of transport has links to major interchanges, shopping centres, housing and residential areas. All one need to know is to be knowledgeable of how to connect with these links. As with high usage of this transport system, it is inevitable that some breakdowns will occur....but they were always promptly dealt with to minimise inconvenience for most users. There are distinct and centrally placed information and charts at all the MRT stations to help and give information of how the different trains travel to and from. Where do you need to go to at Singapore...? north, south, east, west or the famous Orchard Road shopping area....just check out the information at the stations and voila ! ....you'll be there in no time at all....."
,,EVERYTHING GREAT,5.0,,"The MRT cabin is clean to perfection,map was easy to read and people all safe and friendly.I highly recommend to grab yourself the map before going to anywhere in Singapore.Afterall,Singapore is a small country,and don't worry,you're all safe.Mrt stations are found everywhere.You can literally see it if you look above you in some Neighbourhoods.Keep up the good work!"
,,Easy to negotitae,5.0,,"While in Singapore we decided to give their public transport system a go. Singapore has the BEST public transport I have ever used. Clean, punctual, easy to negotiate. Well done Singapore."
,,Great way to travel,5.0,,The smart is by far the best quickest and most efficient way to get around singapore. If you buy a card you can save even more money and although for tourists you can't get back the $5 it costs to buy the card it's still the cheapest transport to use. There are stations everywhere you would want to go including sentosa island and the airport what more could you ask for.
,,One of the best Subway system in the World,5.0,,"Despite being packed & busy, it's amazing to see the trains and stations so clean. People go about in an orderly fashion and are quite helpful although some are just too busy in their own world (as in most cities around the world). Very efficient and we always felt safe."
,,Cheap travel,5.0,,Very clean ! Couldn`t believe how quiet it was ! So cheap ! We found it very easy to use including the ticket machines.
,,Beat the traffic,5.0,,Best mode to travel in Singapore. MRT Buses provide the last mile connectivity. Most efficient mode of transport in Singapore
,,The way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,The mrt have been around for many years. The singapore government enhanced and extend many lines to many housing areas. The best way to get around connecting many lines. Get yourself a travel card for $5 non refundable and pay $7 fare + whatever you top up. The money value can be use to shop at mini stores in the station and cards don't expire for a long time. Traveling during peak hours is extremely pack.
,,wow!,5.0,,so clean and tidy with easy to read routes and very helpful staff if you get stuck. these driverless trains are so efficient and with a very regular service you can access areas in Singapore easily
,,So very easy to use,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for a couple of days on a trip back from Thailand. We used the MRT the whole time we were there, no need to use taxis as we found the MRT to be easy to navigate, inexpensive, clean and very safe."
,,Efficient and perfectly organised,5.0,,"Perfect transportation system. If you can simply master the MRT system, you can save a lot on traveling within Singapore and do it efficiently. (E.g. from Changi airport to Chinatown it's approx 25$, where as MRT from Changi to Chinatown costs less than 2$!) This is the backbone of Singapore urban business peoples travel system. There are plans to extend the blue line also to Changi."
,,Easy travel,5.0,,"Quicket way to travel around , u can use uber or Grab At night we preferred metro could easy reach anywhere in less than 15 minutes"
,,SMRT,5.0,,excellent mass transport system. safe and on time plus it is convenient. easy to navigate and it is child and senior friendly
,,MRT - the only way to go,5.0,,"strong, silent, cool and comfortable Singapores MRT rocks. it is the convenient way to get around without sweating. recently I found myself on the newly opened yellow line which i thought was going to harbourfront! well it was but the long way round! it now covers half the island. the great news is that places previously accessible by taxi you can now get to easily! love it!"
,,Super efficient transport,5.0,,"Absolutely love the Singapore MRT. Efficient, clean, economical and very user friendly. So easy to connect onto another line. if unsure of which line to take, just enquire at the passenger service window. I'm always amazed at how frequent the services run."
,,$20 gets you around for a whole week!,5.0,,This system gets you virtually everywhere you need to go. Trains come so frequently you'll never wait for more than five minutes.
,,Family pass is a must!,5.0,,"My family of 4 stayed in Singapore 5 days and we definitely got our money's worth. Very clean and efficient system, you can ride the underground mrt or buses with the pass. Sometimes it was difficult to find mrt locations but installing the google map app helped."
,,Best way to travel!,5.0,,I got the 3 day tourist pass for $30 and if you hand it back in you get $10 of this back. So easy to navigate and always on time! I wish all cities had transport this cheap and easy.
,,So easy,4.0,,"Using is a breeze. Get your travel card tap on and off just like opal or oyster. Lines are colour coded and directional. Easy to follow, quick, regular and clean."
,,World class transport system!,5.0,,"Impeccably clean, fast and stress free. Gets me to my destination hassle free. The lines were not difficult to understand as well.The officers behind the counters were also friendly and willing to help. Keep it up, Singapore!"
,,We love the MRT,5.0,,People around so friendly to help at the start but what a way to travel.We could not have seem so much of this beautiful city without it. Left Sue. to buy th tickets she loved that.Very cheap travel costs...Must rank as one of the best systems in the world.New Zealand should learn.
,,efficient transport,5.0,,cheap and easy to use with the easylink card hwich is easy to get top up and use very clean well sign posted in multiple languages oh and air conditioned :-)
,,Fast Frequent & stress free,5.0,,"SMRT is a great way to travel longer distances around Singapore. Trains are very frequent, often fully automated (can be a bit disconcerting standing right at the front of the train looking up the track & not seeing a driver beside you). Transiting between lines is easy with clear signage throughout. Don't forget to keep the ticket and top it up to use again - first time you use it you have paid an extra 10c for the ticket, third time you get the 10c back again - and a bonus 10c when you use the ticket for the 6th time."
,,"Very efficient, and times between trains is so small...",5.0,,"Cheap and easy to use. Doesn't even feel busy even when it is. Sometimes at the interchanges (changing lines) there is a bit of a walk but plenty of escalators. Staff were very helpful when we did not know what to do to get a ticket. VERY clean, both trains and stations. Signage was good to tell you where to exit, certain plazas, Street, sights etc."
,,Singapore June 2017,5.0,,"we travel from Little India to Clark-quaky ,Very smooth and clean SMRT speed is more then in india, It was good experience"
,,TOO EASY!!,5.0,,"First time users... it was so convenient ...simple, inexpensive, safe, and extensive. trains packed most of the time-although we stood up..not a drama... great to see a great example of public transport as it should be...shopping and food destinations at most stations... how good is that...convenient!!"
,,Safe and Clean,5.0,,"We liked the protection barrier and that the stations were so clean. We over the pond could learn a thing or to. Also there were easy to follow signs and maps. People were so kind. We had our toddler and passengers always gave up their seat for her. Lastly, all the stations I used had elevators and escalators, in addition to the stairs. That always works for us."
,,The Main Arteries of Singapore Public Transit,5.0,,"Every few years, it seems, a new MRT line opens in Singapore. While they can be crowded during commute time, MRT trains offer one of the best ways to get around Singapore. You can buy a SMRT card at any station, and reload it as necessary. The SMRT card also works on the buses, which makes it really easy to get around on public transit.
In years past, I carried a small notebook with bus information of interest, but since we now get local SIM cards, we use a Singapore Map application for the phone which features a comprehensive list of buses along with MRT information. Out of the core city center, there are bus hubs at many MRT stations. It has thus become fairly easy to navigate your way around Singapore without renting a car or hiring a taxi.
The system is pretty reliable. When you hear about breakdowns, they are generally involving the two oldest lines, East-West and North-South. All of the other lines are much newer."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Very easy to use and appears clean and safe. Not very expensive. As someone that isn't used to using this kind of system, I found it really seamless."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"The easiest and fastest way of traveling in Singapore. It's convenient, super clean, and always run on time!"
,,Better to take taxi,3.0,,"So, the MRT is super clean And organized and somewhat convenient. However since taxis are quite affordable I would recommend that you stick to taxis as you will save a lot of time. For a taxi ride that would take 12-15 minutes it took me an hour via the MRT when you add the walking. If you are more than one person the taxis will be quite affordable.
I bought the tourist pass and barely used it."
,,Basic transportation in SG,5.0,,This MRT service and LRT is well maintained and a basic commuter service in SG. Using map you can transport to anywhere in SG. Staff members are cordial and people are basically helpful for tourists. You need to buy and EZlink or NETS cards to buy tickets/swiping in the respective stations. Tickets are cheaper than Taxi and shuttle transportation.
,,Easy Travel,5.0,,"It was so easy to travel around Singapore because of maps inside the train stations or even outside the stations. That's what I like about Singapore, easy to understand the MRT system aside from the safety and cleanliness in the stations and the trains itself."
,,"Thanks to you, SMRT!",5.0,,"This is one thing i love i about Singapore. Very accessible, tourist-friendly, convenient, clean,. With SMRT, goind around Singapore is very easy!"
,,Must to be there,5.0,,Very efficient and probably best way to be around SG. Very clean facilities people are very polite. Always is any model of transport on time.
,,"Great value, clean and frequent",5.0,,The Singapore MRT would be the easiest system to navigate that we have found. You just have to get used to the fact there isn't a driver up front! We used two lines and had trains available within 10 minutes each time.
,,Efficiency and SMaRT,5.0,,Looking for smart reliable service go no further past SMRT; definitely one of the gems in her Crown.
,,great train system,5.0,,We used the MRT for the first time in Singapore and found it very easy to get around. Very cheap and very clean
,,"Singapore's own overhead & underground tube..November 7, 1987",3.0,,"yep! the SMRT have come a long long way and still expanding her lines.
154 (106 in operation, 13 opening in 2017, 35 more under construction or planning)
single & multiple trip tickets & senior concessions & tourist passes and what have you under the glaring sun on this little red dot of ours! not bad for a tiny island yeah! lol
it has it's up s & downs...downs meaning breakdown BIG TIME! hahaha..to the effect the previous CEO has to step down...another break down...hahaha.
always trying to reinvent herself and succeeded in ways of malls & retailing outlets and extended time on eves of holidays and what not.
frustrating at times when the carriages are sardines packed without the air condition running...and the stench from our fellow homo-sapiens...let alone the sweated & overworked construction workers. shame on the operator's!
affordable means of transport between point A & B...in especially to & flo the Changi International Airport...
this is also a melting pot where you can latch on multi-nationalities in a single carriage..buzzing your ears with exotic and frequently noisy & loud conversations!
all in, quite efficient and could not bring myself to give it a very good marks!
and btw NO EATING ON BOARD! less you get a summon!"
,,So easy to get around!,5.0,,We were so impressed at how clean and efficient the rail system ran. We navigated our way around Singapore with no problems at all. There were signs everywhere and we were able to change lines with ease. The cost was cheap to get around and we just topped up our card each day and off we went. Great!
,,One of the Best in the world!,5.0,,"I live in Singapore, so I am probably biased.

Hands down, one of the best MRT system in the world. The MRT network is analogous to the circulatory system of the human body. It is what keeps the city abuzz. Clean, convenient, cheap, and frequent. More words aren't needed."
,,"Fast,Economical and Convenient",5.0,,I was in Singapore for over 2 weeks and from day 1 I used the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT). The best part it takes you practically every part of Singapore. It is economical. One can take a pass and reduce costs. It is very easy to navigate. Both tourists and the locals use it alike.
,,Wonderful experience,5.0,,"Only positive things to say.
Even though we were first time in Singapore, we felt very comfortable and easy using MRT services.
The trains arrive in every 5 minutes.
Well placed sign boards and route information and well connected routes.
We used MRT for most of our traveling including airport transfers.
If you have any confusion feel free to ask the staffs, they are very helpful."
,,Most basic transportation in Singapore,4.0,,"Nothing special, just a train but it's clean and convenient. Try to avoid peak hours during weekdays when everyone is rushing to work."
,,All roads and destinations in one card,5.0,,"Supper convenient! They have 7 lines snake almost every corner of Singapore. Most importance, to change between different lines, you no need to checkout. Just one time in and one time out. The magnec card cost 12 Sing dollars. The card cost 5, the value is 7. You can top up each time by 10/20/30 Sing dollars. If the card is empty, don't worry, just buy single ticket as you like. Fast, clean, cheap!"
,,Tourist pass,5.0,,Use the Tourist Pass. A$10 deposit refundable at MRT at the end. Good to get to the airport as well but you have to change in non airconditioned station close to the airport.
,,Wish every city had a system like the MRT!,5.0,,"The MRT is just outstanding. Fast, clean, airconditioned, cheap, everything connects, everything is well signposted at every station, never get lost, always someone to help if you need it. We bought at $10 card at the 7-11 with $5 credit loaded and then topped up as needed. Each trip was generally less than $1 and we found we could get everywhere we need to go in Singapore. The street signs always showed the way to the nearest MRT as well so you never got lost. When we left we had some money left on our cards which you can't get back, so we gave them to some of the great hotel staff to use."
,,Amazing clean and ontime,5.0,,Great experience using the mrt in Singapore. Easy to follow and much cleaner than London Underground for sure. Easy to purchase tickets and staff helpful if you do need to ask questions. Most straightforward form of transport I've used by far
,,"Simple, fast, clean transport",5.0,,"What can you say other than the system is fantastic. Regular trains on all lines, everything was extremely clean, the ticketing system is simple and the light up maps in the train make finding your way a breeze."
,,Used my Tourist Pass a LOT!,5.0,,"Get a Tourist Pass, valid for all buses and MRT. You can only buy them at certain MRT stations, do your research on the internet!"
,,Superb network and operations but still a bit expensive!!,4.0,,"The network is spread out very well and the operations are also handled superbly. Almost all the areas in Singapore are covered in it (Though the Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari places are not connected well).

Still comparing it to the major metro services around the world, it is expensive."
,,The only way to travel,5.0,,This is a fantastic transport system and I wish that we had it here in Darwin. It is clean and easy to follow. If you have any issues there are helpful staff to assist you. The longest I waited for a train was 5 minutes - incredible!
,,Easy Travelling,5.0,,"This is a great service, very efficient and easy to use. We thought the prices were reasonable and the trains and stations were spotlessly clean. We found passengers polite and prepared to offer up their seat. A great way to travel in Singapore."
,,What's not to like,5.0,,"Clean, very efficient, low cost, reliable and safe. Single tickets can be topped up at the machines (only small notes and coins can be used) and re-used up to 6 times which cost around £5."
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,It's simple to use and good value. Get the tourist pass which is much better value and can be purchased from selected ticket offices.
,,Best in the world!,5.0,,"Singapore mass rapid transit is a unique mean of transportation. Take it without doubt. Safety is guaranteed. It is fast, cheap and clean. Air conditioned ia working to perfection!"
,,London underground could learn from this fantastic system,5.0,,"I was initially worried about taking 2 small children out and about in Singapore as i dread going out in London with them. After my first journey on the MRT in Singapore you just could not keep me off the trains over there. So cheap, clean, air condition carriages, passengers who treat others with respect and staff who come up to you if you look like you need help with your journey. Most importantly lifts everywhere so wheelchairs users and buggies can travel everywhere. An absolute pleasure using this MRT"
,,"Efficient, inexpensive and convenient - goes almost everywhere you'll want to visit",5.0,,There is a local website called gothere.sg which gives travel times and costs for MRT/bus/taxi travel between any two locations in Singapore.
,,Amazing system,5.0,,This is a wonderful cheap way to get around Singapore. The trains are regular and clean and are very well signposted to enable you to get from one area of Singapore to another.
,,So Easy to Get around,5.0,,"We were first timers in Singapore, but the MRT made our trip so easy. The system just could not be easier to find your way around. We brought a Singapore Tourist Pass which cost us $26 for 2 days and we got a $10 refund. Brilliant!!"
,,Puts many other systems to shame,5.0,,"Coming from Perth where if you miss one train you sometimes have to wait 30 mins for the next the MRT just stands out to me as a system that they have got right. Clean and frequent trains where if you miss one no problems it is only 4 minutes to the next. Combine this with many many stations, smart ticketing with good options for tourists and you have a great system. The MRT is a good example of how a transport system should work"
,,Austalia needs this,5.0,,This is a far superior system with trains every 4 - 5 minutes. Sometimes quicker. A++++. It is a system that is far more advanced than Australia.
,,"Fast, clean and intuitive",5.0,,"Taxis can be hard to find in Singapore. But if you're close to the well signed SMRT, take it. It's clean, fast and - unlike some - straight forward to use. Particularly useful between central areas."

,,Easy,5.0,,We were only in Singapore about a week but the mrt made it super easy to get around. It was also very clean!
,,Worlds best,5.0,,"Simply stated the Singapore public transport system trains and buses is superb and inexpensive, it's a pity other countries don't follow their lead."
,,Cheap easy to use and very efficient.,5.0,,"When in Singapore I find this a very efficient way of getting around. The trains are most effective when above ground the traffic is slow going. But also the trains will deliver you to almost every interesting place a tourist could want to go to, and at an incredibly low cost. Just get an ezlink card and start your journey. I bought mine at a station and only put on $20 and it seemed to last for ever. Its a very useful card as can be used on busses and in some taxi's to pay your fare. If your at a station and you just miss a train do worry the next one will be along soon, if you take a look at the monitor on the station it will tell you when the next one will arrive. Just try to stay away from rush hour if your a newby and not sure where you want to go because everyone will be in a hurry but after that just do it at your own pace and work out where it is you need to get to. So what are you waiting for get your card and enjoy the atmosphere. The trains are cheap clean and very very efficient."
,,Easy for visitors,5.0,,"Easy access, good maps, easy to find your way around, clean and bright. A big change from NYC and all for the good. Beautiful! Very good value!"

,,Singapore Tourist Pass,5.0,,"We bought 2 days Sin Tourist Pass at Vivocity. $16 plus $10 deposit. We can go anywhere by the tourist pass for 2 days. We got the $10 refund at Changi Airport Terminal 2. Good transport for travelling Singapore. We used MRT to Sentosa, Clarke Quay, Chinatown, Orchard, Merlion Park.

,,Easy way to get around,5.0,,"Stations never seem too far away, easy to use, clean and on time. Always seems to be someone around when you need help and that is a Bonus when you are a first timer using the system. Could not have been happier."
,,"Fine system, tickets a bit awkward",4.0,,"We used the MRT several times in a week with single fare tickets, bus and metro. Awkward that you cannot buy a three day pass in advance, ie it has to start the same day which is not fair arriving on an evening flight... and moreover not every station sells them...
The transport itself is clean, safe and on time. Not expensive but taxis are akso cheap and often faster and more convenient."
,,Best public transportation I have ever board,5.0,,"I am not good with direction, but with SMRT it went very smooth. The navigations in Singapore are the best. Neon boxes are everywhere, big signs, bold and bright, repetitive (they put so many direction board along the stations so you wont miss anything). Audio guide is there too. It even mention when and where to get off if you want to change route from interchange station. There are big maps for MRT directions on stations, or you can see from internet. Search ""MRT singapore map"".
Dont eat or drink here, the fine is scary ($500).

Train comes every 2-3 minutes so dont worry if you miss the previous train. It will come again in a minute. MRT really saves time and cost."
,,"clean, on time, reliable",5.0,,"Better than other forms of transport, except maybe Uber. Should be used as an example in other cities around the world. Just load your card at the machine and off you go."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Cheap, easy to use, very safe and clean. Used it everywhere, load a tourist card to get around 20% off."
,,The most convenient mode of transport in the city,4.0,,It's fast and convenient to travel around in the city. Can get a ezlink card to start travel around by topping-up as you want or a day-pass from the counter or any tourist information center.
,,MRT efficiency!,5.0,,"This is probably one of the easiest subway(Metro) systems to navigate. If you're familiar with the London system, they're very similar. The major difference, is that MRT is very modern and the underground stations are air conditioned. I recommend buying a card, which you can add value to, and any unused portion may be refunded at your local transit office, usually located at the train station."
,,So clean and reliable,5.0,,"We have lived in Singapore for 18 months but have travelled to many countries with rail services and Singapore's MRT beats them all hands down. After living in Melbourne and suffering from dirty, smelly trains which are often dangerous, it was a relief to travel on the MRT.
All signage is in English and the system and maps are easy to follow. It is also very cheap. They don't allow smoking or food in the stations or trains which is why they are clean and graffiti is never seen or accepted on the trains or buses. We hardly ever use a taxi as the trains and buses take you all over Singapore and they link the trains and buses.
The swipe system works and they use the tap on tap off system, rather than zones and the fares are so cheap. Most trips are less than a dollar. The only country I know of where the fares go down!!"
,,Great Value,5.0,,"Easiest way to travel round Singapore. Easy to find your where you need to be. Plenty of trains, always in time and spotlessly clean. Very good value for money."
,,Best & cheapest way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"We used the MRT to get around Singapore for the duration of our stay. We were very impressed. It was safe, clean, cheap, convenient, quick and so easy to use. Highly recommended."
,,Amazing service,5.0,,"The SMRT is absolutely fantastic and very cheap by comparison of other countries. The SMRT runs every couple of minutes, so if you miss your train don't panic the next one will be minutes away, easy too use and navigate an absolutely wonderful service which runs from Changi Intl airport"
,,Can we have a similar system?,5.0,,"Having just spent 6 days in Singapore and having used the SMRT every day bar one - all I can say is what a great system. Efficient, clean, safe, value for money, easy to use....I could go on, but you get the picture. I just wish that our rail system was as good. Well done Singapore."
,,Fantastic efficient system and still expanding,5.0,,"I have been using the SMRT for more years that I remember.
It is highly efficient, clean, air conditioned and cheap compared with its European counterparts... and it is still rapidly expanding to support the extensive bus network. You load up your SMRT and tap in and out of stations and buses.. you can also use the card to pay for small day to day purchases at most convenience stores e.g. 7 11 and top up as you go.. no need to carry small change"
,,Rides,4.0,,It can be as smooth sailing most of the times. But it also has its faults. None is perfectly build as Humans aren't perfect.
,,Very good,5.0,,If it's your first time go to Singapore better use Singapore tourist pass (STP). So if you take wrong ride you doesn't need to pay more. Coz you pay SGD20 for 3 days and SGD10 to deposit which you can take it back when you return your card.
,,Great transport system,5.0,,Train system runs frequently and to most parts of the inner city and the airport. Can be crowded at peak times but due to high frequency there is minimal waiting for another train.
,,best metro system we've taken so far !,5.0,,"overall best metro ! clean, very well organised, way is indicated very very clearly you just can't get lost. trains are all automatic and on time ! great !"
,,Easy access to Marina Bay,5.0,,"We transited thru Changi enroute to Houston. We took SMRT to go to Marina Bay. Easy to navigate and popular stations have staff , who can answer your questions.
Tip: kids 7 and below get free pass. Just ask staff before you purchase for your little one."
,,Convenient,5.0,,"Very extensive network that can reach most of the destinations, including CBD and tourist attractions."
,,The fastest transport system,4.0,,"MRT & LRT Trains

The most efficient way to get around in the island, their rail system moves more than 2 million passengers daily, in a very clean and safe way.Do not smoke, eat in the trains when travelling.See the metro map from the citycenter shopping area .Because Sin is still a shopping Paradise.."
,,Cheap convenient & efficient,4.0,,"Got an ezlink card for myself and my wife. Traveled on the MRT & the bus. Was very convenient. The MRT was mostly on time. It is a system I wish all cities would try to emulate. The only complaint I have is that because of a misunderstanding I had to exit out of the gates just 2 minutes after I had entered, it cost me 77 cents :( and that too without any travel."
,,Compared to anything in Australia this is the best.,5.0,,We travelled on the SMRT to many a place and the cost in minimal and the system is on time every time.
,,"Quick, Clean and On-time",5.0,,"Another example of Singapore's organization. The system works extremely well - pity other countries don't get their act together this way. Grat value for money, the ticketing system, great for tourists = very easy to use."

,,Easy peasy,5.0,,I was so nervous to try the MRT but so glad I did. Very easy to use and well signposted. Cheap and quick travel. Defo a must for travelling around Singapore to visit the sights.
,,"So convenient, on time and clean",5.0,,Extremely easy to get around to most places. Purchase a card that can be used on the MRT and the bus services.
,,Quick Reliable clean,5.0,,"A great way to get around Singapore. It is easily accessible, lots of stops, and easy to use. Tip buy an ezy card top up as you go. Also pick a hotel to stay with easy access to the MRT, then you can travel by train from the airport, and be nearby to go anywhere. But make sure you have a phone! Or you will feel very left out! Everyone is on their phone..... wether on the train, walking to the train, waiting for the train..."
,,Punctuality Supremo!,5.0,,"Three things that amazes me with the SMRT

(1) Efficient, fast and professional - punctual and on the spot with countdown timers announcing when the next train will arrive and they actually arrive ON TIME
(2) Strategic station location throughout Singapore - you can always find one that's nearby you
(3) Secure, clean and extremely comfortable

I'm sure there are places which can learn a great deal from Singapore when it comes to transport management. They've really got things going for them. Tickets are pretty affordable for even a long trip and the packages for a one day travel deal is quite attractive."
,,Best mode of transport in SIngapore,5.0,,"Super convenient, easy to use and cheap SMRT is a great way to explore Singapore. It connects all the possible tourist attractions and also has connecting buses for the remote ones like SIngapore Zoo."
,,Easy as pie,5.0,,There is a visitor transport card for 1 or 2 days. This gives you unlimited travel on buses and trains. We found the system very easy to use. You pay a deposit on the card which you can claim back before you leave. This makes it very easy to get around the city.
,,Worldclass train system,5.0,,"Fast, clean, efficient, get almost everywhere you want, low prices, one ticket, simple to use, easy to read and understand maps. You don't know what you would be missing by not using and pay a lot of money for taxi trips."
,,Get a pass - it's a no-brainer,5.0,,Excellent service: very efficient; very cheap; very clean A two day unlimited travel pass cost $8 per day (including refund of deposit)
,,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.",5.0,,"You purchase a card. You wait for your bus number or ask the driver if he will go to your destination or anywhere near it and they answer you politely. They are knowledgable and courteous. People actually queue and wait for their turn to ride the very clean and cold bus. The step going up to the bus is not steep so kids, the elderly and pwd can go up the bus without the fear of falling. Make sure your bus card is ready so as not to waste yours or anyone's time. Time is gold in Singapore as they say. The machines that accepts and validates your payment actually is in good working condition. It's spacious. You can choose to sit or stand or go to the next level to see Singapore and its' very clean and verdant city. The buses don't break down. Singapore's transport system is efficient and organized."
,,So easy!,5.0,,"Being new to the MRT, it was so easy to learn the system. Only a few routes, impossible to get lost and it's so quick, can get to any point of interest around the city in about 30mins.

It's all immaculately clean as there's not eating or drinking down there and the trains are so frequent you're hardly waiting.

Get a tourist pass for 1, 2 or 3 days. Unlimited travel on MRT, LRT and buses. You pay $30 for 3days but when you give the card back you get $10 back so it's only $20 for unlimited travel.

Can get it to and from the airport as well, save yourself $20-30 in a taxi/uber. We didn't know this and made the mistake of getting the taxi so I'll pass on my advice to you lot"
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Good way to get around Singapore and it's cheap. Staff are very helpful for the tourist if your not sure where your going but it's clearly marked and tickets are easy to buy, just touch the screen where your going. Easy. Worth the experience."
,,"Well planned, efficient and clean system.",5.0,,Go close to almost anywhere in Singapore on this quiet and quick system. You can get to and from Changi Airport.
,,"Awesome, on time, clean, cheap...",5.0,,"what more could you want with public transport... amazing, clean, cheap, on time, simply to use, friendly staff"
,,Excellent Transport,5.0,,We have been everywhere in Australia and many overseas places and this is the best public transport we have been on. We were in Singapore for 6 days and bought what they call Tourist Pass $20 for three days then topped up another $20 for remainder of our stay and you get unlimited trains and buses. There were five of us and for $200 we went all over Singapore we would leave the Hotel around 9 am and most nights we didn't return until late. We were close to Somerset station and the trains come every few minutes and they are so clean and well organised.
,,World's best transport system,5.0,,"The best transport system I have used and it is very convenient to everybody!
You will pay through the distance and not for per ride basis. The mrt train is so clean that most of the kids and teens sometimes sit on the floor. That is how clean their trains are! Must experienced in Singapore!"
,,Efficient and Affordable,5.0,,I was there for 3 weeks and used the local MRT and buses. If you have to take a train to a midpoint and catch a bus to get to your destination the system automatically subsidizes your ride. I had topped up $50/- and it was sufficient for my three weeks. The interchanges were clean and sometimes indoor and air conditioned . All the buses and train were air conditioned.
,,A train every couple of minutes to wherever you want to go!,5.0,,"As we were staying in Singapore for a week, we bought EZ-Link cards which are like the Oyster cards in London, making it easy to use the trains and the buses. With the map we carried everywhere, it was easy to work out how to get to where we were heading."
,,Perfect,5.0,,"In Singapore everyone calls it ""MRT"". It is the most beautiful, cleanest and ordered transit system in the world. It is important to mention that no food, beverage or smoking is allowed in the MRT."
,,Great transport system,5.0,,The Singapore mass rapid transport is excellent fast & cheap we used on numerous occasions would use if we ever visit Singapore again
,,Excellent public transport system,5.0,,"Although Singaporeans love to bemoan the MRT's breakdowns, when compared to the subway systems of other countries, Singapore's MRT really does fairly well. It's the easiest way to access tourist attractions in Singapore, with an intuitive layout and low price."
,,Use it,4.0,,Love there mrt system It's so cheap and convenient Just a tip though On weekdays do not use or try to avoids between 7am-8.30am and 4.30-7pm these are peak times and you will feel like a sardine in a metal tube
,,MRT,5.0,,Very clean and tidy to say it's 30 yrs old well maintained.. and doors on the platform for safety and although as a night user felt safe wondering around easy to use and lots of platforms to visit
,,easy to use can get to most places with public transportation quickly,5.0,,I like to use public transportation when traveling (a token compensation for the tons of CO2 connected with flight). I found SMRT to be easier to use than most. There are a few stations where getting out to where you want to go can be a little trial and error (phone gps helps a lot).
,,"Who needs cars when you got SMRT - Easy, Convenient and Cheap!",5.0,,"Given the size of Singapore, got to say SMRT has got you covered when it comes to moving from point to point in Singapore. Cheap and conveniently located; mind the rush hour though! We went to Airport on SMRT during rush hour from Bugis Square and all it took was like 25 minutes!"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,As a Londoner and user of the tube in a very regular basis this was a eel pleasure. It's easy to navigate and the trains are well air conditioned. The only grip I had was at each station there's limited ticket machines.
,,Why aren't all cities this good?,5.0,,Singapore's MRT system is brilliant and so easy to manage for tourists. The best option is to forget the tourist pass (which offer unlimited travel but are valid only for a specific number of days) and instead buy a card at a 7 Eleven store that you can load as needed. The card will cost $10 which includes $5 credit. This gives you travel on trains and buses. Fares are very cheap and you will find it easy to get around this way. In 5 days we spent only $25 which included a trip to Changi Museum and our return to the airport at the end of our stay as well as all our sightseeing.
,,Excellent way of getting around,4.0,,"Although not everywhere is connected, it is a cheap and very efficient way of navigating Singapore and it's reputation of being exceptionally clean is true."
,,Best!,5.0,,We got used to the SMRT the very next day. Quite easy and even the children got a hang of it. Wonderful network!
,,Always better option.,5.0,,Very good option for commuting within singapore. We enjoyed MRT rides a lot. A lot cheaper option for within singapore travel.
,,Remains one of the world's best public transport systems,4.0,,"The MRT continues to be one of the world's best public transport systems. SMRT is one of just 2 operators in Singapore, with the East West line being its main offering. Getting to the airport is a little annoying as you have to wait at Tanah Merah sometimes for more than 10 minutes. I'm still not sure I understand why they didn't construct the extension such that some trains would continue to Changi Airport whilst others would go to Pasir Ris (like some of the tube lines in London) - getting off the train and waiting at Tanah Merah is a real pain. But other than that minor gripe the rest of the system is efficient and inexpensive."
,,Simply the best,5.0,,With MRT + bus you can get to any place in Singapore at a reasonably low cost. Buy the EZLink card and familiarize yourself with using MRT + bus service. Note that SGD6 is non-refundable when you return the card.
,,"Fast, efficient, superb",5.0,,"With an MRT like this, I wonder why anyone would not want to use public transport! Clean and efficient, and the best part is the clear (and very innovative) signage everywhere. We never found it very crowded. Always managed a seat in a while. And you always exit at a convenient place. No issues with last mile connectivity here."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"Our last day in Singapore we went to Little India for some shopping and lunch, then from there to Changi airport, all done on the MRT, and quickly, and cheap."
,,Amazing,5.0,,The stations were very clean. Very safe. Great value for money. And you can use the MRT any time you want and it is not a treat.
,,Good to move around,4.0,,"SMRT is good to move around if you can understand the location and have the capacity to walk. It's well connected to most of the city's sight seeing spots, though you will have to walk a little. Take the day pass."
,,Very convenient,5.0,,"Singapore has an excellent MRT system. The trains arrive every few minutes, and are comfortable and clean. The whole MRT system, including the trains, are air-conditioned.
The stations are located at convenient places and it is very easy to find where you are and where you need to go inside the system.
The riding fee is pretty low and it's best to use an ez-link electronic card which you can easily top up and use in all forms of public transportation, including cabs.
Beware, eating and drinking in the MRT system are not allowed and are heavily fined!"
,,Getting around Singapore is easy and inexpensive,5.0,,"The Singapore light rail system is reliable and clean (no eating or drinking allowed in stations or carriages) and runs every four minutes at peak times and every seven minutes off-peak (at least it did when I was there). It has air conditioning, which enhances its attractiveness as a way of getting around. The only downside is that it always seems busy and if you want a seat you will be disappointed a lot of the time."
,,Good Value,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is really efficient it's clean, safe and easy to use. A great way to get around Singapore."
,,Cheap and cool way to get around town,5.0,,"Used the MRT a few times during this trip. Was quite impressed with the efficiency and cleanliness (like most things Singaporean).
Fares too were quite affordable, with a re-useable ticket card that was easily recharged at any one of the machines located at the stations.
Given that a good part of the city is covered by the MRT, it's a great way to travel as long as you don't have too much luggage and avoid the peak hours."
,,Very efficient transit system,4.0,,"Very easy to use.. if you are here for a day or two you can buy a day or 3 days or a week pass as well.. but it's available only at few places.. very easily connects you to Changi International Airport as well..

Not too much congestion and very clean and well maintained.."
,,"cheap, easy and quick",5.0,,good way to get around this busy city. the trains are very clean and well maintained and cheap. simple to find your way around.
,,An easy and safe method of transport,5.0,,"We caught the train from the Airport, Terminal 2 or 3. This train ends at Tanah Merah, the central line. Get out the left side to go to the City, its clearly signed. To return to the airport, catch the train for Pasir Ris (East) then transfer again at Tanah Merah. Simple. They have ticket machines for ease of ticket sales. If you don't have the right change, there is a change booth available too. A very busy and well run system."
,,"Clever, clever Singapore",5.0,,"While staying in Singapore for 7 days we utilised their MRT every single day. As tourists you can buy a three day tourist pass for around $30 which enables you to catch as many trains and buses as you like during a 3 day period. The MRT is the easiest most efficient way of covering distances in Singapore. It is so easy to navigate, there are basically 5 main lines (red, blue, purple, yellow and green) and trains run every 2 minutes during peak times and around every 5-7 minutes at others. The system is so efficient and a pleasure to use, their trains are very clean (don't eat or drink on them) and the stations are all very clean and efficiently run. This would have to be one of the best train systems in the world - clever Singapore!"
,,MRT Round trip to Little India from Changi One to Farere Park,4.0,,Nice Journey great arrangement changing track needs long walking only need to careful . Rest is fine
,,Clean and efficient system,5.0,,"Staying in the suburbs for 10 days, the RMT was a great way to get around the city - purchase a travel card [like a London oystercard] for even cheaper travel. The stations are spotless and no food or drink is allowed on the system. Negotiating interchange stations is easy, and the staff very helpful when approached."
,,Singapore's Mass Rapid Transport,5.0,,Singapore has developed a well connected network of MRT. I believe it specially supports the tourist movement primary.
,,Mature Couple,5.0,,Easy to navigate around Singapore and cheaper than the bus. Can buy either a single ticket to top up or a 1 -3 day visitor ticket.
,,Nice,5.0,,Very nice and smooth way of transportation. Quite cheap - I paid 1.40 for the shortest route... You can reach the most important part of the city. It is very clean and save.
,,excellent,5.0,,"clean, efficient, cheap and easy. We found it very convenient to travel around Singapore with the MRT"
,,"Reliable, convenient and on time",5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to travel in Singapore. It's on time, has great outreach across the city and cheaper than other modes of transport here. Singapore is especially prone to traffic jams at some times of the day and the MRT is a great way to beat the traffic. Interchanges may require you to walk a bit between one station and the other, but the interchanges are clean and generally have some good food options, so no complaints. I will definitely depend on the MRT when I'm back in Singapore."
,,Challenging HK's MTR,5.0,,"Having lived in London (one of the first systems) and HK, I love the efficiency of underground. 15 years HK won hands down for its timeliness, cleanliness and network. Of course rival Singapore is hoping for oneupmanship and has invested heavily in expanding its train network ( some overground).

Come Oct 2017, phase 3 of the Downtown line will open to link north west to south east Singapore island. Am sure there will be teething problems but the MRT is world class. Importantly there is good train etiquette and even in rush hour there is some respect for personal space. No sardines like Tokyo.

Many stations now have large clean public washrooms. signage for train connections and local maps at stations are easy to navigate."
,,Dream Mass Transportation,5.0,,"Perfect example of how Mass Transport train for the city should function. Over the years, they have kept on improving. Be it new lines, ticketing system, links with buses & cleanliness is something this country is next to none."
,,Effective and Economical,4.0,,Most economical and rapid mode of transport in Singapore. Very good for the local transportation in the city.
,,It wss great after figuring it out,5.0,,"Was going to take a taxi and run around Singapore. They were slow and not at the taxi stands. Goggle maps shows the stations of the subway so it's a no brainer. I had a blast. The station, bathrooms and trains are clean. The people assist you and are very knowledgeable."
,,MRT,5.0,,Buy the pass and go! It is super easy to use. Station attendants are very helpful and easy to find. Take a photo of the entire system for quick reference!!! The escalators move faster during peak hours so be careful. Stand to the left on escalators as the people on the right will be climbing up the stairs for greater speed.
,,Easy travel companion,4.0,,What i like it very much from Singapore is the connection between each place. It was so easy using MRT when you go to local attractions. And the connecting between lanes also easy. Suggest use SMRT card for easy traveling without any cash.
,,Cleanest railway Iv'e come across,5.0,,"Was staying in Singapore on holiday and used the MRT quite a number of times. People are so polite, they are quick to give up a seat for the elderly and parents with children. You are not allowed to eat or drink on the stations or trains therefore making a clean and pleasant journey. Trains are wide and air conditioned. The ticket prices are a lot cheaper than the UK. It is so pleasant I recommend the Mayor of London to take a look."
,,Best way to get around the city!,5.0,,"For someone who was visiting Singapore for the first time, the SMRT was a boon.
It is quickest and cheapest mode of transport.
It connects the entire city., from North to South and east to West.
There are multiple lines and they have common stations where you can change the lines.

The single MRT card can be used for both SMRT and is also used for local buses instead of cash.

For people visiting for a short trip, buy the unlimited pass at the Airport. Also pick up the route map, which will make life much easier."
,,Great Value and used all the time,5.0,,"I was staying on Orchard Road between two stations and used the MRT all the time. It was great value for money and covers the whole city so you can go anywhere with a couple of changes. We took taxis as well but they were expensive and the roads were congested so this was the best way to travel.

Only down side is it is crowded and there are very few seats so expect to stand most of the way"
,,Super,5.0,,Well priced....excellent coverage...super way to get around...only knock is the deposit on transit cards...and a lack of prompt service from these outlets
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Trains and buses. Cheap, clean and frequent. If staying for a few days the it could be worth buying a travel card as the fares are cheaper but still good value if paying as you go. Note that buses do not give change so have plenty of small money if you plan to use them."
,,"Very effective, clean and punctual",5.0,,Very effective system to get around Singapore. Very reliable / on time / safe clean. Avoid rush hours on the red and green lines if possible. Supply has not caught up with demand on these core lines. Other lines are more comfortable to ride. Beware that eating and even DRINKING is prohibited in stations and onboard trains!!
,,goes everywhere,5.0,,I used the trains to go all over. It was very cheap and easy. Staff were very nice and helpful and the trains leave every 7 mins and go until midnight.
,,Super,4.0,,Great way of getting around the city. Its a must try while in singapore to travel from point a to b.
,,Best Way Around Town,5.0,,Cheapest commute to all over Singapore. Forget the traffic and cab fares. Organized and easy way to ride the MRT all over Singapore.
,,Best public tranportasion in singapure,4.0,,Singapore mass rapid transit is my favorite tranportation to get many places in singapore fasted and cheapest of course. And then the stasion and the train is clean and comfortable but avoid office hours like morning and afternoon because crowded.. Last time i just buy standart tiket from changi to vivo city ( near sentosa ) around 2.70 sgd ( deposite 1 sgd )..
,,"Clean, efficient and reliable",4.0,,Singapore MRT service has grown over the decades into many lines. I always enjoy this extremely efficient and convenient mode of transport. Most city stations are directly linked to a shopping facility.
,,"Okay, compared to Indian standard",3.0,,"Compared to developed countries' subways, this one isn't too bad, although their bus services are much better, in my opinion"
,,Which we had this in England,5.0,,Easy to get around and used this most of our holiday it's clean safe and cool and spacious even in rush hour the staff were helpful but mainly used the ticket machines for our tickets easy to use and find you way
,,"The easiest, cleanest public Transport System in the world",5.0,,"We don't drive in Singapore - you don't need to. Singapore public Transport system is certainly ranked as one of the cleanest, easiest & cheapest system to use in the world. Its easy to understand how the system works, with clear signage & an easy train line system to get you to where you need to go. The MRT stations are always located in great spots and with many exits to get to the right side of the street you need - its fabulously easy, and cool in this tropic heat to stay underground. Alot of MRT stations exit straight into shopping malls and even tourist destinations. Definately a great system to use."
,,Great Transport,5.0,,"Glad we found the train system on our visit to Singapore. Easy to understand and get around after looking at their maps. Staff were also very helpful and easy to approach. Very clean, air conditioned and cheap to use. Would recommend to all travellers,"
,,Favourite Transport System in the World!,5.0,,"I love this system. Clean, well signposted, cheap, regular, I just don't understand how anyone can compare this to the dark and dingy London version. There are very few places that can't be reached by the SMRT and it is the perfect way to get around Singapore. Loving the marketing thing at the moment with Stand Up Stacey, Hush Hush Hannah etc. Although I am with friends this time, I am often alone here, and love that it is so well lit and that I never have to stand around to get my bearings getting straight from A to B"
,,Excellent public transport system,5.0,,"Singaporeans are apt to moan about their transport system and complain about why it is not so efficient and clean as elsewhere (normally compared to Japan), but this is more reliable, better located, cleaner, and generally more efficient than those in most Western countries and cities (far better than London or New York, for instance - the former is the one I know best and have ridden on for many years). So don't complain, its good."
,,Take whenever you can,5.0,,Convenient but most of all it's so cheap! Try to avoid the crowds during peak hours because you'll get no breathing space.
,,"Downtown MRT Line, Singapore",5.0,,"The Downtown MRT Line Singapore should be the Tourists' favorite as it encompasses most of the attractions in Singapore.

1. Starting from Bukit Panjang Station it will stop at our Heritage Botanic Garden.
2. Then it will stop at Newton which is famed for its Food Stall at night. Furthermore you can change to the North South line for a one stop to Orchard Road,
3. The next stop is Little India, also on the tourist map.
4. Then it will stop at Bugis, a shopping and food area.
5. The next stop is Promenade which is linked to Suntec City, an exhibition cum food and shopping.
6, Then it will stop at Bayfront, the stop for the Marina Bay Sands.
7. The next stop is Downtown, when the Marina Financial Centre is.
8. The next stop is Telok Ayer, which is walking distance from Raffles Place.
9. Finally the train will end at Chinatown Point, which is smack in Chinatown itself. From there you can change to a North East line for Harbourfront and Sentosa.

Other MRT lines may be interesting but only the Downtown LIne serve most of the attractions in Singapore."
,,"Clean, cheap and efficient",4.0,,"SMRT is a good transport to go around Singapore as it almost reaches every place. It is easy for travellers to hop on and find their destinations. The fare isn't high and the instructions to do transit is clear enough. However, if you are used to Hong Kong's MTR system, you may be a bit frustrated in waiting for SMRT as it takes a few more minutes in waiting. However, it is not a big deal."
,,Get a pass and go,5.0,,"Well worth the convenience of getting around, easy to navigate with colour coded maps everywhere. Every 3 minutes is a train"
,,Well connected.,5.0,,I found it very similar to London's Underground service. Well connected to important destinations around the city and tourist attractions. Well connected and convenient.
,,Ideal to get around,5.0,,MTR + Hopp on Hopp off bus are the perfect combination to get around Singapore if you have only a limited period of time.
,,So easy,5.0,,"If you've ever ridden the Tube in London, you'll find the MRT an absolute doddle. It's clean, air-conditioned and so well signposted that it makes getting around Singapore quickly the easiest thing in the world!"
,,Clean and efficient. A modern underground system that could get you to the major attractions of central Singapore,5.0,,"A modern, very clean and safe underground system that gets you to all the major attractions within central Singapore"
,,Great transportation,4.0,,"We bought the prepaid card for convenience and it was great, rode MRT for 2 days and got our deposit refund just before we left town."
,,Lifesaver,5.0,,Mrt takes you anywhere and only costs a few dollars. My main mode of transport in singapore. Easy to top up ride card too.
,,Cheap and reliable,5.0,,"I heavily relied on the MRT during my stay in Singapore, the trains are frequent & take you pretty much anywhere that you want to go. If you are a tourist consider getting a tourist pass for between 1-3 days, currently a 3 day pass is 20 SGD.

Genuinely one of the most efficient ways of getting around a city I've ever used, Some of lines are driverless too. Makes the London Underground look like it's struggling apprentice"
,,Best way to get around Singapore.,5.0,,Absolutely spotless and the timetable is adhered to impeccably. Most areas are reachable using the MRT and very cost effective.
,,Safe clean easy to use,5.0,,Don't hesitate to use the metro to get around Singapore. It is inexpensive and very easy. Frequent trains and clean clearly marked directions
,,Superb Subway System,5.0,,"I took this from Changi Airport to Clarke Quay. I could not believe how straight forward it was.

I had a large suitcase and large laptop trolley bag. So I expected it to be a nightmare, but far from it.

Payment is by cash. The ticket machines only accept $5 (Singapore Dollar - SGD). Luckily there was a very helpful attendant on hand to change the $10 SGD note I'd just withdrawn in the terminal.

The ticket price is $2.50 SGD. So that's less than £1.50 for a city transfer from a major international airport!

I had to change train twice, at Tanah Merah and Outram Park.

Tanah Merah is really easy. There are two platforms next to each other. You just need to make sure you get off on the correct side of the train to catch your connection.

At Outram Park I had to use escalators to switch platforms. But it is all geared up for people travelling with large suitcases, so it was not a problem.

I also used MRT to get back to Changi."
,,Very convenient to get around,5.0,,"SMRT is one of the working examples of an efficient public transport. This is true for locals as well as persons visiting.

Multiple lines whose names based on their general direction and coloured identifier, eg. EW Green line (East-West). These can transport you easily, safely and low fares from one part of the city to another with very convenient connections to change to another line, if required.

As an example, a long 55 min ride from Changi Airport in the East to Jurong East in the West costs only S$2.60. The platforms and trains are clean, work long hours and are safe to travel. Most also link up with public buses."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"They say a developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It's where the rich use public transportation. Singapore's public transport is just that and it is amazing how well-developed and easy-to-use it is. The MRT stations are all over the country, well-located, easy to use and have helpful staff in case you have any questions."
,,Best mode of transportation,5.0,,"Everytime I visit Singapore, I prefer buying an EZ Link card and travel around the city via the MRT. Very fast, convenient and inexpensive. The platform and concourse areas were always clean. The stations had directional arrows for passengers to follow. The staff there were also accommodating."
,,"Not an attraction, just an efficient way to travel",4.0,,"Clean, efficient and air conditioned. A nice escape from walking in the heat and humidity if you need to travel any distance . A bit like the London Underground, but more modern and airy."
,,Quick easy and cheap,4.0,,"Quick, easy and cheap, three words that describe the MRT. Easy to understand and commute. Cabs are not very expensive in Singapore compared to western world but still mrt will workout cheaper."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Probably one of the best transport systems we've come across. Spotlessly clean, friendly staff available if you need them, frequent trains,easy to navigate and cheap. Very efficient."
,,cheap and efficient,4.0,,"The MRT is a clean efficient way to travel around Singapore. The stations are clearly marked and finding the right train is a breeze. The only problem we had was when getting off and finding the right access to the street we wanted to go to, thats when we got a little lost but the train system itself is amazing and well organised"
,,Spotless efficient and driverless,4.0,,"This has to be one of the most efficient clean and well air conditioned subway in the world.

Very reasonable on price covers a huge area and it's infrastructure helps walk between major areas with having to bear the humidity.

Oh a full 4G service in all areas."
,,Good system,5.0,,"A well thought-out and expanding system to speed your travel across the island. Busy at the expected times, especially in the city, but efficient and you don't have to wait long between trains. Clean and safe, of course., This is Singapore."
,,Great for tourists,5.0,,"Being close by to the MRT on our visit we bought a card and off we went.
This can be used on all public transport and once you pay a 1 off fee of $10SGD you load it with what any amount and keep topping it up.The card lasts for 5 years.
East to navigate and we found most of the local travellers more than happy to assist us.
Highly recommend this if you visit Singapore ."
,,Best thing about Singapore,5.0,,"Bus or train. So well built and organised.Orchard Station and Delfi Orchard bus stop were our best friends. Getting tickets, signage and general facilities were great."
,,Perfect Way To See Singapore.,5.0,,"The MRT trains are the best way to get around Singapore. You can buy a card and then add a cash amount but don't put too much on it because it is so cheap to use. I stayed in Chinatown and from there to the airport; which takes about 50 minutes; cost me $2.00 off peak. The card can be used for trains and buses.
You can keep the card if you intend to travel back to Singapore or you can cash it in at one of the station offices to get your cash amount left on the card. The initial fee of around $7.00 for the card will not be refunded.
All trains lines are color coded so it is easy to find your way around.
Most of the train system is underground but there are some lines that move above ground during the trip so that you can get a great view of the outer areas of Singapore.
A lot of the train lines take you to shopping centers but if not it is very easy to follow the brightly lit walkways to your destination."
,,The best in the world,5.0,,"Not too many transport networks claim a 2 minute delay as a ""delay"" but the SIngapore MRT is an awesome and efficient beast. Definately world class and a must use for travellers and locals alike."
,,Super easy and efficient,5.0,,"The SMRT was superbly easy to use!! Made my Singapore visit an absolute breeze! Also, super affordable!!"
,,Great system,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, clean, comfortable and trains come along often. We used the Tourist Pass and found it excellent value for money."
,,The BEST in the world,5.0,,Amazed to see the infra and the spending on the MRT.. The best connectivity a govt can provide to its people.. Automatic and well maintained.. Deserved to call the best.. The LRT connect to the MRT and the Single entry to Single exit even after passing/changing 3-4 MRT lines is superb..
,,Fantastic travel anywhere so cheap!!!!,5.0,,"Used the MRT for 5 days travelled all around so cheap and much faster than by road easy recharge ,defiantly they way to travel in singapore"
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,5.0,,"So easy to use, excellent signage and cheap too. if using more than once or twice get the rechargeable card, which makes it cheaper and some refund what you don't use. great idea."
,,Primate City,5.0,,"Singapore is quite the epitome of modern architectural beauty! The people of Singapore are friendly, and their airport may likely enchant you when you arrive in this thriving city. With a subway system so efficient, you can run in and out of Changi, in no time and still be on time for your connecting flight-- I did it!"
,,Most efficient and organised metro.,5.0,,Was impressed with this metro system. Runs like clock work.Seems like every station has public facilities which is rear in London NYC or Other European ones.
,,The fastes way around,5.0,,You will never regret to make use of SMRT -- The only problem is when you travel from the airport you need to change train -- this must have something to do with the taxi service from the airport (surely to avoid a competition) as the station is working and there is no reason to change. MRT will get you around most of the island and the busses will do the rest - it is working like a clock :-) Never had any issues and the payment is swift - if you purchase a prepaid card
,,Great System,5.0,,"Loved travelling on this, such a clean and efficient system. Easy to use and signage is easy to follow. Would certainly recommend using this to get around."
,,Lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to cover many places in 1 single day, keep the SMRT as the only option. Check for the day pass, it will be economical. It is clean, quick & supportive."
,,This is the way to travel,5.0,,"Having come from a country of rubbish public transport the MRT is superb.
Buy a card $12, $5 for card and $7 worth of credit on the card. Topping up easy as. Fares really cheap, trains are spotless and not noisey. Peak times its standing room only and seats for the elderly."
,,Wowww.!,5.0,,"This is Wow for me and i heard that there is no driver for the said SMRT service, and i was really wondering for the time in which this train operates.. Really Rapid and as a country Singapore encourages public transportation, hence we went all away in SMRT ..!"
,,Best in this part of the world,5.0,,"This is clearly the best public transport system not just in Singapore, but in whole of the Asia - pacific region."
,,Singapore MRT is amazing,5.0,,"SG MRT is amazing as coming from my 7 year old son ,as it's always on time, clean and connects the whole city of Singapore."
,,Convenient and Cheap!,5.0,,"I am a big fan of well maintained public transportion. Singapore did not disappoint in that regard.
The MRT was definitely the cheapest option and you get a chance to be with the locals. However, note that public transport in general is cheap in Singapore. Even the taxis are cheap (in relation to the western countries)
Would definitely recommend using it!"
,,Strict in rules,4.0,,Comfortable and punctual. But take care of not eating and drinking and other rules in the metro. Otherwise you will get a fine.
,,convenient,5.0,,"Whenever I travel, I love taking the public transit, I believe it is the best way to explore a city. I feel that if you are always taking taxis or anything like that, you kind of miss the city. If you take trains, buses and your own two feet you can definitely cover more of the details of a city.

SMRT was very convenient and it could take you all over Singapore, from local neighborhood areas, to airport, to tourist attractions. Very cheap and easy to use.

I recommend to buy a card instead of buying individual tickets before each trip. I think it cost around $15, and had $10 loaded on it."
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"The MRT in Singapore is the easiest underground system I have ever used, puts the London Underground to shame, so clean as well! Definitely use when visited, will also save you a lot!"
,,Wow,5.0,,"SMRT is such a cool & economical way of traveling throughout Singapore. Be anywhere in earliest possible time & any number of times. You get a 3 day pass that can be used in MRT(Metro) or Bus for just 30 Singapore dollar out of which 10 are refundable when the card is returned.
No need of taking a cab, enjoy SMRT."
,,Review of SMRT,5.0,,"Awesome, reliable and on time service. The interconnectivity is awesome and part of teh MRT is underground. You can virtually get to any destination in Singapore using the MRT. There is also a SGD 12 pass available which can be refilled at any of the MRT station. The stations are well maintained"
,,SMRT shows just how good urban transit can be!,5.0,,"Clean, efficient,safe,economic, and fast are great words to describe the SMRt. You may sometimes have to walk and change levels to transition to your next train but the service is still great. If you stay longer than 3-5 days get an EZ link pass. Fast and easy to use, what else can you ask for?"
,,"Convenient, less advertising",5.0,,The added 2 new lines make it convenient more than ever There is less advertising which make the place less colorful and less exciting
,,Great transport system,5.0,,"Wow!! On time every time, quick, clean, and easy to understand timetables. We travelled everywhere on the underground and always safe and easy."
,,Nice Experience,5.0,,Visited with a family of 7. Have travelled quite a lot across however the Singapore MRT was a nice experience. We travelled just once. Advisable to buy travel pass as it works cheaper and saves time to get tickets from the machine.
,,Great transport and easy to use,4.0,,"Convenient, cheap and regular public transport and go all the way to the a/port.. Air con in trains work well. Staff were helpful. The one thing against SMRT was the 1/2hr . hot and humid walk with luggages from the Cruise Terminal to Marina South Pier SMRT. Need to look into this..."
,,Transport,5.0,,"Easy access to trains & busses, each has a short delay between them. Tickets can be bought in all the railway stations. On arrival in Singapore I would advise you to get a ticket with about $10/ $15.00 on it depends on how many times you will require the use of same. In 9 days I used up $15.00. Travelled every day either on the busses Or the train."
,,It is lovely,5.0,,Much cleaner and safer than any train station I've been perplex proof safety. People waiting to board train you have not chat. Intergation ohh it puts my country to shame. Beautiful people you should be proud
,,Singapore mass rapid transit,4.0,,Am local here in Singapore. Efficient if no breakdown. Easy to travel. Avoid peak hours 8-9am and 6-7pm
,,So efficient and easy to use - get around Singapore FAST!,5.0,,"This mode of transport is excellent! Clean, efficient, on time, reasonably priced - you may not see Singapore sights as you travel, but you can get where you want to go in a fraction of the time it takes by bus. As with most underground transport facilities, the routes are clearly marked, passengers are considerate and courteous of fellow travellers and it feels very safe. Didn't use it on our last trip to Singapore, but certainly benefitted this time (stayed near Little India) and would certainly make use of it again in future."
,,Main transport for our stay in Singapore,5.0,,"Easy to use, intuitive, cheap and a very good reach of places all over the city. Clean fast and safe."
,,So convenient,4.0,,"The public transit system is very convenient, inexpensive and easy to use. The staff was helpful. We used the train over two days."
,,"Cheap, easy and very little wait",5.0,,"I don't think you'll find an easier to use mass transit system. The Changi (airport) station had an attendent that helped newcomers use the machine and shown once, it's easy to use again and again. Amazingly cheap. Clean and comfortable."
,,Great way to see Singapoe,5.0,,"Was visiting friends in Singapore last March. Cant recommend the MRT enough. Clean, helpful staff, frequent service, train every 4minutes off peak!!! And great value for money. 9days travelling around the city cost me €9-€10."
,,Underground trains,5.0,,"Cheap, fast, clean, safe, This is the way to travel in Singapore. You buy a train card for $5.00, and load money on it. When you leave you get the balance of your loaded money back. The $5.00 for the card does not come back, so the card is not suitable for a single journey"
,,Excellent transportation,5.0,,"For the transportation in the Singapore city , do use this medium as this is the most cheapest as compared to other mode of transportation ."
,,A joy to use,5.0,,"Big city, family with 3 young kids, trying the MRT. disaster right? Not at all. With taxis so expensive in Singapore plus the long waits it is so wonderful to have the MRT system. All the signs make it so easy to navigate and now they have the tourist 1, 2, or 3 day passes (which includes the buses) which are well worth the money and take away the confusion of buying single trip tickets. Many of the stations are beautifully designed and all are meticulously cleaned. And most of the trains are not crammed full of people either. I only wish we would have gotten the pass sooner so we would have used it more often."
,,A good way to see Singapore,4.0,,Not all places are connected as some lines are undergoing repair but still it is the best way to travel around Singapore.
,,A cheap and efficient way to travel around,5.0,,"With the network of MRT lines, you and your family can enjoy a comfy and cost saving ride to almost all the places of interest. Clear signages with 4 official languages and friendly staff to orientate you around. One could take these trains with ease."
,,Recommend this,5.0,,"Easy to buy tickets, but make sure that you have less than 5 Singapore dollars in change. I though I could put a 10 dollar bill into the ticket machine, and it rejected it. I had to fish around for enough coins/small change to buy a round trip ticket from the airport to the hotel. Otherwise, using the MRT is how i got around Singapore for 4 days."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"A very efficient, clean and easy to follow transport system. Trains arrived on time, it was easy to change lines, and staff and other passengers were always happy to help out when n doubt"
,,Best transportation,5.0,,I like to ride MRT to go around Singapore. Convenient and easy to get it as they have many lines which covered most of Singapore areas
,,Network,5.0,,The grid that hold all Singapore together.They have reached every corner.It is fast and convenient..
,,World class,4.0,,Singapore does maintain the stations and trains very well however I do remember 29 years ago it was much much cleaner. Still one of the best
,,REAL RAPID,5.0,,"But for the walk inside the terminals and stations particularly for first time tourists and users, it is a joy of life."
,,5 min wait at the most,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, easy to navigate. Never more than a 5 minute wait. I wish Australia had a public transport system like this."
,,The most efficient and effective transportation at an affordable cost,5.0,,"Easy to travel around almost all over Singapore. Effective, efficient and cost effective. There is NO extra charge for Airport line as in New York or New Delhi or many other cities, the same MRT ticket takes you upto the airport terminals. I am impressed and recommend for anyone travelling to Singapore."
,,Advanced and Quick,5.0,,"SMRT is one of Singaporean corporations working on its transportation. It is definitely up to its name ""Mass Rapid Transit"". All MRT stations has screens indicating the arriving time of the next two trains and it's always less than 5 mins. The stations charge differently during peak and off-peak hours and if you go in and come out of the same station, you'll still be charged about S$0.77. I seldom travel during peak hours, but in my opinion, the stations never get too crowded. SMRT trains are auto-pliot and I'm quite comfortable with the speed."
,,MESMERISING,5.0,,"IF you ask me this is the most beautiful thing enjoyed in singapore. Zoo and Water games AND rides are at many places, but the MRT or SMRT in place in Singapore is really well managed. We Indians have only seen Mumbai locals as MRT or DELHI METRO as MRT. This MRT is uncomparable to any of our metros. Highlights are (1) Very neat and clean (2) Driverless at few places (3) No rush (4) Punctual in timings (5) Stations have all amenities (6) Utmost care even for the disabled (7) Very high frequency of trains and buses and SMRT cabs (8) Very reasonably priced (9) Ezee card swipe makes no hustle of buying tickets anytime (10) Adequate machines to add on to your card value (11) many stations are 7 floor down in the earth, but all airconditioned and hence you dont feel fatigue (12) Route maps and signboards in plenty, hence a first time visitor can also roam across singapore without any help from anyone. (13) Conveninece marker with SAFETY FIRST AND ALWAYS. The thing I most enjoyed in Singapore was this MRT rather than UNIVERSAL STUDIOS OR SENTOSA ISLAND OR an other thing. There is much more to this"
,,One of the best,5.0,,"one of the best mrt i used so far, but please avoid rush hours, very crowded especially the green & red lines."
,,Always love use mrt when iam in singapore,4.0,,"Is clean ,cheap price , look new ,very easy and get connected to everywhere ,always love use this transportation when iam in singapore .im use eazy link.and that card work for 5 years.you can tap in bus too and can top up with machine in mrt stasion.they have lift and many escalators and they staff very helpfull. make your life so easy.really great"
,,Family Holiday,5.0,,Very good mode of transport within Singapore. We bought three day Tourist passes. Has instructions everywhere so cant get lost.
,,Fantastic transport system,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is rapid, clean, safe and cheap and you can get to most places on it. Interchanges are easy and every thing is well sign posted."
,,Singapore Mass Transit,5.0,,"During each of my many visits to Singapore I've used their Mass Transit system, either Taxis, Busses or the Subway. In all cases they were very efficient, reliable, clean and inexpensive."
,,Very clean and efficient,5.0,,"If only all train systems in major Australian cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are like this! They are clean, efficient and not too crowded. You can basically go anywhere by train and it is so cheap! You feel safe travelling the network. Unlike most European cities, there are toilets in most stations - clean and staffed all the time!"
,,Great to use,5.0,,"The underground is cheap, easy to use and extremely efficient. It's a bit confusing to buy your ticket but really good service"
,,Getting around Singapore Easy on MRT,5.0,,"Often finding the nearest MRT station is so easy it beats other forms of transportation including cab. Look for street level MRT signage or download the MyTransport app. Even if you are not familiar with the system, there are clear color-coded routes and maps as well as an MRT employee at each stop to answer questions. The trains are very clean, modern and safe. LED signage illuminate the map and next stop while on board. This is a tourist friendly transportation system and quite reasonably priced. Give it a try- it's one of the best mass transit systems in the world!"
,,Slick transport,5.0,,"It's efficient, clean, smooth and well-used by locals and tourists alike so be prepared for it to be very busy during peak hours."
,,Efficient and convenient,5.0,,Travelling to and from the airport and in the inner city the SMRT is the way to go. Taxis in Singapore are expensive (compared to Thailand) and can be very difficult to hail at certain times of the day
,,Cheap and convenient,4.0,,"This was considerably cheaper than cab and was very convenient as the connectivity was excellent. I just went across 2 lines, the downtown line and east West line and it worked out very well for us."
,,Not recommended for tourists,3.0,,"Well connected to many parts of Singapore. Expect extreme crowd during peak hours Mon-Fri 7am-10am / 5pm-8pm and weekends. Trains are clean overall but seats are limited. Fares are slightly higher compare to bus services. For short stopover in this little country, please save your travelling time by taking the widely available and affordable taxis, uber or grab instead."
,,"Very convenient, cheap, safe and clean.",5.0,,"Travelling with the MRT in Singapore is great! Very convenient, easy, safe, cheap and clean. Even if you're travelling with a stroller there's no problems. Friendly staff that helps you if you have any questions. Kids under 90 cm (and/or under a certain age - think it's 7 but I'm not sure) travel for free."
,,Good MRT - Just tried once,5.0,,MRT is clean and the symbols are well placed. I bought a one way ticket to test it. Nice ride and had few chats with passengers.
,,Transpo,3.0,,I love how singapore handle tourists like us where it was easily accessible for us a foreign commuters.
,,Cheapest Mode of transport to move around Singapore,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is one the best way to move around in Singapore,also to mention it is cheap.You'll find the MRT staff very helpful as they assist and advice you whenever you need them,also you'll get the map of Singapore on the airport. One of the cleanest railway system i have ever seen.
You're not allowed to eat or drink anything inside the metro."
,,Well organised and so easy to understand,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is truly easy to understand. I leave in a country that has no MRT which means i'm not used to that mode of transport but SMRT is very practical. Every thing is explained and easy to understand.
At each station you have an MRT map that ease your move to other station. Even the fare cost is shown. You also have tourist card, full day cards and others that you just top up and hop you go.
Singapore people are very disciplined in the stations. Most of them will wait for passengers to hop off before entering the metro and they will all use the left side of the escalator to allow those in a hurry to move on more quickly.
In most stations there are maps that will guide which exit you should take to go to your destination and above that there are very helpful officers ready to give any information required.
Travelling in SMRT is truly easy."
,,First class subway,4.0,,massive subway transporting thousands of commuters daily to work! buy the stored-up value card and travel around the city state.
,,"Clean, punctual and user friendly",5.0,,Having been used to the appalling public transport system in Melbourne Australia we found the SMRT to be excellent. Well mapped and easy to use. Travel felt safe. Clean conditions.
,,Travelling on MRT,4.0,,"For Tourists visiting Singapore, do consider travel by MRT trains which is fast , efficient and cheap.

One can buy a Singapore Tourist Pass for one to three days . One day pass costs S$10/- two days, S$16/- and S$20/- for three days . This is for unlimited travel on the train and buses. Many of the train stops will lead you right into the shopping centers which is most convenient for tourists.

All signages are in English and Mandarin with announcements made in both languages before every stop.

The MRT is also accessible to wheelchair users too.

The passes are sold at many MRT stations like Changi Airport , Orchard , Chinatown, City Hall, Raffles Place and at Bayfront.

Do try the MRT on your next visit to Singapore."
,,Pleasure to travel by MRT,5.0,,Really enjoyed traveling underground in Singapore. Beautifully air conditioned! We got the Singapore 3 day pass for $30 ($10 of which is a deposit). See the images for details on where you can buy the pass. It's not available at all stations and equally can't be returned at all stations. Make sure you know where to bring it back for your deposit! The pass even takes you out to Changi Airport and you can return it there for your deposit. Maybe we never really experienced it at peak work times but it was never packed and we could always get a seat.
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Reliable, clean and takes you to most places and if it doesn't I am pretty sure there will be enough connecting buses to complete your journey or a short taxi ride."
,,Low waiting and cheap,5.0,,It is so cheap to get around Singapore and the SMRT makes it fast with like max 5mins for a train. They are also very cheap.
,,Traveling using our MRT,4.0,,"MRT in Singapore are fastest and best travelling partners.
The only bad thing was never never never take the MRT/Train on a peaked hour!
Either you are not able to enter, or you will be squeezed in it. HAHA!!
After all, our MRT in Singapore was much cleaner, faster and better than other transport in Singapore."
,,a very efficient sytem,5.0,,"being a first time visitor in Singapore,the train system has been very very useful and efficient. Arrives on time, not crowded and very easy to use."
,,Most efficient transport,5.0,,Get a 24 hours pass for Sgd 10 and make unlimited trips. It connects the whole city and is very efficient.
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,4.0,,"Although there have been quite a bit of complaints lately on the SMRT, it is still the best way to travel around in Singapore. For those who have travelled around in other less advance countries, they will definitely agree that the SMRT is one of the best. Its fast, comfortable and effective, not to mention the few hiccups once in a while. So do treasure what we have! Keep it up, SMRT!"
,,Fast Efficient and Clean,5.0,,"As always the MRT is clean, fast and efficient and inexpensive. The wait for trains is around 2 minutes sometimes it can be 6 minutes but for us that only happened once."
,,There's always room for improvement,3.0,,some trains dont have any air-con i feel suffocated sometimes. but overall is nice cause of the consistency of the train intervals. We all know that the government have improvement plans on it. Keep it up.
,,Excellent Service,5.0,,"Very clean, convenient, excellent service. all station have good facility. Value for money. Don't buy Unlimited day pass. no use as each trip will cost you only 0.77 $ to 1.5 $ max so for 2 to 3 trips day pass is not recommended."
,,Good but quite over priced,5.0,,"SMRT is one of the best mode of transportation in Singapore, but quite over priced. For 3 people above, its always better to hire a taxi."
,,DAILY MEANS OF TRANSPORT,3.0,,"Well Singapore has come a very long way in progress and seems now we have excess to every corner of Singapore once all the line are operational> I must say the government has done a great job in doing so to tackle traffic flow on a little red dot but being the fact it not only attracts forgiven investor but foreign talent as well the would not be surprise instead of the raids being jam now is human traffic jam in train especially the peaks hours that include the school holidays and others festive holidays as well.
You can still see the cleanliness of the train cabin each day when you travel but we can't ignore the defects found due to the age of the trains and recently theres often break downs and delay of the trains thus giving another added headache and contingency plan is always n place to take such ""surprises""
Lastly,still effective travelling on the trains where all stations has user friendly kiosk for purchase of tickets and the attendant are ever friendly should you need directions and helping hand"
,,"Clean, cheap and often crowded",5.0,,"It's pretty much the way to travel round Singapore quickly unless you want to enjoy the views of the streets (use the buses for that!) Remember to stand to the side to allow people to get off before you board and if you end up sitting in a coloured seat, you're expected to get up and offer it to pregnant ladies, the elderly or injured ( unless you're one of those yourself).
Buy yourself an EZ pass from a ticket booth and top up as you need using the automated kiosks - they take cash or card and a minimum top up is S$10. You can get individual and return tickets but that works out much more expensive and the EZ card is integrated with the bus system, so it's great for getting to anywhere - some sights are better served by buses anyway.

Remember to stand on the left, walk down on the right when on the escalators and no food or drink anywhere on public transport or stations - you'll hear the announcements to remind you. Very efficient but some routes are really packed at peak periods, so avoid those if you can. Toilets available at every mrt."
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,"A great way to travel around Singapore. Very good connection to other mode of transport , like bus etc. Love to travel in except reserved seat are not observed by the younger commuters"
,,Mrt,5.0,,"Really convenient and easy to navigate! Once u get the map ( Google or look for an app) u will see it's easy much easier then London or New York or one of the bigger cities ... cos Singapore is much smaller and the train lines are less complicated.. lol!! Buy the tourist card ( good value ) or u can make like the locals and get a TOP up card. U can buy at the mrt control stations at the card counter or by automated machines. Go que at the counter if it's ur first time and ask the counter personnel to recommend a card that meets ur needs.
Really well connected train system. You can take the train from Changi Airport terminal three or terminal two.. straight to your hotel if u dun have too much luggage. If not take a Uber or download grab taxi.. a popular cab app in south east Asia."
,,Cheap and efficient.,5.0,,"Avoid during rush hour if you can since it gets so packed. Otherwise, public transit in Singapore is quick, efficient, and excellent."
,,Best connection,5.0,,It's so convenience to use SMRT to connect around the city. Price is cheap and flexible to use. Smooth.
,,Best in the world?,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT (underground rail) system is an enormous credit to the city and the nation. Essentially six main lines, the SMRT is, in the humble opinion of this reviewer, the best in the world. The trains and stations are scrupulously clean and access and egress from stations is almost invariably by escalator (rather than stairs). Security is evident but never intrusive and there are MRT staff everywhere to assist and advise travelers. Trains run never more than a few minutes apart, ticket machines are fairly intuitive, signposting throughout the system is excellent and the MRT map is very easy to follow. Trains can be fairly packed at peak times and on popular routes but, most other times, overcrowding is not a problem. The Singapore MRT is not only safe and efficient, but travel on it is actually a pleasure."
,,Clean and Generally Reliable,4.0,,"Compared to the many countries where I have taken city trains or mass rapid transit trains, Singapore's rates well despite the occasional breakdowns. Some of the best are in Asian cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore."
,,Best way to move around Singapore,5.0,,"Absoloutely the cleanest underground rail system one could see, always efficient, and great murals to view"
,,Worth the ride,5.0,,"If you are a single/ couple traveller, getting around Singapore on the MRT will be a cheaper option. If you can avoid the peak office hours, the trains are not very crowded and you can reach the destination quicker. The stations are welllit and safe as well."
,,Excellent public transport,5.0,,"Entire experience with MRT is excellent. They are always on time, very tourist friendly and safe. Walking within the MRT station is also safe and easy with entire premise being air conditioned. For tourist, use the Singapore EZ Link pass for 3 days which costs 20$ plus refundable 10$ deposit."
,,Well done. Easy with Google,5.0,,"Excellent signage to get you where you're going...also helpful attendants scattered around the stations. I've tried a few other apps, but Google Maps seem to work best."
,,Trains and buses easy to use,5.0,,"Go to a station with a ticketing office and get a Singapore tourist pass for 1 day is $10, 2 days $16 or 3 days for $20. $10 deposit is refunded when you return the card. See lots of Singapore using trains and buses."
,,Well organised transportation,5.0,,Easy and cheap transportation option in Singapore. Most of the time we used this transportation. Next time we will use it again.
,,8 days holiday in Singapore,5.0,,"We just spent 8 days in Singapore and used the SMRT at all times, multiple times...why... because was so easy to use and cheap! Excellent train system! Can't get lost, it's safe, very well organised. Same card can be use for busses as well. Card cost $5 then you load the money for a and off you go! Card last 5 years. We loaded $ 20 and still have $ 5 left for the next visit. Thank you Singapore!"
,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"SMRT was a very convenient way to get around Singapore. It is immaculately clean. The maps are very clear and if you have any questions there are information booths with helpful people. The only problem we had is that you need exact change to get tickets. We had to leave the station, buy something at a store to get smaller bills before we could buy our tickets."
,,Really easy to Use and you can pay with your credit card,5.0,,"clean, we'll organize and unexpectedly confortable with air conditioning that help you to get a way of the extreme heat of Singapore

You can pay with a cash or credit card at the teller machines near all entryway. Be aware that you nos likely en up getting into or out of a shopping mall and get your bearing will be challenging."
,,Second to None Really,5.0,,Impressive transit system which is way up there with places like Hong Kong and Berlin. Easy to negotiate your way around.
,,Always on time,4.0,,"The Singapore MRT System is really helpful for tourists to get around in the city. Always reliable, and always on time. The route map is also easy to understand."
,,Vacation,5.0,,If in Singapore the best and cheap way to travel is by MRT Though it has various lines they are interconnected at certain stations. And the passenger service counters are very helpful There are maps at all stations to guide you as to the route to be taken for your destination
,,Amazing and an easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"We covered a lot of miles on the SMRT! The system is easy to use, fast, efficient and clean. We bought a three day tourist pass, not sure if it would have been cheaper to purchase tickets as we went but for the convenience of hopping on and off the trains and buses it was well worth it.

Everyone was very help if we weren't sure about which line to take. Be careful at peak hour, the trains are very busy so expect it to be very crowded."
,,Easy to navigate and can get everywhere with ease,5.0,,"Gets crowded in rush hour, but not to crazy levels The app is a godsend, can plan your entire trip with no worries"
,,So very easy to get around,5.0,,"The two things you hear about Singapore are ""hot"" and ""expensive""... the MRT is neither.

Get a visitors pass for however many days you are there for - we grabbed a 3 day one for $38. We definitely got our money's worth - getting to Marina Bay, Chinatown, Altitude 63 and the night safari. Only word of caution - last trains run around midnight during the early part of the week!!"
,,A must for the Singapore traveller,5.0,,"Highly recommend buying a travel pass for 1 to 3 days. It's basically like the one day travel card in the U.K. But can be used on all lines and also buses.

You get a book when you buy the tickets that highlights tourist stops, where to alight and what exit to take out of the station.

The cards are really good value.

Please note these cards cannot be obtained at all stations but are clearly marked online.

Trains and stations are very clean and very safe day or night."
,,Glad to have!,5.0,,"This MRT system is clean, timely, and cheap. It takes some studying to figure out which way to go using the maps or people provided at the stations, but you easily get the hang of it."
,,The way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has about the easiest and best subway transportation in the world. As a visitor, I recomend getting a hotel withing an easy walk of a SMRT station and use it to get around. Its cheap, you can buy a tourist pass or just pay for individual rides. Trains have lit up maps showing where you are and where you are going so even if you are a novice, you cant go wrong and you get to see an underground world that few tourists see. I just spent a week there and caught most of the attractions using nothing but the SMRT. The only attraction I would recommend a bus for is the Zoo attractions. See my evaluation on Night Safari and I will tell you how to get there."
,,Most convenient and affordable way to traverse the island!!,5.0,,"One of the best, punctual and reliable metro systems of the world. Singapore MRT is also extremely affordable. Highly recommend to buy an ezLink smart card (which can also be used on buses) goṛ a seamless and effortless transport.

The MRT map is self explanatory. The interchanges are marked clearly and announcements are also made in the train.
For tourists, it is recommended to buy an ezLink card instead of the 3 days pass which cost 20$ +10$ deposit."
,,Clean rapid and easy to use,5.0,,"It's possible to buy a tourist 2 or 3-day pass. 3-day pass costs 30$ to use on bus or train, and when you hand it in at the end of the last day (when you get to the airport for example) you get 10$ back. Buy from the tourist window in the metro station."
,,I like this MRT,5.0,,"MRT in Singapore is the first public transport I use outside my country. And I really like it. Its clean, punctual, easy to go every where. After Singapore , I use many public transport in Hongkong, Bangkok, London , New York, Tokyo and many more. But MRT Singapore is the one I really love!"
,,Best way to get around Singapore,4.0,,"Many people when visiting a new city avoid the local public transit system - I head straight for it and Singapore is no exception. If you want a convenient and economical way to get around Singapore the SMRT is a great way to go.

Buy a ticket, load up some cash on it and off you go - the card can also be used at many small stores and attractions."
,,"Efficient, spotlessly clean and good value!",5.0,,"On our recent stopover in Singapore we purchased a 3 day tourist pass for the MRT. It cost $30 each, and we got a $10 each deposit back at the end of the trip. We used the pass to go to and from the airport, the zoo (going to the closest station and then getting an $8 cab), the Botanic gardens and Gardens by the Bay.
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the MRT. We never had to wait longer than 3 mins for a train and the whole system was really easy to navigate, had great signage and was incredibly clean."
,,Clean. Safe. Easy to use.,5.0,,Lots of clear information to make traveling in the city easy. Very clean. Helpful staff if you have questions.
,,Awesome way to get about town.,5.0,,"We used the MRT all the time it was awesome. We got the tourist card. It was $30 for 3 days unlimited travel and you get $10 back if you give the card back at the end of the 3 days. there is no worries about how much each fare is and if you need to top up.

It is clean and run well but there are a good few rules that you have to follow."
,,Make use of the MRT,5.0,,"The MRT is almost always runs without incident, and runs extremely regularly and is always comfortable and clean"
,,Great cheap way to travel,5.0,,Buy a MRT card for $5 with $7 loaded and it will last for days as most trips are about $1.50. All colour coded so all you need to do is find what colour line you are on and where you need to go to. Great way to move around Singapore. Cards can also be used on the buses which are sometimes faster but not always as easy to understand.
,,Clean and toddler friendly,5.0,,"Going around with mrt is a cheap and convenient way to go around unless when it rains. It's really toddler-friendly. If you have your little ones in a stroller, you can easily find a lift. I'd prefer to go by mrt compared to taxi as I didn't have to fold my stroller (if you go alone with your toddler this really counts as not all taxi driver would offer help). The mrt also connects you to major attractions"
,,Efficient,5.0,,"Great easy to access MRT system. Well connected within the city, but not all areas, easy to jump on an transfer to your destination."
,,It's an underground system...,3.0,,I'm struggling to understand why this is classed as a visitor attraction?! It's just an underground rail system!

,,Best way to travel,5.0,,It's the most economical & the most convenient way of travel in Singapore. There are trains every 5 mins. It's clean & the location maps makes an not so experienced traveller find where he wants to go with ease. I loved travelling in the MRT
,,Brilliant transport system,5.0,,"Absolutley fantastic underground metro rail system. Inexpensive, clean, timely and easy to follow. Commuters are polite and everyone seems to know the rules!"
,,Reliable Clean and Fast,5.0,,"Coming from London where a tube line is down every day, the spacious, clean carriages of the Singapore MRT are a pleasure to travel in. The system does get full at peak hours but the close spacing of trains and affordable convenient air conditioned travel it offers are a world apart from the antiquated underground systems of other parts of the world."
,,Efficient and reliable transport,4.0,,"The MRT is extremely efficient and reliable and a great mode of transport, due to the connectivity, cleanliness and reliability but I would not deem it as an attraction. It is inspiring for some people from around the globe who do not have such an efficient system but it's fundamentally well-connected and relatively affordable transport."
,,Get your Ez link card,5.0,,Wonderfully planned MRT and Road transport system. Pride and joy to every Asian. You can travel the breadth and length of the country in one hour. That is what I did with my EZ link card purchased at Changi airport.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,The MRT was very easy to use and other countries could learn from this system. Every sign was also in english and very well sign posted.

,,Singapore SMRT - Great Way to Get Around Singapore and Easy!!!,5.0,,"Love the fact that you can practically go anywhere with the SMRT. Information on their brochures is clear and easy to read with their coloured map showing their stations and route. There's plenty of shops and food around as you walk through the SMRT to get from one place to the next, making your travel an enjoyable one too. It's also a quick and cheap form of transport, their seats are comfortable and most people are polite and orderly I found."
,,Australia should be embarrassed at the state of their trains compatred to the MRT,5.0,,"This is how trains should be Safe, clean, quiet and efficient. Make sure you have change for the machines though to save you having to walk to ask for change."
,,Uber efficient,5.0,,"Super clean, efficient, on time, clean, did I say clean? Trains always on time, very convenient, air conditioned, wifi."
,,Fast and efficient,4.0,,"Can go pretty much anywhere in Singapore on the SMRT, it's fast and efficient but can be a little confusing till you get the hang of it. Need to swap mostly at least once to get to destination even if it's not far.Just soo many escalators and lines but once you do it a few times it's ok."
,,Singapore Transport,5.0,,"The transport in Singapore is just so easy and quick, plenty of trains as they run every coup,e of minutes. Singapore is a very easy city to navigate on public Transport and is quite cheap."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a great way to get around. Clean, cheap and the trains run so frequently it puts other cities to shame."
,,The best way to travel,5.0,,"We discovered the MRT two days into trip, even though taxis are cheap in Singapore after spending about $60 in one day we decided to travel with the MRT, which is very efficient, fast, clean, air-conditioned, and you can travel around with ease. You go down to these huge MRT stations, nice and cool, you don't have to wait too long for a train, and you can basically travel anywhere you want, and if you get on the wrong train, easy just to get off and correct yourself. We bought a 3 day pass for $30 SGD and at the end of the 3 days you get $10 back. 1 day pass is $20 and 2 days is $26, bargain."
,,Everywhere you want to go - efficiently!,5.0,,"Singapore has gradually implemented an excellent mass transit system and between subway / train and bus you can get anywhere on the island quite quickly. Coupled with reasonably prices taxis, getting around is the least of your worries on a visit to Singapore."
,,Connecting Singapore - fast & reliable,5.0,,"Singapore is known for its public transport efficiency. Can't get a cab - no problem... take the MRT / LRT. Connecting you from East to West, North to South. So convenient. We did not have to rely on taking a cab especially when there was more than 4 of us.."
,,Best among all,5.0,,Really great travel network. A good lesson for the rest of the world. Amazing speed Accessible from anywhere and everywhere
,,Excellent infra,4.0,,Singapore MRT I would say is the best in the world. Infact very well connected and can be easily accessed across the country. Some of the stations has some very beautiful view specially....Promenade.

,,"Reliable, safe & simple",5.0,,"Very efficient, and incredibly easy to use! The tourist pass is well worth the money if you are planning on hopping about to do the major tourist areas. It is extremely clean & tidy compared to London and New York systems, and feels much safer too."
,,Oh so easy,5.0,,And I am not great with underground. It's the easiest I have had to navigate. There are plenty of stations that cross over on several lines so it is easy to hop from one line to the other. Buy the travel pass - the journeys are really cheap then - the one you pay $5 for only needed to be loaded to $20 and it did me easy for two days of travelling around quite a lot. The staff at the ticket office are helpful and will tell you the best deal for you. And if you don't use all the credit they will refund. Amazing!
,,Rapid and Smart,4.0,,"The train is on time, clean, fast and really easy to reach. the workers are very welcome and informative."
,,Its EASY to use,5.0,,We found the mrt easy and cheap to use. None of our journeys cost more than 2 dollars so perhaps its not always worth getting a multi trip ticket. Instead …go for RETURN tickets. The MRT is easier to use than Londons tube:) It is also very clean and well signed..(free maps available) and announcements about where the next station is and where to change for certain destinations. we never waited more than 4 minutes for a train.
,,Best means of travel around Singapore,5.0,,This is a superb metro system but lacks stations in some hotel areas of Singapore. You can buy a 2 or 3 day travel pass and you get a refund if you return your plastic ticket at the end of the pass period.
,,"Very clean, neat and convenient",5.0,,You can get anywhere you need to go using this thing. A day's pass is $10 which is a real bargain. We got a 3 day pass for $30 each. It's the cheapest and most convenient way to see Singapore.

,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"Bought a 2 day tourist pass and got $$10 back on each card when we handed them in at the airport. Great for travelling around. Trains on time and so clean. Stops convenient for everywhere we wanted to go! One moan - the terminal nearest to the Cruise terminal does not take credit cards, neither can you buy the cheaper tourist pass - an opportunity missed there I think!!"
,,"Clean, Efficient and Cheap Way to Travel around Singapore",5.0,,"We were amazed by how cheap the prices were on the SMRT. Getting a card- a bit like the London Underground Oyster Card - was a good idea and saved us time.

No eating or drinking is allowed while in the trains or tunnels and walkways. The whole place was so clean with no buskers or litter.

Signage and announcements are in English so it was easy to work out where we needed to go and how and to realise when we had arrived at our destination.

An experience I am glad we had."
,,Efficient Train system,5.0,,"Very easy to get around. Buy a travel card, only bummer is to get a refund on your card it has to be done during business hours at only certain train stations. But it's worth it."
,,getting around Singapore,5.0,,"I was amazed by the efficiency of the MRT, You can reach everywhere with the MRT, easy to use, safe and locals are very disciplined making it a fast cheap and easy way to get around."

,,Only way to Travel!,5.0,,"Used the SMRT for our whole stay in Singapore, Excellent!! Cheap and efficient, and you can go almost anywhere you wish."
,,perfect system,5.0,,"I was tempted to buy the tourist card- for 2 days-, but with the hassle of deposit,and planning to walk a lot I decided not to and just bought single or return fares."
,,Great Value and So Convenient,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to get around Singapore. It is spotlessly clean, quick, efficient, frequent and runs like clockwork too! For visitors buy one of the stored value cards, then simply tap and go> Any unused stored value can be redeemed as you leave Singapore. Great service."
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,4.0,,It is cheap and connect most part of the city. Singapore is not very country so reaching one place to other did not take much time. One can buy a MRT card (which accepted every where i.e. Bus and other public places) and recharge. I was there for a week and it cost me around 20 SGD for whole week ravel.
,,Speedy travel,5.0,,"I have used MRT on many visits it is clean efficient and cheap. If you are staying longer than a couple o days buy an EZLink card which you can top up if you need. The MRT is expanding it routes so the whole island will be accessible soon. The roads are very busy and the MRT is all air conditioned.

you can get to most of the island"
,,Frequent and clean,5.0,,"Excellent service. Trains seem to be prompt and on time. Ticket machines don't accept large notes, but there was always a staff member available to give you change"
,,No issues,5.0,,Clean and efficient. Tourist pass was well worth the money. Be aware tourist ticket offices usually don't open until 10.00am.
,,A great way to ride.,4.0,,"The moment my children and I arrived in the airport, it was convenient to get to the hotel using the MRT. The train was located at the basement level adjoining the airport. For a first-timer, it was easy for us to learn riding on the train. The dispensing machine where we purchased our MRT card was user-friendly. Cost for the ride is cheap. The train was punctual, clean, air-conditioned and efficient. We practically rode it in all our trips around Singapore and never encountered any problem. A must for all first-time visitors, just like our family!"
,,The cheapest Mode of Transport,5.0,,"One of the best mode of communicating in singapore. Efficient, easily accessable and healthy. Healthy I mean there is lot of walking to be done to reach to one station from the main road.
For my 6 year old daugther, when we ask her the best thing she liked during our singapore visit, her answer is simple ""MRT""."
,,Good system but poor connections if you are a tourist,4.0,,"I’m not sure why a transportation method has ended up in the ‘things to do’ in Singapore but I’ll divulge. The Mass rapid transport system is a reference to Singapore subway system. Having been to a few major cities before this is fairly consistent with what you would expect – with a clean and well maintained system connecting all parts of the city. The prices were reasonable, often <2 dollars a trip although I elected to pay 20 dollars (30 dollars initially with a 10 dollar rebate) for a 3 day singapore tourist card. I never crunched the numbers and I'm not sure whether it would've been cheaper to pay for each individual journey instead but it was certainly convenient having the tap on tap off card. I must say as a tourist however I found the connections on the MRT highly inconvenient and inefficient. It seemed all the major tourist centres were on different transport lines and most journeys would involve at least 1 station change. Unfortunately unlike in Tokyo and London to change station would often involve walks of hundreds of metres long between platforms. This could turn a journey of only a handful of kilometres on the land overhead into a journey taking up to half an hour to an hour using the MRT. It was one of the few circumstances in which a taxi would have been quicker than the subway and I personally wasn’t a fan."
,,The only way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 7 days and would highly recommend using the MRT to get around, it is the easiest and most efficient way to travel in Singapore. The system is quite intuitive, everything is clean and well presented."
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,Air conditioning. Phone reception (and therefore phone data). General cleanliness. Sliding doors at all stations (so that you can't fall onto the track). Lights to indicate where you are along the line. Lights to indicate which side the doors will open at the next station. This is how a well executed underground system should be.
,,Punctual and fast,5.0,,One of the fastest mode of transport. Very punctual. People who travel are friendly and considerate.
,,Why can't we do it?,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, inexpensive and frequent services and easy to follow signage. This is how a MRT should be and it is nothing like the grubby London Underground. Definitely the best way to get around the city."
,,Cheap and clean,5.0,,"This is definitely the best way to travel around Singapore. Cheap, clean and air conditioned trains. Just make sure you don't drink anything when you're on it. The types of fines they have are ridiculous"
,,Well connected though a little dates,4.0,,Its very well connected. Amazingly quiet and well behaved people travel in this that is the hallmark of Singapore. The train is a bit noisy and slow as it is not a modern system. Safety of the passengers has been very well organised. Shopping at MRT stations is very well organised and one can have a full meal on the way.
,,Average train ride,3.0,,"The MRT in Singapore comprises of the East-West line, North-South line, Circle line, Downtown line and North-East line, for accessibility wise I must gave a full star of it since most of the places are covered. However since I need to take MRT to work everyday, it tend to breakdown a little frequent as well as I felt that especailly for East-West and North-South, these two lines broke down the most and the slowest of all. Though these two lines are the oldest, but the MRT systems in other countries are as old as Singapore but the efficiency is still there. For tourist, Singapore is easily accessible by train and there is not a need to take a cab. Nevertheless it is still the fastest public transport to access from one point to another."

,,Very well connected,5.0,,"I used MRT for local transport, even being first timer to Singapore I was able to use it without any Hassel. Just had a map in hand and you are done.

,,"A+ Convenient, Efficient and Cheap",5.0,,"The MRT is so convenient. It is fast and efficient and a very cheap to use. I bought an Ez card from the station. Great value for money and very easy to top up and use. Once you understand the system map (which takes no time to master) it makes traveling to all major tourist destinations extremely easy. 4 Lines cross cross the entire country. Red - North South, Green - East West, Blue - Downtown and Yello - Circle line. Trains come every few minutes, they are fast, clean and air conditioned. A lot of countries could learn a thing or two from Singapores MRT, they do it so well! Don't be afraid, after 2-3 rides you will be a pro and plenty of help available if you need it."
,,Great way to get around!,5.0,,"I am a lover of public transport, and the MRT is so very efficient! Connections work well, and you can get around most of the island in less than half an hour, unless you go far out, which may be 180 mins max, it is brilliant!"

MRT ground staff were very helpful giving guidance.
Tourist pass is the way to go."
,,Perfect mode to travel across Singapore,5.0,,"The system is so perfect that even a kid can travel alone. The literally have an underground city. Each metro line having interlinks with other lines, LRTs and bus. To avoid hassle free travel, you may buy a prepaid ezlink card which could be used in metro, train, bus and select taxis. This is one of the preferred mode for Singaporeans. Plus, the ticket prices are cheaper when you use this."

,,First learned to use MRT,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is very easy to understand

Her process is from Street down using Elevator / Escalator, Headed to Concourse Ticket.
In the concourse ticket, we read the instructions will use what color MRT, we go in and scan EZ Link / STP card
We are looking for Elevator / Escalator and go to MRT color platform we are headed
In the platform area, we look at the board, whether our MRT is on the left or right"
,,One of the best,5.0,,"Thoughtful layout, easy to follow instructions and reasonably priced, this is one of the best metro systems in the world. With 99 new stations coming by 2020 will be even more impressive and will probably extend to the Mandai lake area making the zoo easily accessible without using the bus. Don't waste time and money with taxies when in Singapore. Choose the day passes or top up cards depending on how much travel you plan to do."
,,Good way to get around,5.0,,The trains are clean and have air con a must as it is so hot. The system is quite easy to use but be prepared for long queues to buy tickets
,,Definitely not London!,5.0,,"Efficient, clean, on time, easy to use... A complete opposite to the London Underground basically and such an easy way to get around...."
,,SMRT -- The Pulse Of Public Transportation In Singapore,5.0,,"SMRT (The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit Corporation) is the sole operator of electric commuter trains in this island state. It also operates buses, taxis & provides automotive services. Railroad services is its core business.

The MRT has already succeeded in connecting all main CBDs (central business districts) like Orchard Road, City Hall, Raffles Place, Tanjung Pagar & Jurong areas. It also covers almost all town & district central areas. It is still developing, new lines are under construction. Later it will also connect itself & integrate with the Malaysia counterpart rail in Johor Bahru.

Most exciting is that the part that connects to Johor Bahru (popularly called ""JB"") will be HSR (High Speed Rail) that travels at 300 km/h (185 mph)!"
,,Just love it!,5.0,,We used this particular mode of transport extensively to commute when we were there. So much so that we had almost memorised the names of the stations and routes!

,,Really easy and convenient to use.,5.0,,"It's clean, cheap, and really easy to use. You can get almost anywhere. There is no pushing and shoving whilst getting on and off the trains, they have a system which allows passengers to alight the train before passengers get on. (Not like the London underground where it's push and shove. !!) Purchase a multi day pass, it works out cheaper and you don't have to queue and get separate journey tickets."
,,Best transportation in Singapore,5.0,,"It is BEST to take MRT while you are travelling in Singapore.
It is fast, clean, efficient, well-organised and always ON TIME. Well connected throughout the island as well as to Changi Airport.

Most career men and women are very dependent on it, so it will be very crowded during peak hours.

There are staffs in the MRT stations who will help when needed.

Tip : Eating and drinking are not allowed.  You will be fined if you do so."

,,Very efficient,5.0,,"I was so impressed by the SMRT. It is so clean, efficient and very easy to navigate.

,,Clean and convenient,5.0,,What a wonderful way to travel! You can hop on to the train which links to all the important sights in Singapore. It helps avoid the traffic and humidity. Way to go!
,,So easy and simple,5.0,,"I tend to find Asian transport better than western, the MRT is so easy to use.

If you are here for a few days (2-4) than single tickets (roughly $3) will be fine but anything else you'd probably be better off with a e-link card thing which you can top up etc

To use the machine all you need to do is choose by map where it will show you different lines or if you can choose by station and choose the area you want e.g. Chinatown

The trains come really frequently so if you are looking where to go don't worry abit missing the train because there's one just behind it!! There is only a handful of seats but because everything is quite close together it doesn't really matter"
,,Cheap and best way,5.0,,"Irrespective of how you are travelling around in Singapore, you should try how simple, efficient and cheap public transport exists in Singapore.Very user friendly too."

,,What an incredible system,5.0,,"Probably one of the best public transport systems in the world. Very clean, on time and not crowded, plus cheap."
,,Easy travel,5.0,,"I loved using the SMRT. Similar to the London Tubes, the SMRT was easy to use, easily accessible and on time.

I mostly travelled off peak hours which proved to be convenient. As a tourist it stops at most tourist locations which is always a good thing.

You can avail a tourist pass like I did. Took a 3 day pass and returned it to receive my SGD 10 back!

Love it and recommend it!"
,,Very fast,5.0,,More expensive than it used to be as you have to buy a card for S$5 but then your offpeak trips will be <$1. Trains every 3 to 5 minutes and still scrupulously clean (unlike some of Singapore now!)
,,Great Way To Get Around,5.0,,"You can get to and from almost everywhere with the public transport system. We got the 3 Day Tourist Pass for 20 SGD + 10 SGD deposit which you can get back when you return the card after use (even at the airport). The convienience of getting On and Off at will enables you to go anywhere without the hassle of having to buy a ticket as you go.

,,"Fast, Cheap and very Efficient",5.0,,"The MRT is a fast, cheap and very efficient way to travel in Singapore. By changing lines and utilising buses you can travel anywhere in Singapore without any hassles. The system is clean and easy to follow and caters for tourist attractions as well as the airport. The cost is very cheap and the travel card gives you updated money remining on it. I was surprised by the amount of people that are moved daily with the least amount of fuss or heartache. One of the best public transport systems in the world."
,,Efficient and effective,5.0,,Once we had a travel card we used the SMRT for local and long distance journeys. Fortunately station was close to hotel
,,Impressive train system,4.0,,"We stayed in Singapore for three weeks and used the trains and buses regularly.

The SMRT is first rate, on time, clean and with very helpful staff at stations.

Provided you have a good map to guide you at each destination, getting around Singapore is very easy.

TIP: One thing that soured our experience is that we bought a pass that had a refundable deposit ($10) which we were told we could collect at the airport. On our departure day we had difficulty locating where we could get the refund or anyone who could help us. We found out too late that it could only be collected from a location outside the airport terminal."
,,Cleanliness defined...,5.0,,"Efficiency, cleanliness, on time and organised....made our stay so much easier in terms of moving from place to place."
,,SMRT is the BEST!,5.0,,"SMRT is Awesome! The people who work there were so helpful, They no how to spot a Rookie Train Rider, like myself. The SMRT staff showed us where to board, how to buy tickets, Can t say enough good things about Singapores SMRT rode it everywhere!"

,,"Clean, Fast, Modern and Very Handy",4.0,,"Seen quite a few modern subway networks in Asia,..this is one of the best,...fast, convenient in regards to all areas you want to go in the CBD and in Singapore in general,...most importantly Marina Bay Sands and Changi Internatonal Airport.
Prices are excellent,...access is great,...trains run very much regularly and are even spacious whrn it is peak hour...Good Job Singapore,...liked it more than Hong Kong,..I find Hong Kong Metro is getting dated and not as smooth...
Guangzhou China STILL has one of the best and largest Metro's i have ever used and been on regularly."

,,Excellent system,5.0,,"Such a brilliant and cheap system. Very clean, organized, efficient. Trains run every 5 mins or so. The only drag are the long walks to connect to a different line but hey it's air conditioned so no big deal."
,,An excellent system - only needs to bite the bullet and stay open later,4.0,,"Clean, fast, generally (not 100% but generally) reliable, cheap, practical, expanding rapidly. Crowded of course. Now it's time for Singapore to grow up and run the subways all night - or at least until 2 AM!"
,,Top notch travel,5.0,,"Super quick, super safe, super clean MRT service. A little full at peak hours but well organised and trains about every five to ten minutes. Bought a three day pass which you can use for the trains and buses, which also provide an excellent service."
,,"Cheap, fast & reliable MRT",5.0,,"Use MRT to go everywhere in Singapore. It's quite cheap, fast and very reliable. An efficient way to explore the city. The MRT map is also easy to comprehend."

,,"Efficient, clean, safe service at a good price - MRT available from Changi airport",5.0,,"If arriving in Changi airport in Terminal 1 (T1) there is a free SkyTrain service that will take you to Terminal 3 (T3). From either Terminal 2 or 3 you can catch the MRT, just follow the signs.

The MRT is an easy way to get around Singapore. Signs are clear and there are employees who will help if needed.

I recommend taking a picture of the train line map with your phone, so you always have a map for quick reference. The ticket machines take 10 Singapore Dollars notes or smaller values, if you don't have anything smaller there is a counter that can provide change."
,,easy to use and very helpful staff,5.0,,"great for getting around , pay 10cents for the ticket but can load up to 6 trips on the one card and get 10cents discount on 6th ride, most rides around 1$ 60cents. so easy and clean to get around on the MRt"
,,"Clean, frequent and safe transport",5.0,,"This is one of the best, quickest and cheapest ways of getting around Singapore. Buy a card and top it up with your creditcard at any station and you're set to get almost any where on the island - not just down town! An absolute must."
,,MRT @ Singapore,5.0,,MRT is easy and fast mode of travelling within Singapore. Please remember that eating is not allowed in Stations and Trains.
,,"Clean, quick and efficient",5.0,,"Really recommend you get yourselves onto the local trains. When it's hot or you've walked so much your feet are dying, they're brilliant way to get around all the lovely attractions of Singapore.

We used SMRT to get out to Jurong Bird Park, and also Little India etc - had no troubles working it out (we're in our late 50s so not completely senile yet)."
,,"fast, efficient, inexpensive",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is an excellent, effective, and economical way to get around all of Singapore. Stations and subway cars are all clean and brightly lit. The best way to go is with an EZLink card that you may top off when needed - simply swipe when entering and leaving a station."
,,Easy riding,5.0,,With two young children it's always a challenge using public transport especially in a new country but the MRT was easy to navigate and a joy to use
,,Travell Intriguingly,4.0,,"This transporation perhaps not unusual for some travellers outside Asia, yet I bet for Asia tourist this is one of their great experience to travell without traffic holding them back to boredoom. Nevertheless, if you only spend ur time as a passanger and sit still up to your destination then you will find this thing boring.

To make your happiness constantly growing, try hop on to the last and the first platform in a different trip and look outside the window. You might find how cool is the underground railway. Record it and edit it in your preferences, even you will find it a great experience."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,"We where in Singapore for only 4 days, but we used this system every day, and we traveled everywhere. We bought a multi-rider for $20 and it took us from the airport and back again, and all over Singapore, and its so easy to use..........great system."
,,Buy the 48 hour pass,5.0,,"We bought the 48 hour pass and saw more of Singapore from a local perspective. The facilities are clean, signage clear, and staff friendly. Assess to all major tourist attractions available via bus, subway, and train."
,,It is good!,4.0,,"It is connected with most of the places and Malls, which is a good part. You have to walk a lot in the stations. Prices are reasonable and not much crowded except during peak hours."
,,Fabulous,5.0,,"We have just spent 3 days in Singapore and used the MTR to get from the Airport to our Hotel and from then on used it several times every day ... It is spotlessly clean, punctual and efficient and we found it to be an inexpensive way to move around the City ... Highly recommended ..."
,,Working like it should,5.0,,Used a lot during my 2 week stay and no bad experience. On some stations takes a bit time to figure out the correct route/platform
,,Singapore MRT not a bad way to Travel,5.0,,"We travelled twice during our stay here. We didn't bother with the 1 - 3 day passes as we thought they were uneconomical for our stay. When we did use it it was terrifically simple and extremely cheap. Cost is between $1.70 to $2,40 a trip.The stations are well manned, secure and safe. The driver-less trains arrive every 4 mins or so and move swiftly through the vast array of tunnels. There is no graffiti anywhere and the cars are spotlessly clean. The indicator boards are easy to understand and all announcements are in English. Selecting a standard ticket through the GTM was pretty easy and by using the touch screen was simple to use.
There are numerous station interchanges to help make the transition to other lines simple. Best to have a few notes with you even though it takes cards but i was unsure of the minimum value. Worth a go whilst there and to give an indication of the future may be like in my home city of Sydney one day"
,,FAST AND CONVINIENT,5.0,,Very convenient and fast. Most of the attractions are near to metro stations. Very easy to switch stations taking you to different lines through the metro and travelers are very helpful.
,,Thanks for the SMRT,5.0,,"Many people complaining about the problem of SMRT. but I personally besides complaining, I feel appreciated about the SMRT. If not MRT, LRT, many places become far far away for me. Thank you. Keep it up and improve your services."
,,Clean and easy to use,5.0,,This is one of the cleanest public transport facilities I have ever experienced. Very easy to use. The tickets were easy to buy and top up as required. This is the only way I would get around Singapore.
,,Fantastic and Easy to Navigate,5.0,,"The stations are clean, well marked and manageable even for the first time visitor. Fast and convenient. Great system."
,,A short but enjoyable trip,4.0,,Had a chance to use the MRT when we visited Singapore. Even for a first time user it was very convenient and everything is well laid out. We had to change MRT to reach our destination and even with two young kids with us we didn't have any trouble finding the platforms or trains.
,,Best way to travel the city on a budget trip,5.0,,"Be ready to really walk. If you're using the MRT like I did, wear comfortable walking/running shoes because whilst in Singapore on a vacation, you have loads to see and if you go about using the MRT then you're bound to get doubly exhausted!
Having said that, the MRT is an excellent service and once you use it a few times, you will get a hang of the stations, etc. It is so similar to the Dubai Metro, except that this one in underground. Mostly all the sight-seeing destinations of Singapore are covered by the MRT stations, however, there is always a distance to walk to and fro.
I'd used some website to calculate the fares before travelling, but it was extremely inaccurate. Every trip of ours was atleast SGD 1 in reality (online it showed about SGD 0.34 and such for a trip per person). You can either buy the EZlink card (put in some cash on it and swipe away) OR buy a ticket each time (from automated machines). I had read somewhere that there are good tourist offers on the EZlink card so check up on that if you want to. We ended up buying tickets each time because we weren't sure if we'd be using the MRT every day and for all trips as I was 5 months pregnant.
The taxi service is relatively expensive, especially if you are more than 5 people travelling since regular taxis only take up to 4 passengers. 5 people ""bigger"" taxis basically cost more. Taxis get charged toll on certain ""touristy"" zones (ERP), so when we visited Marina Bay Sands or Gardens by the Bay we took the MRT. Big taxis are also difficult to hail so we used UberXL a couple of times and it was relatively cheaper too! Other cab companies like Comfort Cab, etc. are expensive."
,,"Very good, efficient and value for money",4.0,,"Well run, very clean premises, efficient, good value for money and easy/straightforward to use for travel around Singapore."
,,One of the worlds best transport options. Happy Happy.,5.0,,"We've been using the MRT now for some 15 years on and off. With the minor exception of the continuing voice messages about minding the gap and happy happy......it is a pleasure to ride the MRT. Very easy to quickly get a bearing of where, how and when to go to any of the areas in Singapore via the various coloured lines. The carriages are exceptionally clean and it is a joy to not be confronted by marked window, senseless graffiti and litter. No wonder the number of cars on the roads around Singapore seem to be reducing. Tip.......staying for a short time get the tourist pass from any of the station ticket counters. These ticket counters are not at every station but can be found at many of the ""linked"" stations where lines cross."
,,"Convenient, cheap, fast, predictable.",5.0,,"Many locals would complain about the SMRT - about its breakdowns and what not. Honestly, as a Singaporean who have been abroad and seen how bad things can be, we really have nothing much to complain about the SMRT. Hop on and you can probably reach anywhere you want in Singapore!"
,,So frequent and so convenient,5.0,,Great way to get around so maybe getting a hotel near a station is best. Runs all the way til midnight so check for signs that say otherwise. If you miss a train there's no need to worry as the next one will not be far behind (It can take up to 7mins wait for the next one). Certainly the most convenient way to get around!
,,Fantastic transport system,5.0,,"What a great way to travel around Singapore!

There are station's everywhere which are clean, easy to get around and also have lots of shops. You can easily spend a whole day underground in the shops!

A tourist pass works out at 20$ for 3 day's which is great value."
,,Doesn't service the new cruise ship terminal that well,4.0,,"I have always really liked the SMRT but this time the cruise ship I was on docked at the new cruise ship terminal in Marina Bay. The SMRT station is a bit of a hike from the cruise ship terminal and is all outside over basically waste land. The service to the station closet to the cruise ship terminal isn't that good either, basically one train in two to Marina Bay goes to the stop closest to the cruise ship terminal. Other than not handling the new cruise ship terminal that well, the SMRT continues to be a world class transit system."
,,"Accessible, Convenient, fast",5.0,,We used to experience communiting with locals and SMRT is the best transportation in getting around in Singapore. My family prefer SMRT for travelling anywhere within Singapore.
,,Great,5.0,,Very interesting form of travel. Only in Singapore!!!!! Anyone travelling to Singapore from Australia should take the time to have a look at this underground rail system.
,,Singapore 5 Day Visit,5.0,,"A really extensive network similar to London, but newer cleaner and SO MUCH CHEAPER, Airport to City Hall Mid town was S$2,40 yes, about UK£1.40. buy your ticket at machines but they will not take notes above S$5 or plastic cards. Interchange is easy, all signs in English"
,,Have your change ready,4.0,,"Deposit is no longer 1SGD but 0.1 SGD. Ticket can be uploaded with money and reused up to six times. 3rd ride gives back the deposit. There is some small discount on next rides. Ticket machines accept just 1,2 and 5 SGD notes for default tourist ticket."
,,Efficient and clean,5.0,,"Singapore MRT system is very efficient, easy to use and new lines were added recently. Travelling on the MRT is reallly a pleasure....it has none of the pushing and shoving that goes on in London tube. Recommended to take out EZcard for easy travel on the MRT."
,,Cheap way to get around,5.0,,"The SMRT is a cheap and easy way to get around Singapore. You can buy a 1/2/3 day tourist pass. We bought a 3 day pass for SGD$30, you get unlimited bus/train/tram and you get SGD$10 refunded when you return the plastic pass card."
,,Excellent transport system,5.0,,"This is one of the worlds best transport systems. Trains are on time, well managed for safety and crowd control. Very clean and safe to use at anytime of day or night. Can travel almost anywhere on it"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Love Singapore's MRT - so easy to get around, value for money and never a long wait. It does get busy in peak-hour times, so take this into account. The tap on card used to gain entry to the platforms can now be used for the buses too. Just double check you get the right platform, as some of the station have more than one train line running through them!...and alway note what the name of the terminating station is, that will let you know which direction (and platform) that specific train is for."
,,clean and efficient,5.0,,"Traffic in Singapore is a nightmare, so if you need to get around this wonderful City State, especially from the airport, use the SMRT. The major tourist sites, (eg Raffles Hotel, Orchard Rd, Newton Circus the harbor area, and Sentosa island) can be accessed, or approached, by the SMRT. Easy to use and cheap, this mode of transport offers a below and above ground way of accessing the shopping areas as well as the suburbs. Highly recommended."
,,The only way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT, in my opinion, is the best of getting around the city and to travel to and from Changi, the airport of Singapore. It is inexpensive, convenient and easily accessible. Currently, if you flight comes in before early enough your trip into the city is free, using a touch in and touch out card."
,,"Clean, convenient, cheap - but don't drink water",4.0,,"The SMRT is an extremely cheap and convenient way of traversing Singapore for individual travelers. However, Uber is also an extremely cheap method of getting around the country and if you are traveling as a couple or in larger groups, I'd recommend just getting a direct Uber to the destination as it will work out to a similar price point.

The SMRT gets extremely busy during peak hours and on Saturdays and there is usually limited seating."
,,Underground travel,4.0,,"Metro was easy to use, clean and cheap (We went one stop past our return destination and it cost 20 cents (about 11p)!"
,,SMRT -- efficient transportation,4.0,,"It is reasonable easy to travel around Singapore by MRT, sometimes are crowded but convenient to everywhere."
,,Best way to get around Singapore. Highly recommended.,5.0,,We arrived at Changi airport bought our transport passes there and used them to travel into the city by train just one train change very easy on the same platform. We traveled all over Singapore on the MRT clean air-conditioned fast modern stations and some have excellent facilities shops food great staff. An easy to follow layout means you can pick a destination and arrive from the underground relaxed and fresh do some sightseeing then travel to your next destination. An excellent and very inexpensive way to see the sights in a few days. Returning by train to the airport we redeemed our card deposit and gave back the card.
,,commute in new city,5.0,,"Clean, Cool, and on-time! Routes via trains are clearly marked at each MRT station. Easy access and staff at information booths are very helpful"
,,We haven't used it often as it isn't very handy to our son's house but when we did it was fantastic.,5.0,,"Clean, plenty of trains to take you anywhere but mostly, we used Uber. And they have some very good deals at times if you are a customer, like paying $3/4 for a 15/20 minute ride. However, the MRT for tourists would be a cheaper way to travel around and we have the equivalent of the Oyster card which we can charge when needed."

Purchase an Ezylink ticket from either ticket office in station or from machines in station - top up as needed - initial cost of $20, including the original card was enough to go all over the island for several days - also used the card on buses. Commuters were always orderly and polite - a great transport system"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Similar to Taiwan. Its clean, quick, and comfortable. Make sure to get an EZ Card so you can save money if youre taking multiple trips."

We used the MRT a lot and found it so cheap and better to buy your tickets as you need them rather than a 3 day pass."

,,Best way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT offers excellent train and bus services. Be sure to take a MRT map from any station or your hotel reception. Its a very convenient and cheap mode of option even if you are alone or with family. I had read reviews where people said if you are a family of 4 then probably a CAB would cost you similar or a little more, but I disagree to it. CAB is way expensive compared to MRT. CAB may also have hidden charges lit phone booking, night charges after 6 PM, etc. At the passenger service desk you get a EZ link card for which MRT charges SGD $5 which is not refundable. However you can keep topping up this card as and when needed. The connectivity and the frequency is just wonderful and it can take you to all the attractions in SGP. Best part is MRT refunds you the money which is unused on your EZLink card whenever you approach the counter. Kids 6 and under travel free. You will surely save a lot of money by using MRT for your local travel. To and fro from your hotel to Changi airport is also available but I took a CAB as I had a lot of luggage.
There are fines for eating and drinking on the train so make sure you follow the rules. The MRT service is excellent and trains are very clean. Don't miss it."

,,THE best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"I can't speak highly enough about this method of transportation, safe, super clean, cheap and so easy to understand and operate the straight forward ticket machines - unlike the London Underground which confuses me completely.

We didn't purchase a tourist pass as we like to walk a fair amount as you stumble across interesting sites that you might miss. However when the feet tired - it was a godsend to jump on the MRT.

Fabulous!"
,,Good,4.0,,"Good, clean, efficient and quiet. Could be improved if travel was based on a time basis (I.e., each trip is valid for 1hr so that you can travel as much as you wanted in 1hr and this would be considered as one trip) rather than distance and peak or low time basis."

,,5 Star Public Transport,5.0,,"We spent a week in Singapore and used the trains several times. I was amazed at how clean these trains are - not as much as a scuff mark on the floor.

,,Convinient Way to Travel,4.0,,"SMRT is one of the fastest public transport to get to places around Singapore, bus lag slightly behind due to traffic lights however buses do go to slightly less accessible places where trains do not.

Either purchase a pre-loaded SMRT card or have the train concession (or concession for both train and bus), then head through the gantry to the platform.

I do recommend traveling during off-peak hours as the crowd does increase substantially, but it is a daily sight for the locals which you might want to try."

,,A role model for the rest of the world,5.0,,"This was our second visit to Singapore and we used the MRT several times a day. We came from Malaysia via Tuas 2nd bridge and started out experience at Jurong East. Even though we were tourists, we had some items to buy, so shopping was also on the agenda. We did not buy the $10 a day tourist card, as there was no way you could use $10 on the MRT and bus in a day (unless there is some other benefit?). The Ezycard is purchased for $12, with $5 non-refundable. Our first time in Singapore we had 4 days, when we used $12 each, and our 2nd trip 4 months later (we kept the cards) of 3 days used $8 each. We would have been on about 6 trips of various lengths per day. Very good interconnecting walkways to shopping centres and roads, and excellent signage, hard to go wrong."

,,"Clean, Comfortable and very Efficient",5.0,,"Myself and my wife have been using the Singapore MRT system for three days now, and are both quite enamoured by it because the stations and trains are clean and bright, and every time we've travelled on it, we've not had to wait more than 3 minutes for a train.

We bought 3 day tourist cards, which initially cost S$30, though on completion of the 3 days, you hand the card back in and collect a S$10 refund, so in reality they only cost S$20 for the 3 days.

We've travelled all across the system during our stay, so feel we've really got our money's worth out of the cards, and as such, I'm happy to recommend to everyone.

FYI: In addition to our 3 day passes, we've also travelled on single tickets, and they are charged depending on the length of journey. Changi Airport to Novena cost S$2.50 each (Approx 30 mins journey time), and Novena to Orchard (2 stops, taking about 5 mins) cost S$1.40, so that gives you an idea of what it costs on a per journey basis.

One last thing, and it's not really a positive for the MRT System but for its passengers, a number of passengers stood up and offered their seat to my wife, who's no longer a spring chicken, so well done and thanks very much to them."

This is a good subway system! The cars were clean and modern. The stations were packed with maps and directions. The fare card system worked well.

The best fact is that the subway is cheap!!!"
,,Incomparable,5.0,,"Omg, best train system I have ever experienced.
On time all the time. Nice & clean, no graffiti to be seen. So easy to use, colour coded system works a treat. Feel like there were stations to all the main attractions. Safe to travel at any time. Never experienced overcrowding. Reasonable cheap, can purchase individual trips at a time."
,,nice transport,5.0,,"easy to use, nice public transportation, clean and faster than other public transportation. Not expensive. Recommend for people come to sing use it."
,,efficient and united feel,5.0,,"what impress me the most is the announcement being made by SMRT in all ethnic language i.e. English, Bahasa Melayu, Mandarin and even Tamil, it gives me an impression that Singapore really respects its multi-races citizen.

If you really want me to suggest an improvement for SMRT, I would rather wish the escalator's speed can be slightly slower as it seems a bit challenging for me as pregnant woman to catch the steps before it misses but I also understand that Singapore is a country that emphasizes on efficiency that's why you require a speedy escalator to transport people."
,,Easiest mode of transport in Singapore,5.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore, get yourself a SMRT pass, and travel by MRT (Train) and bus around Singapore easily and cheaply.
Trains are clean, safe, and cheap to travel to most places tourists need to get to... If you're adventurous, you can even step off at some of the less ""Tourisy"" spots and have an explore..."
,,"Fast, cheap way around Singapore",4.0,,"No matter how long your visit, it is worth getting to know how to use the system as it makes your journey times much more predictable as you avoid traffic. If you plan to travel after 11pm, be sure to check the last mrt."
,,Very efficient and modern mass transport,5.0,,"I hope we have the same level of efficiency and modern transport back home. Stations are clean, modern and organized even there are lot of commuters."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"No words can describe how clean, efficient and easy to get around this MTR is (but then I'm really only comparing it to the London Tube) If your a tourist get a pass for how ever many days you intend to stay from the ticket booth."
,,Excellent transport,5.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore, clean,safe and on time and frequent. Buy a tourist ticket it safes all the trouble of queuing at each station."
,,To infinite and (almost) beyond,4.0,,"Let be honest, there s not much to say abt singapore mrt because it s simply good and relatively efficient ( sorry but nothing equal tokyo one if we compare lines age, reliability, service and crowd fun diversity)
So to the point ,
Like:
Top clean
All got restrooms (good to know sometimes)
Most got atm
Easy to get and top up ezlink card (then u go trouble free for ur trip and u can use it for other small purchases. Bit like hk octopuss card or tokyo pass)
Platform staff usually helpfull (not the cisco people )

Like less:
Not so extended network in some directions ( in 15 years will be better)
So can be ridiculously crowded
Reliability arguable for a city like singapore
(Regular minor breakdowns or pauses en route, occasional big ones)
Platform staff with invisible power when minor disturbance happens ( but usually here during big ones)

Need to stay near a station to make life easier."
,,Easiest one of the best,5.0,,"For a public train system it is fantastic, always on time and on board announcements to your coming station. Easily as good if not better than Hong Kong.... Simple way to travel around Singapore."
,,Lifelines of Singapore,5.0,,"Most locals use bus or metro. Get a travel pass and get your travel woes sorted, as this allows unlimited access to both"
,,excellent infra,4.0,,"Excellent, convenient and best priced way to go around the city. The service is top class as expected from a top place like Singapore."
,,Best system on Earth,5.0,,The MRT system covers much of Singapore now. It is automatic and ccreaingly clean and efficient. It is cheap and a perfect way to explore.
,,SMRT great public transport service around Singapore,5.0,,"What a great public network system which will have 360km of railway around the island, clean, fast and efficient. A well thought out network."
,,IMPRESSIVE,5.0,,"Their stations are really clean and organized. Signs are everywhere to make it easy for people to navigate and know where they are. Love how there are signs of the ETA of the train and ETA to the station you're going to. Unlike here in Manila, people actually give way to the ones leaving the train and there were really no one pushing you. Plus the fact that despite the load of the train, it's still cold inside!"
,,Great way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"Its one of the best subways in the world. Taking the MRT is the easiest and fastest way to see singapore. Its clean , convenient and the fare is very reasonable."
,,Works well,5.0,,"Great, safe way to travel. Buy 3 day tourist ticket for Sing Dollar 30 and get 10 back when you return the ticket.Well sign posted. Only a couple of minutes wait between trains. Average taxi/uber trip is about 10 dollar, so well worth it"
,,Speak and clean,5.0,,Easy to use and very cheap. This is how a metro should look and run. One way will cost S$1.5 and so if you want to hop on and off get a day ticket.
,,Best way to get around central Singapore,5.0,,"If arriving by air, grab a Nets card outside arrival hall (Changi Recommends). Top it up at any MRT station."

Easy transfer from airport and to surrounding suburbs which locals and tourists use on a daily basis.
Easy purchase of tickets in Singapore dollars allows one to top up with ease.
Train travels till midnight daily.
Strictly no eating, smoking are enforced whilst traveling with a hefty fine.
Announcements for suspicious persons are to be reported immediately.
Easy train route maps displayed in train and announced at every stop.
Cheaper form of travel by locals and tourists.
Stops are on famous shopping street of Orchard road and close to many other hotels .
See when booking a hotel see which station is closest for easy transport."
,,Singapore Tourist Pass : Value for money,5.0,,"Perfect for 3D2N getaway in SG. It boards us across SG for unlimited travel experience. Very good connectivity, especially for tourist who board the wrong train, can easily switch train by getting across the platform. Whatsapp application is used to make report, which is easy for users.
Upon returning the Tourist Pass, SGD10 is refunded.
Thank you SMRT for the unlimited travel experience!"
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,This system of transport is easy for anyone to get in Singapore where-ever you want. With the special app you can plan ahead and reach every point of interest in this bustling city
,,"Just 3 words - Punctual, Clean and Reliable",5.0,,"Personally, I've used many MRT/Metros apart from SG, but Singapore MRT is just clean, punctual and heavily reliable.

Having been using since 1.5 years all modes of transport here - bus, taxi, MRT, etc, MRT wins hands down when it comes to reaching destination on time. If it takes 30mins to reach a destination using MRT, it does take almost same time everyday irrespective of peak/off peak hrs, making it hugely reliable way to plan everyday trips. During peak hrs the frequency is increased further making the availability even higher."
,,Cheap and efficient public transport.,5.0,,The SMRT in Singapore provides a cheap mode of transport to anywhere in Singapore and the stations are very clean. I recommend that you do not go during peak hours as it would be very crowded. The trains also take a short time to arrive so you won't need to wait that long.
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,Singapore MRT is so nicely planned that it literally covers the entire Singapore. You can commute anywhere using the simple MRT map.
,,Quiet and Efficient,5.0,,My hotel was located over the Espanade station so I took the MRT all over town. The system has a similar design to those in Hong Kong so it was easy to get around. Love the convenience and the air conditioning when it was either very hot or very rainy outside.
,,Amazing Experience,5.0,,$20 tourist pass is fabulous. Loved the service. Direction is so easy to understand. Crystal clear instructions on every platform. Highlight of the tour.
,,could definitely be better,3.0,,"the signages are not adequate enough, and if you are someone who is not familiar with subways and MRTs as ell as line changing, this can be quite a harrowing experience specially if you are with family. This is one are where I feel the government can do more and make it tourist friendly....or maytbe on 2nd thoughts...that's the whole idea. tourists should use taxis that further spur economic growth"
,,Just convenient!,4.0,,"Singapore's infrastructure is one of the best in Asia! The Singapore MRT has a very good coverage spreading across the whole country. You can get to almost all places of interest, shopping districts, housing estates just by taking the MRT. The train also takes you to and from Changi Airport. With the system map, signage and friendly ambassadors, one can never get lost to where he/she wants to go. Some of the stations are linked underground so you can actually walk from one station to another without getting sweaty (under the hot sun) or getting wet (if it rains). The stations and walkway are fully air-conditioned, convenient and affordable. For the benefits of those who doesn't know Singapore well, here are some suggestions: 1) To parks and places of interest: Harbour Front station (Sentosa), Joo Koon station (Singapore Discovery Centre), Singapore Botanic Gardens, Chinese Garden, Raffles Place or Clarke Quay station (Singapore River), Bayfront station (Marina Bay Sands), Gardens by the Bay, Kraji station (Singapore Turf Club)... 2) To shopping: City Hall, Dhoby Ghaut, Somerset, Orchard, Harbour Front, Bugis... There are just too many to name here!"
,,cost effective and a great experience,5.0,,"the MRT is always on time, its a cost effective way of getting your way round the city - the MRT will get you to anywhere you need to be, all the major tourist cites are available via the MRT. The MRT is very safe and the locals are always willing to help a stranger find their way"
,,"Clean, cheap and courteous",5.0,,"If only the London tube were as nice an experience! Spotless stations, good signage and courteous passenger."
,,Dont go in Peak Hours,5.0,,"Dont use MRT in Peak Hours, too crowded. Using MRT is useful for going to Airport, because its cheap."
,,MRT will not drain your pocket,5.0,,"If you are in Singapore, always travel by MRT coz it's the most connected, easy and economical way to commute. Loved it.."
,,Easy and efficient,5.0,,"Clean and super efficient, as a visitor you can get a pass to cover travel and that saves a lot of bother. Buy at the airport if you are staying in CBD or near an MRT stop. Rather a lot of telling you what to do, but a small price for the convenience and great service."
,,The easiest way to get around,5.0,,"In a city where Taxis are cheap and traffic is free-flowing compared to Bangkok, you might wonder why you'd bother with the MRT? Well because it is a complete bargain, frequent and just a thoroughly great way to get around the city!"
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We always try to use the public transport system in any city we visit. This is one of the best systems, if not the best, we have ever travelled on. It is fast, clean, safe, efficient and not expensive. People in Singapore are very polite and I was always offered a seat which, of course, it was polite to accept. Singapore obviously cares about its citizens and visitors by providing such excellent transportation"
,,Brilliant!,5.0,,Singapore's MRT is the best transport system I have experienced so far. We purchased a $12 card when we arrived and it last for the full 8 days we were in Singapore. The value is excellent!
,,Never seen a bus tour in SG.,5.0,,I have never seen a bus tour in SG. Not even one full of Chinese tourists. We can thank the SMRT for this. Affordable and superlative.
,,Very Efficient,5.0,,"Always use this mode of transportation unless press for time or am not near a station. Safe, clean and reliable."
,,"Clean, Safe and Efficient",5.0,,"Singapore transport systems may not be the 'World Best' but as compared to countries that I've the privilage to visit, there is definietly no doubt about the efficiency (all trains, cars etc do break down over time), cleanliness and best of all SAFE!!"
,,Efficient and Structured,5.0,,"The SMRT is really well structured and, in my opinion, a very efficient an easy way to get around in Singapore"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"I was staying for a week, so brought an ez link card plus $12 ($20 all up) and have been set for travel. The MRT is clean, trains frequent and have the progress of the train shown above he train entrance / exit doors."
,,Love the Train !,5.0,,This was my fifth trip to Singapore and am now a regular on the MRT. Cost is little for transport anywhere you want to go. All air conditioned and stations are clean with easy access. MRT card is good for five years. More lines being added al the time.
,,Very clean and on time,5.0,,Singapore MRT is an excellent choice for getting around in the city. The train system is extremely clean and reliable. The routes are very well marked and the stations have clear signage. There is a discounted 3 day ticket available for tourists to use for 30$- a very good price. You can also get 10$ back if you return the card when you're finished using it.
,,"Quick , clean and easy to use",5.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore, get a day or longer card which can be topped up. Fifteen dollars lasted six days for me"
,,Singapore,2.0,,"Trains were clean To many public announcements becomes very irritating Overmanpowered, many were not needed in directing flow of traffic as there weren't any crowd East west line is the line to avoid Severe overcrowding occurs at all times of day And breakdown were frequent"
,,Great system,5.0,,"Everything about this train system was great. It was easy to navigate, the stations were announced at every stop, the trains were clean and cool and the fares were cheap! It was simple to work out where to go, where to change for another line and the signs indicating where an MRT station was located were plentiful. They even have signs indicating where to get a bus from if any of the lines/stop happen to be out of service.

I would recommend using the ez link card as for most of the journeys I took, it was less than 1 dollar!"
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"This transport system blow me away! The price was good and easy to use. The trains were very clean and well looked after. Buying tickets was easy and we just used the paper tickets which could be reused/topped up at the ticket machines.
The trains are all colour coded and trains were always available. We never had to wait any longer than 5 minutes for a train."
,,asian trip,5.0,,"We travelled this with our local tour guide. Very clean,efficient & very affordable . A great way to get around the city. They have one train dedicated just for Disney"
,,Only way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"As a family of 4 we found the best way to travel was on the mrt. Cheap, longest you waited for a train was 3 minutes. Even the bus we only waited a short time."
,,Inexpensive Clean and Efficient,5.0,,That about sums the review of the metro system in 4 words. If only all public transport systems were like this. My only niggle is that if you are buying one off tickets you need a steady supply of 2$ notes and coins because the automated machines don't accept higher denominations.
,,Outstanding easy clean and cool,5.0,,This is the way to travel around Singapore! We bought a 3 day travelers pass after doing 2 days on the hop on hop off bus... this was way better for us.
,,Great,5.0,,"One thing i have to complain was, the MRT a bit confusing. Sometimes to change the line you have to go upstairs, then go downstairs again."
,,"simple, useful, comfy",5.0,,"when you travel to Singapore, i recommend you to use this SMRT, why? coz its simple, cheaper, easy to use , the map easy to understand, clean, and connected to all mall and building across the Singapore area, forget other transportation, and use SMRT"
,,Spotlessly Clean,4.0,,Excellent service. The only reason I did not give it 5 star rating was because of the constant pushing 'in front' from the masses. Singapore doesn't do 'queuing' but they are trying.
,,See Singapore on your own,5.0,,Forget the hop on hop off bus. You can do this on your own with just a map. We got off the QE and did the town with the MRT and a few taxis for 1/4 the price of the hop on hop off bus which by the way had bad reviews. A/C was great and the beat metro that I have ever taken
,,fast and reliable transportation,5.0,,"my apartment in singapore was well off the city centre where we have our activities, whenever i ride a cab or an online cab it would cost me 5x the amount i paid to ride an mrt. its not as fast as a car but it gets you to your destination."
,,Essential for my trip!,5.0,,I like Singapore for smooth transportation system which includes (SMRT). You just need to buy the ezlink card and avoid traffic and rock ya!
,,"Excellent, a credit to its staff.",5.0,,"As others say get a tourist pass as soon as you arrive. You can use it from the airport and to every attraction on the island.
It's air conditioned too, so a welcome break! On the light rail and buses people started random conversations..... They were so friendly and not at all weird perhaps we were good English practice!"
,,Amazing!,5.0,,"Goodness me - this could teach the underground system in London a few things! Rapid, reliable & incredible clean - from the trains to the stations. An absolute pleasure to use."
,,Best in the world,5.0,,5 days of travelling and not 1 glitch Didn't wait longer than 5 minutes for any train. Got around heaps with our $20 each on transit cards
,,It's Fabulous,5.0,,"It's clean, fast, regular service serving many parts of the City. Interchanges are easy and there is abundant signage. Well done Singapore the MRT is the benchmark for other countries to emulate."
,,A great place to visit,5.0,,SMRT is a money saviour for the people who are traveling to a different part of the city. The train connects you to different Singapore tourist spots. You can even travel to shopping malls or tourist spots as per your convenience.
,,Easy,5.0,,"Quick, clean, easy and not expensive! A really good way to travel around Singapore! The trains are frequent with both visual and vocal announcements on where you are and where the train is going. SIMPLES!"
,,Hands Down the Best Mode of Transport,5.0,,"We rarely use public transport but have to say that the SMRT was brilliant and the Tourist Pass was the best purchase we made during our week long visit to Singapore.
It only took a few rides on the trains and the buses for us to work out exactly how, where, what and why. A brilliant system that can practically get you to any destination within Singapore. The trains are so clean you could eat if the floor, ha!!! And they run on time, to the millisecond!!
We travelled all across the country on the trains.
On departure from Changi Airport, we returned our cards and were given SGD$10 on the spot. You do pay an initial $10 deposit per pass.
Highly, highly recommended for all."
,,Easy to get around in air conditioned comfort,5.0,,"As a tourist you can get a one, two or three day pass. These are well worth it, and can be purchased at all stations. There is a S$10 deposit on the pass card which can only be redeemed at three stations (Chinatown, Bugis and Airport) though, so you may need to take this into account. The trains are air conditioned, which provides some relief from the heat and humidity, and we found that they weren't that crowded during the day."
,,public transport as it should be,5.0,,"Quick, clean, efficient, runs every 2 - 5 minutes, all lines interconnect and cheap. Just dont forget, no food or drink on the stations or in the trains, very expencive if you do."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"All cities should have a system like Singapore's. it is clean, safe and very easy to navigate. I didn't have to wait long for any of my connections."
,,Wonderful Public Transport System,5.0,,Very convenient and economical one must buy singapore tourist pasd valid gur 3 days you can have n number of rides in bus and metro. The passenger service staff is too cooperative guided and polite and a best experience
,,Simple efficiency,5.0,,Excellent! Clean efficient and VERY cheap. It takes a little time to orientate yourself using the map but the ticket machines are good and they are extending the system with more stations. Never saw one piece of litter or dirt. Very well organised.
,,Lifeline of Singapura,5.0,,When in Singapore you cannot travel without embarking on the MRT..buy an EZY link card and get a tourist map and you are good to go.
,,Easy to use & economical,5.0,,"Unsurprisingly this is a clean, well run service. The lines run on different levels which sometimes confused us but both staff and other passengers were helpful."
,,The best,5.0,,Dont waste your money on taxis. Get yourself a ezy link card and use the very convenient and very easy to navigate MRT.
,,Fast,5.0,,"Once you work it out its a piece of pie. Cheap,fast and very clean. Go into the station then find a map. Buy ticket from machine (very easy)....just follow instructions on screen."
,,The cleanest most efficient way to get about,5.0,,"If you've been to London on the tube forget it. This is the cleanest, cheapest and most efficient underground rail service I've ever been on. So easy to navigate and you feel totally safe even as a woman alone."
,,Singapore MRT system - fast and cheap way of travelling around Singapore,4.0,,The MRT system is really very good - incredibly efficient with trains commencing from about 5:30am and with a very wide network it is an ideal way of getting around Singapore. The train frequency is great with another train coming along within minutes at peak times. The only downside is that the service stops about midnight - we got stranded at 12:15am once two stops short of our destination and had to get a taxi to complete the journey.
,,Your Singapore card - tourist pass information for travellers,3.0,,"I am reviewing this offer with mixed feelings.
Firstly, because the idea of unlimited rides while you're on vacation sounds lovely. But they way it is organized makes me think that Singapore doesn't like their tourists at all.
1. The 3 day pass is not a 3 day pass at all. The card is valid on the day of purchase, so forget about planning ahead and buying your card for the next day.
2. It is sold in a limited number of SMRT stations, so if you are not staying in a walking distance to one of those stations, you need to buy a single MRT ticket anyway in order to get to the sell points.
3. Some of those selling points open after 12 PM and close around 5-7 PM, unlike EZLink Service Points for locals, which are open most of the time.
4. Getting a 10 SGD deposit back is really hard. I think that actually the service strategy was aimed for tourists to lose the deposit. Yet again the selling points service hours. Note there is one at Changhi airport but a) opens too late, b) it's located at terminal 2 and the train from the city will drop you at terminal 3. I bet you'll be in a hurry to check in and you won't wander around terminals looking for the Singapore Pass office to get your 10 bucks back, will you? Cannot such a modern city place a machine at MRT station where you could return your card? Oh, and the deposit is only returned within 5 days of purchase, so forget about getting it back on your next trip to Singapore.
5. Along with the card, you will get a booklet with discounts for tourists. I tried to use some of them and I was refused every time (orchid garden discount, souvenir pack at Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Sling at Boat Quay, etc). I travel a lot and I don't like being taken advantage of, just because I am only passing by and I won't complain. Hence I emailed the Tourist Pass customer service to let them know their partners are not providing was was promised. Needless to say, my email was ignored. All in all, buying the Tourist Pass may be a good option if you are planning to use public transport more than 5 times a day. And in best case scenario, if you organize very well, the 3 day pass will be valid 61 hours, not 72."
,,Fast and practice,4.0,,"This metro is far the best I've ever used. But Singapore is extremely hot and the air conditioner in the stations and in the trains are really cold what can makes you get a cold, like I did."
,,The best way for inexpensive travel,5.0,,"We were fortunate to be in Singapore when the Rugby 7's were being contested.
The MRT station was a 5 minute walk from our hotel via the underground shopping centre adjacent to our hotel and a 10 min ride to the Stadium, all at a cost of S$5.90 return for two people."
,,great way to travel,5.0,,"Get a tourist pass for 3 days. Then you don't have to line up for tickets. Just be aware that its three actual days not 36 hours so if you purchase in the afternoon, you might loose some value.

If you miss the train, don't panic, only wait 5 minutes for next.

The trains and stations are very clean."
,,So convenient,5.0,,"Bought a three day tourist pass at the airport and went everywhere on mrt.

The only tip is the tourist passes are not 3 x 24 hrs, they are 3 calendar days. So in hindsight I wasted a day catching the train to hotel first night. Should have bought a ticket and activated my tourist card the next morning.

Reminds me of the convenience of NYC but impeccably clean and orderly."
,,"Fantastic, Clean System",5.0,,"Singapore's MRT system covers the island with clean, reliable, safe transportation. There are stops at Orchard Road, Chinatown, the Quays, Little India, Harbourfront, Marina Bay and the airport. This covers many of the tourist hot spots. There are no trash bins within in the stations, so be sure to use a trash bin before you enter, lest you carry it with you on your excursion."
,,"Clean, fast and efficient",5.0,,"One of the best public transportation system I've seen in more than 50 countries I have visited. Efficient, punctual and with a helpful and polite staff."
,,Easy way to get around,5.0,,"$10 for 1 day $16 for two or $20 for 3... $10 extra for the card which is refundable.... pretty easy to use and get around ... only annoyance is you have to buy a travel card and they are only from a few places I.e. City Hall.

Worth using though."
,,The only way to get around.,5.0,,"I am a regular business traveller to Singapore (maybe 20 visits over the last 5 years) and would recommend the MRT as the only way to get around Singapore day and night. It's clean, safe, frequent and cheap. Taxis are cheap in Singapore but can be hard to get when it rains and in the middle of the day. I recommend you get a SMRT card at the beginning of your trip and remember to return it to get the remainder of your money back and your card deposit. Also pick up one of the useful little pocket maps from the station attendants and start travelling!"
,,Best public transport in the world,5.0,,"Fast, clean, efficient and so CHEAP!! No other way to get around the city. It cost us 16c to travel from Jurong East to Clarke Quay, WIN."
,,"easy, efficient, clean. the way all metros should be.",5.0,,"We rode the metro 4 or five times and were impressed by their frequency, cleanliness and price. If all metros around the world were like this. The only downside is that not all of singapore is accessible (or it is but involves lots of walking). Very cheap but if three or more peope -perhaps better to take a taxi."
,,Fantastic way to get around,5.0,,"Bought a transit card at the airport when we arrived and used it throughout our stay on the MRT. We rode the MRT from the airport to our hotel and to get around Singapore. The system is excellent. It is fast, efficient, very cheap and it is very easy to use the system with color coded maps located at all stations and in carriages. The trains are extremely clean and wait times between trains, in our experience, was less than five minutes."
,,Great subway,5.0,,Clean and efficient. Love taking the subway in Singapore. Be sure to get the tourist pass which covers buses and trains at a good price. Can be very crowded at rush hours but no where as crowded as Japan or Korea
,,Fast clean quiet travel,5.0,,We bought the two day tourist pass costing $26 each with a $10 refund. We used the train from Changi Airport and also the No 2 bus. Not many seats on the train but everyone is quiet with no loud conversations. A joy to use. Easy to find one's way around too.
,,One Ride is must,5.0,,"You will really enjoy the smooth ride. Moreover than the ride you need to see the system and cleanliness and ticketing system they have. Traveling is cheap, fast and great"
,,Very good service,4.0,,"Very good network to visit in the city. On time service & clean seats. However, not good solution for tourists with short duration to touch many spots. Need to walk much to move around."
,,S stands for smooth MRT,5.0,,Modern cities need really effective public transport systems and Singapore's is brilliant. Every established city around the world could really learn from the layout of this system. Most cities have the hub and spoke style design which centralises the lines to one or two mega stations. To go across town you have to go all the way in and out. Very inefficient. The planning and growth of MRT lines has created loops so each line has numerous crossovers with other lines so to get across town is easy. Well done Singapore
,,Very easy to use,5.0,,MTR is very easy to use to get around Singapore. Recommend to use it. Air conditioned and very clean.
,,Efficient and convenient,5.0,,"Visitors should use the MRT, it's both easy to use and close to most tourist locations, staff was most helpful when asking for directions."
,,Cleanest most efficient tube on the planet,5.0,,"Easy, cheap and seemingly locked to schedule on he planet. Taxis are cheap but this is a great system"
,,Mrt,5.0,,"All of the Subway train / MRT are aircon.
There are many line to different part of Singapore.
There are many interchange in the station where u can get from one end to another without coming out the station.
Also there are shop and food area after checking out the station.
Bathroom are also location at most of the stop.
We take the train by an eazi link card. It will made it easy and faster to get in and out of station.
The eazi link card need to reload / top up with money. And the fair of the ride will be deduced from inside.
The card is link with the bus transport too.
U can download an app called SG MRT. Where it will have u to plan ur route , timing of the train, and show u the station name in chinese and English."
,,Great MRT but...,5.0,,"One of the best Metro in the world. Clean fast. Liability of train timing is almost 100%.
It is also the safest one in the world.
I lost my walllet once and somebody get out of the train to give it back to me on the platform.

My only concern : people don't let people get in and you can miss train when you could have entered the train if people have let you in.
People move towards the exit and block doors to be at the first raw to exit the following stop.

So that should be improved and the mrt company is doing their best to educate people.

It will be a shame if the mrt company have to invest new trains - and make price of fare higher."
,,Best way to travel.,4.0,,Very user friendly going to the city from airport n back....Budget friendly n a very good network coverage...All attractions in Singapore can be accessed by the MRT if u use their guide map n assistance from MRT Staff.. Precision train timings.
,,"Nice, Clean, and On Time. Full at Peak Hours",5.0,,I have visited Singapore 7 times. Six of them are travelling inside Singapore by using MRT (and lots of walking of course). The stations and the trains are nice and clean. The fares are cheaper if you use card than if you buy standard tickets (ST) for one-time travel. The price of the card for adult was 12SGD (contains 7SGD).
,,Easiest mrt systems,5.0,,"We can download their app at google play.
In their app, we can input our starting and end destination and the app will provide the routes you can take to reach the destination. So easy to use
The mrt station and the car itself is very clean with details exit signages so we can know which exit to each places."
,,SMRT is the smart way to go,5.0,,"Public transportation around Singapore was very easy, affordable and frequent. I could turn up at a train stop and would never wait more than a few minutes to get a train. There were lines going all over Singapore."
,,Convenient Plus,5.0,,"The SMRT works to schedule with trains arriving every couple of minutes. Stations are conveniently placed close to all major tourist destinations. You can spend all day travelling around with your SMRT card, which is easy to load for minimal expenditure/cost. Fantastic service, the only way to travel around Singapore."
,,Easy Peasy,4.0,,"Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit is actually the most convenient and simple method to travel around the small city. It brings travelers and Singaporean around to the location where we want to go. Most of the station in the city area (Raffles Place, City Hall, Orchard, Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut) allows passenger to alight right in heart of the indoor area. However a tip would be that the train will be pack during peak hours that starts from 8am to 9.30am and 5pm to 7pm as this is the timing where passenger takes the train to work and home. Travelers with big luggage may have an issue of getting on board during those timing."
,,Brilliantly efficient,5.0,,What a stress-free experience. Never wait more than five minutes no matter where you want to go. Hop on and off and a great way to explore Singapore as the locals do.
,,Best experience using mass transport,5.0,,"The signs are clear, no trashbin because you cant litter there or there will be a massive amount of fines, always ontime (as far as i've experienced), and the card system is very responsive"
,,Guide for tourists,5.0,,"Just a quick review. It's cheap, easy and very organised. Great signage. We used it everyday on our holiday to Singapore. Air con was very appreciated. Malls and shops attached to some cbd mrt stations."
,,crowded,3.0,,"the mrt is always crowded and it it tight inside , but its fast and i can reach on time, it bring me to places that i can be there"
,,Clean and assessible.,5.0,,"Just check the maps for exits since you might leave from the wrong part of the station. If you leave out the wrong exit, you might end up walking more than you need to above ground in the heat"
,,So easy to use.,5.0,,"We used the metro so cheap and spotlessly clean. China town station is fabulous, with loads of shops and restaurants."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,Just get a map and an Opal card and its easy. Off you go and you can just about reach anywhere on the Island.
,,Best way to see Singapore,5.0,,"We got a visitor pass for $26 for two days each. We travelled all day for the two days and saw a lot of Singapore by SMRT, bus and LRT. Fantastic service. Trains come by frequently that we didn't have much waiting time."
,,Easy access to hide from the rain!,5.0,,"The MRT is so easy, clean and safe. As long as you can read maps your life will be easy! Jumping between stations is easy and if going to Marina Bay Sands it is a great start to see the whole shopping district. You should catch the MRT just to see how public transport should be!"
,,"Functional, VERY CLEAN, well designed, QUIET cabins!",5.0,,"A nation's wealth is not measured as to how the poor and the middle class get to commute, but as to how much the high class travels. In Singapore even the wealthy use its mass transit system. It is dignified, VERY clean and very well designed. If only people of other countries (poor and rich) would understand as to how much it unifies a community.

Use it in Singapore, it has air conditioning, and it'll take you to most areas in the city."
,,Efficient,5.0,,"The MRT was clean, colour-coded, fast and easy to use. The trains are frequent so no long waits. There are lots of escalators which I initially found confronting but soon adapted. We travelled to and from Orchard Street to the airport, standing most of the way as the trains are busy. I think this would be a struggle with luggage. Travelling to HarbourFront precinct and to other destinations was a matter of following the colours on the map to that station. The MRT station nearest the large cruise ship terminal has very high escalators (There are probably elevators but I didn't see them) and is quite a long walk from the docking area so we chose to take a taxi from our hotel to our cruise ship due to the luggage; but in nearly every other trip in Singapore the MRT was our choice."
,,The lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,The most effective and fastest way of traveling in Singapore. The SMRT connects the entire city and makes travelling in Singapore much less tiresome.
,,very affordable travel for tourists,4.0,,"best way to travel in SG to anywhere needed , very well connected to Airport and many attractions . just hop on and hop off"
,,Great public transport,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is extremely efficient and very clean. Unfortunately, people do not comply with the signs to give seats to those in need (e.g. elderly, pregnant, disabled). The changes between stops and multitude of shops encountered can be a love/hate situation, but that is Singapore - shops are everywhere."
,,Best way of travel,5.0,,"Best get a map straight from the airport. Always ask for help as the lines can be quite confusing and missing a stop may take you a very long way away from your destination.
Ps. Always always always carry change. The ticket machines do no give out more than $4 change."
,,Brilliant way to travel,5.0,,"An absolutely brilliant way to,travel around Singapore. Buy yourself a pass card and you can use it on the train or bus, both of which are air conditioned. Really clean, safe and you never have to wait, there is always another one on the way. MRT gets very busy but is good way to travel"
,,Best Mode of Travel,5.0,,Taxis are expensive in Singapore. Public transport is good and SMRT is the best way to travel in Singapore.
,,Fabulous transport,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, easy to use, safe and even the other patrons are polite and courteous! I loved using MRT for a myriad of reasons, easy to get places, cheap, clean, efficient. Wonderful - and it goes to and from the airport!!!"
,,great way to go around,5.0,,"I bought a card for multiple use (up to 7 years) and re charged every couple of days, is the easy way to travel without paying every time you want to travel. The MRT works amazingly well, on time, clean, fast, and very easy to find the place to go. lots of signs in English and you may find a shopping center every place you come out from it. You can use also the card for the buses that again work absolutely well. recommended"
,,Best in the world,5.0,,"Clean, safe, efficient, fast, cost effective, extensive coverage. What more can you want? Tickets / Cards are easy to use, can be topped up instantly and helpful Staff on duty during peak times. And better still, there are easy to ready directions to prime locations and tourist sights. Many SMRT stations open directly into shopping malls. Destinations in themselves!Travel to the airport on the SMRT, but not a good idea if you have a lot of heavy bags."
,,So easy,5.0,,"Traveling around the city this way is so easy. Inexpensive, clean comfortable and quick. The hardest thing was trying to find our way out of the shopping mall's"
,,The Best Public MRT I've Experienced So Far,5.0,,"Fast, Reliable, clean and do not have much waiting time. You can use this mode of transportation when going around Singapore. Althou you can take their bus, but taking bus may get you lost if you dont know the stop since not all bus got a notice on what stop will be next. Taking SMRT is the best way to go around SG."
,,Excellent Transport System,4.0,,"Everything about the MRT is good. Purchasing the tickets is self service from a machine, with different languages available. The cost to get to anywhere in Singapore is cheap. Having travelled the world I can say that with comfort. From Orchard to Marina Bay Sands $1.75. The trains themselves cater for the traveller. A moving electronic map tells the traveller where you are at all times. The map also shows connecting line stations so you know where to get on and off to get to another MRT line. The travellers safety is paramount at all times on the system. The barriers that prevent access to the lines means parents can relax a little while waiting for a train because the little one cannot fall onto the lines. Easy, cheap method for travelling around Singapore."
,,SMRT - Daily use,5.0,,"SMRT is the easy way to get around Singapore as a tourist. Buy a smart card for SGD12 which will have SGD7 credit. You can only top up with SGD10 or more. Always clean, frequently busy but always easy to use."
,,A very clean and 4G accessible modern-city metro,4.0,,"The cheapest and one of the easiest ways around the city, much better to use during the day rather than wasting money on taxis etc.

Much better for use to and from the airport but be aware that there can be long waits between the services specifically to the airport. Ensure that you give yourself 15mins more than you think you need."
,,Best system,5.0,,What an amazing rail system. And really cheap. $20 For 3 days on the tourist pass. Takes you everywhere you want to go
,,So easy to use,4.0,,"Easy to use, clean and well organised. We bought a tourist card which made it easy to hop on and off as required. The only complaint is that you have to pay $10 SGD for the tourist card at the start and only get a refund when you take it back to a station with the correct information desk. Trying to get back to one of these stations is a waste of valuable travel time! We went to the one at the airport (even though it was located in a different terminal to our flight). If they didn't have this 'refund' scheme I would have given it 5 stars. I feel they just hope that you don't bother chasing the refund and they get to pocket the extra money. In our case it was $40 so was worth us finding the refund station!"
,,MRT,5.0,,Great way to get around the city. We used the transit card for the week and with a $10 top up we still had some change left on the card.
,,You can reach destiny in minutes:,5.0,,"It just justify the name which was given MRT .Rapid transport ..

3. Multi languages announcements & sign all over & easy access to the station."
,,"very efficient, safe and clean",5.0,,The SMRT is a must-experience in Singapore. Very efficient and convenient in getting around the city. The stations and trains are very clean. You don't have to worry about your bag getting dirty when putting it on the floor. It's also very safe. It may get crowded at times but still good.
,,Best way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"We travelled a lot on the MRT and if was inexpensive and easy to use. It takes a while to get used to the different lines but once you have mastered that, there is no problem"
,,Transport with ease.,5.0,,"One of the best ways to get around Singapore. Very easy to use, very reliable, very clean and very safe. All you'll need is to purchase the card.

Load it with about 300 Singapore dollars and follow the blue or green or red lines to your different destinations.

They can every 5 to 10mins. Just avoid peak time from 4.30 to 6.30pm and 6.30 to 8.30am. It can be very full at peak time."
,,Good transportation,5.0,,Is a good transportation to het around Singapore. Fast and reliable with many stops around the island
,,Brilliant,5.0,,What can you say except that this is a brilliant way to travel quickly from anywhere in Singapore. Very cheap and easy to negotiate. Trains are very clean and we nearly always got a seat no matter what time we travelled.
,,Makes other cities MRTs look ancient,5.0,,"Well designed, easy to use, cool, ordered, efficient, safe and reasonably priced. This has the lot and was a pleasure to use. Not sure whether you can use it with suitcases as we didn't see any travellers with them. No eating or drinking (so no debris like in London and New York). My SMRT map of two years ago did not have new lines on it as it is still developing."
,,All MRT services should aim to be this clean and efficient.,5.0,,The ONLY way to travel when in Singapore. Buy the Tourist Travel pass. (Check for the options re number of days and tie ins with other tourist attractions!) Also remember to return your card at the end of use and you'll get SGD 10 each returned to you.
,,Super cheap and super fast,5.0,,"Absolutely impressed by the train system in Singapore, so clean, efficient, fast and affordable. From the airport to our hotel was almost 30 kms, we only paid about USD2. The stations are located everywhere. I swear by uber but the MRT in Singapore is so convinient that there was no need for an uber."
,,Totally impressive,4.0,,"Just like any other means of transportation, the SMRT can be a pain in the butt during peak hours. But I am impressed by the cleanliness, accessibility, the user-friendly signs, staffs to entertain questions, the train that arrives on time. Exchanges may require you to walk for a few minutes but the SMRT is truly a gift to SG commuters. Kudos to the SG government for such an impeccable transport system."
,,Clean and on time,5.0,,"The best metro (underground or subway) that I've ever experienced. Clean, safe and on time! But don't try to bring any Durians with you...."
,,The only way to get around,5.0,,"Safe, clean, reliable and not expensive. We spent the whole journey saying ""why can't the tube be like this?"""
,,Cheap tickets,5.0,,"Bought a tourist card, three days 30 SGD out of which you get 10 back when you return the card. The card made it very easy to just jump on a bus or metro... the only downside with the metrosystem was upon arrival at Changi airport, the machine only accepted bills or coins, no card!
The kiosk selling tourist card doesnt open until 08am...

Why cant we buy touristcards in a machine, paying by card, 24/7?"
,,must go in singapore,4.0,,"very good experience. its clean and rules are followed . very fast to move from one place to other. well connected to harbour front(sentosa, universal studios, SEA aquarium) and all the place in singapore."
,,Easy to use,4.0,,No need to buy their tap card. Just buy a normal single ticket and keep charging your fares to that card. The 0.10 back on 3rd journey doesn't really matter. Can also buy discounted return journeys sometimes.
,,So easy to get around,5.0,,"The SMRT provides two things. An inexpensive and reliable transport system as well as a place to escape the heat and humidity. The air conditioned stations and trains are wonderful. The trains are frequent, fast and will get you to most parts of Singapore. A great way to travel."
,,"Very efficient, clean",5.0,,"To the extent I can, I like going by SMRT in Singapore. It's cheap, efficient, clean, safe and very convenient."

,,Very efficient,5.0,,Easy way to get around Singapore. Immaculate with no litter anywhere. Simple to find way around and cheap too. Need to buy Oyster card and top up as required.
,,"Fast, Clean, Easy, Cheap.",5.0,,"If only Sydney could learn from the MRT. We used this system for the 2 days we were in Singapore for a total of $16.00. Service was easy to use and follow, took us everywhere and was spotlessly clean. Designated area to get on and off which every other transport system globally could learn from. Best public transport system I have ever used."
,,"Amazing, clean, on-time and simple to understand",5.0,,"Loved the transit system - we were too far to walk to the Gardens by the Bay but took the MRT and were there in no time at all. Bought the 24-hr pass - don't remember the price but allows you to get on/off an unlimited amount of times during the 24-hr period. People are so disciplined in Singapore no pushing/shoving and no graffiti, it's so clean and pleasant and I never travel by public transport and if I lived here, I would use this all the time."
,,An excellent way to travel,5.0,,"Used this from changi airport to get to our hotel and for the odd trip around the city.so easy to use,and although busy and sometimes crowded.its the best way to get around the city.so clean,so efficient."
,,"Clean, easy and efficient!",5.0,,"My title says it all really. As with most of the Singapore facilities, the SMRT is a shining example of how to construct an efficient, clean and easy to use facility. Getting around becomes a breeze. Get yourself a pre-pay NETS Pay card if you are going to spend more than a few days in Singapore."
,,Trains,5.0,,"Stations, since we last visited, have gone underground and are a little more difficult to find, despite signage. However, once in the station you buy a ticket from various points, but not the person at the kiosk near barrier. It is quite simple to work out but there is always someone to ask if you get stuck. The trains are clean, comfortable and fast, but busy at rush hour (where aren't they?)."
,,"Fast, easy to navigate, cheap transport",5.0,,"It's the only way to travel around Singapore. We used it to get to and from all of the attractions, restaurants and shopping malls we went to. Trains were always on time and cost a fraction of any other means of transport!"
,,Good Transporation,5.0,,It's not too complicated. Very convenient to travel in Singapore by using MTR. You can by EZ - link card at the counter once you arrive the airport
,,MRT,5.0,,"I can only wish that Australia's rail system was as clean, precise and efficient as the MRT. There wasn't a place we couldn't go using the MRT. We felt safe the whole entire time and would have no issues letting my older children use this by themselves. The most we waited for a train was about 3 minutes. The station and the train themselves were very clean and tidy. Would definitely recommend people to use this."
,,Clean and efficent,5.0,,"Singapore is by far the safest city but the SMRT takes safety measures beyond necessary. You feel as a parent, safe."
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,The transit system is great in Singapore and is ever expanding with newer destinations coming up soon. The travel was cost-effective and swift.
,,Easy and affordable,5.0,,"Easy and affordable. I bought a card (5 SGD), which was not refundable, but I could add money and travel wherever, without having to buy a ticket each time. Also, you can use the card to a balance below $5, which means it will cost less than $5. So, if you want convenience, it's the way to go. However, the signs for exit locations weren't always clear and the MRT stops at midnight, which sucks. Still, overall, pretty awesome."
,,Perfect,5.0,,Transportation system with very organised system and people respecting the rules (all!). Highly recommended to take a multiple day pass for tourists.
,,Easy transportation,5.0,,"Very rare that I would fully endorse public transport, however this is clean, safe, easy to use, on the time and incredibly easy to get around"
,,GREAT TRANSPORT,5.0,,"We caught both the train and buses around Singapore which were very good and the drivers of the buses were excellent. Both buses and trains were on time and there were plenty of them. We bought a 3 day visitor pass which was $30 each but when you took the pass back after the 3 days you got $10 each back, so with unlimited travel on both buses and trains, it was certainly a good buy."
,,So easy to use and a good deal,5.0,,"It was so easy to use the SMRT, they have convenient stops and it is a great way to get around. We bought the cards, so it was nice that we always had enough money for it"
,,Easy Local Travel,5.0,,"Easy, efficient and cheap, can travel from the Marina area, tourist spots and the shopping areas with ease, good signage, ticket booths simple to operate and cheap."
,,"Highly Recommended,Travel like a Local",4.0,,"Forget the Tourist Card! We bought an EZ.Link card for sgd12, non-refundable $5 + $7 worth of travel. It makes each trip cheaper & for the 4 days we used it regularly including to/from Changi A/port & Cruise ship port we only topped up (easy) $10 & didn't use all that up. The destination system is easy to understand & displayed clearly & audibly on the trains."
,,Great,5.0,,"Very good transport. Very convenient. Can be very busy sometimes but just wait for the next one. There is a train every 5 to 10 minutes. $20 3 day tourist pass is great, unlimited rides in train and buses"
,,Very good system with easy to follow signafe,5.0,,"Buy a tourist card - 3 days is the best value at $20 with the additional refundable $10 for the card. Just be aware that you can only buy at eight stations - Bugis, Airport, City Hall, Chinatown, ANG, Raffles Place, Orchard and Harbour Front. There are maps showing the local area so you can find the best exit to wherever you are going. Trains seemed very regular and although well used there was never a crush."

,,Working hard to bring people around Singapore quickly,5.0,,"Built almost 30 years ago, it certainly is facing challenges with the increasing population. But it is meeting the challenge by having increasing train frequency. Not the best but still reliable."
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"I used the metro lots while I was in Singapore. It is very easy to figure out as everything is well explained and mapped out. If you are unsure there are staff there to help.
I found the price to be quite good, and lots of the tourist stops are along the metro. It is air conditioned as well so it's a nice escape from the heat every now and then."
,,Four Days in Singapore,4.0,,"Used SMRT extensively in Singapore, paying with ez.link card. Bus drivers showed great skill and traffic awareness but not always easy to find out which bus to catch. Underground train service very good, but in a number of cases, distance from boarding/alighting from trains was considerable, sometimes passing through underground shopping areas devoid of places to sit and rest"
,,Shopping trip,5.0,,"We decided to go shopping at Jurong East so took the train. Great way to travel. Easy, clean and cheap."
,,Very good service,5.0,,"Very good service on the north east line. Staff were friendly too. We appreciated and really liked the adverts such as #bagsdownbenny and #standupstacey. Great way and quick, plus cheap way to get round town!"

,,Best way of getting around,5.0,,"Super clean, safe, cheap and efficient - brilliant way to get around this amazing city. Used it all week"
,,Only way to easily get around Singapore,5.0,,Mass Rapid Transit or MRT is simply the easiest and most cost effective way to get around. A map is helpful and as in most cities the trickiest part is picking the right exit and finding the same one when you return!!
,,reliable and cheap,4.0,,"taxis can become very expensive and very hard to get especially on weekdays and peak hour ,the trains are readily available and pretty easy to use ,grab yourself a ticket out the machine at any platform ,the locals are more than ready to help you out .being a very small country the train lines will take you to most of the tourist areas"
,,One of the excellent transportation system in Asia,5.0,,"Whenever I am visiting Singapore either on Business or Leisure, I make use of the MRT and found it to be very convenient and user friendly. It's very economical and reliable mode of transportation. It's one of the best in Asia."

,,"Clean, Easy & Effecient",5.0,,"Clean, easy and efficient. Just gets you to your destination. Lots of signage, and guides on direction in almost all stations."
,,Best way to navigate when in Singapore,5.0,,"Affordable rates compared to taxis, the SMRT has integrated buses, metro and even some taxis under its fold to truly form a multi-modal transport service. One can use the same card (EZ-Link or NETS) between modes of transport. The buses and metro are clean and safe. My recommendation is take the bus, even though it will be a longer journey. But the views that the bus has to offer for a reasonable amount cannot be matched."

,,"Clean, on time and convenient",5.0,,"I'm a regular in Japan, so I have a fair idea of how an efficient subway works. Using the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit was a pleasure and is on a par with the Tokyo Metro. Trains weren't crowded when I got on at midday and there are many convenient locations for stops."
,,Very convenient even you have luggages or wearing coat and tie!,5.0,,"It seems complicated on the first ride. But all you need to know is where are you heading and read the guide where it will point your direction. For first time tourist like us, the picture of map below came in handy.

,,Most convinient,5.0,,This is most convenient for tourist. We paid 20 SGD for 3 days unlimited pass with included MRT and buses. Get the MRT map as there are simultaneous rails running to the same destination.
,,Best public transport ever,5.0,,"I love the mrt! Cheap enough and gets you all over the city efficiently. We bought the tourist pass which if you know you'll be going all over is definitely worth it, there are 1 day or 2 day passes. Easy, clean and everywhere."
,,Efficient,5.0,,This metro system is very efficient and we never waited more than 3 minutes. For English speaking visitors it is clear and straight forward. We did not buy a $10 daily card as always stayed under that amount.
,,SmartTube,5.0,,"very modern efficient travel system, quick,safe and clean. New lines being added. cheap and quick way of moving around the city."
,,"Easy, Clean and Convenient",5.0,,"The computer interface to buy tickets is easy. It is like a really big iPad! Lol. Unfortunately it takes cash and small multiple denominations. We had to break our $10 SGD at the customer service counter. The machine didn't want to accept the large denomination.

It is quite easy to get the hang of it. Honestly this MRT is a hell of a lot easier and cleaner than the Métro in Paris."
,,Easy to use and very efficient,5.0,,"Our family group used the SMRT exclusively for our weekly holiday. It is safe, clean, efficient and very well priced. We used a combination of the buses and trains, both systems very easy to follow. We purchased the tourist pass, with virtually unlimited travel and returned the card after 3 days to have the deposit refunded. Very seamless and hassle free way for travel within Singapore."
,,So efficient,5.0,,"My son and I caught the SMRT from Changi Airport to Harbourfront Station when we first arrived in Singapore. We were unsure whether or not we should as we were not familiar with the public transport in Singapore, but I read it was really easy and so cheap, so we tried our luck as we were not too tired from the flight (Melbourne - Singapore). All the signs in Singapore are in English as well as the local languages.

As soon as we left immigration and customs with our baggage, we just followed the signs to MRT. We went to see the customer service/ticket office and the lady changed a S$10 into S$1 coins and told us to use the automated ticket machine. I had a photo of the train lines so we knew where we needed to go. We were staying on Sentosa Island, so we had to go to Harbourfront Station, then get the Sentosa Express across to the island. The ticket machines are point to point, or you can buy a tourist card for S$10 per day which gives you unlimited use. We knew we didn't need to unlimited card, so we opted for point to point.

The machines are touch screen. You can choose the station name or touch the train line you need, then all the relevant station names pop up on the screen. It cost us S$2.60 per person to go from Changi airport to Harbourfront. The first time you use the machine you pay an extra 10c which pays for the card. Each card can be used 6 times before you need to buy a new card. On the 3rd use, you get your 10c refunded. On the 6th trip you get a 10c discount on your trip. So if you know you will be uses the MRT a few times in Singapore, keep your card as you can re-use it.

After you have paid and your card has been issued (or topped up if this is your 2nd or more trip) all you have to do is follow the signs to the relevant train line and touch on. The gates then open to let you through. At the other end of your trip, the funds will be taken from the card. If you do get off at a different station, whatever you paid will be taken from your card, however, if you go to a further station, you will get stopped from going through the gate as you may not have enough funds. But that is easily fixed. You just go to the customer service booth and pay the difference. Easy.

On the train and at the station, you are not allowed to eat or drink and there is a sign saying so. You will get an on the spot fine of S$500 if caught. On the train, there are reserved seats for the elderly, disabled, pregnant ladies or anyone who may need a seat. Everyone is so respectful and even though someone may sit on the reserved seats, they are also the first to stand up if someone in need gets on.

When the train approaches a station, above the doors light up to show you which side to get off and the train lines up exactly to the barrier doors. It is so efficient. On the train there are maps and the voice over tells you which station is next. We were very impressed.

The only thing is it can get very busy during peak times and can also get very hot."
,,Singapore Island Travel,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a great mode of transport and ever increasing in size, and combined with the LRT (light rail) allows easy and affordable access Island wide.
For short stays, a ""Tourist Pass"" is available for unlimited daily travel on the MRT, LRT and Bus networks, see details at the stations or online.
The MRT runs underground near the city centre, but it is above ground outside this area and is also a good way to see around the Island."

,,super convenient mass transit system in my own opinion,4.0,,very convenient and quite clean (compare to the time that they've opened for commuter to use) There're times to tell you that how long you have to wait for a train (very helpful) there are many lines which provide to every parts of the city
,,Great Transport system,5.0,,So easy to use and get around the city on the mrt . Hate coming back to Brisbane and using our way overpriced public transport . If we had somethin like this the traffic problems would ease right up.
,,Singapore,3.0,,"Travelers to avoid the morning peak from 6am - 10am, however if you would like to experience the Singapore working crowd in the train, you are very much welcome to. If you have been to Tokyo peak period before, you wouldn't mind in Singapore as there is always space for you to squeeze through the middle."
,,Its about knowing where you are and where you want to go,5.0,,Whilst over many years we have both lived and holidayed in Singapore we have found that traveling by the SMRT is quick and efficient. The buses and trains are alway clean and the local passengers are quick to help and advise if you are not to sure of the the place you are trying to get to. Also the staff on the stations are more than happy to explain how to buy a ticket and the most economical way for your short or long stay in Singapore. It is not are our only mode and choice of travel however we recommend you give it a try.

,,EaSY,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is easy to get around with. The problem is, Taxis are also cheap and easy to get around in. MRT is expanding and making Singapore more accessible. A model a lot of other countries should look at."
,,Comeomplexity made simple,5.0,,"At first it was a challenge until we got the hang of the color coded routes. No worries about wasting your money since it charges based on your entry and exit point. This means if you accidentally take the wrong train, all you wasted was your time. You simply hop back on and go your way. Also, people don't care about your fashion... to each his own. Elderly and pWD and parents with kids have priority seats near all doorways."
,,Great network across the entire island,5.0,,"The MRT is a safe clean reliable transport system that allows you to get around Singapore.

Almost every destination can be accessed by the network.

You can use it to get from Changi Airport to the city but you have to change trains. I use it when I know I'm going with the traffic and want to avoid long delays.

You can buy single trip tickets at every station with cash or cards. If you know you're going to use the MRT for a few days then but a multi trip pass. It's much quicker than purchasing a ticket each time."
,,Most convenient form of transportation in Singapore,4.0,,SMRT is the easiest way to get around Singapore. Frequency of trains ranges from 4-6 minutes off peak to 2-3 minutes at peak hours. Many places of interest and attractions are accessible via the SMRT train services.
,,"Best mass transit in the world imo, however.....",4.0,,"Been 10 years since we we're last in Singapore and always remembered how good the underground was. This time with even more lines open it was still excellent, quick cheap and spotlessly clean. The only down side was purchasing tourist day tickets now seems limited to only a few stations. This is great if you start at one of them but if not you then need to purchase single tickets to get the the nearest station that offers tourist day passes and then have the same issue when handing the tickets back for your refunded deposit at the end of your trip."
,,"The most efficient, cost n time saving ways to see this tiny little red dot in just one day.",4.0,,"On your arrival at Changi Airport, u easily can hop onto a train, n before u can even make out the public train networks in Singapore, u will arrive at Tanah Nerah station-a Neighbourhood station nestled right in the eastern part of Singapore's populated housing n private estates! N from here, u easily Breeze thru from east to eastern most end-Punggol station which is a mere four stops away (seafood n waterfront facing Malaysia), or u change west bound train to the very most western end of Singapore-where almost all of the world's biggest manufacturing industries r located (n is a mere 40+km ride).

Not satisfy, hoo back to opposite eastern direction of the same east-west line to central city-u have a choice of City Hall station to connect u to the north-south line (literally vertical line that u get to see The Central n northern part of Singapore in under 1 hour! Or, u prefer highrise n modern skyscrapers, connect at Dolby Ghaut for the downtown line that take u thru the heart of the financial district n China town. N here, u have another choice to take the north east or circle line. Simply put it, Singapore can easily Breeze thru within a day!"

,,Great Mass Transit in Asia,5.0,,It's better to take the SMRT if you want to get around Singapore better. It's inexpensive and very efficient. You can buy a Day pass for those short stay in the city or if you are staying longer it's more economical to buy an Ez-link card (around $12). You can use it for the trains and buses as well. Getting around the city is so easy and fast if you go by SMRT.

,,What else would you expect from a Singapore rapid transit,5.0,,"Clean, new equipment, fantastic schedule, easy to understand maps. In other words, exactly what one would expect from a Singaporean public transit system. If the heat & humidity starts to get you down, definitely take the SMRT"

**Just don't eat or drink on the platform (even though there's no signs, tourists are just expected to know that) nor on the trains (where there signs in the carriages. Otherwise, you'll experience just how 'fine' Singapore can be if you get a fine from a platform or train official!"

,,Unless you're into ballroom dancing Avoid the dancing guy or eye contact with crooners in the MRT in Singapore...,3.0,,"Always a fun ride on the Singapore MRT - I recommend the ride for people who want to know Singapore a little better - yes we know it's a city of often reserved but super-motivated super-achieving people. In the MRT you will see that these Singaporean super-heroes are ... well... people: they get tired like the rest of us, like ordinary mortals they don't get enough sleep, like most people around the world, Singaporeans smile when they see kids doing cute things on their phones and like most people they respond with courtesy to courteous people. I highly recommend investing a few minutes in looking at the MRT map and figure out the stations you need to go to (very easy!) - do ask other commuters about stations and their favourite hawker around - you will be rewarded with smiles and lengthy recommendations of great food places that few discover! While your trip here will be a very rewarding one, there are a few things that you could do to enhance your fun-stay: like in most big cities, Singapore has it's own fair share of people who seem to be compelled by higher powers to exhibit dancing moves that in my mind connect Asian martial arts with a less coordinated version of William Hung ""singing"" ""She Bangs"" - there are only a few such crooners in the trains (4.6078% of the train population) plying their moves in the trains, but if you are lucky and you take the East-West line 3.524 times a day for 3 days in a row, you will be rewarded (your probabilities of witnessing the art event will be 78.9524%). Like good art, these highly convoluted moves are best appreciated from a distance (2.752 meters recommended / 108.34646 inches) - preferably after a few glasses (3) of wine at Zafferano's or Garibaldi's (or both...) - or 5 nice cold Tiger beers from the Auntie in Lau Pa Sat (just ask for the Beer Auntie there... she runs the place...). While the general recommendation is to just watch & smile while avoiding eye contact with the artists. Should you feel a higher calling moving you to shake the booty in time to the imaginary music, please ensure you are not intruding in the ""sacred-dancing-space"" (3.75 m2 or 5812.512 square inches) that naturally belongs to the artist... your intervention could be considered rude, especially if your dancing moves are a tad more elaborate or better practiced than the ones exhibited by the afore-mentioned artist. A separate mention should be given to those romantic singers that take it upon themselves to entertain the whole train with their melodic prowess. You will appreciate their passionate work ethic as these shy artists never stop singing out loud those melodies that - I am told are beautiful to their inner ear. Their eyes closed, their bodies ever so gently moving to the inaudible music, their hands painting invisible clouds and / or mountains with energetic and wide arm movements that are best avoided. If you are not sure how to behave when faced with so much art in the train, you can take a cue from the behaviour of the other commuters which follow the local unpublished guidelines: 32.8333% of the train population must sleep until they reach their destination (this seems to be compulsory and the sleeping can be done either standing or sitting), 48.7355% will closely and attentively monitor moving coloured lights in their preferred mobile devices (this also seems to be compulsory and people can choose to do this from either a standing or a seated position) - this leaves the remainder 18.4312% of the train population - neatly divided in 2 groups of 9.2156% each (Did I mention that Singapore is organised?), one of these two groups are the audience for the above mentioned artists and they may occasionally clap of cheer the artists. The other 9.2156% is again neatly divided in 2 groups of 4.6078% of the train population which represent your ""on-duty"" dancer & singers. I enjoyed my train rides - of course these thoughts are written with some cheeky sense of fun and my words can be challenged by a more mathematical mind who will spot an opening for a continuation of the fun ideas entertained with a smile on a train ride. Singapore is a safe place where you will meet fun people that work and play hard, be prepared with a good sense of humour - you will find fun and great friendships, even in a mundane train trip in Singapore."

It provides the fastest way to get around this crowded city and the number of lines enable visitors to traverse the islands many tourist attractions.

,,"Clean, cool easy ride.",5.0,,"It breaks down from time to time, with the loudest complaints from the locals! But if and when there is the rare breakdown, you get bus rides to cover the trip. Free. Best way to travel quickly around Singapore to most of the tourist spots. Also a nice way to explore the suburbs where there are shops usually around the train stations. Best way to trip from the airport too. Get a stored value card from the train station as it is more value for money. You can use it too for bus rides. Most stations are linked to bus stations so you get seamless travel. For those who cannot find a Human selling tickets, just go to the turnstiles and near it will be an office with a Human ! Cash works better than a credit card since the fares and fare cards are low (starting at S$1 for fares and stored value cards around S$10)."
,,"Clean, clean, clean",5.0,,"What a pleasure it is to ride on the MRT, coming from Australia the trains are always dirty and smelly. Buy a $5 card and load it with some money and away you go. It is so cheap, some rides are less than 70 cents."

We are an Australian couple and I personal have caught minimal public transport in Australia and my partner never caught public transport. We read the reviews that said it's the best way and to forget about taxis. They are correct! A few minutes in the mrt and you can get anywhere! It's easy, quick, air conditioning, soo clean!
We are terrible with directions but we found it straight forward. One thing we did not enjoy as much was the bus. Though they also were clean and cool they are not as easy to find your way back to main areas.

Not to mention that every station has incredible malls in it! Food courts, main tourist attractions etc"
,,Very organized,4.0,,I used the service a number of times when I came into Singapore for a business trip. Well organized and easy to use.
,,Way to go,5.0,,It is so easy to get around Singapore on the MRT. It is so clean & once you get used to it it is fantastic to use.
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,We bought easy link card from airport and traveled almost everywhere in Singapore by MRT as part of my 6 day trip.
,,I always use MRT when I'm in Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is great, it covers a lot area, fast, clean, waiting time between the train about 5 minutes only."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"Very cheap and efficient mode of transport and very easy. Didn't bother with the tourist ezi card. Just used the normal ezi link card and was cheap and could use it on buses too. If I had time I used the bus instead of MRT to enjoy the view. The MRT is mostly underground, I think."
,,Simple quiet and clean,5.0,,"The subway or train or MRT system is unsurprisingly Singaporean...clean, quite and efficient.

Whilst we had the challenge of a ticket machine that wasn't working and the officer in his booth that couldn't sell us a ticket (you get the continuous loop involved) in the end we were directed to another ticket machine about 150 m away that worked.

Once we had a ticket and knew (with the forewarning of our hotel concierge) which lines and which ""end point"" (end point being the end of the line in which you need to travel....cause that's how the signs are market in the subway) it all becomes very clear and simple to follow.

Air conditioned and clean and quiet with a safe and with a friendly hum we found out way to Santosia via train, tram and bus....very easy and no stress.

If you have the time to try it out you might find you stop taking taxis and start to take the train....like we did."
,,Best of its kind on the world!,5.0,,"At 77c per trip, never waiting more than a couple of minutes and fully air conditioned. This metro system made life so easy to get around. Whilst it would have slightly longer walks underground in the stations compared to London. It was so clean and efficient it makes very little difference.

A really excellent system."
,,Rode the MRT everywhere,5.0,,"The Singapore metro system also called MRT is one of the best in the world in my books. To put it simply its fast, efficient, affordable, easy to figure out and very safe. It works by line colors, destinations and platform numbers. The best way to get a ticket is first to figure out which station you need to go to, then go to a machine and search the station you need which would be listed in alphabetic order. Upon selecting the proper station you will be prompted to use a single ticket or a return one. You can pay by cash or credit card; please note that you can use coins and notes of $2 and $5 only (change provided). Metros run one after the other with intervals of 1-5 minutes. There are monitors throughout the station also indicating the status of a particular line I.e. Fluid, delayed, canceled etc. The MRT will also take you to the airport on the green line which is about a 40 minutes ride from Chinatown with a change of platform at the Tanah M stop and boat terminal.

It's hard to get lost as everything is well sign posted in English, Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil. Attendants are also friendly and willing to help with directions should you need help. Remember rules are strict in Singapore so don't litter, chew gum, smoke and drink/eat in the subway. I did not feel threaten anywhere and at any time of the day or night but like in any big city and metro systems don't flash money around and keep your valuables on you and hidden at all time to prevent pick-pocketing."
,,Excellent System,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for 4 days, bought the EZ pass for $12 ($7 for fares & $5 non-refundable). It's cheaper to get the card as the fares per trip is almost half price than buying individual ticket. It is also convenient as no need to lineup for tickets every trip, just tap and go.Transit system is excellent and easy to follow. We loaded additional $10 as we couldn't use card for MRT if card is below $3. No problem taking MRT on our last day to the airport, Still had $3 left in the pass that we got our refund back after our last trip. Note: walking from 1 platform to another in some connecting stations can be quite long.Overall, LOVE using SMART"
,,Fast,5.0,,With its fast arrival all the time the most you have to wait is only at most 4mins nothing more. It also reaches the destination very fast. The environment is clean.
,,Good fast safe but no trash cans,5.0,,"You can easily purchase single trips from the machines. I didn't saw any actual ticket selling person and was unable to use the credit card to pay for trips so be prepared with Singaporean cash, coins and small denominations. It is very easy to use, fast and safe. Food and eating are prohibited and this seems to translate into not having any trash cans around, you need to exit to find one. Of course there is a fine if you decide to just throw the garbage."
,,Convenient and great value!,5.0,,I love the public transportation system in Singapore! The busses and trains are clean and cool. Very easy to use! Great price for access to anywhere in Singapore!

We ate in one of the restaurants and the food was good. the super trees are just that and be sure to time your visit from mid afternoon to the evening to take in the city lights and cool evening temperatures
,,Easy to use transport,5.0,,"My wife and I were in Singapore for 4 days and used the MRT extensively as it was so easy to use. We bought 3 day tourist passes which cost us S$20 each plus S$10 each deposit for the cards which was refunded when you returned the card. The trains are reliable, punctual, very, very long and dead easy to use. They are the only way to travel in Singapore. We visited Pulau Ubin island and had to get the MRT then a bus to the ferry terminal. Our tourist passes allowed us to also use the bus which was excellent."

,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Using public transport, especially the metro, is the best way to get around Singapore as there is a lot of traffic.

,,Take the Bus!,5.0,,"We rode the bus from the Changi prison museum back to our hotel. Taxi to get here 20 bucks, ride back 2 bucks!"

,,"Clean, Modern, Efficient",4.0,,"When I am in Singapore as I was recently, I usually get around using the MRT. It's the quickest way to get around Singapore and it is clean, modern and efficient with excellent air-conditioning throughout the trains and stations and subsidised (Very low) prices. Other major world cities should eat their hearts out about this transit system which beatls ALL the others hands down.

Highly recommended and it just isn't worth using Taxis (which also are not expensive in Singapore) to get around Singapore, especially at Peak times. The one exception is to/from the Airport where a $SIN 20 taxi ride is worth paying as the MRT ride out to Changi is slow and involved Multiple changes so not convenient, especially with bags."
,,Using the SMRT to see Singapore worked well for us.,5.0,,"We purchased multiple day tickets. We covered the city by rail, underground and city buses. They are immaculate, comfortable and easy to use. We would do it all over again."
,,"Clean, safe, efficient and impressive. But prepare for the ticket queues.",4.0,,"We found the MTR to be safe, clean and efficient way to get around Singapore. My only negative was that for such a modern metro system with expansive ticket halls, was the lack of ticketing machines. Indeed the queues were so enormous at the Marina Bay Sands station (and with roped up queue lines an obviously regular occurrence) we gave up and walked to our destination because it was quicker than queuing."
,,"Super convenient, clean, safe, and reliable way to get around Singapore",5.0,,"Used the SMRT to get around the city, and I would say it's one of the best public transportation systems I've ever seen. It's super clean, convenient, and safe. Very affordable too!"

Easy to use. We got a 2 day MRT and bus travel card for 16SGD per person so not too bad at all!

It will take you to many of the must see attractions too!"
,,Affordable and efficient,4.0,,"Affordable and efficient mode of transport, with waiting time of about 3-5 mins. However, there can be some hiccups here and then whereby there are train faults. But free shuttle services will then be provided."

,,Singapore MRT - Use It,5.0,,"The MRT is easy to use, understand to get around Singapore. Its very clean, very cheap, friendly and very safe. The service is amazing and one of the best in the world.

Easy to navigate and low rates at non peak starting at 10am or maybe 9am where everybody is in the office. The train system covers every corner of Sg as what I noticed and you get to see the whole SG using it. I was able to see chinatown, little india, botanic gardens, sentosa, orchard road and expo and no problems to and from the Changi Airport. Here are the photos I was able to get around Sg."
,,Fast and efficient way to travel,4.0,,MTR service offers fast cheap and convenient way to travel around Singapore... However the only issue is there is not much of an enquiry section and one has to figure out on his own the route and stations of travel which might become a bit confusing for the first timers....
,,"Cheap, fast, clean",5.0,,"Easiest way to get around Singapore. Best to get a card and not buy single tickets. Load up the card, swipe, travel!"

,,The best way to move around the city,5.0,,"We used the SMRT from day one of our visit because it worked! Fares are a few $, trains are literally every few minutes, spotlessly clean and on time. Simple to buy tickets from the self service machines using cash or credit card and live progress graphics show where you are within the system so no missed stops.

A great system"
,,Best Metro in the World,5.0,,"The Singapore Metro is undoubtably the best Metro in the world. You can travel to all the attractions and go all over the small country using just the Metro. We used it for so many attractions and it was so convenient and friendly. The metro itself was very good and though they do have some old trains, they are still quite good. Just download the app or google the map and see the nearest attractions to every station and you can travel throughout.

The only con is I felt it as slightly expensive and they should reduce the cost for tourists. Do visit it once just for the experience...."
,,Best we have used,5.0,,"Clean, air conditioned, easy o understand and manoeuvre and use and usually direct access to locations where you are visiting."
,,Convenience and cheap!,5.0,,"The transportation when you are in Singapore by mrt is very useful and convenience. The cost is really cheap , even from airport to downtown for 1.60$ singapore!

,,One of the best if not the best rail transit in the world,5.0,,"Very clean, runs on time, fast and trains are very frequent, one every 2 minutes. I also like the fact that the platforms are fully enclosed, i.e. there is an automatic door on the platform which opens in tandem with the train door so that it is very safe. The train fare is very cheap when using the MRT prepaid card. The subway is air-conditioned so it is so comfortable even when it is very hot and humid outside."
,,Public transport made easy,5.0,,"Used the MRT extensively on our recent 6 day trip to Singapore. It's cheap, easy to use, clean, and air conditioned!"
,,Very convenient and clean,5.0,,"The MRT system is well laid out and easily understood. If you are riding on the newer ones, not only will they tell you what the next stop is, it also tells you which side you are going to get off the compartment.

The train is also very clean and well maintained. The best part is in each compartment there are seats reserved for people with needs (ie elderly, pregnant, handicapped). And people in Singapore are very courteous, they always leave these reserved seats empty for people who are in need."

,,Went all over the city.,5.0,,"This was a very easy system to use. High tech, clean and efficient. Never waited more than 3 or 4 minutes for a train, if that. Lots and lots of escalators to make walking underground easier for customers. I used this every day. Never got lost. Even took it out to the Bird Park, where it ran outside and I was able to view Singapore neighborhoods as the train went from stop to stop.

Purchased the smart card and rode all week. Trains were very inexpensive. $20-25 Singapore dollars would last you all week. Lines were color coded. A little map of the train system was all you needed. Signs were in English. No eating or drinking on the trains or in the stations. Was air conditioned everywhere."
,,Brilliant way to get around,5.0,,"The trains are clean, frequent and fast. Ticket machines easy to use. The routes cover most of the island. Try it!"
,,Just brilliant,5.0,,"This must be the cheapest, cleanest, quickest system in the world. We just used a one day pass for $10, great value. Very easy to find your way around."
,,The ONLY way to travel around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore's underground is air-conditioned, fast, efficient, clean, hassle-free. Great connections anywhere you wanna go in town.

I know the modern world is smartphone mad but I think Singapore must be ""The"" smartphone city. On the MRT, from the young to the old they are constantly on their phones. Not experienced anything like it anywhere else!!! No-one seems to talk to each other. Very different!"
,,Easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,We were so impressed with the Mass Rapid Transport. It was so easy and a cheap way of getting around Singapore. It helps to take the time to familiarise yourself with the coloured lines so you know which line goes where and where to change. You can obtain a brochure from your hotel. It didn't take us long to utilise the MRT without a problem. It puts our railway system to shame.
,,Ease of travel within Singapore,5.0,,"The ""SMRT"" system in Singapore will save you time and money when visiting. Buy yourself a ""SMRT card"" and use the combination of trains and busses - plus some taxis - to move around this new-age, tropical paradise."

,,Good if no maintenance,4.0,,"Its quite good and fast with very understandable map of all. The place is clean and cold enough when you need to travel around as a tourist on hot weather.

So far is ok as long as no broken down or last minute maintenance, because its hard to find the free shuttle bus for tourists who are unfamiliar with this case"

,,"MRT safe, easy, inexpensive",5.0,,"We used the MRT in Singapore early this month(Mar/17). We were directed from Terminal 1 in the airport via free train to Terminal 3 then down the escalators and to the ticket booth. We purchased the $12 (Sing dollar card, about $12 CAD) . This is $5 for the card, $7 for travel each. You tap the card on entry to MRT and again on the way out. This shows you how much you have on the card, and after how much you paid. The airport to Lavender on the Green Line cost us $1.57 each. Our Hotel Boss was 300 yards or so walk away. The MRT takes you where ever need to go to all major tourist sites easily and cheaply. You may have to top it up ($10 increments), but when you use it last, they will cash it in and you get any unused portion back and you get to keep the card for your next visit. It eve has a stop at the cruise port terminal, with a roofed over walkway to the port. Best deal ever."

,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Easy to use with signage available in English, excellent system of transport . Tickets can be purchased for single journeys, but better value worth considering is a daily ticket or more if staying for a while."
,,Easy Travels,5.0,,"The only issue we had was trying to find a ticket station to buy new tickets, Chinatown was our closest, but after that it was smooth travels - literally! Efficient, clean, cool and it seemed we never had to wait more than 3-mins for our train. Pricing is excellent, there are multi day traveller tickets (you have to pay a refundable deposit) or you can buy their normal pass for $5 (not refundable)."
,,Go MRT! All the way!,5.0,,"Fantastic public transport - really cheap, clean, easy to use ... very efficient. The travel Carr costs $12 and $7 of that is for train fares. And you can top up when you need to."

,,Excellent service,5.0,,"The MRT is amazing, always on time and the fairs are very reasonable. It is accessible from many stations around Singapore and would encourage anybody to use it."
,,SMRT..very good..😊,4.0,,"It's the 2nd time walking with friend by MRT..they're very..very happy..
They feel that very easy to learn how to use MRT in Singapore..
Next visit they feel comfortable to use it by themself using EZlink card..the price is much better compare with taxi..

The EZlink card also can use for bus..so we can explore Singapore until midnight..
One thing..for the public toilet and station in certain station, like Chinatown.. need more attention to be cleaner and smell good..

Anyway we're very happy exploring Singapore with MRT and the bus..
The staff at the office and the bus driver very helpfull..

Also the Singaporean passanger in the MRT..very nice..pleased the elderly to sit..

But there is 1 thing as an adult going to eldery come from eastern.. some time we feel uncomfortable looking at a loving couple of teenager..with attractive action in front of us.. too demonstratic in front of thepublic..

Hope Singapore government will built more not only physical building like new MRT station..and more budget hotel not in the central but in suburb area..but also the culture of Asian.."
,,"Clean, fast, easy, organized",5.0,,"The best way to get around the city even if you are traveling with kids.
The connectivity is good and we used it as our main mode of transport throughout our weeklong trip.
The 3 day pass is amazing for tourists as it allows free travel in metro and buses also.
Only difficulty is if you have too much luggage like transit to airport."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit - the name says it all!,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transit - that sums it up quite well.

I can also add that it is clean, efficient, prompt, and took us to or close to just about any attraction we wanted to go to.

And to top it off the visitor pass is a cheap."
,,5 day break,5.0,,"Very efficient travel system, be prepared to be standing and packed in. The trains run like clockwork."

,,nice smrt,4.0,,"really discipline and clean, Indonesia should be make this smrt.. I fall in love with Singapore transportation.."
,,"Clean, cheap, safe and on time",5.0,,"Easy to get around, the only way to travel in Singapore. Clean, air conditioned, safe, beautiful, with food shops and services within the subway system. The MRT could teach other cities a few things."
,,So easy,4.0,,The signing is clear and easy to follow. The carriages are safe and spacious. The announcements are clear. The network is comprehensive. And the cost is minimal.
,,What you would expect,5.0,,"Fast, efficient, regular, good value for money. Some of the stations (in the bowels of shopping malls) can be tough to find despite the sign posting. But overall it's very useful"
,,Easy to use,5.0,,So clean and really easy to use. We used the Singapore tourist pass (forgot to redeem it though to get our $10 back) Will definitely use again on my return trip
,,Best Subway in the World,5.0,,"We were amazed at the efficiency and clean cars. There are many helpful volunteers at the station to help you get on the correct subway line. This was so quick and easy for us. Sure puts Washington DC subway to shame. Also amazingly cheap to use.

Please note that that Singapore is a fine place to visit. Beware because there are many fines (tickets) that can be given to you for smoking, eating or spitting on this subway. The reason this system is so clean is because they do enforce the regulations."
,,Best we have ever seen,5.0,,"We have travelled extensively and this metro is the cleanest and safest we have come across. Also very good value with easy to use ticket machines. The metro whisks you all oiver Singapore quickly and easily. The only disappointing thing is that young Singaporeans men and women do not give up their seats even in the reserved seats for older people, people with children and pregnant womed etc. We are in our late 60's and stood for most of the time,"
,,"Cheap, fast",5.0,,A very good way of moving round the city (and you want to minimise walking in that climate). Tourist passes are very good value ($10 deposit) and save buying a ticket for each journey.
,,Clean metro,5.0,,"So easy to use and get around to wherever you want to go! Used it to go to night safari, still needed to get additional transportation there."
,,The best yet,5.0,,"Fabulous, clean and modern Much better than London or Paris. The train system is flawless and the stations are unbelievably futuristic and extremely safe. Impossible for anyone to fall onto a track or get hit by a moving train."
,,"Very quick , sophisticated rides",4.0,,"1. Can buy tickets with with both SGD notes and coins
2. Attenders at almost every stations' ticket machine who speak good english to answer your queries
3. Additionally , one can look for 'Passengers Service' points for elaborated enquiries
4. Very clean toilets at the stations
5. Has fast escalators and walkators
6. Can use the same ticket upto six times
7. Extensive and very helpful MRT maps

One tip : before deciding to get to a MRT...better browse the place in Google Map to get the NEAREST stations ( to avoid too much of walking)"
,,"about the same as NYC, very clean though",4.0,,"Taking the SMRT got us where we wanted to go and everything felt clean and safe. We were with a friend who lived there so not sure about user friendly, but it seemed so."
,,An Amazingly Fast & Convenient Transportation System,4.0,,"Used the MRT 5-6 times and found it highly accessible, safe, good value for money, and most importantly, time saving! The MRT Stations as well as the trains are incredibly clean and hygienic. Best transportation medium for people visiting Singapore :)"
,,Easy and Convenient for Travellers,5.0,,"The MRT is convenient. You can basically anywhere with the MRT. It's easy, on time and convenient.

Since we are traveling for only 3 days in Singapore, we only bought the temporary card that will only lasted 6 trips. You just pay as you travel. You do not need to purchase the EZ card that would cost you SGD12.

One lesson learnt, if you need to have interchange, do not tap put from the station during the transit. We made a silly mistake and need to purchase again. Make sure you use a special link way to the next train.

Always prepare small notes and coins. It's very useful.
The machine is responsive. Thumbs up.

We also stopped to consult the staffs for our trips. Awesome customer service."
,,Best way to get round Singapore,5.0,,The SMRT must be the best of its kind in the world and if you are visiting Singapore it is a must use. The Singapore people are very friendly and helpfull and if they see you looking at a map will normally offer assistance. There are staff in the MRT stations who will help you should you need it but once you have bought your first ticket it is plain sailing. Many of the underground stations are like mini towns and if you choose not to use the MRT you will miss out on a lot. We had purchased a 48 hour hop on hop off bus pass but only used it the first day as the MRT was a better way to get about.
,,Uniquely Singapore,4.0,,"Only in Singapore could the metro be rated as the number two attraction. The ruling party stakes its legitimacy on the excellence of Singapore's infrastructure. In order to win elections, they must continue to provide excellent infrastructure, including metro services.

The MRT is indeed clean and efficient, but there are some faults. For the ""best metro in the world"" it breaks down surprisingly often (which by London standards is actually not that often). The admonishing signs -- and now even the cute cartoon characters further admonishing you -- are reminders of the soft authoritarianism of Singapore. The trains and stations are often overcrowded (not as bad as Tokyo but sometimes close). And the network doesn't take you everywhere you want to go. The population of Singapore has grown faster than the metro lines could keep up. This is why there is so much frantic MRT construction now. For a system so important to the country's government, they could do better."
,,Convenient!!,5.0,,We used SMRT throughout our 4 days in Singapore & it is very easy to use. We purchased a pass from the station & topped up when needed. My 6 year old was free of charge. Very cheap tickets & you can go almost every corner of the map with it.
,,Brilliantly connected network,5.0,,Awesome connectivity personified with simplicity even for a kid. Thank you SMRT for making my trip cost effective and memorable
,,Excellent travel,5.0,,"This was a wonderful way to travel throughout Singapore. Fast, clean and comfortable. We were pleased to use this service"
,,Way to go.,5.0,,It doesn't take long to get the hang of it and then your away.If your not sure there are people to help you and you will find it's the best way to go.
,,"fast, cheap and efficient",5.0,,"Trains/underground/Mass Rapid Transit systems don't come better than this. Fast Efficient cheap and airconditioned. You can even get a wifi signal, and usually a seat. I'm in Love!"
,,"Efficient, polite and cheap!",5.0,,"Loved the journeys in MRT..people are polite and there is no rush to occupy seats..MRT is clean, on time and much cheaper than cabs..Ezylink card works for buses too.. :) Non refundable charge for card is 5 SGD."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"All I had was a map of the whole transit lines, and it was so easy to follow. Also the payment card system is so convenient, accessible and easy to top up. This is the ideal way of getting around Singapore in my opinion."
,,A VERY EFFICIENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM,5.0,,"Each time I visit Singapore I use the MRT and am always impressed by the efficiency of the system. Make sure you have small change for the ticket machines though. Also, if you intend to buy a ticket for travel over a few days, make sure you know where you can purchase as not all stations sell them. Do a little research on how each rail line links to others via the underground network of walkways and tunnels. Also, note that some stations are not actually that far apart so often a 10 minute walk can achieve the same as catching a train from one station to the next - Singapore is not that big in reality. Caution - know when peak hour is and try to avoid travel during these periods - whilst efficient and effective, trains still get very crowded."
,,Clean and convenient,5.0,,I find the SMRT very clean and modern. The stations and walkways are pleasant because it's airconditioned.
,,Great value,5.0,,We had taken a card with minimum loading of $ 10 . Could beat the que. They give refund of the balance
,,Discrepancy on Singapore technology level and the experience of buying a ticket,2.0,,"Although the MRT is a very good transport mean, I was amazed of the journey I took to buy a ticket. I went to the ticket dispenser for the first time. Very intuitive and self explanatory, it did not take minutes to find your route and your ticket price. $2.4. I inserted my credit card but the amount was too small for card. I cancelled and went to an ATM. ATM gave me $50 dollar notes. Went back, found my ticket again and inserted the $50 bill. $50 was too big to get change. I had to go back to the bank and get change. Finally I could buy my ticket. Ride was fine."
,,Good system!,5.0,,"One of the highlight when we traveled in Singapore was the SMRT. It is so efficient, clean and easy to access."
,,Best in the world,5.0,,"The MRT is very clean, safe, fast way around Singapore for all the family. You can purchase a ticket for a few cents to another station or buy a 1, 3. 5 day Singapore tourist pass and travel anywhere in Singapore as many times as you like.
The only way to go."
,,So easy to use.,5.0,,Grab an EZ-card and away you go. So easy to navigate around the city using the SMRT as it services all main sights. Never waiting too long for trains.
,,Best Public Transport,5.0,,The MRT is best public transport in Singapore. You can buy a 3 day tourist pass which costs around 20 S$ for unlimited travel by MRT n bus also. We stayed for 6 days used only this pass to travel. We bought the pass from Changi Airport n return the Same there only. So we dint use taxi anytime. You get the MRT route map at all the stations which guides you perfectly. The MRT is fasted mode to commute. This is the best & cheapest mode of transport.
,,Excellent affordable easy way to get around,5.0,,"I took the train to the city from the Airport and vice versa. It was very affordable compared to a taxi.
Very easy to navigate. Signs and maps are well posted. On the train the diagrams are easy to read and show your location at all times.
There are several announcements on stops etc.
Highly recommend this format of transportation in Singapore."
,,Very efficient. On time and very frequent.,5.0,,Very easy to find your way around. Links to all main areas. It's advisable to get a day pass or three day pass. If you are staying longer you can get a top up card .
,,Rest of the world take a leaf,5.0,,"If ever there was a more efficient rail, bus and taxi system in the world I am yet to find it. Starting at the airport with quick, cheap taxi to the hotel, then train services all over the city and an equally good bus service. Someone really got this one correct. Their transport tickets cover all services and for such unreal prices."
,,"SMRT is an excellent service ,convenient and economic.",5.0,,We used the SMRT which is easy and convenient and is located hardly 200 metres from the Hotel Boss. A few transfers may be necessary but otherwise is quite easy to negotiate.
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore if you want to go from A to B. Average trip is 77c with an MTR card unless you go to the outer suburbs. Don't need to worry if you miss a train as the next one is only 10 minutes away. Follow the colored lines to its platform and the train will be going in either direction so just select the way you need to go. They even show you where to stand to get on or off, very civilized. All subway system should be modeled on this"
,,Efficient and clean,5.0,,"We like taking the subway when we travel. Singapore's MRT is the cleanest we have ever seen. Also underground, you will find shopping malls. You can do a lot of shopping down there without suffering from the heat. All these tunnels and underground malls are air conditioned."
,,Fast way to move around,4.0,,"Fast way to move around town, if you take SMRT, and for last part taxi, you go around singapore, very fast."
,,"Quick, Easy and Efficient way of Travel",4.0,,"MRT in Singapore is quick and easy way of travel.
- Considering the Taxi Fares and TOLL rates MRT is best way to commute in Singapore.
- The train Stations are well marked, Signboards at each station makes it easy for tourists to follow instructions.
- Ticketing is not very difficult and they have plenty options in terms of Cards, Pass and Daily Tickets.
- MRT is usually crowded during peak hours in weekdays and overall during weekends however they are on time and seldom delayed.
- Well Connected to most of Singapore and good service clubbed with Buses right outside the MRT Stations.

Would recommend definitely."
,,Highly Dependable and flawless,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is flawless. Staff is helpful. Once you land in Changi airport you pick up the MRT card for around S$15 for which you get S$ 7 worth of refill to use for MRT travel. (You dont need to return this card but dont miss the smile when the card issuer says -"" you can keep it as a souvenir"" --Yes 8 dollar worth souvenir!!)

What I found about the MRT card is it can be used on vending machines around major locations which dispenses drinks can. You will notice the logo on these cards and in the vending machines which accept those cards.

My experience- I lost my MRT card inside the station or the metro premises itself. Went to the ticket counter and lodged a complaint. Singapore boasts about Zero crime rate and i thought i may get my card by evening.
More than the value on the card, I was hoping to get a call confirming receipt of the card.
Unfortunately I didnt get it!!

The rest of my stay I managed using the paper ticket which can be used or topped up for 3-4 trips.
Overall MRT provides highly dependable service."
,,"Safe, easy and cheap method of transport.",5.0,,"Very clean, safe and easy way to navigate your way around Singapore. Used the MRT to get everywhere and had no problems."
,,Wonderful,5.0,,"Pleasure to use. Very much like to tube in London, only cleaner, spacier, far more comfortable even with the rush hour on it. So cheap to get around. Why use taxis when everything underground was beautifully air conned. As with all of Singapore, very impressed. No louts, no eating and drinking so very good to travel on. People seemed to respect the laws in this country, wish the UK was like this."
,,Best and cheapest way to get around Singapore,5.0,,Taxis are cheap in Singapore but the subway is definitely the best way to get around. For a couple of dollars or less you can easily get around the downtown core using the MRT system. It's also air conditioned which is an added bonus. Note the cash ticket machines only take change or max $5 bill denominations and if you keep and reuse your card their is a small discount when you reload it.
,,Efficient,5.0,,Efficient mean of transport if you in singapore. I think the price is okay. Most tourist attraction are reach by mrt in singapore
,,"Easy to navigate, extremely clean and safe",5.0,,"Visitors can purchase a 1-3 day Tourist Pass - I got a 2 day, which was SGD 26, including SGD 10 deposit. You get that 10 back if returned by end of last day of your pass.

The MRT line map is simple to understand and navigate - I used nearly every line by the end of my 2 days.

No eating or drinking in stations or trains - I brought my water bottle along, and just held off until out of station."
,,Fast. Clean and Efficient,5.0,,One of the best ways to get around Singapore. Fast and on time. It is probably the cleanest in existence.

,,So Easy,4.0,,"Very simple to use transit system. Buy a tourist pass for unlimited use of the trains and buses. Just ask the ticket office and they can help.

,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"We used the MRT to go almost everywhere. It is so convenient and not very expensive. The trains run on time and all the time, there no hanging around waiting for hours to get from A to B. Will recommend this mode of travel to all."
,,Super transport system.,5.0,,This is one of the best transport systems that we have ever used. Very fast trains and very short waiting times. People are friendly and will give up their seat for older or frail people.
,,Affordable and easy to navigate,5.0,,"Ok you're going to say ""of course you're going to praise your own country's train system"" but I have lived overseas for many years - in countries with train systems and in countries whose train systems is still being developed or none at all. When you compare these with the Singapore MRT... the Singapore MRT is truly an easy to navigate and affordable way to get around the city-island. Signages and announcements in English and other languages are helpful if you are a visitor and the station staff are always helpful."
,,"Efficient, Clean, Fast, and Will Be Missed",5.0,,"Having lived in Singapore more than six years now, I will miss their Mass Transit System, MRT, a lot! I am disabled and no matter how crowded the train is in peak times, people offer me a seat either from the ""reserved"" seats which are allocated for the disabled, pregnant, parent with child, or the elderly, or someone,or even more than one, gives up a seat from the regular seating. I wear a neckbrace due to a broken neck after a car crash years ago. My cervical spine is unstable and my neurosurgeon advises wearing a soft collar brace to stabilise it. Six years of riding the Singapore buses and the MRT and I consistently get a seat because the Singapore people are kind, polite, and want to help. I love this country and will miss it tremendously when we move in May. I only have positive experiences. I advise tourists NOT to drink, eat, or bring durians on the MRT. Obey the rules of this beautiful and friendly country. It is clean for a reason! Most people obey the law.
Backpackers need to lower their bag so they do not bump others or hit their faces when they turn around. Give up your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, kids, and the disabled. Be a good tourist and respect Singapore laws."
,,Best way to move around Singapore,5.0,,"It's fast, efficient and clean !! The most convenient mode of travel. For people visiting for a few days, I'd recommend you pick up a ezylink Tourist Pass at the airport tself. It gives you unlimited usage of MRT, LRT and Buses."
,,Fast and Clean,5.0,,"A fast, clean way to get around Singapore. The stations are an attraction in themselves if you are into architecture. Well done and an easy way to get to where you want to go. Buy the subway pass (three day pass) at the airport when you arrive."
,,So efficient and excellent value,5.0,,We were so impressed by the efficiency of this transport system and the value for money was unbelievable. Everything was spotlessly clean and the trains ran perfectly on time. A really good way to get around the city.

Just do not consume food while traveling"

You have to purchase at a ticket office, ( trouble is the ticket offices are not standardised & you need to find out which stations office is open & when, which can be an inconvenience when you have limited time in Singapore), best to do your research, cost us 30sd & a very cheap & efficient way of seeing all the sights except the Zoo.

The train employees are very helpful."

- A S$10 deposit fee is required for the card.
- The card has to be returned at one of a limited number of stations before close on the expiration day of your card to get your deposit back (pay attention- each station has different operating hours to get your refund).
- Day 1 ends at the close of the first purchase day (if you buy at 5pm, day 1 is only a couple of hours)
- In doesn't include express trains or special tours (standard bus and trains only)

The actual train service was clean and seemed to be running on time."
,,Almost as good as Japan,5.0,,"After living in Japan, you expect quality rail service. The MRT rivals the Tokyo Metro. Travelling on a Sunday only cost 77 cents for a few stations. The system does shut early though, around 11:30 for some stations.
The trains are clean and efficient. The signs and announcements are in a few languages, making it assessable by most. The only negative to this highly efficient system, is the lack of seating. I also had a laugh at the signs stating that durian fruit were not able to be transported on the system!"
,,"Easy to use, clean - a treat.",5.0,,"The rapid transit in very easy to use. You can use the same card and simply add fares are you need to. The systems goes to any location you want to visit. It is remarkably clean (as is all of Singapore), the people are very polite and helpful."

,,Cheap and extensive,5.0,,"We used the service to travel widely on both bus and trains and only spent a few dollars. it is safe, clean and has wide coverage"
,,Very clean and efficient,5.0,,"I was very impressed with Singapore's train system. It is easy to navigate, and very clean and safe feeling. I really liked that at each stop, there was a map showing the locality and you where you would come out with each exit. There was also guidance on which exit you should use for destinations near the stop.

The trains were clean and tidy, and there were seats set aside for older travelers, children, pregnant ladies and people with disabilities. Although people will sit on these seats when they are not needed, people stood up straight away when someone with a priority came along.

We took the trains to and from the airport which was cheap and easy, with our luggage not causing a problem, however, this was during the day in both directions, not at peak traffic times."
,,Cheap and fast and probably the easiest way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,Bought a pass... 4 lines connect the whole city and is a much better means of travelling when compared to taxi and other options... platforms are neat and clean... highly recommend as a way around in the city specially for tourists...

,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT),5.0,,"No suc thing when I was here in the 70;s , it is a marvel easy o ticket,,, and goes everywhrer needed. Spotles as you woud expect"
,,Works a treat,5.0,,"Best train system I have experienced. Efficient, inexpensive and clean. Many other countries could take a leaf out of Singapores books on this one."
,,Easy and Cheap,5.0,,"The MRT allows you to travel just about anywhere in Singapore quickly and Cheaply . We purchased a Tourist Pass which give you 3 days , unlimited travel on the MRT ,Buses and also Light Rail - Cost is $20 SG with a $10 SG deposit on the Smart Card . Trains run every few minutes regardless of where you are going , we never had to wait more than 4 minutes . They are fast , Super Clean and the Singaporeans always give up a seat for Seniors , they are Wonderful ."
,,Great!,5.0,,"One of the best underground systems I have used. Easy to navigate, clean, safe, efficient. Nothing negative to say, brilliant!"
,,useful but few ticket machines,3.0,,"Singapore MRT service is useful and covers quite well the city centre. The problem, especially during busy hours, is that there are too few ticket machines, which quite often run out of coins so don't give back the change, and is not possible to buy tickets at the desk."
,,Hard to fault,5.0,,"We were in Singapore for three days and used the system several times. It is so cheap it almost qualifies as free. Being Singapore, the whole system was, unsurprisingly, spotlessly clean and graffiti free. The doors on the platform align perfectly with those on the carriages, thus eliminating any possibility of falling on the tracks. All the announcements and signage are in English and the maps use the familiar London Underground format so you will have no difficulty navigating the city. The ticket machines are multilingual so all you need is a supply of small change and no fear of enclosed spaces."
,,clean and efficient,5.0,,really easy to use - buy a card that you can easily top up - and it is really cheap. not worth using other forms of transport really ....
,,Great experience,5.0,,Very clean and efficient. Easy to understand and the staff at information are very helpful. No need for taxis if you like to explore the city.
,,Simply the best,5.0,,"A lot of people will not use an 'underground' system due to the many problems that major cities have. They are dirty overcrowded, slow, extremely busy, hot and sticky regardless of the weather outside.
Now use the Singapore MRT. It is unbelievable. It's spacious, it's amazingly clean, it's really really easy to get around. It's unbelievably cheap and you can travel for miles for nothing. The only down side is for the chaps. It doesn't seem to matter which station you leave you are faced with the most amazing shopping malls where Prada, Gucci, ... seem to have so many stores. Look for the first exit"
,,The only way to Travel in Singapore,5.0,,"You cannot say you have been to Singapore unless you have commuted on the SMRT. The ticketing is simple, the fares are cheap and on a hot day, why walk when you can jump on the underground train system and get to your destination easily. Stations are easy to find because of great signage in the streets above. The ticketing machines, of which there are plenty before you enter the station, are easy to use. They take notes, coins and cards. Instructions are shown on the ""touch screen"" and easy to follow. There are also SMRT staff available if you have any problems. using SMRT ...is SMaRT !"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"We decided against the tourist pass since we were there for a week. Bought a card and put $17 each on it,luckily its good for 7 years as even using the MRT heaps we dint even spend half that amount,great system works a treat and colour coded too!"
,,The Biggest Convenience,5.0,,"Only one word sums it all ... Convenient !!
Starting from taking the SMRT Card from the airport station to the location maps , platform markings, lifts for those with luggage or prams , markings on the floor for the blind, bus stations to get u to ur final destination just outside MRT stations, they really did think out everything and I mean EVERYTHING!! Its cheap too.
And if u are just gazing at the route map at the station for a bit, u will find the security coming to you to help you out, just awesome !!"

,,Travel conveniently and safely,5.0,,"The MRT system is awesome. Easy to use, clean, timely and comfortable. Singaporeans are so polite! No pushing or bumping into people. Just remember not to eat or drink on The MRT. Not even from your water bottle."
,,The way to go!,5.0,,Used it to get from Chinatown to Gardens by the Bay and it was just great. So clean and quick! We purchased cards that you can add trips to and that was useful.
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Not complicated and easy to use maps and line to get to different part of the city. Although a bit of walking sometimes for connecting to different lines. There is always a lift for wheelchairs and strollers or ppl with lugguage.cheap way to get around the city without traffic.
,,Great cheap way to get around,5.0,,"This is by far the cleanest and most efficient safe underground I have been on. Easy card purchase allows for fast entry and exiting of the underground lines, its impressive."
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,"The MRT is always reliable, spotlessly clean, great value and comfortable. We bought an EZ card for $12. It's $5 for the card and $7 credit. We thought this was the best value for our 5nt stay. You get cheaper rates with the EZ card. Also when we visit Singapore again, we could use the cards. When finding out what travel card to buy, the man at the ticket desk was so helpful and friendly."
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"As far as public transportation goes, Singapore knows what they're doing. The MRT system has strict rules about eating and drinking in the MRT which makes for clean trains and stations. The map system is fairly simple to use and each upcoming station is announced in several languages, including English (it is the National language). The MRT system has stations near all major attractions in Singapore!"
,,TRAIN'ed,5.0,,Seems like this is the best planned metro train. The connection and the service plus the locations to access well planned
,,Very efficient!,5.0,,"A wonderful system and remarkably inexpensive. Plenty of staff were available to explain the ticketing system and you need to have some small denomination notes to use the automatic ticket machines. It is almost certainly quicker than trying to use the taxis to get around Singapore, very clean and, from what we experienced, it seems there are clean toilets at each station."
,,Using public transport after a long time,4.0,,"Fully worth it, clean, fast. It took us a while to purchase the tickets but once you know the machine it will be easy on the next ride."
,,Soooo easy,5.0,,"We always use the MRT as it is cheap, clean, fast and so very efficient. Average cost for a local return trip was $Sd 3.30 each."
,,AWESOME WAY TO TRAVEL AROUND SINGAPORE,5.0,,"As a tourist in Singapore we bought a 3 day travel card for $30 Australian and never looked back. The trains are always on time, arrive anywhere from 3 to 5 minute intervals anywhere we went and we did some long day travels on many lines, displays of where lines go are easy to follow and there are signs everywhere just incase you get lost, At the end of your 3 days you return the card at the station where you purchased it from and they give you $10 back, happy days, fantastic rail system"
,,Best way to get around,4.0,,"Buy a card to ease transfers and save time. Good for most journeys, but might be best avoided during rush hour."
,,Quick and easy way to get around,5.0,,"Singapore has an excellent metro system called the MRT. Best to book a hotel close to a station as most places of interest can easily be reached by public transport. If the MRT doesn't get you there, a connecting bus will probably do the rest. Buy an EZlink card from any station (there's one at the airport). This gives good savings on the regular inexpensive fares. The card is valid for seven years, so keep for a return visit or cash in when you leave. You can even use the card for small purchases in convenience stores."
,,This is not an attraction - it's effectively the tube!,3.0,,"This is how you get around Singapore - it's good, it's efficient and relatively easy to use but is not an attraction - oh and is also airconned which is very welcome

Most people will use this when they visit Singapore - also takes you most of the way to the zoo and meets a bus. Make sure your hotel is close to a station"
,,Easy to take from Airport,5.0,,Make sure you have $5 note and easy to take from airport. Only takes a few minutes to figure out from map and directions. Easy to get to most attractions and trains come by very frequently!
,,Extremely clean and efficient,5.0,,"Excellent experience, everything is clean and the electronic screen in the train certainly helps to figure out where you are. The price was also very reasonable. A good way to travel particularly during hot and humid days in Singapore"
,,"Cheap, clean and on time!",5.0,,A great and cost effective way of getting round Singapore if you don't want to walk everywhere. We purchased the 3 day pass which removed all the stress from purchasing tickets each journey. Trains were very clean and spacious and we always managed to get a seat at various times of the day. The MRT is a very impressive piece of engineering and a great way to get around Singapore. Highly recommended.
,,Commute in SG,4.0,,How I wish commute in the Philippines is this convenient. And wifi! And zero security guards who pretend to check your bags.
,,Commuting in Singapore,5.0,,"Very Easy. Very Smooth. Punctual or very good frequency. Well connected. Well sign posted all the routes and all the related information.
We were afraid how we shall buy ticket from the machines there was no big line but they were busy. If we took 5 mins others behind us will be upset thinking this I was afraid but there was assistance on hand and ticketing purchase was simple.
I liked their policy of recycling so you could use the old ticket and charge it as u went. Very innovative yet simple to do.
Highly recommended even as a variety in travel plus economy!!"
,,Take the time to enjoy Singapore... ride the SMRT,5.0,,"When we have the time, and slow-down to enjoy Singapore, the SMRT is the local, cost-efficient way to travel.

Buy the travellers pass, available as 1, 2, 3 or 4 day passes."
,,It is the engineered embroiderey of Singapore,5.0,,MRT can save you lot of money during your Singapore stay and I truly mean that out of my own personal experience.

,,Best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Singapore's subway train and bus network is an easy way to get around the island. Almost everywhere is easily accessible, including a direct train to/from Changi Airport. Buy a MRT card and top-up at automated machines in every station. Tap card on entry & exit in buses and train stations. Fares are deducted based on distance & time of day (for peak hour rates).

,,"Suppper Quick, On time , very comfortable, (easy with Family)",5.0,,"During my 6 days visit to Singapore I opted to travel with MRT only... Its really very easy and comfortable with such a wide network of connectivity to all the places in Singapore.

I had taken EZ link cards (which is around 5 SDG in March 2017) and can be refilled with minmum of 10 SDG any time a various locations. this card is valid for 5 years an valid for SMRT buses also.

What ever extra amount you hold in card after completing your Singapore trip can be refunded back to you at changi airport MRT counter.

For 6 days I spent around 45 SDG (2 People) in total for exploring full Singapore.

There is an option of tourist card also available with an validity of 2 - 7 days with unlimited rides. However I opted Ez link card as i find that more convenient.

In total .. SMRT is an wonderful network and facility available at very reasonable price for exploring a city like Singapore,"

When we visited Singapore the new Blue line was open and this great to visit areas. Very happy with the Singapore MRT."
,,Understanding the MRT system better for a more enjoyable ride.......,5.0,,"Much has been said of how good this MRT is .

But also of some ""common"" problems - which can be easily overcome with a clearer understanding of this system.

1. Long queues at ticket machines due insuffucient machines. The fact that most tourists takes time to understand how to use it further prolonged the wait.

To solve this problem, buy a stored value card called EZ Link (see photo) just like the locals do. It costs $12 - with $7 fare value & $5 non- refundable for card. This card can be used for 5 years - just top up with minimum of $10 each time. Keep card for next trip or as souvenir or give it to a friend coming here.

This card gives you discounted fares for every trip, compared to single tickets fares. Can be used for buses too & the monorail to Sentosa. Likely one will recover this $5 in short time.

With this card, no hassle or long wait at machines for every trip. It is simple to use- just tap. And one can check balance amount at ticket machine or when tapping in/out.
Get this card from any ticket counters in all city stations & major ones outside city. Believe airport counters sells this too.

2. No Lifts for elderly, strollers & physically disadvantaged. Note EVERY station has a lift. Of course it is harder to locate the lifts in the very big stations eg Dhoby Ghaut . Just look for the overhead direction signs or ask a locals or staff at any station passenger service counters.

3. No toilets. Toilets are found only outside the platform floors & within the station. One need to use it before tapping in.
For some stations that are located within big malls, there are no toilets as these malls has alot of toilets in the malls eg Orchard, Bugis stations.

4. Maximum dollar notes for ticketing machines use. I have seen many tourists puzzled when their $10 notes keeps getting rejected at ticket machines.
For single ticket fares, maximum notes that can be used is either $2 or $5. For topping up of EZ link cards, one can use either $10 or $50 notes.

5. Finding directions. From my regular observations, many tourists seems 'lost' looking for the correct directions or platforms within the stations. The directional signs are all at the top ( ceiling level), which many don't look up. Thereby got lost.

6. MRT map. Pocket size maps are avaiable free at all passenger service counters in every station. Get one for easy planning & reference"
,,Easy way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"We like to walk when we visit a new city. It is the best way to see things. Singapore is so big that you need to use transportation to get from one place to another. The MRT(Mass Rapid Transit )is the answer. It goes everywhere.
It is very clean and very safe. The stations are huge but easy to maneuver. Routes are well marked and the subway maps are pretty easy to follow. We bought a 3 day pass which allowed us to hop on and off the trains and the buses any time. The pass costs $20(Singapore) plus a $10 deposit. At the end of the 3 days you can turn the pass in and get the $10 (Singapore) back. Many of the stations also have shopping centers associated with them. They also have elevators and escalators. They are very user friendly. It is an amazing experience."

,,AMAZING,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and very cost effective - nothing further needs to be said except the local youth really do give up their seats without prompting!"
,,A bit confusing but very efficient,4.0,,Sometimes going in one direction is on one floor while when you want to go in the opposite direction you have to go to another floor ( in most subway systems the opposite direction can be attained on the opposite track) but once you've made a few silly errors and work out how the system works it is very practical..

,,The Metro,5.0,,We came across this mode of transport ar the far end of the Botanical gardens. We were impressed as to how cheap it was. We went onto the Shopping Centre which was very upmarket Armani Gucci and Marks & Spencer. We could not get over how clean the Metro Station was also the train
,,Safe and excellent service!,5.0,,"Wow!!! The best transport system. We never felt unsafe, the other commuters were so polite and courteous. Did not see any ""trouble"" on the train. Attendants at the train station were very helpful. THANK YOU SINGAPORE! I wish our system was as good."

,,One of the best transport systems in the world.,5.0,,Singapore is known for having one of the best transport systems in the world. One of best and cheapest ways of getting around is the SMRT. Clean and efficient.
,,Top notch transport!,5.0,,"The rail system in Singapore is great! It's simple to use and understand their map, the trains are regular and well planned with stations under key locations in the city. If you need assistance or change the staff behind the counter are happy to help, but we managed just fine figuring it out ourselves. Their paper tickets are also reusable which I think is great- they even offer a discount for re-use!"
,,Easy! Easy!,5.0,,"Low cost,, fast and so easy to use the MRT is an easy way to get around Singapore. Though crowded there is ample room."
,,Happy daze on the Mass Transit Singapore,5.0,,"Excellent metro system. It's part of an excellent transport system. Other cities should take note. Get a S$10.00 tourist transit day pass (24hrs) for use on the MTR, LTR, bus and ferry services. It's excellent value. If you're arriving/departing Singapore on a cruise ship you can take the metro from/to Marina South Pier or Harbourfront stations. If you're catching a flight the metro goes to the airport. Not all of the metro is underground, so take the North-South Line out into the ""wilds"" of northern Singapore. The carriages are very clean and there's no graffiti. If you don't like the station escalators or you have a disability there's always a lift; you just have to look for them at the interchange stations."
,,Why can't our transport system be like this!,5.0,,"The only way to get around Singapore is by the MRT! It is clean, safe and never has you waiting more than 2 minutes. Used the MRT for all our 6 day trip to Singapore and it couldn't be easier!

Makes me wonder why cities don't copy the way they operate as it clearly is the way to go!"
,,"Fast efficient trains, Long line for tickets.",4.0,,"The trains were quick an efficient , but we had a long wait in line for the 2 ticket machines at Marina Bay sands around 10 pm"
,,"Clean, Fast, Efficient and Cheap Transport System",5.0,,The SMRT is a very efficient transport system. Easy to sue. Always on time. Clean and cheap. Greta way to see Singapore.
,,Trip saviour,5.0,,"Buy / borrow EZ card for your travel. (5$ rental - non refundable + 7$ card value)
There is one more tourist pass with 3 or 4 day validity, which offers unlimited travel.
Personal experience, EZ card is the best.
Since the Metro network of Singapore is very well connected.
With shortage of time also we did not have to think twice for hiring a cab or travel via MRt to airport for outbound journey.
Outside each station we can find a bus stop.
Each train can be boarded within 5 minutes of waiting time.
Top up kiosks are available at every station.
Refund your balance at the airport by submitting your acrd on the last day."
,,Complete map on mrt connectivity by sector clearly in different colors.Highly useful for expats,5.0,,Very convenient mode to travel with less strain and also cost effective and quick to reach destinations.Gives a clarity to commuters as to where they are as the move.Without losing your energy can reach work locations afreash.
,,Best way to go around Singapore,5.0,,"If you want to explore Singapore, the best way would be to use the SMRT. It's fast, convenient and budget friendly. Also, if you happen to still have some load before you leave Singapore, you can use them as payment in 7eleven and cold storage outlets"
,,"Modern, air conditioned and clean",4.0,,Bayfront MRT exit to the Gardens is too far for people with limited mobility. No seats or benches to pause at. Otherwise really excellent.
,,Efficient service,5.0,,"I can just say: congrats, well done job. Efficient service, efficient employees, all runs as expected"
,,"Very good, efficient system",5.0,,"Great way to get around Singapore. There are several different lines, which link up quite often so that longer journeys can be made.

Not too expensive, with automatic ticket booths - great once you realise that you have to look carefully at the display - i.e. for the tickets we wanted the machine would not accept larger than a 5 Singapore Dollar note - we didn't spot that and tried to use a 10 SD note but the local people are very helpful and soon sorted us out.

It was, as one expects in Singapore, it is all very clean and well maintained. There are plenty of route maps around and it is easy to find your way. Announcements are made before each stop and route crossover points are also made obvious.

Wish we had a system like that at home."
,,Clean fast and safe,5.0,,We used the MRT to get around Singapore we were amazed how fast clean and safe it was and so easy to use.
,,Frequent and Efficient,5.0,,"I usually use the MRT when I get around because there are stations in most of the places I want to go and bus stops in the. The trains run frequently throughout the day; I rarely wait more than 5 minutes, but 2 or 3 minutes is a more common waiting time. The trains are clean, well lit and comfortable. The only thing I don't like is people coughing without covering their mouths, which is pretty common, but not really the fault of the MRT. Maybe they could do a poster like ""Stand Up Stacey"", but call it ""Cover Cough Kevin."""
,,MRT trains are fantastic,5.0,,"Best way to travel in Singapore. The MRT is always on time, it is also cheap and you can buy day, or 2 day or 3 day passes which are of great value and you can travel anytime and all day and you also get a refund at the end."
,,Best & cleanest Metro in the world,5.0,,"When in Singapore, take the Metro. It is very easy to use, clean, orderly and pleasant. You should get a pass you can top up this can be used on buses as well. The MRT connects to Changi Airport as well."
,,Possibly the best in the world.,4.0,,"Clean, cheap, efficient and above-all safe. You can go all over the island on the MRT. Waiting time is never more than a few minutes. The trains and stations are air conditioned and ultra clean. Save your cash, don't fork out for a sight-seeing bus, use the MRT. Most stations are well located or a very short walk from the major attractions."
,,Great underground,5.0,,"Singapores MRT is so easy to use, great underground service with driverless trains!

There is great signage to direct you where you need to go, with not only details of the final destination but key places along the route.

As the underground areas are such vast spaces also gives you great maps on exit to tell you what your best exit is!

Operates an easy swipe in and swipe out service like most undergrounds!"
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"Took train from the airport to city, easy connections between trains. Your ticket can be reused so you do get your 10 cent deposit back after 3 trips"
,,Fantastic subway system,5.0,,"This is our third visit to Singapore in a year. We got an MTR card last year and keep topping it off. It is good for busses also, but don't forget to swipe your card when you get on AND when you get off the bus. Otherwise you will be charged extra.

Yesterday we took the MRT from the airport to our hotel in Chinatown. So easy, and very cheap. We had 2 pieces of luggage. A few weeks ago we took a taxi from the airport to our hotel. It costs much more and took longer. If you travel with lots of luggage, take a taxi. But if you don't, the MRT is great.

It is also wonderful for getting around the city. It is crowded but very clean and locals are great about helping you get around."
,,Good and cheap way to get around,5.0,,Love the MRT here. It's very cheap and easy to use. The companion app makes it easy to get from place to place. Buy a standard travel card for $5 and top it up as you need it. When you leave you can give the card back and they will return any credit left. Only place I like that you can't really get straight to is the Zoo.
,,Great way to move around the city,5.0,,Very inexpensive clean way to travel around town. The map was easy to use. It was air conditioned and clean.
,,Fantastic Transport,5.0,,"SMRT has to be the best way to get around Singapore, must be the envy of the rest of the world. Fantastic service, easy to use and quick, no waiting just go, never experienced such a great transport system anywhere.
Clean and efficient with thousands of people using the system...so courtess, never a cross word. The clincher is the cheapness of travel...fantastic!"
,,"Clean, tidy and very efficient",4.0,,"Anytime we travel on the MRT we are always amazed at how clean, tidy and efficient it is. We got on at Dover which is a huge station and got off at Clark Quay. Most enjoyable ride apart from having to stand all the way due to the volume of people using it."
,,The best public transport system,5.0,,Excellent service and connectivity. Always on time and dependable. It is easy to navigate and the prices are cheap.
,,Generally easy to use,4.0,,"Trains are regular and very clean. They are also very safe. All the stations we used had good signage although one of the major interchanges, Dhobi Ghaat, which is four levels high, got me confused. There was a very helpful gentleman in an Information Booth who pointed us to the correct platform. Ticket purchases are via vending machines which take cash and cards. Instructions for use are in multiple languages. Just press the button for the language you need."
,,Smooth efficient,5.0,,easiest way to get around Singapore. Helpful staff easy to find at every station. Get an Ez link card from 7-11 and tap in and out
,,Convenient and cheap commuting means in Singapore,5.0,,"I take the Downtown line to and fro office, daily.
After travelling to many countries, I remain impressed with the efficiency, safety and affordability of the mass rapid transit system for our country.
Albeit in recent years, Singapore's MRT is no longer completely reliable due to wear and tear of the older lines, it is nevertheless still very efficient and fast.
One does not have to grapple with heavy peak hour traffic jams, but can take the MRT in relative air-con comfort.
The price points of our train fares to both locals and visitors, are also extremely affordable.
During peak periods, the 2 min to 4 min frequency of trains is very useful.
The station staff are also helpful and friendly.
I once left my bag of Iceland souvenirs for my colleagues on the train in the morning, and could retrieve it back, by lunch time."
,,No one would take us to the airport!,2.0,,We found the service fantastic from the airport into town but the minute we needed to catch a taxi from in town back to the airport 5 of these taxis (all of which had vacancies) refused to take us out there! I also asked 2 of your men if they could call me a taxi (as we had no phones) that would be free to take us out and they said no. We had an 8 hour stop over and needed to be back promptly! 1.5hours later all I can say is I was really disappointed at the end.
,,Efrective train system,5.0,,Very effective. Quick trains that will get you to about 90% of areas in singapore. Get an ez link pass for a seamless and hassle free use of the trains
,,Way to travel !,5.0,,Very efficient and clean Staff really helpful Value for money not at all expensive .easy to find your way around
,,Simple and convenient,5.0,,Good subway transportation system. Very clean and efficient system that takes you to the main points in the city

You find your destination. The trains and platforms, Work together. With sliding doors on both to improve. Station Safety. Well done Singapore"
,,Very clean!,5.0,,All metro tunels were realy clean. Also toilets were clean. Ticket prices were good something like 1 SGD per person for ride.
,,so easy to navigate,5.0,,"This system could teach London underground a thing or two. The ticket machines are exceptionally easy to use. Just find your destination, how many passengers ,return or single and pay. Simple."
,,"MRT is cheap, clean, safe, and well organised",5.0,,MRT is a great option. Very cheap. Taxis are cheap for multiple people but MRT for solo travellers quick and cheap
,,Best way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"This is the best way to travel in Singapore because most of the tourist attractions are near the MRT also since most of the stations are close or under a mall there is easy access to the shopping malls especially when it is raining.
It is very easy to buy tickets and if you find it difficult there will be an official from the MRT Company to help and from our personal experience if you just a local they definitely will help you.
During the rush hour which is about ( 8 to 9 in the morning / 5 – 6 in the evening) it can get very crowded. We used the MRT for all our traveling during our stay.

It is safe but you need to be aware of your surrounding when traveling."
,,The best MRT in the world,5.0,,This is the best MRT i have seen so far in entire world. On time. Completely accessible. Best way to move in Singapore. and cheap as compared to other way of transport.
,,Excellent!,5.0,,Super clean. Easy to use. Trains run often. Only a few minutes wait. Air conditioned. Buy the unlimited tourist pass for great value for money.
,,The best in the world,5.0,,"Super clean, super efficient, super safe, professional and friendly staff, friendly travellers. Normally I'm not a great fan of public transportation. In Singapore you don't need a car. The MRT is better than owning a car. Try it!"
,,Convenient,5.0,,One of the best public transport system in the world. Very easy to use. Convenient and very ideal. Cheap. Fast and frequent services. Will get you almost everywhere you want to go and further with the of the bus network. Super clean. Many stations are at ideal locations for tourist and locals. Some of the tunnels passages leading to the station or out are beautiful.
,,"Fast, efficient, brilliant - and cheap",5.0,,"The SMRT is the one thing above the many attractions that we visited that impressed me most. It was brilliant! Fast, very clean, not crowded, easy to follow and got us to all the attractions we wanted to see. Would recommend the visitors pass which costs just $20 for three days travel ( can also be used on busses)
No eating or drinking allowed, or transportation of durians (a smelly fruit) makes the whole system absolutely spotless.
I have not seen any other transport system come anywhere close to Singapore's brilliant system."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"This transit system is great and very cost effective. We paid for an ezlink card. $12 minimum to start (we added $5 and this lasted us 4 days)
Most stations are easy to navigate with correct signage. Just wear comfy shoes, as many of the trains don't actually have much, if any seating at all."
,,Fast and convenient,5.0,,We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and we have not used the bus a single time during our trip because MRT gets us everywhere!
,,"Fast, efficient mass transport at last!",5.0,,"The SMRT is the best underground train experience we have ever had.
It is very well arranged and getting on and off the train is very orderly. During peak hours more trains are added, so you don't wait more than a few minutes before getting on your way.
A very interesting and remarkable point is that actually there is a wall that separates the travelers in the waiting room from the train instead of a yellow line like in most other places. When the train pulls into the station, two doors open, one in the wall and one in the train. Therefore the danger of someone falling in front of the train is completely eliminated.
Inside the train there is an electronic board that shows where you are and what the next station is. That is apart from the PA system that announces the information in several languages, including English.
The train is very fast and yo ucan get from one location to another in a matter of minutes
It is a very interesting experience and definitely shows how good public transportation can be"
,,Unreliable Public Transport,1.0,,Frequent breakdown make it unreliable public transport in Singapore. Train operator only seem to care about profit making than serving public with reliable transport system.
,,"Very Efficient, very clean",5.0,,It would take some time for the first time users to understand the maps and directions. i have seen a lot of tourists (including me)cluelessly walking around with the maps. once you get used to the colours and directions(one or two trips should do) its a breeze.
,,Always There For Me,4.0,,"The train service, now, connects me to almost all parts of the island. Clean, cool, fuss-free, my travel experiences have all been smooth sailing."
,,"Cheap, fast, clean",5.0,,"I like their system of keeping the way out free. Very secure, nobody can jump on the rails because the doors open only after the train stopped. Keep your ticket and recharge it."
,,Fast and reliable,5.0,,"It is very crowded on rush hour. But SMRT is one of the Gem of Singapore. On time, clean, and not so pricey."
,,Super clean and very user friendly,5.0,,"No eating and drinking allowed - therefore a super clean MRT system. Very user friendly, fast and efficient.
Great cheap way to explore Singapore and all it has to offer.

,,Fast & Cheap,5.0,,If you want to surround Singapore just go with MRT. it really cheap and fast. The train is clean and never late.
,,Great,5.0,,Easy to travel with Singapore MRT. Easy to understand and cheap to ride. Great for budget travellers.
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,This is a very convenient and cost effective way to navigate the city. It is very clearly signed to help you find your way and accessible for all ages.
,,Easy Fast Reliable,5.0,,Easy Fast Reliable. but stations can be humid and hot. (Welcome to Singapore) Cheaper than Uber and train comes more often than Sydney so.. that was cool! Seats are hard as rock though..
,,Efficient & Convenient,5.0,,"Hop onto any MRT station you see around the island. Locate the map of the 'Grand Scheme Of Things' (ie: a big map of where all the MRT stations are located) then plan your route. It's easy and convenient and, best of all, a huge money saver! It's simple to follow -- just follow the different coloured routes to the destination of your choice.

You can jump from line to line all within covered or underground walkways (cool and convenient). Usually, they will pop up at malls or nearby attractions.

The Orchard Station pops up at Wisma Atria and Ion Orchard, with Tangs and Shaw Centre located nearby. The Dhoby Ghaut Station puts you at Plaza Singapura and nearby Capitol Theatre while the Somerset Station opens up smack in the middle of Orchard Road (just opposite Centrepoint and next to 313 Somerset). The Bugis station opens up to Bugis and Bugis Village.

The more adventurous may want to consider stations further afield eg: the Lakeside and Jurong Stations. Alternatively, head for the heartlands of Singapore with Bedok, Simei, Tampines and Pasir Ris Stations. The one at Tampines opens up in the middle of three different malls.

To the museums, try the Bras Basah Station (National Museum of Singapore and Peranakan Museum), while the nearby Cityhall Station will take you to CHIJMES (converted convent school now an F&B area), Cathay and St Andrews Cathedral.

There's loads more of these stations around. Try it instead of using a taxi, you'll find it so much more convenient, and saves you so much time, and, money!"
,,Must use,5.0,,Amazingly fast and easy to use. The best way to get around the city. Climb the stairs of each metro stop and enter a new part of the city with different architecture.
,,Great Trains,5.0,,Best train system i have been on. Neat orderly and priced very reasonable. Most attractions with in a short distance from the stations
,,Little bit rusty now,4.0,,Very promising on time public transportation in Singapore. You must very in good shape using SMRT because there are some transit station that need a very long walk to connect with other train line.
,,Rapid and safest mode of transport,5.0,,It is one of the best and fastest and cheapest mode of transport in singapore. You have very good connectivity to all major attractions. You can get either Ez link card or tourist pass and commute in mrts and also buses.
,,One of the easiest most efficient modes of transport ever,5.0,,"Whenever we have visitors they can't believe how well functioning, fast and easy the Singapore MRT system is working for them. Apart from the rush hours the trains are usually not as full as in other Asian cities and they are on time and running every five minutes usually so that there is hardly any wait. The system is being expanded constantly so that it gets easier and easier to get almost everywhere on the little red dot. The cashless system works easy and there's plenty of machines to top up your card everywhere that take cash or card. Easy!"
,,Go almost anywhere in Singapore.,5.0,,"Very clean, very inexpensive. You can get within a half hour or less walking time to almost anyplace in Singapore."
,,Best way to get around the city,5.0,,"When you want to get around the city, the most efficient way is via MRT. As a tourist, buying a 1, 2 or 3 day Tourist MRT pass is the way to go. After your last day, you can top-off your card and pay by the ride or you can get a new tourist pass.

The advantage of a tourist pass is you do not have to worry about the cost of going from one location to another or the time of day (they charge different rates based on the time of day). The tourist pass is inclusive of all MRT subways and buses.

After you use the card you can return it at any major station or the airport station for your 10 deposit-refund.

Trains are on-time, clean and no eating/drinking allowed."
,,One of the best things about Singapore is SMRT,5.0,,"I loved travelling around in Singapore because it was so easy. It is easy to travel to any part of Singapore using the SMRT. Purchase an EZ link card and you are good to to go. A lot of attractions in Singapore are right next to SMRT stations.

Another tip: You can use the EZ link card on buses too."
,,Take the train,5.0,,"It can be a bit intimidating at first, but once you buy the ticket (and they sell in 4 languages), you're on your way. You can get almost anywhere, except the zoo and night safari."
,,One of the Best in the World,5.0,,"I'v travelled on the tubes in London, the metro in Dubai and the Subways in Ny. The MRT in Singapore is by far the best and cleanest. I think Singapore being so small really helps because as a traveler you'll find almost everything close by to one the stations."
,,Take a look London!!,5.0,,"Clean, efficient and cheap. What more is there to say except the MRT puts London Underground to shame."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,Used the MRT every day we were in Singapore. So easy to get around and very efficient. Trains very clean and felt very safe.
,,Brilliant Public Transport,5.0,,"The MRT is very reliable and efficient, and I use it almost daily and so far have not found anything wrong with it. Maybe more system maps could be added in stations and clearer directions between platforms will be helpful"
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Very cheap to travel, and simple to navigate. The only downside is that there should be more ticket machines available, as with only three at most stations queues are inevitable. (However we did notice that employees were available to offer assistance)"
,,A Big Wow for MRT,5.0,,"I recommended you to use SMRT for commuting around all area of Singapore. Very clean, precise schedule and top of the most important is very cheap.
To all of you who will travel around Singapore, first step that you have to prepare to use SMRT, is to buy Ez-Link card (can do Top-Up if necessary) or Tourist Pass card (Cannot be Top-Up). You can easily purchase either of those cards in 7-Eleven convenience store or just go to Station office at MRT station you can find.
If you will stay more than 3 nights in Singapore, I recommend you to use Ez-Link card (S$15 - S$ for card cost and S$7 as stored value). Then you can easily add more value at MRT station of convenience stores.
We could travelling around with SMRT even when we have a large luggage at non-peak hours and it was very children friendly environment. And Singapore people were very polite to give their sits if we are bring kids, brings a lot of luggage.
Me, my wife and kids, gave 2 thumbs for SMRT...!!"
,,Excellent,5.0,,Excellent transport system at a reasonable cost and easy to use. Very clean and well organised subway system.
,,"So easy, so clean, so cheap",5.0,,"Bought an EZ link card and just hopped on and off MRT & buses over 4 days. Found getting around by MRT very simple, once on the train you always knew which stop was next and which side the doors were opening. The MRT stations are very clean and air conditioned as are the trains."
,,Good way to move around S'pore,4.0,,"After living in Singapore for a while and I have visited the city many times, I have come to realise that taking the SMRT is a reliable way of moving around in Singapore. During the Rush hour, it is cheaper and sometimes faster to take the train than taking a car."
,,"Quick, cheap, safe and clean",5.0,,Definately the way to get around. Looks confusing but maps about the station make for easy travel. Ticket machines easy to understand.
,,Great and easy to use,5.0,,"First time we have used Singapore MRT and bought tickets at the machine to travel from Bugis to Downtown to go to the Satay Hawkers Market. So easy to understand and the trains were clean, regular and a pleasure to travel in. A pity our system in Melbourne couldn't be more like it."
,,"Great Service, Excellent trains",5.0,,"We loved travelling on the SMRT in Singapore, always quick, always available and clean. We were a little surprised to find some of the trains are driverless."
,,Singapore MRT - Mass Rapid Train Service,4.0,,"MRT Train system in Singapore is getting more convenient and we have 5 train lines in operation to date together with about 154 stations in total. Singapore is a small city so taking train to your destiny is very affordable and fast. You probably spend barely an hour to complete one line. Clean and Air-conditioned train will make your trip pleasant and enjoyable. However please note that you are not allowed to consume any food and drink on the train. If you are staying in the hotels near town, you can even take a train from Changi International Airport to the town during peak hour."
,,Efficient and intuitive,5.0,,"I don't believe I've ever written (or felt the need to write) a review of a transit system. This system is indeed review-worthy.
Fares are cheap. Signs for direction are clear and abundant. The trains and stations are clean; service everywhere is prompt. The maps are easy to read, and the whole system is a model to efficiency."
,,A train system that works!,5.0,,"What can I say? The MRT goes all over the city, it runs on time, it's clean, it's cheap.... everything a public transit system should be. The transit works on trains and buses - no hassles with cash."
,,MRT is a bit disorganised and expensive,2.0,,"I have lived in Paris and London and have used their metro/tube extensively. I heard that Singapore has a great system and was let down. The signs are poor. Staff are quite unfriendly or struggle to communicate. There was a whole bunch of staff standing around Bugis but were more to help Chinese speaking people and either had to ask for help from their supervisor or struggled to speak in English (their official language). Now a tourist pass sounds like a good deal but in reality it's available only from a few large stations and is quite expensive for what it can do.
If you are travelling alone or as a couple its better off to buy an EZlink card and forfeit the 5 dollar charge than the tourist pass which gives you unfettered travel but as you probably will be spending more time at specific attractions rather that hop about by train all day. With EZlink you can top up when it's low from most stations or newspaper shops. What works better though if you are three or more is to use a taxi especially if the journey is less than 15 minutes away. It's much cheaper and more convenient than the MRT and get you to locations you want without having to walk a lot.
What irritated me is that the staff don't bother to help you buy the most relevant or cheapest fare. They just want to offload a sale and get on with life. I feel that's sad and generally makes Singapore a less friendly and more of a place to go for business rather than a holiday in a region that's bursting with tourism. MRT is ok for local folk for tourists. Use it as last resort which probably means never."
,,Tourist pass,5.0,,"When visiting Singapore buy a tourist pass, a 3 day pass allows unlimited public transport, we only used the MRT which is very efficient and clean and trains are regular 3- 4 mins in between trains they do stop at 23.59 though"
,,Best transport system,5.0,,"Singapore mrt system is one of the best transport system. It's very easy and convenient. We stayed 6 days in singapore and we have used mrt mostly.
There are two easiest and chepest ways
1. Buy day pass and travel unlimited times. Its cheaper for tourists. U can get 1,2,or 3 day travel pass. Three day pass is just sg$20
2. We bought ez link cards and once u returned back u can refund the balance. So this is also cheaper for less travelling purposes.
The mrt station and inside of mrt is too clean. Remember You can't eat or drink in the station and inside mrt.
The routes are always showed in the route map and voice recording is also there to announce the destination. The sign boards are placed everywhere so u can easily find the stations and routes. The arrival time is accurate. We really got a new experience of mrt"
,,What can I say so clean and tubes arriving on time,5.0,,Fantastic transport system so clean and runs so smoothly We spent a lot of time on the tubes as they get you every where you do need a card not at all expencive you get them at the office on all station
,,Transportation everywhere,5.0,,"Best Public Transportation System in the world. Fast, clean, safe, goes everywhere. The Metro and the Buses are great."
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,Bought ticket at station was able to add money when needed. So easy to use. Clean efficient only way to travel around this island
,,Easy and cheap,5.0,,Less than 1 sgd you can travel anywhere. And its always available but many stairs can make you a litle tired. Easy to access
,,EFFICIENT AND CHEAP WAY TO GET AROUND,4.0,,"The singapore mrt network is getting wider. Other than the attractions at the city outskirt, you can reach most of them quite easily on mrt. A couple of tips on taking the train. If you intend to use the train (and public buses) a lot, it is advisable to buy the store value card ($5 each non refundable) as it is cheaper (and more convenience) to use the store value card than paying cash. You can keep the card for your next trip to the country. The other advice is when taking the train from Changi Airport, please remember to change train at Tenah Merah station (if not, you will find yourself taking the train back to the airport). At Tenah Merah stn, the train doors on both sides will open. If you are going to the city, which i presume most tourists are, exit from the doors on the left side of the train. If not sure, always look at the glass doors on the platform. It will telll you that the train is going toward the city."
,,Good value and effficient.,5.0,,We bought the 2 day pass and used it to visit a variety of places of interest. Enjoyed the spectacle of the locals glued to their phones. Some difficulty in using stations without lifts with luggage.
,,Best transpo - SG MRT,5.0,,"The best transpo that I have experienced so far. One of the best things I love about SMRT is that it is connected to the Airport (Changi Airport) Moreover, it is connected to other lines, passengers do not need to tap-out and tap-in again just to go to another line. If you are a first timer, maybe you'll have a hard time if your destination requires a lot of transfers. But there are staffs who can help & passengers are approachable. They also have an App (SG MRT) that can help you reach your destination. It provides a faster route & a route that has less transfers."
,,Safe and lean ride,5.0,,"If U are visiting Singapore, using the MRT is the best way of transportation. Start from Changui airport and move around the city in a safe, clean, and always on time train. Plus the fares cannot be better. An experience U won't regret"
,,Ezi travelling,5.0,,"The MRT gives you access to many of the tourist locations and is so easy to use, just remember which entrance you came in if you are returning, this can make a big difference in getting home as a wrong exit can take you out to a totally different street.
We use the EZI link card purchased from the 7-11 stores scattered around the island. We usually put an extra $5 onto it. Any unused credit can be used at several locations to buy a drink etc. so the credit isn't wasted.
The MRT is so clean, fast and cheap. The only thing missing is the smiles, everyone looks so serious.
The MRT is no drama during peak hour as they are so frequent and can handle a large volume of passengers and everyone is so polite, no pushing or shoving."
,,great and cheap way to travel in singapore,4.0,,"don't do the tourist card of hop-on/off thing, an EZlink card and you go everywhere you want. The maps are a little bit cryptical in the beginning as there is no overlay to the citymap, but you get use to it. with whereigo website on your phone, you use all public transports like a local for less than a dollar per way!"
,,Best way to explore Singapore,5.0,,"Its cheaper than taxis and with the new Downtown line built, you can go anywhere in Singapore in 30 minutes or less. Every town is connected so travel is easy."
,,The best metro in the world,5.0,,I love using the SMRT in Singapore - it's so clean and efficient and a good place to see different people come and leave.
,,Always a first choice,5.0,,"The one of the fascinating thing to do in Singapore is taking the MRT. Why? I don't know. It's just for me if you go to Singapore you have to use this. Yeah, you have to walk a bit but that was the fun thing. Singapore is a friendly place for people who likes to walk. So don't miss it."
,,Moving around in Singapore,4.0,,"Public transport is very easy to take in Singapore. Connectivity is so good you will surely find one or two Metro lines or buses going in your directions. if you are staying for a long time taxi could be a bit expensive all the time.
You can find the means of transport and the bus no. or metro you need to take for your route by visiting their web page. And if you have a metro near you go and get their metro pocket map book to help guide you.
Do keep in mind it would take you longer to reach your destination compared to the taxi and you would have to do a bit of walking when changing metro lines or waiting buses.
Timing to avoid when traveling are the rush hrs morning 6am to 9am and evening 5pm - 8.30pm."
,,So easy to use,5.0,,"If I can use this, anyone can. It's idiot proof. Also very clean and efficient. Fellow travellers also very polite and considerate, London Underground could learn a lot from the Singapore system,"
,,SMRT in singapore,5.0,,"Singapore has a very good undergroung transport that is the smrt , very efficient , clean , on time and inexpensive compare to other countries like Japan, London etc...... The signs for directions are comprehensive and clear( if not just ask for assisstance at the office which is open , not sure of the closing time) but well over office hour."
,,Frequent Travller,5.0,,Excellent transport system in Singapore. It is one of fastest and cleanest system in the world in my estimation but of course it is only for within Singapore Island Country. Get an MRT card at the station and u can use the same card for travel on the buses too.
,,Excellent for everyday visit,5.0,,I use SMRT regularly. This is my favourite medium of transport in Singapore. Wheelchair accessible. People of all ages can travel easily.
,,Convenience at its best,5.0,,"Worried that its your first time in Singapore???
Don't be!
The MRT system of Singapore is so easy to understand and/navigate that even a first timer would have to difficulty finding his way around soon!
Just get one of those FREE user friendly maps that you could find at the arrival hall at the airport and you're good to go!
MRT are clean, on time, safe and a very convenient way to travel around Singapore...
I could only hope they would devise a way to give tourists some discount or something with the EZlink cards...
But all in all GREAT"
,,Quick and Easy.,4.0,,"Cheap , Easy and well organised. Always someone that can assist. If staying a few days get the Tourist 3 day pass that also included entry into Chinatown Museum and a drink at a canal front bar ."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"We had a great experience using the MRT. We bought a 3 day tourist card and used it each day. The trains are very clean, air conditioned and safe."
,,"Efficient,neat and economical",5.0,,"Right from entering the metro station everything is neat, clean, prompt and efficient. A wonderful way to get to the places one wishes to visit.True value for money. Comparable to the best in the world"
,,Great way to move around,4.0,,It is the best way to move around. It is clean and cheap and fast. Weekends and before and office hours can be quite crazy!
,,Way o Life,5.0,,"SMRT is a part of daily life,makes travel convenient and affordable.touches the lives of everyday SIngaporeans,functional and effective,also useful for visitors.Just get a ticket and travel."
,,Clean & convenient,4.0,,"Very visitor friendly, expansive, and clean. Compared to metros I've seen in Japan, Korea and New York though it spends a long time in stations so not as fast as systems in other countries but makes up for that with convenient locations and always expanding."
,,everywhere in the world should have this,5.0,,"What a cheap fantastic way to see all the sites in Singapore. We got a 3day tourist pass which gave us unlimited usage. The system is easy to understand once you get a map, the routes are colour coded and show where to change to go to different lines. a bit of a walk sometimes to change lines but once you get the hang of it you can go all over Singapore in a short period of time. It is fully automated and safe, some (maybe all) trains are driverless."
,,Zip-Lining your way through...,5.0,,"Taking the subway in Singapore is a real breeze. The air-con comfort of the underground stations, the carriage cars makes for a comfortable ride (in otherwise humid Singapore). Color-coded Lines makes it visually easier to negotiate the travel, as well when changing trains. The ticket machines are easy to handle...and the service staff on hand very helpful, in the event you're stuck whilst doing a transaction; or for that matter need destination guidance. Admittedly, there's been 'negative press' of train stoppages and delays in recent years, but put that into perspective : the subway is now 25 years old. So...whether you're a local or a tourist, using the SMRT for getting around is akin to zip-lining your way through Singapore; getting to the end point safely & securely, whilst seeing things enroute."
,,MRT,5.0,,"Great transport system, easily accessible and well Organised. There is officer to assist in answering your queries."
,,Convinience but not as comprehensive as HK n Japan,4.0,,"This is one of the youngest interm of age, MRT in asia. Is clean, convinient, and effecient. Give it a few more years, where new lines are coming up. Then it will be even more better. For now, it is indeed the cheapest n fastest way around singapore. Give it a try, u will love it!"
,,Good complement in transportation,4.0,,"To Travel in Singapore it's easy... You just aroute map where you want to go, always take note of the information centre. They are very willing to tell you, how to go to your destination..."
,,"Efficient, Safe, and Elementary",5.0,,"I have no qualms about getting around SG alone. If using a temporary paper ticket which you can purchase at the ticket dispensers, all that needs to be done is to select your destination and follow the signs all over the terminals. Feel free to ask for directions. If for some reason you miss your stop, simply get off and take the opposite train back without extra cost, and proceed accordingly.

Some reminders though: 1.stay to the left side of escalators to allow others to pass. If you're in a bit of a hurry you'll appreciate the practice. 2.reusable plastic train tickets are charged lower fares than the 30-day paper tickets. 3.you can ask for maps at the service booths.

Give me a like! :)
Cheers"
,,getting on one need connection now,5.0,,"SMRT is coming to the hotel soon, but getting to use the SMRT now need to take link bus or taxi to the nearest one to paya lebar or Kallang wave. very cheap to travel and can link to the whole island."

,,Just love it!,5.0,,"We were in a hotel not near any of the attractions yet getting to them with the MRT was easy. We bought a visitors pass which requires a S$10 refundable deposit and then a cost of S $8 to S $10 per day depending on if you purchase for 1, 2 or 3 days. You can't top up the pass so if you want to extend your travel you will need to buy a new pass.

It is easy to change between the north/south , East/West and circle lines and we got to Raffles, Marina Bay, Sentosa, China Town and the river quite easily.

Never waited more than 8 mins for a train with most coming every 4 mins.

Trains are so clean and I love the messaging to remind people to do the right thing. There is also orderly queueing on the station. We usually didn't get a seat but thats ok as it is usually a quick trip.

Heads up, no eating or drinking is permitted on the train.

The only thing I didn't like was some poor sign posting to get you out of the multi level shopping centers attached to each station and we got very frustrated in the ION one on Orchard road, taking ages to find our way out to the opposite side of the road."
,,Excellent Connectivity. Best Mode of Transport,5.0,,"Singapore MRT has best Connectivity.

,,Amazing!!,5.0,,"The MRT is the best way to get around Singapore. It is the most clean transport I've ever been on.

The longest I had to wait for a train was 4 minutes, which is pretty damn good.

Tip - when you arrive go to the Customer Services and ask for a pre-loaded card. They are 14SGD and come with 9SGD pre-loaded. Each trip for me cost around 1 dollar and I only topped up with an extra 10, which lasted me the whole week I was there and I used it multiple times a day."
,,The Best in the World,5.0,,After Travelling in Metros in some of the worlds major cities I have to agree that Singapore Metro System is the best. The way the handle the crowd and any breakdown if ever is just superb.

They wished this kind of transportation existed in our country (on going tho!). But since my dad was old enough to walk from one line to other line, he felt very troublesome... nonetheless, some young men were very nice to give him seat. Thank you!"
,,Still shows the way to run a mass rapid transit system.,5.0,,"Take the London Tube and it will be hot, airless, crowded and smelly.

,,Very Convenient and Fast-paced,5.0,,"The SMRT is very convenient, fast, and easily accessible. It even has a connection to the changi airport which makes the life of tourists much easier. I also liked the fact that you can go on every part of singapore just by the use of their train system. Their SMRT is surely to be envious of."
,,Fantastic transport system,5.0,,The system works so well and is so speedy. You never have to wait more than 5 minutes and you can get to many places so quickly and there are many stations not too far apart to walk in the city. It's very easy to understand the system and all in English. We only stayed 2 1/2 days otherwise would have bought an easylink card (like our Opal card). It is also extremely cheap.
,,Make sure you don't miss the last train,4.0,,The system works easy and everything is in English. The only downside is that the last trains ride around 0:15 am. This means you can't stay in the city center till late at night without needing to get a taxi.

,,Take a few mins to get to know the map,5.0,,"It's great trains got every 2-3 mins very easy to use. You get a ticket for the machine and top it up. It's cool on the trains, if you go by bus it take much longer as you sit in traffic.

,,Easy and cheap!,5.0,,Really easy to use and extremely well priced! I used it every day whilst on holiday here. Lots of stops near all the best places to visit.

It's as clean as Disney World and is almost an attraction in itself. The only way to get around Singapore. Straight to/from the airport as well!"
,,A Little Confusing,4.0,,"I couldn't quite rate this excellent, as it can get a little confusing, as I found out the hard way. The Lavender Station was only 300m from the Hotel Boss where we were staying while in Singapore for 3 days. Once my husband and I arrived at the station, we headed for the ticket machines to check out which line and platform we needed. The lines are all colour coded for what area you are heading to, which is quite helpful. I feel they need a few more machines than what they have as there is always someone waiting to purchase their ticket due to visitors to the country who are trying to understand what has to be done, choose your destination and then check which way the paper money goes in the slot then making sure you have enough coins to make up the small change. We had a very friendly and helpful assistant approach us while we were purchasing our tickets, and when we told her where we were going and that we intended getting off at China Town before heading onto the Gardens by the Bay, she told us we should not have purchased a return ticket. It did not matter that much, it was just that when we caught the train again we had to check our tickets at the machine before getting on the train again as we needed to top up the payment. Don't do what I did though, I was not watching where my husband was going and I went through the wrong turn styles, had to come out again and go through the correct ones. Since I had made that mistake, I then had to top up my ticket to get to the right platform and it cost me an extra $1.60 SD. Once we were finally on the train, we had no problems (unless there were no seats), as the stops were announced for when you needed to get off. It is a rather fast and cheap way to get around the city.
The assistant also informed us that if you have any money left on your ticket at the end of the day, you can cash it in and get the change that is left. But, remember, you must only buy a return ticket if you are going to one destination, looking around then heading back to your starting point on the same day, otherwise, you must purchase single travel tickets for each stop you will be getting off at to sight see before heading onward or returning to whence you started."

,,ONE OF THE WORLD'S BEST SUBWAY SYSTEMS,5.0,,"J/ x been to Singapore many times and used the underground system often. I't easy to find your way around. The cars are modern. Best of all, they have barriers the prevent you from being pushed onto the tracks by crowds"

,,World leader in public transport,5.0,,"Suitable for people in wheelchairs and prams. I've travelled the world and for price and efficiency the MRT is among the worlds elite. A must for transversing around the island including to the airport/city, city/airport.

,,A Rapid Transit System to be Admired,5.0,,"Riding the mass rapid system ( or subway) in Singapore is a must for every visitor, but especially if you come from a city in the United States that can learn something from the Singporeans. Sorry to say, that is just about every city in the USA, starting with New York City, whose subways and commuter trains I ride regularly. So let me list a few of the attributes of the SMRT. It starts with the stations themselves, which are spotless; equipped with a state of the art subway card and fare machine system; have to the second arrival and departure boards strategically located; escalators, elevators, and, best of all, brilliant air conditioning-in the stations and on the cars. We've been coming to Singapore three years in a row, and it seems each time there's a new line either being built or opening. The trains are roomy, dependable, go to most of the key places, and yes, you can take take them both from the airport and the passenger ship terminal to the center of the city. Having said that, bus and taxi service is so reliable that you do not need a car if you live here. What more can I say?"

,,Heart of Getting Around Singapore by Subway,4.0,,"Though the train map may look complicated. Always remember, Dhoby Ghaut station is the 'heart' of the whole network, I would term it as connection point. From there you can easily go to Harbour Front (Sentosa);Chinatown; Orchard Road (City Shopping); Promenade (Suntec City); Changi Airport; and many other places of interest you may want to go.

Especially with growing population and increasing construction in North this region has to be well connected with Office areas & Airport"

The card can be topped up but only with a minimum of $10, however if you have any credit left of your card, you can cash it in for example at the airport when you leave Sinapore. Journeys are cheap and each time you scan your card at the end of a journey, it displays how much credit is left. It's really easy to get around using SMRT and we never had any issues. I wish local transport back home was so cheap and efficient!"
,,This is amazing,5.0,,"Easy, accessible and attractive, This is the only subway I know of that has orchids in the flower beds inside the subway. Easy to negotiate and incredible clean-almost clinically so, this transit is unbelievable, follow the rules or you will pay!!"
,,5 stars for the trains and 3 for ticketing,4.0,,"The MRT trains, stations and infrastructure were first rate. Everything was super clean (as expected in Singapore), the locations were very convenient and the whole thing ran on time. We found the stations were well signposted too making it really easy to find the right entrance for the attraction/street you were there to visit.

What was not cool were the ticketing machines. Really long lines for only 2 or 3 machines at busy stations, station staff (and locals for that matter) that were unhelpful (with the very rare exception) and no details about what tickets suit tourists. The fact that the tickets only last 6 refills before needing to be purchased again and the fact I had to travel to a station I had no need to go to to buy a daily pass (that was too expensive anyway) was pretty ordinary. Compared to places like Japan, Singapore needs to pick up its game."
,,Unbelievable,5.0,,"My son and I stayed in Singapore for a week ,bought NETS cards and used the MRT train and buses every day . A fantastic and cheap way to get about . the longest we waited anywhere was , I reckon 4 minutes .
Driverless trains seemed a bit weird though. Train runs right to and from Changi International also"
,,Every city should have this transit system,5.0,,Very easy to navigate. Idiot proof system with great signage and helpful attendants. Would love to find out how to replicate this system in Miami. Would make life a lot easier and alleviate traffic tremendously.
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,Best way to get around - we had a tourist ticket. The trains are air conditioned and very smart and tidy. Well recommended.
,,Moved Rapidly!,4.0,,"It would be an ideal option for travellers who would like to travel Singapore on a budget & could move fast!
Several MRT stations are under maintenance but it is not mentioned in road indicators. As a result I had to walk back from the front of that MRT station.
All the stations are well maintained & instructions were loud & clear. Hope everyone should use it for fast travelling.
One can collect a MRT card by spending 12 SG dollar where usage limits are upto 7 SG dollar. Refill options are available in every MRT booth."
,,Easy to Use,4.0,,"what an in-expensive mode of transportion - the trains were very clean. Staff were very friendly and were available for questions, which was very helpful ."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Caught MRT to timpanes then caught bus 29 to Changi museum. So easy and orderly to use. Super cheap public transport. Get yr card from a 7-11 visitors card $10 but preloaded w $5 already. Can easy load more $ at mrt. Card can be used on train and buses.
,,Fantastic,5.0,,one of best transport systems in the world. Very comfortable and allows to go almost anywhere around the city
,,Very clean and very efficient,5.0,,"This is the best way to travel around Singapore. Very affordable, fast and clean. Also cheapest way to travel to and from the airport."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"Wonderfull transportation, clean, cool and almost ontime. Hope in Indonesia have MRT like Singapore.."
,,In a word : Awesome,5.0,,"Easy, efficient, fast, clean, value are just some words to describe the MRT. If you intend using it a lot get the tourist pass for $10 (plus $10 deposit) allowing unlimited usage for 24 hours. Return the card and get your deposit back (within opening hours of ticket kiosks and within 5 days)."
,,Mind the Gap II,5.0,,"If you like the London Underground Singapore's will please as well. If not into impressions needing limos or taxis the MRT is extensive, efficient, full of life and spotless. No prior knowledge of route use is needed, just your stop, as complete route maps (even with exploded views) are the first thing that pops up when purchasing a ticket.

That said, there is one critically important action needed for ticket purchase. In Singapore you spend either credit cards or Singaporean dollars (SGD) only, unlike many other countries in Southeast Asia. The big deal is that in the airport the MRT will currently accept only SGD, no credit cards. So you must exchange your currency for SGD before leaving the arrival hall or expect returning to the arrival hall later; a half hour roundtrip or more. In the city Visa at least was accepted in MRT facilities.

Having ridden every mass transit system in every city we have visited with one, this equals any anywhere and exceeds nearly all."
,,Very easy to get around,5.0,,"We found the MRT system very easy to get around Singapore, and it was better than expected. All stations were very clean, and most were very nicely decorated. Better system than We have seen in Canada and Europe."
,,New year in Singapore,5.0,,"The MRT system is clean, efficient and comfortable. Very convenient, and easy to read maps. It took us all over Singapore with no difficulty. The signs are clear, and all lines are easily connected."
,,Great public transport system,5.0,,Bought 3 day tourist card for 30 sgd - 10 of that is deposit on the card so about £12 for 3 days travel on mrt and busses.
,,Trip to airport,5.0,,Travelled with my one year old grandson in a stroller to the airport and I must admit that it is very convenient and easy.
,,Served its purpose,3.0,,We used the MRT a couple of times but always had to wait in long lines for tickets as there was only 1-2 machines available at each stop. There also did not seem to be an option to buy a day pass so we had to buy tickets each time we rode. The network seemed sufficient to get to the local attractions.
,,Amazing,5.0,,"Very easy to use, but the tunnels are like warrens, shops eaterys vety cheap to use probably the best way to get around, unfortunately you miss out on the attraction above ground."
,,Super efficient,5.0,,Travelled a few times. Very user friendly. gets very crowded during peak hours. seems safe even late in the night
,,"Air-con and 4g, even underground!",5.0,,"Clean, frequent, fast, air-conditioned and cheap as chips. What's not to like? I was very impressed."
,,Cheap and easy,5.0,,"The best way to go around in Singapore, even MRT itself is a bit of attraction for the kids. They get very excited experiencing the MRT.
We chose ez link card previously, probably should opt the Nets because we've seen it can be used in the supermarket also"
,,Efiicient and pain free,5.0,,"Very well laid out stations (with lifts for wheelchairs and buggies). This is a super efficient system which gets you from A to B quickly, including from the airport to most parts of Singapore. Buy an ordinary tavel card for S$5 and load with an initial 7 dollars from the ticket office at the airport.You have to change from the airport branch line but you merely walk to the other side of the platform. Couldn't be easier You can also use cards n the buses but remember to register yourself leaving the bus as well as getting on."
,,a cheap way to travel in Singapore,3.0,,"mrt is a subway transport in singapore. if you wanna save on cost during yr holiday, mrt is the way to go. it is very simple to understand to go from one place to another .The frequency is around 5-7 minutes. however for u to change different line ,it is quite complicated from let say changi airport to town,u need to change 2 mrt ,one from Tanah Merah and one more at City Hall. it is always packed in the morning till 10 am i guess and evening from 1600 to 2100 ."
,,Use it - no need to take a taxi unless you have luggage,5.0,,"I recommend this system to all - it's brilliant. Easy to use, clean and air conditioned. In particular, I commend it to anyone from Transport for London, who will love to see what the tube could be."
,,Chinatown visit.,5.0,,Used this system to get to Chinatown both easy and cheap option. Very efficient clean safe method of transport took me to heart of area. Station staff friendly and supportive making for very pleasant and enjoy experience. Recommend buying multi use ticket for best cost value especially if on a budget.
,,Fast and Easy transport,5.0,,"If you want a fast way to get around take the MRT all over the city and further out. Buy the ticket on most stations. Tickets can be topped up with funds if needed as the card is yours, choose the line you need to be on, easy to work out the direction. They are all colour coded. Swipe on and off, no hassles. During the off peak it is fairly easy get around less crowds etc and able to get a seat. Avoid the peak hours if you can."
,,Use MRT,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT runs smoothly, is clean and safe and quite affordable. Frequently operated airconditioned trains to most places . A great way to travel within Singapore"
,,Getting around Singapore,5.0,,"DO NOT FEAR using the Singapore SMRT it is the easiest, most civilised, clean, convenient way to get around. Make sure you purchase a tourist pass and Singapore is yours to explore. I cannot speak highly enough of this transport System. Go forth and MRT. 5 stars Singapore well done."
,,Efficient and reliable,4.0,,Best way to get around in Singapore is to take the MRT. Not so much sightseeing but you can to the destination quickly. Public toilets are easily available at the Mrts stations and are normally clean.
,,"Very, very clean!",3.0,,"Wow, I have never seen such a clean Metro system, no litter, definitely no chewing gum ( it isn't allowed in Singapore) and relatively uncrowded. However it is small and doesn't always get you to where you want to get to quickly because the connections are not that good especially when you are used to the London Underground. To be honest Singapore is so small we found it is often just as fast to walk and given the number of air conditioned malls the walk is quite pleasant. Walking from near Raffles to Gardens by the Bay took about 35 mins 25 mins were in malls!"
,,Clean efficient mode of travel.,5.0,,"We bought a 5 day card at the MRT station $12 each, $5 non refundable, you can top it up at any station we put an additional $10 on and travelled all over the Island and it can also be used on the bus. All the transport was clean and efficient."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,"Extremely easy to use, efficient and spotlessly clean. Takes you to all the main tourist sites and value for money"
,,Top standard,4.0,,"The whole place .trains ,staff is what the rest of the world should strive for .you don't see litter for a start the system is cheap to use and easy to follow routes underground and once you get your ticket you need for the train which stops behind a glass partition that only opens as a door when the train is stopped in line with the opening you cannot fall onto the track once inside the clean large space the seats are only plastic but are ok and the train movement is smooth it is good value for money"
,,Clean,5.0,,The MRT is very clean and made with a lot of things for the travellers. Even for Person with Special needs. everyone can use it. You can buy a card and upload it every time. So in additional your rides are cheaper. We were impressed
,,Very easy for tourists,5.0,,As like just about everything else in Singapore its all in English and easy to understand. Very good value and an excellent way of getting around the areas. You initially purchase a ticket for $5 plus what you want to put onto the card and then top up as required. At the end of your stay they also will refund any money left on the card.
,,only way to get around,5.0,,"Cheap, easy to use, immaculatly clean, frequent. buy a oyster type top up card most trips cost about forty pence. no drinking or eating on trains or buses. lovely air con to keep you cool"
,,clean and punctual,5.0,,"great! Clean, punctual, spacious and smooth ride. Easy to navigate transit system. The stations are also clean."
,,the worlds best,5.0,,"prepare to be amazed as you travel on the SMRT. Marvel at the cleanliness of the trains, the stations, everything. The pricing is very affordable and everything just works. Trains are super frequent and all journeys are fast.

If only it was like this back home."
,,Great,5.0,,It was a great experience using MRT. It's very cheap and easy to go from one place to another. Just need to follow the instructions.
,,Excellent- best in the world,5.0,,"I would say that the underground system in Singapore is probably the best system I have used anywhere in the world.
It is cheap, easy to use, air conditioned, lifts and good access for push chairs/wheel chairs/etc.
Very very clean with no rubbish/trash anywhere and no graffiti like in other cities visited."
,,Very reliable!,5.0,,"The first time I rode on the SMRT, way back in 1999, I was so impressed by it. 18 years later and many stations and lines hence, the system has not changed. I must say that SMRT has really done a wonderful job for mass transit in SIngapore. The trains are clean and modern and on time! This is actually my second most-liked mass transit system, second only to Japan's."
,,Loved Using Public Transport!,5.0,,"We purchased a Singapore Tourist Pass which is like a little credit card you use to swipe in and out of the subways, busses and trains. Really good value. I loved the subway system because it was easy to navigate and find all the major attractions and the cool air conditioning was helpful on the blistering hot day I visited."
,,SMRT Singapore 2/2017,4.0,,easy way of getting around in the city. Price for the tickets are reasonable. Trains are fairly new and tere are no isues regarding orientation where to go. Signs and descriptions are all in english language
,,Excellent urban transportation,5.0,,"A very good system, widely copied in other Asian cities over recent years. the MRT is fast, efficient and inexpensive. If you are there for a few days, it is a good idea to buy a card ($5, not refundable) to store money on to make it easier to get to and from trains through the turnstiles and unnecessary to queue up to navigate the ticket machines each time. [Ticket machines are not difficult, and take notes, credit cards and coins, but there are often queues as the system is very popular.) It is even possible (and in fact I did it) to go from the airport with your luggage on the train to the MRT, although it helps to know that your hotel is near an MRT station. (I chose to do that to avoid a long taxi queue on arrival.). Stations are well signposted internally, there are lots of fast escalators, the trains themselves are spotlessly clean, as are the station floors. It all seems to be very safe, and I have never seen any problems with criminal behaviour over many years of use, although of course care is always needed. There are security officers around. Often the best way to get around Singapore and new lines are being built all the time to improve the system further. Free maps are easily available at the airport and city maps all tend to have the MRT stations on them."
,,Efficient and Clean,5.0,,"If only San Francisco (my home city) could emulate this great transit system. It's so well run, and remarkably clean, the leaders of my city should be embarrassed that they can't duplicate such good work."
,,Clean and easy to use!,5.0,,"We had no issues using MRT during our entire 10 day stay and found their service to be fast and efficient. When buying tickets, just be sure to have small bills / coins for the machines as the max amount given in change is $4 Singapore. The machines we used also did not seem to take credit cards. Everything is in English, so the instructions and routes are easy to follow."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"Efficient, relatively inexpensive. Driverless trains. Do not throw away your single ticket, you can charge it during coming trips."
,,Great Value,5.0,,"For S$26 each, you can buy a 2-day tourist pass which gives you unlimited access to the MRT and all buses. This includes a S$10 deposit which you get back when you return the card. One day and three day passes are also available. The subway is clean and safe, and very easy to navigate."
,,Everyday Commute,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is truly one of the marvels of the City. Takes me from home to work within 10 minutes, except for the rush hour crowds...truly efficient and convenient."
,,great way to get around,5.0,,"in one week, we took more than 50 rides on the MRT. very efficient, great way to get around. made all attractions accessible."
,,Effective transportation,5.0,,"Easy breezy- so simple anyone could figure it out! Airport to town costs less than 2 Singapore $ and takes about 30 minutes. Don't buy a MRT card from counter in Airport building- buy it at the actual MRT station, as it is cheaper."
,,Good coverage,5.0,,Very good coverage around singapore and some of the stations are very close to the tourist attraction.
,,Terrific and easy to use,5.0,,So easy to use! Fast and efficient. Best way to get around. Buying tickets really easy but locals and rail staff very helpfull
,,"Clean, Quick and with Free Wifi",5.0,,"We've been visiting Singapore a few times already and always use the MRT, it's very easy, directions are well indicated, it's clean and they have Free Wi-Fi. The best way to visit Singapore without walking too much! ;)"

,,Easy to navigate and just a short walk to almost anywhere,5.0,,"Bright clean and easy to use, most inexpensive way to get around the city, buy a pass and tap in and out. Helpful staff in the stations and helpful people in the city always ready to assist with directions."
,,Easy and cheap to use,5.0,,"Great system that I'm glad is being extended even more. You use a prepayed card to access the system, so it charges the right fate as you tag on and off."
,,Brilliant way to get around,5.0,,"Really cheap . Buy a visitors pass. Fast, clean and helpful staff. Brilliant way to get around. Totally recommend it."

,,Extremely good,5.0,,"It's fast, it's clean and it works. What else can you ask for really? Easy to buy a ticket and the tickets are relatively cheap especially the tourist pass. Also the stations are well constructed with signs everywhere to tell you where to go. Alot better than what we got here where I live."
,,Amazing transport system,5.0,,"It's pristine, easy to use, well organised, not over-crowded (that we saw anyway) and there are no buskers or street people anywhere."
,,Very comfortable way of moving around the city,5.0,,"The SMRT is a very comfortable way of moving around the city. Fast, cool, cheap and easy. Much better than moving around Singapore by taxi."
,,Fantastic transport service,5.0,,"Simple, efficient and spotlessly clean. We got the day pass and it is definitely worth it as we were visiting Singapore during monsoon season and the SMRT got us from place to place dry!"
,,Mr Elias Reuben,5.0,,I am amazed the system works the beauty when you are at the platform there are people to guide you from their heart not once it happen to me but a couple of times Good Service Elias
,,Cheap way to get around.,5.0,,"I always use the MRT where possible. Cheap and good for the environment and climate. Train every few minutes and good connectivity. Takes a bit more time than taxi, but faster than buses. One of the best metros compared to most European and American cities where the metro transport is old and creaking!"
,,State of the art !,4.0,,MRT Singapore is an efficient & a world class commuter facility . Little difficult to understand the system for new comers but very convenient and a cost effective once one knows how to use it .
,,Great Services,5.0,,"It was one of the best subways for traveling during the peak hours. SMRT was very modern, clean and reasonable price. You can reach everywhere in Singapore by using the SMRT. Definitely recommended!!!"
,,No problems,5.0,,"Trains were on time, not massively crowded only downer was purchasing tickets which you could see long queues"
,,amazing,5.0,,"it works like clocwork so easy to do, get you from a to b very quik.it is very easy to get the ticket, due to every thing is toch schren"
,,efficient and clean,5.0,,"Best public transport system I've used. Clean, fast, works and safe. What more can you ask? Get an MRT card, load it up and off you go."
,,Excellent,5.0,,"I only wish our premier could go and get some tips on how a great transport service works. It is fast on time and everyone is polite, there is no pushing and there is little to no wait time for a train. It is super clean with workers actually working. Sydney could take a leaf out of their wonderful system!"
,,"Fast, reliable, frequent.",5.0,,"Trains average every 4 minutes and are super clean. The ticket machines are really easy to use, and the signs pointing where you need to go make this much easier to navigate then London, also tells you which exits to take when you leave to ensure on the right road. We have been very impressed with this and use it multiple times every day"
,,anywhere with eaze,5.0,,"have been using it now annually since its inception. Every trip seems to see more line and stations added. You pop up more often than not in a big shopping centre. It is clean and fast, with trains every couple of minutes. The new lines have driverless trains but you get used to that. Try not to use it about 10am and 5 pm as it is very crowded."
,,Clean and Affordable,5.0,,The MRT was an easy way to travel around Singapore. The MRT stops everywhere in Singapore. Very clean and more affordable than taxis.
,,"Clean, efficient, good value for money",5.0,,"We purchased a 2-day tourist pass which was perhaps a little more expensive than buying single tickets each time but it allowed us unlimited travel and it was much more convenient than purchasing individual tickets. The system is highly efficient, spotlessly clean, very well organised and easy to understand. At the end of the two days, we handed the pass back in and redeemed our deposit. (N.B. It was not valid for the monorail to Sentosa - we had to pay extra for that.)"
,,Incredible system,5.0,,"This such a great way to travel around .. easy and efficient and cheap.. buy a Rail Pass card for about $15 if you are there for a week or more, and it doesn't expire. This is Integrated Logistics at its best"
,,Love it,5.0,,Best public transportation on earth. Convenient and well maintained. It makes life so much easier. <3
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"Easy to use, frequent trains and spotlessly clean. Not a spot of graffiti or rubbish which is par for the course in Singapore"
,,You could eat off the floor.,5.0,,"One of the best metro systems I had ever seen anywhere in the world. Like everything in Singapore, there's no graffiti, no litter and no disruptive riders. Multiple day tourist cards are not sold at every station AND there is no currency exchange at many stations. Plus, the ticket machines do not take credit cards. So arriving tourists, especially coming from the Cruise Ship Terminal should have some local currency so they can use Singapore cash to purchase a one-way ticket to one of the stations where multi-day tourist cards are sold. Be sure to have a Master Card, as the tourist card window did not accept visa. Save the taxi fare and ride this system, it's fantastic."
,,Superb underground system,5.0,,"Very good way to get around town. Fares are cheap, stations are clean, ticket machines work and trains run on time. As they are driverless they don't suffer strikes (London Underground take note)"
,,Efficient and easy to follow,5.0,,"Taking the trains in Singapore is super convenient and easy to follow.
I purchased a Ezlink card from the train station counter at the Airport for $12SGD, which gives you $7 travelling credit on the card already. I topped up an extra $10 for my entire 3/4 day stay in Singapore and didn't even use it all. My friend said that trips on the ezlink card work out slightly cheaper than the paper single journey tickets you can purchase from the machine. (i assume because the card is re-useable where as the paper tickets are not?)

The maps and train lines are all colour coded and the the announcements on the train advise you of interchange stations so its super easy to follow as long as you know your destination."
,,"Modern, Clean and Efficient",5.0,,The MRT is the best way to get around Singapore and the system is easy to understand although it is sometimes difficult to find a ticketing machine. Cost is very reasonable
,,Efficient and convenient,5.0,,"The SMRT is very easy to use and well connected. We roamed all around Singapore sightseeing, never needed to take a cab. Where there is no SMRT, buses are available just outside the SMRT stations. Extremely good directions make the SMRT easy to navigate."
,,Brilliant,5.0,,"We used the system during our 5 day stay in Singapore and found it a very efficent and easy way to get around. If you missed a train, there was another within minutes of the last one leaving. And cheap"
,,Increidble and cold for a humid and warm city,5.0,,I think that it is very cheap comparing with other cities you can go very fast and cheap I loved Singapore service transport
,,"Fast, cheap and clean",5.0,,"The only way to travel when visiting the length and breadth of Singapore. Once you have understood the map (relatively easy) the MRT is great, trains are every few minutes, always clean, often busy, cheap and efficient. We also found that local Singaporeans often give up their seats for European travellers, which can be embarrassing but indicative of the good manners generally in Singapore."
,,Love the MRT,5.0,,We have mastered the MRT in 1 day. It's so cheap and easy to understand. Clean and safe for us young girls. Lots of cameras and occasional roaming foot police. Everyone seems to respect the property and each other. It's a Singapore thing I'm sure.
,,"Super easy to get around, including the airport.",5.0,,"Very easy to figure out the routes and transfers. Frequent trains makes waiting a bare minimum. Great access to the airport. Standard, single trip fares requires cash."
,,Not the best experience,2.0,,"Coming from a country where Public Transport is really good, this was quite disappointing and a let down especially when travelling with a little child. Only very few sitting and almost always jam packed. not for me especially with a child at rush hour."
,,Excellent service,5.0,,If you staying for more than 3 days and going around please purchase the ezlink card deposit with no refund $5 and then you can charge as much as you like for daily use.They have different fares depending what time of the day pick/off pick hours.Sometimes depending where you go and how many time you transfer you get credit back.Any money at the end of the trip is refundable as long you go to any MRT and tell the person in the booth you want refund.Excellent services and very clean.Recommended
,,Easy to use especially going to Airport,5.0,,"Like most large cities, the MRT in Singapore is connected to the Airport. Although the passengers need to change at Tanah Merah station, it is only 2 stops to the Changi Airport station. The MRT is continuing to expand and by 2020 the circle line connects to more places in Singapore.
In terms of speed and getting to places, the MRT is the best. No traffic lights and also it is mostly sheltered and conencts to the main bus interchanges."
,,Good way to save money,5.0,,We bought a 3day unlimited pass which cost 10$ for the plastic card and 20$ for the actual rides and you get a refund of the 10$ at the end of the 3 days and this gives you access to the MRT and local buses which got us around Singapore quite easily. The passenger services staff were very helpful pointing us in the right direction for the platforms as to where we were heading. The trains come every 4 minutes so you don't have to wait too long if you miss one and the little MRT map is very explicit. There are not many seats but young get up for us oldies even though the train moves quite fast and you may not need to stand for long and this really is only in peak hour. The train are very clean and announcements are made for every stop and notification of changeover from one line to the next. We bought a second 3 days so all up for 6 days of unlimited travel by rail and buses from one end if Singapore to the other it only cost us $40 per person which was definitely cheaper than what it would have cost us for taxis for 6 days and the Closest MRT station and bus stops were only a 2 minute walk from our hotel. The only travel this did not cover was the express train to Sentosa island but again this was only $4.00 each for return and this covered all the stops on the island. So all up it is very easy to get around to all the tourist sights in Singapore at a very low cost and we even travelled on the train at night and felt quite safe.
,,Great transportation,4.0,,"Singapore does have a good infrastructure in transportation. One of it is the MRT. Very packed and crowded on the working hours.

Easily access and easy to read the map. Used to be very clean the first time i came. Maybe around 2005. Now not too clean anymore"
,,best subway system in the world,5.0,,"You will never find a safer, cleaner, more organized transit system on the planet. Singapore is the best place for women travelling alone. I feel safer in Singapore than I do at home."
,,Wonderful transport system,5.0,,"This is a great way to get around Singapore, excellent service, clean, always on time and the friendly locals make the trip interesting."
,,Safe and efficient MRT,5.0,,"As a western family with small kids we found it no trouble using the MRT to get around many of the attractions in SIngapore. You can buy a tourist pass if you will be using it extensively at a visit.

Trains are efficient, clean and safe. Saves on the hassles with Taxis."
,,Best and cheapest way to get around,5.0,,"Best and cheapest way to get around Singapore, anyone who ever uses public transport will find this a absolute breeze, we purchased a 3 day pass for $30.00 then topped up with an additional $20.00 and still had money left when we went home 4 days later so a 3 day pass was of no advantage to us due to expiry as we were ther for a week. Fares are so cheap, cards are easy to use and both buses and trains arrive on time and are so clean."
,,Underground - on time,5.0,,"I had a 3 day pass for the MRT and found it worked very well with the trains. With the buses didn't quite work out with them. The trains and stations were very clean, no litter and easily assessible."
,,The best way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"When you go to Singapore you MUST experience the MRT; modern, efficient, clean and fast. A great way to get around ; also many of the coaches are air conditioned."
,,Fantastic,5.0,,What a great transport system. We used the MRT daily for our entire 9 day stay and it cost less than $15 each. It would have to be one of the cleanest and most affordable systems I have used. Well done Singapore.
,,Good Transportation,4.0,,"even there are so many fine here but you will cure enjoy this transportation. MRT are clean, fast and cheap."
,,World class public transport system,5.0,,"Don't mean to boast but I've been on metros and subway systems from Shanghai to Toronto, Kuala Lumpur to San Francisco and I believe my little Red Dot, Singapore has a great mass transit system!
Clean carriages, yes it's packed at peak hours, but which system isn't? It's really easy to change lines and hop between tourist and business destinations in the CBD. Pls keep up the good work the folks that run the system. A salute to you all."
,,Very Slick,5.0,,"A very slick system that shows up
The British underground! Driverless and guard less computerised trains run fast and efficient service across Singapore. One great part is the way citizens help you with directions and actually get up and give the seat to elderly or infirm - wonderfully clean."
,,Apprehensive underground adventure.,5.0,,Decided to be brave and use the MRT in Singapore. It was easy if you just take yor time reading instructions which are in English. mNot one piece of litter to be seen anywhere and very spacious stations.
,,easy to use,5.0,,"Really easy to get around. colour coded lines. signs in English. trains and buses use same card that you can easily top up. Very clean and seem to run on time and very frequently. Would recommend buying a $ 12 card that gives card plus travel , you can keep it or cash it in at airport when you leave for full refund of balance"
,,Awesome,5.0,,"Comparing to the train stations we have back home. Definitely, SMRT is world class. It is very accessible to tourists and cheap/convenient way to go around the city. Minimum top up amount is SG10 and MRT card is valid for 5 yrs."
,,Easy way around Singapore,4.0,,"The MRT is a safe, user friendly way to get around Singapore island. Clean and efficient the trains arrive every 5-7 minutes and the cost is low. Tickets can be bought at the station and the easy tab in and tab out makes the process quick. All stations have shops, cafes, etc and further away from the city when you the line comes above ground you can find local markets and shops."
,,Easy way to get around,5.0,,For a relatively small city (compared to Bangkok) this Metro System is extensive and so easy to use. It's very fast too. Compared to Bangkok that is.
,,Loved travelling in the Metro,5.0,,SMRT of Singapore is very well connected to the major tourist location. It is cheap and convenient way of travelling in Singapore.
,,Easy way to travel across the city,5.0,,"Take a tourist pass by showing your passport and you are good to go. You can take 3 day or 5 day day pass which is really useful. SMRT is clean, fast and a very convenient way to explore Singapore."
,,SMRT : Once I understood the procedure this was a fabulous way to get about in Singapore,5.0,,"The SMRT system was confusing until it was explained to us, then found it in-expensive, very simple to use, quick and comfortable.

WE chose to get a pass with a Sg$12 credit which lasted all weekend and we have Sg$4 credit for our next trip.

Tap on the entrance style to get in, tap on the exit to leave.

Many intersecting underground rail lines, hop on and off (maps everywhere) and trains every few minutes.

I do wish other cities were like this, it was that good to use."
,,tourist-friendly,5.0,,"Singapore MRT system is awesome! So convenient to explore SG thru mrt because color coding is so easy to remember. You'll not be afraid to get lost even if your little one is with you. Gentle reminders like ""Doors are closing"" and ""Please mind the gap"" are music to my ears :) If you're vising for a couple of days, it is recommended to buy MRT card asap (and make sure you have enough load to avoid the hassle of reloading) so you can start using it the moment you unpack your things :)"
,,Fantastic and never late,5.0,,"I'm from Melbourne and this system makes ours look so bad. I was here for a week and used the SMRT multiple times a day, there was never a late train, never a cancelled train and I never had to walk more than 10 minutes to get anywhere once I got off. It was amazing. And the train to the airport is so handy.
The only thing I found odd was that the tourist pass can only be used for 3 days at a time... we had to top ours up halfway through our trip which was a bit annoying as they're only available at certain stations. Other than that, it was perfect."
,,Just Wow,5.0,,"Efficient, punctual, just like clock work... The wait time is not more than 5mins.. Its probably the quickest and most cost effective way of commuting in Singapore. Though it can get overcrowded during peak hours. Be careful to note that you cannot eat/drink while commuting... The fines are ridiculous here.."
,,"Clean and fast, though trips add up",4.0,,"Would be a five stars if prices were a little lower (all those trips add up...). Otherwise, seats and the car are clean and trains arrive frequently and on time."

,,So Easy to Use,5.0,,"We used the SMRT over several days to get around Singapore. Trains come very frequently and there is not a lot of waiting on platforms. The stations are easily accessible and kept clean and tidy.

We used standard tickets and just added trips as required. A cheap and easy transport option"
,,So easy to get around!,5.0,,"We bought a card pass at info counter, $12 which included $7 of travel. Make getting around easier and cheaper than taxis etc. able to get to all major sites including airport."

,,One of the best subways,5.0,,"Very modern, safe, easy to navigate, not expensive. great solution in Singapore. You still have to get there if you are no downtown."
,,Quick & easy,5.0,,"The way this network operates puts AUS trains to shame. Clean, comfortable and easy o understand with colour-coded maps. Frequent ervices even on a Sunday, and very cheap."
,,Model for Mass Transit,5.0,,"While visiting Singapore used the SMRT system to get around. Every efficient, clean and organized. Signs were very easy to read and clear. Bought the unlimited trip day pass card and made good us of the pass."
,,Get the tourist pass!,5.0,,"One of the best values in town. Passes may only be purchased at a ticket office (not every station has a ticket office) using cash or Mastercard (does anyone use this credit card?). You get a $10 refund upon turning in the card, again at a ticket office only, not any station office. There is one at Changi, Terminal 2, says it opens at 8 am but was open when I got there at 7:30 am. 3-day pass is $30, net $20 after refund, we easily doubled the amount spent."
,,WORLD CLASS PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM,5.0,,"The SMRT is a bargain not to be passed up. Buy a Singapore tourist card for 1-3 days. 3 days cost $21US and get $7US refunded if you turn your card in at the end. We bought our tourist cards at the airport and took the train to our hotel. The system is all color coded and signs in English, exquisitely clean and very safe. Tourist cards are also good on the buses. Combine with taxis and you will have fast, inexpensive transportation for your visit. Highly recommend, Hope this helps."
,,"fast, convenient, comfortable",5.0,,"You may reach almost any neighborhood using only SMRT. It's very convenient to take it going from and to the airport as carts are spacious, air conditioned, easy to reach with suitcases, all stops are announced in English, too. Use ticketing machines and don't forget you may return your tickets at the airport and get 1 dollar refund for the card."
,,Very efficient MRT,4.0,,Best mass transport system in Singapore and ofcourse cheaper too than cabs. It is also environment friendly.
,,Comfort and Easy,5.0,,Travelling in MRT is very cheap and easy same like Mumbai and delhi metro.. Cabs too expensive go in MRT most of the stations are close to attraction site so not much walking.

,,Efficient,4.0,,"Air-conditioned, clean and organised transport system. Warm, friendly , courteous and accommodating staffs."
,,best way to move with the city for cheap fare,5.0,,Buy a tourist pass 3 days for 20 sin$. all cost cover and easy to use. Personal is helpful. you have to deposit 10 sin$ for the card that they give you back when you return the card. buy these card only at some stations (aiport have one) and at opening hours only 9-18h00
,,"Fast, affordable, and convenient",5.0,,"The MRT system covers most of the major tourist areas in Singapore. The trains are fully packed if you travel during early morning rush hour towards downtown, but at other times, the frequency of the trains are quite good and you can usually get a seat."
,,Cleanest Trains,5.0,,The trains and buses in Singapore must be among the cleanest in the world. I traveled to and from work each day by bus and train with ease and comfort.
,,The easiest train system!,5.0,,"Our experience was the train system was extremely clean, there is a fine if you litter or even eat or drink in the train station or on the train. This makes for very pleasant travelling. They have only seats on the sides of the carriages, its designed for travellers to stand up. But as your trip is normally very quick then this doesnt pose a problem for most people. There are still seats for the people that want or need to sit down."
,,Birthday trip,5.0,,"This was an excellent way to travel around and see Singapore. The MRT is immaculate with trains arriving every 5 mins or so. Super cheap too, we bought a tourist pass and it was easy to top up and when we were leaving any money we had left on the pass was refunded. Great system."

,,"Fast, comfortable and efficient system",5.0,,"Singapore MRT is one of the best public transportation system, widely used by local residents and tourists frequently to commute to work or tourist spots. Everyone should use this system as against private transport like taxi, cars etc. as it prevents traffic jams on the roads."
,,the world needs this,5.0,,"The whole world needs this facility. It is just superb. Always on time, very frequesnt, spotless clean, air con in the stations whilst the world melts outside. Well done singapore, fab system"
,,Cheap and fast travel all over the city!,5.0,,"I bought a 3 day tourist pass to travel the city, and it was absolutely worth it (best part is you get 10 dollars back in deposit for the card when you're done with it, and you don't have to think about bying tickets underway). The SMRT was easy to understand and navigate through and made travelling the city super easy - from getting to and from the airport to visiting pretty much anything else. Also a clean and rather calm environment. Wish they had this solution everywhere!"
,,Fast efficient and economical,5.0,,"With the MRT card topped up with say $30 for the week you can go anywhere. The Busses are on time and go everywhere. The Train has a vast network that is easy to understand and all signs are also in English. You can take a fairly long trip for very little.
Wish we had a network like this at home."
,,Excellent and Convenient,5.0,,"Accessible, Easy to Navigate; Convenient and Painless Travel; Excellent network - value for money traveling"
,,"Clean, cheap, easy and efficient",5.0,,"You can use the SMRT for the minute you land at Changi Airport. We purchased a smart card at the customer service desk at the airport just before you hit the MRT line to head into the city and loaded with $15 for 5 days, we still had a few dollars left when we headed home.
You can use the card on buses and trains, including the mono rail to Sentosa Island.
The systems are really easy
to understand and you can navigate around the city to all the major attractions.

The underground connecting malls ensures you stay dry or cool when moving around, it's just amazing where you can get to without coming up to street level.

Great value for cheap and reliable transport."
,,Easy to Use,5.0,,"This system is very organized. It's easy to figure out where you need to go. It's also in English, so easy for foreigners to use. Avoid rush hour times since so many people are going to work or going home from work then you have to stand."
,,Best way to travel,5.0,,"Very easy to use, very spacious, clean, quick. Great for getting around Singapore city quickly and of course it does not rain ☔️ in the MRT. You need a prepaid card and hop on and off as you need tap in and tap out!"
,,Singapore MRT - Quick mode of travelling,4.0,,"We traveled a couple of days by MRT during our holiday in Singapore. It took a trip or two to figure out the exact trains & routes to take to get from one place to another ; but once you get the hang of it , it's a very quick , convenient & cheap method of travelling."
,,Most efficient public transport in Asia,5.0,,"Singapore has always been a modern city with modern public services. The way they keep pushing the bar higher astounds me.

Their MRT system just keeps expanding, yet it is not confusing to follow. Tap cards are the main tickets used, but they also offered unlimited rides for tourist called ""tourist pass."" If you'd be going around Singapore a lot as a tourist, this is a definite buy.

The security and cleanliness of the MRt and their stations is simply awesome. I've ridden in MRTs in Hong Kong, The Philippines, Osaka, and even subways in New York and London. Nothing compares to the level of cleanliness and safety of a Singaporean MRT.

SMRT is the best way to get around the city, whether through their trains or their bus systems."
,,So clean and organized system,5.0,,"We have never experienced a more organized, clean system ever. You cannot eat or drink in the subway. There is an organized system to get in and out and no pushing or shoving. Not a lot of seats, you hold on to a rail system above your head. Easy way to get around Singapore."
,,EFFICIENT transportation,5.0,,"Efficient, on time, very clean and cost effective. Great for traveling with very young kids and babies."
,,Still operates on cash,4.0,,"Takes cash up to $5 SND and will not take $10 SND bills. Unless you buy a day pass which are expensive unless you are really grinding. The day passes are only sold at certain stations. I would think credit cards at every ticketing machine would be normal at this point in world.

The system itself is great, we took it nearly every where in Singapore, it is clean and not terribly crowded."
,,The Best,5.0,,I personally find Singapore the most convenient city-country I've been to. Everything seems to be veey systematic especially their transport system. They have the beat trains and train system which makes travelling from one place to another smooth and fast. If you're a tourist you can avail of a tourist pass depending on the length of your stay. All you need is a city map and your walking shoes and you're good to go.
,,Simple and Helpful,5.0,,"Just need to buy/rent a Tourist pass, for 1-3 days. You can buy it in the nearest MRT station, there are many sign on the way, especially if we arrived by ferry, we won't miss it, and we just pay about 26 dollar (2 days), 10 dollar for the deposit, you can have the money back when you return the Card before going home, make sure to return it in your final MRT station though...and dont lose it ^^
Tips: if you're using a transparent silicone phone case, you can put it inside in the back of your phone, so it won't be troublesome like put it in pocket or wallet, which is really have a high percentage for loosing it.

I used the STP card, and yup, I'm free to use any MRT and Bus for 2 days, at first i'm not really sure, but in my 2nd day in Singapore, when my STP card's balance is 0.0, i still can ride a bus, and not worry about paying it with money, cool."
,,Perfect connectivity,5.0,,"Singapore MRT is a perfect way to travel in this city country.
Every location is well connected with the MRT and it really cut shorts lot of extra walk. The air conditioned pathways offer lot of shopping and other places.
Train is good, avoid public high traffic timings. They charge extra if you travel in those times."
,,easy to reach the city,5.0,,You can use the Metro to every where. Transit from airport to the city centre as well. You can reach Marina bay with red line.
,,Puts the London tube to shame,5.0,,"Used a couple of times on a short visit. Easy to understand the maps, easy to navigate the system. Recommend to anyone trying to get around Singapore"
,,Clean and efficent,4.0,,Comparing it to many other Mass Transit Rail systems in the world this one is a good one - clean and fast...only gripe is that it is a bit convoluted to get from one line to the next in some stations.
,,Simple to use,5.0,,"The MRT is a really easy and efficient way to get from one destination to another. Download the app and you'll have no trouble whatsoever getting to where you need to be. Stand right at the front and have an unreal view of the tunnel as the train whizzes through. We purchased EZ Link cards at $S12 (purchase $S5 with $S7 credit) and also found that you could pay taxi (they displayed the EZ Link sign) and my son purchased a drink from a machine with his EZ Link card at the zoo (not all of them have this). The trains and stations are spotless and the air conditioning can sometimes be too cold. I must admit after a week of the MRT, even though efficient and comfortable, I felt a bit like a meerkat popping my head up from underground and opted to use the EZ Link card for the buses to see more. Buses are also like new, clean and airconditioned, some being double decker and run regularly."
,,Mass Rapid Transport,5.0,,"The most efficient, wallet friendly, convenient transportation available. Do travel out of the rush hour, which is 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM, otherwise its really a comfortable ride. Fully air condition and seats are readily available, and fast as well, can reach the city center within an hour. Do look out for seats reserved for the elderlies!"
,,Very easy to get around!,5.0,,Best transit system I have ever been on. Clean. Cheap. Clear and easy to navigate. For us. Cabs were essentially not needed unless we were going out to a nice dinner.
,,Very efficient,4.0,,"Great system and quite extensive. Best you work out your route in advance to save time and avoid errors in changIng routes so get a subway map first and study it.

If you are using it at peak hours or late in the evening and need to take a taxi from your last stop to your final destination be prepared for a queue and if the distance is short the cabbie may refuse (although they are not allowed to but I experienced this twice, I even said I would report them but they just sped off so obviously this is not enforced well) so you may want to stop near a hotel so getting a cab is more of a sure thing."
,,Very Organized and User Friendly,5.0,,"Within the past week we've become very proficient at catching the MRT at the Novena station on the NS line. Easy transferring to the Downtown or City Circuit line or any other. Huge money savings to get the S$5 card and money on it for S$12. The S$5 is non refundable. After four days we still have S$4 left on each card. Refill it as needed. Very safe, fines for eating, drinking, littering are stiff and enforced. Lots of escalators and elevators for any disability. People will get up for you if you need it."
,,The SMRT is Awesome,5.0,,"Anybody who has been to Singapore will know that this is probably one of the few cities in the world where the phrase Integrated Transport System is correct. The stations are clean and different. Many are attached to huge shopping malls, or connected by tunnels to other lines also with lots of shopping etc. You truly could spend a day on the trains and travel all over the island. If you do come here buy an EX Card from the counter, it's the easiest way to get around especially as you can also use it on the buses."
,,Easy travel,5.0,,You have to use the MRT it is so easy all stations are selflessly clean staff are very friendly and the cost is oh so cheap.
,,Good world class underground transport,4.0,,"Great underground... easy to navigate, reasonably priced. Good idea to download a map onto your phone before you set off as the information on the various lines can be a little sparse at some stations. Stations are clean, easy to find and very safe"
,,Easy way to get around!,5.0,,Best way to get around in the large city. Very well organized (like everything in Singapore) and easy to use. Also compared to everything else in there very cheap!
,,Easy to get around Singapore,4.0,,"Fast, clean, easy access and short walk from most of the major attractions or business areas that is a great alternative to taxis"
,,fantastic network,5.0,,"well connected and expanding that's what MRT can be summarised for,..you can reach any part of SG at a low cost and well on time. MRT are precise, convenient and economical"
,,"Convenient, affordable and efficiebt",5.0,,We purchased a two day visitor pass. It was well worth the $16 SGD as we traveled several subway and bus lines in Singapore. All of them were clean. The stations were clean. Services ran on time. Passes were easy to use. Refund process was quick and efficient at Changi Airport (refund was $10 cash each card). Definitely the best way to get around in Singapore.
,,Efficient,5.0,,"We used the MRT for most of our trip, it was excellent and handy to use luckily we were able to borrow a few MRT cards and top them up the way. We had no problems navigating our way using the MRT during peak and off peak times. All carriages were clean with AC!"
,,Fast Clean & Easy,5.0,,We have nothing but praise for the efficiency of this service. Trains every couple of minutes. Excellent signage. Great ticket options..plenty of seats available. Help offered by staff if you need it. Great English announcements for stations and switching lines.
,,"Clean, Fast & Reliable Transport System",5.0,,"The MRT transport system is such an easy & safe way to get around Singapore. On our 1st day we bought our EZ Link cards which cost $12 which is $5 for the card $7 credit. The card lasts for 5 years so you can keep it if you are planning to return. Most journeys are under a $, you have peak & off peak prices but so so cheap compared to the uk underground! Every time you use the MRT you scan in & out ,it's shows you how much each journey is & how much is left on your card. You can top up your card at most ticket offices & top up machines. Minimum top up is $10 & you can't go below $3 credit. We have been here for 8 days & used approximately $25(£14) but we have used it everyday and this included a trip to the night safari at the top end of Singapore(30min train journey). If you have credit left on your card when you leave, you can go back to the ticket office to get a refund. All in all a great, reliable, clean, fast, safe and in expensive way to travel while staying in Singapore."
,,An amazing and efficient rail system,5.0,,This system is constantly expanding so your guidebook may not show all the routes. Get a route map at one of the entrance booths in any station to be up to date. Don't worry about putting too much money on your card. I found that at the Changi Airport station I was able to get refunded any excess money on the card.
,,Wish we had this in Sydney,5.0,,"Cheap, safe, fast, quiet- a fabulous system and very easy to negotiate. It is wheelchair friendly with lifts and the people are very courteous."
,,"Easy to maneuver around Singapore, fast, clean, convenient.",5.0,,We traveled throughout the Singapore area using the subway. It is very fast clean and convenient. Good way to travel to the street vendors in Chinatown for some excellent food.
,,Great way to travel and so inexpensive,5.0,,"Bought a pass that lasts for 5 years for $5 with $7 credit, topped up once during my stay. Trains frequent, clean and safe. I believe they are driverless. Only quibble is they stop around midnight, shame not a 24 hour service."
,,"Clean, efficient, cheap, effective",5.0,,"This is the nirvana of public transport! It's fast, convenient and when used with the app, in conjunction with busses, very close to perfect! We each bought sgd18$ cards, travelled widely for 4 days and still had credit albeit not much at the end of our time. Annoyingly, you have to add credit at $3 balance, and then min increment is $10.. and the card cost is a non-refundable $5...... some long bus trips we took were 16c... it is very good!"
,,I wish we have the same transit system in the Philippines.,5.0,,"I like how their transit system works; I don't think being late is ever an excuse for people who are working in Singapore because in a few minutes you'll reach your destination via SMRT-- no precious time is wasted.

For first time visitors, it's easy to understand the transit system map. I can say that it's safe as well because there are cops roaming around in every station.

It's incomparable to Philippine's LRT/MRT."
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,"we bought an all day pass which can be used for both metro and buses. It costs 20.00 but you can get a refund of 10. at the end. It cannot be purchased at all stations, we got ours in Chinatown. You have unlimited travel and it is so clean and efficient."
,,Every country should have one.,5.0,,"So cheap - less than 2 dollars to get to all the major places single trip. Clean, efficient, lifts for cases/buggies/disability."
,,Use SMRT but buy a magnetic card,5.0,,"Singapore Mass Rapid Transport is a great enterprise - it is fast, efficient and still growing rapidly. The prices are very democratic - but visitors who are planning to go more frequently by SMRT or bus should buy a magnetic card. The saving is considerable!"
,,Unparalleled Metro System.,5.0,,Amazingly user friendly. Well-connected. No need to wait at any station for more than 5 mins for an interchange. Just one caution: it's not operated 24 hours. Most a close at 11.30pm. plan in advance especially if you are planning to go to airport.
,,Very efficient and convenient transportation,5.0,,"You will never get lost with the SMRT. It's great public transportation, and it's so easy to navigate. If you're fine with walking for a bit, and learning some of the buses, you will never have to ride a taxi going to anywhere, unless of course it's past 11:30 PM, where the SMRT closes. Still though, the most efficient and convenient mode of transportation in any city I have ever seen!"
,,One of the best public transport systems,5.0,,"You will need a map to make the most of this well run system. Down load one from the net and you can use it easier on your phone than the freebie paper ones. MRT goes most places. The buses link in and we often used buses to get to the tourist spots eg Raffles, Orchard Rd etc. Take some time to learn your nearest bus routes so you can come and go at your leisure."
,,EASE,5.0,,We used this twice and found it extremely easy and cheap to use. Thou taxis are quite cheap these are cheaper than any I have seen. Clean and quick
,,A must do,5.0,,"This is a must do activity for anyone who is being tortured by crappy public transport in their own country/city. Here you can experience first hand how life could be with fast, clean, efficient, safe and frequent public transport.
Especially recommended for public transport officials from Sydney: hang your heads in shame, then please ask Singapore to provide the expertise to fix things.
For tourists: the 1,2 or 3 day pass is available at Changi Airport, but also at any MRT ticketing office. Be aware that a day is a day, not 24hrs, so if you buy and first use at 8 pm, that is your first day!
If you don't have too much luggage, using the MRT from Changi to your hotel is quite feasible and a lot cheaper than a taxi, especially after 5pm. Just check on Google maps how far your hotel is from the MRT station. All is very well signposted and Singaporeans are a friendly lot, so no need to worry getting lost!"
,,A great way to travel,5.0,,"What a great way to travel around the city. Inexpensive, very clean and fast. We even traveled out to the Chinese/Japanese gardens with ease. Would thoroughly recommend."
,,clean and orgnaised Public transport,5.0,,"the Singapore mass Rapid transport or SMRT is clean, efficient and cost effective with to see the city day pasess avaibale for tourists in multiple different durations"
,,Efficiency at its finest,5.0,,"Of all metro systems I rode, the SMRT or Singapore MRT is the far most efficient I saw.. Fast transfer on all stations and reachable anywhere.. Fare price is fairly reasonable as it is on time and best of all CLEAN.."
,,"Clean, Efficient and Excellent",5.0,,"My title pretty much sums up my views. The SMRT is really easy to use to get around and thankfully it is in Singapore which means it is clean, efficient and well run. Other countries ought to take note!

Food and drinks are not allowed (great news). I hate seeing people chomping and slurping through smelly fast food snacks! And although there aren't as many station as say in London or Paris, they are adequate and on time.

Rush hour can be crazy-busy but as a mode of transport it is easy to use, even for ignorant tourists like me."
,,Excellent way to travel around this city,5.0,,"To get around in Singapore use the mrt. It is fast, efficient, cheap and a pleasant trip anywhere you want to go."

,,Brilliant public transport,5.0,,"Singapore is so easy to get around by train. Easy to understand maps, cheap tickets with easy to use tap and go cards, helpful staff, frequent services and very clean trains. What more could you ask for. We used the trains to go everywhere for 5 days and spent a bit over AUD $20."
,,Superb way to get around,5.0,,"We bought a EZ ticket at Changi on arrival and touched on and off for the four days we were in Singapore and travelled extensively around this amazing system. Easy to see where you are going, friendly Singaporeans offering one a seat (I'm getting on a bit in years), clean frequent, comprehensive, safe - best transport system I've been on and light years ahead of the NY Subway! And, after four days of travel we got the remaining credit on our ticket refunded when we left the country!"
,,Excellent system,5.0,,This is an excellent system and very easy to use. It never seems to get over crowded. It is very reasonably priced.
,,This was one of the best trains I have been on,4.0,,Their service from the people that worked there wasn't great but we managed to get help from the people of the public. The train rides were efficient and really good. It's a good way of travelling if you do not want to grab a taxi or have missed your tour bus.
,,clean and silent,5.0,,"singapore's smrt have really good system. sometimes i don't have to walk for transfer. if u take off ur smrt, transfer line is in front of u. also people who work in the office are very kind and helpful. it's so conveinece!!"
,,"Clean, Easy, Fast",4.0,,It is an efficient and easy system the only downside is there are not as many stations as in some cities so it can be a few blocks from where you want to go. Does mean you don't have that horrendous never ending merry go round of escalators.
,,"Clean, safe, on time & cheap !!! - What more can you ask for ???",5.0,,"I love trains - so the review is obviously bias.

However, the Singapore MRT is testament to the country's core infrastructure values rather than the superficial development displayed elsewhere in Asia.
It covers almost all locations and is extremely beneficial to the budget traveler less the sights. (MRT runs underground)
Google maps support routes and timetables - ticketing maybe tricky since everything is automated."
,,Super clean and efficient transportation,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system is the cleanest and most efficient I have been on. It's easy to get around town, and everything is clearly marked. I've used the system many times and I've always been very pleased with its performance."
,,"It's a transit system, not a tourist attraction",3.0,,This is a good bus/train system. It is not the second most important thing to see in Singapore. At least that is my opinion. Apparently my opinion is not acceptable to the editors here.
,,The Best,5.0,,The best and easiest way to travel in Singapore now with 5 lines connectivity from anywhere to anywhere is just a breeze
,,"Fast, convenient, clean",5.0,,"Commuting is seamless here in Singapore. The transport system is very organized and efficient. If staying for a few days as a tourist, do not forget to but the EZ link card."
,,Clean,4.0,,Clean fast safe way to travel around Singapore. Can be crowded at peak hour times. No food or drinks on transportation means it's very clean.
,,Easy and efficient,5.0,,The most economical way to use the SMRT is to buy a card. The SMRT goes everywhere with new lines bing added.
,,Simple way to travel around in Singapore,4.0,,"The Singapore MRT is easy to use and a cheap way of getting around. It's very busy at the usual commuter times, but outside those hours there is plenty of space on the wide carriages. They offer a 1,2 or 3 day tourist pass which includes unlimited train and bus travel, or a standard card which costs S$12, including $7 worth of travel and can be topped up. Most journeys cost less than S$2."

The system ran perfectly on time when we were there.
Cards for use on the MRT are cheap,amazingly good value for money as can use on buses too and compared to UK prices for time and distance travelled..its deal of the century!

,,Shelly,5.0,,"I rode the MRT in Singapore for 2 weeks. I initially put $20 on my card and I went all over the City in every direction.

,,"Great for short trips, but longer trips are time-consuming..",5.0,,"We loved getting around Singapore by MRT and found it easy to get tickets so long as you had coins or bills of S$5 or less. The MRT lines' directional guides are both numbers as well as names. The short journeys were great, even when it was necessary to change lines. But, a trip from the airport to downtown involved so many stops that trip required an hour, so a taxi would have been a better choice."
,,Using it for the daily commute,4.0,,"If you are a tourist coming to Singapore, travelling by heavy rail is the cheapest option available. It offers good connectivity too and despite Singaporean complaints, its reliability is really not that bad compared to London or New York.

Just be prepared to squeeze during the morning and evening rush hours. No way to avoid that.. Unless you hail a cab or private hire car (expensive during those hours!)."
,,Can get almost anywhere!,4.0,,"This metro was one of the best that I have been on. The stations and trains are clean. There are a lot of trains so even in rush hour I wasn't jammed in.

,,Easy and Cheap,5.0,,We used the subway for 3 days and it was easy and cheap. Get a MRT card from 7/11 or any subway station and cruise around. Its easy to navigate and you wont wait more than 5 minutes for a train. Takes you to pretty much anywhere you want to go including the airport.
,,Nice and convenient,5.0,,"Using the SMRT can get almost anywhere in the city. there are a few different lines and once they are studied, it's easy to get almost anywhere in a very cheap ticket prices.

,,Good and Clean Public Transport,4.0,,"The public transport is clean and efficient. You can go practicallty to all parts of the city with public transport. The best option for tourist is to buy 1,2 or 3 tourist pass. the one day tourist which is 10 SG dollar (plus 10 SG $ deposit) is ideal if you are planning a number of trips as it can used for unlimited travel. You can get one from Airport MRT station. You can get the refund back when you return the card to the same place. The booth closes during specific time for lunch and other breaks so check the times,"
,,its really excellent butttt,4.0,,the hours! Late night would be much appreciated. The system is super great. It makes me very sad about my home cities metro.
,,Very good system for travel around singapore,5.0,,"A nice public transport system well connected to all major locations of Singapore. Tickets can be purchased through venting machines or prepaid cards can be purchased at each stations.
Route map & system maps are provided in each station, which helps to decide which route / train to catch to reach the desired location. Very convenient system for travel."
,,The most efficient 'tube' system I've been on,5.0,,"Trains come every couple of minutes, it costs next to nothing to use, all of the stations are spotless and the trains are always on time. What is there not to love about it"
,,"best for travellers, disappointing for locals",3.0,,"oh well, it is pretty much well connecting to major tourist spots, and it is absolutely comfortable and safe to travel around with it. However at times it would be ''down'' or having ""traffic jam"", and easily takes up extra 30mins from east to west."
,,"Quick, comfortable, cheap and convenient",4.0,,"I am a frequent user and would highly recommend using MRT to get around Singapore for all destinations which could be reached by MRT. Only downside if at all is the peak hour rush and walking distance to the platforms in a number of stations. The frequency is very good . Recommend buying EZ Link cards which can be kept for 5 years which costs $5. If you wish not to waste your time to buy tickets in every station please go for this. If you are traveling in a group of 4 taxi can be a cheaper option from point to point especially while traveling short distances considering it can take you from door to door almost...
Do travel by MRT at least for the sake of experience. For me personally first choice anyday..."
,,Clean and Efficient Transport System,4.0,,"Most stops have shopping centers nearby conveniently, it's a reliable way to plan your trip with it."

,,Brilliant,5.0,,"The MRT is clean, efficient, speedy and easy to use. It is also good value. We liked the markings on the platform so that people gettin on stood at the sides and those getting off walked down the middle - very efficient."
,,Nothing to complain about,5.0,,"I truly can't think of anything that wasn't great about this service. The ticket machine is easy to read, you can keep topping up your ticket 5 times and then get 10c off (which is also re-using tickets instead of printing more out), the train seems to go everywhere and often (we didn't need to use a bus), it's all clean and spotless...no problems at all. We took our luggage on to Changi airport and had no hassles at all- bearing in mind it was 8pm on a Saturday, not peak times! Excellent service."
,,An impressive system,5.0,,"One couldn't help but be super impressed by the mass transit system Singapore has built over the years. As one who remembers the only way for a tourist to get around Singapore was by walking, black and yellow Morris Oxford taxi or bus the MRT is a very usable and wonderful change.

,,Lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,"Finding MRT on the top attractions list on tripadvisor left me wondering. ....

We travelled from One Farrer to Chinatown to have dinner @ food street. Automated machines dispensing tickets. Clean stations. Lots of information displays guiding you. Punctual trains . Lots of locals in trains returning from work....a real peek into singapore life style.

We enjoyed the trip so much that we took train from china town to bugis mrt.....gorgeous station n mall.

Coming back to one farrer mrt required a change of trains en route.....adding on to the attraction. .....oh i just love trains"

,,Clean and fast,5.0,,"This subway is clean and fast, you will find a good orientation via a lot of signs, and in case of any desorientation, there is also staff on some railway stations youz may ask, and every station has an information counter as well. With the Singapore Pass an easy and extremely cheap way to travel in that city."
,,Better than sightseeing.,5.0,,Get an EZ link card. It is cheap and very easy to get everywhere by bus or metro. The drivers are extremely polite. All vehicles airconditioned. We enjoyed every ride. It was like sightseeing.
,,Very confusing and long walks to platforms.,3.0,,Trains are clean and information on trains are good. A lot of the mrt stations are under shopping malls and require a lot of walking just to get to platforms. We found the bus network easier to get around

,,Didn't understand people reviewing this,5.0,,"Didn't understand why this was being reviewed before coming to Singapore. Then I used it and discovered why, everywhere is very clean, trains every 2-5 mins, very easy to navigate/use & very cheap. Did wonder about why it kept saying ""happy happy platform"" but discovers this was Hati hati (or something similar) meaning careful about the gap when leaving :)"
,,Very convenient and fast,5.0,,"Used SMRTs a lot during my week long stay. Bought a tourist pass at 20.dollars for 3 days. That gave me the liberty tomise the SMRT and the buses for an unlimited use. The SMRT stations are very conveniently located with access for everyone. Escalators and lifts make ot very easy to commute anywhere in singapore.
Every car on the SMRT has priority seats for aged, pregnant and women with kids.
Fast and reliant way to travel in singapore!"
,,Fantastic!,5.0,,One of the best MRT systems in the world. Easy to use the travel cards and to top up when required. Easy to find your way around the island. Very cheap transport across the whole of Singapore.
,,Singapore should be very proud of this,5.0,,"If only we could have something even slightly similar in any of the Australian capital cities. yes of course I know it is essential in Singapore - but even so how well it works. And the surveys! Well, the Rail satisfaction is over 95%!! And that is not good enough for the Government. They say they must try harder. Again, if only that could happen here. What I am trying to say is that the metro rail system is excellent - yes it needs expansion and this is happening. In the meantime, the services they have (including from the Airport) are clean, regular and efficient. Congratulations. Definitely use. Much faster than a cab. Easy to use value added cards for convenience."
,,Easy GO,5.0,,"There are great subways in the world: Paris, Hong Kong, Moscow, but this one in Singapore has to be one of the cleanest and easiest to use. It does not go everywhere, but for a tourist, it goes to all the needed places. And it is so easy to use. Their tourist pass is a real winner. Try it, it's an easy way to go."
,,Brilliant way to get around Singapore,4.0,,Really easy convenient way to get around Singapore. You can get a prepaid card which you just scan every time you use the trains. Cost about £5 and you get 20% off every journey you make. Can easily top it up if you need to at the stations. All the trains were really clean with good signage plus all the staff we spoke to spoke english and were very helpful.

,,Best transportation,5.0,,"East access to every tourist sites in Singapore. East to learn, affordable price and very convenient."

,,Amazing!,5.0,,"If there is a cleaner, more efficient and reliable subway system in the world to get around on. I'm yet to find it! Some of the stations have a deceptively long walk to street level, but I'm really nit picking. Great way to travel."
,,Great Way of Transport,4.0,,The SMRT is a quick way to travel and is really affordable. If you are on a budget then I would suggest taking the SMRT. It is really clean like the rest of Singapore.

,,"Very clean, very efficient",5.0,,Very nice subway system. There is still quit of bit of walking getting on and off the train in certain locations though.
,,"Comfortable, affordable, secure and clean",4.0,,"SMRT is clearly one of the reasons for not being one more driver on the Singaporean roads. It is clean, as is Singapore. The boards everywhere are always showing the fines: No Durians; No Food or Drinks; No Smoking. Singapore is improving its system and every year there are more stations and lines. It is a comfortable way for tourism, business and the daily life. Avoid the peak hours but anyway, even the most crowded car has not means of comparison with what we see in Tokyo, Shanghai or any big city in the world."
,,"Very Convenient, But Too Many Stops",5.0,,"The MRT of Singapore is ideal when visiting the city.

Pro: It connects all of the city-state and traveling from a to b is relatively easy.

Con: There are way too many stops on each line and the train should be moving much faster (to keep up with the stops).

Overall: This is really the only way to see Singapore conveniently, but plan your time accordingly."
,,Good Value,4.0,,"A day tourist is $10 Singapore with a $10 deposit a 2 day $16 and a 3 day $20, you get back when you return your card.

,,Modern and easy,5.0,,"We bought a 3 day pass for $28 + $10 refundable deposit. Great value. Lines run in all directions, with numerous interchange stations. Plus there is a circle line joining them all. In other words a very easy and economical way to get around the city, or to/from the airport. Clean, regular, well organised. I have seen a lot of Metros around the world, not all, but this would have to be World's Best Practice. WAKE UP SYDNEY AND SMELL THE TRAIN TRACKS!"
,,Highly efficient MRT System,5.0,,"The MRT system is qualified to be one of the attractions in Singapore.

From the ticket machine to the ticket office, you could realize how well do the government know how to treat their visitors.

The tourist card offers 3 different options, all of them become normal ez-link card once they are expired. What a smart design.

Besides, the temperature is relatively high from most Asian famous travel country, it's a nice idea combing shopping area with MRT underground path. And the most impressive thing is the cleanness!

So, I really wish the visitors could plan the trips via MRT in Singapore. It really amazes you."
,,Hopeless,1.0,,Below standards of what one would expect of a supposed 1st world city ! Inadequate & unreliable -- terrible.
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,We stayed for a week so bought an EZLink pass and loaded it up with an extra $20 during our stay so a week cost us $64 including the pass for two people and we still had about $3.60 left when we left Singapore.

The MRT is easy of course because there is a map but even the bus is easy because at each bus stop it lists the routes of all the buses that stop there.
,,The Best Underground I Have Ridden!,5.0,,"SMRT has got to be one of the best in the world - extraordinarily clean, safe and efficient, as well as inexpensive and extensive. The ticketing system (through machines in every station) is very simple and easy to use, and signage and information boards were clear and useful. Try to avoid the rush hours though - it does suddenly get very busy!"
,,"very good, clean, efficient",5.0,,"We used the subway for short distances, out of seasons and probably also out of the peak ours. We found it to be very clean and efficient. Buying tickets is not a problem, machines have good explanations. Orientation is easy. English being the main language it's easy to use for tourists, and seems very safe."
,,Unbelievable Excellent,5.0,,"From ticketing to travel, it's a WOW. As a tourist destination and with low cost effective travel, SMRT is the best, simply the best. We took a pass for 6 days and travelled through out. The buses were neat and on time, only on a few buses the display of next stoppages were not properly functioning. A must for travellers with budget and for those who want to explore of their own."
,,Great metro once you learn the ticket machines,5.0,,"Like most other Asian metros, this is very easy to use, especially once you learn how to use the ticket machines. We got some instructions from the information counter, but we also watched the locals to get the idea. Safe to use, easy to follow the maps, and very inexpensive--and clean, as is all of Singapore."
,,Efficient transport,4.0,,"If you get a hotel near an MRT station, it's a great way to get around and see the city. The tourist pass (1-3 days) is a great deal if you are in a location to use it, and you get a partial refund if you return the ticket after use."

,,Singapore Must Be The Envy of the World for its Peerless MRT. Thumbs Up...,5.0,,"Singapore's MRT is far reaching and all emcompassing. Spotlessly clean and impeccably maintained it spoils its citizens and visitors with on-time timetables, frequent services, joyful colours, smooth rides and cheap prices. The SMRT circuits connect the whole of the island. One can travel form North to South and East to West and all the stops along the way. We went all the way North to Kranji War Memorial for $1.60 each...taxis would cost, I believe, Ten times that much. Thumbs Up from Me"
,,very complicated,2.0,,"though they have the best place and prioritized the safety of the passengers,you will always feel your on a maze for a year just to get where you want to go."
,,Great MRT,4.0,,This is I guess one of the great mass rapid transit that I happen to ride. The inside is so clean and it is so fast.

,,Very convenient,5.0,,Very convenient and easy to find your way around. Big directional signs and almost always on time. Comfortable and not that crowded either.
,,An Amazing Transportation Network,5.0,,The Singapore MRT is a tremendous value if you will be doing a lot of sightseeing.

There is also an app for your mobile phone that can be used off-line that provides both a map and travel planner.
,,"Clean, efficient and the perfect way to get around Singapore.",5.0,,"This is one of the best ""Metro"" systems we have ever used. Spotlessly clean, regular fast and frequent services. To make the best of the system you need to get a Tourist Card to save time and effort."

,,Excellent service,5.0,,"What a fantastic underground service, at exceptionally good prices. As we stayed quite close to the Clark Quay station, we used the MRT a great deal. Loved it.

You can get a card from the ticket machines, that can be topped up for each journey. It costs an extra 10c for the first journey, which you get back on the third time of use. After six times, you get 10c off a journey for each extra use. Makes you keep hold of the card.

We used the MRT to get to the airport from the city, excellent service. About 45 minutes to the airport for less than S$4.00 per person."

,,Very well-organized network of fast trains,5.0,,"By buying a season pass, a traveler to the island state could easily enjoy himself going to the various tourist attractions which are mostly located near an mrt station and some even within a short walking distance. Every mrt station has been very well-planned and is usually accessible from many buildings and malls which are in turn interconnected to each other.

It is a well-thought-of means of public transport and the fares are very reasonable, in my humble opinion."

,,great public transportation,5.0,,"i always use SMRT if i goes to Singapore , because SMRT is very easy to use, on time, clean and comfortable"
,,Easy to use and efficient.,5.0,,We used the MRT several times a day. It was very easy to use and the trains were the most efficient I've ever come across. We purchased a tourist pass which gave us unlimited travel on the trains and buses for the duration of our stay. Kids under 7 year old can get a free pass but you do need to show their passport. The trains and stations are very clean.
,,Four year old free even she's above the height requirement for free kid,5.0,,"Purchased regular SMRT , with iron man theme card. wohoooo. cost me around SGD12, i think. top up with SGD50. I have asked if my kids need to purchased and says she's free, they just ask for age. I haven't show my passport and she's beyond the model kid height requirement. Shes just too tall for four year old. Same applies to Bus also. with 4 day trip In SG with bus and train I have consume less than 20SGD with all the lost trip also which I hop in and out in bus and train. I have only used the card also in 7/11. But cant be used inside after immigration in 7/11 . forgot to used them after going in. Which I planned not to surrender it. and consume all after.

,,Unreasonable habits,1.0,,I can never take a mrt ride in singapore when there is no one coughing or having a running nose. Nobody with such symtoms bother to wear a mask or even carry a handkerchief or tissue paper to cover their mouth. It seems that it is a joy for them to spread the viruses.
,,Confusing but Good way to Travel,4.0,,"Singapore is one of the countries that has been colonize by the British that is why the also have the way how British travel ( bus & trains). SMRT is very helpful in travelling around Singapore.. they have different MRT and LRT lines that are connected to one another just like the Englands Underground. My only comment is that some stations especially those with connecting stops like the Chinatown, it is very confusing. if your a first time tourist you have to really follow the arrows where some times leads to a dead end. Plus point to SMRT vs The Tube ok England is SMRT Stations have Lifts making it easy for those with small kids and disabled."
,,Singapore Mass Rapid Transit,4.0,,A smmooth commute from the airport to the city. At one point I went in the wrong direction and had to buy another ticket.
,,SG MRT,5.0,,Love the mrt because it is connected to the airport and as a tourist you can avail of the SG tourist pass which is so affordable. You can use it all day long for trains and buses.seldom to get lost in the subway since there are a lot of signages along the path. So you know what exit you will go.been to a lot of places and sg mrt is one of the best.
,,What a pleasant surprise!,5.0,,"Forget the overcrowding of London's underground this system is phenomenal. Airport to city, approximately twenty minutes and only £1.50p. Recommend a travel card, S$12, which can be topped up as necessary, with average travel between stops only 60pence. Keep up the excellent work and UK take note."
,,"Clean, efficient, reliable",5.0,,I recommend anyone arriving in Singapore for the first time to purchase an EZ-Link card immediately. Once you have one of these you can top up at any MRT station (minimum top-up 10 SGD). The whole of Singapore is now at your disposal by bus or train - simply tap in at the barrier on the MRT or at the machine on the bus and tap out on exit. The MRT runs like clockwork and is so easy to navigate. You can start your journey from the MRT station beneath Terminal 2 at Changi on the green line. It's so cheap to get around this way and for the places the MRT does not reach there are bus interchanges at several of the MRT stations.
,,Very clean and modern metro,5.0,,The metro was modern and easy to use. It was also cheap. I managed to loose my ticket somehow during one of the trips but the service was excellent when I asked for advice. The metro is really a good choice for travelling in Singapore.
,,Fastest way around Singapore,5.0,,"Every time I pass through Singapore, the vehicle traffic just seems to increase as well as the traffic jams. Despite the availability of buses and taxis traveling to every corner of the island, they are still plagued by the busy vehicle traffic.

For the shortest down times between destinations and attractions, the MRT is your best bet. Ticketing is easy, prices are affordable and there is no traffic congestion on the train tracks and tunnels. In addition, the trains appear frequently and with the addition of new stops and lines, you can travel all over the island.

It doesn't mean that the train isn't packed with people at peak hours and they don't break down from time to time. All things considered, it is still the visitor's best transport friend."
,,Train Ride to Marina Bay Sands,5.0,,"Having used trains and subways in most major cities I would rate the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit as the best and cleanest I have ever taken. The train diagrams were clear and the station staff know their work. Ticket purchase was a breeze, lots of signboards in 4 main languages was also to be commended. Overall was a outstanding travel experience."
,,"Brilliant transport system, easy to use, clean, efficient, fast and safe to use.",5.0,,"Easy to use maps-given away free at stations, hotel receptions or tourist information places makes it easy to plan your trip. You can buy, your ticket from a machine or purchase from a ticket desk, English is the first language, and all the staff are very friendly and efficient. You can pay for one trip at a time or purchase a travel card, there is a small one off admin charge of S$ 5. However the card is better value if you intend to make several trips on the MRT and it will save you time in the long term. The MRT is very clean, the stations are very spacious, and light, numerous moving staircases and lifts. directions for destination platforms and lines are very clear, and best of all you never have to wait long between trains, usually between 2 to 4 mins."
,,"Clean, efficient , cheap and safe way to travel around Singapore",5.0,,Well marked signs and maps both underground and on the streets. Quite a few stops take you to or close by many tourist attractions.
,,Efficient,4.0,,"Buy a EZ link card in the airport, and pay as you go on busses and MRT. The system is cheap, clean and efficient."
,,A Great Way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"We bought a day tourist pass. You do have to leave a deposit but it is refunded when you return the pass card. It was a great way to get around the city. It is clean, there are regular trains and easy to follow the signs and maps."
,,Must do,5.0,,Get yourself a tourist pass - we chose a three day pass. We went everywhere with no trouble at all. Just buy them at the airport or main stations. You even get some money back when u return the card. We returned ours at the airport.
,,common way of travelling for Singapore public !!!,5.0,,"the most common fast & cost efficient way of travelling in singapore !! SMRT (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit) is used by public in singapore to travel on daily basis. The trains & buses connect to each & every part of the tiny island. It is very easy to travel in SMRT as bus stops & MRT stations are located very near to each other.
You can use SMRT travel apps on your mobile for commute"
,,very easy to use as foreigners,4.0,,Easy to get tickets and user friendly. Extemely clean and tidy - even the loos are spotless! Ten times cleaner than London - I wouldn't even use the loos here!
,,Great Transportation,5.0,,Very efficient despite recent reported train breakdowns. The train network covers almost the entire island but the trains could be very crowded during the morning and evening peak periods. Try avoiding these periods for a more comfortable ride.
,,One of the best I've ever seen,5.0,,"Easily one of the best mass transit systems I've ever seen, and this from someone who lives in London and has used systems in most major U.S. and European cities. Clean, easy to understand and navigate, relatively inexpensive, and an air-conditioned oasis when it's hot as blazes outside. Just don't bring Durian with you."
,,"Easy, cheap & convenient",5.0,,"Taking the net in Singapore is great: it's cheap, easy and incredibly clean, keeping with th rest of the city. Safe, too! It will get you to within several blocks of pretty much every place worth seeing in Singapore.
The stations all have reliable maps with street names easily readable and the multiple exits generally have not only which street they open onto, but places of interest as well.
Tickets can be bought for single or multiple rides at all stations."
,,So easy to transfer from one line to another,5.0,,"Different colours, differentiate which side of town to go. Very user-friendly. Nice and cool inside the train."
,,Bedok To Jurong,3.0,,"Always too Crowded, Seats very limited, very tiring for Long distance standing. As for Trains cleanest should be 4 Stars."
,,Singapore MRT,4.0,,"Despite reports of MRT service disruptions from time to time, MRT is still one of the fastest public transport service in Singapore and for that we should be thankful instead of complaining too much. I do believe SMRT is trying to have the maintenance level up to have less service disruptions / delays. Plus the MRT stations are all conveniently located."
,,Lifeline of Singapore,5.0,,"Well connected, well managed network. This is an integral part of the Singaporean system. Cost effective that similar systems in most other nations."
,,Travel easy,4.0,,"Easy to travel in SMRT. The signages help and it is clean quiet and smooth. Staff are friendly and helpful. There are lifts and escalators so if tired or unable, you can use them. The maps show the route to take. There are more than one line so travelling routes have options.The stations are all cool and nice."
,,"Frequent, convenient",5.0,,"...that is once you've figured out the discount multiple load tickets. Many customers seem to be bewildered by this ticketing process as groups take AGES to free up machines, And for visitors whose lowest available money is often $10 it is infuriating and stupid that $5 is the largest bsnknote accepted by the machines."
,,very useful,5.0,,we use MRT during our visit in Singapore. it is time saving as well as money saving. MRTis safe. It very easy to operate and the personnel in the station are very helpful.
,,SMRT,5.0,,Buy the card when you get there as it offers good savings for each trip. Clean and never have long to wait for the next one. Easy to use too.
,,Excellent way to get around,5.0,,"This is a cheap, clean, safe and well run transport system that can get you around Singapore very easily and quickly. For someone who struggles negotiating foreign public transport this system was so easy to use we kept on using it for most trips out."

,,Definitely the way to travel when in Singapore,5.0,,Excellent train service. From the airport to the hotel and just about any where else you want to go. More lines being added as well
,,Public Transport,3.0,,We had an efficient and reliable public transport system in the 80's and 90's and over the years the population went up and the ridership as well also the evolving of modern gadgets and the public space of sharing is even more precious than before.
,,Observations relating to your rides,4.0,,"Except for the occasional breakdowns, the system works well and efficiently!!! It also enable commuters to transfer to other lines of similar rail system (such as the North-East line, Circle line) which makes travel a brisk. Tourist to Singapore will also be able to use the rail system to move from Changi International Airport to practically anywhere in Singapore. It is also a cost effective means of travel and the ride is always a pleasure. It is also noteworthy to see that the cabins of the train are always kept clean and the strict guidelines on the use of the cabin rides ensures that it is kept that way. It is also useful to take time to stop at each of the train station as they are a miniature representation of the various racial and cultural found in Singapore."
,,Best in the world perhaps.,5.0,,"It might be an audacious claim, but Singapore MRT is one of the best around. It's clean and efficient. Above all, it actually covers a lot of ground. Going to places of interest is easy. Above all, have you seen the puns created from the MRT stops? (You must live in the East, for you made my heart go ""Bedok, Bedok, Bedok"")"
,,World class infrastructure,4.0,,The regular train service is awesome. Good job Singapore and continuing to expand it as well. The LTA aim to double the capacity by 2030.
,,Awesome daily travel Service,5.0,,Awesome service and all information pertaining to the train travel is provided at designated areas. Customer service officers are very friendly and informative.
,,More or less efficient,3.0,,Generally very efficient and best way to move around in Singapore but over the years have experienced more frequent service disruptions. Gets very crowded during peak hours.
,,Good and clean and timely service,5.0,,"SMRT is very mode of transport for the city state with very clean carriages and timely service to almost all parts of the city. Good for business people, locals and tourists to reach destinations on time."
,,Very convenient and reliable transport in Singapore,4.0,,A very convenient and reliable transport system in Singapore; It provides fast and comfortable transportation within Singapore.
,,Could have been BETTER !,3.0,,"The train has frequent intermittent stoppages especially when it is reaching at a station which is rather disturbing, hope this is something the authorities can look into and improve ... we have been waiting ..."
,,Not constant in services,2.0,,"Indeed the transportation is fast, easy and assessible but it would end up problematic when break down during peak periods, emergency times. After services to assist off this inconvenience might not be fast and good sometimes. Like shuttle bus services, it may not give clear details or have staff around to assist."
,,Very efficient,5.0,,"An efficient way of travelling Singapore, it is very convenient and easy. Many signages to point you in the right direction. Staff are friendly to assist you to go to your destination. It's clean and rarely breaks down."
,,Very convenient and mostly on time,4.0,,"Singapore is a small country, so it's very convenient to have train as the public transport. You can reach almost all tourist attractions easily, and the timing is quite good. It's not too crowded, and the traveling experience is mostly comfortable."

,,Tremendously easy mass transit and super clean,5.0,,"Easiest and most inexpensive way to get around Singapore: whether it's the train or bus, coverage is fantastic."

,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"Very easy to use, extremely clean, fast- the only way to travel! And very cheap. The tickets machines are very self explanatory and in English!"
,,"Easy to use from airport, clean and safe.",5.0,,"This is perfectly clean, on time and there are plenty of maps to guide you. I took my small daughter with no problem, no safety issues at all and no overcrowding, unlike many large cities. I would suggest that if you are a foreigner and coming into Changi Airport without Singapore dollars go to the currency exchange station in the airport and get some Singapore dollars. The kiosk we used to get a train ticket was easy to use but only took Singapore dollars. You will board the train inside the airport and directions are clearly marked so there is no need to go outside and no problem with luggage (number of pieces within reason of course). I would also suggest printing or downloading the route map prior to traveling to make things simpler. I also suggest confirming any holiday schedule as times may vary. It does not operate 24 hours so plan accordingly if you have a flight. We had a 5 am departure so we had to use a taxi to return to the airport."
,,Extensive subway system among the best in the world,5.0,,"The system goes throughout the city-state and out to the airport. It is very modern. There are barriers so that people cannot fall onto the tracks. The trains have moving lights on the maps as well as voice synthesized announcements of each upcoming stop, making it very easy to use even if you are new to the city. The cost is very reasonable. From near the Singapore National Museum to Changi International Airport, the fare is less than $3 USD. The stations are clean and there are no homeless people inside or outside."
,,One of the Best MRT Systems in SE Asia,5.0,,"SMRT is the best & most economical mode of transportation in Singapore. There's a network of lines & stations which cover the Singapore area so it's easy to reach the many sites & attractions. We were in Singapore for a few days where our cruise started so we used the SMRT to & from the cruise terminal. I recommend that travellers purchase a TOURIST Pass which is discounted & economical. You definitely get your monies worth if you visit multi attractions & sites versus paying individual fare for reach place visited. The stations & lines are easy to use but require a bit of planning to reach destinations as transfers & crossovers are necessary. The system is clean, modern & safe to travel. It even has rules for passengers such as no eating & carrying specific fruit & flammable items. The MRT travels entirely underground, is quick but does not provide any views of the city or landscape. If you want to see Singapore & area from street level; use one of the Hop-On Hop-Off buses."
,,Clean and Efficient,5.0,,"The MRT system connects the whole island, making it easy to get wherever you want to go. The MRT lines are straightforward and there are helpful maps everywhere to help you figure out how to get somewhere, how long it will take, and the train announcement systems will help to ensure you don't miss your stop.
The MRT is an affordable way to travel, as well as an efficient one. Besides the occasional breakdown (which are fixed quickly as soon as possible), trains arrive at regular (and short) intervals, and the travel time estimates are pretty accurate as well.
Trains and stations are also kept very clean, and even though some of the stations may be a little maze-like (especially large interchanges) there are signs everywhere as well as helpful staff to make sure you don't get lost.
The whole system is so well laid out and easy to remember that almost any other passenger you ask will be able to give you instructions how to get to any station from any other station as well!"
,,Cheap and convenient mode of travel,5.0,,"This is probably the best way to get around Singapore at a cheap price. Even if you're trying to go somewhere without a station, it will probably still be most economical to take the train to the nearest station and then switching to bus or taxi."
,,Singapore holidays,5.0,,"SMRT, the easiest and safest form of transportation in Singapore.
Stretching from one end to the other throughout the island.
Cheap & fastest way to get around.
Clean & comfortable.
Travelling both underground and above street level.
Waiting time for trains is a mere 5minutes.
It brings ypu to all great Singapore adventures shoppings, sight seeings or just passing time seated comfortably in the carriage.
Must try when you are in Singapore."
,,Extremely Efficient!,5.0,,"Coming from a very less developed country (India) which has a very poor public transport system, the SMRT and Buses in Singapore were unbelievably excellent!"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,Buy a transit pass when you arrive and catch the train. We have travelled all over the Singapore area on the metro system and find it an excellent way to get around. Some of the large interchanges can be a little confusing initially but all the lines are colour coded but a few minutes observation will soon solve the problem of where to go. The trains are fast and very clean and people are polite.
,,Brilliant transport system,5.0,,This is the cleanest and most efficient underground system in the world. The trains run really frequently and it is easy to switch between lines underground (away from the traffic and heat). It is cheap too and you can get a day pass for just S$10. A great way to see the sights.
,,just great,5.0,,"First of all, i m not public transportation person at all. But in Singapore this really make a sense. Not that big area and You can go almost every place in Sin. Only place what I notice which did not have station was Sngapore zoo.
You never have to wait more few minutes the next train.
Just buy your credit card looking ticket and top it up for 20 dollars and you can ride long way. Normally one trip cost less than dollar.
But in trip advisor this is second in things to do list in Singapore. This is not attraction, this is how people move between the place in Singapore. This is how you go to next attraction.Very easy to use!"
,,Amazing Underground,5.0,,"So clean and easy to use . Also very cheap just 2.5 singapore dollars about £1.50 for a 45 minute journey from Changi airport to central Singapore . take small bills 2s, 5s etc . Just go to the touch control ticket machine , touch the station you want to do to , choose how many tickets , insert the money and it prints the tickets . Excellent service . an attraction in its own right ."
,,Singapore should be proud !,5.0,,"clean,safe,cool and polite passengers.The way to get around.oh and the staff are very helpfull to tourists."
,,A to B,4.0,,"A to B, not a lot more to say about a fairly good transport system. Its clean, comfortable and does what it says."
,,simply Clever ;),5.0,,"Easiest way to get around city. No problems with the tickets, signs etc. No delays. You can reach every part of Singapore."
,,so easy,5.0,,Really easy way to get around. Has a app that does not require wifi or mobile connection to help navigate your way around. Fares are well priced.
,,Probably the best subway/mass transit system in the world,5.0,,"Works like a charm, cost is very low, access is very, very easy. You are never more than a few steps away from a bus that will zip you to a station if you don't live next to one."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Chinatown MRT closest to the Scarlet. Clean efficient and cheap. Easy connections to other parts of the city.
,,Just back from a trip down town,5.0,,"The MRT is really easy cheap and so clean.
Be warned when buying tickets you must have Singapore dollars (no $50.00) accepted in machine.They also only accept Mastercard at the ticket office.

For a city so efficient,these quirky little things can be a little frustrating at the start of your
Journey."
,,Liable transport,4.0,,"nothing is prefect, but this transport mode is quiet liable. It is one of the favorite public transport ."
,,Great metro system,5.0,,This is a very easy metro to use....cheap and plenty of maps and directions. I used it 4 times...very clean and pleasant
,,Mode of tranport around Singapore,5.0,,"Quite efficient transportation from location to location. It is quite clean, easy to move around and good value. It save time and does not know the meaning of traffic jam or lights. It just goes from point to point very quickly and efficient in less time."
,,"Clean, with everyone playing on their smart phones",4.0,,"Easy to navigate on the 5 or 6 lines. Plastic seating on all trains, and as with the rest of Singapore amazingly clean?"
,,Used it for 4 years,5.0,,Best way to get around Singapore. Grab a card from one of the stations and tap and go all over Singapore.
,,Ease and efficiency (mostly),5.0,,"You could go by taxi in Singapore, but for most trips why would you with such a clean efficient service awaiting you in the MRT. Visitors can purchase a tourists pass for unlimited travel for 1, 2, or 3 days, and I highly recommend this as the easiest way to get around. One quibble - you can buy this pass only at selected MRT stations, and then only at certain ticket booths at those stations. Not sure why this has to be given there are ticket dispensing machines for standard rides all over the place. Nevertheless, day or night you'll not wait longer than 5 minutes for the next train, the maps and sign-posting are crystal clear, and the air-conditioned, pristine carriages are a delight."
,,Singapore public transport,4.0,,"The train service network is reasonably spread and expanding. Good quality transport at fair price. Quite comfortable at most times. During office timings it can get quite crowded, however frequency is quite good,"
,,Cleanest public transit I've ever used.,5.0,,"This is an understatement. I was in NYC a couple of weeks prior and the MRT system in Singapore is so much better it is ridiculous! It is so clean, extremely fast, well mapped, easy to use and a pleasant way to get around the city. Plus everyone is nice who rides and it is very safe."
,,Impeccable!,5.0,,"Such a god system, easy to use and affordable, I have seen no equal. Makes our public transport in Switzerland look small. The trains are clean, large enough to accomodate all passengers, and they are on time!
Passengers adhere to the rules, wait with bording till the others got out, no one pushes or jostels, seats are offered to the aged or impaired.
Congrats Singapore!"
,,Very efficient,5.0,,Easy to use and handy in the city. One thing to look for is if you catch the SMRT to the airport make sure you get in at either end of the train and then look along the train as it travels from the last station to the airport. The train really snakes around corners; quite an unreal experience.
,,Excellent public Service,5.0,,"The SMRT is one of the best in the world safe, reliable and spotlessly clean. Access from the airport right into the city centre and surrounding districts. There's also a link to the cruise terminal if you coming or going by ship. Get one of the passes to make extra value for yvour stay."
,,best travel - clean trains,4.0,,"Smrt having their trains clean , few trains coming short interval during peak hours - great work . Going to work is pleasant , aircon at times low when during crowd , but good when lesser people in the train ."

,,One of the best transport systems and most convenient,5.0,,"Well the Singapore MRT system, is pretty much reliable, quick, safe, clean and affordable.
What more can you ask for, its way faster during peak hours comparing to getting a taxi, yes you may have to squeeze with the rest, do some standing, but it saves you lots of time"
,,Probably the best train system in the world,5.0,,What can I say? So easy to use this mode of public transport. The time tables are regular and on time so if you miss it don't worry there is another in a few minutes (not like Sydney where you have to wait for half an hour or more!). This takes you to almost all the places you want to go alternatively the buses are as good too. Not much to say other than fantastic way to get around and very affordable too!
,,Getting around in Singapore,5.0,,Great way to get around in Singapore. Very well connected to many places and cheap. Avojid the morning and evening rush hours where the trains get overcrowded.
,,So easy to get around !,5.0,,"Do yourself a favor - get an MRT card ! $10 will last you quite a while, shooting you all around Singapore. It definitely beats walking and is super efficient !"
,,Mr,3.0,,Slow and jerky bus 166 ride from Mt Alvernia to China Town on 3rd Feb 2017 at 5pm. Twicw some travellers ask for directions but the Bus Capt was probably non english speaking. Looked like Mandarin speaking.
,,MRT - Best way to visit Singapore,4.0,,"A cheap and convenient way to see the city state. Strongly recommended. From the airport to various places of interest including Sentosa, Orchard Road, Chinatown, Little India, Marina Bay Sands, shopping malls connected to many MRT stations and others. In addition, visit the various neighbourhood towns and get a glimpse of the typical Singaporean daily life away from the tourist places."
,,Frequent Breakdown,1.0,,"Bad experience and disruptive. During breakdowns information feedback are inconsistent and unhelpful. Despite these breakdowns operator keeps blaming other factors rather than poor management. Instead of resolving the problem, keeps on praising oneself as if nothing happened. Very sad state of affair."
,,World's Best!,5.0,,"After going to so many cities around the world, I am happy to be home to enjoy our MRT system, which is really world class & immaculate."
,,Great way to travel,3.0,,Our MRT may not be the best in the world but it's one of the more easily assessable form of transport for many on this small island
,,Best transport ever!,5.0,,"The easiest, safest and cleanest train system in the world! Stop are well indicated an din each station there are clean toilets."
,,Execellent infrastructure,5.0,,"The SMRT in Singapore is a lifeline to this well-organised city. Rapidly expanding to cater to different parts of Singapore, this service is reliable and affordable. The facilities are clean and some of them are also self-sufficient. I love my rides on the MRT every time, I use it."
,,Easiest way to commute in Singapore,5.0,,I like to use SMRT train on daily basis. It can take you to almost every corner of Singapore. Operates daily from 6 am to 11 pm. Aside from the train there are also buses and taxis around as alternatives.
,,RAPID BREAKDOWN,1.0,,"Recent years, SMRT has failed to maintain its standard as compared to the first 15 years of smooth operations. As commuter, we are expecting to see the services improved after so many years of experiences but instead, we see deteriorating in services. What can we hope for in 2017? Are we not targeting at 'ZERO' BREAKDOWN? Is 'ZERO BREAKDOWN' too high an expectation from a group of so called highly paid experts?"
,,Singapore MRT - Simple and Easy,4.0,,Well worth the time to purchase one of the EZ-Link Travel Cards if you're spending a week or so. Similar to the Smartrider (for West Australians). It can be used on Buses and Trains and saves time queueing. Just tap on and off like the locals do. Card can be purchased at most train station Ticket Offices and then loaded up with some local currency. IT does with some $$ pre-loaded but can't recall the amount.Each time you get off and tag off it will show your balance so you know if you need to top-up. From memory they are valid for 5 years so don't throw them out when you're done. Keep them for your next trip or share with friends travelling to Singapore when you return home.
,,Fantastic way to move around!,5.0,,SMRT offers easy and inexpensive way to explore what Singapore has to offer. We purchased three day passes which were good value for money.
,,The best subway,5.0,,"You don't need to die to know the Heaven, I can do this only by visiting Singapore! Their subway is only the best in the Globe, the stations looks like a staions of Disney park , but cleaner than any other one!"
,,Best trains in the world!,5.0,,"Perfect clean way to travel all over Singapore. Very easy maps at all locations. Just punch where you want to go; the machine will tell you how much to pay. I never saw such clean trains and stations. You would think it was hospital floors as there is not any dirt or trash anywhere. Note, there is no one driving the train; remote control."
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,It's just like many modern transit systems around the world. It is easy to get money on a card and English is the main language. Felt safe at all times and very clean
,,Excellent public transport.,5.0,,"The MRT made it so easy and cheap to travel around Singapore and see all the attractions, still can't belive how clean and efficient the whole service is, and it's so, so cheap."
,,"Clean, convenient and affordable",5.0,,"They have added more lines now and you can basically get to anywhere with MRT. Very organized and easy to navigate your way around, you can buy the season MRT card and use for bus rides as well.

There's staff on duty for crowd control during peak hours.

Inside the train, clean and cool even when it's crowded. It also tells you which side door will be opening.

Best way to move around this island is by MRT and bus!"
,,Public Transportation Done Well,5.0,,"The SMRT should be the model for other public transportation systems. The facilities were extremely clean, easy to use, fair value and on-time. While it doesn't serve every little part of the island, most anything you would like to see or visit can be accessed by a short trip on the SMRT and a short walk."
,,Great mean of transport,5.0,,"Typical tube/subway style of public tranaport. Very efficient, clean and cheap! Cleaner and more modern than London's tube system."
,,World's best public transit system?,5.0,,"FlashPay Card, price, service, cleanliness. What more could you ask for? The MRT makes it so easy to get around the city that I can't imagine any other way."
,,The only way to travel in singapore,5.0,,"Wish the London tube was half as good! Clean, safe trains, very frequent service. Fares reasonable. Buy a travel card to speed your journey."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Very clean and efficient Covers most of the central city area Would advise visitors make use of this
,,Smart travel...,4.0,,"This is the most efficient, cost effective way to get around as either a local or tourist. It is easy to navigate and is clean! Cost us very little, under $2 to get from airport to City Hall in the centre of town. Can't say anything bad about it, just do it ! Just use it ! Also used it day in, day out throughout our stay, cheapest trip was .77 cents, just can't beat it."
,,Used to be good and reliable...,3.0,,"The company's focus on profit-making and rental of shop/F&B spaces in MRT stations and linkways took precedence over its core business of providing reliable and timely transportation. Years of neglect and cost-cutting in terms of hardware maintenance have led to regular breakdowns due to various reasons, including track and signal faults. Nowadays, breakdowns are so common that it is no longer reported as a news item, and taken as a usual occurrence by commuters..."
,,One of the Best in the World,5.0,,"Singapore have got it it all worked out when it comes to public transport by train. Spotless, fast, efficient and effective. If you are in Singapore for both pleasure or business this is the only way to travel as everything is accessible, even though you may have to change trains. We were in Singapore for 9 days and got the Tourist past which was $20 plus a $10 deposit for unlimited travel on Train, buses and light rail. The SMRT was the winner by far and we smashed it and saw so much of Singapore."
,,Good,5.0,,Very reliable. If you look at the network it will take you anywhere you need to go. Not to worry. You dont need taxis
,,Fast and reliabe,5.0,,We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and purchased the stored card which is every handy. The map is easy to understand and super convenient. You can also use it for the train to Sentosa. They will give you a refund at the airport station if you still have money left on your card.
,,Great rapid transit system,5.0,,Loved using the MRT. Very efficient. Lots of english signs. Easy to get on and off MRT. Only problem we had was finding best exit up to road level.
,,Great system - easy and cheap,5.0,,"We bought a charge card and put $20 each on it and have used everywhere for 3 days. It also works on all buses. When you leave Singapore you can refund the balance ( all except $5). You can buy a $10 tourist pass as well but you need one for everyday so for us that would have been the more expensive option.
Great value and very clean and quick"
,,Clean and so touristy.,3.0,,"Commuter-friendly, not enough seats for everybody, not enough space for multiple luggages and trains have warnings of how much the penalties are and it is kinda scary."
,,Anazing,5.0,,"Well what an amazing system , so easy cheap and fast . I would say buy a open ticket we didn't and was a bit of a pain waiting for ticket machine please take note the machines only take small notes i.e. $2 and then coins a bit frustrating when you have cued but once we understood no issue ."
,,Good transport system,5.0,,The overall experience was good. Singaporeans are very polite and their rules are quite strict. No food and drinks means NO FOOD AND DRINKS.
,,Can you Please run Sydney's Transport System,5.0,,If Sydney had an on time and efficient Transit system like this I would use it. Congrats Singapore. Well done. Clean and efficient and safe to use.
,,Efficient Transpo!,5.0,,"I really love this MRT acessible and efficient good thing that it is connected in Changi Airport, you will never be lost."
,,Clean and efficient,5.0,,"Easy to get around, trains very clean and regular service. Relatively inexpensive as well, I was only paying about $1.70 for a single."
,,"User friendly, clean abd reliable",5.0,,"I spent three days in the city and the MRT is the best I've come across...on par with Taipei albeit the same design. It's clean, well signed, cheap and the staff are ultra helpful. I sincerely take my hat off to the SMRT and wish London would take note. You have certainly set the bar high!"
,,Doesn't get more convenient,5.0,,"One of the best subways we've used. Super convenient for tourists and locals alike. It's about 40min to town from the airport. There's little need to take a taxi for most places, but taxis are great too when you can avoid the surcharges."
,,SMRT is GREAT,5.0,,The SMRT is a wonderful way to get aroung Singapore. We purchased 3 day passes for our family. Easy!
,,A highlight of Singapore,4.0,,It never ceases to amaze that an island this small can having such an amazing transport system. Buy the stored value ezy card.
,,Easy to navigate,4.0,,"The transit was very clean, the stations are easy to navigate. The only thing I would recommend is that you get the full day pass for 10 dollars. You have to get this at the ticket window, not the machines. This way if you accidentally exit when you were not suppose to, you can re enter. This was the only confusing part. We entered one gate and there was another gate that we thought we needed to go through but once you go through you can't get back in. Other than that the system got us every where we wanted to go very easy."
,,Fast efficient,5.0,,all ways on time fast and efficient ideal for first time visitors we used a 3 day pre paid card very easy to use when hopping on and off trains this covered buses too
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Do not be afraid of using public transport in Singapore. It is no expensive and efficient and of course clean. Easy to read maps, buy tickets and when we were checking a wall map at a station a staff member came and helped. Single trip tickets or multi trip or a tourist pass all easy to use."
,,SMRT is made for tourists,5.0,,"The SMRT makes getting around Singapore a doddle for citizens and visitors alike. It has improved greatly since the early '90s when separate tickets had to be purchased for the different lines, which was very difficult for tourists. The best bet for tourists is now to buy the 1-, 2- or 3-Day Tourist Pass, costing S$10 /day plus $10 deposit refundable after use. These smartcards are sold at all SMRT stations and they entitle the user to travel on trains and buses at all times of day or night, even to and from Changi Airport Terminal 2 (for about S$2.40 - forget taxis). The Number 36 bus also serves the airport. Trains seem to run every couple of minutes very efficiently, and buses now include very smooth double-deckers, which are awesome for seeing the city. Buses are cheaper than trains so you can do a heap of travelling for $10. Too easy; typical Singapore."
,,Excellent means of transport,5.0,,"Most rides $1.50 we paid for singles at the machines. Very clean air conditioned stations and trains, easy and fast to use. Really no problem and a great way to get around the city."
,,Great way to travel in Singapore,5.0,,"Very easy to get around with the mass transit. Clean, safe and inexpensive. Love traveling this way. Also its a great way to see the real Singapore. Don't be afraid. Everything is in English"
,,Efficient and polite transport system,5.0,,"The Singapore MRT is a modern and efficient system, constantly being upgraded, with lines extended for more service. The system of entering and exiting the cars (designated by green arrows for exiting and red arrows while waiting to enter) works flawlessly, due to the discipline and polite nature of the Singaporean people. Excellent signage at all stations indicating which exit to take for the hotel, attraction or office tower you are looking for. Payment system very easy to use with cards that can be topped up. Service centres at every stop are manned by friendly people."
,,The best thing to happen to Singapore,5.0,,"We visited Singapore for 5 days in Jan 17. If u plan to visit for more than 3 days u should opt for a touch n go card (even we did the same). Very convenient and easy to use and recharge. Also, MRT is the easiest system to understand. Try understanding the KL rail system .. it's so difficult to understand.

Stay in Bugis, Little indiaor dhoby ghaut of you want to travel more as these station are central stations."
,,mot much spread,4.0,,"The bus and taxi are much better mode of transport in Singapore. I think is not very well spread. Even if you take metro, you again might need taxi to go nearby"
,,It's a mass transit system,4.0,,"I'm not sure how a transport system gets to be so highly ranked on attractions in any city.

For most visitors, and certainly those living here, this is the simplest way to get around, but stations cannot be built everywhere, so in many cases it's a case of train to the nearest stop then walk."
,,SMRT,5.0,,"SMRT is very convenient transportation system in Singapore city. When we walk out from Termianl 2 or 3 at Changi airport you can looking for the sign Train to city.
First time we recommend to buy MRT EZY-Link multiple travel 12 SGD card value for 7 SGD (5 SGD is the card deposite)"
,,Very organized,5.0,,The mass transit of Singapore is way organized compared to that on the Philippines. The stations have a lot of signages you will never be lost. And the Singaporean commuters are so organized and very disciplined. You should be mindful of the rules when commuting because there's a lot of strict rules to follow and they will impose fines if you violate them. And the trains are very clean.
,,"Clean, efficient and cool.",5.0,,"Been in Singapore for about a week now and we are hugely impressed with the MRT. It's reminiscent of the MTR in Hong Kong long open carriages in brushed metallic finish. Every one (including fellow commuters!) are very helpful. The system is easy to navigate and very cheap. There's 4g phone signal everywhere too boot!
Beats london's archaic Tube system hands down."
,,Easy and Cheap,5.0,,"Don't be misled by the title, I am talking about the MRT. Buy a top-up card ($12) and off you go on the 4-minute frequency trains or the buses. The signposting is very clear on the MRT - you can't go wrong, and you can even download an app to check on routes. Stations are well staffed and spotlessly clean. Even on the buses, the next stop codes displayed can be found on Google Maps by clicking the bus stop icons. And the cost of a journey? Pennies. If only the UK could manage to run public transport like this!"
,,MRT your way around this great SIngapore,5.0,,"Let MRT whisk you away to most destinations in Singapore, Including the airport. Best to buy a 3 day pass , costing 30 Singapore Dollars of which $10, is refundable when the transit card is returned.

Added bonus is to experience the totally spotless cars and view the life underneath the streets as most stops double as shopping malls."
,,Super Easy and Convenient,5.0,,"I travel quite a bit and Singapore's train system has got to be one of the best in the world. Easy, super clean and even has a great air-conditioning system that is so helpful in the warm weather. The trains are also all quite new."
,,"Excellent, efficient and cheap mode of transport",5.0,,Excellent mode of transportation. Extremely cheap. Gets you to majority of the tourist destination. Very informative maps and friendly staff. It is quite difficult to get lost.
,,Wonderful way of traversing singapore,5.0,,"Cheap clean, efficient and connects all parts of Singapore, if you are a tourist I recommend buying the 3 day pass, although it may not work out cheaper it is a very convenient way of travelling, very easy to travel into the centre of Singapore from the airport"
,,"clean, efficient, safe",5.0,,"I wish every city has transit system like Singapore! even though it covers pretty much the entire island, they continue to expand it. Excellent way to get to/from the airport, the trick is to know the bus route to get you to your destination. Subway stations are huge and confusing, but they do have good exits map and marked Exits A B C D.."
,,Very convenient to navigate,4.0,,"you need to buy a travel card first and then load as much money as you want there are various different lines, red, blue violet etc , with clear pathways the announcements are made in Chinese, english and tamil"
,,"Great example of efficient, clean public transport",5.0,,"purchased a 24 hour tourist pass which cost $20 which included a $10 transport that could be redeemed when you return the card. You can return the card at the airport. Tourist pass allowed us to take an unlimited amount of trips in the 24 hours which was handy to avoid long ticket purchase lines around Marina Bay area. Trains were easy to navigate, very clean and comfortable."
,,So efficient and spotless,5.0,,Travelling on this system is an experience in itself. So clean and informative and gear to just people watch . The only difficulties we had were queues at ticket machines and would advise buying a multi use pass if you are visiting for a few days. Best metro system I have ever seen.
,,"Clean, frequent, MRT stations all over island",5.0,,"We used a mix of taxis and MRT for our travels. Often MRT in the morning, then a taxi to bring our tired selves back to the hotel. The signage is excellent, so it is easy to find your way. The trains are well kept. The service is a mix of both above ground and underground in the city centre. The above ground allows some glimpses of the country outside the downtown core."
,,"Quick, efficient and cheap",5.0,,"The MRT is a fantastic way to get around Singapore. It's quick, efficient and cheap.
Easy to use and clean but it can be quite crowded in peak times.
To start, purchase a card and add cash to it at an MRT office next to the entry points where commuters swipe their cards at each station. We started with just $5 on our card. Trips are under $1 a trip- very affordable- and charged by length of trip.
This is how many locals get around."
,,Brilliant mass transit railway,5.0,,"What an underground transport system should be, clean, safe, efficient, and reasonably cheap. Easy to find your way around, good disabled access and well signposted. Ten out of ten, loved by the locals."
,,Good value,4.0,,"The 3 day tourist pass for 20 dollars is very good value and the trains are clean, quick and frequent. There is a 10 dollar deposit for the travel card that is refunded when returned to the ticket office-they are keen recyclers in Singapore. Our main problem was finding our way out of Orchard Station which was nearest to our hotel. It wasn't a problem getting in. Orchard Road is the main shopping street and below ground there are three more levels of shops. The station is situated in the centre of this underground maze and there are so many exits we were popping up and down like moles trying to find our hotel. Still it added a bit of excitement to our journeys. All the other stations were easy to navigate."
,,Easy to use,5.0,,Just like my title I found the MRT ultra quick to learn how to use and very efficient :) if you're ever unsure there are always booths at the entrances/ exits who are more then happy to guide you
,,Very Efficient,5.0,,"Door to door!
The station was under our hotel so very convenient.
It's fast, clean, cheap and easy to suss out, as I used it for the first time today and am not too good at finding my way about.
A boon when the temp is 32C and the humidity high!"
,,Speedy travel,5.0,,"Get a card, put money on and use SMRT and buses. Busy at times but quick, clean and efficient. Singaporeans always giving up seats for those in need"
,,Excellent public transport,5.0,,"The Singapore Mass Rapid Transit public transport system is amazingly clean, safe and very dependable. Great way to get around Singapore."
,,Very Efficient and Clean,5.0,,"Coming from the Philippines, I really am very impressed with the train system of Singapore, its very clean, very efficient,very safe, stations are beautiful and people are disciplined. I wish we have the same in our country.

I take MRT whereever I go. Even from Changi to my hotel in Rocher and to my school in Woodlands."
,,A must,5.0,,"If you're visiting Singapore, use the MRT. Not only is it cheap, it is safe, clean and efficient.
If you're used to a transit system such as the London Tube, you will find this easy to use and understand.
We used the three day Singapore Tourist Pass, which is great value for money. Just be aware that it is only available from certain stations and they had sold out when we tried to buy ours from City Hall.
A deposit of $10 is required for each card but there was no problems with redeeming at the end of our three days"
,,Always excellent,5.0,,The system is still growing. The trains and stations are clean. This is the best way to get around Singapore.
,,Fast and convenient,5.0,,"Like most metros around the world, Singapore one is well planned and organised and allows travellers to access most of the city fairly quickly"
,,Excellent!,5.0,,"I lost my ez-link, didn't have much SGD left also didn't feel the need to exchange the currency since i only need one mrt ride to airport. I could say as a first timer standard ticket user, the machine is quite easy to use."
,,Travelling Tool in Singapore,5.0,,"Best transportation in Singapore. You can move around with MRT. Currently have North-East, North-South, East-West, Circle, Downtown line. It help you travel around Singapore."
,,Transportation is convenient,4.0,,The sign and direction are clear to understand and found the single trip ticket has re-arranged (five ways for each ticket) which is better than five years ago.
,,Gr8 way to get about,4.0,,"The MRT is very easy to use and gets you to most parts of the city. Our only observation is that the station names do not always reflect the site you are visiting for example you would expect Marina Bay Sands to be at Marina Bay when in fact the best stop for this is Bayfront.

All very clean and not at all claustrophobic. A gr8 way to get about."
,,Great public transport,5.0,,Going to work taking MRT is just great. Was a big fan of taking buses but taking train is just even better as it's easy and fast too Thank you SMRT team for making my ride to work and back home a enjoyable one...
,,"Convenient and quick, super clean.",5.0,,"A very good and modern underground system for getting around Singapore. Although not well publicised, you can get one to three day tourist passes which allow unlimited travel also on the buses. All the stations are well indicated and the trains tell you what the next stop is and even indicate which side the door will open. LED's on the maps show which station you have left and are approaching next. All the main tourist areas are serviced and you could even get to the Airport although, with luggage, we found it better to use a taxi which was surprisingly cheap anyway compared to other cities I've been. Naturally, the trains can get busy at peak times but we had no trouble getting on and off. Station platforms are marked with areas of where to stand and the locals are very good at allowing people off of thrains before attempting to get on. All announcements are, of course, in English if that helps."
,,The Only Way I Travel in SIngapore,5.0,,This is the cheapest and best way to travel around Singapore. It gets you around from the airport to all nook and cranny of this tiny country.
,,Great transport services,5.0,,"So clean, orderly and safe. You get to your destination in no time. It is also hanicap friendly with elevators in each station."
,,Up there with the London tube,5.0,,"Just a really good, efficient underground/light rail system that gets you most everywhere. You just buy a tap in/tap out card pretty much anywhere, 711, the station, etc, and it will tell you when it needs you to add money to it when you board. The same cards get you on and off all the busses for the few places on the island that the MRT won't get you close to. There's always food at the stations as well as clean bathrooms and the big focus is to be polite and considerate of the other travellers. It seems to be patterned after London's tube but with nicer rolling stock made in Canada by Bombardier. In a few minutes you can be anywhere and a $20 refill should last you all week."
,,"Avoid.the humidity, get a standard tixket which can be topped up as you need it, visit all the placed you need",5.0,,"Brilliant, fast, efficient, clean . I'd use it every time as walking in the humidity can be draining. Just have coins to top up your ticket as you need it. It won't give you more than S$4 change."
,,Great deal,5.0,,"Used MRT for sightseeing. With Tourist pass, combine it with buses and all tourist locations acessible"
,,clean public transport always,5.0,,efficiency with time and clean enviroment do have reserve seats for elderly and pregnancy woman as well tats great and so caring i can see from singapore culture and we are so happy to be part of singapore.
,,Only way to get around!,5.0,,Wow! I wish all cities had such an inexpensive and efficient transit system as SMRT! Ontime and clean.
,,"Efficient, clean and safe",5.0,,"This is the best public transportation system I've ever travelled on. It's easy to navigate, inexpensive and safe. The air conditioning is a great plus in the tropical heat although it blasts pretty good and makes for a chilly ride if you aren't wearing sleeves."
,,Singapore MRT,5.0,,"My wife and I recently holidayed in Singapore for 10 days. We loaded our EZ Link card on our first day and travelled to Jurong Shopping Malls, Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo, Changi Museum, Chinatown, Marina Bay,/Raffles Bay and Orchard Rd on several occasions and still have credit on our cards.The easy access to all MRT Stations and to Bus services is a credit to the Singapore Transport Planners. Waiting time at stations is much easier & time saving than hailing a taxi, and considerably easier on your Budget."
,,Excellent Service,5.0,,"I go to Singapore a lot.While my staying at SG I prefer MRT most. Its cost effective, reliable, just on time and there are so many MRT stations all over SG."
,,Well worth using,4.0,,"The MRT signage seemed the only aspect of Singapore that was less-than-perfectly designed, so you may need to ask some questions at first. However, the transport is quick, clean, and very inexpensive. We generally used it in preference to taxis just for the convenience. Remember to toss out your food and drink before going down to the subway."
,,Love the SMRT,5.0,,We caught the MRT and it was amazing ..the train is so clean and fast...there is no eating or drinking on the MRT and its so easy to get to where you want to go
,,Excellent transportation,5.0,,"Puts London Underground to shame, scrupulously clean stations and trains which were surprisingly easy to use. Ticket machine easy to master and staff on hand to guide anyone having problems. Press the screen on the station you wish to go to and ticket prints out for you. Very reasonably priced, Marina Bay to Orchard Road late evening only just over 3 dollars for 2 persons. Clean and modern trains."
,,Good!,5.0,,"Handy/cheap way to travel, used disposable (can use up to 6x) tickets for my short trip. However, when travelling as a couple Uber was not that much more expensive than using SMRT that requires you to change lines occasionally. Would recommend checking Uber prices before hopping on SMRT"
,,great underground system,4.0,,"clean, on time and informative system. great for people with disabilities - lifts everywhere but need to walk twice as much for the lifts!"
,,Very easy,5.0,,"Very easy to use.

If confused ask the staff for help. Theyre great.

Simply select where you wish to go on map and buy a ticket. Machines only accept small notes $10, $5, $2 and coin. Keep the card that the machine gives you which you use when entering and exsiting the station. You may add up to 6 trips on the one card. Trips cost approx $1.60 each way."
,,Easy transport,5.0,,"It is easy to use, everything is clean (also the toilets located on the stations) and not really expensive. It really is a nice public transport system."
,,lovely public transport system,5.0,,"in Delhi we have metro , but i found Singapore MRT very good in terms of connectivity, service, being new to Singapore, i explored entire city by MRT"
,,Simple and efficient,5.0,,We bought a 3 day tourist pass for 30 SGD. The metro is very easy to use and it will bring you around the city very fast. The stations and the trains are the most clean I've ever seen. Remember you are not allowed to eat or drink anything in the trains.
,,Amazing transportation system,5.0,,"I spend a lot of time in many cities around the world. But the Singapore MRT is one of the best transportation systems for sure. Fast, clean, secure, efficient, on time."
,,Various trips,5.0,,This certainly put the pigsty that is London underground to shame .Efficient clean and value for money. Buy a travel card which covers this and buses .Any money left can be refunded.
,,So easy and clean,5.0,,"Super impressed with how easy this system is to use. Buying a ticket is easy, as it figuring out where to go. ..additionally the train station and trains themselves are the cleanest vehicular I've ever seen, good job Singapore!"
,,MRT Singapore,5.0,,"To ride MRT, it is better to have a prepaid card otherwise you must have exact change in S$ & cents as you have to get ticket from a ticketing machine. Same thing is true for bus ride. If you don't have change, you loose excess amount as there is no conductor to return you excess change."
,,Easy to use MRT,5.0,,"We stayed in Singapore during February 2017 & used the MRT while we were there to get around. It was easy to use & a reasonable price. We paid 10 dollars for four tickets to the airport from Clarke Quay which took around 45 minutes & was easy to do.The MRT goes right into the airport which is good
You can buy tickets from machines or a ticket office & use cash or card , both are easy to do"
,,Great Value Travel,5.0,,"The SMRT is quick, clean, efficient and affordable. We bought Ezylink cards, and topped them up with cash when we needed to . The money we didn't use was returned to us at the end of our stay. All lines are easy to follow, and both written and spoken announcements inside the trains make your journey a breeze."
,,MTR is an awesome way to travel,5.0,,"Fast, reliable, clean, safe, cheap but you won't get a seat - unless you're faster than granny! And granny in Singapore is faster than Usain Bolt when she wants a seat.

The system maps are easy to read, as are the in station signs.

Interchanges where you can change lines are busy, but easy to negotiate.
Singapore has pretty orderly pedestrian flow so that person walking against the crowd is probably a tourist. So go with the flow and there's no bumping and rush.

You can travel from the airport to the city - super easy.

Buy an EZ-LINK card, it's a stored value card and works on the MTR and buses. Best $12 I spent - and of course rechargeable and refundable (mine had a picture of Winnie the poo on it - so Evan grannies on the MTR think that's cute)

Definitely the fastest way to cover any distance"
,,"Fast, clean efficient",5.0,,Not much more to say. It's spotless and efficient. Not expensive and it gets cheaper if you use a Tourist Pass. The main advantage is it avoids the time taken to buy individual tickets. The tourist pass is only available at certain locations so check before you go to buy one. Fortunately it can be cashed in for any remaining deposit at any MRT station.
,,Very convenient and fast,5.0,,If you are planing to visit the tourist attractions in Singapore and want to do economically get a SMRT card is the way to go. They offer different types of cards depending on your length of stay. All the main attractions you must visit in the city are within walking distance of a MRT station.
,,Just brilliant,5.0,,"Make sure you get your transit card at the airport or any seven eleven or train station.

It's very cheap and trains and buses run every few minutes.

Most trips seem to only be $1 or $2

The most challenging part is working the right exit out of the station. Thankfully Google maps tells you that!

Originally I used it for longer trips, but due to the heat more and more I used it for shorter journeys as escaping the heat in air-conditioning was a welcome relief."
,,Efficient,5.0,,Travelled mostly on smrt. Travel card allows travel on buses too. Punctuality and cleanliness Singapore transportation can boast to the world.
,,What's not to like!,5.0,,"Always a pleasure to visit Singapore and ride the public transport system. It's super reliable, clean & safe. Oh did I mention cheap as well. All countries around the world should follow Singapores lead."
,,Leaves Melbourne to SHAME,5.0,,"So easy to use, get your card loaded wth SNG$ and just go for it. from the zoo and night safari, to the botanic gardens, and of course shopping. I try and stay at a hotel near an interchange station which saves a few extra minutes per day, but really, it is fast, efficient and cheap."
,,First Class - Great Value,5.0,,"Tickets are inexpensive. Even if you use MRT a lot, I found it cheaper to buy a top up card rather then a 3 day tourist pass."
,,"Outstanding, easy to navigate public transportation system",5.0,,"The Singapore MRT system is inexpensive, easy to navigate and covers most of Singapore. We used it extensively for four days. There are easy to read maps both above ground and in all stations. The stations are well marked above ground and fairly close to each other. The trains arrive every 3-5 minutes most days. The cost of each ride is based on the length of travel. You buy a card for 12 Singapore dollars. Five dollars is the cost of the card- $7 is your use of fare money. To refill, the minimum is $10- but if there is leftover dollars on the card, they refund you that money. It is a great system! The trains are kept immaculately clean."
,,Very clean and efficient,5.0,,"The mrt is a representation of everything that singapore stands for- cleanliness, speed, efficiency and technology."
,,"Fast, clean and best way of transport",4.0,,"If you want to explore Singapore in less budget then metro is the best option for you,you can take one day pass or a three day pass if you are visiting for a short time they also have a monthly pass, it's easy cheap and faster way of commute. You can not see the city from metro as its underground. Staff is very helpful and friendly and are ready for your service all the time."
,,Reliable and efficient,5.0,,We used the hop on off bus for 2 days which was good but inefficient in getting directly from A to B. Went to MRT station at Botanical Gardens and got really good assistance from one of the staff. Have been using train ever since and getting around Singapore is a breeze. Take note not to eat or drink on the train unless you want to pay a hefty fine.
,,Fantastic Service,5.0,,Wonderful for getting around beautiful Singapore. Staff sohelpful and concerned about travelers in their city.
,,Best transport system ever,5.0,,"I recently visited Singapore and was blown away by the amazing SMRT system there. It's so cheap. Literally pence in English money to go anywhere. The trains are immaculate clean, on time and driverless so I guess compared to England's appalling transport system this is the way to go. A great cheap way to see all of singapore"
,,MRT in Singapore,4.0,,"Clean, punctual, cheap and modern, the Singaporean MRT is the best way to get around the City. Buy an EZ pre payment card for easy use of the system."
,,Great,5.0,,Fab way around the city. Easy to use and good value. Similar to dubai. Stations are all over and ticket system easy to navigate
,,Excellent,5.0,,"a train every few minutes, very good signage so no chance of getting lost, incredibly clean, numerous seats for the elderly etc, very quick.
the average ticket was costing us less than a dollar, so very economical - easy to buy and use the EZ card and scan on and off.
even how people get on and off, and move through the tunnels is well coordinate, with numerous access points to shopping centres and the like - easy to stay underground and get to wherever you want to go.
This system is a credit to the people who designed and built it"
,,cheap and convenient,4.0,,"We took it from the airport to Jurong East station, its clean, on time and the rate is considered cheap. Just that there are too many stations in between and wish that there is an express line from the airport and only stop at those interchange stations."
,,Very efficient!,5.0,,"Clean, efficient, cheap to use! Advise getting the tourism 1-3 day pass depending on how long you're staying. If not buy a 1 day card and to up. Map really simple to navigate!"
,,Excellent MRT which was expected even before experiencing!!,5.0,,"We virtually depended on the MRT in Singapore throughout our stay in Singapore for 7 days. Must say both the MRT as well as the bus service SBS Transit was impeccable in their service quality.

If you use the Singapore MRT and the bus service, you can literally predict your travel time by the minute. It is that accurate.

There are various lines like East-West (Green) line, North-South (Red) line, North East (Purple) line, Circle (orange) line and Downtown (blue) line. Out of these, we got to experience only East West, North South and Circle lines. The Singapore MRT was widely used by us when we travelled to Harbourfront MRT (Circle Line) to go to Sentosa Island and then to Boon Lay MRT (East West line) for Jurong Bird Park and then to Ang Mo Kio MRT (North-South Line) for the Singapore Night Safari.

Very important:

- I recommend that any visitor who wants to travel by Singapore MRT and SGS Transit (bus service) necessarily needs to buy the EZ Link pre-paid cards. Firstly these are available @ Changi airport (departure). My recommendation is that the moment you land at Changi, you must buy these cards. Secondly, these are readily available and can be charged at the 7 Eleven stores all over Singapore and also at all MRT stations. Singapore is largely a cashless nation. In fact, if I am not mistaken it is one of the top 5 cashless nations in the world. Then it is a matter of convenience. It is virtually very difficult to do transactions for the MRT and bus service using cash as this requires small change and every time you have to ask at counters and the bus drivers for the exact fare and tender the change. It is really really impractical. Also, 99% of local people in Singapore have smart cards for their public transport and you will look really foolish in being the only one on a bus transacting in cash! PLEASE BUY EZ LINK cards for public travel in Singapore. Period! They are as important as water is for survival! Also, these EZ Link cards can be used for buying anything in Singapore. Yes, they are accepted as payments at many departmental stores including 7 elevens. A good value to get the cards loaded for starters is around SGD 10-12.

2. The other recommendation is that you use streetdirectory.com when using public transport in Singapore. It is the most awesome app (must download the app on your phone). You can see each and every route by MRT or bus just by typing where you want to go. And then the most amazing part is that this app gives you live timing of trains and buses. It will give you alternative routes, will even let you know where to walk, where to take a train and where to take a bus and the exact fare. It is simply magic and it is simply awesome. And then it has live location services through GPS. So, when you are walking it literally gives you which direction to walk in like Google map! And when you are on the train or bus it will tell you exactly where you are and when is the station or stand where you have to get down is coming. The best part is while you are waiting at a bus stand, the app tells you that a particular bus which you need to take is coming in the next 1 minute. And then when it says ""arriving"" you can literally look up and see the bus coming round the corner. It is magical.

If you have streetdirectory.com and the EZ Link cards, trust me you are all set to travel from any point to another in Singapore without even asking anybody and that too in the predicted time given in the app. We were literally dependent on these 2 things every day when we ventured out in Singapore. They are like requiring air to breathe!!

3. For cabs in Singapore - please note that you have Uber in Singapore which is the cheapest. The other taxi service which is very good and reliable is Comfort Delgro. They also have an app. And you can use the app to book cabs. But, just keep in mind that you probably need local Singapore number for Comfort Delgro app, whereas for Uber the one you already have on your phone will work seamlessly in Singapore.

The best fun in Singapore is to use public transport because it is the cheapest and the most convenient. And on top of that, you get to know Singapore like never before."
,,If you are going to be in Singapore a few days you can buy an MRT card -,5.0,,"MRT cards SGD$12 and includes $7 in credits to travel. Can be used on buses or trains. Average sector cost is 0.78 cents but if you paid cash on a bus it is $1.60. There are tourist ones as well that include some entries, but as I travel to Singapore a bit the MRT card is better for my needs. Tap on and tap off."
,,Easy to use!,5.0,,"Fastest way to get around the city plus very Clean and Easy to use.
You can buy tickets for single trips, but if you intend to use the MRT and basic bus services frequently during your visit, you can buy a Singapore Tourist Pass, a special EZ-Link stored-value card which will allow you unlimited travel for one day (S$10), two days (S$16) or three days (S$20). The cards can be bought at the TransitLink Ticket Office at the following MRT stations: Changi Airport, Orchard, Chinatown, City Hall, Raffles Place, Ang Mo Kio, HarbourFront, Bugis, Lavender and Bayfront."
,,Terrific way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"As a tourist, buy a one, two or three day pass which takes you everywhere on train and bus. Hand it in when you finish (at the station booth where you buy it) and you get a refund of some of the cost. The booth shuts at 9pm, by the way, but you can do it the next morning. Trains are clean, fast, and AC keeps you cool while it's hot and humid above ground."
,,Superior Transit Sytem,5.0,,Used the SMRT to Expo Centre and Airport. Also to get around the city. Only complaint it was shut down during the Standard Charter Marathon. Traffic getting to the start line was horrific.
,,A marvel,5.0,,"Easy to navigate, lots of assistance around if you happen to need it. Ticketing straightforward. Spotlessly clean. Never wait more than a couple of minutes, Leaves our train systems in Australia so far behind its embarrassing"
,,Excellent public transport,4.0,,"SMRT is one of the best Mass Rapid transit systems with highly accurate timings. Despite the growing population of Singapore, the MRT system is highly effective travelling within Singapore. The card system is pretty good (though the fees for the card is non refundable)."
,,Excellent transport system.,5.0,,"Each time I visit Singapore I am in awe of their amazing transport system. So easy to navigate around Singapore. So clean, no graffiti, no more than 3 minute wait for connecting trains. So cheap. Wish we could have this in Melbourne!"
,,One of the best in the world,5.0,,"We used the MRT for 3 full days and found it to be exceptional. We bought our 3 day passes after getting off cruise ship in terminal. You can get 1-3 day passes. The 3 day pass was $20.00 and you pay a $10.00 fee for the returnable transit card.

The driverless trains are the cleanest and most efficient I've ever used. Everything I so well laid out, clean and reliable. WE traveled all over the city and really got our value out of this system. It is easy to use and very similar in design to other large metro systems in Europe and the US. For those that have no experience with MRT type transport, don't be intimidated. This system is easy and good maps, signage are everywhere.

After we took our last trip we returned our cards at one of the ticket office and got our $10.00 deposits back. That gave us unlimited rides for 3 days for $20.00 and that would include to and from the airport!! Sure wish every city had systems like this !!!"
,,Visiting places,4.0,,"Very convenient, well signed and clean. Ease of use. Affordable rates makes it a pleasure to ride on."
,,Gets you anywhere you want to go!,5.0,,"The MRT is a great way to travel in Singapore. Crowded no doubt but saves you a lot of money. Take it from the airport, to the zoo in the north, Gardens by the Bay in the south, East Coast parkway (for your seafood) in the east and the Science Center and birdpark in the west."
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,The MRT is very well sign posted. The staff and also the Singaporean people are very friendly and helpful. We purchased a $25.00 smart rider card and this still had $14.20 on it when we left. We used it all the time over our 6 days stay and have kept the card for next time we visit when we can just top it up with more money.
,,Seriously an attraction?,3.0,,"My average rating is only to indicate that this is not an attraction to plan a visit. Every big city has an MRT. But yes. If you ask me to rate Singapore MRT compared to other cities, I would probably give it 4.5/5"
,,Outstanding & easy,5.0,,"Deal of the day was a rechargeable card for $12 of which $7 was credit for rides. Rode all day and still had 4.20 left. It was exceptionally easy as they announce every stop and upcoming transfers in English as well as they are lit up in the train. The cleanest trains I have ever seen. No music, loud talking, cell phone talk."
,,"Easy to navigate, reliable and cost effective",5.0,,"A great transit system and very easy to navigate. Trains are clean and air conditioned and trains arrive quickly. English is widely used. Visitors can buy a 1, 2 or 3 day unlimited pass for 10,16 or 20 Singapore dollars from certain locations -eg airport, cruise terminal etc.. SMRT will also get you to and from the airport."
,,So clean,5.0,,"I think my husband would be getting tired of hearing me say:"" I can't believe how clean this whole system is. Not one not one piece of paper or trash anywhere. Modern sign w lighted indicators let you know which stops you were approaching. Also loved the lighted sign that tells you what side of the train the doors are opening. Easy efficient clean. Enjoy"
,,"a driverless SMRT , clean, fast and running on time.",5.0,,"Great way to travel around the City or from airport to City which only costs S$2.50 one way to Chinatown from the airport. The cab would costs around S$35.- It is rapid and frequent , we would never wait longer than 5 mins. It stops services after midnight. You can get a hard plastic card instead of paper one which you can put more money say $10 or $20 in so you don't have to queue up at the station every time you travel."
,,Clean Reliable Efficent,5.0,,"This is without doubt one of the worlds best metro railway systems. There is no better way to explore Singapore on a budget, the easy to navigate system drops you to all the hot button spots from shopping in Orchard, Botanic Gardens, Marina Bay, China Town and Bugis to name a few. Cheap clean safe and efficient the MRT is a must do to explore this great city state."
,,Easy way to get around,5.0,,Cheap and easy to use to get around Singapore. Tickets available at the station by machines. Very clean and tidy.
,,MRT rocks,5.0,,"Perth (WA) could really do with a version of the SMRT. Sorry- getting political. It is one of the easiest transport systems I have ever used in my travels. Children under 7 are free. Get your SMRT travel card for $5 from the many vendors (small grocery shops etc) and then add value at the machines located at the fronatge of the MRT stations. You can also top up at the MRT counter which are serviced by humans. Its quick, with a train coming every 4 minutes, its very clean, incredibly safe, cheap and is a wonderful example of how travelling on public transport can be an enjoyable and stress free experience."
,,Cheap easy transport!,5.0,,"Buy a prepaid card. $5 deposit and $7 credit. Top up as you go. Airport to Orchard station was $1.75. Amazing. Aircon, clean, safe."
,,Easy Travel To And From Airport,5.0,,"SMRT is one of the easiest transit systems in the world. The only hassle is buying a single ticket, where you need Singapore dollars because the machines do not take credit cards. Maps are everywhere, the trains are clean, spacious enough for luggage and frequent. Every station has ample staff to direct and guide. We went from the airport to the Marina Bay Cruise Terminal. $2.90 Singapore Dollars and about 45 minutes. For two people 1/5 the cost of a taxi."
,,Using it to get around all town,5.0,,MRT in Singapore is definitely one of the world's best and most sophisticated. Makes it easy to get around even to teh remotest places in Singapore
,,SMRT,5.0,,One of the best transport systems in the whole world. Fast and reliable despite the occasional breakdowns. Easy to navigate and very clear instructions.
,,You Can Count On It,4.0,,Its always on time when it comes to punctuality. Signage to it are pretty clear to see and understand.
,,Super clean and efficient.,5.0,,"Like most subways/metro in Asia, Singapore's public transit is efficient and clean. I haven't a bad word to say about it and would recommend using it without hesitation.

The taxis and Uber were fine but when possible I liked to save money using the SMRT.

We bought cards for our stay here and you can get refunded the balance when you leave so make sure to return to the ticket/card office before you leave the SMRT your last time."
,,Great system and easy to use,5.0,,We bought a 3 day city pass and used it extensively. It is great value for money on a very efficient and easy to use system.
,,Save Time,5.0,,"If you go to harbour front for ferry trip or spore cruise it better not to drive your car because it an hassle to find
a parking lots on weekend.
Take SMRT is a direct line it save you time and money.
Senior citizen better still it cost you only SGD 87 cents"
,,Simple,5.0,,Excellent way to get around Singapore. Easy and very cost effective. Plenty maps to see where your next point of call is. Clean and safe were an added bonus.
,,So easy to use!,5.0,,"Great way to get around, so easy and reasonably priced. Clean and direct. Reaches all the main attractions."
,,Efficient and cheap way to get around.,5.0,,"Buy the ez link card available from the manned stations at the train station. You will need to use cash to purchase and it is $12 with $5 of that a non-refundable card fee. Using the card gives discounted fares - most of our fares cost 77c to $1.50 depending on how many stations travelled. The card can be topped up using cash at the same place purchased or with card at the machines at the station.
There were always long lines to purchase individual tickets and you need smaller currency to purchase so highly recommend the ez link card. Also app with station map is very handy to have on phone!!!"
,,Best way to get around singapore!,5.0,,"In my opinion the MRT Is incredibly easy to use, quick, clean and the tourist pass is a absolute bargain allowing you to get on / off as many times as you see necessary. Avoid those taxis and travel like locals!"
,,An Excellent and Easy to use Mass Transit System.,5.0,,The SMRT and Hong Kong's MTR are my two favorite transportation systems. They both have lifts and escalators for easy access. They are both clean. I am very impressed with the SMRT system especially the trains.
,,"Safe, clean, quick...",5.0,,"Really the best way to travel through Singapore. Easy, clean, safe, quick... I really recommend this way of traveling"
,,Excellent Transport Service,5.0,,Highly recommend getting the tourist pass which can be for as many days as you require. Can be used on the trains and busses and get you from and to the airport.
,,Good cheap way to get around,4.0,,"If you want the cheapest 3 day ticket you have to go to city hall station for it, also you get a $10 refund at the airport."
,,So easy,5.0,,"Fantastic way to get around and so cheap. Only cost us $2 from changi airport to our hotel. Melbourne Australia take note of how to do a metro train system.
You can get a card at the airport but note that $10 is the minimum top up."
,,"Clean, fast, cheap and straight forward",5.0,,Best subway system I've used by a long way. Great for moving around the city at a price that you would happily pay more for. Other major cities should take note.
,,Just a ride,3.0,,"Connected to parts of Singapore, except some very major tourist attractions like Singapore Zoo (alternative will be a direct bus service which is more reliable). Has tourist stored value card for 1 day or 3 days etc, unlimited and all, but advice is to forgo buying card. Most shopping and attractions are within the city and if you plan your day, you will probably only take the train or bus twice each, certainly not worth the amount to pay for the per day card.
Train has broken down multiple times in reliability in super efficient Singapore, though in most cases it cause only 10-15 mins longer travelling time. Still it is a means of transport to travel in cool comfort (all buses in Singapore are also air conditioned by the way), and it does beats the heavy traffic at point. Quite monotonous ride, and because the main lines call in at the city, there's no human touch to the ride, just mechanical motions and signs. Pity, they could spice things up with witty advertisements or AV ads like what Thailand and Hongkong are doing.

Note: Not worth buying the tourist card. Short rides mostly within the city, with recommended stops at Orchard Road (Takashimaya, ION, Shaw, Paragon, 313 etc), Marina Bay (Marina Bay Sands), Harbourfront (VivoCity/Sentosa)."
,,"Good, quick and in time",5.0,,"If we stay in the Singapore we always use MRT to travel around the city. Easy to get tickets, good service at every station and valuable for small money."
,,excellent clean quiet service.,5.0,,"Wow this transport is the best we have been on around the world. Very easy to use and so clean and quiet. Makes you feel ashamed of what the UK has to offer. We bought a 3 day pass to hop on hop off anywhere in the city. Cost 30 SGD for a plastic card for use on the network. 10SGD is refundable when the card is returned. The card can be for 1, 2 or 3 days. It's a no brainer when visiting the city."
,,Amazing,5.0,,"London should take note - this is how underground travel should be. Spotlessly clean, no food or drink allowed on board and passengers that respect each other. No pushing and shoving to get on and off, barriers built on the platforms to prevent ""accidents"" onto the line.
Ticket machines clear and easy to understand and all stations had plenty of signage so you knew which exit points to leave from.
No complaints - a pleasurable journey each time."
,,A good public transportation,5.0,,"Singapore also known for its public transportation and this SMRT is one of them, you can get nearly anywhere with this kind of transportation"
,,What a great way to go!!,5.0,,"Easy to use, inexpensive, clean as a whistle. A model of how a public transit system should operate."
,,"good, cheap, reliable way to travel in Singapore",5.0,,"I would travel by SMRT/ MRT in Singapore as it is very convenient,cheap and fast way to travel throughout the Whole Singapore. I always take the reliable, safe public transport. B ut I would try to keep away from the peak hour times as it can get a little crowded in the trains. Best and cheapest times to travel is the Off-peak times between 0900hrs to 1700hrs."
,,Great ... if you can buy a ticket !,2.0,,"The SMRT is frequent fast and very clean however it falls down when trying to buy a ticket. You can only buy at one of the very few machines you can't use a card and they only accept certain notes and coins so you need the right money. The operators in tbe booths might give you change but don't bank on it. If you get to a busy station you have to wait ages to queue for a ticket. If you buy a top up card you will have to queue again to get your deposit back.

Just needs more ticket machines and for them to accept cards and more notes."
,,one of the best public transport in asia,5.0,,coming in close second to japan...it's clean and well ventilated and are always on time. best part is all stations are connected to malls 😊
,,Easy to navigate,5.0,,"We used the Train (SMRT) system quite a few times. I actually downloaded a Singapore Rail App for my phone before I left so seeing the different lines and where they stopped was easy.

Our Ezy-Link card worked for the train as well as the bus lines. It was very much cheaper than the bus - and covered most of the popular tourist spots.

My only advice is to take care during peak hours (we found it quite bad between 5-7pm) if you don't like crowds, as the trains really pack passengers in and it can get quite claustrophobic.

While you can carry groceries on the train, eating and drinking is not allowed and can result in a fine.

Pick up an Ezy-Link card from one of the train stations or a 7-11. It works on buses and trains. Working out the exact fares was difficult - this was really fast and easy."
,,Efficient and World Class,5.0,,"If you're staying in Singapore for any extended length of time get familiar with the MRT system. It's clean, always on time, and easy to use. It makes getting around Singapore a breeze."
,,"Fast, affordable, efficient!",4.0,,"I really enjoyed the conveninece it offers. It keeps your expenses within your budget, as you dont have the ride the taxi all the time. With th esingapore tourist pass, it makes it even more afforadable and hassle free!"
,,Couldn't do without it!,5.0,,"If visiting Singapore, buy a top-up card from the ticket office. You can use these on both the MRT and the busses. Google maps is great for directions - gives you MRT lines and bus numbers to work with."
,,Efficient and Economic,5.0,,"Travel from almost anywhere to almost anywhere in Singapore on this fast, modern and clean subway. It seems you never have to wait more than a few minutes for the next train no matter which line you are on."
,,Highly recommend working out your plans to use SMRT.,4.0,,We decided to visit sans car. Very happy we did. SMRT worked out very well for us. We bought a ticket each time we made a trip. If you know you are making a round trip you can but both ways at the same time. If you are hoping around it is best to buy a stop at a time with the paper ticket.
,,Very good service,4.0,,"I live in a very small town the the UK,not a fan of crowded spaces but the underground Train was great, people walked to the right coming out of the station not in a large mass! Easy to get tickets and help if needed."
,,Good deal,4.0,,"Get the 3 day "" The Singapore Tourist Pass "" and you can visit most anywhere for SGD 6.70 per day .
Searching via google maps , will show a ridiculous bus route and make as though the trains do not access places like Geylang etc . WRONG !
In any case just take your turn at the Passenger Service window and ask the local staff. You will be surprised .
Each card comes with a refundable SGD 10 deposit , which you can claim back at the airport counter"
,,Convenient and inexpensive,5.0,,The mass transit of Singapore is easy very convenient for everyone. Its a great thing to do to experience the way of life of the people. Its easy to master even for tourists...
,,Escalators toooo fast,4.0,,"Very helpful mode to get across the city..with informative maps in place, even a stranger in the city can travel comfortably without knowing his way around..plus it's cheaper than the cabs. Also very clean."
,,Great way to get around Singapore,5.0,,"Fantastic! Clean, clean, clean and safe, safe, safe! Very efficient way around town and accessible at the right destinations. Modern equipment, smooth ride with complete confidence and ease of use."
,,Best way to get around,5.0,,"I used it extensively on my visit to Singapore. Very clean and so easy to use. Very well sign posted, I never once needed assistance to find my way around."
,,Easy to get around,5.0,,SMRT is fast and clean and gets you around safely in Singapore. A bit crowded in peak times but have a sleep in and then you're very comfortable between 9am and 4pm. Tickets are easy for visitors and a 3 day pass works at around 6 dollars a day for unlimited travel.
,,Good connectivity but fair amount of walking involved,3.0,,"Connects almost every part of the city to the other across length and breadth, but also involves a good deal of walking inside, difficult for tourists."
,,Stroller friendly,5.0,,"One of the transportation mode recommended when you are in Singapore. It's cheap, connected to various tourist object. And the important thing is stroller friendly if you gi with your baby"
,,Fast and efficient,5.0,,"Easy to use and very inexpensive. Efficient and on time and the visitors` pass is superb value we even used it to get to the airport at Chinese New Year, when taxis were in short supply."
,,Great for getting around Singapore,4.0,,"Nice, clean, easy way for getting around Singapore. Downside is there are many areas that are not accessible, and the ticket system can be somewhat off for some. However, it is very functional and signage is everywhere.....although assistance if needed to the easiest to obtain."
,,Using the train and bus to get around,5.0,,Impressed by the cleanliness and efficiency of the system. Australia could learn a lot on how a system should be run.
,,Great way to get around,5.0,,"This is such an easy way to get about once you know how to use it. It's in the process of becoming pretty cashless but you can easily buy tickets for each journey and even re use your card board ticket upto 6 times with a slight discount each time. Most trips for us seem to cost about $1.40 and it is straightforward to work out which station to use with maps in each stop, escalators in each station and toilets in most stations. There is plenty of space and wide underground passages. Has to be one of the nicest metro experiences I have had which helpful staff in ticket offices and at the electronic kiosks.
The stations are marked on all the city maps and the line they are on"
